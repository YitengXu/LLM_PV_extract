    , Accepted 29th August 2021First published on 6th October 2021AbstractIt is common knowledge that molecular energy level offsets of a type II heterojunction formed at the donor–acceptor interface are considered to be the driving force for photoinduced charge transfer in organic solar cells. Usually, these offsets – present between molecular energy levels of the donor and acceptor – are obtained via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of organic semiconductors cast in a film or dissolved in solution. Simply transferring such determined energy levels from solution or film of single materials to blend films may be obviously limited and not be possible in full generality. Herein, we report various cases of material combinations in which novel non-fullerene acceptors did not yield successful charge transfer, although energy levels obtained by CV on constituting single materials indicate a type II heterojunction. Whilst the integer charge transfer (ICT) model provides one explanation for a relative rise of molecular energy levels of acceptors, further details and other cases have not been studied so far in great detail. By applying energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ER-EIS) on several donor–acceptor combinations, a Fano-like resonance feature associated with a distinctive molecular energy level of the acceptor as well as various relative molecular energy level shifts of different kinds could be observed. By analyzing ER-EIS and absorption spectra, not only the exciton binding energy within single materials could be determined, but also the commonly unknown binding energy of the CT state with regard to the joint density of states (jDOS) of the effective semiconductor. The latter is defined by transitions between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the acceptor. Using this technique among others, we identified cases in which charge generation may occur either via uphill or by downhill processes between the charge transfer exciton and the electronic gap of the effective semiconductor. Exceptionally high CT-exciton binding energies and thus low charge generation yields were obtained for a case in which the donor and acceptor yielded a too intimate blend morphology, indicating π–π stacking as a potential cause for unfavorable molecular energy level alignment.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) may soon enter novel application areas for renewable energy supply as solar modules can now be fabricated at a larger scale with lower cost and shorter energy payback times. Further advantages are the ease of installation and the realization of flexible, transparent, and lightweight energy conversion devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), which have been already under development for several decades, notably took off with the turn of the millennium, initially yielding efficiency numbers in excess of 1%1–4 and a decade later in excess of 10%.5–8 After some lag in further improvements, the performance rise gained momentum recently again and enabled multiple cases of polymer-based OSCs in excess of 15% PCE under AM 1.5 standard conditions, made possible by a large extent due to the introduction and further development of novel non-fullerene derivatives.9–18
Let us at this point briefly reflect on the requirements for OSCs: since these materials commonly exhibit exciton binding energies of at least one order of magnitude above the thermal energy kBT (26 meV at room temperature (RT)), exciton splitting and thus charge generation require an additional driving force.2,19–22 The electron donor–electron acceptor concept is established by offsets in molecular energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The electron may utilize LUMODonor–LUMOAcceptor and the hole HOMOAcceptor–HOMODonor energy relaxation to obtain charge separation, yielding electrons on the acceptor and holes on the donor. By definition, a type II heterojunction provides these requirements, while a heterojunction of type I results in energy transfer (compare with Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic of two kinds of organic semiconductor heterojunctions: type I heterojunction yielding energy transfer (left) and type II heterojunction yielding charge transfer (right). 
Information about molecular energy levels is commonly obtained by determination of oxidation (≈HOMO) or reduction (≈LUMO) onsets via cyclic voltammetry (CV).23,24 Alternatively, photoelectron spectroscopy methods such as ultraviolet (UPS) or inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) are utilized to determine the corresponding ionization potential (IP ≈ HOMO) and electron affinity (EA ≈ LUMO), respectively. However, these methods, measured in electrolyte solutions (CV) or in vacuum (UPS, IPES), respectively, are imprecise. In the case of CV, kinetic effects arising from the diffusion of ions or dissolved materials or by the build-up of semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces, e.g., by charged double layers, may limit the precision of the measurement.25 In the case of photoelectron spectroscopy, the impact of electric fields could lead to some inaccuracies as well.26 But, most importantly, these measurements are usually only conducted on single materials, and thus no information about energy level alignments at potentially buried donor–acceptor interfaces is obtained. However, most scientists take the individually determined energy levels of isolated donor and acceptor materials to derive the energy level offset, which may be misleading. Notable exceptions are the application of CV and UPS (in combination with argon ion or cluster sputtering) on donor–acceptor blend films. In the first case (CV) molecular energy level shifts of the HOMO have been detected upon blending as compared to the single donor material,27 which could be confirmed independently by analyzing the charge transfer transitions in dependence of the blend ratio of a ternary blend.28 By UPS depth profiling not only the compositional profile of the donor and acceptor could be obtained, but also the depth dependent HOMO–HOMO offsets between them could be recorded.29
In the case of physical vapor deposition, energy level alignments can principally be observed by following the energy levels for layer-by-layer growth, but for solution-processed materials, generally such well-defined interfaces are hardly obtained and thus are rarely investigated. For such cases, the integer charge transfer (ICT) model has been developed and offers a concept to predict energy level alignments for organic semiconductor heterojunctions.31–38 From a somewhat more distant perspective, this model is similar to Fermi-level equilibration, which is applied to classical inorganic semiconductor p/n-homo- and p/n-heterojunctions. Interestingly, the ICT model provides an explanation for the development of interfacial dipoles resulting in relative “up-shifts” of acceptor energy levels – corresponding to a ground-state charge transfer from the donor to acceptor (compare Fig. 2). This model requires the knowledge of the energy values of so-called interfacial polarons, which involve the concept of charge carriers “self-trapping” by polarizing their surroundings. However, many additional effects complicating the energy level alignments are beyond the scope of the ICT model.
 Fig. 2  Ground-state interactions predicted by the integer charge transfer (ICT) for different situations concerning the relative position of energy edges of interface polaron energies of donor EICT+,D and acceptor EICT−,A (picture adapted from ref. 30). 
It is worth mentioning that about a decade earlier, Arkhipov et al. have predicted and calculated ground-state electron transfer from MDMO-PPV to PCBM,39 in agreement with the ICT model. But could there potentially occur other additional energy level alignments besides building up an interfacial dipole via ground-state charge transfer from the donor to acceptor? This may involve electronic interactions on the molecular scale and may be dependent on the relative orientation and site-selective stacking between donor and acceptor moieties. Beyond dipolar interactions, more recently quadrupolar electrostatic effects are also being discussed, which arise from the specific chemical structure of the nowadays very common A–D–A acceptor molecules.40–43 These exhibit in the center an electron-rich donor (D) unit, surrounded by two electron-deficient acceptor (A) end units, giving rise to a molecular quadrupole moment. Karuthedath et al. very recently suggested an interfacial energy level alignment based on such effects, which is at least locally in agreement with the dipole-based models mentioned above.40,42
Lange et al. have furthermore shown by Kelvin probe measurements that energy level alignments of organic semiconductors happen on top of conductive films largely depending on the work function of the lower layer and little on the film thickness of the organic semiconductor.44 As a reason for this behavior, the built-up of a charge transfer at the interface between the two layers was shown to yield Fermi-level equilibration.
In order to find a more general answer to which potential cases of energy level alignments may occur, certainly, donor–acceptor blends, as applied in bulk heterojunction OSCs, need to be investigated by methods sensitive to the density of (electronic) states (DOS). Hence, we applied energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ER-EIS) on various donor–acceptor combinations since it is capable of precisely determining the DOS for several orders of magnitude, not only for single materials but also for semiconductor blends.45–47 ER-EIS is specifically sensitive since it is based on the “transfer-resistance” from charge carriers at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, which is obtained from alternating-currents (AC) at appropriate frequency with a small voltage amplitude and, thus, these measurements are not diffusion limited.48,49
The charge transfer exciton (CTE) is known to be an intermediate state for the recombination of electrons located on the acceptor with holes from the donor. Thus, and as a direct consequence, it also controls the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs, displaying the upper limit for the same.50 Furthermore, the CTE has been discussed to resemble an intermediate state for photoinduced charge generation.51 In this regard, the energy levels for free-charge carriers, respectively, the energy split of the charge separated state (CSS), are generally considered to be larger than the energy gap of the CTE, since the latter includes coulombic contributions. However, in these pictures, local polaronic effects, which may bring about additional energy relaxation of the “free-charges” due to the polarization of their surroundings, are rarely – if at all – considered. In fact, it has been shown that charge carriers could be generated via direct excitation of the CTE (within the sub-bandgap region) with the same yield as above the donor bandgap.52,53 While this may not be generally valid for all donor–acceptor combinations,54 it may render the imagination of further energy barriers from the CTE to charge generation meaningless – at least for some cases. In other words, this raises the question about the energy level split between electrons and holes in CTEs in comparison to the electronic gap of the effective blend semiconductor.
Indications for polaronic (and not electronic) energy levels, respectively gaps, can be obtained from transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS),55–57 sensitive photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS),58 and quantum-chemical density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations.59Fig. 3 summarizes the supposedly involved energy levels for “free charge carrier” generation, hypothetically resulting in polarization-stabilized electrons and holes on the acceptor and donor, respectively. A remaining research question concerns the relative position of the energy levels of the latter with regard to the CTE, and thus, whether an energy barrier needs to be overcome or not. While disorder relaxation of free charge carriers within the DOS is commonly considered,44,60 local polarization effects as another form of energy relaxation (“self-trapping”) for free charge carriers are generally neglected. Calculations indicate that polarization-induced nuclear relaxations expressed by bond-length alteration should be well below 100 meV.59
 Fig. 3  Common understanding of the energy landscape at a donor–acceptor (D–A) heterojunction, including the optical (excitons), interfacial (charge transfer exciton), electronic (HOMO/LUMO), and various potential polaronic energy levels, respectively energy gaps. 
Since OSCs are generally based on the type II heterojunction of a donor and an acceptor, the term “effective semiconductor” has been introduced when considering only the energy levels responsible for the charge transport,61i.e., the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor (and associated charges). The energy difference between these two can also be regarded as the effective (electronic) bandgap. We show herein that the energetics of donor–acceptor heterojunction interfaces do not follow the expectation based on the experimentally determined energy levels of the individual materials. The expected bandgap denotes the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor that were determined individually for donor and acceptor materials – in line with the state-of-the-art. We now define the effective bandgap as the LUMOAcceptor–HOMODonor energy gap, which is actually being experimentally captured for the blend in bulk-heterojunctions. Herein, we report about cases in which the experimentally determined CT-state energy is in fact larger than the corresponding effective bandgap of the donor–acceptor blend, indicating the absence of an effective CT-exciton binding energy and thus free-charge generation without any energy barrier. Alongside with these investigations, various situations for the superposition of the DOS of the donor and acceptor were observed for the effective “LUMO” and “HOMO” of blends, which may require further studies for improved understanding in the future.47
Initially, our interest was triggered by the possibility to combine the model conjugated polymer, AnE-PVstat, with a novel non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), because this would largely extend the absorption range and thus give rise to an expected photocurrent and thus performance increase. Since at the time ITIC was one of the most often reported NFAs, enabling power conversion efficiencies above 10% and exhibiting an appropriate absorption range of up to about 800 nm,6–8 we chose the same for application in our tests. Unfortunately, the combination of AnE-PVstat:ITIC failed, and OSCs prepared from the same were strongly limited in photocurrent, which was related to insufficient generation and increased recombination of charges.62 Since the absorption of the ITIC covers large parts of the polymer emission spectrum,63 Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)64–66 could theoretically be part of the reason for a strong reduction in photocurrent; however, even for the photovoltaically successful archetypical blend of PBDB-T and ITIC, the polymer emission directly overlaps with ITIC absorption, nevertheless resulting in successful photocurrent generation. Hence, our search for reasons for the reduced performance of ITIC with AnE-PVstat was requiring a broader experimental approach to determine the difference from PBDB-T:ITIC blends67 and to identify the loss mechanism in more detail. In order to have a suitable basis of donor–acceptor combinations for reference and comparison, the reported blending partner for ITIC, PBDB-T, and another common conjugated polymer donor, PCDTBT,68 were included in our studies. We completed the set of acceptor materials by using the common PC60BM for AnE-PVstat and PC70BM for either PBDB-T or PCDTBT donors, providing sufficient reference to OSCs reported in the literature.69–72
For finding solid answers to the above raised questions about the true cause for the photovoltaic failure of AnE-PVstat:ITIC based OSCs, we conducted a broader analysis of the above mentioned single materials and blends thereof by the employment of a wide range of characterization techniques, covering the investigation of (a) photovoltaic performances, (b) (charge transfer) exciton binding energies, partially based on (c) further experimental determinations of molecular energy levels for pristine and blended materials, (d) charge generation and recombination dynamics, and (e) absolute and relative orientation of functional molecular sub-units.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals, solvents, and substrates were received from commercial suppliers or coworkers and were used as obtained, if not stated otherwise. Three different donor materials were used in this study: (i) a statistical copolymer with a random distribution of either linear octyloxy side chains or branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains on an anthracene-containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPE-PPV) backbone known as AnE-PVstat,69 (ii) the well-established carbazole- and benzothiadiazole-based conjugated polymer poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), and (iii) the relatively new high performance donor polymer for NFAs, i.e. poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T).
As acceptors, the well-known fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) were taken. The NFA 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) is based on a hepta-cyclic core, which has four hexylphenyl side-groups, and which is end-capped by 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) groups. It was chosen as it exhibits a sturdy and broad absorption, low-lying LUMO and HOMO energy levels, good electron transportability, and good miscibility with polymer donors.8 Three additional NFAs, derived from perylene diimide (PDI) dimers,73 were investigated. They are PDI2Ac2 (Pa2), DPP-(Ac-PDI)2 (DaP2),74–76 and a third with a thienoisoindigo (TII) core (TaP2).76,77 The chemical structures of all materials used for this study are depicted in Fig. 4 and Fig. S1 (ESI†).

Preparation of films and BHJ OSCs
Wherever discussed in this work, the thin films were prepared by the spin-coating technique and treated in the same way as active layers within the devices. For absorption spectroscopy, films were spin-coated on glass substrates without any interfacing layer; however, for Kelvin probe (KP) and ER-EIS measurements, films were spin-coated on ITO-glass (indium tin oxide) substrates. For the several NFA-materials, ZnO-modified ITO-glass substrates were used, as the electronic states of ZnO were more suitable for addressing the LUMO of the pristine NFA films.
All the OSC devices that are reported in this work were prepared with a conventional architecture. The fabrication of OSC devices began with cleaning the ITO-glass substrates in an ultrasonic bath, successively using acetone and isopropanol for 15 min. In order to get a conventional architecture, an aqueous dispersion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PH-formulation) was spin-coated onto the ITO at 3000 rpm to form the hole transporting layer (HTL). Subsequently, the substrates were annealed at 178 °C on top of a hot plate for 15 minutes for the removal of water residues from the films. Immediately thereafter, the warm samples were transferred into a nitrogen (N2) glovebox and were allowed to equilibrate with the ambient temperature. Active layer solutions were prepared based on higher-concentrated stock solutions, which then were mixed in appropriate ratios to yield the blend solutions (see details on the solutions in Table 1). These were cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS films to form the photoactive layer.

Then the films were introduced into a vacuum chamber for deposition of the back electrode. OSC devices were completed by the deposition of either magnesium (Mg, 50 nm, via physical vapor deposition (PVD)) or titanium oxide (TiOx, via solution processing) followed by aluminum (Al, 100 nm via PVD), or solely aluminum (via PVD). A shadow mask was utilized for the structured deposition of the electron collecting metal electrodes, defining the active area for each cell to 0.42 cm2. All OSC devices were sealed under glass with epoxy-based UV curing glue inside the glovebox. The OSC device layer stack structures for each investigated material combination are sketched in Fig. 5.

Characterization techniques

Cyclic voltammetry. 
To enable the matching of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor components, respectively, cyclic voltammetry (CV)23 was carried out to determine the ionization potential (∼HOMO) and electron affinity (∼LUMO) of the studied compounds. In particular, the onset potentials of the oxidation and reduction processes were determined with respect to the redox reference ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+, with a binding energy of EFc/Fc+ = 5.0 eV (below the vacuum level)),24 and the HOMO and LUMO levels were subsequently calculated according toEHOMO = −((EOx)onset + EFc/Fc+) eVELUMO = −((ERed)onset + EFc/Fc+) eVFor the CV measurements, a VMP3 potentiostat (Biologic, France) was used, applying a standard three-electrode setup (glassy-carbon disk working electrode (diameter 2 mm), AgNO3/Ag/CH3CN reference electrode, platinum wire counter electrode). The samples were prepared by dissolving ca. 1 mg mL−1 of the compound in chloroform (spectroscopic grade) containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 (TBAPF6) as conducting salt and deaerating the obtained solution via purging with argon prior to each measurement. The measurements were performed with an applied scan rate of 200 mV s−1.


Energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 
The density of states (DOS) was characterized by the recently introduced spectroscopic method, energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ER-EIS).45,49 The DOS function g(E) in the organic semiconductor is obtained by measuring the charge transfer resistance, Rct, of a semiconductor/electrolyte interface via the following relation:  EF,redox = eU is the electrochemical potential adjusted by the external voltage U, e is the elementary charge, ket is the charge-transfer rate constant, [A] is the concentration of the electrolyte redox (donor/acceptor) species in the interface region of the solid/liquid contact, and S is the sample area. The reciprocal value of Rct provides direct information about the electronic DOS at the energy adjusted with an external voltage.
The ER-EIS measurements were done in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere glove box employing a standard three-electrode configuration. The electrochemical cells (volume of 200 μL) were created by gluing plastic micro cylinders. The solution of 0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. The potential of the working electrode with respect to the reference Ag/AgCl electrode was controlled via a potentiostat, and a platinum (Pt) wire served as the counter electrode. The potential recorded with respect to the reference Ag/AgCl electrode can be recalculated to the local vacuum level assuming an Ag/AgCl energy vs. vacuum value of −4.66 eV. Impedance was measured with a impedance/gain-phase analyzer Solartron analytical model 1260. The frequency was set to 0.5 Hz, and the rms value of the AC voltage was 100 mV.


Photoluminescence, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. 
Thin-film steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an Avantes AvaSpec ULS-2048×64 fiber spectrometer. A simple laser diode, emitting at 405 nm, was used for optical excitation. In order to correct the PL-intensity for absorptance and to evaluate the optical band-gaps, thin-film transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) spectra were recorded with Avantes AvaSpec-(ULS)3648-USB2-UA-25 fiber spectrometers, yielding the absorptance A via the equation A = 1 − T − R.


Current–voltage characterization. 
Photovoltaic devices of conventional architecture were characterized in the dark and under AM1.5 illumination conditions. The current–voltage (IV) measurements were made with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source-Meter-Unit (SMU). The light intensity of the LED-solar simulator WaveLabs Sinus 70 was self-calibrated to yield AM1.5 conditions with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.


External quantum efficiency. 
For obtaining the spectral response of the solar cells, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a halogen white light bias yielding an excitation density of about one sun. The EQE of the solar cells was determined by first calibrating the instrument, Bentham PVE 300, with a silicon photodetector of known quantum efficiency. EQE recording was done using a lock-in technique at a frequency of about 184 Hz.


Sub-bandgap EQE. 
In order to conclude about the spectral response in the sub-bandgap region, sensitive EQE measurements were performed on the solar cell devices. The EQE sensitivity on average varied from 1.0 to 1 × 10−7 (see noise levels in relative EQE plots). The measurements were conducted with a 100 W quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp and a 300 mm-double monochromator, chopped at 417 Hz, measured with a Zurich HF2LI lock-in amplifier and a variable transimpedance-amplifier HF2TA (Zurich Instruments). Incoming light was simultaneously sensed with a silicon and an InGaAs photodiode. CT state analysis was done by fitting reduced Gaussian functions to the respective area within the sub-bandgap region. The interpretation of these spectra with a semi-classical Marcus model is currently under discussion, especially concerning the roles of static and dynamic disorder78 and emission out of the equilibrium.79 Urbach tails were fitted with a single-exponential function to the sub-bandgap tail and by calculating the local derivative numerically with gap energies from the intersection of the tail state and the maximum EQE signal in the gap region.


Electroluminescence characterization. 
Solar cells were further characterized by electroluminescence (EL) spectroscopy over a range of 330–1170 nm. To determine the EL spectrum of the solar cells, they were measured in a dark chamber while applying a constant forward current of 50 mA with a Keithley 2400 SMU, resulting in a current density of 120 mA cm−2. The emitted light was collected and transmitted via a fiber optic to a Si spectrometer. The Avantes spectrometer AvaSpec ULS2048×64 and the OEM-software were used to record the signal over an integration time of 10 s with two-fold averaging.


Transient absorption spectroscopy. 
Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy characterization was carried out with a home-built pump–probe setup.80 The output of the titanium:sapphire amplifier (Coherent LEGEND DUO, 4.5 mJ, 3 kHz, 100 fs) was split into three beams (2, 1, and 1.5 mJ). Two of them were used to separately pump two optical parametric amplifiers (OPA) (Light Conversion TOPAS Prime). The TOPAS 1 generated the pump pulses to excite the sample, while the TOPAS 2 generated the signal (1300 nm) and idler (2000 nm) only. The pathway length between the output of the TOPAS 1 and the sample was kept constant at approximately 5 m. The pump path distance was varied between 5.12 m and 2.6 m with a broadband retroreflector mounted on an automatic mechanical delay stage (Newport linear stage IMS600CCHA controlled by a Newport XPS motion controller), thereby generating delays among pump and probe from −400 ps to 8 ns. For measuring the TA in the whole visible range, 1300 nm (signal) of the TOPAS 2 was used to produce a white-light supercontinuum from 350 to 1100 nm. The transmitted segment of the white light was focused to a custom-made prism spectrograph (Entwicklungsbüro Stresing) where it was detached by a prism onto a 512-pixel NMOS linear image sensor (HAMAMATSU S8381-512). The reiteration rate of the probe pulse was 3 kHz, while the excitation pulses were mechanically chopped to 1.5 kHz (100 fs to 8 ns delay) while the detector array was read out at 3 kHz. Adjacent diode readings analogous to the transmission of the sample after excitation and in the absence of an excitation pulse were applied to calculate the ΔT/T ratio. The measurements were averaged over several thousand shots to obtain a valuable signal-to-noise ratio. A home-built Matlab code was used to modify the chirp induced by the transmissive optics. The delay at which pump and probe reach concurrently on the sample (i.e. zero time) was extracted from the point of the extreme positive slope of the TA signal rise for each wavelength.

Infrared transition moment orientational analysis
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy spectra were recorded in transmission mode with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1 by means of a Bio-Rad FTS 6000 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an UMA-500 infrared microscope and a liquid nitrogen-cooled Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) detector (Kolmar Technologies). In order to examine infrared transition moment orientational analysis (IR-TMOA) measurements, the collimated IR beam was transmitted through the sample film while a set of different polarizer positions φ were scanned, and a home-built tilting device kept the film fixed at a constant inclination ϑ (Fig. S79, ESI†). After one set of polarization angles were scanned through at one fixed inclination, the sample was tilted further to the next inclination angle, affecting the projection of the transition dipole moment onto the plane of polarization. Due to systematically scanning the IR absorption depending on the polarization and inclination, the tensor of absorption can be evaluated in 3-dimensional space, and the principal axes and principal values of absorption can be determined. A representative sketch of this measurement procedure is provided in Fig. S79 (in the ESI†). A detailed description and applications can be found in the ESI† and literature.81–84

Electron spin resonance. 
The X-band light-induced ESR (LESR) spectra were recorded with a CW Bruker spectrometer ELEXYS E500 (9.4 GHz) and a 150 W Xe-lamp for illumination. An optical transmission resonator, ER 4104OR (Bruker BioSpin), provided a simple pathway for the Xe-lamp light (at about 30 mW cm−2). All LESR measurements were performed at a temperature of 77 K. The LESR experiments were conducted in solutions and solid films.


Optically detected magnetic resonance. 
Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements were performed with a modified ESR spectrometer (Bruker). The samples were placed in a resonant cavity (Bruker ER4104OR) equipped with a helium cryostat (Oxford ESR 900) and cooled to T = 5 K. Excitation was provided by a 473 nm laser that can excite all of the investigated materials. The resulting PL was collected with a Si photodiode behind a long pass filter to block residual excitation light. The detector current was pre-amplified (Femto) and directed to a lock-in amplifier (Ametek 7230), which was referenced by kHz on–off modulation of the amplified (Microsemi) 9.4 GHz microwaves (Windfreak).


Density functional theory. 
The experimental methods were accompanied by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) on dimers. In order to keep the computational effort low, these calculations were done without the side-chains but including the full conjugated π-systems. In principle, it is questionable whether DFT can be used to determine ionization potentials and electron affinities since, e.g., Koopmans’ theorem25 is not valid. However, for hybrid functionals, Janak's theorem85 may substitute it. We performed the DFT calculations of donor–acceptor complexes with the hybrid functional HSE0686 and the Gaussian basis set 6-311G(2d,p). For all calculations, we applied the quantum-chemical calculation package Gaussian1687 and visualized the results by using GausView 6.45

Results and discussion
The results section is organized with regard to our quest for gaining understanding concerning the origin of performance limitations and is subdivided according to characterization methods. Initially, photovoltaic properties will be reported and reassessed, followed by more advanced characterization methods for the determination of molecular energy levels. The latter include, e.g., the CTE of blends as well as the electrochemical, electronic, and optical energy gaps of single materials. Next, the charge generation and recombination are assessed on the basis of several distinct methods, namely electron spin resonance (ESR), optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS or TA). For a better understanding of morphological factors contributing to the observed effects, the results on molecular orientation obtained from infrared transmission moment orientational analysis (IR-TMOA) are presented in the final section. A discussion about the energy landscape at the heterojunction summarizes the acquired understanding.
Photovoltaic characterization and determination of the charge transfer exciton

Dark and illuminated current–voltage characteristics. 
Organic solar cell (OSC) devices based on the three polymer donor materials AnE-PVstat, PBDB-T, and PCDTBT were prepared according to the information given in the experimental section in combination with either ITIC or PC60BM (AnE-PVstat) or PC70BM (PBDB-T and PCDTBT) as molecular acceptors. Here, OSC devices prepared with the fullerene derivatives serve as a reference. Basic photovoltaic characterization was performed for these devices and is summarized within this section.

Fig. 6 summarizes the dark and illuminated (under one sun equivalent solar simulator) JV characteristics of typical representatives for each blend system, in both logarithmic and linear depiction. While the archetypical blending partner for ITIC is PBDB-T, OSC devices performed comparably well with either ITIC or PC70BM. In contrast, PCDTBT and AnE-PVstat based OSC devices gave a much lower power conversion efficiency in combination with ITIC than with fullerene derivatives. This loss can be clearly assigned to slightly reduced open-circuit voltages and strongly reduced photocurrents, which were about one order of magnitude more severe for devices based on AnE-PVstat as compared to those devices using PCDTBT. Specifically, devices using AnE-PVstat in combination with ITIC, but also with other non-fullerene acceptors based on perylenes (see Fig. S3, ESI†), had rather symmetric IV characteristics in the dark, showing no signs of diode behavior anymore. The extracted photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2 for further reference.

External quantum efficiency and electroluminescence. 
In order to obtain the spectral response of the OSCs, lock-in AC EQE spectra were recorded under white bias light illumination with an intensity corresponding to about one sun. The analysis of these curves provided similar but somewhat reduced photocurrents in comparison to the IV characteristics and confirmed the major losses to originate from the lack of photocurrents (compare with Fig. 7). Furthermore, by recording the electroluminescence (EL), the reciprocal process was investigated for the same devices but also for single material diodes. From the EL, charge transfer exciton emission peaks were obtained for blends. Note that the EL spectra of blends may contain information about phase percolation of single materials, in case the EL-signature of pristine materials shows up in them.88 The latter may be possible when there is a direct connection between both injecting electrodes through a single material phase. However, in case of a very minor energy difference between the CT state and a single material exciton, emission from the latter might also be observed. Therefore, for PBDB-T:ITIC and PCDTBT:ITIC blends, the observation of the seemingly ITIC electroluminescence could originate either from phase percolation or from low-offset with the CT-energy. However, it is hardly detectable for AnE-PVstat:ITIC – where CTE emission dominates. On the other hand, AnE-PVstat:PC60BM exhibits a very clear signature of the polymer phase emission, proving its percolation. Percolation of a single material phase displays an indication for sufficiently coarse-grained pristine domains (which are observable via photoluminescence), enabling and supporting charge extraction under photovoltaic operation.89,90
 Fig. 7  EQE (top row) as well as EL spectra (bottom row) for the photovoltaic devices – and in the case of EL also for single material devices. The EL-spectra of blends were analyzed for new peaks (note the arrows), originating from CTE emission. 

Table 3 summarizes the roughly determined CTE emission peak positions, which display a lower limit for the energy gap of the CTE. In fact, experimentally determined and computationally confirmed EL spectra generally do not correspond to energy-relaxed situations79 and may severely differ from simple Gaussian distributions.28 Additional analysis on CTE-energies will be presented in the following section based on highly sensitive sub-bandgap EQE.

Sub-bandgap EQE. 
To gain deeper insight into the CTE formed at the donor–acceptor interface, the sub-bandgap region of the EQE spectra was investigated with a monochromatic light source and lock-in photocurrent measurement (double monochromator). Fig. 8 displays the EQE spectra of the investigated OSCs recorded over the spectral region between 1.0 and 2.4 eV. The CTE transition and reorganization (λCT) energies were extracted for blends with PCBM by fitting a reduced Gaussian function to the lower energy edge of the EQE-spectrum, which appears as a parabolic function in the logarithmic depiction.91 Note that according to the underlying model, ECTE equals the peak of the Gaussian minus the reorganization energy λCT, yielding the 0–0 transition of the CTE.
 Fig. 8  Highly sensitive EQE spectra of all investigated solar cells. All blends containing fullerene derivatives clearly show the characteristics of a CTE (left), whereas for the ITIC-based blends only an Urbach tail could be detected, but no sign of a CTE (right). 
Intriguingly, while all blends with fullerene derivatives exhibited clearly a sub-bandgap peak, none of the ITIC-based blends yielded the same but they only showed an exponential decay (exponential distribution of sub-bandgap states) known as the Urbach tail. Urbach energies were for all blends around 30 meV, where the PBDB-T-based blend yielded the lowest of only 28.3 meV. The Urbach energy (EU) is mainly governed by structural disorder, and hence a lower value indicates a higher order of the material exhibiting the lower bandgap. It is observable below the absorption band edge, which is corresponding to the bandgap energy EG, which is determined from the cross-section of an Urbach tangent and a tangent to the above-gap EQE curve. Extracted values for the EU and the bandgap EG from the relative EQE vs. energy are shown in the legend. The extracted values for CTE and Urbach energies are summarized in Table 4. This and an alternative fitting routine as well as an overview of evaluated CTE and reorganization energies are shown in Section S9, ESI.†

In general, both effects can principally occur at the same time, namely a Gaussian absorption profile due to the CTE and an Urbach tail due to energetic disorder.92 However, it might be possible to mathematically compensate an exponential term by an increased reorganization energy. While its occurrence is generally neglected by similar studies in the field, Urbach distributions (proportional to exp93)93 should dominate deeper into the subgap region due to their lower steepness compared to Gaussian tails (proportional to exp{−E2}). Ultimately, setup sensitivity might be too low to follow that below the CTE signature properly.


Absorption and photoluminescence. 
In order to complement the information about the charge transfer exciton, pristine material and blend films corresponding to the OSC active layers were investigated for their optical absorption and emission. Furthermore, the single materials’ absorption data can be used to determine the optical bandgap, which corresponds to the excitation of a coulombically bound exciton in such organic semiconductors. The experimental results are depicted in Fig. 9, where the upper row contains the absorptance (A) and the lower row the absorptance-corrected photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By comparing the absorption data, which were obtained from transmittance and reflectance measurements (A = 1 − T − R), ITIC revealed the lowest bandgap. Thus it is common for all blends that donor polymer emission (or Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET) may potentially result in ITIC excitation. The difference in the long-wavelength range absorption for ITIC depicted in Fig. 9a originates from a more rough film due to processing from a solvent mixture of chloroform and chlorobenzene. For all materials, the optical bandgap was derived by evaluating the onset of absorption. Since the lowest excitations of organic semiconductors are generally excitons, i.e., bound electron–hole pairs, the optical bandgap is also the excitonic bandgap.
 Fig. 9  Absorptance (top row) as well as PL spectra (bottom row) of pristine materials and photovoltaic blends. The PL-spectra of blends were analyzed for new peaks (note the arrows), originating from CTE emission. 
Besides, for the PCDTBT:ITIC blend, where a substantially large ITIC emission is observed, there are no indications for a potential energy transfer anywhere else since the PL of the blend was generally strongly quenched as compared to that of the pristine constituents of the same. The PL data were analyzed for new transitions in the lower energy branch. In several cases, emission from pristine phases was subtracted in order to get a more well-defined peak of the CTE-emission (compare with Fig. S65–S67, ESI†). All such or directly obtained CTE-PL emission peaks are summarized in Table 5 for further reference and also do serve as a lower limit for the CTE transition energy. Note that the PBDB-T:ITIC emission at 1.59 eV is extremely weak and most probably originates from the ITIC alone and thus is not being considered as a CT-emission.

Based on the optical and optoelectronic characterization, various data about the energy of the CT states were obtained, whereas as already stated before, CTE-emission peaks generally serve as lower limits only. This information is summarized in Table 6, leading to the consolidated CT-energy as an exact or approximate value for the 0–0 transition of the CT state. It is noteworthy that in several cases, an unexpectedly good agreement between the different methods was obtained. Please note that for PBDB-T:ITIC several reports obtained a CT-state energy from sub-bandgap EQE of 1.50 eV in agreement with each other.6,94,95

Density functional theory
We have applied density functional theory (DFT) as described above on two conformers of pristine ITIC in order to determine the shapes and energies of the frontier orbitals, i.e., the HOMO and LUMO, for the optimized ground state structures (see Fig. S77, ESI†). We found the expected π- and π*-orbitals of a molecule with conjugated double-bonds for the HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The calculated molecular orbital energies are ELUMO = −3.37 eV and EHOMO = −5.48 eV.
As a representative of the semicrystalline AnE-PVstat copolymer, we calculated a PV-AnE-PV oligomer without side-chains, not only to reduce the computational effort but also for the arbitrariness in sidechain substitution in the case of AnE-PVstat.96 As long as neither π–π stacking nor extreme torques of the backbone due to entangled sidechains occurs,97 the influence of various sidechain substitution schemes on the electronic energetics of the conjugated backbone is commonly minor. Nevertheless, to count for the torsional disorder of the AnE-PVstat copolymer, we built an oligomer with two different conformations of the PV-chains to the left and the right of the AnE-unit, respectively. As expected, we find the typical π- and π*-orbitals for a conjugated copolymer with a weak push–pull effect97 (see Fig. S78, ESI†). The respective energies of the PV-AnE-PV oligomer are ELUMO = −2.72 eV and EHOMO = −4.46 eV.
We used our structurally optimized PV-AnE-PV and ITIC molecules to model a typical donor–acceptor complex/dimer within the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend. Thereby, we assumed that a π–π interaction between the end-groups of ITIC and the anthracene unit in the copolymer is constitutive for the formation of the complex, whereas the PV-units of the copolymer as well as the core of ITIC are screened by the extended alkyl-sidechains. Surprisingly, not only the LUMO of the PV-AnE-PV:ITIC complex (−3.52 eV) is lower in energy than the LUMO of the neat ITIC, but also the HOMO of the complex (−4.59 eV) is lower than the HOMO of the neat PV-AnE-PV oligomer. Notably, the shapes of both frontier orbitals (Fig. 10) are not very distinct from the corresponding HOMO of the neat donor (Fig. S78 bottom, ESI†) and the corresponding LUMO of the neat acceptor (cf. Fig. S77 top, ESI†), respectively.
 Fig. 10  Frontier molecular orbitals for a model PV-AnE-PV:ITIC complex/dimer displayed as isosurface for |ψMO| = 0.02 with their energies as calculated by DFT using the hybrid functional HSE06 and the Gaussian basis-set 6-311G(2d,p). 
From the calculated energy differences between the frontier-orbitals of the donor–acceptor complex and the corresponding ones of the neat donor (HOMO) and acceptor (LUMO), we may conclude that holes in the donor phase are repulsed from the donor–acceptor junctions. However, a ground state DFT calculation does not consider the coulombic interaction between electrons and holes, which gives rise to the formation of a charge-transfer exciton (CTE), i.e., a bound electron–hole pair at the donor–acceptor junction. Potentially that charge-transfer-exciton may thus result in somewhat modified energy levels at the heterojunction.
Molecular energy levels by cyclic voltammetry
Further analysis of the molecular energy levels (HOMOs and LUMOs) indicates the type of heterojunction formed between the herein discussed donor and acceptor pairs and thus may potentially shed more light on the possible charge generation limitations. In fact, the qualification of organic semiconductor donor–acceptor pairs for photovoltaic applications is commonly derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Hence all organic semiconductors used in this study were subjected to such analysis in solution, and their HOMO and LUMO levels were derived from the oxidation and reduction onsets, respectively. The recorded data for all investigated materials are shown in Fig. S5–S10 in the ESI.†Table 7 summarizes those CV redox potentials and the electrochemical bandgaps, EG,EC, for all pristine materials of this study.

The expected bandgaps for photovoltaic blends were derived from the difference between the oxidation onset (∼HOMO) of the donors and the reduction onset (∼LUMO) of the acceptors, where the corresponding differences to the peak values were added separately (shown in brackets). These amount to the following values: AnE-PVstat:PC60BM 1.33 (+0.35) eV; AnE-PVstat:ITIC 1.27 (+0.30) eV; PBDB-T:PC70BM 1.42 (+0.58) eV; PBDB-T:ITIC 1.36 (+0.57) eV; PCDTBT:PC70BM 1.23 (+0.36) eV; and PCDTBT:ITIC 1.17 (+0.31) eV. The onset-based molecular energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Fig. 11. The fact that (i) PBDB-T devices with LUMODonor to LUMOAcceptor offsets of 230 and 290 meV do work well with both types of acceptors, and (ii) that the LUMO offsets for AnE-PVstat and PCDTBT are even higher by 40 and 150 meV, respectively, shows that CV (and more specifically measured in solution) does not provide any insight into why charge generation should be hampered for the latter two donors (AnE-PVstat and PCDTBT) in combination with ITIC. The same is true, if not onset but rather peak values are considered. Clearly, more sophisticated characterization tools are therefore required to understand the unexpectedly low performance for the same.

Energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Since potential ground-state interactions may alter the relative position of molecular energy levels within bulk-heterojunction blend films, it is necessary to use a method by which the individual materials and their photovoltaic blends can be characterized the same way. Energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ER-EIS) constitutes a more sophisticated electrochemical characterization method than CV. It allows one to investigate films as used in photoactive layers of organic solar cells if deposited on top of conductive substrates. By using ER-EIS, it has been already demonstrated that valuable information about the DOS for films of pristine and blended organic semiconductors could be obtained.47,98–100 The DOS is obtained via slow quasi-static recording of the transfer resistance between the organic semiconductor and the electrolyte. The peculiarity of the ER-EIS measurement, conducted in a three-electrode geometry, is an AC-operation, which prevents charging effects and results in a specifically high sensitivity so that the DOS can be obtained over several orders of magnitude.48,49 Commonly the linear onsets of such signals are interpreted as the respective band edges – or in other words, onsets of HOMO (ionization potential ∼ IP) and LUMO (electron affinity ∼ EA) energy levels. Experimentally we have found that these onsets generally correspond well with a more reproducibly obtained logarithmically halved depth of bandgaps (i.e., where the logarithmic DOS value is half of the near-edge maximum), and hence we decided to use the latter to determine the HOMO and LUMO onsets. To provide one example, if the DOS at the near-edge peak has a value of 104 higher than within the bandgap, then the logarithmic half value is taken at a DOS with 102, or 1% of the peak value. This value is not to be mixed up though with the mobility or transport edge, which defines the onset of band-like transport of charges.101,102
For comparison and evaluation of the ER-EIS DOS data, we here define two more termini technici: the expected bandgap, Eg,exp, simply corresponds to the energy difference between the HOMO onset of the donor and the LUMO onset of the acceptor, as determined individually for the pristine materials. In contrast, the effective bandgap, Eg,eff, corresponds to the energy gap for the donor–acceptor blend in a bulk-heterojunction active layer configuration. The effective bandgap thus is the experimentally determined energy difference between the onsets of HOMO and LUMO levels in blends. Such information could not be obtained from simple CV on single materials and hence demonstrates the superiority and usefulness of the applied ER-EIS method. As the first case, the ER-EIS results for AnE-PVstat in combination with either PC60BM or ITIC are presented in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  ER-EIS data on the density of (electronic) states (DOS) (a) and (c) and the resulting energy landscapes (b) and (d) of AnE-PVstat, PC60BM, and ITIC, and their blend films. The dotted vertical lines depict HOMO/LUMO values, and the calculated energy gaps are shown in the legend (a) and c). Energy gaps for single materials and the blends are shown in (b) and (d). 
At first, one may note that while AnE-PVstat and PC60BM have very well-defined electronic gaps with at least four orders of magnitude difference in the DOS between electronic bands and the bandgap states, the same shows for ITIC only 1–2 orders of magnitude difference. Nevertheless, for the blend films in both cases, more than 4 orders of magnitude difference in DOS are obtained. While the left row (Fig. 12(a) and (c)) displays the measurement data, the right row (Fig. 12(b) and (d)) shows the evaluated band edges and thus energy landscapes. Interestingly, AnE-PVstat:PC60BM exhibits with 1.12 eV an effective bandgap considerably lower than the 1.39 eV of the expected bandgap. For the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend the situation is reversed: here the effective bandgap surpasses the expected bandgap by 460 meV. Both effects could neither be derived from (our) CV data nor be explained by the ICT model. While the latter may provide an explanation for a rise in the blend's LUMO level, it does not consider band gap widening or shrinking. Thus ER-EIS allows accessing information that remains undetected otherwise. In fact the evaluated LUMO of the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend seems to be a hybridization of the individual LUMO levels, indicating stronger interaction between the two constituents.
 Fig. 13  ER-EIS data on the density of (electronic) states (DOS) (a) and (c) and the resulting energy landscapes (b) and d) of PBDB-T, PC70BM, and ITIC, and their blend films. The dotted vertical lines depict HOMO/LUMO values, and the calculated energy gaps are shown in the legend (a) and (c). Energy gaps for single materials and the blends are shown in (b) and (d). 
Another peculiarity for ITIC is found: the special spectral feature having the shape of a Fano resonance (FR) being clearly visible at about −4.30 eV for the pristine film has completely vanished for the blend film. According to the definition, Fano resonances are the product of an interaction between an isolated electronic state and a continuum of states. In this case, there could be an interaction taking place between ITIC and the ZnO-conduction band, which served as a charge transport interlayer on top of ITO, on which the acceptor ITIC was investigated (see for comparison Fig. S31 and S32 in the ESI†).
Indeed, on bare ITO-substrates the conduction band started at −3 eV, and no such resonance was observed. This supports the assumption that an interaction between the continuum states of the substrate would interact with some (isolated) molecular energy level and that the electronic states probed with ER-EIS are conductive throughout the investigated films, since the charge is balanced at the electrolyte–film interface. We speculate at this point that this isolated ITIC energy state corresponds to a π–π stacking overlap of the acceptor-like indanone end-groups.103
Moving on to the next donor material, PBDB-T, reveals a similar depth in the DOS distribution as for ITIC (see Fig. 13), namely only two orders of magnitude difference between peak values of the bands and the region within the bandgap. Interestingly, for donor–acceptor bulk heterojunctions with PC70BM and ITIC, the effective bandgap is considerably larger than the expected bandgap in both cases: 290 and 340 meV for PC70BM and ITIC, respectively. But in this case and in contrast to AnE-PVstat, the Fano-resonance remains visible at the same binding energy for the PBDB-T:ITIC blend, which clearly indicates a conductive path for this molecular orbital and thus for the electron transport on the ITIC itself throughout the photoactive layer.
For the case of PCDTBT as the donor material (see Fig. 14), a similar behavior is found as for PBDB-T: blends with both acceptors, PC70BM and ITIC, lead to an increase of the effective bandgap over the expected one by 430 and 350 meV, respectively. Also, here the FR of ITIC remains visible in the blend; however, here, it is shifted from ∼−4.3 eV to a somewhat lower binding energy of −4.0 eV. The formation of an interfacial dipole seems indeed most plausible to explain that upshift, which has already been discussed in the framework of the ICT-model. Again, this indicates a conductive path for this molecular orbital of ITIC throughout the photoactive layer as well as an upshift of the acceptor EA to smaller binding energies in the blend. In addition, a very peculiar observation is made: not only the transport gap for the PCDTBT:ITIC blend is identical to that of PCDTBT alone, but also the energy levels coincide very well. In fact, the same upshift that was seen for the Fano resonance energy level appears to be valid for the HOMO of ITIC too, resulting in a superposition of both HOMOs at the same energy. Since the Fano resonance energy level was not considered as the LUMO of the blend so far, the question may be raised, by what extent the Fano-resonance ITIC-molecular energy level (which may also be understood as Fano-resonance electron affinity (FR-EA)) may be responsible for charge generation and extraction under photovoltaic operation? Thus, ER-EIS analysis indicates that the ITIC HOMO level does coincide with that of PCDTBT, whereas the ITIC Fano resonance remains below the LUMO level of the polymer, indicating that the blend does at least contain in part a type I heterojunction character. The latter is in agreement with the somewhat increased ITIC-photoluminescence observed and shown in Fig. 9f. On the other hand, the ITIC-orbital associated with the FR (FR-EA) may provide some type II heterojunction character and may serve to support the evidence of partial photovoltaic operation (see Fig. 6f) in the case of PCDTBT and in contrast to AnE-PVstat:ITIC. A similar consequence follows for the PBDB-T:ITIC blend, when considering the FR-EA as a pathway for charge generation.
 Fig. 14  ER-EIS data on the density of (electronic) states (DOS) (a) and (c) and the resulting energy landscapes (b) and (d) of PCDTBT, PC70BM, and ITIC, and their blend films. The dotted vertical lines depict HOMO/LUMO values, and the calculated energy gaps are shown in the legend (a) and (c). Energy gaps for single materials and the blends are shown in (b) and (d). 
It is important to note here that ER-EIS revealed that effective bandgaps generally differ strongly from the expected bandgaps, if only the energy levels of the individual materials are taken into account. Specifically, this originates from the fact that the simple arithmetic sum of the DOS from both constituents from which the blends are formed generally does not resemble the DOS of the blend themselves. This is explicitly shown in Fig. S40 as well as summarized in Tables S7 and S8 in the ESI.†
Charge generation and recombination processes
In this section, charge generation and recombination for the two photovoltaic blend couples of AnE-PVstat:PC60BM and AnE-PVstat:ITIC are explored by a number of established characterization techniques in order to elucidate distinct differences and to find a suitable explanation for the insufficient performance of the latter of the two. So far, it became evident that the main limitation of the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend is connected to minimal charge generation (see, e.g., IV and EQE above as well as TDCF62). Hence a confirmation by more fundamental techniques like electron spin resonance (ESR), optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), and transient absorption (TA) was pursued.
Electron spin resonance
Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a valuable technique for the detection of unpaired charge carriers that carry a spin, so-called polarons, or alternatively, anion/cation radicals. The signal is proportional to the number of spins and thus quantitatively useful. Previous to the analysis of the blends, the individual materials, AnE-PVstat, PC60BM, and ITIC, were investigated as single species in frozen solutions (≤100 K) and in films. The corresponding data can be viewed in Fig. S71 and S72 in the ESI.† Basically, AnE-PVstat did yield a strong response only for the frozen solution under illumination with a xenon lamp, whereas PC60BM additionally exhibited a somewhat weaker signal for the illuminated film. ITIC demonstrates a noticeable light-induced response in frozen solution but not in the film. The presence of such an ESR signal for pristine organic semiconductors indicates the presence of trap states, and thus no signal is not a failure.
Next, blend solutions and blend films were subjected to the same characterization, either in the dark or under xenon-lamp illumination (see Fig. 15). Both AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blend solutions and films yielded a substantial light-induced response. However, in films the signal of the cation radical of the polymer appeared to be much weaker than that of the corresponding anion radical of PC60BM. In fact, high charge carrier densities in polymer domains are known to induce bipolaron formation at low temperatures,104 and since such spin-coupled positive polarons are diamagnetic, they cannot be detected with ESR. Hence the disappearance of the light-induced positive polaron signal may be attributed to bipolaron formation,105 which may be further enhanced by the relatively high crystallinity of AnE-PVstat in blends with PCBM. The coupling energy between positive charges is in the range of μeV to a few meV. This energetic shift would not influence TA spectra, as TA would still be able to detect positive polarons, even though a low energy bipolaron coupling is present that inhibits detection by ESR.
 Fig. 15  X-Band LESR spectra of (a) AnE-PVstat:PC60BM, (b) AnE-PVstat:ITIC blends in the frozen liquid solution and solid film state recorded at 77 K temperature. Spectral components’ assignment and magnitude of isotropic g01-factor evaluation for the positive polaron (AnE-PVstat P+˙) and known isotropic g02 of the PCBM anion radical are introduced in the figures. The AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blend shows radical formation in the donor and acceptor upon illumination. However, the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend does not indicate any hints of an ITIC anion radical formation upon illumination in solid film. However, the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend shows the above light-induced response only in frozen solution. 
For AnE-PVstat:ITIC, the picture was found to be much different between the frozen solution and the solid film: in this case a weak signal of cation radicals was found for the polymer in the dark blend solution and a strong one for the illuminated case. However, no signal could be detected from any negative polarons residing on ITIC. In the case of the film, there was no polaron detectable from either of the two materials. Thus, an absence of the LESR signal in the film clearly confirmed the previously obtained result of insignificant photocurrent generation.
The AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend shows the same light response in frozen solution with a visible AnE-PVstat cation signal; however, no ITIC ion radical spectra are directly observed. Because the g-factor components of the ITIC anion radical106 are rather close to those of the AnE-PVstat polaron, it seems that both spectra cannot be properly resolved in X-band ESR experiments. However, the signal strength of the radical cation indicates the presence of a radical anion on the ITIC – at least for the frozen solution.
Optically detected magnetic resonance
To identify potential loss mechanisms involving triplet excitons, ODMR107–109 measurements were conducted with pristine AnE-PVstat, PC60BM, and ITIC, as well as AnE-PVstat:PC60BM and AnE-PVstat:ITIC blends. Fig. 16 shows the ODMR spectra of all pristine materials and blends. All spectra contain signatures that can be assigned to triplet excitons localized on the donor and/or acceptor. The pristine materials’ spectra can be regarded as “fingerprints” of the wave function of the probed triplet exciton and are specific for each material in dependence on the applied magnetic field. This facilitates the assignment of the superimposed triplet spectra for blends to the individual contributions. The triplet signature of AnE-PVstat is typical for a polymer triplet with a 100 mT broad wing-like spectrum centered around a sharp peak that often is referred to as the polaron pair peak and is a superposition of several effects, including weakly interacting spin 1/2 charge carriers (distant triplets) and charge carriers interacting with excitons. Most organic semiconductors show this peak in ODMR, and we disregard it for the following discussion of the blends’ triplet spectra.
 Fig. 16  ODMR spectra of pristine and blended materials. In all cases, triplet excitons can be detected. The triplet spectra of the pristine materials are specific signatures for the respective material. All spectra are wide and symmetric around a sharp central peak. At half the magnetic field, an additional transition is observed. In the blends, triplets localized on the polymer AnE-PVstat can be detected as indicated by the red frames. In the blend with ITIC, additional ITIC triplets are generated (purple frame), while no PC60BM triplets are detected in the fullerene-containing blend. 
To distinguish between different triplets, both the shape of the wide spectral feature centered around B = 335 mT and the additional transition at half the magnetic field (160–170 mT) are to be compared. At full magnetic field the broad spectral features are similar and not well resolved for AnE-PVstat and ITIC, whereas the signal is narrower (20 mT) and more intense for PC60BM, making it easily distinguishable from the other two.93 The half-field transitions of the pristine materials appear significantly different from one another. For AnE-PVstat the half-field transition is a triangular peak with a slope to the right side, while it is more symmetric for ITIC. For PC60BM a sharp peak at the slightly higher magnetic field can be observed. In the blend of AnE-PVstat with PC60BM exclusively the signature of a triplet localized on the polymer can be recognized. In the blend with ITIC however, the wide spectral feature does not reveal whether only polymer triplets or ITIC triplets also are involved. The half-field transition, on the other hand, provides a clear indication that in addition to the polymer triplet, ITIC triplets are generated in this blend upon illumination.
As the triplet energy of AnE-PVstat (assumed to be around 1.4 eV) is smaller than that for PC60BM (1.6–1.7 eV according to the literature),93 only triplets on the polymer will be formed. As described above, the CT state of the blend itself is located around 1.4–1.5 eV. Hence no triplets will be populated on PC60BM due to its higher energy. AnE-PVstat:ITIC blends can yield a charge transfer for energies higher than 1.66 eV. It is clear that the triplet state energy of ITIC will be lower than that and thus could be populated viaITIC itself. Furthermore, a possible CT state will have an energy of above 1.5 eV (compare with CTE-PL and CTE-EL data above), which would be again higher in energy than the polymer triplet state. Thus, it can be concluded that due to the differences of the acceptor bandgap in the two blend systems, the triplet states of PC60BM are not populated, whereas the triplet states of ITIC at 1.2–1.4 eV are accessible94 (see Fig. S76, ESI,† for a Jablonski diagram of these processes). In the following section, the application of TAS will help to identify the fraction of photo-excitations that may lead to triplet recombination losses.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
To reveal the charge generation and recombination dynamics in AnE-PVstat:ITIC and AnE-PVstat:PC60BM thin film BHJs, ultrafast transient absorption (TA)110 spectroscopy was performed. Fig. 17(a and b) shows picosecond–nanosecond (ps–ns) TA spectra and dynamics of selected spectral regions of AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend films measured after photoexcitation at 490 nm, where primarily the donor polymer absorbs. Positive ΔT/T regions correspond to transient photobleaching (PB), while negative ΔT/T values indicate photoinduced absorption (PA). The PB band peaking at 2.1 eV (Fig. 17a) corresponds to the PB of the donor polymer, AnE-PVstat, while the shoulder observed around 1.8–2.0 eV was assigned to the PB of ITIC, based on the comparison of the TA spectra of the blend with those of neat polymer and neat ITIC films, also shown in Fig. 17a. We note that the main ITIC bleach band expected around 1.6–1.7 eV is superimposed by the strong PA in the polymer:ITIC blend and thus is not clearly discernible. We assigned the broad PA to charge carrier-induced absorption, precisely to the excited state absorption of ITIC acceptor anions peaking in the region 1.2–1.3 eV and AnE-PVstat cations, respectively. For the polymer cation, the assignment is based on the comparison of the blend's TA spectra with TA spectra obtained for similar AnE-PV-type donor polymer:fullerene blends reported earlier111 by us and the TA spectra obtained for fullerene based blends reported in this work (vide supra). For the ITIC anion, the assignment is based on the anion-induced absorption spectrum of ITIC obtained for CuSCN:ITIC films (see also Fig. 17a).

(b) TA signal dynamics probed in the region of the blend's photobleach (2.05–2.4 eV) for a fluence of 10 μJ cm−2.

(c) ps–ns TA spectra of AnE-PVstat:PC60BM for a fluence of 10 μJ cm−2. Note the spectral changes (indicated by arrows) caused by exciton dissociation. (d) ns–μs dynamics of PB of the AnE-PVstat:PC60BM thin film blend measured at different fluences after excitation at 532 nm. 

Fig. 17b shows the excited state (exciton) dynamics obtained on neat donor polymer and ITIC acceptor films and the dynamics observed in the ITIC-based blend monitored at the PB region for different initial pump fluences. Clearly, the dynamics of the blend are different from that of the neat films: longer-lived states are observed in the blend, and their dynamics are virtually fluence independent, indicating geminate recombination112 of interfacial charge transfer states We fitted the decay dynamics of CT state excitons to a mono-exponential decay and obtained average inverse decay rates of 242 ps, as indicated in Fig. 17b.
In fact, this sub-ns fast geminate recombination is most likely the origin of the poor performance of AnE-PVstat:ITIC OSCs, since a substantial fraction (∼80%) of the initial charge carrier population has decayed within 1 ns and thus does not contribute to the device photocurrent. ps–ns TA measurements on AnE-PVstat:ITIC blends were also performed upon photoexcitation of the ITIC acceptor at 700 nm (Fig. S74, ESI†). Very similar TA spectra and dynamics were obtained for AnE-PVstat:ITIC, showing that hole transfer from ITIC to AnE-PVstat is ultrafast and confirming that fluence-independent geminate recombination of interfacial CT states dominates after exciton dissociation and charge transfer.
In contrast, the ps–ns TA spectra of AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blends shown in Fig. 17c indicate a combination of ultrafast and diffusion-limited charge generation, which concludes in about 100 ps. Thereafter, no further spectral evolution was observed, and the TA signal decayed steadily. However, its decay was extending beyond the time range of our ps–ns TA setup. Hence, we probed fluence-dependent dynamics in the AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blend by nanosecond–microsecond (ns–μs) TA spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. 17d. The obvious fluence dependence of carrier recombination in this system in the ns–μs time window is in stark contrast to the processes observed in the ITIC-based blend. It exposes non-geminate recombination of free charges, in turn explaining the significantly higher device performance. Here, we did not analyze the fluence-dependent TA dynamics further and instead referred to our earlier work on similar donor polymer:fullerene blends.111
Infrared transition moment orientational analysis
Infrared transition moment orientational analysis (IR-TMOA) was employed for the first time to study organic bulk heterojunctions. On the one hand, the specificity of absorption in the IR spectral range enables one to identify absorption peaks arising from the interaction of distinct submolecular moieties with the electric field of the incident light. On the other hand, through a systematic variation of the IR light's polarization in addition to the film's inclination the orientation and order of the vectors of the transition moments (TMs), being related to the orientation of the molecules, can be determined. Thus, IR-TMOA allows for separating between absorption signals arising from sub-molecular parts within the donor and acceptor molecules, and deducing their orientation and order independently with respect to the substrate plane and hence also relative to each other.81–83
The results from IR-TMAO are schematically depicted in Fig. 18. In the case of AnE-PVstat:ITIC, a TM from anthracene deformation (direction in-plane and perpendicular to the polymer backbone) obeyed rotational symmetry relative to the film normal (z axis) and yielded an inclination relative to the film normal of Θ = 71°. This indicated a tilt of the anthracene plane of 19° relative to the film plane. TMs from deformation of the phenylenes (direction in-plane and along the para-substituted 1 and 4 sites), instead, adopted an average inclination of Θ = 86° relative to the film (Section S14.3, ESI†).
 Fig. 18  Schematic representation of the molecular orientation of (a) AnE-PVstat:ITIC and (b) PBDB-T:ITIC. The plane formed by the anthracene unit in AnE-PVstat (represented through the blue normal vector) is tilted by 19° relative to the film plane. The indanone plane of ITIC is tilted by 16° relative to the film plane, and thus constitutes a similar orientation as anthracene, potentially allowing for π–π stacking. For PBDB-T:ITIC, instead, the tilt between donor and acceptor planes is more pronounced (0° vs. 18°), which rather indicates proper phase separation. 
Concerning ITIC, the TMs of the CO stretching vibration (direction along the CO bond) and the symmetric CN stretching mode (direction along the angle bisector between the two CN bonds) are inclined by Θ = 83° and 75°, respectively. The normal vector of the indanone plane spanned by these two TMs is then inclined by 16° relative to the film normal, which is tantamount with the tilt of the indanone plane relative to the film plane. Thus, both planes of the anthracene acceptor unit within the donor polymer and the indanone acceptor unit on the acceptor molecule align nearly parallel to each other (16° vs. 19° within the measurement uncertainty of ±3° each). This result may suggest the possibility of π–π stacking between those two sub-molecular units.
In the case of PBDB-T:ITIC, the ITIC-acceptor group (indanone part) was inclined by 18° relative to the film plane. The acceptor unit of PBDB-T, from which the electron is expected to be transferred, adopted an inclination of Θ = 90° and hence aligned parallel to the substrate plane (flat on). Thus, the sub-molecular acceptor groups of PBDB-T and ITIC cannot π-stack but should yield proper phase separation in their blend.
In summary, the pretty parallel alignment of functional units for the electron transfer in AnE-PVstat:ITIC and the pronounced tilt between the corresponding units in PBDB-T:ITIC are in accordance with a reasonable phase-separation in PBDB-T:ITIC, allowing for proper charge separation and extraction from the bulk heterojunction blend and, on the other hand, the intimate electronic interaction in AnE-PVstat:ITIC, yielding rapid geminate charge recombination and insufficient charge extraction.113,114
Summary and discussion
The initial goal of this study was to reveal photovoltaic performance limiting factors specifically for the donor polymer AnE-PVstat, which has been so far comprehensively investigated in combination with fullerene derivatives, when it is combined with the non-fullerene-acceptor ITIC. IV and EQE measurements as well as time-dependent-charge collection field (TDCF)62 have already revealed the major limitation to be in the too-small photocurrent. But since the PL of AnE-PVstat was completely quenched (by a factor of about 10000), too coarse-grained phase separation could not be the reason for insufficient photocurrent generation. In addition, energy transfer from the polymer donor to ITIC can be ruled out as well, since the remaining ITIC-PL is minor. Indeed, ESR confirmed the lack of charge generation, and ODMR demonstrated the formation of triplets to be another loss mechanism. By TAS the poor charge generation was better understood, since it could be assigned to be a consequence of rapid geminate recombination, whereas only a few longer-lived excitations resulted in triplet formation, leading to further losses. In fact, the TAS and ESR results are actually in perfect agreement with each other. TAS confirmed the production of both positive and negative charges in both blends, namely AnE-PVstat:PC60BM and AnE-PVstat:ITIC. However, the charge carriers strongly recombined geminately on a sub-ns timescale for the ITIC-based blend, whereas recombination was much slower (sub-μs time scale) for the PC60BM-based blend. This is in line with the poor performance of the ITIC-based blend. The ESR signal is proportional to the steady-state concentration of photo-induced charge carriers. For the quickly recombining charges in the ITIC-based blend the steady state charge carrier concentration will be minuscule, and hence a signal is neither expected nor observed by ESR.
Finally, intimate blending possibly due to π–π stacking between the anthracene group of the donor and the indanone-end group of the acceptor, through which charge generation should occur, was indicated by DFT and experimentally confirmed by IR-TMOA. Such donor–acceptor π–π stacking is in excellent agreement with enhanced electronic interaction and too intimate blending between the donor and acceptor, giving rise to the observed rapid decay of excitons, charge transfer states, and even charge-separated states.
But which role does the energetics play here? To analyze that, we firstly evaluated the exciton binding energies of individual materials. The ER-EIS data may be re-evaluated via convolution integrals to determine the joint-density of states (jDOS) and its linear onset, yielding such defined electronic gap. Note that upon comparison of the electronic gap with the optical bandgap, determined both via the onset of the spectrum, the exciton binding energy is readily obtained. Table 8 summarizes the such obtained exciton binding energies for all pristine materials.

Looking at the exciton binding energies, quite some differences became apparent: the fullerene-based acceptors as well as the PPE-PPV-based polymer exhibit rather large binding energies (≥670 meV), whereas the NFA ITIC and the two other polymers show moderate values (240–350 meV). It is thus expected from the single materials’ data that larger energy level offsets between molecular energy levels of the donor and the acceptor (in type II heterojunctions) are required, just to enable the splitting of the exciton to generate charge carriers. In order to populate the CT state at the heterojunction interface, generally, the condition of having optical bandgaps similar to or larger than the CT-state energies must be met. According to Tables 6 and 8, this condition seems to be fulfilled in all cases. Going one step further, the binding energy of the CT state itself must be very decisive for the success of charge carrier generation. To analyze that, the onset of absorption obtained from the sensitive EQE spectra and the jDOS obtained for the blends were compared in the same way to extract the CT-state binding energies.

At first it is important to note that the graphs shown in Fig. 19 are considered in their linear representation, exactly in the same manner as done for the determination of the exciton binding energies for single materials. In the case of semi-logarithmic plots, below certain energy values always some jDOS can be found to be larger (in relative signal) than the EQE, which would indicate for very low density of states that population of the same can be done without any energy barrier from the CT-absorption. However, this may be an illusion arising from the different sensitivity of the measurements and from the processing of the data itself. For comparison, such plots are depicted in Fig. S41 in the ESI.† However, such analysis is not quantitatively meaningful, which is why the linear representations were analysed for their onsets (Table 9). Note that the CT-state binding energy has already been determined somewhat differently before by comparison of CT-state with the ER-EIS difference of DonorHOMO and AcceptorLUMO peaks in a blend.115

While in general the expectation of finite binding energy for the CT-state exciton is met since in most cases the CT-absorption onset is lower in energy than the jDOS onset, representing the effective electronic bandgap of the donor–acceptor blend, already for the AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blend a peculiarity is found. Here a considerable amount of the jDOS is lower in energy than the absorption onset(s), formally leading to negative exciton binding energies within the range of −250 to −600 meV, indicating charge generation via an energy downhill process. Such an observation is to the best of our knowledge reported for the first time, and this would not have been possible without recording the blend DOS via ER-EIS. Considering the branch of the jDOS associated to the Fano-like resonance in the case of PBDB-T and PCDTBT, two more cases of downhill charge generation are found. In both cases, there is less jDOS available for occupation by charge carriers than for the above case, but typical charge carrier densities in illuminated organic solar cells range at about 0.01% of the available states. Hence, at least for PBDB-T:ITIC a considerable amount of charge generation should be feasible via downhill processes out of the CT state. In the case of PCDTBT only much smaller amounts of charge could be generated via the FR-feature of the jDOS, in good agreement with the results obtained for EQE depicted in Fig. 7.
While to date it is commonsense that the Coulomb-binding energy respectively an energy barrier needs to be overcome in order to generate free charge carriers (charge-separated states – CSS) within electronic states from the charge transfer exciton (CTE or CT state), it is perplexing to find examples for apparently negative exciton binding energies, indicating the energetic downhill process. In contrast, the charge generation in AnE-PVstat:ITIC blends may in addition to morphological factors be also energetically hampered, since this blend exhibits the highest CT-state exciton binding energy amounting to 680 meV. Such large binding energy is in very good agreement with orders of magnitude reduced photocurrents in this case. Clearly, such findings cannot be made based on CV data alone.
Our study indicates the existence of uphill and downhill charge generation, which is summarized in a simplified manner in Fig. 20: there are cases in which the CTE-energy overcomes the effective electronic gap (respectively the onset of jDOS of the effective bandgap) in organic semiconductor blends and thus charge generation from the CT state should become effortless by an energy downhill process. However, the up till now almost exclusively considered the tough situation, in which an energy barrier needs to be overcome from the CT state to the charge-separated state (CSS), has also been found among the systems studied here.
 Fig. 20  Charge generation in organic semiconductor blends/organic solar cells may either require overcoming an energy barrier from the charge-transfer state (resp. CTE) to the charge-separated state (“free charge carriers”) – or can take place effortlessly, since the energy gaps are reversed for other systems, and the charge separation may occur energetically “downhill”. 
Conclusions
In summary, the combination of intimate mixing, probably occurring via stacking of the corresponding electron-rich units on the donor copolymer and the acceptor molecule, with charge generation over a high energy barrier, resulted in unfavourably low free-charge carrier generation yields at the debut of combining an anthracene containing poly-para-phenylenes-co-vinylene copolymer with ITIC. Similarly but less severely affected was PCDTBT in combination with ITIC. While the energy barrier was very high from the CT state to the effective electronic gap detected by ER-EIS, we argue that there seems to be a possibility to transfer electrons into an isolated molecular orbital, which was detected as a Fano-resonance-like feature in the DOS. The existence of this isolated molecular orbital below the CTE-energy gap enabled furthermore effortless charge generation, respectively electron transfer without any barrier, for the PBDB-T:ITIC system. The observation of low photocurrent yields in the case of AnE-PVstat:ITIC is in good agreement with (a) the strong and rapid geminate recombination observed by TA, and with (b) the low or no spin-response in ESR measurements, as well as by a minor extent with (c) the observation of a considerable fraction of triplet generation. In conclusion, even if charge generation occurred over a high CT-state exciton binding energy successfully, and also if those charges did not already recombine geminately within the CTE or via triplet generation, insufficient percolation paths for hole and electron extraction may severely further limit the photovoltaic performance of organic semiconductor blends as a consequence of too intimate blending. Thus, care has to be taken for the design of future partners in π-conjugated donor–acceptor blends, in order to prevent too intimate blending owing to parts of the sp2-hybridized flat non-fullerene-acceptor molecules. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that no reliable energy level alignment can be predicted based on cyclic voltammetry data, as those would have yielded in all cases type II heterojunctions capable of proper charge transfer.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the ER-EIS method is a powerful technique that enables one to learn about the density of (electronic) states not only within pristine organic semiconductors but also in donor–acceptor blends. Thus it was possible to observe otherwise obscured energy level alignments between organic donor and acceptor semiconductors, which resulted in considerable differences between the expected and the effective electronic bandgaps. Also, the detection of an isolated molecular orbital, visible via the Fano-resonance and, therefore, fully functional of charge transport most probably via an ITIC-end group stacking motive,103 can be ascribed to this novel technique. While electronic energy levels have been determined via ER-EIS, the charge transfer exciton was derived or estimated by independent characterization methods. It is noteworthy to mention that there is a fundamental difference between the electronic energy levels and the CT state: while the first may be subject to so far not fully investigated ground-state interactions, the latter is a locally excited state existing only at the donor–acceptor interface. In fact, we need to clearly state that the CT state serves as a mediator between hole and electron populations existing on different physical domains, and thus it controls charge recombination as well as the open circuit voltage.116 Our findings of cases in which the CT state is higher in energy than the electronic bandgap may hopefully foster more research on the question of what governs the underlying creation mechanisms. Overall, we have confirmed that charge generation yields are linked to the energy relation between the CT state and the electronic bandgap in organic semiconductor blends. While charge generation over an – still so small – energy barrier between the CT state and the charge separated states is already known and discussed so far in great detail, we present evidence for cases in which an energy downhill process can occur, based on donor–acceptor energy level alignments beyond the current understanding.

 	Fig. 15  X-Band LESR spectra of (a) AnE-PVstat:PC60BM, (b) AnE-PVstat:ITIC blends in the frozen liquid solution and solid film state recorded at 77 K temperature. Spectral components’ assignment and magnitude of isotropic g01-factor evaluation for the positive polaron (AnE-PVstat P+˙) and known isotropic g02 of the PCBM anion radical are introduced in the figures. The AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blend shows radical formation in the donor and acceptor upon illumination. However, the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend does not indicate any hints of an ITIC anion radical formation upon illumination in solid film. However, the AnE-PVstat:ITIC blend shows the above light-induced response only in frozen solution.	 

 	Fig. 16  ODMR spectra of pristine and blended materials. In all cases, triplet excitons can be detected. The triplet spectra of the pristine materials are specific signatures for the respective material. All spectra are wide and symmetric around a sharp central peak. At half the magnetic field, an additional transition is observed. In the blends, triplets localized on the polymer AnE-PVstat can be detected as indicated by the red frames. In the blend with ITIC, additional ITIC triplets are generated (purple frame), while no PC60BM triplets are detected in the fullerene-containing blend.	 

 	Fig. 17  (a) ps–ns TA spectra (solid lines) of the AnE-PVstat:ITIC thin film after photoexcitation at 490 nm with a fluence of 10 μJ cm−2; TA spectra of the neat AnE-PVstat exciton (dashed pink line), ITIC exciton (dashed grey line), and ITIC anion (dashed blue line) measured on neat polymer film, neat ITIC film, and CuSCN:ITIC bilayer samples, respectively. (b) TA signal dynamics probed in the region of the blend's photobleach (2.05–2.4 eV) for a fluence of 10 μJ cm−2. The solid lines in (b) correspond to mono-exponential fits to the decay of the blend's PB region. Decay dynamics of ITIC excitons in neat films (triangles) and of polymer excitons (squares). (c) ps–ns TA spectra of AnE-PVstat:PC60BM for a fluence of 10 μJ cm−2. Note the spectral changes (indicated by arrows) caused by exciton dissociation. (d) ns–μs dynamics of PB of the AnE-PVstat:PC60BM thin film blend measured at different fluences after excitation at 532 nm.	 

 	Fig. 18  Schematic representation of the molecular orientation of (a) AnE-PVstat:ITIC and (b) PBDB-T:ITIC. The plane formed by the anthracene unit in AnE-PVstat (represented through the blue normal vector) is tilted by 19° relative to the film plane. The indanone plane of ITIC is tilted by 16° relative to the film plane, and thus constitutes a similar orientation as anthracene, potentially allowing for π–π stacking. For PBDB-T:ITIC, instead, the tilt between donor and acceptor planes is more pronounced (0° vs. 18°), which rather indicates proper phase separation.

 	Fig. 20  Charge generation in organic semiconductor blends/organic solar cells may either require overcoming an energy barrier from the charge-transfer state (resp. CTE) to the charge-separated state (“free charge carriers”) – or can take place effortlessly, since the energy gaps are reversed for other systems, and the charge separation may occur energetically “downhill”.
