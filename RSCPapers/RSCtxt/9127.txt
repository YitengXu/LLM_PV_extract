    , Accepted 21st August 2014First published on 16th September 2014AbstractVarious one-dimensional nano-morphologies, such as multiporous nanofibers (MPNFs), porous nanofibers (PNFs), and nanowires (NWs) of SnO2, are synthesized using electrospinning technique by controlling the tin precursor concentration. The MPNFs have ∼8-fold higher surface area compared to the other morphologies. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were fabricated using these nanostructures as photoanodes and their performance was compared. The MPNFs surpass the performance of PNFs and NWs as well as conventional TiO2 paste. Record photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼7.4% was realized in MPNFs DSCs, which was twice to that achieved using PNFs (∼3.5%). Furthermore, the MPNFs showed over >80% incident photon to current conversion efficiency (22% higher than that achieved by spherical P25 TiO2 particles) and also demonstrated ∼3 times longer electron lifetime and electron diffusion length. Owing to the possibility to produce large quantities using electrospinning technique, huge commercial potential of SnO2 nanostructures, and promising results achieved herein, the MPNFs are expected soon to be utilized in commercial devices.
1 Introduction
Nanostructured materials of novel morphologies are attractive owing to their promising physical and chemical properties, which are exploitable in emerging nanodevices.1,2 High surface-to-volume ratio of nanomaterials offers possibilities to perform a given task using fewer quantities than their bulk counterparts. The past two decades have witnessed interesting one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanoforests, nanofibers, and nanorods, due to their anisotropic properties.3,4 The hollow nanofibers have two surfaces; therefore, they offer two times higher surface area than the other 1D structures.5,6 Among the many techniques for forming 1D morphologies, electrospinning is a simple and versatile technique for producing nanostructures and membranes for many engineering applications, including filtration, healthcare, and energy.7–9 In the electrospinning technique, an organic polymeric solution is spun by an electric field (∼105 V m−1), and the resultant solid fibrous mat is collected on a collector surface.10 Conventional electrospinning process produces random solid fibers; however, immense research during the past decade enabled formation of other morphologies, such as tubes,11,12 flowers,13 and rods,8,14 by controlling the injection strategy or solution chemistry. Electrospun nanowires are proven to be one of the best candidates in almost all areas of science and technology such as advanced electronics, renewable energy, environmental, and healthcare.9
Tin oxide (SnO2), an archetypical transparent conducting oxide with larger band gap (∼3.6 eV at 300 K),15 low conduction band effective mass (0.1mo),16 and higher electrical mobility (100–250 cm2 V−1 s−1)17 than other metal oxide semiconductors (MOS), is a candidate for many applications such as transparent conducting electrodes, working electrodes for solar cells, batteries, gas sensors, catalyst supports, antireflective coatings, and other optoelectronic devices.18–20 Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop its nanostructures with diverse morphologies and aspect ratios with an aim to enhance the specific surface area and further improve their properties. Non-conventional morphologies of SnO2, such as tetrapods21 and flowers,13 have been synthesized from colloidal solutions with improved properties compared to their particulate or 1D analogues. SnO2 nanowires and nanotubes are also developed using electrospinning technique with improved properties.22–24 However, one of the major limiting factors of these 1D structures is their lower specific surface area, which adversely affected the device performance. For example, when these electrospun 1D nanostructures are used as a photoanode of DSCs, a photovoltaic device, in which the photocurrent flows between a dye-anchored nanostructured MOS (n-MOS) and a hole-conducting electrolyte,25 the lower surface area lead to lower photocurrents (∼15%) and inferior photovoltaic performances (24%) than the corresponding nanoparticle based DSCs.26
The two crucial parameters for improving the performance of SnO2-based DSCs are as follows: (i) improved electronic transport to overcome charge recombination with the electrolyte and (ii) larger surface area to accommodate more dye molecules. Towards the first strategy, Shang et al. employed SnO2 nanorods to improve charge collection and demonstrated photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼1.2%, which is greater than their NPs analogues (0.98%).26 However, the NRs were of lower surface area (12 m2 g−1) compared to NPs (15 m2 g−1). Towards the second strategy, a number of reports were published recently on high PCE in DSCs using SnO2 nanostructures. For example, flower-shaped SnO2 developed by electrospinning resulted in an open circuit voltage (VOC) as high as 700 mV with PCE ∼3% due to their high surface area (40 m2 g−1), larger electron density, and flat band potential compared to nanofibers based DSCs (PCE ∼0.7%, 19 m2 g−1).13,17 In another report, Dong et al. reported gradual PCE increment in SnO2 hollow microspheres by increasing the number of exterior SnO2 shells, which systematically increased the surface area from ∼20 m2 g−1 to ∼39 m2 g−1.27 A final PCE of ∼7.2% is reported in a quintuple shell, which is ∼40% higher than that of a single shell. Although the resulting architecture improved light scattering and enhanced dye-loading, the electronic transport was compromised due to their spherical shape. Therefore, a single morphology employing both of these parameters is actively sought for high efficiency DSCs.
We have now employed the electrospinning procedure and identified conditions for forming nanowires (NWs), porous nanofibers (PNFs), and multiporous nanofibers (MPNFs) of SnO2 by controlling the precursor concentration. The MPNFs offered 6–8 times higher surface area than the PNFs and NWs and gave the highest PCE ∼7.4% in SnO2 based photoelectrodes with appropriate modifications.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the SnO2 nanostructures
The starting materials were tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol, and all these chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. As a typical procedure, 3 g of PVP was dissolved in an equal volume ratio (1:1) of ethanol and DMF. To this solution, various concentrations of the tin precursor were dissolved at room temperature until the solution became transparent. In brief, the concentrations were 5.5 mM, 7 mM, 8.5 mM, 10 mM, 11.5 mM and were labeled as C0, C1, C2, C3 and C4, respectively. The viscosity of the solution for electrospinning was measured with a rheometer (LVDV III Ultra, Brookfield Co., USA).
The solutions were then transferred to a plastic syringe with steel needles for electrospinning, and the operating parameters were as follows: (i) applied voltage, 25 kV, (ii) the injection rate, 0.6 mL h−1, (iii) the distance between the collector and the tip of the needle, 20 cm, (iv) humidity, 40–45%, and (v) the speed of the rotating collector, 1200 rpm. Solid nanofibers were then collected from the collector and annealed at temperature 600 °C for 3 hour at heating rate 0.5 °C min−1.
2.2 Characterizations of nano morphologies
The crystal structure of the material was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique using Rigaku Miniflex II X-ray diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphology and microstructure of the materials were studied by scanning electron microscopy technique (7800F, FESEM, JEOL, USA). High resolution lattice images and selected area diffraction patterns were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 300 kV (FEI, Titan 80–300 kV). The BET surface area of the material was measured using gas adsorption studies employing a Micromeritics (Tristar 3000, USA) instrument in the nitrogen atmosphere.
2.3 DSCs fabrication and measurements
The DSCs were fabricated as reported before.28 In brief, 500 mg of SnO2 PNFs and MPNFs were dispersed separately in ethanol and made a translucent suspension. A pre-calculated amount of α-terpinol (α-T) and ethyl cellulose (E.C) were added to it to make 15–18 wt% in ratio of 1:4.1:0.5 (SnO2–α-T–E.C), and a paste was produced as stated elsewhere.29 This paste was then applied on sequentially pre-cleaned fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass substrates (FTOs; ∼10 Ω □−1) by water, acetone, and ethanol. A blocking layer was formed on FTOs via TiCl4 treatment for comparison. The coated FTOs were annealed for 30 min at 450 °C with the heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The FTOs were then taken out and immediately immersed in 0.3 M dye solution of cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)(N3) in absolute ethanol. The dye anchored FTOs were rinsed with ethanol to remove any unanchored dye and dried at room temperature before cell fabrication. The above electrodes were masked using a Suryline spacer (∼60 μm). The iodide/triiodide redox couple was filled in the gap between the electrodes and pre-heated platinum coated FTO (Solaronix) was used as counter electrode. Hence, SnO2 PNFs and MPNFs DSCs were fabricated. The active area of the devices was ∼0.15 cm2. A P25 DSCs was also fabricated as a reference cell.
To characterize the morphology and thickness of the films, the as-prepared nanostructures and the coated films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL-USA). Absorbance spectra of the desorbed electrodes were recorded using a UV-VIS NIR spectrophotometer (UV-2600 SHIMADZU). To investigate the current and voltage of the assembled DSCs, photocurrent measurements were carried out using a solar simulator (SOLAR LIGHT, Model 16-S 150) employing single port simulator with power supply (XPS 400) at 100 mW cm−2. I–V and OCVD measurements curves were obtained using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT30, Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands) employing the NOVA® software. The AC responses of the cells were studied using the Autolab PGSTAT30. The impedance spectra were fitted to the well-known transmission line model by Bisquert et al.30 using Z-view software. Both the real and imaginary parts were simultaneously fitted at absolute temperature of 293 K using the “calc-modulus” as “data weighing option”. Five sets of DSCs were fabricated using NWs and PNFs whereas ten sets were produced using MPNFs to ensure performance consistency.
3 Result and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of multiporous nanofibers
The tin precursor concentration in the polymeric solution for electrospinning was varied in five levels from 5.5 mM (C0) to 11.5 mM (C4). The as-spun polymeric mats had conventional fiber morphology with similar diameter ∼200–600 nm (ESI, Fig. S1†), which upon annealing resulted in NWs, MPNFs, and PNFs (Fig. 1). Table 1 summarizes the properties of the starting polymeric solutions and morphologies after annealing. Fig. 2 shows FESEM images of annealed nanofibers for samples C0 (a–c), C1 (d–f), C2 (g–i), C3 (j–l), and C4 (m–o). For the sample C0, porous solid NWs were formed with diameters ranging from ∼100–170 nm. A small increase in the precursor concentration (7 mM, C1) resulted in the formation of MPNFs with slightly larger diameter (120–190 nm), which upon further increments transformed into PNFs. The number of channels in MPNFs varied from 2 to 4 with their inner diameters ranging from 30 to 70 nm. Further increase in the precursor concentration (samples C2 and C3) resulted in the formation of PNFs with outer and inner diameters in the range of ∼160–220 and ∼50–100 nm, respectively; i.e., increase in the precursor concentration in samples C2 and C3 resulted in significant decrease in the tube diameter and ultimately the tubes vanished in the sample C4. For sample C4, the excessive concentration resulted in significantly varying diameters of NWs (210–340 nm), which is in accordance with the previous report on electrospinning of SnO2 nanowires.13

The BET surface area of the samples varied in the range of 7–78 m2 g−1 with the NWs being the lowest and MPNFs the highest. The observed 6–8 times higher surface area of MPNFs compared to PNFs is attributed to (i) multichannels inside a single wall and (ii) the smaller grains and pores in MPNFs as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, the panels (a and b) and (d and e) show TEM images of PNFs and MPNFs, respectively. A highly porous and hollow structure is visible in both cases. The MPNFs were formed with grains of size 5–15 nm, which are smaller than the grain size of the PNFs (15–25 nm). The smaller grains and many channels in MPNFs are therefore the source of its high surface area. The selected area electron diffractions (SAED) (panels c and f in Fig. 3) show concentric circles, which are due to polycrystallinity in both nanostructures; however, the PNFs had a relatively spotty pattern. The crystal structures of the samples were verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the observed peaks of PNFs and MPNFs from XRD (Fig. 4) pattern are (110), (101), (200) and (211) planes at 26.5°, 34°, 38° and 52° indicate pure SnO2 nanostructures.26 Additional crystal planes such as (002) and (321) were observed in MPNFs due to their lower grain size and relatively higher polycrystallinity. The lattice parameters calculated from the observed XRD peaks were a = b = 4.635 Å and c = 3.165 Å, which is in close agreement with the standard data (JCPDS Card no. 41-1445) of the tetragonal cassiterite structure of space group P42/mnm. The d-spacing of planes in the HRTEM images were consistent with those in the XRD patterns.

A significant question that needs to be addressed is on the mechanism of formation of variable porosity and the changes in the sizes of the particles composing the fibers with change in concentration of the precursors. As noted before, no change in morphology of the as-prepared fiber either in their cross-section or in the cylindrical surface was observed. To check whether there is any change in crystallinity of the fiber, XRD patterns of the as-spun fibers were measured and presented in ESI (Fig. S2†). Inorganic crystalline phases (judged from the sharp peaks) were observed in the as-spun polymeric samples. The crystallographic identify of the phases could not be identified; however, the peaks show a reversal of intensity for C2 (PNFs) compared to C1 (MPNFs), indicating the change in orientation of the crystallites, which is expected to be the source of variable porosity upon changing the precursor concentration. Nevertheless, further investigation of the mechanism on the formation of variable pores is needed and will be presented elsewhere.
3.2 Current voltage (I–V) characteristics
To realize the effect of increased surface area in MPNFs, photoanodes were fabricated for DSCs. Fig. 5 shows SEM images of the cross-sectional view of the photoanodes fabricated using PNFs and MPNFs. The thickness of the films was 17 ± 0.5 μm. The PNFs and MPNFs retained their morphologies even after extensive mechanical agitation during the paste making procedure and subsequent thermal annealing. No agglomeration was found in the photoanode film, ensuring high porosity for efficient electrolyte penetration.31

The dye-loading on photoanodes was calculated by desorption test. The calculated dye-loading of MPNFs was 3.38 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which is over four times larger than that of PNFs (0.83 × 10−7 mol cm−2). The significantly enhanced dye-loading is attributed to the higher surface area of MPNFs (ESI, Fig. S3†). A control electrode of TiO2 was also fabricated using commercial P25 paste. The dye-loading of the P25-based electrode (7.02 × 10−7 mol cm−2) was twice that of the MPNFs based electrodes. The current–voltage analysis of the DSCs is given in Fig. 6 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in the Table 2. As expected from high surface area in MPNFs, a high short circuit current density, JSC = 18 mA cm−2 and PCE ∼ 4.3% were obtained for the MPNFs DSCs, while those for PNFs DSCs were nearly half (JSC = 10 mA cm−2 and PCE ∼ 2%). The VOC in MPNFs DSCs showed an increment of 0.57 mV as a result of the enhanced JSC. The fill factors (FF) of both DSCs remained practically same (0.47 in MPNFs and 0.45 in PNFs). As the thickness of both electrodes was the same, the presence of multichannels in MPNFs and their smaller grain size compared to PNFs, which resulted in up to 8 times increased surface area and up to 5 times larger dye loading, is attributed to the higher JSC.

The low VOC and FF are the main issues in SnO2 based DSCs due to its lower conduction band edge which results in high electron recombination with the electrolyte species.32 In order to suppress the charge recombination, we introduced a thin layer of TiO2 onto the SnO2 PNFs and MPNFs photoanodes by TiCl4 treatment (the treated samples were named T-PNFs and T-MPNFs respectively).33 The TiCl4 treated photoelectrode showed remarkable increase in photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 6) as observed by others.34 The VOC, JSC, and PCE in MPNFs DSCs increased from 0.51 to 0.66 V, 18 to 24 mA cm−2, and 4.3% to 7.4%, respectively. The observed 30% increase in VOC and 33% increase in JSC resulted in ∼80% increment in final PCE upon TiCl4 treatment. Similar increase in photovoltaic parameters was observed for PNFs DSCs as shown in Table 2. For MPNFs DSCs. Our fabricated P25 DSCs showed PCE up to 7.6% (VOC = 0.72 V, JSC = 17.4, and FF = 0.61), which were comparable to the values reported for the chosen configuration and choice of dye and electrolyte.27 The MPNFs DSCs have significantly larger JSC and nearly similar PCE to that employed pure TiO2 despite its significantly larger VOC (10%) and FF (30%). To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest PV parameters reported for SnO2 based DSCs.
3.3 Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE)
The I–V results were validated by measuring the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices (Fig. 7a) and calculating the JSC using the relation (1)
 Fig. 7  (a) Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the three DSCs (T-PNFs, T-MPNFs and P25), (b) the τn calculated from OCVD data, (c) charge collection efficiency of the three DSCs (d) electron diffusion length calculated using a well-known electrical equivalent model. 
The integrated IPCE over the entire wavelength (λ) was used to calculate the JSC. Fig. 7a shows the IPCE spectra of the devices. The calculated JSC of the T-MPNFs, T-PNFs, and P25 DSCs were 20.5, 13, and 15.4 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree closely with their measured JSC from the I–V measurements (Table 2). A significant increase in the IPCE of the T-MPNFs over the others was observed. The highest IPCE for T-MPNFs, T-PNFs, and P25 DSCs were ∼83%, 57%, and 68%, respectively. The increased IPCE of the T-MPNFs DSCs over the T-PNFs could be attributed to its significantly larger dye-loading. However, its dye-loading is only half to that of P25 DSCs, thereby indicating that improved JSC of the T-MPNFs results from both dye-loading and desirable charge transport characteristics. Furthermore, an enhanced light scattering in the case of both T-MPNFs and T-PNFs was noticed at wavelengths >560 nm, which is attributed to the bigger size of 1D tubular material than that of P25 particles. An improved charge transport in SnO2 can be normally expected due to its many fold increased electron mobility compared to that of the TiO2.
3.4 Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement
To prove improved charge transport in SnO2 over TiO2, we measured the electron lifetime (τn) from open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. The OCVD is a simple technique to investigate real-time recombination kinetics in DSCs by changing their equilibrium state from illuminated to dark.35 The DSCs were kept under constant illumination, which is then interupted. The decay in the VOC was recorded as a function of time (ESI, Fig. S4†) during relaxation. It is evident that the VOC decay rate was significantly lower for T-MPNFs DSCs as compared to T-PNFs and P25 suggesting low recombination of photoexcited electrons. The τn was calculated by using the expression  where KBT is thermal energy, e is the elementary charge and dVOC/dt is the first order derivative of VOC.35 The T-MPNFs DSCs showed the highest τn, for example, at 0.3 V, T-MPNFs gave τn ∼ 7 s, whereas it is 2.3 and 1.47 s for T-PNFs and P25 DSCs, respectively (Fig. 7b). Our calculated τn for P25 DSCs is similar to that obtained by Zaban et al.,35i.e., (∼20 ms to 1 s) for a P25 nanoparticle based high efficiency DSCs. The high τn observed in SnO2 can be attributed to their 1D morphology as well as improved charge mobility through it.
3.5 Collection efficiency and diffusion length
The collection efficiency of the devices were compared from τn and electron transit time τd by using the expression .36 As shown in Fig. 7c, the T-MPNFs DSCs showed ∼21% increased charge collection than that of P25 and slightly increased charge collection than that of T-PNFs in photoanodes of similar thickness (17 ± 0.5 μm). This increment is due to the fact that the diffusion length i.e., the distance travelled by electrons before recombination,37,38 in T-MPNFs based photoanodes is 2–3 times higher than that of P25 (see ESI† for details on impedance analysis and Ln calculations, Fig. S5–S8†). Ln, which is ∼70–75 μm in T-MPNFs DSCs, ∼65–70 μm in T-PNFs and ∼30–35 μm in P25 DSCs (Fig. 7d), clearly establishes the effect of 1D nature of the tubular nanostructures. An enhanced τn and significantly higher Ln demonstrates the beneficial effects when 1D nanomaterial MPNFs architecture are employed as a photoanode material.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated various one-dimensional nano-morphologies of SnO2, such as nanowires, nanofibers, and multiporous nanofibers, via electrospinning by controlling the tin precursor concentration. Among them, the multichannel nanotubes possessed the highest surface area with superior charge transport characteristics. The MPNFs excelled compared to conventional nanofibers and nanowires when employed as a photoanode in DSCs, and significantly higher short circuit current was achieved in MPNFs DSCs compared to the conventional devices employed commercial TiO2 paste. The MPNFs enabled >80% charge collection (45% higher than spherical P25 TiO2 particles) and also demonstrated ∼3 times longer electron lifetime and electron diffusion length. Owing to the scalability of the electrospinning technique, desirable device characteristics, and huge commercial potential of SnO2 nanostructures, the present materials are expected to be utilized in commercial devices.
