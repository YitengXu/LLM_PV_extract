Via a four-stage growth mechanism, the PEDOT-MeOH TCA was designed to simultaneously possess (1) enhanced conjugation on the PEDOT main chain due to the electron-donating MeOH group, (2) a decreased energy band gap due to the elevated highest occupied molecular orbital level contributed by the electron-donating MeOH group, (3) tube-like fast one-dimensional (1D) charge transfer pathways, and (4) coral-like extended electro-active sites. For the application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the PEDOT-MeOH TCA worked as an outstanding electro-catalytic counter electrode (CE) for iodine/triiodine (I−/I3−) reduction. Thus, the DSSCs with the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA as the CE reached the highest solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 9.13 ± 0.06%, which was even higher than that of the DSSC with a standard Pt CE (8.94 ± 0.07%). Via various electro-chemical analyses (including cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode (RDE), four-point probe, Tafel polarization plot, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques), the newly synthesized PEDOT-MeOH TCA film was found to have a lower intrinsic heterogeneous charge-transfer rate constant (k0), extremely larger effective electro-catalytic surface area (Ae), and comparable sheet resistance (Rsh) to those of the standard Pt film. The PEDOT-MeOH TCA can be considered as a convincing replacement of the expensive Pt due to its high electro-catalytic ability, low cost, and simple fabrication process.
1. Introduction
In recent years, conducting polymers (CPs), including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),1 poly(3,4-propylenedioxy-thiophene) (PProDOT),2 polypyrrole,3 and polyaniline,4 have become superior materials for various electrochemical devices, e.g., super-capacitors,5 lithium batteries,6 and solar cells.7 Among all the CPs, PEDOT is the most attractive CP due to its low-cost, environmentally friendly properties, high conductivity, good electrochemical reactivity, and good stability.8–10 However, PEDOT-based films often have flat or porous morphologies, which both lack oriented or low-dimensional charge/electron transfer pathways; and thus the electrochemical performances of these PEDOT-based films are limited. Accordingly, structured PEDOT films were intensively designed and synthesized to have various morphologies such as nanorods,11,12 nanotubes (NTs),13 hollow microflower arrays (HMFAs),14etc., via several synthetic routes using sacrificial templates (hard-templates or soft-templates).15,16 It is noticed that the usage of the sacrificial templates brings two key disadvantages to the films: (1) severe structural damage of the film during the removal of the sacrificial templates; (2) inevitable and large decrease in the conductivity of the film due to the residual templates. In brief, in order to improve the electrochemical performances of the PEDOT-based films, a template-free synthesis of the structured PEDOT-based films is highly required.17
In this study, we establish a template-free and bottom-up electro-polymerization technique to obtain various structured PEDOT-based films using a hydromethyl functionalized EDOT monomer (EDOT-MeOH); the obtained films are generally denoted as PEDOT-MeOH. Via three routes, the PEDOT-MeOH tube array (TA), coral (C) and tube-coral array (TCA) films are separately synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Furthermore, these three PEDOT-MeOH films were used as the counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In a DSSC, an effective CE aims to rapidly catalyze the triiodide (I3−) reduction.18 Since the traditional electro-catalyst, platinum (Pt), is very expensive and rare on earth, PEDOT-based materials have great potential to replace Pt.19 As summarized in Table 1, chemically functionalized PEDOT20–25 films often gave good solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies (η) to their cells because the functional groups benefit the conjugation of the PEDOT polymer main chains. The structured PEDOT (e.g., PEDOT-NT13 and PEDOT-HMFA14) films also achieve good ηs because they possess fast and oriented charge transfer passages. However, it is hard to control the structures of PEDOT without templates. Since these structured PEDOT (NT and HMFA) films were constructed via a template-assisted process (using ZnO as the template), their DSSCs only possess comparable cell efficiencies with that of Pt.

Route III contains two steps: step 1 corresponds to route I, while step 2 corresponds to route II.

This work




In the case of our newly designed PEDOT-MeOH TCA, various advantages can be obtained simultaneously: (1) an enhanced conjugation of the PEDOT main chain due to the electron-donating MeOH group,26,27 (2) a decreased energy band gap due to the elevated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level contributed by the electron-donating MeOH group,28,29 (3) fast one-dimensional charge transfer routes, and (4) extended electro-active sites. Finally, the PEDOT-MeOH TCA gives its DSSC a high η of 9.13 ± 0.06%, which is even higher than that of the Pt-based DSSC (8.94 ± 0.07%).
2. Experimental details

Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetic grade), iodine (I2, synthetic grade), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW ∼ 20000) were purchased from Merck. Acetone (99%), guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN, ≥99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were bought from Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was procured from Alfa Aesar. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) was procured from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Transparent TiO2 paste (TL paste, Ti-nanoxide HT/SP, 13 nm), Surlyn® (SX1170-25, 25 μm) and cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye) were supplied by Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and dichloromethane (DCM, ≥99.8%) were received from J. T. Baker. The commercial light scattering TiO2 particles, ST-41 with an average diameter of 200 nm, were obtained from Ishihara Sangyo, Ltd. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq−1) conducting glass was purchased from NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA.
2.2 Preparation of various films
FTO conducting glasses were first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. A standard Pt counter electrode was prepared by direct current sputtering of a Pt thin film on an FTO substrate to a thickness of 30 nm.24 All PEDOT-MeOH films and all bare PEDOT films were electro-polymerized using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands) in a three-electrode electrochemical system. A cleaned FTO substrate (1 cm2), a Pt foil, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Via three different electro-polymerization routes, three kinds of PEDOT-MeOH films with various morphologies were obtained. As shown in Scheme 1, route I aims to synthesize a PEDOT-MeOH tube array (PEDOT-MeOH TA) perpendicularly grown on the FTO substrate, and synthesis through route I was done under a constant voltage of 1.4 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) for 80 s at 0 °C in a DCM-based electrolyte containing 10.0 mM EDOT-MeOH monomer and 0.1 M TBAP. Route II was used to synthesize a porous PEDOT-MeOH coral (PEDOT-MeOH C) structure on the FTO substrate under a constant voltage of 1.4 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) for 4 s at 25 °C in an ACN-based electrolyte containing 10.0 mM EDOT-MeOH monomer and 0.1 M LiClO4. Route III combined route I and route II sequentially; thus the PEDOT-MeOH TA is covered by a porous layer of PEDOT-MeOH C to form a hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH tube-coral array (PEDOT-MeOH TCA). Finally, three kinds of PEDOT-MeOH films, including PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA, were obtained. Via the same routes (routes I and II), two bare PEDOT films (using EDOT as the monomer in electro-polymerization baths) were separately prepared and denoted as PEDOT-I and PEDOT-II, respectively. Besides, another PEDOT-MeOH TA film (denoted as PEDOT-MeOH TA*) was prepared via route I using tetramethylammonium perchlorate (TMAP) as a replacement of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) in the electro-polymerization bath. In other words, this PEDOT-MeOH TA* is prepared in a DCM-based electrolyte containing 10.0 mM EDOT-MeOH monomer and 0.1 M TMAP.
2.3 Characterization of the films
The surface morphologies of the films were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1230, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Surface chemical analyses of the films were made by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Theta Probe, UK). The absorption spectra of a film were obtained by using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrophotometer (UV-Vis-NIR, JASCO V-670, USA). The electro-catalytic abilities of the films for the I−/I3− redox couple were estimated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) techniques. CV analysis was performed using the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat using a three-electrode system in an ACN-based solution, containing 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4. Various electro-catalytic films were used as the working electrodes. A Pt foil and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The scan rate for CV analysis was set at 100 mV s−1. RDE analysis was performed by using a potentiostat (model 900B, CH Instruments) equipped with a modulated speed rotator (MSR, PINE Instrument Company) in an ACN-based electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and 1.0 mM tetrabutylammonium triiodide. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE, Part #AFE7R9GCGC, PINE Instrument Company) coated with an electro-catalytic material was separately used as the working electrode, and a Pt wire and Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The rotating speeds were controlled at 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 rpm. The scan rate for RDE analysis was set at 2 mV s−1. The sheet resistances (Rsh), related to the electrical conductivities of the films, were measured by using a four-point probe technique and were recorded by using a Keithley instrument (Keithley 2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA). The electrochemical properties of various electro-catalytic films could be quantified by using their symmetric cells through Tafel polarization plots (Tafel plots) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses, which were obtained by using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). The scan rate for Tafel analysis was set at 50 mV s−1. The impedance spectra were obtained using a FRA2 module between 10 mHz and 65 kHz with an AC amplitude of ±10 mV. The electrolyte for Tafel and EIS analyses contains 1.2 M DMPII, 0.035 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:4).
2.4 Fabrication and characterization of the DSSCs
Firstly, the TiO2 colloid was prepared by adding 0.5 M aqueous TTIP to 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution with simultaneous stirring at 88 °C for 8 h, and then by heating to 240 °C for 12 h in an autoclave (PARR 4540, USA). The autoclaved solution was concentrated to contain 8 wt% crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) (ca. 20 nm) in the TiO2 slurry. A TiO2 paste for the light transparent layer (TL paste) was formed by adding 25 wt% PEG (with respect to TiO2 NPs) to the previous TiO2 slurry, while another TiO2 paste for the light scattering layer (SL paste) was formed by adding 25 wt% PEG and 100 wt% ST-41 (with respect to TiO2 NPs) to the previous TiO2 slurry. The PEG was used for preventing the SL paste from being cracked during its casting on an FTO glass and also to control the pore size of the pertinent TiO2 film.
Secondly, a cleaned FTO conducting surface was treated by spin coating a 100 nm TiO2 compact layer using a solution of TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio of 1:3). A 0.20 cm2 TiO2 film, containing 10 μm of TL and 4 μm of SL, was coated on the treated FTO glass by using a doctor blade technique using the above-mentioned TL and SL pastes, respectively, and each layer was separately sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in an ambient atmosphere.2 After the sintering process, the TiO2 film was immersed in a 5.0 × 10−4 M N719 dye solution (mixed solvent of ACN/tBA with a volume ratio of 1:1) at room temperature for 24 h. The TiO2 photoanodes were coupled with various films as the counter electrodes; the photoanodes were separated from the counter electrodes by using a 25 μm-thick Surlyn® film as the spacer. The electrolyte, which contained 1.2 M DMPII, 0.035 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:4), was injected into the gap between these two electrodes by capillarity.
Photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs with various films as the counter electrodes were obtained by using a potentiostat/galvanostat under 100 mW cm−2. The DSSCs were illuminated by using a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM 1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the DSSCs were obtained by using the potentiostat/galvanostat and by using another class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). The IPCE spectra were obtained under monochromatic light illumination in the wavelength region of 400 to 800 nm; the incident radiation flux (φ) was obtained by using an optical detector (model 818-SL, Newport, California, USA) and a power meter (model 1916-R, Newport, California, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology
The surface morphologies of various films were observed from FE-SEM and TEM images, as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Fig. 1a shows an ultra-thin Pt film covered on the FTO surface, indicating that the structure of the Pt film is mainly determined by the granular morphology of the FTO. As compared to other films, the Pt film is the flattest one, suggesting an inferior electrochemical surface. Fig. 1b and 2a reveal a sub-micro-sized PEDOT-MeOH tube array (PEDOT-MeOH TA) vertically grown on a relatively compact thin layer of PEDOT-MeOH on the FTO. The tubes on the PEDOT-MeOH TA film possess a smooth surface with an average length of 5 μm and an average diameter of 700 nm. Since Fig. 2a clearly shows that the PEDOT-MeOH TA is vertically grown on the FTO, it can be said that the one-dimensional (1D) electron transfer pathways are successfully built on the PEDOT-MeOH TA films. Besides, the FE-SEM images of the PEDOT-MeOH TA film prepared in the presence of tetramethylammonium perchlorate (TMAP), denoted as PEDOT-MeOH TA*, are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The PEDOT-MeOH TA* film also possesses vertically aligned tube arrays, which have a tube length and diameter similar to those of the PEDOT-MeOH TA film (with TBAP). Thus, it is found that no obvious changes can be observed by varying the alkyl chain length of the tetraalkylammonium cations.

 Fig. 2  Cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the films of (a) PEDOT-MeOH TA and (b) PEDOT-MeOH TCA; their TEM images are shown in the insets correspondingly. 

Fig. 1c shows a highly porous and coral-like PEDOT-MeOH matrix (denoted as PEDOT-MeOH C), suggesting its sufficient electrochemically active areas. Fig. 1d reveals that the porous PEDOT-MeOH C is uniformly decorated on the PEDOT-MeOH TA; thus a hierarchical structure of the PEDOT-MeOH tube-coral array (PEDOT-MeOH TCA) is observed.
In the films of the PEDOT-MeOH TCA, the inner PEDOT-MeOH TA layer provides a 1D core to facilitate the electron transfer of the film, while the outer PEDOT-MeOH coral layer supplies extended active areas to multiply the electrochemical reaction flux. The tube-corals on the PEDOT-MeOH TCA film possess a highly porous surface with an average length of 5 μm and an average diameter of 500 nm. Besides, Fig. 2a and b show the cross-sectional FE-SEM images of PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH TCA films, respectively; and their TEM images are shown in the insets correspondingly. Two key points can be once again verified from Fig. 2: (1) both PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH TCA have indeed a hollow tubular structure (see the insets), and (2) both PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH TCA are vertically grown on their FTO substrates. In brief, via three simple and template-free routes, the PEDOT-MeOH films with various morphologies are successfully obtained. Especially for the newly designed PEDOT-MeOH TCA, it simultaneously possesses 1D electron transfer pathways and large active surfaces, suggesting its possible applications in various electrochemical/electronic devices.
When it comes to the bare PEDOT films, the FE-SEM images of the PEDOT films prepared via route I (denoted as PEDOT-I, see Fig. S2a in the ESI†) and route II (denoted as PEDOT-II, see Fig. S2b†) show a similar porous and coral-like morphology, which is the same as that of the PEDOT-MeOH C. It is confirmed that the bare PEDOT films (without the hydroxymethyl functional groups) do not easily have an oriented or 1D morphology.17 Therefore, the hydroxymethyl functional groups on the PEDOT-MeOH conducting polymer are very important to obtain vertically aligned tube arrays on the films of the PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH TCA.
3.2 Effect of the hydroxymethyl group on PEDOT-MeOH
To clarify the effect of the hydroxymethyl group on PEDOT-MeOH, we chose thin films of PEDOT-II and PEDOT-MeOH C for comparison since the preparation procedure and the morphology for these two films are the same. In other words, only the hydroxymethyl groups on the PEDOT-MeOH C can cause the difference for PEDOT-II and PEDOT-MeOH C films. From the absorption spectra (see Fig. S2c†) of PEDOT-II and PEDOT-MeOH C films, both films give two distinct absorption bands in the visible (300–600 nm) and NIR (600–1300 nm) regions. The former corresponds to the π–π* transition of a conducting polymer, while the latter is the transition between the valence band and bipolaron band of a conducting polymer, which is related to its conjugation length.26,27,30 For a PEDOT-based film (PEDOT-II or PEDOT-MeOH C), the wavelengths (λ1 and λ2) of the maximum absorption peaks in the visible and NIR regions, respectively, are listed in the inset of Fig. S2c.† It can be found that the values of λ1 for both PEDOT-II and PEDOT-MeOH C films are very close, indicating a similar π–π* transition for both films. However, the value of λ2 for the PEDOT-MeOH C film (1229 nm) is larger than that for the PEDOT-II film (894 nm), suggesting that the obvious red-shift of the NIR absorption peak is caused by the hydroxymethyl groups on the PEDOT-MeOH C film. This red-shift of the NIR absorption peak directly reflects the easier electron transition between the valence band and bipolaron band of a conducting polymer; in other words, it reveals that the MeOH group can lead to both enhanced conjugation and the decreased energy band gap of a conducting polymer.26–30 Therefore, it is confirmed that the PEDOT-MeOH C possesses a longer conjugation length and better conjugation than PEDOT-II due to the existence of the hydroxymethyl groups on its polymer chain.
3.3 Growth mechanism of the PEDOT-MeOH TCA film

Scheme 2 illustrates the four-stage growth mechanism of our newly synthesized PEDOT-MeOH TCA. In the 1st stage (without any applied voltage in the electro-polymerization cell), parts of the EDOT-MeOH monomers are statically adsorbed on the FTO surface, while other monomers are uniformly dispersed in a DCM-based electrolyte used in route I (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 2  The four-stage growth mechanism of the PEDOT-MeOH TCA. 
In the DCM-based electrolyte, a supporting electrolyte, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP), is included. TBAP would dissociate into tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA+) and perchlorate anions (ClO4−). TBA+ would be attracted by the lone-pair electrons of the oxygen atoms on the EDOT-MeOH monomers. This can be simply denoted as the stage of “adsorption”. In the 2nd stage (with an applied voltage of +1.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in the electro-polymerization cell), the adsorbed EDOT-MeOH monomers are quickly oxidized to form a thin under-layer of PEDOT-MeOH on the FTO, while the other monomers move toward the FTO substrate due to the driven electrical force. This can be simply denoted as the stage of “oxidation”. In the 3rd stage (with a continued applied voltage of +1.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in the electro-polymerization cell), the monomers near the FTO are polymerized onto the under-layer; the pertinent PEDOT-MeOH chains are propagated along the normal direction of FTO due to the applied electrical field. During the electro-polymerization, some TBA+ cations are simultaneously bonded to the oxygen atoms on the PEDOT-MeOH,31 which can be verified by the N–O bond (at 401.55 eV) between the TBA+ and PEDOT-MeOH polymer chain shown in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 3). Since the bonded TBA+ and the hydroxyl groups on the PEDOT-MeOH are all hydrophilic, they tend to form an enclosed circular space, which works as a steric hindrance for the propagation of PEDOT-MeOH. When the applied voltage (+1.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+) is continued, the PEDOT-MeOH tube array is thereby formed. This stage can be simply denoted as the stage of “tubular propagation”. In the 4th stage (in an ACN-based electrolyte used in route II), the highly porous and coral-like PEDOT-MeOH matrix is irregularly decorated on the PEDOT-MeOH tube array due to the absence of the steric hindrance. This stage can be simply denoted as the stage of “decoration”. In summary, this four-stage growth mechanism of the PEDOT-MeOH TCA proceeds in the sequence of adsorption → oxidation → tubular propagation → decoration, as shown in Scheme 2.

3.4 Photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with various films as the CEs
For the application of the DSSCs, all synthesized PEDOT-MeOH films and a standard Pt film were used as the counter electrodes (CEs). In a DSSC, an electro-catalytic film on a CE aims to facilitate the heterogeneous charge transfer rate of I−/I3− at the CE/electrolyte interface. A slow consumption of I3− can lead to the severe energy loss in a DSSC owing to the slow I− regeneration, which causes the slow dye regeneration and the possible recombination reaction for the remaining I3− ions and the photo-induced electrons at the electrolyte/photoanode interface. Therefore, an effective electro-catalytic material as a CE to rapidly trigger the reduction of I3− becomes the key to obtain a highly efficient DSSC.32 An effective electro-catalytic material requires excellent electro-catalytic ability, good charge transfer capability, good conductivity, high corrosion resistivity, and good electrochemical stability.
Generally, platinum (Pt) works as the best electro-catalyst due to its outstanding electro-catalytic ability toward I3− reduction, so that Pt is most frequently used as a standard CE in the DSSCs.33
In Fig. 4, photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with various films (i.e., standard Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA) as the CEs were measured at 100 mW cm−2 illumination; the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. The DSSC coupled with the standard Pt as a CE shows an η of 8.94 ± 0.07% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 748.00 ± 4.58 mV, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.81 ± 0.14 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.67 ± 0.00. All cells with PEDOT-MeOH films as the CEs show good η's of 7–9%, indicating a promising nature of this newly introduced PEDOT-MeOH material as the electro-catalyst toward I3− reduction. The PEDOT-MeOH TA CE gave its cell limited values of JSC (17.22 ± 0.08 mA cm−2) and FF (0.64 ± 0.00) due to its smooth surface on the tubes (Fig. 1b) providing less active sites, while the PEDOT-MeOH C CE also gave its cell limited values of JSC (17.57 ± 0.07 mA cm−2) and FF (0.65 ± 0.00) due to its lack of 1D charge transfer pathways. When it comes to the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA CE, the co-existence of the 1D charge transfer pathways and large active surface areas on the PEDOT-MeOH TCA gives its DSSC the highest JSC (18.22 ± 0.12 mA cm−2) and FF (0.67 ± 0.00) values compared to those of the cells with CEs of the PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH C. It is surprising to find that the cell with the PEDOT-MeOH TCA CE shows a higher η (9.13 ± 0.06%) than that of the Pt-based DSSC (8.94 ± 0.07%). The newly synthesized PEDOT-MeOH TCA film can be considered as a low-cost and convincing replacement of the expensive Pt.

In Fig. 5, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs with various films as the CEs are measured in a range of wavelengths of 400–800 nm under the short-circuit conditions. The maximum IPCE values of the cells with Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA are 93.1%, 88.6%, 91.1%, and 95.1% at 510 nm, respectively. It can be said that all PEDOT-MeOH and Pt films are efficient electro-catalytic materials to give their cells good performances. Moreover, an IPCE curve can be integrated to obtain a short-circuit current density (JSC-IPCE), which is the summary of all the short-circuit current densities measured under individual monochromic light from 400 to 800 nm. In Table 2, the JSC-IPCE values for the DSSCs with Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA CEs are 15.28, 14.00, 14.74, and 16.02 mA cm−2, respectively. It can be concluded that the JSC-IPCE values obtained from IPCE curves (monochromic spectrum) are in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves (full sun-light spectrum).

3.5 Cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode analyses of various films
To further precisely quantify the electro-catalytic ability of a CE, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) analyses are separately performed in an I−/I3− redox electrolyte system. In the case of CV analysis, the major redox reactions at the electrolyte/CE interface include the oxidation of I− (eqn (1)) and the reduction of I3− (eqn (2)),34 which correspond to the anodic (Jpa) and cathodic (Jpc) peak current densities as shown in Fig. 6, respectively. 3I− → I3− + 2e−(1) I3− + 2e− → 3I−(2)
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammograms of various films. 
In Fig. S3 in the ESI,† the CV curves of Fig. 6 are shown individually; the corresponding background curves are included. Since a CE film is mainly used to trigger the reduction of I3− in a DSSC, the cathodic peak current density (Jpc), which is defined as the net current density at the peak, or the difference between the cathodic current peak and its background curve is focused. A higher value of Jpc directly reflects the better overall electro-catalytic ability of a film. In accordance with Fig. S3,† the Jpc values of Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA films are 1.58, 1.13, 1.48, and 1.80 mA cm−2, respectively, as summarized in Table 3. It can be observed that the film with higher Jpc gave the higher values of JSC and FF to its DSSC (Table 2) due to more charge transfer through the electrolyte/CE interface and the less charge recombination (energy loss) at the electrolyte/photoanode interface, respectively. Among all the films, the PEDOT-MeOH TCA offers the highest Jpc value and thereby gives the highest JSC, FF, and η values to its DSSC, suggesting its better overall electro-catalytic ability than the standard Pt.

However, there are two key factors that influence the overall electro-catalytic ability of a film, namely, the intrinsic heterogeneous charge-transfer rate constant (k0) and the effective electro-catalytic surface area (Ae), which cannot be distinguished by the CV measurement. Here, the powerful RDE analysis aims to simultaneously quantify these two parameters. At seven rotation rates (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 rpm), a RDE coated with a given film was separately scanned to obtain seven pertinent linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves, which are used to give seven values of disk currents (i) at the formal potential (E0′) of the I−/I3− redox couple for a given film. The value E0′ of I−/I3− redox couple at each film is determined by the above-mentioned CV curve (Fig. 6). When the rotation rates were converted into the angular velocity (ω), the plots of reciprocal disk current (i−1) vs. reciprocal of the rotation rate root (ω−0.5) were obtained for various films (i.e., Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA) as shown in Fig. 7. The intercept and slope of a fitting line in Fig. 7 were respectively used to find k0 and Ae values by using the modified Koutecký–Levich equation shown in eqn (3).35 (3)where i is the disk current obtained from the LSV curve at the formal potential (E0′), n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration of I3− (1.0 mM), D is the diffusion coefficient of I3− (3.62 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of acetonitrile, and ω is the angular velocity converted from the rotating speed.
 Fig. 7  Plots of i−1vs. ω−0.5 of various films. 
As summarized in Table 3, the standard Pt shows a k0 value of 7.3 × 10−3 cm s−1, while all PEDOT-MeOH films show nearly the same k0 value of 5.0 × 10−3 cm s−1, which is slightly lower than that of Pt (precisely, 0.70 times that of Pt). On the other hand, the standard Pt gives the smallest Ae value of 0.19 cm2, while all PEDOT-MeOH films are able to provide larger Ae values, about 2–5.8 times that of Pt owing to their rougher morphologies than that of Pt (Fig. 1). Among all the PEDOT-MeOH films, the values of Ae show a tendency of the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA > PEDOT-MeOH C > PEDOT-MeOH TA, and thereby the JSC and FF values of these DSSCs show the same trends. In brief, comparing Pt to all PEDOT-MeOH films, the Pt-based DSSCs show high performance due to the high k0 of Pt. Among all PEDOT-MeOH films, the higher the values of JSC and FF, the larger the values of Ae. Most importantly, hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA provides good k0 (0.70 times that of Pt) and extremely large Ae (5.84 times that of Pt) values, and thus it gives better overall electro-catalytic ability than Pt. Although the thicknesses of all PEDOT-MeOH films are about two orders of magnitude thicker than that of the Pt film, the values of Ae provided by these PEDOT-MeOH films are 2–6 times higher than that of the Pt film. This phenomenon has been observed in many conducting polymers (with or without chemical dopants);36–38 thus, it may be related to the intramolecular catalyzing mechanism of the conducting polymers, instead of the steric barriers for triiodide ions caused by the incorporation of tetrabutylammonium cations. In brief, the electro-catalytic abilities of the films show the trend of PEDOT-MeOH TCA > Pt > PEDOT-MeOH C > PEDOT-MeOH TA, which is consistent with the trends obtained from both CV and RDE analyses.
3.6 Four-point probe measurements of various films
The sheet resistances (Rsh) of various films were obtained by the four-point probe method using the samples coated on the soda-lime glasses. The Pt film was directly sputtered on the soda-lime glass, while all PEDOT-MeOH films were gently removed from FTO glass by using H2O2 and the peeled films were put on the soda-lime glasses. Thus, the obtained Rsh values reflect only the resistivities of the films. The Rsh values of standard Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA are 6.18, 6.30, 7.34, and 6.21 Ω sq−1, respectively (Table 3). It can be observed that the PEDOT-MeOH TA possesses a lower Rsh value than PEDOT-MeOH C, indicating that the PEDOT-MeOH TA has a larger electrical conductivity than PEDOT-MeOH C.
Accordingly, it is verified that the 1D sub-micro-sized tube array on the PEDOT-MeOH-TA indeed works as the fast electron transfer passages. It can be found that the PEDOT-MeOH TA provides a faster electron transfer ability (∼1.16 times than that of the PEDOT-MeOH C) but a smaller electro-catalytic surface area (∼0.74 times than that of the PEDOT-MeOH C); eventually, the PEDOT-MeOH TA shows a lower overall electro-catalytic ability (lower Jpc obtained from CV) than that of the PEDOT-MeOH C. As compared to the PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH C films, the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA film gives the lowest Rsh value due to the co-existence of the 1D tube array and the porous coral-like matrix.
3.7 Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectra analyses of various films
To investigate the charge transfer properties at the electrolyte/CE interface in a practical DSSC, Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analyses were individually performed in the same electrolyte used for the photovoltaic measurement of the DSSCs. The electrolyte contains a high I−/I3− concentration (1.2 M DMPII, 0.035 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN with a volume ratio of 1:4). Here, a symmetrical cell, i.e., a cell having the same film for both the anode and cathode, is used for both Tafel and EIS analyses. In Fig. 8, Tafel polarization plots show the logarithmic current densities (logJ) as a function of voltage (V) for different films at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. In general, a Tafel curve is divided into three zones. The 1st part at low potentials (|V| < 120 mV, with a sharp slope) represents the polarization zone, the 2nd part at middle potentials (120 mV < |V| < 400 mV) represents the Tafel zone, and the 3rd part at high potentials (|V| > 400 mV, a horizontal part) represents the diffusion zone.35 From Fig. 8, two charge transfer parameters can be obtained, namely, the exchange current density (J0) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct-Tafel). The value of J0 of a film is read from the intercept (at V = 0) of the extrapolating lines of both anodic and cathodic curves in the Tafel zone. The J0 value is tantamount to the electro-catalytic activity of a film; in other words, the higher J0 represents the better electro-catalytic ability of a film. In Table 3, the values of J0 show a tendency of hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA > Pt > PEDOT-MeOH C > PEDOT-MeOH TA, which is highly consistent with the values of Jpc obtained from the CV measurement and is in good agreement with the values of JSC and FF obtained from the photovoltaic measurement.
 Fig. 8  Tafel polarization plots of various films. 
Moreover, the J0 value is further used to calculate the value of Rct-Tafel using eqn (4).35 (4)where R is the ideal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The higher the value of J0, the smaller the value of Rct-Tafel, indicating the more amount of electrons passing through the electrolyte/CE interface. In Table 3, the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA has the least Rct-Tafel value of 2.65 Ω cm2, which is lower than that of PEDOT-MeOH TA (3.16 Ω cm2) and PEDOT-MeOH C (2.92 Ω cm2), because the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA possesses both 1D electron transfer pathways and large active surfaces. The hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH TCA film even provides a lower Rct-Tafel value than Pt (2.80 Ω cm2), indicating its good charge transfer ability toward I3− reduction. Besides, all the J0 and Rct-Tafel values were confirmed by their standard deviation values listed in Table S1 in the ESI.†
An electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of a symmetric cell was obtained based on an electro-catalytic film to extract three electrochemical parameters via fitting the spectrum into an equivalent circuit, as shown in the inset of Fig. 9. Firstly, the intercept of the high-frequency semicircle with the horizontal axis represents the series resistance (Rs), which refers to the resistance across the electro-catalytic film/substrate interface. The Rs value is affected mainly by the conductivity of the electro-catalytic film and the adhesion between the film and its conducting substrate.39 Secondly, the radius of the high-frequency semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct-EIS) at the electro-catalytic film/electrolyte interface. Thirdly, the diameter of the low-frequency semicircle (not obvious in Fig. 9) refers to the Warburg diffusion resistance (ZW) within the bulk electrolyte. In Fig. 9, the low-frequency semicircle seems to be overlapped with the high-frequency semicircle; this is due to the short diffusion length for the redox species via using the thin cell spacer (25 μm-thick) and the low viscosity of the solvents for the electrolyte (the viscosities of ACN and MPN are 0.37 cp and 1.60 cp, respectively).36
 Fig. 9  Electrochemical impedance spectra of various films. 
As summarized in Table 3, the Rs values for standard Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA are 20.68, 17.39, 19.35, and 17.28 Ω cm2, respectively. All PEDOT-MeOH films (17.28–19.35 Ω cm2) possess lower Rs values than Pt (20.68 Ω cm2); this is mainly attributed to the better adhesion between a PEDOT-MeOH film and its substrate, compared to the adhesion between a Pt film and its substrate. It is believed that a better adhesion between a CE film and an FTO substrate is achieved using the electro-polymerization synthesis (for all PEDOT-MeOH films), when compared to that of the sputtered Pt film. The Rs values of the PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH TCA are found to be similar and are both lower than that of the PEDOT-MeOH C. Since all PEDOT-MeOH films are prepared by the electro-polymerization process, the adhesions between these three films and their substrates are assumed to be the same. Thus, the lower Rs values of the PEDOT-MeOH TA and PEDOT-MeOH TCA are expected to be attributed to their lower Rsh values (namely, better conductivities), as compared to those values of the PEDOT-MeOH C.
On the other hand, it is to be noted that all the Rct-EIS values (obtained from EIS spectra) are consistent with the Rct-Tafel values (obtained from Tafel plots). And both Rct-EIS and Rct-Tafel values, irrespective of their measurement techniques, show high consistency with the Jpc values obtained from CV and the J0 values obtained from Tafel analysis; in other words, the electro-catalytic abilities of the films (PEDOT-MeOH TCA > Pt > PEDOT-MeOH C > PEDOT-MeOH TA) were precisely determined and consistently explained using CV, RDE, Tafel, and EIS analyses. Finally, the CE with hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH is believed to have a great potential to replace Pt.
Moreover, another EIS spectrum collected from a DSSC (FTO/photoanode/electrolyte/CE/FTO) is further used to support the results obtained from the EIS spectrum based on a symmetric cell. This type of EIS analysis is carried out under one sun (i.e., 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G)). Generally, the EIS spectrum obtained for a DSSC contains three semicircles in accordance with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. S4 in the ESI.† And four parameters can be extracted by fitting the EIS spectrum. (1) The intercept of the high-frequency semicircle with the horizontal axis represents the series resistance (R*s), which includes (i) the conductivity of both photoanode and counter electrodes, (ii) the adhesion of a photoanode with its FTO substrate, and (iii) the adhesion of a CE with its substrate. (2) The diameter of the high-frequency semicircle represents the heterogeneous charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at the CE/electrolyte interface. (3) The diameter of the middle-frequency semicircle refers to the heterogeneous charge transfer resistance (Rct2) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. (4) The diameter of the low-frequency semicircle corresponds to the Warburg diffusion coefficient (Z*W) between a photoanode and a CE.40 In Fig. S4,† the low-frequency semicircle for an EIS spectrum is also being overlapped, suggesting the negligible diffusion resistant within a cell. Table S1† lists the values of R*s, Rct1, and Rct2. By using the same photoanode, the variation of the R*s value is attributed to the differences in the conductivities of the CE films and the adhesions between the CE films and their substrates. The tendency of the R*s values obtained from the DSSCs containing various CE films shows great consistency with that of the Rs values obtained from the symmetric cells. In the case of Rct1, the values of Rct1 for the DSSCs coupled with Pt, PEDOT-MeOH TA, PEDOT-MeOH C, and PEDOT-MeOH TCA CEs are 1.78, 2.46, 2.13 and 1.51 Ω, respectively; these Rct1 values give a similar trend to that of the Rct-EIS values obtained from the EIS spectra based on the symmetric cells. In the case of Rct2, the values of Rct2 for all the films are similar since the same photoanode is used.
For the best PEDOT-MeOH TCA film, it is clear that the PEDOT-MeOH TA film shows better conductivity (lower R*s and Rs), while the PEDOT-MeOH C film provides an extremely larger effective surface area for the I3− reduction (larger Ae, lower Rct1 and Rct-EIS). In summary, the DSSC with the PEDOT-MeOH TCA CE reached the highest JSC and FF, and thereby the highest η due to the coexistence of the fast one-dimensional charge transfer routes and large extended electro-active sites.
4. Conclusions
Films of poly(hydroxymethyl 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-MeOH) with various morphologies were successfully synthesized by template-free preparations, and introduced for the first time as the counter electrodes in DSSCs. Among all the films, the hierarchical PEDOT-MeOH tube-coral array (PEDOT-MeOH TCA) film has the highest electro-catalytic ability owing to three key factors: (1) fast 1D charge transfer pathways provided by the 1D tube-array structure, (2) extremely large active sites provided by the porous surface, and (3) rapid reduction rate of I3− at the designed film. With regard to key factor (1), the fast 1D electron transfer routes of the PEDOT-MeOH TCA film can be confirmed via its low sheet resistances (Rsh). With regard to key factor (2), the large active sites of the PEDOT-MeOH TCA film can be proven via its large effective electro-catalytic surface area (Ae). With regard to key factor (3), the rapid reduction rate of I3− at the PEDOT-MeOH TCA film is verified by its large Jpc, large J0, low Rct (both Tafel and EIS measurements), good k0, and extremely high Ae. Therefore, the DSSC with the PEDOT-MeOH TCA exhibits the highest efficiency of 9.13 ± 0.06%, which is even higher than that of the DSSC with a Pt film (8.94 ± 0.07%). It may be concluded that the PEDOT-MeOH TCA is a promising electro-catalytic material to replace the expensive Pt in DSSCs.

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to different PEDOT-MeOH films on FTO substrates. Synthesis through Route I was done under a constant voltage of 1.4 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) for 80 s at 0 °C in a DCM-based electrolyte containing 10.0 mM EDOT-MeOH monomer and 0.1 M TBAP. Synthesis through Route II was done under a constant voltage of 1.4 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) for 4 s at 25 °C in an ACN-based electrolyte containing 10.0 mM EDOT-MeOH monomer and 0.1 M LiClO4. Route III contains two steps: step 1 corresponds to route I, while step 2 corresponds to route II.
