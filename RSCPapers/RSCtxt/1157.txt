    , Accepted 29th January 2013First published on 29th January 2013AbstractTwo new low bandgap copolymers, PBDT-DBPz and PBDT-DTDBPz, were prepared, in which the only difference was the additional added thiophene bridge between the BDT donor unit and DBPz acceptor unit for PBDT-DTDBPz. In addition to the improvements of UV-vis absorption and hole mobility, the PSC based on PBDT-DTDBPz:PC71BM demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 4.75%, much higher than that of the device based on PBDT-DBPz:PC71BM (0.46%), under the same experimental conditions.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have been explored as a promising clean and renewable energy source over the past decade, due to their unique advantages of low cost, light weight, and potential of being fabricated by a roll-to-roll process and large-area devices.1–7 PSCs are commonly composed of a conjugated polymer as a p-type semiconductor and a fullerene derivative as an n-type semiconductor sandwiched between an ITO positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode, and the polymer is the major light absorber. Generally, an ideal polymer donor in PSCs should exhibit broad absorption with a high absorption coefficient to obtain a high Jsc, suitable energy level matching with the fullerene acceptor to offer a high Voc, sufficient solubility to guarantee solution processability and appropriate compatibility with the n-type material to form a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network, and high hole mobility for efficient charge transport. The design and synthesis of new low bandgap (LBG) donor materials have been proved to be an effective way to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE).8–10 So far, the most powerful strategy to design a LBG conjugated polymer is to incorporate electron-rich (donor) units and electron-deficient (acceptor) units in heterocycles, to construct D–A polymer donors for high-efficiency BHJ PSCs, since the internal charge transfer (ICT) intrinsic to the D–A polymers offers the unique feature of almost independently tuning the energy levels and the bandgap.11 Among them benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based LBG polymers are one kind of star photovoltaic polymer donor material in PSCs. So far in the literature, single junction PSCs based on BDT have achieved over 9% PCE,12,13 while tandem solar cells have already reached a PCE approaching 10%,14,15 which show great potential for commercialization.
Quinoxaline has been widely implemented as an electron-deficient co-monomer of LBG polymers, due to the electron-withdrawing property of two imine nitrogens and relatively stable quinoid form.16–24 Our group recently developed a new quinoxaline derivative 10,13-dibromo-11,12-bis-(octyloxy)-dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DBPz) (Chart 1),25 which possessed the feature of a more planar and extending π-conjugation system compared to other frequently used quinoxaline (Qx) derivatives. Thus, DBPz endowed its corresponding polymers with broader light absorption, improved π–π interactions of polymer chains, and consequent enhanced charge carrier mobility. Also, the two alkoxy chains linked to the 11 and 12 positions of the Qx unit assured good solubility of the resultant polymers.
 Chart 1 
Considering the above issues, we attempted to couple the good construction blocks of BDT and DBPz into one new LBG copolymer named poly(4,8-bisethylhexyloxy-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-10,13-)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (PBDT-DBPz) (Chart 1). At the very beginning, we could not obtain this copolymer because of the big steric hindrance between the two building blocks. Under optimized reaction conditions, including increased reaction temperature and prolonged reaction time, a low molecular weight copolymer was finally obtained.
The chemical structure of conjugated polymers is critically important to determine their properties and optimize the performance of PSCs. Even small changes can induce dramatic effects on the physical and chemical properties of conjugated polymers, including their molecule weight, solubility, interchain packing, light absorption, and electrochemical properties.26–30 In our previous work, the changed linking positions could heavily influence the properties of copolymers.25 In particular, the effects of the structural modifications in the polymer backbone on the properties of conjugated polymers have been widely investigated.31–43 Stimulated by these examples, to reduce the reaction steric hindrance of the above case, an additional thiophene bridge was added between the two units, BDT and DBPz, to get another new LBG copolymer, poly(4,8-bisethylhexyloxy-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-10,13-di(thiophen-2-yl)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine) (PBDT-DTDBPz) (Chart 1). In addition to acquiring the copolymer with high molecular weight, the added thiophene bridges in PBDT-DTDBPz can also improve the planarity and increase effective conjugation of the polymer main chain, which translated into broader and stronger absorption, higher hole mobility, and better photovoltaic performance. The PSC based on PBDT-DTDBPz:PC71BM demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 4.75%, which is significantly improved, in comparison with that of the device based on PBDT-DBPz:PC71BM (0.46%), under the same experimental conditions.
Experimental section
Measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as internal standard. UV-visible spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. The thermal properties of the polymers were measured on a Netzsch STA449C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in nitrogen at a flow rate of 20 cm3 min−1. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation with a Pt disk, a Pt plate, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weights of polymers. GPC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system and a G1362A refractive index detector. Polystyrene standards were used as calibration standards for GPC. THF was used as an eluent and the flow rate was 1.0 mL min−1. Elemental analyses were performed by a CARLOERBA-1106 micro-elemental analyzer. EI-MS spectra were recorded with a Finnigan PRACE mass spectrometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Digital Instrumental DI Multimode Nanoscope IIIa in taping mode.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
OPV devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. To fabricate photovoltaic devices, a hole transport thin layer (ca. 40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (BaytronPVPAI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm) was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate at 3000 rpm and baked at 140 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into an argon-filled glovebox. Subsequently, the polymer:PC71BM active layer in chlorobenzene solvent was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm from a homogeneous blend solution. The PFN solution in methanol was spin-coated on top of the obtained active layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s to form a thin interlayer of 5 nm. To complete device fabrication, the substrates were pumped down under a high vacuum (3 × 10−4 Torr), and aluminum (100 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer through shadow masks. The effective device areas were measured to be 0.16 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 236 source meter. The spectral response was measured with a commercial photomodulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel). A calibrated Si photodiode was used to determine the photosensitivity. A xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2.
Materials
All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents of the highest purity grade were used as received. Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without purification. The monomer BDT was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. and used without further purification. The synthesis of DBPz and DTDBPz involved a multistep synthesis starting from phenanthrene-9,10-dione as shown in our previous paper.25

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route of the two polymers, PBDT-DBPz and PBDT-DTDBPz. The two copolymers were synthesized by Stille polycondensation of DBPz and DTDBPz with monomer BDT, respectively. Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3)/tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) was used as the catalyst system and toluene as solvent. At first, we could not obtain PBDT-DBPz at the reaction temperature of 90 °C, because the big steric hindrance between BDT and DBPz could hamper the transmetalation step, the rate-determining step of the Stille reaction.44 Even under the conditions of increased reaction temperature, prolonged reaction time and highly polar solvent DMF as coordinating ligand to the palladium center,44 we could only get a low molecular weight copolymer (or oligomer). The preparation of PBDT-DTDBPz was a totally different case. The two monomers reacted at the temperature of 90 °C for 30 min to yield a high molecular weight copolymer. If the reaction time was further prolonged, the resultant polymer would be insoluble in common organic solvents. Purifications were performed by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction of the crude polymers with acetone and hexane to remove oligomers and residual catalyst. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) were determined to be 2.75, and 149.92 kg mol−1 for PBDT-DBPz and PBDT-DTDBPz, with molar-mass dispersities of 1.91 and 1.48, respectively (Table 1). We also tried to synthesize another batch of PBDT-DTDBPz with low molecular weight to make a good comparison with PBDT-DBPz to verify the effect of the thiophene rings. But it was too difficult for this system. We reduced the reaction temperature and monitored this reaction by TLC. Once the monomer of DTDBPz disappeared, we stopped the reaction. Unfortunately, the molecular weight was still very large (Mn = 18.26 kg mol−1), in comparison with that of PBDT-DBPz and there was a considerable number of oligomers, which could not be removed by Soxhlet extraction. The polymers exhibited good solubility in chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The 5% weight-loss temperatures for PBDT-DBPz and PBDT-DTDBPz were 318 and 326 °C, respectively, which were high enough for their applications as active materials in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.45

Optical properties
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDT-DBPz and PBDT-DBDBPz in dilute chloroform solution with a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2, with the maximum absorption wavelengths listed in Table 2. PBDT-DBPz showed two absorption peaks, which is a common feature of D–A copolymers. The absorption peak at 389 nm originated from the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, while the absorption peak at longer wavelength (521 nm) should be attributed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the donor and acceptor.23 The optical absorption of PBDT-DBPz in film red-shifted about 26 nm compared to that of the solution, indicating the slight aggregation formed in the solid state. The optical bandgap, obtained from the onset of the absorption spectrum in film, was estimated to be 1.86 eV. The solution of PBDT-DTDBPz exhibited two absorption peaks at 423 and 580 nm, corresponding to a red shift of 59 nm for the longer wavelength peak compared to the PBDT-DBPz solution. The red shift absorption should be ascribed to the introduction of thiophene bridges between the donor and the acceptor in PBDT-DTDBPz. Generally, the added thiophene bridges would lead to two influences: on one hand, the thiophene bridges could improve the planarity and increase the effective conjugation of the polymer chain, which translates into broader and stronger absorption;46,47 on the other hand, the thiophene bridges might decrease the degree of ICT between donor and acceptor, leading to a blue shift in the absorption spectrum.48 The final result on the absorption spectrum after the addition of thiophene bridges was determined by the relative contributions of the two opposite influences. In this system, the thiophene bridges played an important role in improving planarity because of the big dihedral angles between BDT and DBPz units in PBDT-DBPz (discussed in the following part). The optical absorption of PBDT-DTDBPz film showed a red shift of only 6 nm in comparison with its solution. The optical bandgap of PBDT-DTDBPz was calculated to be 1.77 eV, 0.09 eV lower than that of PBDT-DBPz. The broader absorption feature of PBDT-DTDBPz would be beneficial to its photo-harvesting when used as a donor material in PSCs, thus, a higher current for PBDT-DTDBPz was expected.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltametry (CV) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the copolymers and estimate their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. All reported potentials were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple, which was used as the internal standard. The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3, with the corresponding data summarized in Table 2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated according to the equations: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.28) eV and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.28) eV, where Eox is the onset oxidation potential of the polymers and Ered is the onset reduction potential of the polymers. The onset reduction potential (φred) and onset oxidation potential (φox) of PBDT-DBPz were −0.88 and 0.95 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively, corresponding to LUMO and HOMO energy levels of −3.40 and −5.23 eV, respectively. After introducing the thiophene bridges in PBDT-DTDBPz, its LUMO energy level was decreased to −3.50 and its HOMO energy level was slightly raised to −5.20 eV. The increased conjugation derived from the thiophene rings is generally expected to contribute to a higher HOMO energy through enhanced delocalization of the D–A HOMO wave function. Also, these substitutions can have important implications on increasing coplanarity along the conjugated backbone, thus leading to a reduced electrochemical bandgap (Eecg) of PBDT-DTDBPz.49 These energy level changes were beneficial to a higher Jsc but not conducive to obtain a higher Voc, because the Voc of a BHJ solar cell is mainly governed by the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor.50–52

Theoretical calculation
To gain an insight into the fundamentals of the molecular architecture of the polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for PBDT-DBPz and PBDT-DTDBPz at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)53,54 level using Gaussian 09, Revision A.02 program, and the corresponding Kohn–Sham orbitals were obtained at the same level of theory.55 To simplify the calculation, only three repeating units of each polymer were subject to the calculation, with alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups. The simulated electron density distributions and the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels along with the optimized geometries are shown in Fig. 4. Dihedral angles between BDT and DBPz (D3) moieties in PBDT-DBPz were 30.4°, which were too big to exhibit a highly efficient ICT effect. After the addition of thiophene bridges between BDT and DBPz units, dihedral angles between thiophene and DBPz (D1) units were decreased to 26.6°, and the dihedral angles between thiophene and BDT were only 4.1°. Thus, better orbital overlap and a higher extent of charge transfer between the donor–acceptor moieties occurred in PBDT-DTDBPz, resulting in a significantly red-shifted absorption maximum (λmax = 580 nm) compared to that of PBDT-DBPz (λmax = 521 nm) in the solution state. In the film state, increased planarity might occur between the BDT and DBPz units in PBDT-DBPz, which could be more effective in improving the charge transfer properties. So, an increased red-shift in the maximum absorption from its solution to the film (26 nm) was reasonable, in comparison with that of PBDT-DTDBPz (6 nm). In addition, as shown in Fig. 4b, although discrepancies existed between the calculated and experimental results, the trends of variation in the HOMO and LUMO energies, as well as the energy gaps, were similar.

Hole mobility
The hole mobility of the copolymers was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (1:2, 150 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (100 nm). The SCLC behavior was analyzed using the Mott–Gurney square law: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ(V2L−3), where J is the current, μ is the hole mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the voltage drop across the device. V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi, where V is the effective voltage, Vappl is the applied voltage, Vrs is the voltage drop, and Vbi is the built-in voltage. The mobility was obtained from the slope of the plot of J1/2vs. V (Fig. 5). The value of PBDT-DTDBPz was found to be 1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while that of PBDT-DBPz was too small to be obtained. The higher mobility of PBDT-DTDBPz should be ascribed to its higher molecular weight and more planar skeleton than those of PBDT-DBPz.

Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate the potential application of the two conjugated polymers PBDT-DTDBPz and PBDT-DBPz in PSCs, PC71BM was used as electron acceptor, and a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) was utilized to evaluate the photovoltaic performances of PSCs. The copolymer:PC71BM blend films were prepared from chlorobenzene solution while the PFN interlayer was spin-coated from its methanol solution. In comparison with a Ca/Al cathode, the PFN/Al cathode used can noticeably improve Jsc and FF, since PFN could establish better interfacial contacts by decreasing the series resistance, resulting in the enhanced electron collection at the cathode and the decreased possibility of hole–electron recombination in the active layer.12,13,56 The photovoltaic performance characteristics of the PSCs are summarized in Table 3. Fig. 6 depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs measured under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G conditions (100 W m−2). As shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 7) of the blend films, the morphologies of the blend films were moderately homogeneous and there was no large phase separation, indicating that both of the two polymers possessed good miscibility with PC71BM. It was a little surprising that the two polymers showed a large PCE gap. For a PBDT-DTDBPz:PC71BM ratio of 1:2, the device exhibited a PCE of 4.75%, a Jsc of 9.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and a FF of 64.6%. For a PBDT-DBPz:PC71BM ratio of 1:2, the device showed a poor PCE of 0.46%, a Jsc of 2.10 mA cm−2, a FF of 28.1% and a Voc of 0.82 V. The higher Voc for PBDT-DBPz should result from its lower lying HOMO energy level. The larger Voc difference (0.06 V) than that (0.03 eV) of the difference in their HOMO levels, could possibly be due to the influence of other factors on the Voc, such as morphology and carrier recombination rate, etc. Though PBDT-DBPz exhibited a higher Voc, its PCE is just about 10% of PBDT-DTDBPz. In comparison with PBDT-DTDBPz, the lower hole mobility and the worse overlap of its absorption spectrum with the solar spectrum should in part account for the decrease in Jsc as revealed by incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. As shown in Fig. 8, the IPCE curves of the PSC based on PBDT-DTDBPz exhibited a broad response covering 380–730 nm, and the EQE exceeds 50% in the spectral region from 380 to 600 nm, higher and broader than that of PBDT-DBPz. In addition, the low molecular weight of PBDT-DBPz should be another important reason for the low FF.

Conclusions
In summary, two new low bandgap D–A copolymers based on BDT donor unit and DBPz acceptor unit, PBDT-DTDBPz and PBDT-DBPz, were synthesized by Stille polycondensation reaction. The only difference for these two copolymers was the additional thiophene bridge added between the BDT donor and DBPz acceptor units in PBDT-DTDBPz, which led to totally different properties, including the improved performance and the significantly red shifted absorption. Interestingly, there is one other example in the literature: after adding the thiophene bridge into polymer backbones, the HOMO energy level was reduced, but the absorption wavelength was blue shifted.48 The results were opposite to ours. Thus, it is necessary to investigate more examples to study these phenomena.
Based on the obtained experimental results, including the optical absorption, structural calculation, energy levels, field-effect carrier mobility and photovoltaic performance, it was indicated that even small changes in the polymer backbone could induce a dramatic influence on the physical and chemical properties of conjugated polymers. Thus, chemists should not only design new building blocks but also pay more attention to subtle structural modifications in classical structures.
