Considering demand for fertilizers, as well as its future potential as a dispatchable energy vector, sustainable synthesis of ammonia is being explored as an alternative to the capital- and carbon-intensive fossil-fuel-driven Haber–Bosch process. Here we assess stages along a transition to the sustainable synthesis of ammonia, looking at economic feasibility and climate impacts compared to the incumbent Haber–Bosch without and with CO2 capture. This analysis enables us to suggest technological thresholds for sustainable synthesis of ammonia to become economically and environmentally favourable. When driven by renewable energy sources, the water electrolyzer (near $400 per kW) coupled Haber–Bosch process will reach cost parity near 2.5 cents per kWh electricity. In the case of direct electrochemical ammonia synthesis, achieving cost-parity using the same 2.5 cents per kWh electricity will rely on achieving major advances in performance: an electrolysis full-cell energy efficiency exceeding 40% at a current density of 0.5 A cm−2. Once this operating performance is reached, electrically-powered ammonia synthesis will bring climate benefits when coupled with low-carbon electricity (<180 gCO2e per kWh), achievable when over half of today's U.S. electricity generation is supplied by renewable energy sources. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective on the key challenges and opportunities for sustainable ammonia synthesis routes to be competitive with the incumbent Haber–Bosch process in the future.

Broader context
Human civilization has been built on the invention of century-old Haber–Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. With growing concern to preserve our environment, there is a need for a transition towards sustainable chemicals, including ammonia. To accelerate this transition, ammonia is also explored as an enabler towards a whole new energy landscape. Over the years, a number of sustainable ammonia synthesis routes have emerged including water electrolysis coupled Haber–Bosch process, and electrochemical ammonia synthesis. While the lab-scale demonstrated performance for these routes are encouraging, the field lacks a comparative system-level assessment. In particular, the economic feasibility and climate impacts of these sustainable synthesis routes as an alternative to the century-old Haber–Bosch process needs to be explored. Here we present a comparative assessment of three stages (based on technology readiness level and demonstrated scale) along the transition towards sustainable ammonia synthesis to provide a bird's-eye view of their economic feasibility and climate impacts over the incumbent Haber–Bosch process. This analysis reveals key economic drivers and sets target performance metrics for sustainable ammonia synthesis routes to be compelling in the future. We identify the remaining challenges and research priorities to make such envisioned pathways viable.

Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) based fertilizers have been feeding the world for over a century. Currently, global NH3 production is about 175 million tons per year and is expected to increase by 3–5% per year for the foreseeable future to help feed the rising world population.1,2 Today, 85% of produced NH3 is primarily used for fertilizer production, and 50% of the world's agriculture depends on NH3 based fertilizers to increase crop yields.3,4 With a growing world population as well as end-use diversification, the global NH3 market is expected to grow from USD 53 billion in 2017 to USD 81 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6%.5 While NH3 will continue to dominate agricultural industries with the existing transportation and distribution infrastructure, it is also being explored as an energy vector. NH3's key potential as an energy carrier lies in its high volumetric energy density (15.6 MJ L−1) which is 9 times more than that of Li-ion batteries (∼1.73 MJ L−1) and almost 3 times that of compressed H2 (5.5 MJ L−1 at 70 MPa).6 This opens an opportunity to use NH3 as a low-carbon energy storage medium that can be traded globally.6,7 At ambient temperature, NH3 can be readily liquefied if a pressure of ∼10 bar is maintained or by cooling to −33 °C at atmospheric pressure. Consequently, the cost associated with storage and transportation of liquid NH3 is expected to be lower than that for compressed hydrogen (H2) at 700 bar.8,9
As renewable electricity export via transmission lines is not practically feasible across the globe, NH3 could potentially “bottle” renewable electricity in the form of a liquid-fuel, creating opportunities for low-cost, high-value energy transfer worldwide by leveraging the existing infrastructure and regulations for NH3 transportation.8 In the absence of H2 storage and distribution infrastructure, renewable NH3 can be used as a H2 carrier, or as fuel in vehicular internal combustion engines, marine engines, fuel-cell vehicles (either directly or indirectly via H2), small-to-medium (i.e., power generators) or large-scale (i.e., gas turbine) power generation.10–14 This diversification of NH3's end-use would facilitate the uptake of renewable power in future sustainable energy systems. Among other options (e.g., formic acid, alcohols, hydrides), NH3 is considered to be a long-distance and low-carbon energy carrier that can be used as a long-term (days to months) energy storage vector.8,15–17 It is projected that renewable NH3 could potentially mitigate over 440 million tons of CO2 globally every year.18
NH3 has been traditionally synthesized through the Haber–Bosch (HB) process, which requires H2 and nitrogen (N2).19 The HB process requires an operating temperature of 400–500 °C and pressure above 100 bar to convert N2 and H2 to NH3.3 The fossil-fuel based HB process emits an enormous amount of greenhouse gases (GHG), with a global average of 2.9 ton carbon dioxide (CO2) per ton NH3.20 This process is responsible for nearly 1.0% of global GHG emissions. Over 72% of the H2 used in the HB process is produced via steam methane reforming (SMR) at 850–900 °C and 25–35 bar, and contributes heavily to the net GHG emissions from SMR-HB.20,21 At the same time, to gain economic benefits at scale, the SMR-HB process needs to operate at large-scale (typical plant size ∼2000 to 3000 tons per day) with a capital investment of billions of dollars and long term (typically several years) commissioning.22 This centralized production leads to additional costs associated with NH3 transportation and distribution, e.g., $52 per ton via pipeline, $100 per ton via truck or $140 per ton via railway for 1600 km.23 Decentralized NH3 production can minimize these costs with modular and smaller capacity reactors. A small-scale NH3 plant is appealing to match the small-scale of geographically isolated renewable energy sources (typically 100–500 MW for solar or wind farms). Additional advantages of small-scale NH3 plants include skid-mounted installation, short-term commissioning, lower engineering costs and agile production (i.e., start-up, shut-down, and quick adjustments to production volume). Therefore, there is an incentive to develop a modular and sustainable process that is economically preferable over the century-old SMR-HB process for small-scale and highly distributed production of NH3.
There is potential for sustainable NH3 production if one could produce the required energy and feedstocks (i.e., H2 and N2) from renewable energy sources. When the production of energy and feedstocks (e.g., H2) comes from biomass along with CO2 capture and storage (i.e., BECCS), such NH3 synthesis route could potentially enable a negative emission technology (NET).24–26 On the other hand, to increase the penetration of renewable but intermittent energy sources into current and future energy systems, the development of energy storage technologies is critical to enable grid balancing.27–29 Therefore, opportunities arise for renewable energy storage in the form of NH3, which would lead to a paradigm shift towards coupling of energy and chemical industries to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.30–32 Consequently, there is global traction for the development of small-scale, distributed and sustainable production of NH3 by exploiting the modular design of electrochemical pathways.33–41 However, considering the technology readiness level (TRL) and demonstrated scale, such development is expected to go through a few overlapping transition stages, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Unlike the incumbent large-scale SMR-HB process, modular scaling of electrochemical systems could enable highly distributed NH3 production from small (kW) to large-scale (GW) applications.42–44 Electrochemical processes operate with a wide range of temperatures and pressures, and thus can be designed to adapt to intermittent renewable energy.45,46

In recent years, low cost and low carbon renewable electricity is increasingly becoming abundant.27 In 2017, the global weighted average cost of renewable electricity falls in the range of fossil-fuels, i.e., between $0.047–$0.167 USD per kilowatt hour (kWh).47 From 2010 to 2017, utility-scale solar and onshore wind electricity prices have dropped 73% and 23% to $0.1 per kWh and $0.06 per kWh, respectively.48 In Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Morocco, onshore wind electricity prices have dropped to as low as $0.03 per kWh.49 These recent developments and the dwindling production cost of renewables create opportunities for sustainable NH3 synthesis pathways to be competitive with the incumbent HB process in future markets. There is, therefore, a need for a system-level comparative analysis on transition stages for economic feasibility and environmental impacts. To date, techno-economic and life-cycle studies in this space are mostly limited to assessing the technologically mature Stage 2 pathway i.e., H2O electrolyzer coupled HB synthesis loop.4,44,50–53 However, a system-level analysis comparing diverse emerging synthesis routes with a consistent set of assumptions is yet to be reported. Additionally, the key economic drivers and benchmark technological goals, as well as associated challenges for each of these pathways, have rarely been discussed. In this work, we evaluate three proposed transition stages from present day large-scale SMR-HB process to future sustainable and small to large scale distributed NH3 production pathways based on their TRL, demonstrated scale, and market drivers (e.g., growth of renewable electricity). We then performed a comparative techno-economic and life-cycle assessment, for the first time, on these transition stages to provide a bird's-eye view of their economic promise and environmental benefits over the fossil-fuel based HB process. This analysis reveals the key economic drivers and sets target performance metrics for the potential NH3 synthesis routes that need to be achieved at scale. We conclude by providing a broader perspective on the key challenges and opportunities for sustainable synthesis routes to be competitive with HB process.
Transition stages toward sustainable ammonia
Decarbonisation of the NH3 industry would most likely follow a number of overlapping transition stages over the next few decades. A number of factors including technical, social and policy instruments may play vital roles in these transition stages as discussed in the following sections.
Current stage: SMR-HB
Depending on the wide variety of feedstock (coal, natural gas, naphtha, or oil) being used as well as differences in plant efficiency, emissions from NH3 production via the incumbent SMR-HB process vary widely from 2.0–4.6 ton CO2e per ton NH3, with a present-day global average emissions of ∼2.9 ton CO2e per ton NH3.20,44,56 A modern, optimized and efficient SMR-HB process emits ∼1.6 ton CO2e per ton NH3.57 Taking into account variation in plant efficiency in different geographical regions, as well as equivalent CO2 emissions associated with natural gas extraction and transportation, this value would increase to an average of ∼2.0–2.5 ton CO2e per ton NH3. We note that these emissions are from optimized large-scale SMR-HB processes. At smaller scales, and considering additional heat losses, emissions are predicted to be higher.58
The majority of CO2 emissions in the SMR-HB process come from SMR, which involves steam reforming of natural gas followed by the water–gas shift reaction to produce H2.59 One potential solution to decarbonize NH3, at least during a transition period, is to electrify methane reforming. For instance, gas-fired steam-reforming reactors can be substituted by electrically (ideally with low carbon intensity) heated reactors, thereby potentially circumventing emissions from fuel combustion.60,61 However, concerns remain with the possible impact of intermittent renewable energy on the overall technical and economic feasibility of such a process.
Stage 1: SMR-HB with carbon capture and storage (CCS)
With recent developments in carbon capture technologies, the conventional SMR-HB process can be coupled with CCS technologies; the produced NH3 is commonly referred to as “blue ammonia”.14 For every kg of H2 produced in the SMR process, 9–12 kg CO2e are emitted directly and another 1.84 kg CO2e of emissions are associated with the upstream (natural gas extraction) and infrastructure emissions.59 Assuming 90% of the GHG emissions associated with H2 feedstock production can be captured via a post-combustion capture unit, the carbon intensity (direct and indirect emissions) of the SMR-HB process can be reduced to ∼0.5 kg CO2e per kg NH3. We note that coupling a carbon capture unit with large-scale SMR-HB is technically viable, yet, a number of non-technical hurdles (e.g., availability of safe geological formations, government subsidies, supportive policy and legislative frameworks) explain the slow rollout of CCS; as of today limited number of CCS projects were successful even with financial and political support.62 We also note that CCS plants are commonly co-constructed with large CO2 emitters (iron and steel/cement/petrochemical), and consequently, the feasibility of CCS coupled with small scale SMR-HB is yet to be evaluated for the distributed production of sustainable NH3.
Stage 2: Near-term hybrid synthesis of ammonia (e-H2O + HB)
A near-term hybrid synthesis approach is well discussed in the literature, which replaces carbon intensive steam/air reforming (for natural gas, naphtha) or partial oxidation processes (for heavy oil or coal feedstock) with an air separation unit (ASU) to produce N2 and H2O electrolyzers to produce H2 (e-H2O), and couples it with an NH3 synthesis reactor via the HB process.4,14,20,44 Commercial H2O electrolyzers have been successfully commissioned and have reached 20 MW power capacity at 1400 Nm3 h−1 per stack.54 Today, H2O electrolyzers are commercially available at scale, from companies such as Siemens, Cummins, Nel Hydrogen, Teledyne, and Proton OnSite.45 Established companies and start-ups are investing in pilot-scale NH3 production via this hybrid route with an aim to transition towards a low-carbon value chain.54,63–68 For example, Yara, the world's largest NH3 producer, is building a hybrid NH3 demonstration plant using solar power in Western Australia.69 Green NH3 pilot plants are currently operational in Oxford (30 kg per day, developed by Siemens) and Fukushima (20 kg per day, developed by Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, FREA) to evaluate the potential of this process for commercialization.65
Among various electrolyzer designs (alkaline, proton exchange membrane (PEM) or solid oxide electrolyzers), PEM electrolyzers offer multiple advantages in this context for small to large scale NH3 production.70 Industries are increasingly inclined towards PEM electrolyzers for their compact and modular design, high current density (∼1.0–2.0 A cm−2), high system efficiency (∼52–69% LHV), fast response, dynamic operation (0–165% of the nominal load) and H2 purity (>99.99%), which can be integrated with a downstream HB synthesis loop.70–72 PEM electrolyzers operate at higher pressures (some over 80 bar) which could reduce the operational energy for a downstream HB process by approximately 1.7 GJ per ton NH3.20 The cost competitiveness of H2via PEM H2O electrolysis as compared to incumbent SMR process strongly depends on the price of electricity and electrolyzer stack. The average cost of current H2 production via SMR is $1.28 per kg H2 for natural gas prices from $3.25–8.3 per GJ.59 The H2 produced via present-day wind, solar and nuclear powered electrolysis ranges from $5–10 per kg.59 While PEM electrolyzers remain expensive today (∼$1 M per MW), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) projects the technology to be cheaper in the future (projected stack cost in 2030 is $0.5 M per MW) with improved performance (3.0 A cm−2 at 1.8 V).72 This may create opportunities for the hybrid NH3 synthesis pathway to be cost-competitive with SMR-HB process.
To decarbonize NH3 production via this hybrid approach, low carbon electricity is required to drive the electrolyzers. The intermittency of low carbon electricity (wind or solar) demands dynamic operation of the PEM electrolyzer and HB loop. While PEM H2O electrolyzers can efficiently respond (0–165% of the nominal load) to variable power input, dynamic operation of a high temperature and pressure NH3 synthesis reactor is challenging. Consequently, the need for energy storage with batteries or produced H2 may impede the economic feasibility of this pathway and is discussed with techno-economic analysis in later sections of this article.
Stage 3: Long-term electrosynthesis of ammonia (e-NH3)
Stage 3 pathways eliminate the need for an NH3 synthesis reactor using the HB process. In contrast to SMR-HB, electrosynthesis processes operate at a wide range of temperatures and pressures; and when coupled with renewable electricity, could produce NH3 with substantially lower GHG emissions.20,33 Considering the growing interest but relatively low maturity (TRL of 1–3) of present-day NH3 electrosynthesis pathways (e-NH3), here we lay out three emerging pathways as Stage 3 in technology development. Despite low production rates, extensive research efforts devoted towards a mechanistic understanding of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using homogeneous (molecular) catalysis continues to guide the development of heterogeneous catalysis research.73–81

One-step e-NH3. 
Renewable NH3 can in principle be synthesized by one-step electrochemical process in the presence of H2O: 2N2 + 6H2O → 4NH3 + 3O2 (E° = 1.17 V, 25 °C; E = 1.20 V, 500 °C)(1)As the NRR potential (i.e., −0.059 V versus reversible H2 electrode, RHE) is in close proximity to that of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) (i.e., 0.0 V versus RHE), the more favourable kinetics of HER result in low NH3 selectivity (typically <10%) or high energy consumption for electrochemical NH3 production at room temperature.34,35,82 To improve the selectivity of NRR, a number of approaches to suppress HER have been explored,83 including reducing proton availability using basic electrolytes with high pH, regulating proton diffusion with alkali metal cations (K+), or using non-aqueous organic proton sources such as ionic liquids.84–89 On the other hand, the electrosynthesis of NH3 has been demonstrated at elevated temperatures (i.e., 100–600 °C) in molten salt and solid electrolytes.90 However, at higher temperatures (>500 °C), NH3 decomposition (2NH3 → 3H2 + N2) dominates, resulting in an inevitable loss of produced NH3.91 Considering the analogous system design, the energy efficiency of one-step NH3 electrosynthesis could, in principle, reach ∼70% (% HHV), similar to what has been practically demonstrated for commercial H2O electrolyzers.22,72


Two-step e-NH3. 
In a two-step electrochemical process, H2 is first produced via H2O electrolysis (eqn (2)), followed by oxidation of H2 and reduction of N2 in a NH3 electrolyzer, as follows: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 (E° = 1.23 V, 25 °C)(2) N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3 (E° = −0.06 V, 25 °C; E = 0.09 V, 500 °C)(3)When H2 is used as the proton source in a two-step process, energy efficiencies of ∼50% (assuming 70% HHV efficiency for water electrolyzer; 0.6 V overpotential and 100% selectivity for NH3 electrolyzer, corresponding to 66% energy efficiency) are expected due to the inevitable overpotential losses in two electrolyzers.22 The increase in total capital and balance of plant costs related to the use of two electrolyzers compared to single electrolyzer is another major disadvantage.


Three-step e-NH3. 
Apart from the above renewable NH3 routes, there has been recent interest in three-step Li-mediated pathways to synthesize NH3.55,83,92–99 Irrespective of the catalyst, process (batch vs. continuous), electrolyte (aqueous or non-aqueous) and reaction conditions (i.e., temperature and pressure), the Li-mediated approach proceeds through three steps: electrolysis of lithium salt (e.g., molten LiOH) forms Li metal (eqn (4)), followed by nitridation of Li to form tri-lithium nitride (Li3N) (eqn (5)) and finally Li3N protonation (eqn (6)) to produce NH3 and regenerate the lithium salt.55 6LiOH → 6Li + 3H2O + 3/2O2 (E = 2.8 V, 427 °C)(4) 6Li + N2 → 2Li3N(5) 2Li3N + 6H2O → 6LiOH + 2NH3(6)Since the chemical NRR step (eqn (5)) is decoupled from the protonation step (eqn (6)), HER can be avoided, resulting in impressive selectivity (i.e., 88% faradaic efficiency) and reaction rates (0.2 A cm−2 at ∼4.5 V for LiOH electrolysis).55 While such performance metrics are encouraging, concerns remain with the energy-intensive (minimum required energy of 2.8 V, or ∼14 kWh kg−1 NH3) Li+/0 electrolysis process.22
One of the hurdles for the growth of Stage 3 (e-NH3) electrosynthesis research towards the right pathway has been the lack of a standard testing and reporting protocol. Due to the very slow kinetics of N2 reduction, competitive HER and low solubility of N2, often the experimental yield of NH3 is vanishingly small (typically 10–1000 nmol h−1 m−2).88,100 False-positive results are often observed due to multiple sources of contamination (e.g., air, human breath or ion conducting membranes, nitrates, amines, nitrites and nitrogen oxides). Recently, rigorous benchmarking protocols (gas purification, 15N2 isotopic labelling and multiple control experiments) have been recommended to detect and quantify performance metrics of NH3 electrosynthesis, which would certainly enable faster development of this key research front towards practical application.86,100

Economic analysis model for ammonia synthesis
For the SMR-HB and CCS as used in Current Stage and Stage 1, respectively, we calculated the capital and operating cost from similar plants at comparable production scale.101,102 For Stage 2 and Stage 3 scenarios, we built a process flow model using Aspen HYSYS®. The process simulation package was designed to calculate the material and energy balance for a small-scale NH3 plant (100 tons per day). Since a consistent comparison of prior techno-economic analyses is challenging due to differences in production scale, various methods of N2 (cryogenic distillation/PSA/membrane) and H2 production (solid oxide/alkaline/PEM electrolyzer, biomass), power sources (wind, solar, natural gas, biomass etc.) as well as variation in the assumptions of previous works, we used a consistent set of assumptions (Table 2) in this analysis.4,50–53 To guide the development of electrochemical technologies to produce energy-dense carbon-neutral liquid fuel (i.e., NH3) towards commercialization, the U.S. Department of Energy's ARPA-E REFUEL Program sets out clear technological goals, including current density >300 mA cm−2 at a faradaic efficiency of 90% (equivalent to a production rate of 9.3 × 10−7 mol cm−2 s−1), full cell energy efficiency >60%, and degradation rate of 0.3% over 1000 hours.103 We assumed these aspirational targets in this analysis for Stage 3 pathways, as shown in Table 2 for benchmarking purposes to identify how the optimistic case would compare to the incumbent SMR-HB process. We performed a sensitivity analysis on these performance metrics to reveal their impact on the overall economic feasibility for technology development. We designed a cryogenic ASU to produce the N2 feedstock for Stage 2, wherein high purity N2 is required to avoid catalyst poisoning in the HB process. In Stage 3, we have designed a O2 removal unit for N2 production, wherein we burn O2 (in air) with the H2 produced by the NH3 electrolyzer (from HER side reaction) and by an additional PEM water electrolyzer. This process produces 98.4% N2 and steam, which are used subsequently for synthesis and separation (via distillation) of NH3, respectively (see ESI†). N2 purity requirements are not expected to be as extreme for electrochemical processes in comparison to HB, with the exception of the Li-mediated approach. O2 contamination may reduce the selectivity, but it is not expected to damage the electrocatalyst. We designed compression and NH3 separation (i.e., condenser or distillation column) processes as needed for storage and transportation of NH3. All related figures, tables, and detailed calculations can be found in ESI.† The Aspen Economic Analyser was used to estimate the total capital investment (assuming direct and indirect costs) and total operating costs (assuming fixed and variable costs) of ASU, Oxygen removal, distillation column, condensation and compression units (Tables S12 and S13, ESI†).

The electricity price was assumed to be $0.02 per kWh, based on recent auctions for solar and onshore wind electricity and projections in several jurisdictions.104 With the assumptions listed in Table 2, the end-of-life net present value (NPV) was estimated (see detailed calculation in ESI†) using eqn (7) on a 20-year basis, with a 38.9% tax rate and a 10% nominal interest rate (NIR):105 (7)where t = year, n = plant life, CFt = cash flow in year t, NIR = nominal interest rate.
The levelized cost of NH3 (LCOA) was determined by adjusting its selling price to result in a final NPV equal to zero,106 and was calculated by the following equation:107 NPV = 0 = Product revenue present value (LCOA) − operating cost present value − total capital cost(8)The LCOA of current SMR-HB and the three transition stages under the assumptions listed in Table 2 are shown in Fig. 2. The market price of NH3 from SMR-HB widely varies with scale and natural gas prices (average ∼$5.0 per GJ) from $325 per ton (at 1474 ton per day scale) to $983 per ton (at 10 ton per day scale).18 Based on our economic model, we estimated a LCOA of $670 per ton for a small scale (∼100 tons per day) SMR-HB plant, which is consistent with literature reports (LCOA between $600–800 per ton).18 Coupling a small scale carbon capture unit with SMR-HB (as in Stage 1) would indeed impact the economics (assuming $120 per ton CO2 captured), leading to a LCOA of ∼$900 per ton NH3. A price on carbon, as implemented in many jurisdictions (a credit of $20–50 per ton CO2 captured), would make current SMR-HB and Stage 1 pathways equally competitive (∼$800 per ton NH3).108
 Fig. 2  Levelized cost of NH3 produced at different stages assuming an electricity price of $0.02 per kWh and a production rate of 100 tons per day. The teal square indicates the LCOA of small-scale (100 tons per day) SMR-HB considering a carbon tax ($50 per ton CO2).128 The orange square indicates the net LCOA of Stage 1 when a carbon credit is applied ($50 per ton CO2, which equals to $100 per ton NH3). The dashed pink box in Stage 2 shows the impact of additional capital cost (when driven by intermittent electricity with 25% capacity factor) due to the inclusion of additional H2O electrolyzers and H2 storage unit for continuous plant operation. The purple squares show the LCOA of one-step and two-step e-NH3 at 50% FE with revenue from co-production of H2 and O2. 
The economic feasibility of Stage 2 synthesis relies heavily on electricity prices. At $0.025 per kWh, the LCOA for Stage 2 would reach cost parity with large-scale incumbent SMR-HB ($530 per ton NH3), which falls in the same range ($500–600 per ton) as reported in literature.4,44,50–52 Stage 2 NH3 synthesis requires a stable (high capacity factor) electricity supply to drive the H2O electrolyzers to provide a continuous H2 feed for continuous operation of the NH3 synthesis reactors in the HB process. When coupled with intermittent renewable electricity such as solar and wind (capacity factor 20–30%),109 additional electrolysers and H2 storage costs would increase the LCOA by $100 per ton NH3. Assuming a capacity factor of solar electricity (25%), the electricity price needs to be near $0.01 per kWh to reach cost parity with SMR-HB process (see ESI†).
Under our aspirational assumptions (Table 2), all Stage 3 e-NH3 routes are economically compelling over Stage 2 at electricity prices below $0.02 per kWh, with one-step e-NH3 showing the most promise ($339 per ton NH3). Note that all Stage 3 e-NH3 routes reap the economic benefits of multiple revenue streams from by-products (O2 and H2). For one-step and two-step e-NH3 routes, the primary competing reaction (HER) produces H2 with high economic value. Consequently, a conservative faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 as opposed to the aspirational FE (90%), does not represent an “energy loss”, rather it reduces the LCOA. The LCOA of one-step and two-step e-NH3 at 50% FE would lead to $121 per ton and $236 per ton, respectively (assuming possible revenue from co-production of H2). The feasibility of such co-production (NH3, H2 and O2) would depend on the location and availability of a suitable market for both of these products. Further cost reduction in these two routes (one-step and two-step e-NH3) may come from innovation in energy efficient NH3 separation techniques, for example via absorption and catalysis development.20 The three-step e-NH3, being energy intensive due to LiOH electrolysis, shows the highest LCOA ($555 per ton) among all three e-NH3 routes. While the lab scale performance of this pathway is encouraging, the feasibility of this pathway would rely on finding an alternative redox couple to replace Li or the availability of very cheap electricity (<$0.02 per kWh).
To reveal the economic contribution of different process units, the breakdown of capital and operating costs under optimistic assumptions are shown in Fig. 3. The capital intensity (i.e., total capital investment/plant annual production capacity) of a small scale (100 tons per day) SMR-HB process is in the range of $1900–2250 per ton NH3; over 60% of which comes from SMR.102 In Stage 1, the capital intensity of small scale CCS coupled SMR-HB would add $1700 per ton NH3 capital intensity (based on a non-linear scaling relation), making this the most capital intensive pathway. For Stage 2, the ASU, an essential step to produce high purity N2, is one of the most capital-intensive processes (∼$440 per ton NH3). The compression unit for a co-product i.e., O2, was found to be capital intensive as well due to the multi-stage compression needed to reach market specification (2640 psig).110 Despite the fact that Stage 2 does not require expensive distillation and PSA processes for NH3 separation (instead simple condensation is typically used), it has a higher capital cost compared to Stage 3 routes due to the capital intensive (∼$800 per ton NH3) NH3 synthesis reactor in the HB process.
 Fig. 3  Cost analysis for NH3 synthesis pathways assuming an electricity price of $0.02 per kWh and a production rate of 100 tons per day. (A) Total capital intensity (i.e., total capital investment/plant annual production capacity) and (B) total operating cost breakdown for three different stages along with the incumbent SMR-HB process. Capital costs included equipment purchase, BoP, and contingency; operating costs considered labor, maintenance, and utility. A detailed breakdown is found in Fig. S15 (ESI†). 

Fig. 3B shows the operating cost breakdown for all transition stages. Over the last century, the SMR-HB process has gone through massive performance improvements, leading to an increase of the overall energy efficiency from 36% to 62–65%.20 Consequently, the methane-fed SMR-HB process requires the lowest operating cost as compared to the electricity driven Stage 2 and Stage 3 routes. Stage 2 reaps the economic benefits from energy efficient (∼70% HHV) H2O electrolyzers as well as energy efficient NH3 synthesis reactors in the HB process (∼0.64 kWh kg−1 NH3). Among Stage 3 pathways, high operating costs associated with three-step e-NH3 is attributed to energy intensive LiOH electrolysis (at 3.4 V and 37% energy efficiency, 16.79 kWh kg−1 NH3).
Key performance metrics for electrosynthesis of ammonia (e-NH3)
To this end, we sought to better understand the sensitivity of various assumed parameters for Stage 2 and Stage 3 NH3 synthesis pathways (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Several critical parameters i.e., electricity price, NH3 selectivity, current density, single-pass conversion, electrolyzer stack cost, and NH3 selling price are chosen for sensitivity analysis (Fig. 4 and Table S14, ESI† shows the range of values). As expected, for all the scenarios considered here, the electricity price is the most significant economic driver. Even a $0.01 per kWh rise in electricity price would increase the LCOA by $145 per ton. The cost of the electrolyzer has a noticeable impact on the economic viability of renewable NH3 synthesis. Doubling the electrolyzer cost raises the LCOA by ∼$100 per ton. Apart from the electrolyzer cost, the selectivity (or faradaic efficiency) also has a significant impact. A lower selectivity will increase the power requirement and associated operating cost of the process (to maintain the production rate and in the absence of immediate market for a co-product i.e., H2). Lower selectivity also increases the size and power requirement for the PSA unit to separate H2 for recycling N2. A 20% reduction in selectivity increases the LCOA by ∼$180 per ton.
 Fig. 4  Sensitivity analysis for Stage 3 (one-step e-NH3). (A) Levelized cost of NH3 (LCOA). (B) Operating current density and its impact on Capex, Opex and LCOA assuming an electricity price of $0.03 per kWh and a production rate of 100 tons per day. The I–V behavior (Fig. S22, ESI†) of NH3 electrolyzer was incorporated based on real world data of a Siemens water electrolyzer.129 Sensitivity analyses for all other stages are shown in Fig. S16–S21 (ESI†). The range of values for sensitivity analysis is summarized in Table S14 (ESI†). 
Often, NRR is performed at very low current densities and with excess N2 supply. This leads to a very low N2 single pass conversion which increases NH3 production costs due to the purification of unreacted N2 that is needed for reuse. In the absence of appreciable experimental data, we explored the impact of single pass conversion in the range of 5–25% on the economic feasibility of the process. Our analysis revealed that a low single pass conversion has a large impact on the Capex and Opex of the PSA unit and thereby on the LCOA as shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. S23, ESI.† The economic analysis reveals the importance of standardization, and we suggest that only studies where N2 flows are controlled/measured i.e., to track the N2 balance, should be considered as meaningful benchmarks.
Of all electrolyzer performance parameters, the current density and cell voltage are most closely linked towards the overall economic feasibility of the process. Fig. 4B shows the capital, operating and LCOA as a function of electrolyzer current density for one-step NH3 synthesis in Stage 3 (see ESI† for details). Because of an inverse square relationship, higher current densities decrease electrolyzer capital costs (for a fixed production rate) and increase NPV up to a certain threshold and subsequently become insignificant as compared to other costs. In contrast, the operating cost of the electrolyzer continues to increase with increasing current density, due to increasing voltage and therefore a lower system efficiency. In summary, increasing current density results in a trade-off between lower capital costs and higher operating costs leading to a nexus of optimum operating conditions (∼0.5 A cm−2) where one achieves the lowest LCOA. Furthermore, considering the intermittency of renewable energy sources and associated needs for grid balancing, we sought to explore the economic feasibility of sustainable NH3 synthesis by operating at partial or over-loads. For this analysis, we assumed that auxiliary components such as air separation, PSA and distillation units are capable of handling the higher production rates in the case of over-load. The analysis indicates that 50% partial load operation will lead to ∼64% increase in LCOA from nominal load operation, despite the drop in Opex due to improved system efficiency (see Table S15, ESI†). This is due to the decrease in the NH3 production rate along with the higher capital intensity. In contrast, operating at 50% overload could be beneficial with a 35% reduction in LCOA from nominal load operation. At times of over generation when electricity price might be zero/negative, the LCOA could plummet below 30 $ per ton.
To this end, we sought to summarize the key performance metrics that need to be achieved at scale to make renewable NH3 economically compelling compared to the fossil-based SMR-HB route. We found the electricity price to be the key economic driver and energy efficiency, current density (i.e., reaction rate or yield), faradaic efficiency, and overpotential to be key performance indicators based on the sensitivity analysis (Fig. 4). Here, we define energy efficiency as the ratio of the higher heating value (HHV) of NH3 (22.5 MJ kg−1 or 6.25 kWh kg−1) to the total input energy. Subsequently, we calculated the levelized cost of NH3 (Stage 2 and Stage 3) for a range of energy efficiencies and electricity prices (Fig. S24, ESI†). Our aspirational assumptions revealed maximum energy efficiencies (see ESI†) that vary widely from ∼45% (Stage 3, three-step e-NH3) to ∼83% (Stage 2). Further optimization of process efficiency (e.g., N2 and NH3 separation) would possibly lead to higher efficiencies. At $0.05 per kWh, NH3 produced in Stage 2 would reach cost parity with small-scale SMR-HB process (i.e., $750 per ton at a scale of 100 ton per day with carbon tax as in Fig. 2) at an overall process energy efficiency of ∼60%. To put these results into perspective and considering the industrially mature PEM H2O electrolysis HHV efficiency of ∼70%, the overall process efficiency that can be achieved today for Stage 2 is ∼61%.71 This would result in a levelized cost of $530 per ton NH3 near $0.025 per kWh electricity. When renewable electricity prices plummet below $0.03 per kWh, most of the Stage 3 e-NH3 synthesis routes appear to be competitive. For example, considering the lab scale demonstrated voltage efficiency of 62% for LiOH electrolysis (cell voltage of ∼4.5 V at 0.2 A cm−2), an overall energy efficiency of 38% can be achieved with three-step e-NH3.55 This would result in cost parity with the SMR-HB process at an electricity price near $0.015 per kWh. For one-step and two-step e-NH3, an electrolyzer energy efficiency over 40% needs to be achieved with a current density of 0.5 A cm−2 to be cost-competitive with SMR-HB process at $0.025 per kWh. Unfortunately, lab scale demonstrated NH3 electrolyzer energy efficiencies for the one-step and two-step e-NH3 pathways are well below 20%.34 While a few groups have demonstrated higher energy efficiencies, especially at elevated temperature, operating current densities remain below 0.01 A cm−2.34,88
Cradle-to-gate carbon emissions in ammonia synthesis
We have assessed cradle-to-gate carbon footprints for all three stages of technology development for NH3 synthesis, primarily based on the total energy consumption, as this accounts for over 90% of the total carbon emissions.48 The total input energy is estimated from the sum of the thermodynamic required energy, energy related to kinetic overpotential, the thermal energy required to heat the reactants to 500 °C (for high temperature cases in one-step and two-step e-NH3) as well the energy required for N2 and NH3 separation (PSA and/or distillation). Fig. 5A shows the breakdown of the required energy input for all stages. The energy required for the small-scale SMR-HB process (∼11.75 kWh kg−1 NH3) and for Stage 1 (SMR-HB process with CCS) is also shown for comparison. As can be seen, even with our aspirational performance metrics (Table 2), Stage 3 routes require noticeably higher energy compared to the well-optimized SMR-HB processes.22

(A) Energy consumption for all stages, red dashed horizontal line indicates the HHV (6.25 kWh kg−1) of NH3. (B) Cradle-to-gate CO2 emissions in each stage with various electricity CO2 emissions intensities. The horizontal grey area represents a typical range CO2 emissions from present-day SMR-HB process.22 Dashed arrows indicate the emissions from various sources (Table S17, ESI†), national projections are taken for US,113,130 EU,131 and Canada.132 
Clearly, the electrolyzer is the most energy intensive component in Stage 3 development, with the lowest electrolyzer energy required for Stage 2. In contrast, three-step e-NH3 requires the highest energy due to LiOH electrolysis. This can be attributed to the required cell voltages for electrolysis (∼1.77 V and ∼3.4 V for one-step and three-step e-NH3 in Stage 3, respectively; and 1.8 V for H2O electrolyzer in Stage 2, as in Table 2). At room temperature, both one-step and two-step e-NH3 need noticeable energy for the distillation process to separate NH3 from the electrolyte. In contrast, at high temperature (ca. 500 °C), only the PSA process is required to separate gas phase NH3 from unreacted N2 and co-product i.e., H2. In three-step e-NH3, we found that by efficient heat integration, the heat generated from the exothermic hydrolysis of Li3N (−581.62 kJ mol−1 NH3) can be utilized to offset the energy required for distillation to separate NH3 from aqueous phase (see details in ESI†).111,112 Note that, the ASU, HB synthesis loop, O2 compression and condensation units are not energy intensive processes as compared to electrolyzers.
Based on these total energy consumptions (Fig. 5A), we calculated cradle-to-gate carbon footprints (Fig. 5B) for all the above stages at various electricity emission intensities (gCO2e per kWh) as compared to that of the present-day SMR-HB process. Coupling CCS with SMR-HB would substantially decarbonize the NH3 industry to 0.5–0.6 ton CO2e per ton NH3. In order to provide climate benefits over SMR-HB (<2.0 ton CO2e per ton NH3), apart from improving the device performance, the electrochemical NH3 synthesis needs to be performed with relatively low-carbon electricity (electricity carbon intensity <180 gCO2e per kWh), corresponding to approximately 66% share of renewable electricity in the U.S. electricity generation mix.113 While this would be a highly ambitious target to achieve by 2050 in the U.S., such low-carbon electricity is likely to be achieved in other jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada. For instance, today, Canada's electricity is fairly clean with a national average of ∼114 gCO2e per kWh.114 When coupled with renewable hydroelectricity (∼1.2 gCO2e per kWh) in Quebec, Canada, the Stage 3 e-NH3 synthesis route would provide net climate benefits of over ∼10 million tons of CO2 reduction per year in Canada.115
Conclusions and outlook
The viability of each of the proposed transition stages towards sustainable NH3 production in the future would depend on a number of technical and non-technical aspects, including process maturity (i.e., electrolyzer efficiency, stability and yield), process agility with intermittent energy sources, market share of renewable energy sources, economy of scale, and policy instruments. The price of renewable electricity is of prime importance behind the economic viability of Stage 2 and Stage 3 technologies to be cost competitive with century old SMR-HB process to realize sustainable NH3. A recent study projects a levelized cost of renewable electricity (LCOE) of $0.019 per kWh with a base case assumption of cumulative installed capacity (CIC) value of 6 TW in 2050.116 Under an optimistic scenario (CIC value of 35 TW in 2050), the LCOE drops to as low as $0.007 per kWh. Considering this projected base case scenario ($0.019 per kWh in 2050), all of the proposed Stage 2 and Stage 3 routes would be economically compelling over the SMR-HB process.
As major renewable energy sources are intermittent in nature, a renewable NH3 plant needs to be economically responsive to this intermittent electricity to avoid costs associated with building on-site energy and feedstock storage facilities. In this regard, our analysis reveals that room temperature e-NH3 routes, either in the presence of H2O or H2 (one-step or two-step), would be preferable for providing grid balancing solutions.45 However, we note that intermittent operation of the ASU, distillation and PSA units may be challenging and will require further process optimization. While the high temperature electrosynthesis process reaps the benefits of reaction kinetics, the operation of such process with intermittent electricity is also challenging. To compensate for intermittency, one can also consider energy storage options such as batteries. But, considering the projected price of Li-ion batteries ($100 per kWh), the additional capital intensity (∼$1800 per ton NH3, nearly equal to the total capital intensity, Fig. 3A) of a battery storage system would substantially impede the overall economic feasibility of the process.117 On the other hand, while the above-ground H2 storage system is relatively less capital intensive, the requirement of additional electrolyzers (to maintain the production capacity) in this pathway would substantially increase the capital intensity of the overall process (ESI†). Consequently, the addition of storage system (either electricity or H2) seems to make sustainable NH3 production pathways economically less attractive; specifically, when coupled directly with renewable energy (i.e., solar or wind) with a low capacity factor (<50%). We thus suggest R&D efforts in systems integration of now-discrete energy sectors to alleviate challenges associated with intermittent operation of sustainable NH3 production system to run in a reliable and cost-effective manner.31 Alternatively, low-carbon electricity such as that from nuclear and/or geothermal plants working at high capacity factors, could be alternative source for sustainable e-NH3 synthesis (Fig. S16–S21 in ESI†). Furthermore, research efforts should also be directed towards NH3 electrosynthesis using air or N2 with reduced purity as well as novel methods for NH3 separation, for example by absorption.20,118,119
Considering the low maturity of different e-NH3 routes, as well as continuous cost reduction of H2O electrolyzers and renewable electricity prices, coupling a H2O electrolyzer (TRL of 5–8) and traditional HB synthesis loop (Stage 2) at a matched scale would possibly be the short-term solution for sustainable NH3 synthesis.45,71 On this note, Haldor Topsoe's solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) coupled with a HB synthesis loop is encouraging.120 The proposed process represents an optimized energy integration of an SOEC and NH3 synthesis reactor, leading to improved system efficiency (energy consumption of ∼7.2 MWh per ton NH3) and capital savings due to the elimination of the ASU. However, the higher stack cost of today's SOEC as compared to PEM/alkaline electrolyzers may partially impede the overall economic feasibility of this integrated approach.71 Furthermore, attention should be paid to the purity of the N2 produced via this approach, as HB catalysts, unlike the expectations for electrocatalysts, are vulnerable to ppm levels of O2 and H2O.121 The key challenge of Stage 2 is the mismatch between the relatively small scale of today's renewable energy plant (typically ∼100–500 MW for wind or solar) and the typically large scale of HB plants. As a result, economics will be driven by the capital cost of the HB synthesis loop and air separation units (when needed); especially at smaller scales. As a result, the development of small scale, and highly distributed production of e-NH3 would be challenging via this route. Further research on this front should focus on developing active catalysts that are highly selective at low temperatures and pressures to reduce the capital and operating costs of HB synthesis loop.80,81
On the other hand, room temperature electrochemical NH3 synthesis via one or two-step processes is still at its infancy and distant from commercialization.34In situ spectro-electrochemical studies and computational modelling will accelerate breakthroughs to develop efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Inspiration for catalyst design can come from the fast development of CO2 electrolysis and enzymatic catalysts.77,122 Apart from selectivity, production rate or current density is critical (Fig. 4B) for economic feasibility, which could be achieved by utilizing a flow cell configuration with gas diffusion electrodes to enable NH3 electrosynthesis at industrially relevant current density.93,122
One strategy to improve reaction kinetics is to perform NH3 electrosynthesis at elevated temperatures. This has been demonstrated using molten electrolytes with improved selectivity and productivity. However, long-term stability and side-reactions are challenges that need to be overcome. With the discovery of high temperature protonic conductors, solid-state electrochemical NH3 synthesis has been demonstrated, wherein N2 and the proton source (H2O, H2 or hydrocarbon) can be physically separated for practical and thermodynamic advantages.90,123,124 In a recent report, Kyriakou et al. demonstrated a simple and integrated protonic ceramic membrane reactor for low energy NH3 electrosynthesis at atmospheric pressure using methane, nitrogen and H2O by electrochemically incorporating essential HB steps.125 While the reported selectivity (5–14%) is low, such an integrated approach may lead to a 4× lower energy consumption and 50% lower carbon emissions as compared to the SMR-HB process.
Based on the reported results, the REFUEL target performance metrics are certainly ambitious that could be achieved to translate Stage 3 technologies from lab scale to the marketplace.103 Considering all these aspects as well as the projected price and carbon intensity of renewable electricity, we believe the century-old SMR-HB process (with or without CCS) will still dominate the NH3 industry for the next 20–30 years for large-scale production. However, the potential benefits of electrochemical routes, including low temperature and pressure operation, modular design, intermittent operation, improved energy efficiency and environmental benefits, will continue to usher the scientific community towards discovery research in order to make such an envisioned process viable. Alternative NH3 synthesis approaches including mechanochemical and plasma activated techniques have been emerging, which need to be evaluated in future system level analyses.126,127 Apart from technology innovation, policy instruments (e.g., carbon pricing) and government incentives to decarbonize energy and chemical industries are urgently needed towards the realization of a sustainable “ammonia economy” in the future.

Broader context
Human civilization has been built on the invention of century-old Haber–Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. With growing concern to preserve our environment, there is a need for a transition towards sustainable chemicals, including ammonia. To accelerate this transition, ammonia is also explored as an enabler towards a whole new energy landscape. Over the years, a number of sustainable ammonia synthesis routes have emerged including water electrolysis coupled Haber–Bosch process, and electrochemical ammonia synthesis. While the lab-scale demonstrated performance for these routes are encouraging, the field lacks a comparative system-level assessment. In particular, the economic feasibility and climate impacts of these sustainable synthesis routes as an alternative to the century-old Haber–Bosch process needs to be explored. Here we present a comparative assessment of three stages (based on technology readiness level and demonstrated scale) along the transition towards sustainable ammonia synthesis to provide a bird's-eye view of their economic feasibility and climate impacts over the incumbent Haber–Bosch process. This analysis reveals key economic drivers and sets target performance metrics for sustainable ammonia synthesis routes to be compelling in the future. We identify the remaining challenges and research priorities to make such envisioned pathways viable.

 	Fig. 2  Levelized cost of NH3 produced at different stages assuming an electricity price of $0.02 per kWh and a production rate of 100 tons per day. The teal square indicates the LCOA of small-scale (100 tons per day) SMR-HB considering a carbon tax ($50 per ton CO2).128 The orange square indicates the net LCOA of Stage 1 when a carbon credit is applied ($50 per ton CO2, which equals to $100 per ton NH3). The dashed pink box in Stage 2 shows the impact of additional capital cost (when driven by intermittent electricity with 25% capacity factor) due to the inclusion of additional H2O electrolyzers and H2 storage unit for continuous plant operation. The purple squares show the LCOA of one-step and two-step e-NH3 at 50% FE with revenue from co-production of H2 and O2.	 

 	Fig. 3  Cost analysis for NH3 synthesis pathways assuming an electricity price of $0.02 per kWh and a production rate of 100 tons per day. (A) Total capital intensity (i.e., total capital investment/plant annual production capacity) and (B) total operating cost breakdown for three different stages along with the incumbent SMR-HB process. Capital costs included equipment purchase, BoP, and contingency; operating costs considered labor, maintenance, and utility. A detailed breakdown is found in Fig. S15 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 4  Sensitivity analysis for Stage 3 (one-step e-NH3). (A) Levelized cost of NH3 (LCOA). (B) Operating current density and its impact on Capex, Opex and LCOA assuming an electricity price of $0.03 per kWh and a production rate of 100 tons per day. The I–V behavior (Fig. S22, ESI†) of NH3 electrolyzer was incorporated based on real world data of a Siemens water electrolyzer.129 Sensitivity analyses for all other stages are shown in Fig. S16–S21 (ESI†). The range of values for sensitivity analysis is summarized in Table S14 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 5  Required energy and cradle-to-gate CO2 footprint of small-scale (100 tons per day) NH3 production plant. (A) Energy consumption for all stages, red dashed horizontal line indicates the HHV (6.25 kWh kg−1) of NH3. (B) Cradle-to-gate CO2 emissions in each stage with various electricity CO2 emissions intensities. The horizontal grey area represents a typical range CO2 emissions from present-day SMR-HB process.22 Dashed arrows indicate the emissions from various sources (Table S17, ESI†), national projections are taken for US,113,130 EU,131 and Canada.132
