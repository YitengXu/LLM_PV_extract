    , Accepted 11th October 2021First published on 11th October 2021AbstractIntense efforts are currently being devoted to discovering cost-effective catalysts for the selective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Many advances have indeed been achieved in the design of molecular complexes containing second coordination chemical functionalities that have contributed to boosting the homogeneous electrocatalytic activity. The introduction of such chemical facets in heterogeneous catalysis is still lacking. Here, we report the electrocatalytic properties of a chemically modified electrode with a molecular iron-porphyrin catalyst holding urea functions (UrFe) in CO2 reduction, acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding cleft to enhance CO2 binding. The immobilization of UrFe on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/carbon paper (CP) allows the investigation of the catalytic performance in water. We found, herein, that the modified electrode displays excellent selectivity towards CO production in water, which is also acting as the sole proton source. Importantly, we observed one of the highest effective turnover frequency (eTOF) values (>21 s−1) at a potential of −0.78 V vs. RHE in comparison with similar modified electrode containing bare iron-porphyrin analogues. Our results therefore point to a remarkable gain in electrocatalytic performance of molecular catalysts at the surface of the electrodes with the added dimensionality of chemical functions operating as molecular clefts towards the binding and reduction of CO2.
1. Introduction
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into useful products, powered by renewable electricity, is a major challenge towards closing the carbon cycle.1 An alternative is to develop integrated systems that can realize the capture of photons to carry out the catalytic reactions.2 However, due to the intrinsic stability of the CO2 molecule, the use of a catalyst is needed to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of its reduction.3–5 In homogeneous catalysis, tunability of the catalyst by ligand design has contributed to the identification of important parameters that impact the catalyst performance.3–5 In this field, iron porphyrins are among the most active and selective catalysts for homogeneous CO2 electroreduction.6,7 Lessons from the crucial role played by the second coordination sphere in the reactivity of the Carbon Monoxide DeHydrogenase (CODH) active site,8–10 an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO, have incited molecular chemists to implement different functionalities on the periphery of iron porphyrins,11–15 such as a local proton source (i.e., phenols,6,16–18 carboxylic acids19), reaction intermediate stabilizers (ammonium cations20 and imidazolium moieties21,22) and H-bond donors (amides,23,24 guanidine,16 and triazoles23,25). These additional chemical features have successfully led to a significant decrease in the overpotential while improving the catalytic turnover numbers (TONs) and frequencies (TOFs). At this juncture, chemists are looking to bring molecular catalysts onto the surface of electrodes to develop hybrid systems for heterogeneous catalysis with the aim to develop compartmental (photo)cathodes to couple with a (photo)anode for the complete solar to fuel production.26–32 We have recently reported an iron-porphyrin catalyst (UrFe, see Fig. 1a) decorated with the urea groups inducing a multipoint, hydrogen-bonding pattern that greatly boosts CO2 reduction in organic solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) (Fig. 1a) with water as a renewable proton source.33 A detailed mechanistic study has shown that when a limited amount of water was added to DMF, in addition to improving CO2 capture by stabilizing the FeI–CO2− intermediates, the urea groups also participate in establishing a water molecule network that relays the protons necessary for the CO2 reduction.33,34 Here, we found that increasing the water content above 16% led to a drastic drop in the catalytic activity. This reverse effect results from the precipitation of the catalyst creating solubility issues; therefore, limiting the use of water as a medium for electrocatalysis. To overcome this hurdle, the approach that consists of confining molecular catalysts at the surface of electrodes offers the opportunity to combine the fine-tuning of molecular systems with the practicality of heterogeneous systems in the design of hybrid electrodes. In this configuration, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 can be performed in water as a clean and sustainable solvent and as a proton source. Molecular catalysts can be immobilized on the electrode surface by different means,14,35–38 including covalent grafting,39–46 electro-polymerization,47–50 physisorption, and electrostatic interaction.51–55 Among these methods, π–π physisorption on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is of particular interest to immobilize aromatic molecules, such as porphyrins, because they offer high stability, electrical conductivity and high surface area.28,56–61 We report a clear example of how the findings from enhancing CO2-to-CO electroreduction with bio-inspired second sphere functions at the molecular level can be further extended to heterogeneous catalysis. The modified electrode was prepared by depositing MWCNTs impregnated with a UrFe catalyst on the surface of carbon paper. Such a hybrid device enables the export of the synergistic effect operating from the urea groups and water molecules in homogeneous to heterogeneous catalysis under environmentally acceptable conditions. In light of a comparative study with a modified electrode based on the parent unsubstituted iron-tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP), the UrFe containing electrode exhibits higher selectivity for CO2-to-CO conversion with respect to H2 production with at least one order of magnitude higher TOF and marked stability. X-ray techniques support the molecular nature of the electrocatalytic events.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was purchased from Carlo Erba. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6), potassium chloride (KCl), perchloric acid (HClO4), and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, 6–9 nm diameter and 5 μm length, >95% carbon) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Toray carbon paper (TGP-H-60) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All of these chemicals were used as received without further purification. FeTPP was purchased from PorphyChem. Water was Milli-Q filtered (18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C). UrFe was prepared following the previously reported procedures.27
2.2 Apparatus
The UV-vis spectra of all the materials were obtained between 490 nm and 1000 nm on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a K Alpha spectrometer from Thermo Fisher, equipped with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα, 1486.6 eV) with a spot size of 400 μm. The hemispherical analyzer was operated in CAE (Constant Analyzer Energy) mode, with a pass energy of 200 eV and a step of 1 eV for the acquisition of surveys spectra, and a pass energy of 50 eV and 20 eV and a step of 0.1 eV for the acquisition of narrow spectra. A “dual beam” flood gun was used to neutralize the charge build-up. The spectra obtained were treated by means of the Avantage software, provided by Thermo Fisher. A Shirley-type background subtraction was used, and the peaks were analyzed using the mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian curves (70% of Gaussian character). C 1s spectra were further treated in order to eliminate the contribution of a carbon paper substrate. Binding energies were calibrated against the sp2 C binding energy set of 284.5 eV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Jeol 2100Plus operating at 200 kV. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were recorded on an FT-IR Perkin Spectrum Two spectrometer. The dry UrFe film on the surface of the ATR diamond accessory was obtained by dropcasting the dissolved UrFe molecule (before and after electrolysis) into dichloromethane and air-dried for 10 minutes. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data were collected on the LUCIA beamline of the Synchrotron SOLEIL at an electron energy of 2.7 GeV and a ring current of 500 mA. The incident photon energy was monochromatized by means of a Si(111) double crystal monochromator and the data were collected as fluorescence excitation spectra with a Bruker SDD detector. The samples were placed in the experimental chamber under vacuum, with a 20° outgoing angle with respect to the detector. Fluorescence data were normalized to the intensity of the incoming beam and reduced using the Athena software.
2.3 Preparation of CNT-UrFe and CNT-FeTPP

UrFe (6.4 mg, 3.5 × 10−3 M) and 6.4 mg MWCNTs were separately dissolved in 1 mL DMF and sonicated for 30 minutes. Then, the two suspension solutions were mixed together and sonicated for another 30 minutes and stirred overnight. The as-prepared ink was immediately used but can be stored in the fridge for a few days. The modified electrode was prepared by dropcasting the ink onto the surface of glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs, for CVs) or on carbon paper (CP, size 10 mm × 10 mm, for bulk electrolysis), and dried in a fume hood overnight to form a homogeneous film. Catalyst concentration on GCEs or on CP was found to be 52 nmol cm2. Electrodes with CNT-FeTPP were obtained using the same method.
2.4 Electrochemical characterization
All electrochemical experiments were performed on a Metrohm Autolab 302N potentiostat. Homogeneous cyclic voltammograms of UrFe were obtained using a three-electrode electrochemical cell, composed of a GCE working electrode, SCE reference electrode, and a platinum wire counter electrode. NBu4PF6 in DMF was utilized as the electrolyte.
For heterogeneous catalysis, all controlled potential electrolyses, galvanostatic, and cyclic voltammetry experiments were conducted in a homemade H-cell with a modified GCE or carbon paper working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and a platinum grid counter electrode with a large surface area. 0.1 M NaHCO3 in mQ water was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Potentials were converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) or reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for CVs or bulk electrolysis reference scale using the following formula:E(V vs. NHE) = Applied potential (V vs. SCE) + 0.244 VE(V vs. RHE) = Applied potential (V vs. SCE) + 0.244 V + 0.059 V × pH
2.5 Gas product analysis
Gas product analysis was performed using a Micro Gas Chromatography (Micro-GC) system obtained from the Chemlys company. The Micro-GC is composed of two parallel modules: module A is a plot column with a molecular sieve of 10 m length and module B is an RT-Q-bond column of 12 m length. A Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) is used to identify and quantify gas products. The instrument allows automatized sampling and it was calibrated for CO2, CO, and H2. The faradaic efficiency of all the experiments was determined by applying the Micro-GC analysis results in the following equation, where Q is the charge consumed in bulk electrolysis, n is the number of electrons for CO or H2 and F is the faradaic constant:  
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of water in homogeneous catalysis
For homogeneous catalysis, we have previously reported that the urea functions in the second coordination sphere of the UrFe catalyst provide a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme to bind and activate CO2 for its reduction to CO, which results in a remarkable drop in the overpotential of the catalytic reaction while conserving a high turnover frequency.33 Interestingly, water was found to be a better proton source in CO2-saturated DMF in comparison to the more acidic trifluoroethanol and phenol proton sources commonly used to accelerate CO2 electroreduction. Indeed, entrapped water molecules within the molecular clefts of UrFe were found to be responsible for routing the protons toward the metal active centre for CO2 reduction. We also determined that the protonation process was the rate limiting step of the catalysis. Thus, in order to increase the rate of the reaction, we thought of increasing the water content in DMF. Indeed, as shown in the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Fig. 1b, the current intensity at the third reduction wave that corresponds to the formal redox couple Fe0/I increases with the water proportion in a CO2-saturated DMF solution. However, maximum current intensity is reached at around 16% water in DMF before the current intensity starts diminishing (Fig. 1c and d). UV-vis analysis of the reaction media at different water proportions in DMF also reveals a severe drop in the intensity of the catalyst absorption bands at around 16% water content (Fig. 1c and d). This decrease was attributed to the precipitation of the catalyst in the presence of an increased water content. The normalization of the current intensity by the amount of soluble catalyst determined by UV-vis shows that the beneficial effect of water on the reaction rate is clearly limited by the solubility of the catalyst (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, the transition at around 16% water content that causes the precipitation of the catalyst also enhances the catalytic performance of the remaining soluble catalyst. This transition probably corresponds to the solvent reorganisation around the catalyst when water goes from solute to solvent as reported for other binary solvent mixtures.62 We also noticed a similar catalytic enhancement when switching from DMF to water as a solvent for CO2 electroreduction in the case of a water soluble iron-porphyrin catalyst.21
Two options can be considered to overcome the water solubility limitation of the metal-organic catalysts. The first option would introduce hydrophilic groups on the porphyrin rim, such as the ionic groups of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. However, in addition to the long tedious synthetic routes, their presence on the periphery of the porphyrin can induce significant changes in the electronic structure and reactivity pattern of the catalyst. The second option, examined in this study, is the immobilization of the catalyst on the surface of a working electrode as part of a heterogeneous electrochemical cell using water as a solvent and proton source. In addition to its fast and practical implementation compared to the synthetic modification approach, the heterogenization of the molecular catalyst also opens the way for the reaction scaleup device development for technological applications.
3.2 Modified electrode preparation and characterization
The catalytic ink employed in this study was prepared following the typical method by sonicating a mixture containing the iron porphyrin catalyst (UrFe) and MWCNTs in DMF.63 The loss of porphyrin's red color during the process is a clear indication of the successful MWCNT impregnation with the catalyst. The change in morphology from the smooth-walled MWCNTs to wrinkled walls (Fig. 2a and b), as observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), confirms the incorporation of the catalyst on the MWCNTs.

Prior to preparing the modified carbon paper electrode, the ink was dropcast onto a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon electrode for the first electrochemical evaluation. The CV of the CNT-UrFe catalyst in 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution under a CO2 atmosphere shows a significant increase in the reductive current at a potential ca. −0.4 V vs. NHE compared to that recorded under Ar (Fig. 2c). The current becomes more and more intense upon sweeping the potential to more negative values. Gas product analysis using gas chromatography (GC) during the controlled potential electrolysis at −0.88 V vs. RHE for 30 min revealed that CO is the major product with a faradaic efficiency higher than 78% (Fig. S1†). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the electrolyte excluded the formation of liquid products, such as formate, formaldehyde, or methanol during the electrolysis.
To increase the surface as well as the specific surface of the electrode, the CNT-UrFe ink was then dropcast onto the surface of a 10 × 10 mm carbon paper electrode, and the catalytic performances of the modified electrode were evaluated at controlled potential electrolysis experiments for CO2 reduction (i.e., at −0.48, −0.58, −0.68, 0.78, −0.88, and −0.98 V vs. RHE for 120 min). A stable current density was observed from −0.48 to −0.88 V during the total duration of the electrolysis (Fig. 3). At potentials more negative than −0.88 V, the current density becomes less stable, probably due to the alteration of the catalyst at the surface of the electrode (Fig. S2†). Results from GC monitoring of the gas products for 60 min show that the highest selectivity for CO production (99.9%) was at −0.78 V (Fig. 3b and Table S1†). The loss of stability and/or selectivity that occurs at potentials higher than −0.78 V lead us to lock further investigations at −0.78 V.

(f) XPS spectra for the N 1s region of CNT-UrFe/CP before (blue), after electrolysis (red), and deconvolution of N–CO (light red) and CN (cyan). 
Accordingly, we first investigated the stability of the catalyst during the electrolysis at −0.78 V. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra performed on the CNT-UrFe/CP electrode before and after electrolysis showed similar peaks for C 1s, N 1s, and F 1s, with extra peaks appearing after electrolysis and corresponding to Na 1s and O 1s coming, respectively, from NaHCO3 and water in the electrolyte, and Si 2s and Si 2p coming from sintered glass in the filters of the electrochemical cell (Fig. 3d). Notably, N 1s and C 1s high resolution spectra before and after electrolysis also show similar N–CO (urea), CN and C–F contributions (Fig. 3e and f), indicating that the electrolysis does not induce a major change in the catalyst structure. Unfortunately, because of the strong F 1s-loss signal (24 fluorine atoms per catalyst molecule), the Fe 1s peak cannot be observed. Bulk-sensitive X-ray absorption spectroscopy was further used to characterize the structure of our catalyst on the carbon nanotubes. We collected the Fe K-edge XANES spectra on the CNT-UrFe modified electrode before and after 2 hours of electrolysis (Fig. 3c). In both cases, pre- and rising-edge have identical energy positions with only minor spectral changes, probably due to the exchange of the chloride by a hydroxide axial ligand during the electrolysis. The XANES spectrum of the modified electrode after 2 hours of electrolysis was also compared to that of an Fe2O3 modified electrode, as well as metallic iron to exclude the formation of iron nanoparticles as a result of the catalyst degradation (Fig. S4†). No corresponding signatures to either Fe2O3 or metallic iron were evidenced, ruling out the presence of such species, and confirming the molecular nature of the catalytic species. The stability of the catalyst was also confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, corroborating that the catalyst does not undergo significant structural changes during the electrolysis (Fig. S5†).
3.3 Second sphere effect in heterogeneous catalysis
In homogeneous CO2-to-CO electrocatalytic reduction, the urea groups in UrFe were shown to induce multipoint hydrogen-bonding interactions with the substrate that lead to a better capture and a remarkable improvement of the catalytic performances. To examine if similar second coordination sphere effects are also operating under heterogeneous catalysis, the catalytic properties of the CNT-UrFe modified electrode were systematically compared to those of a similar electrode embarking CNT-FeTPP. Under similar controlled potential electrolysis experiments, the UrFe containing electrode exhibits four times higher current density than that of the electrode based on CNT-FeTPP (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, CNT-FeTPP still displays a significantly higher current density than when only MWCNTs are present on the surface of the electrode. GC analysis of gaseous products after a 2 hour electrolysis was performed, and revealed that CO is produced with more than 90% FE selectivity in the case of UrFe and nearing a low 60% FE for the FeTPP. In order to calculate the effective turnover frequency (eTOF) of the CNT-UrFe-modified electrode,65 the amount of electrochemically active catalyst on the surface of the electrode was determined to be 0.4 nmol cm−2 by integrating the peak of the FeIII/II redox couple, then matching this value with the amount of CO produced (Fig. S6†) gives an eTOF of 21 s−1 for a UrFe containing electrode, a value 20 times higher than that of an FeTPP-containing electrode (0.9 s−1). To the best of our knowledge, such catalytic activity places the UrFe as the catalyst with the highest reported eTOF value in the literature (Table 1). Thus, our results clearly outline the important impact of added functionalities, such as the hydrogen bond donor groups to enhance the electrocatalytic activity in heterogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, the selectivity for CO2-to-CO conversion was also improved by these functions over the side production of H2. UrFe also displays a better long-term stability than that of an FeTPP. Indeed, although the current density stays stable in both cases for 2 hours, the reaction selectivity for CO production drops from 85% at 30 min to less than 58% after 2 hours in the case of FeTPP, whereas over 90% selectivity is maintained for UrFe during the total time of the experiment (Fig. 4c).

To evaluate the scalability of our catalytic system, we performed galvanostatic electrolysis experiments at a fixed current density (1.8 mV cm−2) close to that observed in the optimized potentiostatic electrolysis experiments. Under these conditions, an average observed potential, similar to that applied in the optimized potentiostatic experiment (−0.78 V), can be maintained for more than 1 h with almost no drop in the faradaic efficiency (from 99.9%) of CO production (Fig. S10†). We then doubled the size of the modified electrode (from 1 to 2 cm2) and extended the experiment duration from 1 to 2 hours. When the current density is fixed at 1.8 mV cm−2, the larger electrode displays similar catalytic performances with a less than 10% drop in the faradaic efficiency, even after 2 hours of galvanostatic electrolysis and with an average observed potential of −0.78 V, which supports the compatibility of our catalytic system with larger-scale applications (Fig. S11†). Further optimization in the elaboration of the chemically modified electrode is needed to reach stability requirements for technological deployment.
4. Conclusions
Cost-effective catalysts and catalytic technologies for the conversion of CO2 to energy-rich molecules are the difficult challenges chemists must surmount in order to lead us towards sustainability. Important advancements in the design of molecular catalysts containing three-dimensional facets, as seen at active sites of enzymes, have boosted their electrocatalytic power. Molecular catalysts, with this added dimensionality on the surface of electrodes can, indeed, help to achieve better performances on different bases, such as selectivity, reaction rates, and stability. We have shown in this report that the presence of an added dimensionality of the urea groups that function as molecular clefts toward the binding of CO2, and the development of a network of hydrogen bonding with water molecules for conveying protons in homogeneous catalysis can also be applied to a heterogeneous system, which resulted in the highest eTOF of molecular catalyst at the surface of a carbon electrode reported, so far. The selective electrochemical performance towards CO production in comparison to the naked parent porphyrin derivative is also a salient feature. Furthermore, the gain in the stability of the modified electrodes upon electrocatalytic runs can be attributed to better management of the active CO2 form to prevent intramolecular alterations as recently reported.70
Our results, therefore, point to the remarkable gain when bringing added functionalities on molecular catalysts at the surface of electrodes. We are currently pursuing our efforts in bringing the best aspects from the design of homogeneous catalysts for the fabrication of a device for (photo)electrochemical CO2 conversion.
