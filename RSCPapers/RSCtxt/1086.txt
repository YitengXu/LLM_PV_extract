    , Accepted 31st March 2017First published on 3rd April 2017AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen are promising feedstocks for a sustainable chemical industry. Currently, the conversions of CO2 and hydrogen are most advanced for chemicals with 1 carbon atom, the so-called C1-chemicals, with the first pilot plants in operation. For formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol, and methane, CO2-based C1-chemicals can reduce the impacts of fossil depletion and global warming through the substitution of fossil-based processes. Existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies for carbon monoxide, methanol, and methane show that a reduction in environmental impacts is achieved if hydrogen is supplied by water electrolysis with renewable electricity. However, in the foreseeable future, renewable electricity will be limited. Thus, from an environmental point of view, renewable electricity should be employed for chemical processes in the order of highest environmental impact reductions. Environmental impact reductions are the difference in environmental impacts of fossil-based processes and CO2-based processes. In this study, we compared the CO2-based production of formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol, and methane. We determined the reduction of global warming and fossil depletion impacts using 1 kg of hydrogen. Our results show that the CO2-based production of formic acid achieves the highest environmental impact reductions, followed by carbon monoxide and methanol. The lowest environmental impact reductions are achieved for CO2-based methane production. Our analysis reveals that the CO2-based production of formic acid can reduce environmental impacts, compared to the fossil-based process, even if hydrogen is supplied by fossil-based steam-methane-reforming.
1. Introduction
The majority of bulk chemicals are organic compounds such as olefins (e.g. ethylene, propylene, benzene) and alcohols (e.g. methanol), which mainly consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Currently, these carbon and hydrogen atoms largely stem from fossil feedstocks, such as oil and natural gas.1,2 An alternative to these limited fossil feedstocks is CO2, which is abundantly available and an inexpensive carbon source;1,3–6 thus, conversion of CO2 to chemicals by catalysis,4,7–9 electrocatalysis4,10 and photocatalysis4,11 is drawing increasing attention. Currently, conversion of CO2 by catalysis is the most advanced and closest to industrial implementation.1,4,12
Catalytic CO2 conversion normally requires an additional highly energetic co-reactant to activate CO2 and thereby synthesize value-added chemicals. This co-reactant is usually hydrogen.13 In a one-step catalytic conversion, CO2 and hydrogen can be used to produce the following chemicals: formic acid (HCOOH),9,14,15 carbon monoxide (CO),9,16–20 formaldehyde (H2CO),9,21 methanol (CH3OH)9,22–25 and methane (CH4),26–28 which are henceforth named C1-chemicals, since they contain only 1 C atom. In subsequent reaction steps, these C1-chemicals can be converted into further bulk chemicals. For example, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas) can be converted to olefins via the Fischer–Tropsch reaction.7
The major motivation for utilization of CO2 as feedstock in the chemical industry is the substitution of fossil feedstocks such as oil and natural gas.1,2,4–6 Furthermore, CO2 utilization can avoid CO2 emissions; for example, if CO2 replaces other feedstocks with higher emissions.29 CO2 emissions are the primary cause of anthropogenic global warming. A suitable method to benchmark fossil depletion and global warming impacts of CO2-based processes to fossil-based processes is life cycle assessment (LCA).30
For CO2-based C1-chemicals, LCA case studies have been published for methanol,30–32 methane33–35 and carbon monoxide.34 All these case studies compare CO2-based processes to fossil-based processes, regarding global warming and fossil depletion impacts. For all considered C1-chemicals, the hydrogen supply determines whether a CO2-based process is environmentally beneficial, compared to the fossil-based process. In all case studies, the CO2-based processes are only environmentally beneficial if hydrogen is produced in electrolysis that uses renewable electricity. Putting this message positively, harnessing renewable energy via hydrogen and subsequent reaction with CO236 reduces the environmental impacts of the chemical industry. However, renewable electricity is currently very limited and almost exclusively used to replace fossil-based power plants. In 2015, about 27% of electricity generation in the EU-27 was based on renewable energy sources.37 Until 2050, the share of renewable energy sources is expected to rise to about 50%;37 thus, even in 2050, the availability of renewable electricity will still be limited. In addition, renewable electricity is required by numerous applications proposed in the last few years for heating, transportation and chemicals.38 Thus, for processes using renewable electricity, the reduction of environmental impacts, compared to fossil-based processes, is not sufficient as an indicator for environmentally promising processes. Rather, the processes that achieve the highest environmental impact reductions per unit of renewable electricity have to be identified. Currently such a ranking is missing from the literature and it is unknown which process enables the highest environmental impact reductions.
The goal of this paper is to present a method to rank CO2-based processes for C1-chemicals according to their environmental impact reductions. This information is important if the sustainable supply of hydrogen is constrained, e.g., by the availability of renewable energy.
Additionally, our method quantifies the maximum environmental impact of hydrogen supply, which still leads to a reduction in environmental impacts, compared to fossil-based processes. These threshold values allow us to identify alternative hydrogen supply processes, which are possibly not constrained.
In our analysis, we consider formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol and methane. For these C1-chemicals, CO2-based process concepts are available that have already been tested in pilot plants.22,26,39–41 Formaldehyde is not considered in this paper, because until now, the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to formaldehyde with molecular H2 has not been achieved.9 Currently, most proposed CO2 conversions to formaldehyde are based on the reduction of CO2 on metal hydride complexes instead of using molecular hydrogen.42–45
In section 2, we present the goal and the scope of the LCA. Section 3 gives an overview of the considered C1-chemicals, together with both their CO2-based and fossil-based production processes. In section 4, we derive and compare the maximum environmental impact reductions for all C1-chemicals. Furthermore, we identify hydrogen supply processes that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section 5.
2. Goal and scope of the LCA for C1-chemicals
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a systematic methodology to analyze the environmental impacts of products and processes.46 In this section, we describe the goal and scope of our LCA study for C1-chemicals.
2.1 Goal and scope definition

Goal. 
In this paper, we present a comparative life cycle assessment for the CO2-based production of formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol and methane. CO2 is converted using hydrogenation. In particular, this paper pursues the following 2 goals:
I. Comparison of the environmental impact reduction for all CO2-based processes. The reduction of environmental impacts results from the substitution of fossil-based processes by the CO2-based processes. The environmental impact reductions allow us to identify the CO2-based processes that achieve the greatest environmental benefit by using potentially limited hydrogen.
II. Determination of environmental threshold values for hydrogen supply processes. The environmental threshold values are the allowable impact of hydrogen supply processes that still lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes, compared to their corresponding fossil-based processes. Thus, the environmental threshold values for hydrogen supply can be used to identify hydrogen supply processes that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based process.


Approach and functional unit. 
To address both goals, we determine the maximum environmental impact reductions for CO2-based processes. The maximum environmental impact reductions (max EIreduction) are the difference between the environmental impacts of the fossil-based processes (EIfossil-based) and the CO2-based processes (EICO2-based):max EIreduction = EIfossil-based − EICO2-based (w/o EIH2 supply).
To obtain maximum reductions, we exclude the environmental impacts of hydrogen supply (w/o EIH2 supply). These maximum reductions thus correspond to an idealized scenario where hydrogen is emissions-free, e.g., from surplus power used in an existing water electrolysis cell. The determined maximum environmental impact reductions are thus a best case value. However, they can also be directly compared to the actual environmental impacts of any potential hydrogen source: if the source has higher impacts than the maximum environmental impact reduction, its use would not lead to an environmentally beneficial process. Potential hydrogen supply processes are presented in section 3.3.
The maximum environmental impact reductions can only be used to compare the CO2-based processes if they are determined on an equal basis. This equal basis is called the functional unit in LCA.47 In this paper, we chose the following functional unit (FU):
• Utilization of 1 kg hydrogen for CO2-based processes.
Through this functional unit, the maximum environmental impact reductions are presented per kg hydrogen used for the CO2-based processes; therefore, all CO2-based processes use the same amount of the potentially limited hydrogen (Goal I). Furthermore, the maximum environmental impact reduction per kg of hydrogen also corresponds to the allowable impact of hydrogen supply processes to still lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes, compared to their corresponding fossil-based processes (Goal II). Thus, the maximum environmental impact reduction is the environmental threshold value for hydrogen supply. The CO2-based processes are environmentally beneficial if the environmental impact of hydrogen supply is lower than the maximum environmental impact reduction.


System boundaries. 
The maximum environmental impact reductions are derived by comparing CO2-based processes for C1-chemicals to the corresponding fossil-based processes. For comparison, the fossil-based processes have to be adjusted to produce the same amount of C1-chemicals as the CO2-based processes, by using 1 kg hydrogen. For methane, the fossil-based process is adjusted to produce the same amount of energy, based on the lower heating value (LHV), as the CO2-based process. Methane is compared on an energy basis rather than mass, because CO2-based methane is compared to natural gas with different compositions and thus has different lower heating values.
In the comparison of CO2-based to fossil-based C1-chemicals, the use phase and end-of-life phase are identical and are therefore neglected. Thus, we use the so-called cradle-to-gate approach, considering only the upstream processes for both CO2-based and fossil-based processes for C1-chemicals (cf.Fig. 1). However, the supply of hydrogen is not included, as mentioned above.
 Fig. 1  System boundaries for CO2-based processes (top) and fossil-based processes (bottom). Note that the necessary supply processes vary for each C1-chemical, and not all C1-chemicals produce hydrogen as a by-product. NG – natural gas. 
The cradle-to-gate approach requires that each CO2-based and the corresponding fossil-based processes supply the same product (C1-chemical). However, besides the C1-chemical, the CO2-based and corresponding fossil-based processes can also produce non-common products; e.g., hydrogen is co-produced by the fossil-based production of carbon monoxide. In this case, the CO2-based processes have to be adjusted to produce the same amount of hydrogen per unit of carbon monoxide as the fossil-based processes.48 This approach is also called system expansion in LCA and recommended in ISO 14044:2006.49 Since carbon monoxide is a precursor of the conventional formic acid process, we use system expansion for the production of both carbon monoxide (products: carbon monoxide and hydrogen) and formic acid (products: formic acid and hydrogen). Consequently, for CO2-based production of carbon monoxide and formic acid, not the entire amount of 1 kg hydrogen is used in the CO2-based process to produce the corresponding C1-chemical. Rather, a share of the hydrogen is used to substitute hydrogen that is produced by the fossil-based processes (see also Fig. 2 in the main text and Table S9 in ESI†).

For CO2-based routes, the bottom x-axis shows the stoichiometrically required amount of hydrogen and the left y-axis the amount of stochiometrically produced water. For fossil-based routes, the right y-axis shows the stoichiometrically required amount of water and the top x-axis the amount of produced hydrogen. Solid lines represent reactions and dashed lines represent purification processes. 


Environmental indicators. 
In this paper, we derive impact reductions for global warming (GW) and fossil depletion (FD). These impact categories are chosen because they reflect the major motivation for CO2-based processes. The environmental impacts are determined according to ReCiPe 1.08 Midpoint (Hierarchist).50
The assessment of further impact categories is also very important, but not considered in this paper. A sound analysis of other impact categories requires a detailed analysis of hydrogen supply, which is outside the scope of this paper, because all considered processes use the same amount of hydrogen.

3. CO2-based and fossil-based processes for C1-chemicals
This section gives an overview of the C1-chemicals studied and their corresponding production processes. Process concepts are described for CO2-based and fossil-based processes in sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. In section 3.3, supply processes are presented for the required feedstocks and utilities.

Fig. 2 shows an overview of all C1-chemicals that can be produced solely from CO2 and hydrogen. For formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol and methane, process concepts are already available for direct production from CO2, i.e., without producing another C1-chemical as intermediate.22,26,39–41 So far, a process concept for the direct catalytic reaction from CO2 to formaldehyde is not available. However, formaldehyde can be produced from CO2 by a combination of CO2-based methanol production and the conventional methanol to formaldehyde process.51 In this case, the environmental impact reductions for methanol also apply to formaldehyde, because formaldehyde is also traditionally produced from methanol. Thus, the utilization phase of methanol does not change if CO2-based methanol is used for formaldehyde production. For the production of 1 mol of C1-chemicals, all CO2-based routes stoichiometrically require 1 mol of CO2. The required amount of hydrogen is presented on the bottom x-axis of Fig. 2.
For the fossil-based routes, all C1-chemicals stoichiometrically require 1 mol of methane. Methane can be converted in a one-step reaction to a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (so-called syngas). Carbon monoxide is a feedstock for formic acid production. Syngas is a feedstock for methanol production. In turn, methanol is used to produce formaldehyde. Stoichiometrically, the following fossil-based processes produce hydrogen as by-product: methanol (1 mol), formaldehyde (2 mol), carbon monoxide (3 mol) and formic acid (3 mol). Thus, for the substitution of the fossil-based processes by CO2-based processes, hydrogen is not only required for CO2-based production of C1-chemicals, but also to substitute the hydrogen, which is co-produced in the fossil-based processes. Considering the co-produced hydrogen, each CO2-based process, presented in Fig. 2, requires 4 mol of hydrogen for the complete substitution of the fossil-based process, which produces 1 mol C1-chemical and co-produces hydrogen. Ultimately, all CO2-based processes require 4 mol hydrogen and 1 mol CO2 to substitute 1 mol fossil-based methane as feedstock (see also Table S10 in ESI†).
However, for a reliable assessment, more information than just the stoichiometric reaction is required, e.g., the actual conversion and the process energy demand. For this purpose, our comparative life cycle assessment is based on process simulations considering thermodynamic properties. Since each reaction step has conversion losses and requires additional process energy, the overall energy demand per mole of C1-chemical increases with the number of reaction steps. Here, the CO2-based route offers an advantage: all considered C1-chemicals can be produced directly from CO2.
3.1 CO2-based processes for C1-chemicals
This section gives an overview of CO2-based process concepts for C1-chemicals. The processes are presented in the order of increasing hydrogen demand per mole of CO2 used (cf.Fig. 2). For each C1-chemical, the key process steps are mentioned. A more detailed description of each proposed process is available in Table S1 in the ESI.† The process data from the process simulations considered for our life cycle assessment are presented in Tables S2–S7.†

Formic acid (HCOOH). 
The equimolar conversion of CO2 and hydrogen yields formic acid:CO2 + H2 ⇌ HCOOH.
The reaction of gaseous CO2 and hydrogen to liquid formic acid is endergonic (ΔG° = 32.9 kJ mol−1). The formic acid synthesis can be made exergonic through the use of bases such as tertiary amines (NR3), which react with formic acid52,53 forming an amine formic acid adduct (NR3–HCOOH):CO2 + H2 + NR3 ⇌ HCOOH–NR3.
In a subsequent process step, the amine formic acid adduct is converted to formic acid and the tertiary amine:HCOOH–NR3 ⇌ HCOOH + NR3.
In particular, the bases trimethylamine (NEt3)54,55 and trihexylamine (NHex3)56,57 are used in patented processes. However, the use of an amine alone is not always sufficient to make the reaction exergonic;52 a solvent could be necessary to stabilize the formic acid base adduct. In a recent BASF patent,56,57 a mixture of the solvents methanol and water is used.
In this work, we consider 2 process simulations for the patented BASF process concept from Pérez-Fortes and co-workers,58 and from our own group.59 The 2 process simulations differ predominantly in the hydrogen conversion rate (see Table S2 in ESI†).


Carbon monoxide (CO) via reverse water gas-shift (rWGS). 
Carbon monoxide can be synthesized from CO2 by the so-called reverse water-gas-shift reaction (rWGS):CO2 + H2 ⇌ CO + H2O.
The reaction temperature of most proposed process concepts varies between 650 and 1100 °C.18,20,60 For a reaction temperature of 650 °C, low pressure is required to achieve sufficient conversion of CO2. For 1100 °C, the pressure can be elevated up to 30 bar. The rWGS reaction yields a raw gas, which mainly contains carbon monoxide, CO2, water and hydrogen.
In most published case studies for the rWGS reaction, the raw gas is used as feed for the Fischer–Tropsch reaction.18,20 In this case, only water removal is required. For the supply of pure carbon monoxide, a more complex raw gas treatment is required, including the removal of unreacted CO2 and hydrogen.16
For the environmental assessment, process data is considered from the project CO2RRECT.16 In CO2RRECT, an electrical heating concept is considered for the reactor. In the present work, we additionally consider heating by steam.


Carbon monoxide (CO) via dry reforming of methane (DRM). 
As an alternative to the rWGS reaction discussed above, a further CO2-based process for carbon monoxide production is the dry reforming of methane (DRM). Here, carbon monoxide is synthesized from CO2 and methane. The DRM reaction produces carbon monoxide and hydrogen with a molar ratio of 1:CO2 + CH4 ⇌ 2CO + 2H2.
Typical reaction temperatures and pressures are 900–1000 °C and 4–5 bar, respectively.16,60 Process concepts for the DRM reaction exist for the supply of a feed gas for Fischer–Tropsch,60 and for pure carbon monoxide and pure hydrogen.16 For the supply of pure carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the raw gas treatment is similar to the rWGS process design. However, an additional purification step is required to supply pure hydrogen.
As for the rWGS process, data is used from the project CO2RRECT,16 where the reactor is heated electrically. For our environmental assessment, 2 concepts to heat the reactor are considered: electrical heating and by steam.


Methanol (CH3OH). 
Methanol can be produced from CO2 and hydrogen according to the following reaction:CO2 + 3H2 ⇌ CH3OH + H2O.
The published process simulations consider reaction temperatures ranging from 210 to 250 °C and reaction pressures from 50 to 75 bar.23–25 After the reaction, the raw gas is first cooled down and flashed to separate the gaseous compounds (carbon monoxide, CO2 and hydrogen) from condensable compounds (methanol and water). The gaseous compounds are recycled to the reactor. Methanol is separated from the water in a distillation column. The heat from the exothermic reaction can be integrated into the reboiler of the distillation column.
For the environmental assessment, we consider process data from Kiss and co-workers,23 Rihko-Struckmann and co-workers,24 and Van-Dal and co-workers.25 The considered processes differ in reaction conditions and product separation (see Table S1 in ESI†).


Methane (CH4). 
CO2 can react with hydrogen to produce methane according to the Sabatier reaction:CO2 + 4H2 ⇌ CH4 + 2H2O.
Reaction conditions in the proposed process are in the range of 280–300 °C and 5–8 bar.27,28 Müller and co-workers27 present a process concept where only water removal is required before the so-called substitute natural gas (SNG) can be fed into the natural gas grid. The SNG contains 88 vol% methane, 6 vol% hydrogen and 6 vol% CO2. In the process of De Saint Jean and co-workers,28 the additional removal of CO2 and hydrogen is considered before the water is removed and the SNG is fed into the natural gas grid. The SNG contains 96.8 vol% methane, 1.6 vol% hydrogen and 1.6 vol% CO2.
Both process concepts from Müller and co-workers27 and De Saint Jean and co-workers28 are considered for the environmental assessment.

3.2 Fossil-based processes for C1-chemicals
This section gives a brief overview of industrially established fossil-based processes for C1-chemicals. The processes presented in this section are chosen as fossil-based reference processes for the CO2-based processes. The inputs and outputs of the fossil-based processes are presented in Table S7 in the ESI.† The C1-chemicals are presented in the order of increasing reaction steps (cf.Fig. 2).

Natural gas. 
The fossil counterpart of CO2-based methane is natural gas. Raw natural gas is a naturally occurring gas mixture that is recovered from underground deposits. Raw natural gas mainly contains methane (75–99 vol%).61 Before natural gas is supplied to consumers, water and impurities such as sulfur and mercury are removed. The natural gas is compared here to CO2-based methane on a lower heating value (LHV) basis. In the main text, we consider the natural gas supply mix of the European Union (EU-27) for 2012. In the ESI,† we additionally consider natural gas supply mixes from countries with highest (Portugal) and lowest (The Netherlands) environmental impacts in the EU-27.


Carbon monoxide (CO). 
Pure carbon monoxide is typically produced by separating it from syngas. Thus, carbon monoxide is co-produced with hydrogen and/or syngas.62 The industrial standard process for syngas production is steam-methane-reforming (SMR):63CH4 + H2O ⇌ CO + 3H2.
For carbon monoxide production, the SMR reaction is typically carried out at 850–900 °C and 10–30 bar.62 After the reaction, the raw gas contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen, CO2, water and methane. The molar H2/CO ratio in the raw gas typically ranges from 4 to 5 if only methane and water are used as feed to the reactor. The molar H2/CO ratio can be decreased to about 3 if CO2 from the raw gas is recycled to the reactor. To examine the effect of the molar H2/CO ratio on the results, we consider 2 fossil-based processes for carbon monoxide production with different molar H2/CO ratios from CO2RRECT16 (H2/CO = 3) and Baltrusaitis and Luyben60 (H2/CO = 4.4).


Methanol (CH3OH). 
Conventional methanol production consists of the following 2 reaction steps:
(i) Production of syngas. The syngas for methanol production mainly contains hydrogen, carbon monoxide and CO2. The syngas composition strongly affects the methanol yield. The composition of the syngas is described by the so-called stoichiometric number (SN):  where y is the concentration in volume percent. A stoichiometric number SN = 2 corresponds to the stoichiometric demand of reactants for methanol synthesis. For methanol production, the majority of syngas is produced by:
(a) Steam-methane-reforming: The stoichiometric number (SN) of syngas from steam-methane-reforming is typically between 2.6 and 2.9,64i.e., the syngas contains too much hydrogen for methanol synthesis. After the methanol synthesis, a hydrogen-rich purge gas is separated from the methanol stream. The hydrogen-rich purge stream is usually used for heating purposes, rather than purified to hydrogen.
(b) Combined reforming: In the combined reforming process, 40–60% of the natural gas feed is reformed by steam-methane-reforming (SMR). The remaining 60–40% of natural gas feed is reformed with oxygen and the syngas of the SMR in an autothermal reformer. The resulting syngas achieves a stoichiometric number of SN ≈ 2.64
(ii) Methanol synthesis. For the methanol synthesis, the syngas is converted into methanol according to the following reactions:CO + 2H2 ⇌ CH3OH,CO2 + 3H2 ⇌ CH3OH + H2O.
The syngas is converted into methanol at about 200–300 °C and 50–100 bar.64 In the reactor, about 50% of syngas is converted to methanol. The unreacted syngas is recycled to the reactor after methanol and water are condensed out. The pure methanol is separated from water in a distillation column.
For fossil-based methanol production, we consider both a high-efficiency and a low-efficiency process according to the ecoinvent database.65 The high-efficiency process corresponds to syngas production by combined reforming and the low-efficiency process corresponds to syngas production by steam-methane-reforming. Both considered fossil-based process concepts do not produce hydrogen as a by-product.


Formic acid (HCOOH). 
Conventionally, formic acid is primarily produced by the hydrolysis of methyl formate.66 The methyl formate hydrolysis process consists of the following reaction steps:
(i) Production of carbon monoxide (see above).
(ii) Carbonylation of methanol. Methanol is carbonylated in the liquid phase with carbon monoxide at about 45 bar and 80 °C:66CH3OH + CO ⇌ HCOOCH3.
(iii) Hydrolysis of methyl formate. In the equimolar conversion of methyl formate and water, only about 30% of methyl formate is converted. The hydrolysis is equilibrium limited, thus the conversion can be increased by a large excess of either methyl formate or water.HCOOCH3 + H2O ⇌ HCOOH + CH3OH
For the purification of the resulting product mixture, mainly 2 concepts exist:
(a) Utilization of 2 distillation columns
(b) Extraction using a secondary amide to extract formic acid from the aqueous solution, before final purification by distillation.
For our analysis, the conversion of carbon monoxide to formic acid (step ii and iii) is modeled according to data from ecoinvent.67 Since only data for 1 process route is available, no high-efficiency and low-efficiency process route can be identified for the conversion of carbon monoxide to formic acid. For the supply of carbon monoxide (step i), we consider both fossil-based processes discussed above (H2/CO ratio = 3 and 4.4).

3.3 Feedstock and utility supply
The process demands for feedstock and utilities presented in the previous subsections are used to determine the environmental impacts of CO2-based and fossil-based processes for C1-chemicals. In this section, we present the selected supply processes for feedstock and utilities (heat, electricity). The environmental impacts of the supply processes are taken from the LCA-database GaBi.68

Natural gas supply. 
In the main text, the EU-27 natural gas mix is applied. In the ESI (Fig. S5–S8†), we additionally consider natural gas mixes from countries with highest (Portugal) and lowest (The Netherlands) environmental impacts in the EU-27.


Heat supply. 
Heat is supplied by steam, which is generated by a natural gas boiler with an efficiency of 90%.68


Electricity supply. 
For the electricity demand of the CO2-based and fossil-based processes, we consider a forecasted electricity mix of the EU-27 for 2020 from the LCA-database GaBi.68


CO2 supply. 
A range of supply processes is considered, because there is currently no standard CO2 supply process established for large-scale CO2 utilization in the chemical industry. We categorize the CO2 supply processes into the following 2 groups:
• CO2capture from flue gas. CO2 is part of the flue gas of all fossil-fired power plants and many industrial processes, such as chemicals and cement production. For the supply of captured CO2, our group3 recently determined the impacts for global warming (−0.99 to −0.42 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2) and fossil depletion (0.00–0.19 kg oil-eq per kg CO2). The environmental impact of each CO2 capture process is based on a comparison to a corresponding process without CO2 capture. For example, a coal-fired power plant with CO2 capture is compared to a coal-fired power plant without CO2 capture. The global warming impact is negative, because the process with CO2 capture has a lower global warming impact than the process without CO2 capture.
• Air capture. The air capture process removes CO2 from the air and supplies captured CO2. The CO2 concentration in air is about 400 ppm, which is significantly lower than that in flue gases from industrial processes. Thus, the energy demand for CO2 capture from air is higher than from flue gas. The higher energy demand results in higher global warming and fossil depletion impacts than for CO2 capture from flue gases. The global warming impacts for air capture range from −0.58 to −0.42 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2. The fossil depletion impacts range from 0.16 to 0.24 kg oil-eq per kg CO2.3
Thus, to include all CO2 sources analysed in the previous work,3 we consider the following ranges for CO2 supply in the main text:
• Global warming impact: −0.42 to −0.99 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2,
• Fossil depletion impact: 0 to 0.24 kg oil-eq per kg CO2.
In the ESI (Fig. S4†), we extend the considered range of global warming impacts for CO2 supply (0 to −1 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2). A global warming impact of zero for CO2 supply corresponds to the utilization of CO2 that would otherwise be stored underground (CCS). A global warming impact of −1 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2 corresponds to the utilization of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted in pure form.


Hydrogen supply. 
In the following, several hydrogen supply processes are presented to relate the maximum environmental impact reductions to existing and proposed hydrogen supply processes:
• Steam-methane-reforming (SMR). Currently, the most used process for hydrogen production is steam-methane-reforming with a subsequent water-gas-shift reaction.69 For Germany, the global warming and fossil depletion impact of hydrogen supply by SMR is 10.6 kg CO2-eq and 4.5 kg oil-eq per kg hydrogen.68
• Hydrogen from thermal utilization. Hydrogen is a by-product of many chemical processes. In large interconnected chemical plants, the hydrogen by-product is used as feedstock for other chemical processes. However, some processes, e.g., chlor-alkali electrolysis, produce hydrogen in excess. In this case, hydrogen is usually used as fuel for heating purposes.70 This hydrogen could be used as feedstock for CO2 hydrogenation. However, using by-product hydrogen as feedstock requires an alternative source for the heat supplied before by hydrogen, e.g., heat from natural gas. In this case, the environmental impact of supplying 1 kg hydrogen equals the environmental impact of supplying 33.3 kWh heat (lower heating value of hydrogen) from natural gas. In this case, the global warming and fossil depletion impacts of hydrogen supply are 7.9 kg CO2-eq and 3.1 kg oil-eq per kg hydrogen, respectively.
• Water electrolysis. The environmental impact of hydrogen from water electrolysis predominantly depends on the efficiency of the electrolysis and the environmental impact of employed electricity. Considering a state-of-the art efficiency of 50 kWh per kg H2 for a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis,71 the global warming impact for the supply of 1 kg hydrogen ranges from 0.4 kg CO2-eq (wind electricity) to 18.5 kg CO2-eq (grid mix EU-27 in 2020). The corresponding fossil depletion impact ranges from 0.12 to 4.95 kg oil-eq per kg of H2.

4. Environmental impact reductions for CO2-based processes
In this section, the impact reductions for global warming and fossil depletion are derived for the C1-chemicals: in section 4.1, the environmental impacts of CO2-based processes are analyzed and compared to fossil-based process. In section 4.2, the maximum global warming impact reduction is explained in detail for CO2-based formic acid production. In section 4.3, we compare the maximum environmental impact reductions for all considered C1-chemicals. Finally, hydrogen supply processes are identified that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes in section 4.4.
4.1 Environmental impacts of CO2-based and fossil-based processes

Fig. 3 shows the global warming impacts of CO2-based and fossil-based processes for formic acid (3a), carbon monoxide (3b & 3c), methanol (3d) and methane (3e). For the CO2-based processes, a breakdown of the global warming impacts is shown. In Fig. 3, a global warming impact for CO2 supply of −0.7 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2 is considered (mean of the considered range for CO2 supply). For the breakdown analysis, we consider the global warming impacts of hydrogen supply by steam-methane-reforming (10.6 kg CO2-eq per kg H2). For all C1-chemicals, at least 2 CO2-based process concepts are considered (see section 3.1). Consequently, a range of global warming impacts is shown in Fig. 3 (error bars). The global warming impact due to hydrogen supply is equal for all considered CO2-based processes, because all processes use exactly 1 kg of hydrogen (functional unit). For the CO2-based production of formic acid, methanol and methane, the yield from 1 kg of hydrogen varies due to the different process concepts considered. Thus, we present a range for the global warming impact of the fossil-based processes, which reflects the varying amount of C1-chemicals. In this section, the CO2-based processes are benchmarked against the fossil-based processes with the highest global warming impacts, i.e., the worst case for fossil-based processes. In the next sections, the worst case and the best case are considered for the fossil-based processes to determine the maximum environmental impact reduction. The fossil depletion impacts of CO2-based and fossil-based processes are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 3  Breakdown of global warming (GW) impacts per functional unit (FU = use of 1 kg hydrogen) for CO2-based processes for (a) formic acid, (b) carbon monoxide via rWGS, (c) carbon monoxide via DRM, (d) methanol and (e) methane. For CO2 supply, a global warming impact of −0.7 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2 is considered. The hydrogen is supplied by fossil-based steam-methane-reforming. The error bars of the CO2-based processes represent the range of considered process concepts. The right bar represents fossil-based processes with the highest global warming impacts (worst case). The range of the fossil-based processes is due to different yields of C1-chemicals from the considered CO2-based processes. The average yield is shown in the right bar. 

Formic acid. 
The global warming impact of the CO2-based process ranges from 11.8 to 12.6 kg CO2-eq per FU. The majority of the global warming impact is due to hydrogen supply (10.6 kg CO2-eq per FU). The global warming impact of CO2 supply is about −3.6 kg CO2-eq per FU. Heat and electricity supply account for about 5.1 kg CO2-eq per FU. Compared to other CO2-based processes, the contribution of heat supply is high, because of the complex product purification. While the environmental impacts of the 2 considered CO2-based processes are almost equal, the amount of produced products differs by about 14%. This is due to different overall hydrogen conversion rates for the CO2-based formic acid process.
Due to the different amounts of products for the CO2-based processes, the global warming impact per FU of fossil-based formic acid (H2/CO ratio = 3) ranges from 12.6 to 14.5 kg CO2-eq per FU. The global warming impact per FU of the fossil-based process is highest among all considered fossil-based processes for C1-chemicals and higher than the global warming impact of the CO2-based formic acid production. For fossil-based formic acid, process energy demand and conversion losses represent a high share of the total global warming impact (92%). The global warming impact of the natural gas supply that is required as feedstock (86–98 MJ per FU) only accounts for about 8% of the total global warming impacts.


Carbon monoxide (rWGS). 
The total global warming impact (9.4 kg CO2-eq per FU) of the rWGS process is dominated by the global warming impact of the hydrogen supply (10.6 kg CO2-eq per FU) and CO2 supply (−3.8 kg CO2-eq per FU). The impact due to heat and electricity supply is about 2.6 kg CO2-eq per FU. The difference between the 2 considered rWGS process concepts is the heat supply for the reactor (electricity vs. natural gas). Both processes produce the same amount of product per kg of hydrogen used.
The global warming impact of the fossil-based process (H2/CO ratio = 3) is about 6.0 kg CO2-eq per FU. For fossil-based carbon monoxide, the global warming impacts due to heat and electricity supply account for about 81%. The supply of natural gas used as feedstock (100 MJ per FU) accounts for 19% of total global warming impacts.


Carbon monoxide (DRM). 
The global warming impact of the DRM process is about 12.1 kg CO2-eq per FU. Note that this value cannot be compared to the rWGS process, because the DRM process produces almost twice the amount of product (see Fig. 3). The majority of the global warming impact is due to the hydrogen supply (10.6 kg CO2-eq per FU). Additionally, natural gas (0.9 kg CO2-eq per FU) and CO2 (−3.8 kg CO2-eq per FU) are required as feedstocks. As for the rWGS process, 2 concepts for reactor heating (electricity and natural gas) are considered. Since the DRM reaction is more endothermic than the rWGS reaction, the range of the total global warming impact is larger for the DRM process than for the rWGS process.
The global warming impact of the fossil-based process (H2/CO ratio = 3) is about 10.5 kg CO2-eq per FU. Thus, the global warming impact of DRM is only 1.6 kg CO2-eq per FU higher than the global warming impact of the fossil-based process.


Methanol. 
For CO2-based methanol production, the total global warming impact is in the range of 7.3–8.4 kg CO2-eq per FU. As for other CO2-based processes, the majority of the global warming impact is due to hydrogen supply (10.6 kg CO2-eq per FU). For methanol production, the contribution of CO2 supply (−5.1 kg CO2-eq per FU) to the total global warming impact is highest among all the CO2-based processes. The range of the total global warming impact is mainly due to different electricity demands in the proposed process concepts. The main difference in the process concepts is the pressure drop after the flash and the resulting electricity demand for the compressor of the recycling stream. Furthermore, the amount of produced methanol differs by up to 8% in the considered CO2-based processes.
Accordingly, the total global warming impact of the fossil-based methanol production ranges from 5.3–5.7 kg CO2-eq per FU. The fossil-based processes require about 123–133 MJ natural gas per FU as feedstock. This value is higher than for fossil-based formic acid and carbon monoxide (rWGS), because the considered fossil-based processes for methanol do not produce hydrogen as a by-product. Thus, the CO2-based processes do not have to produce hydrogen as by-product and can use the total feed of hydrogen for methanol production (cf. section 3.2). Consequently, more natural gas is required to produce the same amount of methanol in the fossil-based process. The supply of natural gas used as feedstock accounts for about 26% of the total global warming impacts.


Methane. 
The global warming impact of the CO2-based process varies from 7.7–8.9 kg CO2-eq per FU. The total global warming impact is mainly dominated by hydrogen supply (10.6 kg CO2-eq per FU) and CO2 supply (−4.0 kg CO2-eq per FU). Due to different product purification concepts, the electricity demand of the 2 considered CO2-based processes for methane ranges from 0.7 to 2.0 kg CO2-eq per FU. For both process concepts, the amount of produced methane is almost equal (about 100 MJ per FU).
The global warming impact for the natural gas supply mix in the EU-27 is 1.1 kg CO2-eq per FU. For fossil-based methane, the global warming impact is 100% from the supply of natural gas.
In summary, the global warming impacts for all CO2-based C1-chemicals range from 7.3–12.6 kg CO2-eq per FU. The CO2-based production of formic acid has the highest impacts and the CO2-based production of methanol has the lowest impacts.
For the fossil-based C1-chemicals, the global warming impacts range from 1.1–14.5 kg CO2-eq per FU. Here, the fossil-based production of formic acid also has the highest impacts. The fossil-based production of methane has the lowest impacts.
The wide range of the global warming impacts of the fossil-based processes is primarily due to different process energy demands. For example, the fossil-based processes for formic acid, carbon monoxide (rWGS) and methane require almost the same amount of natural gas as feedstock per FU (86–100 MJ). The supply of natural gas results in global warming impacts of about 1 kg CO2-eq per FU. The fossil-based production of methane does not have any further global warming impacts. The fossil-based carbon monoxide production causes an additional 5 kg CO2-eq per FU through heat and electricity demand. The fossil-based formic acid production even causes an additional 12–14 kg CO2-eq per FU, because the fossil-based production of formic acid requires 3 reaction steps (when starting with CH4) and a complex product purification (see also Fig. S2 in ESI†). For fossil-based methane, carbon monoxide and formic acid, the global warming impacts increase with the number of reaction steps (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Number of reaction steps and global warming impacts (GW) for CO2-based and fossil-based routes for methane, carbon monoxide and formic acid. The global warming impacts of the CO2-based routes include hydrogen supply by steam-methane-reforming. The CO2-based routes of CO and HCOOH include the additional supply of hydrogen that is co-produced in the fossil-based processes. 

4.2 Introduction of maximum environmental impact reductions
In this section, the determination and interpretation of the maximum environmental impact reductions is presented exemplarily for formic acid (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Maximum global warming (GW) impact reduction for CO2-based formic acid processes per kg hydrogen used (top axis). The black solid line (i) shows the maximum GW reduction for average data for CO2 supply and the CO2-based process. The gray box (ii) represents the range for the maximum GW reduction considering the range for the global warming impact of CO2 supply (−0.42 to −0.99 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2), while average process data is used for the CO2-based process. The error bars (iii) show the full range for the maximum GW reduction, considering the range for the global warming impact of CO2 supply and the range for the process data. On the bottom axis, global warming impacts (GW) of different hydrogen supply processes are presented. 
For CO2-based formic acid, the maximum global warming impact reduction is 12.0 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. This value assumes average data for CO2 supply and the CO2-based processes (see (i) in Fig. 5). If a best case (−0.99 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2) and a worst case (−0.42 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2) for CO2 supply is considered, the maximum global warming impact reduction ranges from 10.5 to 13.5 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (see (ii) in Fig. 5). If the variation due to the CO2-based process concepts is also considered, the maximum global warming impact reduction ranges from 9.3 to 14.9 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (see (iii) in Fig. 5).
The maximum environmental impact reduction can be used to address both goals of this paper:
(I) Comparison of the environmental impact reduction for CO2-based processes. The maximum environmental impact reductions can be directly used to rank the environmental impact reductions of CO2-based processes. The actual environmental impact reductions (i.e., including hydrogen supply) are not required if all processes use the same hydrogen source, because all processes use the same amount of hydrogen (= functional unit, FU). The environmental impact reductions are compared in section 4.3 for all considered CO2-based processes.
Additionally, the actual environmental impact reduction for each CO2-based process can be determined by subtracting the environmental impact of hydrogen supply from the maximum environmental impact reduction (see Fig. 5).
(II) Determination of the environmental threshold values for hydrogen supply. The maximum environmental impact reductions can be used as threshold values for hydrogen supply. In other words, if the maximum environmental impact reduction for CO2-based formic acid is higher than the global warming impact of hydrogen supply, the CO2-based formic acid production has lower global warming impacts than the fossil-based formic acid production.
If the best case for technology and CO2 supply is considered, CO2-based formic acid production achieves lower global warming impacts than the fossil-based formic acid production for all hydrogen supply processes that have a global warming impact lower than 14.9 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. Thus, the CO2-based formic acid production is environmentally beneficial, even if hydrogen is supplied by steam-methane-reforming (10.6 kg CO2-eq per kg H2).
However, if the worst case for technology and CO2 supply is considered, the maximum global warming impact reduction from CO2-based formic acid production decreases to 9.3 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. In this case, the supply of hydrogen by steam-methane-reforming would result in higher global warming impacts for the CO2-based process than for the fossil-based process.
If hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis using wind electricity, CO2-based formic acid always reduces global warming impacts compared to fossil-based processes. If hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis using EU-27 grid mix in 2020, CO2-based formic acid always increases global warming impacts compared to fossil-based processes.
An overview is presented in section 4.4 of the hydrogen supply processes that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes for all considered CO2-based processes.
4.3 Comparison of maximum environmental impact reductions
In this section, the maximum impact reductions are presented for global warming and fossil depletion of all considered C1-chemicals: formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol and methane. For each C1-chemical (except methane), maximum impact reductions are presented by comparison to 2 benchmarks. For formic acid and carbon monoxide, the 2 maximum impact reductions are derived by comparison to fossil-based carbon monoxide production with the 2 following H2/CO ratios: 3 and 4.4. For methanol, the 2 maximum impact reductions are derived by comparison to a low and a high efficiency fossil-based process. The low efficiency process is related to syngas production by steam-methane-reforming and the high efficiency process, to syngas production by combined reforming. For methane, we consider the EU-27 natural gas supply mix (for details see section 3.2).

Maximum impact reductions for global warming range from 1.4 to 14.9 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 for the considered C1-chemicals (Fig. 6). The highest maximum global warming impact reductions are achieved for CO2-based formic acid and the lowest for CO2-based methane. Fig. 6 reveals the hydrogen supply processes that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes for each C1-chemical: all hydrogen supply processes (dashed-dotted vertical lines) that are on the left side of the maximum impact reduction lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes. If the vertical line of a hydrogen supply process intersects the maximum impact reduction range, the CO2 supply determines whether a CO2-based process is environmentally beneficial. The CO2 supply can affect the maximum impact reduction by up to 4.2 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (for methanol). The identification of hydrogen supply processes that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes is presented in more detail in section 4.4.
 Fig. 6  Maximum global warming (GW) impact reductions depending on CO2 supply. The boxes consider the global warming impact of CO2 supply from −0.42 (left side of box) to −0.99 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2 (right side of box). The error bars consider the full range of processes (cf.Fig. 5). On the bottom axis, the maximum global warming impact reductions are presented per kg H2. On the top axis, the maximum global warming impact reductions are presented per kWh electricity. In this case, hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis with an energy demand of 50 kWh per kg H2. The dashed-dotted vertical lines show hydrogen supply processes. 

Formic acid. 
The CO2-based formic acid process achieves the highest maximum global warming impact reductions for all considered CO2-based processes. The high maximum global warming impact reductions for CO2-based formic acid are primarily due to the high environmental impact of the fossil-based process.
If carbon monoxide for the fossil-based formic acid production is supplied by SMR (H2/CO = 3), the maximum global warming impact reduction ranges from 9.3 to 14.9 kg CO2-eq per kg H2.
If carbon monoxide for the fossil-based formic acid production is supplied by SMR (H2/CO = 4.4), the maximum global warming impact reduction ranges from 9.7 to 13.9 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. The range of the maximum global warming impact reduction is smaller than for the fossil-based process with SMR (H2/CO = 3), because more hydrogen is required for the CO2-based process and thus the influence of CO2 supply decreases.


Carbon monoxide (rWGS). 
The maximum global warming impact reductions range from 5.6 to 8.9 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 if fossil-based carbon monoxide is supplied by SMR (H2/CO = 3). If fossil-based carbon monoxide is supplied by SMR (H2/CO = 4.4), the maximum global warming impact reductions range from 7.1 to 9.5 kg CO2-eq per kg H2.
In other words, the rWGS process is environmentally beneficial if hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis using wind or solar electricity, but it is not environmentally beneficial if hydrogen is supplied by steam-methane-reforming. If hydrogen from thermal utilization is employed for rWGS, the CO2 supply determines whether rWGS is environmentally beneficial or not.


Carbon monoxide (DRM). 
The maximum global warming impact reductions range from 7.1 to 11.1 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. Both fossil-based reference processes lead to a similar upper boundary of the maximum global warming impact reductions. However, the lower boundary is higher if fossil-based carbon monoxide is produced by SMR (H2/CO = 4.4) than by SMR (H2/CO = 3).
If the DRM process uses a very efficient CO2 supply process (GW < −0.9 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2), the DRM process can even be environmentally beneficial if hydrogen is supplied by steam-methane-reforming.
The heat supply for the reactor in the DRM process can change the maximum global warming impact reductions by about 0.7 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (error bars). The highest maximum global warming impact reduction is achieved if the reactor is heated with steam instead of electricity. The influence of the reactor heating is larger than for the rWGS process, because the DRM reaction is more endothermic.


Methanol. 
For CO2-based methanol, the maximum global warming impact reductions range from 3.7 to 11.0 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. The broad range is caused by both the CO2-based and fossil-based processes: on the one hand, the influence of the global warming impact of CO2 supply is highest among all CO2-based processes. On the other hand, the range for the efficiency of fossil-based processes is also very large. If a very low-efficiency fossil-based process is replaced and an efficient CO2 source is used, the CO2-based methanol production can even be environmentally beneficial if hydrogen is employed from steam-methane-reforming.


Methane. 
CO2-based methane has the lowest maximum global warming impact reductions of all considered C1-chemicals. Here, only hydrogen from electrolysis using wind electricity leads to impact reductions for all considered scenarios. The supply of hydrogen by electrolysis using solar electricity is not sufficient if CO2 is supplied by air capture. The CO2-based methane process is the only process that cannot be environmentally beneficial if hydrogen from thermal utilization is employed.
In the ESI,† the maximum global warming impact reductions are also shown for national natural gas supply mixes with lowest (Fig. S5†) and highest (Fig. S6†) global warming impacts in the EU-27. A change in the natural gas supply affects the maximum global warming impact reductions of all considered C1-chemicals, because all fossil-based processes use natural gas as feedstock. If the natural gas supply mix with lowest global warming impacts (The Netherlands) is applied, the maximum global warming impact reductions for all C1-chemicals decrease between 0.8 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (methane) and 1.7 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (formic acid). The maximum global warming impact reductions decrease, because the natural gas supply with low global warming impacts mainly benefits the fossil-based processes. If the natural gas supply mix with highest global warming impacts (Portugal) is applied, the maximum global warming impact reductions increase between 0.7 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (methane) and 1.6 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 (formic acid).

Maximum impact reductions for fossil depletion range from 0.8 to 5.8 kg oil-eq per kg H2 for the considered C1-chemicals (Fig. 7). The results correspond very well to the maximum global warming impact reductions. The order of the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions is exactly the same as for global warming.
 Fig. 7  Maximum fossil depletion (FD) impact reductions depending on CO2 supply. The boxes consider a fossil depletion impact of CO2 supply from 0.25 (left side of box) to 0 kg oil-eq per kg CO2 (right side of box). The error bars consider the full range of processes (cf.Fig. 5). On the bottom axis, the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions are presented per kg H2. On the top axis, the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions are presented per kWh electricity. In this case, hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis with an energy demand of 50 kWh per kg H2. The dashed-dotted vertical lines show hydrogen supply processes. 
The main difference between global warming and fossil depletion impact reductions is that all CO2-based processes, except methane, have the potential to achieve lower impacts than fossil-based processes, even if hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis with grid mix in 2040 & 2050.
In the ESI,† the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions are also shown for the Dutch (Fig. S7†) and the Portuguese natural gas supply mixes (Fig. S8†). If the Dutch natural gas supply mix is applied, the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions decrease between 0.20 kg oil-eq per kg H2 (methane) and 0.38 kg oil-eq per kg H2 (formic acid). If the Portuguese natural gas supply mix is applied, the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions increase between 0.15 kg oil-eq per kg H2 (methane) and 0.32 kg oil-eq per kg H2 (formic acid).

4.4 Identification of hydrogen supply processes that lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes
In this section, the maximum environmental impact reductions are used as threshold values for hydrogen supply processes. Table 1 illustrates for each combination of hydrogen supply process and CO2-based process whether the respective CO2-based process is environmentally beneficial or not.

• Environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes. In this case, the hydrogen supply process is such that the CO2-based process is environmentally beneficial, compared to the fossil-based process for all considered scenarios, i.e., variations in CO2 supply, process data of CO2-based processes and fossil-based processes. Mathematically speaking, the environmental impact of hydrogen supply is lower than the lower boundary of the maximum environmental impact reduction.
• Not environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes. In this case, the hydrogen supply process is such that the CO2-based process is not environmentally beneficial for any considered scenario. Mathematically, the environmental impact of hydrogen supply is higher than the upper boundary of the maximum environmental impact reduction.
• Potentially environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes. In this case, the hydrogen supply process is such that the CO2-based process is environmentally beneficial for some, but not all scenarios. Mathematically, the environmental impact of hydrogen supply is between the lower and the upper boundaries of the maximum environmental impact reduction. In this case, the environmental impact of CO2 supply predominantly determines whether the CO2-based processes are environmentally beneficial or not.
If the 2012 EU-27 electricity mix (GW = 0.46 kg CO2-eq per kWh) is employed for electrolysis, no CO2-based C1-chemical achieves lower global warming impacts than fossil-based processes. In Fig. 8, we analyze national electricity mixes for Europe. For carbon monoxide, only the CO2-based production via DRM is considered (best case). Environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes are already achieved in countries where the electricity mix is dominated by nuclear power (France and Belgium), renewable power (Iceland and Norway), or a mix of renewable and nuclear power (Sweden and Switzerland). To actually reduce global warming impacts, it has to be ensured that the production of CO2-based products does not lead to additional electricity demand that is supplied by a power plant with a higher global warming impact than the national electricity mix. For Iceland, the production of CO2-based C1-chemicals is a further option to export renewable electricity besides the electricity interconnection to the United Kingdom currently discussed.72
 Fig. 8  Overview of European countries where CO2-based processes have the potential to achieve lower global warming impacts than fossil-based processes by using the national electricity mix of 2012 and an electrolysis unit with an efficiency of 50 kWh per kg H2. Green-colored (+) and yellow-colored (○) countries have the potential to achieve lower global warming impacts for CO2-based production of C1-chemcials, compared to fossil-based production. For green-colored C1-chemicals, the national electricity mix is lower than the calculated lower boundary of maximum global warming impact reductions for the corresponding C1-chemcial. For yellow-colored C1-chemicals, the national electricity mix is within the range of maximum global warming impact reductions. For red-colored (−) countries, the national electricity mix is higher than the upper boundary of maximum global warming impact reductions for all C1-chemcials. For carbon monoxide, only the CO2-based production via DRM is considered (best case). 
5. Conclusions
In this paper, CO2-based and fossil-based process concepts are analyzed based on life cycle assessment for the following C1-chemicals: formic acid, carbon monoxide, methanol and methane. Our analysis derives the maximum impact reductions for global warming and fossil depletion for the CO2-based processes. The maximum environmental impact reduction is the difference between the environmental impact of the fossil-based processes and the CO2-based processes without considering the environmental impact of hydrogen supply (“free” hydrogen). The maximum environmental impact reduction is presented per kg hydrogen supplied to the CO2-based processes to identify the CO2-based process making the best of hydrogen.
The comparison of the maximum environmental impact reductions for the CO2-based processes (Goal I of this paper) is crucial, since most CO2-based processes are only environmentally beneficial if hydrogen from renewable electricity is used, which is currently limited. From an environmental point of view, hydrogen supplied by currently limited renewable electricity should thus be employed for C1-chemicals in the order of highest environmental impact reductions.
Our results show that the CO2-based production of formic acid achieves the highest environmental impact reductions followed by carbon monoxide and methanol. Lowest environmental impact reductions are achieved for CO2-based methane production. Thus, among the CO2-based processes considered, the production of formic acid should be preferred if the supply of hydrogen from renewable energy is limited.
Furthermore, the maximum environmental impact reductions act as threshold values for hydrogen supply processes (Goal II of this paper); the environmental threshold values are the allowable impacts of hydrogen supply processes that still lead to environmentally beneficial CO2-based processes, compared to fossil-based processes.
Our analysis reveals that water electrolysis in combination with renewable electricity is not always mandatory to achieve CO2-based processes with lower environmental impacts than the fossil-based processes. In particular, the CO2-based production of formic acid and methanol have the potential to reduce impacts for global warming and fossil depletion, compared to the fossil-based processes, even if hydrogen is supplied by steam-methane-reforming. The CO2-based production of carbon monoxide via DRM has the potential to reduce global warming impacts, but not fossil depletion impacts, if hydrogen is supplied by steam-methane-reforming.
From the presented analysis, we conclude why the CO2-based processes for formic acid, carbon monoxide (via DRM) and methanol are particularly environmentally promising:
• Formic acid: While all considered C1-chemicals can be produced in 1 reaction step from CO2, the reaction steps for the fossil-based processes differ. Fossil-based formic acid production requires the most reaction steps (cf.Fig. 4). As a result, the fossil-based formic acid production has the highest environmental impacts per mole among all considered fossil-based processes.
• Carbon monoxide via DRM: While all other CO2-based processes stoichiometrically produce 1 mol of C1-chemical from 4 mol hydrogen and 1 mol CO2, the DRM process produces 2 mol of carbon monoxide, due to the additional utilization of methane as feedstock (cf. Table S10 in ESI†). Thus, for a fixed hydrogen input, the DRM process can replace more fossil-based C1-chemicals than the other CO2-based processes.
• Methanol: CO2-based methanol production requires only about 3 mol hydrogen to replace 1 mol fossil-based methanol (cf. Table S10 in ESI†). Thus, the CO2-based methanol production requires about 1 mol less hydrogen to replace 1 mol fossil-based C1-chemical, compared to the other CO2-based processes (except the DRM process). However, our results show that the decreased hydrogen demand is not sufficient to ensure environmentally promising CO2-based processes: if CO2-based methanol replaces a very efficient fossil-based process (e.g., syngas production by combined reforming), CO2-based methanol is the second worst option to reduce environmental impacts. Only the substitution of low efficiency fossil-based processes (e.g., syngas production by steam-methane-reforming) leads to high environmental impact reductions.
The findings of this analysis should be helpful in identifying promising directions for research on CO2-based chemicals. In particular, CO2-based chemicals seem most promising if the number of reaction steps and intermediate separations is decreased, compared to the corresponding fossil-based route. Thus, the one-step CO2-based production of formaldehyde would also seem to be very promising because the number of reaction steps is decreased, compared to the current fossil-based process.

 	Fig. 1  System boundaries for CO2-based processes (top) and fossil-based processes (bottom). Note that the necessary supply processes vary for each C1-chemical, and not all C1-chemicals produce hydrogen as a by-product. NG – natural gas.	 

 	Fig. 2  Overview of C1-chemicals and their CO2-based and fossil-based reaction routes. For CO2-based routes, the bottom x-axis shows the stoichiometrically required amount of hydrogen and the left y-axis the amount of stochiometrically produced water. For fossil-based routes, the right y-axis shows the stoichiometrically required amount of water and the top x-axis the amount of produced hydrogen. Solid lines represent reactions and dashed lines represent purification processes.

 	Fig. 3  Breakdown of global warming (GW) impacts per functional unit (FU = use of 1 kg hydrogen) for CO2-based processes for (a) formic acid, (b) carbon monoxide via rWGS, (c) carbon monoxide via DRM, (d) methanol and (e) methane. For CO2 supply, a global warming impact of −0.7 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2 is considered. The hydrogen is supplied by fossil-based steam-methane-reforming. The error bars of the CO2-based processes represent the range of considered process concepts. The right bar represents fossil-based processes with the highest global warming impacts (worst case). The range of the fossil-based processes is due to different yields of C1-chemicals from the considered CO2-based processes. The average yield is shown in the right bar.	 

 	Fig. 4  Number of reaction steps and global warming impacts (GW) for CO2-based and fossil-based routes for methane, carbon monoxide and formic acid. The global warming impacts of the CO2-based routes include hydrogen supply by steam-methane-reforming. The CO2-based routes of CO and HCOOH include the additional supply of hydrogen that is co-produced in the fossil-based processes.	 

 	Fig. 5  Maximum global warming (GW) impact reduction for CO2-based formic acid processes per kg hydrogen used (top axis). The black solid line (i) shows the maximum GW reduction for average data for CO2 supply and the CO2-based process. The gray box (ii) represents the range for the maximum GW reduction considering the range for the global warming impact of CO2 supply (−0.42 to −0.99 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2), while average process data is used for the CO2-based process. The error bars (iii) show the full range for the maximum GW reduction, considering the range for the global warming impact of CO2 supply and the range for the process data. On the bottom axis, global warming impacts (GW) of different hydrogen supply processes are presented.	 

 	Fig. 6  Maximum global warming (GW) impact reductions depending on CO2 supply. The boxes consider the global warming impact of CO2 supply from −0.42 (left side of box) to −0.99 kg CO2-eq per kg CO2 (right side of box). The error bars consider the full range of processes (cf.Fig. 5). On the bottom axis, the maximum global warming impact reductions are presented per kg H2. On the top axis, the maximum global warming impact reductions are presented per kWh electricity. In this case, hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis with an energy demand of 50 kWh per kg H2. The dashed-dotted vertical lines show hydrogen supply processes.	 

 	Fig. 7  Maximum fossil depletion (FD) impact reductions depending on CO2 supply. The boxes consider a fossil depletion impact of CO2 supply from 0.25 (left side of box) to 0 kg oil-eq per kg CO2 (right side of box). The error bars consider the full range of processes (cf.Fig. 5). On the bottom axis, the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions are presented per kg H2. On the top axis, the maximum fossil depletion impact reductions are presented per kWh electricity. In this case, hydrogen is supplied by electrolysis with an energy demand of 50 kWh per kg H2. The dashed-dotted vertical lines show hydrogen supply processes.

 	Fig. 8  Overview of European countries where CO2-based processes have the potential to achieve lower global warming impacts than fossil-based processes by using the national electricity mix of 2012 and an electrolysis unit with an efficiency of 50 kWh per kg H2. Green-colored (+) and yellow-colored (○) countries have the potential to achieve lower global warming impacts for CO2-based production of C1-chemcials, compared to fossil-based production. For green-colored C1-chemicals, the national electricity mix is lower than the calculated lower boundary of maximum global warming impact reductions for the corresponding C1-chemcial. For yellow-colored C1-chemicals, the national electricity mix is within the range of maximum global warming impact reductions. For red-colored (−) countries, the national electricity mix is higher than the upper boundary of maximum global warming impact reductions for all C1-chemcials. For carbon monoxide, only the CO2-based production via DRM is considered (best case).
