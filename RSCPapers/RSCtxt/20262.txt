    , Accepted 11th March 2019First published on 19th March 2019AbstractThermal decomposition of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely used to prepare metal catalysts for various applications. In most cases, severe metal agglomeration occurs due to the high decomposition temperature, which causes loss of active catalytic sites. In this work, we report a distinct decomposition pattern of a Ni based MOF (Ni MOF-74) in low temperature NH3 plasma. Ni MOF-74 grown on Ni foam is converted into a monolithic electrode with a carambola-like hierarchical 3D structure composed of ultrafine Ni nanocrystals (only 2.5 nm in diameter) encapsulated in a thin layer of N-doped carbon. The unique structure is attributed to the combination of highly reactive N species and the low thermal effect of low temperature NH3 plasma. High catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction from water electrolysis is demonstrated for this MOF-derived catalyst, which is applied in a solar cell driven water electrolysis-hydrogen fuel cell system.
Introduction
There is a strong motivation to replace noble metals by earth abundant elements in various catalytic applications for both economical and scientific reasons.1–3 However, this target is very challenging as the intrinsic activity of noble metals is much higher compared to non-noble metal catalysts in many catalytic processes. A general guideline to improve the performance of heterogeneous catalysts is to create high density catalytic sites. Therefore, it is feasible to compensate for the gap of the intrinsic catalytic activity by creating a higher density of catalytic sites in non-noble metal catalysts through innovative preparation methods.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed via coordination interaction between metal ions/clusters and organic ligands, in which metal sites are highly ordered and atomically distributed. Using MOFs as versatile precursors/sacrificial templates offers exciting opportunities to obtain novel catalysts with various nanoscale morphologies, from 0D (e.g. polyhedra and hollow structures), 1D (e.g. rods and tubes), 2D structures (e.g. sheets, ribbons and sandwiches) to 3D structures (e.g. arrays, frameworks and honeycomb-like structures).4 Despite the inevitable destruction of the framework structure, MOF-derived catalysts are also highly attractive due to their more robust structure and higher electrical conductivity compared to pristine MOFs. Excellent performance in both thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis has been extensively reported.5–9
So far MOF-derived catalysts have been most often obtained by high temperature (typically 500–900 °C) thermal decomposition of MOFs. For electrocatalysis, a sufficiently high temperature is particularly necessary to convert organic ligands into carbon materials with good electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, high temperature thermal decomposition inevitably leads to metal aggregation and the key merit of MOFs for catalysis is lost.10–13 Many efforts are devoted to promoting the metal dispersion in MOF-derived catalysts. For example, Zn based bimetallic MOFs are used to obtain highly dispersed metal sites on porous carbon materials, taking advantage of the high volatility of Zn for its selective removal at high temperatures.14,15 Metal aggregation can be mitigated at lower conversion temperature. Our group demonstrated that NH3 can effectively reduce the decomposition temperature of MOFs by chemical fragmentation of organic ligands,16,17 indicating that the thermal effect for MOF decomposition can be partly compensated for by the chemical reactivity in the gas phase.
This discovery inspires us to further explore low temperature MOF conversion methods for efficient MOF-derived catalysts. In this work, we use low temperature NH3 plasma to control the decomposition pathway of a Ni based MOF (Ni MOF-74). Low temperature plasma combines high chemical reactivity and a low thermal effect, which has been used for non-destructive modification of framework structures.18,19 The NH3 plasma exhibits a unique “thermal shock” effect at only 300 °C, which leads to efficient MOF decomposition without significant metal aggregation. Ni MOF-74 grown on Ni foam is converted into a monolithic electrode with a carambola-like hierarchical 3D structure composed of ultrafine Ni nanocrystals (∼2.5 nm in diameter) encapsulated in a thin layer of N-doped graphene. High catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction from water electrolysis is demonstrated for this MOF-derived catalyst.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization of the Ni MOF-74 derived catalysts
The Ni MOF-74 (Ni2(dhtp), H4dhtp = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) is grown on Ni foam (NF) through a solvothermal reaction by using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, H4dhtp in a 1:1:1 (v/v/v) mixture of DMF–ethanol–water solution, which shows a yellowish color. Formation of Ni MOF-74 is confirmed by XRD (Fig. 3a). The thermogravimetric analysis curves show that the decomposition of the framework starts from 300 °C and is near complete at 400 °C (Fig. S2†). N2 gas sorption analysis at 77 K shows a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 1043.2 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3†). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image confirms that the Ni MOF-74 sample is composed of many spindle shaped particles with diameters of ≈1 μm which cover the Ni foam uniformly (Fig. 1b and Fig. S4†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration showing the different conversion patterns of Ni MOF-74 by NH3 plasma modification and by direct heating in NH3. NH3 plasma modification largely retains the 3D structure of the pristine MOF and yields ultrafine Ni particles. Direct heating in NH3 causes complete collapse of the 3D structure of the pristine MOF and the obtained Ni particles are much larger. (b–g) SEM images of different samples: (b) pristine Ni MOF-74, (c and d) NH3-plasma, and (e and f) NH3-thermal sample. (g) SEM image of the Ar-plasma sample. 
The Ni MOF-74/NF is treated with inductively coupled low pressure Ar–NH3 plasma (Ar/NH3 = 1:2, total pressure ≈50 Pa, and input power = 120 W) at 300 °C for 1 h (denoted as NH3-plasma). After plasma treatment, the sample turns black while remaining monolithic (Fig. S1†). The weight of the samples can be estimated by measuring the difference between bare Ni foam and carbonized products on Ni foam, and the resultant mass loadings are 1.1 ± 0.4 mg cm−2. XRD shows that the plasma treated sample is composed of metallic Ni. The diffraction peaks are significantly broadened, indicating a very fine crystallite size (Fig. 3b). SEM images suggest that the round spindle shaped particles are transformed into a “carambola-like” structure with much sharper edges composed of particles of around 20 nm (Fig. 1c). The HRTEM image reveals that the primary particles are only 2–3 nm in diameter encapsulated in a few layers of graphitized carbon (Fig. 2a and d). The resolved lattice fringes are in excellent agreement with those of metallic Ni (Fig. 2e).
 Fig. 2  TEM and HRTEM images of the different samples. (a, d and e): NH3-plasma, (b) NH3-thermal, and (c and f) Ar-plasma. Size distribution histograms and electron diffraction patterns are shown in the insets of (a–c). 
The effect of plasma and NH3 is studied by comparative experiments. Ni MOF-74/NF is thermally treated at 300 °C in an Ar–NH3 flow without plasma (denoted as NH3-thermal) and with Ar plasma at 300 °C (denoted as Ar-plasma). In both cases, broad diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Ni are observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3b). NH3-thermal exhibits a very different morphology (Fig. 1e and f). The spindle shaped structure of the Ni MOF-74 is almost completely collapsed into randomly distributed irregular particles. TEM and SAED suggest that the sample is also composed of Ni nanoparticles encapsulated in a few layers of graphitized carbon, while the Ni particle size (∼10 in diameter) is larger compared to that of the NH3-plasma sample (Fig. 2b). A similar carambola morphology is observed for Ar-plasma, while the surface is much smoother compared to that of NH3-plasma (Fig. 1g). The HRTEM image suggests that the sample is also composed of ultrafine Ni particles (∼4 nm in diameter) (Fig. 2c), while the Ni particles are embedded in a continuous amorphous matrix (Fig. 2f).

The different thickness of the carbon layer is in agreement with the elemental analysis result (Table S1†). The carbon percentage is 20 wt%, 10 wt% and 7.3 wt% for the Ar-plasma, NH3-thermal and NH3-plasma samples, respectively. A notable N content is also detected in the samples obtained in NH3, 1.4 wt% and 2.2 wt% for the NH3-thermal and NH3-plasma samples, respectively. The above difference is consistent with our previous study showing the carbon removal and N doping effects of NH3 during thermal decomposition of MOFs.16,17 It is worth noting that the above effects are further enhanced by NH3 plasma, as demonstrated by the lower carbon percentage and higher N/C ratio in the NH3-plasma sample.
The obtained samples are further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. S8†) exhibits two contributions, 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, indicating that Ni in the three MOF derived samples is mainly in the metallic state, which agrees well with the XRD and HRTEM results (Fig. 3b and 2e). In addition, the N 1s spectra of the samples obtained in NH3 (Fig. 3d) can be fitted with four peaks. The presence of the peaks at 398.0, 400.5, and 403.5 eV can be attributed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and oxidized N, respectively,20–22 indicating most N is doped into the carbon layer. The N content detected by XPS is 6.5 at% and 3.5 at% for the NH3-plasma and NH3-thermal samples, which is in agreement with the elemental analysis results. The above results confirm the role of NH3 as an effective N-doping source.

Fig. 3c shows the Raman spectra of the three Ni MOF-74 derived samples. The spectra can be deconvoluted into four bands (I, D, D′′ and G), in which both D and D′′ bands are used as indicators of defects of carbon materials. The G band is related to the defect-free sp2 carbon network and the I band is caused by some ionic impurities. The D and D′′ bands represent defects within the graphene layer and the stacking disorder of graphene layers, respectively.23,24 The intensity ratios ID/IG, ID′′/IG and ID+D′′/IG are summarized in Fig. S6.† The ID+D′′/IG ratio is used to describe the defect level in the carbon layer, which increases in the order Ar-plasma, NH3-thermal and NH3 plasma. It is worth noting that the N content increases in the same order. This direct correlation indicates that N doping also introduces defects in carbon.
Electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction
The Ni MOF-74 derived catalysts are evaluated for use in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water electrolysis in alkaline solution (1 M KOH), an important reaction for renewable hydrogen production. Linear scan voltammetry (LSV) curves in a three-electrode configuration are shown in Fig. 4a. The NH3-plasma sample shows the highest HER performance. To attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the NH3-plasma sample requires an overpotential of only 61 mV, while 180 mV and 187 mV are needed for the NH3-thermal and Ar-plasma samples, respectively. Fig. 4b presents the corresponding Tafel plots. The Tafel slope of NH3-plasma is 89 mV dec−1, much lower than that of the NH3-thermal sample (210 mV dec−1) and Ar-plasma sample (160 mV dec−1). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Fig. S13†) also suggests that the charge transfer impedance of NH3-plasma is much smaller than that of the other two samples.

(c–h) More detailed evaluation of the HER performance of the NH3-plasma catalyst: (c) quantification of H2 generated by electrolysis, (d) polarization curves of the two-electrode electrolyzer (with and without iR compensation) together with the I–V curve of the Si solar cell under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2), (e) chronopotentiometry at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 18 h, (f) TEM image after the stability test, (g) photo of the solar cell driven water electrolysis-hydrogen fuel cell system composed of a polycrystalline Si solar cell and an electrolyzer operating under a Xe lamp (100 mW cm−2), and (h) the energy loss split of the solar-to-hydrogen system. 
The NH3-plasma sample shows excellent operational stability. The overpotential only slightly increases from 61 to 71 mV after chronoamperometry at 10 mA cm−2 for 18 h (Fig. S14†). The potential is also very stable at different current densities from 10 to 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. S15†). Even at high current densities there is little degradation in performance and the potential can be rapidly restored when the current density returns to 10 mA cm−2 from 100 mA cm−2. The TEM image of the sample after 18 h electrolysis (Fig. 4f) shows that the highly dispersed ultrafine Ni@NC nanoparticles are well maintained. The evolved H2 from the NH3-plasma electrode is quantified, which agrees well with the theoretical value, indicating a near 100% Faraday efficiency of the HER process (Fig. 4c).
The NH3-plasma catalyst is used in a solar cell driven water electrolysis-hydrogen fuel cell demo system (Fig. 4g). Driven by a commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cell, the evolved H2 can be collected and stored in a gas tank. When the solar irradiation is stopped, the stored hydrogen can be converted into electrical power via a hydrogen solar cell (see the Video in the ESI†). This system is a vivid demonstration how low cost water electrolysis can serve as an effective energy storage and output regulation technology for sustainable clean energy.
The OER catalyst is also a plasma modified Fe/Co bimetallic cyanide framework reported in our previous work.18Fig. 4d shows the I–V curve of the electrolyzer under simulated AM 1.5 conditions (the power of the Xe lamp is 100 mW cm−2). To reach a current density of 103 mA cm−2, the operating voltage is 1.93 V and the iR drop corrected voltage is only 1.78 V. As shown in Fig. 4e, the cell voltage remains stable during 18 h electrolysis with a high current density. Detailed energy utilization is analyzed in Fig. 4h. The operational efficiency is 64% at 103 mA cm−2. The overpotential of the HER accounts for 10% of the efficiency loss, only about half that of the OER (21%), indicating that the MOF-derived Ni based catalyst prepared with low temperature NH3 plasma is very promising to replace Pt based HER catalysts.
Correlation between the structure and HER performance
NH3 plasma treatment of Ni MOF-74 results in an ultrafine Ni particle size of only 2.5 nm in diameter. The metal particle size in most MOF derived M@C composites is typically above 10 nm. The much smaller Ni particle size of NH3-plasma compared to those in other MOF-derived M@C catalysts is a straightforward origin for its high HER performance. In addition, NH3 plasma treatment largely retains the shape of the pristine Ni MOF-74 particles: the carambola shape of NH3-plasma can be regarded as a slight shrinkage of the spindle shaped pristine Ni MOF-74 particles. The whole electrode remains intact without any binder. The hierarchical 3D electrode structure will promote the accessibility of water molecules to the catalytically active sites and ensure good electrical contact with the Ni foam substrate, which is also favourable for the HER performance.
Another important effect of NH3 plasma treatment is enhanced N doping in carbon compared to conventional heating in NH3. The three MOF-derived catalysts have distinct N doping levels in the carbon layer. N doped carbon materials have been extensively studied for electrocatalysis.16,25–28 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out to understand the effect of synergy between N-doped carbon and the encapsulated Ni particles on the HER activity. A Ni30 cluster encapsulated in a C180 cage is built for the modelling (Fig. S18†). N doping is modelled by substituting some of the C atoms in the carbon cage by N. The Ar-plasma, NH3-thermal and NH3 plasma are denoted as Ni30@C180, Ni30@C175N5 and Ni30@C169N11, respectively (according to XPS elemental analysis). The H adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) is calculated from the optimized structure (Fig. S19†). The details of the calculation are described in the ESI.†
The calculated ΔGH* on these structures is shown in Fig. 5a. According to the Sabatier principle, an ideal HER electrocatalyst should possess a moderate free energy for H adsorption (ΔGH*) (close to zero) to overcome the reaction barriers of the adsorption and desorption processes.29–32 The ΔGH* value of C180 is calculated to be 0.9 eV, indicating very weak H* adsorption on carbon. In contrast, the ΔGH* value of the Ni30 cluster is −0.335 eV, i.e. H* adsorption is too strong. Encapsulating the Ni cluster into the carbon cage results in a ΔGH* value of 0.177 eV. This positive shift of ΔGH* is attributed to the shielding of the bonding electron density of the Ni cluster, as demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically. Increasing the N doping in the carbon layer leads to a negative shift of ΔGH*. The N atom had a stronger electronegativity (3.04) than the C (2.55) atom. As a result, the valence orbital energy levels of C can be adjusted by the adjacent N atom. Appropriate N doping may put the |ΔGH*| value very close to the optimal value 0. Calculation shows that the ΔGH* of Ni30@C169N11 is very close to the optimal value, while that of Ni30@C175N5 is still too positive due to the low N doping level, as shown by the volcano curve in Fig. 5b.
 Fig. 5  (a) Gibbs free energy (ΔG) profile of the HER on various catalysts. (b) Volcano plot of the exchange current density (i0) versus ΔG(H*) for various catalysts. The optimized structures with the adsorbed H atoms are also shown. Green, grey, brown, and pink balls represent Ni, N, C, and H atoms, respectively. 
Thus, NH3 plasma modification of Ni MOF-74 leads to several unique features which are highly favourable for the HER, including an ultrafine Ni particle size of only 2.5 nm, a thin carbon layer with enhanced N doping and an intact 3D hierarchical electrode structure with good electrical contact with the Ni foam substrate.
Mechanism of NH3 plasma modification
The effects of different modification methods are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6a, focusing on the Ni particle size and the electrode morphology. In pristine Ni MOF-74, Ni is atomically dispersed. Decomposition of the MOF leads to aggregation of Ni, while the obtained Ni particle size strongly depends on the modification method. Since the modification temperature is kept at 300 °C, the thermal driving force for Ni migration is the same for the three processes. The different Ni particle size, thus, can be attributed to the different impedance for Ni migration. Removal of the organic ligands creates pathways for Ni migration and favors Ni aggregation. NH3 has a strong carbon removal effect in thermal decomposition of MOFs, leading to much lower residual carbon in the MOF-derived M@C composite. Consequently, the Ni particles are much larger in NH3-thermal (∼10 nm, 10 wt% residual carbon) than in Ar-plasma (4 nm, 20 wt% residual carbon). The shape of the pristine Ni MOF-74 is largely retained after Ar plasma modification due to its much lower mass loss. In contrast, the spindle shaped particles are completely collapsed after heating in NH3 due to significant carbon removal.
 Fig. 6  (a) Schematic illustration showing the structural features and correlations of the three MOF-derived Ni catalysts. (b) Optical emission spectra of NH3 + Ar plasma and Ar plasma. The key reactive species generated in the plasma are labelled. 
It is interesting to note that the NH3-plasma sample exhibits similarities to both NH3-thermal (low residual carbon and N doping) and Ar-plasma (small Ni particle size and retention of the pristine particle shape) samples. However, the ultrafine Ni particle size (2.5 nm) in NH3-plasma is truly surprising from the above perspective, as the carbon removal effect of NH3 is further enhanced by the plasma (only 7.3 wt% residual carbon). Our previous mechanism study shows that NH3 will cause decarboxylation through nucleophilic attacking the carboxylate ligands.16 As shown by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in Fig. 6b, a wide variety of reactive nitrogen species including , , NH˙, and  exist in the NH3 plasma state. These highly reactive species will cause a more efficient reaction with the carboxylate ligands, transforming the organic ligands into robust N-doped carbon and resulting in Ni particle nucleation. Our previous study has shown that NH3 is unable to etch carbon at a temperature below 550 °C. The carbon removal effect observed is due to the fragmentation of the organic ligands rather than direct etching of carbon.16,17 Moreover, there are some active H species (Hα and Hβ) in NH3 plasma, increasing the reducibility of the whole environment and therefore helping the conversion of Ni(2+) into Ni(0) at low temperature. The formed N-doped carbon will immobilize the generated Ni nuclei and prevent Ni migration and aggregation. Due to this immobilization effect, the shape of the Ni MOF-74 particles is also largely retained even with a high mass loss, which only slightly shrinks into a carambola morphology. Thus, the role of NH3 plasma is similar to a high energy thermal shock, which causes rapid nucleation of Ni and carbonization of the organic ligands without significant Ni migration. This unique effect is of key importance to obtain structural features for efficient HER performance.
Conclusions
In summary, low temperature NH3 plasma modification of Ni MOF-74 grown on Ni foam at 300 °C results in a monolithic electrode with a carambola-like hierarchical 3D structure composed of ultrafine Ni nanocrystals (∼2.5 nm in diameter) encapsulated in a thin layer of N-doped carbon. The unique combination of high chemical reactivity and the low thermal effect in NH3 plasma leads to rapid decomposition of organic ligands and nucleation of Ni particles without significant Ni migration, which is of key importance for obtaining ultrafine Ni particles, N doping in the carbon layer and retaining the 3D structure of the pristine MOF particles. These structural features lead to excellent performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which is demonstrated in a solar cell driven water electrolyzer. This plasma enabled MOF modification method provides new possibilities to engineer the active catalytic sites in MOF derived catalysts.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration showing the different conversion patterns of Ni MOF-74 by NH3 plasma modification and by direct heating in NH3. NH3 plasma modification largely retains the 3D structure of the pristine MOF and yields ultrafine Ni particles. Direct heating in NH3 causes complete collapse of the 3D structure of the pristine MOF and the obtained Ni particles are much larger. (b–g) SEM images of different samples: (b) pristine Ni MOF-74, (c and d) NH3-plasma, and (e and f) NH3-thermal sample. (g) SEM image of the Ar-plasma sample.	 

 	Fig. 2  TEM and HRTEM images of the different samples. (a, d and e): NH3-plasma, (b) NH3-thermal, and (c and f) Ar-plasma. Size distribution histograms and electron diffraction patterns are shown in the insets of (a–c).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns of pristine Ni MOF-74. (b–d) Characterization of the three MOF-derived catalysts: (b) XRD patterns, (c) Raman spectra and (d) N 1s XPS spectra.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a and b) Electrochemical characterization of the three MOF-derived catalysts in 1 M KOH: (a) the linear scanning polarization curves and (b) the Tafel plots. (c–h) More detailed evaluation of the HER performance of the NH3-plasma catalyst: (c) quantification of H2 generated by electrolysis, (d) polarization curves of the two-electrode electrolyzer (with and without iR compensation) together with the I–V curve of the Si solar cell under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2), (e) chronopotentiometry at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 18 h, (f) TEM image after the stability test, (g) photo of the solar cell driven water electrolysis-hydrogen fuel cell system composed of a polycrystalline Si solar cell and an electrolyzer operating under a Xe lamp (100 mW cm−2), and (h) the energy loss split of the solar-to-hydrogen system.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Gibbs free energy (ΔG) profile of the HER on various catalysts. (b) Volcano plot of the exchange current density (i0) versus ΔG(H*) for various catalysts. The optimized structures with the adsorbed H atoms are also shown. Green, grey, brown, and pink balls represent Ni, N, C, and H atoms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Schematic illustration showing the structural features and correlations of the three MOF-derived Ni catalysts. (b) Optical emission spectra of NH3 + Ar plasma and Ar plasma. The key reactive species generated in the plasma are labelled.
