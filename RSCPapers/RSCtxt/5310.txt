Hence, in this study, the structural and electronic properties of the γ-CsPbI3(220) perovskite surface upon the adsorption of water molecules have been investigated based on density functional theory calculations. Also, we perform first-principles ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) to explore the structural stability of the γ-CsPbI3(220) perovskite surface in the presence of water molecules, and the results are compared with the conventional cubic CH3NH3PbI3(100) perovskite surface. The water molecules show stronger interactions with the (220) surface of γ-CsPbI3 than the (100) surface of CH3NH3PbI3. However, AIMD results demonstrate that the former is much more stable, and no trace of surface degradation was observed upon the adsorption of water molecules.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells are incessantly attracting tremendous attention as light absorbers in photovoltaic devices1–3 because of their inimitable properties, such as a small and tunable bandgap,4,5 long charge carrier lifetime (∼300 ns) and diffusion length (>1 mm),6,7 ambipolar charge transport properties,8 and low cost production.9 Most of the metal halide perovskites used in solar cells are in the ABX3 form, where A is a monovalent cation, B is a divalent metal cation, and X is a halide anion. Despite the impressive progress in photovoltaic performance achieved in these organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, they still suffer from stability issues due to the volatile and hygroscopic nature of the organic component.10,11 Notably, the presence of moisture triggered the perovskite degradation process and resulted in reduced stability of the devices.9,12
In view of addressing the hybrid perovskite device stability issues, different solutions have been proposed including tuning of the perovskite layer,13,14 use of charge transport materials,15 using carbon electrodes,16,17 and substitution of the organic cation with the inorganic cesium cation.18,19 Among them, replacing organic cations with cesium (Cs+) ions was found to be an effective way to achieve a higher intrinsic stability of perovskite materials.12 Of the various inorganic lead halide perovskites, there has been significant interest in cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskites due to their most suitable bandgap (Eg = ∼1.7 eV).20–22 Initially, Snaith et al. reported the CsPbI3 solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 2.9%.23 Subsequently, various methods such as deposition and controlling size using synthetic routes have been used to improve the efficiency and the stability of CsPbI3 perovskites.3,24–26 Recently, Wang et al., found that phenyltrimethylammonium bromide treated CsPbI3 perovskite has enhanced phase stability because of the Br doping and surface passivation and it holds a PCE higher than 17%.27
It is known that CsPbI3 has four typical crystal structures: the two orthorhombic phases (yellow δ-phase with Pnma space group, no. 62 and black γ-phase with Pbnm space group, no. 62), the cubic phase (black α-phase with Pmm space group, no. 221) and the tetragonal phase (black β-phase with P4/mbm space group, no. 127).28,29 However, the most suitable cubic black α-phase of CsPbI3 is structurally unstable (<320 °C), and it undergoes a spontaneous phase transition to orthorhombic yellow δ-CsPbI3.23,29 However, the thermodynamically preferred yellow δ-CsPbI3 phase has an inadequate response to the solar spectrum.20,30 Recently, the black orthorhombic γ-phase of CsPbI3 has attracted interest in fabricating high stability devices because of its lower phase-transition temperature (175 °C).31 Marronnier et al.28 first reported the black orthorhombic γ-phase for photovoltaic applications, and they have shown that only the orthorhombic γ-phase displays a harmonic energy landscape around equilibrium among the three black phases of CsPbI3. Furthermore, Zhao et al.32 synthesized γ-CsPbI3 thin films at room temperature by adding a small amount of H2O to CsPbI3 and reported a highly reproducible efficiency of 11.3%. They revealed that the γ-CsPbI3-based device is stable in the presence of water molecules. They also demonstrated that the low Miller-index surfaces of γ-CsPbI3 ((001), (010), and (100)) possess a lower surface energy than that of the δ-CsPbI3 surface using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the structural rigidity of the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface in the presence of water molecules aside from its inherent electronic structure is still missing. The recent studies also indicate that CsPbX3 perovskite quantum dots suffered degradation in the presence of environmental stimuli.33–35 Hence, in this study, we explored the interaction between water and γ-phase CsPbI3 and analyzed the stability of the surface in contact with water molecules using first principles ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The main advantage of the AIMD simulations is that the surface deformations, that is, atoms or ions hopped on the surface, are directly observed from the dynamics and trajectory of atoms. We also investigated the effects of water concentration on the degradation of γ-phase CsPbI3.
2. Computational details
All the DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).36,37 The projected augmented wave (PAW) method was employed to describe the electron–ion interaction.38,39 Exchange and correlation energies were computed within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.40 A plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV was employed in all calculations. A unit cell of bulk orthorhombic CsPbI3 (γ-phase) consisting of 20 atoms (4 Cs atoms, 4 Pb atoms, and 12 I atoms) was considered, and the optimized lattice parameters, calculated with a 6 × 6 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling, are a = 9.0674 Å, b = 8.7576 Å and c = 12.6777 Å, which are in reasonable agreement with a previous study (a = 8.8561 Å, b = 8.5766 Å, c = 12.4722 Å).41 It was found that the calculated lattice parameters have minimum deviations of +2.4%, +2.1% and +1.6% for a, b, and c, respectively, to the experimental values. Furthermore, we calculated the lattice parameters of γ-CsPbI3 using other functionals such as PW91 and revised PBE (RPBE) and the calculated values are given in Table S1 of the ESI.† It was found that the lattice parameters calculated with PBE and PW91 functionals have minimum deviations to the experimental values, whereas RPBE shows a larger deviation. We also performed benchmark calculations using the PBE functional with different cutoff energies and the results show a very similar deviation (Table S2, ESI†). Furthermore, cleaving the optimized bulk γ-CsPbI3 along the basal plane (220) yields different types of surface terminations (PbI2-and CsI-terminated) and they are modeled in a (1 × 1) surface unit cell with 15 Å of vacuum along the z-direction. The slabs consisted of six atomic layers, in which the bottom three layers were fixed during the calculations. A 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used, and it was increased to 11 × 11 × 1 for the density of states (DOS) calculations.42 The atomic positions were optimized until the total energy converged to 10−4 eV, and the force on each atom is smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1.
The stability of different terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surfaces was determined by using surface energy, which is calculated as (1)where σ is the surface energy, A is the total area of the surface in the slab model , ESlab is the total energy of the slab model for the surface, EBulk is the energy of one atom in the bulk, and n is the number of atoms in the slab model. The adsorption energy (Eads) of a water molecule on the γ-CsPbI3 surface is calculated as follows: Eads = Emolecule+surface − (Emolecule + Esurface)(2)where Emolecule/surface, Emolecule, and Esurface are the total energies of a water molecule adsorbed on the surface, the water molecule, and the clean perovskite surface, respectively. We also used the projected density of states (PDOS) and electron density difference (EDD) analysis to understand the interactions between water molecules and the γ-CsPbI3 surface. The charge transfer between the water molecule and the surface was investigated using Bader charge analysis.43–45 Furthermore, we carried out ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations to understand the interaction between the water molecules and the γ-CsPbI3 surface and explored the stability of the surface. All AIMD simulations were performed in the framework of DFT with the GGA–PBE functional, and the Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 2 × 2 × 1. The water adsorbed complexes were equilibrated at 400 K in the canonical ensemble (NVT)46 for 8 ps with a time step of 1 fs. A constant temperature condition was maintained using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat.
3. Results and discussion
The bulk orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3 perovskite (Pbnm space group)28 is a compound in which each Pb atom octahedrally coordinates with six I atoms and the Cs atoms are located in the octahedron PbI6 cage. Fig. S1 of the ESI,† shows the optimized geometrical structure of bulk γ-CsPbI3 perovskite. To confirm the crystal structures of γ-CsPbI3 perovskite, the XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns were simulated using the Reflex module implemented in Materials Studio,47 as shown in Fig. 1a. The simulated XRD pattern agrees with the previous experimental results.41,48 Fig. S2 of the ESI,† shows the DOS and PDOS projected on Cs, Pb, and I atoms, which indicate that the p orbital of I and Pb atoms mainly contributes to the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) and there is no contribution from the Cs atom to the Fermi level. The band structure in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† reveals that the orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3 perovskite exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.86 eV at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone, which is very close to the experimental band gap of 1.69 eV48 (see Table S3 of the ESI†). Whereas, the previous theoretical study of Zhao et al. overestimated the bandgap by 0.27 eV.32 Furthermore, we also calculated the direct bandgap for the other perovskite phases of CsPbI3 (δ- and α-phases), and the computed band gap values agree well with the available experimental values, which are shown in Table S3 of the ESI.†24,49 As can be seen from Fig. 1a and b, (220) is the most preferred orientation for the γ-CsPbI3 perovskite, and hence, we have constructed the γ-CsPbI3(220) plane consisting of different terminated surfaces such as I-termination, Cs-termination, PbI2-termination, CsI-termination, PbI2-defective termination, PbI2-rich defective termination, CsI-defective termination, and I-rich termination. For comparison, we also considered the δ-phase CsPbI3 surface in the most preferred (212) orientation with different terminations.50 To examine the stability of these different terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) and δ-phase CsPbI3(212) surfaces, we have calculated the surface energy using eqn (1), and the values are given in Table S4 of the ESI.† The CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface has a lower surface energy of 0.027 eV Å−2 than the other possible surface terminations in both the δ- and γ-phase, suggesting that the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface is the most stable surface plane. Hence, we considered the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface for our further calculations. The optimized structure of the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) plane is shown in Fig. 2.

3.1. H2O adsorption on γ-CsPbI3(220) surfaces
At first, we considered all the possible adsorption sites for water adsorption on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface to identify the most stable molecular adsorption. Here, we fixed the bottom three layers of the slabs, and the top three layers with water molecules were allowed to relax during optimization. Fig. 3 shows the optimized structures of a water molecule adsorbed on different adsorption sites of the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, and the corresponding adsorption energies and structural parameters of the water molecule are given in Table 1 and Table S5 of the ESI.† Selected bond distances are also provided in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the O atom of the water molecule locates on the top site of the Cs atom (Cs-site) to form a dative bond, and the water molecule is almost perpendicular to the surface. The water molecule is adsorbed via one of the H atoms on the top of the I atom (I-site) to form a hydrogen bond, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Both O and H atoms of the water molecule interact with the surface Cs and I atoms (Hollow site), respectively (Fig. 3(c)). From the viewpoint of adsorption energy, the water adsorbed on the hollow site (Fig. 3(c)) of the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface is the most energetically favourable configuration among the others. The calculated water adsorption energy on the hollow site of the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface is −0.43 eV, which is relatively more stable by 0.16 eV than that at the Cs-site. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the water molecule interacts with the γ-CsPbI3 surface via both a dative bond (H–O–Cs) and the hydrogen bond (H⋯I) interaction. This cooperative (dative and hydrogen bond) interaction in this configuration resulted in the larger water adsorption energy than that of the other configurations. As can be seen from Table S5 of the ESI,† the bond length of Ha–O is longer than that of Hb–O, revealing the existence of a hydrogen bond as water adsorbed on top of the I atom (Fig. 3(b)) and hollow sites (Fig. 3(c)). Furthermore, we compared the water adsorption on inorganic γ-CsPbI3 perovskite with the most commonly used organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to understand the moisture effects on both the materials. Previously, Mosconi et al.51 considered both methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead iodide (PbI2) terminated CH3NH3PbI3 surfaces and found that the CH3NH3I termination undergoes surface degradation in the presence of moisture. Hence, here, we considered the CH3NH3I-terminated cubic CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface. The details of surface construction and the computational information are presented in the ESI.† The optimized CH3NH3I-terminated surface of cubic CH3NH3PbI3(100) perovskite and water adsorption configurations at different sites of CH3NH3I-terminated cubic CH3NH3PbI3(100) surfaces are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 of the ESI,† respectively, and the corresponding adsorption energies are listed in Table 1. Similar to inorganic γ-CsPbI3 perovskite, the hollow-site has a larger water adsorption energy (−0.25 eV) than the other sites. As can be seen in Table 1, the water adsorption energies calculated for γ-CsPbI3 perovskite surface are slightly larger than those of the cubic CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite surface.

3.2. Electronic properties of H2O adsorption on the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface
Furthermore, to understand the interaction of γ-CsPbI3 perovskite with a water molecule, we analyzed the Bader charges, EDD, and PDOS of the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface. Table 1 lists the calculated Bader charge differences corresponding to the adsorption of a water molecule on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface at different sites, in which a negative value represents electron acceptance, and a positive value indicates electron donation for a water molecule. It can be seen that the water molecule gains electrons from the surface when it is adsorbed on top of the I atom (I-site) and the hollow site, whereas it donates to the surface when it adsorbed on the Cs-site. Though the hollow site has a larger adsorption energy, the electron gain by the water molecule is comparatively smaller than that at the I-site. This is due to the existence of cooperative interaction in the hollow site, in which a water molecule donates electrons via the dative bond and gains an electron from the surface via the hydrogen bond. In Fig. 4, we present the PDOS of the gas-phase water molecule and its adsorption on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface. As can be seen from Fig. 4, all the states of the water molecule below the Fermi level are downshifted, and the intensity of the peaks in the conduction band decreased after it adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, confirming the electron gain from the surface. Furthermore, the DOS projected on the Cs atom that is close to the water molecule adsorbed on the CsI-terminated surface shows a higher degree of overlap with the water DOS, especially in the range of −5 to −10 and −22 eV. We have calculated the bandgap before and after water adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, and the values are 0.71 and 0.81 eV, respectively. It was found that water adsorption slightly increased the bandgap of the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface. The interaction of water with the surfaces was further analyzed by using the EDD, which is calculated as Δρ = ρmolecule+surface − (ρmolecule + ρsurface) in which ρmolecule+surface is the total electron density, ρmolecule is the electron density of a water molecule adsorbed on the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, and ρsurface is the electron density of the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface. From the EDD contour plot shown in Fig. 5, we can see the electron density accumulation between the water molecule O atom and the surface Cs atom, confirming the existence of a dative bond between the oxygen atom and the Cs atom. Since the oxygen atom has a higher negativity, the electron distribution of the dative bond is closer to the oxygen atom. In addition, there is an electron accumulation between the O–Ha bond of the water and the surface I atom, illustrating the existence of O–H⋯I interaction between water and the surface. The EDD contour clearly demonstrates the cooperative interaction between the water and the γ-CsPbI3(220) perovskite via dative bond (Cs with O atom) and hydrogen bond interaction (O–H with I atom).

3.3. Adsorption of two/dimer H2O molecules on the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface
To understand the mode of water molecule adsorption, i.e., isolated molecular adsorption versus water dimer adsorption on the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, we considered a water dimer and two isolated water molecules adsorbing on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface. Here, we chose neighbouring hollow sites for the two isolated water molecule adsorption on the CsI-terminated surface, as they are energetically the most stable site for the water monomer adsorption. Whereas, the water dimer is stably adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface via bidentate mode, i.e., by the oxygen atom interacting with the Cs atom of the surface and the hydrogen atom interacting with the surface iodine atom, in which one water molecule acts as an electron donor and another acts as an electron acceptor. The optimized structures of the two isolated water molecules and water dimer adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface are shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively, and the calculated adsorption energies are given in Table 1. Our calculation indicates that water molecules prefer to adsorb dispersively in nature rather than in the dimer complex on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface. As seen from the calculated Bader charges (Table 1), the water molecules gain more electrons when adsorbed dispersively compared to the dimer. We also calculated the bandgap for two water molecules, and a water dimer on the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface and the values are found to be ∼0.81 eV, which are very similar to that of the water monomer adsorption on the surface. Fig. 6(b) and 7(b) demonstrate the obtained EDD contour plots for two isolated water molecules and water dimer adsorption on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, respectively. We find that the electron density distribution in the isolated water molecules and the water dimer adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface differs considerably. As shown in Fig. 7, the water dimer adsorbed with additional hydrogen bonding interaction, which increases the electron accumulation and depletion between the Cs and O atoms and H and I atoms compared to that in isolated water molecule adsorption, suggesting the strengthening of cooperative interaction. However, the interactions of two isolated water adsorption include two dative bonds and two hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the interactions of water dimer adsorption have one dative bond and two hydrogen bonds. Therefore, water molecules prefer to adsorb dispersively on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface.

3.4. Stability of the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface upon water adsorption
In this work, we used ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations to understand the interaction of water molecules with the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface and we particularly examined the stability of the surfaces upon water molecule adsorption. The evolution of the selected interatomic distances of the surface upon water adsorption and the AIMD snapshots for the isolated water molecule adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface are given in Fig. 8. Two of the Cs–I bonds are elongated from their initial positions, then they subsequently returned to their initial values and remained the same until the end of the simulation time (8000 fs). Though the Cs–I bonds are slightly elongated at the beginning of the simulation, the snapshots of CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface geometries (Fig. 8(b)) recorded at different simulation times confirm that there is no visible surface distortion upon the water molecule interaction. We have also performed the AIMD simulations before and after isolated water adsorbed on the CH3NH3I-terminated cubic phase of the CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface for comparison, and the calculated AIMD results are given in Fig. S6 and S7 of the ESI.† From Fig. S6(a) (ESI†), it is found that though the interatomic distances fluctuate a little, they returned to their initial positions at the end of the simulation time for the CH3NH3I-terminated cubic phase of the CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface. The trajectories of the CH3NH3I-terminated CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface before water adsorption at different simulation times indicate that there is no obvious surface degradation (Fig. S6(b), ESI†). As can be seen from Fig. S7 (ESI†), the interatomic distances (close to the water molecule) of the CH3NH3I-terminated CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface exhibit a large amplitude of fluctuation with respect to simulation time upon water molecule adsorption. Notably, the interatomic bonds (Pb–I) in the CH3NH3I-terminated CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface are found to break when the water molecule is adsorbed, confirming the degradation of the surface in the presence of moisture. We have also analyzed the trajectories of the CH3NH3I-terminated CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface upon water monomer adsorption after the end of the simulation time (Fig. S8, ESI†) and we found that the top layer of the surface cleaved from the bottom layers, revealing the existence of surface degradation, as reported by Mosconi et al.51 On comparing the AIMD results of CH3NH3PbI3(100) with the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, it is found that though the water adsorption energy on the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface is slightly larger, it exhibits improved structural stability towards moisture. This is due to the comparatively strong interaction between Cs and PbI than the CH3NH3 molecule and PbI. Recently, Lu and co-workers demonstrated that because of the weak interaction between the CH3NH3 molecule and PbI layer in the CH3NH3PbI3 surface, the CH3NH3 molecule rotates easily upon water adsorption and thereby increases the surface degradation.52 Previous studies53–55 also indicated that the interactions between the organic and inorganic parts were easily destroyed upon the penetration of water molecules in bulk CH3NH3PbI3.

To further examine the effects of the concentration of water molecules on the stability of the perovskite γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, we performed AIMD calculations on two water molecules, and a water dimer adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface over 8 ps. The evolutions of the distances between the Cs and iodine atoms, which are closer to the water molecules adsorbed on the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface, are illustrated in Fig. 9 and 10, respectively. It can be seen that the distance between the Cs and iodine atoms in the CsI-terminated γ-CsPbI3(220) surface is marginally elongated upon the adsorption of two water molecules or a water dimer, then it spontaneously reached its initial distance and remained there throughout the simulation. We also analyzed the snapshots (Fig. S9 and S10 of the ESI†) of γ-CsPbI3(220) surface geometries interacting with water molecules at different simulation times, which indicate that there is no apparent distortion of surface atoms with an increasing number of water molecules adsorbed. To observe if there are any phase transitions upon the water adsorption, we have analyzed the sub-layer interatomic PbI framework distances with respect to simulation time for both water monomer and water dimer adsorption, and the results are given in Fig. S11 and S12 of the ESI.† The results clearly show that the sub-layer interatomic Pb–I distances are stable until the end of simulation and there are no obvious changes observed, endorsing that there is no phase transition or local structure change upon the water adsorption. Our AIMD results show that though the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface has larger water adsorption energy than the commercial CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface, it shows greater structural stability in the presence of moisture than the CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface.

4. Conclusion
Understanding the interaction between water and the γ-CsPbI3 perovskite surface is important for characterizing the nature of the surface and to increase the moisture stability. Using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the structural stability and electronic properties of the γ-CsPbI3(220) perovskite surface in the presence of water molecules and compared them with the conventional CH3NH3PbI3(100) surface. Our DFT calculations indicate that the water molecules are prone to interacting with the γ-CsPbI3 perovskite surface more than with the CH3NH3PbI3 surface. Moreover, our AIMD calculations demonstrate that the interatomic distances in the top layer of the CH3NH3PbI3 surface are strongly distorted upon the water molecule adsorption, and finally, it undergoes surface degradation. In contrast, although the interatomic distances in the top layer of the γ-CsPbI3 surface show slight distortions, there is no apparent structural degradation. Based on our theoretical results, we predicted that the γ-CsPbI3(220) surface has better moisture stability for solar cell applications.
