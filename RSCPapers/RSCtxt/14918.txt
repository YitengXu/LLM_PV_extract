    , Accepted 5th April 2022First published on 5th April 2022AbstractHere we demonstrate crystalline phase induced Raman enhancement on molybdenum carbide materials (β-Mo2C and α-MoC). From all the studied target molecules (rhodamine 6G, crystal violet and methylene blue), the Raman enhancement on β-Mo2C is 2–4 times higher than that on α-MoC. Spectroscopic and theoretical calculations reveal that β-Mo2C has a lower electron work function and a higher density of states near the Fermi level than α-MoC, which promotes the charge transfer and photo induced charge transfer processes from probe molecules to the substrate.
1. Introduction
Taking advantage of rapidity and trace detection, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been widely used in environmental science, biological sensing, cancer cell recognition, and other fields.1–6 The SERS mechanism between the substrate and probe molecules can be divided into the electromagnetic mechanism or chemical enhancement mechanism.7–10 The electromagnetic mechanism originates from the localized surface plasmon resonance of the noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au and Ag), while the chemical enhancement mechanism is based on the charge transfer between the substrate materials and the adsorbed probe molecules.11–13 In recent years, quasi-metals have gained intensive attention in the SERS area since their large density of states near the Fermi level can increase the probability of electron transition.14,15 For example, ultrathin NbS2 flakes,14 WO2 nanodendrites,16 b-VO2 nanosheets,17 and MoO2 nanospheres18 have been developed as potential SERS substrates for enlarging the Raman signals of probe molecules via a charge transfer enhancement mechanism, presenting a new model of charge transfer from Fermi levels to molecular orbitals.
Transition metal carbides are representative quasi-metals, consisting of C atoms that occupy the interstices of metal atoms. Owing to the fascinating physical and chemical properties, transition metal carbides have attracted extensive research interest in the area of catalysis, magnetics and biomedicine.19–27 In addition, with unique optical, electrical, and catalytic properties, 2D transition metal carbides have attracted considerable interest and succeeded in a broader range of intriguing applications such as optical devices, optoelectronics, catalysis, biomedicine, and energy storage.28–31 Very recently, the outstanding SERS performance of transition metal carbides has been discovered.19,32–34 For instance, Du et al. reported that Mo2C and MoN hollow spheres with large surface areas displayed strong surface-enhanced Raman effects.35 Lan et al. systematically studied the SERS performance of a series of transition metal carbide chips, including tungsten carbide, molybdenum carbide, niobium carbide and titanium carbide, and found that MoCx chips exhibit the best SERS performance.36 In the present literature studies, electromagnetic mechanism is reported to be the dominant mechanism due to the elaborate morphology of the transition metal carbides, while the charge transfer mechanism, which is believed to be widespread in quasi-metallic SERS substrates, has not been investigated in detail.
Molybdenum carbides have unique crystal structures of different phases, which have found wide applications in a variety of fields such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, transparent electrodes, sensors, catalysis, photothermal therapy, and dye-sensitized solar cells.19,34,37 The crystalline phase of molybdenum carbides can have a great impact on their physical and chemical properties. For example, β-Mo2C (hexagonal close-packed, hcp structure) exhibits better catalytic performance for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction than α-MoC (face-centered cubic, fcc structure).34 In contrast, the α-MoC supported noble metal catalysts show much higher activity for the water–gas shift reaction and methanol water reforming reaction than the β-Mo2C supported catalysts.20 Interestingly, we have found that different phases of molybdenum sulfides and selenides show distinct SERS performance.38 To date, the effect of the crystalline phase on transition metal carbides has not been investigated.
Herein, α-MoC and β-Mo2C with a similar size and morphology were prepared and used as SERS substrates.21,39 It is worth noting that β-Mo2C has a hexagonal crystal structure, which consists of an ABAB packing of the metal planes, and the cubic α-MoC is isostructural with NaCl and has an ABCABC stacking sequence.34 Furthermore, β-Mo2C owns higher density of states near the Fermi level, which indicates that β-Mo2C has a stronger metallic nature than α-MoC. In addition, the stability and carbon content of the two crystalline phases of molybdenum carbide are different. Obviously, α-MoC has a significantly higher carbon content than β-Mo2C. Notably, it can be seen from the phase diagram that the cubic phase α-MoC is metastable, while the hexagonal phase β-Mo2C is more stable.40 In our article, the SERS performance of α-MoC and β-Mo2C was compared by using rhodamine 6G (R6G), crystal violet (CV) and methylene blue (MB) as probe molecules, respectively. It is found that the SERS activity of β-Mo2C is 2–4 times higher than that of α-MoC. To understand the effect of the crystalline phase on the Raman enhancement of molybdenum carbides, multiple experimental and theoretical methods are utilized in this work. The facilitated charge transfer and photo induced charge transfer processes over β-Mo2C are demonstrated to be responsible for its better SERS performance.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and materials
Ammonium paramolybdate ((NH4)7Mo7O24·4H2O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals and materials used in the experimental process are of analytic or chromatographic purity and used without further purification. Ammonia gas, 0.5% O2 in Ar, 20% CH4/80%H2, and Ar were purchased from Haikeyuanchang Gas Co. Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of the MoO3 precursor
The MoO3 precursor was synthesized by calcination of (NH4)7Mo7O24·4H2O to 500 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace.
2.3. Synthesis of α-MoC
The MoO3 precursor was placed in a quartz tube, and then purged with pure NH3 gas for 10 min to exhaust the air. After that, the temperature was increased from room temperature to 700 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under the flow of 150 mL min−1 pure NH3 gas and maintained at 700 °C for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the gas circuit was switched to 20% CH4/80% H2 gas, and the same heating steps as above were applied. After cooling down to room temperature, the products were passivated by 0.5% O2 in Ar with a 55 mL min−1 flow rate for 6 h.
2.4. Synthesis of β-Mo2C
The MoO3 precursor was purged with 20% CH4/80%H2 for 10 min. Then, the samples were heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 300 °C at a flow rate of 150 mL min−1. After that, the temperature was elevated to 700 °C by a rate of 1 °C min−1 and maintained at 700 °C for 2 h. Finally, the products were cooled down to room temperature and then passivated by 0.5% O2 in Ar with a flow rate of 55 mL min−1 for 6 h to obtain β-Mo2C.
2.5. Characterization methods
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D-8 focus X-ray diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a FEI Quanta 200F with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed using a Tecnai G F30 operated at 300 kV accelerating voltage. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCALab-250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Al Kα X-rays at hυ = 1486.6 eV. The peak positions were internally referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1901 in the range of 200–900 nm. The surface potential of the sample was measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM, Bruker Dimension ICON system) on SiO2/Au.
2.6. SERS measurements
The Raman measurement tests were performed using a confocal-micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw-inVia). The laser beam size was adjusted to a diameter of 1 μm in all SERS detection methods, with a ×50 objective lens, a laser power of 0.15 mW and an acquisition time of 10 s. We chose two exciting wavelengths of 532 nm and 633 nm. A series of standard solutions such as rhodamine 6G, methylene blue and crystal violet with concentrations of 10−4–10−6 M was adopted as the probe molecules. The prepared molybdenum carbide was weighed, and 2 mg was dispersed in 1 mL water solution, respectively, and ultrasonication was carried out for 10 min and 20 μL molybdenum carbide dispersion was mixed with 90 μL probe molecular solutions of different concentrations. After adsorption for 8 h, the sample was dropped on a silicon wafer for drying before the SERS measurements.
3. Results and discussion
α-MoC and β-Mo2C were prepared by calcinating the MoO3 precursor (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) under different atmospheres (CH4/H2 for β-Mo2C and NH3 followed by CH4/H2 for α-MoC).20,21,39 As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples match well with the standard profiles of β-Mo2C (JCPDS.65–8766) and α-MoC (ICSD.43523), respectively. Specifically, α-MoC has a face-centred-cubic (fcc) structure and β-Mo2C has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, as illustrated in Fig. 1b and c. The morphology and structure of α-MoC and β-Mo2C were further investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As seen in the SEM images (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) and low-magnification TEM images (Fig. 1d and j), both α-MoC and β-Mo2C preserve the irregular bulk morphology of the MoO3 precursor (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The average size of α-MoC and β-Mo2C was determined to be close to 1–2 μm. Interestingly, upon close observation by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM, Fig. 1e and k), it was observed that α-MoC and β-Mo2C have porous secondary structures with highly textured molybdenum carbide nanocrystals of 2–10 nm in size, which cannot be found in the MoO3 precursor (Fig. S4 in the ESI†).24,26 Detailed crystal structure analysis demonstrates that the lattice fringes of 0.246 and 0.213 nm match well with the (111) and (200) planes of α-MoC (Fig. 1f), whereas the fringe of 0.230 nm matches with the (101) plane of β-Mo2C (Fig. 1),21,24,39 which is also supported by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (insets in Fig. 1f and l). In addition, elemental mapping images (Fig. 1g–i and m–o) of the samples show that the Mo and C elements distribute homogeneously in both α-MoC and β-Mo2C. Moreover, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image reveals that the thickness of α-MoC and β-Mo2C is about 5–6 nm (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). In a word, the morphology, particle size and thickness of α-MoC and β-Mo2C are similar, which makes the Raman enhancement comparison meaningful.

The surface structure of the as-prepared α-MoC and β-Mo2C was further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Only the Mo, C and O elements can be found in the XPS survey spectra of α-MoC and β-Mo2C (Fig. S6 in the ESI†), where O comes from the surface oxidation of molybdenum carbide materials after air exposure. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the C 1s spectra can be divided into four peaks at 284.6, 286.3, 288.6 and 283.4 eV, assigned to the C–C, CO, CC and Mo–C bonds, respectively.32,35 The C–Mo peak at 283.4 eV suggests the successful synthesis of molybdenum carbide. Moreover, the Mo 3d spectra of both samples can be fitted into eight peaks (Fig. 2c and d). Specifically, the peaks located at 231.9 and 228.7 eV can be assigned to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks of the Mo–C bond. The appearance of Mo3+ (228.78 eV and 232.18 eV), Mo4+ (231.18 eV and 234.28 eV) and Mo6+ species (235.28 eV and 232.18 eV) is caused by the inevitable surface oxidation of molybdenum carbides in air.26,34,35 In the Raman spectroscopy of α-MoC and β-Mo2C, the characteristic D and G bands of the carbon materials were not found (Fig. 2e), which originate from our high-temperature solid–gas carbonization method. Therefore, the influence of carbon materials, known as SERS active materials, can be excluded in this work. Moreover, the calculated band structures of the two samples (Fig. 2f) illustrate that α-MoC and β-Mo2C have metallic features because the band near the Fermi level is relatively dense and there is no obvious band gap.35,38,41

The Raman enhancement ability of α-MoC and β-Mo2C was investigated by selecting rhodamine 6G (R6G), crystal violet (CV) and methylene blue (MB) as probe molecules. Raman signals of the probe molecules can be barely seen on the blank SiO2/Si substrate (Fig. S7 in the ESI†).38 In contrast, well-resolved Raman spectra could be recorded on both transition metal carbide samples (Fig. 3a–c). However, a substrate-dependent enhancement clearly indicates that the crystal structure (phase) does have a significant impact, where β-Mo2C exhibits stronger SERS responses than α-MoC. When β-Mo2C is used as the SERS platform, the signal intensity of the selected characteristic peaks of R6G (609 cm−1), CV (1587 cm−1) and MB (1587 cm−1) is 2–4 times higher than that on α-MoC.42,43 Here we use 1 × 10−4 M probe molecules solution absorbed onto the substrate to estimate the enhancement factor (EF). The EF was calculated to be around 1.0 × 103 for β-Mo2C, about 2–3 times higher than that on α-MoC (see calculation details in the ESI†). Moreover, the uniformity and repeatability of the α-MoC and β-Mo2C platforms are verified by collecting the Raman signals from different positions after the probe molecules are adsorbed on α-MoC and β-Mo2C (Fig. S8 and S9 in the ESI†). It is worth noting that the chemical composition, morphology and surface structure of α-MoC and β-Mo2C are quite similar, and the different Raman enhancement abilities for β-Mo2C and α-MoC can be attributed to their different crystalline structures.

Here, the Raman enhancement on the surface of molybdenum carbide with various crystalline phases is different, but the mechanism remains unclear. In previous works, the SERS enhancement over molybdenum carbides with a unique morphology (i.e. chips and hollow sphere) was reported to be dominated by the physical (electromagnetic) enhancement mechanism, while the chemical enhancement was ignored.35,36 However, as seen in the UV-vis absorption spectra of α-MoC and β-Mo2C (Fig. S10 in the ESI†), no peaks can be found in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm, which solidly rules out the LSPR effect over the as-prepared molybdenum carbides and further the contribution of electromagnetic enhancement in our system.38
Since the contribution of electromagnetic mechanism can be excluded, the chemical mechanisms, including charge transfer and photo-induced charge transfer, over α-MoC and β-Mo2C were studied by multiple experimental and theoretical methods. First, the charge transfer mechanism is indicated by the observation of enhancement of non-totally symmetric b2 modes in the spectrum. As reported, the enhancement of non-totally symmetric modes of the adsorbed molecules can only be induced by the charge transfer effect.44,45 For example, the out-of-plane deformation at 616 cm−1 and in-plane ring deformation at 765 cm−1, which are considered as the b2 mode, exhibit large enhancement in α-MoC-R6G and β-Mo2C-R6G (Fig. S11†). Moreover, compared with α-MoC, more appreciable peak-shifts of the probe molecules were found for the β-Mo2C system, an indicator for stronger substrate–molecule interaction.46
The existence of a charge transfer process between molybdenum carbides and the probe molecules is reasonable from the point of view of the electronic theory of acid and alkali, where the Mo atoms in molybdenum carbides with vacant orbitals act as electron acceptors, and the atoms in the probe molecules with lone-pair electrons (e.g. N atoms in MB) can be electron donors. In this work, the charge transfer process between the as-prepared α-MoC or β-Mo2C and MB was verified by an XPS study.47–49 After MB adsorption, the Mo 3d XPS of α-MoC-MB and β-Mo2C-MB were recorded and compared with the ones of pure α-MoC and β-Mo2C (Fig. 4a). For both α-MoC-MB and β-Mo2C-MB, the binding energy of Mo–C 3d5/2 peaks shift toward a lower binding energy, indicating that α-MoC and β-Mo2C gain electrons from the adsorbed MB molecules, which is direct evidence for the charge transfer process between the adsorbates and molybdenum carbides. Interestingly, a 3d peak splitting of Mo after the adsorption of MB molecules was witnessed. This splitting is due to the strong interaction and charge transfer between molybdenum carbides and MB after adsorption. The new split peaks at 232 and 235 nm are assigned to Mo5+ (231.5 and 234.6 eV).6 The presence of Mo5+ is also strong evidence for the charge transfer between the substrate and the adsorbed molecules.

(f and g) The work functions of α-MoC and β-Mo2C from the cross-section surface. 
To further understand the charge transfer process, the charge difference distributions for α-MoC-MB and β-Mo2C-MB were calculated (Fig. 4b and c). The yellow regions, which represent the increased-electron-density region, can be found around the Mo atoms, indicating that molybdenum carbides grab electrons upon the adsorption of MB. For comparison, the blue regions, which represent the decreased-electron-density region, can be found around the aromatic rings. Notably, the density of the colored region in β-Mo2C-MB is significantly higher than that in α-MoC-MB, an indication that β-Mo2C grabs more electrons from the MB molecules than α-MoC does.8,50 This result demonstrates that the charge transfer process between β-Mo2C and MB is of higher efficiency, which is an advantage as a SERS substrate.
It is reported that the work function of a material can be used to compare the difficulty of the charge transfer process between the SERS platform and the probe molecules.50 Here, in order to verify the conclusion drawn by the charge difference distribution, the work functions of α-MoC and β-Mo2C were detected by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM).50 KPFM can not only be used to observe the surface morphology of flat materials, but also to image the surface electronic potential of materials at the nanoscale level. To calculate the work functions of α-MoC or β-Mo2C, Au nanoparticles whose work function is 4.80 eV are loaded on a Si/SiO2 wafer and these nanoparticles further served as substrates. The measured surface potential images of α-MoC and β-Mo2C are shown in Fig. 4d and e, respectively. As a result, the work functions of α-MoC and β-Mo2C are calculated to be 4.85 eV and 4.73 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the different work functions of α-MoC and β-Mo2C were investigated using DFT calculations (Fig. 4f and g and S12 in the ESI†). The work function at the cross-section surface of β-Mo2C is 4.56 eV, which is lower than that of α-MoC (4.63 eV), consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, both experimental results and theoretical calculations illustrate that β-Mo2C has a lower electron work function, and further undergoes a stronger charge transfer process with the probe molecules.45,50
Alongside with the charge transfer efficiency, photo-induced charge transfer efficiency between the SERS platform and the probe molecules also has an impact on the Raman enhancement. In order to compare the difficulty for the photo-induced charge transfer process, the density of states of α-MoC and β-Mo2C was calculated. According to Fermi's golden rule, the density of states near the Fermi level has a dominant influence on the probability of charge transition, which is related to the difficulty for a photo-induced charge transfer. As seen in Fig. 5a, β-Mo2C owns more plentiful electronic states near the Fermi level than α-MoC. Therefore, β-Mo2C is predicted to possess a higher probability of electronic transition, allowing a much more efficient photo-induced charge transfer process. Taking MB as an example, the predicted photo-induced charge transfer efficiency between molybdenum carbides and the probe molecules is compared by the UV-vis absorption spectra of MB, α-MoC-MB and β-Mo2C-MB (Fig. 5b). The absorption peak of pure MB molecule locates at about 670 nm. Once it is adsorbed on molybdenum carbides, the absorption peak of α-MoC-MB or β-Mo2C-MB gets broadened and shifts to a smaller wavelength (about 600 nm) significantly, which is considered as an indicator of strong photo-induced charge transfer resonance between the SERS platform and the adsorbed molecule.16,50 Upon a closer observation, the blue-shift degree of β-Mo2C-MB is slightly larger than that of α-MoC-MB, implying a stronger photo-induced charge transfer resonance between β-Mo2C and MB.

The photo-induced charge transfer diagram is drawn according to the Fermi level of molybdenum carbides (EF, numerically equal to the work functions) and the HOMO (−5.1 eV) and LOMO orbitals (−3.6 eV) of MB.47 As seen in Fig. 5c, μmol represents the molecular transition and μi and μk represent the charge transitions from the HOMO orbital of the MB molecule to the Fermi level of molybdenum carbides first, and then from molybdenum carbides to the LUMO orbitals of the MB molecule, respectively. This apt energy level distribution makes photo-induced charge transfer possible. According to the Herzberg–Teller theory, both photo-induced charge transfers from the MB molecule to the molybdenum carbides and from the molybdenum carbides to the MB molecule could contribute to the molecular polarizability tensor, which increases the Raman scattering cross-section of MB correspondingly.16,17,51–53 In addition, the molecular resonance of the photo-induced charge transfer Raman enhancement is also involved in SERS, since R6G has strong absorption at 532 nm, which would produce a large intramolecular resonance effect. As shown in Fig. S13,† when the excitation wavelength is switched from 532 nm to 633 nm, the relative intensity of the Raman scattering peaks of the R6G molecule decreases significantly, which implies that the molecular resonance of photo-induced charge transfer enhancement is present between the substrates and the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, because the EF of β-Mo2C (−4.73 eV) is higher than that of α-MoC (−4.85 eV), the required transition energy from the Fermi level to the HOMO of the MB molecule is lower than that of α-MoC, leading to a higher probability of electron transition and finally a better SERS performance on β-Mo2C.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, crystalline phase induced Raman enhancement on molybdenum carbides (α-MoC and β-Mo2C) is demonstrated based on a series of experimental and theoretical approaches. Different crystalline phases of molybdenum carbides lead to different energy level structures of α-MoC and β-Mo2C. Difference in the electronic structure has an impact on the adsorption of probe molecules, leading to a more efficient charge transfer process between β-Mo2C and the probe molecules. The Fermi level and density of states also affect the electron transition probability, and facilitated photo-induced charge transfer process was observed on β-Mo2C. Considering these advantages, the Raman enhancement on β-Mo2C is much better than that on α-MoC. This work can lead to new approaches for the study of the Raman enhancement mechanism of quasi-metallic materials.
