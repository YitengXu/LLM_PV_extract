    , Accepted 4th November 2018First published on 7th November 2018AbstractDirect Z-scheme heterojunction can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity due to its low carrier recombination rate and high redox ability. In this study, a 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction is synthesized in situ by topotactic sulfurization/oxidization pyrolysis of Zn/Cd/Al layer double hydroxides (LDHs). Its unique structure provides not only numerous intimate interfaces but also a direct Z-scheme junction. The in situ topotactic fabrication of ZnO by the oxidation process causes some Zn ions to dissolve out from the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheets with increase in annealing temperature and time. The longer the time for oxidation, the more ZnO is obtained. The formation of ZnO yields 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction, which increases the visible light absorption and boosts the separation of photogenerated carriers. The ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 single crystal nanosheet heterojunction presents the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation (38.93 mmol h−1 g−1), which is nearly 16.93 times higher than that of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300, and an external quantum efficiency of 40.97% at λ = 420 nm. The proposed synthetic route for the construction of 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet provides a direct Z-scheme structure with highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.
1 Introduction
Clean, reproducible and high calorific hydrogen is considered as a promising solution to energy dilemma and environmental contamination. However, hydrogen is mainly fabricated by employing high-energy consumption processes such as the electrolytic process.1–4 Since the pioneering report on the Honda–Fujishima effect in 1972, TiO2 has captured worldwide attention due to its potential application in the water photolysis reaction using inexhaustible solar energy.5 Since then, an increasing number of photocatalysts (such as ZnO,6 WO3, (ref. 7) CdS,8 Ag3PO4, (ref. 9) BiOX,10 and SrTiO3 (ref. 11)) have been investigated because of the strong momentum for their development and potential practical applications. However, many semiconductors only absorb ultraviolet light and result in low sunlight utilization efficiency because UV light merely accounts for 4–6% of sunlight.12 Based on the inherent nature of inorganic semiconductors, it is anticipated that visible light photocatalysts can be developed.13,14
ZnxCd1−xS solid solution is known as an efficient visible light-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water splitting.15–19 The outstanding physical and chemical performance of ZnxCd1−xS solid solution, including tunable band gap, broad light absorption range and appropriate location of conduction band, can be further adjusted by modifying the Zn/Cd molar ratio.20–22 Changes in these properties have a huge influence on the photocatalytic activity and stability. In particular, ZnxCd1−xS solid solution not only decreases the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers from CdS alone, but also removes the narrow light absorption from pure ZnS.23 Consequently, great efforts have been devoted for tailoring photocatalytic performances of ZnxCd1−xS-derived photocatalysts. There are various strategies to modulate the light absorption range, such as band gap engineering by doping metal24 and non-metal elements,25 heterojunction coupling with narrow band gap semiconductors26 or quantum dots,27 surface photosensitization with highly stable organic dyes,28 and addition of some noble metals with surface plasmon resonance,29 to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Among these, the heterojunction structure exhibits perfect effectiveness in enhancing photocatalytic activity due to (a) highly efficient charge collection and separation, (b) rapid charge transfer, (c) longer carrier lifetime and (d) incompatible photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions at the interface.30–32 Li et al.26 designed high-quality and well-defined Cu1.94S/ZnxCd1−xS heteronanorods deposited with 5% Pt co-catalyst for enhanced hydrogen evolution activity (13.53 mmol h−1 g−1). Guo et al.33 fabricated particle/stick ZnxCd1−xS/ZnO by one-step hydrothermal synthesis, which exhibited the highest presently available photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 9.45 mmol h−1 g−1 among all reported ZnxCd1−xS/ZnO composite photocatalysts. However, ZnxCd1−xS solid solutions are still confronted with low photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency due to their high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. Thus, an efficient synthetic route towards obtaining efficient hydrogen evolution activity and cost effectiveness simultaneously is necessary.
Two-dimensional materials with specific structures attract great attention in the area of photocatalysis. Their unique structures, such as g-C3N4 and WO3, endow the photocatalysts with excellent light harvesting ability and low charge recombination rate. Particularly, face-to-face interface in 2D/2D heterojunction provides tightly packed interface and short charge distance, which ensures interfacial charge transfer ability. The photogenerated electrons from CB of one semiconductor can be easily transferred to the CB of another semiconductor to effectively lower their recombination.34–38 Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), noteworthy two-dimensional layered anionic clays, are usually expressed as [M1−x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+(An−)x/n·yH2O; here, M2+ and M3+ represent bivalent and trivalent metallic cations, respectively, An− stands for interlayer anion, and x is the molar ratio of M3+/(M2+ + M3+) that determines the chemical composition and properties of LDHs. The host layer structure of LDHs, a positively charged layer, is analogous to brucite-like octahedral M(OH)6. LDHs can be transformed into homogenously distributed mixed metallic oxides at the atomic scale, which plays a considerable role in catalytic performance compared with other preparation methods.39–41 Therefore, LDHs are promising templates to construct 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunctions.
In this paper, a novel 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction was designed and produced by topotactic sulfurization/oxidation pyrolysis of Zn/Cd/Al LDH. The morphology, structure and composition of Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheets and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra. In the sulfurization process, it was found that Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 solid solution nanosheets exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen activity (18.28 mmol h−1 g−1). In addition, it is worth mentioning that the content of ZnO was augmented during the subsequent oxidation process, rendering ZnO and ZnxCd1−xS into a 2D/2D compact single crystal heterojunction in a hexagonal nanosheet. The experiment results showed that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 (38.93 mmol h−1 g−1) and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-6 (21.19 mmol h−1 g−1) nanosheet heterojunctions were superior to that of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 solid solution nanosheets. Electron spin resonance (EPR) and density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction exhibited a direct Z-scheme structure for photocatalytic water splitting reaction. This 2D/2D heterojunction photocatalyst not only possessed high redox ability, but also enabled large-scale preparation, which is conducive to its commercial use.
2 Experimental
2.1 Precursor preparation
All chemical reagents are of analytical grade and directly used without further purification. In a previous study, Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution derived from LDHs exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity compared with other molar ratios. Thus, the ZnCdAl LDH precursor with Zn/Cd/Al molar ratio of 2/1/1 was synthesized by separate nucleation and aging steps. The Zn/Cd molar ratio measured by ICP elemental analysis was 2.21/1, which was close to the rate of reactants. ZnCdAl–NO3− LDH was manufactured by a coprecipitation technology reported in a previous similar study.42 A classical synthetic mode was described as follows: solution A is 100 ml mixture of aqueous solutions of divalent metal Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and trivalent metal Al(NO3)3·9H2O salts with the desired Zn/Cd/Al molar ratio of 2/1/1. Under nitrogen atmosphere, solution A and 2.0 M NaOH were concurrently added into a four flask dropwise with vigorous stirring by a Teflon-coated magnetic paddle until the pH reached a constant value. After reaction, the suspension was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and aged in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained suspension was centrifuged and the precipitate was washed with carbon dioxide-free water several times. The precipitate was finally oven-dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum.
Unlike previously reported synthetic methods, solid–solid reaction was implemented between ZnCdAl LDH and thiourea to obtain the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet and the 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction. The as-prepared ZnCdAl LDHs were mixed with a given mass of thiourea by grinding in a mortar and then, the mixture was put into a crucible with cover. The calcination reaction contained two processes: sulfurization and oxidation. First, the mixture was calcined for 2 h at a heating speed of 10 K min−1 between 200 and 500 °C (sulfurization process). After the sulfurization process, the colorless precursor turned yellow. Second, the annealing time was varied between 2 and 6 h at 500 °C (oxidation process). A Na2S/NaSO3 solution was used to remove aluminum ions from the products. In this study, the obtained photocatalysts were annealed at different temperatures and correspondingly named as Zn0.67Cd0.33S-200, Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300, Zn0.67Cd0.33S-400 and Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 [namely ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-2]. Besides, the samples calcined at 500 °C for 4 and 6 hours were expressed as ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-6.
2.2 Characterization
The crystal structure of as-prepared sample was measured by a XRD-6000 X-ray power diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV accelerating voltage and applied current of 30 mA with a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The morphology of samples was investigated by a thermal field scanning electron microscope (TFSEM, Zeiss Supra 55, accelerate voltage = 20 kV) after spinning thin platinum layers on the samples to augment their electrical conductivity. The SEM is equipped with energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) and elemental mapping was performed to determine chemical compositions of samples. High resolution transition electron microscopy images (HRTEM) were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Elemental analysis of catalysts dissolved in HNO3 solutions was performed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, America IRIS INTREPID II). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Monochromatized Al Kα excitation (1486 eV). The binding energy (BE) of all elements was calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as the reference. N2 absorption/desorption data were acquired on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M sorptometer apparatus. After degassing the samples at 373 K for one night, the specific surface area of catalysts was calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI660E electrochemical work station (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China). Electron spin resonance (ESR) was conducted on Bruker ELEXSYS E500. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were studied by a commercial HITACHI F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer using 150 W Xe lamp as excitation source. Mott–Schottky plots were performed using a three electrode system in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution, where a glassy carbon electrode served as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode was the reference electrode and a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. Solid state UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded by a HITACHI U-3900H spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere, and white BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard sample to calibrate the baseline. Kubelka–Munk function was used to calculate the absorption spectrum and band gap:  
Here, Eg is the band gap of the samples, α is the absorption coefficient, C is a constant, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of vibration, and the value of n determines the direct gap semiconductor (n = 1) and indirect gap semiconductor (n = 4).
The apparent quantum efficiency (ϕ) could be calculated by the following equation:  
Here, c is the speed of light, P is the intensity of irradiation, RH2 is the hydrogen evolution rate, NA is the Avogadro constant, h is the Plank constant, and λ is the monochromatic wavelength.
2.3 Photocatalytic measurements
Photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution experiments were carried out by a CEL-SPH2N evaluation system (Beijing Au-Light Tech. Co. Ltd) furnished with a top irradiation Pyrex glass reaction cell. A 300 W xenon lamp (15 A) was used as a light source to initiate the photocatalytic reaction, and it was equipped with a 420 nm optical cut-off filter to remove ultraviolet light. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 25 mg sample was dispersed with continuous magnetic stirring in 100 ml aqueous solution containing hole sacrificial agent (0.1 mol L−1 Na2S/Na2SO3). Before irradiation, the photocatalytic reactor system was degassed under vacuum to remove the trapped air inside and ensure anaerobic environment in the reaction system. Amount of hydrogen evolved was measured at intervals of 0.5 h by an online gas chromatograph (GC 9790II, Zhejiang Fuli analysis instrument Co. LTD, 5 Å molecular sieve, TCD detector, N2 as the carrier gas). Recycling experiments of the prepared photocatalysts were also conducted to estimate repeatability and stability of catalytic performance under the same conditions.
2.4 Computational details
First principle simulations were employed by the DFT calculations using the CASTEP module of Accelrys Materials Studio 5.5 software to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction. Appropriate vacuum space was used to avoid interference from the neighboring periodic system. Geometry structures of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction were optimized using projected augmented wave (PAW) potentials and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE). The convergence tolerance parameters for energy convergence and displacement were 1 × 10−3 kcal mol−1 and 1.5 × 10−2 Å, respectively, with customized quality.
3 Results and discussion
The synthetic process of the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution and the 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction is illustrated in Fig. 1. ZnCdAl LDHs were mixed with a certain amount of thiourea by grinding in a mortar. Then, the mixture was put into a crucible with a cover. The calcination reaction with sulfurization and oxidation processes was performed. During the sulfurization process, the mixture was calcined for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 between 200 and 500 °C, upon which the colorless precursor turned yellow. During the oxidation process, the temperature was set at 500 °C and the annealing time was controlled between 2 and 6 h, which ensured in situ growth of ZnO by the oxygen etching procedure. ZnO and ZnxCd1−xS formed a tight 2D/2D single crystal nanosheet heterojunction in a hexagonal nanosheet.

Crystal structures of the formed samples are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2a, the characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnCdAl LDH can be observed. A series of 00l (l = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) peaks occur as basal higher order reflections at low angles and non-basal reflections at higher angles. The sharp and narrow peaks display excellent crystalline structure of LDHs, indicating that divalent cadmium cations have been successfully implanted into the lattice of ZnAl LDH. Fig. 2b illustrates that ZnCdAl LDH is made of nanoflakes roughly 50–100 nm in diameter and ∼5 nm in thickness. Fig. 2c shows the XRD pattern of the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet after topotactic sulfurization pyrolysis of ZnCdAl LDH precursor at different decomposition temperatures (200–500 °C) for 2 hours. As depicted in Fig. 2c, it can be seen that the crystalline phase of Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet transforms from the cubic zinc blende phase to the hexagonal wurtzite phase along with an increase in the sulfurization pyrolysis temperature. Three main diffraction peaks of cubic zinc blende Zn0.67Cd0.33S-200 (JCPDS card no. 05-0566) are seen at 28.58°, 47.68°, 56.46°, which are assigned to (111), (220), (311) crystal faces, respectively.43 The diffraction peaks of (100), (002), (101), (110), (103) and (112) planes of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300, Zn0.67Cd0.33S-400 and Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 can be indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite CdS phase (JCPDS card no. 41-1049).44,45 The transformation of the crystal structure can be ascribed to the high temperature-induced structural transformation. Moreover, the higher the calcination temperature, the better the crystal structure of Zn0.67Cd0.33S, indicating that high temperature facilitates the pyrolytic reaction and results in change in microstructure. The XRD patterns of 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction are displayed in Fig. 2d. The coexistence of ZnO and ZnxCd1−xS in the nanosheet heterojunction is confirmed by the XRD results. As the annealing time increases, ZnO is formed. Thus, a longer calcination process yields a higher amount of ZnO. Besides, the XRD peaks of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet present a clear shift to lower diffraction angles with increase in annealing time, which derives from the increased interplanar crystal spacing and the generation of ZnO due to reduction in zinc content in the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution nanosheet. Some Zn ions combine with oxygen during the topotactic oxidization pyrolysis process, indicating that this process is an O2 etching process for the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution at 500 °C. Based on the above-mentioned discussion and the data in Table S1,† we infer that the corresponding mechanism involves both topotactic sulfurization and oxidation processes. During the sulfurization process, Zn, Cd and S form ZnxCd1−xS solid solution, which is similar to natural Zn ores (wurtzite and zinc blende). Then, some S ions evaporate from ZnxCd1−xS, rendering the formation of ZnO. In essence, it is also an O2 etching process. The in situ generated ZnO and ZnxCd1−xS form 2D/2D tight heterojunction in a 2D hexagonal nanosheet, which facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and enhances the redox ability. All these observations are displayed in Fig. 1.

The detailed structural and morphological properties of Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet and 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction are given in Fig. S1 and S2.† Compared to the ZnCdAl LDH precursor, the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet still maintains the lamellar morphology between 200 and 500 °C, and the nanoplates aggregate together. The metallic ions are homogeneously distributed in the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet (Fig. S3†) and the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction (Fig. S4†), which is confirmed by elemental mapping analysis. Besides, the contents of Zn, Cd and S measured from the energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) are listed in Table S1.† The sum of cadmium and zinc contents is roughly equal to the sulfur content when the topotactic sulfurization temperature is between 200 and 400 °C. After the temperature rises to 500 °C, the amount of cadmium and zinc exceeds the sulfur content. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the oxidization of sulfur into SOx, which results in the generation of ZnO. The fringe spacing of 0.30 nm for Zn0.67Cd0.33S-200 in Fig. S3a and b† should be indexed to the (111) lattice diffraction of cubic phase,46,47 whereas the lattice distances of 0.28, 0.30 and 0.31 nm in Fig. S3c–h† should be ascribed to the (002) lattice plane of hexagonal phase, as determined from the corresponding XRD patterns.26,48 By comparison, the fringe spacing of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 becomes clearer, indicating its good crystallinity. The main reason is that high temperature facilitates the pyrolytic reaction and hinders the aggregation of hexagonal nanosheets. Besides, the in situ formation of 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunction of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS is also imaged by HRTEM (Fig. 3 and S2†). The topotactic sulfurization/oxidization pyrolysis process ensures that the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal heterojunction inherits the lamellar morphology of LDH precursor. As shown in Fig. 3b, the enlarged image clearly presents 2D/2D single crystal nanosheet heterojunction structure for the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 photocatalyst. ZnO and ZnxCd1−xS form a compact interface in a hexagonal nanosheet, which potentially benefits charge separation and transfer. In this hexagonal nanosheet, the lattice spacing of ca. 0.25 nm in ZnO is ascribed to the (101) diffraction plane of ZnO, and the fringe spacing of ca. 0.30 nm belongs to the (002) lattice plane of ZnxCd1−xS.33,49 The main reason for the formation of 2D/2D single crystal nanosheet heterojunction is that some Zn2+ ions easily separate out from Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheets along with volatilisation of sulfur under continuous high temperature treatment. For example, Table S1† displays that the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 single crystal nanosheet heterojunction contains 10% ZnO due to isodose sulfur loss. Therefore, it can be concluded that unlike a traditional double phase heterojunction, ZnO and ZnxCd1−xS are in close contact with each other in a single crystal hexagonal nanosheet. This in situ 2D/2D single crystal nanosheet heterojunction is beneficial for facilitating the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improving photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.

Specific surface areas of the photocatalysts were measured by N2 sorption/desorption isotherms based on a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model.50 The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for bare ZnO and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction photocatalysts are provided in Fig. S6;† they exhibited type IV isotherms with an H4 hysteresis loop. Table S2† summarizes the experimental results for comparison. Despite no clear differences in the size and shape of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-200, Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300, Zn0.67Cd0.33S-400 and Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500, notable change is observed in the BET surface areas. This is because high temperature hinders the agglomeration of nanosheets and results in a better crystalline structure. In terms of the same crystal structure, high temperature results in a larger specific surface area, which can provide more active sites to reduce protons for hydrogen production. Besides, the specific surface areas of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-6 nanosheet heterojunctions are also tested by BET. The increase in ZnO content improves the specific surface area of the nanosheet heterojunction.
UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the catalysts are obtained to evaluate their light absorption performance.51Fig. 4a presents the typical UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction. The optical absorption edge of Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet appears blue-shifted as the temperature increases. On the contrary, the UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS shift towards longer wavelengths with increase in annealing time. The steep absorption edge photon energy (hν) versus the plot of (αhν)2 is displayed in Fig. 4b to obtain the band gap using Kubelka–Munk direct band gap model. All samples exhibit typical features of direct band gap semiconductors. By extrapolating the tangent to the abscissa axis, the band gaps of the samples pyrolyzed at 200, 300, 400 and 500 °C are estimated to be 2.64, 2.62, 2.69, and 2.79 eV, respectively (Table S2†). This indicates that temperature pays a vital role in the band gap of Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheets, and high temperature results in increase in band gap. Besides, the band gaps of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-6 are also evaluated to be 2.76 eV and 2.50 eV, respectively. Longer annealing time leads to decrease in band gap for photocatalysts in comparison with that observed for Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheet. This is because the in situ formed ZnO results in an increased proportion of Cd2+ ions in the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution. A higher percentage of ZnO results in smaller band gap values. In brief, the pyrolysis temperature and annealing time, as two primary experimental factors, influence the optical absorption range.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are displayed in Fig. S5.52,53 The overall survey scan spectra indicate the coexistence of Zn, Cd and S. In addition, the narrow scan spectra of Zn 2p3/2, Zn 2p1/2, Cd 3d5/2, Cd 3d3/2, S 2p3/2, and S 2p1/2 are also studied to understand the microstructural changes in the photocatalysts imposed by the topotactic sulfurization pyrolysis temperature and the annealing time. As shown in Fig. S5a and b,† the characteristic peak positions of Zn 2p3/2 and Cd 3p5/2 mainly shift to higher binding energies with the increase in sulfurization temperature and move to lower binding energies with increase in annealing time. The former suggests good crystallinity, and the latter implies that the proportion of Cd increases in the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution. Concomitantly, Fig. S5c† indicates different chemical environments of S 2p, suggesting that the binding energy shifts result in distinct microstructures and electron transfer abilities of the photocatalysts. In accordance with XRD and HRTEM results, XPS also implies that pyrolysis temperature and annealing time influence the microstructure of the as-prepared photocatalysts.
The flat band potential and major carrier type of the photocatalysts were evaluated on the basis of Mott–Schottky (MS) plots measured by an electrochemical workstation.54,55 As described in Fig. 4c, the slopes of the MS plots are positive, demonstrating that the as-formed samples are all n-type inorganic semiconductors. The flat band potentials of catalysts were obtained by extrapolating the MS plot to x-axis to measure the intercept based on the following MS equation:  
Here, Csc is space charge capacitance, ε0 is vacuum dielectric constant, ε is dielectric constant of semiconductor, E − Efb is the potential drop of the space charge layer, Efb is the flat band potential, T is the temperature, R is the gas constant, q is charge quantity, and Nq is doping concentration. The corresponding flat band potentials (vs. Ag/AgCl) together with conduction band minima (vs. NHE) are shown in Table S3.† On comparison, it can be found that the calcination temperature and annealing time have significant effect on the flat band of samples. Fig. 4d shows that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of relatively high activity catalyst is between 0.7 and 0.8 V, suggesting that appropriate CBM benefits the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.
To further understand the effect of thermal decomposition temperature and annealing time on the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, we investigate the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of the as-prepared catalysts in the presence of Na2S/Na2SO3 mixed solution as the sacrificial reagent using a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the amount of hydrogen evolution increases linearly with longer illumination time. The hydrogen evolution rates of different ZnxCd1−xS solid solution nanosheets, determined from the slopes of fitted lines, are depicted by the bar graph (Fig. 5b). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of samples significantly increases with increase in temperature except for Zn0.67Cd0.33S-200 and Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300, which can be due to their poor crystallinity. Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300 solid solution nanosheet displays a relatively low hydrogen evolution rate of 2.30 mmol g−1 h−1 because of slight reduction in the Zn/Cd molar ratio. In contrast, Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 solid solution nanosheet exhibits the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (18.28 mmol g−1 h−1) than other samples, which is almost 8-fold of that acquired by Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300. This is probably because the large specific surface areas and good crystallinity with the wurtzite structure play significant roles in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. Additionally, the influence of annealing time on the photocatalytic hydrogen rate is also taken into account, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. Remarkably, the photocatalytic hydrogen rate of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 reaches 38.93 mmol h−1 g−1, which is superior to those of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 (18.28 mmol g−1 h−1) and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-6 (21.19 mmol g−1 h−1). The best photocatalytic performance of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 can be ascribed to the high charge separation efficiency generated from the 2D/2D tight heterojunction structure. This result implies that the in situ formation of ZnO from the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution is conducive to hydrogen evolution. Besides, the apparent quantum efficiency of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 nanosheet is 40.97% (Fig. S8†), suggesting that the 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 nanosheet heterojunction possesses high solar conversion efficiency.

Generally, photocorrosion shortcomings commonly associated with sulfide materials weaken the photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency, thus restraining their commercial use. To reveal the durability and applicability of as-prepared photocatalysts, repeated experiments over the as-formed solid solution nanosheets and 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunction catalysts are employed for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. S9,† there is no significant deactivation after three consecutive 4 h runs, indicating that they possess reasonably steady photocatalytic activity probably because of the 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunction structure. Besides, the XRD pattern of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS is investigated to estimate the stability of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS before and after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S10a†). Although some references report the formation of ZnS, there is no indication that this occurred for ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS.56–58 No apparent peak change is observed for XRD pattern of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets after three cyclic tests, which indicates that stability of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS is excellent. In addition, there is also no clear change for ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS in terms of photocatalytic activity (Fig. S10b†). Based on the above-mentioned results, it can be demonstrated that ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 nanosheet heterojunctions are potentially good catalysts with high visible light-driven photocatalytic activity and excellent repeatability for hydrogen evolution.
Based on the above-mentioned results, the in situ oxidation for ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets renders the 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunction with abundant and dense contact interfaces, where upon visible light excitation, the photogenerated electrons and holes are efficiently separated. Due to the limited surface area, it can be concluded that the compact heterojunction interface of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 can be extremely effective for photogenerated electron/hole separation. Then, the photogenerated electrons can be easily injected into a suitable conduction band, rendering the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (38.93 mmol g−1 h−1). The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity for 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 nanosheet heterojunction outperforms the reported data for ZnxCd1−xS-based solid solution photocatalysts in Na2S/Na2SO3 solution (Table S4†). Based on the results discussed above, the possible charge transfer process can be speculated, as shown in Fig. 6c.59 To demonstrate this mechanism, ESR spin-trapping is employed to detect transient radical intermediates under UV-vis light irradiation. ˙O2− and ˙OH radical capture is conducted in methanol and water solution by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) trapping agent, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, only DMPO–˙OH is observed with four 1:2:2:1 characteristic peaks in aqueous solution for pure ZnO (purple line). As shown in Fig. 6b, only DMPO–˙O2− is detected with quartet characteristic peak in methanol solution for pure ZnxCd1−xS (black line). For all samples, no signals occur under the dark state. In terms of a traditional heterojunction, the electrons in the conduction band of ZnxCd1−xS should transfer to the conduction band of ZnO. However, in Fig. 6c, it is shown that the holes in ZnxCd1−xS (Table S3†) are not capable of oxidizing OH− (potential of OH−/˙OH: 1.99 V) and H2O (potential of H2O/˙OH: 2.34 V) to ˙OH, and the electrons in the conduction band of ZnO cannot reduce O2 to ˙O2− (potential of O2/O2−: 0.33 V). Therefore, radical spin trapping experiments indicate that a direct Z-scheme structure is formed in ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS unlike that observed in a traditional heterojunction. The direct Z-scheme structure not only facilitates efficient separation and transfer of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, but also endows ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS with high redox ability.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to further identify the electronic structure of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS. As shown in Fig. 7a–c, the electron density of conduction band (CB) of ZnO decreases, whereas the electron density of CB of ZnxCd1−xS increases. As can be concluded from density of state (TDOS) and partial density of state (PDOS), the excited electrons on ZnO transfer to ZnxCd1−xS, which also indicates that the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction possess a direct Z-scheme structure.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the Zn0.67Cd0.33S solid solution nanosheets and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS nanosheet heterojunctions are illustrated in Fig. 7d to reveal the photogenerated charge transfer and recombination process.60,61 The peak exhibits a broad emission centered at around 400 nm, which extends to 600 nm; thus, the PL property can be assigned to band edge radiative recombination.62 As shown in Fig. 7d, maximum emission peaks of the photocatalysts can be observed at diverse wavelengths. The pyrolysis temperature and annealing time not only affect the intensity of PL emission, but also alter optimal excitation wavelength. The higher the temperature, the lower the PL intensity. Weak PL intensity indicates that electron–hole separation is more effective for the photocatalytic H2-evolution reaction. For example, the PL intensity of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 is the lowest among the values of all prepared catalysts, illustrating that the photogenerated electron–hole pairs of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 have less radiative recombination possibility, which is in accordance with the highest photocatalytic H2-generation activity. Here, the contributions of direct Z-scheme structures are observed.
The efficiency of electron separation and transportation in ZnO and ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS is recorded under simulated sunlight by transient photocurrent response measurement (Fig. 8a). When the light is on, the photocurrent density of as-prepared samples is reinforced. Compared with that observed for pure ZnO, the photocurrent density of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS is enhanced by 35%. Clearly, ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS exhibits the strongest photocurrent response intensity, which efficiently facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As shown in Fig. 8b, the EIS Nyquist plots are also studied to evaluate the charge transfer process and the separation efficiency. The Nyquist plot radius is related to the charge transfer impedance. The radius of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS is smaller than that of pure ZnO, indicating that the contact interface enhances the interfacial charge transfer ability.

4 Conclusions
In summary, 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction is synthesized by topotactic sulfurization/oxidation thermolysis of ternary ZnCdAl LDHs. Upon sulfurization, the photocatalytic activity of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 solid solution nanosheet exhibits the best H2 evolution rate of 18.28 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light illumination, which is more than 8-fold higher than that of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-300 solid solution nanosheet. In addition, the photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution activity of 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS-4 nanosheet heterojunction is 38.93 mmol g−1 h−1 and the external quantum efficiency is 40.97% at λ = 420 nm, which is almost 2.2 times higher than that of Zn0.67Cd0.33S-500 solid solution nanosheet. The electron spin resonance (EPR) and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate a direct Z-scheme mechanism for ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction, which endows the 2D/2D ZnO/ZnxCd1−xS single crystal nanosheet heterojunction with a low recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and high redox ability. The topotactic sulfurization/oxidization pyrolysis method can be used to manufacture sulfur-based semiconductor 2D/2D photocatalysts, which can be applied in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. This study provides a simple and novel approach to design a series of 2D/2D single crystal heterojunction photocatalysts (selenide, telluride, phosphide, etc.) by pyrolysis methods, which have potential practical applications.
