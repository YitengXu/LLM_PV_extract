    , Accepted 9th May 2022First published on 10th May 2022AbstractThe electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) offers an alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch (H–B) process for the synthesis of ammonia (NH3) and has received a surge of interest recently. However, as the prerequisite step for an efficient NRR, the N2 activation process over an electrocatalyst is rather difficult to be realized under mild conditions due to the thermodynamic stability and chemical inertness of the N2 molecule, which greatly limits the selectivity and activity of the NRR process, as well as the development of this renewable synthesis route for NH3. To date, a variety of electrocatalysts have been developed for effective N2 activation in the past five years, although the presented activation abilities for N2 molecules remain unsatisfactory even on the laboratory scale, and the corresponding design concepts/principles are still at the trial-and-error stage. Instead of focusing on labeling and classifying NRR electrocatalysts that have been extensively reviewed elsewhere, we herein present a timely and comprehensive review of emerging strategies to activate the inert N2 molecule for NH3 electrosynthesis at the microscopic and macroscopic level on the basis of an in-depth understanding of the physicochemical properties and microelectronic structure of the N2 molecule. We initially analyze the physicochemical properties and the microelectronic structure of the N2 molecule from the perspective of molecular orbital theory. On the basis of this, we then emphasize the microscopic electronic effects of electrocatalysts for enhancing N2 activation at length, typically covering σ-donation, π-backdonation, and σ-donation/π-backdonation effects, along with the design concepts/principles of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the driving forces of macroscopic external fields (such as light, plasma, etc.) and the local microenvironment regulation-induced built-in electrostatic fields for assisting N2 activation are introduced. In addition, the methodologies for studying the N2 activation process over electrocatalyst surfaces are also presented from theoretical and experimental perspectives. Finally, we look at the future research directions and opportunities for improving N2 activation and stimulating the practical application of NRR technology, covering electrocatalyst engineering, process intensification, and device architecture.

Broader context
Ammonia (NH3) is a primary chemical raw material in the fertilizer industry and a significant carbon-free energy carrier. The production of NH3 currently relies on the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process, leading to a huge amount of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) offers an alternative to the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process and has received considerable attention due to its merits of being energy saving and environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, the N2 activation process over electrocatalysts remains greatly limited due to the inertness of the N2 molecule, which result in the relatively low activity and selectivity of the NRR. Here, we systematically discuss the recent emerging advances in enhancing the N2 activation process for NH3 electrosynthesis at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, and provide constructive guidance for improving the activation of N2 and stimulating the practical application of NRR technology, covering electrocatalyst engineering, process intensification, device architecture, etc. This review will also be of interest to scientists in a wide spectrum of communities who are puzzled by and want to know the underlying truth about, and/or are actively working on, the activation and conversion of molecules such as CO2, H2O, O2, and CO.

1. Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) is a chemical that is essential to agricultural production and is therefore highly necessary to human beings.1–3 At present, the large-scale production of NH3 is extensively achieved via the Haber–Bosch (H–B) process (i.e., N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3, ΔfH0 = −45.940 kJ mol−1, ΔfG0 = −16.047 kJ mol−1), which is operated at high temperatures (400–550 °C) and pressures (15–25 MPa).4,5 The innovative H–B process has indeed enabled the transformation of our society and lives, and had promoted the expansion of the population.6 However, for a typical run in H–B plants, the process calls for 50% natural gas, 31% oil, and 19% coal as the feedstock, leading to a huge amount of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission.5,7 The principal requirements for processes that are more energy-saving, environmentally friendly, and flexible provide increasing impetus to expand the range of NH3 synthesis methods.8 Very recently, a suite of emerging techniques have been proposed and developed for this goal, and typically include the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR), the Li+-mediated NRR, the plasma-assisted NRR, the tandem electrocatalytic N2 oxidation and nitrate reduction reaction (NOR–NOx−RR), the photocatalytic NRR, and the biochemical NRR, which are briefly summarized in Fig. 1a.9–17 For these techniques, the N2 activation process, operating conditions, and energy consumption still need to be further optimized and improved. As shown in Fig. 1a, the electrocatalytic NRR process has attracted increasing attention, with roughly 780 publication papers presented in the past five years, accounting for ∼78% in the field of NH3 synthesis. This technique can directly utilize abundant N2 gas as the nitrogen source and water as the hydrogen source, and is increasingly recognized as an efficient, clean, and sustainable route for the production of NH3, and more importantly, is also conducive to closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle.2,18–22

The data are derived from the Web of Science with the corresponding terms or similar terms involved in the topic, where the total number of published papers is ∼1000. (b) Comparison of the key parameters of the electrocatalytic NRR including the FE, current density, and NH3 yield rate between the current values and the targets of the US DOE. 
In fact, to promote the practical applications of this technique, the United States Department of Energy (US DOE) set the target values of these key parameters in 2016, which can be used as convincing benchmarks. As shown in Fig. 1b, the present faradaic efficiency (FE) remains at ca. 60%, which is less than the corresponding target value (>90%). Meanwhile, the present current density (∼1 mA cm−2) and NH3 yield rate (between 10−9 and 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2) are also much lower than the corresponding target values up to 2–3 orders of magnitudes (300 mA cm−2 and 10−7 mol s−1 cm−2, respectively).18,23 Therefore, the electrocatalytic NRR process is still far from being applied at scale, and the specific reasons for this can be summarized via the following two aspects. One is the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has fast kinetics, thus leading to the relatively low selectivity of the electrocatalytic NRR; the HER can be effectively suppressed via limiting the proton-/electron-transfer kinetics, shifting the chemical equilibrium, and engineering electrocatalysts, etc., and has been well presented previously.17 The other is the unsatisfactory activation performance of electrocatalysts for N2 molecules due to the chemical inertness of the N2 molecules, which further results in the low current density and NH3 yield rate of the NRR. Correspondingly, various electrocatalysts, including transition metal catalysts, noble metal catalysts, metal-free catalysts, and single atom catalysts, have been developed for the electrocatalytic NRR (Table 1).

The reaction pathways of the electrocatalytic NRR process can be classified as dissociative and associative pathways (Fig. 2a).24 In the case of the dissociative pathway, the NN triple bond of the N2 molecule is first split before the hydrogenation steps, which is unusual due to the high bonding energy of the NN triple bond. For the associative pathway, the N2 molecule is hydrogenated directly via a distal or alternate pathway where the N2 molecule is not split until the NH3 molecule is formed. In principle, the electrocatalytic NRR process can be simplified as the following steps: (i) physisorption of N2 molecules over the surface of the electrocatalyst, (ii) chemisorption of N2 molecules at the active centers of the electrocatalyst, (iii) successive proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps, and (iv) the desorption of the NH3 molecule (Fig. 2b).25–27 The physisorption of N2 molecules enabled by van der Waals forces is less relevant to the chemical components of electrocatalysts.28 The chemisorption process that is enabled by the formation of chemical bonds involves the transfer, exchange, or sharing of electrons between N2 molecules (adsorbate) and the electrocatalyst (adsorbent), which involves the N2 activation process and is closely related to the chemical components and electronic structures of the electrocatalysts.23,53,54 Without sufficient activation by the electrocatalysts, the direct reduction of the physically adsorbed N2 molecule to NH3 either by an electron from the external circuit or by a proton from the electrolyte is impossible under ambient conditions (Fig. 2b). Thus, the activation process of the electrocatalysts towards N2 molecules is the prerequisite step for an efficient electrocatalytic NRR process and is also generally considered the rate-determining step (RDS).18,54–56 In addition, if the N2 activation process can be significantly boosted, the subsequent PCET steps would also be easier, which further makes the NRR more competitive over the HER. Therefore, to achieve the efficient conversion of N2 to NH3, it is highly necessary to enhance the activation ability of the electrocatalysts for N2 and weaken the NN triple bond. Recently, much effort has been devoted to enhancing the N2 activation ability via changing the design of the electrocatalyst, including heteroatom dopants, defect/strain engineering, crystal facet engineering, etc.57–59 Unfortunately, the strategies for boosting N2 activation remain at the trial-and-error stage, and corresponding summary/guidance is still lacking. As such, a timely, comprehensive and cutting-edge review paper on this hot topic, particularly based on the analysis of the basic physicochemical properties and electronic structures of N2 molecules and the corresponding strategies used to activate inert N2, is very significant, necessary, and inspirational.

In this review, on the basis of an in-depth understanding of the physicochemical properties and microelectronic structure of N2 molecules, we present a timely and inclusive summary of emerging strategies to activate the inert N2 molecule for NH3 electrosynthesis. First, we analyze the physicochemical properties and electronic structure of N2 molecules according to molecular orbital theory and briefly discuss the promising strategies for enhancing the N2 activation process, and aim to present a panoramic view of the advanced strategies in the N2 activation process. According to this, the microscopic electronic effects of the electrocatalysts for improving N2 activation, including σ-donation, π-backdonation, and σ-donation/π-backdonation integrated effects, along with the design concepts/principles of the electrocatalysts are then introduced at length (Fig. 3). Subsequently, we highlight the effects of macroscopic external fields (such as light and plasma) and the built-in electrostatic fields induced by regulation of the local microenvironment to assist weakening of the NN triple bond. In addition, we also review the methods towards detecting and investigating the N2 activation process over electrocatalysts both from theoretical and experimental aspects, using several descriptors (adsorption energy, dipole moment, bond length, etc.) and parameters (desorption temperature, desorption peak area, etc.). Finally, we look at future research directions and opportunities for improving N2 activation and stimulating the practical application of NRR technology, of course, covering electrocatalyst engineering, process intensification, and device architecture, among others.

2. Physicochemical properties and microelectronic structure of N2 molecules
As discussed above, the present electrocatalytic NRR process is largely impeded by the unsatisfactory N2 activation process due to the thermodynamic stability and intrinsic chemical inertness of N2 molecules. The specific physicochemical properties of N2 molecules that reflect their high stability and inertness are briefly summarized in Fig. 4a.60–62 It can be seen that the NN bond has a high dissociation enthalpy of 941 kJ mol−1 and a high ionization potential of 15.1 eV, indicating the great thermodynamic stability of the N2 molecule.61 Meanwhile, the N2 molecule features a large energy gap of 10.8 eV between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO–LUMO), which makes the NN bond kinetically unfavorable to be weakened through the electron-transfer process.63 In addition, the N2 molecule does not favor the protonation process, as reflected by its rather low proton affinity of 493.8 kJ mol−1.26,64 These facts above account for the intrinsic inertness of the N2 molecule, which is extremely difficult to be activated under mild conditions, and heavily limit the development of the electrocatalytic NRR process.
 Fig. 4  (a) Illustration of the inertness of N2 molecules on the basis of analysis of their physicochemical properties including the bond energy, ionization potential, HOMO–LUMO gap, and proton affinity. (b) Simplified N2 molecular orbital diagram, which shows that the N2 molecule has both paired σ electrons and empty π* orbitals. 
As for the microelectronic structure of the N2 molecule, it consists of two N atoms linked via an extremely stable NN triple bond and it has a symmetrical charge distribution; the corresponding simplified molecular orbital diagram is shown in Fig. 4b. The N atom has five valence electrons, of which two paired valence electrons fill in its 2s orbitals and three unpaired valence electrons fill in its 2p orbitals. When the two N atoms bond to form an N2 molecule, their atom orbitals hybridize to form eight molecular orbitals, including four bonding orbitals (σ2s, σ2px, π2py, and π2pz) and four anti-bonding orbitals (σ*2s, σ*2px, π*2py, and π*2pz). The four bonding orbitals and the one anti-bonding orbital (σ*2s) are all filled with two paired electrons, whereas the other anti-bonding orbitals are empty. That is to say, the N2 molecules have both paired σ electrons and empty π* orbitals, with multiple abilities in the presence of an electrocatalyst, which typically include donating their paired σ-electrons to the empty orbitals of the electrocatalyst (σ-donation effects), accepting electrons from electrocatalysts to inject into their empty π*-orbitals (π-backdonation effects), or synchronous σ-donation/π-backdonation effects between the N2 molecule and the electrocatalyst. In addition, apart from the intrinsic driving forces of the electrocatalyst, adding macroscopic external fields, including light, plasma, and others (e.g., magnetic fields, stress, heat, microwave radiation, and ultrasonic fields) during the electrocatalytic NRR process can also inject additional impetus for achieving the activation and electroreduction of N2.
3. Microscopic electron effects of electrocatalysts for N2 activation
As discussed above, considering the nature of the N2 molecule that has both paired σ electrons and empty π* orbitals, the N2 molecule can be effectively activated via the microscopic electron effects of electrocatalysts. This can be further summarized and classified into the following categories in terms of microscopic electron effects on the basis of the results of currently available theoretical analysis: (i) donating the σ electrons of N2 to the electrocatalyst (σ-donation effects); (ii) injecting the electrons of the electrocatalyst into the empty π* orbitals of N2 (π-backdonation effects); and (iii) synchronously donating the σ electrons of N2 to the electrocatalyst and injecting the electrons of electrocatalyst into the empty π* orbitals of N2 (σ-donation and π-backdonation effects) (Fig. 5). To achieve the above electron effects and enhance the activation ability of the electrocatalyst towards N2 molecules, it is required that the symmetry of charge distribution on the electrocatalyst is broken using electrocatalyst engineering, to finally generate electron-deficient/rich sites on the electrocatalyst. Also, the electron transfer between the N2 molecule and the electrocatalyst (from N2 to the electrocatalyst or from the electrocatalyst to N2) is intrinsically different from the unidirectional transfer in the N2 reduction process (from an external circuit to N2).
 Fig. 5  Strategies to boost the activation process of the electrocatalyst towards N2 molecules via the microscopic electron effects, which typically include σ-donation effects, π-backdonation effects, as well as σ-donation and π-backdonation effects. 
3.1. Electron-deficient electrocatalysts enabling σ-donation effects
Constructing electron-deficient sites over electrocatalysts can efficiently enable charge transfer from N2 to the electrocatalyst, thereby activating the N2 molecules via σ-donation effects. The desired electron-deficient sites over the electrocatalysts can be generated by breaking the symmetry of charge distribution on the electrocatalyst, which can be achieved by defect construction and supporting engineering. The construction of defects, such as via doping with non-metal atoms (e.g., B, Si, N, P, O, F, and Cl) and constructing non-metal vacancies (e.g., N, S, P, and Se vacancies), can effectively disturb the pristine periodic chemical structure and redistribute the electronic properties of electrocatalyst, thereby inducing symmetry-breaking centers and electron-deficient sites over the electrocatalyst (Fig. 6).55,65 As for engineering of the support, recent reports have revealed that semiconductor polymers (e.g., polyimide), carbon materials (e.g., boron-carbon-nitrogen (BCN)), and transition metal oxides (e.g., WO3) can enhance the metal–support interaction and afford desirable electron-deficient sites over the electrocatalyst.66,67
 Fig. 6  Schematic overview of the strategies for constructing electron-deficient sites over the electrocatalyst via doping with non-metal atoms (e.g., B, Si, N, P, O, F, and Cl), constructing non-metal vacancies (e.g., N, S, P, and Se vacancies), and engineering of the support (e.g., selecting polyimide, BCN, and WO3 as the electrocatalyst substrates). 

3.1.1. Non-metal doping. 
Non-metal doping is the primary approach for boosting the NRR activity of electrocatalysts, particularly for metal-free carbon materials, which are prevalently employed in the NRR field at present.68,69 This strategy can effectively induce electron-deficient sites via the electron-transfer process between carbon and heteroatoms. Furthermore, the resulting electron-deficient sites can be either carbon atoms themselves or heteroatoms, which depends on the difference in the electronegativity values between carbon and the heteroatom. For heteroatoms with small electronegativity values compared with carbon (such as B, Si, and P), the heteroatoms will become electron-deficient sites due to electron transfer from the heteroatom (δ+) to the carbon atom (δ−) (Fig. 7). By contrast, for heteroatoms with larger electronegativity values than carbon (such as N, O, S, F, and Cl), the carbon atom sites (δ+) are the electron-deficient sites due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of these heteroatoms (δ−).
 Fig. 7  Illustration of the different electron-deficient sites of metal-free carbon electrocatalysts obtained via non-metal doping. 
B doping. 
The boron (B) atom with the valence electron configuration of 2s22p1 has empty orbitals and an outstanding binding ability for N2 molecules.70 Accordingly, B-based non-carbon materials have been widely investigated recently for activating the inert N2 molecule. For instance, in 2018, Braunschweig's group employed borylene as a model catalyst and found that the N2 molecule can be bound by the B atoms of borylene to form a borylene–N2 complex (B2N2 or [B2N2]2−) via σ-donation effects.71 Besides, the two-dimensional (2D) boron nanosheet and porous boron nanoparticles have also been reported as efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for the NRR.72–75 This pioneering work has indeed proved the effectiveness of the B center towards N2 activation and has stimulated the rapid development of B-doped metal-free carbon materials in the NRR field.
As illustrated, in principle, the B atom has a small electronegativity value (2.04) in contrast to the C atom (2.55).40 As such, B doping has been chosen as an effective strategy to improve the N2 activation process and the NRR activity of metal-free carbon electrocatalysts, wherein the B atoms act as the electron-deficient sites.68 For instance, Sun et al. reported a boron carbide (B4C) nanosheet that was prepared via liquid exfoliation of commercial bulk B4C particles for the electrocatalytic NRR process.42 SEM and TEM images confirmed the formation of nanosheets after the liquid exfoliation process (Fig. 8a and b, respectively), with an exposed (110) plane of B4C (0.280 nm interplanar distance). The B atoms of the B4C nanosheet exist in the forms of B–B and B–C bonds at the binding energy of 187.5 and 189.1 eV, respectively (Fig. 8c). When evaluated as an NRR electrocatalyst, the B4C nanosheet delivered a relatively high FE of 15.95% and an NH3 yield rate of 26.57 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at an applied potential of −0.75 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) (Fig. 8d). Similarly, Zheng et al. also demonstrated B-doped graphene (BG) for the electrocatalytic NRR.40 First, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the authors studied the effect of the B heteroatom on the molecular orbitals of graphene. The electron distributions of the HOMO and LUMO for graphene were localized and symmetric, while those for BG were delocalized and asymmetric, indicating that the B doping broke the original electronic equilibrium of graphene and introduced inhomogeneity into it (Fig. 8e). The charge-density difference for BG confirmed that the electrons of the B heteroatoms were withdrawn by adjacent C atoms due to the electronegativity difference, so that the B atoms were positively charged with +0.59|e| (Fig. 8f). These electron-deficient B atoms can polarize/activate the N2 molecule through σ-donation effects, as reflected by characterization via the temperature-programmed desorption of N2 (N2-TPD) (Fig. 8g). As a result, the BG with a doping amount of 6.2% delivered a high FE of 10.8% and an NH3 yield rate of 9.8 μg h−1 cm−2, which were 5- and 10-fold higher compared with that of pristine graphene. In addition, recent reports theoretically pointed out that the B atom can also interact with the N2 molecule by forming B-to-N π-back bonding, which changed the π* orbitals of the N2 molecules and significantly reduced the bond order of NN, finally promoting the N2 activation process.76

Except for the metal-free carbon materials, B doping can also tune the electronic structures of other non-metal materials (e.g., black phosphorus) and transition metal (TM) sulfides (e.g., MoS2) in which the B centers also function as electron-deficient sites and the intrinsic active sites for N2 activation.43,77,78 In addition, a mass of TM borides such as FeB2, Mo2B, Co2B, and NiFeB were extensively investigated and discovered to be promising candidates for the electrocatalytic NRR due to their superior activation ability of B sites for N2 molecules.79–81
Si doping. 
Similar to B atoms, the Si atom with an electronegativity value of 1.9 is also promising as an electron-deficient center of metal-free carbon materials and enhance the N2 activation process, and has drawn the attention of researchers recently regarding electrocatalytic N2 fixation.82 In fact, the Si element has been proved to be effective for activating some small molecules such as oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), etc.83,84 As for the field of the NRR, Sun et al. computationally confirmed that the Si atom of SiC can capture and activate N2 molecules using hexagonal SiC as the model material.85 Enlightened by this, Li and co-workers developed a Si-doped carbon as an NRR electrocatalyst using sodium silicate as the Si source.86 The Si heteroatoms exist in the sp2 carbon framework in the form of the Si–C bond. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst for the NRR process, the Si-doped carbon exhibited a remarkable N2 activation ability and delivered a high turnover frequency value of 0.52 h−1. The authors further performed DFT simulations to understand the crucial role of the Si heteroatom in activating the N2 molecules. According to the results of electron density difference, it was found that the electrons of the Si atoms were significantly accumulated on the C atoms, leading to the formation of local electron-deficient Si sites. The electron-deficient Si sites, which function as electron traps, can effectively attract the electrons of adsorbed N2 molecules through the coulomb interaction, finally weakening the inert NN triple bond via σ-donation effects.
P doping. 
Recently, the P atom has also been investigated as an efficient dopant for improving the NRR performance of metal-free carbon materials. For instance, in 2019, Sun and co-workers reported a P-doped graphene for the electrocatalytic NRR and achieved an NH3 yield rate of 32.33 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and an FE of 20.82%.87 This work provides a new avenue for developing P-mediated NRR electrocatalysts and understanding the corresponding mechanism towards N2 activation. Considering the small electronegativity value of the P atom (2.19) in contrast to that of the C atom (2.55), it is reasonable to speculate that P atoms can also become electron-deficient sites for activating the N2 molecules through σ-donation effects. To affirm this, in 2020, Hu's group developed P-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the NRR process, wherein the P-doped CNTs were prepared using triphenylphosphine (TPP) as the P source at 900 °C.88 It was found that the P-doped CNTs with a doping level of 0.5 at% achieved an extraordinary NH3 yield rate of 24.4 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −1.1 V vs. RHE, which was far higher than that of pristine CNTs (0.23 μg h−1 mgcat.−1). The electrocatalytic NRR process enabled by the P-doped CNTs electrocatalyst was also verified using in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. DFT calculations were employed to analyze the electronic structures of the P-doped CNTs and to explore the corresponding active sites for the NRR. On the basis of the Mulliken charge density redistribution, it was revealed that the P atoms were highly positively charged (electron-deficient) and the adjacent C atoms were negatively charged. Furthermore, it was uncovered that the adsorption free energy of the N2 molecule over the P atom (−0.24 eV) was much lower than that over the C atom (−0.13 eV), corroborating that the electron-deficient P sites were responsible for activating the N2 molecule. In all, the above results demonstrate that the P atoms of P-doped metal-free carbon materials (e.g., graphene, and CNTs) can become electron-deficient sites to break the NN triple bond via σ-donation effects, thereby enhancing the NRR activity of metal-free carbon materials. In this regard, this strategy may be also useful to boost the NRR performance of other metal-free carbon materials such as carbon dots, metal–organic framework-/biomass-derived carbon, etc., which remain to be further developed in the future.
N doping. 
Different from the B, Si, and P atoms discussed above, the N atom has a large electronegativity value (3.04) compared with the C atom (2.55). Therefore, the N atom can effectively pull the extranuclear electrons of adjacent C atoms, leading to the C atoms becoming the electron-deficient sites and subsequently boosting the N2 activation process. For instance, Zhao et al. investigated the NRR activity of N-doped porous carbon (NPC) that was synthesized through the pyrolysis of a zeolite imidazolate framework.89 It was found that the N species of N-doped NPC played a vital role in affecting the performance of the NRR, wherein the pyridinic and pyrrolic N atoms were the active sites. Assisted by N2-TPD characterization, it was further uncovered that the N-doped NPC with its high content of pyridinic and pyrrolic N species was more beneficial for activating the N2 molecule. However, the real reasons why pyridinic and pyrrolic N enhanced the N2 activation process were not studied and presented in this work. Similarly, Wu and co-workers also prepared a N-doped NPC for the NRR and theoretically confirmed that the pyridinic N sites were closely related to the N2 activation process.90 Also, the reasons why the N2 activation process is boosted over N-doped metal-free carbon materials are still unknown and will require further clarification and discussion in the future. In theory, according to the difference in electronegativity between the N heteroatom and the C atom, the resulting electron-deficient C atom sites may be responsible for the weakening of the inert NN triple bond. In addition, the N-containing electrocatalysts are likely to decompose and generate NH3 during the electroreduction process, thereby quantitative 15N2 isotopic labeling experiments are highly recommended when adopting N-containing electrocatalysts for the NRR.91
O doping. 
Similar to the N atom, the O atom also has a large electronegativity value (3.44) compared with the C atom; thus, the O atom can highly polarize the local electron of an adjacent C atom and make the C atom positively charged. Recently, Zhi et al. reported an O-doped hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) for the NRR and achieved an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 103 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.2 V vs. RHE.92 Using DFT computations, it was disclosed that the O atoms changed the electron density of the inner alkynyl C atom and made it much more positively charged. The electron-deficient alkynyl C atoms were the active sites towards the NRR and were responsible for weakening the NN triple bond via σ-donation effects. Similarly, Qiao and co-workers performed Bader charge analysis on an O-doped metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon, and confirmed that the O dopants can effectively pull the electrons of the neighboring C atoms and create a net positive charge over it.41 Besides, a mass of O-doped metal-free electrocatalysts (such as CNTs, graphene, and biomass-derived carbon) have also been developed for electrocatalytic N2 fixation.93–95 Notably, the O atoms can also be used to tune the electronic structures of TM-based electrocatalysts and produce the desired electron-deficient sites for N2 activation. Very recently, our group proposed a hard–soft acid–base theory to enhance the N2 activation process for the electrochemical NRR (Fig. 9a).31 In particular, on the basis of the difference in electronegativity between O and S atoms, we employed O atoms to break the original symmetry of molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) and selectively adjust the electronic structures of the Mo atoms. The strong electron-withdrawing ability of the O atom compared with the S atom contributed to the enhancement of the average oxidation state of the Mo atom. It was found that the average oxidation state of the Mo atom within MoSx was greatly increased with an increase in oxygen content; meanwhile, the Lewis acidity that can reflect the electron-deficient degree of O-doped MoSx also exhibited a significant promotion tendency, as confirmed by the temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) (Fig. 9b and c). As a result, the N2 activation process over O-doped MoSx was greatly boosted, achieving a high FE of 21.6% and an NH3 yield rate of 40.4 μg h−1 mgcat.−1.

Halogen atom (F and Cl) doping. 
Apart from N and O atoms, halogen atoms including F and Cl can also render the nearby C atoms positively charged due to their large electronegativity values (3.98 and 3.16, respectively); thus, doping of halogen atoms is increasingly adopted to improve the electrocatalytic NRR performance. For example, F-doped carbon black was developed for the NRR process by Zheng's group in 2019.96 The high resolution XPS spectrum of F 1s confirmed that the F was in the forms of semi-ionic C–F and ionic C–F bonds at the binding energy of 688.4 and 684.4 eV, respectively. When evaluated as an NRR electrocatalyst, the F-doped carbon black attained an NH3 yield rate of 6.9 μg h−1 cm−2 and an FE value of 12.1%, which were much higher than that of pristine carbon black (∼3.0 μg h−1 cm−2 and ∼1%, respectively). DFT calculations were then employed to study the origin of the high NRR activity over F-doped carbon black. A density of states (DOS) analysis demonstrated that the energy level of the N2 molecule was well matched to that of the F-doped carbon black, indicating strong electronic interactions between N2 and the electrocatalyst. To better uncover this point, the charge density difference for an adsorbed N2 molecule over F-doped carbon black was then calculated and presented. It was found that the charge was predominantly accumulated on the F atoms, whereas a significant electron-deficient region was observed around the C atoms. As such, the NN bond can be greatly weakened by the electron-deficient C sites via σ-donation effects. In 2020, Zeng et al. also developed a F-doped porous carbon for N2 electroreduction, which was prepared through calcining a mixture of UiO-66 and poly(tetrafluoroethylene), followed by HF etching to remove the ZrO2 crystals within UiO-66 (Fig. 9d).44 Semi-ionic C–F and ionic C–F bonds were also observed in the F 1s XPS spectrum for the F-doped carbon. When tested for the NRR process, the F-doped carbon also afforded a remarkable FE of 54.8% and an NH3 yield rate of 197.7 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, which were 3.0 and 2.5 times higher than that of pristine carbon (18.3% and 56.1 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, respectively) (Fig. 9e and f). DFT calculations further showed that the C atoms bonded by the F atoms became electron-deficient sites due to the strongly electron-withdrawing F atoms, which were responsible for activating the NN triple bond via σ-donation effects. Except for metal-free carbon materials, F atoms can also readily tailor the electronic structures of metal oxides and render them with enhanced electrocatalytic NRR activities. For example, Chu et al. developed F-doped SnO2 nanosheets for the NRR and verified that the F heteroatoms increased the positive charge on the nearby Sn sites, thus leading to an improved N2 activation ability over the Sn sites.97
As for Cl doping, Duan and co-workers engineered Cl-doped ultrathin graphdiyne (Cl-GDY) using a facile Cl2 corrosion method and realized an effective N2 electroreduction process.98 The corresponding XPS results demonstrated the formation of C–Cl bonds as well as a Cl molar content of 6.49% in the Cl-GDY. Furthermore, it was theoretically confirmed that the doped Cl atoms greatly polarized the local electrons of nearby C atoms, promoting the C atoms to chemically adsorb the N2 molecule. As a result, Cl-GDY achieved an NH3 yield rate of 10.7 μg h−1 cm−2 and an FE of 8.7% in a 0.1 M HCl electrolyte.
Notably, apart from the electronegativity, the size of the heteroatom is also a significant factor that can influence the N2 activation process for metal-free carbon materials due to steric hindrance/geometric effects. In addition, dual-atom-doped metal-free carbon materials (e.g., B,N co-doped graphene, N,P co-doped graphene, etc.45,99,100) with the merits of highly tunable active sites and an increased number of active sites have also received increasing attention recently in the electrochemical NRR field. It was revealed that such dual-atomic sites can synergistically facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants and intermediates, subsequently enhancing the NRR kinetics.46 Of course, the preparation methods for non-metal doping (both single- and dual-atom) metal-free carbon materials also need to be further optimized and developed with a focus on energy consumption, environmental protection, electrocatalyst lifespan, etc.


3.1.2. Non-metal vacancies. 
Besides, constructing non-metal vacancies such as N vacancies (NVs), S vacancies (SVs), P vacancies (PVs), Se vacancies (SeVs), etc., can also effectively induce electron-deficient sites/regions over the electrocatalysts (typically covering the TM-based materials) and thus boost the activation process for N2 molecules via σ-donation effects.32,34,101 The distributions of electron-deficient sites on non-metal-vacancy-enriched electrocatalysts are usually dominated by the types of non-metal vacancies.102 In particular, NVs are generally the electron-deficient sites on NV-enriched electrocatalysts.103 However, for electrocatalysts with abundant SVs (or PVs and SeVs), the electron-deficient sites are the TM atom sites that are adjacent to the vacancies due to the strong electron-capture ability of these vacancies.104 Since current studies mainly focus on NVs and SVs, here, the effects of NVs and SVs on activating N2 molecules are discussed at length.
Nitrogen vacancies (NVs). 
In fact, in the thermocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3, it already has been confirmed that surface NVs over TM nitrides can efficiently activate the N2 molecule.105 As a proof-of-concept experiment, Hosono et al. designed Ni-loaded LaN for NH3 synthesis, where the Ni and the LaN were responsible for dissociating H2 and generating the NVs to activate the N2, respectively.106 Kinetic and isotope-labelling experiments and DFT calculations verified the facile formation of NVs over LaN, which can accelerate electron transfer between the catalyst and the N2 molecule, subsequently decreasing the activation barrier of the NN bond. As for electrocatalytic NRR field, the creation of NVs is also widely used to boost the N2 activation process and the NRR performance of TM-based electrocatalysts due to their unique electron-deficient nature.107 For instance, Xu et al. employed vanadium nitride nanoparticles with abundant NVs as the NRR electrocatalyst and qualitatively revealed that the NVs were the active sites for activation of the N2 molecule.108 To further decouple the significant role of NVs in activating N2, Qiao and co-workers prepared an NV-enriched 2D layered W2N3 nanosheet (NVs-W2N3) for the NRR process, in which the NVs were created via annealing in a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere, and were identified using XPS and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).103 The concentration of NVs in the NVs-W2N3 was confirmed to be 6.6 at% on the basis of XPS data. Using DFT calculations, it was observed that there was less charge transfer between pristine W2N3 and the N2 molecule, thus the pristine W2N3 without NVs cannot effectively activate the N2 molecule. By contrast, significant charge transfer between the NVs-W2N3 and N2 molecules was demonstrated, enabling the effective activation of the N2 molecule. The charge density difference further revealed that the NV sites were distinctly electron-deficient, which explained the reason for activating N2 on the NV sites. This is to say, the electron-deficient NVs accelerated the charge transfer from the N2 molecule to the NVs, thus enhancing the activation for N2via σ-donation effects. As a result, the NVs-W2N3 realized a high NH3 yield rate of 11.66 ± 0.98 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.2 V vs. RHE. Besides, several NV-enriched TM-based nitrides, such as Mo2N, VN, CrN, WN, FeN, ZrN, etc., were also developed and confirmed to be effective for weakening the inert NN bond.109–113 Notably, recent reports have disclosed that NVs can effectively enable the NRR process via a unique Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which is also beneficial for adsorbing and activating the N2 molecule, thus fundamentally facilitating the generation of NH3.106,114
In addition to the aforementioned TM-based nitrides, this strategy of NV-enabled N2 activation is still useful for improving the NRR activity of metal-free carbon materials. For instance, Liu et al. reported an NV-enriched carbon nitride for the electrocatalytic NRR and achieved an NH3 yield rate of 2.9 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.3 V vs. RHE, which is ∼5.7 times higher than that of the original carbon nitride without NVs.115 Similarly, Zhao and co-workers also constructed a N-doped porous carbon for the NRR process and attained a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 22.27 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, which is comparable to the performances of TM nitrides.116 The authors attributed the high NRR activity of N-doped porous carbon to the NVs formed in situ during the NRR process. Also, the in situ constructed NVs can also effectively adsorb and activate the N2 molecules via capturing the unpaired electrons of N2 molecules. In all, NVs can promote the N2 activation indeed, and the corresponding reasons have also been well elucidated. Notably, however, NVs are relatively unstable and can be easily deactivated during the NRR process; thus, the stabilization of NVs deserves further attention.54
Sulfur vacancies (SVs). 
Inspired by the sulfur effects of nitrogenases in the field of enzyme-catalyzed N2 fixation, S-containing species, such as the TM sulfides, in electrocatalysts for the NRR process have been rapidly developed.53,60,117,118 For instance, Sun et al. constructed ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with plenty of SVs for the NRR and found that SV-enriched MoS2 can attain a faster NH3 yield rate than that of untreated MoS2 without SVs.119 On the basis of this, the authors inferred that the SVs were closely related to activation of the N2 molecule. It was revealed that the SVs functioned by tuning the electronic structures of nearby TM atom sites.104 Using Bader charge analysis, Li's group revealed that the atomic charge of Mo that was adjacent to an SV over SV-enriched MoS2 nanoflowers was positively charged (+0.93|e|) due to the electron-withdrawing abilities of the SVs.120 Furthermore, according to deformation charge density analysis, it was theoretically confirmed that the electron-deficient Mo sites can effectively polarize the N2 molecule via accepting the electrons of the N2 molecule (σ-donation effects), thus promoting the chemisorption and activation of N2 molecules over SV-enriched MoS2 nanoflowers. As a result, the SV-enriched MoS2 attained an NH3 yield rate of 29.28 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.4 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which is much higher than that of pristine MoS2 (13.41 μg h−1 mgcat.−1). Similarly, Chu and co-workers also observed that the SVs can effectively trap the metastable electrons of adjacent V sites and enable the generation of electron-deficient V sites on VS2 basal planes, consequently boosting the N2 activation process via σ-donation effects.121
In addition, the PVs and SeVs where the adjacent TM atoms are the electron-deficient sites can also accelerate N2 activation via σ-donation effects over the TM sites. For example, Zhang's group reported PV-enriched Cu3P nanosheets for the electrocatalytic NRR process and achieved a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 28.12 μg h−1 cm−2 and an FE of 17.5%.101 Using DFT calculations, it was confirmed that PVs can significantly attract the electrons of Cu atoms, leading to the formation of electron-deficient Cu sites, which are responsible for the efficient activation and electroreduction processes of N2 molecules. Similarly, SeV-enriched ReSe2 nanosheets were also confirmed to be effective for activating N2 molecules through electron-deficient Re sites, achieving an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 28.3 μg h−1 cm−2.32 Notably, recent efforts also uncovered that these non-metal vacancies (such as NVs, SVs, SeVs, etc.) contributed to suppressing the competing HER, which was attributed to the repulsive interactions between the electron-deficient vacancies/TM atoms and H+/H3O+.32,101


3.1.3. Support engineering. 
In general, the supporting substrate can strongly affect the electronic structure of the surface catalytic species.67,122 According to this, it is logically feasible that the electron-deficient active sites, which are highly desirable for N2 activation via the σ-donation effects, can be constructed via support engineering. In fact, this goal has been realized by adopting semiconductor polymers (e.g., polyimide), carbon-based materials (e.g., boron-carbon-nitrogen materials), and TM oxides (e.g., WO3) as the supporting substrates.
Using polyimide as the substrate and Cu nanoparticles, which are intrinsically inactive for the electrocatalytic NRR, as the active species, Chen et al. deciphered the supporting effects for N2 activation at length.123 It was found that there existed a strong electronic interaction between the Cu nanoparticles and polyimide, and that the intensity of the interaction can be tuned further by tailoring the degree of conjugation of polyimide. On the basis of the electron density difference and Hirshfeld charge analysis, it was further revealed that the polyimide support can draw the electrons of the Cu atoms, making the Cu atoms become electron-deficient sites. These electron-deficient Cu sites can effectively polarize the N2 molecule by accepting the electrons of the N2 molecule, thereby decreasing the activation energy for N2. Subsequently, the Cu nanoparticles@polyimide electrocatalyst delivered a high turnover frequency value of 0.26 h−1 for the NRR process. As for carbon-based supports, Zhang et al. designed a catalyst of Ni nanoparticles supported on a boron–carbon–nitrogen (BCN) matrix for the electrocatalytic NRR and attained an NH3 yield rate of 16.72 μg h−1 cm−2 and an FE of 13.06%.124 Using DFT calculations, the authors revealed that the BCN support can accelerate the electron delocalization of the Ni particles and induce the distribution of positive charge on the Ni particles. The positively charged Ni particles are closely related to the N2 activation process, thereby promoting the NRR performance. Apart from the semiconductor polymers and carbon-based materials, Shen and co-workers found that TM oxides such as WO3 can also effectively tune the electronic structures of surface Pt sites and improve the activation ability towards the N2 molecules.51 To be specific, the authors constructed WO3 nanoplates that supported isolated Pt sites and verified that the Pt sites displayed unique Pt–3O structures, where the Pt sites were highly positively charged due to the electron-drawing WO3 support. As a result, the electron-deficient Pt sites can efficiently activate the N2 molecules via σ-donation effects.

3.2. Electron-rich electrocatalysts triggering π-backdonation effects
The above section discussed that constructing electron-deficient sites on electrocatalysts can facilitate electron transfer from the N2 molecule to the electrocatalyst, thereby effectively activating the N2 molecule via σ-donation effects. In another case, considering that the N2 molecules also have empty π* orbitals, thus, in principle, the N2 molecule can also be activated by injecting the electrons of the electrocatalyst into its empty anti-bonding orbitals (denoted as π-backdonation effects). To achieve this goal, it is essential to create electron-rich sites (δ− sites) on the electrocatalyst, and the corresponding strategies for this can be summarized as doping with metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Zr doping, etc.), constructing metal vacancies (such as Bi, Fe vacancies, etc.) and oxygen vacancies (OVs), and fabricating low-coordination/unsaturated metal centers, which covers the engineering of single-atom catalysts and amorphous nanomaterials (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  Schematic overview of the strategies for constructing electron-rich sites over electrocatalysts via doping with metal atoms, constructing metal/oxygen vacancies, and fabricating low-coordination/unsaturated metal centers. 

3.2.1. Metal doping. 
Doping with metal atoms, particularly TM atoms that have abundant d-orbital electrons, can induce electron-rich sites through strong electronic interplay between the heteroatom and the host matrix, which subsequently decreases the N2 activation energy and advances the NRR process.54,59 Furthermore, the resulting electron-rich sites can be metal heteroatoms themselves, metal atoms of the host matrix, or newly formed bimetallic clusters. In 2020, Ding et al. reported an Fe-doped SnO2 catalyst for the electrocatalytic NRR and attained a high NH3 yield rate of 82.7 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and an FE of 20.4%.29 Using DFT calculations, it was elucidated that the Fe atom sites were favorable for N2 adsorption with an adsorption free energy of −0.49 eV, and they can effectively activate the N2 molecules by elongating the bond length of NN from its original 1.120 Å to 1.136 Å. Therefore, the authors considered that the Fe heteroatoms were the active sites for N2 activation. In another case, recent efforts revealed that metal heteroatoms can also make the nearby metal atoms of the substrates negatively charged by transferring their electrons to the substrate. For instance, Liu and Zhou et al. proposed a strategy of Fe doping to optimize the electronic structures of W atoms within a W18O49 nanowire and to enhance the NRR performance of the W18O49 nanowire.34 It was demonstrated that the Fe atom, with a smaller atomic radius (1.2 Å) compared with that of the d-spacing of W18O49, was intercalated in the tunnels of the W18O49 crystal structure. Such an intercalation-type Fe atom can give 0.04 e− to its adjacent W atoms, making the W atoms negatively charged, essentially improving the N2 activation ability of the W atoms. Similarly, Zheng and co-workers reported Zr-doped anatase TiO2 for electrocatalytic N2 fixation, and found that the Zr atom can effectively modify the electronic structure of the adjacent Ti atom with the formation of a Ti3+–Ti3+ pair.125 DFT simulations further revealed that the electron-rich Ti3+–Ti3+ pair sites can effectively activate the N2 molecule through injecting electrons into the empty orbitals of the N2 molecule (π-backdonation effects). In addition, it was found that the metal heteroatoms can also provide newly formed sub-nanometer bimetallic clusters with a negative charge. For example, Lu and Zhang et al. engineered a Au4Pt2 cluster anchored on graphene for the NRR via doping with Pt atoms.35 It was revealed that strong electronic coupling effects existed between the Pt and Au atoms in the cluster, which resulted in distinct charge accumulation in the cluster. The Au4Pt2 clusters with accumulated charges can greatly activate the N2 molecules via π-backdonation effects. This was also the case for Pd-doped Au clusters on graphene.35


3.2.2. Metal vacancies. 
Etching metal compounds with acidic (or alkaline) solutions, plasma, etc., can usually cause metal atoms to escape from the matrix, leading to the formation of metal vacancies.126 Abundant local electrons would then be accumulated on the metal vacancies, which act as effective active sites for activating some small molecules such as N2, H2O, O2, CO2, etc.64,127 In this regard, the engineering of metal vacancies has been highlighted to enhance the NRR activity of metal compounds. For instance, Wen, Hou et al. observed that the NRR performance of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was significantly enhanced after treatment with acid solution (0.1 M HCl).128 To investigate the possible reasons for this phenomenon, the authors employed ex situ Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to investigate the changes in γ-Fe2O3 before and after the acid treatment. It was found that the intensity of the Raman signal for γ-Fe2O3 was largely decreased after treatment with the acid solution; meanwhile, the lattice fringes of γ-Fe2O3 also became blurry. According to these results, the authors attributed the increased NRR activity of γ-Fe2O3 to the in situ formed Fe vacancies. Similarly, Chen and co-workers also fabricated a Bi vacancy-enriched Bi2O3 nanoplate (VBi-Bi2O3) for the NRR process via Ar plasma etching, in which the Bi vacancies were confirmed through XAS and positron annihilation lifetime measurements.129 It was revealed that the activation energy of the N2 molecule on VBi-Bi2O3 was only 0.56 eV, much lower than that on pristine Bi2O3 (1.03 eV), which means that the electron-rich Bi vacancies can facilitate the adsorption and activation of N2 and thereafter the whole NRR process. As a result, VBi-Bi2O3 delivered a higher NH3 yield rate of 2.73 μg h−1 cm−2 compared with pristine Bi2O3 (1.28 μg h−1 cm−2). To further uncover the role of metal vacancies in activating the N2 molecule, Wang's group constructed a model electrocatalyst of MoN nanocrystals with abundant Mo vacancies for the NRR process. It was observed that the Mo vacancy-enriched MoN nanocrystals can efficiently enable the NRR with a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 76.9 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 in 0.1 M HCl solution. It was revealed using DFT calculations that plentiful local electrons were accumulated on the Mo vacancy sites. Then, the N2 molecule can be activated greatly by the electron-rich Mo vacancies via injecting the localized electrons of the Mo vacancies into the antibonding 2π* orbitals of the N2 molecule (π-backdonation effects), thus significantly weakening the NN bond and advancing the NRR process. Besides, similar to metal vacancies, metalloid vacancies such as Te vacancies were also found to be electron-enriched and effective for activating the N2 molecule via π-backdonation effects.130 Note that recent reports revealed that the metal vacancies can also accelerate the transfer of electrons within metal compounds to some degree, further improving the NRR performance.131 In summary, although constructing metal vacancies within metal compounds can indeed promote the adsorption and activation of the N2 molecule due to the electron-rich properties, the corresponding research on this is relatively limited because of the high formation energies of the metal vacancies.132


3.2.3. Oxygen vacancies (OVs). 
Similar to metal vacancies, OVs can also easily trap the metastable electrons of nearby metal atoms and act as electron-rich sites for the efficient activation of N2 and other small molecules (e.g., CO2, CO, O2, etc.).133,134 In general, OVs can be introduced through annealing in an inert atmosphere (e.g., Ar, or N2), thermal reduction in a H2 atmosphere, plasma treatment, etc.135 In fact, in the field of photocatalytic N2 fixation, it has been confirmed that the OVs within photocatalysts (e.g. TiO2, BiOBr, WO3, etc.) are positively related to the promotion of NN bond cleavage.136–139 Enlightened by these reports, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the engineering of OV-enriched electrocatalysts, such as OV-enriched α-Fe2O3, TiO2, etc.,140–143 that stimulate the splitting of N2 molecules. Typically, Zeng et al. constructed a LaCoO3 with OVs (labeled as OVs-LaCoO3) for the NRR process via treatment with Ar plasma, wherein the OVs were qualitatively detected using XPS, XAS, and electron spin resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.30 Due to the promotion effects of OVs on N2 activation, the OVs-LaCoO3 delivered a high NH3 partial current density (jNH3) of −20.7 μA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution, which is ∼3 times higher compared with the pristine LaCoO3 (−7.4 μA cm−2) (Fig. 11a). In addition, the OVs-LaCoO3 also achieved around a 3-fold increase towards the NRR FE (7.6%) in contrast to the pristine LaCoO3 (2.3%) at an applied potential of −0.6 V vs. RHE (Fig. 11b). Then, the authors used N2-TPD, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and DFT calculations to explore the role of OVs in the N2 electroreduction process in detail. As shown in Fig. 11c, the chemical desorption peak of N2 over OVs-LaCoO3 was observed at 365 °C, much higher than that of pristine LaCoO3 (239 °C), indicating that the OVs reinforced the N2 adsorption process over LaCoO3. Besides, the DRIFTS signal at 2113 cm−1, which is ascribed to stretching vibration of NN, can be observed over OVs-LaCoO3, whereas no signal can be seen over LaCoO3, which is indicative of the strong adsorption and activation of OVs-LaCoO3 (Fig. 11d). The partial charge density analysis depicted in Fig. 11e and f showed that more localized electrons were accumulated around the OVs of OVs-LaCoO3 compared with pristine LaCoO3, demonstrating that the OVs-LaCoO3 was more efficient at activating N2 molecule via π-backdonation effects. Meanwhile, to further evaluate the effects of OVs on the NRR selectivity, the authors compared the difference between the thermodynamic limiting potentials for the NRR (UL(NH3)) and the HER (UL(H2)). Compared with LaCoO3, the OVs-LaCoO3 presented a more positive value for the difference between UL(NH3) and UL(H2) (Fig. 11g), which meant that the introduction of OVs can not only promote the N2 activation but also improve the selectivity towards NH3. Similarly, Liu and Zhu et al. also investigated the role of OVs in activating the N2 molecule using perovskite oxides (LaFeO3) as a representative/model electrocatalyst in which the OVs were controllably introduced by regulating the molar ratio of the precursors (La(NO3)3 and Fe(NO3)3).144 The concentration of OVs within LaFeO3 was determined via XPS and iodometric titration. When tested for the NRR, it was found that the NH3 yield rate was clearly improved from 10.0 to 22.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 with the increase in the quantity of OVs from 8.6 to 18.7%. Using N2-TPD characterization, they also found that the OVs were responsible for adsorbing and activating the N2 molecule. The results above show that the OVs, with abundant localized electrons, can indeed enhance the activation of N2 through the π-backdonation effects.

3.2.4. Low-coordination/unsaturated metal centers. 
In classical coordination chemistry, coordinatively unsaturated/low-coordinate/open metal sites can be generated in complexes when the coordination number of the metal center is lower than the normal or theoretical value.145 It has been widely recognized that metal centers in a low-coordination or unsaturated environment tend to accumulate delocalized electrons; thus, in principle, the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites can also activate the N2 molecule through π-backdonation effects. In fact, the concept of fabricating low-coordination metal centers to enhance N2 activation has attracted ever-growing interest in the N2-fixation field, and the corresponding approaches can be classified as constructing isolated single-atom sites, engineering amorphous structures, chemical/electrochemical etching of bulk materials, and doping of heteroatoms.
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated single-atom sites and structural uniformity are a type of emerging catalytic material, where the single atoms are typically in an unsaturated coordination environment.146 Meanwhile, the single atoms are usually anchored and stabilized by the defects or vacancies of supports via strong covalent interplay, which further makes the single atoms easily trap the metastable electrons from nearby atoms of the support to become electron-rich sites.58,147,148 These features endow the SACs with huge potential in activating the extremely inert NN bond through π-backdonation effects. At present, metal-based SACs with unique configurations of d orbitals, including precious metal-based (e.g., Au, Ru, Pt, Ag, and Pd) and transition metal-based (e.g., Mo, Fe, W, Ni, and Co) catalysts, are being extensively investigated in the NRR field.35,47–50,52,149,150 In general, these metal-based SACs can deliver a satisfactory NRR performance due to their excellent N2 activation ability. Furthermore, the reasons for the enhanced activation of N2 are also relatively clear, that is, the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites can effectively inject their electrons into the antibonding orbitals of the N2 molecules. However, some issues are presented: (i) intrinsically strong adsorption for H atoms over N2 molecules; and (ii) unsatisfactory chemical stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. With this in mind, weakening the adsorption of H atoms to boost the reaction selectivity and enhance the stability of the electrocatalyst via support engineering, synthetic process optimization, etc., maybe become a novel frontier for the next stage of the SAC-enabled NRR field. Besides, inheriting the merits of SACs, double-atom catalysts (DACs), which contain two types of metal atom, have also been proposed for enabling N2 electroreduction.151 It is theoretically predicted that DACs may be more effective than SACs for weakening the NN bond due to the synergetic effects of the two different metal atoms, although the practical applications of DACs in the NRR field need to be explored further.151,152
Besides, amorphous nanomaterials usually feature disordered atomic arrangements and many dangling bonds, which result in the formation of unsaturated coordination sites, thereby endowing the amorphous nanomaterials with a superior N2 activation ability.54,59 The strategy of engineering amorphous structures has been intensively investigated in the NRR field. As early as in 2018, taking a Bi4V2O11/CeO2 hybrid as an example where the Bi4V2O11 was amorphous and was constructed via electrospinning, Yu and co-workers found that the amorphization of the electrocatalyst was highly beneficial for the activation and electroreduction of N2 molecules.33 The amorphous structure of Bi4V2O11 was confirmed using XRD and HRTEM. As a control, crystalline Bi4V2O11 loaded on CeO2 (denoted as C-Bi4V2O11/CeO2) was also prepared. It was found that the NH3 yield rate of Bi4V2O11/CeO2 reached 23.21 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, which is around a 3-fold enhancement compared with that of C-Bi4V2O11/CeO2 (8.22 μg h−1 mgcat.−1). Similarly, Yan et al. also reported an amorphous PdCu nanocluster with an average particle size of ∼1.7 nm loaded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for the NRR process, in which the rGO was used to prevent the aggregation of PdCu nanoclusters and maintain the amorphous structures.153 It was also revealed that the PdCu/rGO hybrid exhibited excellent NRR activity under ambient conditions. This early work highlighted the amorphous engineering of a catalyst towards the N2 activation process. It should be noted that the supporting material may also have some effects on the NRR activity of the electrocatalyst. To further solve this problem, Huang et al. simplified the components of the electrocatalyst and prepared amorphous IrTe4 nanorods without any support.154 When tested as an NRR electrocatalyst, the as-made IrTe4 nanorods exhibited superior activity with an NH3 yield rate of 51.1 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and an FE of 15.3%. To uncover the underlying reasons for this excellent NRR activity of the adopted electrocatalyst, the authors performed DFT calculations. It was observed that the d-band center (relative to the Fermi level) of IrTe4 was relatively high, indicating a strong binding ability towards the N2 molecules. The projected partial density of states (PDOS) of IrTe4 demonstrated the strong electronic interplay between the Ir and Te atoms and the resulting electron-rich character of the Ir sites. Therefore, the electron-rich Ir sites can effectively polarize the N2 molecule through π-backdonation effects.
In addition, the unsaturated coordination sites can also be generated via the chemical/electrochemical etching and doping of heteroatoms. As a successful example, Zhang et al. demonstrated that layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets containing plenty of low-coordination metal centers delivered a much better performance for N2 fixation compared with the pristine counterpart.155 Taking the ZnCr-LDH nanosheets as a model catalyst, it was found that an abundance of coordinatively unsaturated Zn sites can be introduced into the nanosheets using a facile alkali-etching strategy. DFT calculations showed that the adsorption free energy of N2 on the unsaturated Zn sites was −0.45 eV, which is much more negative compared with that on the saturated Zn sites (−0.17 eV), indicating that the unsaturated Zn sites were favorable for weakening the NN triple bond. In addition, the barrier for the rate-determining step of the NRR process on unsaturated Zn sites was only 0.89 eV, which was also much lower than that on saturated Zn sites (2.44 eV). These results verified that the unsaturated Zn sites were responsible for activating the N2 molecules and thereafter enhancing the kinetics of the NRR. This conclusion was further demonstrated using other catalytic materials such as ZnAl-LDH and NiAl-LDH nanosheets. This work provides a versatile strategy for engineering the catalysts to enhance their N2 activation ability. In addition, very recently the authors also proposed a heteroatom-doping strategy to acquire low-coordination/unsaturated metal sites.156 In particular, by incorporating a certain amount of Cu2+ during the synthesis of ZnAl-LDH nanosheets, the coordinatively unsaturated Cuδ+ (δ < 2) was successfully introduced into the nanosheets. The existence of Cuδ+ with a high degree of unsaturation was fully confirmed using XAS, XPS, EPR, and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Similarly, it was revealed that the Cuδ+ sites were also effective for activating the N2 molecules, as reflected by the relatively negative adsorption free energy of N2. Moreover, like the coordinatively unsaturated sites, metallic species such as Bi0 nanoparticles can also activate the N2 molecules through π-backdonation effects. Using the Bi-based MOF as the precursor, Qiao et al. prepared Bi0 nanoparticles (∼5 nm) using a facile electroreduction treatment (performing 30 cycles of cyclic voltammetry in Na2SO4 solution), and the existence of the Bi0 nanoparticles was verified using in situ Raman spectroscopy.157 When evaluated as an NRR electrocatalyst, the Bi-MOF containing in situ formed Bi0 nanoparticles displayed a superior NRR performance in both acidic and neutral electrolytes. Besides, several research studies showed that electron-rich metallic clusters such as Ru, Au, and Fe–Cu clusters were also the binding and activating sites for N2 molecules due to their coordinatively unsaturated character.117,158,159 In this regard, MOFs with unsaturated metal sites may also be promising candidates for enhancing the activation of N2 since their coordination environments can be easily changed via tuning the amounts of ligands.160

3.3. Electron-deficient/rich electrocatalysts co-inducing σ-donation and π-backdonation effects
Beyond the above-mentioned two cases in which N2 molecules can be activated either via σ-donation or π-backdonation effects, recent studies have revealed that N2 molecules can also be activated through the combination of σ-donation and π-backdonation effects. In this case, the electrocatalysts synchronously accept the unpaired electrons of the N2 molecules and inject their electrons into the antibonding orbitals of the N2 molecules, consequently weakening the NN triple bond. The coexistence of electron-deficient and electron-rich sites is a prerequisite for electrocatalysts to realize this goal, and, in particular, TM-based electrocatalysts are promising candidates due to the highly tunable d orbitals of the TM atoms.
For instance, Zheng and co-workers reported NbxOy nanoparticles for facilitating the NRR process, and they investigated the effect of the Nb electronic structure on the activation process of N2.161 The NbO2 nanoparticles exhibited a much higher FE of 32% compared with that of Nb2O5 nanoparticles (9.3%). The authors attributed the discrepancy in the NRR performance to the different filling configurations of the d orbitals for the Nb atoms between the NbO2 (4d1) and Nb2O5 (4d0) nanoparticles. Specifically, the Nb2O5 nanoparticles that only have empty d orbitals (electron-deficient sites) within the Nb atoms can only activate the N2 molecules via σ-donation effects. By contrast, the NbO2 nanoparticles, which have both empty d orbitals (electron-deficient sites) and electrons (electron-rich sites) within the d orbitals of the Nb atoms, can not only accept the electrons of N2 but can also donate their electrons into the antibonding orbitals of N2, thus effectively weakening the NN bond via both σ-donation and π-backdonation effects. Besides, a hybrid Bi–BiVO4 electrocatalyst was also confirmed to be effective for enabling the N2 activation process via σ-donation and π-backdonation effects, which are attributed to the coexisting empty d orbitals and electron-occupied d orbitals of the V4+ sites within the Bi–BiVO4 catalyst.162 Notably, on the basis of the similar electronic structures of B atom and TM atoms, desirable electron-deficient and electron-rich sites can also be synchronously constructed on metal-free boron electrocatalysts.148,163
In another case, the two-atom pair that is generally produced with heteroatom doping (single-/dual-atom doping) can also effectively activate N2 molecules through σ-donation and π-backdonation effects.164 For example, Ye and co-workers prepared a B-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for the NRR process and found that B-doped g-C3N4 can efficiently activate N2 molecules under mild conditions.165 Further DFT studies revealed that the B and N atom sites within the B-doped g-C3N4 were electron-deficient and electron-rich, respectively, which was responsible for activating the N2 molecules through synergetic σ-donation and π-backdonation effects. Of course, it is still challenging to distinguish which microscopic electronic effect is more efficient for activating N2 molecules at present, and this area needs to be explored further in the future.
4. Macroscopic external field effects that promote N2 activation
Except for the intrinsic driving forces towards N2 activation by electrocatalysts as discussed above, adding macroscopic external fields, including light, plasma, and other fields (e.g., magnetic fields, stress, heat, microwave radiation, and ultrasonic fields), to the electrocatalytic NRR process can provide an additional impetus for the activation and electroreduction of N2 (Fig. 12).166–168 In particular, the use of light can enable the generation of photogenerated electrons as well as hot electrons in photo/electrocathodes, which is conductive to the adsorption and activation of N2. Plasma fields with high energy can also easily activate and convert the N2 molecules to excited N-containing species. As an emerging yet efficient technology to reinforce the NRR performance, the external-field-enabled activation and electroreduction of N2 have received tremendous attention recently.

4.1. Light-field-induced N2 activation
Efficient harvesting and utilization of the eco-friendly sunlight resource is a long-term goal for researchers across the world. Integrating light fields into electrochemical systems, which can effectively combine the advantages of light and electricity, has become a research hotspot recently.169–171 A typical photoelectrochemical (PEC) system is composed of a light source, a photoelectrocatalyst, and reference and counter electrodes, in which the PEC reactions take place over the surfaces of the photoelectrocatalysts.172 During the PEC reactions, the light field contributes to the generation of photogenerated electrons and hot electrons that are derived via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) as well as the photothermal effects in/on the photoelectrocatalysts, which is conductive to the adsorption, activation, and even cleavage of some non-polar reactant molecules (e.g., N2, CO2, O2, etc.) (Fig. 13).173
 Fig. 13  Illustration of the light-field-enhanced N2 activation process using photogenerated electrons, hot electrons, and photothermal effects on the photoelectrocatalyst during the PEC NRR process under light illumination. 

4.1.1. Light-field-triggered photogenerated electrons for N2 activation. 
Semiconductor-based materials such as TiO2, BiVO4, SrTiO3, g-C3N4, etc., can form electron–hole pairs under light illumination, wherein the photogenerated electrons can be injected into the antibonding orbitals of the N2 molecules thereby assisting the N2 molecule activation.8,174,175 In this regard, integrating photocatalysts and electrocatalysts (also named photoelectrocatalysts) into a PEC NRR system holds great potential for the efficient activation and electroreduction of N2 molecules. Recently, Wang's group proposed a PEC NRR system using a Au/Si heterostructure as the cathode and demonstrated that solar light can synergistically improve the performance of the electrochemical NRR process.176 Similarly, Wang, Yu et al. also presented a model of the photoelectrochemical NRR system (Fig. 14a).177 In particular, the electrode was fabricated via depositing black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate (BP/ITO) (Fig. 14b and c). At first, the authors investigated the NRR performance of BP/ITO with (i.e., the PEC NRR) or without (i.e., the electrochemical (EC) NRR) light illumination. The current densities of the PEC NRR were much larger than those of the EC NRR at the applied potential range from −0.3 V to −0.5 V (e.g., reaching around a 2-fold of enhancement at −0.5 V) (Fig. 14d). Furthermore, the maximum NH3 yield rate of the PEC NRR reached 102.4 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, which was an approximate 4-fold increase compared with that of the EC NRR (24.1 μg h−1 mgcat.−1), and is indicative of the promotion effects of light fields on the electrochemical NRR process (Fig. 14e and f). In the PEC system, apart from the electrons from the external circuit, the photogenerated electrons from BP can also be injected into the empty orbitals of the N2 molecules, thereby synergistically activating the N2 molecules under ambient conditions (Fig. 14g). Yan et al. also constructed a MoSe2/g-C3N4 photoelectrocatalyst for the PEC NRR, where MoSe2 and g-C3N4 simultaneously act as efficient light-harvesting absorbents and NRR catalysts.178 It was uncovered that plenty of photogenerated electrons can be formed in MoSe2 and g-C3N4 under light excitation, which significantly increased the electron density of the MoSe2/g-C3N4 heterojunction. As a result, the MoSe2/g-C3N4 photoelectrocatalyst exhibited an excellent N2 activation ability, achieving a satisfactory NH3 yield rate of 131.2 μg h−1 cm−2 and an FE of 28.91%. Besides, recent reports have revealed that some semiconductors, such as BiOBr, BiVO4, BiOI, CuO, Cu2O, etc., can play a dual role in the PEC NRR system, and can both catalyze the N2 electroreduction process and produce photogenerated electrons to assist the activation of N2.179–182 Of course, the limited conductivity of the semiconductors maybe become a primary obstacle to practical applications, and there is a need for these to be further studied and improved.

4.1.2. Light-field-triggered hot electrons for N2 activation. 
Also, some metal nanoparticles (typically including Au, Ag, and Cu) can generate LSPR under light illumination, along with the formation of non-equilibrium hot electron–hole pairs.183,184 The hot electrons formed during LSPR decay and can directly enter the antibonding orbitals of the N2 molecules and weaken the inert NN triple bond, subsequently stimulating the electrocatalytic NRR process.174 At present, Au-containing electrocatalysts are being intensively investigated for the hot-electron-enhanced N2 activation process due to the intrinsic high activity of Au towards the NRR. For instance, in 2018, Gong et al. presented a hot-electron-enhanced N2 fixation process using a Au/TiO2 hybrid as the model catalyst.185 It was found that the Au/TiO2 hybrid presented a stronger absorption peak at 544 nm compared with TiO2, which is attributed to the LSPR effect of the Au nanoparticles. As a result, the Au/TiO2 hybrid delivered an NH3 production rate of 9.2 nmol cm−2 h−1, approximately two times higher than that of bare TiO2 (5.1 nmol cm−2 h−1). To understand the detailed reasons for this phenomenon, the authors studied the spatial electric-field distribution of the Au/TiO2 hybrid using finite-difference time-domain simulations. The electric-field intensity of Au/TiO2 presented a 10-fold improvement in contrast to pure TiO2, resulting in a much faster generation rate of electron–hole pairs within the Au/TiO2 hybrid. These hot electrons can be injected into the antibonding orbitals of N2 molecules and thereby effectively activate the NN triple bond. Similarly, a series of Au-containing electrocatalysts such as Au/CeO2, Au/black silicon, etc., were also demonstrated to activate the N2 molecules effectively due to the promotion effects of light-field-triggered hot electrons.186,187 In all, both the photoexcited electrons and the hot electrons can indeed increase the electron density of the photoelectrocatalysts and thereafter enhance the N2 activation process. Notably, the electrode–electrolyte interface, which can indirectly influence the catalytic efficiency, also deserves to be further investigated in the future.188
Besides, the light field can also induce photothermal effects on some materials such as CNTs, graphene, MXene, Co3O4, etc., which can greatly increase the local temperatures of the materials.189,190 The elevated local temperature caused by the photothermal effect can not only accelerate electron conduction within the material but can also boost the activation process and reactivity for the adsorbed molecules (e.g., H2O, O2, CO2, etc.) to some degree, which has been adopted in the fields of water splitting, O2 reduction, CO2 reduction, etc.191,192 In connection with this, photothermal-responsive materials may be also promising candidates for enhancing the activation and electroreduction of N2. Besides, Hamers et al. found that diamond can generate plenty of solvated electrons in water under light illumination, where the aqueous solvated electrons showed a strong reducing ability for inert N2 molecules and efficiently enabled the conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions.193 Furthermore, Schmidt et al. theoretically confirmed that solvated electrons can be directly injected into the antibonding π* orbitals of the N2 molecules, subsequently weakening the NN bond.194 The photothermal effects and solvated electrons triggered by light fields can be introduced into the design principles/concepts of photoelectrocatalysts and could be useful for enhancing the N2 activation process in the PEC NRR system.

4.2. Plasma-field-enabled direct N2 dissociation
Plasma can be generated when sufficient electrical energy is applied to a gas, leading to ionization of the gas and the formation of highly excited atomic, molecular, ionic, and radical species.195–197 According to the types of applied technologies and the differences in energy efficiencies, plasma types can generally be classified into thermal and non-thermal plasmas.198 In the early stages, thermal plasma technology was used to activate air and industrially synthesize nitric acid via the Birkeland–Eyde process,199 although due to its low energy efficiency in contrast to the H–B process this route was subsequently abandoned.199 With their merits of relatively high energy efficiencies, non-thermal plasma technologies such as the dielectric barrier, spark, and glow discharge methods have been rapidly developed. As for the NRR field, it has been confirmed that plasma technology can effectively activate and even cleave N2 molecules, converting N2 molecules into more active N-containing species.200–203 Thus, integrating a plasma-enabled N2 activation process into the electrochemical NRR has been considered as an emerging route to sustainable NH3 production.204–206
For instance, Spurgeon et al. integrated a plasma-enabled NRR system, and revealed that the plasma can effectively activate the N2 molecules and enhance the kinetics of the NRR.205 As a result, the competitive HER process was largely inhibited, providing a high selectivity and an NH3 yield rate for the NRR. Inspired by this, Tsampas et al. also developed a plasma-enabled NH3 synthesis route from N2 and H2O over a porous Pt electrocatalyst in a solid oxide electrolyzer.207 The corresponding electrochemical reactor is shown in Fig. 15a. The corresponding NRR process can be typically described as follows: the N2 molecules were first activated using plasma to generate the excited N2 species; the protons produced through water oxidation at the anode were transported to the cathode; and the excited N2 species were reduced to NH3 by protons from the anode and electrons from an external circuit. Specifically, it was observed that without the plasma activation process for N2, the HER process dominated and no NH3 could be detected (Fig. 15b). When plasma with a power of 80 W was introduced, the NH3 was formed quickly and reached to a steady state with an NH3 yield rate of 1.21 nmol s−1 cm−2 after ∼4 min. Meanwhile, the formation rate of H2 was decreased from 5 to 3 nmol s−1 cm−2. In addition, it was confirmed that the NH3 yield rate was gradually increased with an increase in the current density (Fig. 15c). The biggest NH3 yield rate of 26.8 nmol s−1 cm−2 was achieved at a current density of 80 mA cm−2, and the highest FE of 88% was achieved at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2. Besides, the authors also investigated the effect of the plasma power on the concentration of NH3 produced, and demonstrated that the concentration of NH3 was strongly dependent on the applied power of the plasma (Fig. 15d and e). The maximum NH3 concentration was realized at the plasma power of 80 W due to the optimal activation ability of plasma towards the N2 molecules (Fig. 15f). Notably, recent work pointed out that the plasma can also excite solvated electrons in aqueous solution, which can directly reduce the N2 molecules to NH3 even without any electrocatalyst.208

On the other hand, informed by the natural N2 fixation process in which N2 and O2 can be directly converted into nitrates (NOx) by lightning, recent reports have disclosed that using plasma to activate N2 molecules with the assistance of O2 molecules can also efficiently transform N2 molecules into more active N species such as NO, NO2, etc. Due to the fast electroreduction kinetics of NOx (which includes NO and NO2) in contrast to the NRR, plasma-enabled NH3 electrosynthesis from N2 and O2 has received increasing attention recently. For example, Amal et al. realized an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 42.1 nmol s−1 cm−2 using a hybrid system of plasma-activated air and NOx electroreduction over a Cu electrocatalyst under mild conditions.200 Similarly, Qiao's group also achieved a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 198.3 μmol cm−2 h−1 from plasma-activated air and water over a nickel boride electrocatalyst.209 Although a relatively high NH3 yield rate can be achieved in the novel plasma-enabled hybrid system, the introduction of O2 molecules would contribute to the occurrence of the competing O2 reduction reaction and decrease the current efficiency, which should be thoroughly investigated in the future. In addition, other external fields, such as magnetic fields, mechanical stress, thermal fields, microwave radiation, and ultrasonic fields, that can reinforce the performance of some electrochemical/photocatalytic reactions (e.g., water splitting, CO2 reduction, etc.) and which may be effective for activating N2 molecules and boosting the electrochemical NRR activity also deserve to be investigated and developed in the future.166,167,210
5. Regulation of the local microenvironment to promote N2 activation
Besides, regulating the local microenvironment of the electrocatalyst–electrolyte interface to induce a built-in electrostatic field is also helpful for polarizing small molecules (e.g., CO2, H2O, O2, etc.).211 In particular, the built-in electrostatic field can be introduced through engineering electrocatalysts to contain nanometer-sized sharp tips and designing electrolytes by adding alkali metal cations to directly polarize N2 molecules via electrostatic interplay. For example, as early as 2016, Sargent et al. reported the stimulation impacts of a local electrostatic field on the CO2 electroreduction process.212 With the assistance of K+ cations, a high built-in electrostatic field was successfully induced over a nanostructured Au electrocatalyst with nanometer-sized sharp tips (Fig. 16a). It was found that the electrostatic field significantly improved the local concentration of CO2 in the Helmholtz layer over the electrode surface and promoted the activation of CO2via non-covalent interactions (Fig. 16b). Besides, the intensity of the electrostatic field was strongly dependent on the curvature of the Au electrocatalyst (Fig. 16c–h). Specifically, compared with Au rods and particles, Au needles with the largest curvature exhibited the strongest electric field, providing an order-of-magnitude increase in the CO2 electroreduction performance (Fig. 16i). Similarly, nanomaterials with high-curvature tips, such as the NiFe alloy nanocone array, and Co,N-doped carbon, were also developed to boost the local built-in electrostatic field and the water dissociation process for water splitting.213,214 Of course, the pH value of the electrolyte that determines the form of the proton donor (H2O or H3O+) is also a critical parameter that affects the activity and selectivity of the electrocatalytic reactions.17

As for the electrochemical NRR process, Rondinone et al. reported N-doped carbon nanospikes with ∼1-nm-wide sharp tips to acquire the local electrostatic field and facilitate the N2 activation process (Fig. 17a and b).215 It was revealed that a high local electrostatic field was concentrated and formed at the tips of the N-doped carbon nanospikes and the field intensity was clearly reinforced with a decrease in the tip radius (Fig. 17c). Also, the type of alkali metal cation (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+) in the electrolyte can affect the intensity of the formed electrostatic field, and the resulting field intensity gradually increased (Li+ > Na+ > K+) with the reduction of the cation size. To uncover the detailed impacts of an external electrostatic field on the N2 activation process, the changes in the molecular orbital levels of activated N2 molecules were then investigated using high-level electron propagator theory calculations. As shown in Fig. 17d, the level of the LUMO for the adsorbed N2 molecule was linearly reduced with the enhancement in strength of the electrostatic field due to electrostatic interactions. This meant that activation of the N2 molecule was energetically favorable upon acceptance of electrons from the electrocatalysts under a strong electrostatic field. As a result, the N-doped carbon nanospikes delivered a high FE of 11.56% and a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 97.18 μg h−1 cm−2.

Besides nanometer-sized sharp tips, the protrusion-shaped atoms can also induce a local electrostatic field and accelerate the splitting of N2 molecules. For instance, Zhang et al. fabricated protrusion-shaped Fe atoms over a MoS2 nanosheet for the NRR process (Fig. 17e).216 The protrusion-like shapes of the Fe atoms were confirmed from elemental maps (Fig. 17f and g) obtained using aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). A significant electrostatic field around the protrusion-shaped Fe atoms was confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 17h–j). Using the charge density difference, it was further revealed that the electrostatic field can delocalize the local electrons of N2 molecules, leading to their polarization (Fig. 17k).
6. Methodologies for studying the N2 activation process over electrocatalyst surfaces
Studying the activation process over electrocatalysts for N2 molecules is helpful for screening electrocatalysts with a high N2 activation ability and NRR activity and accelerating the development of the NRR field. At present, the corresponding technologies typically include DFT calculations, N2-TPD characterization, etc. (Fig. 18). In theory, several representative descriptors such as the adsorption energy, dipole moment, bond length, etc., of the adsorbed N2 molecules on the electrocatalysts are usually utilized to estimate the degree of activation of the N2 molecules. As for N2-TPD, the corresponding parameters, which include the desorption temperature and the geometric area of the desorption peak, can be employed to determine the activating ability of the electrocatalyst towards the N2 molecules.
 Fig. 18  Schematic overview of the strategies for detecting and investigating the N2 activation process on the surface of a catalyst, which cover DFT calculations with descriptors of the adsorption energy, dipole moment, and bond length, as well as N2-TPD characterization with parameters of the desorption temperature, geometric area of the desorption peak, etc. 
6.1. DFT calculations
The bond length of the adsorbed N2 molecule is the most prevalent descriptor. Due to the electronic interaction between the adsorbed N2 molecule and the electrocatalyst, the bond length of the adsorbed N2 molecule can be lengthened by the electrocatalyst. As such, changes in the bond length of the adsorbed N2 molecule in contrast to that of the free N2 molecule (1.129 Å) can be used to identify the activating ability of the electrocatalyst.120,123,217,218 Besides, the adsorption energy of the electrocatalyst towards the N2 molecule is also a significant descriptor. As discussed above, the adsorption of an N2 molecule on the surface of an electrocatalyst can be divided into two main categories according to the adsorption energy: physical adsorption (10–40 kJ mol−1); and chemical adsorption (40–400 kJ mol−1). The chemical adsorption process for N2, which involves the transfer of electrons between N2 and the electrocatalyst, is closely related to the N2 activation process. In general, the greater the adsorption energy of the N2 molecule, the stronger the activation degree of the N2 molecule. In addition, the dipole moment of the NN triple bond for an adsorbed N2 molecule is also an efficient and accurate theoretical indicator for predicting the activating ability of the electrocatalyst.219 For instance, Li et al. constructed a series of TM atoms (Ti, V, Cr, Mo, Ru, and Fe) embedded in phthalocyanine (Pc) as representative electrocatalysts for the NRR process, and found that Mo–Pc exhibited the best NRR performance with the lowest onset potential of –0.25 V to facilitate the NRR process.219 To uncover the reasons for this phenomenon, the authors calculated the activation energy and dipole moment of the N2 molecule over the metal atom sites. It was observed that both the absolute values of the activation energy and the dipole moment of N2 over Mo–Pc were larger than those of other TM-based electrocatalysts, which is indicative of the strong activating ability of Mo–Pc towards the N2 molecule. Meanwhile, same variation tendency was confirmed for the activation energies and dipole moments of N2 molecules over the adopted electrocatalysts, which indicated that the dipole moment of the NN triple bond can be used to accurately estimate the activating ability of the electrocatalyst towards the N2 molecule. Moreover, the PDOS and charge density difference for the electrocatalyst before and after N2 adsorption, which can reflect the electronic interplay between the electrocatalyst and the N2 molecule, were used to identify the activating ability of the electrocatalyst for the N2 molecule.220 To precisely confirm the activation degree of N2 by the electrocatalyst, these descriptors should be synthetically considered, and theoretical and experimental combinations are also preferred.
5.2. N2-TPD
N2-TPD is an effective and frequently used technology to characterize the activation process of an electrocatalyst on an N2 molecule. A typical N2-TPD profile usually contains two desorption peaks, where the peaks at low and high temperatures are attributed to the desorption of physically and chemically adsorbed N2 molecules, respectively. Among them, the chemisorption process that is enabled via the formation of chemical bonds involves the transfer, exchange, or sharing of electrons between the N2 molecule (adsorbate) and the electrocatalyst (adsorbent), and is closely linked to the N2 activation process. Thus, the desorption peak of chemically adsorbed N2 can be used to determine the activating ability of the electrocatalyst towards the N2 molecule. Specifically, the corresponding desorption temperature reflects the activating ability of the active sites over the electrocatalyst, whereas the geometric area of the desorption peak reflects the amount of active sites. Notably, the desorption peak can be interfered with by unidentified gaseous impurities that possibly come from electrocatalyst during the heating process, and thus the combination of N2-TPD with mass spectrometry is strongly recommended. In all, the characterization technologies for the N2 activation process over electrocatalysts are still relatively limited. There is a significant need for the development of advanced technologies, especially in situ spectroscopic characterization platforms, that can efficiently unlock the true N2 activation process at the gas–liquid–solid interface, to accelerate developments regarding the NRR process.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, the emerging strategies to activate inert N2 molecules for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis have been presented from the perspectives of microscopic electronic effects and macroscopic external field effects, on the basis of a deep understanding of the physicochemical properties and microelectronic structures of N2 molecules. As the intrinsic driving forces, the microscopic electronic effects, which include σ-donation, π-backdonation, and a combination of σ-donation and π-backdonation effects, provided by the electrocatalysts can efficiently polarize and weaken the NN triple bond via electronic interactions. As an additional impetus, macroscopic external fields (such as light, plasma, etc.) and the built-in electrostatic fields can assist the electrocatalysts for further activation of the N2 molecules. We hope that this comprehensive review will help newcomers to quickly absorb the panorama of this cutting-edge research and to understand the fundamental scientific issues, as well as enlightening more experienced researchers as to the rapid development of this promising technology for practical applications. Overall, although enormous progress has been made in this multidisciplinary field, major breakthroughs are still required in both fundamental research and practical applications to bridge the academic and industrial metrics and make the technology economically feasible, for which the following aspects need to be considered (Fig. 19).
 Fig. 19  Perspectives for bridging the fundamental research and practical applications of the electrocatalytic NRR process by developing catalysis science and promoting process intensification, which covers extending the design principles of electrocatalysts, updating the ingredients of electrolytes, developing advanced in situ characterization platforms for detecting N2 activation, and intensifying synergies between catalysis science and engineering. 
(i) Extending the design principles of electrocatalysts
The past five years have seen progress in the development of electrocatalysts for the NRR process with a wide spectrum of design strategies, including non-metal/metal doping, defect engineering, crystallographic tailoring, etc.54,122 However, the development of electrocatalysts for the NRR process is still based on trial-and-error research; thus, there is a significant need to develop and extend the design principles/concepts of electrocatalysts to enhance the N2 activation process and promote its practical applications. Also, the precise determination of NH3 is essential for the NRR field, which should be further highlighted.221 This Review has highlighted the π-backdonation effects of electron-rich sites over electrocatalysts for weakening the NN triple bond. In connection with this, electrides (such as Ca24Al28O644+(e−)4, Y5Si30.79+(e−)0.79, etc.) that usually have abundant cavity-trapped electrons may be promising candidates for boosting the N2 activation process through π-backdonation effects.222,223 In addition, recent reports have also revealed that the surface S–H group of an electrocatalyst can polarize and weaken the NN bond via hydrogen-bond interactions.224,225 Besides, a surface-hydrogenation mechanism for N2 activation has also been proposed and confirmed recently.36,226–229 In particular, electrocatalysts with a high hydrogen affinity (such as Pt, Ru, and Pd particles) are easier to bond protons and form Pt–H (or Ru–H and Pd–H) bonds before adsorbing N2 molecules, and then the adsorbed N2 molecules can be hydrogenated and activated through H spillover effects. Overall, multiple design principles of electrocatalysts for N2 activation have been presented, although the design concepts/guidelines still need to be further integrated and updated in the future, with a particular need to focus on the specific structure–activity correlations.
(ii) Updating the ingredients of electrolytes
Aqueous/non-aqueous electrolytes, which act as an electrically conductive substance, are the underlying constituent of an electrochemical system, and can greatly affect the system's reactivity, product distribution, and electrolysis efficiency.230–232 For aqueous electrolytes, the cations and the corresponding pH values are the primary factors that can affect the performance of the NRR process. It has been unveiled that cations such as Li+, K+ ions, etc., can produce a favorable gas–liquid–solid interface for the NRR process via solvation effects, which typically include passivating the reactivity of H2O molecules, facilitating the mass transfer of N2 molecules, and stabilizing the NxHy intermediates.233,234 In connection with this, the Na+, Rb+, and Cs+ ions – which have similar properties to Li+ and K+ ions – deserve to be studied, and the effects of the alkali-metal-ion radius on the NRR performance should also be established.235 Of course, natural seawater, which contains plenty of metal ions such as Na+, Mg+, Ca+, etc., may be a promising electrolyte system for achieving a high NRR activity due to solvation effects.236 More meaningfully, coupling the electrocatalytic NRR with the chlorine evolution reaction (2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e−) at the anode in a seawater electrolyte also provides the possibility of synthesizing value-added products or feedstocks towards downstream industrial processes.237 In another case, the pH value of the aqueous electrolyte, which can influence the form of proton donors (H2O or H3O+) involved in the NRR process, also needs to be considered.17,238 Non-aqueous electrolytes, which include organic electrolytes (with/without water) and ionic liquids, can usually retard the HER activity, which is favorable for acquiring a high NRR selectivity.239–242 Inspired by the widely recognized “water-in-salt” electrolyte in the Li-ion battery field, our group recently proposed a similar “water-in-methanol” electrolyte system for the electrochemical NRR process.243 In the present electrolyte, the local microenvironment over the interface of the electrocatalyst can be tuned well based on the difference in proton-donating ability between water and methanol. Furthermore, the availability and the dissociation process of water (the rate-determining step of the HER) could be greatly inhibited, which suppressed the competitive HER process, enabling a record high FE of 75.9% and an NH3 yield rate of 262.5 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 to be achieved. Therefore, the ingredients of electrolytes that are closely related to the electrocatalytic performance should be further updated and not be overlooked by the general research community.
(iii) Developing the advanced in situ characterization platform for detecting N2 activation
At present, characterization of the N2 activation process over electrocatalysts relies mainly on N2-TPD.40,244 Nonetheless, in the real NRR process, the N2 activation process proceeds quickly at the gas–liquid–solid interface and involves proton/electron transfer; meanwhile, the role of the electrolyte in the activation of N2 molecules cannot be overlooked.245 As such, N2-TPD characterization hardly captures information about the N2 activation process over an electrocatalyst in a real NRR process. Furthermore, the structure and composition of the electrocatalyst usually undergo a dynamic transformation/change during the N2 activation process, which also cannot be monitored using N2-TPD characterization.130,246 In this regard, to decouple the N2 activation process properly under operating conditions, there is a great need to develop in situ spectroscopic technologies (e.g., infrared, Raman, Xray absorption/emission spectroscopy, etc.) to acquire the transient information that covers the adsorption configuration/behavior of the N2 molecules, the formation/disappearance of intermediates, etc.247–250 Besides, these in situ technologies are also conducive to identifying the active sites for weakening/activating the NN bond, thereby offering design guidelines for NRR electrocatalysts.
(iv) Intensifying the synergies between catalysis science and engineering
Apart from the intrinsic driving forces for N2 activation from the catalytic materials, intensification of engineering aspects such as the device architecture, process coupling, etc., deserves to be investigated and highlighted, which could indeed promote this fundamental research to deployment on an industrial scale. In this regard, more efforts should be devoted to developing flow-cell devices with a focus on ion-conducting membranes, liquid/solid-state electrolytes, and gas-diffusion layers, which can minimize the mass transfer limitation of the reactants and are also promising to largely decrease the energy efficiency.251–253 Moreover, the plasma-generation systems that can cleave the NN bond directly and circumvent the limitations of N2 activation should be further utilized in the electrocatalytic NRR field in the future.207,254 Notably, apart from N2 gas alone, plasma systems can also effectively activate mixtures of N2 and O2 gases (the main components of air) to obtain NOx (e.g., NO, NO2, etc.), ultimately achieving renewable ammonia synthesis through the cascaded pathways of plasma-enabled N2 oxidation and kinetically favorable NOx electroreduction.200,209 Also, the co-electroreduction of N2 (or NOx) and CO2 holds great promise for making value-added products such as urea, methylamine, etc., which is also inhibited by the inertness of N2 molecules, and needs to be further studied.255,256 In all, assembling flow-cell reactors with a plasma-generation system may be an effective approach to intensifying the synergies between catalysis science and engineering, which will indeed promote scaling up of the development of the NRR process.

Broader context
Ammonia (NH3) is a primary chemical raw material in the fertilizer industry and a significant carbon-free energy carrier. The production of NH3 currently relies on the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process, leading to a huge amount of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) offers an alternative to the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process and has received considerable attention due to its merits of being energy saving and environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, the N2 activation process over electrocatalysts remains greatly limited due to the inertness of the N2 molecule, which result in the relatively low activity and selectivity of the NRR. Here, we systematically discuss the recent emerging advances in enhancing the N2 activation process for NH3 electrosynthesis at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, and provide constructive guidance for improving the activation of N2 and stimulating the practical application of NRR technology, covering electrocatalyst engineering, process intensification, device architecture, etc. This review will also be of interest to scientists in a wide spectrum of communities who are puzzled by and want to know the underlying truth about, and/or are actively working on, the activation and conversion of molecules such as CO2, H2O, O2, and CO.
