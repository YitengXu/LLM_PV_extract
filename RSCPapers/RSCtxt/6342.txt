    , Accepted 13th June 2017First published on 14th June 2017AbstractIn this work, a series of porphyrin-based sensitizers, coded as ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD in which different kinds of thienyl groups are used as the π-linker, have been designed and successfully synthesized. Their synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical properties, and theoretical DFT calculations, as well as their applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are reported. The results showed that the power conversion efficiency (η) increases in the order of 1.14, 2.15 and 3.51% for ZnTEP, ZnTTEP and ZnTTTD, respectively. A significant improvement in the η value was achieved with ZnTTTD-based solar cells, which was approximately three times the magnitude when compared to the lowest ZnTEP-based solar cells. Moreover, the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in a dye solution as a co-adsorbent on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs were investigated. It was found that the coadsorption of CDCA can hinder the formation of dye aggregates and the improve electron injection yield and thus Jsc. The η value for ZnTTTD with the CDCA co-sensitizer dramatically increases up to 6.51%. This understanding of π-linker and co-sensitizer effects on the performance of porphyrins will serve as a guideline for the design of future dye sensitizers for DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, research involving dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been the focus of intense development owing to their potential as promising alternatives for future energy conversion technology, since they were initially reported by Grätzel and coworkers in 1991.1 This is due to their low production costs, ease of fabrication, tunable optical properties and relatively high light-electric conversion efficiency. In DSSCs, the dye sensitizer is one of the key components for high conversion efficiencies. Therefore, many novel sensitizers including ruthenium dyes, porphyrin dyes, and metal-free organic dyes have been developed and showed good performances. Significantly, record high efficiencies of 12.75%2 and 13.00%3 have been successfully achieved with zinc-porphyrin dyes, which are higher than the remarkable conversion efficiency of 11% based on the ruthenium sensitizers, such as N3,4N719,5 and black dye.6 This has inspired researchers to investigate porphyrin dyes as efficient classes of dye sensitizers.
Porphyrins are optimal sensitizers in DSSCs due to their strong absorption in the Soret band region (400–450 nm) and moderate absorption in the Q band region (550–650 nm), which cover the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions. Moreover, the flexibility in tuning the photophysical and electrochemical properties by simply modifying their chemical structure offers advantages. Motivated by the above advantages, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing new and efficient porphyrin sensitizers. As presented in previous reports, significant progress in optimizing the performance of porphyrin dyes from the range of 2–4%7 a decade ago to a record efficiency of 7.10% was first achieved in 2007.8 They concluded that the systematic changing of the molecular structure, including substituents and conjugation of molecules, has been demonstrated to be successful in obtaining remarkably high photovoltaic performance. In addition, several other groups were able to produce porphyrin-sensitized solar cells with comparable efficiencies to other DSSCs.9–15
In an attempt to prepare efficient porphyrin dyes, the main aim of research in this field is changing the conjugation within the linker group. Karthikeyan and Lee previously designed sensitizers and reported that modifying the π-spacer of porphyrin based dyes can tune the energy gap with broadened and red-shifted absorption bands.16 Wang et al. also designed and studied how the extended conjugation bridge can extend the wavelength range of light absorption.17 Moreover, Wei et al. designed and investigated the effect of different π-linkers and acceptors linked to the meso-position of the porphyrin framework.18 These reports indicated that changing the π-linker of the dyes is one of the important approaches used to improve the photophysical properties, which means improving the cell performance efficiency. In addition, the cell performance depends on the peripheral substituent porphyrins. Imahori et al. studied the effects of the porphyrin substituents of a series of porphyrin sensitizers and found that varying the meso-substituted π-linker strongly affected the photovoltaic property.19meso-Porphyrins have been the most efficient class of porphyrin sensitizers. In 2011, a meso-zinc porphyrin sensitizer, YD2-o-C8, was reported as the highest-performing porphyrin-based DSSC sensitizer, achieving a η value of 12.3%.20 This record was surpassed in 2014 by another meso-zinc porphyrin sensitizer, SM315, which featured a larger number of electron donor groups and provided a η value of ∼13%.21,22 This means that a porphyrin functionalized at the meso-position would be expected to be a highly efficient sensitizer. Therefore, the development of meso-substituted porphyrin dye as excellent dyes for highly efficient DSSCs was studied in several reports.23–28
Motivated by the superior performance of porphyrin dyes over the ruthenium dyes, our group is interested in developing the zinc-porphyrin dyes. Recently, we have synthesized zinc-porphyrin dyes bearing two types of π-conjugated spacers, namely benzene and thiophene rings, linked to the porphyrin ring at the β-pyrrolic position.29 We found that the porphyrin dye bearing a thiophene ring as the π-conjugated spacer gave a better cell performance among both dyes. Moreover, we successfully synthesized meso-substituted porphyrins using a simple method where these porphyrins can be used as building blocks for creating meso-linked porphyrin arrays.30 A series of new zinc-porphyrin dyes that contain different meso substituents were then designed and synthesized.31 The results revealed that these meso substituents significantly affected the power conversion efficiency. Moreover, the reason for the differences in the solar cell performance induced by changing the conjugation within the linker group was also investigated using theoretical calculations.32 By using theoretical calculations, we also predicted the effect of the π-linker of newly designed zinc–porphyrin based sensitizers.33 Based on the results of the latter study, we have continually studied the synthesis of the predicted zinc-porphyrin based sensitizers to compare the experimental data of photovoltaic performance and the calculated results.
In this study, we report the facile synthesis of the porphyrin dyes ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD with the addition of different kinds of π-linkers at the meso-substituents. The target zinc-porphyrins contain one thiophene unit connecting to ethynylene–phenylene as a π-linker for ZnTEP, two thiophene units connecting to ethynylene–phenylene as a π-linker for ZnTTEP and terthiophenyl cyanoacrylic acid as the π-conjugated anchoring moiety for ZnTTTD (see Fig. 1). Keeping all this in mind, we have designed and synthesized a series of porphyrin dyes containing different kinds of π-linkers as well as anchoring groups.

2.1 General procedure

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Brüker AVANCE 300 MHz spectrometer. Infrared (IR) spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR spectrum RXI spectrometer as potassium bromide (KBr) discs. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis was performed on either a Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany) Autoflex II Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption or an Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (BIFEX). UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV Lambda 25 spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra and lifetimes were recorded using a FLS 980 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on an Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT 12 with a three-electrode system (platinum counter electrode, glassy carbon working electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in the presence of n-Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte in CH2Cl2 under an Ar atmosphere. Melting points were measured using an Electrothermal IA 9100 digital melting point instrument and were uncorrected.

2.3 Device fabrication and testing
The TiO2 working electrodes were prepared by using a previously reported procedure.31 Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass (15 Ω sq−1, TEC15, Pilkington) was used as a transparent conducting electrode. The double layer thick films containing ∼9 μm transparent (PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemical) and ∼5 μm scattering (PST-400C, JGC Catalysts and Chemical) TiO2 layers were screen-printed onto FTO glass. The TiCl4-treated TiO2 electrodes were dipped in the dye solution (6 × 10−4 M in ethanol) for 24 h to stain the dye onto the TiO2 surface. Excess amounts of dye were removed by washing with an appropriate solvent. The predrilled FTO glass (8 Ω sq−1, TEC8, Pilkington) counter electrode was coated with a thin layer of Pt by means of the thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 in isopropanol solution. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sealed cell with the aid of a test cell heat press (Dyesol) using a 25 μm thick gasket (Meltonix 1170-25 film, Solaronix) as a spacer between the electrodes. An electrolyte solution of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.1 mM guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (CH3CN) and valeronitrile (VN) (85:15 v/v) was filled through the predrilled hole using a vacuum backfilling method. The hole was then sealed with a thin glass cover. The photocurrent density voltage (J–V) of the DSSCs was tested using a source meter unit (Keithley 2400) under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2, Newport 96000). The irradiation intensity was adjusted using a reference Si photodiode (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd, Japan). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured by the use of a monochromatic light source (150 W ozone free Xe lamp integrated with a Cornerstone TM 130 monochromator), a silicon photodiode (Newport 818-UV), and a picoammeter (Keithley 6485). All measurements were performed using a black plastic mask with an aperture area of 0.25 cm2 with no mismatch correction for the efficiency conversion data.
2.4 Computational details
In all of the computations, the t-butyl groups substituted at the porphyrin core are replaced by hydrogen atoms. The ground-state (S0) geometries of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD were optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)34 method in the gas phase. These computations were performed using the GAUSSIAN 09 program.35 As a model of the DSSC prototype system, the cluster model dye–(TiO2)38 systems were fully optimized using the PBE/DNP method36 with the DMol3 program.37 After optimization, adsorption energies (Eads) of the dyes on the (TiO2)38 clusters were obtained by eqn (1): Eads = Edye + ETiO2 − Edye+TiO2,(1)where Edye is the total energy of the isolated dye, ETiO2 is the total energy of the (TiO2)38 cluster, and Edye+TiO2 is the total energy of the dye–(TiO2)38 complex. Following the calculations, a positive Eads value indicates stable adsorption of the dye onto TiO2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The synthesis of the dye zinc-porphyrin targets, ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD, was processed via Lindsey' reaction,31 hydrolysis reaction, Sonogashira coupling,31 and Suzuki cross coupling31 as outlined in Scheme 1. We began with the synthesis of the designed porphyrins by porphyrin ring formation, according to Lindsey's reaction, of the corresponding aldehydes with pyrrole 2 and 3,5-di-tert-butylbenzaldehyde 3 at a ratio of 1:4:3. The Lindsey's reaction, using TFA as a catalyst in dichloromethane, of methyl 4-(2-(5-formylthiophen-2-yl)ethynyl)benzoate 1a38 and 5-(5-iodothiophen-2-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde 1b39 was followed by oxidation with DDQ and metalation with Zn(OAc)2·2H2O affording the corresponding zinc-porphyrins 4 and 5 in 6% and 6% yields, respectively. Then, hydrolysis of the zinc-porphyrin ester 4 with KOH in THF/i-PrOH gave the target carboxylic acid functionalized zinc-porphyrin ZnTEP in an excellent yield. In addition, zinc-porphyrin 5 was coupled with methyl 4-ethynylbenzoate via the Sonogashira reaction using PdCl2(PPh3)2/CuI as a catalyst in THF to afford zinc-porphyrin ester 6 and then hydrolyzation of ester 6 with KOH in THF/i-PrOH gave the corresponding zinc-porphyrin ZnTTEP target in a good yield. Moreover, Suzuki cross coupling of Zn porphyrin 5 with (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid using Pd(Phh3)4 as a catalyst and 2 M Na2CO3 as a base in THF afforded Zn porphyrin 7 in a 58% yield. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of Zn porphyrin 7 with cyanoacetic acid using piperidine as a catalyst in MeOH gave the designed Zn porphyrin ZnTTTD in a 19% yield. The structures of all porphyrin dyes, ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD, were confirmed using FTIR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy as well as by high-resolution mass spectrometry.

3.2 Absorption spectra
For a DSSC sensitizer, a wide and strong absorption in the visible region (400–800 nm) is favored to capture sunlight and thus improve the efficiency of the dye sensitizer. The UV-vis spectra of porphyrin dyes ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD as a solution in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 2a, and adsorbed onto TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2b. In a solution, owing to the similar structure, all three dyes clearly showed two characteristic absorption bands of the porphyrin ring, which consisted of an intense Soret band in the 400–450 nm region and two weaker Q-bands in the 520–620 nm region. These bands are attributed to π–π* transitions of the porphyrin. The maximum values of the absorption wavelength are listed in Table 1. Compared with ZnTEP and ZnTTEP dyes, the ZnTTTD dye exhibits similar absorption characteristics, but there is a broader Soret-band region, which can be seen by this band being progressively shifted to a longer wavelength. In addition, there is higher absorption intensity in the Q-band region. This indicates that ZnTTTD may have a stronger light harvesting ability than the ZnTEP and ZnTTEP dyes.

Moreover, the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD absorbed on TiO2 films (Fig. 2b) showed similar optical absorption wavelengths, but a broader shape of the absorption spectrum than those in solution. There is no red shift of the maximal absorption wavelength of the Soret band for these dyes and this suggests that no aggregation occurs when the dyes are adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. As expected, the broader shape of ZnTTTD was obvious and significantly red-shifted relative to ZnTEP and ZnTTEP. In contrast, the slight blue shift of one of the Q-bands can be attributed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic group upon the dye being adsorbed on TiO2, which is commonly observed in the response of an organic dye with a carboxylic anchoring group. Furthermore, the fluorescence spectra and lifetime of all three dyes were measured (Fig. S1, ESI†), and our results show a fluorescence maximum emission at 600–610 nm and 1.0–1.8 ns lifetime, which is in accordance with previous studies.40–42
3.3 Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration processes in DSSCs, the electrochemical properties of the ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD dyes were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Dyes ZnTEP and ZnTTEP exhibited three quasi-reversible oxidation processes, whereas ZnTTTD showed four quasi-reversible oxidation processes. The first and second oxidation potentials (0.71–0.78 and 0.95–1.07) are assigned to the removal of an electron from the porphyrin ring. On the other hand, the process of reduction was found to be less than that of the oxidation. Dyes ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD exhibited two quasi-reversible reduction processes. The first reduction waves of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD (−1.39, −1.36 and −0.83 eV) are assigned to the reduction of porphyrin to form an anion radical, whereas the second reduction waves of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD (−1.71, −1.66 and −1.39 eV) are assigned to the reduction of the carboxyl group.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of dyes ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD measured in CH2Cl2 and n-Bu4NPF6 as electrolyte. 
Furthermore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD were calculated from the oxidation onset potentials and energy gaps, and the results are reported in Table 1. Their HOMO levels are −5.18, −5.14 and −5.07 eV for ZnTEP, ZnTTEP and ZnTTTD, respectively, which are relatively lower than the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.8 eV). Thus, the process of dye regeneration from the redox couple to the oxidized dye should be thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, the LUMO levels of the dyes are −3.20 eV for ZnTEP, −3.15 eV for ZnTTEP, and −3.07 eV for ZnTTTD, which are relatively less negative than the conduction band (CB)-edge energy level of the TiO2 electrode (−4.00 eV vs. vacuum). Thus, it is evident that the charge injection process should be an energetically efficient driving force to the CB of TiO2 from the LUMO of the excited dyes.
3.4 DFT and TD-DFT calculations
For a deeper understanding of the different π-linker effects on the molecular orbital distributions of dyes ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP level with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. It is very useful to determine the HOMO and the LUMO contributions of these analogues since these can provide a reasonable qualitative indication of the electron transfer of dye sensitizers.
The electronic density distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD are shown in Fig. 4. As shown, the distributions of electron density in the HOMO orbitals are dominantly localized over the whole conjugated porphyrin ring. In the case of ZnTTEP and ZnTTTD dyes, some electron density is found to be spread over the trithiophene linker part due to their extended π-conjugated linker compared to the thiophene linker of the ZnTEP dye. This reveals that different substituted π-linkers at the meso-substituted porphyrin do not change the donating ability of the porphyrin core, while it is feasible that only the π-conjugation lengths are extended.
 Fig. 4  The electron density distribution in the HOMO and LUMO of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. 
In contrast, the distributions of electron density in the LUMO orbitals are obviously different. As we know, under the intramolecular charge transfer state upon excitation, the electron density should be attributed to the acceptor moieties. As interpreted in Fig. 4, for both ZnTEP and ZnTTEP dyes, which consist of carboxylic acid acting as an acceptor group, the electron density is mainly located on the functionalized porphyrin. Although the main part of the electron density distribution is similar, the delocalization of electrons of the longer π-linker of the bithiophene unit for ZnTTEP was found to be partly spread on substituent linkages with very small contributions on the carboxylic acid group. This indicates that the bithiophene π-linker can promote intramolecular electron transfer to the carboxylic acid anchoring groups better than the short π-linker of ZnTEP.
On the other hand, for the ZnTTTD dye, which has the trithiophene π-linker and cyanocrylic acid acting as an acceptor group, it is observed that the electron density is mainly located over the π-linker and cyanocrylic acid group, whereas there is no electron density localized on the porphyrin core in the LUMO. As we mentioned above, the delocalization of electron density on an acceptor or anchoring group in the LUMO is very important due to the possibility that it can be injected from the LUMO level into the conduction band of TiO2. Our calculations indicated that the dyes with the trithiophene π-linker can provide a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process from the donor to the π-linker. Moreover, designing a dye with a trithiophene π-linker incorporated with cyanocrylic acid can provide a stronger electron transfer from the donors or the porphyrin macrocycles to the acceptor or the anchoring moiety, thus, enabling the electron injection processes.43 This may be one of the reasons that accounts for the highest efficiency of the ZnTTTD dye in this report.
To elucidate the correlation of the particular power conversion efficiency (η) when the dyes were adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, we studied the ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD dyes adsorbed on (TiO2)38 units as the complex structures of dye–TiO2. In the complex structures, the relaxed dye–TiO2 structures were calculated using the PBE functional together with the Double-numerical as implemented in the DMol3 program of the Material Studio software suite. The optimized structures of the dye–(TiO2)38 structures are shown in Fig. 5. These three dyes showed the bond distances of the bidentate bridging adsorption mode between 5c-Ti and the O atom of the dyes to be in the range of 2.048–2.248 Å. The calculated adsorption energies (Eads) and their molecular dipole moments of all complex structures were calculated and are reported in Table 2. The calculated Eads of the three dyes adsorbed on TiO2 was in the range of 25–28 kcal mol−1, indicating the strong interactions between the dyes and the TiO2 surface. Among these three dyes, the Eads value for ZnTTTD was relatively higher than the others, which could be explained by the stronger electron withdrawing property of the cyanocrylic acid group.

In addition, to consider the dipole moment of the dyes adsorbed on (TiO2)38 clusters, we considered the y-axis of the complex structures as shown in Fig. 5, which is perpendicular to the TiO2 surface. It is interesting that the calculated dipole moments along the y-axis (μy) of the dyes increased in the order of ZnTEP (20.30) < ZnTTEP (22.82) < ZnTTTD (25.16). This indicates that a stronger ICT property was found for ZnTTTD, which was additional to the cyanocrylic acid group. From the calculated results of the dyes adsorbed on the (TiO2)38 clusters, ZnTTTD exhibited both the highest Eads and μy, which might support the highest η value of the experimental results.
3.5 Photovoltaic performance
In this work, we synthesized three novel porphyrin dye molecules with different π-linkers linked at the meso-position, coded as ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD dyes. To study the influence of different π-linkers on the DSSC device performance, the photovoltaic properties of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD as sensitizers for dye-sensitized nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 solar cells (DSSCs) were investigated. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots are shown in Fig. 6(a), and the resulting photovoltaic parameters (average values) are summarized in Table 3. Although the UV spectral responses of ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD are similar, as observed in Fig. 2, the overall power conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC devices is obviously different. As shown in Table 2, the ZnTTTD dye exhibited the highest η of 3.51%, whereas the ZnTTEP and ZnTEP dyes showed a lower η of 2.15% and 1.14%, respectively.

To explain this difference, the corresponding detailed photovoltaic performance parameters will be discussed. As listed in Table 2, the ZnTEP- and ZnTTEP-sensitized cells gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 2.71 and 5.30 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58 and 0.58 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72 and 0.70, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 1.14% and 2.15%, respectively. Under the same conditions, the ZnTTTD-sensitized cells exhibited a Jsc of 9.34 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.57 V, and a FF of 0.67, corresponding to a η of 3.51%. The ZnTTTD-based cells exhibit the best performances (highest η), clearly due to their high Jsc value, whereas others parameters (Voc and FF) are almost the same. As we all know, the Jsc parameter is attributed to the light harvesting efficiency, which can be determined by the IPCE. Therefore, IPCEs for DSSCs based on the three dyes are discussed. As shown in Fig. 6(b), it is obvious that two peaks are located in the ranges 400–500 nm and 500–650 nm, respectively, which are in agreement with the UV-visible absorption spectra of the dyes. Besides, it was found that ZnTEP and ZnTTEP possess lower IPCEs values at the Soret and Q absorption bands than ZnTTTD, which is consistent with the trends of the corresponding Jsc parameter. It can be concluded from these results that the large Jsc values of the ZnTTTD-based cells might arise from the effect of the more intense covering of the IPCE spectra, which is in good agreement with previous reports.24,44–46 Finally, ZnTTTD with the strong withdrawing group (CN) shows the strongest ICT property resulting in the calculated dipole moments along the y-axis (μy) of the dyes increasing in the order of ZnTEP (20.30) < ZnTTEP (22.82) < ZnTTTD (25.16). These calculated results correspond to the Jsc (mA cm−2) values from experimental observation which increase in the order of ZnTEP (2.71) < ZnTTEP (5.30) < ZnTTTD (9.34).
These data clearly confirm the achievement of the maximum conversion efficiency for the cells sensitized with ZnTTTD.
According to the planarity of the Zn-porphyrin core and the π-linkers, the formation of π–π stacked dyes may experience strong tendency to aggregate on the TiO2 surface. It has been known that dye aggregation can directly affect the photoelectron injection efficiency of the dye and thereby the overall conversion efficiency. The breakup of π-stacked aggregates might improve the electron injection yield and thus Jsc. Generally, the utilization of a co-adsorbent is effective for suppressing dye aggregation, and thus enhancing the Jsc. The influence of PEP dye aggregation on TiO2 was therefore further investigated, in this respect; chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the most commonly used due to its nonplanar and bulky configuration. An appropriate amount of CDCA (dye:CDCA ratio of 1:15) was added to a dye solution. It was found that the coadsorption of CDCA can hinder the formation of dye aggregates and improve the electron injection yield and thus Jsc. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs based on the three dyes with CDCA as a co-adsorbent. The relevant data to the J–V curves are listed in Table 2. The data show that the conversion efficiencies for all the DSSCs are improved upon adding CDCA, and they follow the same order as the CDCA-free cells: ZnTEP (3.02%) < ZnTTEP (4.46%) < ZnTTTD (6.17%). The ZnTTTD:CDCA-based cell exhibits the highest cell performance with a η of 6.17% (Jsc = 13.24 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.66 mV; FF = 0.70).

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized and characterized a series of novel porphyrin derivatives, ZnTEP, ZnTTEP, and ZnTTTD, with different π-linkers at the meso-position as organic dyes for DSSC applications. The effect of the π-linkers on the photovoltaic performance has been systematically investigated. All dyes showed a wide absorption range with high intensity and are proven by cyclic voltammetry to have the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels to serve as the photosensitizers in DSSCs. Compared with ZnTEP and ZnTTEP, the ZnTTTD-based cells exhibited superior photovoltaic performance. The ZnTTTD sensitizer cell gives a Jsc of 9.34 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.57, and a FF of 0.67, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 3.51%. Herein, it is demonstrated that CDCA co-sensitizers on the TiO2 photo-electrode could reduce the aggregation of the ZnTTTD-based dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, leading to enhancement of the short circuit current (Jsc).
