    , Accepted 3rd June 2017First published on 5th June 2017AbstractCdTe-based photocathodes have shown an extremely high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCEs) of >95% at 560–660 nm with an applied potential of 0 VRHE. In the present study, the effects of a back contact and annealing in the presence of CdCl2 on the PEC properties of CdTe-based photocathodes were investigated. Structural characterization demonstrated that the grain structure of CdTe thin films deposited on Cu and/or Au-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates was significantly affected. These structural differences were attributed to Cu diffusion during the CdTe deposition process and to the characteristics of the interfaces between the CdTe layer and the substrate. Further investigations also determined that the CdCl2 treatment eliminated impurities in the CdTe films. PEC measurements revealed that Pt- and CdS-modified CdTe photocathodes deposited on Cu and Au-coated FTO substrates exhibited three times higher half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH) values than a reported photocathode prepared on an FTO substrate. This enhancement resulted from the improved structural properties and the facilitated charge transfer between the CdTe and the substrate through the thinning of the Schottky barrier and the relatively large work function of Au. CdCl2 treatment further improved the extent of hydrogen evolution from water when using CdTe-based photocathodes; a photocathode treated with CdCl2 produced a relatively large cathodic photocurrent of −22 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight. In addition, the HC-STH for this device was 3.7% at 0.3 VRHE. The photocathodes generated relatively stable photocurrents over 70 min and evolved hydrogen with a faradaic efficiency of approximately 100%.
1. Introduction
Increasing global energy requirements and associated environmental issues have led to a pressing need for clean, renewable fuels that can be generated from sunlight, so as to store and use readily available solar energy as needed.1–6 Recently, there has been significant interest in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes, since this represents a promising means of directly converting solar energy into chemical energy by producing hydrogen.7–17 Hydrogen obtained via water splitting using solar energy is regarded as a clean fuel because it can be made in an environmentally friendly manner and produces only water during combustion. The photoelectrode is the central part of a PEC water splitting system. To obtain efficient water splitting utilizing sunlight, the photoelectrode must have a long absorption edge wavelength and must be able to utilize photoexcited carriers for the water splitting reactions. Efficient utilization of photoexcited carriers requires a photoelectrode with a suitably low concentration of defects, including grain boundaries that may otherwise function as recombination centers. The photoelectrode materials may also require surface and backside modifications. Surface modifications with functional layers and catalysts are indispensable to facilitating the reactions taking place on the photoelectrode surface,18–21,35,39–43 while backside contacts enhance charge transfer from the photoelectrode to the counter electrode through the external circuit. It is preferable to use a back-contact material with a larger work function than that of the photocathode material so as to obtain an ohmic contact that allows the smooth transfer of the majority carriers (that is, holes) to the external circuit.10,19,21
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) has a number of properties that are directly applicable to PEC water splitting, such as a sufficiently long absorption edge wavelength of 830 nm and a high light absorption coefficient of >104 cm−1 below 800 nm.22,23 Moreover, CdTe in the polycrystalline state has been employed as an absorbing material in thin film photovoltaic devices.22–24 Assuming a quantum yield of unity, the photocurrent generated by CdTe could potentially be as high as 29 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G light. Because of these attractive properties, there have been a number of studies regarding the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties of CdTe.25–28 Ohashi et al. issued the first report concerning PEC water splitting using p-type CdTe.26 Since then, the properties of CdTe-based photocathodes, including the associated Pourbaix diagram, the flat-band potential in various electrolytes, and enhancement of the photocurrent by surface modification with Pt, have been investigated.27,28 Recently, Lichterman et al. reported a photoanode fabricated from a single-crystal wafer of n-type CdTe which, when coated with TiO2 and Ni, exhibited stable, stoichiometric oxygen evolution from water.29 Very recently, our own group demonstrated a photocathode composed of a polycrystalline CdTe thin film prepared on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate.12 This device showed a significantly enhanced cathodic photocurrent following surface modification with a CdS layer and a Pt catalyst. However, the observed cathodic photocurrent of 6.0 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE was much less than the 29 mA cm−2 that would be expected based on the absorption edge for this material. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include insufficient crystallinity and the resistance at the contact interface between the CdTe and the FTO. Our previous results suggested the possibility of further increasing hydrogen evolution from water over CdTe-based photocathodes through improving the crystallinity of the CdTe layer and reducing the resistivity at the back contact.
In the present study, we demonstrated the potential of CdTe as a photocathode material by obtaining an extremely high external quantum efficiency during hydrogen evolution from water. As discussed above, CdTe-based photocathodes prepared on FTO substrates still have two major issues – crystallinity and back-contact resistance. To overcome these drawbacks, we examined post-deposition treatment of CdTe thin films prepared on FTO and also applied additional back-contact layers. It has been reported that doping CdTe with Cu tends to form an ohmic contact,30,31 and that Au is preferable as a contact material with p-type semiconductors because of its large work function and low resistivity. Thus, to facilitate hydrogen evolution over CdTe-based photocathodes, a Cu/Au layer structure was assessed as a means of enhancing the charge transfer between the CdTe and the FTO. In addition, post-deposition annealing of the CdTe layers with CdCl2 as a sintering additive was examined. Using these modifications, the cathodic photocurrent density obtained from CdTe photocathodes incorporating a Cu/Au back contact and treated with CdCl2 reached 22 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight. In addition, a maximum half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH) for these photocathodes of 3.7% was obtained at approximately 0.3 VRHE. Finally, an extremely high 95% incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) at 0 VRHE was observed at wavelengths of 560 and 660 nm.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of CdTe thin films
Prior to depositing the CdTe film, the SnO2:F coated glass (FTO) substrate was cleaned by ultra-sonication for 30 min in 30 mL of a 1:1:1 (by volume) mixture of acetone, isopropanol and distilled water. The substrate was subsequently sonicated in distilled water and then dried by blowing nitrogen. Following this, 6 nm-thick Cu and 80 nm-thick Au layers were deposited on the substrate by vacuum evaporation. A thin CdTe film was formed using the close spaced sublimation (CSS) method.22,23 A 2 μm-thick CdTe thin film was obtained by thermal evaporation of CdTe (99.9999% purity) in an alumina crucible. During this process, the CdTe deposition rate was controlled by adjusting the power applied to the heater. After the substrate was placed in the deposition chamber, the chamber was evacuated using a rotary pump and then filled with Ar to a partial pressure of 1.5 Pa, applying an Ar flow rate of 20 sccm. Following this pressure adjustment but before film deposition, the substrate was annealed at 550 °C for 30 min to remove surface contamination. The CdTe layer was then deposited on the thermally cleaned substrate over a period of 12 min, employing a substrate temperature of 400 °C. The resulting film was then annealed in the presence of CdCl2 as a sintering additive. The specimens were soaked in a methanol solution containing 2 g CdCl2 per 100 mL for 3 s, followed by annealing in air at 400 °C for 5 min using a muffle furnace.32–34 The effects of the annealing conditions are summarized in the (ESI), as shown in Fig. S4 and S5.†
2.2 Surface modification and preparation of CdTe photocathodes
To facilitate charge separation at the solid–liquid interface, a thin n-type semiconducting layer of approximately 80 nm-thick CdS was formed by chemical bath deposition (CBD) over 8 min.35 Before the CBD, the CdTe thin films, having been treated with CdCl2, were washed with distilled water to remove residual CdCl2 from their surfaces, followed by drying with blowing nitrogen gas. An aqueous solution of Cd(CH3COO)2 (Kanto, 98.0%), SC(NH2)2 (Kanto, 98.0%) and ammonia (Wako) at concentrations of 25 mM, 375 mM and 14 wt%, respectively, was used as the chemical bath. During the CBD process, the bath temperature was gradually increased from 20 to 65 °C over approximately 8 min. The resulting samples were subsequently annealed in air at 300 °C for one hour. Prior to PEC measurements, an approximately 2 nm-thick Pt layer was vacuum evaporated onto the sample surface as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction from water. This was accomplished by evaporating Pt wire (Nilaco, 99.98%) placed on a tungsten filament (Nilaco, LF-105W) by applying a current of 45 A at a chamber pressure of <4 × 10−3 Pa.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC properties of the CdTe thin film photoelectrodes were characterized using a PEC cell with a three-electrode configuration. Here, the specimen, Ag/AgCl in a saturated aqueous KCl solution, and a Pt wire connected to a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko, HSV-100) functioned as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Typically, a 1 M aqueous KH2PO4 solution adjusted to a pH of 8 by adding KOH was employed as the electrolyte, while a solar simulator (SAN-EI electronic, XES-40S2) was used as the light source. Each PEC measurement was performed under an Ar atmosphere, and the measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. The IPCE values were determined under monochromatic light from a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator (CT-10, JASCO). The photon flux of the monochromatic light was determined using a calibrated Si photodiode (S2281-01, Hamamatsu). The amounts of evolved H2 and O2 were evaluated in a batch system equipped with a micro gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent, 3000A).
2.4 Characterizations
Morphological and compositional characterizations were conducted simultaneously using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi, S-4700 and S-8200) in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Horiba, EMAX-7000 and Horiba, EX-370). The structural and optical properties of the CdTe thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Cu Kα line, and by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS; V-670, Jasco).
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Characterization of CdTe photocathodes
XRD patterns for CdTe thin films on FTO (CdTe/FTO), on Cu and Au-coated FTO (CdTe/Cu/Au), and of CdCl2-treated CdTe/Cu/Au (CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au) are shown in Fig. 1. The peaks in the CdTe/FTO pattern are assignable to CdTe and FTO, indicating that CdTe thin films were successfully formed on the FTO substrate by CSS. However, the sharp peak at 21.4° and broad peaks at 40–50° suggest the presence of an oxidized surface layer composed of TeOx and CdxTeOy and excess elemental Te, as shown in Fig. S1.†36,37 The XRD pattern for CdTe/Cu/Au is very similar to that for CdTe/FTO, except for the presence of peaks resulting from the underlying Au layer. No diffraction peaks due to Cu species are evident because of the negligible thickness of the Cu layer (6 nm) and the incorporation to the CdTe thin film.30,31 It should be noted that the temperature of 400 °C during CdTe deposition was sufficient for Cu atoms to diffuse into the CdTe film.30,31 The CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au specimen exhibits a significantly different pattern from that for CdTe/Cu/Au, with no diffraction peaks related to an oxidized surface layer or elemental Te. In addition to the removal of impurities, the crystal orientation of the CdTe film was changed by the CdCl2 treatment. The most prominent diffraction peaks in the CdTe/FTO and CdTe/Cu/Au patterns are assigned to CdTe(111), indicating that the CdTe thin films are (111) oriented. In contrast, the CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au pattern shows prominent diffraction peaks assignable to be CdTe(111) and (220), as has previously been reported in the case of a CdTe film deposited on a CdS template.34 This XRD analysis therefore demonstrated that the crystal orientation of the CdTe layer was transitioned from (111) to mixture of mainly (111) and (220) by the CdCl2 treatment. The enlarged XRD patterns obtained from CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au and CdTe/Cu/Au was shown in Fig. S7.†

UV-vis DRS spectra of the CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, CdTe/Cu/Au and CdTe/FTO are shown in Fig. 2. Each sample exhibits a typical absorption edge wavelength of 830 nm, indicating that neither the CdCl2 treatment nor the substrate affected the bandgap of the CdTe (UV-vis DRS spectra of the CdTe samples based on various substrate were shown in Fig. S2†).

Plan-view and cross-sectional SEM images of CdTe(CdCl2)/CdTe/Cu/Au, CdTe/Cu/Au and CdTe/FTO are presented in Fig. 3. CdTe/FTO is seen to be composed of columnar grains with diameters of several hundred nanometers (Fig. 3C and F), while CdTe/Cu/Au contains larger columnar grains as a result of the difference in the interfacial structure. Smaller grains are seen around the CdTe-FTO interface in CdTe/FTO but not at the CdTe–Cu/Au interface in CdTe/Cu/Au. To explain the improved structural properties of CdTe/Cu/Au, Fig. S3† presents SEM images of CdTe thin films deposited on Cu-coated FTO (CdTe/Cu/FTO) and Au-coated FTO (CdTe/Au). Both specimens show columnar grains larger than those in CdTe/FTO, with no small grains at the CdTe-substrate interfaces. One possible reason for the formation of small grains at the CdTe–FTO interface is the effect of the FTO substrate surface, since the FTO can provide seeds to promote the formation of CdTe crystallites, thus preventing a preferential (111) orientation.

However, the weak chemical bonding between the Au and CdTe inhibits the formation of these small grains. In addition, the diffusion of Cu into the CdTe layer serves to enhance the crystallization process, through lowering the melting point of the CdTe.38 The CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au sample is composed of large grains with diameters on the order of several micrometers.
The morphological changes seen in the cross-sectional SEM images upon adding CdCl2 are attributed to both a change in orientation and recrystallization. One noticeable difference between the plan-view SEM images of CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au and CdTe/Cu/Au is the presence of well-filled grain boundaries. It is important to note that the CdTe layer thicknesses in the CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, CdTe/Cu/Au and CdTe/FTO samples were 1.5, 1.8 and 2.0 μm, respectively. The thinner CdTe layer in the CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au is due to the evaporation of CdTe during the annealing. The lower intensity of the XRD peaks for CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au is also attributed to this thin CdTe layer.
3.2 PEC properties of CdTe photocathodes
As an initial step, the effects of adding a Cu layer on the PEC properties of the CdTe-based photocathode were examined. It has been reported that Cu can diffuse into the CdTe layer and increase the concentration of holes.30,31 The resulting lower electric resistivity of the semiconductor should reduce the thickness of the depletion layer. A thinner depletion layer is beneficial in the case of electrical contacts, although it is unfavourable with regard to charge separation at the solid–liquid interface. Thus, it is important to introduce an optimal thickness of Cu at the interface between the CdTe layer and the FTO substrate. Fig. 4 shows current–potential curves for Pt- and CdS-modified CdTe/FTO (Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO) and CdTe/Cu/FTO (Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/FTO) with Cu thicknesses of 3, 6, 12 and 24 nm. The Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/FTO photocathode with both 3 nm- and 6 nm-thick Cu layer generated an enhanced photocurrent, especially at relatively low potentials (comparing the values of −8.1 and −9.3 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE for Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/FTO without and with 6 nm thick Cu). Conversely, the photocurrent at relatively high potentials was reduced (−0.6 and −0.1 mA cm−2 at 0.5 VRHE). The enhanced photocurrent at 0 VRHE is believed to result from the increased concentration of holes, especially at the CdTe–FTO interface, because of the diffusion of Cu. The improved structural properties of the CdTe layer grown on a Cu-coated FTO substrate (as evident from the SEM observations) likely also contributed to the enhanced photocurrent. The reduced photocurrent at 0.5 VRHE is attributed to the greater concentration of holes in the bulk of the CdTe layer due to Cu diffusion.
 Fig. 4  Current–potential curves for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/FTO with Cu layer thickness of 3, 6, 12 and 24 nm under chopped simulated sunlight in a 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8. The applied potential was swept at +10 mV s−1. 
In the case of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/FTO photocathode with the 12 nm- and 24 nm-thick Cu layer, the cathodic photocurrent for all potentials was lower than that for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO as a result of the significant increase in the concentration of holes brought about by the diffusion of Cu.
To further enhance the photocurrent, a Au layer was inserted between the CdTe and the FTO. Because of the larger work function and the lower electric resistivity of Au, improved electric contact with the CdTe was anticipated. However, the work function of Au (5.1 eV) is still less than the ionization potential of CdTe (5.6 eV). As shown in Fig. 5, the cathodic photocurrent obtained from the Pt- and CdS-modified CdTe/Au (Pt/CdS/CdTe/Au) was lower at all potentials. This is primarily the result of the weak physical contact between the CdTe and the Au stemming from the lack of reactivity between these materials. To overcome the problems related to the physically weak contact and the unfavourable work function, Cu and Au-coated FTO was examined as a substrate. The 6 nm-thick Cu layer was expected to improve the adhesion between the CdTe and Au, in addition to thinning the Schottky barrier caused by the smaller work function of the Au relative to that of CdTe. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the Pt- and CdS-modified CdTe/Cu/Au (Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au) showed a greatly enhanced cathodic photocurrent of −14 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and −2.4 mA cm−2 at 0.5 VRHE.

The HC-STH for the Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au specimen was increased by a factor of more than three, to 2.8% at 0.3 VRHE, relative to the value reported for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO (0.9% at 0.25 VRHE) as shown in Fig. 6. As discussed above, it is apparent that the significantly increased HC-STH and cathodic photocurrent for the Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au result from both changes in the structural features of the CdTe thin film and enhanced charge transfer between the CdTe layer and the FTO substrate.
 Fig. 6  HC-STH values calculated from the current–potential curves for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au shown in Fig. 4 and 5. 
The introduction of the additional Cu and Au contact layers significantly enhanced PEC hydrogen evolution over these CdTe-based photocathodes. However, the XRD data showed that the crystallinity of the CdTe layer could be further improved, based on the observation of diffraction peaks originating from impurity phases. A Pt- and CdS-modified CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au (Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au) photocathode was therefore examined to assess the effects of CdCl2 treatment on the PEC properties. As shown in Fig. 5, the Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au photocathode generated a higher cathodic photocurrent of −22 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and −2.4 mA cm−2 at 0.5 VRHE. The value at 0 VRHE is not very far from the theoretical value of 29 mA cm−2. In addition, the HC-STH was also significantly enhanced, to 3.7% at 0.3 VRHE. These results indicate that CdCl2 treatment under optimized conditions is an effective means of improving the efficiency of CdTe-based photocathodes through improving the crystallinity of the CdTe layer.
The photocurrent under simulated sunlight was examined by measuring the IPCE of these devices. The IPCE spectra of Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathodes at 0 VRHE are presented in Fig. 7. The Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au photocathodes exhibit a much higher IPCE at all wavelengths than Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO. It should be noted that the decrease in IPCE at wavelengths below 540 nm results from light absorption by the CdS layer, as has been previous reported.12 The Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au photocathode showed a remarkably high IPCE of >95% at 560–660 nm and >90% at 560–740 nm. The expected photocurrents under AM 1.5G light based on these IPCE values are 23 and 15 mA cm−2 for the Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au photocathodes, respectively.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathodes at 0 VRHE in an electrolyte consisting of a 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8. 
These values are in good agreement with the photocurrent at 0 VRHE shown in Fig. 5. These exceptionally high and consistent IPCE demonstrate the capability of CdTe as a photocathode.
3.3 Durability and faradaic efficiency of a CdTe photocathode
The time course of the photocurrent generated by a Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au device at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight is plotted in Fig. 8. The oscillations evident in the photocurrent result from the evolution of numerous hydrogen bubbles in association with the high photocurrents. The Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au photocathode produced a relatively stable photocurrent during a measurement period of approximately 70 min. Just after the start of the PEC reaction, the photocurrent was −21 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the photocurrent observed in the current potential data in Fig. 5. It should be noted that the photocurrent increased immediately after the interruption of irradiation, indicating that it was partly limited by mass-transfer. Subsequently, the cathodic photocurrent gradually decreased over the course of the following hour, to approximately −19 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. S6,† the surface morphology of the photocathode was obviously changed after the durability test. We believe that the evident durability of these CdTe-based photocathodes could be highly advantageous, and demonstrates that these devices can be stabilized over long time spans through surface coating.8,9,19

To confirm the faradaic efficiency of the Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au photocathode, the amounts of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen evolved in the PEC cell during irradiation with simulated sunlight were determined using a micro gas chromatograph, as shown in Fig. 9. The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen were consistent with the expected values calculated from the photocurrent. This result indicates that the faradaic efficiency during the hydrogen evolution process was almost 100%. In addition, the molar ratio of gaseous hydrogen to oxygen agreed with the expected stoichiometric value of 2:1.

The expected amounts of hydrogen and oxygen (denoted as e−/2 and e−/4, respectively) as calculated from the observed photocurrent are shown as dashed lines. A 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8 was used as the electrolyte. 
4. Conclusion
In the present study, the effects of a back contact and annealing in the presence of CdCl2 on the PEC properties of CdTe-based photocathodes were investigated. Employing Cu and/or Au-coated FTO substrates had a pronounced effect on the CdTe grain morphology, because of the unique characteristics of the various interfaces as well as Cu diffusion into the CdTe. Treatment of the CdTe film with CdCl2 was found to be an effective means of removing deleterious impurities.
PEC measurements revealed that Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au showed an HC-STH three times that of Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO. This enhancement was ascribed to improved structural properties and better charge transfer between the CdTe and substrate resulting from a reduced Schottky barrier and the relatively large work function of Au. CdCl2 treatment further enhanced the hydrogen evolution from water when using a CdTe-based photocathode. The Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au showed a relatively large photocurrent of −22 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight. Its HC-STH and IPCE values were 3.7% at 0.3 VRHE and >95% at 560–660 nm with an applied potential of 0 VRHE, respectively. A Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au photocathode produced a stable photocurrent for 70 min and exhibited hydrogen evolution with a faradaic efficiency close to 100%.
It can be concluded that CdTe is a promising candidate material for photocathodes intended for hydrogen evolution from water utilizing sunlight. Future challenges include further stabilization of this material and enhancement of the photocurrent at higher potentials through additional surface modifications, such as by coating with more stable substances.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  XRD patterns obtained from CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, CdTe/Cu/Au and CdTe/FTO, and from a bare FTO substrate, as well as the reference pattern for CdTe.	 

 	Fig. 2  UV-vis DRS spectra obtained from CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, CdTe/Cu/Au and CdTe/FTO. The steps at 840 nm are the result of grating switching.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A–C) Plan-view and (D–F) cross-sectional SEM images of CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, CdTe/Cu/Au and CdTe/FTO.	 

 	Fig. 4  Current–potential curves for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/FTO with Cu layer thickness of 3, 6, 12 and 24 nm under chopped simulated sunlight in a 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8. The applied potential was swept at +10 mV s−1.	 

 	Fig. 5  Current–potential curves for Pt/CdS/CdTe/Au, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au under chopped simulated sunlight in a 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8. The applied potential was swept at +10 mV s−1.	 

 	Fig. 6  HC-STH values calculated from the current–potential curves for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au shown in Fig. 4 and 5.	 

 	Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au, Pt/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au and Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathodes at 0 VRHE in an electrolyte consisting of a 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8.	 

 	Fig. 8  Time course of the photocurrent generated by Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight in a 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8.	 

 	Fig. 9  Hydrogen and oxygen evolution from a Pt/CdS/CdTe(CdCl2)/Cu/Au photocathode and counter electrode under simulated sunlight in a three-electrode configuration with an applied potential of 0 VRHE. The expected amounts of hydrogen and oxygen (denoted as e−/2 and e−/4, respectively) as calculated from the observed photocurrent are shown as dashed lines. A 1 M aqueous KPi solution with pH adjusted to 8 was used as the electrolyte.
