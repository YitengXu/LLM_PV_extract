    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 26th June 2017AbstractWe report a simple and novel method involving an ethyl methyl imidazolium triflate ionic liquid (EMI OTf) to prepare highly mechanically stable crystalline α-Mn2O3 and calcium-incorporated manganese oxide (CaMn-oxide) thin film water oxidation electrocatalysts (WOCs) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode (FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide). Electrochemical measurements showed that the incorporation of calcium into manganese oxide promotes water oxidation at a very low energy cost, similar to that observed in natural photosystem II (PSII). The low energy cost is due to the involvement of the MnIVO species in the catalysis as compared to the MnVO species that has been previously detected in calcium-free α-Mn2O3. Moreover, the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst showed unprecedentedly high activity (TOF ≈ 29.8 s−1 at η = 0.57 V) and robustness (tested for 40 h) for water oxidation in a neutral potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.0). The mechanism of water oxidation by FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide was discussed and applied for water oxidation by the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 cluster of photosystem II (PS II).
Solar driven hydrogen production from water is a promising approach to address the issues of fossil fuel depletion and global warming.1–3 The challenging step in this production is the oxidation of water (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−), where the 4e− transfer is an energetically uphill process with slow kinetics and large overpotentials (η).4,5 Thus, developing inexpensive water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) to hasten the kinetics and reduce the η of water oxidation is a key factor for the fabrication of efficient hydrogen production systems.6 Several promising WOCs containing earth-abundant Co,2 Ni,7,8 Cu,9–11 and Fe12–14 have been developed. The most efficient catalytic water oxidation, however, is achieved by the μ-oxido CaMn-oxide cluster (CaMn4O5) housed in an enzyme called photosystem II (PSII) in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria; this system achieves water oxidation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 100 to 400 s−1.15–18 Consequently, particular attention has been paid to Mn-oxides as bio-mimic, earth-abundant, and eco-friendly WOCs.19–21 Indeed, various Mn-oxides, including α-Mn2O3,22,23 Mn3O4,21 λ-MnO2,23,24 β-MnO2,25–27 R-MnO2,23 α-MnO2,28 and γ-MnO2,29 have been reported as WOCs.
In 2010, Kurz and coworkers investigated the water oxidation activity of dispersed powders of α-Mn2O3, crystalline marokite (CaMn2O4) and amorphous CaMn-oxides (CaMn2O4·xH2O, x = 1.4) with both chemical (H2O2, HSO5−, CeIV) and photochemical ([RuII(bpy)3]2+/[CoIII(NH3)5Cl]2+, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) oxidants.30 The study showed that α-Mn2O3 and marokite (CaMn2O4) have very similar low water oxidation activities; however, amorphous CaMn-oxide (CaMn2O4·H2O) showed ≈20 and 15 times higher activity than α-Mn2O3 with CeIV and photochemical oxidants, respectively.30 The study was very interesting not only because it introduced the first closest structural and functional analogues to the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 cluster of PSII but also because it demonstrated the development of potential earth-abundant eco-friendly WOCs. 18O-enriched H2O studies showed true water oxidation with non-oxygen-transferring CeIV and photochemical oxidants.31 Extended-range X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the K-edges of Mn and Ca showed that the amorphous CaMn2O4·xH2O WOCs contain MnIV (≈80%) and MnIII (≈20%) cations and have less ordered layered Mn oxide structures.32 Subsequent studies showed that the amorphous CaMn-oxides adopted birnessite structures with Mn-oxides assembled in layers of edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra with Ca ions located between the layers.33–47
Although using CaMn-oxides as dispersed powder WOCs in the presence of chemical or photochemical oxidants is of great interest, their immobilization on conducting electrodes such as FTO and their use as anodes in electrochemical water splitting devices is important to their practical applications. However, few studies on the immobilization of these compounds have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, there are a few reports in the literature where CaMn-oxides were immobilized by dip-coating,48,49 screen-printing,48,49 ion-beam-sputtering,50 or Nafion®-assisted techniques.51 In the first report by Ramírez et al.,48 a CaMn-oxide (Ca2Mn3O8) film was supported on FTO/quartz or quartz substrates by either dip-coating (≈100 nm thickness) or screen-printing (6 μm) and tested for the water oxidation reaction in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7.0) and 1.0 M tris(hydroxymethyl)amino-methane (pH 7.8). The dip-coated films displayed lower current densities (≈0.5 mA cm−2 at 2.0 V in CV conducted with a 50 mV s−1 scan rate at pH 7.0) than the screen-printed films (≈2.5 mA cm−2 at 2.0 V). However, the robustness of the film was not tested, and the TOF values were not reported. In the second report, Lee et al. coated micrometer-thick layers of pre-synthesized CaMn-oxide pastes (Ca-birnessite, K0.20Ca0.21MnO2.21·1.4H2O) on FTO surfaces by spray painting and screen-printing methods. The best optimized screen-printed electro-catalyst promoted water oxidation with 1 mA cm−2 at η less than 0.5 V in neutral phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The performance of this electrode is better than that of Mn-oxides such as α-Mn2O3 and MnO2. The Nafion®-assisted CaMn-oxides were immobilized on glassy carbon electrode and tested in basic KOH solutions.51
We previously optimized an electrochemical/sintering route for the preparation of a highly active and robust FTO/α-Mn2O3 WOC and studied its kinetics and mechanism for water oxidation.52,53 However, all our attempts and those of others to use electrochemical deposition routes for the preparation of Ca-incorporated Mn-oxides have been unsuccessful.49 Here, we report a simple novel route for the preparation of highly mechanically stable thin films of EMI OTf-supported α-Mn2O3 and CaMn-oxide WOCs on an FTO electrode surface (FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide). Careful investigations of the two electro-catalysts showed enhancement of their water oxidation activities by incorporation of Ca into the Mn-oxide. Moreover, the involvement of Ca promotes water oxidation at the MnIV oxidation state. The MnIV species is easily accessible at a low energy cost compared with the MnV active species that is required for catalysis in the absence of Ca. This indicates the role of Ca in the Ca incorporated Mn-oxides. A mechanism for water oxidation by FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide was proposed and discussed along with that reported for water oxidation by the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 cluster of photosystem II (PS II).
The FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalysts were prepared by spreading MnCl2·4H2O (1.0 g, 5.05 mmol) or a mixed solution of MnCl2·4H2O (1.0 g, 5.05 mmol) and CaCl2 (0.56 g, 5.05 mmol) in MeOH (4.0 mL) containing 20% v/v EMI OTf ionic liquid (1.0 mL) on the FTO surface using a doctor blade at 110 °C, respectively. The FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide precursors were then sintered at 550 °C for 1 h. The resulting films were washed extensively under flowing water, resulting in highly mechanically strong films that were not removed by hard scratching or long sonication times; this indicates the good adhesion properties of the films due to strong binding between the particles as well as between the particles and the conducting FTO surface. Details of the preparation are given in the ESI.† When the EMI OTf ionic liquid was not present in the solution, the resulting films were fragile and detached easily from the FTO surface, indicating the importance of the EMI OTf ionic liquid in the current preparation route. Indeed, we also recently reported the utilization of EMI OTf ionic liquid for the preparation of a highly mechanically stable thin film of BiVO4 water oxidation photoanode on FTO electrode.54

Fig. 1 shows the actual and top view SEM images of the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalysts. The dark brown thin film of EMI α-Mn2O3 consists of spherical nanoparticles with dimensions in the range of ≈20 to 500 nm and some aggregated particles. The particles of the black EMI CaMn-oxide thin film, on the other hand, are well defined and larger (100 to 500 nm), indicating the influence of the incorporated Ca in the morphology of the CaMn-oxide film. The particles of both films are compacted, with small vacancies between them; this indicates the role of the EMI OTf ionic liquid for the formation of strong adherence between the particles as well as between the particles and the FTO surface.54

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, F 1s, S 2p, Ca 2p, Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 3s of FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (blue lines), FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide (red lines), and the FTO blank (black lines; the C 1s peak at 285.5 eV of FTO is due to pump oil contamination). The spectra show the presence of C, N, and S from the EMI OTf precursor in both the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide films. Moreover, F is present in the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide film. The presence of F in FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide is most likely due to the presence of Ca bearing Ca–F bonds. Similarly, the presence of EMI OTf components was detected in our recently reported EMI OTf-supported BiVO4 photoanode.54 The spectra also clearly demonstrate the presence of Ca in the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide film. The atomic composition ratios determined from the areas of the XPS of the elements present in the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide films are presented in Table S1, ESI.† Focusing on the Ca:Mn atomic ratio in FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide, the XPS results showed the presence of a 0.89:1.0 ratio of Ca:Mn although the precursor solution contained a unit molar ratio of Ca:Mn. The presence of the EMI OTf elements in the resulting films indicates their importance in the strong adhesion between the film particles and between the film and the FTO surface.54

The deconvolution of the XPS lines is shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† and the corresponding binding energies are summarized in Table S2.† Based on previous reports,52 the deconvoluted Mn 2p3/2 peaks at 640.98 and 642.64 eV for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and at 640.56, 641.83, and 643.73 eV for FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide are probably due to the presence of the MnII and MnIII oxidation states in the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 film and the MnII, MnIII, and MnIV oxidation states in the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide film, respectively. The O 1s deconvoluted spectra (Fig. S1 and S2, Table S2†) reveal the presence of Mn–O–Mn binding at 529.57 and 529.52 eV in both films. The Mn–OH peak is observed at 530.97 and 531.59 eV and the H–O–H peak is observed at 532.83 eV in both films. An O 1s deconvoluted peak observed in the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide film at 533.71 was tentatively attributed to Ca–OH or Ca–OH2. The deconvoluted Ca 2p lines show a main peak at 349.31 and a small peak at 345.75 for Ca 2p3/2 and a peak at 353.19 eV and a small peak at 352.07 eV for Ca 2p1/2 (Table S2, Fig. S2†), indicating the presence of two species of Ca in the catalyst.55–57.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the FTO blank, FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3, and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide. The XRD patterns of FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 consist of a highly crystalline form of α-Mn2O3 with the diffraction peaks of the FTO blank electrode.53 The XRD patterns of FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide show the patterns of the FTO electrode and a new diffraction pattern not reported previously. We tentatively attributed these new patterns to a CaMn-oxide containing a certain ratio of Ca:Mn (the current film ratio is 0.89:1.0 as obtained from XPS measurements).

Fig. 4a depicts linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) at a 5 mV s−1 scan rate of the FTO blank (black dotted line), FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (blue line), and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide (red line) in 0.1 M KPi buffer solution (pH 7.0). Compared to the FTO blank, FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 showed two successive oxidation peaks at Ep1 = 0.76 V and Ep2 = 1.14 V vs. NHE (hereafter, all potentials are referred to NHE); these were assigned, as previously reported by us and others,52,53,58,59 to the MnII/III and MnIII/IV oxidation states, respectively. Then, a strong water oxidation catalytic current started at 1.2 V and reached 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V. FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide, on the other hand, showed the MnII/III oxidation peak at a less positive potential of 0.67 V compared to that observed for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (0.76 V). The most interesting finding is the observation of a clear catalytic current peak concomitant with O2 evolution that starts at an applied potential Eapp. = 0.95 V, and reaches 0.48 mA cm−2 at Eapp. = 1.19 V. This observed catalytic current peak is ≈28.7 times that of the MnII/III oxidation peak current, indicating its catalytic nature. The observation of this catalytic peak over the MnIII/IV oxidation peak observed in FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 indicates the involvement of MnIV in this catalytic peak (Fig. 4a: inset). This finding clearly indicates that the presence of Ca in FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide promotes water oxidation at very low η due to the involvement of MnIV in the catalytic process. Application of a more positive potential resulted in the generation of a stronger catalytic current for water oxidation that started at 1.2 V and reached 12.1 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V. The observed current density at 1.7 V (12.1 mA cm−2) is ≈9.3 times higher than that observed for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (1.3 mA cm−2).

To investigate the correspondence of the catalytic peak current observed for the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst over MnIII/IV oxidation to water oxidation and O2 evolution, controlled potential electrolysis tests were conducted for 7 h at applied potentials of 0.9 (η = 0.08 V), 1.0 (η = 0.18 V), and 1.1 V (η = 0.28 V) in an air-tight cell filled with degassed 0.1 M KPi solution (pH 7.0). Fig. 4b shows the current density–time profiles at the three applied potentials. At an applied potential of 0.9 V (η = 0.08 V), a very low, gradually decreasing current density was obtained with no O2 gas detected in the headspace of the cell. Increasing the applied potential to 1.0 V (η = 0.18 V) resulted in a constant current density of ≈50 μA cm−2 with O2 evolution at 90% faradaic efficiency. The current density increased to a constant value of 0.30 mA cm−2 with O2 evolution at 97% faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of 1.1 V (η = 0.28 V). At the same applied potentials, neither current density nor O2 were obtained with the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 electro-catalyst under the same conditions, indicating the vital role of Ca in the water oxidation activity of the current FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first clear demonstration of the role of Ca in the Ca-incorporated Mn-oxides. Consistent with our finding, nano-sized CaMn-oxide encapsulated in an engineered polypeptide and supported on FTO electrode with a Nafion solution was reported to oxidize water at low η (0.24 V) in the MnIII/IV oxidation range.58,59
The performances of the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalysts for water oxidation were compared by conducting a 10 h bulk electrolysis experiment at 1.39 V (η = 0.57 V) in 0.1 M KPi solution (Fig. 4c). The FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst generated a higher constant current density of 2.6 mA cm−2 than that obtained from FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (1.0 mA cm−2) over 10 h of electrolysis. Gas chromatography analysis of the headspace gases showed the production of O2 gas at almost 100% faradaic efficiency (Fig. 4d). These electrolysis results clearly indicate the effects of Ca incorporation in the enhancement of the water oxidation activity of the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst. Moreover, the steady current density over 10 h of electrolysis indicates the robustness of the current FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalysts for water oxidation due to their high mechanical stability, which was achieved by using EMI OTf ionic liquid.
For all reported CaMn-oxide WOCs, oxygen evolution rates using either chemical (CeIV) or photochemical ([Ru(bpy)3]2+) oxidants decrease gradually within a short reaction time (30 min), due either to the gradual dissolution of Ca in the acid CeIV solution or the decomposition of [Ru(bpy)3]2+.41 The robustness of the current FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst was obvious from the constant current density recorded during electrolysis for 10 h (Fig. 4d) or even for 40 h (Fig. S3†). Moreover, comparison of the XPS (Fig. S4a†) and XRD (Fig. S4b†) results of the catalyst before and after electrolysis revealed that no observable changes occurred by electrolysis, particularly for the Ca and Mn content. FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 also showed high robustness (Fig. 4c and S4c†).
In 1 M NaOH solution, the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst showed a higher water oxidation current density of 21 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V than that observed in neutral KPi solution in LSV conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. S5†). After 10 h of electrolysis at a constant potential (1.0 V, η = 0.57 V), the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst generated a current density of ≈8 mA cm−2; however, this gradually decreased to ≈6 mA cm−2 after 10 h of electrolysis (Fig. S5,† inset).
The amount of the active surface Mn, Γ, of the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst was estimated to be 2.3 × 10−10 mol cm−2 (Fig. S6†) using the variation of the peak current of the MnII/III couple at 0.67 V with the scan rates, ν, according to the equation ip = n2ΓF2ν/4RT, where ip is the peak current of MnII/III oxidation, ν is the scan rate, and F, R, and T are the Faraday constant, gas constant, and absolute temperature (298 K), respectively.60 Using Γ = 2.3 × 10−10 mol cm−2 and the amount of O2 evolved during the bulk electrolysis, the TOF values of the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst were estimated to be ≈3.4 and 29.8 s−1 at η = 0.28 V and 0.57 V, respectively.
To evaluate the kinetics of charge transfer and characterize the electrochemical interfacial reactions of FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide for water oxidation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at different applied potentials. Fig. 5a shows Nyquist plots for the two electro-catalysts in 0.1 M KPi at 1.39 V in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent Randle circuit, as displayed in the inset, where Rs is the solution resistance, CPE is the constant phase element of the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the plot, the symbols indicate the experimental results and the lines represent fitting results obtained using the equivalent circuit. The EIS data were measured using a three-electrode cell system; thus, the arc in the Nyquist plot is related to the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. By fitting the observed results by simulation, the Rct values for FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide and FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 were found to be 71.4 and 368.3 Ω cm−2, respectively. This indicates that the charge transfer rate from FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide to water was increased by the incorporation of Ca in the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst. Fig. 5b depicts the Nyquist plots of FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide at different applied potentials. As indicated in the figure, Rct is decreased by increasing the applied potentials, which is consistent with the increasing charge transfer rate from FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide to water. Table S3† summarizes the simulated Rct, Rs, and CPE values for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide at different applied potentials. The Rct values are lower for FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide than for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 at all applied potentials, which is consistent with the observation of water oxidation only with FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide at low applied potentials and the enhancement of its activity compared to FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3.

(b) Nyquist plots of FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide at different applied potentials under the same conditions as in (a). Inset: magnified Nyquist plot. 
Fig. S7† depicts Tafel plots and the corresponding Tafel slope values (without iR correction) for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide. The slopes obtained for FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide are lower than those obtained for the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3, which is consistent with its high activity. Moreover, the variations in the Tafel slopes indicate a possible change in the water oxidation mechanism (see later).61 The report of Ca2Mn3O8 showed Tafel slopes of 223 and 370 mV per decade for the samples prepared by screen-printing and dip-coating, respectively.48
The water oxidation catalytic performance of the current FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide in terms of efficiency (work at low η), current density (0.3 mA cm−2 at η = 0.28 V and 2.6 mA cm−2 at η = 0.57 V), TOF (3.4 s−1 at η = 0.28 V and 29.8 s−1 at η = 0.57 V), and robustness is highly comparable to previous reports of catalysts supported on electrodes and based on earth abundant elements. A reported FTO/α-Mn2O3 electro-catalyst prepared by an electrodeposition/sintering route showed a water oxidation current density of 1 mA cm−2 at η = 470 mV in 0.1 M KPi; however, the current degraded to 0.5 mA cm−2 within 1 h of electrolysis.62 An optimized FTO/α-Mn2O3 electro-catalyst showed a constant current density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at η = 470 mV in 0.1 M KPi with a TOF of 2.1 s−1 (based on the amount of surface active Mn).53 A recently reported Mn porphyrin dimer immobilized on the surface of an ITO electrode via a phosphonic acid linker exhibited a TOF of up to 45 s−1 at η = 0.47 V in neutral borate buffer solution (pH 7.0) with a current density of 0.13 mA cm−2.63 An Fe-based catalyst supported on FTO or ITO electrodes showed a current density of ≈1 mA cm−2 at η = 530 mV with TOF = 0.21 s−1.14 FTO/CoPi that was deposited in situ from a CoII-containing KPi solution reported by Nocera showed an increasing current density that reached ≈1 mA cm−2 after 8 h of electrolysis at η = 470 mV with TOF = 5.2 × 10−4 s−1.64 The FTO/K0.20Ca0.21MnO2.21·1.4H2O electro-catalyst prepared by screen-printing promoted water oxidation with 1 mA cm−2 at η less than 0.5 V in a neutral KPi solution (pH 7.0).49 The benchmark RuO2 and IrO2 water oxidation catalysts electrodeposited on ITO electrodes showed current densities of 7.2 and 5 mA cm−2, respectively, at η = 770 mV in borate buffer solution (pH = 9.2).65
In photosynthesis, water oxidation occurs on the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 cluster of PS II. High resolution X-ray crystallographic studies showed that three Mn and one Ca of the cluster form a distorted μ-oxido CaMn3O4 cubane motif, and a fourth dangler Mn binds to the cubane via two bridging μ-oxido ligands. Four water molecules are coordinated to the dangler MnIII and CaII ions.15,16,66,67 A schematic of the structure of the cluster is shown in the yellow centre of Scheme 1. Although numerous hypotheses on the mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation by the cluster have been proposed,68–70 the results indicate that the cluster stores the oxidizing equivalents of the absorbed light in the form of MnIII/IV oxidations through five intermediate S-states (S0–S4) (Scheme 1, centre green image).70 The absorbed light is converted to an oxidizing equivalent in the form of the chlorophyll P680+/P680 couple with a power of ≈1.10 V. The P680+/P680 oxidizing power is then transferred to the cluster to achieve stepwise oxidations (Si/Si+1, i = 0–3) through a redox-active tyrosine residue, YZ+/YZ, with a redox power ≈0.95 to 0.99 V. The S0/S1, S1/S2 and S2/S3 oxidation potentials were estimated to be 0.68 to 0.72 V, 0.90 to 0.95 V, and 0.90 to 0.95 V, respectively.71,72

Previous mechanistic and kinetic studies of water oxidation by FTO/α-Mn2O3 showed that the Mn active site of the catalyst undergoes two stepwise proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidations (MnII–OH2/MnIII–OH at 0.62 V and MnIII–OH/MnIVO at 1.17 V) followed by an electron transfer oxidation (MnIVO/MnVO at more than 1.4 V) to generate the MnVO active species. Finally, the MnVO active species undergoes a rate-limiting electrophilic attack on H2O/OH to release O2.52 A careful comparison of the electrochemical properties of the FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 and FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalysts allowed us to propose a mechanism of water oxidation by FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide, as shown in Scheme 1. Previous studies indicated that CaMn-oxides have similar structural motifs to the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 clusters of PS II.41 The Mn adopts an MnO6 octahedral geometry with a surface-bound water molecule. The Ca at the surface has a six-coordinated structure with surface-bound water molecules.47 In the current proposed mechanism, species 1 represents MnII–OH2 and Ca–OH2 at the active site of the catalyst (see XPS results). The MnII–OH2 active site undergoes a PCET oxidation at Ep1 = 0.67 V to form MnIII–OH (species 2). The presence of Ca enables easier oxidation of the Mn site in FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide than that observed for FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (Ep1 = 0.76 V) (Fig. 4a). Indeed, Ca has been reported to stabilize and facilitate high oxidation states of Mn.21,73 Moreover, redox inactive metal ions with Lewis acid properties, such as Ca2+, are known to have major influences on redox-active transition metal complexes to promote a variety of reactions involving the transfer of electrons.74
Upon further oxidation, a catalytic current peak concomitant with O2 evolution started at Eapp. = 0.95 V. Studies on the pH dependence of the onset potential of the peak potential values of this catalytic water oxidation over the pH range of 5.0 to 10.0 reveal that its onset potentials shift reductively by approximately 59 mV per pH decade (Fig. S8†), suggesting stepwise proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidations of the active site MnIII–OH to MnIVO. It is interesting that the redox potential, 0.90–0.95 V, for S1/S2 and S2/S3 of the OEC cluster that involves MnIII/IV oxidation is similar to the redox potential for the MnIII/IV oxidation of the current system. A very close structure model of the cluster {[CaMn4O4(tBuCO2)8 (tBuCO2H)2(py)] (tBu = tert-butyl; py = pyridine)} showed MnIII2 MnIV2/MnIII MnIV3 oxidation at a slightly lower potential of 0.8 V.75 The observation of the catalytic current peak over the MnIII–OH/MnIVO oxidation of FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 (Ep2 = 1.14 V) clearly indicates that MnIVO is the active species involved in the catalysis process (species 3). Moreover, the observation of this catalytic current only for FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide and its absence in FTO/EMI α-Mn2O3 indicates the crucial role of Ca in this catalytic peak current. We propose that H2O bound to Ca undergoes electrophilic attack of the oxygen of the terminal MnIVO species to form the O–O bond of the evolved O2 (species 5 and 7). In natural photosynthesis, Ca has been proposed to play structural and functional roles in the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 cluster of PS II.76,77 It is proposed to play a role as a weak Lewis acid, where H2O/OH bound to Ca forms the O–O bond of the evolved O2 by nucleophilic attack, however, to oxygen of a terminal MnVO or MnIVO species in the final state of the water oxidation reaction.68,78–82 Moreover, the presence of a peroxide bridge between Ca and Mn in the μ-oxido-CaMn4O5 cluster of PS II was recently reported.67 The current results, however, showed that the generation of MnVO species requires a high potential (>1.4 V) that is greater than the oxidizing power of P680+/P680 (1.1 V) of PS II. Indeed, reported density functional theory calculations on Ca birnessite demonstrated that MnIII/IV oxidation occurs before O–O bond formation and OH− bound to Ca2+ is involved in the O–O bond formation through electrophilic attack, however, by the μ-oxo bridges between Mn centers.47
Applying a more positive potential to FTO/CaMn-oxide resulted in the formation of a MnVO active site (species 4) that undergoes nucleophilic attack by an outer sphere H2O (as observed with FTO/α-Mn2O3)52 or H2O bound to either Ca (species 6 and 7), an adjacent Mn site, or a combination of them. A direct attack of an outer sphere H2O on a terminal oxido ligand bound to Mn is also proposed in PS II.83 The different Tafel slopes observed for the current FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide and FTO/α-Mn2O3 (Fig. S7†) is consistent with different water oxidation mechanisms by the two electrocatalysts.61
Our current results demonstrate that the MnIVO active species can be accessible with low oxidizing power, similar to that of PS II, and this species is active only for water oxidation in the presence of Ca. The MnVO active species requires a high oxidizing power, greater than that of PSII, and is only accessible in model compounds with high potentials obtained either electrochemically or by powerful oxidants. We are currently investigating the proposed mechanism in more detail.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report a novel method involving EMI OTF ionic liquid for the preparation of highly mechanically stable thin films of α-Mn2O3 and CaMn-oxide water oxidation electro-catalysts on FTO electrode. Both electro-catalysts showed high water oxidation activity and stability in neutral KPi buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.0). The incorporation of Ca remarkably enhances the water oxidation activity of the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst. Moreover, the presence of Ca promotes water oxidation at the MnIVO active species, which is accessible at a low energy cost. A mechanism of water oxidation by the CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst was proposed and discussed in context with that of PS II.
