    First published on 27th April 2020AbstractThe pursuit of efficient light sources has stimulated continued effort in the search of materials and methods for generating white light emission. In addition to the white light produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescent lamps that involves spectral conversion of high energy to low energy emission, recent studies showed that it was also possible to produce white visible light by irradiating different active materials with near-infrared (NIR) constant-wave (CW) lasers. In this review, we begin by introducing and categorizing different materials that exhibit NIR laser driven white light emission, including normal inorganic phosphors, organometallic compounds, graphene, etc. We then discuss the photophysical behavior of this process in terms of optical spectra, temperature evolution and photoelectric response. Different mechanisms of while light generation are analyzed afterwards, and the possibility of a more general physical picture of this process is discussed. This review is concluded with a summary of the current understanding and discussion on potential applications and future perspectives.

1. Introduction
Human civilization has witnessed tremendous advances in the materials and methods for generating white light (WL) in the last century.1–11 For thousands of years, artificial lighting relied on the combustion of chemicals until the invention of incandescent lamps by Edison in 1879, which has been regarded as the first generation of artificial lighting. In the more efficient second and third generation of artificial lighting, i.e., fluorescent lamps and white LEDs, different inorganic phosphors are employed for the conversion of short wavelength emission to visible light,12–17 which is a typical Stokes process in which the rest of optical energy is converted to phonon emission.
Photoluminescence by an anti-Stokes process (also known as upconversion) upon near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation has been widely observed in different optically active materials, including rare-earth (RE) and transition metal (TM) doped phosphors, quantum dots (QD) and organic dye solutions18–27 This is apparently different from the parametric process observed in nonlinear crystals, but still can be generally understood by a nonlinear optical (NLO) process where simultaneous (or sequential) absorption of two or multiple photons is involved.28 In comparison, for many upconversion phosphors activated with RE ions, it is surprising that an increase of pumping density leads to the steady evolution of the spectrum from discrete emission patterns to broadband white light extending into the infrared (IR) spectral range.29–31 A recent study shows that the quantum efficiency of this constant-wave (CW) laser driven WL emission in an inorganic phosphor can be up to 16%,32 thus stimulating wide interest in the investigation of the involved mechanisms and exploration for more efficient materials.33–37 This process has often been interpreted in terms of laser induced incandescence in which the spectra can be sometimes described by Planck's law on black body radiation. Similar NIR laser driven WL emission has been observed with similar spectral characteristics in otherwise non-luminescent materials like carbon and many undoped oxides,38–41 and many material-dependent interpretations have been proposed for this process, strongly obscuring the current understanding of the physical mechanisms.
The purpose of this review is to bring together all the materials that show the broadband WL generation driven by CW NIR lasers. Admittedly, the WL generation process is obviously different from the supercontinuum WL generation upon excitation with ultrafast laser pulses, which characterizes a dramatic spectral broadening of the pump pulses and is generally interpreted in terms of NLO processes including self-phase modulation.42–46 The “white-light” is not necessarily associated with a spectral continuum; it only reflects the colour of emitted light from an object that is observable by naked eyes. Pulsed laser induced super-continuum generation, which has been thoroughly discussed previously,47–50 is not included in this review. Here, we first summarize and categorize the materials that exhibit NIR laser driven broadband WL emission. The photophysical behaviours, including optical spectra, temperature evolution and photoelectric response, are then discussed and compared for different material systems. In the following sections, we give an overview of the various material-dependent mechanisms and discuss the potential applications of this process. We believe that a deeper understanding of the physical process of this phenomenon may enable better control of the process of laser driven WL generation and accelerate the search for more efficient systems for practical applications.
2. Materials for NIR CW laser driven WL emission
The NIR CW laser driven WL emission (see Fig. 1) is usually generated at high excitation densities (>200 W cm−2, but much smaller than that needed for a parametric process) and the optical spectra are characterized by a continuum extending to the infrared spectral region. Therefore, it is clearly different from the normal upconversion process, in which the emission bands can be ascribed to discrete transitions of activators. However, the WL emission can usually be produced by typical upconversion phosphors by raising the NIR laser pumping density above a threshold value when characteristic emission lines of, e.g. RE ions, are steadily replaced by a broad continuum. The generation of WL emission in RE-doped oxides by intense NIR laser irradiation was first reported by Wang et al.31 in 2010. In the following years, a similar photophysical process with almost the same spectral characteristics was demonstrated in a variety of inorganic phosphors activated with different RE and TM ions. On the other hand, this laser induced WL emission has also been observed in otherwise non-luminescent materials, such as amorphous silicon powders.51–54 In general, the laser energy must be absorbed by the material so as to produce a thermal effect and thus this process is usually considered to have a thermal origin, while the detailed mechanisms seem to be material-dependent and a non-thermal effect seems to be dominating in certain materials as the power-dependence of WL intensity is clearly nonlinear (see Section 4).

Up to the present, the broadband WL generation has been observed in different organic and inorganic materials. According to their composition, these materials can be divided into three types: (1) inorganic materials, (2) hybrid nanostructures, and (3) other NIR absorbing materials, including graphene, organometallic clusters and RE complexes.30,55–58
2.1 Inorganic materials

2.1.1 Phosphors activated with RE/TM ions. 
Inorganic phosphors activated with RE or TM ions have been widely studied for the generation of thermal WL emission under NIR laser excitation. For typical phosphors, RE or TM ions generally serve as the low concentration dopants in the matrix, while higher concentration is favoured for WL emission due to the stronger absorption. These inorganic phosphors can be further divided into micro/nano-sized powders and bulk ceramics, according to their morphology and size.
The most widely studied inorganic systems with NIR laser induced broadband WL emission are oxide phosphors, due to their high chemical and thermal stability. As shown in Table 1, oxide hosts doped with RE and TM ions for WL emission include binary metal oxides,32,57,59–61 aluminate,58,62–64 silicate,34,65–72 vanadate,73–76 and other complicated oxides (such as Sr2CeO4 and Y4Zr3O12).33,39,77–80 WL emission has also been observed in several oxide systems containing RE/TM ions in stoichiometric concentrations,30,31,56,60,61,64,81–84 such as neodymium aluminium perovskite (NdAP),85 Yb3Al5O1260 and some TM compounds.86 These oxide systems are chemically, photothermally, and photochemically stable, and all exhibit strong WL emission under NIR laser irradiation. From these reports, it is clear that the WL emission upon intense NIR pumping is not specific to any oxide matrix; it can rather be regarded as a general process as long as the NIR pumping laser can be efficiently absorbed.

Since the emission intensity depends largely on the absorption of the phosphor to effectively capture the NIR laser energy, it is necessary to select the absorber ion with its absorption band in resonance with the laser wavelength. The absorber ions include RE ions (i.e. Yb3+, Nd3+, Er3+, Tm3+, Pr4+, Tb4+, etc.)29,40,78,84,87–90 and TM ions (i.e. Cu2+, Cr3+)86, whose absorption band strongly resonates with the laser wavelength (e.g., the 980 nm laser diode (LD), which is the most popular pumping source and commercial larger power units). Among RE ions, Yb3+ shows the largest absorption cross section at 980 nm by its 2F5/2 to 2F7/2 transition which matches the operating wavelength of a popular commercial laser diode and it has been shown to be the most effective activator.91,92 Other RE ions, such as Er3+, also exhibit a relatively weak absorption band close to 980 nm and the generation of WL is also possible in Er3+ doped materials.82,83 Comparatively, the 808 nm LD is a less popular pumping source which is often used for pumping Nd3+ or Tm3+ doped materials. 808 nm excited WL emission has also been demonstrated in many materials. Unlike RE ions, the absorption of TM ions exhibits a typical broad bandwidth and a large absorption cross section compared to that of RE ions. Therefore, TM ions, such as Cu2+ and Cr3+, can serve as efficient activators or absorber ions for WL generation.39,86 For instance, Chen et al. demonstrated bright WL emission from a copper (Cu2+) silicate with a layered structure under 980 nm excitation.86


2.1.2 Oxides without any activator ion. 
It seems surprising that a metal oxide matrix without any activator ions also exhibits WL emission under NIR excitation, which is not (efficiently) absorbed by the material. Up to the present, WL emission has indeed been observed in native undoped oxides, including Y3Al5O12 (YAG),38 Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG),39 Ca12Al14O33,93 Y2O3,94–97 Y2Si2O7,65,98,99 Al2O3,40etc. For instance, Bilir's group synthesized undoped nano-powders of YAG and GGG,39 Y2O395,96,100 and γ-Al2O3,41 and observed WL emission ranging from 450 to 900 nm. They attributed the observed WL emission to pure thermal radiation induced by laser induced heating. Despite the apparent white colour, a small amount of residual OH groups or a low concentration of lattice defects was considered to be responsible for significant absorption of the laser energy under high pumping densities, which then led to a notable temperature rise of the oxide powders. Similarly, 12CaO·7Al2O3, an undoped oxide powder made up of purely main group oxides,101,102 shows strong WL generation under terahertz wave irradiation due to strong coupling with phonon modes of the lattice.103

2.2 Hybrid nanostructures
By utilizing the strong absorption arising from the plasmonic resonance from metallic or non-metallic nanostructures, the process of generation of WL emission can be efficiently enhanced in a number of hybrid systems made up of noble metal nanoparticles and inorganic phosphors.104 The observed emission under NIR laser pumping certainly cannot be explained by the two-photon luminescence of noble metal nanoparticles which have to be excited by an ultrafast pulsed laser and show characteristic emission peaks close to the plasmon resonance energy.105 Song's group synthesized a series of nanocomposites including Nd2O3/Au,106 Yb2O3/Au36 and Ag–SiO2–Er2O3,35 and observed strong white broadband emission under NIR laser excitation. Their results indicated that the introduction of Au nanoparticles could reduce the excitation threshold of WL emission, and the intensity is improved greatly benefiting from the efficient light capturing of noble metal nanostructures. Based on a similar metal/oxide composite made up of (Gd,Yb,Er)2O3 nanorods and surface Au nanoparticles, Debasu et al.107 demonstrated strong WL emission, which was used for temperature measurement from room temperature to over 1000 K by fitting the spectra with the thermal radiation model. The enhancement of WL emission in such structures can be apparently interpreted by a plasmonic enhancement effect that has been frequently utilized to boost photoluminescence, Raman scattering as well as photocatalytic activity,108–117 while the contribution of each component in such hybrid structures to the WL emission remains to be elucidated in a more precise manner.
2.3 Organometallic compounds and carbon-based materials
Similar to their inorganic counterparts (i.e., oxide phosphors), organometallic compounds containing strong NIR absorbing RE-complexes have also been examined for NIR laser driven WL emission.42–44,118–120 For instance, Ye et al.120 reported bright WL emission in RE complexes of perfluorinated organic ligands ([YbL3]0.7[TbL3]0.3, where L is tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) imidodiphosphinimidic) with low excitation power density (<10 W cm−2). The schematic illustration of the molecular structure and energy conversion is provided in Fig. 2a. As perfluorinated materials exhibit high stability,121,122 they realized the IR-excited thermal WL emission with tunable emission spectra based on the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tb3+ ions (see Fig. 2a). The observation of thermal WL emission without laser induced material degradation was explained by the high RE concentration without clustering in the RE complexes, which effectively reduces the chance of quenching. In addition, intense organic ligand vibrations provide nonradiative relaxation channels to de-excite the lanthanide excitations, which facilitate the generation of thermal emission.123,124

Without the presence of a NIR absorbing centre, WL emission has also been generated in a series of organometallic clusters upon NIR laser pumping. Rosemann et al.44 reported in 2016 broadband warm-white-light emission in organometallic clusters of [(RSn)4S6] (R = 4-(CH2CH)–C6H4) upon NIR laser irradiation. The molecular structure is shown in Fig. 2b. The compound is made up of an inorganic cluster core decorated with covalently attached organic ligands, namely, diamondoid [Sn4S6] scaffold as the core decorated with randomly oriented organic ligands R = 4-(CH2CH)–C6H4. Fig. 2c shows the structural drawings of 1,3,5,7-tetraphenyladamantane (AdPh4), which consists of an inversion-symmetry-free cluster core and organic ligands. This configuration results in a highly nonlinear response with an ultralow threshold that contributes to the strong nonlinear absorption of the NIR CW laser by the apparent white substance. The results reported by Rosemann et al.43 showed that the meta-ordered amorphous powder can convert incident NIR CW laser radiation into a white-light continuum spanning the visible spectrum, while macroscopically sized single crystals exhibit a lower order nonlinear response. Recently, the same group42 reported WL emission in a series of similar organic/inorganic hybrid compounds [(RSn)4E6] (R = aromatic substituent; E = S, Se) consisting of an inorganic cage with extreme NLO properties, as shown in Fig. 2d.
Carbon based materials that strongly absorb the NIR laser also exhibit WL emission under irradiation with a CW laser operating at different wavelengths. Carbon nanotubes,125–127 graphene foam,45,46 and single layer graphene128–132 have been investigated recently for the generation of WL emission under NIR and visible laser irradiation. The materials usually have to be stored in a vacuum chamber for WL generation to prevent contact with oxygen. As the absorption band of these carbon based materials is quite broad and strong compared with that of the above RE-doped materials, the WL emission can be produced by lasers of different wavelengths with a much lower threshold power. Particularly, the WL emission in single/few layered graphene samples showed a faster response with rapid switching speed, implying potential application in thermal optical modulation devices.133–136
For the organometallic compounds showing this laser induced WL emission, concerns about the possible laser induced material degradation are quite natural. Degradation of organic molecules sometimes results in rapid carbonization which leads to strong absorption of the NIR laser by the as-formed carbonaceous species. Whereas such assumptions could lead to the debate about the origin of WL emission, carbon itself is indeed an efficient absorber and a thermal emitter under NIR laser irradiation.
3. Photophysical behaviours of the CW laser driven WL emission
As discussed in Section 2, this WL emission phenomenon has been found in various organic and inorganic materials. In order to clarify the intrinsic process of WL emission, in this section, we focus on the spectral results reported on the NIR laser driven WL emission and discuss the photophysical behaviours observed in different materials.
3.1 Spectroscopic properties

3.1.1 WL emission spectra. 
The NIR laser driven WL emission is usually generated by using a NIR laser at, e.g., 980 nm, which matches the absorption band of the phosphor powders activated with RE ions like Yb3+. The use of other pumping wavelengths is also possible as long as the laser energy can be efficiently absorbed by the examined materials. In general, two distinct types of emission spectra have been observed in all types of materials. The first type of spectra (type-1) generally exhibit a broadband emission with a peak located in the range of 650–700 nm, while the second type of spectra (type-2) are characteristic of thermal radiation spectra showing good fitting results with Planck's law. From the published results recorded under similar excitation conditions, the spectral shape seems to be independent of material character and the dopant ion. Fig. 3 presents typical WL spectra produced by different oxides under excitation by a NIR laser at 980 nm and 808 nm. Except for Fig. 3a and e, all other spectra, which are recorded for 20% Yb3+ doped Y2SiO5,126 20% Nd3+ doped Y2O3,96 undoped Y2O3,96 NdAp,85 Sr2CeO4:Eu3+,77 and Ca12Al14O33,103 exhibit a similar shape with a peak located in the range of 600–800 nm, which we refer to as type-1 spectra. It has to be noted here that both the doping ion and matrix are different while the produced spectra are quite similar. Moreover, the same spectra were observed in the same oxide doped with different RE ions, for instance, Y2O3:Yb and Y2O3:Nd, which are pumped at 980 nm and 808 nm, respectively. As Nd3+ ions exhibit a large absorption cross section near 800 nm, an 808 nm laser is used as the pumping source instead of the 980 nm laser. In addition, it has to be noted that fine structures in the spectra of Nd-containing oxides are present at low excitation density (see Fig. 3c and f), which is attributed to the f–f transition of Nd3+ ions. These observations imply that the spectra recorded for oxide materials are independent of excitation wavelength, matrix and the doping ions. However, from the published literature the same optical spectra have been interpreted differently, as discussed in more detail in the section below.

In comparison, Fig. 3a and e present quite a different type of spectra showing a notable rise in spectral intensity without any fine structures at longer wavelength (type-2), which has been observed in similar oxide phosphors, as well as hybrid nanostructures, organometallic compounds and graphene (shown in Fig. 4–6). The absence of an emission peak precludes the origin of this emission from discrete emission centres; therefore thermal radiation is used to analyse the spectral curves. From the photographs of the samples taken under irradiation with NIR lasers (see the insets in Fig. 3a, b and e–g), the emission of all appears bright white, which implies that the optical spectra might be similar.

The power dependence of the integrated Yb emission intensity is plotted on logarithmic scale shown in the right inset (reproduced from ref. 120, Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society). 
WL generation with similar spectra has also been observed in a series of composite systems which combine oxide phosphors with plasmonic materials.35,36,104–107 Noble metal nanostructures are typical plasmonic materials which show localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks in the visible spectral region, while degenerate semiconductors with a much lower carrier density normally exhibit a longer LSPR wavelength, which is more beneficial for efficient capturing of NIR photons.137–139 As shown in Fig. 4b, discrete emission lines from Er3+ ions for the Ag/SiO2/Er2O3 composite disappear completely and again the spectra become dominated by a broad emission band with a peak at around 650 nm. Similar spectra are observed for Yb2O3/Au,36 Nd2O3/Au140 and TiO2:Yb, Er/Au104 composites, suggesting again that the spectra are material-independent. On the other hand, type-2 spectra are also observed in similar metal/oxide composites, such as (Gd, Yb, Er)2O3/Au.107 Replacement of the noble metal with a semiconductor based plasmonic material, Cu2−xS, produced similar enhancement of WL emission.141 As explained by the authors, the presence of plasmonic materials in these systems facilitates the capturing of pumping photons due to their larger absorption cross section as compared to that of RE ions; therefore the threshold for generating WL emission is notably reduced for these composites. According to electric field finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation (see Fig. 4d), the electric field strength |E|2 is concentrated near the surface of the plasmonic materials and the maximum intensity enhancement is over 90 times at the hot spots under the excitation of a 980 nm laser.141 Since the process of WL generation is apparently nonlinear (see Section 3.1.3), the enhancement of local field strength has been considered to be responsible for boosting the WL emission in these composites.
The CW laser driven WL emission observed in graphene also showed different spectral shapes (both type-1 and type-2) and this has led to different interpretations.45,46,142 As shown in Fig. 5a, a broad emission band with a peak located at around 680 nm was observed by Strek et al.,45 which is similar to the results obtained for Yb2O3 and other inorganic phosphors as shown in Fig. 3 and 4. In comparison, type-2 spectra without an intensity peak have also been reported for graphene under almost the same experimental conditions. In addition, as graphene shows strong absorption across the whole optical spectrum, pumping graphene powders at other wavelengths produces similar WL spectra, while the threshold and the power dependence for WL emission can be slightly different, as shown in Fig. 9d. The photographs taken when the samples are under NIR laser irradiation indicate that the emission is bright (Fig. 5a and b), but they give no additional information about the reason for the difference in the spectra.
The WL generation process under NIR laser irradiation has also been observed in a series of organometallic compounds. Since 2016, Dornsiepen et al.42,118 and Rosemann et al.43,44,119 have reported the synthesis and the photophysical behaviours of a series of organometallic clusters, such as [(RSn)4S6] (R = 4-(CH2CH)–C6H4). These specially designed materials are amorphous in nature and are composed of diamondoid-like clusters made up of low-cost raw materials. Their systems for recording the steady state and time-resolved spectra of the samples are given in Fig. 6a. The WL emission of their samples (Fig. 6b) was captured carefully by using a NIR filter to exclude the contribution from the NIR part of the emission (note: commercial digital cameras are also sensitive to NIR radiation).44 Therefore, thermal origin of the WL emission can be excluded and strong nonlinear dependence of pumping power suggests dominance of the nonthermal process (see Section 4.4). It is surprising that the photoluminescence of such materials without any activator centre like RE or TM ions can be generated by irradiation with a CW NIR diode laser at 980 nm. In this case, the absorption of laser energy at 980 nm could be mediated by organic ligands and other nonlinear processes, and it is therefore weak. As shown in Fig. 6b and c, the emission spectra exhibit a broadband with a peak at around 600–700 nm (type-1). More importantly, the WL emission from these clusters exhibits a very narrow angular spread, and its emission cone is slightly broader than that of the driving laser due to scattering caused by the amorphous character of the clusters. Therefore, this method would be able to outperform conventional approaches for artificial lighting with respect to the directionality of the emission.
The WL emission is affected by the type of metal and organic ligands in these organometallic clusters. The change of ligand and metal centre sometimes results in an improvement in the crystallinity of the material, eventually resulting in the emergence of SHG as the clusters have no inversion symmetry (see Fig. 6c).119 In their most recent report a different series of clusters of the formula [(RSn)4E6] (R = aromatic substituent; E = S, Se) were examined (Fig. 6d).42 Similar WL spectra were observed under similar experimental conditions, while slight blue and red shift could be induced by cyclopentadienyl and Se substitutions, respectively.
The WL emission is also observed for RE complexes containing, e.g., Yb3+ ions that have high absorption cross-section at 980 nm. Upon 980 nm pumping, strong and broadband WL emission is observed which can be assigned to type-2 spectra if the NIR part is omitted. The characteristic line-shaped f–f transitions of RE ions (e.g., Tb3+) are efficiently suppressed, implying again that the WL emission is independent of type of RE ions and hosts.


3.1.2 Spectral correction for detector sensitivity. 
The observation of quite different spectra in similar materials under similar experimental conditions (i.e., oxide phosphor doped with Yb3+ ions, and graphene) therefore raises concerns about the experimental details of spectral data collection. Typically, Si-detectors are used in different spectrophotometers which exhibit a notable reduction in efficiency at wavelengths longer than 700 nm (Fig. 7). Correction for detector response is thus critical which is implemented in most commercial equipment based on the correction functions obtained with standard light sources. Fig. 7 presents the typical WL spectra recorded under 980 nm excitation before and after correction for detector response obtained for Yb2O3, together with the response curve of a typical Si-based detector. Before correction, the type-1 spectrum with a peak at around 700 nm is observed. As the detector efficiency reaches the maximum at around 650 nm, after correction the intensity maximum disappears and the corrected spectrum changes to type-2. The change from type-1 to type-2 spectrum has also been observed after correction for spectral sensitivity in different materials, which strongly complicates the interpretation of the WL spectra and theoretical simulations.

3.1.3 Dynamics of the WL generation process. 
The WL generation in materials of a dominant non-thermal origin exhibits a fast relaxation in a time scale down to the ns region, which is similar to the ordinary photoluminescence process. For the NIR laser driven WL emission of a thermal origin, the spectral intensity increases with time (in a time scale of larger than 1 s) after turning on the excitation laser. Generally, the thermal WL emission from oxide phosphors is generated after 1–3 s after the sample is irradiated by the laser beam, and the spectral evolution differs from material to material in this initial period. Fig. 8a and b present the time evolution of the WL spectrum and photographs in a representative oxide phosphor, LiYbP4O12 powder.30 It is interesting to note that in the initial period, a short-lived blue emission (peaking at 472 nm) due to cooperative luminescence of the Yb3+ dimer is observed. After 0.67 s, the emission colour changes to yellow and after 1 s to bright white. In the following period, the emission intensity increases and finally stabilizes after 2.33 s. In a more detailed study on the WL emission for Yb2O3 under 980 nm excitation (Fig. 8c and d), it was found that the rise time is around 28 s which is one order of magnitude longer than the decay time after switching off the excitation light. This result is rationalized by considering a T4 dependence of spectral intensity according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law.143 In comparison, Fig. 8e shows that the rise time of this WL emission in graphene is around 0.2 s. The difference in the rise time for different materials is related to the absorption as well as the heat conduction of the samples.38,58,92,144 In general, low thermal conductivity and high absorption facilitate faster heat accumulation and may affect the thermal emission dynamics of the samples. Therefore, the doping concentration, packing density of the powder and sample composition all affect the rise time. Moreover, the rise time is also dependent on the pumping power and an increase in the pumping power results in a reduction in rise time. These relations imply that the WL emission is closely correlated with the temperature of the sample.

(f) Simulations based on the two-temperature model of the temporal evolution of the electronic temperature Tel (red line), the strongly coupled optical phonon temperature Top (black line), and of the resulting graphene light emission (green line, lower panel) for photon energies from 1.7 to 3.5 eV with excitation by a pair of laser pulses (1.5 eV) separated in time by 150 fs. Each pulse results in an absorbed fluence of F = 0.17 J m−2 (reproduced from ref. 131, Copyright 2010 American Physical Society). 
In comparison, single layer graphene samples exhibit a much faster decay rate in the fs timescale. Lui et al.131 observed ultrafast light emission from graphene under excitation by ultrashort (30 fs) laser pulses and examined the temporal evolution of the temperature of electrons (Tel) and strongly coupled optical phonons (Top), as well as the corresponding light emission. As shown in Fig. 8f, the evolution of the emission intensity of graphene is synchronized with the change in electron and lattice temperature. The higher thermal conductivity of graphene allows for much faster cooling and thus the decay of the emission is faster for single layer graphene samples, as compared to that of graphene powders. The ultrafast thermal response of graphene is associated with the change in optical response function, which may enable thermal optical modulation that is promising for photonic applications.133,134,136


3.1.4 Controlling factors of WL spectra. 
3.1.4.1 Pumping power. 
The generation of WL emission is an obvious nonlinear optical process. The pumping power dependence of WL emission intensity has been examined for many different materials. As shown in Fig. 9a, visible upconversion by f–f transitions of Er3+ is dominating at low pumping power for YVO4:Yb3+/Er3+, and strong WL emission is generated only when the pumping power rises above a threshold value, which varies depending on the sample characteristics as well as experimental conditions. At pumping power higher than the threshold value, the dependence of emission intensity on excitation power is strongly nonlinear. The dependence of anti-Stokes emission intensity on the incident pumping power P is usually discussed in terms of the power law I ∼ PN, where the N exponent is the number of NIR photons required to generate an upconversion emission photon. For the WL emission in different materials, the N values obtained in the lgI vs. lgP plot are usually far larger than 2, implying strong nonlinear nature of the process and the dominance of non-thermal processes. In extreme cases, the maximum N value can be over 10, which is reminiscent of the photon avalanche-like process (see Section 4.3).31,63,145

The inset is a photograph showing the WL emission of Tm2O3 under 808 nm laser excitation (e and f are reproduced from ref. 31, Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society). 
The N value is also dependent on the pumping power and the detection wavelength. For instance, a recent report on WL emission in a typical RE oxide, Yb2O3, by Wu et al.144 indicated that the N value evolved from 1.9 at low pumping density to a negative value at intermediate pumping density, and then the N value suddenly rose over 10 at high pumping densities (shown in Fig. 9b and c). A similar dependence of intensity on pumping density was observed at different emission wavelengths. The rapid rise of slope values exceeding 10 has also been observed in the power dependence of WL emission for Yb2O3/graphene mixtures, which correlates with a change in the emission mechanism.137 The sudden rise of N values has also been observed in the power dependence of WL emission in organometallic clusters44 and other inorganic phosphors.61,75,88,96,144 These results suggest that the generation of WL emission by the steady rise of pumping power consists of three stages that may be associated, respectively, with normal photoluminescence, incubation or energy accumulation period and photo-avalanche processes.
3.1.4.2 Pumping wavelength. 
To generate strong WL emission, the laser energy should be efficiently absorbed by the examined samples. Therefore, the laser wavelengths should be in resonance with the absorption of the dopant ions. This is why Yb3+ is used as its only f–f transition can be efficiently excited by a commercial 980 nm laser. The use of a laser at other wavelengths (e.g., 800 nm) has also been previously demonstrated to produce strong WL emission in oxide phosphors activated with Nd3+ and TM ions like Cu2+.64,86,96 On the other hand, it has been shown that in certain cases the laser wavelength does not have to be in resonance with the absorption peak of the examined materials, and the absorption is ascribed to the presence of defects or nonlinear processes. The generation of WL by this off-resonance pumping is relatively less effective, as observed in previously reported RE doped oxides.31
For materials with a broad absorption band like graphene and carbon nanotubes, the emission is in principle independent of the excitation wavelength. For instance, Strek et al.45,46 examined WL emission from graphene under excitation with different LDs. Due to the smooth absorption band of graphene, efficient WL emission is generated at all excitation wavelengths of 476, 488, 514, 808 and 975 nm, with only a slight difference in spectral intensity but no difference in spectral shape, as shown in Fig. 9d.
3.1.4.3 Environmental pressure. 
The most distinctive feature of this broadband WL emission is the strong quenching of the emission by the presence of the atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 9e. The quenching of WL emission has been found in different oxides, such as Yb2O3, Ce2O3, Tm2O3, etc.,31 and graphene powders. It has been shown that the intensity of WL emission strongly depends on the pressure of the sample chamber filled with air. The use of nitrogen or argon instead of air shows similar quenching of emission with the increase of pressure. Furthermore, Wang et al.31 confirmed that the quenching of WL emission was less effective in a helium atmosphere than in air because the diatomic molecule of higher mass (mair = 28.8, mHe = 4) can dissipate more energy by collision with the particles (Fig. 9f). It is generally accepted that the pressure dependence of WL emission can be interpreted by the heat conduction mediated by the surrounding atmosphere that reduces the temperature of the samples under laser irradiation. These investigations therefore implied that the WL emission is associated with thermal emission.
3.1.4.4 Other factors. 
As the thermal radiation spectrum is dependent on the temperature of the sample for WL emission based on thermal effects, heating the sample to a designated temperature could potentially influence the emission spectrum of the sample under NIR excitation. However, in a recent experiment carried out by Bilir et al.39 on GGG:Cr, it is shown that the emission spectrum remains almost unchanged by varying the environmental temperature from 33 K to 300 K. This result may imply that the thermal emission at the measurement temperature is too weak to affect the WL visible emission and precludes the WL emission as a thermally activated process.
In addition to the above factors, sample characteristics may also influence the WL emission as heat conduction has shown to play an important role in this process. For instance, the packing density (porosity) of the phosphor powders strongly influences the heat conduction. In addition, engineering the emissivity of the sample by using surface microstructures also allows the modulation of the thermal radiation spectrum.146 Moreover, intrinsic material properties like thermal conductivity, melting point, and density, as shown in the previous experiments, may also play an important role in the generation of efficient WL emission by NIR laser excitation.32


3.1.5 Quantum yield. 
The quantum yield (QY) of this NIR laser driven WL emission is expected to be low, as a large amount of laser energy is dissipated as heat or as invisible IR radiation. However, in the first report by Wang et al.,31 the power efficiency of the WL generation in Tm2O3 powder was nearly 8%. Moreover, Wang et al.32 showed that the QY for a ZrO2:28%Yb3+ powder under an excitation power density of 800 W cm−2 (980 nm) reached a surprising value of 16%, which far exceeded that recorded in contemporary upconversion materials activated by RE ions.147–149 However, the QY for other reported WL emission in different materials was not measured, possibly because precise determination of QY for the visible emission under NIR laser excitation remains technically difficult due to the limited spectral response range for Si-based detectors. We have used a commercial Hamamatsu QY-plus system to examine the QY of different oxide phosphors (including Yb3+ doped RE oxides) under focused 980 laser excitation, and found that the QY for all the examined samples is below the detection limit (0.1%) at a maximum excitation density of 800 W cm−2. Considering the nonlinear nature of this process, the QY values are expected to increase with the rise of excitation power, while the observation of QY larger than 10% for this WL generation process remains quite elusive.

3.2 Temperature evolution
Intense laser irradiation of the sample results in a rapid and notable temperature rise, which determines the intensity and shape of the thermal radiation spectrum of samples. Therefore, it is of high significance to measure precisely the sample temperature during laser irradiation. Currently, the sample temperature under IR laser illumination has been determined either by the optical method (e.g., using a thermal camera) or by a direct measurement with a thermal couple or a thermal camera.
By assuming that the observed spectra come from thermal emission, the sample temperature can be derived by fitting the spectral curve with Planck's law for thermal radiation. Fig. 10a shows the determined radiation temperature (blackbody temperature) as a function of excitation power for a typical Yb3+ activated oxide.32 The highest hotspot temperature can be over 2000 °C, which is much higher than the temperatures determined with a thermal couple or a thermal camera. Currently, commercial thermal cameras automatically capture the hot spot with the highest temperature and thus the temperature of the laser focus on the sample surface can be determined. Such cameras determine the sample temperature based on the IR emission in the 8–14 μm range also according to the thermal emission spectrum based on Planck's law. The dependence of sample temperature on pumping power for LiYbP4O12 under 980 nm laser irradiation was determined by Strek et al.,30 as shown in Fig. 10b. In the pumping power range of 0.1–1.5 W the temperature of the phosphor powders increases from 50 °C to 550 °C, at which the sample starts to glow visible WL emission, and the highest temperature reached at the maximum LD power is around 800 °C, much lower than the radiation temperature obtained by fitting with Planck's law. In another experiment (Fig. 10c) performed by Wu et al.,144 it was shown that the temperature determined directly with a thermal couple is also much lower than the radiation temperature, as capturing the precise temperature of the laser focus might be impossible due to the small size of the hot spot located near the sample surface.144Fig. 10d shows the spatial temperature distribution of Yb2O3 microcrystals upon 980 nm laser excitation detected by an IR thermal camera. It can be seen that the temperature rising with a large temperature gradient of around 100 K μm−1 is localized at the focal position with an area of around 100 × 100 μm. In fact, the size of focal area could be much smaller.

(e) Time evolution of temperature (around the focus) under CW 980 nm laser irradiation for Yb2O3 (c, d and e are reproduced from ref. 144, Copyright 2018 Royal Society of Chemistry). 
Different from the methods that determine the sample temperature from the thermal emission spectra, it is also possible to measure sample temperature optically by using luminescent particles as temperature probes.150–152 For instance, based on the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio of the multiple emission peaks of RE doped materials, it is possible to determine sample temperature in a wide temperature range,153,154 from cryonic temperature to over 1000 °C. Wu et al.142 examined the temperature of the graphene powder by using RE-doped upconversion oxide as the probe under irradiation by a 980 nm laser. A stepwise increase of temperature was observed with the increase of laser power, which is in agreement with the excitation power dependence of emission intensity. It is further confirmed that the photon-valence-like power dependence of the WL emission can be correlated with the temperature increase at high pumping densities.137,139 On the other hand, by comparing the time evolution of temperature (around the focus) presented in Fig. 10e and WL emission intensity (Fig. 8d), it is unravelled that their rise time (≈30 s and 28 s) are very close, while the decrease of temperature is much slower than the decay of the emission, indicating the presence of a temperature threshold for generating WL emission. The faster decay of WL emission has been attributed to its T4 dependence dictated by the thermal radiation law.
The large gaps between the derived radiation temperature (by Planck's law) and the directly measured temperature raise an open question: which temperature is more reasonable and correct? The radiation temperature determined from the spectra (by fitting with Planck's law) might be unreasonable considering the presence of non-thermal photoluminescence (i.e., direct photon-to-photon process) in certain cases and the approximation of sample emissivity to unity. Nevertheless, the presence of temperature distribution and the small size of the hot spot at the laser focus strongly hinder the measurement with high accuracy. Therefore, direct measurement might have to be combined with simulation to probe more precisely the sample temperature and its distribution across the laser focus in the future.
3.3 Photoelectrical response
A few researchers suggested that the charge transfer process occurs under intense NIR laser illumination, which is expected to increase the photo-conductance of the samples.30,45,46,64,77,85,88,155 To confirm this process, the photoconductivity measurement was carried out in a few RE oxide phosphors under excitation by a NIR laser. Fig. 11 shows a typical time trace of sample resistance for Sr2CeO4 nanocrystals recorded by using high-resistance electrometry under 975 nm laser excitation.88 It can be seen that the change in resistance increases with the rise of laser power and the photocurrent depends linearly on the excitation laser power. Fig. 11c presents the dependence of conductivity on the frequency measured by using alternating current excitation. At the minimal frequency of 0.1 Hz, the result reveals four orders of magnitude increase in the conductivity, from 10−9 S m−1 in the dark to 10−5 S m−1 for the sample illuminated with a laser power of 2 W. A similar dependence of conductivity on the laser power has also been observed in other oxide phosphors doped with RE ions.30,64 The WL emission accompanied by the surge of photoconductivity is usually associated with the multiphoton absorption process, which then results in metal to ligand electron transfer that boosts the photoconductivity of the samples.

4. Mechanisms for the CW laser driven WL emission
The above experimental evidence suggests that continuum WL generation is not limited to RE/TM doped phosphors, but is rather a general photo-physical process as long as the excitation laser energy is efficiently absorbed. For the materials with quite different characters, the general features including the continuum spectra, pressure dependence, and threshold behaviours have been observed in many systems, but have been interpreted by different mechanisms depending on the materials examined. Up to the present, the proposed mechanisms include black body radiation,32,57,81 charge transfer luminescence,30,37,56,60,64,77,88,93,156,157 thermal avalanche,29,31,63 photon avalanche,158 electron–hole recombination,36,61,159 oxygen vacancy emission,59,75etc. Therefore, a general understanding has not yet been established amongst scientists on the mechanisms about white light generation excited by CW NIR lasers discussed above.
4.1 Black body radiation
Blackbody radiation is playing a pivotal role in physics from the early days of quantum mechanics, astrophysical measurements to today's nanostructures.160,161 Any object above 0 K constantly radiates, absorbs and reflects electromagnetic waves. Blackbody radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, emitted by a black body. It has a characteristic, continuous frequency spectrum that depends only on the body's temperature.162 This character is similar to the observed emission spectrum of this broadband WL emission discussed in this review. Combined with the temperature rise during WL emission, it is quite natural to ascribe the NIR laser driven WL emission to the thermal emission. Samples being heated to over the Draper point, 798 K, start to glow visible light and bright white light can be observed for objects at temperatures over 6000 K.
The spectral intensity for the radiation of an ideal blackbody at thermal equilibrium is described by Planck's law as PT(λ) = ahc2/λ5(e(hc/λTkB) − 1),(1)where PT(λ) is the energy density, a is the fitting parameter, h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, λ is the wavelength and kB is Boltzmann's constant. The spectrum is only dependent on the sample temperature and the position of the peak (λmax) can be approximated by Wien's displacement law: (2)where b (= 2.8977729 × 10−3 m K) is known as Wien's displacement constant. The emission power of ideal blackbody radiation is related to temperature by the Stefan–Boltzmann law: j = σT4(3)where j is the radiant heat emitted from a unit of area per unit time, T is the absolute temperature, and σ = 5.670367 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.
It has been confirmed in many investigations that the spectra of NIR laser-driven WL emission can be nicely fitted by eqn (1), thus substantiating the emission as a purely thermal process. In addition, the observation of shift of the spectral peak with the rise of excitation laser power and sample temperature is also consistent with Wien's displacement law. For instance, the broad emission in yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ:Er3+,Yb3+) upon excitation at 980 nm can be well fitted by Planck's law of blackbody radiation, giving a radiation temperature of over 1000 K. Similarly, by fitting the spectral curve obtained with Yb3+ doped ZrO2 with eqn (1), Wang et al.32 found that the derived sample temperature can be over 2400 K for samples with bright WL emission (Fig. 9a). Fitting of the WL spectra by eqn (1) was also reported by Cinkaya et al.67 and González et al.78 for the Yb3+ doped Y2O3–SiO2 and Y2O3–ZrO2 systems, in which high radiation temperatures were also reported. The WL emission from single/few-layered graphene as well as graphene powders also shows similar WL spectra under both ultrafast pulsed or CW NIR laser excitation (Fig. 12b), which has been generally understood by a thermal emission mechanism.81,128–132,163,164 This mechanism is also supported by the pressure dependence of the emission (see the discussion above) considering that heat conduction by convection prevails in non-vacuum conditions.
 Fig. 12  (a) Broad WL emission recorded under two different laser powers for YSZ:Er,Yb powders. The black dot curves in the figure represent the fit of the broad emission to Planck's law of blackbody radiation. And the calculated temperatures are indicated in the figures (reproduced from ref. 33, Copyright 2013 the Royal Society of Chemistry). (b) Spectral fluence of light emission from graphene under excitation with 30 fs pulses and absorbed fluence of F = 0.17 and 0.33 J m−2. The spectra are fitted with the model based on thermal emission (dashed blue lines) for Tem = 2760 K and 3180 K, respectively (reproduced from ref. 131, Copyright 2010 American Physical Society). (c) Radiation spectra for blackbody radiation at different temperatures calculated by Planck's law (reproduced from ref. 144, Copyright 2010 American Physical Society). 
The main concern with the validity of this mechanism is that the derived radiation temperature according to eqn (1) is sometimes unreasonably high, and it can be higher than the melting temperature of the material. In comparison, the spectral maxima for thermal radiation (from eqn (1)) (Fig. 12c) at the IR-camera recorded temperatures (Fig. 10c) are in the range of 2.0–3.5 μm, which are strongly red shifted compared with the observed spectra in previous reports. In addition, the fitting with eqn (1) is always based on the spectral data recorded in the short wavelength region, and fitting with the whole spectra is always impossible due to the limited detection range provided by the spectrometer. On the other hand, the above simulations are all made based on ideal thermal radiation by assuming unity emissivity. For more precise analysis of the WL emission based on the thermal emission process, the grey body model should be used instead and the wavelength dependence of emissivity and the possibility of the presence of a non-equilibrium state have to be considered.
4.2 Charge transfer process
Charge transfer (CT) is the process of the transfer of a fraction of electronic charge between molecular or ionic entities.165,166 The source molecule from which the charge is transferred is called the electron donor and the receiving species is called the electron acceptor. CT complexes exist in many types of molecules, including both inorganic and organic compounds in the form of solids, liquids and solutions. In inorganic chemistry, most CT complexes involve electron transfer between metal atoms and ligands. They are classified as either ligand-to-metal or metal-to-ligand charge transfer complexes depending on the direction of charge transfer. CT luminescence has been widely observed in organic and inorganic materials.167,168
CT absorption bands are usually intense and often lie in the ultraviolet or visible spectral range. Most RE ions do not exhibit CT luminescence because of the rapid non-radiative relaxation from the CT states to high lying excited 5d or 4f states. However, in Yb3+-containing compounds, CT states are located within wide gap of Yb3+ formed by the low lying 4f and high lying 5d levels, such that CT luminescence can result through allowed transitions.169,170 Strek et al.30 stated that the CT band could be effectively populated to create electron transfer from O2− to Yb3+ that resulted in the formation of the Yb2+-CT cluster by investigating the efficient anti-Stokes white broadband emission in LiYbP4O12 nanocrystalline powder upon illumination with a 976 nm laser diode. Verma et al.171 also observed broadband WL emission in Yb3+ doped MO-Al2O3 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) phosphors and explained the WL emission by the CT process in terms of the inter-conversion between Yb3+ and Yb2+ ions. The excitation of the charge transfer state in Yb-doped materials is shown in Fig. 13. The process begins with the transfer of an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) via multiphoton absorption as a result of NIR laser irradiation. Afterwards, the host molecules become ionized through a multiphoton ionization process, resulting in the formation of free electrons which then combine with the rare earth (Yb3+) ions to form Yb2+ ions and produce the CT luminescence. Similarly, Stefanski et al.77 used the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process to explain the WL emission (NIR excitation) of Eu3+:Sr2CeO4 nanocrystals. Similar to Yb3+ ions, Eu3+ ions also have a low-lying CT band and the CT process through Eu3+–O2− electron transfer produces strong white emission. The photo-generated free electrons combine with both Ce4+ and Eu3+ ions to create Ce4+–Ce3+ and Eu3+–Eu2+ ion pairs in the system, which consequently allows for CT emission transitions between the ions with various valences. In these investigations, the presence of the CT process is correlated with the rise of photoconductance in the material under NIR laser excitation,77 which indicates the generation of free carriers. However, since CT bands are located in the short wavelength range (<550 nm) for RE (Yb or Eu) doped oxides, the observed broadband spectra without a noticeable peak (in type-2 spectra) in similar oxide phosphors seem to be governed by a distinct mechanism in spite of the quite similar material characteristics and experimental conditions.

4.3 Thermal avalanche
Thermal avalanche has been suggested as the dominating mechanism for the rapid rise of emission intensity as excitation power exceeds a threshold value.29,31,63 This mechanism was first proposed by Wang et al.31 for the explanation of the bright anti-Stokes white emission in fully concentrated simple RE oxides. They compared the spectra recorded by storing the samples in helium and air, and concluded that the diatomic molecule of higher mass can dissipate more energy by collision with the RE oxide particles during WL emission. The dissipation of the laser energy involves cross-relaxation accompanied by the thermal avalanche process under high excitation densities. This is in line with the excitation power dependence (ln–ln plot) of WL emission intensity which indicates the strong nonlinear nature of the process. The observation of slope values (N) greater than 2 (sometimes larger than 10) implies that the broadband emission probably involves a photon avalanche population process.145,172 Nevertheless, the photon avalanche model has also been previously used to explain the power dependence of upconversion in RE doped materials with a well-resolved emission line from RE ions,173–176 which is completely different from the smooth WL spectra discussed here.
4.4 Other mechanisms
Since the above mechanisms sometimes do not agree fully with all experimental observations made in a variety of materials, in addition to the mechanisms mentioned above, the following explanations have also been proposed to account for the observed spectra in different materials, including bremsstrahlung, emission of oxygen species, etc.
For the WL emission of organometallic clusters, Rosemann et al.44 in their first report in Science considered that the WL emission is associated with the bremsstrahlung process in the compound [(RSn)4S6] (R = 4-(CH2CH)–C6H4). Under 800 nm NIR laser excitation, the WL emission is ascribed to bremsstrahlung that is produced by the delocalized electrons supplied by the π-electron systems of the organic ligands under NIR laser irradiation (see Fig. 14a). The power dependence of WL intensity reveals strong nonlinearity of the process, which may preclude the contribution of thermal emission to the observed WL spectra. From their simulations, the experimental spectra can be nicely reproduced in the framework of the bremsstrahlung process. Recently, they observed the WL generation in the clusters with the general formula of [(RSn)4E6] (R = aromatic substituent; E = S, Se) under CW and pulsed NIR laser excitation.42 They suggested that the WL process is based upon excitation of electrons near the Fermi level with photon energies below the HOMO–LUMO gap, and thus the emission energy is related with the type of ligands. And the crucial requirement concerning the electronic structure of potential white-light emitters is a sufficiently large HOMO–LUMO gap. Additionally, because crystallinity allows for a preference of SHG emission, the amorphous nature of the compounds determines whether WL or second-harmonic generation (SHG) can be observed.

(b) Proposed mechanism for the luminescence from C12A7:O2− induced by T-ray irradiation (reproduced from ref. 103, Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society). (c) CW excitation models in bilayer and trilayer graphene systems (reproduced from ref. 46, Copyright 2015 Nature). 
In the examination of THz light (0.1–10 THz) induced WL emission in C12A7:O2− where part of O2− are trapped in the Ca–Al–O polyhedron cages, Toda et al.103 observed that THz irradiation resulted in the rattling of the cage oxygen atoms. Experiment and calculations based on DFT confirmed that the coupling of rattling mode with THz wave results in the formation of oxygen species including singlet oxygen and O2− that show strong broadband emission in the NIR region. From the comparison of the spectra, heating induced thermal emission that can be described by Planck's law (see the section above) can be excluded, and thus the broadband emission is ascribed to oxygen species. They suggest that the formation of emissive oxygen species upon THz excitation comprises four steps: (i) excitation of the rattling modes for cage oxygen species (O2−); (ii) electronic excitation and ionization of oxygen species and (iii) recombination to generate other oxygen species (e.g., singlet oxygen); (iv) when the O2 captures the electron, formation of O2− along with the generation of light emission (see Fig. 14b for the process).
For graphene, Strek et al.46 examined the WL emission of graphene powders under CW laser excitation at different wavelengths (476, 488, 514, 808 and 974 nm) and they observed supra-linear behaviour in addition to the presence of a threshold pumping power. Ambient pressure strongly affects the WL emission, while variation in sample temperature does not seem to change the emission spectra. Since photocurrent is closely related to pumping power, they suggest that π → π* transitions and electron–hole pairs are produced by CW laser excitation. Subsequent excitations create a growing population of mutually repulsive electron–hole states. The electronic energy was then channelled into electron–hole localization. The emission is finally produced by the sp2 → sp3 transition which results in the opening of a band gap. For the WL emission in μ-diamonds of primary sp3 nature, sp2 → sp3 hybridization change can also occur upon intense NIR laser irradiation in μ-diamonds, generating intense and bright WL emission.177
From the over 100 materials examined, the WL emission has also been occasionally ascribed to defect luminescence,75,96 electron hole recombination,36,38,61 and the emission of sub-valent RE ions like Yb2+.61,75 Most of these explanations are based on the presence of an emission peak located at around 600–800 nm, which, however, could be convincingly interpreted as an experimental artefact if the spectra are not well calibrated for detector response, as we discussed above (see Section 3.1.2). Considering that similar photophysical behaviours have been observed in most of these reports, it seems that this WL emission under NIR laser excitation can be understood by a more general mechanism. For instance, similar NIR laser induced WL emission has been observed in graphene and oxide phosphors, but always ascribed to quite different physical mechanisms. However, by examining the WL emission of their mixtures, it was shown recently by Wu et al.142 that the same WL emission can be produced with similar dynamics, implying that the mechanism can be generalized by a single process, which awaits confirmation in more detail from both theoretical and experimental sides.
5. Applications
5.1 Solid state lighting
Laser light has been commercialized for use as a headlight in road vehicles by car manufacturers like BMW. The WL emission from the laser light is produced by excitation of a phosphor ceramic with a blue laser diode, and it offers high directionality and high brightness compared with white LEDs.178 The use of a NIR laser to driven WL emission as discussed previously may offer another possible route to construct laser light. A schematic of the proposed geometrical configurations for integrating our thermal WL material for laser-driven solid state lighting is shown in Fig. 15a. Despite the fact that the overall efficiency might be lower compared with LEDs, this NIR laser driven white light source offers obvious advantages, such as tunable colour temperature, which depends only on excitation density. In addition, it would be also possible to tune the emission spectra by modulation of the wavelength-dependence of emissivity and reflectivity of the emitting medium. For instance, structured surfaces, including meta-surface and photonic crystals, have been shown to control the thermal emission in the IR range based on different materials.179,180 Application of these methods to the NIR laser driven white light emission discussed here may lead to large enhancement in emission efficiency and spectral properties.

5.2 Spectral conversion for solar cells
This type of emission enables the steady-state operation of a broadband WL source covering the entire visible spectrum driven by NIR light. The extracted high-energy photons are emitted in a range that can be absorbed by commercial PV devices, potentially delivering cost-effective thermal PV devices to exceed the efficiency limit.181–183 On the other hand, spectral conversion by downconversion and upconversion processes has been regarded as a potential way to enhance the efficiency of many solar energy conversion technologies.184–187 Laser induced WL thermal emission has been used to drive a solar cell by Wang et al.32 in 2014, and they found that the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of the Si solar cell reached ∼90%. In their experiment, the WL emission was generated by pumping 28 mol% Yb3+-doped ZrO2 with a 976 nm laser at 1.60 W. The electricity generated by the solar cell was used to drive a green light-emitting diode and a miniature motor with a small propeller. In addition, they also proposed new geometrical configurations for applying the WL emission material to photovoltaic applications, as shown in Fig. 15b. Bifacial solar cells can reabsorb the upconversion high-energy photons which are converted from the low-energy photons that pass through the solar cell without being absorbed. Those low-energy photons are focused with a lens, a parabolic concentrator or a micro-lens array onto the WL emission material, where WL emission is generated to drive the other side of the solar cell.
Zhou et al.141 also demonstrated highly efficient broadband WL emission based on the mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 (mCSE) nanocomposites, which are utilized to harvest NIR radiation to improve the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The schematic illustration of the energy transfer process in CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells using mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 composites is shown in Fig. 15c. From the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs in Fig. 15d, it can be seen that the spectral range for the generation of photocurrent in the PSC with mCSE composites extends to ∼1000 nm compared with ∼820 nm without mCSE. This result can be rationalized considering that mCSE composites absorb the near-infrared light and contribute to photocurrent generation. Meanwhile, the response of photocurrent in the region from 400 to 800 nm is enhanced as well. The improvement of PCE has also been reported for similar hybrid nanostructures made up of plasmonic nanoparticles and inorganic phosphor.36 Therefore, this WL generation process provides an efficient strategy for enhancing the utilization of infrared light via the upconversion process in photovoltaic devices.
5.3 Optical thermometry and beyond
Since the thermal emission is temperature dependent, the thermal emission spectrum is only related with the temperature and the emissivity of the sample. By fitting the emission spectra with Planck's law for blackbody radiation, the radiation temperature can be determined. Debasu et al.107 demonstrated the use of (Gd,Yb,Er)2O3 nanoparticles covered with Au nanoparticles for optical thermometry at temperatures up to 2000 K. In the temperature range of 300–1050 K, the temperature is determined based on the emission intensity ratio from thermally coupled energy levels of Er3+ (i.e., the intensity ratio of the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition to the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition). In the high temperature range up to 2000 K, the sample temperature is determined by fitting the spectral curve with Planck's law for blackbody radiation. This type of optical thermometry has been commercialized and widely used for contactless temperature measurement.
In addition to thermometry, laser induced incandescence, as a technique for particle size measurement, has been well-developed for years.188–193 Pulsed laser excitation induces incandescence of the particles that can be described by thermal radiation, and its decay is size dependent as (4)where Λ0 is the intensity scaling factor, mp is the nanoparticle mass, dp is the nanoparticle diameter, and t0 is the time at the arrival of the laser pulse. In the measurement, a CCD camera is used to capture the time evolution of the incandescence intensity and size distribution is then derived through a series of mathematical treatment. This method is widely used for the examination of aerosol and more details of this method regarding the instrumentation as well as the mathematics can be found elsewhere.190–193
6. Conclusions and future perspectives
Efficient generation of WL under NIR laser pumping has been observed in diverse materials including oxide phosphors, organometallic compounds and carbon-based materials. The photophysical behaviours associated with the WL generation process have been thoroughly examined by different techniques, such as optical spectroscopy, electrical transport, and photoconductance. The observed WL emission is in general characterized by the structureless continuum spectra with the intensity nonlinearly dependent on the excitation laser power. Moreover, the WL emission spectra are almost independent of material properties, such as optical bandgap, but they are influenced by ambient pressure, excitation power and wavelength. From these previous investigations it can be generally established that efficient NIR laser driven WL emitters should bear at least the following characteristics: (a) high thermal and chemical stability; (b) strong absorption at the excitation laser wavelength; and (c) low thermal conductivity.
Whereas similar spectral results are widely observed in different materials, it is surprising that the given mechanisms are rather scattered. Pure thermal radiation by laser induced heating and the emission by discrete centres like RE ions and oxygen species have been proposed to account for the WL generation by different researchers. Compared with pure thermal emission recorded by heating the sample to a specific temperature, the WL spectra driven by a NIR laser is often obtained at a much lower temperature and the emissivity of the examined sample might be much lower than 1, which might lead to misinterpretation of the spectral curves based on eqn (1). In a more general sense, this process might be better described by a thermally assisted direct photon-to-photon conversion process, while the details still await confirmation from both theoretical and experimental sides. Understanding the inherent physical process leading to the broadband WL emission can enable a deeper understanding of the interplay among the excitation source, excitation regime and internal material interactions. Such conscious knowledge is the key to suggest strategies to find new materials beyond the specific systems we have investigated.
In spite of the low overall emission efficiency, the potential application of this process as a white light source should not be underestimated, as the examined materials and structures are not yet fully optimized for this process by the state-of-the-art techniques. For instance, it is now possible to modulate directionality and the spectrum of WL emission by the use of photonic structures in the visible spectral region.194–197 In addition, in terms of thermal emission, the emissivity of the materials can also be finely tailored to modify the thermal radiation spectra by the use of surface nanoscale structures and, e.g., metasurfaces, which have been well developed for regulation of infrared and microwave emission characteristics for metals,198,199 semiconductors200 and polymers,201–203 and composite fabrics.194,204–206 The use of these techniques may allow unprecedented control of the emission characteristics of the WL generation based on the discussed materials and may promise broad applications from lighting to precision spectroscopy.
