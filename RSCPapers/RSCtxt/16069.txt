    , Accepted 13th August 2019First published on 19th August 2019AbstractCarbon-based HTM-free perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) have received extensive attention due to their low cost and high stability. However, some issues with regard to their relatively low efficiency and toxicity still need to be addressed before their commercialization. For the first time, a high-efficiency carbon-based planar perovskite solar cell was prepared based on TiO2 combined with PC61BM as the electron-transport layer. PC61BM could passivate the interface between the perovskite film layer and the TiO2 film layer; at the same time, it also exhibited the function of an additive to improve the crystal quality of the perovskite. Planar C-PSC was successfully fabricated with an open voltage (Voc) of 1.005 V, which represented ∼2.6% enhancement compared to that of the device with a mesoporous structure, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.37%. Moreover, stability was also investigated; 3% degradation appeared in the PCE of the planar C-PSC after being stored for 1900 h in the dark. This methodology of introducing PC61BM to reduce the recombination probability of electrons and holes and improve the crystal quality of perovskites has universal significance for the further development of planar C-PSCs.
Introduction
With the continuous development of human society, energy consumption is becoming an increasingly serious issue. Searching for new energy is an important way to solve the energy crisis. Solar energy has gradually gained much attention. Solution-processed metal halide perovskites are recognized as potential candidates as light-sensitive materials because of their remarkable optoelectronic and distinct physical properties, such as a tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and long carrier diffusion length.1–4 Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention due to low cost and solution processability5–8 and their maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 3.8% (ref. 9) in 2009 to certified 24.2% (ref. 10) in 2019. However, the cost and stability of PSCs must be addressed before their commercialization is feasible.11 Carbon materials are used everywhere. Carbon materials can be used not only in other fields such as in thermal storage,12–14 but also as electrodes to replace precious metals in perovskite batteries. Carbon-based HTM-free PSCs (C-PSCs) seem to be the most promising because the expensive hole-transporting material is omitted and the process is simple. More importantly, C-PSCs are intrinsically water-resistant, steady and inert to ion migration.15–26
To date, for the typical carbon-based HTM-free PSCs made up of working electrode (cathode)/electron-transport layer (ETL)/perovskite layer/counter electrode (carbon), ETL plays a vital role in charge transportation and separation, avoiding the electrical shunts between the FTO/perovskite and perovskite/counter electrode interfaces. Carbon-based HTM-free PSCs often use compact TiO2 as the electron-transport layer and mesoporous TiO2 as the scaffold, but the Voc value of this structure (<1 V) is less than that of metal-based perovskite solar cells. If the carbon-based structure is changed, high Voc will be obtained, resulting in a high cell performance. Currently, the most efficient (PCE ∼15.38%) planar C-PSCs are those reported by Meng et al.27 The structure of their device comprises fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/C60/MAPbI3/carbon, forming a so-called all-carbon-based PSC. However, C60 still needs the vacuum coating technology, which hinders the large-scale commercialization of carbon-based PSCs. However, it affords the highest efficiency and stability of the planar-heterojunction carbon-based structure than that of the mesoporous structure with relatively thick mesoscopic TiO2.28–30 In addition, suppressed charge recombination and facilitated charge collection are critical for achieving PSCs with improved efficiency and stability. Liao et al.31 studied a multifunctional 2D polymeric semiconductor incorporated into a perovskite ink to assist the crystal growth of perovskite films with large grains and fewer defects. They found that anchoring heterogeneous polymeric molecules on perovskites not only enhances the efficacy of defect passivation at the grain boundaries and/or the surface but also facilitates the charge extraction and collection. Wang et al.32 employed thermally stable (NH2)2CHPbI3(FAPbI3) as the light absorber for carbon-based and HTM-free PSCs and improved the device power conversion efficiency from 10.81% to 14.14%. Wu et al.33 reported an additive strategy to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs made by scalable blading. The blade-coated PSCs incorporating bilateral alkyl amine (BAA) additives achieved PCEs of 21.5 (aperture, 0.08 cm2) and 20.0% (aperture, 1.1 cm2), with a record small open-circuit voltage deficit of 0.35 V under AM 1.5G illumination. The stabilized PCE exhibited 22.6% under 0.3 sun. Here, an innovative closely packed rutile TiO2 nanowire (CRTNW) network parallel to the facet of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate was reported, which could serve as a 1D nanoscale electron-transport pathway for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs).34 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without an electron-transport layer (ETL) exhibit fascinating advantages. Liao et al.35 provided a simple approach to modify the perovskite film morphology and demonstrated the correlation between facilitated charge-carrier extraction and high-performance ETL-free perovskite photovoltaics using an additive-assisted morphological engineering strategy to construct an intriguing bilayer perovskite film featuring a dense bottom layer and a maze-like top layer. The preparation method of the perovskite layer used in this paper is published in our previous article.36 CH3COONH4 was added to MAPbI3 to improve the crystal quality of perovskite thin films and PCE of 13.8% was obtained.
In this paper, we reported the performance of high-open-voltage carbon-based HTM-free PSCs by using TiO2/PC61BM as the ETL with the equipment configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon. The best-performing carbon-based PSCs fabricated with TiO2/PC61BM achieved PCE of 14.37% with high Voc (1.005 V). Meanwhile, long-term stability was obtained, maintaining 97% of the initial performance with a relative humidity of 30–40% at room temperature.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the device configuration of the carbon-based HTM-free PSC by using PC61BM instead of m-TiO2, with the equipment structure of FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon. The production process of the device is shown in Fig. S1.† First, a compact TiO2 nanocrystalline film and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) layer were sequentially spin-coated on FTO as the electron-transport material to accelerate charge extraction and reduce the probability of electron–hole recombination. Then, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on top of the PC61BM layer to form a uniform and dense perovskite film. Eventually, a printed commercial carbon paste was used as the carbon electrode.17,37 The large-scale application of perovskite solar cells can be realized by brushing the electrodes of C-PSCs. Fig. 1b shows the energy level of each layer of the PSC device. There is almost no potential difference between the conduction band (CB) of the c-TiO2 layer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PC61BM layer, which is very close to the CB of perovskite. The valence band (VB) of the carbon electrode (−5.0 eV) matches the VB of perovskite, which is very important to minimize the loss of open circuit voltage (Voc). In order to show the microscopic morphology of PSCs more clearly, we performed a scanning electron microscopy test. Fig. 1c and d show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PSC with the FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon structure cross-sectional morphology. Here, perovskites (∼400 nm) were deposited on c-TiO2/PC61BM (∼70 nm). The thickness of the carbon electrode was measured to be about 15 μm, which could efficiently prevent the perovskite layer from moisture penetration. Chiang et al.38 reported an inverted bulk heterojunction perovskite-PC61BM solar cell with a high fill factor of 0.82, in which PC61BM was used as an additive. To explore whether the PC61BM electron-transport layer was partially present in the perovskite layer, we performed deep analysis of the sample by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The depth profile of the key elements in the PSC determined by TOF-SIMS is shown in Fig. 2a. The abscissa axis represents the sputtering time and the ordinate axis represents the strength of ions. I+ and Pb+ can be ejected from the perovskite layer. The C61+ ion trace is indicative of PC61BM, Ti+ comes from ETL, and Sn+ comes from the FTO electrode. As shown in Fig. 2a, the signal of PC61BM in the perovskite layer indicates that PC61BM partially dissolves in the perovskite layer, which suggests that the introduction of PC61BM not only accelerates the extraction of electrons, but also reduces the probability of charge recombination. Moreover, it can lead to high-quality perovskites with enlarged grain size, prolonged photoluminescence lifetime, and lowered defect density as well as an ultimately enhanced photovoltaic performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the perovskite films was performed to confirm their crystallinities (Fig. 2b). We used the MAPbI3:CH3COONH4 perovskite compositions, which showed excellent stability and reproducibility.36 Two perovskite layers (PC61BM/PVSK and m-TiO2/PVSK) showed the same XRD patterns and their intensities were also similar, demonstrating that PCBM did not disturb the growth of perovskite crystals. Moreover, the single-crystal CH3NH3PbI3 reference (ICSD 241477) is shown in Fig. 2b. An immediately apparent trend here is the dominance of the (110) and (220) planes among the CH3NH3PbI3 peaks, which evidences preferential grain growth during perovskite synthesis. Fortunately, the intrinsic crystal structure of the finally acquired perovskites was maintained after the introduction of PC61BM.

Different PC61BM spin-coating processes will affect the quality of the perovskite layer, which in turn affects the performance of the entire perovskite solar cell. The thickness of PC61BM was adjusted by using different rotation speeds to achieve the optimal morphology and crystal quality of the perovskite layer, and the best performance of the PSCs was obtained. The crystal structures of the perovskite films (without carbon layers) fabricated at various speeds of PC61BM were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 3a. The selected speed parameters are 1000 rpm, 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, and 4000 rpm. As the figure shows, the crystal structure of the perovskite film fabricated on the PC61BM layer was obtained, and the composition did not change, indicating that the perovskite crystal was still a tetragonal phase structure. It was further concluded from the XRD pattern that the perovskite films do not precipitate PbI2, wherein the (110) diffraction peak corresponds to 14.35°, the (220) diffraction peak corresponds to 28.5°, and the (310) diffraction peak corresponds to 31.89°. As the speed of PC61BM increased, the peak intensities of (110) and (310) increased continuously. At 2000 rpm, the peak intensities of (110) and (310) were the highest, and the crystal quality of the perovskite crystals was the best. In addition, the perovskite films at different PC61BM speeds were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The compact and homogeneous perovskite layers are illustrated in Fig. S2a† and it is obvious that the grains gradually grew from 334 nm to 420 nm (average value) with the increased speeds of PC61BM (Fig. S2b†). However, when the speed of PC61BM exceeded 2000 rpm, unexpected pin holes and precipitates randomly appeared, indicating the undesired perovskite morphology with a thin PC61BM layer.

(b) Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra, (c) steady-state photoluminescence spectra, (d) normalized time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite films and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite films. 
In order to explore the effect of temperature on the composition of PC61BM during the heating process, thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S3a†) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the PC61BM powder under different conditions (Fig. S3b†) were carried out. The abscissa axis represents the temperature of heating, and the ordinate axis represents the mass of the sample. When the heating temperature was lower than 387 °C, the quality of the sample hardly changed. When the heating temperature was higher than 387 °C, the quality of the sample began to decrease. However, C-PSCs were prepared at a low temperature and the temperature was less than 100 °C. In order to test whether the decomposition of the PC61BM powder occurs at 100 °C, three kinds of PC61BM powders with different treatment methods were tested by XRD. The treatment methods of the PC61BM powers were as follows: the PC61BM powders were heated at room temperature, at 100 °C and 400 °C. The XRD spectra of the PC61BM powder in the three states showed that the crystal structure did not change during the preparation of the devices. In addition to the effects of temperature, we observed that the PC61BM solution is a dark brown translucent liquid, which may have a certain influence on the optical transmittance of the sample; thus, optical transmittance spectra were obtained. Fig. S4† shows the optical transmittance spectrum of the PC61BM film (∼30 nm) deposited on the FTO/c-TiO2 substrate. The FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM film demonstrated the transmittance slightly less than bare FTO and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 films from 360 to 800 nm, which had no obvious effect on the performance of the PSCs fabricated with PC61BM in the later research.
To further investigate the impact of PC61BM on C-PSCs, a series of photoelectric performance tests were carried out. Here, the speed of the preparation of the PC61BM thin film was 2000 rpm (∼30 nm). Fig. 3b shows the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite films and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite films. The results showed that a compact and homogeneous perovskite film with PC61BM was obtained; thus, its ultraviolet absorption intensity was relatively strong. The charge dynamics of the different structures of PSCs were investigated by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The steady-state PL spectra are shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth noting that the PL quenching efficiency of PC61BM was higher than that of m-TiO2, indicating higher electron-transfer efficiency from the perovskite to PC61BM. In addition, time-resolved PL (TRPL) was measured by monitoring the laser wavelength at λ = 470 nm and the peak emission at 770 nm, as shown in Fig. 3d, and the decay parameters were obtained using a biexponential decay model function as below: (1)
Here, the specific fitting time parameters are shown in Table S1;†τ1 and τ2 are the shorter decay component and the longer decay component, respectively. The shorter decay component is associated with charge transfer from the perovskite to the electron-transfer layer quencher and non-radiative charge recombination within the perovskite layer, and the longer decay component can be attributed to the radiation recombination of the trapped charge. The TRPL fitting parameters of the perovskite-containing m-TiO2 layer were A1 = 9.77, τ1 = 22 ns, A2 = 90.23, τ2 = 81 ns, average carrier lifetime = A1 × τ1 + A2 × τ2 = 75 ns. The TRPL fitting parameters of the perovskite of the PC61BM layer were A1 = 0.54, τ1 = 20.420 ns, A2 = 0.46, τ2 = 102.07 ns, and the average carrier lifetime = A1 × τ1 + A2 × τ2 = 58 ns. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy showed that the lifetime of the average carrier was reduced from 75 ns to 58 ns with the PC61BM layer, indicating that the perovskite/PC61BM layer has higher electron-transfer efficiency and slower charge recombination, which are conducive to enhancing both Jsc and FF.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best PSCs with c-TiO2, c-TiO2/m-TiO2, or c-TiO2/PC61BM as the ETLs under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. It is apparent that the device with c-TiO2 or c-TiO2/m-TiO2 as the ETLs displays a low open-circuit voltage; however, when c-TiO2/PC61BM was used as the ETL of the device, the electron-extraction efficiency of the PSC was higher, and the Voc value of the best PSC was up to 1.005 V. The detailed performance parameters of the best PSCs are shown in Table 1; the PSCs with c-TiO2 as the ETL showed the best PCE of 8.67% with Jsc = 19.03 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.93 V, and FF = 49%. The devices with c-TiO2/m-TiO2 as the ETL showed the best PCE of 13.88% with Jsc = 24.35 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V, and FF = 58.16% because m-TiO2 played an important role in transporting electrons and assisting in perovskite formation. The PSCs fabricated with c-TiO2/PC61BM showed the highest PCE of 14.37% in the planar carbon-based PSCs with Jsc = 25 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.005 V, and FF = 57.2%, representing a significant 3.5% increase in PCE over that of the c-TiO2/m-TiO2-based cell. The PCE increase can be primarily attributed to the increase in the open circuit voltage. It should be noted that normally, the FF of carbon-based PSCs is below 0.7 due to the poor contact at the perovskite/carbon interface with numerous gaps.27

Here, 20 individual devices of each condition were statistically measured (Fig. S5a–d and Table S2†). After comparing two samples (with PC61BM and with m-TiO2), the reliability of the key J–V parameters’ (Voc and PCE) change distribution of the two sample sets could be recognized. The PCE values of the two sample sets were mainly scattered in the range of 12.35 ± 1.53% and 13 ± 1.37% and the Voc values of the two types were mainly scattered in the range of 0.94 ± 0.04 and 0.98 ± 0.03. Clearly, the PC61BM-based devices exhibited the narrowest distribution among them, indicating the highest reproducibility and the highest performance of the devices.
In order to understand the main factors determining the performance of the PSCs, all the factors involving Voc and Jsc affecting the properties are discussed. The optimized Jsc could be certified by the dark J–V characteristics, as shown in Fig. 4b. A decrease in the saturation current density from J0 = 1.01 × 10−5 A cm−2 of the pristine material-based device to J0 = 7.75 × 10−6 A cm−2 of the PC61BM-based device could be seen, indicating that a lower charge recombination and a higher shunt resistance of the PC61BM-based device were obtained. This result is consistent with the increase in the current density (Jsc) of PSC. The open circuit voltage (Voc) can be estimated from J0 according to Voc = Aln(Jph/J0 + 1)(2)where Voc increases with the decrease in J0. It can also be concluded that with the introduction of the PC61BM layer, the open circuit voltage of the perovskite solar cell increased to 1.005 V.

(d) Steady-state photocurrent of the FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon cell structure under 0.705 V bias voltage. (e) Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the device with a perovskite layer fabricated under various conditions. 
The Voc value of planar C-PSCs increased from 0.98 to 1.005 V. In order to deeply investigate the origin of the optimized Voc, a Mott–Schottky study was performed under dark (Fig. 3d), where 1/C2 and its relationship with V can be described as follows: (3)
Here, C is the measured capacitance in the dark, Vbi is the built-in potential, and V is the applied bias; A, N, q, ε, and ε0 are the active area, concentration of the donor-dopant, elementary charge, relative permittivity, and permittivity of free space, respectively. The intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot is Vbi, corresponding to 0.87 V (c-TiO2/m-TiO2) and 0.91 V (c-TiO2/PC61BM), as shown in Fig. 4c. It shows a similar trend with Voc from the J–V measurements obtained under one sunlight illumination. The higher Vbi value of the c-TiO2/PC61BM sample should be associated with the lower charge recombination ascribed to the high-quality perovskite film.
The steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power is used to evaluate the efficiency of perovskite solar cells at a constant voltage bias.27 In order to explore the stability of a perovskite solar cell with a planar structure (c-TiO2/PC61BM as the electron-transport layer), the stability properties of the current density and cell efficiency at a bias voltage of 0.705 V were tested. As shown in Fig. 4d, the device we designed has steady-state efficiency of 13.35% and steady-state current density of 18.93 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 0.705 V.
The changes in the Jsc values were also verified through the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 4e). The integrated photocurrent values from the IPCE spectra for the devices with a mesoporous structure (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/PVSK/carbon) and planar structure (FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon) were 23.75 and 24.1 mA cm−2, respectively, which were slightly lower than the Jsc values extracted from the J–V curves (Fig. 4a). The lower current density from the IPCE measurement than that from the J–V scan was probably due to the dependence of Jsc on light intensity, which was derived from the trap state in the electron-transport layer.39 IPCE spectra were measured under a monochromic light without bias light, resulting in lower carrier density and lower filling level of the trap state than that under one sun illumination for the J–V measurements.
The introduction of PC61BM showed the highest Jsc value, followed by the devices consisting of c-TiO2/PVSK and c-TiO2/m-TiO2/PVSK, which coincided with our PL analysis results (as discussed above). The Jsc value after PC61BM introduction improved through the accelerated electron extraction and improved crystallization quality of the perovskites because PCBM is a good electron-transport material and also acts as an additive to enhance the crystal quality of the perovskites. From our previous research,36 the Jsc value of the prepared mesoporous C-PSC was found to be lower than that of planar C-PSC, which shows that the preparation method is the most reasonable method. Jaehoon Ryu et al.29 enhanced the performance of paintable carbon-based PSCs using a modified solvent dripping method that involved dripping the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CNTs acted as pathways for fast hole extraction to the carbon electrode, boosting the Jsc value (18.97 mA cm−2) of the devices. A carbon-based planar PSC with the PCE of 15.38% (ref. 27) was fabricated using C60 as the electron-transport layer, but Jsc was 23.44 mA cm−2, which was lower than that of the planar PSC fabricated in this paper. Therefore, due to the advantages of low cost and an easy fabrication process together with considerable stability and efficiency, our study provides a universal strategy for encouraging the commercialization and improving the performance of PSCs.
Finally, we investigated the humidity stability of the full cells without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 5, the photovoltaic performance of C-PSCs based on c-TiO2/PC61BM and c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ETLs is measured without encapsulation under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 30–40% at room temperature. It can be seen from the efficiency diagram that the efficiency stability of the two cells is almost the same. Under the same conditions for 80 days (∼1900 h), the PCE values of the planar structure and mesoporous structure C-PSCs retained 97% and 96% of the initial values, respectively. Both C-PSCs had excellent stability over other previously reported devices, while the PC61BM-based C-PSCs possessed slightly better stability. This may result from PC61BM, leading to lower crystal traps during the perovskite growth process and reduction in the charge recombination at the interface with the perovskites.

Conclusion
In summary, we successfully demonstrated a high-performance carbon-based HTM-free perovskite solar cell by using c-TiO2/PC61BM as the ETL with the device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon. We observed that PC61BM could effectively accelerate the electron-extraction efficiency and reduce the charge recombination at the interface with the perovskites. At the same time, it also acted as an additive to improve the crystal quality of the perovskites. As a result of these advances, carbon-based perovskite solar cells fabricated with PC61BM achieved the PCE value of 14.37%; moreover, Voc reached 1.005 V (>1 V), which is rarely reported for C-PSCs. Moreover, the introduction of the PC61BM layer improved the stability of C-PSCs, and they could be stored in the dark at room temperature and at a humidity of 30–40% for 80 days (∼1900 h). The PCE value of planar C-PSCs retained 97% of its initial value. The FTO/c-TiO2/PC61BM/perovskite/carbon planar carbon-based perovskite solar cell has a better performance and higher stability, which can further promote the commercial development of carbon-based perovskite solar cells.

Perovskite precursor solution: PbI2 and CH3NH3I (molar ratio 1:1) were dissolved in 1 ml of solution (DMF:DMSO volume ratio of 9:1) to form a 1.4 M precursor solution. Next, 5 mg of anhydrous ammonium acetate crystals were dissolved in 4 ml of DMF solution.
PC61BM solution: 10 mg of PC61BM was dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene and stirred magnetically until the solution finally appeared as a dark brown red translucent solution.
Device fabrication
The specific preparation steps based on the c-TiO2/PC61BM planar carbon-based perovskite solar cell are as follows:
Fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glasses (TEC-15, NSG, FTO) were ultrasonically washed with detergent, deionized (DI) water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol for 30 minutes successively. Titanium dioxide precursor solution (the volume ratio of titanium diisopropoxyacetate to ethanol solution is 1:20) was spin-coated on the FTO conductive glass at a rate of 2000 rpm for 60 s. After drying at 100 °C, the film was heated at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 30 μL of the PC61BM precursor solution was dropped on the dense titanium dioxide sample and spin-coated at 1000 rpm, 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, and 4000 rpm, and then dried at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the PC61BM substrate by using a one-step spin-coating method. Briefly, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the PC61BM substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds and 150 μl of chlorobenzene was rapidly dripped on the rotating substrate 7 seconds after the spin-procedure was started. Then, the film was heated at 100 °C for 30 minutes in order to acquire a dense perovskite film. Finally, a commercial conductive carbon paste (Shenzhen Dongdalai Chemical Co, Ltd) was applied to the prepared samples by screen printing.
Characterization
The illuminated current–voltage characteristics (J–V) of the perovskite solar cell were measured under illumination and dark conditions using an electrochemical workstation (Solartron SI1287/SI 1260). The exact solar illumination was determined using a standard Si solar cell. Current–voltage curves were measured by masking the cells with a mask of 0.06 cm2 to define the accurate area under Air Mass 1.5 Global simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The surface morphologies of the samples were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM FEI QUANTA 3D FESEM). The crystallinity of the MAPbI3 perovskite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku DMAX-RB equipped with Cu Kα X-ray radiation source). The UV–visible absorption spectra and the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of MAPbI3 films with PCBM were measured using a UV–vis–near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-2800 122-0003) and a PL microscopic spectrometer (Flex One, Zolix, China). The time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured by Edinburgh Instruments (FLS980) at 770 nm with an excitation wavelength of 477 nm.
