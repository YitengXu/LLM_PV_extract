    , Accepted 4th December 2019First published on 4th December 2019AbstractA systematic approach for assessing organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials for large scale production based on the efficiency, lifetime and cost has been developed. These parameters have been combined to establish a figure of merit, Ω, which determines the suitability of OPV materials for real-world large-scale implementation. As a case study, small scale device efficiency optimization, lifetime measurements and cost analysis of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM systems was undertaken. The figure of merit developed through these case studies is also shown to be suitable for broader assessment of all materials incorporated into manufacturing of OPV technology. Despite the relatively large differences in optimized small scale device efficiency P3HT:PCBM was, with an Ω value of $8.3 per m2 per %, calculated as the most cost effective material system tested herein. This work demonstrates that small scale device efficiency alone is not a good proxy for the suitability of OPV material systems for large scale manufacturing and that the cost effectiveness figure of merit provides the more nuanced approach that is required.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are widely recognised as one of the most promising new technologies for the delivery of widespread sustainable energy generation due to their ability to be printed at large scale and at low cost.1–3 Historically, substantial scientific effort has been expended developing new donor and acceptor materials that deliver ever higher power conversion efficiencies and, more recently, improved stability.4–6 However, it is increasingly understood that any assessment of the commercial viability of new OPV materials must also take into account their cost of manufacture.7 Indeed, performance, stability and cost form a triplet of parameters that actually determine whether or not a given donor–acceptor material system is worthwhile assessing for large-scale OPV fabrication.1,8
Material performance (as measured by power conversion efficiency or PCE) directly correlates with the total amount of energy produced by, and the surface area required for, the printed solar cell. Optimization of device structure is complex, since multiple factors, such as layer composition, layer thicknesses, material choice and deposition technique all influence device output. The PCEs of OPV devices have in recent years increased rapidly for small scale devices; reaching an efficiency of 16.4% as a result of the improvements in active layer material engineering.9 Although these high PCEs increase the total amount of electricity produced by the OPV, these highly efficient materials are generally complex to synthesise, which increases the cost of the materials significantly, given that the average cost per step of synthesis has been previously estimated to be of the order of $40 per gram.10
Material stability describes the rate at which material performance decays and thus also plays a role in determining the total amount of energy produced by the printed OPV. In general, the time dependence of OPV device performance consists of two distinct phases: (a) an exponential decrease in performance during the initial period of operation (known as “burn-in”),11 and (b) a much slower linear decrease in performance occurring after the burn-in phase.12 Although a significant amount of work has been conducted on the subject of material stability, it has generally focussed on only a few material systems such as P3HT:PCBM and PCPDTBT:PCBM.13,14 Moreover, applying stability studies conducted on one material system to another is complicated by the fact that many aspects of material stability, such as phase separation15 and photo-bleaching, are highly material dependent.16,17 Thus, specific material stability studies are needed to fully assess a given material's suitability for large-scale OPV fabrication.
Material cost is perhaps the most important and yet most neglected of the triplet of parameters that determine the viability of a given material system for large scale manufacture. Although the majority of papers claim the potential of low-cost manufacturing for OPV technology, very few papers have been published with a focus on the cost of the materials and consequent levelised cost of electricity.18–21
All three parameters have been investigated separately for many new donor and acceptor materials with the vast majority of the studies focussed on material performance followed by material stability with only a handful of papers focussed on material cost. It is even rarer to find publications undertaking a complete assessment of new materials encompassing all three parameters.21 This lack of a holistic approach to OPV materials characterisation and assessment is clearly a challenge for the large-scale roll-out of OPV technology as there is generally a trade-off between the three parameters.22 For example, the most common donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is low-cost and relatively stable but exhibits low to medium material performance (PCEs of around 3–4%) when combined with phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PCBM).23–25 By contrast, active layer donor–acceptor materials systems such as the benzodithiophene co-polymer, PM6 and 2,7-bis(3-dicyanomethylene-2Z-methylene-indan-1-one)-4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-ndaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (IDIC) system exhibit much higher efficiencies (11.9%) but are much more complex to synthesise (and therefore their material cost is higher) while their photochemical and device stability remain unknown.26 Determining the full commercialization potential of these new materials is therefore challenging without a complete picture of their performance, stability and cost.
In this paper, we present a new figure of merit, which can be employed for evaluating the suitability of different materials systems for implementation at large-scale manufacture and commercialisation. The figure of merit is applicable to all materials included in the OPV manufacturing process, including encapsulation material (barrier and adhesive), electrodes, interface layer and active layer. We demonstrate how to apply this figure of merit by examining the commercialization potential of the most well-characterised donor polymer in this field (P3HT) with three different acceptor materials: (a) a non-fullerene acceptor (SF(DPPB)4), (b) a newly developed low cost indene-fullerene based acceptor (ICxA) and (c) a benchmark fullerene acceptor (PCBM), based on a holistic study of their performance, stability and cost. Material performance is evaluated and optimised as a function of casting solvent of electron transport layer (zinc oxide) and active layer thickness. Material stability is evaluated under both ISOS-L-2 and ISOS-D-2 conditions. Finally, the material cost of all three materials systems is determined based on published synthesis procedures.
Results and discussion
To assist the transformation of OPV from a laboratory scale technology to an industry scale technology, new materials have to be adapted from small to large scale device manufacturing. Through the past decade an astonishing amount of novel materials have been developed but only an exceptionally small number of materials have successfully been transferred to large scale device manufacturing. A potential reason for this discrepancy may be the difference in deposition techniques on the large scale compared to those employed on the small scale. This is a difficult problem to overcome as the upscale from spin-coating and evaporation to pilot-scale R2R manufacturing requires a substantial financial investment. However, the process of evaluating materials that are suitable for upscaling from promising results on the laboratory scale does have the potential to be streamlined significantly. Here we propose a new cost effectiveness figure of merit (Ω), which is shown to be an effective tool to ease the transfer from small to large scale manufacture. The figure of merit is calculated as: (1)where Cmod is the specific module cost ($ per m2) at large scale. ηbi is the device efficiency after burn-in of a device prepared with materials and layer thicknesses suitable for upscaling i.e. devices prepared with solution-processed interlayers such as ZnO instead of Ca, LiF or PFN. We also restrict the active layer to a minimum thickness of 150 nm,26 as this is smallest active layer thickness published for any fully R2R prepared devices. m is the gradient of a linear fit to the degradation in efficiency with time after the burn-in period (per day). The introduction of the factor of 277 reflects the number of average full sunshine (1000 W m−2) irradiation days that occurs in Europe (Paris) over a 4 year period (1662 h per year).27 We have selected this value as a minimum stability requirement that must be fulfilled in order to commercialize OPV technology, indicative of devices requiring a Ts80 lifetime of at least 0.8 years under constant illumination testing in the laboratory this is equivalent to an m value of −0.00361 or higher.
The major advantage of this proposed figure of merit over previously proposed figures of merit28,29 is the ability to apply the assessment to all materials utilized for OPV fabrication. Previous figures of merit, whilst useful, only focus on the active layer materials which make up a small fraction of the overall material input for an OPV module. Another variation is that we introduce cost as a factor through a holistic module cost parameter, whereas previous figures of merit have been focusing on implementing cost considerations through the synthetic complexity of materials synthesis. This latter approach does offer the advantage that only the route of synthesis (i.e. number of steps, purification, overall yield etc.) is required, which is easily accessible from small scale laboratory work, the major disadvantage of synthetic complexity as a “cost-parameter” is that it entirely neglects the overall costs in the grander scheme of OPV production, that is, it does not consider costs for electrode materials, interlayer materials, barrier materials and sealants, which represent a major part of the overall module costs under current fabrication procedures. Furthermore, the calculation method of synthetic complexity30 does to some degree overlook the input costs for the raw materials as it does not discriminate between the complexity of the “starting” materials (for example a benzene and a benzothiadiazole reactant are costed equally despite not having the same materials cost). A final issue with the calculation of synthetic complexity is the fact that it is a normalized value, so the synthetic complexity of compound can be artificially reduced by comparing its synthetic procedure to a much more complicated molecule with increased number of synthetic steps, lower yield and increased number of column purification steps. This has the unintended effect that almost all current materials could be capable of fulfilling existing figure of merit assessments for commercialization simply comparison against a benchmark material with a high enough complexity. We believe that the introduction of a new parameter which considers the total costs of a complete OPV module will eliminate these disadvantages.
In order to determine the level for a suitable Ω value, the point at which the levelized cost of electricity produced by an OPV module would be equivalent with rooftop silicon-based PV was determined. Previous calculations and simulations conducted on this topic reveals that an efficiency of 3%, a lifetime of 3 years (m = −0.000963) and a module cost of 7.85 $ per m2 is required (of which, 5.6 $ per m2 was materials cost).1,8 Implanting these values into the equation for the figure of merit results in an Ω value of 2.55 $ per m2 per %. This value therefore becomes the upper limit at which of commercially competitive OPV would be a reality. Negative Ω values are to be disregarded as they are a consequence of the devices not fulfilling the stability requirements of the figure of merit.  
To put the Ω value of 2.55 $ per m2 per % into perspective, the maximum Cmod was calculated for potential devices with a broad range of device efficiencies and device lifetime as presented in Table 1. The Cmod values vary from 0.51 $ per m2 to 35.13 $ per m2 depending on the device efficiency (varied from 1% to 15%) and lifetime (varied from 1 year to 10 years). Since these values can influence the figure of merit so strongly, we will now consider the relative influence of each parameter individually.

Device efficiency
In order to transition the device architecture from a previously reported optimized small scale design to a R2R fabricated structure two major changes were made: (1) the ETL was changed from PFN to ZnO and (2) the active layer thickness was increased from 80 nm to 150 nm. These changes were driven by the fact that PFN is vulnerable to damage during the deposition of the R2R sputter coated cathode (whereas ZnO has been shown to be stable during sputter coating25) and active layer thicknesses of ∼150 nm are required to minimize printing defects.25
As a consequence of these required changes, an optimisation of device performance was undertaken using ZnO as the ETL. Initially, the ETL thickness and casting solvent were varied for P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 spin coated devices fabricated at Zhejiang University using an active layer thickness of 80 nm; consistent with the previously optimized architecture.31,32 The results in Table 1 show that the EtOH is the optimal solvent for the ZnO ETL and that the performance of the resultant optimized P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices (η = 5.67%) do not differ significantly from those using PFN as the ETL (η = 5.82%).
Subsequently, P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM devices were spin-coated with the optimized conditions for ETL thickness and casting solvent at Newcastle University using an active layer thickness of 150 nm. Table 3 summarises the performance of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 (η = 3.00%), P3HT:ICxA (η = 2.92%) and P3HT:PCBM (η = 2.82%) spin coated devices using an active layer thickness of 150 nm. The data reveals that there is no statistically significant difference in the power conversion efficiencies of all three architectures when fabricated with a thickness of 150 nm. In particular, the higher VOC observed for the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices relative to the P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM devices is countered by correspondingly lower JSC and FF values. Thus, under the device architectures that are relevant for R2R manufacturing, performance benchmarking of the three acceptor molecules suggests that from a device efficiency viewpoint they are effectively equivalent.

Device stability

Light degradation. 
OPVs are typically observed to degrade quickly during the first few days of prolonged exposure to light. This initial period of fast degradation is known as the burn-in stage and is defined by an exponential decay in efficiency, after which the degradation rate usually stabilizes and becomes linear. Degradation pathways can therefore be divided into two main categories. Firstly, the intrinsic degradation which dominates during the burn-in period and is caused by rapid internal changes in the device due to morphology or interface instability. Secondly, the extrinsic degradation which dominates over longer time scales and is triggered by external causes such as water or oxygen.33
Degradation studies under ISOS-L-2 conditions were carried out for devices with active layers consisting of P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM. The I–V curve as a function of time and the normalized degradation curves for all three types of devices can be seen in Fig. 1. The curves are normalized to the initial value at the start of the degradation process. Each data point represents the average of six devices from two different substrates for each material (P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM). From the normalised PCE graphs it is clear that the active layer material has a strong impact on the burn-in response, with the time for burn-in varying from 3 to 7 days.
 Fig. 1

The decay in electrical parameters (PCE, VOC, JSC and FF) of OPV devices P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 (blue), P3HT:ICxA (orange) and P3HT:PCBM (green) over 15 days of continuous testing (bottom figures) under ISOS-L2 conditions. 
Devices prepared with P3HT:PCBM finish the burn-in degradation phase after only two days, during which they lose an average of 17% of their original efficiency due to decreases in VOC and FF, whereas the JSC is remarkably stable. After the burn-in, the FF remains stable whereas the VOC slowly increases back to is initial value, which leads to a slight increase in overall device efficiency. Devices prepared with P3HT:ICxA finish the burn-in degradation phase after four days, during which they have lost close to 40% of their initial efficiency primarily due to decreases in VOC and FF, but also a minor decrease in JSC. After the four days, the overall efficiency stabilises with a slight increase in VOC being counteracted by a slight decrease in FF. The burn-in degradation phase for P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices is extended to eight days, the longest observed in this degradation study. During this phase the devices lose 38% of initial efficiency, primarily due to losses in VOC and JSC (23% and 14%, respectively). After eight days these devices stabilize, with an efficiency just above the efficiency of the P3HT:ICxA devices.
These degradation results suggest that devices with P3HT:PCBM are the most stable of the three types of active layers under constant illumination, due to an overall reduced efficiency loss during the burn-in phase. After the burn-in all device types appear to be reasonable stable.


Thermal ageing. 
To further investigate the factors which influence degradation, ISOS-D-2 studies were conducted on devices. These studies store devices in the dark when they are not being actively tested, and thus promote a thermal stimulus as the major degradation mechanism. Consequently, a comparison of D-2 and L-2 degradation behaviour can reveal whether the degradation phenomena observed in the ISOS-L-2 study is due to light or heat. The ISOS-D-2 ageing studies were carried out inside the light housing box by keeping the OPV devices under cover on a hotplate at 65 °C for 15 days, in accordance with the protocols.34 The resulting PCE drops were around 40% and 18% for P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICxA devices, respectively, whilst the PCE for P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices exhibited an 8% increase as shown in Fig. 2. The decreases in PCE for the P3HT:PCBM devices were predominately caused by drops in VOC and FF, features which are not present during the ISOS-L-2 study. This would indicate that the increase observed in VOC for P3HT:PCBM devices in the ISOS L-2 study is a light-induced effect. P3HT:ICxA devices drop 40% under ISOS-L-2 conditions which is 20% more than under ISOS-D-2 condition, this extra degradation is due to an enhanced drop in FF as JSC and VOC degrade at similar magnitudes to those observed in the L-2 studies in Fig. 3. These similar values would indicate that the drop in JSC and VOC in the L-2 conditions is light dominated for P3HT:ICxA. Devices prepared with P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 behave quite differently under ISOS-L-2 and ISOS-D-2 conditions, with efficiency changes of −40% and +8%, respectively. This result clearly indicates that the degradation of these devices during ISOS-L-2 is caused by light and not heat.

How to determine the duration of the burn-in and gradient of the continuous degradation stage after the burn-in. 
As described in the literature, OPV degradation usually consists of two distinct regions. These consist of an initial exponential decay known as the “burn-in,” which is followed by a relatively linear decay in efficiency. Determining the exact point where the change between burn-in and the stabilised long-term degradation occurs can be troublesome. In this work, the end of burn-in was determined by the addition of a linear trendline to a section of the degradation curve well after the burn-in had ended. The section where to the trendline is fitted is marked as the green line in Fig. 3. The trendline was then extrapolated until the degradation curve is continuously above the trendline and the point where this separation initially occurs was identified. The corresponding device efficiencies are presented in the table in Fig. 3, along with the gradient of trendline to the linear degradation. The gradient of the trendline for P3HT:PCBM is positive whereas it is negative for both P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 and P3HT:ICxA meaning that P3HT:PCBM actually increases in device efficiency as a function of illumination time after the initial burn-in drop.

Device cost

Costing of SF(DPPB)4. 
The calculation of the cost of SF(DPPB)4 was based on the synthesis of 100 g of product. This costing was developed using the published synthetic route,31,35 with prices sourced from a range of venders as specified in ESI.† The full list of reaction and purification components, amounts needed, and their cost can be seen in Table S1 in ESI.† The estimated total cost of SF(DPPB)4 was found to be $64.19 per g (at a 100 g of product scale) divided into a cost of $24.08 per g for chemicals and materials involved in the reaction and a cost of $40.11 per g for materials and chemicals consumed during workup/purification. The cost of the other acceptors used in this work have previously been reported to be $17 per g and $71.61 per g for the synthesis of ICxA and PCBM on 100 g batch scales, respectively (Table S2†).21
To fully assess whether these price differences have a significant impact on the cost of the completed OPV the material price per m2 of fabricated OPV prepared with the geometry Ag/PH1000/Active layer/ZnO/Al was calculated. The full device structure requires: (i) a substrate layer on the front and back sides (corresponding to 200% of the module area), (ii) an UV-epoxy layer that is sleeve coated across the entire substrate width (corresponding to 100% of the module area), (iii) a silver electrode printed in a grid pattern (corresponding to 20% of the module area), (iv) an active layer and two interface layers (corresponding to 75% of the module area for each layer) and (v) an aluminum electrode that is deposited through a shadow mask (corresponding to 100% of the module area). These usage values were combined with the individual costs to obtain a price per m2 for each material as seen in Table 4. Standard optimum ratios from literature (which also are the ratios used for the preparation of the devices herein) have been used for the active layers. From Table 4 it can be seen that the cost per m2 of OPV module based on the different acceptor units are quite similar and demonstrate the following trend: P3HT:ICxA < P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 < P3HT:PCBM with a cost of $27.54, $28.73 and $29.52, respectively. Interestingly, although the cost of acceptor materials varies 3 to 4 fold from ICxA to SF(DPPB)4 and PCBM, the price difference per m2 of OPV module differs by less than 10% as the bulk of the material costs are to be found in the encapsulation materials, particularly the water and oxygen barrier (and to some extent PEDOT:PSS), whereas the active layer has a significantly lesser impact at current costs (Table 4).

These calculations reveal that two of the material combinations (P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 and P3HT:ICxA) were too unstable fulfil the stability parameter of this figure of merit which disqualifies them as potential material combinations. The only material combination to fulfil the stability parameter is P3HT:PCBM and thereby result in a positive Ω value of 8.30 $ per m2 per % as seen in Table 2. As reported multiple times P3HT:PCBM, despite for many years being the material pair of choice for large scale OPV fabrication, does not have the potential for commercialization of OSC.
These results highlight the fact that despite the relatively high efficiency for optimized P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 OPV small-scale devices, when this material blend is fabricated in the thicker active layer architectures required for printing its cost effectiveness is below par compared P3HT:PCBM, whereas also the cheaper active layer option of P3HT:ICxA is being clearly outperformed. Indeed, this study demonstrates that simply using optimized small-scale device efficiencies as an indicator of material suitability for large scale production is problematic and that efficiency, lifetime and cost (in the context of the relevant printed structure) must all be considered.
Conclusions
Assessing the best material system for large scale OPV production based on small-scale spin-coated devices is complicated and requires a sophisticated approach that goes beyond simply determining optimal device efficiency. In this paper it is argued that efficiency, lifetime and cost (in the context of the relevant printed structure) must all be considered in any comparative assessment of different material systems.
In order to illustrate this general approach, small scale device optimization of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM systems in a new stack geometry was undertaken and although average efficiencies of 5.67, 2.97 and 2.82% were obtained for P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM, respectively, the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 efficiency dropped to 3.00% for active layer thicknesses currently achievable in R2R printing.
Degradation studies under both ISOS-L-2 and ISOS-D-2 conditions revealed that the ISOS-L-2 standard provided the most relevant degradation conditions; delivering device burn-in losses in the order P3HT:PCBM > P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 > P3HT:ICxA with a decrease during the initial burn-in phase of 17, 38 and 40%, respectively. Whereas the long term linear degradation had the order of P3HT:PCBM > P3HT:ICxA > P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 with gradient values of 0.0025, −0.0049 and −0.0087, respectively.
Consequently, the new cost effectiveness figure of merit, Ω, was calculated; demonstrating that P3HT:PCBM, with a Ω value of 8.30 $ per m2 per %, was the more superior material choice of the three in question although still far away from the required 2.55 $ per m2 per %. This approach provides a pathway for the determining the actual suitability of novel material blend systems for large-scale implementation; highlighting the importance of taking into account the three critical parameters of efficiency, lifetime and cost in the context of relevant device architectures.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents and materials were used without further purification unless otherwise specified. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus (Clevios P VP Al 4083). Patterned ITO slides (<15 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd., China. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of estimated molecular weight of 20 kDA and ICxA (a mixture of indene-C60 mono, bis and tris-adducts) were synthesised at the Centre for Organic Electronics, University of Newcastle, Australia, according to reported procedures.21 Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were prepared according to the literature.26 SF(DPPB)4 (consisting of a spirobifluorene core with four benzene end capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) arms) was synthesised at Zhejiang University according to the literature.31
Cost calculations
The cost per gram calculations for the acceptors SF(DPPB)4 and PCBM were based on the published procedures for SF(DPPB)4 (ref. 31) and the synthesis of its reagents35–38 and PCBM,39 that have been upscaled to 100 g of final product. Estimations of the volumes of workup solvents and silica for the synthesis of both acceptors were based on a published method.10
Device fabrication and characterisation

University of Newcastle. 
Three types of devices were fabricated with P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA, and P3HT:PCBM as BHJ active layers. The devices were prepared with a standard geometry and fabricated with architectural structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ active layer/ZnO/Al.
Patterned ITO-glass substrates were cleaned by rinsing in a sequence of solvents: water, IPA, and acetone with 5 min of sonication for each solvent. Slides were subsequently treated with UV light and ozone for 20 minutes. A PEDOT:PSS solution was filtered with an 0.45 μm pore size filter and then spin-coated onto the ITO substrates in ambient atmosphere. After drying at 150 °C for 20 minutes, uniform films of 35 ± 5 nm were obtained. The PETOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates were transferred into a glovebox with 5 ppm moisture and 5 ppm oxygen for active layer deposition. Prior to deposition of active layers, the substrates were dried at 150 °C for 5 min and left to cool down at room temperature. For active layers, the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 solutions were prepared with a concentration of 15 mg mL−1 in chloroform and a donor:acceptor ratio of (2:1). Active layer solutions were sonicated for 30 min and then stirred at 35 °C for 60 min. In addition, both P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM solutions with a concentration of 36 mg mL−1 and ratio of (1:0.8) were blended in chlorobenzene by sonication for 60 min and stirring at 60 °C for 3 h. The P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 (150 ± 5 nm), P3HT:ICxA (105 ± 5 nm) and P3HT:PCBM (105 ± 5 nm) were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates, and dried at 60 °C for 5 min. ZnO nanoparticles with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 were made as suspensions in four solvents; methanol, ethanol, IPA, and acetone. The ZnO nanoparticle interlayers were spin-coated onto BHJ layers and pre-annealed at 140 °C for 4 min, and the thicknesses of ZnO ETLs were 16 ± 3 nm for (EtOH, IPA, and MeOH), and 29 ± 4 nm for acetone. The thermal deposition of Al electrodes were performed with thickness of a 100 nm under 1 × 10−6 Torr.
The devices were measured with a masked area of 3.8 mm2 and were initially tested under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glovebox. Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of a Newport Class AAA solar simulator with an AM 1.5 spectrum filter. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a silicon reference solar cell (FHG-ISE).


Zhejiang University. 
OPVs were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of ITO. Prior to fabrication, the substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol each consecutively for 15 min, and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min prior to spin-coating of 30 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P AI4083) at 3000 rpm. After baking the PEDOT:PSS layer in air at 150 °C for 15 min, the substrates were transferred to a glovebox. The active layer was spin-cast at 3000 rpm from a solution of P3HT and SF(DPPB)4 in chloroform with a donor to acceptor ratio of 2:1 in a concentration of 15 mg mL−1. Sample annealing was conducted at 130 °C for 10 min. Different electron transport layers (ETLs) were deposited as either poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) film from a solution of 0.4 mg mL−1 PFN in ethanol or ZnO deposited from a 10 mg mL−1 solution from either methanol, ethanol, IPA or acetone at various spin-coating speeds to vary thickness. Subsequently, the samples were loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure ≈ 5 × 10−4 Pa) to deposit 100 nm thick aluminium cathode with a shadow mask (the device area was 5.8 mm2).
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OPVs were measured with a Keithley 2400 measurement source unit at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2 and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic (PV) reference cell.

Stability measurements
The degradation conditions followed the ISOS-L-2 or ISOS-D-2 protocols.34 The devices were degraded in a custom-built thermally insulated light housing instrument at ambient humidity (R.H 4–5%). Illumination was provided using an LED based solar simulator of Class AAA spectral match, non-uniformity and temporal stability with classification values of 99.2%, 1.99%, and 0.13%, respectively. A mismatch factor of 1.01% for the organic solar cells was measured within the absorption spectrum range (350–800 nm). The temperature and the light intensity were monitored and maintained at 65 °C and 1000 W m−2, respectively. The full spectrum of the LED solar simulator is displayed in Fig. 4.
