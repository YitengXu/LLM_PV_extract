    , Accepted 11th February 2018First published on 12th February 2018AbstractOxygen defective yolk–shell BiO2−x spheres are successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal method for the first time. The variations between the diffusion rate of the core and the formation rate of the shell, which are caused by the temperature gradient originating from the heating rate, result in the formation of BiO2−x spheres with different interior structures. The as-synthesized yolk–shell BiO2−x spheres possess distinctive oxygen vacancies, which are demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectral analyses. The oxygen vacancies with a high affinity for molecular oxygen, and the enhanced light absorption ability resulting from the multiple reflections of the incident light within the interior voids, play key roles in the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation. Scavenger studies indicate that O2− and H2O2 are the major reactive species guaranteeing the prominent oxidation ability toward the bacterial cells. This study would not only provide direct evidence for the oxygen vacancy promoted photocatalytic bacterial inactivation, but also shed light on the design of highly efficient photocatalysts with intricate yolk–shell structures.
Introduction
In the last few decades, various methods ranging from metal (Au, Ag, Pt) doping,1–4 non-metal (C, N, S) doping,5–9 and p–n heterojunction construction,10,11 to facet engineering,12–14 were adopted to promote the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductors in energy conversion as well as environmental remediation. Such strategies indeed greatly enhanced the photoactivity of catalysts by either broadening their light responsive range, improving their light absorption ability, or suppressing the rapid recombination rate of photo-generated carriers. Recently, different from the concept of introducing extrinsic changes, persistent efforts have been focused on the newly emerged alternative approach – introducing intrinsic defects, such as oxygen vacancies, into the matrix of the semiconductor.15–22 Owing to the abundant localized electrons, oxygen vacancies have already been evidenced to act as efficient electron capture centres. Regardless of the demanding reduction potentials for N2/N2− (−4.2 V) and CO2/CO2− (−1.85 V), catalysts with oxygen vacancies can still activate O2, CO2 and N2 to O2−, CO2− and N2− effectively, leading to further oxidation or reduction of the targets.23–26 Hence, engineering the catalysts with optimal oxygen vacancies is of great significance. This unique methodology has already been widely applied to TiO2 materials among which the black TiO2−x is a typical semiconductor possessing intrinsic defects and exhibiting excellent performance toward hydrogen production,15 dye degradation,22 and lithium-ion batteries.17 However, disappointingly, as one of the promising visible light driven catalysts, bismuth oxides with oxygen deficient features were rarely reported. Therefore, the investigation of oxygen defective BiO2−x would help to expand the corresponding study to a deeper extent.
Moreover, considerable efforts have been devoted to studying the morphology dependent photocatalytic activities, as the morphology of the material would directly influence the activities in the ways of light utilization, electron transfer processes and interfacial reaction.27–32 Recently, Li et al. reported ultrathin sheet-like BiO2−x with good activity toward rhodamine B and phenol degradation due to its fascinating electron transfer properties.33 However, reports on BiO2−x with various morphologies are still quite limited, which inhibited the in-depth studies of its morphology dependent activities. Materials with yolk–shell structures are nowadays emerging as highly attractive candidates for photocatalysis, owing to their charming structural features and physicochemical properties.34–36 One of the most attractive merits is that yolk–shell structures endow the photocatalysts with increased light-harvesting ability because of the multiple reflections of the incident light within the interior cavities. Yolk–shell catalysts have been prepared for a wide variety of materials, including both binary and ternary compounds.37–40 For instance, Li et al. fabricated TiO2 with a sphere-in-sphere structure through a template-free solvothermal approach, and demonstrated that the significant improvement of the activity toward phenol degradation was exactly ascribed to the multiple reflections of the electromagnetic waves.41 But reports concerning the preparation of yolk–shell BiO2−x are quite rare. Successful fabrication of yolk–shell BiO2−x would inevitably promote studies concerning the relationship between activities and morphologies. Therefore, much effort should be made for the easy preparation of intricate yolk–shell BiO2−x and its morphology dependent photocatalytic efficiency.
Herein, oxygen deficient yolk–shell BiO2−x was prepared by adopting a facile solvothermal method. The heating rate played crucial roles in the formation of yolk–shell structures. The as-synthesized yolk–shell BiO2−x with distinctive oxygen vacancies displayed remarkable activity toward bacterial inactivation under visible light irradiation. Various scavengers for respective reactive species were adopted to systematically investigate the roles of these reactive species in the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation process. Besides, the significance of oxygen vacancies and the yolk–shell structure in photocatalytic bacterial inactivation were also determined in this study.
Experimental
Material synthesis
Yolk–shell BiO2−x hollow microspheres (YS-BO-MS) were prepared by a one-pot solvothermal reaction. Typically, 1.2 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added into a solution mixture containing 12 mL ethylene glycol and 24 mL acetone under vigorous stirring. The resulting transparent solution was transferred to a para polyphenylene based stainless steel autoclave for solvothermal treatment. Specifically, the solution was firstly heated up to 160 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, followed by heating at 160 °C for 5 h, and then cooled down to the room temperature with a cooling rate of 2 °C min−1. After the reaction, the precipitates were collected by filtering with a membrane filter (0.2 μm, Millipore), washing several times with deionized water and ethanol, and finally drying at 60 °C for 12 h. For comparison, additional samples were prepared by slightly changing the preparation conditions to investigate the formation mechanism of YS-BO-MS.
Characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a FEI Quanta 400 microscope, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a CM-120 microscope (Philips, 120 kV), and high-resolution TEM as well as high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM on a Philips Tecnai F20 instrument. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were recorded using both SEM-based and TEM-based EDX attachments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα source irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The specific surface area and pore size distribution were evaluated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed with JES FA200 equipment (Jeol, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and valence band XPS spectra were recorded using an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) X-ray sources. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed in air on a TGA 6 analyzer (Perkin Elmer, USA). The diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis) of the samples over a range of 200–800 nm were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 UV-vis system equipped with a Labsphere diffuse reflectance accessory. Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a FP-6500 fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photocurrents were measured in a three-electrode cell using a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Company, China). The working electrode was prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, which had been cleaned with absolute ethyl alcohol and deionized water. The as-prepared samples (5 mg) and 10 μL of Nafion solution were dispersed in a 1 mL water/isopropanol mixed solvent (3:1 v/v) by sonication to form a homogeneous catalyst colloid. Then 100 μL of the colloid was deposited onto FTO glasses with areas of ca. 1 cm2. The dried FTO glasses served as working electrodes and were immersed in a 0.05 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. A 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter was used as the light source. A Pt electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.
Photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli K-12
The Gram-negative bacterium, E. coli K-12, was chosen as the model bacterium in this study. Firstly, E. coli was cultured in 50 mL of nutrient broth (Lab M, Lancashire, U.K.) at 37 °C for 14 h under continuous oscillation with a shaking incubator. Secondly, 1 mL of the above mentioned bacterial solution was taken in a sterilized Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 11400 × g for 1 min. Finally, the cell pellet was washed twice with sterilized saline (0.9% NaCl) solution, and then re-suspended in 1 mL of sterilized saline solution as a spare. All glassware and equipment that would be used in the experiments were washed with deionized water, autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min and then dried for several hours in advance. The experimental procedures were as follows. Typically, a certain amount of the washed cell, the photocatalyst and 50 mL saline were added to a beaker to form the reaction mixture, and the initial cell density of the reaction mixture was adjusted to about 107 cfu mL−1 (cfu = colony forming unit). A Xenon lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 400 nm) was placed at the top of the reactor as the visible light source due to its safety and low cost. A stirrer was continuously used during the photocatalytic process to suspend the photocatalyst evenly in the bacterial solution for the better contact between the bacterium and the catalyst. And the reactor was linked to the water cooling system to control the temperature and keep it suitable for the survival of the cell. During the photocatalysis process, aliquots (typically, 1 mL) of the sample were collected at equal time intervals, and serially diluted with sterilized saline solution instantly. 0.1 mL of the diluted sample was immediately spread on the nutrient agar (Lab M, Lancashire, U.K.) plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to determine the survival number of cells (in cfu). For comparison, dark control (photocatalyst and bacterial cells without light), light control (bacterial cells and light without photocatalyst) and negative control (bacterial cells alone) were also included in the study. All treatments and control experiments were performed in triplicate.
Analysis of bacterial viability and detection of leaked potassium ions
The mixture of E. coli and the photocatalyst was collected at equal time intervals and stained with the dyes of the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (L7012, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. After incubation at 25 °C in the dark for 15 min, the samples were transferred to a slide covered with a coverslip and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE 80i, Japan) equipped with a filter block NUV-2A consisting of an excitation filter Ex 400–680 (Nikon, Japan) and a Spot-K slider CCD camera (Diagnostic instruments. Inc., USA). To investigate the K+ leakage from the bacterial cells during the photocatalytic inactivation process, the aliquots were collected and filtered through a Millipore filter (pore size of 0.45 μm). After filtration, the K+ concentration in the resulting clear solution was measured by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) (Hitachi Z-2300, Japan).
Results and discussion
The obtained products consisted of a high yield of yolk–shell hollow microspheres with an average size of ca. 3 μm (Fig. 1a and S1†). The inset SEM image of a broken microsphere and the TEM image (Fig. 1b) clearly revealed a unique yolk-like interior. XRD characterization (Fig. 1c) identified the crystalline structure of the as-prepared yolk–shell microsphere; all the peaks can be indexed to BiO2−x with JCPDS no. 47-1057. Notably, the XRD peaks were obviously broad, and the intensities were weak, probably because the microspheres were composed of tiny crystallite particles. Using Scherrer's equation based on the diffraction peak, the average crystallite size was estimated to be about 9 nm. The Raman spectra of the obtained samples are shown in Fig. S2,† the bands which appeared at 316.8 and 472.5 cm−1 are the characteristic bands of BiO2−x,33 further confirming the successful preparation of BiO2−x. As observed from the HAADF-STEM image of a broken shell (Fig. 1d), the shell appeared to be highly porous with a rough surface, derived from numerous aggregated nanosheets, which was consistent with the XRD observations. Such a porous yolk–shell structure will inevitably allow the multiple reflections of the incident light, which promotes the photocatalytic efficiency. From the representative HRTEM image (Fig. 1e), the diffraction stripes with various directions possessed an equal lattice spacing of 0.316 nm (Fig. 1f), corresponding to the (111) atomic planes of BiO2−x. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 1g) further confirmed that the shell was organized from dominant {111} facet exposed nanosheets. Surprisingly, cracks were found at some fringes (Fig. 1e), which might be an indication of the existence of defects. The apparent porous structure of the shells observed by SEM, TEM and STEM was confirmed by N2 adsorption analysis (Fig. S3†), which showed that the BET surface area of the yolk–shell BiO2−x microspheres (YS-BO-MS) is 15.85 m2 g−1. The surface area value is comparatively not that high, which may be ascribed to the micro size of the spheres. Fig. S3† shows that the YS-BO-MS had nitrogen adsorption isotherms with a combination of type II and type IV behaviour according to the IUPAC classification.42 As indicated by the shape of the N2 adsorption curves and the corresponding pore size distribution (inset of Fig. S3†), the as-prepared YS-BO-MS were hierarchically porous, containing micropores and mesopores, which could benefit photocatalytic reactions in promoting the utilization of the incident light. The EDX spectra, HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding elemental mapping images were collected to figure out the composition and the element distribution for both the core and shell of the yolk–shell BiO2−x. As shown in Fig. S4,† the EDX spectra of two typical spots respectively representing the core and shell (spot 1: core, spot 2: shell) were almost the same. The results do not only confirm the coexistence of Bi and O, but also indicate the homogeneity of the chemical composition for the core and shell. In addition, the homogeneous dispersion of the two elements was further confirmed by obtaining the uniformly distributed elemental mapping images (Fig. 1h–j). Besides, the image contrast between the core, the shell and the void space provided more details of the yolk–shell structure.

To elucidate the formation mechanism of the yolk–shell BiO2−x, solvothermal reactions with different heating rates (R) were adopted. As observed, core–shell spheres were obtained when R was 2 °C min−1, of which the shell is porous but is in contact with the core firmly (Fig. S5a†). However, when R was increased to 5 °C min−1, intricate yolk–shell spheres with a porous shell and eccentric yolk were obtained (Fig. S5b†). Interestingly, further increasing R to 40 °C min−1, many complex hollow spheres with smaller size were created, as seen from Fig. S5c.† These results demonstrated that adjustment of the heating rate could readily modify the interior structure of the spheres. The possible reason is that the temperature gradient along the radial direction could be adjusted by the heating rate. At a lower heating rate, due to the homogeneous heat from the outer surface to the inner centre, the diffusion of the element in the core and its successive formation in the shell were almost uniform and at a lower speed, therefore resulting in the formation of core–shell solid spheres. However, at a higher heating rate, the diffusion rate may be higher than the formation rate, and thus the core became separated from the shell, forming the yolk–shell structure. Besides, a higher heating rate may induce more nucleation rather than the growth of the crystals, causing the gradual decrease in the size of the structure. And much more intricate interiors caused by the non-uniform diffusion were observed at an elevated heating rate. It seemed that the starting diffusion point was not always identical in this case. Similar observations were also found by Niu et al.,43 who recorded three scenarios of the bismuth oxide hollow nanoparticle formation process by the Kirkendall effect through in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy. Based on the above observations, a proposed formation mechanism of YS-BO-MS in this study was depicted in Scheme 1 correspondingly.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were conducted at low temperature (77 K) to verify the presence of the oxygen vacancy (Vo). It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the BiO2−x sample showed a very strong and sharp EPR signal at a g value of 2.000, which was the typical characteristic of Vo, demonstrating the oxygen deficient feature of the yolk–shell BiO2−x. Additional support of the existence of the oxygen vacancy was provided by the XPS analysis. In comparison with the Bi 4f spectra of commercial Bi2O3, two additional peaks of lower binding energies at 164.1 and 158.7 eV appeared for BiO2−x (Fig. 2b). The decreased binding energies of Bi originated from the partial reduction of Bi3+ by electrons localized at oxygen vacancies.44 For O 1s core-level spectra of BiO2−x (Fig. 2c), a new deconvoluted peak at 531.2 eV was identified, which was attributed to a high number of defect sites with low oxygen coordination.45 The peak at 529.8 eV was due to the lattice oxygen bound to metals.44

Another hint of the presence of deficiency was deduced from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was observed from Fig. 2d that the slight weight loss below 200 °C was mainly caused by the evaporation of the adsorbed water, and the relatively sharper weight loss between 200 and 400 °C was ascribed to the decomposition of organic residues. The following increment of weight (1 wt%, 500–600 °C), which corresponded to the oxidation and transformation process from BiO2−x to Bi2O3 (Fig. S6,† XRD pattern of the calcinated BiO2−x), further demonstrated the successful formation of defective BiO2−x. According to the changes of the weight, it can be deduced that the YS-BO-MS could be written as BiO1.314, which was consistent with the observations from EDX spectra (Table S1†).
To shed light on the role of the oxygen vacancy and the distinctive morphology in the photocatalytic performance, the oxygen defective YS-BO-MS, core–shell BiO2−x and the commercial Bi2O3 were applied to inactivate the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). As shown in Fig. 3, in the light and dark control experiments, the population of E. coli remained almost unchanged after 3 h of irradiation, indicating no toxic effect on the bacteria as well as no photolysis of the bacterial cells under irradiation alone. However, ∼7log of E. coli was completely inactivated by the oxygen deficient YS-BO-MS after visible light irradiation for 3 h, superior to that of the core–shell BiO2−x and the commercial Bi2O3. It was suggested that the photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli involved three characteristic stages: (a) initial shoulder phase, (b) main bacterial inactivation period, and (c) final tailing stage. The existence of a shoulder is due to the fact that the cumulative damage to a single cell is needed before it was completely inhibited from proliferation. However a tailing is probably ascribed to the competition of the leaked intracellular components with bacterial cells for the reactive species.18,46 In our study, the tailing stage was negligible, while the initial 1.5 h might belong to the initial shoulder phase for the cumulative damage to the bacterial cells. The inactivation kinetics for these obtained catalysts was well fitted by using a “shoulder + log-linear” model (eqn (1)) proposed by Geeraerd et al.47 accordingly. (1)where the Nt and N0 are the survival number of cells (log, in cfu) at irradiation time equal to t and 0, respectively; kmax denotes the inactivation rate; S is the shoulder length (time span of the initial incubation phase). As seen from Fig. 3 and Table S2,† even though the commercial Bi2O3 has a shorter shoulder length, the fitted inactivation rate for yolk–shell BiO2−x (kmax = 11.16 h−1, R2 = 0.997) is about 3 times that of commercial Bi2O3 and 2 times that of core–shell BiO2−x, indicating the better performance of yolk–shell BiO2−x toward bacterial inactivation. The different shoulder length between them might be ascribed to the variation in the formation, transformation and accumulation of different reactive species, as well as the variation in the damage power for complete proliferation inhibition of the cumulated reactive species to a single cell.

To further evaluate the inactivation effect, the BacLight Kit fluorescence microscopy method was conducted to investigate the viability of the cells. The SYTO 9 dye and propidium iodide were used as two staining dyes in this method. The former is a green-fluorescent nucleic acid stain, which can penetrate through both intact and damaged membranes, while the latter is a red-fluorescent nucleic acid stain, which can penetrate through the damaged membrane only. The red fluorescence can overlap and reduce the intensity of green fluorescence. As a result, live bacterial cells can be distinguished from the dead ones, as the stained live cells will emit green fluorescence, different from the counterparts with red or orange fluorescence. Before the irradiation, the initial untreated bacteria exhibited intense green fluorescence. As time increases, increasing emission of red fluorescence by bacteria was observed, suggesting a gradual loss of the cell membrane integrity (Fig. 4). Moreover, the leakage of the potassium ion was also monitored during the photocatalytic process, as it is a component that not only existed in the bacterial cells, but is also involved in the regulation of the polysome content and protein synthesis.48 It can be seen from Fig. S7,† compared with their concentration in the control experiments, the potassium ions leaked instantly from the cells during the photocatalytic inactivation process, indicating the permeability change of the membrane. Therefore, with visible light irradiation, the photocatalyst BiO2−x performed progressive damage on the bacteria and exhibited a considerable photocatalytic inactivation efficiency.

To find out the key reactive species in the bacterial inactivation process, various scavengers were employed individually to eliminate their effects on the final efficiency. Before conducting the scavenger study, the concentration of each scavenger was optimized to ensure the maximum scavenging effect but no toxic or inactivation effect to the bacterial cells. The scavengers used in this study were isopropanol (7.5 mM) for ˙OH, sodium oxalate (0.5 mM) for h+, Cr(VI) (0.1 mM) for e−, TEMPOL (1 mM) for O2−, and Fe-EDTA (0.1 mM) for H2O2. Besides, to understand the role of oxygen, N2 was introduced continuously to purge out the oxygen dissolved in the system. As seen from Fig. 5a, with the addition of isopropanol or sodium oxalate, no obvious inhibition effect was observed as compared to the experiment without scavenger, suggesting that both ˙OH and h+ were not involved in the inactivation process. No contribution of ˙OH to the bacterial inactivation was observed probably because ˙OH has quite limited lifetime (4 × 10−9 s) and short diffusion distance (6 nm) in water,48 which might have already been quenched before enough ˙OH was accumulated for a complete damage of a single cell. Besides, ˙OH is thermodynamically unfavourably produced as the catalyst has less positive valence band potentials (Fig. 8). However, when Cr(VI), TEMPOL, Fe-EDTA, and N2 were introduced separately, the final efficiency was almost completely or dramatically suppressed, implying that the e−, O2−, and H2O2 were dominant species in the visible light driven photocatalytic inactivation process. Besides, as shown in Fig. 5b, in the presence of DMPO, an obvious superoxide radical anion (O2−) signal could be observed in the ESR spectrum of BiO2−x after 4 min of visible light irradiation, and the intensity of the signal also increased with the extension of irradiation time. While, as a contrast, no DMPO-O2− signal could be detected under dark conditions. This further confirmed the participation of O2− in the bacterial inactivation process. Hence, it can be concluded that the formation of these species followed the following reduction pathway (eqn (2)–(4)). Table S3† displays the detailed potentials for these reduction reactions, given the conduction band potentials of BiO2−x, O2− and H2O2 are thermodynamically favourably produced. O2 + e− → O2−(2) O2− + H+ → ˙HO2(3) ˙HO2 + H+ + e− → H2O2(4)

And it can be found from Fig. 5a that, compared with the inhibition effects of the capture agent for O2−, the inactivation efficiency was inhibited more significantly when the scavengers for H2O2 were added to the inactivation system, implying that H2O2 might be relatively more important. To further investigate their importance, the steady-state concentration of O2− and H2O2 in the photocatalytic process was determined. The production of O2− was quantitatively analysed by detecting the decrease in the concentration of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT, kO2−,NBT = 5.88 × 104 M−1 s−1) at a wavelength of 260 nm with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (LabTech).49,50 To be specific, the O2− can be calculated with eqn (5) by using the pseudo-first-order reaction fitting curve of NBT concentration (Fig. 6a). As a result, the concentration of O2− was estimated to be 8.70 × 10−10 M. In addition, H2O2 generated in the photocatalytic process was analysed on a fluorescence spectrophotometer based on the reaction of H2O2 with coumarin to form a highly fluorescent compound (7-hydroxycoumarin, 456 nm).51 As seen from Fig. 6b, after 3 h of irradiation, the accumulation of the generated H2O2 reached up to 15.7 × 10−6 M, the amount of which is four orders of magnitude higher than that of O2−, further suggesting the significance of H2O2. Besides, H2O2 is quite stable with a half-life of several days in pure water.52 Although biodegradation and photo-oxidation may decrease its half-life, it is still sufficient for H2O2 to diffuse into the suspension to cause damage to the bacterial cells. Based on the above analysis, we assume that the E. coli inactivation was achieved mainly by the effects of H2O2, assisted by the involvement of O2−. (5)

To understand the relationship between the photocatalyst and inactivation mechanism comprehensively, the surface area, the light absorption ability and the separation ability of the photoinduced carrier were investigated in detail. Compared with commercial Bi2O3 and core–shell BiO2−x, yolk shell BiO2−x possessed a higher surface area (Table S4†). Its surface area was almost twice that of the core–shell BiO2−x, which might be ascribed to the distinctive yolk–shell structure and would promote the photocatalytic activities correspondingly by offering more active sites.53 As shown in Fig. 7a, the light absorption ability of the yolk–shell BiO2−x obviously surpassed that of the core–shell BiO2−x, possibly because the yolk–shell structure with a unique yolk allowed multiple reflections of the visible light within the interior voids, and thus ensured the promoted photocatalytic activity. Besides, diffuse reflectance and absorbance spectroscopy revealed that the band gap of the untreated commercial Bi2O3 was approximately 2.63 eV (∼472 nm). However, the onset of optical absorption of the oxygen deficient core–shell and yolk–shell BiO2−x red shifted to about ∼600 and ∼700 nm, respectively. Such a prominent change in the spectra suggested that the energy band gap was substantially narrowed. Normally, the photoexcited holes and electrons by the catalysts with a narrower band gap can recombine with each other more easily. However, the yolk–shell BiO2−x outperformed the other two in terms of separating the photogenerated charge efficiently, as implied by the PL measurements (Fig. 7b). It might be ascribed to the presence of the oxygen vacancy, which can help promote the separation of charge carriers owing to the excellent electron-trapping capability. And not surprisingly, the yolk–shell BiO2−x had the highest photocurrent density under simulated solar light irradiation among various catalysts (Fig. 7c), indicating its better performance in the separation of the photoinduced charges. To further understand the role of the oxygen vacancy, the concentration of photogenerated O2− and H2O2 during the photocatalytic process in the presence of BiO2−x or Bi2O3 was investigated for comparison (Fig. S8†). The generation of O2− and H2O2 by Bi2O3 was slower than that by BiO2−x, implying that the oxygen defective BiO2−x had a higher affinity for molecular O2 to form O2− and the subsequent transformation to H2O2. In addition, the effects induced by the oxygen vacancy can be further deduced from the valence band XPS (Fig. 7d). The commercial Bi2O3 displayed the edge of maximum energy at about 1.70 eV. As its band gap is 2.63 eV, the conduction band minimum would locate at about −0.93 eV correspondingly. For the oxygen deficient yolk–shell BiO2−x, the valence band maximum energy shifted slightly to about 1.38 eV; the difference (0.32 eV) was not sufficient to explain the distinct optical absorption. Combined with the existence of the oxygen vacancy, there would be an oxygen vacancy induced state below the conduction band minimum, mainly narrowing the band gap. Optical transitions from the valence band tail to the oxygen vacancy induced states are presumably responsible for the optical absorption onset around ∼700 nm for yolk–shell BiO2−x. The relevant schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 8.

 Fig. 8  Proposed mechanism of the photocatalytic inactivation toward E. coli by oxygen deficient yolk–shell BiO2−x. 
Based on the above results, a proposed mechanism of the superior visible light driven photocatalytic inactivation can be described as follows. When the catalyst BiO2−x was irradiated with visible light, the incident light would be effectively utilized due to the multiple reflections between the yolk and shell, which would excite the electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Many pioneering studies pointed out that the oxygen vacancy had a high affinity for molecular oxygen,54 and could serve as trapping sites for the photogenerated electron to promote the separation of charge carriers.55,56 Therefore, the excited electron would transfer to the oxygen vacancy induced states and reduce the molecular oxygen to O2−, and further transform to produce H2O2. And the redox potential of the photogenerated holes for BiO2−x was less positive than that of ˙OH/OH− (+1.99 eV vs. NHE) as well as ˙OH/H2O (+2.73 eV vs. NHE), further confirming that the reactive species (O2−, H2O2) were formed through the reduction pathway (eqn (2)–(4)). This exactly explained why the inactivation efficiency dropped dramatically when the electron scavenger was added to the inactivation system. Then the formed reactive species would attack the membrane of the E. coli cells, causing progressive loss of the integrity and viability of the cells, and thus achieving complete photocatalytic disinfection.
Conclusions
In summary, by adopting a facile solvothermal method, we successfully and firstly synthesized oxygen deficient yolk–shell BiO2−x. Temperature gradient caused by the heating rate resulted in variations between the diffusion rate of the core and the formation rate of the shell, and thus the formation of the spheres with different interior structures. Besides, the crucial roles of oxygen vacancies in the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation were clearly identified. In detail, the yolk–shell structure allowed multiple reflections of incident light, and promoted the absorption and utilization of the visible light. And the oxygen vacancies, as trapping sites for the photogenerated electrons, exhibited a high affinity for molecular oxygen, then promoted the formation of O2− and the secondary product H2O2. These reactive species worked together guaranteeing the prominent oxidation ability toward the bacterial cells. The work described herein is inspiring and provides an optional approach for preparing oxygen deficient catalysts with intricate and exquisite morphology structures for environmental remediation.
