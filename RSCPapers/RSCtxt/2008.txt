    , Accepted 1st August 2016First published on 16th August 2016AbstractMany metal halides that contain cations with the ns2 electronic configuration have recently been discovered as high-performance optoelectronic materials. In particular, solar cells based on lead halide perovskites have shown great promise as evidenced by the rapid increase of the power conversion efficiency. In this paper, we show density functional theory calculations of electronic structure and dielectric and defect properties of CsGeI3 (a lead-free halide perovskite material). The potential of CsGeI3 as a solar cell material is assessed based on its intrinsic properties. We find anomalously large Born effective charges and a large static dielectric constant dominated by lattice polarization, which should reduce carrier scattering, trapping, and recombination by screening charged defects and impurities. Defect calculations show that CsGeI3 is a p-type semiconductor and its hole density can be modified by varying the chemical potentials of the constituent elements. Despite the reduction of long-range Coulomb attraction by strong screening, the iodine vacancy in CsGeI3 is found to be a deep electron trap due to the short-range potential, i.e., strong Ge–Ge covalent bonding, which should limit electron transport efficiency in p-type CsGeI3. This is in contrast to the shallow iodine vacancies found in several Pb and Sn halide perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3SnI3, and CsSnI3). The low-hole-density CsGeI3 may be a useful solar absorber material but the presence of the low-energy deep iodine vacancy may significantly reduce the open circuit voltage of the solar cell. On the other hand, CsGeI3 may be used as an efficient hole transport material in solar cells due to its small hole effective mass, the absence of low-energy deep hole traps, and the favorable band offset with solar absorber materials such as dye molecules and CH3NH3PbI3.
I. Introduction
Halides are usually ionic compounds which have large band gaps and are prone to defect formation due to their soft lattices. However, some metal halides that contain ns2 ions (ions with an outer electron configuration of ns2, e.g., Tl+, Pb2+, Bi3+ and Sn2+) have significant covalency to enable efficient carrier transport and have relatively small band gaps (due to the relatively high electronegativity of the ns2 ions) for various optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaics (PV) and photodetection. The mixed ionic-covalent character of these halides leads to strong lattice polarization and a large static dielectric constant, which provides strong screening to charged defects and impurities, thereby suppressing carrier scattering and trapping.1,2 Among halides that contain ns2 cations, Tl+ and Pb2+ based halides have received most of the attention. The electron and hole diffusion lengths in single-crystal and polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 exceed 100 μm and 1 μm, respectively.3–6 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the halide perovskite solar cells has exceeded 20%, which is close to the PCE of CdTe and CIGS thin-film solar cells.7 Single-crystal TlBr has a large electron mobility-lifetime product (6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1) comparable to that of CdTe.8,9 Tl6SeI4,10 Tl6SI4,11 and CsPbBr3 (ref. 12) have also been reported to have good carrier transport properties. TlBr, Tl6SeI4, Tl6SI4, CsPbBr3, and CH3NH3PbI3 have all been investigated as radiation or photodetection materials.8–11,13–15 Replacing the ns2 ions with other isovalent ions (such as replacing Pb2+ in halide perovskites by alkali earth metals) usually leads to much larger band gaps and effective masses.16,17
One of the problems of Tl+ and Pb2+ based halides is the toxicity of Tl and Pb, which is a challenge to the wide-spread use of these materials. The Bi3+ and Sb3+ based halides have the advantage of having low toxicity but often have crystal structures of reduced dimensionality (due to the large oxidation state of Bi3+ and Sb3+ and the resulting high anion/cation ratio), which leads to anisotropic structural, electronic, and dielectric properties.18–21.
Tin and germanium iodide perovskites (CsSnI3,22,23 CH3NH3SnI3,24,25 CsGeI3,26 and CH3NH3GeI3,26) are the obvious candidates in the search for Pb-free halide perovskite solar cell materials. Compared to lead iodide perovskites (APbI3), the tin/germanium iodide perovskites (ASnI3/AGeI3) have a stronger anti-bonding character near the valence band maximum (VBM) due to the more active Sn 5s/Ge 4s lone pairs than the Pb 6s lone pair. The Sn 5s/Ge 4s band below the valence band hybridizes significantly with the I-5p-states in the valence band; their anti-bonding states reside near the VBM, which makes it easy to create holes at the VBM, effectively oxidizing Sn2+/Ge2+. The resulting large hole density in tin/germanium iodide perovskites often leads to metallic conductivity and short circuit behavior of the solar cell.22,26,27,28 Semiconducting tin and germanium iodide perovskites (such as CH3NH3SnI3) can also be made by synthesis from solution.26,29,30 However, the solar cells that employ CH3NH3SnI3, CH3NH3GeI3, and CsGeI3 as solar absorber materials have so far shown much lower PCE than those employing lead halide perovskites.24–27 CsSnI3 has also been used as a hole transport material (HTM) in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells, which show PCE up to 10.2%.23
CsGeI3 has been investigated as a solar absorber material26 but not yet as a hole transport material. In contrast to CsPbI3 and CsSnI3, which have instability towards the formation of yellow phases (with 1D chain structures and large band gaps) at room temperature,29 CsGeI3 has a 3D perovskite structure with a small rhombohedral distortion (space group R3m) (see Fig. 1) and does not encounter crystal phase transitions in low-temperature solution growth.30 CsGeI3 has a band gap of 1.6 eV at room temperature, suitable for PV applications.30 The calculated band structure of CsGeI3 shows a dispersive valence band, favorable for hole transport.30 The VBM of CsGeI3 (i.e., −5.1 eV (ref. 26) relative to the vacuum level) is lower than those of CsSnI3 and CH3NH3SnI3 (i.e., −4.95 eV (ref. 23) and −4.6 eV (ref. 27), respectively) and is closer to the VBM of the typical HTM (−5.2 eV).27,31 Thus, compared with CsSnI3 and CH3NH3SnI3, CsGeI3, when used as a solar absorber, has the advantage of making better Ohmic contact (for hole transport) with the HTM/Au electrode in the solar cell.

In this paper, we show DFT calculations of the electronic structure and dielectric and defect properties of CsGeI3. Similar to other halide perovskites that contain ns2 ions, CsGeI3 has small electron and hole effective masses, strongly enhanced Born effective charges, and a large static dielectric constant dominated by lattice polarization. Defect calculations show that VGe and VCs are important native acceptors while VI is the most important donor defect. CsGeI3 is found to be a p-type semiconductor; the Fermi level and the hole density can be tuned by varying the chemical potentials of the constituent elements. VI is predicted to be a deep electron trap and non-radiative recombination center, in contrast to the shallow iodine vacancies found in CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3SnI3, and CsSnI3.2,28,32–34 Defect chemistry in CsGeI3 is discussed in relation to other halide perovskite materials. The deep donor VI in CsGeI3 is consistent with the measured low open circuit voltage (VOC)26 and should be a challenge to the development of CsGeI3 as a solar absorber material. However, CsGeI3 may be used as a hole transport material in solar cells due to its small hole effective masses, the absence of low-energy deep hole traps, and the favorable band offset between CsGeI3 and solar absorber materials such as dye molecules and CH3NH3PbI3.
II. Computational methods
All calculations were performed based on density functional theory. Born effective charges and dielectric constants were calculated using Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)35 generalized gradient approximation (GGA) without spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Defect formation energies are given by: (1)where ED and Eh are the total energies of the defect-containing and the host (i.e. defect-free) supercells. Formation of a defect involves exchange of atoms with their respective chemical reservoirs. The second term in eqn (1) represents the change in energy due to such exchange of atoms, where ni is the difference in the number of atoms for the i'th atomic species between the defect-containing and defect-free supercells. μi is the relative chemical potential for the i'th atomic species, referenced to its bulk μrefi. The third term in eqn (1) represents the change in energy due to the exchange of electrons with their reservoir. εVBM is the energy of the VBM and εf is the Fermi energy relative to the VBM. The transition level of a defect, ε(q/q′), corresponding to a change in its charge state between q and q′, is given by the Fermi level, at which the formation energies, ΔH(q) and ΔH(q′), for charge states q and q′ are equal to each other: ε(q/q′) = [ΔH(q) − ΔH(q′)]/(q′ − q)(2)
The defect formation energies were calculated using PBE functionals with the VBM and the conduction band minimum (CBM) from the PBE calculation corrected using hybrid density functional calculations. The band gap of CsGeI3 calculated using PBE functionals including the SOC is 0.79 eV. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional calculation including the SOC was used to correct the band gap. The fraction of the Fock exchange was adjusted to 45% to produce a band gap of 1.57 eV, in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.6 eV.30 The shallow defect levels, which have mainly the character of bulk electronic states, were first calculated using PBE functionals and then were shifted with their respective HSE-corrected band edges, while the deep levels, which are highly localized, were not corrected since they are not expected to move following the band gap correction.36–38 Corrections to the defect formation energy due to potential alignment (between the host and a charged defect supercell), band filling effects, and image charge were applied wherever appropriate.39 We used a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell (135 atoms if defect free) and a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point mesh for the calculations of defect formation energies and defect levels. The SOC was not included in the total energy and the structural relaxation calculations of the defect systems. The experimental lattice parameters (space group R3m, a = b = c = 5.983 Å and α = β = γ = 88.61°) were used in all calculations.40 Using theoretical or experimental lattice parameters should make little differences in defect levels and formation energies,38 which involve only the calculations of energy differences rather than absolute energies.
The lattice part of the static dielectric constant, εion, was calculated using PBE functionals; the electronic part, ε∞, was calculated using HSE hybrid functionals with 45% Fock exchange (which corrects the PBE band gap error) because ε∞is sensitive to the band gap.
The PBE and HSE calculations were performed using projector augmented wave method (PAW)41 as implemented in the VASP code.42,43 The cut-off energy for the plane waves was set at 310 eV and all forces were minimized to <0.02 eV Å−1 in the structural relaxation calculations. For the calculations of Born effective charges and the ionic part of the static dielectric constant, which require more stringent force accuracy, a higher cutoff energy of 400 eV and a tighter force convergence criterion (<0.01 eV Å−1) were used.
III. Results and discussion
The Born effective charge is a measure of how lattice polarization develops with atomic displacements. Halides that contain ns2 cations typically exhibit mixed ionic-covalent character, which gives rise to anomalously high Born effective charges and strong lattice polarization.1,2,20,44,45Table 1 shows the calculated Born effective charges of CsGeI3. The Born effective charges of Ge are more than doubled and those of I are more than quadrupled from their nominal ionic charges along the Ge–I bond directions due to the mixed ionic-covalent Ge–I bonds in CsGeI3. The large Born effective charges lead to strong lattice polarization as evidenced by the calculated large static dielectric constant dominated by the ionic contribution (Table 2). The calculated static dielectric constant (18.6) of CsGeI3 is large compared to semiconductors with similar band gaps. A large static dielectric constant provides strong screening to the charged impurities and defects, thereby suppressing the charge trapping and recombination. This is an important characteristic related to the efficient carrier transport in halides that contain ns2 cations.1,2,20,44–46 The calculated static dielectric constant of CsGeI3 is close to that calculated for CH3NH3PbI3, ∼21.7, (without considering the response of the dipolar CH3NH3 molecules).2 The experimentally measured static dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3 is 60–70.31,47–49 The free-rotating dipolar CH3NH3 molecules make a significant contribution to the total static dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3.

We performed total energy calculations for CsGeI3 and competing phases to construct the phase diagram. To obtain stable growth of CsGeI3 without the formation of other competing phases (e.g., CsI, GeI2, GeI4, and Cs2I8), the relative chemical potentials of Tl, Se, and I in eqn (1) must be constrained to meet the following conditions. (3)where ΔH(CsGeI3), ΔH(CsI), ΔH(GeI2), ΔH(GeI4), and ΔH(Cs2I8) are the enthalpies of formation (per formula unit) of CsGeI3, CsI, GeI2, GeI4, and Cs2I8, respectively. The chemical potential ranges for single-phase CsGeI3 are shown in Fig. 2 along with those for other competing phases.
 Fig. 2  Calculated ranges of chemical potentials for CsGeI3 and its competing phases under thermal equilibrium. The polygon ABCD is the region where CsGeI3 is stable without forming other phases. 

Fig. 3 shows the native defect formation energies calculated using chemical potentials corresponding to points A, B, C, and D in Fig. 2, which are on the boundaries of the stable CsGeI3 region. The low-energy native defects play an important role in charge carrier transport. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the most important native defects in CsGeI3 are vacancies, i.e., Ge and Cs vacancies (VGe and VCs) as acceptors and the iodine vacancy (VI) as a donor. Compared to vacancies, the formation of interstitials is usually energetically less favorable in the close-packed perovskite structure. The antisite involving a cation on the anion site or an anion on the cation site is also likely to cause large formation energy in materials with relatively high ionicity. Therefore, vacancies are usually the most common defects in halides. We note that recent DFT calculations predicted that methylammonium (MA) interstitial MAi in MAPbI3 and SnI (Sn on I site) in CsSnI3 are low-energy native donor defects, even more stable than halogen vacancy defects.28,32 These results are highly unusual. In CsGeI3, we find that Csi and GeI both have relatively high formation energies regardless of the chemical potentials.

At the Ge-poor and I-rich limit (point C in Fig. 2), VGe has very low formation energy, followed by VCs. Both are shallow acceptors as shown in Fig. 4 and can easily produce free holes in CsGeI3. There is no native donor defect to effectively compensate these native acceptor defects. The Fermi level should be near the VBM. Under this condition, CsGeI3 could be a degenerate semiconductor, acting more like a metal than a semiconductor. The high hole conductivity may lead to metallic conductivity in CsGeI3 and the short circuit behavior of the solar cell.
 Fig. 4  Calculated charge transition levels for native defects in CsGeI3. 
Under the Ge-rich, Cs-rich, and I-poor limit (point B in Fig. 2), the concentrations of VGe and VCs are reduced while VI becomes more abundant. The formation energy lines of VI and VGe cross at εv + 0.43 eV [Fig. 3(b)]. The Fermi level should be located near this crossing point, resulting in p-type semiconducting CsGeI3, which may be used as a p-type solar absorber material. An important result here is that VI is found to be a deep electron trap and nonradiative recombination center since the calculated (+/0) and (0/−) levels of VI are both deep inside the band gap as shown in Fig. 4. VI plays an important role of compensating the shallow native acceptors (VGe and VCs) and preventing metallic conductivity, which is necessary for using CsGeI3 as a solar absorber material. On the other hand, VI, as a deep electron trap, can seriously reduce the electron mobility and lifetime. The presence of the deep donor VI in CsGeI3 is consistent with the measured low open circuit voltage (VOC) in CsGeI3 solar cells.26
The halogen vacancy is an important defect in halides and usually induces deep levels inside the band gap. However, halogen vacancies in TlBr and CH3NH3PbI3 are shallow donors,2,32,34,50 which strongly contribute to the efficient electron transport observed in these halides. The electron trapping energy in the halogen vacancy is determined by the long-range Coulomb attraction and the short-range potential arising from the cation orbital hybridization at the vacancy. The former is more important in ionic compounds while the latter is more important in covalent compounds. Halides usually have significant ionicity. However, in halides that contain ns2 cations, the static dielectric constant is usually large, which reduces the long-range Coulomb attraction. Thus, the hybridization of the cation orbitals plays an important role in determining the electron trapping energy at a halogen vacancy.34 This is particularly true for CsGeI3, where a strong covalent bond can form between the two Ge atoms adjacent to the iodine vacancy for trapping electrons. The two Ge ions near V+I is separated by a long distance of 6.36 Å due to the Coulomb repulsion. The addition of one or two electrons creates an energy incentive for the two Ge ions to move closer, resulting in stronger orbital hybridization and a bound state to trap the added electrons. The Ge–Ge distances V0I in and V−I are reduced to 2.95 Å and 2.79 Å, respectively. The two Ge ions adjacent to V+I are five-fold coordinated. But in V−I, these two Ge ions form a strong Ge–Ge bond as shown in Fig. 5. Each of these two Ge ions retains strong bonding with only two of its neighboring I ions and breaks away from the other three I neighbors. Fig. 5 shows the isodensity surface of the partial charge density associated with the localized Ge–Ge bond. Despite the energy cost due to the structural distortion, the formation of the strong Ge–Ge covalent bond significantly lowers the total energy and makes the deep electron trapping energetically favorable. The Sn–Sn and the Pb–Pb bonds in Sn and Pb halide perovskites are considerably weaker than the Ge–Ge bond. This may explain the deep VI in CsGeI3vs. shallow VI in CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3SnI3, and CsSnI3.

CsSnI3 had been investigated as a hole transport material in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells.23 However, the VBM and the CBM of CsGeI3 provide better band offset with the dye molecules than those of CsSnI3 as shown in Fig. 6. The CBM of CsSnI3 (−3.62 eV relative to the vacuum level23) is slightly lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the N719 dye molecules (−3.64 eV (ref. 23)); thus, although CsSnI3 can conduct holes, it does not effectively block electrons. On the other hand, the CBM of CsGeI3 (−3.45 eV (ref. 26)) is higher than the LUMO of the N719 dye molecules, thus, providing more reliable rejection of electrons from the dyes. Compared to the VBM of CsSnI3 (−4.92 eV (ref. 23)), the VBM of CsGeI3 (−5.1 eV (ref. 26)) is closer to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the N719 dye molecule (−6.01 eV (ref. 23)), which may lead to higher open circuit voltage while still allowing hole extraction from the dyes. Furthermore, CsGeI3 has small effective masses as shown in Table 3 and has no low-energy deep native acceptors as shown in Fig. 3 and 4. Thus, CsGeI3 may be a potential hole transport material in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells.

CsGeI3 has an optical band gap of 1.6 eV and thus may also absorb photons in a dye-sensitized solar cell. The band alignment diagram (Fig. 6) shows that it is energetically favorable for the electrons in the conduction band of CsGeI3 to be transferred to the LUMO of the N719 dye molecule. Importantly, the energy difference between the CBM of CsGeI3 and the LUMO of the N719 dye molecule (0.19 eV) is significantly smaller than the electron trapping energy at the I vacancy (0.4 eV). Thus, it should be more efficient for a photoelectron in CsGeI3 near the CsGeI3/N719 interface to be transferred to the N719 dye molecule than to be trapped in the I vacancy because less phonons need to be emitted for the electron transfer from CsGeI3 to the N719 dye molecules.
From a band alignment point of view, CsGeI3, as a hole transport material, is also compatible with the CH3NH3PbI3 solar absorber, which has its VBM and CBM at −5.5 and −3.9 eV, respectively.31 However, the CsGeI3 hole conductor should probably be avoided in an inverted CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell, in which the photons need to pass through the hole conductor before reaching the CH3NH3PbI3 solar absorber, because the CsGeI3 solar absorber can absorb the solar irradiation and lead to energy loss due to its low-energy deep iodine vacancy defect as shown in Fig. 3 and 4.
IV. Conclusion
Density functional calculations are performed to study dielectric and defect properties of CsGeI3. Consistent with other halides that contain ns2 ions, CsGeI3 exhibits anomalously large Born effective charges and a large static dielectric constant dominated by strong lattice polarization. A large dielectric constant provides strong screening to charged defects and impurities, thereby reducing carrier scattering, trapping, and recombination. The defect calculations show that, (1) under Ge-poor conditions, CsGeI3 should have a high density of the shallow native acceptor Ge vacancy, which can generate high free hole density and may result in metallic conductivity and the short circuit behavior of CsGeI3 solar cells; (2) under Ge-rich conditions, CsGeI3 is a semiconducting material with reduced hole density and conductivity due to the increased concentration of compensating donors, i.e., the iodine vacancy. The semiconducting CsGeI3 may be used as a solar absorber material. However, the iodine vacancy in CsGeI3 is a deep electron trap and nonradiative recombination center due to the strong Ge–Ge covalent bonding, which is in contrast to the shallow iodine vacancies found in several Pb and Sn halide perovskites, e.g., CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3SnI3, and CsSnI3. The presence of the iodine-vacancy-induced deep traps in CsGeI3 should limit the performance of CsGeI3 solar cells. However, CsGeI3 may have high potential to be used as an efficient hole transport material in solar cells due to its small hole effective masses, the absence of low-energy deep hole traps, and the favorable band offset between CsGeI3 and solar absorber materials such as dye molecules and CH3NH3PbI3.

 	Fig. 2  Calculated ranges of chemical potentials for CsGeI3 and its competing phases under thermal equilibrium. The polygon ABCD is the region where CsGeI3 is stable without forming other phases.	 

 	Fig. 3  Calculated formation energies of native defects in CsGeI3 using chemical potentials corresponding to points A (a), B (b), C (c), and D (d) in Fig. 2. Slopes of the formation energy lines indicate the charge states of the defects. A transition level is where the slope changes.	 

 	Fig. 4  Calculated charge transition levels for native defects in CsGeI3.	 

 	Fig. 5  Structure of V−I. The two Ge ions (Ge1 and Ge2) form a covalent bond. Each of them is coordinated with only two iodine ions. The isodensity surface (0.0035 e bohr−3) of the partial charge density associated with the Ge–Ge bond is also shown.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic band alignment diagram of the N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cell with CsGeI3 or CsSnI3 as the hole transport material. The energy values of the valence and conduction band edges are shown relative to the vacuum level (0 eV).23,26 The arrows indicate the electron (e−) and hole transport (h+) direction after photoexcitation of e−–h+ pairs in the N719 dye.
