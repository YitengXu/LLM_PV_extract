In this paper, we investigate the preparation of low index films through modulation of the porosity of silica nanoparticle films. Porosity variation is accomplished by introducing polystyrene porogen within colloidal silica nanoparticle films, which are deposited in a controlled manner, followed by pyrolysis of the porogen. Multilayer stacks of nanoparticle films with varying degrees of porosity were fabricated by sequentially spin coating and sintering various silica–polystyrene mixtures. The average transmittance (400–1000 nm) of Corning glass was improved from 91.0% to 95.2% using a three layer stack on one glass–air interface, and to 99.0% using three layer stacks on both interfaces – the highest reported values for facile synthesized multilayer structures. Utilization of the single and dual interface high transparency glass placed on a crystalline silicon solar cell leads to increased photocurrent densities by 4.0% and 6.0%, respectively, relative to uncoated glass.
Introduction
The design and ease of fabrication of broadband and directionally invariant anti-reflective coatings1,2 (ARCs) are limited by the available fixed refractive index antireflective (AR) materials; common low to medium index materials include MgF2, Si3N4 and TiO2 with indices of 1.38, 1.95 and 2.35, respectively. Hence, ARC designs range from the single quarter wavelength layer minimizing transmittance at a single wavelength value, quarter-half wavelength two layer ARC minimizing reflectance at two wavelength values while simultaneously broadening transmittance, to elaborate multi-layer systems of more than a dozen layers to achieve minimal reflectance over a large wavelength range. The integration of designer-specified indices into a multi-layered ARC that can be readily and economically fabricated to attain highly transparent glass would aid immensely in enhancing light transmission and hence the performance of optical devices. Moreover, enhanced utilization of the solar spectrum with the transition from single to tandem to multijunction solar cells further intensifies the need for broadband ARCs due to increased interfaces.3,4 Thus, complete broad-band and directionally-invariant coupling of solar light into the encapsulating glass and the underlying solar cell will result in marked gains in photogenerated power of up to 10% in the visible. The fabrication of antireflective coatings has employed both top–down and bottom–up techniques.5–7 A stack of 75 layers comprising 4 different materials on a glass surface can produce an average broad-band reflectivity of less than 0.2%;8 while this result is impressive, such a physical vapor deposition technique is deemed both onerous and economically impractical for large area applications. Recently, application of the GLancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) technique9 reported a two-layered ARC on both glass surfaces yielding an average transmissivity10 of 98.2% over a 400 nm to 1000 nm wavelength range; a striking result but also considered to be unfeasible for large area production. In a manner similar to the GLAD technique of introducing porosity to control refractive index, mesoporous silica nanoparticles dispersed in methanol mixed with a variable amount of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) binder yielded a porous single layer ARC of index 1.27 with a high transmittance at a single wavelength.11 Inducing porosity in silica films can be also initiated by plasma roughening of an acrylate layer on a PET substrate, followed by chemical vapor deposition of silica nanoparticles.12 In both instances, however, lower index films or graded index configurations have not been reported – criteria required to achieve a truly broadband ARC. Solution phase methods offer a potentially viable and economical avenue of creating controlled index graded layers.13–16 Within this framework, sol–gel techniques have been studied extensively and have resulted in demonstrated transmissivities of 99.4% to 99.8% over a narrow band of 450 nm to 700 nm on a glass substrate.14 However, owing to the sensitivity of the reaction kinetics of the process and the accompanying limitation in the lowest index achievable, truly broad-band sol–gel ARCs remain an active area of research.15,17 In contrast to the above described homogeneous ARCs, significant strides have been made in the development of inhomogeneous ARCs using textured periodic and aperiodic nanostructures.18–25 Using e-beam lithography on PMMA resin which was deposited on both glass surfaces,24 hyperbolic subwavelength structures exhibit average transmittance of 99.58% over the visible. Inhomogeneous thin film structures provide an ideal platform for ARCs but are difficult and costly to implement on a large scale due to the need for precise variation of material tapering and packing on the nanometer scale, despite the advent of embossing methods that produce patterned templates.27,28 To that end, the exploration of simpler geometries such as hexagonal lattices of polystyrene cylindrical nanopillars on quartz substrates has resulted in achieving high transmittances at large incident angles.29
In this paper, we explore facile fabrication of ARCs comprising tunable refractive indices via controlled introduction of porosity in silica nanoparticle films. The porosity is enabled by the introduction of polystyrene nanoparticles within the silica nanoparticle colloidal solution, followed by pyrolysis of the polystyrene from within the silica nanoparticle matrix after spin coating onto a substrate. Using this approach we modulate the void fraction and refractive index of the silica nanoparticle films, enabling realization of low index layers. Guided by genetic algorithm30–32 and Abeles' matrix optimization,34,35 multi-layered index-graded nanoparticle films were deposited on single and dual glass surfaces to exhibit broadband high transparency glass in the visible. Herein we report the highest average transmittance over a 600 nm broadband wavelength range using a facile synthesized multilayer structure amenable for photovoltaics and allied applications. We also demonstrate the integration of our structures in silicon photovoltaics and show a 6% enhancement in light capture which is equivalent to a power increase of 6 GWp (gigawatts peak) based on 100 GWp of cumulative global PV installed currently.
ARC fabrication
We systematically synthesize a range of porosity-varying silica nanoparticle films and characterize their porosities and refractive indices; we denote these as single layer films. Subsequently, specific index-varying nanoparticle films are integrated into a multilayer stack to render the desired ARC. The single-layer porous films are fabricated on a polished (100) crystalline silicon substrate by spin coating a colloidal mixture of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles followed by a sintering process. The colloidal mixture consists of 10 nm (±2 nm) diameter silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles (30% w/v, 1.27 × 1015 particles per mg) in aqueous suspension (Ludox 420794) and 50 nm (±7.5 nm) diameter polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (2.5% w/v, 1.456 × 1013 particles per mg) in aqueous suspension (Polybead© microspheres, Polyscience Inc. 08691-10) (Fig. 3–2). First, one part of the SiO2 solution is diluted with n parts of deionized (DI) water to obtain a 1:n dilution, where n varies from 0 to 7. Next, 15 mg of the diluted SiO2 solution is mixed with varying amounts of the PS colloidal solution. The SiO2–PS mixture is diluted with 100 mg of DI water to obtain the working colloidal mixture. This SiO2–PS mixture is then spin coated onto silicon substrates at 3500 RPM for 1 minute using an acceleration rate of 200 RPM per sec2. The resultant film is then sintered in ambient atmosphere at 450 °C for 1 hour with a ramp rate of 40 °C min−1. The refractive indices at 633 nm and thickness of the single layer porous silica nanoparticle films are determined by spectral ellipsometry (SE) (Sopra GES5-E). An estimate of the variance in the index and thickness of the films was measured on 2 spots on three films made with identical solutions. Porosity volume fractions and pore size distributions were determined using the atmospheric ellipso-porosimetry technique33 for selected films.
The synthesis of a discrete multilayer stack ARC involved consecutive layering of appropriate single-layer films. To prevent intermixing of the individual layers, we introduced a layer of 20 nm (±2 nm) diameter PS (1% w/v colloidal solution, Applied Physics, Inc. 3020A) between the single-porous layers. Specifically, we spin-coat all the single-layer SiO2–PS films and the intermediate PS layers consecutively (Fig. 1) and then sinter the entire stack. The use of 50 nm diameter PS intermediate layers yielded films of poor morphology.

Results and discussion
The refractive indices and physical thicknesses of the single layer silica films measured as a function of PS–SiO2 solution mass ratios are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The pore size distribution of silica films (prepared from pre-diluted silica of 1:1) as a function of PS–SiO2 solution mass ratios is shown in Fig. 2c and the porosity of selected films is shown as the inset in Fig. 2c. Topographical and cross sectional SEM images of several single-layer silica films are shown in Fig. 3. The film thicknesses as obtained from the SEM images were observed to be within 10 nm of the SE derived thicknesses. The refractive indices of the SiO2 films (for all pre-dilutions) synthesized without the use of PS ranges from 1.27 to 1.34 while the porosity is 33 ± 3% with an average pore diameter of 3 nm; a refractive index of 1.48 ± 0.02 is inferred for a non-porous film. The SEM images (Fig. 3) clearly indicate that PS-free SiO2 films are compactly packed agglomerates of nanoparticles (Fig. 3-a) and that the PS-based SiO2 films become increasingly loose aggregates of nanoparticles with increasing PS to silica mass ratio (Fig. 3-b–d). For PS–SiO2 mass ratio of ≤1:1, the porous films have well-defined circular pores embedded or extending through the film (Fig. 3-b). For moderate PS–SiO2 mass ratio of ≤5:1, the surface consists of circular mesopores and irregularly slit-shaped pores. This is also evident from the pore size distribution (Fig. 2c) which displays a band of peaks in the 10–30 nm radii range, and a long tail for pore radii ranging from 30 to 50 nm. During the pyrolysis of the polystyrene particles it is conceivable that gaseous product is entrained in the capillary flow of the receding aqueous solvent which increases the capillary forces and thus draw the silica nanoparticles closer which in turn lead to the resulting slit-like pores. For large PS–SiO2 mass ratio of >∼4.50, the films become much looser aggregates of individual particles with significantly less contact with neighboring particles (Fig. 3-d(i–ii)). For pre-dilutions of SiO2 solution of greater than 3:1, the depth continuity is disrupted. The films now comprise an underlying porous layer of nanoparticles with clusters of nanoparticles situated thereupon (Fig. 3-d-iii inset). The film ultimately becomes a disconnected accumulation of clusters (30–50 nm) of nanoparticles. The refractive index trend, exhibited in Fig. 2a is observed to follow the overall porosity trend of Fig. 2c inset. A linear and steep decrease in index from 1.34 to 1.20 is achieved for PS–SiO2 ratio of <1:1, while for PS–SiO2 ratio of >1:1 the index decreases more gradually from 1.20 to 1.10; this gradual decrease is attributed to the densification of the films. For even larger PS–SiO2 ratios, the refractive index ranges between 1.07 and 1.11. With a high pre-diluted SiO2 (>1:5) solution, a low refractive index can be achieved with PS–SiO2 ratio of >4.0. In some samples with high SiO2 dilution and high PS–SiO2 ratios, the index is greater than 1.12 which indicates that the macro-porous network has undergone marked densification.

With increasing pre-dilution of the silica solutions the film thickness decreases from 330 nm (1:0 dilution) to 80 nm (1:7 dilution), due to a lower concentration of silica particles in the spin coated layer. For large amounts of PS mixed with highly pre-diluted SiO2 solutions, the derived thicknesses are less than 50 nm, which corresponds to the size of a PS nanoparticle; the films then resemble a discontinuous distribution of clusters of silica nanoparticles – in short a rough surface.
The SEM cross-sectional and topographical images of each of the 3-layer ARC films used in the single interface and dual interface glass samples are shown in Fig. 4. Each ARC clearly exhibits 3 discrete layers. The lower porosity of the intermediate layer was also exposed by deliberate partial delamination of the top layer. The transmittance spectra of a 3 layer ARC on a single glass interface, measured over a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm, are shown in Fig. 5-a. The spectra illustrate wavelength broadening and increasing transmittance with increasing number of tuned porous silica layers. The transmittance ranges from 94.7% to 95.4% with an average of 95.2%. The calculated transmittances, based on the following optical and physical parameters [1.32 100 nm], [1.24 65 nm] and [1.12 75 nm], are also shown (pale lines). The calculated transmittances exhibit good agreement with the measured results, demonstrating the discrete character of the individual porous layers and their cumulative effect of rendering an ARC with optimal optical parameters.

Measured and calculated spectra correspond to ARCs on the first interface and the two ARCs on both interfaces. The thick and thin lines represent the measured and calculated transmittances, respectively. 
The transmittance spectra of the two 3 layer ARCs on both interfaces of the glass substrate are shown in Fig. 5-b. The measured transmittances range from 94.0% to 95.0% for the first 3 layer ARC on a single interface of glass and 97.8% to 99.5% for the double interfaced ARC glass. The average transmittance of the double interfaced ARC glass is 99.0%. The calculated transmittances are based on the following optical and physical parameters [1.33 80 nm], [1.21 100 nm], [1.13 100 nm] for layers 1–3 on the first interface of glass, and [1.33 180 nm], [1.24 120 nm], [1.16 140 nm] for layers 4–6 on the second interface of glass. However, the average TE and TM mode reflectance of the single interfaced ARC sample (Fig. 6) at 64° incidence is ∼25% and ∼4% respectively, which may not be optimally low for large incident angles. We determined through genetic algorithm (G.A.) an optimal angular reflectance requires a 4th layer of a slightly higher index than the 3rd layer. The 4th layer of a slightly larger index compensates for the decrease in phase thickness of the ARC layers by ncos(θ) with increasing incident angles which in turn will increase the reflectance at normal incidence. An angular incidence optimized single interfaced ARC will have TE and TM reflectance of ∼22% and 1.1% at 64° incident angle. An angular incidence G.A. optimized double interfaced ARC will have TE and TM reflectance of ∼6.5% and 1.6% at 64° incident angle, which is lower than the measured values of 7.5% and 2.5% of the double interfaced ARC sample. We summarize these results in Table 1.

Using an AM1.5G solar simulator we measured the I–V characteristics of a silicon cell covered with glass (denoted A), the identical cell covered with a 3 layer silica ARC glass (denoted B) and with a double side coated 3 layer ARC glass (denoted C); the I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 7. The silicon cell covered with the Corning glass and the ARC Corning glasses (single and dual side ARCs) exhibit short circuit current densities of JAsc = 35.1 mA cm−2, JBsc = 36.4 mA cm−2 and JCsc = 37.2 mA cm−2, respectively; the open circuit voltages (Voc) of the cells were identical at 0.53 V. The single side ARC glass covered cell displays a 4.0% increase in the photogenerated current density compared to the uncoated glass covered cell. This increase matches the relative increase in transmittance of the ARC glass of 4.4%. It is noteworthy that the change in the solar spectrum weighted transmittance of the ARC glass compared to the uncoated glass is similar, indicative of the broadband enhancement. Further, the increase in the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the cell matches the increase in the short circuit current density considering identical Vocs and fill factors. For the double side ARC glass, the increase in photocurrent density is 6.0%, which is lower than the ∼8% increase in optical transmittance, probably due to a greater index mismatch in the silicon-ARC interface than in the silicon–glass interface. The EQE spectrum of cell configuration B (Fig. 7 inset) corroborates the broadband enhancement in transmittance for a single interface 3 layer ARC (Fig. 5a) with a 3.2–4.1% increase.

Conclusions
We have investigated the implementation of nano-length scale variation of the refractive index through the control of porosity in discrete nanoparticle layers. Specifically, we have demonstrated a facile technique whereby discrete porosity modulated silica nanoparticle layers can be deposited in sequence on a substrate. Using this method, we have shown that a single 3 layer nanoparticle ARC on glass increases the average transmittance from 91% to 95.2% while the application of two 3 layer ARCs on both glass interfaces yields an average transmittance of 99.0% and peak transmittance of 99.5%. In addition to wavelength broadening, the average transmittances at angular incidences are close to optimized values. The porosity tuned nanoparticle ARCs developed in this work exhibit transmittances comparable to vacuum-based GLAD9 and nano-lithography18 fabricated nano-structures. This technique offers a simple alternative to tuning of the optical index and is potentially amenable to a wide range of optoelectronic applications.
The ability to produce discrete porous multilayer films in a facile manner has wider implications beyond the fabrication of multilayer ARCs. For example, graded porous structures can be used in capacitors, catalytic applications, etc. Further, it is also possible to produce a highly porous layer sandwiched between two standard (porogen-free) nanoparticle layers as illustrated in Fig. 8. These hollowed out nanostructures can find various applications in micro-fluidics, optical waveguiding and composite material based applications.

 	Fig. 1  An illustration of the spin-coating sequence for a multilayer ARC. (1) Cleaned glass substrate; (2) polystyrene-free silica solution on glass; (3) 20 nm diameter PS solution on the silica layer; (4) SiO2–PS mixture on the 20 nm PS intermediate layer; (5) 20 nm PS solution on the first SiO2–PS layer; and (6) second SiO2–PS mixture on the 20 nm PS layer. Illustration is not to scale.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Refractive indices of single-layer silica films as a function of the PS–SiO2 solution mass ratio for a range of pre-dilutions (SiO2–DI water = 1:0 to 1:7). The solid lines are visual guides. Inset: the refractive indices as a function of the estimated PS–SiO2 particle ratio. (b) Physical thicknesses of single-layer silica films as a function of the PS–SiO2 solution mass ratio for a range of pre-dilutions (SiO2–DI water = 1:0 to 1:7). The solid lines are visual guides. Film thicknesses were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Inset: the thickness as a function of the estimated PS–SiO2 particle ratio. (c) Pore size distributions in silica nanoparticle films with increasing PS–SiO2 solution mass ratios. The pre-dilution of the silica solution is 1:1 for the all the films. Inset: porosity of nanoparticle films as a function of the PS–SiO2 solution mass ratio.
