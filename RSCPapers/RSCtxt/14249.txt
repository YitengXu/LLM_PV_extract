    , Accepted 23rd December 2021First published on 23rd December 2021AbstractTypically, DMSO and DMF are the two most commonly used co-solvents; however, their boiling points differ greatly and the volatilization rate is not consistent when the film is annealed and crystallized, which leads to the inhomogeneity of the components. Herein, the hydrogen isotope effect (HIE) is produced by introducing N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 (DMF-d7) into the CsPbI3 precursor solution for the first time. The introduction of deuterium affects the intermolecular interaction between the solvent molecules and Pb2+, and ameliorates the undesirable situation of excessive uncoordinated Pb2+ remaining on the surface of the film. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized device reached 18.55%. The characterization of the film structure, morphology, and components demonstrates that the addition of DMF-d7 improves the quality of the film. More importantly, according to the apparent change in the atomic ratios of Cs and Pb (Cs/Pb), we speculate that different film crystallization rates eventually lead to two different crystallization termination surfaces, i.e., with PbI2 or CsI, and illustrate their effects on the properties of the film by ab initio simulations. Overall, this study developed a novel solvent system that provides a promising method for the fabrication of high-quality CsPbI3 films.
Introduction
As a star material, perovskites have become the best candidate for the light-absorbing layer of next-generation solar cells, which is mainly determined by their excellent photoelectric properties.1–3 The most shocking thing is that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased at a rocket-like speed from the initial 3.8% to the current 25.5% in the past decade or so.4 Nevertheless, in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, the organic components, namely, methylamine (MA) or formamidine (FA), easily volatilize and migrate when exposed to high temperature and light, resulting in poor PSCs stability.5,6
Fortunately, as an effective alternative, all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) can improve the thermal stability of PSCs.7–9 However, compared with organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, the PCE of all-inorganic PSCs is lower.10,11 A very limited part of the challenge may be due to their large band gap. The main challenge is to fabricate high-quality perovskite films, which is a problem faced by the entire field of PSCs.12–15 As is well-known, the key to obtaining high-quality perovskite films is rapid nucleation and slow crystallization.16,17 Accordingly, modulating the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films to achieve high-quality film preparation is the general consensus to improve the performance of PSCs.18 Many effective strategies have been developed to improve the film quality, such as solvent engineering,19 intermediate engineering,20 anti-solvent engineering,21 and solvent atmosphere annealing.22 Among them, solvent engineering only adds other solvent components with different coordination abilities to the perovskite precursor solution,23 changing the Lewis acid–base binding force between the solute and the solvent molecules, and slowing down the crystallization speed of the film.24 At the same time, the simple preparation process of the perovskite film is retained to the greatest extent, so it is widely used in the preparation of high-quality perovskite films.25,26 The two most common solvents in solvent engineering are dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).27 Zhu et al. and Huang et al. applied them to 2D perovskites to adjust the crystal orientation;28 Lee et al. and Latifah et al. applied them to adjust the growth of perovskite films to obtain a larger grain size and a better film morphology.29
Nevertheless, this method has two unavoidable drawbacks. On the one hand, DMSO and DMF differ greatly in the boiling points (DMSO: 189 °C, DMF: 153 °C), which directly leads to the inconsistency of the solvent volatilization rate during the growth of the thin film, and ultimately leads to the inhomogeneity of the components in the film.30 On the other hand, the polarities of DMSO and DMF are different, resulting in the different coordination abilities of solvent molecules with Pb2+ in the precursor solution. Therefore, the release rate of Pb2+ during the annealing process will be different, and it may lead to the remaining Pb2+ (or Pb0) without participating in the reaction of the final film.31
In this work, to avoid the adverse effects of two (or more) solvents with completely different chemical and physical properties as co-solvents, we consider using the hydrogen isotope effect (HIE, i.e., the phenomenon of differences in physical and chemical properties due to different elemental masses),32 adding N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 (DMF-d7) to the CsPbI3 precursor solution with DMF as the solvent to slow down the crystallization rate of the film during annealing. It should be emphasized that DMF-d7 and DMF have exactly the same boiling point, and the only difference is that deuterium atoms replace all hydrogen atoms. Due to the regulation of the film crystallization kinetics by the HIE, a high-quality CsPbI3 film with no pinholes, fewer defects and a smoother surface is obtained. Finally, an optimum DMF-d7 concentration of 1% (volume ratio) in the perovskite precursor solution yields the champion PCE of 18.55% compared to 17.36% of the pristine PSCs without DMF-d7.
Result and discussion
The molecular structures of DMSO, DMF, and DMF-d7 are shown in Fig. 1a. Owing to the presence of deuterium atoms (D) in the DMF-d7 molecule, the solvent–solute interaction force will be changed, which slows down the crystallization rate of the perovskite film during annealing.32 The detailed experimental procedure is described in the ESI,† and the corresponding schematic diagrams of the spin-coating and annealing processes of a perovskite film are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the state changes of CsPbI3 films with different DMF-d7 concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10%) during annealing. The formation process of the perovskite film can be divided into two stages, namely, (i) the intermediate formation stage and (ii) the intermediate to the perovskite phase transition stage. Obviously, under the same annealing conditions, the addition of DMF-d7 significantly shortens the time taken by the CsPbI3 perovskite films to turn from yellow to brown but extends the time taken by the films to turn completely black. It implies that the addition of DMF-d7 accelerates the nucleation speed and prolongs the crystallization time of the film (i.e., slowing down the crystallization rate). It can be attributed to the fact that, as a Lewis base additive, DMF-d7 has a strong intermolecular interaction with the ions in the precursor solution, which prolongs the existence time of the intermediate, and ultimately leads to a prolonged phase transition time. To explore the effect of DMF-d7 on the phase structure of the CsPbI3 perovskite film, we tested the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the films with different DMF-d7 concentrations. All the films show almost identical diffraction peaks and two obvious peak positions at 14.33° and 28.89°, which are respectively consistent with the (110) and (220) planes of CsPbI3 (Fig. 1b).33 Therefore, this demonstrates that DMF-d7 has no effect on the phase structure of the CsPbI3 perovskite film.

According to the reports in the literature, nucleation and crystallization speed have a crucial influence on the quality of the film.16,17Fig. 2a and b illustrate the effect of different DMF-d7 concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10%) on the morphology of the CsPbI3 perovskite film. It can be confirmed that the addition of DMF-d7 makes the perovskite film smoother, which is manifested by the increase of the contact angle to water (Fig. 2a inset), along with a more uniform and larger grain size. When the concentration of DMF-d7 is 1%, the film has the largest grain size and contact angle. The above results are based on nucleation and crystal growth. On the one hand, the addition of DMF-d7 accelerates the nucleation speed of the perovskite film during annealing, and nucleation sites are more homogeneous in the film. One of strong evidence is the better uniformity of grain size in the added DMF-d7 films, while in the pristine films there is clearly non-uniform grain size, which may be caused by the release rate of Pb2+; on the other hand, during further crystallization, the HIE slows down the crystallization speed, thereby obtaining a high-quality film with a smoother and larger grain size. These results are in agreement with the observation in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

As the central hub of photoelectric conversion in PSCs, the optical properties of perovskite films have a significant impact on the final device performance. Fig. 3a and b show the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra (UV-Vis) and photoluminescence spectra (PL) of perovskite films on a glass substrate with four different DMF-d7 concentrations, respectively. The absorption cut-off edges of the four kinds of perovskite films are all around 730 nm, implying the good use of sunlight. All the films exhibit red emission at around 725 nm under 550 nm excitation. Obviously, with the increase in DMF-d7 concentration, the absorption and emission bands show a blue-shift, which will be discussed later. The perovskite film containing 1% DMF-d7 shows the strongest emission intensity, which may be due to the optimal crystallization kinetic conditions when the film is annealed and crystallized at this additive concentration, and a high-quality perovskite film is prepared. Trap-assisted non-radiative recombination is significantly reduced, and the population of free charge carriers improved, which will have a positive impact on the final PSC performance.34–36 To gain deeper insight into the non-radiative recombination behavior of carriers inside the perovskite film after adding DMF-d7, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was carried out (Fig. 3c and Fig. S3, ESI†); the decay curves are fitted with a three-exponential function and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The calculated carrier lifetimes (τave) of films with 0%, 1%, 5% and 10% DMF-d7 concentrations are 3.29 ns, 3.52 ns, 5.55 ns and 5.94 ns, respectively. The results reveal that the addition of DMF-d7 decreases the concentration of defect states inside the film, and facilitates the extraction and transmission of carriers, which mutually corroborate the conclusions obtained from PL spectroscopy.

It has been reported in the literature that isotopic substitution occurs in the perovskite lattice and has an important effect on its properties.34 To study the effect of DMF-d7 on the film chemical composition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was implemented. As shown in Fig. 3d, the FTIR spectrum of the pristine perovskite film contains peaks at around 1460 cm−1 (N–H bending), 3137 cm−1 (N–H stretching), and 3437 cm−1 (N–H stretching).34,37 Meanwhile, after introducing DMF-d7, there is a slight red-shift in the FTIR spectrum compared with the pristine film, which may be due to a change in the bond energy as a result of hydrogen–deuterium (H–D) exchange (Fig. 4a).38 Simultaneously, these results also prove that an ultra-small amount of dimethylammonium (DMA+) exists in the perovskite film that has been annealed at high temperatures.10 Ideally, the structure is most stable when the tolerance factor (t) is 1. It is generally believed that when t is between 0.81 and 1.11, a perovskite structure can be formed, and the size of DMA+ (2.72 Å) is larger than Cs+ (1.88 Å). Using DMA+ and Cs+ as cations to form perovskite structures with t of 1.026 and 0.851, respectively. Thereby, the DMA+ replacing part of Cs+ will release the lattice stress to improve the stability of CsPbI3 (Fig. 4a).39,40

Subsequently, to further explore the effect of the addition of DMF-d7 on the surface chemical element state of the perovskite film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was implemented. Fig. 4b shows the survey spectra, and the characteristic lines for C, Cs, Pb and I are clearly presented. In the high-resolution spectra of N 1s (Fig. 4c), there are faint signal peaks of N 1s at about 402.3 eV, confirming that the final perovskite crystal frame has doped DMA+. However, the peaks of N 1s are completely invisible in Fig. 4b, because the doping amount of DMA+ is extremely small. The N 1s signal peak can be perfectly fitted to a single peak in the pristine film. Meanwhile, the signal peaks of N 1s in films with different DMF-d7 concentrations can be fitted by two peaks, which may be due to the different chemical environments of the N element (N–H and N–D) and further verified the characterization results of FTIR. The high-resolution spectrum of Pb 4f shows two dominant peaks at about 138.2 (Pb2+–4f7/2) and 143.1 eV (Pb2+–4f5/2) (Fig. 4d). The addition of DMF-d7 makes the signal peak of the Pb element shift to the direction of low binding energy, which indicates that the addition of DMF-d7 makes the chemical binding force of Pb and other more electronegative elements (fluorine or oxygen) weaker. Moreover, there are also two small peaks at lower binding energies of 136.8 and 141.6 eV in the blank contrast, indicating the unsaturated coordinated Pb2+ clusters in the blank contrast film.41–44 The high-resolution spectrum of Cs 3d shows a similar trend to that of Pb 4f (Fig. S4a, ESI†), and similar conclusions can be drawn. The high-resolution spectrum of I 3d is shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†). With the addition of DMF-d7, the binding energy increases, which may be due to the enhanced binding with Pb.
Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the Raman spectra of perovskite films with different DMF-d7 additions. For the pristine film, there are two peaks at 145 and 285 cm−1, which can be attributed to the presence of PbO in the film;45–47 while for the films with DMF-d7 addition, the intensity of the peak at 145 cm−1 is significantly weakened, and the peak at 285 cm−1 disappears completely, implying the reduction of PbO content inside the film. As a result, the introduction of DMF-d7 could reduce the content of PbO. In addition, according to the XPS characterization results (atomic%), the addition of DMF-d7 obviously increases the atomic ratio of Cs and Pb (Cs/Pb) on the film surface (Fig. S6, ESI†). This may be attributed to the change in the crystallization rate caused by the HIE, alleviating the Pb2+ enrichment on the film surface due to the excessive volatilization rate of the solvent. We speculate that different crystallization rates will result in two crystallization termination surfaces in the films, i.e., the PbI2- or CsI-terminated surface (Fig. 5a and d).48,49 Specifically, perovskite films generally crystallize in a top-down order.50 When the film is annealed, the solvent on the air side is easily volatilized, so excessive Pb2+ is released, resulting in incomplete coordination with I−. However, the addition of DMF-d7 changes the solvent–solute intermolecular interaction force,51 and regulates the release rate of Pb2+ to a certain extent, and alleviates the above-mentioned undesirable conditions. For the film with PbI2 as the crystallization termination surface, the uncoordinated Pb2+ exposed to the surrounding environment is easily combined with oxygen molecules to form PbO, while for the film with CsI as the crystallization termination surface, Pb2+ coordinated with I− and is not easy to form PbO.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the electron band structure of two crystal termination surfaces of CsPbI3 films: (a) PbI2-terminated diagram b and c band structure without/with oxygen doping; (d) CsI-terminated diagram e and f band structure with/without oxygen doping. 
Different crystallization termination surfaces will affect the band structure of the film and the diffusion of molecules in the environment into the film. Therefore, to investigate the effect of the two crystallization termination surfaces on the energy level structure of the films, calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The corresponding energy level structures are shown in Fig. 5b (PbI2-terminated) and Fig. 5e (CsI-terminated) with band gaps of 1.36 and 1.51 eV, respectively, which exactly verifies the slight blue-shift phenomenon in the preceding absorption and luminescence spectra (Fig. 3a and b).52 In addition, it has been reported in the literature that oxygen molecules (O2) can also enter the perovskite lattice by diffusion and combine with the photogenerated electrons to form superoxide negative ions (O2−), which will accelerate the degradation of perovskite films.53,54 The formation of O2− is due to the diffusion of oxygen molecules into the film to form a defect level (oxygen level), and the valence band electrons are excited to transition to the defect level. The difficulty degree of O2− formation is related to the relative position of the oxygen level.49 As shown in Fig. 5c and f, the differences between the oxygen level and valence band (VBM) energy are 0.92 and 1.13 eV for the two films, respectively. This indicates that the energy required for the photogenerated electrons to jump from the VBM to the oxygen level is smaller and relatively easier in the films with PbI2 as the crystallization termination surface, while the opposite is true for the films with CsI as the crystallization termination surface.
The PSCs were fabricated using the prepared film as the photoactive layers. From the current density–voltage (J–V) curve, in Fig. 6a, it is obvious that the optimized PSCs with 1% DMF-d7 obtains a champion PCE of 18.55% with a high FF of 80.43, while the pristine PSC gives only 17.36%. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the optimized and pristine cells are listed in Table 1. The integrated JSC values from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are 19.50 and 18.69 mA cm−2 for the optimized and pristine devices (Fig. 6b), which are in good agreement with the J–V measurements. As presented in Fig. 6c, to ensure the reliability of the J–V measurement, the PCEs of the optimized PSCs were recorded as a function of time with the bias voltage at VMP values (voltage at the maximum power point). The optimized PSC exhibited very stable performances. Measured for 200 s, the optimized champion PSCs exhibited a PCE of 18.19%, which was very close to the J–V measurements. Fig. 6d shows the PCE statistical distribution of 15 individual PSCs. The optimized PSCs (1% DMF-d7) exhibit the highest average PCE, which indicates that this process is reproducible. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the stability of the blank and optimized devices. After being placed in dry air for 15 days, they all showed significant degradation, which indicates that the addition of DMF-d7 did not significantly affect the stability of the device.

To investigate the trap-state density in the CsPbI3 layers, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed. Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†) show J–V curves the electron-only and hole-only devices respetively, a kink point voltage defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). The defect density (Ndefects) is calculated according to the equation:55Ndefects = (2εε0VTFL)/(eL2)where Ndefects is calculated to be 5.82 × 1015 cm−3 (electron-only) and 9.71 × 1015 cm−3 (hole-only) for the optimized film, which is lower than the pristine film (electron-only: 16.94 × 1015 cm−3 and hole-only: 18.10 × 1015 cm−3). The reduced Ndefects is ascribed to the improved film quality, which is consistent with the PL and TRPL results. Fig. 6e shows the dependence of VOC on various light intensities (I). The slopes were derived from the lines fitted linearly to the data according to the equation: VOC ∝ nKT/qln(I).56 The PSCs with 1% DMF-d7 addition exhibit a slope of 1.38 KT/q, which is close to KT/q and much smaller than that of the pristine PSCs (1.96 KT/q). The smaller value suggests that the trap-assisted recombination is suppressed in the optimized PSCs, which could also be ascribed to the enhanced crystallinity of the optimized film as discussed above. The dependence of JSC on the illumination intensity curves is shown in Fig. 6f, and the results can be expressed as JSC ∝ Iα.57 The smaller α value for the 1% DMF-d7 additive PSCs (1.24) than the pristine PSCs (1.30) indicates lower charge recombination. In a word, based on the above defect state characterization, it is determined that the addition of DMF-d7 will indeed improve the quality of the film, reduce the defect state concentration, and have a positive impact on the device performance.
Conclusion
In summary, we discovered the potential of DMF-d7 as an additive (generating the HIE) for the first time to enhance the performance of CsPbI3 based PSCs. The performance of CsPbI3 based PSC along with the crystallization quality significantly increases with an increase in the DMF-d7 concentration, showing peaks at around the optimal 1% concentration. Specifically, the generation of the HIE changes the crystallization kinetics process of the perovskite film, accelerates the nucleation rate, and slows down the growth rate. Moreover, the addition of DMF-d7 or not will affect the coordination of Pb2+ on the surface of the film, showing sufficient coordination in the optimized film (CsI-terminated), but insufficient coordination in the pristine film (PbI2-terminated), which will further affect the combination and diffusion of the molecules in the environment into the film. In short, we developed a novel and simple approach to improve the photovoltaic properties of CsPbI3 based PSCs.
