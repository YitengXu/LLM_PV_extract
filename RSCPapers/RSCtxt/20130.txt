    , Accepted 24th November 2020First published on 24th November 2020AbstractCapacitors began their journey in 1745, and to date have advanced in the form of supercapacitors. Supercapacitors are one of the advanced forms of capacitors with higher energy density, bridging capacitors and batteries. The energy storage through the formation of an electrical double layer is pivotal for supercapacitor technology. Accordingly, to further improve the energy density, surface faradaic (pseudocapacitive) processes are employed, and henceforth, the journey of chemical supercapacitors commenced. Herein, the materials, mechanisms and fabrication of chemical supercapacitors based on metallic compounds and conducting polymers are discussed in detail. The inherent limitations of these materials are addressed, and the feasible mitigation measures are identified. Poor conductivity, slow diffusion kinetics and rapid structural disintegration over cycling are the common constraints of metallic compounds, which can be overcome by preparing conductive nanocomposites. Thus, versatile conductive nanocomposites of metal oxides, hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, phosphates, phosphites, and chalcogenides are elaborated. A lack of structural integrity is the prime obstacle for the realization of conducting polymer-based supercapacitors, which may be solved by forming composites with robust support from carbonaceous materials or metallic compounds. Consequently, the composites of polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene and polythiophene-derivatives are discussed. The historical accounts of early stages of works are emphasised in order to review the developmental pathways of chemical supercapacitors. The construction of full cells and their performance data are presented herein, which synchronize the behaviour of practical scaled-up devices. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first holistic description of chemical supercapacitors based on metallic compounds and conducting polymers from the first reports to recent advancements.Pappu NaskarMr Pappu Naskar received his BSc Degree (2014) from the University of Calcutta, India, and was awarded an MSc Degree (2017) in Chemistry from Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University, India.

1. What is a capacitor?
There are records1 that German scientist Ewald Georg von Kleist invented the capacitor in November 1745. A couple of months later, Dutch Professor Pieter van Musschenbroek, at the University of Leyden, came up with a similar device in the form of the Leyden jar, which is typically accredited as the first capacitor. Henceforth, the research and development on capacitors have become one of the major research topics in the physical and chemical sciences. A capacitor is a passive electronic module containing a pair of conducting plates disjointed by a dielectric medium. Capacitors accumulate electrical energy as electrostatic charge division with equal amounts of positive and negative charges on opposite faces of the conducting plates. Consequently, a voltage difference is generated between the plates. By connecting two plates with an external load, current flows until complete charge balance is achieved, and the stored energy is entirely delivered. The capacitor can then be recharged by applying voltage from an external power supply. Since the charge is stored physically (non-faradaic) without any chemical/phase changes (faradaic), the charge/discharge schedule is highly reversible, and the service life of a capacitor is virtually unlimited.
The amount of charge (Q) stored in a capacitor is proportional to the system voltage (V), and the proportionality constant (C) is called capacitance, i.e. Q = CV(1)
Reorganizing these terms, C = Q/V(2)
For a capacitor, capacitance (in farad/F) is directly proportional to the geometric area of the plate (A), inversely proportional to the inter-plate separation (d) and also depends on the permittivity of the medium (ε in F m−1). Accordingly, the capacitance of a capacitor is demonstrated by, C = εA/d(3)
For vacuum, the value of absolute permittivity (εo) is 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1.2 For any other material, permittivity (ε) is measured by the multiplication of the relative permittivity (εr) of the material and absolute permittivity (εo).
Accordingly, eqn (3) can be rewritten as, C = εoεr(A/d)(4)
In practice, the capacitance of a capacitor may be estimated from its galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles. For each galvanostatic charge/discharge of the capacitor, its capacitance is estimated from the equation C = It/ΔV(5)where I is the charge/discharge current, t is the charge/discharge time and ΔV is the voltage difference between the initial and final states, respectively.
The electrical energy (E) accumulated in a capacitor is (6)
As the voltage of the capacitor increases from 0 to V, the charge stored on the electrode increases from 0 to Q, and consequently, the accumulated energy E is presented as3 (7)
One of the functional characteristics of a capacitor is its response time or time constant (τ), which is the multiplication of its resistance (R) and capacitance (C). Capacitors with small time constant acquire/deliver energy in a relatively short time, while those with high time constant charge/discharge over a relatively longer time. Hence, the maximum power4 (rate of energy acquiring or delivering, expressed in watt) of a capacitor is evaluated from the ratio of energy (watt-second) and response time (second).
The equivalent circuit diagram of a capacitor is shown in Fig. 1, which is constructed by three components, i.e. the capacitance (C), equivalent series resistance (ESR) and equivalent parallel resistance (EPR). The ESR represents the resistive loss through internal heating of the capacitor. The EPR of a capacitor is linked with the leakage current, which impacts the self-discharge voltage loss. There is no self-discharge of an ideal capacitor. Nevertheless, self-discharge is the most common phenomenon for all practical capacitors due to thermal randomization of dipoles and parasitic processes through the dielectric medium. The self-discharge rate of a capacitor is measured by the float (leakage) current across the device terminals in the fully charged state. To preserve 100% state-of-charge, the float current counteracts the self-discharge voltage loss.5

2. The journey from capacitors to supercapacitors
2.1. Classification of capacitors
Based on the response time or time constant (τ), capacitors can be classified into three broad groups,6 namely, electrostatic capacitors, electrolytic capacitors and electrochemical capacitors. The utility of each group is unique in real life applications. Electrostatic capacitors7 consist of dielectric media, such as air, mica, polymer films, and ceramics, sandwiched between two conducting electrodes. These capacitors function in the GHz frequency range and are characterized by lowest capacitance values among of the three groups. Electrolytic capacitors8 are polarized capacitors that employ suitable electrolytes (solid, liquid or gel) to achieve greater energy (∼10 times higher) than former. These capacitors can usually be operated at a frequency of up to ∼20 kHz. The operating principle of an electrochemical capacitor is based on the formation of an electrical double-layer (EDL). It is acknowledged that an EDL is generated at the electrode/electrolyte interface by physical charge separation. The EDL9 may extend to about a few angstroms (Å), and stores electrostatic energy like a capacitor. The capacitance values of electrochemical capacitors are appreciably high compared to the other two groups, and thus can be envisaged for possible energy storage applications. On the contrary, by the virtue of their high frequency responses, electrostatic and electrolytic capacitors have immense applications in electrical/electronic engineering. The construction and characteristic of these three different types of capacitors are depicted in Fig. 2.

2.2. Why electrochemical capacitors are termed super (or ultra) capacitors?
It is evident from eqn (4) that the capacitance of a capacitor can be enhanced by increasing its surface area and decreasing the distance between its two oppositely charged layers. In electrochemical capacitors, the formation of an EDL is the origin of the capacitance, while, the charge-separation distance in the EDL is in molecular dimensions, i.e., less than 10−9 m. On the other hand, high surface area (∼106 m2 kg−1) activated carbons are conventionally used as active materials for electrochemical capacitors. The relative permittivity or dielectric constant at the primary adsorption polarized solvent layer (water medium) is nearly 6.10 Hence, the capacitance of electrochemical capacitors will be (6 × 8.8 × 10−12 × 106)/10−9, i.e. ∼104 F kg−1.11–14 Due to the high value (many thousands of farad) of capacitance, electrochemical capacitors are termed supercapacitors or ultracapacitors. Fig. 3(a–d) depict the electrochemical cell construction, respective equivalent circuit, microscopic illustration of the EDL and potential gradient in the EDL for typical supercapacitors, respectively.9,10

Between the electrode and OHP region is a compact-layer (∼1 nm separation) and beyond the OHP is termed the diffuse layer. The variation in the relative permittivity at different positions of the EDL in aqueous electrolyte is mentioned in the blue box, and the value at the metallic electrode surface is infinity. (d) Potential (mV) gradient in EDL: Φm, Φ1, Φ2 and Φd represent the potentials at the metallic substrate, IHP, OHP and diffuse-layer.10 
2.3. Classification of supercapacitors
Mechanistically, supercapacitors are classified into two groups, namely, electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors. In his path-finding book, namely, ‘Electrochemical supercapacitors: scientific fundamentals and technological applications’9 Conway stated that “Regular double layer capacitance arises from the potential-dependence of the surface density of charges stored electrostatically (i.e., non-faradaically) at the interfaces of the capacitor electrodes. Pseudocapacitance arises at the electrode surfaces, where a completely different charge-storage mechanism applies. It is faradaic in origin, involving the passage of charge across the double layer, as in battery charging or discharging, but capacitance arises due to the special relation that can originate for thermodynamic reasons between the extent of charge acceptance (Δq) and change in potential (ΔV), and thus the derivative d(Δq)/d(ΔV) or dq/dV, which is equivalent to capacitance, can be formulated and experimentally measured by the dc, ac, or transient techniques”. Therefore, non-faradaic (capacitive) physical charge separation through the formation of an EDL is the operating principle of EDLC-type supercapacitors. Diverse carbonaceous materials, such as activated carbon (AC), carbon black (CB), graphite, graphene (single and multi-layer), graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT and MWCNT), carbon nanofibers (CNF), carbon nanorods, are employed in EDLC devices.15,16 On the other hand, pseudocapacitors operated with surface-controlled pseudo-faradaic (pseudocapacitive) charge storage mechanisms. In the 1990s, Conway and his group identified two distinct pseudocapacitive processes, i.e., redox pseudocapacitance and intercalation pseudocapacitance.9 The former occurs when ions are specifically adsorbed on the electrode surface by electrochemical means and participate in faradaic charge-transfer between the electrode/electrolyte interface. The latter occurs when ions intercalate/deintercalate in/from the redox active host frameworks associated with faradaic electron-transfer devoid of crystallographic phase changes. Various conducting polymers, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, phosphates, phosphites, chalcogenides, etc. are conventionally utilized in pseudocapacitors.17–21 Unlike surface-controlled pseudo-faradaic process, the faradaic charge-transfer process is directed by diffusion-controlled mass-transfer limitations, which occurs in the bulk of the active materials of the electrode.9,22,23 Importantly, all battery technologies are developed based on faradaic charge-transfer mechanisms, which are responsible for their large energy storage capacity and low power capability. In contrast, due to the surface-controlled operating processes, EDLCs and pseudocapacitors are characterized by high power capability with lower energy storage capacity. In practical electrochemical energy storage systems, the diffusion-controlled faradaic processes and surface-controlled non-faradaic/pseudo-faradaic processes coexist with varying proportions. Eventually, the contributory diffusion-controlled and surface-controlled processes can be qualitatively and quantitatively analysed via cyclic voltammetry, which are depicted by eqn (8) and (9), respectively.24 i = aυb(8) i(υ) = k1υ + k2υ1/2(9)where i and υ are the current response and scan rate, respectively, and a and b are characteristic constants. b = 0.5 indicates a diffusion-controlled faradaic process according to the Randles–Sevcik equation, whereas, b = 1 suggests surface-controlled non-faradaic/pseudo-faradaic processes. k1 and k2 are the coefficients related to the surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled mechanisms, respectively.
Construction-wise, supercapacitors are categorized in three different classes, namely, EDLC, pseudocapacitor and hybrid supercapacitor. The possible materials and mechanisms of EDLCs and pseudocapacitors are mentioned above. These can be constructed by either symmetric (employing the same material in both electrodes) or asymmetric (employing different materials in different electrodes) configurations. Moreover, the coupling of an EDLC and pseudocapacitor is also designated as an asymmetric supercapacitor. On the other hand, hybrid supercapacitors25 are constructed via the smart coupling of battery electrodes (diffusion-controlled) with capacitive/pseudocapacitive electrodes (surface-controlled). Therefore, the power and energy characteristics of hybrid supercapacitors can be tuned by optimization of the non-faradaic, pseudo-faradaic and faradaic contributions towards total charge storage. However, according to the operating principles, EDLC is identified as a physical supercapacitor, whereas, pseudocapacitors and hybrid supercapacitors can be considered chemical supercapacitors.
3. Materials, construction and characterization of chemical supercapacitors
In the pseudocapacitive arena, materials having reversible electron transfer capability between their oxidised and reduced forms with minimal charge-transfer and mass-transfer resistances can be used as active materials. Additionally, materials should have chemical, electrochemical and thermal stability within the operating windows. During prolonged charge and discharge, permanent deformations in the active materials are unavoidable, but these permanent structural disintegrations should be initiated after hundreds to thousands of cycles for commercially successful devices. Thus, based on the abovementioned criteria, only a few classes of materials exhibit potential for pseudocapacitive applications, including conducting polymers, metal oxides, hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, phosphates, phosphites, and chalcogenides. Among the different metallic compounds, RuO2, MnOx, NiO, CoOx, VOx, FeOx, Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH), NiFe-LDH, Ti3C2, TiC, VN, TiN, Ni2P, Ni2P2O7, Co3(PO4)2, NiHPO3, MoS2, WS2, and Co0.85Se exhibit promising performances18–21 in terms of capacitance, energy density and operational life. These materials are extremely stable and robust under the operating conditions. On the other hand, conducting polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTh) and derivatives of PTh, are important candidates for pseudocapacitive applications because of their high conductivity, high capacitance, environmental benign nature, low cost and flexibility.17 These chemical supercapacitors are mostly assembled in aqueous media with few exceptions, whereas organic media and ionic liquids (ILs) are employed.9,17,18 As an aqueous system, the full cell voltage is thermodynamically limited at 1.23 V due to the breakdown of water molecules.26 At different electrode surfaces, the overpotential values for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions kinetically deviate from thermodynamic standards, and hence, the full cell voltage can be varied from the exact value of 1.23 V. In reality, the device voltage kinetically varies from 1 to 1.5 V (upper limit may increase up to 1.8 V in a few instances) for different materials in acidic and alkaline media, except, Pb-based systems, which exhibit ∼2 V in acidic media.2,9 On the other hand, surface insertion/deinsertion-mediated aqueous pseudocapacitors are used to fabricate cells in neutral media, and the full cells exhibit an ∼2 V rated voltage due to the higher overpotentials of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.9 However, safe and hazard-free devices result from aqueous media by compromising the higher voltage limits (above 2.5 V) and higher energy densities compared to that in nonaqueous media. On the other hand, high power characteristics are achieved in aqueous systems because of the higher ionic mobility in water medium compared to organic solvents.27
Recently, a new class of materials, namely, metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs), are considered for pseudocapacitive systems28 due to their diverse scaffold structures, flexible pore sizes, large surface area (>6000 m2 g−1), and abundant metallic redox sites. In 1995, Yaghi29 defined MOFs as crystalline coordination polymers produced via self-assembly, resulting in a highly structured infinite network. These coordination polymers consist of metal ions or ion clusters and organic ligands connected through coordination bonds, auxiliary hydrogen-bonds, π–π stacking, metallic bonding or van der Walls forces. In the case of MOFs, their specialized interconnected pore channels permit efficient electrolyte infiltration, which shortens the diffusion pathways of electrolyte ions, and hence, fast kinetics is achieved. However, besides metallic compounds, conducting polymers and MOFs, a few other advanced multifunctional materials may be applied in chemical supercapacitors, including covalent-organic-frameworks (COFs),30,31 heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials,32–35 bio-waste-derived carbons with redox functionalities,36,37 black phosphorous,38 mixed conductors,39 perovskite nanoparticles,40 polyoxometalates (POMs),41,42 and redox active electrolytes.43–45 Nevertheless, this review focuses on metallic compounds and conducting polymers for the construction of chemical supercapacitors.
Device construction is carried out with optimized electrodes, electrolytes, current-collectors, separators and other passive components upon their successful characterization using various electrochemical tools, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear swipe voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), chronoamperometry, and Tafel polarization. The key parameter of a good performance full cell is the charge balance (Qpos = Qneg) between its positive and negative electrodes, and thus an optimized mass balance between these two electrodes is essential. The mass balance formulism is represented as eqn (10). Mpos/Mneg = (Cneg × ΔVneg)/(Cpos × ΔVpos)(10)where M, C and ΔV are the mass, specific capacitance and operating voltage range for each electrode, respectively. The four major performance parameters of an energy storage device, namely, specific capacity/capacitance, energy density, power density and durability are emphasised herein since these characteristics are a matter-of-concern for end-users. The formulas to determine the energy density (E/W h kg−1) and power density (P/W kg−1) of a supercapacitor device are as follows:46 (11) (12)where Ccell, V and t are the specific capacitance (F g−1), rated voltage (V) and discharge time (h), respectively.
or47 (13) (14) (15)where I, m, t, Vmax and Vmin are the applied current (A), mass (kg), discharge time (s), maximum and minimum voltages (V) of operation, respectively.
4. Chemical supercapacitors based on metallic compounds
Minimally diffusion limited reversible surface-faradaic reactions, which are distinctly different from battery-type bulk-faradaic reactions, are the realization of pseudocapacitive mechanisms. In 1971, the pseudocapacitive characteristics were first recognized on RuO2 films through nearly rectangular CV in 1 M HClO4 electrolyte by Trasatti and Buzzanca.48 These authors interpreted the electrochemical behaviour of the RuO2 films in terms of hydration-driven non-stoichiometry. In the hydrous oxide, Ru3+ is balanced by the protons in its lattice according to the following reaction. RuO2 + xe− + xH+ → RuO2−x(OH)x(16)
In 1974, Galizzioli, Tantardini and Trasatti49 published further detailed electrochemical studies on RuO2 films together with possible mechanisms. Here, the authors identified the reversible redox reactions of RuO2 in acidic medium as follows: 2RuO2 + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ Ru2O3 + H2O(17)
In acidic medium, RuO2 rapidly equilibrates with protons at the interface and demonstrates the initial rest voltage of 0.94 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Nonetheless, in open circuit conditions, the voltage decreases to 0.74 vs. NHE due to time-dependent self-discharge. In the case of the surface of RuO2 films, eqn (18) is the preferable representation, instead of eqn (17), as the true scenario. RuO2 + H+ + e− ↔ RuOOH(18)
The Gibbs formation energy of RuO2 depicts a value of 0.43 V vs. NHE, which signifies the following reaction: RuO2 + 4H+ + 4e− ↔ Ru + 2H2O(19)
Notably, 0.43 V is not the stationary potential in acidic medium because RuO2 hardly reduces to metallic state under a negative sweep in CV. However, the non-stoichiometry, availability of several successive redox states (+2, +3, +4 and even +6) and high electronic conductivity (order of 104 ohm−1 cm−1) are primarily responsible for good pseudocapacitance of RuO2 electrodes. After the initial work of Trasatti,48,49 Conway and co-workers50,51 demonstrated the pseudocapacitive behaviours of RuO2 films that were anodically synthesized on metallic Ru at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.05–1.40 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in aqueous H2SO4 solution. The CV responses of the anodically formed RuO2 films were found to be more reversible compared to the thermally formed RuO2 films reported by Trasatti and co-workers. Soon after the publication by Conway et al.,50 in 1975, the Ottawa group developed the first RuO2-based commercial supercapacitors in collaboration with Continental Group Inc.9 Additionally, IrO2, WO3, MoO3, Co3O4 and molybdenum nitrides also exhibit pseudocapacitance in aqueous medium via a similar mechanism to that of RuO2.52,53 Nevertheless, these materials show a lower potential range (0.8 V vs. RHE) than that of RuO2. In 1997, Miller et al.54 synthesized a high surface area (434.5 m2 g−1) Ru/carbon aerogel composite electrode, where the electrochemically oxidized Ru particles provided pseudocapacitance and drastically improved the specific capacitance of the aerogel. The composite electrode showed a specific capacitances of 206 F g−1 in contrast to 95 F g−1 for the pristine aerogel at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.8 V vs. standard calomel electrode (SCE) in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The development of pseudocapacitors started from the abovementioned pioneering works, and consequently, today pseudocapacitors have a significant contribution in the energy storage sector. In modern science, the arena of pseudocapacitors is expanding from metal oxides to other metallic compounds (such as hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, phosphates, phosphites, and chalcogenides), conducting polymers, MOFs, COFs, etc. However, besides a few exceptions, metallic compounds are not adequately conducting to achieve successful pseudocapacitive reactions. Thus, to circumvent this limitation, nanostructuring and the fabrication of composite with conductive matrices are intensively carried out. However, metallic compound-based supercapacitors achieve higher energy densities compared to EDLCs due to the pseudo-faradaic charge storage, while nanostructuring and composites with conductive matrices offer appreciable power densities that are marginally lower than that of EDLCs. Consequently, chemical supercapacitors based on various metallic compounds have attracted commercial attention.
4.1. Metal oxides and composites
The concept of pseudocapacitance originated from a metal oxide, namely RuO2, as previously mentioned. In this section, we will briefly discuss the pseudocapacitance behaviours of various metal oxides and their composites.

4.1.1. Ruthenium oxide and composites. 
The underneath pseudocapacitance mechanisms of RuO2 was further investigated in detail by several researchers. In 1995, Zheng et al.55 proposed a four-step mechanism to determine the pseudocapacitance of hydrous oxide (RuOx·nH2O) as follows: (i) electron hopping within RuOx·nH2O primary particles, (ii) electron hopping between particles, (iii) electron hopping between electrode materials and current collectors, and (iv) proton diffusion within RuOx·nH2O particles. Crystallization reduces the intra-particle electron hopping resistance of RuOx·nH2O, while it increases the diffusion barrier of protons within crystallites and minimizes the active mass utilization.56 Therefore, the highest specific capacitance is achieved when the annealing temperature of nanocrystalline RuOx·nH2O is set slightly below the crystalline temperature.55,57 However, recent research focused on amorphous hydrous RuOx·nH2O thin films for supercapacitor applications due to their high specific capacitance, high conductivity and good cycling stability.58–62 Different methods may be employed for synthesizing amorphous hydrous oxides, such as electrochemical deposition, sol–gel synthesis, spray deposition, hydrothermal synthesis, and oxidative synthesis.59–61 In 1999, Long et al.62 reported a specific capacitance of ∼900 F g−1 for RuO2·0.5H2O (surface area: 75 m2 g−1) at 2 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.8 V vs. SCE in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which decreased to ∼29 F g−1 for RuO2·0.3H2O (surface area: 30 m2 g−1) due to the reduction of the water content in hydrous oxide. Diverse composite materials have been designed to enhance the electrochemical performances of RuO2. In 2001, Kim et al.63 synthesized amorphous RuOx·nH2O/carbon nanocomposites with varying RuOx·nH2O loadings via a colloidal method, where the annealing temperature was set to 100 °C. The optimized composition (40 wt% Ru, surface area: 201 m2 g−1) exhibited a specific capacitance of 407 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.9 V vs. SCE in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The pseudocapacitance contribution from only RuOx·nH2O was calculated to be 863 F g−1 by subtracting the EDL contribution resulting from carbon (Vulcan XC-72 CB) in the composite. The composite material showed only 10% capacitance loss after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Moreover, the constant current (@100 mA cm−2) and constant power (@4000 W kg−1) discharge tests delivered a specific capacitance and energy density of 344 F g−1 and 17.6 W h kg−1, respectively. In 2018, Hong and Yim64 prepared 2D polystyrene (PS)/RuO2 core/shell nanospheres via the electrodeposition of RuO2 nanoparticles on a hexagonal close-packed PS monolayer. The hexagonal close-packed PS monolayer, which was prepared using PS nanospheres with chlorinated surface, was positioned on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate using a scooping transfer technique,65 and then placed in ruthenium chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O) aqueous solution prior to electrodeposition (Fig. 4(a)). The overall reaction for the electrodeposition of RuO2 from the RuCl3 precursor is depicted below. Ru3+ + 4OH− → RuO2·2H2O + e−(20)

The specific capacitance of the PS/RuO2 composite was found to be 65.9 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.3–0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium, while pristine RuO2 showed 33.7 mF cm−2. Furthermore, a symmetric full cell based on the PS/RuO2 composite was assembled and tested through GCD and cycling stability. The specific capacitance was observed to be 14.1 mF cm−2 (i.e., 258 F g−1) at 0.5 mA cm−2 within an operating window of 0–1 V, while the corresponding energy density was determined to be 35.8 W h kg−1. Moreover, the full cell device showed 84.3% capacitance retention after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. Fig. 4(b and c) demonstrate the CV and GCD profiles of the PS/RuO2 composite in three-electrode and two-electrode cell (symmetric) assemblies, respectively. However, the high cost and toxic nature of RuO2 restrict the commercial viability of RuO2-based supercapacitors, even though these supercapacitors show a high energy density together with an appreciable power density and durability.


4.1.2. Manganese oxides and composites. 
Low toxicity, low cost and high pseudocapacitance are the attractive features of manganese oxides for supercapacitive applications, where their pseudocapacitance is attributed to the redox transitions between Mn3+/Mn2+, Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn6+/Mn4+.66 Among the various manganese oxides, such as MnO, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, MnO2, and MnOx, the most used candidate is MnO2 (having α, β, γ, δ and λ-type polymorphs) due to its high theoretical specific capacitance (>1000 F g−1) for the Mn4+/Mn3+ couple. The journey of MnO2-based supercapacitors started from the pioneering work of Lee and Goodenough (1999).67 In this first report, the authors demonstrated the pseudocapacitive behaviours of amorphous MnO2·nH2O in 2 M KCl (aq.) electrolyte in the voltage range of −0.2 and 1.0 V vs. SCE. The specific capacitance achieved was 203 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2, which was maintained for up to 100 charge/discharge cycles. Unlike RuO2, mild aqueous electrolyte, such as KCl, Na2SO4, K2SO4, Li2SO4, and KNO3 are commonly employed in MnO2-based supercapacitors.68 The detail pseudocapacitive mechanisms of MnO2 have been elucidated from in situ and ex situ spectroscopic, morphological and diffraction studies in specific electrochemical conditions, but briefly, a summary of the different mechanisms can be described as follows: (MnO2)surface + A+ + e− ↔ (MnO2–A+)surface (A+: Li+, Na+, K+)67(21) MnO2 + H+ + e− ↔ MnOOH69(22) MnO2 + A+ + e− ↔ MnOOA (A+: Li+, Na+, K+)70(23)
In general, the thick films of MnO2 encounter poor electrical conductivity and slow electrolyte diffusion, and thus provide specific capacitances in lower ranges, i.e., 125 to 250 F g−1.68 By contrast, Broughton and Brett71 (2004) reported the specific capacitance of 700 F g−1 at 160 μA cm−2 in the voltage range of 0–0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte for an MnO2 thin film (loading: ∼75 μg cm−2), which was synthesized via anodic oxidation. Recently, Zhu et al.72 developed a β-MnO2/birnessite core–shell structure (surface area: 64 m2 g−1), where the exposed crystal faces of β-MnO2 were cores and ultrathin (∼5 nm), highly ordered birnessite sheets grown on the surface of β-MnO2 nanorods. The ultrathin birnessite sheets were grown parallel to the c-axis of the β-MnO2 nanorods and formed fin-like nanostructures, which enhanced the effective contacts between the active material and the electrolyte. 2D birnessite can be envisaged for electrochemical energy storage due to the presence of an Mn4+/Mn3+ redox pair and open interlayer channels for effective ion diffusion; however, its poor electrical conductivity limits the utilization of the bulk MnO6 unit. Nevertheless, in the β-MnO2/birnessite core–shell nanostructure, birnessite is situated in the shell region and enjoys the maximum active material utilization, which is not trivial for bulk materials. The nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 306 F g−1 (with 92% coulombic efficiency) based on the total mass of β-MnO2/birnessite and 657 F g−1 based on the birnessite mass in 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte at 0.25 A g−1 and −1 to 0.9 V vs. SCE. An asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated with the β-MnO2/birnessite composite as the positive electrode, activated microwave-expanded GO as the negative electrode and 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) as electrolyte. The device exhibited a specific capacitance of 60.2 F g−1 (@0.25 A g−1), energy density of 40.4 W h kg−1 (@275 W kg−1), power density of 17.6 kW kg−1 (@8.1 W h kg−1) and moderate cycling stability (85.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles @ 0.5 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–2.2 V. The feasibility test of this device was conducted via the illumination of LEDs and the result was optimistic. Jia and co-workers73 fabricated a graphene quantum dot (GQD)/MnO2 heterostructured electrode, which expanded the operating voltage window from 0–1 to 0–1.3 V vs. SCE in aqueous medium. In the GQD/MnO2 heterostructure, GQDs were deposited in situ on MnO2 nanosheets via plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) through the formation of M–O–C covalent bonds. The heterostructure electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 1094 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–1 V in 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte, while the pristine MnO2 nanosheet arrays showed only 393 F g−1. Further, the GQD/MnO2 composite delivered the specific capacitance of 1170 F g−1 within 0–1.3 V under similar conditions. The heterostructure electrode retained 92.7% of its initial specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at a current of 10 mA. Fig. 5(a–c) demonstrate the electrochemical behaviours of the composite electrode in the CV and GCD experiments. An asymmetric device was assembled, comprising the GQD/MnO2 composite as the positive electrode, nitrogen-doped graphene as the negative electrode and 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) as the electrolyte. The device showed a specific capacitance of 160.6 F g−1 (@5 mV s−1), energy density of 118 W h kg−1 (@923 W kg−1) and power density of 12351 W kg−1 (@79 W h kg−1) in the voltage range of 0–2.3 V. To comprehend the effects of GQDs on the capacitance improvement and potential enhancement, the authors proposed a schematic energy band diagram, as shown in Fig. 5. The band-gaps of the GQDs and MnO2 nanosheets were calculated to be 0.6 and 0.25 eV, respectively, which are inversely dependent on the particle size (Fig. 5(d)). Typically, in the GQD/MnO2 heterostructure, an electric field is generated because of their different work-functions (GQDs: 5.2 eV and MnO2: 4.4 eV), and hence, the free electrons will transfer from MnO2 to the GQDs at the interface until the Fermi levels are aligned (Fig. 5(e)). Therefore, the accumulated free electrons on the surface of the GQDs (especially the near edges, shown in Fig. 5(f)) create additional electrostatic attractions with electrolyte ions, which improve the specific capacitances of the heterostructures. The bending of the valence and conduction bands of the GQDs and MnO2 at the interface of the heterostructure generates a potential gradient,74 which counteracts the external electric fields and broadens the potential window for supercapacitors.

Another promising and industrially scalable route for enhancing the electrochemical performance of MnO2-based electrodes is the tuning of Mn point defects and the ratios of Mn3+/Mn4+. In the mid-1980s, P. Ruetschi first developed a comprehensive scheme to correlate cation vacancies with charge storage characteristics for intergrowth MnO2 phases.75–77 It was observed that the cation vacancies reduced the activation energy barrier for proton transport through the lattice, which improved the thermodynamic activity of the materials. In reality, cation vacancies are inherently present in all MnO2 solids, which are synthesized in the aqueous phase either via chemical oxidation–precipitation or electrolysis. Gao et al.78 analysed the supercapacitive performances of three different δ-MnO2 nanosheet samples, namely protonated MnO2 (HxMnO2, surface area: 4.5 m2 g−1), reassembled MnO2-pH 2 (surface area: 120 m2 g−1) and reassembled MnO2-pH 4 (surface area: 144 m2 g−1), with varying Mn vacancies and average oxidation states of Mn. The reassembled MnO2-pH 2 and reassembled MnO2-pH 4 samples were produced by equilibration at pH 2 and pH 4, respectively, for the intentional introduction of Mn vacancies into the nanosheets. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra provided the average oxidation state of Mn in the three samples, which was determined to be 3.57, 3.24 and 3.36 in the protonated MnO2, reassembled MnO2-pH 2 and reassembled MnO2-pH 4, respectively (Fig. 6(a–d)). Consequently, the corresponding content of Mn vacancies was elucidated to be 18.3%, 26.5% and 19.9%, while, the respective ratios of Mn3+/Mn4+ were detected as 41:59, 76:24 and 64:36, respectively. It was observed that an improved specific capacitance and lower charge transfer resistance were achieved when the content of Mn vacancies was higher (Fig. 6(e–g)). Moreover, following the same trend, the reassembled MnO2-pH 2 sample showed superior durability compared to the reassembled MnO2-pH 4, as shown in Fig. 6(h).

Figure reproduced from ref. 78. 
Besides MnO2, Mn2O3 (ref. 79) and Mn3O4 (ref. 80) have also been reported for supercapacitor applications. Li et al.79 synthesized crystalline porous Mn2O3 nanocubes (surface area: 54.5 m2 g−1 and average pore size: 12.4 nm) via a facile hydrothermal method followed by calcination, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 191.1 F g−1 at 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.8 V vs. SCE in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte. The symmetric full cell showed a specific capacitance of 53.2 F g−1 (@5 mV s−1) and good cycling performance (92.1% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles @ 50 mV s−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.2 V window. Mn3O4 nanodots loaded on nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (Mn3O4 NDs@NG) were synthesized by Liu and co-workers80 through a one-pot solvothermal method in the presence of octylamine as a surfactant. The composite material demonstrated a specific capacitance of 158.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of −1.6 to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) IL electrolyte at room temperature. An asymmetric device was assembled with activated polyaniline-derived carbon as the positive electrode, Mn3O4 NDs@NG as the negative electrode and (EMIMBF4) as the electrolyte. This asymmetric device delivered a specific capacitance of 56 F g−1 (@0.5 A g−1), energy density of 124.4 W h kg−1 (@999.3 W kg−1) and power density of 29.9 kW kg−1 (@55.8 W h kg−1) in the voltage range of 0–4 V window. A poor cycling performance (57.9% capacitance retention @ 2 A g−1 over 10000 cycles) is observed in the voltage window of 0–4 V, while the capacitance retention values reached at 68.4% and 78.9% for that of 0–3.8 V and 0–3.5 V, respectively.
On a different note, Mn3+ species spontaneously disproportionate (eqn (24)) into Mn2+ species and MnO2, while soluble Mn2+ species dissolve in the electrolyte and insoluble MnO2 remains in the electrode.81 2Mn3+ + 2H2O → Mn2+ + MnO2 + 4H+(24)
The experimental evidence indicates that this disproportion reaction is greatly catalyzed in acidic media.81,82 This parasitic reaction reduces the cycling stability of supercapacitors due to the structural disintegration of manganese oxide-based positive active materials. Moreover, the adverse effects of the cross-communication of soluble Mn-species on the negative electrode cannot be ignored.83 However, to prevent the dissolution of Mn, different chemical measures such as elemental doping81 and surface coating84 are extensively carried out on manganese oxides. Notably, most transition metal-based electrodes undergo structural degradation by metal ion dissolution via acid leaching in acidic media; however the extent of Mn dissolution is truly high.85 Therefore, discarding acidic electrolytes (adverse effects: acid leaching and accelerating Mn3+ disproportionation) and applying neutral electrolytes are preferable for manganese oxide-based energy storage devices.


4.1.3. Iron oxides and composites. 
Iron oxides including Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeOOH, and FexOy have been identified as potential supercapacitive materials considering their broad voltage window as negative electrodes, ideal theoretical specific capacitance (Fe2O3: >3500 F g−1, Fe3O4: >2500 F g−1, and FeOOH: >2500 F g−1),86 abundant availability, and eco-friendliness. The preliminary evaluations revealed that low electrical conductivity and poor cycling stability restrict the practical applications of iron oxide-based supercapacitors.87 Nevertheless, nanostructuring and forming various composites with conductive matrices can mitigate the abovementioned limitations. Among the various iron oxides, Fe2O3 has attracted considerable interest. Four different crystal structures, namely, α-Fe2O3, β-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, and ε-Fe2O3, are available for Fe2O3, where α-Fe2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable phase.88 Through an electrochemical and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method, Gund et al.89 synthesized Fe2O3 nanoparticle thin films on a flexible stainless steel (SS) substrate. The flexible asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with the (+)MnO2//1 M Na2SO4–carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel//Fe2O3(−) configuration, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 75 F g−1 (@1.28 A g−1), energy density of 41.8 W h kg−1 (@1276 W kg−1), power density of 5102 W kg−1 (@19.4 W h kg−1) and good cycling performance (91% capacitance retention over 3000 scans @ 100 mV s−1) in the operating window of 0–2 V. The EIS test was carried out in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 100 kHz, where the solution resistance (Rs) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) were calculated to be 0.64 and 28.95 Ω cm−2, respectively. The lower resistive components together with the 70° inclined straight line at lower frequencies indicate good capacitive properties. Guan and co-workers90 designed a graphite foam (GF)–CNT framework with a surface coating of a thin layer of Fe2O3 (GF–CNT@Fe2O3). According to the illustration shown in Fig. 7, vertically aligned CNTs were grown on the GF through the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method, and afterwards, a crystalline Fe2O3 layer was deposited on the GF–CNT framework via atomic layer deposition (ALD). GF–CNT@Fe2O3 showed the areal capacitance of ∼470.5 mF cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2 in the voltage range of 0 to −1.2 V vs. SCE in 2 M KOH electrolyte, which is about 4 times higher than that of the GF–CNT framework (∼93.8 mF cm−2). A two-electrode full cell, namely, (+)GF–CoMoO4//2 M KOH//GF–CNT@Fe2O3(−), was constructed, which delivered a specific capacitance of 210 F g−1 (@1.75 A g−1), energy density of 74.7 W h kg−1 (@1.4 kW kg−1), power density of 11.2 kW kg−1 (41.1 W h kg−1) and excellent cycle life (95.4% capacitance retention after 50000 cycles @ 7 A g−1) in the window of 0–1.6 V. Li et al.91 synthesized Fe3O4 nanosheet arrays uniformly grown on nickel foam (NF) using the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O precursor by annealing at 350 °C for 2 h. The specific capacitance of the as-synthesized electrode (Fe3O4–NF) was observed to be 379.8 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in the voltage range of −1 to 0 V vs. SCE in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The asymmetric device (+)NF–Co2AlO4@MnO2//PVA–KOH//NF–Fe3O4(−) delivered a specific capacitance of 99.13 F g−1 (@2 A g−1), energy density of 35.25 W h kg−1 (@800.1 W kg−1), power density of 8033 W kg−1 (@24.11 W h kg−1) and good cycling performance (92.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles @ 5 A g−1) in the window of 1–1.6 V window. A supercapacitor bank with two series connected devices illuminated a green LED (1.8 V) for 120 s after being charged for 10.8 s. Kumar and co-workers92 developed an Fe3O4-composite (3D Fe3O4/rGO) via a one-pot microwave approach, where the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (50–200 nm) were entrapped and well-dispersed in the interconnected rGO network (2630 m2 g−1). The 3D Fe3O4/rGO composite electrode showed a specific capacitance of 455 F g−1 (@3.6 A g−1), energy density of 124 W h kg−1 (@2.06 kW kg−1), power density of 2.74 kW kg−1 (@80.9 W h kg−1) and impressive cycling stability (∼8.5% loss after 9500 cycles @ 3.8 A g−1) in the window of −0.4 to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Long et al.93 synthesized an FeOOH/graphene-nanosheet/CNT composite (FeOOH/GNS/CNT) via the direct hydrolysis of Fe3+ on the surface of GNS-supported and CNT-bridged frameworks. The as-prepared FeOOH/GNS/CNT nanocomposite demonstrated the Li+ ion intercalation/deintercalation reaction in 1 M Li2SO4 (aq.) solution, as follows: FeOOH + xLi+ + xe− ↔ FeOOHLix(25)

The FeOOH/GNS/CNT composite electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 267 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in the window of −0.85 to −0.1 V vs. SCE in 1 M Li2SO4 medium, which was considerably higher than that of FeOOH/GNS (210 F g−1) and pristine FeOOH (148 F g−1). A two-electrode asymmetric device was assembled as (+)MnO2/GNS//1 M Li2SO4 (aq.)//FeOOH/GNS/CNTs(−), which demonstrated a specific capacitance of 77 F g−1 (@0.2 A g−1), energy density of 30.4 W h kg−1 (@237.6 W kg−1), power density of 8600 W kg−1 (@7.4 W h kg−1) and good cycling stability (89% capacitance retention 1000 cycles @ 100 mV s−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.7 V. Liu and co-workers94 reported a nitrogen-doped graphene/FeOx hybrid electrode with a 3D nanoporous architecture (NP NDG/FeOx), which exhibited a low internal resistance (5.4 Ω) and high specific capacity (∼409 mA h g−1 @ 5 mV s−1 in the voltage range of −1.2 V to 0 V vs. SCE in 1 M KOH). An asymmetric device was assembled with the (+)Ni(OH)2//1 M KOH//NP NDG/FeOx(−) configuration, which exhibited a specific capacity of 187 mA h g−1 (@5 mV s−1), energy density of 142 W h kg−1 (@1.4 kW kg−1), power density of 23 kW kg−1 (@53 W h kg−1) and good cycling stability (91% capacity retention after 10000 cycles @ 9 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.7 V.


4.1.4. Nickel oxide and composites. 
NiO is well studied for supercapacitor electrodes due to its good theoretical capacitance (2584 F g−1 @ 0.5 V potential window),95 impressive reversible redox reactions (Ni2+/Ni3+) and easy availability. The surface faradaic reaction of NiO in alkaline electrolyte is as follows:96 NiO + OH− ↔ NiOOH + e−(26)
According to a different theory, initially, NiO is converted to Ni(OH)2 in alkaline medium, and then redox reactions occur between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH as follows:95 Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e−(27)
However, both theories arrive at the consensus that Ni2+ is oxidized to NiOOH, which is responsible for supercapacitive charge storage. In reality, a high theoretical capacitance has not been achieved because of its poor conductivity (0.01–0.32 S m−1),97 and simultaneously, poor durability is observed due to the excessive volume change upon charge/discharge. Nevertheless, some modifications of the active materials may improve the experimental specific capacitance and cycling stability,98 such as, preparing composites with conductive matrices, nanostructuring and developing suitable morphologies to buffer the internal strain. Wu and co-workers99 anodically electrodeposited NiO nanoflakes using a polystyrene sphere monolayer as a template. The resulting NiO films consisted of interconnected nanoflakes (thickness: 12–16 nm) with open macropores (diameter: 200 nm), where the macropores were generated from the removal of the polystyrene sphere template. The resulting macropores facilitated fast electrolyte infiltration and enhanced the electrochemical performances by maximizing the active material utilization. The specific capacitance of the NiO film with macropores was found to be 351 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH, while under the same conditions, the NiO film without micropores exhibited only 140 F g−1. This study clearly indicates the necessity of electrode modification for achieving considerable supercapacitive performances. Liu et al.100 synthesized a hierarchical NiO/C hollow sphere composite (NiO/C-HS) via semi-sacrificial template-assisted hydrothermal and calcination methods, where well-dispersed NiO nanosheets were supported by carbon hollow spheres. The NiO/C-HS electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 686 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 2 M KOH electrolyte, which is much greater than that of the NiO-HS electrode (182 F g−1). A (+)NiO/C-HS//2 M KOH//AC(−) device was assembled, which delivered a specific capacitance of 99 F g−1 (@0.25 A g−1) and energy density of 30.5 W h kg−1 (@193 W kg−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.5 V. In the durability test, the (+)NiO/C-HS//AC(−) device maintained 100% of its initial capacitance at 1 A g−1 after 5000 cycles, while 83% capacitance retention was observed in NiO-HS//AC under similar working conditions. The improved performances of NiO/C-HS are attributed to: (i) synergistic effect between the conductive C-HS and NiO nanosheets; (ii) the formation of an integrated composite, which affords buffer space to accommodate volume changes; (iii) direct growth of NiO nanosheets on C-HS, which minimizes the aggregation of the NiO nanosheets; (iv) nanostructuring provides a high surface area and facile electrolyte diffusion; and (v) additional EDL contribution for C-HS. Chen and co-workers101 prepared a graphene/NiO (G/NiO) composite via hydrothermal synthesis from an aqueous mixture of graphene and Ni(NO3)2 followed by microwave irradiation of the hydrothermally synthesized product. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) depicted that 20–50 nm-sized NiO particles were homogeneously distributed on the graphene substrate. The two-electrode symmetric button cell with the G/NiO composite exhibited the specific capacitance of 617 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.8 V in 5 M NaOH electrolyte, while the pristine graphene-based cell showed only 265 F g−1. Since the larger space between the adjacent graphene sheets provided a buffer for volume changes in the NiO particles, the G/NiO composite material showed excellent cycling stability (99.4% capacitance retention @ 1 A g−1 for 5000 cycles).


4.1.5. Cobalt oxides and composites. 
Cobalt oxides have received considerable interest in supercapacitor applications due to their high theoretical capacitances (CoO: >4000 F g−1 and Co3O4: >3500 F g−1),102,103 easy synthesis, and environmentally friendly nature. Similar to NiO, cobalt oxides are nonconducting in nature and encounter excessive volume changes during repetitive charge/discharge processes. Various morphological modifications and the preparation of composites with conductive matrices have been extensively carried out to achieve good supercapacitive performances. Porous Co3O4 nanocubes (Co3O4 NCs, surface area: 61.5 m2 g−1 and average particle size: 50–60 nm) were synthesized by Jang et al.104via simple and cost-effective hydrothermal method. The CV curves of the Co3O4 NCs in 6 M KOH medium showed two pairs of redox peaks in the voltage range of −0.4 to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which indicate the following pseudocapacitive reactions. Co3O4 + OH− + H2O ↔ 3CoOOH + e−(28) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−(29)
The specific capacitance of the Co3O4 NCs electrode was found to be 430.6 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1, and it retained 85% of this value after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Liu and co-workers105 developed Co3O4/nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (Co3O4/NHCSs) with hierarchical structures via the hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination treatment, where the NHCSs act as a hard template to generate Co3O4 nanosheets on their surface. Co3O4/NHCSs showed a specific capacitance of 581 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 2 M KOH, which was higher than that of the pristine Co3O4 nanorods (NRs) (318 F g−1). An asymmetric device (+)Co3O4/NHCSs//2 M KOH//AC(−) was assembled, which demonstrated a specific capacitance of 111 F g−1 (@1 A g−1), energy density of 34.5 W h kg−1 (@753 W kg−1) and power density of 3807 W kg−1 (@29.0 W h kg−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.5 V. Moreover, the device displayed 100% capacitance retention at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles, while under similar circumstances (+)Co3O4-NRs//2 M KOH//AC(−) exhibited only 78% capacitance retention. The Co3O4/NHCS-based device achieved excellent durability due to the presence of highly conductive NHCSs, which inhibited the agglomeration and degradation of Co3O4 under recitative cycling. Deng et al.106 synthesized a CoO/graphene foam (CoO/GFs) composite material via a hydrothermal process and subsequent thermal treatment, where CoO nanowalls were well dispersed and separated by GFs with robust adhesion. The composite electrode showed a specific capacitance of 139.47 F g−1 (i.e., 231.87 F g−1 scaled to the mass of CoO) at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO in 3 M NaOH and retained 98% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at 7 A g−1. Sun and co-workers107 developed a 1.8 V asymmetric supercapacitor based on an ultrathin carbon shell-entrapped Co-doped CoO heterostructure (CoO/Co@C) as the positive electrode, AC as the negative electrode and 2 M KOH as the electrolyte. The CoO/Co@C heterostructure (surface area: 38.9 m2 g−1) exhibited a specific capacitance of 1985.1 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 2 M KOH. However, the full cell delivered a specific capacitance of 325.2 F g−1 (@2 A g−1), energy density of 146.3 W h kg−1 (@1800 W kg−1), power density of 27000 W kg−1 (@63.0 W h kg−1) and splendid cycling performance (98.1% capacitance retention after 15000 cycles @ 30 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.8 V.


4.1.6. Other metal oxides and composites. 
The above-discussed Ru, Mn, Fe, Ni and Co-based oxides and their composites are widely applied for chemical supercapacitors, but various other metal oxides, such as, ZnO,108 TiO2,109 CuO,110 SnO2,111 MoO3,112 CrO3,113 PbO,114 PbO2,115 W18O49,116 V2O5,117 Bi2O3,118 In2O3,119 and their composites are also envisaged. Heng et al.120 reported an asymmetric supercapacitor with AC as the positive electrode and TiO2 nanoparticles as the negative electrode in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The asymmetric device delivered a specific capacitance of 121 F g−1 (@0.4 A g−1), energy density of 35.38 W h kg−1 (@408.23 W kg−1) and moderate cycle life (80.4% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles @ 0.5 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.45 V. Barik et al.121 developed a (+)AC//PVA/KOH//SnO2@CNF(−) device, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 2.12 F g−1 (@0.2 A g−1), energy density of 4.71 W h kg−1 (@3200 W kg−1) and good cycling performance (92% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles @ 0.2 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–2 V. Karade et al.122 constructed a symmetric device with the (+)V2O5//1 M LiClO4 (aq.)//V2O5(−) configuration, which showed a specific capacitance of 172 F g−1 (@1.9 A g−1), energy density of 23.9 W h kg−1 (@937 W kg−1), power density of 6250 W kg−1 (@17 W h kg−1) and excellent cycling stability (94.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles @ 3.1 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1 V. Banerjee et al.115,123–125 designed and developed hybrid supercapacitors (rated energy density: ∼2 W h kg−1 and rated power density: ∼1000 W kg−1 based on device mass) by assembling a battery (lead-acid)-type PbO2 positive electrode and supercapacitor-type AC negative electrode in 6 M H2SO4–silica gel electrolyte. In this study, Planté-type substrate integrated thin film PbO2 electrodes (∼300 μm) were used instead of a commercial grade-thick pasted-type positive electrode (∼1 mm) for improving power capability.126 The stand-alone energy systems were designed with 12 V prototype devices (100–250 F range) and required power-electronics127 for real-life applications, for example, powering 30 W portable medical gadgets (electro-cardiogram machine)128 and solar energy storage.129 To characterize the device performance under a solar charging schedule, a year-round test was designed with charging in the day (9 am to 6 pm) through a 10 Wp photovoltaic panel and discharging at night (6 pm onwards) through a 1 W LED.129 It was observed that the monthly average for the charging energy input (kJ) data was well synchronized with the average solar insolation (kW h m−2) data for the respective month (Fig. 8(a)). Further, Fig. 8(b and c) depict the profiles of supercapacitor charging power (W) and solar insolation (W m−2) as a function of real time (Indian Standard Time) for one cloudy and one sunny representative day, respectively. It is apparent that the charging profile for the supercapacitor followed the trend of the solar insolation profile pretty accurately when the solar insolation was limited (in a cloudy day). In the case of a sunny day, the device charging phenomenon was completed, and became saturated. These experimental findings indicate the efficient charging characteristics of the hybrid device due to its excellent power capability. In the year-round test, the device did not show any performance degradation, which was established by the undiminished discharge time (except seasonal variation) of the device for a 1 W LED load (Fig. 8(d)). Among the ocean of supercapacitors, limited systems attain the level of commercialization, where the (+)PbO2//6 M H2SO4–silica gel//AC(−) system is one of them.

4.1.7. Mixed metal oxides and their composites. 
Most metal oxides are either insulating or semiconducting, and hence, pristine monometallic oxides are not suitable active materials for advanced supercapacitors. On the one hand, the morphological evolutions, nanostructuring and composite formations are elaborated in the previous sections with different representative examples. On the other hand, the mixed metallic oxides are truly promising for enhanced specific capacitance due to the synergistic effect of multiple redox active metallic sites. This synergistic effect18,130 includes (i) better charge storage capability due to improved utilization of electroactive materials; (ii) superior structural integrity, and consequently, the retention of crystal phases during repetitive charge/discharge cycles; and (iii) enhanced electrical conductivity, and concomitant faster electron transport. Li et al.131 synthesized an Fe3O4@TiO2 core–shell nanorod array through uniform ALD-TiO2 coating on an Fe3O4 electrode, where the TiO2 shell is not only buffered the inner volume change of Fe3O4, but also provided additional capacitance through the surface intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ ions in 1 M Li2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte and helped to alleviate the water splitting potential. The Fe3O4@TiO2 composite electrode showed superior cycling stability compared to the pristine Fe3O4 electrode, such as 405.6% capacity retention (initial capacity improved through activation) was observed for former, while the latter exhibited only 49.4% retention at 50 mV s−1 after 30000 cycles in the voltage range of −1.2 to 0 V vs. SCE at 1 M Li2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte. A flexible quasi-solid-state hybrid device, namely, (+)V2O3@C//PVA–LiCl hydrogel//Fe3O4@TiO2(−) was assembled, which delivered an energy density of 2.23 mW h cm−3 (@29 mW cm−3) and power density of 1090 mW cm−3 (@0.24 mW h cm−3) in the operating window of 0–2 V. The authors also elucidated the relative contributions of surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled charge storage processes to the total capacity at 100 mV s−1, and reported 66% surface contribution, which is in good accordance with the characteristics of hybrid supercapacitors. Deshmukh et al.132 developed a polygonal structure of (Fe,Cr)2O3 oxide layer on SS mesh (SS/(Fe,Cr)2O3) via the thermal oxidation of the SS-substrate in ambient atmosphere, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 7 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 in the voltage range of −1 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH electrolyte. A flexible symmetric device was assembled with SS/(Fe,Cr)2O3 electrodes in PVA–KOH gel electrolyte, which demonstrated a specific capacitance of 1.62 mF cm−2 (@0.5 mA cm−2), energy density of 0.57 mW h cm−2 (@200 mW cm−2) and power density of 400 mW cm−2 (@0.42 mW h cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–1.6 V. Moreover, the flexible symmetric device showed 90% capacitance retention over 2000 scans at 100 mV s−1 under both bending and twisting modes. Sarma and co-workers133 prepared an NiO and Co2O3-based mixed oxide (Ni–NiO/Co2O3) via the electrodeposition of Co2O3 on an NiO substrate, while NiO was formed on the Ni substrate by air oxidation. The Ni–NiO/Co2O3 composite electrode achieved a high specific capacitance of 412 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which was ∼20% higher than that of the Ni-foil/Co2O3 electrode. The improved performances of the Ni–NiO/Co2O3 electrode are mostly due to the synergistic effect of its two oxide phases (NiO and Co2O3). Feng et al.134 prepared a 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/NiWO4 microsphere composite (surface area: 37.6 m2 g−1) electrode via a one-pot hydrothermal method, where the composite was composed of self-assembled MnMoO4 nanoflakes and NiWO4 nanoparticles. The CV curves of the MnMoO4/NiWO4 composite showed significant redox peaks in 2 M KOH medium in the potential range of 0–0.4 V vs. SCE, which are attributed to the faradaic reactions of the Ni2+/Ni3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ couples. The composite electrode achieved a specific capacitance of 598 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.4 V, and retained 82% of its initial capacitance over 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The 3D hierarchical structures have many open spaces for the penetration of the electrolyte, which enhances their supercapacitive performances by maximizing the active material utilization. Further, 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/NiWO4 microspheres exhibited a robust morphological structure due to the uniform growth of NiWO4 nanoparticles on the MnMoO4 nanosheet backbones. Thus, this sturdy morphology of the composite improved the structural integrity of the electrodes, resulting in superior cycling stability.

4.2. Metal hydroxides and composites
The hydroxides of Ni, Co and Fe together with LDHs are mostly employed in chemical supercapacitors. Hexagonal layer-structured Ni(OH)2 has two polymorphs, namely, α- and β-Ni(OH)2, which oxidise to γ- and β-NiOOH,135 respectively, and Fig. 9 shows the transformations among the various phases of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH (Bode diagram). Structurally, α-Ni(OH)2 is a hydroxyl-deficient phase with inter-layered anions and water molecules, while β-Ni(OH)2 has a brucite structure without water molecules. The α-Ni(OH)2/γ-NiOOH couple exhibits a higher specific capacitance than that of the β-Ni(OH)2/β-NiOOH couple due to the greater change in valence.136 Even though it is not noticeable from the commonly used formulation, the γ-phase of NiOOH has a higher average oxidation state of Ni (3.3–3.7) compared with that of the β-phase due to the presence of Ni4+ ions.137–139 The theoretical specific capacitance of Ni(OH)2 is greater than 3500 F g−1, but the experimental values only reach the range of 500–600 F g−1 for powder materials due to their poor conductivity.136,140 Thus, modification of the morphology of materials promote higher specific capacitances by improving the utilization of the active materials. Yang et al.141 reported a high specific capacitance of 3152 F g−1 at 4 A g−1 in the voltage range of −0.05 to 0.45 V vs. SCE in 3% aqueous KOH electrolyte for porous α-Ni(OH)2 electrodeposited on Ni foam. The high specific capacitance is due to the loosely dispersed Ni(OH)2 particles on the Ni foam. Nevertheless, a poor rate capability (91.1% capacitance degradation by 4 times increment in current density) and poor cycling stability (48% capacitance loss after 300 cycles @ 4 A g−1) were observed because of the intrinsic lower conductivity. Thus, to overcome these limitations, nanostructuring and fabrication of composites are highly required. Wang and co-workers142 synthesized Ni(OH)2 hexagonal nanocrystals grown on electrically conducting graphene sheets (GS), which exhibited specific capacitances of 1335 and 953 F g−1 at current densities of 2.8 and 45.7 A g−1, respectively, in the voltage range of −0.05 to 0.50 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Together with the good rate capability, an appreciable energy density of 37 W h kg−1 (@10 kW kg−1) and excellent cycling stability (100% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles @ 28.6 A g−1) were demonstrated by the Ni(OH)2/GS electrode. Similar to Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2 possesses a hexagonal-layered structure together with α- and β-polymorphs, where α-Co(OH)2 exhibits a better supercapacitive performance. Eqn (30) and then eqn (29) demonstrate the supercapacitive redox reactions of Co(OH)2. Co(OH)2 + OH− ↔ CoOOH + H2O + e−(30)
 Fig. 9  Bode diagram: transformation between NiOOH and Ni(OH)2. 
The theoretical specific capacitance of Co(OH)2 is above 3600 F g−1, but in reality, a considerably lower capacitance together with poor rate capability and cycle life are observed due to its low conductivity. As described for Ni(OH)2, similar strategies have to be employed to improve the performance of Co(OH)2-based supercapacitors. Jagadale et al.143 synthesized α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes, which were uniformly loaded on highly conducting flexible carbon fiber (CF) paper, showing a specific capacitance of 386.5 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 in the voltage range of 0–0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M LiOH. The composite electrode demonstrated 92% capacitance retention over 2000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, a flexible solid-state symmetric device was assembled with PVA/LiOH polymer gel electrolyte, which delivered an energy density of 4.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 424 W kg−1 in the voltage window of 0–1 V. On the other hand, Fe(OH)2 (redox couple: Fe2+/Fe3+)144 and Fe(OH)3 (redox couple: Fe0/Fe3+)145 are also promising supercapacitive materials through the following surface redox reactions. Fe(OH)2 + OH− ↔ FeOOH + H2O + e−(31) Fe + 3OH− ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3e−(32)
Owusu and co-workers144 reported an asymmetric supercapacitor with the (+)NiMoO4//2 M KOH//Fe(OH)2/FeOOH(−) configuration, where the Fe(OH)2/FeOOH negative electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance (1066 F g−1 @ 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of −1.2 to 0 V vs. SCE), good rate capability (74.6% capacitance retention from 1–30 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (91% capacitance retention @ 30 A g−1 after 10000 cycles). The asymmetric device delivered a specific capacitance of 273 F g−1 (@1.5 A g−1), energy density of 104.3 W h kg−1 (@1.27 kW kg−1), power density of 10.94 kW kg−1 (@31 W h kg−1) and good cycling stability (80.8% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles @ 22.5 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.7 V. Fan et al.145 synthesized an Fe(OH)3 film on Fe foam (Fe(OH)3@Fe) as the negative electrode of supercapacitors, where Fe(OH)3@Fe achieved areal capacitances in the range of 5.55–3.94 F cm−2 in the current range of 20–200 mA cm−2 and voltage window of −1.4 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in KOH–NaCl electrolyte. The fabricated asymmetric device, namely, (+)Co3O4@Ni//KOH–NaCl//Fe(OH)3@Fe(−), demonstrated a specific capacitance of 3.40 F cm−2 (@20 mA cm−2), energy density of 11.64 W h m−2 (@157 W m−2) and power density of 1461 W m−2 (@7.43 W h m−2) in the voltage window of 0–2 V.
LDHs146 have attained great interest as supercapacitive materials due to the facile tunability of their composition, structure and morphology. Basically, LDHs are 2D multi-metal clay materials, which are comprised of brucite layers of metal cations octahedrally enclosed by hydroxyls, forming M2+(OH)6/M3+/4+(OH)6 octahedra.147 The general formula of LDHs is [M1−x2+Nx3+(HO−)2]x+[(Xn−)x/n·yH2O]x−, where Xn− is the intercalating anion(s). Xie et al.148 reported an asymmetric supercapacitor based on the (+)AC//6 M KOH//CoNi-LDH(−) configuration, where the CoNi-LDH negative electrode (Co/Ni = 1:1, surface area: 109.8 m2 g−1) exhibited a specific capacitance of 2614 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO. The asymmetric device exhibited a specific capacitance of 149 F g−1 (@142.8 mA g−1), energy density of 46.3 W h kg−1 (@102.3 W kg−1), power density of 1704.5 W kg−1 (@25.6 W h kg−1) and moderate cycling performance (84.5% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles @ 476 mA g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.5 V. By contrast, with mono- and bi-active metal hydroxides, multi-active metal hydroxides provide better utilization of the redox active sites due to the multi-valence synergistic effect. Sivakumar et al.149 reported a hexagonal nanoplate-like architecture of NiCoMn-ternary-component-LDH (NCM-LDH; Ni:Co:Mn = 2.01:0.50:0.49) with a controlled size and composition through a one-pot hydrothermal process, which showed a specific capacitance of 1188 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0–0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO in 6 M KOH medium. The full cell with the (+)NCM-LDH//6 M KOH//AC(−) configuration delivered a specific capacitance of 136.2 F g−1 (@1 A g−1), energy density of 42.56 W h kg−1 (@726.17 W kg−1), power density of 17791.56 W kg−1 (@24.71 W h kg−1), and good cycling stability (78.8% capacitance retention over 50000 cycles at 10 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.5 V. To further improve the supercapacitive performances, various composites of LDHs have also been reported in the literature.146,150,151
Notably, there is appreciable controversy on the charge storage mechanism (whether pseudo-faradaic or faradaic) for oxides/hydroxides of Ni, Co and Fe in alkaline electrolyte, while unambiguously, compounds of Ru and Mn exhibit the pseudo-faradaic mechanism in acidic and neutral electrolyte, respectively.152,153 According to the definition given by Conway, a pseudocapacitive electrode always shows a linear function of the stored charge with the width of the voltage window (C = dq/dV), but the origin of charge storage mechanism is faradaic in nature. In practice, oxides/hydroxides of Ni, Co and Fe exhibit prominent redox waves in their cyclic voltammogram, and corresponding voltage plateaus in their constant-current charge/discharge curves are observed, which are typical battery-like faradaic in nature, and far from the ideal pseudocapacitive characteristics (quasi-rectangular cyclic voltammogram and quasi-triangular constant-current charge/discharge profile). Consequently, nonlinear functions of charge storage vs. voltage window are obtained. By contrast, several researchers also reported pseudocapacitive characteristics in oxides/hydroxides of Ni, Co and Fe in their pristine141,154 and carbon-composite forms.142,143 Researchers who described battery-like faradaic and capacitor-like pseudo-faradaic processes estimated the capacity (in coulomb or A h unit) and capacitance (in F unit), respectively, of these materials. However, the controversy originates in the pseudo-faradaic mechanism since it is intermediate in nature between non-faradaic (purely capacitor-like) and faradaic (purely battery-like) processes.155 Nevertheless, we do not justify any side, only clarify this important concern for readers.
4.3. Metal carbides and composites
Recently, 2D carbides, namely MXenes,156,157 have been intensively studied in energy storage applications due to their good electrical conductivities, mechanical stability, thermal stability, high melting point, good corrosion resistance and hydrophilic surface. Metal carbides are special metallic structures in which carbon atoms are dispersed in the interstitial voids of densely packed host lattices, which is the origin of their higher electronic conductivity.158–160 The MXene family is comprised of several carbides, including, Ti2CTx, (Ti0.5Nb0.5)2CTx, Nb2CTx, Ti3CNTx, V2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, (V0.5Cr0.5)3C2Tx, Ta4C3Tx and Nb4C3Tx, among which, Ti3C2Tx has been intensively studied.161,162 Besides the MXene family, other types of carbides, such as WC, TixCy, Mn3C, Co3C, Co2C and Co3ZnC, have also been reported in the literature for supercapacitor applications.163 Dall'Agnese163 reported the supercapacitive behaviour of Ti3C2Tx in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, where Ti3C2Tx was modified by delamination or intercalation treatment to achieve a high surface area and advanced surface properties towards improved performance. Fig. 10 depicts the modification routes of Ti3C2Tx, i.e. (i) delamination through the insertion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent (d-Ti3C2) and (ii) chemical intercalation of K+ ions between Ti3C2Tx layers by KOH treatment (KOH–Ti3C2). Through both modification routes, the F-terminations of Ti3C2Tx were mostly replaced by hydroxyl groups. In the case of the delamination process, the surface area increased from 23 to 98 m2 g−1, and consequently, d-Ti3C2 demonstrated a higher specific capacitance (415 F cm−3 @ 5 A g−1 in the voltage window of −0.4 to 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl) compared to that of KOH–Ti3C2 (215 F cm−3). Moreover, both modified species (d-Ti3C2 and KOH–Ti3C2) showed a better capacitance than Ti3C2Tx due to the change in their surface chemistries. Both d-Ti3C2 and KOH–Ti3C2 exhibited a stable cycling performance at 5 A g−1 over 10000 cycles. Morishita and co-workers164 synthesized porous carbon-coated WC and Mo2C via the heat treatment of K2WO4 and K2MoO4 with hydroxy propyl cellulose, respectively. WC and Mo2C were converted into their respective hydroxides during the first charge/discharge cycle in aqueous H2SO4 medium, which exhibited the respective redox reactions in further cycles. The carbon-coated WC and Mo2C demonstrated stable specific capacitances of 350 F cm−3 (over 300 cycles) and 730 F cm−3 (over 500 cycles), respectively, at 50 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0–1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which are much higher than that of porous carbons without metal carbides (140 F cm−3). The beneficial effects of carbon coating on metal carbides are multi-directional, such as (i) restricts the growth of carbide particles during their formation, where small-sized particles facilitate the complete transformation of carbides to hydroxides in the first charge/discharge cycle, (ii) prevent the agglomeration of metal hydroxides upon further cycling, and (iii) contribute additional capacitance through the formation of EDLs with electrolyte ions. Kim and Kim165 constructed a high voltage asymmetric supercapacitor using SiC–MnO2 nanoneedles (SiC–MnO2) as the positive electrode, thermally functionalized AC (with oxygen containing groups) as the negative electrode and 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) as the electrolyte. In the SiC–MnO2 composite (MnO2/SiC feeding ratio of 5:1), the MnO2 nanoneedles were homogeneously decorated on the SiC surface due to the anchoring of the MnO2 nanostructures by the SiC surface functionalities (epoxy and hydroxyl groups). This nanostructure provided a larger specific surface area together with facile pathways for electrolyte ion diffusion. The SiC–MnO2 nanocomposite showed a specific capacitance of 273.2 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 in the voltage range of −0.1 to 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.), which is much higher than that of pristine SiC (72.4 F g−1). The asymmetric device delivered a specific capacitance of 59.9 F g−1 (@2 mV s−1), energy density of 30.06 W h kg−1 (@113.92 W kg−1) and superb cycling stability (3.1% capacitance decay after 1000 cycles @ 50 mV s−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.9 V. Shan et al.166 reported the electrochemical performances of delaminated V2C MXene in three different aqueous electrolytes, namely, 1 M H2SO4, 1 M MgSO4 and 1 M KOH. The specific capacitances achieved were 487 F g−1 (−1.1 to −0.3 vs. Hg/HgSO4) in 1 M H2SO4, 225 F g−1 (−1.2 to 0 V vs. Ag) in 1 M MgSO4, and 184 F g−1 (−1.2 to −0.6 V vs. Ag) in 1 M KOH medium at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Moreover, the capacitance retention was observed to be 83%, 99% and 94% in 1 M H2SO4, 1 M MgSO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively, at 10 A g−1 after 10000 cycles within the respective voltage ranges mentioned above. The poor cycling stability in 1 M H2SO4 medium is attributed to the V-dissolution in electrolyte, which was experimentally detected by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry. However, the state-of-the-art capacitance and durability of metal carbides do not satisfy commercial benchmarks, which can be improved by controlling the material morphology (nanoscale particles, composites, etc.) and electrode architecture (thin and porous structure).167

4.4. Metal nitrides and composites
In 1998, Conway and his group168 reported the pseudocapacitive characteristics of MoxN (MoN and Mo2N) during their search for low-cost alternatives to RuO2. The MoxN film deposited by CVD showed similar pseudocapacitive behaviour to RuO2, but a lower operating voltage (0.7 V vs. RHE) was obtained compared to that of the RuO2 film (1.35 V vs. RHE) in H2SO4 medium. Beyond the positive potentials of 0.7 V, an overcharged faradaic current was observed, even below the potential of oxygen evolution reaction, which indicates the anodic decomposition of the MoxN film and probable formation of non-stoichiometric MoO2. In recent years, metal nitrides (MN, M = V, Ti, Mo, W, Ga, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.)19,169,170 have been widely applied in chemical supercapacitors due to their well-defined pseudocapacitive surface-redox behaviours and high electronic conductivities. Several researchers are focused on VN due to its high theoretical capacity (>41000 F g−1), metal-like conductivity, fast and reversible redox response in the various oxidation states (+2 to +5) of vanadium, and high overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction.171–173 Cheng et al.174 synthesized nanocrystalline VN (surface area: 56.8 m2 g−1 and electronic conductivity: ∼5.8 × 103 Ω−1 m−1) through the melamine reduction of V2O5 xerogel, and its performance was tested in various aqueous electrolytes. The specific capacitances achieved were 114 F g−1 (−0.5 to 0.5 V vs. SCE), 45.7 F g−1 (−0.7 to 0.3 V vs. SCE) and 273 F g−1 (−1.1 to 0 V vs. Hg/HgO) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 2.0 M NaNO3 and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively, at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. The operating capacitive and pseudocapacitive processes of VN in H2SO4, NaNO3 and KOH media are presented in eqn (33)–(35), respectively. VNxOy + SO42− + H2O ↔ VNxOy‖SO42− + VNxOy–OH + H+(33) VNxOy + NO3− ↔ VNxOy‖NO3−(34) VNxOy + OH− ↔ VNxOy‖OH− + VNxOy–OH(35)Herein, VNxOy‖SO42−, VNxOy‖NO3− and VNxOy‖OH− correspond to the EDLs, while VNxOy–OH represents the redox pseudocapacitance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the charge storage mechanisms of VN depend on the nature of the electrolyte. On a different note, the presence of oxygen on the surface of VN was detected by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while its composition was determined to be VN1.02O0.1. It is a common problem for metal nitrides that they are not stable in aqueous solution due to the irreversible formation of oxides layers on their surface, which are partially soluble in electrolyte. An et al.175 proposed novel VN encapsulated carbon fibre networks (VN/CF), in which carbon encapsulation restricted the direct contact between VN and the aqueous electrolyte, and consequently, the surface oxidation of VN was minimized. Hence, the VN/CF composite (∼5.3 nm thick continuous carbon layer on 35–41 nm sized VN particles; Fig. 11(a)) electrodes exhibited a higher specific capacitance (800 F g−1) compared to commercial pristine VN (43 F g−1) at 4 A g−1 in the voltage range of −1.2 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The full cell with the (+)Ni(OH)2//6 M KOH//VN/CF(−) configuration demonstrated a specific capacitance of 188 F g−1 (@4 A g−1), energy density of 53.1 W h kg−1 (@2700 W kg−1) and power density of 54000 W kg−1 (@36 W h kg−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.6 V. The asymmetric full cell exhibited excellent capacitance retentions of 96.4%, 95.3% and 92.9% over 10000 cycles at current densities of 4 A g−1 (2700 W kg−1), 40 A g−1 (27000 W kg−1), and 80 A g−1 (54000 W kg−1), respectively (Fig. 11(b)). The carbon encapsulation prevented the surface oxidation of VN, and hence, maintained an excellent cycle life together with high specific capacitance, which is schematically shown in Fig. 11(c and d). Similar to VN, TiN (bulk electrical conductivity: ∼5 × 106 S m−1) also encounters irreversible surface oxidation according to the following reactions. TiN + 2H2O → TiO2 + 0.5N2 + 4H+ + 4e−(36) 2TiN + O2 → TiO2 + N2(37)

Nevertheless, carbon or polymer coating, thermal annealing for nitrogen diffusion from the bulk to surface, etc. may improve the performances of TiN compared to that of pristine TiN. Grote et al.176 synthesized self-supported carbon-coated TiN nanotube arrays (C-TiN) via a conformal carbon coating technique. The C-TiN nanotube array showed specific capacitances of 167 and 95 F g−1 at 1 and 50 A g−1, respectively, while that of the pristine TiN nanotube array was 140 and 61 F g−1 at respective current densities under −1 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The C-TiN and pristine TiN electrodes demonstrated 70% and 15% capacitance retention, respectively, at 10 A g−1 over 6000 cycles. The long cycle life and high capacitance of C-TiN were achieved due to the effective protection from surface oxidation and EDL contribution from carbon. Achour et al.177 studied nitrogen (β-N) doping in the oxidized surface of TiN films (diffusion from bulk to surface) via a vacuum annealing method and its effects on their supercapacitive performances. XPS analysis depicted that the annealing of the TiN film facilitated the diffusion of β-N from the sub-surface to the oxidized surface, and accordingly, an N-substituted TiOx layer was formed. This phenomenon prevented the further oxidation of the TiN film surface. It was noticed that the β-N content in the TiN film surface increased by increasing the annealing temperature, and concomitantly, the specific capacitance of the TiN film improved. This is due to the generation of more pseudocapacitive active sites with an increase in surface oxygen vacancies, which are correlated with the β-N content in the surface. Notably, TiN films were deposited on Si wafers by the DC reactive magnetron sputtering technique, where Ar (99.999%) and N2 (99.999%) were employed as the sputtering and reactive gases, respectively. The N2 excess during deposition led to an increase in the N-content at the TiN surface. However, the annealed TiN film (@550 °C) exhibited a specific capacitance of 8.2 mF cm−2 at 2 mV s−1 within −0.2 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M K2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte, which is ∼3 times higher than that of the unannealed TiN film. However, MN (M = V or Ti) are promising candidates for negative electrodes in asymmetric supercapacitors in alkaline media. Kartachova et al.178 elucidated the supercapacitive characteristics of WN (composition: W0.75(N,O), where O/N varied between 0.3 and 1 and surface area: 42 m2 g−1) in different aqueous electrolytes including 1 M H2SO4 (∼67 F g−1, −0.4 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl), 1 M KOH (∼57 F g−1, −1.1 to 0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO), 3 M KCl (∼18 F g−1, −0.9 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl), 3 M NaCl (∼16 F g−1, −0.9 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl), 1 M LiCl (∼28 F g−1, −0.9 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and 1 M CaCl2 (∼39 F g−1, −0.9 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) at 0.5 A g−1 current density. By contrary, the best cycling stability of WN was observed in 1 M KOH medium. This is attributed to the unfeasibility of the bulk intercalation of protons or cations into WN, where pseudocapacitive ion adsorption will be the probable supercapacitive mechanism. In a different study,179 the specific capacitances for NbN and γ-Mo2N crystallites were found to be 73 F g−1 (−1.0 to −0.7 V vs. Hg/HgO) and 111 F g−1 (−1.1 to −0.2 V vs. Hg/HgO), respectively, at 2 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Wang and group180 fabricated a single-crystal GaN mesoporous membrane (GaNMM; surface area: 23.2 m2 g−1 and pore size ∼20 nm; electrical conductivity: 44.19 S cm−1) through an electrochemical etching process and electrochemically characterized in two different aqueous electrolytes, namely, 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M Na2SO4. The specific capacitances achieved were 23 mF cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 and 18 mF cm−2 in 1 M Na2SO4 at 0.5 mA cm−2 within −0.5 to 0.4 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4. This result indicates that protons enhance the pseudocapacitance of GaN through the pseudo-faradaic reaction with surface oxynitride thin films, as shown in eqn (38). GaN1−xOx + 2yH+ + 2ye− ↔ GaN1−x−yOx−y + yH2O(38)
However, the symmetric supercapacitor based on GaNMM delivered a specific capacitance of 23.11 mF cm−2 (@0.5 mA cm−2), energy density of 0.65 μW h cm−2 (@0.5 mA cm−2) and power density of 45 mW cm−2 (@100 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–0.9 V. The capacitance retentions were observed to be 98% (@10 mA cm−2) and 98.8% (@5 mA cm−2) for the first 30000 and last 20000 cycles, respectively. Wei et al.181 fabricated a CrN thin film using reactive DC magnetron sputtering and tested it in a symmetric full cell in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium. The symmetric device delivered a specific capacitance of 6.5 mF cm−2 (@1.0 mA cm−2), energy density of 8.2 mW h cm−3 (@0.7 W cm−3) and good cycling stability (10% capacitance loss after 20000 @ 2.0 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–0.8 V. Cui and co-workers182 synthesized N-doped carbon-coated Nb4N5 (Nb4N5@NC) nanochannels and characterized them in a symmetric full cell using 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The device showed a specific capacitance of 116.45 mF cm−2 (@0.5 mA cm−2), energy density of 4.66 mW h cm−3 (@24.56 W cm−3) and power density of 25.21 W cm−3 (@2.93 mW h cm−3) in the voltage window of 0–1 V. Besides the various binary metal nitrides, ternary metal nitrides (such as TiVN)183 and composites of two binary metal nitrides (such as TiN/VN)184 are also envisaged for chemical supercapacitor applications.
4.5. Metal phosphides, phosphates, phosphites and composites
In recent years, phosphorous-based metal compounds, such as phosphides, phosphates and phosphites, have been widely used in chemical supercapacitors due to their greater ionic cum electronic conductivity and open nano/meso porous framework structures. Phosphorus reacts with several elements and forms versatile phosphide compounds with metalloid characteristics, high chemical stability and mechanically sturdy flexible architectures. Du et al.185 constructed symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor cells based on Ni2P nanoparticles in 3 M KOH medium. The symmetric device exhibited a specific capacitance of 1.70 F g−1 (@0.2 mA cm−2), energy density of 0.24 W h kg−1 (@42 W kg−1) and power density of 170 W kg−1 (@0.09 W h kg−1) in the voltage range of 0–1 V. In contrast, the asymmetric (+)Ni2P//AC(−) device delivered a specific capacitance of 237.4 F g−1 (@1 mA cm−2), energy density of 64.6 W h kg−1 (@1029 W kg−1) and power density of 20580 W kg−1 (34.3 W h kg−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.5 V. Lu et al.186 synthesized Ni2P particles, which were homogenously coated (thickness: 20–30 nm) with amorphous Ni via an electroless plating process. The Ni2P/Ni composite electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 581 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0–0.55 V vs. Hg/HgO in 2 M LiOH electrolyte and 19% capacitance reduction at 40 A g−1, whereas the respective data for the pristine Ni2P electrode was 418 F g−1 and 22%. The large surface area of the Ni flake coating led to an enhancement in the ion and electron transport, which was responsible for the improved specific capacitance of composite over the pristine electrode. The Ni2P/Ni composite electrode delivered an energy density of 83.6 W h kg−1 (@2.7 kW kg−1) and power density of 10.9 kW kg−1 (70.2 W h kg−1), whereas the Ni2P pristine electrode shows about half of this energy density at a similar power density. In the durability test at 2 A g−1, initial capacitance enhancements were observed for both Ni2P/Ni and Ni2P due to the activation processes of the electrodes, which reached the maximum near the 500th cycle. Thereafter, the Ni2P/Ni electrode lost only 7.7% of its maximum capacitance over the next 2500 cycles, while the capacitance degradation was much higher for the pristine Ni2P electrode. To overcome the short-term cycling stability, Elshahawy and co-workers187 synthesized sulfur-doped CoP nanotube arrays aligned on carbon cloth (Co(P,S)/CC), which exhibited overall improved electrochemical performances than that of the pristine CoP. Co(P,S)/CC and CoP/CC displayed the specific capacitances of 610 and 342.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of −0.2 to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and retained 56% and 46% of their initial capacitance with an increase in the current density to 20 A g−1, respectively. The improved rate capability of the Co(P,S)/CC electrode is attributed to its lower ESR value (∼0.4 Ω) compared to that of CoP/CC (∼0.51 Ω). Subsequently, 99% and 70% capacitance retention was observed for Co(P,S)/CC and CoP/CC, respectively, at 10 A g−1 current density after 10000 cycles. The poor cycling stability of the pristine CoP/CC electrode is due to the formation of a passivating oxy-hydroxide phase on the surface, and consequently, a reduction in the electrode conductivity and active material utilization are unavoidable. Herein, sulfur doping effectively prevented the formation of passivation layers on the electrode surface and improved the cycling performances. An asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled by employing Co(P,S)/CC as the positive electrode, porous carbon polyhedron (PCP)/rGO hydrogel as the negative electrode and 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. It delivered a specific capacitance of 109.5 F g−1 (@1 A g−1), energy density of 39 W h kg−1 (@0.8 kW kg−1), power density of 30.6 kW kg−1 (@18.7 W h kg−1) and excellent cycling performance (92.6% capacitance retention after 30000 cycles at 10 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.6 V.
Li et al.188 synthesized hierarchical 3D cobalt phosphate octahydrate (Co3(PO4)2·8H2O) via a room temperature precipitation method without employing any surfactants. The as-synthesized flower-like structure with interconnecting 2D microsheets provided a high surface area and open channels for electrolyte infiltration, and consequently, demonstrated good pseudocapacitive performances. Co3(PO4)2·8H2O attained a specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 (@1 A g−1), good rate capability (227 F g−1 @ 10 A g−1) and excellent durability (102% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles @ 1 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Zhao and co-workers189 developed a novel hybridized NH4–Ni–Co phosphate via a hydrothermal sacrificial template method, which was comprised of (Ni,Co)3(PO4)2·8H2O nanoslices (∼1 nm) and single crystal (NH4)(Ni,Co)PO4·0.67H2O microplatelets. The mixed-phase material exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1128 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V vs. Hg/HgO in 6 M KOH. Rs and Rct were estimated from the Nyquist plot in EIS, and the respective values were determined to be 1.29 and 1.38 Ω. The lower resistive characteristics are attributed due to the novel structural properties of the hybridized NH4–Ni–Co phosphate. In particular, the single crystal (NH4)(Ni,Co)PO4·0.67H2O microplatelets provide an electronic pathway by bridging the (Ni,Co)3(PO4)2·8H2O nanoslices, and the channels generated between the microplate and nanoslices offer a facile ionic movement (Fig. 12(a)). The synergistic effect between the two phases boosts the supercapacitive behaviours for the NH4–Ni–Co phosphate, and the associated pseudo-faradaic reactions are presented as follows: (NH4)(Ni,Co)PO4·0.67H2O + OH− ↔ (NH4)(Ni,Co)(OH)PO4 + e−(39) (Ni,Co)3(PO4)2·8H2O + 3OH− ↔ (Ni,Co)3(OH)3(PO4)2·8H2O + 3e−(40)

The microplatelet (NH4)(Ni,Co)PO4·0.67H2O phase with a large interlayer distance (0.875 nm) facilitated the diffusion of electrolyte ions and electrons. Hence, the enhanced electronic conductivity and fast ion diffusion kinetics enabled the facile intercalation/deintercalation of the hydroxyl ions between the atomic layers (Fig. 12(b)). On the other hand, the nanoslice (Ni,Co)3(PO4)2·8H2O phase provided a large amount of electroactive surface redox sites (Fig. 12(c)) for redox-pseudocapacitance. Fig. 12(d–g) provide the CV characteristics, GCD profiles, rate capability behaviour and EIS analysis, respectively, for the hybrid material. An asymmetric device was assembled in 6 M KOH with NH4–Ni–Co phosphate as the positive electrode and hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) as the negative electrode. This device exhibited a specific capacitance of 77 F g−1 (@0.1 A g−1), energy density of 35.3 W h kg−1 (@101 W kg−1), power density of 4400 W kg−1 (@30.9 W h kg−1) and outstanding cycling stability (95.6% capacitance retention over 5000 @ 1 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.65 V window. Chen and co-workers190 reported the improved specific capacitance of amorphous Ni0.8Co0.2-pyrophosphate (1259 F g−1) compared to Ni-pyrophosphate (945 F g−1) and Co-pyrophosphate (358 F g−1) at 1.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0 to 0.55 V vs. Hg/HgO in 3 M KOH medium. In Ni0.8Co0.2-pyrophosphate, electroactive centers are participated in the surface-redox reactions from valence interchange accompanied with charge hopping between the Ni and Co cations. Therefore, rational tuning of the Ni/Co ratio is truly critical for achieving optimized supercapacitive performances. The (+)Ni0.8Co0.2-pyrophosphate//3 M KOH//AC(−) full cell demonstrated a specific capacitance of 119 F g−1 (@1 A g−1), energy density of 42.4 W h kg−1 (@1 A g−1), power density of 5.6 kW kg−1 (@7 A g−1) and moderate cycling performance (80% capacitance retention with ∼96% coulombic efficiency over 2000 cycles @ 1.5 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.6 V. A sea-urchin-like bimetallic phosphide/phosphate composite (Ni–Co–P/POx; Ni/Co = 1:1) was synthesized by Chen et al.191via a low-temperature phosphating method, in which the crystalline phosphide nanoparticles were distributed in the matrix of the amorphous phosphate phase. The asymmetric supercapacitor with the configuration of (+)Ni–Co–P/POx//6 M KOH//rGO(−) delivered a specific capacity of 182 C g−1 (@1 A g−1), energy density of 36.84 W h kg−1 (@727.8 W kg−1), power density of 5.67 kW kg−1 (@19.87 W h kg−1) and moderate cycle life (86% of capacitance retention after 7000 cycles @ 3 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.5 V.
Wang et al.192 synthesized NiHPO3·H2O nanorods with high electrical conductivity and a hierarchical pore structure via a one-step hydrothermal method. The CV analysis with varying scan rate produced the b-value of 0.71 and 0.64 for the cathodic and anodic peak potentials, respectively, which that signifies the simultaneous diffusion-controlled and surface-controlled processes are associated with Ni2+ and Ni3+ interconversion. The NiHPO3·H2O (surface area: 22.4 m2 g−1) electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 1405.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.45 V vs. Hg/HgO in 2 M KOH electrolyte together with excellent rate capability (64.2% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1) and good cycling stability (77.3% capacitance retention @ 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor based on the NiHPO3·H2O positive electrode and hierarchical porous carbon derived from pine pollen as the negative electrode was constructed, which exhibited a specific capacity of 120.2 F g−1 (@0.5 A g−1), energy density of 42.6 W h kg−1 (@449.1 W kg−1), power density of 8384 W kg−1 (@20 W h kg−1) and good cycling performance (84.7% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles @ 5 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–1.6 V window. Further, microporous Ni11(HPO3)8(OH)6 nanocrystals were prepared by Gao and co-workers193via hydrothermal route and employed in a flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor as the positive electrode. The hydrophosphite (surface area: 398 m2 g−1) showed a good specific capacitance of 558 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO in 3 M KOH electrolyte, which degraded to 545 F g−1 after 10000 cycles. The (+)Ni11(HPO3)8(OH)6//3 M KOH//graphene(−) system demonstrated the specific capacitance of 1.64 F cm−3 (@0.5 mA cm−2), energy density of 0.45 mW h cm−3 (@0.5 mA cm−2) and power density of 33 mW cm−3 (@5 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–1.4 V. The device also demonstrated 100% and 93.3% capacitance retention after 2000 and 10000 cycles, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2.
4.6. Metal chalcogenides and composites
The 2D metal chalcogenides,194,195 mainly sulfides, are attracting immense attention in chemical supercapacitors due to their (i) high electrical conductivity, (ii) high electrochemical, mechanical and thermal stabilities, (iii) quantum-sized effects, and (iv) structural flexibility. The structures and properties of metal chalcogenides are similar to that of pristine graphene, except for their band-gap.14 In the case of pristine graphene, its band-gap is close to zero, while that depends on the elemental combination, number of layers and amount of doping atoms for metal chalcogenides. Hence, the band-gap values of metal chalcogenides exist in the range of 0 to 2 eV, and because of these variations, different tunable structures can be achieved.12 The metal chalcogenides exist in two crystallographic phases, namely, semiconducting 2H and conducting 1T phases.196 The excellent electrochemical activities of metal chalcogenides originate from the edge planes of the 2D layers in their anisotropic crystal structures.197,198 However, despite their appealing properties, monolithic electrodes of metal chalcogenides show a low surface area and excessive volume change upon cycling due to the re-stacking of their 2D nanosheets. Thus, exfoliation or delamination of the nanosheets provide a higher electroactive surface area towards electrolytes and also renders sufficient buffer regions to accommodate the volume change. Nonetheless, an exfoliated sheet-like morphology with sub-atomic thickness, high surface area and active edge sites in the 2D sheets of metal chalcogenides are pivotal to form hybrid nanostructures with other functional materials. Kandula et al.199 designed a 3D hierarchical Co9S8/α-MnS@NC@MoS2 nanowire structure from the conversion of a binary metal oxide (MnCo2O4) core to individual metal sulfide (Co9S8/α-MnS) core together with the simultaneous formation of an outer metal sulfide shell (MoS2) via a hydrothermal sulfurization reaction, where N-doped carbon (NC) was located between the core and shell as the interlayer. The hybrid structure provided the following synergism; (i) the mesoporous Co9S8/α-MnS core improved the electrical conductivity due to the lower band-gap and more covalent nature of metal–sulfide bonds, (ii) the conducting intermediate NC layer provides a facile pathway for electron and ion transport, (iii) the intermediate NC layer is beneficial for the homogeneous deposition of a porous MoS2 shell on the Co9S8/α-MnS core, (iv) the porous MoS2 shell protects the electroactive core and facilitates electrolyte diffusion through the porous channels, and (v) the MoS2 shell accommodates the volume change of the Co9S8/α-MnS core upon repetitive cycling. Thus, this hybrid material (surface area: 71.3 m2 g−1) showed a greater specific capacitance (1938 F g−1 @ 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of −0.1 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 2 M KOH) compared to its oxide precursors (MnCo2O4@NC: 1096 F g−1 and MnCo2O4: 472 F g−1). The asymmetric supercapacitor, (+)Co9S8/α-MnS@NC@MoS2//2 M KOH//N-doped graphene(−), demonstrated a specific capacity of 80.2 mA h g−1 (@1 A g−1), energy density of 64.2 W h kg−1 (@729.2 W kg−1), power density of 11.3 kW kg−1 (@23.5 W h kg−1) and good cycling stability (8.1% capacitance loss after 10000 cycles @ 5 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.6 V. Cai and co-workers200 synthesized graphene a fiber–NiCo2S4 nanocomposite (GF/NiCo2S4) by coating NiCo2S4 on lightweight (0.24 g cm−3), highly conductive (39 S cm−1) and mechanically robust (221 MPa) graphene fibers via the solvothermal deposition method. Well-defined redox characteristics were observed in three-electrode CV by employing 2 M KOH electrolyte in the voltage range of 0–0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The pseudocapacitive redox reactions (Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+/Co4+) are as follows: NiS + OH− ↔ NiSOH + e−(41) CoS + OH− ↔ CoSOH + e−(42) CoSOH + OH− ↔ CoSO + H2O + e−(43)
The flexible asymmetric (+)GF/NiCo2S4//2 M KOH//GF(−) device delivered a specific capacitance of 300 F cm−3 (@175.7 mA cm−3) and power density of 1600 mW cm−3 (@12.3 mW h cm−3) together with excellent cycling stability (92% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles @ 0.4 A cm−3) within the 0–1.5 V range. Choudhary et al.201 developed flexible supercapacitors based on vertically decorated nanowires (1D-WO3-core/2D-WS2-shell) on a W-substrate via the spontaneous oxidation/sulfurization of W foil. In this design, all the components, namely, the core, shell and current-collector, were converted from a single material (W). This “one-body” supercapacitor with seamless interfaces demonstrated the following performance benefits: (i) enhanced surface area and improved diffusion kinetics due to vertically aligned nanowires, (ii) efficient carrier transport through the highly conductive and single-crystalline WO3 core, (iii) facile electrolyte ion adsorption on WS2 nanowire shells within the sub-nanometer physical gaps (van der Waals gaps) between the individual 2D layers, and (iv) high structural integrity because the core/shell and nanowire/current-collector interfaces were chemically self-assembled without any binder materials. Fig. 13(a) schematically demonstrates the synergistic effect of the “one-body” construction. This supercapacitor electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 47.5 mF cm−2 at 5 mV s−1 in the voltage range of −0.3 V to 0.5 V vs. SCE in 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte through Na+ ion-intercalation into the van der Waals gaps of 2D WS2. The various valence states of W permit the following intercalation/deintercalation mechanism. WS2 + Na+ + e− ↔ WS–Na+(44)

The durability test on this electrode showed an increment in the specific capacitance up to 74.25 mF cm−2 (@5 mV s−1) during 2500 cycles due to the activation process, and a nearly constant value was maintained over the next 27500 scans at a rate of 100 mV s−1. Fig. 13(b–f) exhibit the electrochemical characterization (CV, rate capability, GCD, durability, and EIS, respectively) of the composite electrode. Moreover, a flexible solid-state supercapacitor was assembled with Na2SO4 gel electrolyte in a symmetric configuration, which delivered a specific capacitance and energy density of 18.3 mF cm−2 and 0.06 W h cm−3, respectively, at 5 mV s−1 in the voltage window of 0–0.8 V. Patil and co-workers202 prepared a lanthanum sulfide (La2S3) electrode via a low cost and room temperature chemical route, which was tested for application in supercapacitors in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The La2S3 electrode demonstrated the Na+ ion-intercalation/deintercalation mechanism and showed a specific capacitance of 208 F g−1 (@1 mA cm−2), energy density of 35 W h kg−1 (@1 mA cm−2), power density of 1.26 kW kg−1 (@1 mA cm−2), and moderate cycle life (78% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles @ 50 mV s−1) in the voltage window of −1.1 to −0.3 V vs. SCE.
Although metal selenides are not widely utilized for pseudocapacitive applications, such as sulfides, a few reports are available in the literature. For example Peng et al.203 fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor based on petal-like cobalt selenide (Co0.85Se) nanosheets as the positive electrode and nitrogen-doped porous carbon networks (N-PCNs) as the negative electrode in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The cobalt selenide showed two pairs of redox peaks in three-electrode CV at scan rates ranging from 5 to 30 mV s−1 in the voltage range of in the voltage range of −0.1 to 0.65 V vs. Hg/HgO due to the following pseudo-faradaic reactions. Co0.85Se + OH− ↔ Co0.85SeOH + e−(45) Co0.85SeOH + OH− ↔ Co0.85SeO + H2O + e−(46)
The (+)Co0.85Se//2 M KOH//N-PCN(−) full cell delivered a power density of 7947 W kg−1 (@13.2 W h kg−1) and energy density of 21.1 W h kg−1 (@400 W kg−1), together with good cycling stability (93.8% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) in the voltage window of 0–1.6 V.
Different chemical supercapacitors based on various metallic compounds are elaborated herein from their historical origins to modern trends. Table 1 depicts a few additional representative examples of metallic compound-based supercapacitors. Furthermore, Fig. 14 demonstrates the comparative electrochemical performances of the state-of-the-art metallic compounds and composites for chemical supercapacitors. Indeed, metallic compounds are the most suitable candidates for practical chemical supercapacitors; however, the applications of some of these materials, i.e., compounds of Ru, Ni, Co, Cr, Pb, Mo, W, and In, are restricted for commercial purposes due to their cost and toxicity. The compounds of Ti, Cu, Sn, Bi, etc. are considered green-materials, but considering the cost these materials, they have limited utility in commercial products. On the other hand, compounds of Mn, Fe, V, Zn, etc. are the most favourable for commercial devices due to their low cost and environmental-friendly nature.

 Fig. 14  Comparative electrochemical performances of the state-of-the-art metallic compounds and composites for supercapacitor applications. 
5. Chemical supercapacitors based on conducting polymers
Way back in 1963, Weiss et al.239–241 from Australia first reported the conductivity of conducting polymers (CP), and in the mid-1990s, the first CP-based supercapacitors were realized.242–244 However a few years before, Gottesfeld (1987)245 and Conway (1990)246 first described the prospect of employing CPs in supercapacitors as pseudocapacitive materials. The conductivity of CP is attributed to the conjugated bond system throughout the polymer backbone. CPs can be synthesized via chemical or electrochemical oxidation/reduction of the monomers.247,248 The oxidation/reduction of the monomer and polymer are accomplished with the insertion of dopants (counter ions).249 CPs are p-doped during oxidation (dedoped at reduction) with counter anions, and n-doped during reduction (dedoped at oxidation) with counter cations, as follows: CP ↔ CPn+(A−)n + ne− (p-doping/dedoping) [A−: anion](47) CP + ne− ↔ (C+)nCPn− (n-doping/dedoping) [C+: cation](48)
Among the various CPs (Fig. 15), PANI, PPy, PTh and derivatives of PTh are attractive for supercapacitive applications.244,250 PANI and PPy are in the p-doped category, and n-doping is not possible due to the requirement of higher negative potentials, which limit the use of molecular solvent-based electrolytes.251 The possible n-dopable materials are PTh and its derivatives. However, n-doping is not possible in PTh itself in acetonitrile (AN) solvent due its large negative potential (−2 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which is responsible for solvent breakdown.252,253 Derivatives of PTh with 3-position substitution are n-dopable due to their more positive n-doping potential. Nevertheless, these n-doped CPs show lower conductivity and characterized by lower capacitance in this potential region. The physical and electrochemical properties of different CPs and p/n-doping characteristics of various PTh derivatives are shown in Tables 2 (ref. 247 and 254–256) and 3,257 respectively.

CPs are attractive materials for supercapacitors due to their (i) pseudocapacitive properties, (ii) good conductivity, (iii) lower band-gap (1–3 eV) compare to conventional polymers (∼10 eV),247 (iv) fast doping/dedoping processes, (v) suitable morphology, (vi) film-forming plastic properties, (vii) low cost, and (viii) environmental safety. In comparison to carbon-based EDLCs, CP-based supercapacitors exhibit a higher energy density (∼10 W h kg−1vs. ∼5 W h kg−1) due to pseudo-faradaic charge storage and lower power density (∼2 kW kg−1vs. ∼4 kW kg−1) because of the slower diffusion of ions into the bulk of the electrode.258 The internal resistance, self-discharge rate and cycling stability are inferior in CP-based supercapacitors than carbon-based EDLCs. Additionally, supercapacitors with the EDLC mechanism demonstrate more than half million of charge/discharge cycles, whereas CP-based devices start to degrade before a thousand cycles due to the disintegration of their polymeric network structures upon repetitive intercalation/deintercalation (doping/dedoping) of ions.258,259 High energy density is achieved in CP-based devices by increasing the doping level, which accelerates the structural degradation through the higher extent of doping/dedoping, resulting in a volume change.260 Hence, simultaneously achieving high energy density and long cycle life in pristine CP-based supercapacitors is not trivial. CP-based devices in ILs display superior cyclic performances.261,262 Nevertheless, the improvement of the operational life for CP-based devices can be possible by increasing the robustness of their polymeric moieties. A smart way to accomplish this is by designing composite electrodes by combining CPs with carbonaceous materials (AC, CB, graphite, graphene, CNTs, CNFs, GO, rGO, etc.) and metallic compounds (oxides, hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, chalcogenides, etc.).244,250 Composite electrodes have been synthesized not only to combine the properties of individual materials, but also to achieve a synergistic effect as a whole. Therefore, a prolonged operational life along with higher energy density can be achieved in CP-based systems. The opportunities and challenges of CP-based chemical supercapacitors are reviewed below.
5.1. Polyaniline and composites

Fig. 16 shows the three redox states of PANI, namely, fully reduced leucoemeraldine, partially oxidized emeraldine, and fully oxidized pernigraniline.263 Among the three states, emeraldine salt is conducting and electrochemically active, while the other two states are insulating even after protonation. In practice, a mixture of three states is present in the PANI electrode, and best electrochemical performance is expected when the proportion of emeraldine salt is the highest. The synthesis of PANI can be carried out via the oxidation of aniline monomers either via chemical or electrochemical routes.264 In the chemical oxidation method, different morphologies, such as nanofibers, nanorods, nanotubes, nanoflakes, nanospheres, and nanoflowers, can be achieved through the accurate control of oxidants or/and addition of additives.265 On the other hand, the electrochemical method is fast and free of oxidants or additives. Using this method, binder-free film electrodes are fabricated on conducting substrates,248 but only limited morphologies, such as nanofibers, nanogranules and thin films can be achieved.
 Fig. 16  Three redox forms of PANI: fully reduced leucoemeraldine, partially oxidized emeraldine and fully oxidized pernigraniline. 
In the early 2000s, Ryu et al.266 reported an LiPF6-doped PANI electrode in a two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor with 1 M Et4NBF4/AN electrolyte, which demonstrated a decline in specific capacitance from 100 to 70 F g−1 over 5000 cycles at 2 mA cm−2 in the voltage window of 0–1 V. In another study,255 the same group reported PANI-HCl (H-doped) and PANI-LiPF6 (Li-doped) electrodes for symmetric supercapacitors in 1 M Et4NBF4/AN electrolyte. PANI-HCl showed an initial capacitance of 70 F g−1, which degraded to 40 F g−1 within ∼400 cycles and then remained stable up to 1000 cycles at 1.25 mA cm−2 in the voltage window of 0.1–1.0 V. On the other hand, under the same operating conditions, PANI-LiPF6 exhibited an initial capacitance of 107 F g−1, which decreased to 84 F g−1 after 9000 cycles. In 2002, Park and Park260 developed an alkaline aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor with the (+)PANI//6 M KOH//AC(−) configuration, which showed a specific capacitance of 380 F g−1 (@0.5 mA cm−2), energy density of 18 W h kg−1 (@0.5 mA cm−2) and power density of 1.25 kW kg−1 (@20 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 1–1.6 V. The device exhibited excellent cycling stability, i.e., ∼20% loss of initial capacitance in the first 300 cycles, and thereafter maintained a steady capacitance of up to 4000 cycles at 50 mV s−1 in the voltage window of 0.8–1.6 V. In 2004, Sivakkumar and Saraswathi267 reported PANI-derivatives, namely, poly(n-methyl aniline) (PNMA), for energy storage systems. Due to the blocking the proton exchange sites by the methyl group, this polymer showed greater chemical stability and superior redox activity. The (+)PNMA//Li(−) device with 1 M LiClO4 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC) electrolyte achieved a capacity of 52 mA h g−1 at 100 μA cm−2 in the voltage window of 2.5–3.6 V. In 2005, Zhou and co-workers268 electrochemically polymerized aniline on an SS substrate via the pulse galvanostatic method (PGM) and galvanostatic method (GM) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Herein, the authors demonstrated different morphologies of PANI and their performances by altering the electrodeposition methods. Eventually, the nanofibrous morphology was achieved by PGM, while GM provided a granular morphology. The experimental results indicate the superior performances of the nanofibrous PANI compared to the granular morphology because of the larger surface area and ionic conductivity of the former. The symmetrical supercapacitor based on nanofibrous PANI in 1 M NaClO4/1 M HClO4 (aq.) electrolyte delivered a specific capacitance of 609 F g−1 (@1.5 mA cm−2), energy density of 26.8 W h kg−1 (@1.5 mA cm−2) and moderate cycling performance (12% capacitance loss after 1000 cycles @ 2.5 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–0.75 V. In 2009, Li et al.269 firstly estimated the theoretical mass specific capacitance of PANI by considering the EDLC and pseudocapacitive effects, and compared it with experimental data. The maximum specific capacitance was calculated to be 2.0 × 103 F g−1 by assuming 100% of the PANI is oxidized or reduced in the charge/discharge processes. The PANI nanofiber-deposited SS electrodes in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte were used for CV (in three-electrode cell), EIS (in three-electrode cell) and GCD (in two-electrode cell) analysis to determine the experimental specific capacitance of PANI. Consequently, the specific capacitances achieved were 608, 445, and 524.9 F g−1 in CV, EIS and GCD, which are only 30%, 22% and 26% of the theoretical value, respectively. This mismatch indicates the lower utilization of PANI in the charge/discharge operations. The lower extent of PANI utilization is attributed to the slower diffusion of dopants (counter anions) and the conductivity of PANI. In reality, the dopants can intercalate/deintercalate in/from the outer surface of the PANI fiber (shell) at an appreciable rate, but the slower diffusion is unavoidable in the inner core of fiber due to the inaccessibility of the dopants. On the other hand, the conductivity of PANI regulates the electron transfer rate and influences the extent of the redox reaction. Therefore, designing an advanced morphology (capable of fast ion diffusion) and improving the electrode conductivity may increase the experimental specific capacitance of PANI. As an example of an advance morphology design, Wang et al.270 developed vertically aligned PANI nanowire arrays on an Au substrate, and tested its performance in 1 M HClO4 (aq.) electrolyte in a three-electrode cell configuration. The as-prepared vertical arrays of PANI nanowires (Fig. 17(a and b)) with narrow diameters (∼50 nm) facilitated fast ion diffusion under supercapacitive operations. The Nyquist plot in EIS (Fig. 17(c)) showed the solution resistance, ion diffusion resistance and charge transfer resistance of 0.6, 0.39 and 0.12 Ω, respectively, which indicate the fast kinetics of the PANI nanowire array electrode. Fig. 17(d and e) depict the CV and GCD profiles, respectively, for the PANI nanowires. However, the PANI electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 950 F g−1 (@1 A g−1), an energy density of 130 W h kg−1 (@700 W kg−1), a power density of 28000 W kg−1 (@100 W h kg−1) and moderate cycling stability (16% capacitance loss at 300 cycles followed by 6% capacitance loss in subsequent 400 cycles @ 20 A g−1) in the voltage range of 0–0.7 V vs. SCE.

Beyond the pure PANI electrode, binary composites including PANI/carbon or PANI/metallic compounds are promising candidates for supercapacitors. Liu et al.271 synthesized a SWCNT/PANI (core/shell) composite through in situ electrochemical polymerization cycles in 1 M H2SO4 medium. In this process, a free-standing SWCNT/PANI composite was prepared, where PANI was deposited on SWCNT bucky paper and generated a tubular structure with a diameter of about 50–100 nm. The composite electrode prepared by 90 polymerization cycles demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 501.8 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.75 V vs. SCE, which increases up to 706.7 F g−1 by 5 cycles of controlled electrodegradation. The off-laying disordered PANI was dissolved and polycrystalline PANI regions were exposed to the electrolyte by controlled electrodegradation, which is responsible for the improved capacitance. However, the overall higher capacitance value achieved here is due to the synergism between SWCNT and PANI. Specifically, π–π interactions exist between the π-bonded surface of the SWCNT and the conjugated structure of PANI, which control the morphology of PANI deposited. On the other hand, the SWCNT network acts as a template and accelerates the nucleation/growth kinetics of PANI. Moreover, the strong π–π interactions increase the coefficient of charge transfer from the PANI redox active sites to SWCNTs, and thus the utilization of active material becomes maximum. This synergistic effect is attributed to improving the electrochemical performances of the SWCNT/PANI composite compared to the individual component. Lu and co-workers272 synthesized highly ordered 3D α-Fe2O3@PANI core–shell nanowire arrays through a simple cost effective electrodeposition method (Fig. 18(a)), and assembled a (+)PANI@CC//1 M Na2SO4 (aq.)//α-Fe2O3@PANI(−) asymmetric device (Fig. 18(b)). This asymmetric device delivered a specific capacitance of 2.02 mF cm−3 (@5 mV s−1), energy density of 0.35 mW h cm−3 (@120.51 mW cm−3) and excellent cycling performance (95.77% capacitance retention over 10000 cycles @ 50 mV s−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.5 V. Fig. 18(c–e) presents the CV profiles of the individual electrode, full cell CV and full cell GCD, respectively, for the asymmetric device. This superb electrochemical performance of the asymmetric device is ascribed to the hierarchical 3D core–shell nanowire arrays of PANI/α-Fe2O3, which provide a large redox active surface area, fast ion and electron transfer with good structural stability. Zhang et al.273 synthesized a PANI/Ni(OH)2 composite via a two-step hydrothermal route, where 1D fiber-like PANI was decorated with 3D flower-like Ni(OH)2. In this synthetic route, PANI acted as a crystal growth modifier for Ni(OH)2, and hence, the β- to α-phase conversion of Ni(OH)2 was accomplished. Therefore, the morphology of was Ni(OH)2 converted from nano-plate to 3D flower-like structure, which facilitated the charge transfer kinetics and improved the contacts between Ni(OH)2 and PANI. Consequently, the utilization of the active material improved drastically. The PANI/Ni(OH)2 composite electrode showed a good specific capacity (55.50 C g−1 @ 0.5 mA cm−2), high rate capability (74.18% capacity retention from 0.5 to 2.5 mA cm−2) and moderate cycle life (79.49% capacity retention after 2500 cycles @ 1.5 mA cm−2) in the voltage range of −0.5 to 0.5 V vs. SCE in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte. Zhu and co-workers274 demonstrated a facile way to produce a multi-component architecture by combining thin MoS2 nanosheets and PANI nanoneedle arrays via an ice-reaction process. This binary PANI/MoS2 composite provided a high surface area (114 m2 g−1, whereas 10 and 75 m2 g−1 for branched PANI and exfoliated MoS2, respectively), good electrical conductivity and fast ionic diffusion, which led to higher energy and power densities. The PANI/MoS2-based symmetric device with 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte delivered specific capacitances of 669, 821 and 853 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of ±0.6, ±0.8 and ±1.0 V, respectively, which are higher than that of the pristine PANI (capacitance: 397, 457 and 433 F g−1) and exfoliated MoS2 (capacitance: 250, 322 and 341 F g−1), respectively. Furthermore, the device displayed 91% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 10 A g−1 within the window of ±0.6 V. The composite electrode achieved enhanced performances due to the following advanced features: (i) thin MoS2 nanosheet facilitates ion diffusion and the interlayer acts as an ion reservoir, (ii) the PANI nanoneedle allows the effective insertion of proton into the bulk and improves the electron transport, (iii) its flexible structure easily accommodates the volume change, which is associated with proton intercalation/deintercalation, and (iv) nanostructuring reduces the diffusion length of the electrolyte ions, and hence, high power capability is expected.

Ternary composites including PANI, carbonaceous materials, and metallic compounds open a new direction for next-generation chemical supercapacitors. As an example, Das et al.275 synthesized a PANI/MoO3/graphene nanoplate ternary composite (PMG) via the in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of MoO3 and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP). The morphological analysis through SEM and TEM demonstrated a fibrillar PANI coating on the MoO3/GNP composite. The measured surface area for the pristine PANI, GNP, PANI/GNP and PMG was 91.698, 148.089, 113.331 and 78.055 m2 g−1, with the corresponding total pore volume of 1.460, 0.477, 0.937 and 0.543 cm3 g−1 at P/P0 = 0.999341, respectively. The as-prepared PMG composite was semiconductor in nature, which was identified by its non-linear current–voltage characteristics. Additionally, the conductivity values of PANI, PANI/GNP and PMG were estimated to be 1.940 × 10−5, 1.605 × 10−4 and 1.216 × 10−4 S m−1, respectively, from the current–voltage profiles. This result indicates that highly conducting GNP improves the conductivity of the PANI/GNP composite compared to the pristine PANI, while, nonconducting MoO3 decreases the conductivity of PMG compared to that PANI/GNP to a small extent. The specific capacitances of PANI, PANI/GNP and PMG were estimated to be 295, 442 and 593 F g−1, respectively, at 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of −0.3 to 0.8 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance of the PMG composite over PANI and PANI/GNP is primarily attributed to the higher extent of pseudocapacitive reactions in the MoO3 component. The PMG composite delivered the energy and power densities of 99.68 W h kg−1 (@1 A g−1) and 1678.99 W kg−1 (@3 A g−1), respectively. The PMG electrode showed greater cycling stability (92.4% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1) compared to the PANI (85.84%) and PANI/GNP composite (89.37%). The EIS analysis revealed that the PMG composite showed the lowest charge transfer resistance compared to the pristine PANI and PANI/GNP composite, which is due to excellent synergistic effect in the ternary composite.
5.2. Polypyrrole and composites
PPy is an important CP for supercapacitor electrodes due to its advantages, including easy synthesis, great flexibility, high capacitance and good cycling stability. The density of PPy is high, and consequently high volumetric capacitances (400–500 F cm−3) are expected.276 However, slow ion diffusion in the bulk of the electrode is unavoidable due to its dense polymeric structure, which limits the gravimetric capacitances (250–350 F g−1) especially for a thicker coating on electrodes.250 PPy is generally doped with single-charged anions (Cl−, ClO4−, SO3−, etc.), but doping with multi-charged anions, such as SO42−, creates cross-linked polymers.249 Suematsu et al.249 mentioned that high diffusivity and high capacitance are expected from cross-linked PPy due to its greater porosity in the polymeric growth. However, this group reported the volumetric capacitance of 100–230 F cm−3 in the electrode potential range of −0.6 to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are much lower than that typically reported (400–500 F cm−3) for dense PPy electrodes. In 2003, Iroh and Levine277 reported the improved charge storage properties of PPy by polyimide (a dopant with high molecular weight) doping, which is due to the protection of PPy from oxidative degradation by the polyimide matrix. It is noteworthy that PPy is anodically electroactive and polyimide is cathodically electroactive. The authors analysed the capacitance characteristics of the PPy/polyimide electrode in 0.01 M KPF6/AN electrolyte through an EIS study, where the anode and cathode capacitances were in the range of about 1.5–1.9 mF and 1.5–0.4 mF in the voltage range of 0–0.9 V and 0–1.2 V vs. SCE, respectively. In 2015, Yang et al.278 synthesized free-standing PPy films via oil/water interfacial polymerization in the presence of surfactants. The morphology of the PPy films depended on the choice of surfactant, for example, porous and vesicular structures were obtained using Tween80 and Span80 surfactants, respectively. Moreover, lowering the polymerization temperature resulted in more and smaller pores or vesicles in the PPy film structures. The PPy films polymerized at 0 °C with Tween80 showed a specific capacitance of 261 F g−1 at 25 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.6 V vs. SCE. By keeping the other parameters the same, the specific capacitance was observed to be 149 F g−1 when polymerization occurred at 25 °C. This result is attributed for the following reasons: the PPy films with smaller pores (polymerization @ 0 °C) provided higher conductivity than that with larger pores (polymerization @ 25 °C), and their respective conductivity values were 4.7 and 3.5 S cm−1, respectively. However, the optimized PPy film electrode (polymerized at 0 °C with Tween80) exhibited good cycling stability, such as 75% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 25 mV s−1. Intrinsic PPy flexible films were prepared by Li and Yang279via a chemical oxidation method with a methylorange–FeCl3 reactive self-degradable template. Morphological analysis by SEM and TEM confirmed the nanotubular structure of PPy with a diameter of 50–60 nm and length of 5–6 μm when the molar ratio of FeCl3 to monomer was 0.5. The PPy films exhibited a specific capacitance of 576 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.7 V vs. SCE in 1 M KCl (aq.) electrolyte and retained 82% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at 3 A g−1. The EIS study demonstrated a lower ESR (0.75 Ω) and charge-transfer resistance (8.9 Ω) of the PPy films, which are the key for fast ion diffusion and improved conductivity of the electrodes. In 2016, Rajesh et al.280 deposited phytic acid-doped PPy films on Ti and SS substrates via an electropolymerization method. Fig. 19(a and b) show the chemical structure of phytic acid and phytic acid-doped PPy chain, respectively. The specific capacitance and energy density of the PPy films on Ti achieved were 343 F g−1 and 47.64 W h kg−1, respectively, at 5 mV s−1 within −0.2 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Under similar conditions, PPy films on SS showed the specific capacitance and energy density of 297 F g−1 and 41.25 W h kg−1, respectively. Moreover, these PPy film-based electrodes retained 77% and 91% initial capacitance after 4000 cycles at 10 A g−1 for Ti and SS substrates, respectively. However, based on the above discussion, it is evident that the microstructure of PPy and its electrochemical performances are greatly influenced by several factors, such as synthesis method, template, dopant, and substrate. Thus, the optimization of these factors may improve the supercapacitive performances of pristine PPy-based electrodes. Nevertheless, investigations on PPy composites with carbonaceous materials and metallic compounds are truly indispensable.

A novel core–shell PPy/GO nanocomposite with uniform PPy nanospheres was synthesized by Wu et al.281 through an in situ surface-initiated polymerization method. PPy nanospheres (∼70 nm) were uniformly grown on GO sheets, which formed a continuous core–shell composite structure. In the composite structure, the possible interactions between PPy and GO are π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces, as demonstrated in Fig. 19(c). Furthermore, the composite electrodes were electrochemically tested through EIS, GCD and CV in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The EIS study showed lower resistive characteristics for the PPy/GO composite (Rs: 1.81 Ω and Rct: 0.07 Ω) compare to that of pristine PPy (Rs: 2.04 Ω and Rct: 0.11 Ω). In the Nyquist plot, PPy/GO showed a more perpendicular line in the lower frequency region than PPy, which implies the better capacitive behaviour with faster ion diffusion in PPy/GO. Due to its improved resistive behaviour, the PPy/GO composite showed a better specific capacitance of 370 F g−1 than that of the pristine PPy (216 F g−1) at 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of −0.2 to 0.8 V vs. SCE. The cycling stabilities of the PPy/GO and PPy electrodes were demonstrated as 91.2% and 57.8% capacitance retention over 4000 CV scans at 100 mV s−1, respectively. The mechanically robust GO impeded the structural degradation of PPy upon repetitive cycling, and hence, improved durability was achieved. Besides employing carbonaceous nanostructures (such as graphene, GO, rGO, CNT, CNF, etc.) in PPy composites, PPy/AC,282 PPy/graphite sheets,283 PPy/CC,284etc. are also attractive supercapacitive materials considering large scale production with lower cost. On the other hand, Zhou and co-workers285 developed well-aligned PPy/CoO hybrid nanowires grown on 3D nickel foam, where PPy was uniformly immobilized or strongly anchored on the surface of the CoO nanowires. The well-aligned mesoporous hybrid nanowires facilitated fast ion migration towards the bulk due to the shorter diffusion pathways through the ordered structures. In 3 M NaOH medium, the composite electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 2223 F g−1 (vs. 1212 F g−1 for pristine CoO) at 1 mA cm−2 in the voltage window of −0.2 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with good cycling stability (99.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2). An asymmetric device (+)PPy/CoO@Ni//3 M NaOH//AC@Ni(−) was fabricated, which delivered an energy density of 43.5 W h kg−1 (@87.5 W kg−1), power density of 5500 W kg−1 (@11.8 W h kg−1) and excellent cycling performance (91.5% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles at 25 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–1.8 V. Zhu et al.286 improved the electrochemical performances of PPy films by intercalating them into the interlayer spacing of layered-Ti3C2 (l-Ti3C2). The homogeneous l-Ti3C2 MXene particles were synthesized via selective HF-etching of the Al layer in the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase and electrophoretically deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and subsequently PPy films were successfully intercalated into l-Ti3C2via electrochemical polymerization. Fig. 20(a and b) demonstrate the structural characteristics of the PPy/l-Ti3C2 composite films, where PPy films are sandwiched between layers of Ti3C2. The capacitance of the PPy/l-Ti3C2 films achieved was 203 mF cm−2 (i.e., 406 F cm−3), which is ∼35% higher than that of the pristine PPy film (150 mF cm−2; 300 F cm−3) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 1 mA cm−2 in the voltage range of 0–0.5 V vs. SCE. Moreover, the composite films showed no capacitance loss after 20000 cycles at the abovementioned current density and voltage window, while the pristine PPy films exhibited ∼30% capacitance loss. The improved performances of the composite films are ascribed to the following reasons: (i) dense stacking of PPy is prevented by the distributed l-Ti3C2 particles, which boosts the electrolyte infiltration; (ii) the strong interactions between the PPy backbone and Ti3C2 surface increase the structural stability of the composite film; and (iii) the intercalated structure improves the diffusion kinetics of charge-carrier transportation. A symmetric solid-state supercapacitor device was assembled, which delivered an energy density of 10 mW h cm−3 (@500 mW cm−3) and splendid cycling stability (no capacitance loss after 10000 cycles @ 0.5 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–0.5 V. Fig. 20(c–e) shows the CV, GCD and cycle life profiles, respectively, for the symmetric full cell. The flexibility of the solid-state device was tested at different bending and relaxed states, which showed no performance variation (Fig. 20(f)). Liu et al.287 fabricated a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device using graphene foam (GF)/CNT/MnO2 as the positive electrode and GF/CNT/PPy as the negative electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte. The GF/CNT/MnO2 positive active material was prepared via the hydrothermal method, where MnO2 was deposited on the GF/CNT film. On the other hand, the GF/CNT/PPy negative active material was synthesized via the chemical polymerization route. Fig. 21(a) presents the individual CV profiles of the positive and negative electrodes in the voltage window of 0.0–1.0 V and −0.6 to 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The CV profiles demonstrated the ideal pseudo-faradaic charge storage mechanism for both the positive and negative electrodes. The asymmetric device delivered an energy density of 22.8 W h kg−1 (@860 W Kg−1) and a power density of 2700 W kg−1 (@6.2 W h kg−1) together with moderate cycling performances (83.5% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles @ 1.5 mA cm−2) in the voltage window of 0–1.6 V regime. Fig. 21(b–d) provide the characteristics features of the CV, GCD and flexibility (bending) tests for the asymmetric device. Moreover, two full cells connected in series could illuminate three LEDs (1.8 V, 20 mA and 5 mm diameter) after charging for 30 s (Fig. 21(e)).

Zhou and co-workers288 developed a ternary composite with PPy, CNT and MnO2, where PPy modified the CNT-surface before encapsulation by MnO2, and constructed a 3D uniform core–shell nanostructure of CNT–MnO2. In the 3D hierarchical CNT@PPy@MnO2 composite, PPy acted as the glue and improved the adhesion between CNT and MnO2, leading to the high cycling stability of composite electrodes. Moreover, the core–shell CNT@PPy@MnO2 nanostructures decreased the contact resistance in the electrode/electrolyte and achieved a higher surface area. The specific capacitances of CNT@PPy@MnO2 and CNT@MnO2 were determined to be 529.3 and 293.4 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0–1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) electrolyte, respectively. In the Nyquist plots, CNT@PPy@MnO2 and CNT@MnO2 showed inclination angles of about 60° and 35°, respectively, implying the better capacitive behaviour of the ternary composite than the binary composite. The resistive components were also lower in the ternary composite (Rs: 2.8 Ω) than the binary composite (Rs: 3.2 Ω). These superior results for CNT@PPy@MnO2 are mainly attributed to the fast charge transfer through the PPy linker and fast ion transfer in the ordered 3D hierarchical nanostructures. The CNT@PPy@MnO2 electrode exhibited a capacitance retention of ∼98.5%, which is much better than that of CNT@MnO2 (79.6%) at 5 A g−1 for 1000 cycles. A symmetric device [(+)CNT@PPy@MnO2//1 M Na2SO4 (aq.)//CNT@PPy@MnO2(−)] and an asymmetric device [(+)CNT@PPy@MnO2//1 M Na2SO4 (aq.)//AC(−)] were assembled and their performance tested. The symmetric device delivered an energy density of 9.34 W h kg−1 (@100 W kg−1), power density of 5000 W kg−1 (@5.56 W h kg−1) and good cycle life (87.2% capacitance retention after 2000 cycling @ 5 A g−1) within 1–2 V operating window. It is noteworthy that the binary CNT@MnO2 composite-based symmetric device showed only 73.7% capacitance retention under similar operating conditions. On the other hand, the asymmetric device demonstrated an energy density of 38.42 W h kg−1 (@100 W kg−1), power density of 30000 W kg−1 (@11.11 W h kg−1) and good cycling stability (89.7% capacitance retention over 2000 cycling @ 5 A g−1) in the voltage window of 1–2 V. Further, the flexibility of the asymmetric device was tested through repetitive CV scans at 50 mV s−1, and the result indicates 64.74% capacitance retention after 200 bending (180°) cycles, which recommends appreciable bending stability for flexible operations. Xie and Wang289 developed a ternary PPy/TiN/PANI coaxial nanotube hybrid via the successive loading of PPy and PANI onto a TiN nanotube array through an electropolymerization route. The pulse voltammetric (0.7 to 1.1 V vs. SCE) electrodeposition method was applied for synthesizing the binary PPy/TiN nanotube hybrid, while, aniline was electropolymerized on the PPy/TiN nanotubes via CV (−0.2 to 1.1 V vs. SCE) scans. Here, p-doped PPy and n-doped PANI were smartly integrated with a conducting TiN nanotube substrate as a ternary composite. The specific capacitances observed were 1471.9, 744.8 and 846.1 F g−1 for PPy/TiN/PANI, PPy/TiN and PANI/TiN, respectively, at 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage window of −2 to 0.6 V vs. SCE in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The higher capacitance of the ternary nanotube hybrid compared to both binary systems is attributed due to the synergistic effect of PPy and PANI. A poor cycling performance was observed for PPy/TiN/PANI, i.e., 78%, 46.3% and 38.8% capacitance retention after 200, 500 and 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1, respectively. The authors believed that the exfoliation of PANI films and the electrochemical corrosion of TiN in the experimental medium were responsible for its low durability. An all-solid-state symmetric device with the PPy/TiN/PANI composite in H2SO4/ethylene glycol (EG)/PVA gel electrolyte was assembled and the device delivers a specific capacitance of 288.4 F g−1, energy density of 129.8 W h kg−1 and power density of 0.9 kW kg−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0–1.8 V. Furthermore, at a current density of 20 A g−1, the values of 187.5 F g−1, 84.4 W h kg−1 and 18 kW kg−1, respectively, which indicate its excellent power capability.
5.3. Polythiophene, polythiophene-derivatives and composites

Tables 3 (ref. 257) and 4 (ref. 290) present the electrochemical properties of different p- and n-doped PTh derivatives, and it can be observed that the n-dopable forms deliver a lower specific capacitance than the p-dopable forms, which is mainly due to their lower conductivity. Hence, the applications of n-dopable forms in the negative electrodes of full cells are truly limited. Very few instances are available in the literature, where n-doped PTh or its derivatives were used in negative electrodes. In 1995, Arbizzani et al.291 assembled a symmetric supercapacitor based on PDTT in tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4)/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte, where p- and n-doped polymers were used as the positive and negative active materials, respectively. The EIS study demonstrated that the specific capacitance of p-doped PDTT is 106.4 mF cm−2 at 1.26 MHz, but the n-doped form exhibited only 43.2 mF cm−2 at the same frequency. Moreover, n-doped PTh is not stable in air and moisture, while p-doped PTh is quite stable. Consequently, n-doped PTh showed high self-discharge (tendency to oxidize back to the neutral state) and low cycling stability. Thus, to overcome the abovementioned factors, PTh derivatives with a lower band-gap (i.e., n-doping potential becomes less negative) can be designed. The substitution of 3-position in the thiophene ring with phenyl, ethyl and alkoxy groups improves the stability towards air and moisture.292 The electron withdrawing groups attached with these substitutions further improve the stability of n-doped PTh derivatives. Fig. 15(H) depicts the general structure of 3-substituted PTh derivatives.

Among the various derivatives of PTh, PEDOT has remarkable prospects in CP-based supercapacitors244,247 due to its (i) low oxidation potential, (ii) wide potential window, (iii) low band-gap (1–3 eV) and highly conducting p-doped state (300–500 S cm−1), (iv) good thermal and chemical stabilities, (v) high charge mobility and fast electrochemical kinetics, and (vi) good film forming property. However, PEDOT has a high molecular weight with lower doping level, and thus delivers a low specific capacitance (Table 2). Lota et al.247 reported a specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 for a PEDOT thin film, but the value for a pellet (10–20 mg) was reported to be 80–100 F g−1. In 2004, Ryu and co-workers293 designed symmetric [(+)PEDOT//PEDOT(−)] and asymmetric [(+)PEDOT//AC(−)] supercapacitors with Et4NBF4-PC and LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolytes and tested their performance in the voltage windows of 0–1 V and 0–3 V. In the window of 0–1 V, the symmetric device with Et4NBF4-PC and LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolyte showed the specific capacitances of 22 and 27 F g−1 at 0.25 mA cm−2 after 1000 cycles, respectively. In contrast, that for the asymmetric device was 19 and 50 F g−1, respectively. Similarly, in the voltage window of 0–3 V, the symmetric device exhibited specific capacitances of 20 and 13 F g−1 and the asymmetric device delivered 30 and 56 F g−1 for the Et4NBF4-PC and LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolytes, respectively. PFPT is another promising CP for supercapacitor applications. Laforgue et al.294 reported the fabrication of (+)PFPT//1 M NEt4BF4-PC//AC(−) asymmetric devices using 4 and 60 cm2 electrodes for the test cells and industrial prismatic prototypes, respectively. The test cells delivered the maximum energy density of 48 W h kg−1 (; C = capacitance, and Vmax = maximum voltage in operating window) and maximum power density of 9 kW kg−1 (Pmax = V2/4R; V = starting discharge voltage excluding ohmic drop, and R = internal resistance) in the voltage window of 1.2–3.0 V window, while the industrial prototypes exhibited the values of 7.5 W h kg−1 and 250 W kg−1 in the voltage window of 1–3 V, respectively. The initial 2000 F capacitance of the industrial prototype dropped to 1000 F within the first 100 cycles, and remained stable up to 8000 cycles at 5 A current in the voltage window of 1–3 V. Another important PTh derivative is PMeT, and Arbizzani et al.295 developed a (+)PMeT//1 M Et4NBF4-PC//AC(−) asymmetric supercapacitor, which showed a specific capacitance of 39 F g−1 (@5 mA cm−2), energy density of 30 W h kg−1 (@500 W kg−1) and power density of 1810 W kg−1 (@19 W h kg−1) in the voltage window of 1–3 V. Pristine PTh and its derivatives show poor supercapacitive performances, and thus it is hard to realize practical devices with these inferior active materials. Accordingly, composite materials can overcome the intrinsic shortcomings of pristine polymers and provide much superior energy materials.
A binary composite of PTh with MWCNTs was prepared by Zhang et al.296via electropolymerization in an oil-in-IL microemulsion, where MWCNTs were homogeneously encapsulated by PTh with a thickness of 2–3 nm. The PTh/MWCNT composite with an interlaced framework morphology was electrochemically characterized in 1 M Na2SO4 (aq.) solution by constructing a three-electrode cell assembly. The quasi-rectangular CV at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in the voltage window of −0.6 to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl indicates the pseudocapacitive behaviours of the PTh/MWCNT composite. Moreover, a higher current response (2.63 A g−1) was observed for PTh/MWCNT compared to the pristine PTh (1.08 A g−1) and pristine MWCNT (1.75 A g−1). Notably, the nucleation and growth of PTh in the oil/IL microemulsion were controlled in such a way that the PTh films were interwoven with the MWCNTs. Consequently, an open framework structure was achieved, which is beneficial for fast ionic transportation. The fast diffusion kinetics together with high surface area and electrical conductivity improved the electrochemical current response in the composite material compared to that of its pristine components. The specific capacitance achieved for the composite material was 216 F g−1 with the charge loading of 300 mC at a current density of 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of −0.6 to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which dropped to below 160 F g−1 after 500 repetitive cycles under the same operations. Alabadi and co-workers297 developed GO/PTCB and graphite/PTCB (PTCB: poly[(thiophene-2,5-diyl)-co-(benzylidene)]) composites through non-covalent interactions (van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds) between PTCB and GO or graphite sheets. The PTCB-modified GO or graphite sheets showed pores and wrinkles surfaces, which enhanced the electrochemically active surface area and the supercapacitive performances. The room temperature electrical conductivity of the GO/PTCB and graphite/PTBC composites was reported to be 33 and 1 S cm−1, respectively, which were much greater than that of the pristine PTh (0.167 S cm−1).298 However, the specific capacitances of GO/PTCB and graphite/PTCB were 296 and 217 F g−1, respectively, at 0.3 A g−1 in the voltage window of −1 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl window in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The capacitance retention of 91.86% and 75.56% after 4000 cycles at 0.3 A g−1 was observed for the GO/PTCB and graphite/PTCB composites, respectively. The GO/PTCB composite delivered an energy density of 148 W h kg−1 (@41.6 W kg−1) and power density of 24.8 kW kg−1 (@102 W h kg−1) in the abovementioned voltage window. In 2001, Hong et al.299 prepared an RuOx-deposited PEDOT electrode via a dipping-hydrolysis and electrolysis method. The CV and EIS studies depicted that the composite electrode operated under both non-faradaic and pseudo-faradaic mechanisms, and consequently, a high specific capacitance was achieved compared to pristine PEDOT. The optimized composite structure showed a specific capacitance of 420 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 in the voltage window of 0–1 V vs. SCE in 0.5 M H2SO4. The symmetric cells based on PEDOT and PEDOT/RuOx stored specific capacities of 12.4 and 27.5 mA h g−1, respectively, when the cells were charged in the voltage range of 0–1 V at a current in the range of 100 to 400 mA cm−2. Interestingly, the increase in current density (100–400 mA cm−2) did not reduce the stored capacities. Moreover, the stored energy densities were calculated to be 12.4 and 27.5 W h kg−1, respectively, for the PEDOT and PEDOT/RuOx-based cells. Ambade and co-workers300 synthesized a PTh/TiO2 nanocomposite via the controlled electropolymerization of thiophene on TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs). This synthetic scheme allowed the thiophene monomers to infiltrate into the nanoporous matrix and deposit on the surface of the TNTs (length: 4–5 μm and diameter: ∼100 nm). The specific capacitances of PTh/TiO2, PTh and TiO2 were estimated to be 640, 24 and 0.65 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in the voltage window of −0.8 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In the GCD experiment, the PTh/TiO2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 632 F g−1 (@2 A g−1), energy density of 237 W h kg−1 (@2100 W kg−1) and moderate cycling stability (89% capacitance retention after 1100 cycles @ 2 A g−1) in the voltage window of 0–0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. By contrast, the pristine PTh electrode showed 62% capacitance retention after 1100 cycles under a similar cycling schedule. The superior cycling performance of PTh/TiO2 over the PTh electrode is attributed to the excellent mechanical stability of TNTs, which prevented the structural disintegration of PTh over repetitive doping/dedoping processes. Notably, the specific capacitances of PTh and its derivatives are comparatively lower than that of PANI and PPy, and therefore, the diverse binary and ternary composites of the PTh family are actually limited.
The design, development and electrochemical characterization of chemical supercapacitors based on PANI, PPy, PTh and derivatives of PTh have been consolidated herein. Further detailed literature screening on CP-based supercapacitors is presented in Table 5. In addition, Fig. 22 displays the comparative supercapacitive performances of the most popular CP-based active materials. Besides the PANI, PPy and PTh family, another class of CPs, namely redox CPs, are also reported in the literature, which are functionalized by redox active moieties to enhance their electrochemical performances. Poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (pDAAQ) with a redox active anthraquinone moiety is an example of a redox CP.251 Another example is poly(2,2′-dithiodianiline) (pDTDA),354 which a shows high specific capacity of 238 mA h g−1 (@2.3 V voltage window), high conductivity of 0.3–2.0 S cm−1 (@−2.0 to 0.8 V) and fast redox kinetics for the simultaneous occurrence of two redox reactions. The symmetric device with pDTDA showed energy and power densities of 25–46 W h kg−1 and 10.2–30.5 kW kg−1, respectively, at a discharge rate in the range of 30–90 C. However, the commercial prospects of these polymers are limited due to their complex synthetic routes with high cost. In brief, PANI and PPy show very promising impacts for commercialization due to their environment-friendly synthesis, low cost raw materials, no air and moisture sensitivity, and finally great electrochemical performances.

 Fig. 22  Performance comparison of different conducting polymers and their composites for supercapacitor applications. Achieving a higher specific capacitance is not the prime objective of ternary composites; rather, improving structural integrity, and consequently, cycling stability is achieved. 
6. Summary and future directions
This review demonstrated the journey of chemical supercapacitors from the first reported articles to recent developments. Conceptually, chemical supercapacitors originate from capacitors and have developed from EDL-based supercapacitors by incorporating facile surface-faradaic electron transfer processes. Various metallic compounds and conducting polymers are found to be suitable as the active materials of chemical supercapacitors. Nevertheless, pristine metallic compounds and conducting polymers limit the electrochemical performances of devices due to their inherent drawbacks, which may be overcome by employing different mitigation strategies through unique material engineering, i.e., forming conducting composites, nanostructuring, core/shell structure formation, morphology modification, and surface modulation. Most metal oxides and hydroxides are electronically insulating, which impedes the fast electron transfer between particles, and consequently slow reaction kinetics are observed. The composites with conducting carbons and polymers enhance the overall conductivity of the active materials, resulting in improved kinetic behaviours. Mixed metallic oxides and hydroxides show greater electrical conductivity due to the synergistic effects among multiple metallic sites. Defect modulation through the tuning of metal vacancies in solid crystals also enhances the electrical conductivity. Metal carbides, nitrides, phosphides, phosphates, phosphites, chalcogenides and conducting polymers have higher electrical conductivity compared to oxides and hydroxides, which indicates their better kinetic characteristics. Surface passivation is an important limitation for carbides, nitrides and phosphides in aqueous media, which restricts the performances of the devices. Different surface modulations, such as surface coating and elemental doping, and the optimization of the electrolyte medium are commonly accepted ways to tackle the surface passivation issue. The volume change of the particles upon charge/discharge is a common problem for all promising materials, i.e., oxides, hydroxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphides, phosphates, phosphites, chalcogenides, and conducting polymers, which results in the pulverization of the active material particles. This event reduces the structural integrity of the electrodes and the durability of the devices is shortened. Various mitigation strategies are applied, which include nanostructuring, core/shell structure, and morphology control by incorporating void space in the particle. The buffer space is mandatory to sustain the volume change during cycling, and thus, pulverization of particles is prevented. To improve the structural integrity of the active materials, the formation of composites with robust support is truly indispensable. For example, conducting polymer-based electrodes show a limited cycle life, which can be improved by forming composites with mechanically sturdy carbonaceous materials (graphene, GO, rGO, CNTs, CNFs, etc.) and metallic compounds. Nanostructuring is an important modification route in materials science, which improves the electrochemical behaviours of the active materials by increasing their surface area and porosity. The kinetic characteristics of devices are also improved by nanostructuring due to the increase in the electrolyte infiltration rate and shortening of the diffusion lengths for electrolyte ions. Moreover, the additional porosity due to nanostructuring acts as a buffer region, which can sustain the excessive volume change of particles upon cycling. The above-discussed modifications greatly improve the electrochemical performances of chemical supercapacitors by increasing their specific capacitance (i.e., superior energy density), reducing their internal resistance (i.e., superior power density) and prolonging their cycling stability. Furthermore, based on these material engineering, metallic compounds and conducting polymers can be envisaged for successful chemical supercapacitors, bringing a paradigm shift in supercapacitor technology.
In reality, scaled-up stand-alone devices with these engineered materials are truly in their nascent stages of development, and further innovative steps need to be considered. Thus, here we identify a few futuristic directions for the successful realization of chemical supercapacitor devices.
(i) Multi-variant characteristics of pseudocapacitive processes in various active materials need to be theoretically modelled and validated to be the same using in situ and ex situ experimental tools, allowing exact charge storage mechanisms to be understood. For example, composite active materials (binary, ternary and even quaternary) are indispensable for successful devices. The design of these materials is not trivial. Thus, computational designs of composite materials from fundamental scientific knowledge are highly appreciable and their theoretical performances for supercapacitive applications need to be evaluated. If the theoretical performance data pass the required benchmarks, then these materials should be characterized experimentally through various in situ and ex situ spectroscopic, morphological, diffraction and electrochemical means. Combined theoretical and experimental studies are required to comprehend the electronic structures and corresponding charge storage mechanisms for defect modulation in solid crystals through cation vacancies. To date, these studies are mostly limited to oxides and carbides (MXenes). This defect modulation approach can be extended for other metallic compounds such as nitrides, phosphides, phosphate, phosphites and chalcogenides. In many instances, surface modification of the active materials/electrodes is imperative to enhance the device performances. Thus, theoretical understanding on the surface electronic structure should be the foundation for designing the modification routes. Thereafter, the surface modification needs to be experimentally validated. Accordingly, different sophisticated techniques, such as ALD and CVD, may be employed for the surface modifications of active materials/electrodes. In case of nanosizing, core/shell structuring, morphology modulations, etc., theoretical feasibility screening should be conducted before experimental attempts. Briefly, theoretical insight regarding underline mechanisms and computational screening for envisaged materials are highly recommended prior to experimental expeditions.
(ii) The design and synthesis of different materials have to be continued in order to expand the material-bank for device optimizations. It is noteworthy that the synthesis of advanced electrode materials is not adequate for the progress of devices development. The other device components, such as the electrolyte, separator, current-collector, and cell container, are equally crucial, and thus research on these aspects are just as important for product development. Hence, material research on both the active and passive components of device should be conducted also.
(iii) Employing interdisciplinary approaches is mandatory for developing scaled-up practical devices. Materials scientists and engineers design and develop different classes of materials from the knowledge of their chemistry, which are evaluated through various electrochemical means. Electrochemists perform fundamental studies on chemical supercapacitors and generate information about the feasibility of these systems. The design of practical devices including various process regulations, such as electrolyte flow and heat management, is the responsibility of chemical engineers. Also, collaborative efforts from mechanical and electrical engineers are required for the establishments of efficient mass scale production channels. Finally, electronic engineers design the relevant power electronic circuitry (similar to the Battery-Management-System/BMS in lithium-ion batteries) of chemical supercapacitors towards intended applications.
(iv) The environmental impact of the production chain for chemical supercapacitors needs to be addressed properly. The choice of materials is crucial in this concern. Non-toxic and non-hazardous materials should get immense consideration for device development. For example, non-toxic conducting polymers and metallic compounds of Mn, Fe, V, Zn, Ti, Cu, Sn, Bi, etc. should be prioritized over the toxic metallic compounds of Ru, Ni, Co, Cr, Pb, Mo, W, In, etc., even though the latter group shows prominent supercapacitive performances. Similarly, non-hazardous aqueous electrolyte systems should be preferable over the hazardous organic media and ionic liquids, despite the sacrifice of higher energy characteristics. Recyclability is an important criterion for commercial devices, and thus product engineers should design devices with the maximum recyclability of its components.
(v) Finally, cost consideration is an important aspect for the commercialization of chemical supercapacitors. Generally, the cost component of any energy storage device primarily depends on the abundance of its contributing (major) elements in the Earth's crust and the state-of-the-art technology for production. The cost component related to the second concern may be reduced over time by technology developments, while the first concern is the actual limiting case. Therefore, researchers should focus on chemical supercapacitors that can be fabricated based on earth abundant elements. Hence, conducting polymers and metallic compounds of Mn, Fe, V, Zn, etc. should get much attention as active materials in practical devices. Moreover, low-cost electrolytes (i.e., aqueous media), low cost current collectors (i.e., Al, SS, and carbon cloth/paper), low cost separators (i.e., polymeric membranes and ceramic sheets) and other low cost passive components need to be evaluated for commercial-scale devices. Finally, engineers should consider low cost and easily operated technologies for mass scale production.
