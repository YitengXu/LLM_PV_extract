    , Accepted 2nd February 2016First published on 2nd February 2016AbstractRecent scientific advances on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are mainly focused on the improvement of power conversion efficiency. So far, how compression tunes their electronic and structural properties remains less understood. By combining in situ photocurrent, impedance spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, we have studied the electrical transport and structural properties of compressed CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) nanorods. The visible light response of MAPbI3 remains robust below 3 GPa while it is suppressed when it becomes amorphous. Pressure-induced electrical transport properties of MAPbI3 including resistance, relaxation frequency, and relative permittivity have been investigated under pressure up to 8.5 GPa by in situ impedance spectroscopy measurements. These results indicate that the discontinuous changes of these physical parameters occur around the structural phase transition pressure. The XRD studies of MAPbI3 under high pressure up to 20.9 GPa show that a phase transformation below 0.7 GPa, could be attributed to the tilting and distortion of PbI6 octahedra. And pressure-induced amorphization is reversible at a low density amorphous state but irreversible at a relatively higher density state. Furthermore, the MAPbI3 nanorods crush into nanopieces around 0.9 GPa which helps us to explain why the mixed phase of tetragonal and orthorhombic was observed at 0.5 GPa. The pressure modulated changes of electrical transport and visible light response properties open up a new approach for exploring CH3NH3PbI3-based photo-electronic applications.
Introduction
Recently, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) have attracted extensive scientific interest as light-harvesting materials for solar conversion applications owing to their direct band-gap with large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long electron–hole diffusion length and low-cost.1–5 Since the first report by Kojima et al. who used MAPbI3 as sensitizing materials in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) in 2009, with a very low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%,1 the PCE of MAPbI3-based photovoltaic devices has been improved up to ∼20%,2,3,6–10 which is comparable to those of the commercial silicon solar cells. In fact, it is the good optical absorption characteristic and better charge transport properties that render MAPbI3 as a highly efficient light harvester.5,6,11–13 Despite the rapid progress in improving the solar cell performance, the electronic and charge transport properties of MAPbI3 are still less understood, which hampers the prospects for further improvement of the conversion efficiency of MAPbI3-based electronic devices.
Pioneering studies revealed that MAPbI3 shows strong absorbance in the visible wavelength range with a direct energy band gap of around 1.5 eV,8 and its electronic structure was sensitive to external conditions, e.g. temperature, chemical component, and pressure.10,14–18 On the one hand, the electronic structure of MAPbI3, including its energy band-gap can be tuned significantly on a cooling process accompanied by the cubic–tetragonal–orthorhombic structural transitions.15,19,20 On the other hand, the band gap and absorbance spectra of perovskites can also be adjusted by changing the ratio of the halide in perovskites, i.e. MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, MAPbI3−xClx.10,17 As is well known, compression is a powerful tool to drive transformation toward the structures with higher density without inducing impurity, and hence it modulates the electronic structure of materials.21 Recently, Zhao et al. have studied the optical and structural properties of MAPbBr3 under compression, and found that the electronic structure can be tuned obviously by applying pressure.22 Moreover, the considerable effect of hydrostatic pressure and temperature on the crystal structural stability and dielectric properties was also observed in single crystal MAPbI3.14,16,18 Nevertheless, the electrical transport properties of MAPbI3 under compression are still rarely studied. More importantly, in the recent research, Hu et al.23 have fabricated photodetectors based on a MAPbI3 film which has a broad photoresponse ranging from 780 nm to 310 nm, far exceeding the performance of current photodetectors. And Zhuo et al.24 have reported that the porous MAPbBr3 nanowires exhibit superior promising optoelectronic performance. It remains unclear as to how compression tunes the visible-light response of MAPbI3, one of the important characteristics used for electronic devices. Besides, it was found that in polycrystalline semiconductor absorbers, grain boundaries can heavily affect the electrical transport properties and consequently the performance of solar cells due to the increased free carrier scattering effect at grain boundaries.25–28 However, the effect of a grain boundary on the electrical transport properties of MAPbI3 under compression is under investigation and thus poorly understood.
Activated by the above mentioned issues, we conducted high-pressure photocurrent measurements to explore the effect of compression on the visible light response of MAPbI3. The alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy measurements were used to study the pressure-induced variations on the electrical transport properties and grain boundary effects of MAPbI3, by which the contribution of bulk and grain boundaries can be distinguished clearly. In addition, in situ high-pressure XRD measurements were conducted to monitor the structural modification under compression, which is of great importance for understanding the changes of physical properties of MAPbI3. By combining these measurements, we found that the visible light response of MAPbI3 remains robust below 3 GPa while it is suppressed when it becomes amorphous. The electrical transport properties of MAPbI3 changed anomalously at ∼0.6 GPa, followed by the tetragonal to the orthorhombic structural transition.
Experiments
MAPbI3 nanorods were synthesized by a coprecipitation method using a spin coating technique, based on the procedure reported previously.29 The details of the sample synthesis and handling can be found in the ESI.† Both the sample storage and sample loading processes were carried out in an argon-filled glovebox.
A diamond anvil cell (DAC) with a culet of 400 μm in diameter was utilized to generate high pressure. The quasi-four-point-probe was located on the surface of one of the diamond anvils in our high pressure in situ photocurrent measurements which can be found in ref. 22. The AC impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed by using the plate electrodes with one Mo film electrode integrated on one diamond surface and the other on the faced diamond surface. The detailed integration process of Mo film electrodes has been reported previously.30 A T301 stainless steel was pre-indented into 60 μm in thickness, and then a hole of 250 μm in diameter was drilled at the centre of indentation by using a laser drilling machine. Then, a mixture of cubic boron nitride powder and epoxy was compressed into the indentation, as the insulating layer. Subsequently, another hole of 150 μm was drilled and served as a sample chamber. Pressure was calibrated by the R1 fluorescence peak of ruby.31 No pressure-transmitting medium was used to avoid additional error on the electrical transport measurements. The thickness of the sample under pressure was determined by using a micrometer with a precision of 0.5 μm, and the deformation of the diamond anvils was taken into account.32 Impedance spectroscopy was performed by using a Solartron 1260 impedance analyser equipped with a Solartron 1296 dielectric interface. The sine signal with an amplitude of 1 V and frequency ranging from 0.1 to 107 Hz was applied into the sample.

In situ high-pressure XRD measurements were conducted at beamline 4W2 of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and BL15U1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using an angle-dispersive XRD source (λ = 0.6199 Å). No pressure-transmitting medium was loaded in Run 1 for better comparison with electrical transport properties. Silicone oil was used as the pressure transmitting medium in Run 2. The distance between the sample and the detector, and the parameters of the detector were calibrated using a CeO2 standard. Bragg's diffraction images were integrated using Fit2d software, yielding one-dimensional intensity versus diffraction angle 2θ patterns.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained via a FEI MAGELLAN-400 microscope. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2200FS transmission electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Results and discussion
The MAPbI3 samples synthesized in our experiments crystallize into a tetragonal structure with the space group I4/mcm and lattice constants of a = 8.8743(4) Å, c = 12.6708(5) Å, agreeing well with the previously reported results.33 Shown in Fig. 1 is the SEM image of MAPbI3. The dimension of the MAPbI3 nanorods is 0.5–0.6 μm in length and 80–100 nm in diameter on average.

The photocurrent and electrical parameters are important characteristics used for application of electronic devices. We carried out photocurrent measurements on MAPbI3 to make in situ observation of the pressure effect on the visible light response. The time-dependent photocurrent was recorded when the white light (2 W cm−2) was turned on and off repeatedly. Fig. 2a and b illustrate the pressure-induced variations of photocurrent when the device was applied a constant voltage U = 5 V. It is found that the photocurrent increased sharply as the light turned on and then dropped rapidly to the original value when the light was turned off, indicating a good optoelectronic character. The photocurrent response remains robust in the low pressure region (<3 GPa). However, with further compression up to 4 GPa, the photocurrent of the sample decreased significantly and almost disappeared above 5 GPa. The specific pressure independent photocurrent values are shown in Fig. S1.†

To gain deeper insight into the effect of pressure on the electrical properties and grain boundaries of MAPbI3, we conducted in situ high-pressure AC impedance spectroscopy measurements, by which the electrical transport parameters of MAPbI3 including bulk and grain boundary resistances, relaxation frequencies, and relative permittivity can be extracted distinctly. Shown in Fig. 3a and b are the Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra of MAPbI3 with pressure up to 8.5 GPa. It is found that unlike the previously reported impedance spectroscopy observations where two semicircles describing the bulk and boundary effect can be distinguished clearly in the complex plane,34 only one semicircle describing the bulk contribution can be observed in the impedance spectroscopy results of MAPbI3. The components represented to the grain boundary and contact effect between the sample and film electrodes (several ohms) are too weaker compared with those of the bulk contribution to distinguish them clearly. That is why the bulk conduction process dominates the electrical transport behaviour of MAPbI3, which is extremely desirable for MAPbI3-based electronic devices. The recently reported photoluminescence measurements35 and theoretical research results25 also support our observations that there is very weak contribution of the grain boundary to the electrical transportation process of MAPbI3. With increasing of pressure up to 0.6 GPa, the impedance spectra comprise a single semicircle whose diameter decreases when the pressure increases. We note that, above 0.6 GPa, the semicircles tend to broaden with increasing of pressure, especially when the pressure exceeds 4.4 GPa. The pressure-dependent total resistances of MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 3c. According to the variation trends of the pressure-dependent resistances, the pressures are assigned into three regions as I, II, and III.

The pressure-dependent electrical transportation parameters of MAPbI3: (c) resistance, (d) relative permittivity, and (e) relaxation frequency. The insert in panel (d) further displays the pressure-dependent relative permittivity from ambient pressure to 2 GPa. 
In addition, from the impedance spectral data, we can gain the dielectric properties of MAPbI3 under compression. With the parallel-plate electrode model, the relative permittivity (εr) of the grains as a function of pressure can be obtained according to the following formula:εr(p) = (d/2πRfεoS)where d, S, εo, R, and f are the thickness of the samples, contact area electrodes, vacuum permittivity, and resistance relaxation frequency of grains, respectively. Fig. 3d and e show the pressure dependence of relative permittivity and relaxation frequencies of MAPbI3, respectively. Because the bulk conduction process dominates the electrical transport behaviour of MAPbI3, it is reasonable to conclude that the dielectric properties of MAPbI3 under pressure are determined by the grain's interior transport process. Under compression, it is found that different variation trends in both the pressure-dependent relative permittivity and relaxation frequencies can be observed at different pressure regions.
In fact, most anomalies of the electrical parameters usually coincide with crystal structure transition.36,37In situ high pressure XRD experiments were conducted to monitor the structural modification of MAPbI3 under compression. Run 1 is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows two-dimensional raw XRD images at five selected pressures during compression. With increasing pressure, some sharp rings become weaker along with the appearance of other new broad peaks, indicating the I–II structural transition. Above 11.5 GPa, almost all of the initial diffraction rings disappear and only two broad rings remain, which clearly signals the amorphous character of MAPbI3. Fig. 4b illustrates the integrated XRD patterns of MAPbI3 up to 20.9 GPa. Under ambient conditions, MAPbI3 crystallizes into a tetragonal structure with the I4/mcm symmetry. With gradual increasing of pressure up to 0.7 GPa, two new peaks at ∼9.0°, 10.8° emerge suddenly, followed by the disappearance of the (211) peak in phase I. During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware of an arXiv paper that was reported by Kai Wang et al.38 Compatible with their results, the patterns of phase II can be well indexed into an orthorhombic structure. The XRD pattern at 0.5 GPa means the coexistence of both the tetragonal and orthorhombic structures. Above 0.7 GPa, with continuous increasing of pressure, there is no obvious variation in the patterns of MAPbI3 except for the relative peak broadening and the collective movements of all reflection peaks toward lower d-spacing. When the applied pressure is higher than 4.2 GPa, the sample starts to be partly amorphous, which leads to anomalous electrical transportation parameter variations in region III (Fig. 3). When the applied pressure exceeds 11.5 GPa, all the diffraction peaks lose their intensity, indicating that MAPbI3 becomes amorphous. After quenching to ambient pressure, all of the reflection peaks of the tetragonal phase re-emerged (Fig. 4b), indicating that the amorphization process is reversible. However, it is found that when the sample is pressurized up to 20.9 GPa and then quenched to ambient pressure, the pattern remains invisible, showing the irreversible character. This type of structural transition is because of the tilting and distortion of PbI6 under compression. The reversible character can be attributed to that of the flexible organic cations acting as templates for the P-I frameworks according to the Raman measurement results. The irreversible character is due to the breaking and loss of P-I frameworks.

In Kai Wang et al.'s reports, the phase transformation from tetragonal to orthorhombic in bulk MAPbI3 samples is at ∼0.3 GPa. They use argon, silicone oil, and KrBr as the pressure media which provide a nearly hydrostatic condition in the sample chamber. However, in our Run 1, since no pressure medium was loaded which provides a non-hydrostatic condition in the sample chamber, this explained why a mixed phase of tetragonal and orthorhombic was observed at 0.5 GPa and the structural transition completed at ∼0.7 GPa. In Run 2, (Fig. S2†) silicone oil was used as the pressure transmitting medium, no mixed phase states could be observed during the entire phase transition process, and the structural transition also completed at ∼0.3 GPa. This means that no clear size effects were observed between our nanorods and Wang et al.'s bulk material under compression.
As is well known, even the same structural material with different surfaces and interfaces, both the size effect39 and interface effect40 can result in the different structural transition pressure and even the structural transition pathways. Thus, it is necessary to try to characterize the in situ surface and interface properties of MAPbI3 under compression. Thus far, there is no way to characterize the in situ morphology under compression because of experimental restrictions. Here, in order to reflect the surface and interface properties indirectly, HRTEM was used to obtain the images of the MAPbI3 samples after decompression from 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 GPa, respectively as shown in Fig. 5. At 0.3 GPa (Fig. 5a) and 0.6 GPa (Fig. 5b), the MAPbI3 samples still retain their nanorod character. Upon increasing the pressure up to 0.9 GPa, the nanorods can't be observed anymore, instead the samples were compressed into a compact one (Fig. 5c). In the HRTEM image of the decompressed sample as shown in Fig. 5d, some nanodomains which exhibit a short range order were observed. The average sample size changed from 0.5–0.6 μm in length and 80–100 nm in diameter to arbitrary shapes with the size of ∼10 nm at 0.9 GPa. Compared with the pressure-induced nanocrystallization pressure in some inorganic materials (12.5 GPa in ZnSnO4,40 15 GPa in Cu2O,41 and 11 GPa in Alq3.42), 0.9 GPa is very low, which means that the MAPbI3 samples belong to the class of soft materials. The deviatoric stress in the MAPbI3 sample chamber makes a non-hydrostatic condition before 0.9 GPa because of the nanorod character. Before the nanorods crush into nanopieces, the deviatoric stress is still high enough to lead to the appearance of the mixed phase of tetragonal and orthorhombic at 0.5 GPa.

It should be noticed that the resistance has a drop from ambient pressure to 0.6 GPa. Two factors are related to this drop. As nanorods were filled into the cell, a lot of gap with high resistance remained among the nanorods. With increasing pressure, the density of the gaps decreased quickly and caused a rapid decrease in resistance.41 Meanwhile, the pressure induced band gap shrink may lead to a decrease in resistance. From 0.6 to 4.4 GPa (Fig. 3c), the resistance turns to increase with increasing of pressure, because at this pressure section, the crystal adopts an orthorhombic structure, in which the PbI6 octahedra are strongly deformed assuming a rectangular basal plane. Such deformation restricts the rotational degrees of freedom of CH3NH3 in the rhombus-shaped interstitial region, thus imposing a spatial ordering to CH3NH3.43 As the pressure was increased, the interaction between the organic molecules and the inorganic framework driven by the dispersive forces enhanced. As a result, the CH3NH3 exerts strain on the PbI6 octahedra and leads to the increase of the band gap and the total electrical resistance. Below 3 GPa, the electrical resistance value changes in MAPbI3 are less than one order of magnitude (can be seen in Fig. 3c), corresponding to the photocurrents showing negligible changes under the pressure lower than 3 GPa. As can be seen from the XRD results in Fig. 4b, the sample becomes amorphous above 4.2 GPa. This may be the reason for the increases of the total resistance, relative permittivity, and the decreases of the relaxation frequency under compression above 4.4 GPa. The amorphization can also help us to understand why the photocurrent became weaker and almost disappeared at 5 GPa.
Conclusions
By high pressure in situ photocurrent, impedance spectroscopy, and XRD measurements, we have studied the electrical transport and structural properties of MAPbI3 nanorods. The experimental results reveal that the electrical transport parameters, including resistance, relaxation frequency, and relative permittivity of MAPbI3 change anomalously at ∼0.6 GPa, followed by the tetragonal to the orthorhombic structural transition, which can be attributed to the tilting and distortion of PbI6 octahedra under compression that results in the broadening of the energy band-gap. The grain boundary effect and contact effect between the sample and Mo film electrodes were found to be much weaker compared with those of the bulk contribution. From the HRTEM data of the sample after decompression, the pressure-induced nanorod crush behaviour was observed at 0.9 GPa which verifies that this material belongs to a class of soft materials. The non-hydrostatic conditions in the chamber lead to the observation of a mixed phase of tetragonal and orthorhombic at 0.5 GPa. The visible light response of MAPbI3 remains robust below 3 GPa while it is suppressed when MAPbI3 become amorphous. The pressure modulated changes of electrical transport and visible light response properties open up a new approach for exploring CH3NH3PbI3-based photo-electronic applications.
