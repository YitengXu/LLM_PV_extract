    , Accepted 11th June 2015First published on 12th June 2015AbstractA strategy was developed for the first time to fabricate highly dispersed and small-sized polyoxometalate nanoparticles loaded on a TiO2 film by using MIL-101 to prevent agglomeration, and calcination to break the metal–organic framework, which can result in performance improvement of quantum dot solar cells.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), as one unique class of molecular metal oxygen clusters, have attracted extensive interest in various fields involving optical, electrical, energy and materials science, owing to their earth-abundant source, rich topology and versatility.1–10 The intrinsic superior optoelectronic properties of POMs made them excellent active materials in photoelectrical and catalytic fields. An efficient photovoltaic system can always be constructed by exploiting certain POMs in combination with other photoelectrical materials to form a donor–acceptor structure.11–16 Besides, POMs are promising to achieve full spectrum absorption by incorporating multiple transition metal elements or reducing to heteropoly blues.17 Various POMs featuring different functions have been applied in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), indicating that POMs have great potential in photovoltaic systems. However, the large tendency of POMs to agglomerate resulted in a relatively small surface area, which hindered the accessibility to active sites and greatly limited their functional applications.18 Nanomaterials usually show superior performance far beyond the traditional materials because of their unique effects such as the quantum size effect, macroscopic quantum tunneling effect and small size effect. So it is promising to explore POM-based functionalization on the nanometer scale for a new breakthrough. Solid and liquid state reactions, self-assembly and layer-by-layer methods have been applied to prepare POM-based nanomaterials.19,20 Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to obtain stable, quantum dot-sized and highly dispersed POM nanoparticles to date.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), built from organic ligands bridging metal ions, could just provide the opportunity to achieve homogeneous distribution of POMs by the isolation effect of their high accessible porosity in MOF structures.21,22 Among them, MIL-101 reported by Férey et al.23 firstly seized our attention due to four attributes: (1) it has two kinds of mesosized cages of 2.9 and 3.4 nm with microporous windows of 1.2 and 1.5 nm, respectively, which represents an attractive host matrix for the encapsulation of POMs. As shown in Fig. 1, the mesosized cage of 2.9 nm was appropriate for the package of Keggin-type POMs because of their similar size between the window of MOF and POM anions; (2) MIL-101 begins to degrade at ∼365 °C as observed from the TG curve, thereby its framework can be completely broken after calcination at 450 °C, at which temperature, the crystalline type of TiO2 can simultaneously transform into anatase, which laid foundation for its further application in semiconductor-based devices;24 (3) moreover, the Cr-doping has been proved to be beneficial to the electron transport in photoelectrodes;25 (4) MIL-101 should be advantageous for controlled fabrication of highly dispersive and small-sized POMs, a key reason of which is that it will realize the full spectrum absorption of POM-based MOF composite materials. Unfortunately, no effort has been dedicated to the implementation of this investigation so far.

In this paper, highly dispersed and small-sized K6CoW12O40 (denoted as CoW12) nanoparticles of ∼1 nm (Fig. S1–S4†) were successfully anchored on TiO2 through the following processes: (1) immobilizing K6CoW12O40 in MIL-101 to form K6CoW12O40@MIL-101 (denoted as CoW12@MIL-101, Fig. S5†); (2) compositing CoW12@MIL-101 with TiO2; (3) calcining the composite at 450 °C to break the framework of MIL-101 and transform TiO2 into anatase, resulting in the final composite CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2. The photoelectrical properties of the composite were evaluated by introducing it into quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), which represent one of the most promising low cost next generation photovoltaic cells26–31 and suffer from lower record power conversion efficiencies (η) than DSSCs32–34 due to the large transmission loss of photo-generated electrons35,36 and the low light absorption efficiency.37,38 Their assembly process is illustrated in Fig. S6.† A significant performance enhancement was achieved by retarding the charge recombination and extending the electron lifetime after introducing CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 into TiO2 films to fabricate the photoanodes of QDSCs.
Two kinds of Keggin POMs CoW12 and Na6H2W12O40 (H2W12) were successfully immobilized in the mesoporous coordination polymer MIL-101 through a simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction, resulting in two POM–MOF composite materials: CoW12@MIL-101 and Na6H2W12O40@MIL-101 (denoted as H2W12@MIL-101). FTIR, Raman, XRD, TG curve, UV-vis spectroscopy and EDS analyses were performed to determine the combination of POMs and MIL-101. FTIR spectra in Fig. 2a represent both the vibrational bands of MIL-101 and the characteristic peaks of CoW12 and H2W12. Raman spectra in Fig. 2b display the main bands of MIL-101 as well as the typical bands of POMs, suggesting that both CoW12 and H2W12 were encapsulated in MIL-101 successfully. XRD patterns in Fig. 2c show that the positions and relative intensity of the main diffraction peaks of MIL-101 remained nearly unaffected after incorporation of POMs, proving the structural stability of MIL-101. It is worth noting that the diffraction peaks of POMs were not obvious, implying that POMs in the composite materials existed in the non-crystalline form and were distributed homogeneously within the porous structure of MIL-101.39,40 In Fig. 2d, the much lower weight loss of guest molecules in POM@MIL-101 than MIL-101 further confirmed the successful immobilization of POMs in the MOF. The spectrum absorption of CoW12@MIL-101 covered the whole of UV, visible and near infrared regions due to the combination of CoW12 with MIL-101 (Fig. 2e). Besides, EDS analysis proved the presence of W element in POM@MIL-101 in addition to Cr (Fig. S7 and S8†). Elemental analysis showed that the W contents in CoW12@MIL-101 and H2W12@MIL-101 were 25.39% and 23.64%. Besides, the mass ratios of W/Cr were 4.54 and 3.56 (Fig. S9†). Based on the elemental analysis results and molecular weight of K6CoW12O40 (3138.5 g mol−1) and Na6H2W12O40 (2985.6 g mol−1), the loading amounts (wt%) of CoW12 and H2W12 in CoW12@MIL-101 and H2W12@MIL-101 were estimated to be 36.12% and 32.05%, respectively. The nitrogen isotherms were performed to compare the porosity of MIL-101 and POMs@MIL-101. As can be concluded from Fig. S10,† MIL-101 gives a BET surface area and a pore volume of 2840 m2 g−1 and 1.41 cm3 g−1; whereas, both CoW12@MIL-101 and H2W12@MIL-101 exhibited a lower BET surface area and pore volume (Table S1†), which was attributed to the inclusion of POMs into the pores of MIL-101 to occupy the pore space. Moreover, the surface photovoltage spectroscopy was conducted to study the charge transmission process of POM@MIL-101. Fig. S11† indicates that both CoW12@MIL-101 and H2W12@MIL-101 exhibited the semiconductor-like feature with the characteristics of a p-type material.41

The schematic diagram to prepare highly dispersive and small-sized POMs loaded on TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3a–c. The as-prepared CoW12@MIL-101 via the hydrothermal process at 180 °C was first composited with TiO2 to form CoW12@MIL-101@TiO2 using a sol–gel method, which was further treated by heating to 450 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1 for 30 min in air to remove the organic frameworks, resulting in CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 finally. Besides, Cr2O3@TiO2 and CoW12@TiO2 composites were prepared for comparison through a similar process except using MIL-101 and pure CoW12 powder to replace CoW12@MIL-101. TEM, HRTEM, EDS, element mapping, ICP, XPS and XRD analyses were conducted to characterize the morphology and composition of the composites. From the TEM images (Fig. 3d), CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 exhibited the morphology of irregular aggregates consisting of nanocrystallites with a diameter of ∼10 nm. Meanwhile, Fig. 3e displays that the morphology of Cr2O3@TiO2 featured more dispersed nanoparticles. In contrast, a large amount of aggregates existed in the TEM of CoW12@TiO2 (Fig. 3f), indicating that the MOF structure can effectively retard the aggregation. The microstructure of CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 was further studied using high-magnification TEM images in detail. From Fig. 3g, the lattice spacing of 0.352 nm corresponds to the (101) crystal facet of TiO2. Moreover, the lattice spacing of 0.266 nm was assigned to the (104) crystal facet of Cr2O3.42 We can see that the main part of the composite is TiO2, on which lots of particles with a diameter of ∼1 nm were uniformly distributed. In contrast, the HRTEM images in Fig. S12a and S12b† show that these particles were absent in the pure TiO2 and Cr2O3@TiO2 powder, indicating that they came from the POM clusters. In view of the fact that the size of the particles was similar to that of the CoW12 anion and the crystal lattice was absent, the highly dispersed particles were speculated to be molecular CoW12 nanoparticles. EDS analysis (Fig. S13†) showed the existence of W and Cr elements in the composite. Elemental mapping (Fig. S14†) further revealed that all the elements including Ti, O, W and Cr were distributed homogeneously, indicating the uniform dispersion of CoW12 on TiO2. The content of CoW12 and Cr2O3 in CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 were determined using ICP measurements (Fig. S15†), which indicated that their mass fractions to TiO2 were 2.09% and 0.47%, respectively. Additionally, the mass ratio of W/Cr in CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 (4.63) was consistent with that of CoW12@MIL-101 (4.5) (Fig. S9†). The oxidation states of W and Cr were studied by XPS (Fig. S16†), demonstrating the existence of WVI and CrIII.43,44 XRD patterns (Fig. S17†) were recorded to investigate the phase structure of the composite, which proved the formation of anatase TiO2. Compared with pure TiO2, the additional peak at 33.6° for the composite CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 was attributed to the characteristic peak of Cr2O3. To validate the applicability of this strategy for other POMs, H2W12·Cr2O3@TiO2 was additionally obtained by a similar method. From the HRTEM image in Fig. S12d,† highly dispersed and small-sized H2W12 clusters on TiO2 were also achieved. The solid UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum in Fig. S18a† show that CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 displayed almost full spectrum absorption covering the whole of UV, visible and near-infrared regions, from which its optical band gap could be estimated to be 2.3 eV, which was much narrower than that of pure TiO2 (Fig. S18b†). Furthermore, the UV-vis spectra of the aqueous solution desorbed from TiO2, Cr2O3@TiO2 and CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 were recorded (Fig. S19†), showing that CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 exhibited an additional characteristic peak of CoW12 in addition to Cr2O3 and TiO2, which indicated that CoW12 clusters were dispersed in the composite. Hence, here we provide a novel strategy to anchor highly dispersive POM clusters with the size level of quantum dots on TiO2, which can provide new exciting opportunities for exploring functional applications of POMs.

Four kinds of QDSCs were assembled by fabricating different photoanodes with pure TiO2, CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2, CoW12@TiO2 and Cr2O3@TiO2-doped ones combining with CdSe. Their performances were evaluated under the simulated AM 1.5 illumination and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 4a represents the set of data that is mostly close to the average of three sets of parallel experiments (Fig. S21 and Table S2†). It is evident that the performance of QDSCs was efficiently enhanced by introducing CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2. A pure TiO2 electrode in combination with CdSe (QDSC) showed a Jsc of 16.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 473 mV, FF of 0.591 and η of 4.69%, whereas CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2-doped QDSC achieved a Jsc of 18.05 mA cm−2, Voc of 560 mV, FF of 0.593 and η of 6.00%, indicating an overall improvement of photoelectrical conversion efficiency of up to 27.9%. The increase of Jsc is related to more efficient electronic injection, transfer and collection, while the increase of Voc is due to the reduced charge recombination. More active sites of POMs are accessible owing to their small size and high dispersion, which facilitates the electronic transmission from CdSe to TiO2. Hence, more electrons would be injected and collected, leading to improvements of Jsc. The photoelectrical performance of pure CoW12 powder and MIL-101 was evaluated by introducing CoW12@TiO2 and Cr2O3@TiO2, respectively. Notably, both CoW12@TiO2 and Cr2O3@TiO2-doped QDSCs exhibited a positive effect with the increased Voc compared with bare QDSCs, which can be attributed to the retarded dark current by POMs and Cr-doping. But they gave lower conversion efficiency than CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2-doped cells. This result indicated that the highly dispersive CoW12 clusters resulted from the isolation of MIL-101 could act as an effective electron-transfer mediator in QDSCs. Thereby, it was beneficial for POMs to perform effective photoelectrical conversion by avoiding agglomeration and achieving uniform dispersion. Fig. 4b shows that CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2, CoW12@TiO2 and Cr2O3@TiO2 can all decrease the onset of dark current to different extents, and CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2-doped cells gave the smallest dark current.

The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curve (Fig. 4c) illustrates that Voc decayed slowest for CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2-doped cells whereas it decayed fastest for bare QDSCs. The electron lifetime calculated using the OCVD curve proved that CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 resulted in the longest electron lifetime (Fig. 4d).45,46 The charge transmission and recombination process was further evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The charge-transfer resistance occurring at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface (R2) showed a growth trend from bare QDSCs to Cr2O3@TiO2, to CoW12@TiO2 and CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2-doped QDSCs (Fig. 4e). The increase of R2 benefits retarding charge recombination, which would lead to smoother electron transmission across the photoanodes. This coincided with the results of photovoltaic and dark current measurements. The electron lifetime was evaluated from the low-frequency peak in the Bode plot (Fig. 4f),7,48 which demonstrated that the electron lifetime was prolonged to maximum by the treatment of CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2, further confirming the OCVD analysis.
In summary, a novel strategy was developed to fabricate highly dispersive and small-sized POM nanoparticles supported on TiO2 films. The exploitation of MOF materials as templates, which were composited with TiO2 followed by calcination to break the MOF structure, was found to be vital for acquiring uniform POM nanoparticles. In combination with the intrinsic superior optoelectronic properties of CoW12 and the novel fabrication method to ensure high dispersion, the introduction of CoW12·Cr2O3@TiO2 into QDSCs has enabled us to achieve significant performance improvement. The strategy proposed here is universal and is promising to be applied for the formation of kinds of small-sized and highly dispersive metal oxides and other versatile POMs, which can provide new exciting opportunities for POM chemistry to exert their valuable and functional applications in diverse advanced areas. Additionally, this work opens a door for the application of the huge family of MOF materials in the fields of energy and materials.
