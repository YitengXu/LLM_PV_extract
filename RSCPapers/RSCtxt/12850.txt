    , Accepted 11th December 2020First published on 14th December 2020AbstractHigh power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) surpassing 20% have been achieved on flexible single-junction perovskite solar cells recently. However, improvements of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), limited by the nonradiative recombination, and the device durability are needed to boost the practical performance further. Herein, we report the use of artemisinin, an herb extract, to passivate the perovskite grains to improve the VOC and FF of flexible PSCs significantly. The incorporation of artemisinin (0.22 mol%) in the perovskite film reduces the film's trap density and thus the nonradiative recombination effectively. As a result, a best PCE of 21.10% is achieved, comparable with state-of-art values of flexible thin-film solar cells (CIGS, CdTe, etc.). VOC reaches 1.126 V, corresponding to a VOC loss of 0.437 V. Moreover, the flexible PSCs incorporated with artemisinin always exhibit excellent stabilities under different aging conditions. Strong interactions between the artemisinin molecules and the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions revealed by theoretical and experimental calculations are responsible for the suppressed formation of new deep-level trap defects, Pb clusters, upon aging.
1. Introduction
Flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as promising next-generation photovoltaic products for the continuously increasing demands for renewable and cheaper energy, owing to their many advantages such as low-cost, less cost of installation, and large-area printing production.1–6 However, the champion PCE of flexible PSCs still lags far behind that of rigid PSCs as 25.5%.7,8 Many efforts have been devoted to using low-bandgap perovskite absorbers based on formamidinium (FA) cations to enhance the short-circuit current (JSC) and thus PCE of flexible perovskite solar cells successfully.6,7,9 Nevertheless, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) are needed to be enhanced further, which are more critical for developing high-performance flexible PSCs.10,11 Previous reports indicated that the surface and grain boundaries of polycrystal perovskite films host numerous deep-level trap defects, which are responsible for the interface recombination and nonradiative recombination, thus impairing the VOC and FF of PSCs.12–16 For flexible PSCs, the varied internal strains or deformation of the flexible substrates between different low-temperature processing steps increased the defects in perovskite absorber significantly.1,14 Thus, the VOC and FF of flexible PSCs are always lower than those of their counterparts and VOC generally drops to less than 1.1 V for low band gap PSCs.
Many strategies for passivating interfacial defects and grain boundary defects were proposed to improve the VOC, FF, and long-term stability of rigid and flexible PSCs.17–26 Based on the analysis of those studies, we concluded that the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ ions at the perovskite surface and grain boundaries are very crucial for enhancing the VOC, PCE, and durability of flexible PSCs. The uncoordinated Pb2+ ions not only act as deep-level traps but also resulted in new deep-level defects, such as antisite Pb and Pb–Pb dimers, under aging stresses, which are detrimental to device durability.27–31 Lewis base methods are proven to be valid to passivate the initial exposed Pb2+ ions, but a trade-off balance between passivating the defects and decreasing the film conductivity for high-efficiency flexible PSCs is required.13 At the most recent, two other strategies have been proposed.32–34 First, several “redox shuttles” were suggested to reduce initial defects and oxidize the aging-resulted metallic Pb0 atoms back into Pb2+ ions, which can enhance the VOC, PCE, and long-term stability of rigid PSCs significantly.32,33 Meanwhile, Wenger et al. used hydrogen peroxide to form Pb–O bonds on the grain surfaces and to prevent the formation of Pb–Pb dimers upon aging.34 However, the two strategies for rigid based PSCs are limited in reducing exposed Pb2+ ions and metallic Pb clusters within perovskite grains or at the gain surface, which cannot suppress the specie migration along grain boundaries, such as the free ions or invaded water molecules. Overall, it is a significant challenge to boost the PCE and long-term stability of flexible PSCs via the passivation of Pb-based deep level defects and the suppression of species migration along grain boundaries simultaneously.
In this work, we introduced a sesquiterpene lactone named artemisinin, well-known as an antimalaria drug, to FA-based mixed-ion perovskite films for enhancing the VOC and then the photovoltaic performance of flexible PSCs. Artemisinin, which bears a ketone group and can be extracted from one of the Chinese traditional herbs, passivated the internal defects formed at the initial crystalline stage. As a result, the best initial PCE of the corresponding flexible devices was remarkably boosted to 21.10%, benefiting from the greatly enhanced VOC and FF, which is comparable to the reported state-of-art flexible solar cells.1 In parallel, flexible PSCs with artemisinin passivants exhibited better mechanical stability and long-term stability, attributed to the restrained Pb-based defects within the device under aging stresses.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
All the chemical reagents were obtained and used without further treatment. Cesium iodide (99.9%), rubidium iodide (99.9%), and the organic solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (America). Artemisinin (Lot no. A110205) and dihydroartemisinin (Lot no. D110217) were purchased from Aladdin (America). Artesunate (Lot no. BWB50462) was obtained from Henan Putian Tongchuang Biological Tech. Co., Ltd. (China). Note that the purity is of great importance for achieving high-performance devices. The SnO2 precursor (15% in H2O) was obtained from Alfa Aesar (UK). Lead iodide (99.99%) was supplied by TCI (Japan). Spiro-OMeTAD was supplied by Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology (Shenzhen, China). PEN/ITO substrates (14 ohm square−1) and glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (10 ohm square−1) were purchased from Peccell (Japan) and Asahi Glass (Tokyo, Japan). Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were obtained from Greatcell Solar Materials (Australia). PFAI was synthesized according to a previous report.6
2.2 Device fabrication
Before the fabrication of PSCs, the substrates were sonicated in ultrapure water, ethanol, and isopropanol for 15 min in turn, and then dried using N2. The obtained substrates were then cleaned under an ultra-violet and O3 circumstance for 30 min further for the preparation of HfOx layers or SnO2 layers.
For the preparation of the HfOx layers, a low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) method was applied according to a previous report.4
For the preparation of the control SnO2 layers, as-obtained SnO2 colloidal solution was diluted to 2.14 wt% (for rigid PSCs, 3.75 wt% was applied). Then, the diluted solution was sonicated for 15 min and then filtered (0.22 μm, commercial Nylon filter, Troody, China). The resulting solution was then spin-coated on the cleaned flexible substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, which was then annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 30 min in an ambient cleaning environment. For the preparation of modified SnO2 films, different concentrations of HCl (2.5 mol%, 5.0 mol%, and 7.5 mol%, to SnO2) were added to the diluted SnO2 colloidal solution and sonicated thoroughly.
For the preparation of control perovskite films, 167.03 mg FAI, 22.28 mg MABr, 599.31 mg PbI2, 47.8 μL CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) and 46.9 μL RbI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) was dissolved in a mixed solvent with 743 μL DMF and 186 μL DMSO, which was then stirred overnight in a nitrogen glove box before use. The perovskite precursor was dropped on the SnO2 layer and then spun at 800 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 25 s successively. Chlorobenzene was dripped on the wet film at 22 s of the second program. The obtained substrate was then annealed at 120 °C for 30 min in the glovebox. A formula of Cs0.05Rb0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.90Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 was obtained on the as-prepared perovskite film. For the preparation of artemisinin-incorporated perovskite films, artemisinin powders (0.11 mol%, 0.22 mol%, and 0.33 mol%, to PbI2) were added into the precursor solution directly and stirred overnight.
For PFAI treatment, a PFAI solution in iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) (6 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the spinning perovskite film at a rate of 5000 rpm.
For the preparation of the hole transport layer, Spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg mL−1) solution in chlorobenzene with 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1, in acetonitrile), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 8 μL FK209 (180 mg mL−1, in acetonitrile) was prepared, which was then spin-coated onto the perovskite films (with/without PFAI treatment) at 2000 rpm for 30 s.
At last, 4 nm of MoOx and 100 nm of silver were thermally deposited onto the spiro-OMeTAD layer. For the stability evaluations, the silver layer was replaced by a gold layer. Moreover, to increase the incident light utilization, a piece of anti-reflecting UV cut-off film (YC-AR 130, Japan) was attached to the front surface of the device.
2.3 Characterizations and computations
The film-surface morphology images were obtained using a field-emission SEM microscope (SUPRA55 SAPPHIRE, Zeiss Sigma, Germany). The XRD patterns of the perovskite films were obtained by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima-IV, Japan). XPS measurements were carried out to evaluate the Pb content of the different perovskite films by a Quantum 2000 system (Physical Electronics, USA). The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by using a UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out on Nicolet is10 (Microlet, Japan). The perovskite films were prepared on clean silicon substrates and measured in a diamond mode.
The laser confocal fluorescence images of perovskite films were obtained on an A1R MP (Nikon, Japan) equipment, which uses an APO TIRF oil objective (100×/1.49). A 488 nm pulsed diode laser was used for the excitation. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was carried out in the dark (Keithley 2420, America) under room conditions. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) decay and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay were characterized by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980, UK).
The J–V characteristics of flexible and rigid PSCs were recorded under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 91192, America) using a Keithley 2420 source meter (Reverse scan: 1.2 to −0.1 V (forward scan: −0.1 to 1.2 V), dwell time: 10 ms, steps: 20 mV). Before the measurements, the intensity of simulated light was calibrated using a standard silicon-based solar cell (Newport Oriel, USA). The active area of solar cell was defined as 0.092 cm2 by a steel mask. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded on a QE-R-3010 system (Enlitech, Taiwan). The Nyquist plots were obtained from an electrochemical station (Chenhua, CHI 660D, China) in the dark at different bias voltages (0.75 to 1.00 V) under room conditions.
DFT calculations were conducted according to a previous report.40 The only difference in our DFT calculations is that we construct the 2 × 2 × 4 slab of FAPbI3 with a 15 Å vacuum layer for the surface calculations.
3. Results and discussion
In our study, flexible PSCs with a typical n-i-p configuration were fabricated, where n, i, and p represent the electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite layer, and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. Mixed-cation perovskite absorber having a composition of Rb0.05Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.9Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 was used in this work. For most flexible PSCs, low-temperature processing is required to fabricate charge transport layers on flexible substrates, which results in more defects within the charge transport layers inevitably. Chlorides ions are demonstrated to be beneficial for the passivation of ETLs.35 Hence, we modified our ETL by adding a small amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl) into the aqueous SnO2 solution. The photovoltaic characterization results of the flexible PSCs based on SnO2 films with different HCl concentrations are summarized in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† The addition of HCl with concentrations up to 5.0 mol% (to SnO2) resulted in improved PCEs. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is mainly due to the increased VOC and FF, thanking for the suppressed interfacial recombination shown in Fig. S2.†
Then, we incorporated artemisinin molecules into perovskite absorber to fabricate flexible PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1a. An artemisinin molecule bearing a carbonyl group can interact easily with exposed surficial Pb2+ ions via a Lewis acid-basic mechanism.12,13,36 High-purity artemisinin was added into the perovskite precursor solution directly, followed by a one-step procedure to obtain high-quality perovskite absorber. As a result, these artemisinin molecules could be located at grain boundaries and perovskite surface. To further passivate the perovskite film surface, phenylformamidinium iodide treatment was applied on its surface according to our previous report.6

(b) Dependence of the PCE of the flexible PSCs on the artemisinin doping concentration. (c) Histogram of the PCE and VOC distribution of the flexible with and without artemisinin doping. The optimized doping level of artemisinin for all devices is 0.22 mol% (to Pb). (d) J–V curves of champion PSCs based on rigid and flexible substrates with and without artemisinin doping. 
Employing the above strategies, we evaluated the photovoltaic performances of flexible PSCs incorporating different artemisinin concentrations, as shown in Fig. 1b, S3 and Table S2.† As can be seen, flexible PSCs based on the perovskite films with an artemisinin concentration of 0.22 mol% demonstrated the most improved performances, delivering a best PCE of 21.10% shown in Fig. 1c and d. A best PCE of 22.85% was also achieved on a rigid PSC. Meanwhile, the hysteresis of the best flexible PSC is negligible, as shown in Fig. S4.† One of the flexible devices was sent to a third-party test center for I–V measurements, which confirmed a PCE of 21.05% shown in Fig. S5.† Compared with the control flexible PSC, the best flexible PSC showed a greatly-enhanced VOC by an increase of 29 mV. Thus, the VOC loss could be calculated as 0.437 V, which is one of the lowest values for flexible PSCs, based on the reported bandgap of the perovskite here as 1.563 eV.7 Meanwhile, the FF are also slightly improved upon the addition of artemisinin.
The high JSC is attributed to the use of a low-bandgap of perovskite layer with an Eg of 1.563 eV. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves in Fig. S6a† showed no substantial changes with artemisinin doping, indicating that the small amount of artemisinin barely affects the bandgap of perovskites. Moreover, the calculated JSCs for the control and artemisinin-modified devices were 22.03 and 22.24 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the measured values from the J–V curves in Fig. S6b.† To note that, the high EQE value is also benefiting from the suppressed light-reflection and the stacking effect of the dielectric layers, including the charge transport layers and perovskite layer.37–39 As shown in Fig. S7a and Table S3,† the PEN/ITO transmittance increase by approx. 3%, which could be attributed to the application of the anti-reflective film on the PEN side of the flexible substrate. More importantly, we also found that the reflection of light is mainly responsible for the decreased light transmittance between 400 to 800 nm, owing to the massive difference of refractive indexes of ITO and air at the ITO/air surface of the flexible substrates, as shown in Fig. S7b–d.† However, when applying the stacking dielectric layers on the ITO surface, the reflection can be significantly suppressed, beneficial for high incident light utilization, as shown in Table S3.†
Then, two molecules with similar structures with artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin and artesunate, were applied to flexible PSCs to determine which part of artemisinin benefits the improved photovoltaic performance. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. S8,† and the photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table S4.† It can be seen that when changing the carbonyl group of artemisinin into a hydroxyl group, dihydroartemisinin would be formed, which has no passivation effect for flexible PSCs. Interestingly, when replacing the hydroxyl group of dihydroartemisinin with an ester group, artesunate would be formed, which has a good passivation effect. Hence, it can be deduced that the carbonyl group of artemisinin might play a key role during perovskite films' passivation.
Overall, artemisinin brings fantastic benefits for improved flexible PSCs, especially the enhanced VOC. Fig. 1c shows the reproducibility of the PCE and VOC of the artemisinin-incorporated flexible PSCs together with those of the control flexible PSCs. The artemisinin-based flexible PSCs demonstrated a narrower PCE distribution (20.64 to 21.10% versus 18.71 to 19.84%) along with a more restricted VOC distribution (1.111 to 1.126 V versus 1.074 to 1.104 V).
To understand the effect of artemisinin on the photovoltaic performance, we studied if artemisinin affects the perovskite crystallization first. As shown in Fig. 2a and S9,† the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the control and artemisinin-doped perovskite films are almost identical, meaning that artemisinin would not change the perovskite's crystalline phase. Besides, all the samples display a typical tetragonal perovskite-phase, along with PbI2 and RbPb(I1−xBrx)3 phases.6 Confocal PL mapping images of the control and artemisinin-doped (0.22 mol%) perovskite films are provided in Fig. 2b, which shows that the second-phase species in green are distributed randomly within the perovskite films. Fig. S10† shows that the second-phase species are PbI2 crystallites. Meanwhile, no noticeable difference can be seen between the UV-visible spectra of the control and artemisinin-doped (0.22 mol%) perovskite films in Fig. 2c. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy study was implemented to confirm the existence of artemisinin within the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2d, the peak located at 1735 cm−1 of origin artemisinin sample is attributed to the stretching vibrations of CO from the lactone groups, while it shifts to 1729 cm−1 in the artemisinin-doped perovskite film.40 It might be attributed to the interaction between uncoordinated surface Pb ions with artemisinin molecules via the CO group.36 To confirm the existence of artemisinin molecules within the perovskite film, we conducted time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurement. The results are given in Fig. S11,† which indicates that the uniform distribution of artemisinin molecules in the perovskite film profile. Considering that the size of artemisinin molecules is far larger than that of the FA cations and the unchanged XRD pattern of the artemisinin-doped perovskite film, it can be inferred that those artemisinin molecules are staying at the grain-boundaries.15,41 Though artemisinin molecules in the grain-boundaries are nonconductive, their carbonyl could effectively lower the defect densities, enhance the charge extraction, and contribute a slightly higher photon-induced current.42

For confocal PL measurements, the different perovskite films were deposited on ITO/SnO2(modified) substrates. (d) FTIR curves of the perovskite films with or without artemisinin, and origin artemisinin powders. The inset shows the curves ranging between 1705 and 1745 cm−1. (e) and (f) SEM images of the control and artemisinin-doped perovskite film (0.22 mol%). 

Fig. 2e and f show the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the control and artemisinin-doped perovskite films. The artemisinin-doped perovskite film's surface becomes smoother, and the grain size is getting more uniform, which might be attributed to the modulated crystal growth process by the carbonyl groups of artemisinin.36 However, the difference is not significant. Fig. S12 and S13† show the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films with varied concentrations of artemisinin (0 to 0.33 mol%) and their grain-sized distributions, which show similar results.
Since the change in crystalline properties or optical properties with the addition of artemisinin was not so obvious, we subsequently investigated the effect of artemisinin on the charge carrier dynamics in the PSCs to determine if the improved photovoltaic performance is a result of defect passivation.12,13,15Fig. 3a shows the photoluminescence (PL) curves of the control and artemisinin-doped perovskite films on glass substrates, where the latter shows a much slower quenching rate. We attributed this to the passivation of the perovskite film as a result of artemisinin-induced reduced traps. Moreover, the reduced trap states also cause a blue-shifted peak position from 801 to 795 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements also supported this result. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL decay for the artemisinin-doped perovskite film on a glass substrate exhibits a much slower rate than that of the control perovskite film. A bi-exponential rate law is widely used to fit the TRPL decay, by which a fast decay lifetime and a slow decay lifetime, attributed mainly to trap-assisted recombination at defects and radiative recombination in bulk, can be obtained.37,40,43,44 The fast decay lifetime and slow decay lifetime for the artemisinin-doped film and control film, were 9.40 (relative amplitude (RA): 0.10) and 196.07 (RA: 0.73) ns, and 8.09 (RA: 0.15) and 109.68 (RA: 0.60) ns, respectively. This result indicates that artemisinin can reduce non-radiative recombination by reducing the trap densities, which can generally lead to a dramatic increase in VOC.37,43

The inset shows the configuration of the devices. (d) Dependence of recombination resistance (Rre) of the flexible PSCs with the different perovskite films on the bias voltage, obtained from their EIS measurements. 
The evolution of the trap densities with or without artemisinin in the perovskite films was further studied quantitively by measuring the C–V curves of the electron-only devices in the dark. The results are given in Fig. 3c, where the trap densities can be calculated based on a space-charge limited current (SCLC) model.7,45 With the addition of artemisinin (0.22 mol%), the perovskite film's trap density is decreased from 5.77 × 1015 and 1.12 × 1015 cm−3. The SCLC results are following the TRPL results, indicating the greatly reduced defects in the perovskite film with artemisinin. The reduced trap density is beneficial for lowering charge recombination in flexible PSCs, which is proven by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on complete flexible PSCs. As shown in Fig. 3d, the charge recombination resistance (Rre) of the artemisinin-modified flexible PSC, fitted from the Nyquist plots in Fig. S14,† is always larger than its counterparts of the control flexible PSC at different bias voltages. The increased Rre is favorable for enhancing the VOC, FF, and then PCE.7,43
Thus, it can be concluded here that the outstanding photovoltaic performance of the flexible PSCs with the incorporation of artemisinin is mainly because of the well-passivated perovskite films by artemisinin and suppressed charge carrier recombination. Besides, the device stability is of great importance for the practical application of flexible PSCs. We monitored the environmental stabilities of the unencapsulated flexible PSCs kept under ambient conditions with a controlled humidity of less than 15%. As shown in Fig. 4a, it can be seen that the flexible PSC with the incorporation of artemisinin retains 93.3% of its original PCE after 600 hours. In contrast, the control flexible PSC retains 75.6% of its original PCE under the same conditions. We also inspected the thermal stability of the unencapsulated flexible PSCs with or without artemisinin. The flexible PSC with artemisinin retains 89.3% of its original PCE after be kept at 85 °C in a glovebox, while its counterpart retains 73.5% of its original PCE under the same conditions. Furthermore, we encapsulated the flexible PSCs using ultra-thin glasses with two kinds of UV-curable glues and kept them at 85 °C and 75% RH in the dark. As shown in Fig. S15,† the best flexible device with artemisinin retains 67.2% of its initial PCE after 600 hours' storage, while its counterpart retains 39.3% of its initial PCE. The rapid decline of the PCE might be mainly owing to our sealing techniques. Though the stability of encapsulated flexible devices needs to be further improved, it can be concluded that artemisinin is quite beneficial for enhancing the flexible PSCs stability.

As mechanical stability is vital for flexible solar cells, we then studied the effect of artemisinin on the device's bending stability. Previous studies indicate that the flexible substrate might play a vital role during the mechanical measurements.46,47 Thus, both the two devices using the same flexible substrates show a similar changing tendency of PCE after 2000 bending cycles at a radius of 10 mm under ambient conditions shown in Fig. 4b. However, the unencapsulated flexible device with artemisinin maintained 93.2% of its initial PCE while the control one maintained 88.7% of its initial PCE. The improved mechanical stability of the unencapsulated flexible device incorporating artemisinin could be owing to its enhanced environmental stability of the perovskite film during the automatic bending test.
So far, we confirmed the effectiveness of incorporation of artemisinin to the perovskite films to fully enhance the durability of flexible devices. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we checked the change of wettability of the perovskite film first. As seen in Fig. 4c, the water contact angle increases from 75.6° to 97.2° when artemisinin is incorporated. As discussed above, the carbonyl groups of the artemisinin molecules can interact with the uncoordinated surficial Pb2+ ions on the grain surface or film surface, which would leave the hydrophobic groups of the artemisinin molecules away from the surface. Thus, the perovskite film's water contact angle is increased, which can reduce environmental water molecules migration along the grain boundaries and then enhance the device's environmental stabilities. To further determine the interaction between the artemisinin molecule and exposed Pb2+, we estimated the binding energy of the artemisinin molecule bonded to the perovskite crystal using DFT computations. As shown in Fig. 4d, the binding energy is calculated as −42.9 kJ mole−1, which is far higher than the previously reported values of carbonyl-containing small molecules and polymer.48 Therefore, the strong interaction between artemisinin molecules and perovskite crystals ensures the effectiveness of surface passivation for flexible PSCs under different environmental conditions, such as moisture or dry heat.
Moreover, the high binding energy is beneficial for stabilizing the flexible PSCs' output under continuous light-soaking. As shown in Fig. 4e, the unencapsulated flexible PSC incorporating artemisinin exhibits highly-stable steady photocurrent under one sun illumination for 10800 seconds in an ambient room. We speculate such enhancement could be owing to the suppressed deep-level trap defects in the perovskite film during light-soaking. Previous studies indicated that the suppression of deep defect states, which are caused by antisite substitutions (PbI or IPb) or Pb–Pb dimers, can reduce nonradiative recombination in PSCs effectively and thus improve the PSC long-term stability.12,13,28–32,34 To confirm that, we monitor the change of Pb0 content within the perovskite films under continuous light-soaking because Pb0 is usually regarded as a measure of antisite Pb atoms and Pb–Pb dimers.32,34 As shown in the high-resolution XPS surveys in Fig. 4f, the fresh perovskite film with artemisinin shows a decreased Pb0 ratio (calculated by Pb0/(Pb0 + Pb2+)) as 0.9%, compared with 1.9% in the control film. The result explained the suppressed nonradiative recombination and increased VOC in Fig. 1c and 3b well, respectively. When the two perovskite films kept in an N2-filled quartz box were soaked under one sun illumination for three hours, the Pb0 ratio in the aged artemisinin-containing film was increased to 13.5%, compared with 20.0% in the aged control film, as shown in Fig. 4g. The result indicates that the suppressed Pb0, an indicator of accumulated and antisite Pb atoms, are responsible for the improved light-soaking stability of the flexible PSCs with artemisinin. We speculated that the strong interaction between the artemisinin molecule and Pb2+ ion could suppress the migration of Pb2+ or defect reactions upon light-soaking.34,49 Moreover, the formation of Pb–O between the surficial Pb2+ ion and artemisinin molecule could reduce the number of iodide Frenkel pairs and drive the surficial interstitial iodide into lattice vacancies, which might help enhance the device stability.50
4. Conclusions
In summary, we introduced an exciting molecule named artemisinin, extracted from the herb, for the fabrication of flexible PSCs with outstanding photovoltaic performances. The significant effect of artemisinin in perovskite films was proven to passivate the perovskite grains via the interaction between the carbonyl groups of artemisinin and uncoordinated Pb ions, which results in greatly-enhanced VOC of flexible PSCs. As a result, the flexible PSCs incorporating artemisinin (0.22 mol%) demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 21.10%. Furthermore, the flexible PSCs exhibited enhanced long-term stabilities under different conditions. The incorporation of artemisinin was found to improve the moisture resistance of perovskite films significantly. Theoretical calculations indicated the high binding energy between the artemisinin molecules and uncoordinated Pb ions, which can effectively suppress the formation of deep-level defect traps and thus reduce nonradiative recombination in fresh or aged flexible devices. This work presents a significant insight for improving perovskite film qualities by using carbonyl-based molecules for further achieving high-performance flexible PSCs and optoelectronic devices.
