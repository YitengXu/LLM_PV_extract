Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheets (ZnO-NS) were prepared for the photoanode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), first by directly growing layered hydroxide zinc carbonate (LHZC) on an FTO substrate using a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method and then by transforming the LHZC into ZnO through pyrolysis at 300 °C. A light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 6.06% was achieved for the DSSC with ZnO-NS as its photoanode, under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, and this (η) was found to be much higher than that of the DSSC with ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) as the photoanode (2.92%). The far superior performance of the DSSC with ZnO-NS is essentially attributed to (i) higher effective electron diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NS (3.59 × 10−3 cm2s−1) than that of ZnO-NP (1.12 × 10−3 cm2s−1), and to (ii) higher dye loading on ZnO-NS (2.66 × 10−7 mol cm−2) than that on ZnO-NP (1.99 × 10−7 mol cm−2); this higher electron diffusion coefficient and dye-loading are attributed to the specific morphology of the ZnO-NS. A further improvement in the efficiency of the DSSC with ZnO-NS could be achieved through the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of a very thin layer (3 μm) of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs of average size 14 nm) onto the ZnO-NS layer (12 μm). Notwithstanding a decrease in the effective electron diffusion coefficient (3.07 × 10−3 cm2s−1) in the TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film, with reference to that in the ZnO-NS film (3.59 × 10−3 cm2s−1), a far higher cell efficiency was obtained in favor of the cell with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS (7.07%), compared to that of the cell with bare ZnO-NS (6.06%); this enhancement in the η of the cell with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS is ascribed to an increased dye-loading in favor of its cell (3.92 × 10−7 mol cm−2), with reference to that in the case of the cell with bare ZnO-NS (2.66 × 10−7 mol cm−2). As against the common ruthenium dyes, such as N3 and N-719, a metal-free dye, coded as D149, was used in this research. The efficiency achieved for the best DSSC in this work is the highest ever reported for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material.

Broader context
In view of the dwindling supplies of conventional energy sources and extremely costly silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been a major triumph during the past decade in many laboratories throughout the world; this is also because of their high efficiency, non-toxic, biocompatible and low cost nature. DSSCs are expected to provide an answer to many environmental and energy problems. ZnO has been investigated as a promising alternative photoanode material for DSSCs since the inception of research on TiO2-based DSSCs. Unlike the crystalline structure of TiO2, the crystalline structure of ZnO is conducive to anisotropic growth, making it a prime candidate for DSSCs with photoanodes consisting of nanorods, nanowires or nanosheets (ZnO-NS). ZnO is easily available, is a low-cost material and is stable against photocorrosion. Few reports exist on the use of ZnO nanosheets (ZnO-NS) as the transparent layer. The efficiency achieved for the best DSSC in this work is the highest ever reported for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material. With a very thin layer (3 μm) of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the ZnO-NS layer (12 μm), an efficiency of 7.07% is achieved in this work.

Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are important power devices, as they are expected to provide an answer to many environmental and energy problems. ZnO has been investigated as a promising alternative photoanode material for DSSCs since the inception of research on TiO2-based DSSCs; this trend is to be attributed to the facts that TiO2 and ZnO have similar electron affinities and almost the same band gap energies, i.e., ∼3.2 eV and ∼3.3 eV, respectively, and ZnO has much higher electron diffusivity than that of TiO2.1,2 Moreover, by virtue of the diverse morphologies of ZnO, probably richer than those of metal oxides known today, several designs of photoanodes can be expected with it for DSSCs. Unlike the crystalline structure of TiO2, the crystalline structure of ZnO is conducive to anisotropic growth,3 making it a prime candidate for DSSCs with photoanodes consisting of nanorods, nanowires or nanosheets. However, the highest reported light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) was 6.58%4 for a ZnO-based DSSC; this value of η is much lower than that of a TiO2-based DSSC (11.5%).5 The limited performance of a ZnO-based DSSC could be attributed to the poor chemical stability of ZnO in acidic dye solution and to the formation of Zn2+/dye aggregates that could block the injection of electrons from the dye molecules to the semiconductor.6,7 Such aggregates are detrimental to the performance of a ZnO-based DSSC, because they fill up nanopores of the ZnO electrode and reduce the electron injection efficiency of the dye adsorbed onto the ZnO layer.
Strategies to improve the efficiency of a ZnO-based DSSC include designing new dyes that are suitable for ZnO photoelectrodes, and developing ZnO photoelectrodes with new architectures. To date, photoelectrodes based on ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NP),8,9ZnO nanowires (ZnONW),1,10ZnO nanosheets (ZnO-NS),11nanorods,12nanotubes,13 nanobelts,14 nanoflowers,15 and nanorings16 have been prepared by various techniques, such as sol–gel synthesis,9 hydrothermal/solvothermal growth,17 physical or chemical vapor deposition,18,19 low-temperature aqueous growth,20chemical bath deposition,21 and electrochemical deposition.22,23 The energy conversion efficiencies of DSSCs based on these types of photoanodes range from 0.5% to 5.6%; Yoshida et al. have reached an efficiency as high as 5.6% for a DSSC with ZnO/D149.23 The rationale for the use of different structures of ZnO lies in the fact that even in the absence of dye, the morphological variations bring about considerable changes in the photoelectrochemical properties of the respective DSSCs;23 for example, a ZnO nanosheet electrode exhibits two times higher steady-state photocurrent than the ZnO nanoparticle electrode.23 Although one-dimensional (1-D) ZnO nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes, can provide a direct conduction pathway for rapid collection of photoelectrons at the collector (substrate), the low surface area for dye adsorption limits the performance of these 1-D ZnO-based DSSCs. To make a compromise between the surface area and the electron transport rate, some novel architectures have been synthesized.15,21,23–29 Among them, the ZnO-NS prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD) seem to be attractive due to (i) their high surface area (∼80 m2 g−1), (ii) their high porosity, which is beneficial for the effective electrolyte diffusion and the release of Zn2+/dye complex,30 and (iii) their effective electron transport.24 In addition, the preparation procedure is simple as compared with the doctor-blade method.
This paper reports the fabrication of DSSCs based on three types of electrodes, one prepared with ZnO-NP, the second prepared with ZnO-NS, and the third with the same ZnO-NS coated with a thin layer (3 μm) of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS), and the comparative study of the photovoltaic performance of the three cells. ZnO-NS with an average thickness of ∼12 μm were directly grown onto the FTO substrate within 4 h by the CBD method, and TiO2-NP were subsequently filled into the interspaces in the framework of ZnO-NS by electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The method for preparing the ZnO-NS and the TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS is simpler as compared with the traditional doctor-blade method. Although there have been reports on the application of the hybrid electrodes with ZnO-NP/ZnO-NW10,21,29 or ZnO-NW/ZnO-NS28 for DSSCs, the efficiencies achieved so far were relatively low. In the present study, the DSSCs with the photoanodes consisting of ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS showed light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of 2.92, 6.06, and 7.07%, respectively. The conversion efficiency of the DSSC with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS is the highest ever reported value for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material, and is comparable to that of a TiO2 based DSSC whose value ranges from 7 to 11%, depending on the focus attached by the research groups in designing the DSSCs. The incident-photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for the DSSC based on the TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS photoanode is over 85% in the range from 400 to 650 nm, with the highest value of 96.5% at 540 nm; these IPCE values are extraordinarily high. A metal-free indoline dye, coded as D149, was used in this research, because this dye has a high molar extinction coefficient of 68700 M−1 cm−1 at 526 nm which is almost five times larger than that of the ruthenium dye N719 (13900 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm).31,32 In addition, this indoline is well-suited for ZnO based DSSCs.33 Furthermore, the metal-free dye is not only more environmentally friendly but also cheaper than the ruthenium-based dyes, especially when considered for the mass production of the DSSCs.
Experimental
Preparation of photoanodes with ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS, and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS
The ZnO-NS film was prepared by the deposition of LHZC using the CBD method, followed by a pyrolytic transformation of LHZC into ZnO-NS. For the CBD, an FTO electrode (TEC7, sheet resistance 7 Ω sq−1 obtained from LOF) was suspended upside-down in a closed bottle containing an aqueous solution of 0.15 M of zinc nitrate (100.3%, J. T. Baker) and 16.67 wt% of urea (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 90 °C for a specific time (2–6 h). After the CBD process, the resultant electrode was rinsed with DIW and dried at room temperature. Thereafter, the LHZC film formed was converted into a ZnO-NS film by annealing at 300 °C for 60 min in air. The obtained electrode is designated as ZnO-NS/FTO electrode.
For the preparation of the TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS/FTO electrode through electrophoretic deposition, a TiO2-NP (d ≈ 14 nm, P90, Degussa) suspension (6 g L−1) was first prepared by dispersing the TiO2-NP in isopropanol under vigorous agitation. The suspension was placed in an electrolytic cell. A ZnO-NS/FTO electrode was used as the cathode, and an FTO glass as the anode. The distance between the electrodes was fixed at 1 cm, and the applied voltage and polarization time were kept at 300 V and 1 min (not optimized), respectively. The obtained TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS/FTO electrode was then annealed at 300 °C.
To prepare the ZnO-NP/FTO electrode, a ZnO paste was coated onto the FTO substrate by the doctor-blade method, and this process was repeated for two more times to obtain a thickness of about 20 μm. The ZnO paste was prepared by dispersing 1.2 g ZnO-NP (d ≈ 20 nm, UniRegion Bio-Tech), 0.5 mL acetyl acetone (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.8 g poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw ≈ 20000, Sigma-Aldrich) in 20 mL DIW under vigorous agitation. The obtained ZnO-NP/FTO electrode was then annealed at 300 °C for 60 min in air.

Assembly of the DSSCs
The ZnO-based photoanodes, each with an active surface area of 0.16 cm2, were dyed by immersing them in a solution of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio = 1:1) containing 0.5 mM of D149 (Mitsubishi Paper Mills, Japan), at 80 °C for 1 h. When the time of incubation in the sensitization step was longer than 1 h, we observed a decrease in the cell efficiency, probably due to the aggregation of D149. As a result, we chose 1 h as the optimal incubation time for the sensitization step. The addition of co-adsorbate (e.g. cholic acid) in the sensitization step did not show any positive effect on the cell efficiency (data not shown), which could be attributed to inadequate dye loading. Thus, we did not add the co-adsorbate in the sensitization step. A FTO substrate sputter-coated with 25 nm of Pt was used as the counter electrode. The DSSC was fabricated by placing the Pt-coated counter electrode over the dyed ZnO-based photoanode and sealing the edges of the cell with 25 μm of surlyn hot-melt polymer film (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). An acetonitrile solution containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII, Solaronix) and 0.05 M I2 (Merck) was the electrolyte, and it was loaded into the cellvia capillary force.
Instrumentation and measurements
The light source (PEC-L11 solar simulator, AM 1.5 G) for the photochemical characterizations was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The photocurrent density (J)–photovoltage (V) curves and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained by using a PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, X'Pert, PANalytical, the Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation were used for the phase identification of the films of LHZC and ZnO-NS. The morphologies of ZnO-NS and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS films were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, USA). Further structure analysis of individual ZnO-NS, scraped from the FTO substrate, was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H-7100, Japan) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN STEM, FEI Co., the Netherlands). FTIR spectrum was obtained by using a 100 FTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer Inc., USA). The dye adsorbed on the photoanode was desorbed by immersing the photoanode in a methanol solution containing 0.1 M KOH, and its concentration was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-NIR, V670, JASCO Co., Japan); the same UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to obtain the absorption spectra of D-149-senstized LHZC films. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry analyzer (ASAP® 2010, Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA). The incident-photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSCs was measured using a monochromator (Oriel 74100). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained in the dark by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module. The frequency range explored was 10 MHz to 65 kHz. The AC amplitude used was 10 mV.
Results and discussion
Characterization of LHZC and ZnO-NS films

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared layered hydroxide zinc carbonate (LHZC) film and LHZC films calcined at 150, 300, and 450 °C for 1 h. It can be seen that all the diffraction peaks of the as-prepared LHZC film can be indexed to Zn4CO3(OH)6·H2O, referring to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction standards (JCPDS, File No. 11–287). The diffraction peak appearing at a 2θ angle of around 12.8° indicates that the LHZC film has a layered structure and a large inter-layer spacing.11 In addition, it can also be seen that the as-prepared LHZC film shows preferential orientation. The texture coefficient (TC) for the (hkl) diffraction plane was estimated as mentioned in our previous report.34 The (020) plane showed the largest TC value, which indicates that the b-axis of the LHZC is perpendicular to the substrate surface while the a- and c-axes are parallel to the substrate surface. The film calcined at 150 °C was still in its LHZC form. With the calcination of the LHZC film at 300 and 450 °C, the film was no longer a LHZC film but a wurtzite ZnO-NS film, as evidenced by the XRD patterns of the LHZC films calcined at 300 and 450 °C (Fig. 1).

            XRD patterns of as-prepared LHZC film and LHZC films calcined at 150, 300, and 450 °C for 1 h. 
The formation of LHZC and its transformation into ZnO-NS are also supported by the FTIR spectrum (Fig. S1†). As revealed in Fig. S1†, an IR adsorption due to carbonate ion was observed: (i) absorption band around 1047 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching ν1 mode, (ii) a sharp absorption band locates at 833 cm−1 is assigned to the out-of-plane deformation ν2 mode, (iii) two large absorption bands appearing at 1052 and 1385 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric stretching ν3 mode, and (iv) the absorption bands at 702 and 737 cm−1 are assigned to the ν4 mode. In addition, the presence of Zn–OH bonding can also be verified through the absorption bands appearing at 887 and 948 cm−1.35 In contrast, the absorption bands due to carbonate ion disappear for the LHZC film calcined at 300 °C. Instead, a series of absorption bands appear in the range from 1300 to 1650 cm−1; these absorption bands can be assigned to the bending modes of the O–H bond.36

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the ZnO-NS film grown for different periods. Fig. 2a and b show nanoflower structures and Fig. 2c and d show nanosheet structures. The film at 2 h and 3 h (Fig. 2a and b) shows 2D flower petals of about 10–20 nm thickness. At 4 h and 6 h (Fig. 2c and d) the substrate is covered totally and uniformly with ZnO-NS film; the average film thickness at these stages is about 12 μm. It can be noted that the film thickness has not increased with the increase of growth time from 4 to 6 h. Fig. 2a–d clearly show that the nanosheets are rather vertically accumulated on the substrate (though they tend to bend in different angles), and in all the cases the top surface of the film has a macroporous structure. In Fig. 2c and d it can be seen that the films have a good uniformity on the large scale without any crack gaps. In Fig. 2c and d the pores and sheets are distributed uniformly in a regular fashion. This kind of microstructure is expected to be beneficial for the electrolyte diffusion into the semiconductor film of a DSSC. The edge view in Fig. 2e indicates that the film is constructed by assembling nanosheets in a compact way.
 Fig. 2  (a)–(d) show top-view SEM images of ZnO-NS film grown for 2, 3, 4, and 6 h, respectively; (e) shows cross-sectional SEM image of the same film grown for 4 h. All samples were calcined at 300 °C. The scale bar represents 5 μm. 
ZnO-NS were subjected to further investigations by TEM and HRTEM. Fig. 3a shows the TEM image of a single nanosheet obtained by scratching from the bulk of the ZnO-NS. From this TEM image, it is estimated that the nanosheet is composed of NP of about 5–20 nm. The ZnO nanosheet is of crystalline quality. It can also be seen that the single sheet has lots of pores. In addition, the HRTEM image of a single ZnO-NS (Fig. 3b) exhibits clear and coherent lattice fringes running through the whole nanosheet; the HRTEM image indicates a lattice spacing of 2.59 Å; this can be ascribed to the (002) planar spacing of the ZnO-NS.

Application of the ZnO-NS in DSSCs

Fig. 4a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with the photoanodes consisting of as-prepared LHZC film and LHZC films calcined at 150, 300, and 450 °C. The photovoltaic parameters determined from these J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen in the table that the JSC of the DSSC with LHZC film calcined at 300 °C (18.01 mA cm−2) is exceptionally higher than those of the DSSCs with as-prepared LHZC film and with LHZC film calcined at 150 °C. This phenomenon can be explained considering that the film calcined at 300 °C possesses higher light-harvesting ability and/or improved electron injection efficiency as a result of transformation of LHZC (at temperatures from room temperature to 150 °C) into ZnO-NS at 300 °C. Fig. 4b shows the UV absorption spectra of D149-sensitized LHZC films obtained by calcination at different temperatures. The figure shows that the absorbance of ZnO increases with the increase of calcination temperature from 150 to 300 °C; this trend is equivalent to the increase of light harvesting efficiency with the increase of calcination temperature. The exposure time of the dye for the two cases being the same in all the cases, the increased absorption or light harvesting efficiency should be attributed to the morphological changes with increased calcination temperature. This means that the conversion from LHZC into ZnO-NS led to the increased light harvesting efficiency and thereby to the increased Jsc in favor of the DSSC with ZnO-NS. However, in the case of increase of calcination temperature from 300 to 450 °C, the light-harvesting ability shows a decrease; though it is not clear what exactly happens, it is clear that the morphological change due to the increase of temperature from 300 to 450 °C is unfavorable for light-harvesting ability of the dye; one of the possibilities is that the nanoparticles in the nanosheet become larger in this case, leading to a decrease in the surface area of the film, and thereby to a decrease in the dye adsorption. For this reason, the calcination temperature for preparing ZnO-NS was selected to be 300 °C.

In order to improve the performance of the DSSC with ZnO-NS, by increasing the surface area for dye adsorption, an additional thin layer of TiO2-NP (approx. thickness 3 μm, d ≈ 14 nm) was deposited onto the ZnO-NS film by EPD (the film is denoted TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film). VOC of the DSSC was also expected to increase due to expected resistance for the formation of the dye complex and due to high Fermi level of TiO2-NP. Fig. 5 shows the plane and cross-sectional SEM images of the TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film at different magnifications. The images in the figure show that TiO2-NP not only fill the interspaces of ZnO-NS, but also form a uniform layer with a thickness of about 3 μm. To improve the inter-connection between TiO2-NP and ZnO-NS, an additional annealing process was carried out at 300 °C. Fig. 6 shows J–V characteristics and its inset shows monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency curves for the DSSCs with the films of ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS, and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS. Due to the superior properties of ZnO-NS, i.e., effective electron transport (which will be discussed below), higher surface area (BET surface area: 52.4 vs. 17.9 m2 g−1), and effective electrolyte transport, the energy conversion efficiency (∼6.06%) of the DSSC with ZnO-NS is exceptionally better than that of the cell (2.92%) with ZnO-NP. It is now clear that the structure of the ZnO film plays a great role in the performance of the pertinent DSSC. The perpendicular structure of the ZnO-NS associated with elongated pores enables a rapid adsorption of the dye, and thereby reduces the chances of formation of Zn2+/dye aggregates. In addition, such architecture is compatible for light absorption by the dye molecules and for the diffusion of I−/I3− through the semiconductor matrix. In the absence of such elongated pores, e.g., as in the case of ZnO-NP, the Zn2+/dye aggregates can occupy the sites on the adsorbed dye molecules and thereby would block them from exposure to light; at the same time the aggregates can also hinder the diffusion of I−/I3− throughout the semiconductor. In the case of random particles of ZnO, the injected electrons diffuse through the sintered nanoparticle film, through a series of interparticle hopping steps until they reach the collector electrode. While electrons within individual particles are highly mobile, the numerous nanoparticle boundaries and dead-ends in the disordered network limit microscopic electron transport. On the other hand, the film consisting of nanosheets would allow relatively direct pathways for the transportation of electrons, as the nanosheets have a regular structure, with the sheets being perpendicular to the electrode; it can be visualized that in such a film, photoelectrons could be transported along the direction parallel to the nanosheets, i.e., precisely in the direction of the collector electrode. Thus the far superior performance of the DSSC with ZnO-NS is essentially attributed to (i) higher effective electron diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NS (3.59 × 10−3 cm2s−1) than that of ZnO-NP (1.12 × 10−3 cm2s−1), and to (ii) higher dye loading on ZnO-NS (2.66 × 10−7 mol cm−2, see Table 2) than that on ZnO-NP (1.99 × 10−7 mol cm−2, see Table 2); this higher electron diffusion coefficient and dye-loading are attributed to the specific morphology of the ZnO-NS. It is also believed that the porous nanosheets can provide light reflection and can scatter the incident light of different wavelengths in the visible range.

In addition, owing to the increase in the surface area due to the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles in the nanosheet matrix, the dye loading (3.92 × 10−7 mol cm−2) in the TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film was found to be higher than that on the ZnO-NS film (2.66 × 10−7 mol cm−2). As a result, a highly improved performance was observed in the case of the DSSC with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS hybrid film (JSC: 19.53 mA cm−2, η: 7.07%). This is the highest efficiency ever reported for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material; the calculated Jsc for this DSSC from the overlap integral of the IPCE with the standard AM 1.5 solar emission spectrum is 18.01 mA cm−2, and the mismatch factor37 of the calculated and measured photocurrent density is around 1.08. Moreover, the IPCE (inset in Fig. 6) for the DSSC based on TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS is over 85% in the range from 400 to 650 nm, with the highest value of 96.5% at 540 nm; the maximum IPCE values are 90.5% for the cell with ZnO-NS and 78.7% for the cell with ZnO-NP. The photovoltaic parameters determined from the J–V curves in Fig. 6, the amounts of dye loading, and the values of Jsc calculated by integration of the IPCE with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum for DSSCs are summarized in Table 2.
Electron transport properties in the photoanodes of ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS, and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). In accordance with a transport-recombination model,38 an equivalent circuit (Fig. 7a) is employed to fit the experimental data of impedance spectra for extracting parameters of DSSCs related to electron transport and recombination, i. e., electron transport resistance (rw) in the ZnO film, charge transfer resistance of the charge recombination between electrons in the ZnO film and I3− ions in the electrolyte (rk), and chemical capacitance of the ZnO film (cμ). These three fitted parameters could be used to determine the parameters for the evaluation of cell performance, such as the electron conductivity (σn), electron transport time (τd), electron life-time (τn), and effective diffusion coefficient (Deff). All fitted values were obtained by Z-view software. Note that the infinite elements in the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7a have been simplified to three elements. All the elements have been, however, mentioned in the caption of Fig. 7a.
 Fig. 7  (a) Equivalent circuit model of the DSSC for electrochemical impedance analysis, where Rs is the series resistance, including the sheet resistance of the FTO glass and the contact resistance of the cell, RFZ and CFZ are the resistance and the capacitance at the FTO-ZnO contact, RFTO and CFTO are the charge-transfer resistance and the corresponding double-layer capacitance at the exposed FTO-electrolyte interface, rw is the electron transport resistance in the ZnO film, rk is the charge-transfer resistance of the charge recombination between electrons in the ZnO film and I3− ions in the electrolyte, cμ is the chemical capacitance of the ZnO film, Zw is the Warburg element showing the Nernst diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte, RPt and CPt are the charge-transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance at the counter electrode (platinized TCO glass); potential dependence of (b) σn, and (c) rk for the DSSCs based on ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS, and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS photoanodes. 
First, electron conductivity (σn) values of the photoanodes with ZnO-NP, ZnO-NS, and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS were determined according to the following equation: σn = L/A × rw−1(1)where L is the film thickness and A is the project area of the photoanode exposed through the Surlyn frame. As revealed in Fig. 7b, ZnO-NS exhibit higher electron conductivity than that of ZnO-NP or TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS. This higher electron conductivity in the case of ZnO-NP can be attributed to better inter-connection between the particles of the ZnO-NS than that between the ZnO-NP; owing to the lower intrinsic conductivity of TiO2 than that of ZnO, the electron conductivity of TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS is probably little lower than that of ZnO-NS.
The value of VOC is a reflection of the charge transfer resistance, rk.13 Among the rk values of the DSSCs, the rk values of the DSSC based on TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS are the highest and those of the ZnO-NP based DSSC are the lowest (Fig. 7c). The results imply that the sequence of values of VOC in the case of different photoanodes are TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS > ZnO-NS > ZnO-NP (Table 2).
The collection efficiency can be evaluated in terms of the characteristic constants for electron transport (τd) and electron life-time (τn) (Fig. 7d). These two parameters can be determined by using the fitted values of rk, rw, and cμ, viaeqn (2 and 3):39 τd = rwcμ(2) τn = rkcμ(3)Both τd and τn of the three DSSCs follow a linear and roughly parallel trend with increasing applied potential. For the DSSCs with ZnO-NS and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS, τd is shorter than τn by about 2 orders of magnitude, at all applied potentials, i.e. rw ≪ rk at all times. Given the favourable competition between τd and τn, shown in Fig. 8, we expected that the charge collection efficiencies of ZnO-NS and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS are better than that of ZnO-NP. The charge collection efficiencies can also be evaluated in terms of the effective electron diffusion coefficients (Deff), which can be determined by using τd values and the following equation:39 Deff = L2/τd(4)As revealed in Fig. 9, the Deff values of ZnO-NS based DSSC are higher than those of both ZnO-NP and TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS based DSSCs at all applied voltages. The Deff values of DSSCs with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS, ZnO-NS, and ZnO-NP at voltages close to VOC, i.e. 0.5 V, are 3.07 × 10−3, 3.59 × 10−3, and 1.12 × 10−3 cm2s−1, respectively. The smallest Deff value of the DSSC with ZnO-NP can be attributed to weak interconnections between ZnO-NP, because these nanoparticles are expected to be arranged randomly. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5, the structure of the TiO2-NP layer deposited by EDP is loose, and the attachment between TiO2-NP and ZnO-NS is weak; this poor attachment between TiO2-NP and ZnO-NS causes a longer τd in TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS than that in ZnO-NS, leading to a smaller Deff in TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS than that in ZnO-NS. However, the effect of enhanced light-harvesting ability and increased dye loading in favor of the DSSC with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film has over-compensated the shortfall of electron life in its photoanode and rendered it with a far better overall conversion efficiency than that of the cell with ZnO-NS.

The high efficiency achieved by us for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material suggests that ZnO has very high potential to be considered as an alternative semiconducting material for a DSSC, because our achievement was brought out without optimizing the factors for improving the cell efficiency other than the microstructure of the ZnO-NS.
Conclusions
A layered hydroxide zinc carbonate (LHZC) film was obtained on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate through a chemical deposition method; this LHZC was then converted to ZnO nanosheets (ZnO-NS) through a pyrolytic transformation (XRD, FTIR). The thus obtained ZnO-NS are perpendicular to the substrate, have a macroporous structure, and are distributed uniformly on the substrate in a regular fashion (SEM). Each nanosheet is composed of nanoparticles of 5–20 nm (TEM). The TEM image of a single nanosheet indicates its crystalline quality with lots of pores. The HRTEM image of a single ZnO-NS exhibits clear and coherent lattice fringes in the sheet with a lattice spacing of 2.59 Å (002 planar spacing of the ZnO-NS). It is clearly established that the morphological features of ZnO-NS play a great role in the performance of the pertinent DSSC (UV-Vis absorption spectra of D149-sensitized LHZC films at different temperatures). The best light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of a DSSC with ZnO-NS is found to be 6.06% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is much higher than that of the DSSC with ZnO-NP (2.92%). In addition, the performance of the ZnO-NS based DSSC was further improved by depositing a thin layer of TiO2-NP (approx. 3 μm, d ≈ 14 nm) using EPD method; the DSSC with the thus obtained film of TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS showed the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 7.07%. The enhancement in the efficiency of the DSSC with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film (7.07%), with reference to that of the cell with ZnO-NS (η = 6.06%) is proved to be due to increased dye loading in TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS film, with reference to that in ZnO-NS film (IPCE, dye-loading values). Parameters related to electron transport and recombination (rw and rk) and electron life time (τe) obtained through electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) further suggest that, irrespective of their higher values in favor of the DSSC with ZnO-NS, the DSSC with TiO2-NP/ZnO-NS shows far better η than that of the cell with ZnO-NS. The best DSSC in our study shows the highest ever reported light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material.

Broader context
In view of the dwindling supplies of conventional energy sources and extremely costly silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been a major triumph during the past decade in many laboratories throughout the world; this is also because of their high efficiency, non-toxic, biocompatible and low cost nature. DSSCs are expected to provide an answer to many environmental and energy problems. ZnO has been investigated as a promising alternative photoanode material for DSSCs since the inception of research on TiO2-based DSSCs. Unlike the crystalline structure of TiO2, the crystalline structure of ZnO is conducive to anisotropic growth, making it a prime candidate for DSSCs with photoanodes consisting of nanorods, nanowires or nanosheets (ZnO-NS). ZnO is easily available, is a low-cost material and is stable against photocorrosion. Few reports exist on the use of ZnO nanosheets (ZnO-NS) as the transparent layer. The efficiency achieved for the best DSSC in this work is the highest ever reported for a DSSC with ZnO as the main semiconductor material. With a very thin layer (3 μm) of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the ZnO-NS layer (12 μm), an efficiency of 7.07% is achieved in this work.
