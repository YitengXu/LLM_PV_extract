    , Accepted 31st August 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractThree triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives, constructed by the introduction of halogen atoms in TPA, show strong mechanoluminescence emissions, partially due to their various electronic configurations by virtue of the electron withdrawing ability of halogen atoms. Careful investigation of their single crystals and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the crystal structure demonstrate that the enhanced intermolecular interactions and the twisted molecular structure contribute to their strong ML emission.
Introduction
Triphenylamine (TPA), a well-known building block, has attracted great attention due to its facile synthesis, flexible modification, excellent electron donating capability and twisted molecular structure.1–8 By introducing different functional groups in TPA, TPA derivatives have been widely utilized as hole transporting materials or light emitters in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic filed-effect transistors (OFETs), organic solar cells (OSCs), non-linear optical (NLO) materials, and so on.9–18 As reported by Li and co-workers, TPA based luminogens, as a superior host in OLED devices, exhibited an improved external quantum efficiency of 18.2%, which exceeded that of the device based 4,4′-bis(9H-carbazole-9yl)biphenyl (CBP) (15.7%), due to their distinct electronic properties and twisted configuration.19 By utilizing a TPA containing polymer as a hole-transporting material, Zhu and co-workers achieved the highest power conversion efficiencies up to 20.91% in p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (PVSCs).20
Mechanoluminescence (ML), first recorded by Francis Bacon in 1605, has received increasing attention in recent years after a long time of silence, due to its promising applications in photoelectric fields, including bio-images, pressure sensing, and display as well as lighting systems.21–24 Under mechanical stimulation, ML materials could induce light emission without UV excitation.25,26 Previously, the notorious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect of luminogens badly restricted obtaining strong ML.27,28 Fortunately, the introduction of a twisted structure with aggregation induced emission (AIE) characteristics or planar π systems with isolated groups could overcome this obstacle, leading to the rapid development of ML luminogens.29–34 And to further investigate the mechanism and configurational relationship of organic ML materials, it is needed to enrich the ML family.35 Considering the twisted molecular structure of the TPA block, TPA derivatives could also avoid the undesirable influence of the ACQ effect. Moreover, thanks to the high reaction activity of the TPA moiety, it should be convenient to modify the TPA block and develop TPA based ML materials. However, so far, the reported TPA derivatives with intense ML emission are still very scarce (Chart S1, ESI†).
As presented by our group and others, in the reported ML materials the molecular packing, largely affected by the electronic configuration, is mainly responsible for the ML performance in the solid state.29–34 And materials with tight molecular packing could favour the ML emission in the solid state, since the tight packing can restrain the molecular mechanical movement and mitigate the undesirable energy loss through non-radiative relaxation channels upon a mechanical force. Because of the intimate relationship between the molecular packing and the electronic structure, the ML performance could be significantly affected by the substituent groups, which could modulate the molecular electronic structure.28–36 Thus, three TPA derivatives were obtained by introducing three halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) to non-ML TPA-CHO (Fig. 1). Really, upon the linkage of halogen atoms, the electronic structure of TPA-CHO was changed, resulting in tight packing of the halogen-substituted TPA derivatives (TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br) accompanied by the appearance of ML emissions. Thanks to their simple structures, it is convenient to explore the structure-packing-performance relationship. Herein, we would like to present their syntheses, structural characterization, photophysical properties, ML properties, crystal structures, theoretical calculations based on their single crystals, and related discussions on the structure-packing-performance relationship.

Results and discussion
These three molecules were designed and synthesized according to the route depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). All of them were prepared by the Ullmann reaction and the subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Silica gel chromatography was used to purify the target molecules, and their chemical structures were confirmed by the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Fig. S1–S8, ESI†). DSC of those TPA-based molecules was also conducted, and TPA-CHO-2F and TPA-CHO-2Cl showed obvious exothermic peaks, indicating that TPA-CHO-2F and TPA-CHO-2Cl possess much enhanced intermolecular interactions (Fig. S9, ESI†). These TPA derivatives had excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform. UV-Vis absorption spectra of TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br were recorded in THF solution (Fig. 2a). All of them exhibited two absorption peaks (centred at 287 and 354 nm for TPA-CHO, 287 and 344 nm for TPA-CHO-2F, 305 and 353 nm for TPA-CHO-2Cl, and 308 and 353 nm for TPA-CHO-2Br), and the bands in the shorter wavelength region were associated with the π–π* transition and the bands in the longer wavelength regions were attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). In comparison with TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br, TPA-CHO-F exhibited a slightly blue-shifted absorption band (about 10 nm), possibly due to the different electron withdrawing properties of halogen atoms. The minor differences in their absorption spectra indicated the different electronic structures caused by the introduction of halogen atoms. The fluorescence emission behaviors of TPA derivatives in solution were also investigated (Fig. 2a), with the results listed in Fig. 1. TPA-CHO and TPA-CHO-2F exhibited similar emission peaks at about 470 nm in THF solution. For TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br, minor blue-shifted emission bands were observed (459 and 457 nm, respectively). All of them showed blue emissions in THF solution, partially attributed to the twisted conformation. The results demonstrated that a minor difference in their electronic structure could not substantially affect their emissions in THF solution. Moreover, the PL lifetime (τ) and the absolute fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) in THF solution (concentration = 10 μM) were also recorded (Fig. 2b and Table 1). TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2F and TPA-CHO-2Cl exhibited higher absolute fluorescence quantum yields of 28.06, 31.29 and 29.48%, and longer lifetimes of 2.87, 3.06 and 2.50 ns, respectively (Fig. 2b), while TPA-CHO-2Br presented a lower absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 8.72% and a shorter lifetime of 1.24 ns. Their photos under illumination with a 365 nm UV lamp clearly showed their different fluorescence intensities under the same conditions. We could easily find that TPA-CHO-2Br presented weaker fluorescence luminescence intensity in comparison with the other TPA derivatives, corresponding well to their different absolute fluorescence quantum yields in THF solution. Additionally, radiative (Kr) and non-radiative rates (Knr) in THF were calculated and presented in Table 1, confirming the fluorescence properties of these TPA derivatives. All of them possess similar radiative rates (0.98 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO, 1.02 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2F, 1.18 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2Cl, and 0.7 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2Br), which should be mainly attributed to the relatively high fluorescence efficiency in dilute THF solution. However, the nonradiative decay rate of TPA-CHO-2Br is 7.36 × 108 S−1, much higher than that of the other TPA derivatives (2.51 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO, 2.25 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2F, and 2.82 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2Cl). This indicated that the energy loss through nonradiative decay processes is enhanced after the introduction of bromine atoms in TPA-CHO.37

To further investigate the emission behaviors of these four TPA derivatives in the solid state, their single crystals were cultured by slow solvent evaporation of their solutions in the mixture solvents of dichloromethane and hexane, with the basic information summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). All of TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br derivatives possess twisted structures in the crystal, and the average values of the torsion angles of TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br are 72.90°, 74.53°, 63.70° and 62.68°, respectively (Fig. S10, ESI†). The one with smaller average values of the torsion angles possesses a better conjugated structure, which could explain the molecular configuration dependent emission: the variation tendency of crystal emission (460 nm for TPA-CHO-2F, 472 nm for TPA-CHO-2Cl, and 470 nm for TPA-CHO-2Br) is consistent with that of their average values of the torsion angles. In other words, the one with smaller average values of the torsion angles showed more redshifted emission in the crystal state.38 In comparison with TPA-CHO-2Cl, even though TPA-CHO-2Br possesses a smaller torsion angle, it exhibits a little blue emission. On the one hand, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br possess a similar torsion angle, and on the other hand, chlorine atoms exhibit stronger electron withdrawing properties than bromine atoms. Generally, the one with the stronger electron withdrawing acceptor shows redshifted emission. In consideration of those to two different effects, TPA-CHO-2Br showed blue-shifted emission compared to TPA-CHO-2Cl. Thanks to the twisted conformation of the TPA block, which could prevent the possible π–π stacking in the solid state, TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2F and TPA-CHO-2Cl exhibit high fluorescence efficiencies in the crystal with high absolute fluorescence quantum yields of 40.45, 56.07 and 25.24%, respectively (Table 1). The lifetimes of crystals were also measured, with the values of 2.56, 5.47 and 1.55 ns, respectively (Fig. S11 (ESI†) and Table 1). Similar to the emission behavior in solution, TPA-CHO-2Br possesses a lower fluorescence quantum yield (11.21%) and a shorter lifetime (1.22 ns) (Table 1 and Fig. S11, ESI†). Additionally, radiative (Kr) and non-radiative rates (Knr) in the crystal were calculated and presented in Table 1, confirming the fluorescence properties of these TPA derivatives. All of them possess similar radiative rates (1.58 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO, 1.03 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2F, 1.62 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2Cl, and 0.92 × 108 S−1 for TPA-CHO-2Br), which should be mainly attributed to the relatively high fluorescence efficiencies in the crystal state. Their solid emission behaviors demonstrate that their high solid emissions are beneficial for their intense ML, mainly due to their twisted structures.
When the crystalline samples of TPA-CHO-2F (CCDC 1883641), TPA-CHO-2Cl (CCDC 1883639) and TPA-CHO-2Br (CCDC 1883640) were scraped or ground at room temperature, intense blue ML emission could be discovered under daylight (Fig. 1), indicating their unique ML effects. However, there was no ML signal observed for TPA-CHO (CCDC 1883638) when its crystal was scraped or ground even in the dark. The ML spectrum of TPA-CHO-F presented only one peak at about 475 nm (Fig. 2c), which coincided with the emission spectrum of TPA-CHO-2F in THF solution. In consideration of the amorphous state of TPA-CHO-2F in THF solution, the ML excited state of TPA-CHO-2F was more likely derived from the monomer situated at the crystal surface upon crystal cracking under the mechanical stimulus. And the ML spectra of TPA-CHO-2Cl (Fig. S12b, ESI†) and TPA-CHO-2Br (Fig. S12c, ESI†) were located at about 475 and 473 nm, according to their emission in the crystal state. The different properties of those three TPA derivatives might be caused by the different molecular packings. The results demonstrated that the ML-inactive TPA-CHO was transferred to the ML-active materials after the introduction of halogen atoms. Considering the different responses to the mechanical force, the patterns of their crystals under the mechanical stimulus should be carefully investigated.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) spectra in different states were recorded to investigate the mechanochromism of these TPA-based ML luminogens (Fig. S13, ESI†).29 There were several strong diffraction peaks in the PXRD spectra of those four molecules in the crystal state, due to the ordered packing in their crystals. After grinding lightly (pressure between 0.5 and 0.7 N, 3 min), TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) also exhibited strong peaks, and interestingly, even more peaks appeared as a result of the exposure of the newly generated crystal faces during light grinding. The strong diffraction peaks indicated that TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) maintained their crystal structures and the transformation to micro-crystals under light grinding. Taking TPA-CHO-2F (Fig. 2d) as an example, the crystal TPA-CHO-2F exhibited apparent peaks at θ = 10.2 and 21.5°, indicating its good crystallinity. After grinding lightly, TPA-CHO-2F still showed sharp and intense diffraction peaks. Then upon further grinding heavily, TPA-CHO-2F also showed strong peaks, implying the high rigidity of its crystals which could maintain its crystallinity to some extent upon grinding. However, there are nearly no signals found in the PXRD spectrum of TPA-CHO after light grinding, demonstrating that the crystal structure of TPA-CHO was easily destroyed. Upon further grinding heavily (pressure between 1.7 and 1.9 N, 3 min), there were still many sharp and strong peaks in the PXRD spectra of TPA-CHO-2X (F, Cl, and Br), indicating that it was very hard to destroy their crystal structures and all of them retained their crystal structures to some extent.33 As for TPA-CHO, there were no diffraction peaks, manifesting again that its crystal structure was totally destroyed. Thus, the rigidity of the TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) crystal could efficiently suppress the possible nonradiative energy loss during the ML process.
To further study the latent reason for their different ML effects, the single crystals were thoroughly analyzed to explore the structure-packing-property relationship.38 The space groups of TPA-CHO, TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br are P2(1)/c, Pbca, Pc and Pc, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). The crystal cells of TPA-CHO and TPA-CHO-2F are centrosymmetric, while those of TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br belong to non-centrosymmetric space groups, indicating their different molecular packing models. In comparison with that of TPA-CHO, after the modification with halogen atoms in TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br, the molecular packing changed as a result of their different electronic structures. As reported in the literature and our previous papers, the rigid molecular packing in the crystal state could suppress the possible molecular slippage or collapse and restrain the non-radiative pathway under the mechanical stimuli, which is necessary for the ML properties.26,27,29 Additionally, the intermolecular interactions have significant influence on the rigidity of the crystal. Thus, intense intermolecular interactions play an important role in mechanoluminescence.
To evaluate the intermolecular interactions in the crystals, 8 molecules were selected, and only the intermolecular interactions shorter than 4.0 Å were considered. The detailed results are summarized and presented in Fig. 3 and Table S3 (ESI†). In TPA-CHO, two different dimers were observed in the crystal, which could be named as TPA-CHOa and TPA-CHOb (Fig. 3a). For TPA-CHOa, there were 6 types of C–H⋯O bonds ranging from 2.753 to 3.075 Å and 4 types of C–H⋯π bonds ranging from 3.247 to 3.553 Å (Table S4, ESI†). Similar intermolecular interactions for TPA-CHOb were also observed (Table S5, ESI†). The interactions between TPA-CHOa and TPA-CHOb are summarized and listed in Table S12 (ESI†), including 4 types of C–H⋯O bonds with the distances of 2.515 Å, and 14 types of C–H⋯π bonds with the distances ranging from 3.071 to 3.877 Å. In comparison with the intermolecular interactions between TPA-CHOa and TPA-CHOb, those in TPA-CHOa and TPA-CHOb are much weaker. Under the mechanical stimulation, the weak intermolecular interactions of TPA-CHOa and TPA-CHOb could lead to non-radiative relaxation by molecular slippage or collapse at positions with weak intermolecular interactions, resulting in ML-inactivity of TPA-CHO. When halogen atoms were introduced in TPA-CHO, intermolecular interactions were largely enhanced, due to the additional interactions between halogen and hydrogen atoms. There were also two different types of dimers in the crystals of TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Fa and TPA-CHO-2Fb. As for TPA-CHO-2Fa, there are 5 types of C–H⋯O bonds ranging from 2.462 to 3.886 Å, which are shorter than those of TPA-CHOa; 11 types of C–H⋯π ranging from 3.466 to 3.978 Å as presented in Table S6 (ESI†), which are a little longer than those of TPA-CHOa; and 16 types of C–H⋯F (2.479 to 3.804 Å). The intermolecular interactions in TPA-CHO-Fb (in Table S7, ESI†) are the same as those in TPA-CHO-Fa. By analyzing the interactions between TPA-CHO-Fa and TPA-CHO-Fb (Table S13, ESI†), 1 type of C–F⋯F–C (3.863 Å), 12 types of C–H⋯O bonds (2.915 to 3.966 Å), and 14 types of C–H⋯F bonds (2.447 to 3.675 Å) could be easily observed. Similar intermolecular interactions could be found in the crystals of TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br, with detailed results listed in Fig. 3 and Tables S8–S11, S14, S15 (ESI†). All the results demonstrated that TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) possesses much stronger intermolecular interactions rather than TPA-CHO. The intense intermolecular interactions of TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) could enhance the crystal rigidities and impede the molecular slippage under the mechanical stimulus, thus resulting in their highly efficient ML emissions.26–29

To further reveal the relationships among the molecular configuration, molecular electronic structure and ML performance, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) energy levels as well as the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the TPA derivatives were calculated, by using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Fig. 4 and Fig. S15, ESI†). For TPA-CHO, the HOMO distributed over the TPA moiety and the LUMO mainly situated in the aldehyde group and the neighboring benzene ring (Fig. 4a). As for TPA-CHO-2F, the HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole TPA (Fig. 4b), due to the electron withdrawing properties of fluorine atoms. Similar distributions of the HOMO and LUMO levels were observed in TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br (Fig. S15, ESI†). Moreover, the negative electron areas (the red color area) of TPA-CHO located on the aldehyde group in the ESP diagram (Fig. 4a). After the introduction of halogen atoms, the aldehyde group and halogen atoms both possessed abundant electrons. Additionally, the benzene ring substituted by halogen atoms showed more positive charges (Fig. 4 and Fig. S15, ESI†). Considering the negative electron areas (the red color area: aldehyde group and halogen atoms), strong interactions should occur between the negative and positive electron areas (the blue color area: the aromatic hydrogen atoms located on the TPA block). Thus, the intermolecular interactions should be enhanced by introducing halogen atoms, similar to the results of the intermolecular interactions demonstrated in their single crystals. As reported previously by our group, strong intermolecular interactions play a significant role in realizing the ML properties. TPA-CHO-2F, TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br with stronger intermolecular interactions exhibit intense ML emission.33–38 However, TPA-CHO which has weak intermolecular interactions is ML inactive. Strong intermolecular interactions could rigidify the molecules in the crystal and then restrain the nonradiative energy losses by reducing the molecular slippage under mechanical stimuli. By introducing a halogen atom, the rigidity of TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) is much-enhanced, due to the changed electronic structures, additional intermolecular interactions (such as C–H⋯X (X = F, Cl, and Br), C–F⋯F–C) and enhanced intermolecular interactions (e.g., C–H⋯π and C–H⋯O).27 When the crystals of TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) were fractured, enough excited energy was produced, due to the destruction of the strong intermolecular interactions (Fig. 5). Therefore, TPA-CHO-2X (X = F, Cl, and Br) could emit intense ML signals under mechanical stimuli.

In consideration of their twisted structure and relatively intense PL emission in the solid state, the emission behaviors before and after grinding were also investigated.35TPA-CHO shows a blue-shifted emission from 454 nm (the as-prepared state) to 442 nm (the ground state) in Fig. S12a (ESI†), which should have originated from the destruction of the crystal structure to some extent and result in more twisted conformation. As reported in the literature, intermolecular interactions and molecular packing modes have significant influence on the emission of organic crystals. After grinding, the process of decreasing the intermolecular interactions could lead to a blue-shifted emission.39a,b As shown in Fig. 3a, multiple weak intermolecular interactions, such as C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π bonds, link the adjacent molecules to form dimers in TPA-CHOa and TPA-CHOb. After grinding, the molecular packing modes are disrupted and the dimers are broken due to the loss of the weak intermolecular interactions (C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π bonds), leading to the blue-shifted emission. Similar blue-shifted emissions were observed after grinding the crystals of TPA-CHO-2Cl (Fig. S12b, ESI†) and TPA-CHO-2Br (Fig. S12c, ESI†). For TPA-CHO-2Cl and TPA-CHO-2Br, there were only 10 nm and 6 nm blue-shifted emissions after grinding. However, there is no apparent change for TPA-CHO-2F after grinding (Fig. 2c), and the as-prepared powder of TPA-2CHO-2F showed a blue emission (peak at 460 nm); however, after grinding, its emission exhibited almost no changes in the emission colour (peak at 458 nm). The insensitive response of TPA-CHO-2F is mainly due to the strong intermolecular interactions in the crystal which could effectively maintain its crystal structure after grinding. And the absolute fluorescence quantum yield and lifetimes of those TPA-based derivatives before and after grinding were also measured, without obvious changes observed. Using TPA-CHO-2F as an example, its crystal sample showed a high absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 56.07% and a short lifetime of 5.47 ns, and, after grinding, its quantum yield and lifetime values were 57.85% and 5.31 ns, respectively. Those unchanged absolute fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes might be ascribed to the twisted structure of the TPA moieties which could suppress the adverse π–π stacking and maintain their high emission in the solid state. The detailed optical properties before and after grinding are listed in Table 1.
Conclusions
In summary, three halogen-substituted TPA derivatives with intense ML emission were designed and synthesized by introducing halogen atoms in ML-inactive TPA-CHO, regardless of their similar PL emission in the solid state and analogous chemical structures. Detailed analysis of their crystal structures and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the changed molecular electronic structure, which largely affected the intermolecular interactions and molecular packing in the solid state, mainly contributed to their opposite ML effects. In other words, the introduction of halogen atoms is an efficient way to expand the ML family. Thus, a clear relationship among the molecular electronic structures, packing models in the solid state and ML effects might provide an efficient guideline for the construction of pure organic materials with intense ML emission.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
Under an argon atmosphere, toluene was dehydrated and distilled from the K–Na alloy. All the other reagents and chemicals were used as received, unless otherwise specified. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 MHz Varian Mercury spectrometer by using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded using a ZAB 3F-HF spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a RARIO EL III elemental analysis instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Absolute PL quantum yields and PL lifetimes were obtained by using a FLS980 time-resolved spectrometer. ML spectrum was determined by using a spectrometer of Acton SP2750 with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled CCD (SPEC-10, Princeton) as a power detector in the dark. D8 Advanced (Bruker) with a Cu-Kα radiation source was utilized to record the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern. A Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer was used to collect the single crystal XRD. And the crystals were cultured by slow evaporation of the solution in mixed solvents of n-hexane and DCM. The as-prepared samples were obtained by treatment of rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. All the TPA-based derivatives were prepared according to our reported literature.40
