    , Accepted 16th January 2020First published on 18th January 2020AbstractHighly conductive n-type bismuth-doped CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3:Bi) single crystals are successfully grown by the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method using bismuth iodide as the dopant source. As revealed by XRD analysis, the Bi-doped MAPbI3 single crystals maintain a perfect cubic perovskite structure (Pmm). Bi3+ ions are successfully incorporated into the MAPbI3 crystal lattice, which induces three orders of magnitude enhancement in the n-type electrical conductivity in a controllable way. Clear Urbach tails in the optical absorption spectra and continuous blue shifts in the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra are both observed after bismuth doping, which indicates the formation of bismuth induced donors and the release of more electrons to the conduction band. Temperature-dependent PL (TDPL) studies are adopted to study the optical fingerprints of bismuth induced donor defects in the MAPbI3 crystals. By analyzing the TDPL spectra in detail, it is found that the bound exciton (D0X) peak in doped MAPbI3:Bi has a stronger relative intensity and also a significant redshift in comparison with the pristine MAPbI3 crystal. This indicates that stable donor levels are formed in MAPbI3:Bi single crystals by bismuth doping. These results suggest that n-type perovskite crystals have been realized in a controlled doping way, and potential applications in bipolar perovskite-based optoelectronic devices could be realized.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, organic–inorganic halide perovskites (MAPbX3, MA = CH3NH3+; X = Cl−, Br− or I−) have attracted great attention due to their optoelectronic applications.1–7 The certified efficiency of perovskite solar cells has reached 25.2% by improving the material quality and device interface, which has been the fastest-advancing photovoltaic technology to date.8 MAPbX3 perovskites are also applicable in flat panel displays, light emitting devices, X-ray detectors and other semiconductor devices due to their superior optoelectronic properties.9–11 However, there is a lack of understanding of the basic physical properties of perovskites, such as bipolar doping and related carrier transport behavior for diode-based applications and transistor technology. These fundamental properties should be sensitive to intrinsic defects and intentional doping. Perovskite polycrystalline films are often accompanied by a large density of charge traps at the grain boundaries and surfaces. Therefore, polycrystalline films are not good candidates for semiconductor physics study. Perovskite single crystals (PSCs) have been proved to be more ideal for investigating the optoelectronic properties due to their high crystallinity, superior optical and electrical properties, and enhanced stability.7,12–15
In modern semiconductor electronic and optoelectronic devices, designed doping can tune their optical and electrical properties and is also a prerequisite for industrial applications.16 For example, silicon, indium phosphide, gallium nitride and other traditional semiconductor materials have been used to realize controlled incorporation of n-type and/or p-type dopants.17 For the realization of the expected tenability of the perovskite optoelectronic properties, the growth of n-type and p-type conductive MAPbX3 single crystals and epitaxial films is a key and necessary step. Perovskite MAPbX3 has a high defect tolerance 3D lattice structure that can tolerate heterovalent atoms distribution within the crystal lattice. Quite recently, heterovalent substitutions of Pb have been proposed to achieve improved optoelectronic properties and stability of MAPbX3.18–25 For instance, Ahmed et al. first reported that the incorporation of heterovalent Bi3+, In3+ or Au3+ into CH3NH3PbBr3 by a rapid crystallization method could lead to charge doping of MAPbBr3.26 Intercalation of small alkali ions, including lithium and sodium ions, caused a lattice expansion of the perovskite crystals. In particular, the increased possibility of Bi3+ entering the octahedral cages is due to the very similar ionic radius of Bi3+ (∼103 pm) and Pb2+ (∼119 pm). So, the partial Bi doping can favorably maintain the perovskite lattice structure but could change the pristine material properties. For instance, Bi-doping can increase the CsPbBr3 single crystal Fermi level by 0.6 eV.27 Moreover, Hu et al. reported on the incorporation of Bi3+ into CsPbI3 to stabilize the black α-phase at room temperature.28 The excessive Bi3+ can increase the internal polarization effect of perovskites, which can accelerate the charge extraction from the inner to external part of the grain and enhance the charge transport. In addition, Zhu et al. reported that such polarization in perovskites can dynamically screen the coulomb potential and protect energetic carriers, maintaining the high mobility of perovskites.29 Yamada et al. discussed the impact of chemical doping on optical responses in Bismuth-doped MA3PbBr3 single crystals in terms of carrier life time and photon recycling.19 But, currently, the fundamental optoelectronic properties of Bi related defect physics in doped perovskites remain poorly investigated, especially the optical fingerprints in the photoluminescence spectrum.
Herein, we grow Bi-doped perovskite single crystals in a controlled way and discuss the effect of doping on the conductive and optical properties of MAPbI3 perovskites. The synthesis of large-sized PSCs from a supersaturated perovskite solution with bismuth iodide (BiI3) as a dopant source is realized via an inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method. There is no change in the perovskite structure of MAPbI3 with the incorporation of Bi3+ dopants and increasing contents, which is confirmed by both phase and crystal structure characterization measurements. The impact of the Bi doping on the electrical and optical properties of MAPbI3 single crystals was investigated by the Hall effect and detailed low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into MAPbI3 single crystals could change their quasi-insulating intrinsic conductivity to highly conductive n-type. Moreover, we identify the optical fingerprints of the Bi-doping induced defect levels like donor bound excitons (D0X). As a result, heterovalent doping is an efficient way for tuning the electrical properties of MAPbX3 and understanding its basic semiconductor physics, which is useful for the development of perovskite electrical devices.
2. Results and discussion
Doping is an effective and most widely adopted method to tune the electronic structure and carrier concentration in semiconductors. In this work, a Bi atom is selected as a dopant, as it has a similar atomic radius (103 pm) to the Pb atom (119 pm), and will facilitate the incorporation of the dopant into the MAPbI3 matrix lattice. Accordingly, we construct a Bi-doping MAPbI3 model based on the cubic perovskite phase30 using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, where one Pb atom in the supercell is substituted by a Bi dopant atom, making a doping concentration of 12.5%. It is clear from the optimized structures in Fig. 1(a) and (b) that the introduction of Bi-doping does not induce important lattice distortions compared with the pure MAPbI3. To deeply understand how Bi-doping affects the electronic structure of MAPbI3, we calculate the band structure and electronic density of states of MAPbI3 with (Fig. 1c) and without Bi-doping (Fig. S2, ESI†) by the density functional theory (DFT) simulation before the experiment. As it can be seen, the localized impurity band by Bi doping is introduced around the bottom of the conduction band, leading to a sharp peak in the partial density of states (PDOS). In addition, it is clearly seen from PDOS that the doping levels originate from the hybridization of Pb, Bi, and I p states, while the main contribution comes from the Bi-p orbital, which enables Bi doping effectively to modify the band structure of MAPbI3. More strikingly, it is found from Fig. 1(c) that the Fermi level shifts upward into the conduction bands, indicating the presence of extra electrons in the doping system. This means that the Bi atom is a good n-type dopant as long as it stays at the Pb site in MAPbI3. Our calculations demonstrate that doping with a Bi atom can efficiently tune the electronic properties of MAPbI3, which is useful for the development of perovskite electrical devices.

(c) Calculated band structures and partial density of states (PDOS) for 12.5% Bi doped MAPbI3. The Fermi level is set to zero energy denoted by the red dashed line. 
To directly prove our theoretical predictions, we fabricated MAPbI3:Bi and MAPbI3 crystals and characterized their electronic and optical properties. Both the MAPbI3 crystals and the MAPbI3:Bi crystals were prepared by the ITC method, where many factors affect the perovskite crystalline quality and morphology during the crystal growth process, such as the precursor concentration, the growth temperature and the seed crystal. After systematic exploration, we selected seed crystals with a lateral size of 1–2 mm and added them into the 5 mL mother liquor with a MAI/PbI2 concentration of 1.23 mol L−1, which was maintained at a temperature of 100 °C for 48 hours. Consequently, larger (∼9–12 mm) MAPbI3 single crystals with rather smooth surfaces and regular shapes were obtained successfully, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. These crystals are all black opaque polyhedra with a regular cubic morphology. Their corresponding exposed surfaces are the (100) and (112) planes of the cubic perovskite crystal, respectively. In order to further regulate the optical and electrical properties of the intrinsic MAPbI3 semiconductor, Bi3+ was selected for heterovalent doping. Fig. 2b shows the mother liquor of different Bi3+ doped contents, and from left to right the Bi3+ doping concentration is 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 5% and 10% in turn. Clearly, their color gradually changes from bright yellow to reddish brown with increasing Bi3+ doping concentration. Fig. 2c shows a typical optical photograph of the corresponding MAPbI3 crystals grown with different doped mother liquors at 100 °C. Most of the large crystals were hexagonal diamonds with twelve faces, and some quadrangular crystals were also grown occasionally, which may be caused by different growth rates in each direction during the crystal growth process.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to study the crystal structure and crystallinity of MAPbI3 single crystals. As displayed in Fig. 3a, the diffraction peaks of these samples show a great deal of similarities, which is consistent with the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3 reported in the previous literature.26 Due to the similar ionic radius of Bi3+ (∼103 pm) and Pb2+ (∼119 pm), the crystalline interplanar spacing is hardly affected after the introduction of Bi3+ ions. Therefore, it can be speculated that Bi3+ is substituted for Pb2+ at the lattice site and enters the perovskite lattice. Fig. 3b shows the Raman spectra of the MAPbI3 crystals with different Bi3+ contents upon excitation using a 532 nm laser. Both samples exhibit characteristic peaks at 71 cm−1, 94 cm−1 and 110 cm−1, which can be ascribed to the I–Pb–I bending, Pb–I stretching and libration of the organic cations (MA+), respectively.31,32 In addition, a new characteristic peak at around 133 cm−1 can be observed with increasing Bi dopant concentration, probably due to new libration or rotation mode caused by the entry of Bi3+ into the perovskite crystal lattice.

More XPS data of the other elements are provided in the ESI.† 
To further confirm whether Bi3+ in the mother liquor could be doped into the MAPbI3 crystal effectively, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was adopted. As displayed in Table 1, the content of Bi3+ in the mother liquor and the corresponding crystal is compared by XPS quantitative analysis. It is observed that the content of Bi3+ in the MAPbI3 crystal is much lower than that in the corresponding mother liquor. Meanwhile, with the increase of the Bi3+ proportion in the mother liquor, the Bi3+ content in the single crystal increases successively. Fig. 3c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the bismuth element in the 5% Bi3+ doped sample. Two characteristic peaks were observed at 158.23 eV and 163.55 eV, corresponding to the signals of Bi3+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. Notably, the binding energy of Bi 4f was slightly smaller than the reported values,33 which may be attributed to the different chemical environments caused by the base lattice. Furthermore, the XPS characteristic peaks of Pb in different MAPbI3:Bi crystals were investigated, as shown in Fig. 3d. Two main peaks were observed in the range of 137.2–137.4 eV and 142.0–142.3 eV, which were assigned to Pb2+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 core levels. Compared with the un-doped MAPbI3 samples, the binding energy of Pb 4f in the doped crystal becomes higher as the proportion of Bi3+ increases. These results indicated that Bi3+ in the mother liquor can enter the perovskite lattice, occupying partial Pb2+ sites in the perovskite crystal structure, which causes the change of the chemical environment around Pb2+.

Hall effect measurement is an essential characterization method for semiconductor electrical property studies. A series of electrical parameters, e.g. conduction type, resistivity (ρ), carrier concentration (n), and Hall mobility (μH), can be determined by the Hall effect measurement. For purpose of testing convenience, the as-grown MAPbI3 crystals were cut and polished. The MAPbI3 crystals with a relatively regular shape were ground into thin wafers of ∼1 mm thick, and then the crystal surfaces were polished. Moreover, the 3D profilometer images and optical photographs of the MAPbI3(100) crystal plane before and after polishing are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Obviously, the average roughness of the MAPbI3 crystal surface reduced from 6.806 μm to 375.3 nm after appropriate grinding and polishing. It is worth noting that establishing an accurate ohmic contact by smoothing the crystal plane between the electrode and the semiconductor material is indispensable for Hall effect measurements. As shown in Fig. S5f (ESI†), the Au electrodes with a thickness of 80 nm were deposited onto the MAPbI3 wafer by vacuum thermal evaporation, and a current was applied between electrodes 1 and 2 to measure the voltage between electrodes 3 and 4. As shown in Fig. S5e (ESI†), the good linear relationship between the voltage and the current proves that a practicable ohmic contact between the sample and the Au electrode is established.
The resistivity and Hall effect of the MAPbI3 wafer were measured using the van der Pauw method, and the corresponding test model is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The resistivity test results are shown in Fig. 4a, where a 3 orders lower from 108 Ω cm to 105 Ω cm is realized with the increase of the Bi3+ dopant content. This confirms that Bi3+ doping significantly enhances the crystal conductivity. Additionally, Hall voltage measurements revealed that the conductivity type effectively changed from the weak p-type pristine MAPbI3 crystal to the distinct n-type doped MAPbI3:Bi crystal. Fig. 3b shows the variation of the carrier concentration and Hall mobility of MAPbI3 crystals with the Bi3+ content. The hole carrier concentration of the un-doped sample is only 109 cm−3. The majority carriers become obviously electrons after doping, and the corresponding electron concentration gradually increased to 1013 cm−3 with the increase of the Bi3+ content. For crystal semiconductors, Hall mobility is mainly related to ion impurity scattering and usually decreases when high concentrations of impurities are introduced into the semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 4b, with the increase of the Bi3+ concentration, the mobility of the sample only decreases slightly from 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, the Hall effect test proves that Bi3+ ions, as donors to provide electrons, are doped into the MAPbI3 crystal and significantly increase the carrier concentration. Therefore, a highly conductive n-type MAPbI3 crystal is grown. (More comparison data are provided in Fig. S5, ESI.†)

In order to further investigate the n-type conducting mechanism of the MAPbI3:Bi single crystals, we studied the optical spectral fingerprint characteristics of the Bi3+ donor impurity level in detail. Fig. 5a shows the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of Bi3+ doped crystal samples. The absorption edge of the MAPbI3:Bi single crystal displays a slight redshift compared to that of the un-doped sample. The absorption edge redshift agrees with a previous MAPbBr3:Bi crystal study,26,35 which was explained by bandgap narrowing due to the interaction of electrons with positive impurities.34 However, Nayak et al. recently reported that the absorption edge redshift of the MAPbI3:Bi film can be attributed to the significant increase in the sub-band-gap density of states.36 In addition to the redshift of the absorption edge, we notice that the absorption cutoff becomes flat after MAPbI3:Bi doping and is no longer as sharp as that in the pristine crystal. For thick single crystals, the absorption onset is not necessarily equal to the band gap energy and such a clear Urbach tail induced by lattice distortion is another possible reason for this red shift, as pointed out by Kanemitsu in the case of the MAPbBr3:Bi crystal.19 The appearance of the Urbach tail further indicates that Bi3+ ions enter into the MAPbI3 crystals, and localized impurity defect levels form in the bandgap.
 Fig. 5  (a) Normalized UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of MAPbI3 crystals with various Bi%. (b) Normalized steady-state PL spectrum of the pristine single crystal and Bi3+ doped MAPbI3 crystals. (c) Time resolved photoluminescence spectra of MAPbI3 crystals with various Bi%. The excitation fluence is about 0.2 nJ cm−2. The PL spectra at 10 K for (d) 0, 1%, 5% and 10% Bi3+ doped MAPbI3. All PL spectra were shifted vertically for clarity. 
To further understand the effect of Bi3+ doping on the absorption spectra of MAPbI3, we then measured the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the MAPbI3 crystals with different Bi3+ contents. Fig. 5b shows the normalized steady state PL spectra of MAPbI3 crystals with different Bi3+ contents upon excitation under a 450 nm xenon lamp. It can be seen that the position of the PL peak exhibited an obvious blue shift with an increase of the doping concentration, which is a complete contrast to the absorption spectra. This result indicates that the redshift of absorption has no relation with the bandgap narrowing. As for the blue shift in PL, combined with the Hall effect results, one possible reason is that Bi3+ doping significantly increased the carrier concentration and the edge of the conduction band is filled with electrons, that is the Burstein–Moss effect.36 This speculation is consistent with the result of the carrier concentration variation in the Hall effect test. Another very possible reason is the photon recycling effect, which is repeated photon emission, and reabsorption processes, especially for thick crystals.18,37 Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the MAPbI3 crystals were measured to further examine the Bi3+ doping effect on spectral fingerprint characteristics. The TRPL decay is fitted with a bi-exponential decay model. The fitted lifetimes are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The fitted PL lifetime is about a few microseconds, which is much longer than that of the polycrystalline MAPbI3 films. The high crystal quality and absence of grain boundaries of MAPbI3 both decrease the photocarrier charge traps. Moreover, the photon recycling effect also results in a slow PL decay, especially for the bulk crystals.37,38 In addition, we noted that the photocarrier lifetime decreased with an increase of the Bi dopant concentration. Clearly, Bi3+ doping introduced new impurity states and enhanced the photocarrier trapping.19,21 As a result, such photocarriers have a shorter diffusion length, and, the photon recycling effect is suppressed in the Bi-doped crystals, as proved by the steady-state PL spectrum.
Since the room-temperature PL cannot show more detailed PL spectral characteristics of the MAPbI3:Bi crystals, low-temperature PL spectra were further measured. Fig. 5d shows the PL spectra of doped samples with different Bi3+ proportions at 10 K. All samples were excited using a xenon lamp (450 nm) at the same power density. As can be seen from Fig. 5d, all samples have a group of PL peaks near the band edge (750–900 nm). With the increase of the Bi doping concentration, more fine peaks appear and their possible origins are donor related excitons on the low energy side. It looks like the peak shape is broad. Moreover, the donor impurity center would have a smaller binding energy with the increase of the Bi3+ doping concentration. Similar behavior has been observed in some semiconductor doping methods like sulfur displacement doping in silicon.39 In addition, a new group of low-temperature characteristic peaks were observed near 600 nm, whose intensity is lower than that of the PL peak near the band edge.
To further study the optical fingerprint characteristics of the doped crystals, we measured the temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra of the 10% Bi3+ doped MAPbI3 single crystal as an example for more detailed analysis. As shown in Fig. 6a, the temperature range is from 10 K to 300 K. The full spectrum can be divided into two optical regions, e.g. the region far away from the band-edge (500–700 nm, Region I) and the near-band-edge region (700–900 nm, Region II), which will be discussed later in detail, respectively.
 Fig. 6  (a) Temperature-dependent PL (TDPL) spectrum of 10% Bi3+ doped MAPbI3 as a function of temperature recorded from 10 K to 300 K. The TDPL spectra are marked as Region I (500–700 nm) far from the bandgap and Region II (700–900 nm) near the bandgap, respectively. (b) Detailed PL spectra in Region I. (c) The photocarrier recombination model for the emission peaks in Region I. 
The temperature-dependent PL spectrum in Region I is shown in Fig. 6b. When the temperature is below 100 K, an emission peak appears around 620 nm and its intensity gradually increases with the decrease of temperature, which is not observed in the room temperature PL spectrum. It is believed that some electrons can transit from the conduction band to the lower energy valence band and recombine with holes located at the low energy valence band as the temperature decreases. The PL peak position is also consistent with the calculated energy interval (2.10 eV) between the conduction band and the low energy valence band (red), as shown in Fig. 6c.40
As can be seen from Region II in Fig. 6a, there is only one obvious emission peak about 760 nm from 140 K to 300 K, which is named as Peak II. As the temperature decreases, new emission peaks gradually appear. From 120 K to a lower temperature, a high energy peak at about 742 nm appears, which is named as Peak I. Moreover, at the sometime, another low energy peak appears near 863 nm, which is named as Peak III and its peak intensity increases as the temperature decreases. The PL spectra at 10 K for doped MAPbI3 with different Bi3+ concentrations can all be well fitted with three Gaussian spectral lines, as shown in Fig. 7a–c. More fitted data at various temperatures are provided in the ESI.† In summary, the PL intensity and position of these three peaks exhibit different behaviors with the temperature changes.
 Fig. 7  The PL spectra at 10 K of doped MAPbI3 with different Bi3+ concentrations (a) 0%, (b) 5% and (c) 10%. The PL spectra are fitted with three Gaussian peaks: Peak I (red), II (blue) and III (green). The temperature-dependent peak position shift of the three emission bands: (d) Peak I, (e) Peak II, and (f) Peak III. 
In order to further analyze the temperature-dependent PL characteristic in the near-band-edge region (700–900 nm), we selected the 10% Bi3+ doped MAPbI3 single crystal as an example. Fig. 7d–f shows the peak position and intensity change behaviors of these three emission peaks, which were summarized from the Gaussian fitted PL spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†). The temperature-dependent spectral characteristics of these three emission peaks in the near band gap region can be summarized as follows. (1) Peak I only appears at a temperature below 120 K. With the decrease in temperature, the peak position shows a monotonous redshift and the peak intensity continuously increases. (2) At around 110 K, Peak III appears at about 863 nm with a large full width at half maximum (FWHM, ∼117 nm). With the decrease of the temperature, the FWHM becomes narrower, the PL intensity increases markedly, and the peak position shows a continuous blue shift. (3) For Peak II, the temperature dependence of the peak position is different from the other two peaks. As the temperature decreases from 300 K to 150 K, the peak position shows a redshift by 20 nm. As the temperature continuously decreases from 150 K to 110 K, its peak position exhibits a minor blueshift of 4 nm. With temperature further decreasing from 100 K to 10 K, its peak position has a redshift of 18 nm. In summary, the Peak II position exhibits an S-shaped shift (redshift–blueshift–redshift) with the temperature decrease.
Although there is still controversy about the free carrier luminescence process of MAPbI3 at room temperature, according to its temperature-dependent behavior, Peak I can be ascribed to the free exciton (FE) recombination transition at low temperature. Generally, the temperature dependent shift behavior of the free exciton (FE) peak is in agreement with the temperature-dependent change of the band gap. According to its energy position, Peak II can be ascribed to the near-band-gap free carrier recombination (FC). In Fig. 7d and e, it is observed that Peak I and Peak II show the same redshift trend in the temperature range of 10–120 K, which also further proves their physical origin. The free exciton peak energy is higher than the interband free carrier PL peak energy, which may be attributed to an exciton bound to the higher-lying defect state within the conduction band.41
More interestingly, Peak II shows an S-shaped shift with a decrease in the temperature, as shown in Fig. 7e. The redshift in 300–150 K is in agreement with the temperature-dependent absorption edge shift of MAPbI3−xClx crystals as previously reported by Petrozza et al.,42 further suggesting that Peak II is due to the free carrier recombination from the near-band-edge. Typically, the band gap of lead salt semiconductors such as PbS, PbSe, and PbTe unusually decreases with decreasing temperature. When the temperature decreases to 150 K, a crystallographic phase transition of the MAPbI3 crystal occurs, from the tetragonal phase to the orthorhombic phase. The phase transition of MAPbI3 has already been extensively studied in previous papers,43,44 and has not been focused on in this paper. When the temperature is further reduced to below 150 K, Peak II exhibits a blueshift and then redshift behavior, which has been observed in other perovskite semiconductors like CsPbBr345 and the detailed analysis is shown in the ESI.† In a word, the S-shaped shift of Peak II is the result of the competition between the lattice expansion and exciton–phonon scattering.
In order to confirm the physical origin of Peak III, we compared the fitting spectra of the doped samples with different Bi3+ concentrations at 10 K (Fig. 7a–c). It was found that Peak III exhibits a redshift and its intensity increases with the increase of the Bi3+ dopant concentration. More recently, Yamada et al. found similar new PL bands at 1.5–1.6 eV (∼800 nm) in highly doped MAPbI3 crystals and primarily assigned their origin to shallow defect states.18 Considering the Hall results, we can conclude that Peak III is derived from bound exciton (BE) recombination, and the bound center is related to Bi3+ doping induced donors, e.g. donor bound excitons (D0X). After doping, the bound center of the BE is transformed from the intrinsic defects to the donor levels provided by Bi3+. Therefore, the D0X intensity increases with the increase of the concentration of the bound centers. Also, the D0X peak exhibits a blue shift behavior with decreasing temperature, which was due to the filling of donor trap states, as previously reported in the MAPbI3 crystal.44
To further understand the bismuth doping induced donor levels, we calculated the exciton binding energy of D0X. As we all know, the relationship between temperature and PL peak intensity can be fitted using the Arrhenius equation:46,47 (1)where I0 is the emission intensity extrapolated at 0 K, kB is the Boltzmann constant, EB is the exciton binding energy, A is a fitting constant, and T represents the measurement temperature. Fig. 8a shows the relationship between the integrated FE intensity and temperature. The activation energy was calculated to be 10.2 ± 1.5 meV, which is due to the free exciton PL quenching. Using the same method, the activation energy of the D0X PL quenching was calculated to be 36.4 ± 6.3 meV as shown in Fig. 8b. This activation energy may be related to a variety of processes, such as a bound exciton (D0X) dissociates into a free exciton and an ionized donor ion or a bound exciton dissociates into a free electron/hole and a neutral donor ion.48

3. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully introduced heterovalent Bi3+ ions into the perovskite host of MAPbI3 single crystals and highly conductive n-type MAPbI3:Bi crystals are obtained using a controlled doping method. With the increase of Bi3+ concentrations, both the charge carrier concentration and conductivity are increased. It was demonstrated that three characteristic peaks are detected by low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy from the doped MAPbI3 single crystals and their temperature-dependent behaviors further confirm the physical origin, especially for bismuth doping induced donor bound excitons. This indicates that stable donor levels are formed in MAPbI3 single crystals by bismuth doping. Our results provide a new proof that heterovalent doping can tune the optical and electronic properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials, which serves as a reference for designing perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. This is especially important for exploring PN junction-based perovskite optoelectronic devices, such as traditional diodes and solar cells.
4. Experimental methods
DFT simulations
The calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) within the projector augmented wave approach49 and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)50 generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as implemented in the VASP program package.51,52 A 2 × 2 × 2 MAPbI3 supercell was adopted for Bi-doping calculations with the substitution of a Bi atom at the Pb site. Structural optimizations were performed on the pristine and Bi-doped MAPbI3 with the atomic forces allowed on each atom being less than 0.02 eV Å−1. A plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 550 eV and a k-point mesh of 5 × 5 × 5 for the supercell calculations were used to ensure that all the energy calculations are well-converged to be better than 0.01 meV.
Materials
Materials and solvents like lead iodide (98%), bismuth iodide (98%), hydroiodic acid (55.0–58.0%) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL, ≥99%) were purchased from Aladdin. Methylamine water solution (AR, 25.0–30.0%) was purchased from Sinopharm. All salts and solvents were used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of CH3NH3I
MAI was synthesized by allowing the reaction of methylamine (CH3NH2) solution with a slight excess of HI in an ice bath in an ambient atmosphere. The mixed solution was stirred in an ice bath for more than 5 h. After the complete reaction took place, the solution was transferred to a drying oven at 60 °C for evaporation of water. The crude product was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol, and anhydrous ether was added for recrystallization. After complete precipitation of a white powder, it was filtered using a vacuum filter and dried by vacuum drying at 60 °C for 0.5 hours, and a white CH3NH3I powder was obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of powder CH3NH3I are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Bi-doped CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal growth
1.23 M solution containing PbI2 and BiI3 and MAI was prepared in GBL separately. The solutions were allowed to stir overnight at 60 °C, and transparent solutions were obtained. The solutions were filtered using a PTFE filter with a 0.2 mm pore size. Single crystals were grown by adding seed crystals with a size of 1–2 mm into the solution, and then were heated to 100 °C. Within 1 day, a large crystal with lateral diameters between 8 and 10 mm was attained. The ratio of Bi% (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 5.0% and 10.0%) determined the doping concentration of Bi in the precursor solution.
Characterization
Powder XRD patterns were recorded at a scan rate of 10° min−1 using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (0.15406 nm). The XPS spectra were obtained using a Thermal Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi surface analysis system. The optical absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR, PerkinElmer) with an integration sphere attachment in the 200–2500 nm region. The Raman spectra were measured using a Horiba spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution) with an Nd:YAG laser at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Hall effect measurements were performed using a Hall measurement system (Lake Shore 8404, AC mode) with the van der Pauw protocol. The 3D profilometer image was observed using a white light interferometer (UPS-Sigma, Rtec). The photoluminescence (PL) was measured using a photoluminescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument, FLS1000) at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm with continuous light from a Xenon lamp (Edinburgh Instrument, Xe2). The samples were mounted on a continuous-flow cold finger cryostat (Janis, CCS-100/204) to control the sample temperature between 300 K and 10 K. For time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra measurements, a 450 nm diode laser was used as the excitation source.
