Typically, novel types of rechargeable batteries based on redox reactions of halogens have attracted extensive attention because of the potential fundamental chemistry and promising applications. In this frontier, we give an overview of halogen chemistry in rechargeable batteries, and the key ideas for various halogen-based batteries are discussed with particular analysis on the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the existing issues and future perspectives are also addressed for the development of halogen-based battery systems.
Introduction
Excessive burning of fossil fuels with massive emission of global warming gases has posed a serious threat to the environment. The development of wind energy, solar energy and other renewable energy sources is an important approach to eliminate the energy crisis and realize the sustainable development of human beings.1,2 It is an urgent need to develop energy storage devices with high energy density and power density to address the uneven distribution of electric energy.3 Nowadays, commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in various fields. The intercalation process has to be further optimized to enhance the energy density and power density to meet the growing energy demand. Alternatively, redox reactions of active materials are exploited to reversibly store clean energy in the novel battery systems. Therefore, advanced materials with these features have become promising candidates for powerful batteries.4,5
Halogens, also known as VIIA elements, are mainly composed of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I) and astatine (At). As fluorine and chlorine exist in the form of gas at room temperature, and astatine is a radioactive element, the complement in a battery system is quite difficult. Therefore, bromine and iodine are the main elements that can be used in energy storage systems. Actually, as an abundant source in oceans, iodine has a long and profound history as a cathode material applied in batteries.6,7 The fundamental redox reactions involving the iodine-based batteries can be described as follows: I− ↔ I3− ↔ I2.8 The formation of soluble I3− lowers the specific capacity owing to limited I2 utilization efficiency. It has been revealed that the cycling stability can be improved without the formation of I3− in aqueous zinc–iodine batteries.9,10 Similar redox reactions of Br− ↔ Br3− ↔ Br2 are observed in bromine-based batteries.11 A more positive potential is needed to oxidize Br3− to Br2 due to the large formation constant of Br3−. Additionally, polybromide anions including Br3−, Br5−, and Br7− are generated by the electrochemical–chemical (EC) mechanism in aqueous zinc–bromine batteries.12 The strong chemisorption between polybromide and N-doped graphenes is able to enhance the energy efficiency of batteries.
Bromine and iodine can provide relatively high specific capacities of 211 mA h g−1 and 310 mA h g−1, respectively.11 Moreover, in comparison with oxygen and sulphur, the redox pairs of Br3−/Br− and I3−/I− have good reversibility with redox potentials at 1.07 and 0.54 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), respectively.5 The solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interface redox reaction of I2 and Br2 can conquer the slow transport of ions and avoid the sluggish intercalation process in solid-state electrodes, leading to good battery performance. In spite of the great above-mentioned advantages, three major bottlenecks hinder the practical application of halogen-based batteries. First, the low mass loading of halogens severely limits the battery capacity.13 Second, the poor conductivity of halogens reduces the electron transfer rate and leads to slow electrochemical kinetics.6 Finally, the intermediates and active species are soluble, resulting in a shuttle effect and obvious self-discharge.14 Many efforts have been devoted to address these problems.
Recent years have witnessed the advances on the rational design of electrode materials for rechargeable batteries on the basis of the fundamental understanding of halogen chemistry. The frontier summarizes the development of halogen-based rechargeable batteries, providing a comparative view of different batteries, which would promote the development of halogen-based batteries and the deep understanding of the nature of halogen chemistry (Fig. 1).

Iodine-based battery
Rechargeable iodine-based batteries such as lithium–iodine,15 sodium–iodine,8,16 zinc–iodine,6,9,17 magnesium–iodine18 and aluminium–iodine batteries19 have drawn extensive attention owing to the high abundance and low cost of iodine and good redox reversibility.20 In comparison with these batteries, primary lithium–iodine batteries have been deeply studied and commercialized as power sources in cardiac pacemakers since 1972, in which iodine–polyvinylpyridine is used as the cathode coupled with metallic lithium in a polymer electrolyte.21 To fabricate the rechargeable lithium–iodine battery, the composite electrode of carbon powder with iodine was used in an organic electrolyte on the basis of the redox reactions of iodine.22 The battery can simultaneously achieve high energy density and power density with specific features of interface redox reaction and double-layer capacitance contribution, which conquers the sluggish kinetic process of traditional Li-ion batteries with intercalation mechanism. The calculated specific capacity is even larger than the theoretical value of 211 mA h g−1 due to the additional capacitive contributions of carbon materials. Considering the high conductivity, porous carbon with rich pore structures can meet the requirements of high mass loading and excellent rate performance.13 Hence, the iodine cathode has been fabricated via the appropriate mixing of iodine and conductive carbon black.22 The assembled lithium–iodine battery demonstrated high specific capacity and good rate performance, which could be attributed to the redox reaction of iodine and the capacitive contribution of porous carbon. The same method was also applied in lithium–bromine batteries by fixing LiBr in the nanopores of conducive carbon black for enhancing the electrochemical properties.11 Then, graphenes and carbon fibers were also proposed as highly conductive substrates for loading iodine to overcome the inherent weaknesses of low energy density and poor conductivity and the complicated preparation process of composite electrodes.9,14 For example, the thermostable iodine–carbon cathode was prepared by the “solution–adsorption” method, in which iodine was loaded in the microspores of a commercial flexible carbon cloth.23 Moreover, LiNO3 was added to the electrolyte to form a passive film on the surface of the lithium anode. The assembled soft-package battery exhibited a long-term cycling stability of more than 300 cycles and a high energy density of 136 W h kg−1. These carbon materials with abundant meso- and micropores function via physical adsorption, which is relatively weak compared with chemical adsorption.
Besides the confining effect endowed by physical adsorption and chemical adsorption, it is an efficient method with the aid of chemical interaction between halogens and cathodes for anchoring halogens and more stable than van der Waals force.24–27 The rechargeable Al–I2 battery was assembled with a PVP–I2 complex as the cathode.19 The FTIR results exhibits a broad band at 3420 cm−1, which was attributed to the hydrogen bond between iodine species and PVP.28 This strong chemical interaction successfully mitigates the shuttle effect of dissolved polyiodide and guarantees the highly reversible redox conversion reaction. Moreover, MXenes as a type of two-dimensional layered material show great potential for anchoring halogens owing to their dense surface functional terminations.29 The DFT calculations indicate high binding energies between iodine atoms and –OH functional groups, which is the major factor for superior cycling stability even at a high loading mass of 5.2 mg cm−2.
Heteroatom doping of graphitic carbon atoms could enhance the performance of oxygen reduction reactions via regulating the surface charge distribution.30–32 Our group designed flexible N, P co-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon by pyrolysis of a polyaniline-coated cellulose wiper (Fig. 2a).33 The DFT calculation revealed improved adsorption energy between iodine and heteroatom-doped graphene carbon (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the strong interactions would also increase the iodine loading by lowering the surface tensile. The assembled lithium–iodine battery exhibited a specific capacity of 368 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and a capacity retention of 84.5% after 2000 charge/discharge cycles, superior to that of active carbon. It is an effective strategy to obtain excellent iodine loading materials via N, P co-doping that not only accelerate the reaction kinetics but restrain the shuttle effect. Subsequently, a new method to synthesize N, P co-doped carbon materials was developed via in situ redox reactions of aniline monomers and manganese dioxide on the surface of carbon cloth in the presence of phytic acid.34 The dual heteroatom-doped porous carbon cloth synthesized by a self-sacrificing template method has a large specific surface area and a rich pore structure for loading iodine. Therefore, the capacity retention rate of the assembled lithium–iodine battery is still 96% after 2000 cycles. In addition, the large specific surface area also endowed the battery with strong capacitive characteristics, which still maintained a high capacity retention of 95.8% at high rate.

Then, iodine was adsorbed onto the as-prepared hierarchically porous carbon matrix co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus from an iodine-saturated solution. (b) Contour plots of the difference in charge density for the optimized structures of iodine molecule adsorbed onto graphene (I), graphene doped with N (II), P (III), isolated N and P (IV), and coupled N and P (V). The differential charge density was calculated from: Δρ = ρ12 − ρ1 − ρ2, where ρ1, ρ12 and ρ2 are the charge density of iodine, doped graphene with and without iodine adsorbed onto the surface, respectively. Yellow and green colours indicate the charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. (c) Differential charge density of the most stable configurations in the basal plane and the cross-section of (I) Li in pure graphene complexes, (II) N-doped graphene sheets, (III) N–P-doped graphene sheets, and (IV) P-doped graphene sheets. The atoms are coloured as follows: C is white, Li is green, N is navy blue, and P is light red. The differential charge density was calculated from: Δρ = ρ12 = ρ1 = ρ2, where ρ1, ρ12 and ρ2 are the charge density of lithium, and doped graphene with and without lithium adsorbed onto the surface, respectively. Light purple and green colours indicate the charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. 
As an attractive solution to regulate the electronic structure of the carbon materials, heteroatom doping with B, N, P, S and others has been used to improve the binding ability between iodine and the carbon substrates, leading to improved battery performance and suppressing the “shuttle effect” of iodine. For instance, a nitrogen-doped graphene interlayer was constructed between the iodine cathode and the separator.35 Thanks to nitrogen doping, the van der Waals force between the adsorbed I2 molecule and the substrate increases to 0.21 eV from an initial value of 0.02 eV. The interlayer was able to effectively prevent the diffusion of iodine to the anode for good reversibility. Recently, a novel zinc–iodine hybrid supercapacitor was designed by employing B, N dual-doped porous carbon tubes as cathodes that facilitated the redox reaction of iodine at the interface. Thus, a high capacity of 416.6 mA h g−1 and excellent cycling stability over 10000 cycles were achieved.36
Lithium dendrites formed on the surface of the lithium anode is another challenge for long-term cycling life and high coulombic efficiency of lithium–iodine batteries. To address this issue, our group synthesized an N, P co-doped carbon skeleton by interfacial polymerization, and then loaded lithium on its surface as the anode of lithium–iodine batteries by a melting method (Fig. 2b).37 Theoretical calculation revealed that the binding energy between lithium atoms and carbon increased from 2.73 to −5.20 eV after doping, modulating the lithiophilicity of the carbon cloth for uniform lithium plating (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the 3D porous structure formed would lower the local current density for reversible deposition and stripping of lithium. When coupled with iodine cathode, the assembled battery showed an impressive long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 99% after 4000 cycles. To our knowledge, this is the best performance for lithium–iodine batteries without a battery separator. The regulation on the surface properties of the carbon materials by heteroatom doping as well as their porous structures are able to improve the iodine loading and enhance the physical and chemical adsorption between iodine and carbon substrates, which would efficiently suppress the dissolution and the shuttle effect of iodine. Additionally, the growth of lithium dendrites was inhibited by fabricating the 3D lithium anode. Hence, the assembled lithium–iodine battery obtained excellent electrochemical performance.
Bromine-based battery
In comparison with iodine, bromine as a liquid at room temperature makes it more difficult to fabricate batteries.7 Therefore, a stronger interaction between the supporter and bromide is specifically requested for the bromine battery. To optimize the battery structure design, the positive electrode is placed at the bottom of the battery and bromine is fixed by gravity sedimentation to inhibit the shuttle effect. Notably, the liquid–liquid conversion reaction with a faster kinetic process in comparison with the intercalation process in the solid electrode of lithium-ion batteries and the solid–liquid conversion reaction of iodine-based batteries would lead to good high-rate performance. Additionally, for aqueous batteries (e.g., zinc–bromine aqueous batteries), the oxidation potential of bromine is close to that of oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). The competitive reaction would partially lower the coulombic efficiency of bromine-based batteries (usually <100%).
Among bromine-based rechargeable batteries, the zinc–bromine battery is a representative example on the basis of redox couples of Br2/Br− and Zn/Zn2+.5 Bromine has a high specific capacity of 206 A h L−1, while metal zinc possesses the highest volumetric energy density of 5885 mA h cm−3. The zinc–bromine battery can achieve high open circuit potential (1.82 V), theoretical energy (>400 W h kg−1) and power density (>100 mW cm−2).38,39 Generally, the low miscibility of bromine results in uneven concentration distribution, and bromine generated in the charging process will diffuse into the zinc anode, leading to a self-discharge phenomenon. Therefore, in order to eliminate the uneven distribution of active substances in the electrolyte solution and inhibit the shuttle effect, a circulation pump and a membrane separator are commonly used, which makes the battery structure more complexed. A minimal-architecture zinc–bromine battery with a relatively low cost of around $100 per kW h at-scale40 was fabricated using a composite cathode composed of graphite, carbon black and PVDF in an aqueous electrolyte of 2 M ZnBr2 (aq) (Fig. 3a). In the initial discharging state, the electrolyte solution is colourless and transparent (Fig. 3b). During the charging process, along with the oxidation of Br− ions, Br2 (l) is absorbed into the pores of the composited carbon foam and Zn2+ in the solution is reduced to Zn (s) on the surface of the carbon cloth. When the amount of bromine exceeds the adsorption capacity of the carbon foam, a red layer was observed at the bottom of the battery due to the formation of excess bromine (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the redox reaction rate between Zn (s) and Br2 (l) was higher than that of zinc deposition, which can effectively avoid the short circuit caused by the growth of zinc dendrites. The micropores were enabled to immobilize bromine on a carbon foam. However, a thick carbon foam would increase the transmission pathway of bromine ions, leading to a larger overpotential. For the non-flow zinc–bromine battery with nitrogen-doped microporous carbon on graphite felt as a cathode,12 the existence of polybromine was detected by Raman spectrum during the charging process. Theoretical calculation revealed that the adsorption energy between polybromine and hydrogenated pyridine-substituted graphene was higher than that of pure graphene. Thanks to the strong interactions between protonated nitrogen and Br−, the shuttle effect of bromine was obviously inhibited and more than 80% energy efficiency was obtained.

Hybrid battery
Different from iodine- and bromine-based batteries, two or more halogen ions are involved in a hybrid battery, and they participate in the energy storage reactions. Due to the equilibrium reaction with a large equilibrium constant between I2 and I−, a significant fraction of I− is complexed and not able to be involved in the redox reaction, resulting in the low utilization of iodine. Br− is used as a complexing agent to stabilize iodine in the form of I2Br−. Thus, I− ions are released to achieve an energy density of 101 W h Lposolyte+negolyte−1 (or 202 W h Lposolyte−1).41 Recently, a state-of-the-art battery based on halogen conversion–intercalation chemistry in graphite has been proposed to fabricate aqueous lithium-ion batteries.42 As displayed in Fig. 4, the cathode consists of anhydrous LiBr and LiCl with graphite in a mass ratio of 2:1:2. In the charging process, Br− ions are first oxidized into a near-zero state (Br0) and then intercalated into a graphite layer to form Cn[Br]. When further charged, Cl− ions are oxidized and combined with Cn[Br] to form the intercalated compound Cn[BrCl]. The discharge process is reversible. Therefore, the battery has two charging and discharging platforms: 4.0–4.2 V for the redox reaction of bromine and 4.2–4.5 V for the redox reaction of chlorine. The subsequent combination of redox process of Br− and Cl− with the formation of BrCl in the confined space of graphite is the key to avoid the loss of the liquid bromine and chlorine gas for good reversibility. The specific electrolyte make the redox reaction of bromine and chlorine happen at such high potentials without any obvious side reaction, thereby achieving high battery voltages and large capacity. The work opens up new avenues for stabilizing halogens via the rational design of the battery system, thereby improving the cycling stability and energy density, which could be important alternatives towards the development of advanced rechargeable batteries.

Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, various types of batteries based on halogen-based chemistry have been discussed to demonstrate the recent development as alternative energy devices (Table 1). However, several issues still exist, which severely hinder the practical application of halogen-based batteries. The first challenge is the low specific capacity of the most halogen-based batteries. Various strategies have been developed to improve the utilization of halogens for improving the energy density. It would be an efficient way to couple with the additional redox pair of halogens, such as Cl/Cl− with a theoretical capacity up to 755 mA h g−1. Additionally, the selection of suitable electrolyte is an attractive way to match the negative electrode with low redox potentials, such as Li+/Li (−3.04 V vs. SHE), aimed to improve the working voltage of a battery for improving the energy density. Moreover, the additives in an electrolyte are favourable to improve the cycling stability and rate performance of a rechargeable battery.43–45

Another challenge that need to be solved is the shuttle effect of halogens. For iodine- and bromine-based batteries, the loading on active substances with the aid of the confining effect of physical or chemical adsorption and the chemical interaction of active groups on the surface of current collector plays a certain role in inhibiting the shuttle effect of active substances but not particularly satisfactory. Due to the structural flexibility and unique surface properties, carbon-based materials as conductive substrates are commonly used to assist the reversible redox process of halogens via physical adsorption, chemical interaction as well as both. To enhance the interaction between halogens and carbon substrates, heteroatom doping is an effective method to regulate the surface charge distribution of graphitic carbon and improve the binding energy. This chemical adsorption with stronger interaction would obviously inhibit the dissolution and the shuttle effect of iodine and/or bromine.
The introduction of intercalation chemistry into halogen-based batteries is a new strategy to improve the long-term cycling stability and energy density inspired by the process of ion intercalation in a solid electrode. Combining the redox pairs of cations in the solid electrode with the halogen ions not only increase the energy density of the battery, but also endow the battery excellent rate performance through the fast halogen conversion process. Therefore, the rational incorporation of electrolyte properties and electrode materials would also efficiently modulate the redox reactions for stabilizing the halogen species to enhance electrochemical energy storage. Those provide alternative ways to develop rechargeable batteries on the basis of the halogen chemistry. Rapid advances in fabricating high-performance rechargeable batteries in terms of energy density and reversibility can be expected.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of basic halogen chemistry in various batteries and its functional mechanism.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Interfacial deposition of PANi on the cellulose wiper via oxidative polymerization in the presence of phytic acid and subsequent carbonization in a N2 atmosphere. Then, iodine was adsorbed onto the as-prepared hierarchically porous carbon matrix co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus from an iodine-saturated solution. (b) Contour plots of the difference in charge density for the optimized structures of iodine molecule adsorbed onto graphene (I), graphene doped with N (II), P (III), isolated N and P (IV), and coupled N and P (V). The differential charge density was calculated from: Δρ = ρ12 − ρ1 − ρ2, where ρ1, ρ12 and ρ2 are the charge density of iodine, doped graphene with and without iodine adsorbed onto the surface, respectively. Yellow and green colours indicate the charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. (c) Differential charge density of the most stable configurations in the basal plane and the cross-section of (I) Li in pure graphene complexes, (II) N-doped graphene sheets, (III) N–P-doped graphene sheets, and (IV) P-doped graphene sheets. The atoms are coloured as follows: C is white, Li is green, N is navy blue, and P is light red. The differential charge density was calculated from: Δρ = ρ12 = ρ1 = ρ2, where ρ1, ρ12 and ρ2 are the charge density of lithium, and doped graphene with and without lithium adsorbed onto the surface, respectively. Light purple and green colours indicate the charge depletion and accumulation, respectively.
