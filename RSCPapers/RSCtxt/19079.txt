Connectivity within donor and acceptor domains is of key importance in order to direct charge carriers efficiently to the electrodes. We report here on self-assembly pathways leading towards optimal morphology of solar cell active layers, using as the donor a hairpin-shaped molecule containing a trans-1,2-diamidocyclohexane core and two arms of diketopyrrolopyrrole conjugated segments, and a C71 fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor. Self-assembly of the donor molecule is driven by the synergistic action of hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking, and under proper conditions this results in the formation of long supramolecular nanowires that enhance charge transport and device efficiencies. We found that a stepwise cooling process with minimal stirring of solutions is necessary to create by self-assembly robust wires that are not disrupted when acceptor molecules are added. The efficiencies of devices created by this process can be 400-fold greater than those of devices formed by simple mixing of donor and acceptor molecules. The synergistic action of hydrogen bonds and π stacking in donor molecules that create long nanowires by self-assembly results in devices that are 54% more efficient than those built with analogous donor molecules containing only the conjugated structure.IntroductionBulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices1,2 are mostly based on π-conjugated polymeric3–7 or small molecule8–13 donors, intimately mixed with acceptor molecules (most commonly fullerene derivatives) that have appropriately tuned energy levels for separating photo-generated excitons into free charge carriers at their interface. Although organic synthesis is a reliable tool for tuning the optoelectronic properties of these molecules, the supramolecular aspects necessary to optimize OPV device performance remain a great challenge. The morphology of donor and acceptor domains in the active layer is crucial to device performance because transport of the photo-generated charge carriers occurs through these domains to the electrodes.14 For instance, the size of the donor and acceptor domains should match the exciton diffusion length, which ranges from 5 to 20 nm approximately, to allow exciton splitting and charge carrier transport without recombination.15 Self-assembly is a promising strategy to control the hierarchical organization of organic solar cell components over multiple lengths scales with high order parameters and reproducibility, and thus offers the opportunity to dramatically boost device efficiencies.8,16–18BHJ solar cells that use small molecule8–13 donors (instead of polymers) are gaining attention due to their ease in preparation, the good solubility and precise molar mass of their components. This makes them more scalable, recyclable, and reproducible in terms of properties. Furthermore, recent research has shown that small molecule BHJs can reach power conversion efficiencies (up to 6.7–7)11,19 that compete with the most efficient polymer BHJs.7 Molecular design for self-assembly is a great tool to address the issue since a diverse array of motifs can be incorporated into small molecules to instruct precise control over the active layer morphology. Examples of self-assembling small molecule donors in BHJ OPVs are still rare.16,20,21We recently reported that the introduction of a hairpin-shaped molecule based on trans-diamidocyclohexane (DACH) as a self-assembly motif through hydrogen bonds and sexithiophene as a donor moiety resulted in a 23% increase in device efficiency compared to the sexithiophene alone. The concept explored in this previous work was to test the ability of non-linearly shaped nanowires of donor molecules with cavities as a strategy to create better interfaces between donors and acceptors in OPV devices. We proposed that the grooved architecture of the nanowires would facilitate receptor-ligand type cofacial interactions between the donor assemblies and the spherical fullerene acceptor molecules.16In this work we report the use of a different hairpin-shaped molecule based on thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole units and the self-assembly motif DACH (see Fig. 1A). We selected thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole as the light harvesting motif because this chromophore possesses a high extinction coefficient, absorption in a broad region of the solar spectrum, and high hole mobility according to previously reported diketopyrrolopyrrole-containing derivatives,22–26 rendering it a more powerful chromophore than sexithiophene. We describe here the optoelectronic and self-assembly properties of this novel molecule and the influence of its self-assembly properties on the performance of BHJ solar cells with the fullerene derivative phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).

Results and discussionSynthesis of hairpin-shaped diketopyrrolopyrrole molecule (DPPHP)Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route to DPPHP. First 5-bromo-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde 1 was reduced to the corresponding alcohol 2 in the presence of lithium aluminum hydride. Compound 2 was stannylated by reaction with n-butyllithium followed by addition of tributyltin chloride to afford stannane derivative 3. Compound 4, which has been previously reported,27 was attached to alcohol 3via ester formation to yield the double stannane 5. Finally, a Stille coupling between 5 and monobrominated diketopyrrolopyrrole 6 reported previously by our laboratory,5 led to the final product DPPHP in 25% yield. Scheme 1  DPPHP synthetic route. DPPHP performance in organic photovoltaics. Influence of self-assembly on device efficiencyDPPHP possesses the required optoelectronic properties for its use in device fabrication. It has broad absorption with λmax = 573 nm (Fig. 2A), good coverage of the solar spectrum, and a high extinction coefficient (6.21 × 104). The energy band gap calculated from the absorption onset is 1.91 eV, and the HOMO and LUMO levels at −5.53 eV and −3.62 eV, respectively (calculation details in SI) are well positioned relative to PC71BM which has its HOMO at −4.2 eV and LUMO at −6.1 eV (Fig. 3B). All of these values are in agreement with previously reported DPP derivatives containing the sequence thiophene–thiophene–DPP–thiopene.28,29 Fig. 2  Normalized absorption and emission spectra (λex = 573 nm) of DPPHP in chlorobenzene.

The first set of experiments for BHJ solar cell fabrication was based on the assembly of DPPHP and PC71BM in a single step. Solutions of DPPHP (7 mg ml−1) in self-assembly promoting solvents (toluene and chlorobenzene) were prepared and stirred at high temperature for 24 hours before being mixed with a PC71BM (27 mg ml−1) solution in chlorobenzene. The blend was stirred at 80 °C for 12 hours to avoid possible clustering of DPPHP and allow mixing of both components. BHJ OPVs fabricated from these solutions (see Fig. 3A) resulted in very poor working devices with efficiencies <0.0014%. In the best device, the short circuit current (Jsc) was 0.020 mA cm−2, the fill factor (FF) was 19% and the open circuit voltage (Voc) was 0.35 V. Similar results were found when powders of donor and acceptor components were mixed in the neat state and dissolved together in toluene or chlorobenzene. Different spin-coating rates, annealing temperatures, annealing times, and donor–acceptor ratios were also tested, but failed to show any improvement. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) verified that the films had very smooth surfaces and homogeneous morphologies while obvious aggregates, nanostructures, and fibrous regions were absent (Fig. S2†). Taken together, the absence of distinct assemblies and low Jsc values suggest that the domains required for efficient charge transport were not forming properly. We concluded that the fullerene acceptors interfere with DPPHP self-assembly when the two components are thoroughly mixed (Scheme 2, Pathway 1), which in turn inhibits high photocurrents and results in non-functional devices. Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the different preparation pathways used for device fabrication. Pathway 1 (top) shows the single step self-assembly of DPPPHP and PC71BM. Route 2 (bottom) shows the stepwise self-assembly of DPPHP prior to the addition of PC71BM. In order to promote DPPHP self-assembly, a stepwise strategy was used to create the active layer of the solar cell. The self-assembly process was designed starting from conditions where DPPHP molecules were unassembled and could be gradually incorporated into nanostructures. First, DPPHP (7 mg ml−1) was dissolved in self-assembly promoting solvents and stirred at temperatures close to the boiling point of the solvents for 3 hours. The solutions were gradually cooled down to 80 °C (at an approximate rate of 2 °C min−1) to avoid clustering observed by fast cooling and then cooled down to room temperature without stirring (same cooling rate) (Steps 1, 2 and 3 in Scheme 2, Pathway 2). Films were prepared immediately after cooling by spin-casting these solutions and AFM (Fig. 4A–D) revealed that this approach clearly led to strong nanowire formation. Nanowires from 100 to 400 nm in length and 2.5 nm in height were found in chlorobenzene while toluene promoted assembly of longer nanowires from 100 to 700 nm in length with a height of 8.5 nm. Single nanowires of around 2.5 nm in height are in close agreement with the length of DPPHP molecules modeled in its extended conformation.30 Fig. 4  AFM height (top row) and phase images (bottom row) of thin films made by spin casting a solution of [DPPHP] = 4.5 × 10−3 M on mica. The scale bar is of 400 nm in all the images. Solution prepared by gradual cooling in chlorobenzene (A and B). Solution prepared by gradual cooling in toluene (C and D). Solution prepared by fast cooling in toluene (E and F). The solution that was used for spin-coating the active layer was also studied by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) (see Fig. 5 and S3A†) indicating that nanowires are already formed in solution. DPPHP bundles appear dark compared to the solvent, as observed in previously reported cryo-TEM studies of block copolymers using toluene as the solvent,31 where the aggregates formed by these molecules appeared dark compared to the solvent due to the higher density of the aggregates formed relative to toluene. This result was also confirmed by the UV-Vis data (see Fig. 2B); the main band observed at 100 °C and 80 °C has λmax = 560 nm, while a shoulder near 498 nm indicates the formation of H-aggregates induced by face-to-face interactions of the π-conjugated arms of the DPPHP hairpin. After cooling down to room temperature, however, different spectral features were observed; the H-aggregate shoulder remained at the same position, but a red-shifted J-aggregate band at 578 nm appeared as a sign of interdigitation between hairpin stacks. This same observation was also found in the optical properties of the previously reported hairpin-shaped molecule containing sexithiophene electroactive branches.27 The UV-Vis spectra did not change after aging for several days. The absorption spectra of the neat films exhibited a major band from 470 nm to 560 nm and an additional red-shifted J-aggregate peak at 595 nm and a blue-shifted H-aggregate peak at 448 nm (Fig. S4†). These solutions containing DPPHP nanowire bundles were mixed with a PC71BM solution (27 mg ml−1) for brief periods of time (30 seconds) with mild stirring to allow interaction of DPPHP with acceptor molecules without disrupting the DPPHP assemblies (Step 4, Scheme 2, Pathway 2). CryoTEM showed that a combination of DPPHP nanowires and PC71BM aggregates were present in solution (see Fig. 5B and S3B†) and that upon addition of PC71BM the nanostructures formed by DPPHP were still present but their length decreased. BHJ solar cells were fabricated with these solutions and working devices were obtained in all cases (Step 5, Scheme 2, Pathway 2). The presence of nanostructures in the active layers was confirmed by AFM (see Fig. 5C and S5 and S6†). These results reveal that it is crucial to promote self-assembly of DPPHP in solution prior to the addition of PC71BM in order to have nanowires of the donor molecules in the active layer and obtain functional devices. When DPPHP and PC71BM were dissolved together in chlorobenzene or toluene prior to the slow cooling process, non-functional devices were also obtained. This observation suggests again that the addition of PC71BM at an early stage in the preparation protocol disrupts the formation of DPPHP nanowires.

Table 1 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of the DPPHP:PC71BM BHJ solar cells optimized at a spin rate of 1500 rpm, resulting in active layers with ∼70 nm thickness. A donor–acceptor ratio of 4:1 (Table 1, entry 1) resulted in 0.21% efficient devices in chlorobenzene and 0.27% in toluene. Systematically increasing the acceptor volume resulted in more efficient devices (Table 1, entries 3 to 8). Raising the DPPHP:PC71BM ratio from 4:1 to 1:1, the Jsc values increased to 2.67 mA cm−2 in toluene and to 2.98 mA cm−2 in chlorobenzene, but a larger increase in acceptor content led to less efficient devices with lower Jsc and Voc values (Table 1, entries 9 and 10). Optimized efficiencies of 0.53% in chlorobenzene and 0.43% in toluene were obtained, revealing a 400-fold improvement in efficiency compared to the devices fabricated with non-assembled solutions of DPPHP. These are the highest device efficiencies reported so far to the best of our knowledge, based on systems that utilize hydrogen bonding among donor or acceptor components.16,21,32–38

As the PC71BM content increases, however, the chlorobenzene devices become more efficient, which is likely due to the better solubility of PC71BM in chlorobenzene than in toluene,39 which helps avoid large, undesired aggregates of PC71BM.The nature of self-assembled structures obtained by fast cooling of DPPHP solutions was investigated by AFM. The solutions were directly cooled down to room temperature after stirring them at the boiling point of toluene and chlorobenzene for 3 hours (Fig. 4E and F) instead of using the stepwise cooling method (Scheme 2, Steps 1, 2 and 3), which led to the optimized devices. In this case, DPPHP was found to form nanowires that are much shorter and less bundled, while large clusters of aggregated DPPHP could also be found, meaning that a large portion of DPPHP did not assemble into defined nanowires. The devices fabricated using these solutions showed an efficiency of 0.34% after optimization, representing a 36% decrease in power conversion efficiency. These results demonstrate the importance of precisely controlling the self-assembly process to obtain the most appropriate morphology for device optimization.Even though the efficiency drastically increased using the stepwise self-assembly preparation method due to a great increase in Jsc, some parameters such as fill factor might be improved. The shape of the J–V curves clearly indicates a high degree of charge recombination, which translates into low FF values.40 A common method to address this problem is the fabrication of thinner films. Table 2 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of devices fabricated with blends using the optimized 1:1 donor–acceptor ratio at faster spin rates that produce thinner films. In the chlorobenzene blends (Table 2, entries 1 and 2), increasing the spin rates to 2000 and 2500 rpm reduced the corresponding device efficiencies from 0.43 to 0.38%, probably due to a decrease in light absorption. However, thinner films cast from toluene yielded devices (Table 2, entries 3 and 4) with improved efficiencies of 0.52 and 0.44% at 2000 and 2500 rpm, respectively. Both the FF and the Jsc were improved by spin-casting thinner films at 2000 rpm in this case. This result can be rationalized because the nanowires formed in toluene are longer and less disrupted by PC71BM than the nanowires formed in chlorobenzene. Thus, the nanowires are better preserved in thinner layers cast from toluene, resulting in less recombination, whereas the shorter nanowires in chlorobenzene require thicker layers to absorb more light.

DPPHP nanowires formed in toluene were larger than those assembled in chlorobenzene at the same concentration. Thus, devices with higher content of DPPHP showed less tendency toward disruption of nanowires by addition of PC71BM in toluene than in chlorobenzene, yielding more highly efficient devices. This can be correlated with the appearance of nanowires on the solar cell active layer. While in toluene nanowires can still be identified, in chlorobenzene they are much smaller and sometimes not observed in the devices. However, when the amount of PC71BM increases, solubility also plays an important role due to better solubility of PC71BM in chlorobenzene relative to toluene. In this sense, devices made from chlorobenzene solutions performed better as a consequence of better integration of PC71BM in the DPPHP nanowire network, resulting in an improved overall morphology of the active layer.Different control experiments were performed to demonstrate the importance of a controlled assembly process in which donor molecules are interconnected. A blend of assembled DPPHP and PC71BM was stirred overnight to mechanically disrupt the assemblies and devices were fabricated under the same conditions. The efficiency obtained after optimization dropped to 0.36%, representing a 34% decrease in efficiency. A solution of assembled DPPHP was stirred likewise for 24 hours to mechanically disrupt the nanowires and a reduced amount of fibrous material was found in films spin cast on mica (Fig. S7†). The efficiency of devices prepared from this solution mixed with PC71BM dropped to 0.34%. In other words, mechanical disruption of DPPHP assemblies leads to decreased device performance.Additional control experiments were also performed to verify the importance of the DACH self-assembly motif directing the π stacking of aromatic donor segments. In these experiments we used a linear molecule that contains the electronically active arm of the hairpin molecule (see Fig. 1, LDM). Solutions were prepared following the same stepwise procedure as for DPPHP, and devices were fabricated under the same conditions. The most efficient device showed an efficiency of 0.24% (Fig. 3C), with Jsc = 1.43 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 and FF = 29%. These devices were 54% less efficient than those prepared using the self-assembling hairpin molecule DPPHP (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the concentration of electronically active component (thiophene–thiophene–diketopyrrolopyrrole–thiophene) present in the 7 mg ml−1 of DPPHP used for device fabrication is 25% smaller than in the same amount of LDM. These results provide clear evidence that self-assembly of the donor molecules plays a crucial role in device performance, since the electronic properties of DPPHP and LDM should be essentially the same (see Fig. 2C) and there is a lower concentration of donor segments in DPPHP relative to the control system. Furthermore, the EQE spectra of DPPHP and LDM (Fig. 3D) for the optimized devices have a peak of 39% and 19% respectively, which corresponds to the absorption of PC71BM, due to the excess of fullerene in the blend. The spectra also show a broad peak between 430 and 650 nm with local maxima of 15% and 25% at around 550 nm, which is consistent with the absorption profiles of DPPHP and LDM.LDM thin films were studied by AFM (Fig. S8†) and crystalline domains were observed when the solutions were prepared by the stepwise self-assembly pathway. However, no nanowire formation or bundles were found by AFM or by UV-Vis after aging (Fig. S9†). The domains of LDM are disrupted upon acceptor addition, breaking the connections among donor molecules and resulting in inefficient charge transport (Fig. S10†). Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements41 were performed to determine the role of self-assembly in the hole transporting properties of DPPHP and LDM. A detailed description of these experiments can be found in the ESI (Section 10 and Fig. S10†). The mobility values obtained for DPPHP and LDM were 5.5 × 10−5 and 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, indicating a 45% increase in hole mobility when the self-assembly motifs are present in the molecular structure. This difference in mobility can be attributed to the better interconnection among donor molecules as a result of the self-assembly motif DACH in DPPHP, resulting in a more efficient charge transport and higher efficiency. Future improvements in efficiency are expected by replacing the insulating self-assembly motif with other hairpin structures that are fully conjugated.ConclusionsWe have shown that a self-assembly strategy based on hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking to create photovoltaic solar cells using small molecules leads to long supramolecular electron donor nanowires that enhance charge transport and device efficiencies. The strategy requires using stepwise cooling and minimal stirring of solutions to promote self-assembly of robust wires that are not disrupted when acceptor molecules are added. The efficiencies of devices created by this process can be 400-fold greater than those of devices formed by simple mixing of donor and acceptor molecules. We also found that the synergistic action of hydrogen bonds and π stacking in donor molecules that create long nanowires by self-assembly results in devices that are 54% more efficient than those built with analogous donor molecules containing only the conjugated structure.AcknowledgementsThis research project was supported by the US Department of Energy-Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering under Award no.
