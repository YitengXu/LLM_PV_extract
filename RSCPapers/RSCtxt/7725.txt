    , Accepted 22nd June 2021First published on 22nd June 2021AbstractInvestigating green and effective means for ammonia synthesis is an important but challenging task. Electrochemical ammonia synthesis (EAS) from an indirect route (N2 → NOx → NH3) provides a feasible alternative strategy. The key step in this route is the reduction of NOx to NH3 instead of N2, which requires the investigation of efficient catalysts with high selectivity of NH3. Herein, we initially demonstrate a highly efficient electrochemical reduction of NO2− to NH3 with nickel phosphide (Ni2P) as the catalyst. The system exhibits low onset potential (0.2 V vs. RHE) and high faradaic efficiency (>90%) for EAS. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the in situ generated hydrogen atoms on the surface of Ni2P greatly promote the reduction of NO2− to NH3.
Electrochemical ammonia synthesis (EAS) directly from N2 (N2 → NH3, NRR) has received extensive research attention in recent years because it can be achieved with clean electricity generated from green and renewable solar irradiation or wind.1–5 However, it still suffers from challenging problems: (i) N2 is highly inert and low solubility in water which results in a slow rate of NH3 production and (ii) the electrochemical reduction of H2O to H2 is a competing reaction, further leading to low efficiency and selectivity of NH3. In nature, N2 is oxidized by lightning bolts to form stable and ubiquitous nitrogen oxide compounds (NOx) that have high solubility.6 EAS from the indirect route in which N2 is first electrochemically oxidized to nitrogen oxides mimicking the natural process and then reduced to ammonia (N2 → NOx → NH3, NOR + NOxRR) provides a promising alternative solution.7–10 Nonetheless, during the electrochemical reduction of NOx to ammonia (NO2− + 8H+ + 6e− → NH4+ + 2H2O E0 = 0.897 V (vs. NHE), NO3− + 10H+ + 8e− → NH4+ + 3H2O E0 = 0.875 V (vs. NHE)),11 an undesirable side reaction which generates nitrogen oxyanions (NH2OH, N2O) or nitrogen (N2) as byproducts may take place, which leads to poor selectivity and low current density for NH3 production.12 Therefore, the development of novel catalysts for electrochemical NOx reduction into NH3 with high efficiency and selectivity has become a key issue.
Metal phosphides (MPs) have been demonstrated to be excellent catalysts for photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reduction reactions.13–17 The most striking feature of MPs is the existence of a small M(δ+) → P(δ−) charge transfer effect and it can readily and reversibly generate adsorbed hydrogen atoms (H) on the surface due to an ensemble effect.18,19 With this point in mind, we conceive that MPs are likely ideal catalysts for electrochemical NOx reduction to ammonia. First, the high concentration of adsorbed H on the surface of the catalysts is conducive to improving the NH3 selectivity.20,21 Second, the alternate adsorption of NOx and H on M(δ+) and P(δ−) prevents the active site competition that usually results in deteriorative catalytic performance. Meanwhile, H-rich P sites can readily deliver the adsorbed H to the neighboring NOx for synergistic hydrogenation, facilitating fast NH3 production.
As a proof of concept, herein, we initially demonstrate that nickel phosphide (Ni2P) is indeed a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) to ammonia. The present system displays a low onset potential (0.2 V vs. RHE) and achieves an NH3 generation rate of 677.2 μmol cm−2 h−1 and a high faradaic efficiency (92.6%) at 0.0 V vs. RHE. The critical development is that significantly increasing the concentration of active H on the surface of the Ni2P catalyst through electrochemical pretreatment can greatly promote the NaNO2 reduction rate to NH3, which increases the initial current density by an order of magnitude and decreases the activation time from 1–2 hours to a few seconds.
Ni2P was in situ generated on the pre-cleaned Ni foam via a phosphorization method with NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source.22 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern showed 7 clear diffraction peaks (Fig. 1a). Two of them belong to the nickel substrate and the other 5 peaks were ascribed to hexagonal lattice planes of Ni2P. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results revealed that the surface of the Ni foam became coarse after the phosphorization process (Fig. 1b–d and Fig. S2 ESI†). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image showed good crystallinity and revealed a lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.295 nm, which belongs to the (300) plane of Ni2P (Fig. 1e). The SEM elemental mapping displayed a uniform distribution of Ni and P elements on the material (Fig. 1f). The presence of a small amount of oxygen was attributed to the partial surface oxidation during preparation as frequently demonstrated in the literature.14,22,23

Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction experiments were performed using 1 M NaOH to avoid the side reaction of NO2− with NH3 in acidic solutions.24,25 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests displayed that both the Ni foam and Ni2P have negligible electrochemical activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) when the potential is above −0.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2a). To our delight, the current density of Ni2P was markedly increased upon adding NaNO2 into the electrolyte, which exhibited an onset potential at about 0.2 V vs. RHE. It should be pointed out that the onset potential is even above the theoretical potential for the HER (0.0 V vs. RHE). This finding confirmed that the catalytic current starting at about 0.2 V vs. RHE is attributed to the electrochemical reduction of NaNO2 rather than H2O. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then employed to measure the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which is related to the electrocatalytic kinetics (Fig. 2b).26 The EIS response for each electrode is fitted by a simplified Randles equivalent circuit; the model and Rct values of the Nyquist plots were compared (Fig. S4, ESI†). Consistently, Ni2P showed a low Rct of less than 1 Ω in the presence of NaNO2. This result indicated that the Ni2P catalyst has a fast electron transfer and promising catalytic performance for NaNO2 reduction.

(d) The current–time curve of Ni2P at 0.0 V vs. RHE with the intermittent addition of 2 mmol NaNO2. All experiments were carried out in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte with 0.1 M NaNO2 at 25 °C without iR-correction. 
Potentiostatic electrolysis was also conducted to examine the NH3 generation rate and faradaic efficiency at different potentials. It was confirmed using 1H NMR that NH3 was generated from nitrite reduction (Fig. S5 ESI†) and the yield was quantified using Nessler's reagent (Fig. S6 ESI†). By varying the potential from 0.2 to −0.3 V vs. RHE, the generation rate of NH3 gradually increased and the FE remained stable at about 90% (Fig. 2c). The generation rate reached a maximum of 1193.4 μmol cm−2 h−1 at −0.3 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the recycling test was performed at 0.0 V vs. RHE; the competing HER can be avoided at this potential. The current density gradually decreased along with the consumption of NaNO2. When each run was nearly completed, another 2 mmol NaNO2 was added into the reaction cell and the current density was restored to the initial value as shown in Fig. 2d (5 repeated runs). These results showed that the Ni2P catalyst has high tolerance for electrocatalytic NaNO2 reduction.
Unexpectedly, during the LSV experiments and long-term potentiostatic electrolysis, the electrocatalytic reduction of NaNO2 showed an obvious activation process (Fig. 3a and b). First, the phenomenon was ascribed to an autocatalytic pathway, where the formed NH3 participated in the reaction to promote NaNO2 reduction.27 However, when 2 mmol NH3·H2O was added into the electrolyte, the electrocatalytic process still remained the same (Fig. S8, ESI†). Subsequently, it was conceived that some active intermediates in situ generated during electrocatalysis promoted this reaction. To testify this hypothesis, an intermittent potential was applied during potentiostatic electrolysis. The same activation phenomenon was observed during the interval of 1500 s. When the power was resumed after cutting off for 500 s, the current density increased from the initial value rather than the value before the interruption (Fig. 3c). These results indicated that there was no intermediate generated in the electrolyte that accelerates the NaNO2 reduction.

(f) HER of Ni2P at −0.3 V vs. RHE for 500 s, followed by adding 2 mmol NaNO2 into the electrolyte and changing the potential to 0.0 V vs. RHE. 
A close inspection of the LSV curve of Ni2P in 1 M NaOH without NaNO2 revealed a weak reduction peak (Fig. 3d). When the solution was purged with argon or the pre-reduced Ni2P was used as the catalyst, this peak still existed, suggesting that it did not correspond to the reduction of O2 or surface oxides of Ni2P (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). The peak currents were changing linearly with the square root of the scan rate, which means the process is diffusion controlled.28 Moreover, the position of the reduction peak also varied with the change of pH (Fig. 3e). The relation between potential and pH was approximately −59 mV/pH unit (Fig. S11, ESI†). Therefore, this electrocatalytic phenomenon can be rationalized as a proton coupled electron-transfer (PCET) process in which H2O was reduced to a hydrogen atom (H) through the Volmer mechanism (H2O + e− → Hads + OH−)29,30 and this resulted in the adsorption of highly reactive H (Ni2P–H) on the surface of Ni2P. To confirm this assumption, a pretreatment experiment was designed and conducted. First, hydrogen was generated at a more negative potential (−0.3 V vs. RHE) with a large current density. During this period, the surface of Ni2P was covered by amounts of reactive H. Then, NaNO2 was directly injected into the electrolyte and the potential was adjusted to 0.0 V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. 3f, the current density reached the maximum instantaneously. These findings ascertained that the generation of the highly reactive H on the surface of Ni2P was responsible for the activation process observed in the above experiments.
After confirming the important role of the reactive H, the possible reaction pathway during NO2− reduction was further investigated. By examining the catalytic performance of Ni2P for various nitrogen compounds, it can be deduced whether they acted as the intermediates for the NO2− reduction process. When adding nitric oxide (NO) or hydroxylamine (H2NOH) into the electrolyte, Ni2P also exhibited catalytic activity at 0.0 V vs. RHE (Fig. S12–S15, ESI†). This result indicated that NO and H2NOH probably existed in the NO2− reduction reaction. However, when hydrazine (NH2NH2) was used as the reactant, the current density did not show significant changes (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†), which suggested that NH3 was not converted from NH2NH2.
In order to obtain more insights into the intrinsic catalytic mechanism, density functional theory (DFT) studies were also carried out to simulate the reaction pathways in the absence (using H2O as the hydrogen source) and presence of the reactive H. Based on the DFT structural optimization, H (or H2O) atoms were more likely to be adsorbed on the top of P sites at the surface of Ni2P, while NO2− (or HyNOx clusters) adsorbs near Ni sites (Fig. 4a). In the process of NO2− extracting an H atom to produce HNO2, the formation energy difference between the initial and final states was basically the same for the adsorbed reactive H and H2O on the surface of Ni2P. To show the difference between them, DFT calculations of the reaction barrier were performed based on the optimized reactant and the product, using synchronous transit methods,31 which interpolate the reaction pathway to find a transition state and are useful for predicting barriers to chemical reactions. The calculation results (Fig. 4b) show that the reaction barrier for the adsorbed reactive H (<1 eV) is obviously lower than that for the adsorbed H2O (>3 eV). Furthermore, several possible intermediate reaction states are theoretically simulated, while their local structures and the corresponding energy paths are also plotted. For this exothermic NO2− reduction reaction, the whole reaction pathway through the adsorbed reactive H on Ni2P is smoother (less ups and downs) than that for Ni2P initially adsorbed with H2O. Therefore, the DFT calculation results corroborate with experimental observations and further testify that the in situ generated H atom adsorbed on Ni2P greatly promotes NO2− reduction to NH3. Based on the above results and combined with the literature reports, a feasible catalytic pathway was proposed for EAS from NO2−.32,33 As shown in Fig. 4c, initially on the surface of the Ni2P catalyst with the charge separation effect (Ni(δ+) → P(δ−)), the reactive H was in situ generated upon electrochemical treatment and preferentially adsorbed on the non-metal P sites to form Ni2P–H. Then, the active Ni2P–H on the surface readily reacted with the added NO2− substrate, which alternately adsorbed near intimate Ni sites, to produce NO, H2NO, and H2NOH in sequence. Finally, NH3 was directly converted from H2NOH.

In summary, it is demonstrated that highly efficient EAS can be achieved a Ni2P catalyst through electrocatalytic NaNO2 reduction. The Ni2P catalyst exhibits an intriguing catalytic pathway due to its intrinsic characteristics such as the rich H adsorption ability and small charge separation between Ni(δ+) and P(δ−). This was fully taken advantage of by electrochemical pretreatment to realize the in situ generation of substantial reactive H preferentially adsorbed on P sites, which plays a very important role in promoting the NaNO2 reduction to ammonia by greatly accelerating the reaction rate. This work provides important insights into metal phosphide catalysed EAS through nitrite reduction and will stimulate further investigation on metal phosphides for nitrogen reduction.
