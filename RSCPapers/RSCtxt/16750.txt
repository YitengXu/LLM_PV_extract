    , Accepted 20th September 2016First published on 23rd September 2016AbstractMixed-ion (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite solar cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies surpassing 20%. However, in order to obtain these high efficiencies the preparation is performed in a controlled inert atmosphere. Here, we report a procedure for manufacturing highly efficient solar cells with a mixed-ion perovskite in ambient atmosphere. By including a heating step at moderate temperatures of the mesoporous titanium dioxide substrates, and spin-coating the perovskite solution on the warm substrates in ambient air, a red intermediate phase is obtained. Annealing the red phase at 100 °C results in a uniform and crystalline perovskite film, whose thickness is dependent on the substrate temperature prior to spin-coating. The temperature was optimized between 20 and 100 °C and it was observed that 50 °C substrate temperature yielded the best solar cell performances. The average efficiency of the best device was 17.6%, accounting for current–voltage (I–V) measurement hysteresis, with 18.8% performance in the backward scan direction and 16.4% in the forward scan direction. Our results show that it is possible to manufacture high-efficiency mixed-ion perovskite solar cells under ambient conditions, which is relevant for large-scale and low-cost device manufacturing processing.
Introduction
Inorganic–organic perovskite materials have recently gained remarkable interest in the scientific community, because of the impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCE) displayed by perovskite solar cells (PSC).1–5 In the original articles the photovoltaic device architecture of PSCs was based on that of the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell, where a metal halide perovskite replaced the dye as the light absorbing material.6 Since their discovery in 2009, PSCs have also been shown to work in inverted and planar thin-film configurations with high photovoltaic performance.7–10 Several different combinations of the ABX3 perovskite structure, where X is an anion and A is a cation larger than the metal cation B, have been reported to function well in photovoltaic applications.11–14 It has been noticed that bromine addition to the conventional methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite structure, yielding MAPbI3−xBrx, improves the stability of the perovskite phase, and with an addition of the larger cation formamidinium (FA), the light-harvesting wavelength range is extended.15–17 The present published record efficiency of a PSC, which employed both of these strategies, has reached a PCE of 20.8%.18,19 The solar cell was comprised of a mixed-ion lead perovskite of the formula (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x on a mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) scaffold as the electron selective layer and a small molecular organic hole-transporting material (HTM) as a hole selective layer. Furthermore, an addition of a cesium cation to the (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite mixture has yielded solar cells with a PCE of 21.1% showing that a precise control over each ionic component in the perovskite is important for obtaining stable and high-efficiency solar cells.20
Despite these recent advances in the field, the PSCs still suffer from several issues, one of which is the requirement of controlled atmospheric conditions in the fabrication of perovskite materials. The majority of highly efficient PSCs are prepared inside a costly inert atmosphere, for example inside a nitrogen- or argon-filled glovebox. Regarding large-scale solar cell production, the use of an inert atmosphere results in significantly increased manufacturing costs, compared to the industrially more attractive option of using ambient or less controlled conditions. Some studies have been conducted on the preparation of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) under ambient conditions, which has resulted in devices of relatively high performance although considerably lower as compared to the performance of solar cells prepared under inert conditions.21–24 As proposed by You et al., humidity in the ambient air during the perovskite preparation may result in the improvement of the crystal growth, that is related to grain boundary creep due to water accumulation on the perovskite crystal boundaries.23 Furthermore, Schmidt et al. have reported a successful application of a large-scale manufacturing procedure of perovskite solar cells under ambient air.25 However, preparation of the mixed-ion (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite under ambient conditions has not been reported so far, despite the material having potentially superior efficiency and stability as compared to that of the MAPbI3 perovskite.26 The stability of the perovskite material, itself, remains an open question in the commercialization of PSCs. The perovskite degrades quickly in the presence of water and it has been shown that the thermal stability of the material may be problematic.27 However, it has also been shown that these potential stability problems may partly be overcome through proper sealing of the solar cells, by use of stable electron- and hole-selective layers and by using more stable perovskite materials.20,28
A uniform surface coverage of the perovskite film is of large importance for PSCs in order to avoid shunting caused by the formation of pin-holes, which results in a loss of performance.29,30 For this purpose, a hot-casting preparation technique for perovskite solar cells was presented by Nie et al., where a perovskite solution at 70 °C was spin-cast on substrates at 180 °C.31 By varying the temperature of the substrate, the crystallization of the perovskite film and the resulting morphology could be controlled in order to obtain highly crystalline and pin-hole free perovskite films.
In this work, we report a new procedure for manufacturing high-efficiency mixed-ion perovskite solar cells under ambient conditions. Prior to the deposition of the perovskite, the TiO2 electrode was heated at moderate temperatures. Thereafter an anti-solvent is injected during spin-coating of the perovskite solution, which has previously been shown to be advantageous for smooth perovskite film formation.17,29 The heating step of the TiO2 has a significant effect on the formation of the perovskite film and the performance of the resulting solar cells. Samples were prepared on mp-TiO2 substrates heated at temperatures from 20 °C to 100 °C, while maintaining the perovskite precursor solution at room temperature. The material characteristics of the resulting perovskite films were studied using UV-Vis-NIR and steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy, along with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand the performance of the perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
Perovskite solar cells were fabricated following a similar procedure as reported by Correa-Baena et al.,10 and the device structure is depicted in Fig. 1a. A dense blocking layer of TiO2 (bl-TiO2) was first deposited on conducting fluorine-doped tin(IV) oxide (FTO) glass substrates by spray-pyrolysis. A ∼200 nm thick layer of mp-TiO2 was then spin-coated on the substrates from a nanoparticle solution and the substrate sintered at 500 °C. The substrates were spin-coated, after cooling down, with a (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite solution and a chlorobenzene anti-solvent was injected during the deposition. As previously reported by Jeon et al.,17 the purpose of the anti-solvent injection during the spin-coating step of the perovskite deposition is to remove the excess solvent from the film and obtain a uniform non-perovskite intermediate phase. They describe the formation of a transparent homogenous yellow film, which leads to the formation of a uniform perovskite film after annealing. During the perovskite deposition at room temperature under ambient atmosphere we obtained a non-uniform and translucent intermediate phase and upon sintering the film the perovskite formation was to a large degree imperfect or did not occur at all. Instead, after heating the mp-TiO2 substrate to temperatures above 40 °C, but not exceeding 80 °C, for 15 minutes and spin-coating the perovskite solution on the warm substrate, a uniform intermediate phase was obtained as depicted in Fig. 1b. However, the color of the intermediate phase film was orange red, as opposed to the transparent yellow film obtained by Jeon et al. under inert conditions at room temperature. On the other hand, in a very recent study others have observed the red phase in an inert atmosphere for the mixed perovskite.20 Therefore, the formation of the red phase is probably not related to the ambient conditions, but is more likely to be a temperature effect in our case. Many different plumbates and bromine containing perovskites, which may contribute to the red color of the intermediate phase,32–34 can be formed but it is difficult to identify the exact chemical species because of for e.g. the potential presence of an optical effect, which we will discuss later. The obtained perovskite intermediate films were annealed at 100 °C to yield the perovskite material. Photographs of the intermediate phase and the resulting perovskite films, prepared at substrate temperatures from 20 °C to 100 °C, are presented in Fig. 1c. If the films were processed to solar cells, a layer of 2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) HTM was spin-coated on the films and the procedure was completed by thermally evaporating a gold contact on top to yield the device structure FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au.

(c) Photographs of the obtained intermediate phase (above), and the resulting perovskite film after annealing (below), prepared at different substrate temperatures. 
During the temperature optimization, it was noticed that a mp-TiO2 substrate at a temperature of 50 °C yielded the best performing solar cell with an average power conversion efficiency of 17.6%, whereas the best devices fabricated at room temperature and 100 °C yielded 12.4% and 7.0%, respectively.
To gain further insight into the nature of the above-mentioned differences, the formation of the red intermediate film and its effect on the resulting perovskite material was investigated. Fig. 2a shows the UV-Vis absorbance and the steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the red intermediate phase. The absorbance onset of the intermediate phase is around 600 nm, which explains its characteristic orange red color. Interference fringes are also present in the UV-Vis spectrum (see Fig. S3 in the ESI† for full transmittance and reflectance spectra), which are typical of thin film layers with a uniform and well-defined thickness. The emission spectrum of the red phase, also depicted in Fig. 2a, shows a peak with a maximum at around 710 nm. Interestingly, the emission peak is very broad, ranging from 600 nm to 800 nm. It also has an irregular shape due to multiple shoulders at around 665, 690 and 760 nm. It is possible that these shoulders originate from e.g. different materials or, radiative relaxation into vibrational excited states, or interference fringes caused by multiple reflections in the red film.35

(b) ATR FT-IR spectrum of the red intermediate phase before sintering at 100 °C (red) and after sintering (black). (c) Optical microscope images of the red intermediate phase (left) and the respective perovskite film obtained after annealing (right). 
Typically, the emission of a crystalline material with a well-defined band gap does not exhibit a considerable Stokes shift, which is in contrast to the red intermediate film emission. The solvents used in the perovskite precursor solution, dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), are both polar solvents and are known to contribute to the Stokes losses of fluorophores.36 The attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectrum (see Fig. 2b) confirms that there is some solvent present in the intermediate film, as shown most notably by the carbonyl (CO) stretch at approximately 1700 cm−1 originating from the DMF solvent and the sulfoxide (SO) stretch 1000 cm−1 originating from the DMSO solvent. The C–Cl stretches from chlorobenzene are not observed. The observed Stokes shift of the red phase emission could thus be related to solvent relaxation of the excited species in the DMF:DMSO environment. A broad feature for the red intermediate phase is observed in the range of 3000–3500 cm−1 which disappears upon annealing. In this region the N–H stretches of the methylammonium and formamidinum cations are commonly observed but the feature is more likely due to O–H stretches of water adsorbed by the hygroscopic DMSO and DMF solvents.
The optical microscope images (see Fig. 2c) of the intermediate phase and the respective perovskite film obtained after annealing show that its surface is microscopically ordered and uniform. A highly ordered wrinkle pattern is observed that could be due to either desiccation cracks from solvent evaporation during the spin-coating step or phase separation in the film.37,38 Similar patterns have been observed in the field of organic solar cells, resulting from spin-coating a mixture of different compounds on films, although on a much smaller scale.39 The red color could also be caused by a photonic effect from the formation of wrinkles and folds in the intermediate phase film.40 The thermal expansion coefficients of the perovskite precursor solution and the substrate are inherently different. When the solution is spin-coated on a warm substrate the sample cools down due to the air flow inside the spin-coater and the injection of the anti-solvent. The precursor phase then experiences a compressive strain due to differences in the thermal contraction of the precursor and the substrate. The wet film, being a viscoelastic solution of the dissolved perovskite precursors in a mixture of DMF:DMSO, could then form wrinkles and folds since such bending is more energetically favorable than compression.41–43 Excessive formation of wrinkles can lead to the formation of cracks in the film, much like those experienced for the red phase formed at higher substrate temperatures such as 70 °C (see Fig. 1c). The wrinkle pattern is observed for films where the red intermediate phase is obtained and the pattern persists in the perovskite film after annealing the intermediate phase at 100 °C, which can be observed in the microscopic image of the perovskite film in Fig. 2c as well as in the ESI.† These features can also be observed in the SEM surface morphology of annealed perovskite films (see ESI†). It can also be noted that we prepared a MAPbI3 intermediate phase film, in a manner identical to that of the mixed-ion (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, and a microscopic image of it can be observed in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The image of the MAPbI3 intermediate phase shows a uniform coating with no similar wrinkle pattern, meaning that the wrinkles may be specific to the conditions of the mixed-ion perovskite. The exact chemical nature of the red intermediate film and the optical effects of the wrinkle pattern will be studied in more detail in the future work, and in this work we instead focus on investigating the perovskite materials obtained at different substrate temperatures and the resulting solar cell performances.
Since the formation of the red phase appears to be dependent on the temperature of the mp-TiO2 substrate, the effect of the intermediate substrate heating step on the perovskite film formation is of interest. We specifically studied the temperature range of 20–100 °C and, as mentioned above, the samples for material characterization were prepared with a structure of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite. The thicknesses of the resulting perovskite capping-layers as a function of the mp-TiO2 substrate temperature were determined by cross-sectional SEM (see ESI† for details) and are reported in Table 1. The perovskite capping-layer thickness increases when the substrate temperature is increased from 20 °C to 80 °C, which is similar to the effect observed by Nie et al. when hot-casting the perovskite at different substrate temperatures.31 Surface morphology SEM images of the perovskite films obtained at substrate temperatures of 20 °C, 50 °C and 100 °C, as well as cross-sectional SEM images of solar cells made at the same temperatures are presented in Fig. 3. The increase in the thickness of the perovskite capping layer can be observed by comparing the cross-sectional SEM images for the 20 °C and 50 °C samples in Fig. 3a and b, and it is also further depicted by cross-sectional SEM images at all substrate temperatures in the ESI.† However, the SEM surface morphology of the perovskite layer remains the same to a large degree with regard to the surface coverage and perovskite grain sizes, up to substrate temperatures of 80 °C. Above this temperature the perovskite starts forming immediately during the spin-coating cycle even before the anti-solvent injection. As the SEM images in Fig. 3c show, this results in the formation of large perovskite islands and a non-uniform perovskite film with incomplete surface coverage.

For the substrate prepared at 100 °C the magnification has been optimized in order to capture the large features observed. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the prepared perovskite films, which were calculated from the transmittance and reflectance spectra of each film (see ESI† for details), are presented in Fig. 4a and b. The absorption of the perovskite films increases with increasing substrate heating temperature and reaches a maximum for the substrates at 50–80 °C. This increase can be related to the gradual increase in the thickness of the perovskite film with substrate temperature. At substrate temperatures between 50 °C and 80 °C the visible light absorption is very efficient with approximately 80% of the incident light in the wavelength region 300–750 nm being absorbed by the perovskite film. Once the large perovskite islands start forming, at substrate temperatures above 80 °C, the transmittance in the visible region increases which is most likely due to the non-uniformity of the films. However, the reflectance values do not change greatly resulting in a net loss in absorption.

The steady-state photoluminescence of the different perovskite films is presented in Fig. 4c. The excitation wavelength was set to 500 nm and the resulting emission peaks were fitted using a Voigt probability density function (see Fig. S7† for raw data). As the substrate temperature increases, the emission peak is red shifted from a peak position of 757 nm at 20 °C to 775 nm at 100 °C. The fluorescence peak position is largely dependent on the band gap (Eg) of the emitting material, so a shift of the emission peak position could hint towards a change in the band gap of the perovskite which could be due to a compositional change in the material.33 Because of this, we calculated Eg from Tauc plots using the data from the optical measurements (see ESI† for details). However, the determination of Eg for the different perovskite films yielded close to the same value for all films (1.57–1.58 eV) except for the 100 °C film (1.55 eV). If instead the absorption onsets of the different films in the emission wavelength region are compared (see also Fig. 4c) the observed fluorescence peak shift can be explained by the inner filter effect where the emission is partially re-absorbed by the perovskite. The absorption increases relatively more in the region of 740–770 nm as opposed to above 770 nm with increasing substrate temperature (excluding the 100 °C substrate). This means that relatively more light from the blue part of the emission peak can get reabsorbed, by the perovskite material, as compared to the light from the red part of the peak. This causes a slightly non-Gaussian shape of the resulting emission peak and results in the appearance of a peak shift (see the inner filter effect modeling in the ESI†). Care should therefore be taken not to misinterpret a red shift in emission as a change in the energy levels of the perovskite when in fact it is the result of the inner filter effect and a change in the optical density of the films.
As observed in Fig. 4b and c, the absorption of the 100 °C film is lower compared to that of the film at 80 °C which does not fully explain the large red shift of the 100 °C emission peak. However, the emission of the 100 °C sample originates from the perovskite islands (see Fig. 3c), which are approximately 3 μm thick and 10–50 μm wide. Thus, the emitting material in the 100 °C sample experiences a relatively larger inner filter effect due to a larger amount of the neighboring, non-excited bulk material, in comparison to the film at 80 °C. It is also possible that the 100 °C film exhibits a slightly different perovskite composition compared to the other samples, due to the fact that the perovskite formation mechanism is different since no intermediate phase is formed and to the fact that the calculated Eg is somewhat lower. The fluorescence peak shift would then be the result of a shift in the energy levels. In this context, it should be noted that since the perovskite film at 100 °C is not uniform there could be errors in the band gap calculations where one must assume uniformity of the film. A red shift of the emission peak has also previously been attributed to a crystal size increase of the perovskite,44 but other effects might also be important, such as the self-absorption mentioned above.45 In our case, the SEM surface morphology images (see ESI†) do not show a notable difference in the crystal sizes for films at 20–80 °C. However, above 80 °C the perovskite crystals are larger as noted above.
The crystallographic properties of the perovskite material were studied using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) measurements and the diffraction patterns of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 5. Several different peaks can be observed in the diffraction patterns owing to the different materials. The characteristic XRD peaks in Fig. 5 originating from the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite phase, the unreacted PbI2 in the film and the FTO/TiO2 substrate are denoted by α, δ and *, respectively. The small feature observed at 11.6° probably originates from a slight formation of the non-perovskite phase of FAPbI3.16 In general, the relative intensities of the perovskite peak at 14.0° and the PbI2 peak at 12.6° can be compared in order to qualitatively determine the completeness of the perovskite formation from its precursor phase. Therefore, it is evident from the XRD results that the perovskite formation at room temperature in ambient air is to a large degree imperfect which can be noted from the large PbI2 peak at 12.6° in comparison to the small perovskite peak at 14.0°. Interestingly, not only does the increased mp-TiO2 substrate temperature result in thicker perovskite films (as described above by cross-sectional SEM images and absorption spectra) but the perovskite formation is also improved, as shown by the relative increase of the 14.0° peak compared to that of the 12.6° peak. The PbI2 impurities and defects in the perovskite films, if present, are probably located mostly on the surface (or grain boundaries) of the material. As the perovskite film becomes thicker, the ratio between the surface area and the bulk crystal becomes smaller and, as observed in the XRD, the perovskite peak at 14.0° becomes larger in comparison to the PbI2 peak at 12.6°. When the perovskite begins to form in big islands instead of homogeneous films on substrates above 70 °C, the PbI2 peak almost vanishes, which can be expected due to the decrease in the surface to bulk ratio.

A large statistical study was also conducted on the effects of the substrate temperature on the resulting performance of the solar cell devices. All the solar cells were prepared under ambient atmosphere, unless otherwise stated, using the device structure of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au. The combined performance results for a total of 75 devices are presented in Fig. 6a and the device parameters for the most efficient solar cells of each substrate temperature has been tabulated in Table 2. It should be noted that no anti-reflective coating was used for any of the devices presented here. The average efficiency (PCEavg) of each cell, measured under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination intensity (1000 W m−2), was obtained from calculating the average of the backward (open-circuit to short-circuit) and forward (short-circuit to open-circuit) scan efficiencies, thus accounting for the hysteretic effect observed in the current–voltage (I–V) properties of the devices. We note a large difference in the performance of the solar cells fabricated with mp-TiO2 substrates at different temperatures. The highest PCEs were obtained with the substrate temperature of 50 °C. The total average efficiency (PCEtot,avg), which accounts for the hysteresis and the number of cells fabricated at each substrate temperature, amounted to 14.1% for a substrate temperature of 50 °C. The I–V characteristics for the record device, prepared on a substrate at 50 °C in ambient air, are shown in Fig. 6b, and the I–V parameters are displayed in the inset table. The record device displayed a PCE of 18.8% (backward), and 16.4% (forward) making the average efficiency 17.6%. A standard solar cell was prepared in a nitrogen glovebox without substrate heating for comparison and displayed a performance of 18.2% (see ESI†).

We relate the superior performance of the cells prepared at 50 °C to a good and reproducible formation of the perovskite material and to a uniform thickness of the film, which is in the range of 500–700 nm. Above and below this substrate temperature (and thickness), the performance of the devices is worse, mostly because of a decrease in the photocurrent and fill factor (see Table 2 and Fig. S12†). Below this temperature, the perovskite films are thinner which results in less photoabsorption and, therefore, lower photocurrents. Even though substrate temperatures higher than 50 °C result in more complete perovskite crystallization according to the XRD, this does not translate directly to the improved performance of the devices, as can be observed in Fig. 6a by the general decrease in PCEavg with increased substrate temperature. An increase in the perovskite capping-layer thickness can be expected to result in a lower photoinduced charge density in the perovskite material, and thus lower conductivity.46,47 Photogenerated charge-carriers will also have to travel a greater distance to reach the contacts in thicker films, which may result in an increased probability of recombination. The additional photons at 1 sun illumination intensity that can be absorbed, for perovskite films with a thickness over approximately 500 nm, are negligible due to the strong absorption of the perovskite.19 The photocurrent can therefore not increase for thicker perovskite layers and a decrease is instead expected due to recombination. These aforementioned factors might contribute to the PCE decrease observed for devices fabricated at substrate temperatures of 60–80 °C.
Above 80 °C the perovskite films comprise of non-uniformly distributed large perovskite islands (see Fig. 3 and S9†) and the PCEtot,avg for the solar cells at 90 °C is 8.6%, and 5.9% at 100 °C. This is speculated to be due to the incomplete surface coverage, which leads to pin-holes and inhomogeneous thickness of the film, and the low absorption of those films. The former explains the voltage loss observed for those devices, while the latter results in a lower photocurrent (see Table 2 and Fig. S12†).
As can be observed in Fig. 6a, devices prepared at room temperature (with no substrate heating) perform rather poorly and have a total average efficiency of 8.7%. This is most likely due to the low thickness of the perovskite film and incomplete perovskite crystallization, which is shown by the SEM, UV-Vis and XRD measurements (see Table 1, Fig. 4 and 5) to be the case for the perovskite films formed at room temperature. The perovskite precursor film obtained at room temperature was translucent and non-uniform and, as mentioned before, the red intermediate phase did not appear (see Fig. 1c).
We also carried out incident-photon-to-collected-electron (IPCE) measurements for devices prepared at different substrate temperatures, see Fig. 7a. The photocurrent onset begins at around 790 nm, which corresponds quite well to the absorption onset of the films (see Fig. 4a). The overall light-harvesting efficiency systematically improves in going from substrate temperatures of 20 °C to 50 °C, which much like the I–V characteristics, can be explained by the increased absorption of the films due to the increased thickness and crystallinity of the perovskite films. Temperatures higher than 50 °C yield lower light-harvesting efficiencies most likely for the same reasons as those for the decrease in PCEtot,avg. The square shape of the IPCE spectra suggests that the different wavelengths are absorbed rather uniformly in the perovskite films. However, for the 100 °C samples, there is a relatively larger current loss in the red part of the spectrum compared to that in the blue part, which may imply charge collection losses in the devices because of recombination issues. In the red part of the spectrum (above 500 nm) charges are generated rather uniformly in the photoabsorbing film, whereas in the blue part (below 500 nm) they are generated, to a large extent, close to the TiO2. This can result in the excited electrons generated by the blue light being more easily extracted by the TiO2 contact than the electrons generated by the red light. The slight shoulder observed at 800 nm is most likely due to instrumental artefacts and results, at the maximum, in an overestimation of the integrated short-circuit current of around 0.5%. In Fig. 7b we display both the integrated short-circuit current density (Isc) as calculated from the IPCE spectra and the short-circuit current density as measured by the I–V scans (Jsc) of the same devices. It can be seen that the Isc values match rather well with the Jsc values but the slight deviation between the values is most likely due to the masking inaccuracies or spectral mismatch of the light sources used in each case.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we show in this work that it is possible to manufacture very high-efficiency mixed-ion perovskite solar cells in ambient atmosphere using an additional pre-heating step at moderate temperatures of the mesoporous titanium dioxide substrates. The results indicate that the pre-heating step affects both the thickness and crystallinity of the resulting perovskite film. The formation of a uniform red intermediate phase was observed when the substrates were pre-heated at temperatures between 40 and 70 °C. The red phase was confirmed, by FT-IR measurements, to contain solvents from the perovskite precursor solution, which could explain the large Stokes shift observed for the emission of the phase. Furthermore, optical microscope images of the intermediate phase showed an ordered wrinkle pattern which persisted in the film after annealing it to form a perovskite.
By varying the temperature of the pre-heating step, cross-sectional SEM images of the resulting perovskite solar cells showed that the thickness of the perovskite capping-layer increased with the substrate temperature. However, above 80 °C the perovskite formed immediately during spin-coating which resulted in non-uniform films. This translated directly to the absorption of the films which increased up to a maximum at around 60–80 °C and decreased for warmer substrates. Also, the emission of the perovskite films, prepared at different substrate temperatures, showed a red shift with increased substrate temperature which was assigned to the self-absorption of the perovskite.
The highest total average efficiency of the solar cells was obtained with substrates heated at 50 °C pre-perovskite deposition and it amounted to 14.1%, compared to 8.7% and 5.9% for devices prepared at 20 °C and 100 °C warm substrates, respectively. The best efficiency, obtained with the method at 50 °C, was 18.8% in the backward scan direction and an average efficiency of 17.6%, showing that our results pave way for high-efficiency perovskite solar cell manufacturing on an industrial scale in ambient atmosphere.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
Solar cells were fabricated by a procedure similar to that described by Correa-Baena et al.10 All solar cell manufacturing steps were performed under ambient conditions, but the perovskite and hole-transporting material solutions were mixed inside an argon-filled glovebox. Conducting SnO2:F glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC15) were cut to the size of 25 mm × 15 mm and patterned by chemical etching using zinc powder and 2 M hydrochloric acid. The substrates were washed by sonication subsequently in 2% RBS™ 50 solution (Fluka) for 30 minutes, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 15 minutes each. A thin (∼50–100 nm) and dense blocking layer of TiO2 was applied on the glass using spray-pyrolysis at 500 °C, from a solution of 0.2 M titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (Aldrich) and 2 M acetylacetone (Aldrich) in isopropanol (Aldrich). A 150 mg ml−1 solution of TiO2 nanoparticle paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) in ethanol was then spin-coated on the substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds and dried at 125 °C for 15 minutes on a hotplate, before sintering the substrates in air at 500 °C for 30 minutes. To prepare a (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite solution we mixed PbI2 (TCI), FAI (Dyenamo), PbBr2 (Alfa Aesar), and MABr (Dyenamo), in molar concentrations of 1.1, 1, 0.2, and 0.2, respectively, in 4:1 DMF:DMSO (anhydrous, Aldrich). The solutions were heated to around 100 °C to dissolve the inorganic salts but were otherwise kept at room temperature at all times. Prior to the perovskite spin-coating, the TiO2 electrodes were heated at temperatures of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 °C on a hotplate for 15 minutes. In quick succession, the substrates were taken off the hotplate and placed in the spin-coater, and 75 μl of the perovskite solution was spread onto the mp-TiO2. The substrate was then spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 seconds and 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. In the middle of the second spin-coating step (at 15 seconds), 125 μl of the anti-solvent chlorobenzene (anhydrous, Aldrich) was injected onto the film. The perovskite films were then annealed on a hotplate maintained at 100 °C for 60 minutes. An HTM solution was prepared in chlorobenzene with 70 mM spiro-OMeTAD (Borun), 35 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Iolitech) from a solution of 520 mg ml−1 Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (anhydrous, Aldrich), 230 mM 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) and 20 mM cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dyenamo) from a solution of 300 mg ml−1 FK209 in acetonitrile. The HTM solution was then spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 10 seconds and 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, a 0.20 cm2 (0.4 × 0.5 cm2) gold back-contact with a thickness of 80 nm was thermally evaporated on the films using a Leica EM MED020 evaporator fitted with a Leica EM QSG100 detection system. For the MAPbI3 intermediate phase film, we mixed a solution of 1.1 M PbI2 and 1 M MAI (Dyenamo) in 4:1 DMF:DMSO and spin-coated the solution on TiO2 substrates using the same methods described above.
We want to point out that, according to our practical knowledge, the formation of the red intermediate phase appears to be somewhat air humidity dependent. In our case, with a relative air humidity of around 50% and an air temperature of 21 °C, the red phase would appear uniformly at substrate temperatures between 40 and 70 °C which, in turn, resulted in the formation of a uniform perovskite film. In a more humid atmosphere, however, the substrates would seem to require slightly higher heating temperatures in order to obtain a uniform red phase. Currently, a study is ongoing to understand the formation mechanism of the red phase and find out the optimal solar cell manufacturing conditions.
Solar cell characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured with a solar simulator (Newport Solar Simulator, model 91160) equipped with a 300 W xenon arc lamp, providing 1000 W m−2 illumination intensity and AM 1.5G spectral distribution, and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated using a certified reference silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). The solar cells were measured at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 and a circular mask was used to define a cell active area of 0.126 cm2. The incident-photon-to-collected-electron efficiency measurements were carried out with a home-made setup comprising of a xenon lamp (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110) and a LabJack U6 data acquisition board. The setup was calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell with a 0.126 cm2 aperture area mask.
Material characterization
Optical microscope images were collected using an Olympus MIC-D digital microscope. The total transmittance and reflectance of the perovskite films were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 double-beam UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere and a Spectralon reflectance standard. The steady-state photoluminescence was measured using a Fluorolog-3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Model FL3-222) instrument. An excitation wavelength of 500 nm was employed and a 460-nm long-pass filter was placed at the excitation monochromator exit slit to cut out transmission of the light from second-order diffraction. The emission signal was automatically corrected to account for the wavelength dependent sensitivity of the instrument, and it was also normalized with a reference cell to account for power fluctuations of the light source. The resulting emission peak signals were fitted using a Voigt profile probability density function (see ESI† for the fitting of raw data). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectra were obtained with a Nicolet Avatar 370 DTGS spectrometer which was fitted with a Smart Performer single-reflection accessory and a flat plate with a ZnSe crystal. Crystallographic properties of the perovskite were studied by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) using a Siemens D5000 θ–2θ diffractometer and employing a parallel-plate Soller-slit collimator (0.3° resolution) with Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation hitting the sample at a grazing incidence angle (θ) of 3°. The instrument was set to the detector scan mode, using the Diffrac plus XRD Commander program, and the diffraction pattern was measured over the Bragg angle (2θ) range of 5° to 60°. Scanning electron microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LEO1550 microscope. The surface morphology of the perovskite films and cross-sections of the solar cells were recorded using an accelerator voltage of 3 kV and 5 kV, respectively.
