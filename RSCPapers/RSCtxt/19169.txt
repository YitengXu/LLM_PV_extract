    , Accepted 24th June 2011First published on 11th August 2011AbstractThe structural, electronic and optical features of two metal-free triphenylamine (TPA) organic dyes (namely C206 and C217) before and after binding to a TiO2 anatase nanoparticle have been investigated in detail, as a model for the corresponding dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The combination of density functional tight-binding (DFTB), density functional theory (DFT), and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) approaches are employed. To understand the effects of the linker part in the TPA organic dyes on the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs, C217 and C206, which share the same donor and anchor parts but different linker parts, are theoretically evaluated. Our results show that compared with C206 containing just one thienothiophene unit as the linker, for C217 the introduction of one electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene group to the linker part results in stronger couplings with the TiO2 conduction band and more efficient electron transfer. This difference contributes to the higher efficiency of C217 in DSSCs experiments. This study is expected to assist the molecular design of new and more efficient TPA-based organic dyes for the optimization of the DSSCs.
1 Introduction
The present energetic and environmental crisis has stimulated more and more attention in the design of renewable energy sources. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), otherwise known as Gräztel cells after their inventor, offer much as a source of affordable renewable energy, and have attracted significant interest as low-cost alternatives to conventional semiconductor photovoltaic devices, since they represent a particularly promising approach to direct conversion of light into electronic energy with high efficiency.1,2 These cells are composed of a wide band gap semiconductor (typically TiO2) deposited on a transparent conducting substrate, quasi-monolayer of light-harvesting dye molecules, and a redox electrolyte. Ruthenium photosensitizers, such as the N3 and N719 compounds, have shown very impressive solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies, reaching 11% at standard AM 1.5 G conditions.3 Taking account of the limited Ru resources and environmental issues, in recent years metal-free organic dyes have attracted increasing interest as the substitute for the Ru complexes, owing to their crucial advantages such as high molar extinction coefficients, low cost, good flexibility in molecular tailoring, and environmental compatibility.4–6 Most notably, when employed in DSSCs, currently top organic dyes demonstrate only slightly lower efficiencies compared to Ru(II) dyes, with record efficiencies up to 10%.7,8 Metal free sensitizers, such as coumarin,9triphenylamine,4perylene,10indoline,11xanthene,12squaraine,13 and merocyanine,14 have been extensively investigated.
Among the metal-free organic dyes, triphenylamine (TPA)-based dyes have displayed prominent light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies in DSSCs.4,5,15–18 The TPA-based dyes, such as C217,7 show a typical donor–π bridge–anchor (D–π–A) structure, in which the lipophilic dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine moiety acts as the electron donor and the hydrophilic cyanoacrylic acid acts as the electron acceptor, while the linker is a binary π-conjugated part. The TPA group is expected to greatly confine the cationic charge from the semiconductor surface and therefore efficiently hamper the charge recombination. The TPA moiety also shows a sizable steric hindrance and can prevent unfavorable dye aggregation at the semiconductor surface. The modifications of TPA-based organic dyes have been intensively investigated.4,5,14–17
With the rapid development of experimental studies of DSSCs, large-scale molecular modeling techniques and especially quantum chemistry calculations have been conducted to offer a competitive alternative for the interpretation of the experimental data. Theoretical calculation methods have also been powerful tools for beforehand molecular designs, and conclusions drawn from calculations are valuable guidelines for the synthesis of new efficient dyes. The state of the art computational methodologies based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can provide accurate geometries, photoexcitation processes, electronic properties, ground- and excited-state oxidation potentials, for various Ru(II) complexes3,19–21 and metal-free organic dyes.22–30 In contrast to the extensive theoretical work on the pure dyes, so far a relatively small number of calculations of organic dyes on a TiO2 surface have been reported,31–44 mainly based on the electronic structure, electron transfer processes, and optical properties on the model systems. Chen and co-workers performed a DFT and TDDFT study of geometry properties, excitations, and electronic structures of triarylamine-based dyes (TC1 and TPAR1) before and after binding to titanium, adopting a simple dye/titanium complex model to simulate the bound states of the investigated dyes.39 And they found that the cyanoacrylic acid anchor favors better photoelectrochemical properties than that of the rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchor. According to the model recently proposed by Chen et al.,39 Preat et al. studied the electronic structures and the photoinduced electron injection properties of some TPA derivatives with bidentate chelating and bidentate bridging modes for the carboxylate unit on TiO2 surface,40,42 by an approximation that the TPA derivatives are connected to one or two Ti atoms.
The experimentally reported D–π–A TPA dyes generally contain TPA derivatives as the donor and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor. Especially Wang's group reported that DSSCs using one of the TPA derivatives, the C217 dye, can have a 9.8% conversion efficiency, which is one of the highest conversion efficiencies among metal free dyes.7 Because the various photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies of those TPA dyes mainly result from the different π-conjugated parts used, a detailed theoretical understanding of the effects of the linker unit in the TPA organic dyes on the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs is greatly desired to design new dyes and improve the performance of DSSC devices. Here we investigate two representative TPA dyes, namely C206 and C217 with different linker units, before and after sensitization to the (TiO2)46 anatase cluster, by performing first principles and tight binding calculations. The effects of the π bridge units in TPA dyes on the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs are investigated in detail.
This paper is organized as the following: Section 1 is the Introduction; Section 2 describes the computational details; Section 3 presents the results and discussion of pure TPA dyes and the TPA dye/(TiO2)46 interface; and the Summary is in Section 4.
2 Computational details
All calculations have been performed with a two-step process: (1) the optimization of the ground state structures by means of DFT or self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) theory,45,46 and (2) the determination of the electronic structures and vertical electronic excitation energies with DFT and TDDFT methods.
For the ground-state geometric optimization of the pure dyes, B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) is selected for the good performance of the geometry optimization of the TPA derivatives.28 For the TDDFT calculations of the pure metal free organic dyes considered in this work, we use the BHandH functional combined with the 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set, which is recently reported to give quite reliable auxochromic shifts when the bulk solvation effects are included in the model.28 A polarizable continuum model (PCM) model47 is used here for evaluating bulk solvent effects. For the organic dye/(TiO2)46 systems with more than 200 atoms, we take advantages of the efficiency of the DFTB method for geometry optimizations, and DFT/TDDFT methods for electronic structure and vertical excitation energies analysis. Specifically, to optimize the structures of the (TiO2)46 nanoparticle and the dye/TiO2 nanoparticle interface, we used a computationally efficient approximation to density functional theory—the SCC-DFTB scheme. The SCC-DFTB model has been derived from a second-order expansion of the DFT total energy functional with respect to charge density fluctuations; at the same time, the Hamiltonian matrix elements are calculated with a two-center approximation. These are then tabulated together with the overlap matrix elements with respect to interatomic distance. A comprehensive description of the method can be found in the literature.45 It has been reported that the DFTB method can predict band structures, geometric parameters, and cohesive energies of anatase polymorphs in good agreement with the reference DFT data and with experiments.48 The full geometric optimizations were performed using the conjugate gradient algorithm until the residual forces were below 5 × 10−4 au; we also set the charge convergence criterion to 10−5 electrons. The DFTB optimized dye/(TiO2)46 nanoparticle was followed by single point electronic structure and vertical electronic excitation analysis, for which we used the hybrid B3LYP (with 20% Hartree–Fock (HF) exact exchange) and BHandH functional (with 50% HF exchange) together with a smaller 3-21G(d) and a widely used 6-31G(d) basis set, as implemented in the GAUSSIAN09 program package.49 The consistency of the results obtained with different codes is always kept under control.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Pure TPA dyes
As a key part of DSSCs, the dyes take the function of light absorption and injection of the photo-excited electrons to the conduction band of the semiconductor, thus they are crucial factors for the solar to electronic energy conversion efficiency. In this section, we focus on the electronic structure of two dyes having triphenylamine-like and cyanoacrylic units as donor and acceptor moieties, selected among the highest-efficiency dyes synthesized so far, namely, the so-termed C206 and C217 reported by the Wang group,7,26 with power conversion efficiencies of 6.5% and 9.8%, respectively. The molecular structures of the C206 and C217 are displayed in Fig. 1. Both molecules show structural similarities, all with a lipophilic dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine as the electron-donor (D) and hydrophilic cyanoacrylic acid as the electron-acceptor (A). The difference between the dyes is the linker with different modifications. For C206, the π linker is a thienothiophene, while for C217, a distinguishable feature is the binary spacer involved: an electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene unit is connected to D, while a thienothiophene group is conjugated with A. For the optimized structures, there is coplanarity between the anchoring group and the bridging unit, which is favorable for the electron transfer.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the C206 and C217 dye sensitizers (C: grey; H: white; O: red; S: yellow; N: blue). 
The frontier orbitals of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dyes are depicted in Fig. 2. The orbitals show similar features. The HOMO of both TPA dyes is mainly populated over the substituted triphenylamine and its adjacent thienothiophene/3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene unit, while the LUMO is delocalized through the cyanoacrylic acid and its adjacent thienothiophene group. This spatial orientation of HOMO and LUMO is an ideal condition for DSSCs. During light excitation, electrons are transferred from the TPA group through the π bridge to the surface-bound cyanoacrylate, thus facilitating strong coupling of the excited state wave function with the Ti(3d,t2g) orbitals, and subsequently favoring the electron injection to the TiO2 matrix. In addition, such orbital photo-excitation features also slow down the recombination of injected electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized dye molecules due to their remoteness.7Fig. 2 also confirms the highly delocalized character of the frontier orbitals, which is a typical feature of cyanine-like systems. Comparing the frontier orbitals features, we found that the introduction of an electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene group in C217 leads to an enhanced π-conjugation across the linker than C206, which will enhance the unidirectional electron flow from the donor moiety to the anchoring acceptor group and improve the electric to intramolecular charge transfer efficiency and the sensitizer performance.

For UV/vis calculations, one of the most popular approaches remains TDDFT, which commonly provides accurate results for a reasonable computational effort, especially when hybrid functionals are used.28,29,50 It has been reported that for some TPA dyes, the BHandH functional gives reliable auxochromic shifts when the bulk solvation effects are included in the model.28 The simulated electronic absorption spectra of C206 and C217 dissolved in chloroform at the PCM-TDBHandH/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory are shown in Fig. 3, and Table 1 lists the excitation energies of the lowest excited state. For the TPA derivatives, experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated that two allowed excited states characterized by large transition probabilities appear in the UV–Vis region.7,17,28 Our simulated results of the dyes show the experimental phenomenon, with a first intense peak in the 400–600 nm region and a second peak close to 300 nm. Table 1 demonstrates that the BHandH functional, combined with the 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set, gives a reliable UV/Vis prediction of TPA absorption spectra when the bulk solvation effects are included in the model. Indeed, our simulations provide excitation energies for the lowest excited state with a deviation of 0.1–0.2 eV from the experiments, and this accuracy is the generally accepted upper limit required for the design of new industrial dyes. Table 1 also confirms that the inclusion of solvation effects will induce smaller excitation energies of the lowest excited state consistent shifts in the measured excitation energies. For both the dyes considered here, chloroform solvation effects result in a red shift of around 0.2 eV, compared with the gas phase dyes.

As presented in Fig. 3, the simulated electronic absorption spectrum of the C217 dye with a 3,4-ethyldioxythiophene unit has one intense visible absorption band centered at 530 nm, which is about 50 nm red-shifted in contrast to C206. The simulated results agree well with the experimental findings. A broad absorption is necessary to attain good overlap with the solar spectrum to produce a large photocurrent response. And it is probably the reason why C217 displays a higher efficiency than C206. Fig. 3 also shows that the charge transfer transition absorption of C217 with the extension of the π-conjugation is larger than that of the shorter π-conjugation of C206. It is very safe to compare experimental data with calculated data for the protonated dyes in chloroform, because deprotonation is quite unlikely to take place in such an apolar solvent.
While in the polar solutions, such as acetonitrile, the possible deprotonation of the terminal cyanoacrylic group should be considered. In Fig. 4, we report the simulated adsorption spectra for both deprotonated dyes in acetonitrile. In line with previous reports,50,51 the deprotonation of the cyanoacrylic moiety leads to a substantial blue shift of the lowest excitation energy. For both dyes considered here, theoretically we predict that the lowest excitation energy of both deprotonated dyes shows an obvious blue shift of around 75 nm, compared with the fully protonated dyes. For the C217 dye, the amount of the blue shift of the lowest excitation energy predicted by the BHandH functional agrees well with Pastore's reports using the MPW1K functional,50 confirming the adequacy of the present models for describing the DSSCs electronic properties.

Experimentally, the C206 dye anchored on a titania film shows a hypsochromic absorption (around 80 nm) compared to that in chloroform.26 Such a blue shift of the absorption spectra has also been observed for other organic dyes.51 It can be interpreted as being partly due to deprotonation of the dyes by adsorption on the TiO2 surface.52 Thus, our TDDFT calculations on the protonated and deprotonated dyes support such a shift in the experimental findings. The other features, such as the relative position of the spectrum peak, are quite similar for fully protonated and deprotonated C206 and C217. We also simulated the adsorption spectra of dye/(TiO2)46 nanoparticles, and found that consistent with the pure TPA dyes, the adsorption spectrum of C217/TiO2 shows an obvious red shift than that of the C206/TiO2. The results of the photoexcitation of the TPA dye/(TiO2)46 systems will be discussed in detail in Section 3.2.
Suitable energy levels and locations of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the dye sensitizer are required to match the iodine/iodide redox potential and the conduction band edge level of the TiO2 semiconductor.51 The highest few occupied and lowest few unoccupied orbitals are of particular interest, as they are involved in the optical transitions, leading to photoinduced electron transfer from the dye to the semiconductor. Fig. 5 depicts the same energy levels of both TPA dyes in acetonitrile at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. It is shown from Fig. 5 that the energy levels of the LUMOs are quite similar, with C217 showing a slightly more negative value. However, the HOMOs are very sensitive to a change in the π-bridge unit. Comparing C206 and C217, adding one electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene unit results in an evident 0.18 eV lift of the HOMO, thus narrowing the HOMO–LUMO gap, and this is consistent with experimental findings.7 We should note that B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level calculations tend to over-estimate the HOMO and LUMO energies, compared to experimental data.7 But the relative energy level position and the HOMO–LUMO gap of C206 and C217 are reasonable and agree with the experimental trend. For both dyes considered here, the simulated LUMOs of both TPA-derived dyes lie above the TiO2 conduction band edge (−4.00 eV vs. vacuum),2 providing the thermodynamic driving force for favorable electron injection from the excited state dye to the TiO2 conduction band edge. Meanwhile the HOMOs of both dyes lie below the iodide redox potential (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum),53 leading to a fast dye regeneration and avoiding the geminate charge recombination between oxidized dye molecules and photo-injected electrons in the nanocrystalline titania film.

Rapid and efficient electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer into the conduction band of the TiO2 is desired for high performance of DSSCs. The energy difference between the excited state oxidation potential of the dye and the TiO2 conduction band edge determines the electron injection rate and therefore the photocurrent in DSSCs. The calculation of the electron injection quantities is important for the interpretation of photovoltaic data. Preat et al. have proposed a theoretical scheme to quantify the electron injection onto a titanium dioxide surface for selected TPA derivatives.28 The free energy change (in eV) for the electron injection can be expressed by the following equation, assuming that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state: (1)where  is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state,  is the reduction potential of the conduction band of the TiO2 ( = 4.0 eV),54 (2) is the redox potential of the ground state. λmax(1) is the absorption energy associated to the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. By using this scheme, we calculated ΔGinject, as well as  and  for both TPA dyes in gas phase and in acetonitrile solution, and the results are listed in Table 2.

If the dye excited state lies below the TiO2 conduction band edge, an unfavorable electron injection can be predicted, thus excluding the considered dye. We found from Table 2 that all the ΔGinject calculated are very negative (<−0.74 eV), which means that the dye excited state lies above the TiO2 conduction band edge, favoring the injection of the electron from the excited state dye to the TiO2 conduction band edge. It can also be found that gas phase has a much smaller ΔGinject than the solvent phase, which means that the dielectric surroundings have a great effect on the ΔGinject value, with a shift of −0.9 to −1.0 eV when going from gas to CH3CN. As expected, the main solvent effect results in a stabilization of the oxidized dye and favors the electron injection. Although C206 shows a slightly more negative ΔGinject than C217, basically the values are similar.
3.2 TPA dyes on TiO2 surface
The structure as well as the precise nature of the electronic excited states of the organic dye/semiconductor interface determines the efficiency of the electron injection from the excited state dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor. Theoretical studies of the dye/TiO2 interacting system represent an important step towards the optimization of DSSCs. These studies require effective and accurate simulations of the electronic and optical properties of TiO2 nanoparticles and the dye excited states. In this section, we seek to obtain detailed insight into the interactions between the dye and the semiconductor surface, by combination of tight-binding and first principles calculations on the TPA dye/(TiO2)46 nanoparticle systems. We take advantage of the efficiency of the DFTB method for geometry optimizations, and DFT/TDDFT methods for electronic structure and optical properties simulations.
To model the TiO2 nanoparticle, we used a (TiO2)46 nanocluster, obtained by appropriately ‘cutting’ an anatase slab exposing the majority (1 0 1) surface.55 The considered (TiO2)46 nanocluster represents a good trade-off between accuracy and computational convenience and nicely reproduces the main electronic characteristics of the TiO2 nanoparticle. Indeed, for the (TiO2)46 nanocluster considered, a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.78 eV is computed by the B3LYP/6-31G(d)//DFTB method. The lowest transition of the (TiO2)46 cluster calculated is 3.19 eV, in good agreement with previous reports of small TiO2 clusters56 and the experimental band gaps typical of TiO2 nanoparticles of a few nm size (3.2–3.3 eV),57 confirming the adequacy of the present theoretical models for describing the TiO2 electronic properties.
We now turn to the adsorption geometry of the C206 and C217 dyes on the TiO2 surface. There are two possible adsorption modes on TiO2, corresponding to monodentate binding through a single carboxylic oxygen and to bidentate binding with proton transfer to a nearby surface oxygen. As found for related organic dyes,36 the bidentate adsorption mode of the carboxylic oxygen atoms to penta-coordinated surface Ti atoms is largely energetically favored compared to the monodentate one. Therefore, we only consider the bidentate adsorption mode in this paper. Fig. 6 shows the C217/(TiO2)46 cluster optimized by the DFTB method. After adsorption to the (TiO2)46 cluster, the C217 dye almost maintains its structure, except for the anchoring group. While for the (TiO2)46 cluster, the formation of two additional Ti–O bonds, together with the binding of one hydrogen atom to the TiO2 surface oxygen atom, leads to considerable rearrangements of the surface structures. As elsewhere reported for some organic dyes,36,58 the interaction between the dyes and the TiO2 surface is rather strong, with average calculated distances between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the TiO2 surface (O–Ti bond) of 2.0–2.1 Å. Our simulations demonstrate that the average O–Ti bond distance of C217/TiO2 is slightly shorter than that of C206/TiO2 system, indicating stronger interactions between the C217 dye and TiO2 surface and probably stronger electronic coupling.
 Fig. 6  Optimized geometry of a bidentate binding mode of C217 on the (TiO2)46 nanoparticle. 
For a better understanding of the electronic coupling strength between the dye's LUMO and the semiconductor conduction band and the electron transfer features during light excitation, we analyzed the energy levels for the interacting and non-interacting species of the C217 dye and (TiO2)46 nanocluster, as represented in Fig. 7. We also drew the selective isosurfaces of the dye and dye/TiO2 system, including the HOMO, LUMO and the interacting orbitals, as shown in the insets. We found from Fig. 7 that (1) the HOMO of C217 is almost unaffected by interaction with TiO2, inserting within the TiO2 band gap and showing the alignment of the energy levels as in the non-interacting case. (2) The most noticeable difference between the isolated and interacting systems is in the position and character of the LUMOs. Consistent with previous reports of the perylene dye and (TiO2)38 cluster,37 after adsorption to the TiO2 surface, the dye LUMO will decrease due to the interaction with TiO2. The C217 LUMO is 0.6 eV lower after binding to the TiO2 surface. While for the C206/TiO2 system, the lower-lying LUMO is calculated to be a smaller 0.4 eV (shown in Fig. S1), indicating less strong electronic coupling to the TiO2 surface than the C217/TiO2 complex. Shown from the isosurfaces in Fig. 7, there is strong interaction between the LUMO of the C217 and the TiO2 conduction band, composed by a mixture of dye and TiO2 conduction band states. (3) The TiO2 nanoparticle has a reasonably well-developed band structure, with a valence band, a wide band gap, and conduction band structure. The TiO2 energy levels changed slightly by dye adsorption. (4) The C217 dye introduces some occupied levels in the TiO2 band gap. The HOMO level of the interacting system corresponds to the HOMO of the free C217, and is entirely localized on the adsorbate C217. For the pure protonated C217 dye, the HOMO–LUMO gap is 2.00 eV at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)//DFTB level of theory (2.13 eV at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory). While for the C217/TiO2 interacting system, the HOMO–LUMO gap of the dye/TiO2 system is 0.92 eV at B3LYP/6-31G(d)//DFTB level, which is much smaller than the gap of the pure C217 dye. By comparing the HOMO–LUMO gaps, we can expect that the optical absorption for the C217/TiO2 system is red shifted in comparison to that of C217, which is confirmed by the following TDDFT calculations. For C206, similar results are received. (5) For the C217/(TiO2)46 system, the dye LUMO level has no coupling to the TiO2 conduction band edge. The interacting LUMO orbitals that have non-negligible contributions from the free dye LUMO are situated higher up in the conduction band (LUMO + 20), as demonstrated in the isosurfaces. The interacting orbital shows strong mixing of the adsorbate π* and TiO2 3d orbitals. While for the C206/TiO2 system (shown in Fig. S1), the interacting orbitals lie much higher in the conduction band. Therefore, the π linker unit of similar TPA dyes shows evident effects on the electronic properties. The introduction of one electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene group in C217 results in stronger couplings with the TiO2 surface. The electronic coupling strength between the dye's LUMO and the semiconductor conduction band is a decisive factor for an efficient electron injection from the dye onto the semiconductor surface. From this respect, we conclude that the introduction of one electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene group contributes to the higher efficiency of C217 in the DSSC experiments.

To gain deeper insights into the character of the excited states of the dye/(TiO2)46 systems, we then performed TDDFT calculations on the interacting systems. For the organic dyes/TiO2 system, the reliable calculations of excitation energies still present some difficulties and remain an open issue. Due to the complexity of the organic dye/TiO2 interacting systems under investigation and the large dimensions of the systems to be studied (more than 200 atoms), the possibility of using high-level TDDFT calculations is ruled out. To avoid highly time-demanding computational expense, and meanwhile maintain reliable description of the dye/TiO2 interatomic interactions, it is very important to choose the right functional and basis set.
For the functional, Section 3.1 has demonstrated that the hybrid functional BHandH with 50% HF exchange can predict reliable UV/Vis spectra for those TPA dyes. However, we should point out that for the (TiO2)46 nanoparticle, at the BHandH/6-31G(d) level, the lowest excitation energy is overestimated to be 4.2 eV, with an estimate of 0.9 eV deviation from the experimental data. We notice that the overestimate of the TD gap for the (TiO2)46 nanoparticle was also found previously.55 Although this functional can not give a proper description of the optical threshold of the TiO2 substrate, nevertheless, we found that the overall shape of the TDDFT absorption spectrum shows a very low intensity in the visible region and makes this model still reliable in the description of a realistic dye/TiO2 substrate. The B3LYP hybrid functional is a widely used functional that has previously been shown to perform well in describing the electronic structure of TiO2.59 It has been reported that the B3LYP hybrid functional with a 3-21G(d) basis set can predict reliable electronic and optical properties of TiO2 nanoclusters.60 However, for the TPA derivatives, the B3LYP will underestimate the lowest excitation energy.28 Xu and co-workers studied the UV/Vis spectrum of the TC1 dye at the TDB3LYP/6-31G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory, and they obtained an error close to 0.64 eV for λmax(1).17 For C217 in CHCl3, our calculations show that the lowest excitation energies at the TDB3LYP/6-31G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and TDB3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels of theory are 1.76 eV and 1.74 eV, respectively, both deviated 0.5 eV from the experimental main adsorption. And such an error is beyond the general deviation for organic dyes of 0.4 eV, therefore the B3LYP functional is not selected as the TD functional in the investigation of the optical properties for organic dyes, as well as the dye/TiO2 systems. We also stress that we are interested here in relative adsorption spectrum positions of both dye/TiO2 systems and the relative spectral shifts of the dyes upon binding to the TiO2 surface, rather than in absolutely reproducing excitation energies. Weighing the pros and cons connected with the two functionals, we choose the BHandH functional to calculate the optical properties of the dye/(TiO2)46 systems.
A smaller basis set of 3-21G(d) and a popular used 6-31G(d) are chosen to calculate the adsorption spectrum. The small 3-21G(d) basis set has been used to study the excited state properties of some Ru dyes/TiO2 systems, and reliable results with experiments have been received.60,61 And for the organic dyes, our calculations show that the basis set 3-21G(d) is still good for prediction of the adsorption spectrum. For example, based on the C217 structure optimized by the DFTB method, BHandH/6-31G(d) and BHandH/3-21G(d) predict the lowest excitation energy to be 2.29 eV and 2.40 eV, respectively, both consistent with the experimental data of 2.25 eV.7 The larger basis set 6-31G(d) will give more accurate data to model the dyes. For the dye/TiO2 cluster, our calculations show that the dependence of the adsorption spectrum on the basis set has been very small. For example, for C206/TiO2 system, the main excitations predicted by BHandH/3-21G(d)//DFTB and BHandH/6-31G(d)//DFTB are both around 2.5 eV, respectively, both agree with the experimental adsorption peak around 2.9 eV, confirming the adequacy of the present basis sets for describing the DSSCs’ optical properties.
The calculated absorption spectra for both fully protonated TPA dyes adsorbed on TiO2 are reported in Fig. 8, where the UV–Vis peak half-width at half height is 0.33 eV. As has been mentioned above, for C206/TiO2 system, the main excitation predicted by BHandH/6-31G(d)//DFTB is 2.48 eV. Experimentally, the C206 dye anchored on a titania film shows a hypsochromic absorption (around 80 nm) compared to that of the pure dye in chloroform.26 The blue shift of the adsorption peak can be interpreted partly due to deprotonation of the dyes by adsorption on the TiO2 surface.52 We also simulated the deprotonated C206/(TiO2)46 complex, and the main excitation predicted by BHandH/6-31G(d)//DFTB is 2.79 eV, consistent with the experimental adsorption peak around 2.9 eV.26 Similar to the feature of adsorption spectra of the pure dyes, the adsorption peak of C217/TiO2 shows an obvious red shift of 65 nm to that of C206/TiO2, which is probably responsible for the better performance of C217 in DSSCs. Our calculations show that when the TPA dyes are adsorbed on a TiO2 cluster, the spectrum is broadened and the absorption peak is red shifted by about 0.1–0.2 eV, reflecting the stronger interaction of the dye with the semiconductor. Such findings are similar to the organic perylene dye and squaraine dye adsorption to TiO2 surface.37,38 In addition, the simulated broadness of the main peak and the absence of the smaller peak around 300 nm for the TPA dye/TiO2 system agree with the experimental findings.26 As we know, a broad absorption is necessary to attain good overlap with the solar spectrum to produce a large photocurrent response. For both the pure dye and dye/TiO2 system, C217 demonstrates obvious broader and red-shifted adsorption spectrum, and it is probably the reason why C217 displays higher efficiency than C206 in experiments.

The above analysis has demonstrated that the combination of tight binding and first principles approaches predicted reliable geometry properties, electronic structures, and photoexcitations of the TPA dyes/(TiO2)46 interface. Our calculations successfully demonstrated the effects of the π linker on the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs, agreeing very well with the corresponding experiments. The proposed theoretical approaches allow for beforehand molecular design of new efficient dyes for industrial interest.
Generally, some principles to construct efficient dye sensitizers and good performance DSSCs are as follows:40,62 (1) The absorption range of the dye should cover the whole visible and some of the near-infrared region, and its molar extinction coefficient must be large enough to get a substantial photocurrent. (2) The HOMO of the dye should lie below the energy level of the redox mediator to allow an efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye. (3) The LUMO of the dye should be localized near the anchoring group and has to be higher in energy than the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, for efficient electron injection into the anode. (4) A good conjugation across the donor and anchoring group is needed, as it determines the large photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer amplitude. (5) The electronic coupling between the dye's LUMO and the semiconductor conduction band should be strong, for an efficient electron injection from the dye onto the semiconductor surface. The metal-free TPA based dyes have demonstrated prominent light-to-electrical performance with record efficiencies up to 10%.7,8 It is expected that the DSSCs efficiency could be further improved through the exploration of new TPA sensitizers with a good spectral match with the solar emission. Catching up with the high performance of ruthenium dyes, the TPA dyes are very promising for the coming large-scale practical applications of DSSCs in the future, if their efficiency and stability can be considerably improved. The currently reported TPA dyes adopt the TPA derivatives and the cyanoacetic acid moiety as electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively, but the linker parts are different. As demonstrated in this work and other experimental investigations,7,8,26 a structural change of the linker unit will affect the above five parameters and the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs. In this respect, for the molecular engineering of organic TPA chromophores, we believe that future efforts should be directed to the appropriate structural modifications of the linker part, so that the above five properties can be further optimized.
4 Conclusions
By utilizing DFTB, DFT, and TDDFT methods, we have performed a detailed theoretical investigation of the geometry properties, electronic structures, and photoexcitations of two organic TPA dyes before and after binding to a (TiO2)46 anatase nanocluster, to understand the effects of the linker unit in the TPA dyes on the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs. The C206 and C217 dyes share the same donor and acceptor parts but quite different solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies, thus the linker effects should be evaluated, for a better understanding of their performance in DSSCs. Our results demonstrated that the linker parts have great effects on the electronic and optical properties of the TPA dyes and the efficiency of the DSSCs. Compared with C206 having just one thienothiophene as the π linker, for C217 the introduction of one electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene group results in a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap, a red-shifted adsorption spectrum with higher extinction coefficients, stronger couplings with the TiO2 surface, and more efficient electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band, therefore contributing to the higher efficiency of C217 in DSSC experiments. Clear insights into the adsorption and photoexcitation features of the TPA dye/titanium dioxide interface were also demonstrated in the present work. The simulated results show very good agreement with available experimental data, demonstrating the accuracy of the theoretical approaches presented here. Our theoretical work is expected to shed light on the future molecular design of more efficient TPA sensitizers for solar cell applications.
