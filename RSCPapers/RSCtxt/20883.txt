For instance, knowledge of the mechanical and thermal stability of thin film organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical for the roll-to-roll production of photovoltaic devices and their use under various operating conditions. Here, we examine the thermal and elasto-mechanical properties of the conjugated donor polymer poly-(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the interpenetrating mixtures of P3HT and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl (PCBM) ester bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers under the application of unidirectional tensile deformation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. The predictions are validated against previous experimental reports as well as with earlier modeling results derived using different intermolecular force fields. Our results reveal that PCBM molecules behave as anti-plasticizers when mixed with P3HT and tend to increase the tensile modulus and glass transition temperature, while decreasing the crack-onset strain relative to pure P3HT. The variations in the mechanical properties with the composition of the BHJ active layer suggest that, in the presence of small oligomers as additives in the BHJ, the P3HT:PCBM mixture resists the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM molecules due to the low tensile modulus of the short polymer chains.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) materials have contributed to the considerable advances that have been made towards carbon-free clean energy conversion.1,2 Amongst them, organic solar cells (OSCs) are attractive due to their low-temperature solution processability, light weight and device flexibility.3–5 OSCs consisting of an interpenetrating mixture of electron donors (e.g., semiconducting polymers) and electron acceptor (e.g., fullerene) photoactive layers, a.k.a. bulk heterojunction (BHJ), exhibit the most promising morphologies due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE).6 Nevertheless, extensive research over the past decade has increased the PCE of OSCs with BHJ architectures to a paltry ∼10%,7–9 while a recent effort reports that a tandem structure composed of double BHJs enhances the PCE up to 15%.10 PCE depends on the morphology of BHJ and intermolecular interactions of the active layer constituents,11,12 and numerous studies have probed the correlations between the BHJ structure, properties and performance.13–18
On the other side of the coin, organic semiconductors, being mechanically compliant and thermally stable, hold the potential for designing lightweight, portable and flexible OSC devices.19–22 Despite several experimental23–28 and computational investigations29–31 to understand the effect of processing parameters on the morphology and performance of OSCs, there still remains a gap in the understanding of how these factors affect the thermo- and elasto-mechanical properties of these energy conversion devices. To bridge the space between experimental measurements and predictions from atomistic simulations, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) can be used to examine the thermomechanical properties of polymeric systems.32 CGMD simulations are able to simulate larger system sizes for longer times approaching experimental scales. Here, we present results from CGMD simulations of a representative solvent-free mixture of poly-(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) and the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl (PCBM) ester that compose the BHJ morphology. Thermally annealed pure P3HT and P3HT:PCBM BHJ morphologies are subjected to unidirectional tensile strains to scrutinize the stress–strain behavior. We find that while the simulation results for elastic modulus, density and glass transition temperature (Tg) agree with prior experimental reports, the addition of oligomers decreases the tensile modulus and Tg due to the plasticizing effect of the small polymer molecules.
2. Computational methods
P3HT, PCBM and chlorobenzene (CB) molecules are modeled using the coarse-grained beads as described by the Martini force field13,33 extended to polymers and fullerene and benzene rings.34–36 The typical force field parameters are adopted from ref. 13. Although the CG model resolution can affect the calculated elastic properties, predictions of the tensile modulus and density of P3HT and the P3HT:PCBM BHJ from the three-site model15 are found to concur with experiments.29 We use the improved Martini force field that considers a finer CG mapping relative to earlier approaches while retaining certain chemical specificity, such as the anisotropy of the thiophene backbone ring.13 The computational procedure to mimic a typical spin-coating process to prepare the P3HT:PCBM BHJ structure is adopted from ref. 13 and 53 and is described in detail in our earlier reports17,18,37 as well as in the ESI.† Nonequilibrium (NE-CGMD) simulations are used by introducing a constant velocity of deformation (∼1 × 10−4 nm ps−1) along the longitudinal (x-)direction to simulate unidirectional tension as illustrated in Fig. 1. Our choice of deformation velocity, corresponding to a strain rate of ∼1 × 10−5 ps−1, is necessitated by the lowest achievable strain rate given the time scale in CGMD simulations.
 Fig. 1  Simulated unidirectional tension of the thermally annealed P3HT:PCBM BHJ morphology (P3HT is represented by red beads and PCBM is represented by blue beads) at a constant deformation velocity of 1 × 10−4 nm ps−1. The high strain (up to 100%) used in our CGMD simulations is to compensate for the differences in the associated time and length scales (minutes in experiments compared to microseconds in CGMD simulations). Additionally, the inherent rigidity of the CG force field due to low degrees of freedom is compensated for by the high velocity of deformation.13 
While the constant velocity of the deformation boundary condition is imposed along the longitudinal direction, constant pressure conditions (1 atm. pressure under a Parrinello–Rahman barostat with 10−15 s−1 as the coupling constant) are applied along the transverse boundaries (y- and z-directions). GROMACS 2019.438 is used for all the CGMD simulations and VMD 1.8.2 (Visual Molecular Dynamics)39 for the visualization of the molecular structures. The stress–strain distribution, as presented in Fig. 2(a), is derived from the moving average calculations (sampled every 20 ps) of the pxx component of the pressure tensor. Tensile (Young's) modulus is calculated from the slope of the linear region of the stress–strain curve (Fig. 2(a)). Glass transition temperature, Tg, is determined by fitting two straight lines to the two distinct linear regimes of the density profile during thermal quenching, which is performed by gradually decreasing the temperature of the simulation box, as shown in Fig. 2(b).

Tensile modulus (in GPa) is calculated from the slope of the linear part of the stress–strain curve. (b) Density as a function of temperature during the thermal quenching of the pure P3HT polymer. Glass transition temperature (Tg) is calculated from the change in the slope of the density profile. Tg = 281.44 K is found for 120-mer P3HT which is highlighted in gray. 
Morphological characterization
The computed morphology of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ is discretized into small cubes of dimensions ∼0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 nm3 (a.k.a. voxels) consistent with the CG bead diameter of P3HT and PCBM inside the simulation box. Initially, the numbers of P3HT and PCBM beads inside each voxel are calculated and assigned with binary values (1 or 0) based on the type of beads inside the respective voxel. Fig. S2 in the ESI† presents the BHJ morphology for a 1.0:0.8 weight ratio of P3HT:PCBM along with the corresponding discretization sampled along the x–y plane. Exciton diffusion, charge dissociation and charge transport in BHJ layers depend on three key morphological features, viz., average domain size, interfacial area and percolation ratio.15 These features are calculated from the volume occupied by each phase (P3HT or PCBM), total surface area of adjacent voxels containing P3HT and PCBM molecules, and the fraction of P3HT (or PCBM) voxels that create a continuous path to the surface (i.e., the electrodes). Herman's orientation factors (fi)40,41 for individual P3HT chains in pure P3HT and P3HT:PCBM BHJ morphologies are calculated to characterize the bond orientation of polymers in the bulk morphology by using 2nd order Legendre polynomials denoted as  where  In the equation,41θj denotes the angle between the jth backbone bond of the ith polymer and the x-axis (for P3HT chain alignment in the longitudinal direction) and Bi denotes the total number of bonds in the backbone of the ith P3HT chain. The orientation parameter (f) is finally computed by sampling fi over all the P3HT molecules. The overall orientation factor f can take a value between −0.5 and 1.0 as mentioned above. When f ∼ −0.5 all chains are aligned perpendicular to the axis in consideration (x-axis), when f ∼ 1.0 all chains completely aligned with the x-axis, and when f ∼ 0 the system has no preferential orientation in any direction and hence indicates an isotropic nature of the phase.
Exciton diffusion to charge transport probability (P)
Since charge dissociation occurs at the P3HT:PCBM interface, a correlation between exciton diffusion, charge dissociation and charge transport probability can provide an insight into the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ. Inspired by the microscopic equation for the IPCE (incident photon to converted electron) ratio, developed in our earlier effort,42 we define exciton diffusion to charge transport probability (P) which correlates three dominant morphological features such as domain size, interfacial area to volume ratio and percolation ratio. Assuming that all the solar energy absorbed by both donor and acceptor phases can generate excitons, the exciton diffusion to charge transport probability is denoted as P = Pdiff × Pdiss × Pperc, where the probability of exciton diffusion is  the probability of charge dissociation is  and the probability of charge transport is  These probabilities, in accordance with the morphological characterization discussed in the previous section, are calculated under the assumption of a finite element scheme by counting individual events (viz. exciton diffusion, dissociation and charge transport) for each small voxel (∼0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 nm3) followed by the summation of all individual contributions as shown in the equations. Aint and tint are the interfacial area and interface thickness, respectively; Vbox is the volume of the simulation box and Nbox is the number of voxels after discretizing the simulation box by a finite element scheme.16,37PP3HT and PPCBM are the corresponding percolation ratios of the P3HT and PCBM phases, while d, SA and SC are the shortest distances that an exciton needs to travel until it reaches an interface, that a hole needs to travel to reach the anode, and that an electron needs to travel to reach the cathode, respectively. According to the methods implemented in an earlier effort,42 under the current discretization scheme each of these parameters is calculated for each voxel to calculate the probability for the 3D microstructure. Finally, εexciton, εh and εe are the properties of the donor and acceptor materials known as diffusion lengths of the exciton, holes and electrons, respectively. Table 1 lists all the properties for the P3HT:PCBM morphology considered in this work.

3. Results and discussion
We perform CGMD simulations of solvent evaporation and thermal annealing of the bulk morphology with pure P3HT molecules (the chain lengths of 48-mer and 120-mer are considered). The density of 120-mer P3HT is calculated as ∼0.99392 g cm−3, which reasonably agrees with earlier experiments (∼1.09 g cm−3).23

Table 2 compares different thermomechanical properties predicted from CGMD simulations against the corresponding experimental results.23,45 Glass transition temperature and tensile modulus, obtained from CGMD, concur with the experiments, thereby validating our choice of force field used in the present work. From the mechanical response and the corresponding calculation of Young's modulus, 120-mer P3HT can be inferred to have a significantly large mechanical strength, leading to a relatively stiffer material. Although failure due to chain pulling can be observed for 48-mer P3HT at a strain of >200%, 120-mer P3HT does not demonstrate any onset of crack failure for the range of strain rates considered in our simulations (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). It is important to note that experimentally the crack onset occurs at a strain of ∼2% for P3HT:PCBM,46 and the absence of a crack in our simulations can be attributed to the nonexistence of interfacial impurities (e.g., defects at the surface) that typically initiate cracks in the corresponding microstructures, as also discussed in earlier computational efforts.29 We assume periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in three directions which ignore any surface and interfacial effect including surface induced cracks affecting the mechanical response of the bulk morphology. Fig. 3(c) presents the stress–strain behavior of P3HT for different degrees of polymerization, i.e., 48-mer (blue) and 120-mer (red). Due to the crack failure of 48-mer P3HT at a strain of >200%, the stress is reduced to ∼0 GPa as observed in Fig. 3(c). The variation in the orientation parameter as a function of the applied strain (Fig. 3(d)) reveals an increased alignment of the polymer chains (48-mer P3HT) along the direction of strain, which eventually leads to failure due to the pulling of the chain at a high strain rate, as noted in Fig. 3(a).

Effect of the PCBM weight fraction
We inspect the effect of PCBM as an acceptor material on the thermomechanical stability of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ active layer. P3HT:PCBM based BHJs are one of the most studied and well understood systems for OSC device applications.47 Solution processing parameters such as the weight ratio of constituent materials, the degree of polymerization, the polydispersity of P3HT molecules and annealing temperature are known to affect the performance, morphology and thermomechanical stability of the BHJ layer. Research efforts in the past decade revealed the weight fraction of PCBM to be one of the most dominant design variables affecting the PCE of the OSC device.48–50 Here, we investigate the effect of the PCBM weight fraction on the mechanical properties of the BHJ active layers, and the results are reproduced in Fig. 4. P3HT:PCBM BHJ active layers with different weight ratios of the constituent donor and acceptor materials are simulated from a ternary mixture of P3HT:PCBM solvated in CB followed by the thermal annealing of solvent-free P3HT:PCBM, as described in the Methods section as well as in the ESI.† The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the mixture is calculated from the change in density as a function of temperature during the thermal quenching of the system (Fig. 2(a)). Fig. 4(a) reveals a significant increase in Tg, which is in agreement with the previous experimental result,45 when PCBM is added as an acceptor material. Tg corresponds to the temperature at which the transition from an amorphous glassy phase to a liquid-like polymer-melt phase occurs. Knowledge of thermal properties related to glass transition is crucial for OSC applications as the aforementioned phase transition at a temperature of ∼Tg is closely related to the choice of annealing temperature that determines the efficiency of OSC devices.18 We find Tg for a 1.0:1.0 weight ratio of P3HT:PCBM to be ∼337 K. Glass transition for a range of PCBM weight fractions (∼33–66% of PCBM mass loading) is predicted to occur between 293 and 350 K. As thermal annealing is a post-evaporation step to achieve efficient BHJ microstructures by molecular rearrangements from a quasi-stable non-equilibrium morphology to a stable morphology, annealing temperature should always be maintained above the glass transition temperature, Tg. We determine the tensile modulus and stress–strain behavior of thermally annealed P3HT:PCBM mixtures as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), respectively. The PCBM addition leads to a stiffer material with a larger tensile modulus, indicating the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM. Fig. 4(d) shows a trade-off between the efficiency of BHJ layers quantified by exciton generation to charge transport probability (hereafter referred to simply as ‘efficiency’) and the tensile modulus of different P3HT:PCBM compositions. Higher efficiency is obtained for P3HT:PCBM with a weight ratio of ∼1.0:0.8, in agreement with our recent effort on understanding the effect of solution processing parameters on the BHJ morphology.18Fig. 4(d) reveals that PCBM with a mass loading of >50% can have an adverse effect due to the inherent brittleness introduced by PCBM along with a significant reduction in the efficiency. In light of the results presented in Fig. 4(d), a weight fraction of PCBM between 40 and 50% is concluded to be the most promising due to the relatively high efficiency and flexibility of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ mixtures.
 Fig. 4  (a) Glass transition temperature (Tg) as a function of the PCBM weight fraction. The predicted trend of increasing Tg with increasing PCBM in the BHJ agrees with previous experimental results.45 (b) Tensile modulus as a function of the PCBM weight fraction. The addition of PCBM increases the tensile modulus of the BHJ layer, indicating the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM molecules. (c) Stress–strain response for different P3HT:PCBM weight ratios. An increase in the slope of the linear region of the stress–strain curve reveals that the BHJ becomes stiffer due to the PCBM addition. (d) Exciton diffusion to charge transport probability as a function of tensile modulus for different P3HT:PCBM weight ratios. A 1.0:0.8 weight ratio is found to have the highest probability with a relatively low tensile modulus, indicating an optimum morphology for a flexible OSC active layer. 
Effect of a small molecule additive
Low molecular weight conjugated donor polymers (often known as oligomers), such as P3HT with a chain length of <10, can significantly modify the morphology of P3HT:PCBM BHJs, thus affecting their mechanical as well as charge transport properties. Carrillo et al.51 reported the beneficial effects of oligomeric additive insertions in improving the efficiencies of BHJ morphologies. The enhanced performance was attributed to the significant increase in the effective domain size and interfacial area due to the accumulation of small oligomer molecules at the interface between P3HT and PCBM. We simulate BHJs with P3HT oligomers (8-mer) as an additive to examine the thermomechanical response of the mixture. P3HT:PCBM:Oligomer ternary mixtures are prepared following the abovementioned two-step thin film synthesis following the solvent evaporation and thermal annealing protocols.

Fig. 5(a) presents the variations in Tg as a function of oligomer mass loading (the weight fraction of oligomers in the ternary composite system). A gradual decrease in Tg (∼268 K) with an increase in oligomer mass loading implies the plasticizing effect of the oligomers in the BHJ. The plasticizing effect of oligomers contrasts partially with the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM molecules due to the low Tg value of P3HT with chain lengths shorter than 10-mer.52 The predicted reduction in Tg for the P3HT:PCBM BHJ in the presence of oligomer additives potentially contributes to an inherently unstable morphology for a broad range of operating temperatures, up to ∼350 K. Despite the anticipated benefits of additive insertion, the morphological instability of the BHJ active layer in the presence of oligomer additives can lead to performance degradation. Additionally, tensile modulus is also predicted to decrease significantly due to the presence of oligomers, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). This behavior can be attributed to the higher miscibility of P3HT oligomers (due to their low molecular weight) in the composite system as opposed to the miscibility of longer chains of P3HT in PCBM, as also discussed in our earlier effort.17 P3HT with a chain length <48 usually exhibits higher miscibility with PCBM for the weight ratio of 1.0:0.8, facilitating an increase in the amorphous mixed phase consisting of P3HT and PCBM. The P3HT:PCBM:Oligomer system under investigation is considered to be equivalent to a polydisperse system of P3HT:PCBM with a bimodal distribution. Furthermore in our previous computational effort to investigate the polydisperse P3HT:PCBM BHJ37 we concluded an increase in the intermixing of small chains of P3HT molecules at the P3HT:PCBM interfaces. To explain the effect of enhanced miscibility, we compute the orientation parameters (both the longitudinal and transverse components) as a function of the oligomer mass loading, as presented in Fig. 6(a). The overall alignment of the P3HT phase significantly reduces (f ∼ 0) upon the addition of oligomers indicating enhanced intermixing and higher miscibility. The overall decrease in orientation (isotropic) due to oligomeric inclusion indicates the loss of local molecular arrangements (semi-crystalline order) which is also responsible for the loss of efficiency beyond a mass loading of the oligomer (∼5%). The trade-off between the computed efficiency and the tensile modulus of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ as a function of oligomer mass loading is shown in Fig. 5(d). An enhanced efficiency is obtained upon the addition of oligomer molecules, especially when the mass loading is ∼5%. The increase in efficiency with a corresponding increase in oligomer mass loading, also reported by Carrillo et al. in their recent work,51 is also explained by the interfacial area to volume ratio (IAVR) (nm−1), illustrated in Fig. 6(b). The highest efficiency of the BHJ morphology with a 5% mass loading of oligomers is attributed to the balance between miscibility (denoted by orientation) and the highest IAVR. Despite the enhanced flexibility due to a reduction in the anti-plasticizing effect, the oligomeric insertion beyond 5% into the BHJ morphology demonstrates an inefficient energy conversion capability (Fig. 5(d)) along with an inherent thermo-mechanical instability (Fig. 5(a)). Based on the findings presented in Fig. 5, the insertion of oligomers ≤5% is concluded to be beneficial due to the significantly high efficiency and flexibility of the final morphology.
 Fig. 5  (a) Glass transition temperature (Tg) as a function of the weight percent of the oligomer additive (8-mer P3HT). Tg decreases to ∼268 K for 20% oligomer additives, indicating the plasticizing effect of oligomers. (b) Tensile modulus for different oligomer additive contents in the 1.0:0.8 P3HT:PCBM BHJ. A decrease in tensile modulus can be attributed to the decrease in entanglement density due to small molecule inclusions. (c) Stress–strain response for different oligomer mass loadings. The visual inspection reveals a decrease in the tensile modulus due to the presence of oligomer additives. (d) Exciton generation to charge transport probability as a function of the tensile modulus for various weight percentages of oligomers. The anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM is reduced due to the oligomer inclusions as the tensile modulus decreases with the increasing oligomer fraction. The addition of ∼5% oligomers can be beneficial due to a significant increase in efficiency in addition to the decrease in tensile modulus. However, the decrease in glass transition temperature below room temperature can lead to an unstable morphology at operating temperatures >300 K.

Effective orientation along the longitudinal direction is reduced due to oligomer insertion. (b) Interfacial area to volume ratio (IAVR) as a function of the oligomer additive weight fraction (%). An increase in effective IAVR is responsible for the increase in efficiency (exciton generation to charge transport probability). 
4. Conclusion
In summary, CGMD simulations are used to investigate the thermo- and elasto-mechanical properties of P3HT:PCBM BHJ systems typically used in OSC devices. The glass transition temperature and stress–strain behavior of pure P3HT polymers with different chain lengths are found to have an excellent agreement with previous experimental reports. The introduction of PCBM as an acceptor material is observed to increase both glass transition temperature and tensile modulus, indicating the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM. This behavior is attributed to the significantly high glass transition temperature of pure PCBM, leading to a stiffer material at room temperature upon annealing. The BHJ mixture with an ∼1.0:0.8 P3HT:PCBM weight ratio is found to have the highest exciton generation to charge transport probability (efficiency) as well as a relatively flexible morphology. A small chain length of P3HT, on the other hand, exhibits a lower glass transition temperature and assumes lower values of tensile modulus. The addition of small oligomer molecules in the BHJ thus partially limits the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM. Despite the increase in the efficiency of BHJ devices in the presence of oligomer additives, the morphological instability due to a low glass transition temperature is anticipated to degrade the performance of OSCs over long periods of time at considerably higher operating temperatures above its glass transition temperature.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Simulated unidirectional tension of the thermally annealed P3HT:PCBM BHJ morphology (P3HT is represented by red beads and PCBM is represented by blue beads) at a constant deformation velocity of 1 × 10−4 nm ps−1. The high strain (up to 100%) used in our CGMD simulations is to compensate for the differences in the associated time and length scales (minutes in experiments compared to microseconds in CGMD simulations). Additionally, the inherent rigidity of the CG force field due to low degrees of freedom is compensated for by the high velocity of deformation.13	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Stress as a function of strain (along the x-direction) during the unidirectional straining of the thermally annealed P3HT:PCBM BHJ. Tensile modulus (in GPa) is calculated from the slope of the linear part of the stress–strain curve. (b) Density as a function of temperature during the thermal quenching of the pure P3HT polymer. Glass transition temperature (Tg) is calculated from the change in the slope of the density profile. Tg = 281.44 K is found for 120-mer P3HT which is highlighted in gray.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Visual inspection of the P3HT polymer morphology for 48-mer reveals failure due to the crack at 200% strain. (b) Visual inspection of the 120-mer P3HT polymer morphology reveals no such phenomenon as observed for 48-mer P3HT for a strain of >200%. (c) Stress–strain behavior for different P3HT chain lengths. 48-mer P3HT shows a reduction of stress to ∼0 GPa at a strain of ∼200%. However nonzero stress is observed for a strain of >200% for 120-mer P3HT. (d) The orientation parameter in the x-direction (longitudinal) and y-direction (transverse) for the 48-mer P3HT polymer is presented as a function of unidirectional strain. A gradual increase in the longitudinal component of the orientation parameter reveals the alignment of polymers along the direction of applied strain.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Glass transition temperature (Tg) as a function of the PCBM weight fraction. The predicted trend of increasing Tg with increasing PCBM in the BHJ agrees with previous experimental results.45 (b) Tensile modulus as a function of the PCBM weight fraction. The addition of PCBM increases the tensile modulus of the BHJ layer, indicating the anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM molecules. (c) Stress–strain response for different P3HT:PCBM weight ratios. An increase in the slope of the linear region of the stress–strain curve reveals that the BHJ becomes stiffer due to the PCBM addition. (d) Exciton diffusion to charge transport probability as a function of tensile modulus for different P3HT:PCBM weight ratios. A 1.0:0.8 weight ratio is found to have the highest probability with a relatively low tensile modulus, indicating an optimum morphology for a flexible OSC active layer.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Glass transition temperature (Tg) as a function of the weight percent of the oligomer additive (8-mer P3HT). Tg decreases to ∼268 K for 20% oligomer additives, indicating the plasticizing effect of oligomers. (b) Tensile modulus for different oligomer additive contents in the 1.0:0.8 P3HT:PCBM BHJ. A decrease in tensile modulus can be attributed to the decrease in entanglement density due to small molecule inclusions. (c) Stress–strain response for different oligomer mass loadings. The visual inspection reveals a decrease in the tensile modulus due to the presence of oligomer additives. (d) Exciton generation to charge transport probability as a function of the tensile modulus for various weight percentages of oligomers. The anti-plasticizing effect of PCBM is reduced due to the oligomer inclusions as the tensile modulus decreases with the increasing oligomer fraction. The addition of ∼5% oligomers can be beneficial due to a significant increase in efficiency in addition to the decrease in tensile modulus. However, the decrease in glass transition temperature below room temperature can lead to an unstable morphology at operating temperatures >300 K.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Orientation parameter in the x-direction (longitudinal) and the y-direction (transverse) for different weight fractions of oligomer additives in the absence of unidirectional tensile strain. Effective orientation along the longitudinal direction is reduced due to oligomer insertion. (b) Interfacial area to volume ratio (IAVR) as a function of the oligomer additive weight fraction (%). An increase in effective IAVR is responsible for the increase in efficiency (exciton generation to charge transport probability).
