    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 27th April 2023AbstractPoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly (4-styrenesulfonate acid) (PEDOT:PSS), well-known as the most remarkable conducting polymer, has been applied in many areas due to its high electrical conductivity, high transparency, low cost, good flexibility and film formation property and excellent thermal stability. However, the strong acidity and insulating properties of PSS with high hydrophilicity can lead to significant deterioration of optoelectronic device performance. Here, we report the synthesis and study of fluorinated copolymers containing PSS called PSS-co-TF towards mitigating the above limitations. The resultant copolymers provide enhanced electrical conductivity and hydrophobicity to the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites compared to PEDOT:PSS even while sustaining good surface morphology. The influence of p-type buffer layers of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites on the performance of organic photodetectors made from poly(3-hexylthiophene) and PC[61]BM blends has been investigated. Among them, the device using PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 exhibited the highest detectivity of 3.46 × 1012 Jones at −0.5 V in response to 510 nm light, attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity.
Introduction
Conductive polymers that conduct electricity through their conjugated structures have attracted considerable attention for many optoelectronic applications such as polymer light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices due to their many advantageous properties, for instance, unique optical and electrical properties, processability, controllable morphology, and high conductivity.1–5 Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the most investigated conductive polymers because of its excellent conducting properties. However, PEDOT is insoluble in common solvents, resulting in poor processability.6 To deal with this problem, the poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) is used as a dopant and stabilizer for PEDOT. This strategy helps for stable dispersion of PEDOT:PSS in water while improving the conductivity of PEDOT through doping. In many types of optoelectronic devices, PEDOT:PSS layers are sandwiched between the active organic layer and the indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode.7–10 In this role, PEDOT:PSS gives a higher work function than that of ITO to be suitably used as a p-type buffer layer and protects the active layer by inhibiting the penetration of oxygen. A low leakage current is important to use an organic photodetector (OPD) with high detectivity, and the charge blocking ability of the inserted buffer layer substantially contributes to inhibiting the reverse bias leakage current.11 Unfortunately, OPDs with the PEDOT:PSS layer have problems of high dark current under reverse bias and device instability due to their hydrophilic and insulating properties of PSS. Several strategies have been proposed, including heat treatment, introduction of additives to PEDOT:PSS dispersions, such as DMSO or ethylene glycol to enhance the conductivity and stability.12–14 Among them, the incorporation of fluorine into PEDOT:PSS has been of particular interest due its ability to provide durability and reliability to the device owing to the resultant low surface energy, remarkable chemical inertness, immiscibility with other materials, high thermal stability, and self-organization originating from the fluorophobic effect.15,16 Recently, Hsiao et al. prepared perfluoro-substituted PEDOT and investigated the effect of moisture on their device durability. Bulky substitutions with low surface energy from fluorine units can enhance the moisture resistance and the lifetime of the optoelectronic device applications.17 Very recently, Zhou et al. reported improved device performance of the inverted organic solar cells by adding fluorine-containing surfactants in PEDOT:PSS which provide slightly increased work function of PEDOT:PSS considered to achieve an ohmic contact between the active layer and p-type buffer layer.18 However, it is still challenging to polymerize bulky substituted EDOT monomers or adopt additive approaches without phase separation for desirable devices. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a series of perfluoro-substituted random copolymers, poly(styrene sulfonate-co-tetrafluorostyrene propyl sulfonate)s. The series constitute PSS-co-TF3, PSS-co-TF5, and PSS-co-TF10 possessing with different amounts of perfluorostyrene functional groups for additive-free PEDOT:PSS buffer layers applicable in OPD devices. Specific detectivity of the OPD devices using PEDOT:PSS-co-TFs composites was improved compared with its devices using of commercially available PEDOT:PSS (Clevios 4083).
Experimental details
Materials
Sodium 3-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-vinylphenoxy)propane-1-sulfonate (TFSSNa) was similarly synthesized according to the procedure in a previously reported literature.19 Sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate (NaSS), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene, 1,3-propanesultone, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O) were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Commercial PEDOT:PSS (Clevios 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. The ion-exchange resin was purchased from Samyang Co. All other chemical solvents were purchased from commercial sources and purified by distillation prior to use.

Synthesis of PSS-co-TF3. 
NaSS (3.34 g, 16.20 mmol) and TFSSNa (0.17 g, 0.66 mmol) in distilled water (20 mL) were mixed with K2S2O8 (0.06 g, 1.78 wt% per monomer) and NaHSO3 (0.03 g, 0.86 wt% per monomer). The reaction mixture was heated to 45 °C in a water bath and stirred for 6 h under a N2 atmosphere. After being cooled down to room temperature, the solution was dialyzed against distilled water using the semi-permeable membrane. The dialysate was altered by fresh distilled water each hour until the conductivity of the dialysate was similar to that of distilled water. The PSS-co-TF3 was obtained by mixing an equal volume of cationic ion exchange resin and stirring at 30 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the dialyzed solution was evaporated and dried in a vacuum oven in order to obtain PSS-co-TF3 (2.7 g, 77% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, δ, ppm): 8.0–6.0 (aromatic-CH), 4.1 (O–CH2), 3.0 (CH2–SO3−), 2.1 (CH2), 1.0–1.6 (CH–CH2). FT-IR (cm−1): 1140–1250 (OSO), 960 (C–O–C), 1412–1495 (CC). aqueous GPC: Mn = 156 kDa, Mw = 375 kDa, PDI = 2.4.


Synthesis of PSS-co-TF5. 
It was synthesized with a procedure similar to that described for the compound PSS-co-TF3 to give PSS-co-TF5 by using different ratios of NaSS (3.24 g, 15.71 mmol) and TFSSNa (0.27 g, 1.05 mmol). (2.63 g, 75% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, δ, ppm): 8.0–6.0 (aromatic-CH), 4.1 (O–CH2), 3.0 (CH2–SO3−), 2.1 (CH2), 1.0–1.6 (CH–CH2). FT-IR (cm−1): 1140–1250 (OSO), 960 (C–O–C), 1412–1495 (CC). aqueous GPC: Mn = 139 kDa, Mw = 350 kDa, PDI = 2.5.


Synthesis of PSS-co-TF10. 
It was synthesized with a procedure similar to that described for the compound PSS-co-TF3 to give PSS-co-TF10 by different ratios of NaSS (2.97 g, 14.40 mmol) and TFSSNa (0.54 g, 2.10 mmol). (2.53 g, 72% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, δ, ppm): 8.0–6.0 (aromatic-CH), 4.1 (O–CH2), 3.0 (CH2–SO3−), 2.1 (CH2), 1.0–1.6 (CH–CH2). FT-IR (cm−1): 1140–1250 (OSO), 960 (C–O–C), 1412–1495 (CC). aqueous GPC: Mn = 145 kDa, Mw = 340 kDa, PDI = 2.3.


Synthesis of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites. 
The PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites were prepared by oxidative polymerization. The copolymers (PSS-co-TF3, PSS-co-TF5 and PSS-co-TF10) (0.38 g) in distilled water (20 mL) was mixed with sodium persulfate (0.18 g, 0.98 wt%) and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (0.04 g, 0.2 wt%). 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomers (0.07 mL, 0.5 wt%) were added to the mixture. Oxidative polymerization was carried out under vigorous agitation in N2 atmosphere at 20 °C for 24 h. The obtained products were mixed with cation and anion exchange resins for 24 h and filtered with 30 μm mesh filter to remove sodium and sulfate ions. Then, the solution was dialyzed against distilled water using the semi-permeable membrane until the conductivity of the dialysate was similar to that of distilled water. After dialysis, three different solutions were prepared as PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF5, and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF10. FT-IR (cm−1): 1624 (CC), 1523 (C–C), 1388 (C–O–C), 1140–1250 (OSO), 1412–1495 (CC).


Characterization. 
To characterize the structure of the copolymers, FT-IR (Bruker, Vortex 70), 1H NMR (Bruker Biospin, Avance III HD, 400 MHz), UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) were used. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (ACME9000 equipped with a series of Water columns; Ultrahydrogel 120, 250, 500, 2000). The contact angle data were obtained on a contact angle analyzer (SEO Phoenix300). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, K-Alpha +) was used to analyze the ratio of PEDOT to PSS. The topography images of the films for PEDOT:PSS-co-TFs were taken with an atomic force microscope (AFM, Surface Imaging Systems-GmbH, Picostation). The electrical conductivity is extracted from the sheet resistance tested on a two-point measuring device.

Fabrication of organic photodetectors
The OPDs were fabricated on ITO glass substrates. Before fabrication, the substrate was washed with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each. The substrates were then dried under nitrogen gas and treated with UV ozone for 10 min. The Clevios 4083 or PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 dispersion as a p-type buffer layer wase deposited on ITO by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. The P3HT:PC[61]BM (1:0.8) in chlorobenzene (27 mg mL−1) was then spin coated at 2500 rpm for 60 s on the buffer layer and annealed at 135 °C for 10 min. Finally, the LiF (3 nm) and Al (100 nm) electrodes were deposited through a thermal evaporation under 3.0 × 10−6 torr. The dark and photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) correlations of OPDs were measured by the Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System under dark conditions and under 510 nm light irradiation (2 mW cm−2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was monitored using a spectral quantum efficiency conversion efficiency (IPCE) setup device (CompactStat, IVIUM) composed of a Xenon lamp (450 W, Newport) and a monochromator.
Results and discussion
In this study, perfluorostyrene functional groups were introduced into the main PSS chains to obtain the random copolymers of the PSS-co-TF series (PSS-co-TF3, PSS-co-TF5, and PSS-co-TF10). The copolymers were prepared by free radical polymerization using potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) as the initiator (Fig. 1). Among them, PSS-co-TF3 has a high yield of 77% and its high molecular weight and high dispersibility can be obtained by aqueous GPC (Mn = 156 kDa, PDI = 2.4). To analyze the structure and molar ratio of the introduced perfluorostyrene functional groups, the 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra of the copolymers were investigated. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the peaks at 7.5 and 6.8 ppm were assigned to the four protons of the aromatic ring, and the peaks at 4.1, 3.0, and 2.1 ppm represented the six protons on the side chain of the perfluorostyrene. The peak at 1.4 ppm depicted the three protons on the main chain of the copolymers. The percentage of perfluoro-styrene groups in the main backbone chains can be obtained by calculating the integration area of 6.8 and 4.1 ppm. It appears 3, 5, and 10 for PSS-co-TF3, PSS-co-TF5, and PSS-co-TF10, respectively, almost the same as the feeding ratio of NaSS and TFSSNa. From the FT-IR spectra of the copolymers shown in Fig. 2(b), the vibrational bands were indicated at 1640 cm−1 and between 1495 and 1412 cm−1, relative to the skeletal vibration of CC in the aromatic rings. Vibration bands between 1250 and 1140 cm−1 with relatively wide shoulder peaks were caused by asymmetric stretching vibration of SO3. Obviously, the peak of the ether stretching band at 960 cm−1 increased, whereas the contents of perfluorostyrene functional groups in the PSS-co-TF copolymers were increased. The aqueous dispersions of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites were prepared by oxidative polymerization from EDOT monomers in the PSS-co-TF copolymers as templates. The FT-IR spectra of the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites were displayed in Fig. 2(c). The CC stretching band at 1624 cm−1, the C–C stretching band at 1523 cm−1, and the C–O–C stretching band at 1388 cm−1 of the composites appeared to be the same as the spectrum of EDOT. As a result, it indicated that the synthesis of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites was well prepared.

The hydrophobicity could be affected by the contents of fluorinated styrene groups in the PSS-co-TF copolymers. As shown in Fig. 3, the water contact angle was measured to investigate the hydrophobicity of the copolymers. The Clevios 4083 film has 30.9° of the contact angles. However the film of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites having fluorinated styrene groups in the PSS gradually increased as the contents of fluorine atoms increased. The composite films showed 34.7°, 47.3°, and 54.7° for the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF5, and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF10, respectively. This result might be represented as a better interfacial contact between the p-type buffer layer, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites, and the hydrophobic photoactive layer in optoelectronic devices. Fig. 4 shows UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites. The absorption behavior of the composites is very similar in all wavelength ranges, so it can be inferred that the PEDOT doping level in the PSS-co-TF copolymers is also similar.20 This means that the introduction of fluorinated styrene groups into the PSS polymers is fairly independent of the PEDOT doping level.

To study the effect of modified PSS on the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites, the solution of Clevios 4083 and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites was spin-coated on cleaned glass substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. As shown in Table 1, the film thickness of the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites was approximately four times thicker than that of the Clevios 4083 film, probably attributed to the higher solid contents of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF solutions. The conductivity of the composite films was determined by measuring the sheet resistance with a two-point probe method, which was estimated as 6.3, 3.9, and 2.2 S cm−1 for the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF5, and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF10, respectively. These results might be attributed by reduced clustering of the PEDOT particles into PSS-co-TF copolymer domains.21,22 The observed morphologies are correlated to the atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the films. Although the conductivity decreases with the increasing fluorine contents, it is still worth noting that the conductivity of all the copolymers remarkably increased by exhibiting 1000–3000 times higher values compared to that of the Clevios 4083 film (0.002 S cm−1). In order to investigate the effect of fluorine contents on the PEDOT polymerization, XPS was utilized to determine the ratio of PEDOT to PSS-co-TF copolymers. Fig. 5(a) shows the deconvolution of the C(1s) spectrum for three different binding energy peaks at 284.8, 286.4 and 291.2 eV, which correspond to C–C sp2, C–O and π → π*, respectively for the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 powder. Three binding energies of 531.3, 532.7 and 535.9 eV can be obtained from the O(1s) spectra, originating from PSS-co-TF3, PEDOT and chemisorbed oxygen, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The S(2p) spectra exhibited two peaks in PEDOT with a low binding energy and in PSS-co-TF3 with a high binding energy shown in Fig. 5(c). The S(2p) spectra can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 168.0, 167.7, 164.6 and 163.5 eV. The lower binding energy peaks at 164.6 and 163.5 eV are associated with the sulfur atoms S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) in PEDOT, and the higher binding energy peaks at 168.0 and 167.7 eV are from the sulfur atoms S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) in PSS-co-TF3. Fig. 5(d) shows the binding energy peak of F(1s) at 688 eV, attributed to the perfluorostyrene groups. This is another indication that perfluorostyrene groups have been successfully polymerized in the main chain of PSS-co-TF3. Furthermore, the thiophene-sulfonate ratio (RT/S) could be used to express the ratio of PEDOT to PSS-co-TF3. The RT/S can be derived from the S(2p) peak area ratio of the PEDOT and PSS-co-TF3. As shown in Table 2, the RT/S ratio of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 (around 0.30) is higher than that of Clevios 4083 (around 0.22). Hence, PEDOT polymerization with PSS-co-TF3 is superior to that with PSS. This also demonstrates that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 is significantly higher compared to that of Clevios 4083. However, the RT/S of the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF5 and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF10 composites decreased slightly, resulting in a lower conductivity compared to PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3.

The AFM was utilized to study surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF films. The films were prepared by using the spin-coating method and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 6, the topographic images of the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF films were similar to those of Clevios 4083. The root mean square (RMS) values of the films were 6.30, 8.05, 4.12, and 3.85 nm for Clevios 4083, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF5, and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF10, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the size of PEDOT clusters in PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites might be proportional to the conductivity of the films resulting in showing highest conductivity for PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3.

To investigate the beneficial effects of the PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 on OPD devices as a buffer layer, we fabricated the devices based on active layer of P3HT:PC[61]BM bulk heterojunction film, and compared their photodetection properties (Fig. 7). Responsivity and specific detectivity are important parameters for the evaluation of photodetectors. The responsivity (R) is defined as the ratio of the generated photocurrent density (Jph) to the incident optical power density (Llight) on the detector and is calculated by EQE according to the following equation:23 (1)where λ, h, q, and c represent the wavelength, Planck's constant, elementary charge, and velocity of light in vacuum, respectively.23 As R is directly proportional to the quantum yield of the photodetector, it is crucial that the photodetector has a high conversion rate from photons to electrons and holes, or a high external quantum efficiency (EQE). The detectivity influences by the responsivity and dark current density. Assuming that the total noise is dominated to the shot noise under reverse voltage,24,25 the specific detectivity (D*) is given by the following equation:26 (2)where Jd represents the dark current density. According to the above formula, high photocurrent and low dark current are required to achieve high detectivity. To obtain a low Jd, the leakage current needs to be minimized in the operation. Also, the device films should have low trap density, low thermal emission rate and good film quality.27 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 8(a) for the OPD devices using the p-type buffer layers with Clevios 4083 and PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3. The J–V curves were obtained by measuring in the dark and under illumination at λ = 510 nm (power density = 2 mW cm−2). As displayed in Table 3, the photocurrent density of the OPD device using PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 is 6.81 × 10−4 A cm−2 at −0.5 V, which is higher than that of the device using Clevios 4083 (6.13 × 10−4 A cm−2). At −0.5 V, the dark current density of the OPD device using PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 film is 1.35 × 10−8 A cm−2, which is significantly lower than that of the device using Clevios 4083 (2.67 × 10−7 A cm−2). As seen in Fig. 8(b), two devices show photoresponse from 300 to 650 nm. This also implies that they can be suitable for visible spectrum applications. At −0.5 V and λ = 510 nm, the EQE of the two devices are 51.84% (Clevios 4083) and 55.29% (PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3), respectively. Also, R calculated Eqn (1) of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 has the higher R at −0.5 V (0.23 A W−1) than that of device with Clevios 4083 (0.21 A W−1) in Fig. 8(c). These results are attributed to the reduced contact resistance by higher electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 films.

In addition, D* is also calculated by eqn (2). The device consisting of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 has the highest D* at −0.5 V (3.46 × 1012 Jones), in contrast to the D* values of 7.30 × 1011 Jones for devices with Clevios 4083, respectively in Fig. 8(d). The specific detectivity of the OPD device with PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 is 4.7 times higher than that of the Clevios 4083 with significantly suppressed dark current and increased photocurrent because of the improved interface between buffer layer and active organic layer and electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 layer. To demonstrate general applicability, we applied PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 to non-fullerene-based near-infrared (NIR) OPDs (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F). As shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4, the OPD based on PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 exhibited decreased Jd and higher EQE values, resulting in high D* of 2.83 × 1013 Jones, which suggests wide applicability for various types of BHJ layers. Finally, we investigated the effect of incorporation of TF3 unit on the ambient stability of OPDs without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 10, the OPDs based on PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 exhibited much improved stability in both Jph and Jd attributed to its hydrophobic property compared to conventional PEDOT:PSS.

Conclusion
We have successfully synthesized newly developed PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites containing fluorinated styrene groups in PSS-co-TF copolymers. The contents of fluorinated styrene groups in the copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra. The introduction of fluorine atoms into PSS enhanced the hydrophobicity of PSS-co-TF copolymers determined by the water contact angle and improved the growth of PEDOT inferred by the XPS data. Therefore, PEDOT:PSS-co-TF composites had a significant improvement in electrical conductivity compared to Clevios 4083. Furthermore, the P3HT:PC[61]BM-based OPD device using PEDOT:PSS-co-TF3 as buffer layer exhibited a specific detectivity of 3.46 × 1012 Jones at −0.5 V, which was 4.7 times higher than that of the device with Clevios 4083, due to the enhanced electrical conductivity and improved interface. We believe that PSS-co-TF copolymers possessing high conductivity and hydrophobicity can be suitably applicable to other optoelectronic devices as buffer layers.
