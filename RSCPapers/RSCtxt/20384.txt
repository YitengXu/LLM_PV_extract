    , Accepted 26th November 2015First published on 27th November 2015AbstractA novel top-down and universal optical technique for the effective decoration of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NS), graphene oxide (GO), boron nitride (BN) and tungsten disulfide (WS2), with noble metallic nanoparticles (NPs) is reported. The NS–NP assemblies were formed under ambient conditions, via a facile, rapid and solution compatible laser assisted process in the presence of a metallic precursor. It is shown that a few seconds of irradiation is sufficient to decorate the NS lattice, while the NP density can be readily controlled upon variation of the irradiation time. It is found that the laser induced anchoring of Au NPs onto the NS basal plane and edges resulted in enhanced light harvesting that is potentially useful for energy conversion and storage applications. To demonstrate the potential of the approach for practical applications, the incorporation of WS2–Au NP assemblies into the photoactive layer of ternary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is realized. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the binary device consisting of a poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) blend as the donor–acceptor pair was 5.6%, while after the employment of WS2–Au NPs the efficiency enhancement of the ternary device was approximately 13% reaching a total PCE of 6.3%. The facile, rapid and room temperature nature of the photo-induced method proposed here provides unique opportunities for the cost-effective synthesis of bulk amounts of NS–NP assemblies in solution for many optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
The interest in 2D materials has been rapidly raised since 2004 when Novoselov and Geim isolated one atomic layer thick graphene sheets, revealing their extraordinary properties and great potential for various applications.1 Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with the common structural form MeX2 (Me = Mo, W, Ti, etc. and X = S, Se, Te), and boron nitride (BN) NS exhibit a laminar structure similar to that of graphene and have drawn the attention of research community.2–5 One of the most attractive features of TMDC structured compounds is their transition from indirect band gap semiconductors in their bulk nature, to direct band gap semiconductors when isolated as a monolayer. In particular, their electrical properties vary from metals to wide band gap semiconductors depending on the number of layers involved in the sheet, while they can be easily tuned by modification of the crystal structure or by applying strain.6 Tungsten disulfide (WS2) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are semiconductors with band gaps ranging from the visible to the near-infrared,7 while hexagonal BN is an excellent dielectric.4
On the other hand, noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as Au, Ag and Pt are of great interest because of their unique physical and chemical properties. Such properties are strongly dependent on their size and shape and therefore much attention has been paid to exploit such effects for potential applications. Accordingly, numerous applications have been demonstrated, ranging from plasmonic optoelectronic devices8–10 to catalysis11–13 and nonlinear photonic devices.14–17 Another challenging application is in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), where plasmonic NPs have been extensively used for solar light harvesting and, in turn, for OPV efficiency enhancement.18 Specifically, when the NP diameter is smaller than 40 nm, NPs act as sub-wavelength antennas, leading to enhanced light absorption due to the plasmon resonance effect.19,20 Larger diameter NPs function as multiple scattering centers, giving rise to increase of the optical path length within the photoactive medium.21–23
In this context, the possibility of incorporating solution processable 2D materials combined with metal NPs to form NS–NP assemblies inside the photoactive layer of OPVs can provide a dual enhancement effect. Firstly, the NPs will enhance the light absorption via either plasmonic or scattering effects, and secondly the bandgap tunability of 2D NS could give rise to enhanced exciton dissociation and charge collection through the formation of a ternary OPV configuration.24 Apart from the benefits in OPV technology, the development of NS–NP assemblies in solution could further allow the realization of various printable nanophotonic devices with tunable optical and electronic properties, covering a wide spectral range from the microwave to the ultraviolet. For example, the decoration of MoS2 NS with Au NPs has led to a p-doping effect in MoS2 NS transistors25 as well as to plasmon enhanced photocatalytic water splitting.26
In this paper we introduce a one-step, in situ laser induced anchoring of noble metallic NPs onto the surface area of a thin 2D NS and demonstrate the potential use of such assemblies in OPV applications. The method involves the UV laser irradiation of NS dispersions in the presence of a precursor metallic salt. The preparation is based on the photo-activation of the NS surface by UV laser photons, followed by chemical reduction of the metallic precursor.27 Although several methods have been reported for the laser-assisted synthesis of graphene- and GO-NP nanocomposites, currently there is no report, to our knowledge, on the laser-induced formation of metallic NPs onto other kinds of 2D NS.28–31 Therefore, our approach is universal, i.e. the NP anchoring can be realised in different types of NS including GO, WS2, MoS2 and BN. It is important that this one-step, room temperature synthesis is achieved in the absence of surfactants, catalysts or toxic chemical reducing agents thus providing a green approach for the synthesis of NS–NP nanocomposites. Furthermore, it is faster and more efficient compared to the previously reported techniques, considering that a single laser pulse is sufficient to obtain stable 2D-NP dispersions. Finally, as a proof of concept, the novel application of hybrid 2D-NP materials in ternary organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is demonstrated. It is found that the WS2 NS decorated with plasmonic Au NPs could function as an efficient additive into ternary OPV devices. It is shown that the incorporation of WS2 NS–Au NP assemblies into the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer of OPV cells gives rise to a conversion efficiency enhancement of ∼13% with respect to reference devices, a result that demonstrates the potential use of laser-decorated plasmonic 2D materials for further optoelectronic applications.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Reagents and materials
The pristine NS were purchased from Graphene Supermarket in dispersions (GO = 500 mg L−1, BN = 5.4 mg L−1, WS2 = 26 mg L−1). The BN flake lateral size was 50–200 nm consisting of 1 to 5 monolayers. The WS2 flake lateral size was 50–150 nm consisting of 1 to 4 monolayers. The size of GO flakes was 0.3–0.7 μm consisting of at least 80% monolayers. The chloroauric acid (HAuCl4, ethanol as the solvent) and silver nitrate (AgNO3, distilled water as the solvent) salts were supplied from Sigma Aldrich.
2.2 Laser irradiation process
Mixed dispersions of NS with HAuCl4 in ethanol or AgNO3 in water were placed into a quartz cuvette and were subjected to illumination by excimer laser UV pulses (wavelength of 248 nm, pulse duration of 20 ns). A couple of irises secured the formation of a spatially uniform laser beam spot of 8.5 mm diameter that illuminated the solution. Two different irradiation fluences were used, 100 mJ cm−2 or 1000 mJ cm−2, corresponding to a single pulse power of 56.7 mW and 567 mW respectively. During illumination, the irradiated dispersions were continuously agitated via a magnetic stirrer. A schematic representation of the experimental process is depicted in Fig. 1A. To investigate the process of the laser induced NPs anchoring onto NS, the irradiation power, the number of pulses and the relative concentration of NS over the salt precursor were varied.

2.3 Materials characterization
Characterization was carried out after purification by three centrifugation/decantation and re-dispersion steps to ensure that any non-covalently attached NPs were removed. In particular, the morphology of pristine and NPs' decorated NS was characterized with High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), using a JEOL-2100 LaB6 ultra-high-resolution electron microscope. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the initial and laser-irradiated solutions were obtained using a Perkin Elmer, LAMBDA 950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer. Raman spectroscopy is performed at room temperature using a Nicolet Almega XR Raman spectrometer equipped with a 470 nm laser as an excitation source. For the preparation of the samples, the NS and NS–NP assemblies were dropcast onto quartz substrates.
2.4 Device fabrication and characterization
PCDTBT and PC71BM, both purchased from Solaris Chem, were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene:chlorobenzene (3:1) (o-DCB:CB), in a 1:4 (4 mg:16 mg) ratio and stirred overnight at 70 °C. The resulting PCDTBT:PC71BM solutions were mixed with different amounts of WS2 and WS2–Au NS (1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.5% v/v) to obtain the final blends. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated onto 20 mm by 15 mm indium-tin-oxide (ITO) on glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼20 Ω sq−1. The impurities are removed from the ITO glass through a 3-step cleaning process (soap solution, acetone and isopropanol). WS2 and WS2–Au NS were also dissolved into o-DCB followed by ultrasonication for 1 h. Following this cleaning process, the substrates were spin-cast with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer at 6000 rpm for 60 s, obtaining a 30 nm hole transport layer. The films were baked for 20 min at 120 °C inside a nitrogen-filled glove box to dry any residual moisture. All photoactive layers (PCDTBT:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM:WS2 and PCDTBT:PC71BM:WS2:Au) were subsequently deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating at 1000 rpm, until the thickness reached approximately 80 nm determined by cross-sectional SEM images. The cells were dried at 60 °C for 1 min and subsequently a 10 nm Ca interlayer and a 100 nm Al top electrode were deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation to complete device architecture, creating an active area of 0.04 cm2.
The optoelectronic performance of the solar cell devices were measured at room temperature with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (A.M. 1.5 G) solar simulator at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 inside a glove box. Current–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using an Agilent B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer. A reference monocrystalline silicon solar cell from Newport was used to calibrate the light intensity. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted immediately after device fabrication and the encapsulation method because of the sensitivity of Ca to air. The respective EQE spectra were monitored using a Xe lamp passing through a monochromator and an optical chopper at low frequencies (∼200 Hz) in order to maximize the signal/noise (S/N) ratio.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of 2D NS–NP assemblies
The laser-induced reaction leading to NP nucleation onto the 2D NS took place into a quartz cuvette, containing the initial NS dispersion into which the precursor molecules were dissolved. The efficiency of the process was unexpectedly high, as the final product was delivered via irradiation with a single laser pulse. In order to find out the optimum parameters for the NS decoration a series of different volume ratios of NS over the precursor solution were investigated.
The best results, as far as the uniformity of NS decoration and the stability of the final solutions against precipitation, were obtained for NS:precursor ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4, respectively, using two different laser fluences of 100 or 1000 mJ cm−2. It should be emphasized that the irradiated dispersions were stable, since no precipitation is observed even after months of storage under ambient conditions.
In a first experiment we have irradiated GO NS in the presence of the HAuCl4 metallic precursor. As the GO NS surface was activated and decorated with Au NPs, upon irradiation with consecutive UV pulses, the coloration of the mixture was gradually turned from bright yellow to dark red (Fig. 1B). The corresponding UV-vis spectra of GO–Au assemblies formed are presented in Fig. 2A. As expected, the spectrum shows the appearance of a distinct peak at 545 nm, corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)32 of gold NPs. We postulate that the photo-reduction of the HAuCl4 solution was the main source of NP generation. Similar results were obtained in the case of GO–Ag assemblies formed upon irradiation of GO–NS–AgNO3 dispersions (Fig. S1, ESI†). In this case as well, following an elevated number of pulses, a characteristic peak at ∼400 nm appeared in the UV-vis spectrum of the irradiated dispersion, corresponding to the SPR of Ag NPs.33

The inset depicts an image of the respective dispersions; (B) and (C) TEM images of the GO–Au assemblies after the illumination of the mixed solutions at a ratio of 2:1 with a single UV pulse and fluence of 100 mJ cm−2; (D) size distribution of the Au NPs grafted onto the GO NS. 
Further evidence that the NPs were successfully grafted onto GO NS was obtained by TEM imaging. Fig. 2B and C show typical TEM images of GO:Au assemblies formed using a single UV laser pulse of 100 mJ cm−2. It is clear that NPs are uniformly distributed on the NS surface. The corresponding size distribution of the nucleated Au NPs is presented in Fig. 2D. Fig. S2 and S3† show the respective TEM images and size distribution for Ag NPs.
The laser-assisted assembly of NPs can be universally applied to other 2D NS such as WS2, MoS2 and BN. Fig. 3A and B and S7† show the respective TEM images for BN–Au and WS2–Au and MoS2–Au assemblies, respectively, synthesized via irradiation of 1:1 mixture solutions with a single pulse of 100 mJ cm−2 fluence. As in the case of GO gold NPs were uniformly dispersed onto the NS surface. The corresponding NP size distributions are shown in Fig. 3D for WS2:Au and in Fig. S8 and S10† for MoS2–Au and BN–Au respectively; in all cases the NP size ranged from ∼1 to ∼15 nm.

To further investigate the process of the laser induced NPs anchoring onto NS, the irradiation power, the number of pulses and the relative concentration of NS over the salt precursor were varied. Fig. 4 depicts the representative UV-vis absorption spectra of laser treated BN–HAuCl4 (Fig. 4A and C), WS2–HAuCl4 (Fig. 4B) and MoS2–HAuCl4 (Fig. 4D) dispersions at different laser fluences, number of pulses and different NS:precursor relative concentrations. A general trend is that as one increases the fluence or the pulse number or the NS:precursor ratio, the gold plasmon resonance peak becomes more pronounced. TEM imaging (not shown) revealed that the density of NPs anchored onto NS increases accordingly. Similar results were obtained in the case of NS–Ag NP assemblies (Fig. S5, S6 and S9†).

Raman spectroscopy was employed in order to identify any laser induced structural modification of the laser treated NS dispersions. The Raman spectra of GO–Ag and GO–Au NS, presented in Fig. S11A,† indicate that the molecular structure of GO NS had not been affected by the laser induced synthetic process. As a result, the characteristic G and D Raman peaks of GO at 1313 cm−1 and 1585 cm−1 showed no significant changes following the irradiation process. A similar observation was made in the case of the laser synthesized WS2–Au NS. Indeed, the Raman spectra of the NS before and after single pulse UV laser irradiation do not indicate any significant differences. Fig. S11B† presents the respective spectra showing the characteristic E2g and A1g modes of WS2 at 355 cm−1 and 418 cm−1 respectively. Finally, the pristine and Au NPs decorated BN NS demonstrate a basic Raman peak at 1363 cm−1, which is the characteristic peak of the hexagonal BN (h-BN) phase (Fig. S11C†).34 The second peak appearing at around 1050 cm−1 corresponds to the translational optical (TO) vibrational mode of the crystalline BN (c-BN) phase. Both peaks showed no significant difference upon laser irradiation. The above results indicate that the assembly of NPs onto the NS surface occurs without inducing any chemical modification to the pristine 2D NS.
Based on the above observations we may propose a mechanism behind the laser-induced formation of the NS surface. Oxygen groups, which are always present in exfoliated 2D NS in water, contribute to an overall negatively charged NS surface.30,35,36 This negative charging effect is responsible for the attachment of the free Au3+ ions in HAuCl4− or Ag+ ions in AgNO3 aqueous solutions due to electrostatic interactions. Subsequently, the UV laser pulse supplied the energy to facilitate the reduction of such ions, via charge transfer from the NS to the ions, enabling the growth of NPs onto the NS surface.37,38 Based on the above, it is reasonable to suggest that oxygen functional groups act as nucleation sites for the UV-assisted growth of the metal NPs onto the NS surface. Alternatively, non-oxygen contained defect sites on the basal plane, as well as at the vicinity of wrinkled and folded areas within the NS, can function as NP nucleation centers.36,39 This is due to the NS local morphology change, which could efficiently trap the precursor molecules and thus function as nucleation centers for NP growth. Further work is currently under progress in order to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the formation of NPs onto NS.
The interest and the application of 2D materials in various building blocks of thin film solar cell technology, has been reported quite extensively.40–47 Among the strategies adopted to facilitate the energy cascade procedure and promote the transport of light generated charge carriers to the respective electrodes is the introduction of a third component into the photoactive binary layer, resulting in the formation of a ternary blend structure device.48,49 The motivation behind this approach is the insertion of a material having its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) between the HOMO and LUMO of the polymer and the fullerene. This material can act either as a secondary donor or acceptor material, offering an extra interface for exciton dissociation and charge transfer.50
3.2 Fabrication of ternary OPV devices
Semiconductor NS might be promising materials for light harvesting applications due to their unique electrical and optical properties, as well as suitable bandgap values for energetically favorable electron transfer from the polymer donor.51 Moreover, further improvement in OPV performance can be achieved via the use of hybrid assemblies based on NS combined with plasmonic metallic NPs.18,52–55 In this context, the laser-generated NS–NP assemblies developed in this work may be suitable to be used as the energy cascade material in ternary OPVs, leading to increased performance, through improved optical absorption due to the NPs, and to improved exciton dissociation and charge collection due to the 2D NS. As a proof of concept, the performance of a ternary OPV43 based on the addition of NS–Au assemblies into a PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ layer was investigated. It should be noted that WS2 and MoS2 were chosen among the various 2D materials used here, due to their perfect energy levels56 matching with the state of the art polymer donors used in OPVs. In contrast, GO57 and BN58 are insulating materials and therefore fail to facilitate charge transfer in ternary OPV cells.
The relative position of the additive component energy levels with respect to the electronic levels of the donor and the acceptor materials determines the performance of the ternary solar cell configuration. For this purpose, the HOMO and LUMO levels of WS2, WS2–Au, MoS2 and MoS2–Au were measured by cyclic voltammetry. The measurements were conducted in a three electrode apparatus, using a Pt foil as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference one. The voltammetric behaviors of the different materials tested in acetonitrile (CH3CN) using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 are demonstrated in Fig. S12.† The respective bands were calculated using previously reported formulae.59 The WS2 valence band position is approximately at −5.75 eV, calculated from the oxidation peak onset (0.65 V), while its conduction band extracted from the onset of the reduction peak (−0.97 V) is positioned at −4.13 eV. The MoS2 valence band position is approximately at −6.19 eV, calculated from the oxidation peak onset (1.09 V), while its conduction band extracted from the onset of the reduction peak (−0.89 V) is positioned at −4.21 eV. The above measurements are in agreement with the previously reported values.47 The decoration of WS2 NS with Au NPs had no effect on the measured energy levels, as indicated by the slight change in the oxidation and reduction peaks in Fig. S12† (top), while the decoration of MoS2 NS with Au NPs slightly affected the MoS2 energy levels, as indicated by the slight change in the oxidation and reduction peaks in Fig. S12† (bottom), leading to a valence band value of −6.31 eV and a conduction band value of −4.35 eV.

Fig. 5a and b depict the device architecture and the energy levels of the components of the WS2 NS-based devices. It can be observed that the excitons created into PCDTBT can diffuse to both PCDTBT:WS2–Au and PCDTBT:PC71BM interfaces. Moreover, the conduction band of WS2–Au is located between the LUMO levels of PCDTBT and PC71BM, acting as the energy intermediate step, so that the electrons can be transferred towards the cathode via this energetic cascade pathway. It can be concluded that the energy levels of WS2 perfectly match the energy levels of PCDTBT-donor and PC71BM-acceptor, acting as an efficient electron-cascade material. In contrast, as shown in Fig. S16,† the conduction and valence bands of MoS2 and MoS2–Au NS do not lie between the HOMO and LUMO levels of PCDTBT and PC71BM. Therefore this material is not expected to improve charge transfer in ternary OPVs. Indeed, ternary OPV devices incorporating GO, BN and MoS2 NS and their derivatives with NPs showed deteriorated OPV performance, compared to conventional ones (results not shown).

The effect of WS2 and WS2-NP assemblies on the performance of BHJ solar cells was investigated by altering the additive content into the photoactive layer. In both cases the optimum additive content was found to be 1.5% v/v. Fig. 6A demonstrates the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performed devices in each case for the four different active layers studied, namely PCDTBT:PC71BM (reference), PCDBT:Au:PC71BM, PCDBT:WS2:PC71BM and PCDBT:WS2–Au:PC71BM. Table 1 summarizes the respective photovoltaic characteristics. An enhancement of the PCE of the optimized PCDTBT:WS2:PC71BM based device, compared to the reference one, was observed. Specifically, the PCE increased from 5.6% to 6.1%, showing an improvement of 8%, attributed to the increase of the JSC. The latter is caused by improved charge-carrier separation, transportation and collection. However, PCE was further enhanced for the optimized PCDTBT:WS2–Au:PC71BM based devices, showing an improvement of 12.5% compared to the reference. The performance of such devices was also superior to the optimized PCDBT:Au:PC71BM based ones.

To investigate the origin of this additional enhancement, the UV-vis absorption spectra of PCDTBT:PC71BM films with and without the presence of WS2 (1.5%) and WS2–Au (1.5%) were measured and are presented in Fig. S13.† It is clear that the incorporation of both WS2 (1.5%) and WS2–Au NS enhances the light harvesting of the active layer, compared to the reference film, in a broad wavelength range (380–430 nm), indicating the presence of light scattering effects. This complies with the TEM images of the respective NS shown in Fig. 3B. Besides this, the spectrum of the WS2–Au based film shows an enhancement in the wavelength region from 480 to 600 nm, which is consistent with the SPR peak of the WS2–Au assemblies shown in Fig. 4D. Therefore, the absorption spectra indicate that the SPR of the WS2–Au nanocomposites may be responsible for the additional improvement in the OPV device performance.
Further insight into the light harvesting effects observed is provided by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the reference and WS2–Au based devices, respectively, presented in Fig. 6B. It can be observed that, although PCE for the WS2–Au based OPV is increased, compared to the reference, in the entire wavelength range, the enhancement is more pronounced in the range, 470–600 nm. This observation complies with that obtained from the absorption spectral analysis and further supports the indication of the SPR enhancement effect due to the presence of Au NPs onto the WS2 nanosheets.
In summary, our results presented above indicate that the efficiency enhancement in the case of the WS2-based ternary blend, can be attributed to superior charge transport properties inside the photoactive layer, compared to the binary active layer, due to the energy level offset between the polymer and the WS2 intermediate component. The additional improvement in the performance of the ternary devices incorporating WS2–Au assemblies as the third component may be due to SPR-assisted enhanced generation of excitons. It can be concluded that the application of hybrid WS2-NPs materials is dually beneficial in ternary OPV architecture.
The deterioration of the OPV performance for higher WS2–Au contents into the active medium can be attributed to additive-induced changes in the blend morphology. It is well reported that carrier scattering increases with active layer roughness, giving rise to inefficient collection of the photon-generated carriers from the respective electrodes.5 In order to investigate this we have performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the reference binary and the ternary layers, shown in Fig. S14.† Such measurements demonstrate that the lowest roughness is obtained for the layers incorporating 1.5% (v/v) WS2 NS and 1.5% (v/v) WS2–Au NS respectively (rms roughnesses of 0.573 nm and 0.576 nm respectively). In contrast, the addition of higher NS concentrations leads to a corresponding increase in the layer roughness, giving rise to the degradation of the donor/acceptor interfaces, and in turn of the OPV performance.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile, fast, in situ synthesis of 2D NS–NP assemblies, via laser induced grafting of metallic NPs onto NS in solution. This is a simple, one-step process, performed at room temperature and does not require any catalysts or surfactant agents. Furthermore, it can be universally applied for practically any 2D material, giving rise to various combinations of NS–NP assemblies. As a proof of the potential application of such assemblies, the incorporation of WS2–Au NPs into the photoactive layer of ternary BHJ OPVs was demonstrated. The results revealed a noticeable enhancement in the photocurrent and the PCE of the respective OPV devices, attributed to the efficient synergy of plasmon enhanced absorption of Au NPs with the superior charge transport properties due to the energy levels matching between the polymer and the intermediate WS2 NS component. Undoubtedly, this is a useful approach towards extending the spectral range of enhanced light harvesting in OPVs. The rather simple and scalable method provides unique opportunities for the cost-effective synthesis of bulk amounts of NS–NP assemblies in solution for various applications, including printable optoelectronic devices.
