    , Accepted 5th September 2018First published on 5th September 2018AbstractApart from being an analogue of the prototype for photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDMABA) is also one of the earliest patented and most commonly used sunscreen components. There is, however, little documented information about the photophysics and factors affecting the photophysics of this molecule. Such information is of importance for both the understanding of the ICT reaction and assessing the underlying process of photoprotection, especially in view of the “sunscreen controversy” that has arisen from the contrasting in vivo vs. in vitro photobiological results on this and related UV filters. We report herein a femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence (fs-TRF), complemented by transient absorption (fs-TA) to allow a full probe of the excited state cascades for EHDMABA and two of its derivatives in solvents of varied properties. The results provide direct evidence for a nearly solvent independent inner sphere ICT reaction occurring on the sub-picosecond time scale, and an ensuing solvent dictated deactivation of the ICT state. The ICT state in the aprotic solvent acetonitrile decayed solely through the intrinsic intersystem crossing (ISC) to produce a potentially harmful triplet excited state. In the protic solvent, the solvation and formation of ICT-induced solute–solvent hydrogen (H)-bonding opened the originally inaccessible internal conversion (IC) channel of the ICT state, leading to the rapid reformation of the ground state molecule with a unitary efficiency in the aqueous solution. This H-bonding-mediated IC restrained or eliminated the intrinsic ISC, providing a mechanism at the molecular level for the benign dissipation of the electronic excitation. The precise rate of IC was observed to vary with the alkoxy substituent and its efficiency was affected by the H-bonding capacity of the solvent. The findings of this work demonstrate the pivotal role of the microenvironment and the direct participation of solvent molecules through H-bonding in drastically altering the nonradiative dynamics and promoting or inhibiting photostability and photoprotection. This may assist in developing next-generation UV filters and help in improving formulation design for the optimal efficacy of sunscreen products. The pronounced H-bonding-induced fluorescence quenching and variation in the fluorescence wavelength imply that these molecules may also serve as a sensitive fluorescence probe for the H-bonding properties of the microenvironment.
Introduction
Exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may cause damage to DNA and the onset of skin cancer.1–4 It also plays a role in accelerating skin aging, inducing immunosuppression, and aggravating photodermatoses.3,4 Applying sunscreen, which almost inevitably contains chemical filters, is one of the key strategies for preventing excessive exposure to the UVR and guarding against the associated damaging effects. An efficient chemical filter is required to have a large electronic absorption cross-section in the range of UVR wavelengths and can dissipate the absorbed photon energy in a rapid and benign manner. An important issue in this regard is the efficacy and safety of commonly used chemical filters and any unintended human health consequences from sunscreen application. There is still concern regarding the probability that the chemical filters may dissipate the energy in a destructive way, resulting in photo-allergy, or even speed the development of skin tumors when applied to the skin in the presence of UVR.5,6 Such concern, usually referred to as the “sunscreen controversy”, has in recent years led to a surge of interest in exploring the photoprotective mechanisms of chemical sunscreens at the molecular level, using mostly sophisticated theoretical calculations7,8a,b and ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy.8c,9–13 These studies unveil that the photoprotection afforded by a number of ubiquitous organic filters is rendered insufficient due to varied nonradiative excited state processes enabling the rapid reformation of the corresponding original ground state molecules after absorption of the UVR.9,12 This involves, for instance, the sub-picosecond to several picosecond excited state hydrogen transfer accompanied by enol–keto tautomerization from methyl salicylate,10 oxybenzone,7a,11 and avobenzone,8 and the picosecond trans–cis isomerization from the family of sinapoyl malate12 and cinnamate molecules.7b,13
As one of the earliest patented and a commonly used UVB (spanning the wavelength range from 280 to 325 nm) photo-absorbers,14,15 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDMABA, known also as Padimate O, Scheme 1) and its analogues have been subjected to rather extensive in vitro and in vivo testing to assess their suitability for sunscreen application.14–17 The in vitro studies suggest that these types of molecules are photo-carcinogenic and may sensitize DNA to form detrimental photo-lesions including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6–4) pyrimidone photoproducts.15,16a In contrast, the in vivo studies showed a positive result in reducing the UVR-induced tumor formation and DNA damage in skin, clearly opposing the in vitro results.16 A probable source of this divergence could be relevant to the in vitro tests being done under artificial conditions, likely involving a physiologically irrelevant organic solvent, whereas the in vivo studies were conducted mostly with the molecules under examination in a largely aqueous vehicle.9 Indeed, some in vitro studies observed a decreased rate of photo-degradation from these molecules in protic solvents when compared with aprotic solvents.14,17 This implies solvent-sensitive excited state dynamics, and indicates that the properties of a microscopic environment may contribute crucially to photostability and the photoprotective vs. the photodamaging behavior of the DMABA type of sunscreen.
 Scheme 1  Structures of the studied and related compounds. 
Aside from being a topical sunscreen ingredient, EHDMABA and its analogues are also prototype systems that exhibit excited state intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and dual fluorescence after UV excitation.18 The blue component of the fluorescence is from the photo-prepared locally excited (LE) ππ* state and the red component with large Stokes shift is due to an ICT state produced by charge transfer from the LE state with the dimethylamino (DMA) group as the electron donor and the benzoate moiety the electron acceptor.18 Earlier investigations have shown that due to the strong accepting power of the benzoate moiety and the large electronegativity of the ester group, the ICT reaction of a model compound MDMABA (Scheme 1) may take place even in a nonpolar solvent.18,19 Our previous study of this molecule in CH3CN20 and in a largely aqueous solution21 showed comparably rapid rates (∼0.8–0.9 ps) for the ICT reaction, and found that the ICT state in CH3CN with a lifetime of ∼1.9 ns was deactivated mainly through intersystem crossing (ISC) to the 3ππ* triplet (3ππ*T) state. In the aqueous conditions the ICT state fluorescence was strongly quenched (∼50 ps lifetime), which was considered to be due to the rapid internal conversion (IC) decay of this state, induced by enhanced site-specific solute–solvent hydrogen (H)-bonding as suggested by the structure and energy calculations from density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)DFT.21 However, the excited state dynamics of the DMABA type molecules are not fully understood. Questions remain regarding the direct evidence for the dynamics of the ICT state H-bond formation, the assignment of the H-bonding-promoted IC, the relative efficiency of the H-bonding-promoted IC vs. the competing ISC in the protic solvent, and how this can be regulated by factors such as the property of the solvent and the carboxyl alkyl substitution in the ester group. The triplet state of the closely related aromatic carbonyls is known for being able to mediate through energy transfer the formation of a range of reactive intermediates, e.g., singlet oxygen22,23 and CPDs,24,25 which may cause direct or indirect damage to DNA.2,16,26,27 On the other hand, it is well recognized that the IC proceeding on an ultrafast timescale (<∼1 ps) is responsible for the remarkable photostability of the nucleic bases for protection against the UVR.28,29 In view of this, in order to resolve the above-mentioned issues, it is important to understand the fundamentally important ICT and H-bonding dynamics, but it is also crucial to assess the photo-suitability and clarify the “sunscreen controversy” regarding EHDMABA.
Herein, we report a broadband femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence (fs-TRF) complemented with a transient absorption (fs-TA) study to enable a full probe of the excited state evolution of the sunscreen agent EHDMABA and its comparison with MDMABA and EDMABA (Scheme 1). To examine the effects of solvent on the excited state dynamics, the study was performed in three typical solvents: the aprotic solvent CH3CN (dielectric constant ε = 36.64), the protic solvent CH3OH (ε = 33.0), and an aqueous solution that features high polarity (ε = 80.1) and strong H-bonding capacity. The results provide the direct observation of solvation dynamics for the formation of solute–solvent H-bonding induced by the ICT reaction. Real-time evidence is also unveiled on how the presence of H-bonding may lead to the operation of the otherwise absent IC on a rapid timescale and exceptionally high yield, while excluding or restraining the competing ISC and, therefore, the production of 3ππ*T. A comparison of the results from EHDMABA, MDMABA, and EDMABA shows that the rate of IC varies with the alkoxy substituent in the ester moiety and its efficiency is affected by the H-bonding capacity of the solvent. The data obtained ascertain that the photo-suitability of EHDMABA as a sunscreen is governed solely by the environmental factors. Although it is a potential photosensitizer for DNA damage in an organic solvent like CH3CN, this molecule can provide highly efficient photo-protection against the UVB irradiation in conditions of hydration.
Methods
Methyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (MDMABA) and ethyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EDMABA) were purchased from Aldrich, and 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDMABA) from Aladdin. Spectroscopic grade acetonitrile (CH3CN) and methanol (CH3OH) were purchased from Tedia, while deuterium oxide (D2O) and isotopic methanol including methanol-d1 (CH3OD) and methanol-d4 (CD3OD) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Double deionized water (H2O) was obtained from MILLIPORE (Milli-Q Synthesis). All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Steady-state UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence were measured using a Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer and Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer, respectively.
Time-resolved measurements were performed based on a commercial Ti:Sapphire femtosecond regenerative amplifier laser system and a home-built ultrafast broadband TRF, TRF anisotropy (TRFA) and TA spectrometer described in detail elsewhere.20,21,26,30 In brief, the 300 nm excitation pulse was generated by an optical parametric amplifier pumped by part of the optical regenerative amplifier 800 nm output fundamental. The excitation pulse was focused on the sample and traveled a fixed optical path. The residual part of the 800 nm fundamental output passed the optical delay line and was introduced as a gating beam to drive a Kerr-gate device for acquiring broadband transient fluorescence signals in the TRF and TRFA measurements or for generation of the white light continuum (WLC) probe in the fs-TA experiment. The WLC, covering wavelengths from ∼300–700 nm, was produced by focusing the 800 nm beam onto a rotating calcium fluoride plate for the experiments with MDMABA and EDMABA, and onto a non-rotating calcium fluoride plate for the experiment with EHDMABA. Prior to the conduction of the fs-TA experiments, the purity of the polarization direction of the generated WLC was ensured by either the rotating or non-rotating calcium fluoride plate. This was to avoid fluctuation in the polarization character of the WLC, which would likely arise due to the rotation of the calcium fluoride plate.31a Benzene solution in a 1 mm path-length quartz cell was used as the Kerr medium for operation of the Kerr-gate device. All transient signals were collected and were detected by a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. The polarization of the excitation laser was set at a magic angle with respect to the polarization direction of the first Kerr gate polarizer in the TRF and to the WLC in the TA measurement, respectively. The instrument response function (IRF) for the measurement is wavelength dependent, from being ∼0.5 ps to 2 ps with the emission wavelength changing from ∼650 to 300 nm, ∼0.15 ps to 0.25 ps for TA as the wavelength varies from 700 to 300 nm. Spectral calibration was made to eliminate wavelength-dependent time shifts caused by the group velocity dispersion in both in the fs-TA and fs-TRF measurements.
For the measurement of fs-TRFA, at a designated delay time (t), the transient fluorescence produced with the polarization of the excitation laser set to be parallel and perpendicular to the first polarizer of the Kerr gate device was collected as Ipara(t) and Iperp(t) respectively. The TRFA at that time delay, r(t), was then calculated according to eqn (1):20,21,30b,31b (1)
For all the time-resolved measurements, sample solution with a concentration of ∼1–2 mM was circulated through a ∼0.5 mm path-length calcium fluoride window-equipped flow cell for ensuring fresh sample at each laser shot. To eliminate unwanted multi-photon or saturation effects, the energy of the pump laser beam was kept low with a typical laser pulse peak power of ∼2 GW cm−2. The sample solution examined by UV-Visible absorption before and after the time-resolved measurements revealed no degradation during time-resolved experiments. All measurements were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Results and discussion
A. Steady-state spectroscopy

Fig. 1 displays steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra recorded with EHDMABA in CH3CN, CH3OH, CH3OD and in mixed solvents with 70%H2O/30%CH3CN and 70%D2O/30%CH3CN. The mixed solvents were used due to the minute solubility of the sample in neat water. In all these solvents, the absorption spectra are similar, featuring a strong lowest energy absorption band having the extinction coefficient (ε) of ∼21000–25000 and at wavelengths from ∼280 to 340 nm. The absorption maximum (λa) is slightly red-shifted upon changing solvent from CH3CN (λa ∼ 308 nm) to CH3OH or CH3OD (λa ∼ 310 nm) and to the mixed water solution (λa ∼ 315 nm). Analogous spectra were observed with MDMABA and EDMABA in the various solvents (Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†) and Table 1). The absorption band was due to two closely lying strongly allowed ππ* transitions associating to the La and Lb states in the Platt's nomenclature32 with the polarization directly along and perpendicular to the long molecular axis, respectively (Scheme 1).33

In each of the solvents examined, the fluorescence from EHDMABA (Fig. 1) features a spectrum similar to those from MDMABA and EDMABA (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The spectra in all the solvents exhibited dual fluorescence with the “blue” component at the shorter wavelengths emanating from the LE state and the “red” component at long wavelengths from the ICT state.20,21 As a general observation, comparison of the spectra in the different solvents showed that changing the solvent from CH3CN to CH3OH and then to 70%H2O/30%CH3CN progressively red-shifted the LE and ICT fluorescence. This was accompanied by a sizable decrease in the relative intensity of the fluorescence from the ICT to the LE state, as well as a notable lowering in the overall fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) of the dual emission spectra (Table 1). As with EHDMABA, the maximum of the LE (λLEf) and ICT fluorescence (λICTf) shifted respectively from ∼343 and 507 nm in CH3CN to ∼354 and 557 nm in CH3OH and to ∼360 and 587 nm in the largely water-containing solvent. In the meanwhile, the Φf declined, being respectively ∼15 and 30-fold lower in CH3OH (∼3.0 × 10−3) and water (∼1.4 × 10−3) than in CH3CN (∼4.1 × 10−2). This is associated with the corresponding decrease in the relative contribution of ICT fluorescence and, according to analysis based on the log-normal deconvolution of the dual emission spectra (SI), is accounted for by a large drop in the ICT fluorescence quantum yield (ΦICTf), which was derived to be 3.67 × 10−2 in CH3CN, 2.24 × 10−3 in CH3OH, and 9.1 × 10−4 in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN.
Given the different properties of these solvents, it is clear that increasing the solvent polarity and the H-bonding capacity may not only lead to the energetic stabilization of the LE and ICT states but also to strongly quenching the fluorescence from the ICT state. It is noted in this regard that the spectra in the deuterated solvents (CH3OD and 70% D2O/CH3CN) showed a slight (by ∼1.2 time) increase in the Φf and ΦICTf when compared to those in the corresponding ordinary solvent (Table 1). This solvent deuteration effect substantiates the importance of solute–solvent interactions through the specific H-bonding with the solvent hydroxyl proton as being responsible for the fluorescence quenching and the nonradiative decay of the ICT state.
B. Femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
To unveil the dynamics underlying the influence of solvent on the excited state processes, the steady-state fluorescence in the varied solvents were time-resolved and the TRF spectra recorded as a function of time after the photo-excitation are depicted in Fig. 2 for EHDMABA and in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†) for MDMABA and EDMABA. Due to the rapid and large depletion of the TRF intensity, the spectra observed at the early (0–4 ps) and the late times (>∼4 ps) after excitation are displayed separately for clarity. It can be seen that irrespective of the solvent, the initial TRF features a strong fluorescence band at the wavelengths corresponding to the emission from the LE state (Fig. 2(a, c and e)). The LE fluorescence decayed rapidly in several picoseconds, evolving into a much weaker and largely red-shifted fluorescence arising due to the ICT state. In CH3CN and CH3OH, the decay of LE fluorescence is concomitant with a growth in the ICT fluorescence (insets in Fig. 2(a and c)), indicating a precursor–successor relationship between the two states rendered by the nonradiative process corresponding to the ICT reaction. In 70%H2O/30%CH3CN, the decay of LE fluorescence led to no increase in the ICT fluorescence, implying a weakly emissive nature of the ICT state in this solvent when compared with that in CH3CN and CH3OH.21
 Fig. 2  Time-resolved fluorescence spectra of EHDMABA recorded at (a) 0–4 ps (0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.85, 1.25, 1.75, 2.5, 4 ps) and (b) 4–6000 ps (4, 125, 600, 1250, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 ps) in CH3CN; (c) 0–4 ps (0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.85, 1.25, 1.75, 2.5, 4 ps) and (d) 4–1000 ps (4, 5, 7, 12.5, 20, 40, 85, 175, 300, 1000 ps) in CH3OH; (e) 0–4 ps (0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.85, 1.25, 1.75, 2.5, 4 ps) and (f) 4–500 ps (4, 8.5, 15, 35, 60, 85, 150, 500 ps) in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN after photo-excitation. The scale of the “relative intensity” is enlarged ∼12.5 times in (b) relative to (a), (d) relative to (c) and (f) relative to (e). The insets in (a), (c) and (e) show the magnified views of the corresponding spectra. The arrows indicate the direction of the spectral evolution. 
The ICT fluorescence upon formation exhibited decay and relaxation in a time scale that varied strongly depending on the solvent (Fig. 2(b, d and f)). In CH3CN, the fluorescence decayed relatively slowly in the thousands picosecond time regime (Fig. 2(b)), while in CH3OH (Fig. 2(d)) and 70%H2O/30%CH3CN (Fig. 2(f)), the decay of the fluorescence was remarkably faster, occurring in the hundreds picosecond timescale. Prior to the decay, the fluorescence exhibited extensive dynamic Stokes shifts (DSSs), manifested by the progressive red-shift in the wavelength of the TRF maximum from ∼470 nm at 4 ps to 540 nm at 40 ps in CH3OH (Fig. 2(d)) or from ∼535 nm at 2.5 ps to 560 nm at 5 ps in the largely water containing solvent (inset in Fig. 2(e)).
For EHDMABA in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN, measurement of fs-TRFA performed at delay times (e.g., 0.5 and 5 ps) when spectra containing fluorescence contributed significantly from both the LE and ICT states showed TRFA spectra with the values of anisotropy independent of the emission wavelength (Fig. S5, ESI†). This implies that the two states possess a common direction of the fluorescence polarization.18,20,21,34 In view of the inherent La parentage of the ICT state,18–21 it is evident that the LE state must also be of La character with the transition dipole being orientated along the long molecular axis. In light of this, the ICT reaction can be identified as occurring in the same La hyper-potential energy surface (HPES) as the observed LE and ICT fluorescence emanating from two local minima, with altered structures probably described by the TICT model as suggested by our DFT and TDDFT study with MDMABA.21
Global analysis of the kinetic decays of TRF intensities at wavelengths representative of the LE (e.g. ∼360 nm) and ICT fluorescence (e.g. ∼550 nm) was performed to derive time constants for the ICT reaction and the relaxation as well as lifetime of the ICT state (Fig. 3). The rate of ICT reaction, as reflected by the rapid decay of LE fluorescence in all the solvents and the concurrent growth of ICT fluorescence in CH3CN and CH3OH, was found to feature a time constant of ∼0.7 ps in CH3CN and 70%H2O/30%CH3CN and ∼0.9 ps in CH3OH (Fig. 3(a) and Table 1). The decay of the ICT state is strongly solvent dependent, with its lifetime determined to be ∼2.7 ns in CH3CN, ∼140 ps in CH3OH and ∼70 ps in the water containing solvent (Fig. 3(b) and Table 1). It is noticeable at this point that in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN, the early time decay profile of ICT fluorescence exhibited no growth component concomitant with the depletion of LE fluorescence (Fig. 3(a)). However, the profile featured a bi-exponential decay with a time constant corresponding respectively to the rate of ICT reaction and the lifetime of ICT state in this solvent. The lack of growth component with the ICT fluorescence, in this case, is attributable to the combined effect of the weakly emissive nature of the ICT state and the much shorter lifetime of the ICT in this solvent than in CH3CN and in CH3OH.
 Fig. 3  Experimental and fitted time profiles of fs-TRF at indicated wavelengths (a) at early time delay for EHDMABA in CH3CN (black), CH3OH (red), and 70%H2O/30%CH3CN (blue). (b) The comparison of ∼550 nm fs-TRF of EHDMABA in CH3CN (Δ), CH3OH (□), CH3OD (■), 70%H2O/30%CH3CN (○) and 70%D2O/30%CH3CN (●) at late time delay up to ∼1 ns after the photoexcitation. 
Analysis of TRF data obtained in the deuterated solvents (Fig. S6, ESI†) showed identical time constants for the ICT reaction but a longer lifetime of the ICT state, being ∼210 ps in CH3OD and ∼96 ps in 70%D2O/30%CH3CN, in comparison to that in the respective ordinary solvent. This difference in the ICT state lifetime corresponds to a kinetic isotope effect (K.I.E.) of ∼1.5 in CH3OH and ∼1.4 in the largely water-containing solvent. Such an observation provides explicit evidence for the direct involvement of the solvent hydroxyl proton in the deactivation of the ICT state, explaining the much reduced Φf and the quenching of ICT fluorescence in the protic compared to the aprotic solvent (Table 1).
Aside from the ICT reaction and decay of the ICT state population, the observation of DSSs implies that before the decay of the population, the nascent ICT state progresses to lower energy through processes such as loss of vibrational energy and conformational change in the state, and dynamic reorganization of solvent molecules to accommodate the rapidly increasing dipole moment of the molecule induced by the sub-picosecond ICT reaction.36,37 However, the inclusion of DSSs caused complex fluorescence dynamics on the associated timescale, rendering the time profile of TRF intensity to be strongly wavelength-dependent, exhibiting slower decay or even containing a rising component at lower energy emission wavelength (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). To assess the nature and to quantify the dynamics of the solvation, Fig. 4(a) displays the DSSs observed in CH3OH, illustrated as changing with time for the ICT state maximum fluorescence wavelength obtained from the log-normal analysis of the TRF spectra (Fig. 4(b), details in ESI†). The DSSs can be fitted to a biexponential with a time constant of ∼1.2 and 13.4 ps (Fig. 4(a) and Table 1). This time constant is close to the ∼1.0 and ∼7–12 ps solvent relaxation dynamics corresponding to the rotation reorientation of the hydroxyl group around the C–O bond in CH3OH and the reorientation motion of the alcohol molecule, respectively, in literature.31,35–37 Moreover, the ∼13.4 ps component also coincides with the ∼12 ps process reported for H-bonding formation between the solvent molecule and photo-excited N-acetyltryptophanamide in CH3OH.38a Parallel analysis of the DSSs in CH3OD showed similar biexponential dynamics featuring time constants of ∼1.3 and 15.4 ps. The second time constant (∼15.4 ps) is evidently longer than that in CH3OH (∼13.4 ps), which provides further support for its connection to the motion of hydroxyl protons during the solvation process.

(b) Comparison of the experimental data (○) and the best fit of the log-normal simulation (solid line) of the TRF spectra from EHDMABA at ∼3 ps after excitation in CH3OH. 
In CH3OH, the DSSs reflect microscopic solvation for the specific solute–solvent H-bonding between the hydroxyl proton of the solvent molecule(s) and most likely the carbonyl and/or carboxyl oxygen in the acceptor group of the ICT state resulting from their enhanced electron density caused by the ICT reaction. Such H-bonded ICT states (denoted as HICT state hereafter) can be considered as a type of species differing distinctively from the ICT state that experienced mainly the nonspecific solvation as the case in CH3CN (Fig. 2(b)). Given the comparable dielectric property of CH3CN (dielectric constant ε = 36.64) and CH3OH (ε = 33.0), the HICT state present in CH3OH but not in CH3CN is responsible for the further stabilization, shorter lifetime, and lower quantum yield of the ICT fluorescence in the former compared to the latter solvent (Fig. 3(b) and Table 1).
From Fig. 2(e), it can be seen that the DSSs in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN proceeded on a timescale of several picoseconds. The solvation of water in bulk solution is known to be extremely rapid36 (<∼50 fs), beyond the time-resolution of our current measurement. In the light of this, the DSSs, which were accompanied by some narrowing of the TRF bandwidth, are mainly attributable to the conformational and vibrational relaxation of the HICT state, which corresponds to H-bonded complexes formed by the interaction of water with the ICT state molecules. It is worth noting that the ICT fluorescence in CH3CN also exhibited bandwidth narrowing and a small degree of DSSs on the timescale of several picoseconds. Given the rapid solvation time of CH3CN (∼0.26 ps solvation time),36 the spectral variation may also originate from conformational and vibrational relaxations that were due to “isolated” ICT state molecules after the rapid solvation. It is pertinent at this point that the involvement of solute–solvent H-bonding in the HICT state implies a tendency toward preferential solvation of the solute molecule by the protic solvent. In view of this and earlier studies on the impact of preferential solvation on solute excited states,30c,38b the dynamics of HICT observed here in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN and 70%D2O/30%CH3CN are most likely due to the predominance and the role of the solvent water molecules, rather than acetonitrile molecules, in the solute solvation shell as a result of the large water content in the mixed solvent.
Compared to the results from EHDMABA, kinetic analysis of the fs-TRF from MDMABA and EDMABA observed nearly identical rates for the ICT reaction, similar quenching effects on the ICT fluorescence in the solvent from the aprotic CH3CN to the protic CH3OH and 70%H2O/30%CH3CN, and analogous solvation dynamics for the HICT state formation in CH3OH and CH3OD (Fig. S7, S8 (ESI†) and Table 1). There is, however, clear variation in the lifetimes of the ICT and HICT states. The ICT state lifetime in CH3CN decreased from ∼2.7 ns for EHDMABA to ∼2.6 and 1.9 ns for EDMABA and MDMABA, respectively. In the protic solvents, the HICT states of EDMABA and MDMABA featured the same lifetime (∼120 ps in CH3OH, ∼50 ps in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN), which was shorter than the lifetime of the EHDMABA counterpart (∼140 ps in CH3OH, ∼70 ps in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN) in the corresponding solvent. Therefore, increasing the carboxyl alkyl chain length from methyl and ethyl to ethyl–hexyl (Scheme 1) slows down the deactivation rate of the (H)ICT state.
C. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
For further characterization and to directly probe the pathways underlying the decay of ICT and HICT states, comparative fs-TA measurements were conducted, and the spectra obtained with EHDMABA in CH3CN, CH3OH and 70%H2O/30%CH3CN are shown in Fig. 5 and with MDMABA and EDMABA in CH3CN and CH3OH in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†). Promptly after the excitation, all these systems exhibited spectra from the LE state, displaying excited state absorption (ESA) peaking at ∼340 nm, along with broad ESA across ∼400–650 nm and a negative signal at ∼370 nm due to the stimulated emission (SE) from the LE state (Fig. 5(a, c, e) and Fig. S9(a, c), S10(a, c), ESI†). Such spectra evolved rapidly into an alternative profile with dual ESA at ∼340 and 465 nm accompanied by the formation of an isosbestic point at ∼510 nm. This spectral change, as indicated by kinetic fitting of the decay of the LE state ESA at ∼560 nm and the rising of the newly formed ∼465 nm ESA (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11, ESI†), is described by a time constant exactly matching the rate of ICT reaction observed in the above fs-TRF study (Fig. 3(a) and Table 1). The dual ESA spectra can thus be attributed to the absorption characteristic of the ICT state of each compound in the respective solvents.
 Fig. 5  Temporal evolution of the transient absorption spectra of EHDMABA in CH3CN recorded at (a) 0–10 ps (0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 10 ps), (b) 10–6000 ps (10, 300, 850, 1500, 2500, 3500, 6000 ps); in CH3OH, recorded at (c) 0–20 ps (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.85, 1.5, 3, 20 ps) and (d) 20–6000 ps (20, 60, 100, 175, 250, 400, 6000 ps); and in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN recorded at (e) 0–10 ps (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 3, 10 ps), (f) 10–6000 ps (10, 30, 60, 85, 125, 150, 250, 6000 ps) after photo-excitation. The arrows indicate the direction of the temporal evolution of the spectra. 
From Fig. 5(b, d, f) and Fig. S9(b, d), S10(b, d), S11 (ESI†), it is clear that the ∼340 and 465 nm ICT state spectra after formation exhibited remarkably different transformation in the aprotic vs. the protic solvents. In CH3CN, the spectrum from EHDMABA was converted at the rate of the ICT state fluorescence lifetime into a feature possessing one single ESA band with the maximum at ∼440 nm, and the conversion produced two isosbestic points at ∼360 and 500 nm (Fig. 5(b)). The ∼440 nm feature was from a long-lived species showing no decay by 6 ns, the longest accessible delay time after the photo-excitation. The spectrum of ∼440 nm ESA was found to resemble the absorption of the 3ππ* triplet state (T1), which we previously reported for MDMABA in CH3CN.20 The corresponding species can thus be ascribed to the 3ππ*T1 of EHDMABA generated by ISC from the ICT state as the precursor.
Aside from the ESAs and the SE, the TA spectra at the various decay times also contain negative signals at ∼315 nm, due to bleaching of the ground state (S0) absorption caused by the photo-excitation (Fig. 5(b, d and f)). One important observation is that with EHDMABA in CH3CN, the S0 bleaching signal remained nearly constant throughout the detection time window involving the formation and decay of the ICT state. This is indicative of a close to unitary efficiency for both the ICT reaction and the ISC from the ICT state to yield the 3ππ*T1 state. Taking into account the quantum efficiency of the radiative decay from both the LE and ICT states (Φf = ∼4.1 × 10−2, Table 1), the yield of ISC and 3ππ*T1 formation from EHDMABA in CH3CN can be estimated to be ∼95.9%. From this and the lifetime (2.7 ns) as well as the radiative rate (∼1.36 × 107 s−1) of the ICT state (Table 1), the rate of ISC (kISC) can be estimated to be ∼3.57 × 108 s−1 for EHDMABA. Analogous analysis obtained a similar rate for the case of MDMABA (kISC = 5.15 × 108 s−1) and EDMABA (kISC = 3.75 × 108 s−1) in CH3CN.
In the protic solvents, the ∼340 and 465 nm dual ESA spectra, associating after the solvation to the HICT state, exhibited decay with the rate of the HICT fluorescence lifetime leading to nearly no observation of the 3ππ*T1 spectra in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN (Fig. 5(f)) and only a minute involvement of this spectrum in CH3OH (Fig. 5(d)). The decay was, however, unveiled to correlate with an almost full recovery of the S0 bleaching signal in the case of 70%H2O/30%CH3CN (Fig. 6). Such a correlation provides direct evidence for the deactivation of the HICT state through the nonradiative internal conversion (IC), leading to a reformation of the S0 state, bypassing the ISC and the 3ππ*T1 formation as involved in CH3CN. On the basis of this and the lifetime of the HICT state, the rate of IC (kIC) can be estimated to be ∼1.42 × 1010 s−1 with EHDMABA and slightly faster with MDMABA (∼2.01 × 1010 s−1) and EDMABA (∼2.06 × 1010 s−1) in the largely water-containing solvent.
 Fig. 6  The transient absorption decay profiles of EHDMABA in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN (●, ○), CH3OH (■, □) and CH3CN (▲, Δ) at 460 nm (●, ■, ▲) and 315 nm (○, □, Δ) at times up to ∼1 ns after the photoexcitation. 
A comparison of the late time TA spectra in CH3OH and in CH3CN suggests that the 3ππ*T1 formation efficiency in the former solvent is less than ∼20% (Fig. 6). Given the lack of photochemistry, this implies a rate of more than ∼5.7 × 109 s−1 for the IC in CH3OH. The magnitudes of kIC in both 70%H2O/30%CH3CN and CH3OH are several tens to hundreds fold greater than that of kISC, explaining the little or largely reduced involvement of the 3ππ*T1 in these solvents. The large rate and high efficiency of the IC, which are not available in CH3CN, are clearly promoted due to the solute–solvent H-bonding in the HICT state. The K.I.E. exhibited by the decay of the HICT state manifests a direct participation of the H-bonding in the reaction coordinates for the nonradiative transition of the IC decay.
Summary and remarks
The results of the steady-state spectra and the fs-TRF complemented by the fs-TA data put together allow the establishment of distinctive deactivation cascades for the benzoate esters under study (Scheme 2). Upon photoexcitation, the photo-prepared LE state is deactivated through LE → ICT → 3T in the aprotic solvent CH3CN20 and through LE → ICT → HICT → S0 in the largely water-containing solvent. In CH3OH, aside from the main channel of decay into S0, a small fraction of the HICT population is deactivated via the competing ISC to form the 3T (LE → ICT → HICT → S0 (∼80%) + 3T (∼20%)).
 Scheme 2  Proposed nonradiative decay pathways of EHDMABA in CH3CN, CH3OH and largely aqueous solution (H2O). Dotted arrows refer to processes due to the solvation of the nascent formed ICT state. 
These pathways are common in the very rapid rate (∼0.7–0.9 ps) of the ICT reaction but they differ in the rate and decay pathway of the ICT state. The ICT state undergoes ISC with a nearly unitary yield to give ππ*3T in CH3CN, while, in the protic solvents, dynamic solvation of the nascent ICT state with the solvation structure largely for the S0 state generates the HICT state that gains enhanced H-bonding with the hydroxyl protons of solvent molecules. This state is primarily depopulated through IC, leading to the direct recovery of the S0 while eliminating (in 70%H2O/30%CH3CN) or strongly restraining (in CH3OH) the ISC and ππ*3T formation (Fig. 6). The strengthening of the H-bonding interaction was driven by the large increase in the dipole moment in the ICT (12.43 D) from the S0 (4.00 D) and LE (6.16 D) states39 and instantly increased electron density at the acceptor site. This makes the electronegative carboxylic oxygen atoms more electron rich and better acceptors for the H-bonding with the solvent hydroxyl protons.40,41 Our very recent density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) on the MDMABA-obtained structure for the HICT state in water was found to feature a perpendicular orientation between the DMA and the ring planes and with the formation of H-bonds to water molecules at both the carbonyl and the acyl oxygens of the ester group.21 The calculated H-bonding stabilization energy in the HICT is much greater than that in the S0, and the H-bonding was observed to account for the additional DSSs exhibited by the ICT fluorescence in the solvent from CH3CN to 70%H2O/30%CH3CN. Note that the bond lengths of the HICT H-bonds were computed to be ∼1.8–1.9 Å, which are clearly too large to be considered for the likely involvement of proton transfer in the HICT state.
More importantly, by introducing an effective “accepting mode” for the dissipation of the electronic excitation energy, the H-bonding enables the otherwise unavailable IC to rapidly quench the excited state population.42 This is supported by the direct correlation between the HICT decay and the S0 recovery, and is ascertained by the K.I.E. (∼1.5) exhibited by the decay of the HICT state in the deuterated vs. ordinary solvent (Fig. 3(b) and Table 1). It is worth noting that an earlier theoretical study on closely related systems unveiled the importance of H-bonding with a protic solvent of the ICT state in quenching its fluorescence and facilitating the IC nonradiative deactivation.40 The high frequency and large vibrational energy of the solvent hydroxyl O–H stretching motion makes it highly capable of mediating, through H-bonding, the electronic-to-vibrational energy transfer required for the operation of the nonradiative IC transition.43–46 The K.I.E. and the slower rate of HICT decay in the deuterated solvent is accounted for by the lower frequency of the O–D stretching (∼2500 cm−1) than O–H stretching (∼3350 cm−1) and thereby, the reduced efficiency of the energy transfer in the deuterated solvent.47 It follows that in the protic environment, the solvent molecules are not just spectators but are involved and in fact control the course of the solute excited state deactivation. The systems studied here represent prominent examples where the excited state dynamics are strongly regulated depending on the H-bonding capacity of the local microenvironment. This may have important implications in both the fundamental applications of these compounds and in sunscreen.
First, in view of the largely different solvation times of CH3CN, H2O and CH3OH, the observation of the rapid and solvent independent ICT time constant implies that the ICT reaction is most probably an inner-sphere process associated with a minute reaction barrier and controlled largely by the intramolecular structural change. The change in structure may contain twisting of the DMA donor with respect to the molecular plane of the benzene ester acceptor, but involves little variation in the ester group as suggested by the very similar ICT time constant from the three molecules, despite the different lengths of their carboxyl alkyl chains (Scheme 1). This is in line with the perspective of the TICT model suggesting that the rotation of the DMA donor is more relevant than the variation in the acceptor group for the structure of the ICT state.18,48,49 Aromatic carbonyl compounds, including the close analogues such as p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and p-dimethylaminoacetophenone, possess inherently low-lying nπ* states allowing highly efficient ISC at timescales approaching the picosecond and even sub-picosecond regime.18,42,50 With the compounds studied here in CH3CN, the rapid ICT reaction and the resulting low energy ICT state removes the nπ* state from the early time deactivation, rendering the ISC to proceed from the ICT state at a lower rate, yet with close to unitary efficiency likely mediated by the nπ* state in the triplet manifold.20,42
Secondly, the high yield of the ISC and the 3ππ*T1 state in the aprotic solvent may contribute importantly to the adverse photocarcinogenic events reported in some in vitro tests on p-aminobenzoate type sunscreen.15,16a This is because the 3ππ*T1 states of analogous aromatic compounds are known for being able to sensitize the pyrimidine bases to form mutagenic photo-lesions such as CPDs in DNA.2,24,25 The 3ππ*T1 state, due to its multiplicity and long lifetime may, in ambient conditions, also lead to the photosensitized production of the singlet oxygen. This reactive species in a cellular environment can attach to nucleobases, especially guanine, because of its low oxidation potential leading to the generation of various intermediates, including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), which may alter replication.2,22,23 These photo-products in DNA are the major causes of a range of cellular damage and mutations, intimately relevant to skin aging and the onset of skin cancer.2,16,26,27 Of note, the CPDs and singlet oxygen formation are exactly those identified in the in vitro studies to account for the photo-damaging effects of DMABA-type sunscreen molecules.15,16a
On the other hand, the rapid IC rendered by the HICT state in the water-containing solvent allows an effective pathway for excitation elimination, providing these molecules with high degrees of photo-stability and ability for photoprotection. The IC converts the HICT state electronic energy into the benign S0 vibrational or “heat” energy that then flows to the surrounding solvent molecules for energy dissipation and thermalization. The fast rate of this process (∼70 ps) excludes the ISC and so the 3ππ*T1 formation removes the possibility of introducing photoproducts as is the case with CH3CN. Since water is a commonly involved ingredient in sunscreen products and the aqueous environment is close to physiological conditions, rapid IC promoted by H-bonding with water molecules supplies an interpretation at the molecular level for the photo-protecting effect observed earlier in some in vivo tests on benzoate sunscreen.16 It is essential in this regard that according to our data, the exact rate of the IC varies with both the solvent H-bonding donating capacity and the bulkiness of the carboxyl alkyl chain in the benzoate esters. The process is facilitated by less bulky alkyl chains and in solvents of higher H-bonding capacity. This observation reinforces the decisive role of the site-specific solute–solvent H-bonding in allowing the associated radiationless transition, and suggests that the bulky alkoxycarbonyl group in EHDMABA may sterically affect the H-bonding and is responsible for its modestly reduced rate of the IC (∼70 ps) compared to that from methyl and ethyl groups (∼50 ps) in the same solvent.
Note that with EHDMABA in CH3OH, due to the lowered rate of the IC (∼140 ps), a substantial fraction (∼20%) of the excitation was transferred via ISC to the 3ππ*T1 state (Fig. 6). This implies that unlike the nearly unitary efficiency of the photoprotection in water, when EHDMABA is applied in alcohol containing conditions it could be destructive and may cause a certain degree of DNA photodamage.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that fluorescence quenching and IC deactivation caused by ICT-induced solute–solvent H-bonding are widely recognized phenomena that have already been observed in quite a number of systems including the prototype ICT molecule DMABN,41 fluorenone,37,51 and o-aminoacetophenone52 and many of their derivatives53,54 examined mostly in alcoholic solvents. However, compared to these reported cases, the rates of IC exhibited by the molecules studied here are significantly faster, and those observed in the water containing solvents (∼1.42 × 1010 s−1) appear to be the fastest rates of this kind, to the best of our knowledge. For example, in CH3OH, the ∼5.7 × 109 s−1 IC rate from EHDMABA is about one order faster than that from DMABN (∼3.1 × 108 s−1)41 and four-fold faster than o-aminoacetophenone (∼1.5 × 109 s−1)52 in the same solvent. The rapid rates of IC reflect remarkably strong solute–solvent H-bonding and the significantly high efficiency of this interaction in mediating the IC transition. This may be due to the ester group being a good electron acceptor (better than the cyano in DMABN),18 and after the ICT reaction it can serve as an excellent acceptor for H-bonding formation. Another important factor is that instead of a single active site for H-bonding in most of the earlier studied systems,41,51–54 the ester group can provide two active sites, corresponding to the carbonyl oxygen (CO) and the acyl oxygen (C–O), for the bonding interaction with solvent molecules.21 Therefore, aside from the efficacy of photoprotection in water-containing conditions, these benzoate esters should also prove useful as highly sensitive fluorescence probes for the detection of H-bonding properties in the microenvironment.
