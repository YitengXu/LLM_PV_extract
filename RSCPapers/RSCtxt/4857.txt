    , Accepted 7th January 2021First published on 25th January 2021AbstractThere exists a tendency in the research of up-conversion materials to shift the excitation from 980 nm to multiple excitation wavelengths. A series of GdVO4:Ln3+ with similar sizes and irregular prism morphology were successfully prepared by a co-precipitation technique. A wide multi-color emission corresponding to different Ln3+ doping was also obtained under single excitation. It is worth pointing out that among all the studied samples, only the emission intensity of GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ excited at two-wavelengths (980 nm + 1550 nm) simultaneously was enhanced by a factor of 1.87, compared to the sum of emission intensities excited at two single-wavelengths separately. Moreover, to further enhance the up-conversion luminescence intensity, cation ions (Lu3+/Y3+) and anion ions (PO43−) were also doped into the host, and the luminous intensity was also improved to a certain extent. A possible mechanism for energy transfer and possible transitions were also suggested and discussed in detail using an energy level diagram. In addition, not only a high record value of Sa (0.0069 K−1) but also a high Sr (1.13% K−1) is achieved for GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ in the physiological temperature range (273–453 K). Combining a much intensified dual-wavelength up-conversion signal and good temperature-sensing properties, this work can be extended to the surges of other lanthanide ion doped systems pumped by using multiple-wavelength lasers, and can also open new possibilities for up-conversion color displays and anti-counterfeiting applications.
1. Introduction
Up-conversion (UC) can convert two or more low energy photons under near-infrared (NIR) light and then emit one high energy photon with a large anti-Stokes shift, long lifetime, and low excitation power density. Consequently, rare-earth (RE) doped up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) attract considerable interest in diverse research fields ranging from solid state lasers to three-dimensional displays, anti-counterfeiting technology, biological imaging and solar cells.1–7 However, challenges still exist, and their low up-conversion luminescence (UCL) efficiency greatly limits their practical applications. To date, great efforts have been made to overcome the above obstacles and to enhance the UCL of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, such as impurity doping, design of core–shell structures, multi-wavelength excitation, surface chemistry, etc.8–10 By comparison, the modification of the local crystal field symmetry of Ln3+ embedded in the host materials through impurity doping has been demonstrated to be more simple and effective. It is widely reported that Ln3+ ion, alkali ion or alkaline-earth metal doping is a facile way to modify the crystallization properties, such as the size, distribution and structure of nanocrystals. For example, Cheng reported that the doping of Ca2+ into the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystal could improve the UCL intensity by about 200 times.11 Chen et al. pointed out that a larger enhancement of the UC emission was achieved in Y2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals via tri-doping of Li+.12 Guo reported that the red UCL intensity of the BiPO4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystal can be improved by 267 times by Sc3+ doping.13 In stark contrast, as far as we know, the reported dopants for adjusting the local crystal field symmetry in UC nanomaterials are mostly cations, and few investigations focused on anion doping. On the other hand, it is a key factor that excitation with two- or multi-wavelength light which matches well with the energies of ground state absorption (GSA) and excited state absorption (ESA) would be another effective approach for fluorescence enhancement. An enhanced UCL intensity has been obtained with different combinations of two lasers (1510 nm and 980 nm or 808 nm and 980 nm). The green and red emissions from NaYF4:1%Er nanoparticles excited at two-wavelengths simultaneously were enhanced by factors of 3.05 and 1.53 by Chen et al., respectively.14 Zhou et al. obtained enhanced UCL via two-wavelength excitation with the LaF3:Ho3+ phosphor.15 Wang's group used the coordinated excitation of two lasers (808 nm and 980 nm or 1510 nm and 980 nm) to avoid the non-radiative relaxation process, which boosted the intensity of green light and red light.16 Herein, there are reasons to believe that this new strategy of multi-wavelength excitation will be a practical way to increase the UC efficiency in the future.
In terms of selecting the host for UC materials, GdVO4 phosphors are more appealing due to their high water-resistant and unique luminescence characteristics. GdVO4 as a promising host for UCL has recently drawn considerable research interest owing to its unique properties, such as high photostability, large anti-Stokes shift, intense UC emission, and the ionic radius of Gd3+ which is large enough to be easily substituted with Ln3+, such as Y3+ or Lu3+. As far as we know, the research on UCL materials is mainly focused on GdVO4:Ln3+ excited at 808 nm and 980 nm, such as GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ excited at 980 nm, GdVO4:Yb3+/Ho3+ excited at 980 nm, GdVO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ excited at 980 nm, and GdVO4:Nd3+/Ho3+ and GdVO4:Nd3+/Er3+ excited at 808 nm.17–20 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the UCL properties of GdVO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ excited at 808 nm; moreover, along with the improvement of the high-power infrared diode laser technology and the widespread application of a 1550 nm solid laser, infrared visible UC materials with a high conversion efficiency at 1550 nm are becoming more and more important for the calibration and detection of solid lasers with different wavelengths and the application of infrared conversion, which demands urgent research in this domain.21–23 So far, little is known about UCL materials based on GdVO4:Ln3+ under excitation at 1550 nm.
Herein, we are motivated to conduct a comparative study on the UC emission properties of GdVO4:Ln3+ UCNPs under excitation at different wavelengths (single excitation at 980 nm/808 nm/1550 nm or multi-wavelengths of 980 nm and 1550 nm), and great efforts have been made to find new sensitizers with multiple effective excitation wavelengths. Moreover, not only the cation Gd3+ in the matrix lattice was replaced by Lu3+ or Y3+, but also the anionic VO43− group was substituted by PO43− in order to improve the intensity of UCL. The results show that the resultant phosphors have a promising prospect for application in anti-counterfeiting technologies and solar cell fields.
2. Experiment
An appropriate amount of NH4VO3 (1 mmol) was dissolved in NaOH solution, forming Na3VO4 with pH = 12. A mixture of nitrate aqueous solutions of Gd3+ ions and Ln3+/Yb3+ ions (0.5 mmol) in the corresponding stoichiometric ratio was afterwards added dropwise (1 drop per 3 sec) into the Na3VO4 solution. A milk white opalescent precipitate was obtained and then further heated and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h. The pH value of the milk-white suspension was about 9. In order to adjust the pH value to 7, the precipitate was then separated from the suspension by centrifugation, and washed out several times with distilled water. Finally, the powders of Gd1−x−yYbxLnyVO4 were collected and dried at 60 °C in air for 20 h. To further enhance the crystallinity, the as-prepared samples were calcined at 1000 °C for 2 h. Besides, the Y3+, Lu3+ and PO43− doped GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ samples were prepared by the same procedure.
3. Characterization
XRD was performed on the PANalytical X'Pert PRO powder at a scanning rate of 14° per min in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° with Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.5406 Å). SEM analysis was carried out using a Carl Zeiss Sigma-500 scanning electron microscope with a field emission gun operating at 3 kV. The UC fluorescence spectra were recorded on a HORIBA Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a near-infrared (NIR) laser with emissions from 980, 1550, and 808 nm laser diodes (LDs).
4. Results and discussion
For structural analysis, a series of GdVO4:Ln3+ were characterized by XRD and it can be observed that all the 13 synthesized products with different doping ions are highly crystalline in nature. The diffraction patterns for all of the Ln3+ doped samples were found to be identical to the reference data (JCPDS No. 17-0260), as shown in Fig. 1. Diffraction peaks from other phases do not appear, indicating that the Ln3+ (Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+/Nd3+/Tm3+) ions, whether single-, co-doped or tri-doped, were successfully and uniformly incorporated into the GdVO4 host lattice, which was ascribed to the fact that the radius and ionic charges of the dopants are similar to those of Gd3+.

Fig. 2 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of GdVO4:Ln3+ excited with a 980 nm laser diode. It could be found that 7 of the 13 prepared samples emit light. More specifically, it is obvious that among them, the sample with the highest luminous intensity is GdVO4:Yb3+,Tm3+, which emits blue emission centered at 477 nm, corresponding to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+; GdVO4:Yb3+,Ho3+ displayed a strong red emission at 647 nm (5F5 → 5I8), whereas a weak green emission at 544 nm (5S2/5F4 → 5I8); In stark contrast, GdVO4:Yb3+,Er3+ exhibited strong green emissions at 527 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 554 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2), and the red emission can be neglected in comparison with the green emission. For GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+, one series of emission peaks of the material are located within the range of 510 nm–670 nm, which correspond to the transitions of Er3+: 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (527 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (553 nm), and 5F5 → 5I8 (648 nm), respectively, where the strongest emission peak is located at 648 nm. As anticipated, GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+/Tm3+ showed the characteristic emission of Er3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+, respectively, while the order of luminescence intensity is red > green > blue light, which is opposite to the red, green and blue emission intensity sequence of a single doped sample. It is worth pointing out that compared with the Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped samples, GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Nd3+ showed a similar emission shape and red-green ratio to those of GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+, but the emission intensity is greatly reduced, which may be attributed to the quenching effect of Nd3+. It is well-known that the UCL under excitation at 980 nm generally requires the involvement of a sensitizer, Yb3+. If there is no sensitization agent, what will the luminescence under excitation at 980 nm be like? Two UC emission bands are observed in the range of 500–750 nm: a green one at approximately 527/554 nm and a red one at approximately 648 nm, and the green light is much stronger than the red light in GdVO4:Er3+/Ho3+. Other samples such as GdVO4:Er3+, GdVO4:Ho3+, GdVO4:Nd3+, GdVO4:Nd3+/Ho3+, and GdVO4:Nd3+/Er3+ show no emission upon excitation at 980 nm. To shed more light on the effects of doping ions on the UCL, in Fig. 2(b), the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the samples doped with different Ln3+ ions are shown. The UC emissions range from yellow to green, blue and red, depending on the kinds and combination of doped ions.

For comparison, the UCL properties of the above discussed samples under excitation at 1550 nm were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Only the GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+, GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+, GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+/Tm3+, GdVO4:Er3+/Ho3+, and GdVO4:Er3+ samples show blue, green and red emissions, attributed to the characteristic transitions of Tm3+, Er3+, and Ho3+, respectively. All of these glowing samples have one thing in common: they all contain Er3+. That is to say, the involvement of Er3+ makes it possible to make other doped ions glow, so we suspect that there may be a high energy transfer process involved. Similarly, the color coordinates are located in the yellow and green regions for the samples doped with different Ln3+ ions, as shown in Fig. 3(b).

Fig. 4a shows the UCL spectra of GdVO4:Ln3+ under excitation at 808 nm. As can be seen that GdVO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ shows blue emission, ascribed to the transition 1G4 → 3H6 of Tm3+, and similar to the above discussion, the green and red emissions of other glowing phosphors are attributed to the characteristic transitions of Er3+ or Ho3+. Fig. 4b shows the UCL details of all samples at three excitation wavelengths (980 nm, 1550 nm, and 808 nm), respectively, and this table can provide a good guide for the following studies on dual-wavelength UCL. It could be concluded that GdVO4 is a promising host lattice for doping different rare earth ions. As shown in the table, the following several samples may have dual wavelength effects: GdVO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ (GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Nd3+) under excitation at 808 nm and 980 nm, GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ (GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+) under excitation at 1550 nm and 980 nm, GdVO4:Er3+/Ho3+ (GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+/Tm3+) under excitation at 1550 nm, 808 nm and 980 nm, and GdVO4:Er3+ under excitation at 1550 nm and 808 nm. However, it turned out that only GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ has a strong double-wavelength synergetic UC effect.

To determine the optimal doping concentrations of Yb3+/Er3+ in GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ which has a synergetic UC effect, a series of GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ with different Yb3+ and Er3+ ions were synthesized, and the crystal phase of these samples was investigated by XRD, as shown in Fig. 5. The diffraction peaks of GdVO4:x%Yb3+/y%Er3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 25, 0 ≤ y ≤ 12) can be well indexed, following a pure tetragonal-type structure. Besides, it was noticed that the samples were still highly crystalline and no other impurity phase was generated upon increasing the Yb3+ or Er3+ concentration (seen from Fig. 5a and c). Moreover, to further investigate the effect of Yb3+/Er3+ ions on the structure of GdVO4:x%Yb3+/y%Er3+, the angles of the main diffraction peak are labeled in Fig. 5b and d. Generally speaking, Yb3+ and Er3+ can enter the GdVO4 crystal site through substituting the Gd3+ ions or interstitial sites or can coexist in these two ways. According to Bragg's law 2dsinθ = nλ, where d is the interplanar distance, θ is the diffraction angle, and λ is the diffraction wavelength. Regardless of the ionic radii of Yb3+ (0.087 nm), Er3+ (0.089 nm) is smaller than that of Gd3+ (0.093 nm), and the diffraction peak (200) shifts gradually towards higher angles with increasing Yb3+ concentration corresponding to the standard pattern of GdVO4 (JCPDS No. 17-0260) referenced below, indicating that the Yb3+ ions replace the Gd3+ in the lattice. By comparison, the diffraction peak (200) shifts gradually towards higher angles and then smaller angles with increasing Er3+ concentrations, indicating that Er3+ replaces the Gd3+ in the lattice and then occupies the interstitial sites.

The UC emission spectra of GdVO4:Er3+/Yb3+ with a fixed Er3+ concentration of 1% but different Yb3+ concentrations under excitation at 980 nm (Fig. 6a) and 1550 nm (Fig. 6b) were recorded, from which one can observe that the integrated luminescence intensity of the samples increased first and then decreased, reaching the highest value for the sample with 15% Yb3+ whether excited at 980 nm or 1550 nm. Similarly, the UC emission spectra of GdVO4:Er3+/Yb3+ with a fixed Yb3+ concentration of 15% but different Er3+ concentrations under excitation at 980 nm or 1550 nm were also studied, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. GdVO4:2Er3+/15Yb3+ shows the total highest UC emission intensity under excitation at 980 nm, while GdVO4:5Er3+/15Yb3+ shows the total highest UC emission intensity under excitation at 1550 nm. These different results may be related to the different luminescence mechanisms of UCL under different excitation sources.

In order to further enhance the luminescence intensity, it was meaningful to exchange the rare earth ions in the matrix lattice. Doping with Y3+ or Lu3+ was a good choice due to the similar ionic radii and the identical valence to Gd3+. Based on this idea, Gd(1−x)LuxVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ and Gd(1−y)YyVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ samples were designed. The XRD patterns of these prepared samples all showed pure tetragonal phase GdVO4, as shown in Fig. S1.†
As shown in Fig. 7, whether under 980 nm or 1550 nm excitation, the UC emission intensity of the sample increased first and then decreased with increasing Lu3+ or Y3+ doping. GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ with a Lu3+ concentration of 12 mol% exhibited the strongest UC emission intensity, which was about 2.12 times (under 980 nm excitation) and 3.25 times (under 1550 nm excitation) more than that of GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ (Fig. 7a and b). In the case of Y3+ doping, concerning the concentration dependence, 5% Y3+ doping reached the luminescence maximum; the enhanced luminescence factors for excitation at 980 nm and 1550 nm are 2.0 and 2.9 compared with the Y3+ free sample, respectively. In one word, doping optimal Y3+ or Lu3+ showed fascinating luminescence properties. In addition to this, the quantitative comparison of the intensities of green and red emissions relative to the Lu3+ or Y3+ concentration is shown in the inset of Fig. 7.

Cation substitution has a good luminescence enhancement effect, so what will be the effect of anion substitution on luminescence? Unfortunately, it can be easily seen from Fig. 8a that VO43− was replaced by PO43−, instead of increasing the UCL intensity, but reducing the luminous intensity under excitation at 980 nm. By comparison, upon doping 5% PO43−, the luminescence intensity increased as high as 2 times compared with that obtained under excitation at 1550 nm, and then decreased with increasing PO43− concentration.

It could be seen that under excitation at a single wavelength (980 nm or 1550 nm), appropriate amounts of PO43−, Lu3+ and Y3+ were considerable for the fluorescence enhancement. To know the reasons for the luminescence enhancement, we have carried out the following analysis simply: Firstly, doping Y3+/Lu3+/PO43− has little effect on the morphology and size, as shown in Fig. 9, indicating that this is not the reason for the enhancement of UCL; Secondly, from the XRD patterns described above, it could be concluded that the doping broke the symmetry of the crystal field and improved the efficiency of UCL.

980 nm, 808 nm and 1550 nm are the popular working wavelengths in the near-infrared region. If any two excitation sources act on the sample simultaneously, what will happen? According to Fig. 10a, whether under single excitation at 980 and 1550 nm or dual-excitation at 980 and 1550 nm, the spectral shape is similar, showing characteristic peaks of Er3+ ions, while it is notable that the emission intensity under two-wavelength excitation is higher than the sum intensity excited with two single-wavelength lasers (increased by a factor of 1.87), which indicated that the enhancement effect of two-wavelength excitation is not a simple additive enhancement, but the synergistic effect. It can be explained as follows: better yet, with a couple of resonance absorptions involved at the same time upon using a two-wavelength simultaneous pump, it is rational to believe that the intensity of UC processes can be improved since each energy transition of photons is available. Therefore, because of the synergistic effect under simultaneous 980 nm and 1550 nm excitation, the energy losses caused by multi-phonon relaxation and the energy mismatch between the 4f levels of Er3+ and excitation photons decrease remarkably, resulting in a great enhancement of the UC emission intensity in our case. The detailed relationship between the UCL and excitation power is shown in Fig. 10b, no matter which kind of excitation light source or what power of light source is used, the UCL enhanced upon increasing the pumping power, and the synergistic effect always existed. Therefore, we supposed that there was a relationship between the enhanced factor and the corresponding excitation power, as shown in Fig. 10c. The enhanced factor does not increase monotonously, but shows a maximum at a pumping power of 400 mW and then decreases, due to the intensity saturation caused by the competition between the linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states.
 Fig. 10  (a) UC emission spectra of GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ under 980 nm, 1550 nm or simultaneous dual-wavelength (980 and 1550 nm) excitation. (b) The pump power dependence of green emission integrated intensities of the GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ samples under 980 nm, 1550 nm, and 980 nm while keeping 1550 nm at 400 mW, 1550 nm while keeping 980 nm at 400 mW and dual-wavelength (P980 = P1550) excitation, respectively. (c) The emission integrated intensity of green emission was increased by a factor upon simultaneous dual-wavelength excitation, compared to the total UC emission integrated intensities excited with two monochromatic lasers. 
To understand the microscopic mechanism of the enhanced UCL upon two-wavelength simultaneous excitation, the dependence of the UC emission intensity on the pump power was measured. As shown in Fig. 11a, the slopes corresponding to the 522 nm bands of the GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ phosphor under 980 nm excitation are calculated to be 1.83, which shows that the emissions are two-photon absorption processes. Under excitation at 1550 nm, the slopes of 527 nm obtained were 2.37, which indicates that the emission is a three-photon process. Under simultaneous dual-wavelength excitation, when fixing the power of the 980 nm laser, the slope of green emission (527 nm) is 0.82; when fixing the power of the 1550 nm laser, the slope of green emission (527 nm) is 1.22. It can be clearly seen that the slopes of the power dependence of the UC intensity at a two-wavelength pump are much smaller than those at a single-wavelength pump. The reduction in the photon number n involved in UC employing the dual-wavelength lasers as the excitation source, in comparison with the conventional monochromatic excitation situation, is attributed to the more efficient utilization of excited photons due to the synergistic effect of dual-wavelength excitation, i.e., the UC emission levels are populated by simultaneously absorbing the photons arising from the two pumping lasers.24,25 Therefore, this feature inspires us to further discuss the microscopic mechanisms of UCL processes upon dual-wavelength excitation. To gain a closer insight into the UCL microscopic mechanisms, the plausible energy level transitions are illustrated in Fig. 11b. Owing to the nature of the simultaneous dual-wavelength excitation, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of UC processes could be enhanced as photons with resonant energy for each transition are available, and the excited state absorption (ESA) has a higher contribution owing to the presence of a wider range of resonant photons. Therefore, under dual-wavelength simultaneous excitation, in addition to the single-wavelength excitation path, there are additional novel photon-assisted UC paths. Meanwhile, owing to the short lifetime of the 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 levels of Er3+, the two energy levels easily shift to a lower energy level by non-radiative transition. It is confirmed that the    processes are possible. This explains why the green emission is much more intensified than that in the simple sum of the two UC emission spectra excited with two monochromatic lasers (980 nm + 1550 nm).

Depending on the excellent UCL properties of the synthesized GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ UCNPs under 980 and 1550 nm excitation, the temperature sensing performance has been investigated. Fig. 12a mainly shows the green UC emission spectra of the GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ UCNPs at temperatures ranging from 273 to 453 K under 980 nm excitation. With an increase of temperature, the peak positions of the green UC emissions at 527 nm and 554 nm show no change, while the UCL intensity at 554 nm changes obviously. Moreover, it is obvious that the FIR of the two emissions decreased dramatically with an increase of the sample temperature. This is because the electronic states of Er3+ are thermally coupled, and their populations are in accordance with the Boltzmann distribution. In addition, no overlap of these two UC emission bands occurred, which favors the measurement accuracy of the emission intensities. The above two characteristics make the GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ microcrystals potential probes for temperature sensing. An energy gap of about 858 cm−1 between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels could be obtained from the green UC emission spectra, which agrees well with the previous reports.26,27 This energy separation allows the 2H11/2 level populated from the 4S3/2 level by thermal excitation and a quasi-thermal equilibrium occurs between the two levels, leading to a variation in the transitions of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+ at an elevated temperature. With the thermalization of population at the two levels and ignoring the effects of self-absorption of the fluorescence, the FIR of green UC emissions at 527 and 554 nm can be written as eqn (1).28 (1)where FIR stands for the fluorescence intensity ratio technology, I527 nm and I554 nm are the integrated intensities from the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, ΔE is the energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, and C is the pre-exponential proportionality constant. Furthermore, to better understand the temperature sensing performance, it is important for us to investigate the sensor absolute sensitivity (Sa) and relative sensitivity (Sr) of an optical thermometer. The rate at which the FIR varies with temperature is determined, and Sa and Sr can be defined as eqn (2) and (3), respectively.29,30 (2) (3)

As shown in Fig. 12c, based on FIRTCL, the Sa curve is observed to reach the maximum upon increasing the temperature, but the Sr values keep on decreasing gradually (Fig. 12(d)). Sa gradually increases with an increase in the temperature, reaching a maximum value of 0.69% K−1 at 393 K, which is much higher than the values of most phosphors, including LuVO4:Er/Yb (0.67% K−1), CaWO4:Er/Yb (0.25% K−1), Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ (0.39% K−1) YPO4:Er/Yb (0.27% K−1) and NaScF4:Er/Yb (0. 256% K−1), and in particular higher than that of the excellent UC phosphor NaYF4:Er/Yb (0.39% K−1).31–37 According to eqn (3), the relative sensitivity Sr is an inverse proportional function of T2. Here, the Sr value obtained is 858/T2, and the maximum Sr is 0.012 K−1 at 273 K. Comparisons between different phosphors with regard to the absolute sensitivity and relative sensitivity and to the temperature range are discussed, as listed in Table 1. These results indicate that the GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ phosphor is much better than most of the reported materials for optical thermometry, especially in the high temperature region (>300 K).

By comparison, there were few studies on temperature sensing properties under excitation at 1550 nm. Interestingly, it could be observed from Fig. 13b that a good linear relationship is achieved between the temperature and FIR value, which further proves that the GdVO4:2%Er3+/15%Yb3+ phosphor is not only an excellent UC but also a potential temperature sensor material under excitation with two lasers.

5 Conclusion
In summary, a series of GdVO4:Ln3+ with a prism shape were synthesized, and they showed a single tetragonal phase. Green, red and blue visible emissions were observed under 980 nm, 1550 nm, 808 nm, and 980 nm + 1550 nm simultaneous excitation, assigned to the characteristic emissions of the intra-4f transitions of Ln3+ ions, respectively. In comparison with two single-wavelength excitation, the UC emission intensity can be enhanced as high as 1.87 times under two-wavelength excitation, due to the synergistic effect of 980 nm and 1550 nm photons. A possible dual-wavelength UC emission mechanism was proposed, taking into consideration the dependence of the emission intensities on the pumping power. Moreover, a luminescence enhancement as high as 2.12/3.25 and 2.0/2.9 times was observed after cation ion (Lu3+ and Y3+) doping through the modification of the local crystal field symmetry under 980/1550 nm excitation, and it increased 2 times by doping an anion (PO43−) under 1550 nm excitation. The temperature-dependent behaviors of the as-synthesized sample demonstrated its potential for application in optical thermometry, and were investigated based on the thermal coupled levels of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 not only under 980 nm but also under 1550 nm excitation. Among the samples, the maximum sensitivity reached as high as 69 × 10−4 K−1 at 393 K. These results indicate the potential of the phosphors for use in temperature sensors.
