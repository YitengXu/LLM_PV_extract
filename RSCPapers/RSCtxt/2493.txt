    , Accepted 10th May 2018First published on 12th May 2018AbstractAn organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP), namely CzEAP, containing a large organic ammonium, 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethanaminium bromide, was synthesized and exhibited a large band gap of 3.5 eV, a maximum valence band energy level of −6.6 eV, and moderate hole mobility comparable to organic hole-transporting materials. Employing CzEAP as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) in solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on a typical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter, 2,4,5,6-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-1,3-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN), resulted in a peak external quantum efficiency of 15.3%, which is nearly two times higher than that of a reference device with a PEDOT:PSS hole injection layer alone. The origin of this significant improvement was found to be the versatile functionality of the CzEAP as the HTL, which is for suppressing exciton quenching, improving the emission efficiency and promoting the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate of TADF emitters via the external heavy-atom effect. This finding unlocks the great potential of OIHPs as excellent HTL materials for high-efficiency solution-processed TADF OLEDs.
Introduction
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been regarded as next generation luminescent materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their fantastic ability to fully utilize triplet excitons.1,2 Compared with similar efficient phosphorescence emitters, TADF emitters do not need the help of heavy metals such as Ir or Pt that are scarce and expensive. So far, TADF emitters have covered a full color gamut and achieved high efficiencies comparable to phosphorescent emitters3,4 with various design principles.5–8 However, the state-of-the-art TADF OLEDs have been mostly fabricated through thermal evaporation,9–15 which is inefficient due to its energy consumption and low material utilization. Although the solution process affords a simple and cost-effective alternative,16–19 the solution-processed TADF OLEDs have lagged behind the vacuum-deposited ones in terms of efficiencies. One of the main restrictions is the lack of appropriate hole-transporting materials. The commonly used hole-transporting materials for solution-processed OLEDs are mainly polymers, such as poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine] (poly-TPD),20 poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine))] (TFB)21 and so on, which would be partially corroded during the spin-coating of the emitting layer (EML) in common organic solvents. Ideal hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for solution-processed OLEDs still require more exploration.
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) has attracted considerable attention in the academic and industrial community.22 Its wide absorption and efficient exciton dissociation make it suitable for solar cell applications.23,24 So far, the most efficient perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) had realized power conversion efficiencies of over 22%.25 Due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, OIHPs have also been introduced into light-emitting diodes (LEDs),26–28 quantum dots (QDs),29–32 photodetectors33–35 and lasers.36–38 One of the key origins of the high efficiencies of PeSCs is the superior charge conductivities of OIHPs, which enable efficient charge transport and collection from the active layer to electrodes.39,40 Due to the highly regulated structure of OIHPs, their charge conductivity is much higher than that of commonly used organic charge-transporting materials, which makes OIHPs potential charge-transporting material candidates in optoelectronics devices such as OLEDs. Furthermore, the structures and optoelectronic properties of OIHPs can be easily tuned by changing the halogen anions between chloride, bromide, and iodide,41 and the organic ammonium from various sources, such as methylammonium, formamidinium, phenylethylammonium and so on. The low-temperature fabrication of OIHPs was also a key advantage for OLED applications because the state-of-the-art OLEDs are usually vacuum-deposited ones. So far, several studies on perovskite HTLs for OLEDs have been reported.42–44 However, the introduction of perovskite HTLs into TADF OLEDs has not been explored, and the understanding of the interactions between OIHPs and emitting materials still needs to be deepened.
Herein, we developed an OIHP with carbazole-modified organic ammonium bromide to modify its hole-transporting ability. Solution-processed OLEDs based on the CzEAP HTL and a classic green TADF emitter, 2,4,5,6-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-1,3-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN), achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.3%, nearly double that of OLEDs without CzEAP. The interaction between the CzEAP and TADF emitters was studied through photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield measurement and transient PL spectra. The results revealed that CzEAP could significantly reduce exciton dissociation, improve emission efficiency and promote the delayed fluorescence proportion of the TADF emitters, corresponding to more efficient inter-system crossing (ISC) and reverse inter-system crossing (RISC).
Results and discussion

CzEAP films were facilely prepared via a low-temperature reaction of PbBr2 and 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethanaminium bromide (CzEABr) (molar ratio = 1:2) by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution and chloroform as an anti-solvent. The formation of CzEAP was confirmed through XRD and UV-vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 1b, the XRD peaks of the as-prepared CzEAP films exhibited no overlap with that of PbBr2 indicating the formation of a new crystal structure. The peaks at 15.1° and 29.6° can be assigned to the 6.0 Å d-spacing from Bragg's law, and are in good agreement with the 3D structure of MAPbBr3 in the (001) plane (5.9 Å); while the peaks at 8.0°, 18.7° and 25.9° belong to the spacing of the long organic cation, CzEA of about 10 Å. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the CzEAP film in Fig. 1c displayed a sharp absorption edge, similar to that of other widely reported perovskites. The optical band gap of the CzEAP film was estimated to be 3.5 eV from the onset of the absorption edge. Such a large optical band gap endows our perovskite with no absorption of visible light, and makes it practicable for use as a charge-transporting material in OLED applications.

Fig. 1d presents photographs of the bare glass substrate (left) and the substrate with atop poly(styrene sulfonic acid):poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (middle) or CzEAP (right). The results indicate that the CzEAP film possesses good transmittance comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S2, ESI†). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was used to measure the energy levels of CzEAP. According to the second electron cut-off, the work function of CzEAP was determined to be 4.9 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†). The valence band maximum (VBM) was calculated to be −6.6 eV from the valence band edge and work function. Combined with the optical band gap, its conducting band minimum (CBM) was calculated to be −3.1 eV.
The widely used MAPbI3 has a high hole mobility of 12.5–66 cm2 V−1 s−1 which makes it hard to achieve charge balance in traditional OLEDs.39 2D perovskites with larger organic cations are less conductive, which may be more favorable for OLEDs. The carbazole moiety introduced here was used to modify the hole-transporting ability, and the overall charge-transporting ability of OIHP was measured with a hole-only device with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CzEAP/MoO3/Al. According to the measured J–V (current density versus voltage) curve (Fig. S4, ESI†) and the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, the hole mobility of CzEAP was estimated to be 0.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ESI,† 2.2), which is viable in OLED applications.
Low-temperature solution casting is one great advantage of OIHPs. The commonly used solvents for OIHPs, such as DMF and DMSO, are also practical in solution-processed OLEDs.45 We inserted CzEAP between the hole injection layer (HIL), PEDOT:PSS, and the emitting layer as a HTL. In this case, the mostly used solvents of the emitting layer such as chlorobenzene or toluene wouldn’t corrode the OIHP. The overall OLED structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/CzEAP (40 nm)/1,3-bis(carbazol-9-yl)benzene (mCP):4CzIPN (10 wt%) (40 nm)/1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB) (50 nm)/lithium 8-hydroxyquinolinolate (Liq) (1 nm)/Al (device B) and without CzEAP (device A) or without PEDOT:PSS (device C). The device structure and energy diagram are illustrated in Fig. 2a.

Current density–voltage–luminance curves and external quantum efficiencies versus current density curves are illustrated in Fig. 2c and d, and the key EL data are summarized in Table 1. The luminance of device B was much higher than that of device A under the same voltages, which indicates that CzEAP may be helpful to reduce the exciton dissociation. However, device C exhibited lower luminance than device A under high current density, which could be attributed to the lower hole mobility compared with PEDOT:PSS. The turn-on voltages of devices B and C are slightly lower than that of the reference device A, which might be associated with the Auger-assisted charge injection process of perovskite.46 In comparison with the reference device A based on PEDOT:PSS (the maximum EQE of 8.7%), device B with additional CzEAP HTL exhibited a tremendously improved device performance in that the maximum EQE was promoted from 8.7% to 15.3% by a significant elevation of 76%. Even when using CzEAP as the only HIL/HTL, device C still achieved a peak EQE of 11.0%, significantly higher than that of the reference device A based on PEDOT:PSS. It is worth noting that device B exhibited better performance under high current density and luminance (its maximum EQE of 15.3% was achieved at a high luminance of 1000 cd m−2), which was very meaningful in practical OLED applications. These results indicate that perovskite charge-transporting materials hold great promise in realizing high-efficiency OLEDs under high current density.47 With further elaborate molecular design, the performance of OLEDs with perovskite charge-transporting materials might be remarkably promoted under both low and high current densities.

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is a vital parameter for TADF emitters and may be the origin for the promotion of the efficiency of device B. The absolute PLQYs of several samples were measured (Table S1, ESI†). The mCP:4CzIPN (10 wt%) film on a quartz substrate has a very high PLQY of 85%, which is in good accordance with Adachi's report.2 When a PEDOT:PSS film was inserted beneath the TADF emitting layer, its PLQY remarkably dropped to only 40%. Although PEDOT:PSS has a strong absorbance of 300 nm UV light as shown in its transmittance spectrum, mCP:4CzIPN EML atop PEDOT:PSS or quartz exhibited almost the same absolute absorbance of 69% and 68%, respectively. This result indicated that the absolute absorbance of EML atop PEDOT:PSS or quartz may not be simply proportional to that of PEDOT:PSS or quartz. Therefore, the significant differences in their PLQYs could not arise from the different absorbance of PEDOT:PSS or quartz for 300 nm excitation light. This reduction had been previously reported48 and might be mainly caused by the exciton dissociation and charge separation49,50 at the interface of the PEDOT:PSS and emitting layer. After inserting an insulting polymer, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), beneath the emitting layer, the PLQY of the mCP:4CzIPN layer was slightly elevated to 50% because of the reduced exciton dissociation, but it was still much lower than the pristine emitting layer. In contrast, the PLQY remained as high as 73% after adding a layer of CzEAP beneath the emitting layer, suggesting that the exciton dissociation was much suppressed on the interface of CzEAP and the mCP:4CzIPN layer. Therefore, the introduction of CzEAP into OLEDs as the hole-transporting material could significantly suppress the exciton quenching by PEDOT:PSS and thus promote the device performance.
Heavy atoms, such as bromide, Ir and Pt, can accelerate inter-system crossing and reverse inter-system crossing through spin–orbit coupling and this influence is called the heavy-atom effect.51–54 Several studies have reported the enhancement from the heavy-atom effect on TADF emitters.55,56CzEAP contains heavy atoms of bromide and lead, which may affect the adjacent TADF emitting layer. To figure out this point, we conducted transient PL characterization of mCP:4CzIPN (10 wt%) atop glass, PEDOT:PSS or CzEAP (Fig. 3a). The prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetimes and ratios of these samples were fitted using the double exponential decay model (Table 2). Obviously, TADF emitters atop CzEAP showed a higher delayed fluorescence (DF) ratio (81%) compared to that of the EML atop glass (73%), while the PEDOT:PSS barely affected the DF proportion of the EML.

To get a deep insight into this effect, we estimated the ISC and RISC rates (kISC and kRISC) of mCP:4CzIPN (10 wt%) atop glass, PEDOT:PSS or CzEAP through the combination of their PLQYs and the following equations: kISC = (1 − Φp) × kp(1) (2)
in which Φp refers to the prompt component of PLQY, and Φd stands for the delayed component of PLQY. The prompt and delayed fluorescence rates are kp = 1/τp, and kd = 1/τd, respectively.57 As shown in Table 2, mCP:4CzIPN (10 wt%) atop CzEAP afforded significantly enhanced kISC and kRISC by 28% and 42%, respectively, compared with the EML atop bare glass; whereas PEDOT:PSS had a negligible effect on the kISC of the EML, but slightly reduced its kRISC. This acceleration in both the ISC and RISC process by the introduction of CzEAP is consistent with the previous report of the heavy-atom effect.53 This enhancement may also be an origin of the boosted OLED performance.
To verify the universality of CzEAP's effect on TADF emitters, a typical blue TADF emitter, DMAc-DPS-Cz,58 and our previously reported orange TADF emitter, ClPPM55 atop CzEAP were tested through transient PL spectra. As shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S5 (ESI†), the DF proportions were elevated by 31% for DMAc-DPS-Cz and 25% for 4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP):ClPPM, respectively. These results clearly establish that CzEAP adjacent the TADF emitting layer did participate in the TADF process and eventually enhanced the DF ratios of the TADF emitters. As for the same EML atop PEDOT:PSS, the DF ratios of DMAc-DPS-Cz and CBP:ClPPM were obviously reduced, indicating that PEDOT:PSS might promote the triplet dissociation or other decay routes and was not good for OLEDs based on DMAc-DPS-Cz or ClPPM.

CzEAP consists of a carbazole moiety, ethyl ammonium, a lead ion and a bromide ion. The actual influence of each component of CzEAP on TADF emitters might be very different or even the opposite. To get a deep understanding of this point, we mixed each component of CzEAP or other analogues with mCP:4CzIPN (10 wt%), and collected the corresponding transient PL spectra (Fig. 3c). After doping with PbBr2, the DF ratio of mCP:4CzIPN was slightly weakened, implying that Pb2+ or Br− hindered the energy transfer or TADF process of the EML and reduced its DF proportion. To further confirm the actual working component, we used another ionic compound, methylammonium bromide (MABr) to mix with the EML and investigated the transient PL spectra because MA+ could hardly interfere with the RISC process through spin–orbit coupling. When doping with MABr, the DF ratio of mCP:4CzIPN was obviously increased. These results indicated that Br− was helpful to the RISC process and increased the DF proportion of the TADF emitters, while Pb2+ might be an obstacle in this process.
The host material, mCP, was then removed to further investigate the direct interaction between these ions and 4CzIPN. Several ionic compounds with Br−, such as CzEABr, MABr, KBr, and PbBr2, and an organic compound, DBB (1,4-dibromide benzene), with bromine linked to benzene through a covalent bond, were directly mixed into 4CzIPN neat films, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, the DF proportions were all raised after doping with CzEABr, MABr, KBr, and PbBr2 (all containing Br−) at different levels. Interestingly, Pb2+ didn’t show an obvious reduction of DF ratio, implying that its influence was mainly on the host–guest interaction and not on 4CzIPN. However, the case with DBB doping was quite the opposite. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the DF components of DBB doped 4CzIPN and DBB doped mCP:4CzIPN were much weakened compared to the corresponding systems without DBB doping, indicating that this enhancement of the DF ratio of TADF emitters could only be triggered by the bromide ion and not by covalently linked bromine.
Introducing ionic species into the EML generally affects the operational stability of OLEDs at high current densities. To figure out this point, the influence of different doping species on the device operational stability was examined by using a pristine EML of mCP:4CzIPN (10 wt%) or CzEABr doped EML (1 wt%) under a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. S6, ESI†). Interestingly, the introduction of CzEABr into the EML slightly improved the device half-lifetime LT50 (the time that the device luminance drops to 50% of its initial luminance) from 0.7 h (pristine EML) to 2.1 h (doped with 1 wt% of CzEABr). This could be related to the boosted RISC rate of the EML and the reduction of the triplet exciton density in the EL process. The origins of this enhancement of the device stability will be studied in further research.
Conclusion
In summary, an OIHP, CzEAP, as an HTL for TADF OLEDs was synthesized to exhibit a large band gap, a deep valence band maximum energy level, good transmittance and moderate hole mobility. Solution-processed OLEDs using 4CzIPN as an emitter and CzEAP as a HTL achieved outstanding device performance with a maximum EQE of 15.3% at a high luminance of 1000 cd m−2, which was nearly doubled compared to that of OLEDs without CzEAP. The origins of the promotion were attributed to the reduced exciton quenching and enhanced TADF process induced by the external heavy-atom effect. The ISC, and RISC processes were accelerated after CzEAP was inserted beneath the TADF emitters, which is ascribed to the bromide anions in CzEAP. The influence of OIHP on TADF emitters revealed here is inspiring to develop high-efficiency OLEDs with perovskite charge-transporting materials. The combination of elaborate molecular design and the superior intrinsic optoelectronic characters of OIHP would result in materials more suitable for OLEDs and could be a solution for solution-processed OLEDs.
