    , Accepted 23rd September 2016First published on 23rd September 2016AbstractCdTe quantum dots (QDs) with a narrow band gap and high conduction band (CB) edge provide great potential for the fabrication of QD sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Herein, a convenient aqueous route was adopted to synthesize CdTe core QDs for the construction of type-II core/shell QD sensitizers. First, mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped water-soluble CdTe QDs were synthesized in aqueous media. After tethering the CdTe QDs onto a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSexS1−x type-II core/shell QD sensitizers were formed by post-depositing CdS and CdSexS1−x shell materials over the photoanodes via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction processes (SILAR), respectively. A wider light harvesting range together with a wider photoelectronic response range was observed in the resultant CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSexS1−x core/shell QD based solar cells relative to plain CdTe cells. Simultaneously, suppressed charge recombination processes has also been confirmed by impedance spectroscopy (IS), and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) characterizations. Consequently, compared to the plain CdTe QDSCs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS were enhanced by 22 and 35%, respectively. With the optimization of CdSexS1−x shell thickness, a PCE of 7.24% under the illumination of one full sun was obtained.
Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with unique photoelectronic properties (such as tunable band gaps, high extinction coefficients, slow hot electron cooling, and a multiple exciton generation possibility) are promising potential light absorber candidates for the construction of third-generation photovoltaic cells.1–6 Furthermore, the facile solution processability of colloidal QDs makes low-cost device fabrication possible.7,8 In recent years, QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have made significant progress,9–21 and a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.61% based on Zn–Cu–ln–Se alloyed QDs has been achieved.22
Abundant pioneering works have been accomplished to explore various colloidal QDs for application in photovoltaic (PV) devices, such as II–VI (CdS, CdSe, CdTe),23–25 IV–VI (PbS, PbSe),26–29 and I–III–VI (CulnS2, CulnSe2) QDs.22,30,31 In order to obtain high and uniform surface coverage of QDs on a metal oxide (mainly TiO2) matrix/conductor, two general loading methods have been developed: (1) direct growth approach by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), or a chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique;32 and (2) linker assisted assembly using presynthesized colloidal QDs.33 Among all the colloidal QDs, CdSe is the most used material to fabricate QDSC devices. To obtain a high efficiency in QDSCs, ideal QD sensitizers should possess a narrow band gap and a higher conduction band edge relative to that of the TiO2 matrix.34 Compared to CdSe QDs of the same size, those of CdTe possess a narrower band gap and a higher conductive band edge, which make the light-absorption range of CdTe extend to longer wavelengths and give a faster electron injection rate from CdTe QDs to TiO2. However, the development of QDSCs based on CdTe QDs has only slightly been touched on in the literature.25,35,36 On one hand, it is not easy to find a stable Te precursor to directly grow CdTe QD sensitizers onto TiO2 film electrodes to assemble cell devices via the CBD or SILAR route. On the other hand, CdTe QDs are susceptible to oxidization, thereby reducing the performance of the resultant cells.25 Still, the Chang group, and Kuang group have made contributions to utilizing CdTe QDs in QDSCs, and obtained a power conversion efficiency of 2.02 and 3.8%, respectively.35,36 Therefore, the potential of CdTe based QDSCs has not been fully realized.
Larger sized QDs with narrower band gaps can widen the light absorption range. However, this additionally lowers the surface coverage of QDs due to the difficulty in filtrating into a mesoporous oxide matrix, and reduces the electron injection efficiency from the photoexcited QD sensitizer to TiO2 due to the lower conduction band edge. To address this issue, utilization of type-II core/shell structured QD sensitizers with the characteristics of a wide light harvesting range, high conduction band (CB) edge and low charge recombination rate, is an effective method.40 The spatially indirect energy gap, or exciplex state of type-II QDs can expand light harvesting range to enhance the photocurrent density. Furthermore, because of the spatial separation of electron and hole in type-II core/shell QDs, the shell acts as an electron tunneling barrier to hinder the charge recombination process, and the enhanced electron density around the surface of QD can improve the electron injection rate.37–39 Zhong’s group synthesized CdTe/CdSe and ZnTe/CdSe type-II core/shell QD sensitizers via a post-synthesis assembly approach, and the resulting QDSCs exhibit PCEs of 6.76 and 7.17%, respectively.40,41 But the traditional organometallic synthesis of type-II core/shell QDs needs high temperatures and expensive organic solvents such as trioctylphosphine (TOP). To further reduce costs, both Meng and Bhattacharyya groups prepared CdSexTe1−x/CdS and CdTe/CdS QD sensitizers in aqueous media, and enabled an impressive PCE of 5.04 and 6.41%, respectively.42,43
In this work, a one-step, low-temperature aqueous route was adopted to prepare MPA-capped CdTe QDs. To form the type-II CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSexS1−x core/shell QDs, CdS and CdSexS1−x shells were post-deposited over a photoanode by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process (SILAR). After MPA-capped CdTe QDs were tethered onto TiO2 mesoporous film electrode, CdS and CdSexS1−x shells were post-deposited over the photoanode by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process (SILAR) to form the type-II CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSexS1−x core/shell QDs. Compared to plain CdTe QDs, type-II CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSexS1−x core/shell QDs possess the advantages of a broader light harvesting range and a suppressed charge recombination process due to the spatial separation of the electron–hole pair in the characteristic type-II structure. The PCE of the CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS QDSCs was enhanced by 22 and 35% compared to that of plain CdSeTe QDSCs, respectively. With the optimization of CdSexS1−x shell thickness, a PCE of 7.24% (Jsc = 16.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.629 V, FF = 0.694) under the illumination of one full sun was obtained.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99%), tellurium powder (200 mesh, 99.8%), selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), cadmium chloride pentahydrate (CdCl2·5H2O, 99%), cadmium acetate dehydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 98%), and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99%) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 98%) was purchased from Shanghai chemical reagents company, China. Distilled water was used throughout.
Synthesis of CdTe QDs
The CdTe QDs were synthesized following the literature method with slight modifications.44 Typically, the Cd precursor solution was prepared by adding 0.1 mmol of CdCl2 and 0.17 mmol of MPA in 20 mL of deionized water, and adjusting the pH of the solution to 12 by the dropwise addition of 1.0 M NaOH solution. The solution was placed in a three-necked flask and the air in the system was pumped off and replaced with N2. Under stirring, freshly prepared 0.01 mmol NaHTe solution (obtained by mixing 0.4 mmol of tellurium powder and 1 mmol of NaBH4 in 10 mL of water at 80 °C for 30 min under N2) was added through a syringe into the Cd precursor solution at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux at 100 °C. Aliquots of the sample were taken at different time intervals and used to record their UV-vis and PL spectra. The obtained CdTe QDs were purified by centrifugation and decantation with the addition of ethanol. The purified CdTe QDs were re-dispersed in deionized water, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 12 through the use of 10% NaOH solution.
Fabrication of QDSCs
TiO2 mesoporous film electrodes with thickness of 25.0 ± 1.5 μm (20.0 μm transparent layer combined with 5.0 μm light scattering layer) were prepared according to a literature method.54 For the deposition of CdTe QDs onto the TiO2 electrode, TiO2 film was placed into QD aqueous dispersions and left for 12 h. After tethering the presynthesized CdTe QDs, a CdS or CdSexS1−x shell was deposited through the SILAR process. To be specific, the CdS shells were coated by dipping the QD-sensitized photoanode into 0.1 M methanol solution of Cd(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min per dip alternately. For the deposition of a CdSexS1−x shell, selenium powder was added into Na2S aqueous solution with a Se:S molar ratio of 1:4, and then the selenium powder completely dissolved by ultrasonication. The two-step dipping procedure is termed as one SILAR cycle. A certain number of SILAR cycles (2–8) were employed to obtain a desired thickness of the CdS or CdSeS shell. Finally, a ZnS barrier layer was coated on the QD sensitized TiO2 films to further inhibit the interfacial charge recombination according to a literature method.12 The cell devices were fabricated by assembling a brass-based counter electrode and the QD-sensitized photoanode separated by a 60 μm Scotch spacer, and polysulfide electrolyte (containing 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl) was filled in to construct the sandwich-type solar cells. Under each condition, five cells were prepared and measured in parallel to ensure the reliability of the evaluation data.
Characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra and the PL emission spectra were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101 PC) and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse Varian), respectively. The cell performances of the J–V curves were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel, 94022A, 150 W xenon lamp) with light power calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by an NREL standard Si solar cell. The photoactive area was localized at 0.238 cm2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp. IS measurements were carried out on an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Germany) at the forward bias ranging from −0.3 to −0.60 V with 20 mV of amplitude over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under dark conditions. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) on a JEOL-2010 high-resolution electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with focused monochromatized Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.7 eV).
Results and discussion
Cell performance based on differently sized CdTe QD sensitizers
Differently sized CdTe QDs ranging from 3.5–4.8 nm with corresponding first excitonic absorption onsets at 554–640 nm were synthesized according to a literature method via a one-step, low temperature route by injecting freshly prepared NaHTe solution into CdCl2 aqueous media at 100 °C under atmosphere.44Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra and emission spectra of three CdTe QD samples identified by their absorbance (emission) peaks at 554 nm (616 nm), 608 nm (665 nm), and 640 nm (707 nm), and their absorption onset locating at 649, 710 and 751 nm, respectively. Fig. 1b is a TEM image of CdTe QDs having an absorbance peak at 608 nm. The bright field TEM image of this specimen which clearly indicates a spherical morphology with diameter 4.3 ± 0.5 nm. The adopted one-step, low temperature route under atmosphere is very convenient for the low-cost fabrication of cell devices.

For the deposition of the MPA-capped CdTe QDs onto a TiO2 film electrode, the TiO2 film electrode was placed into QD aqueous dispersions and left for 12 h. Then a thin passivation layer of ZnS was coated over the sensitized electrode in four cycles via the successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) route following the standard literature method.12 Sandwich-type cells were assembled of the QD-sensitized TiO2 film electrode, a Cu2S/brass foil counter electrode, and filling with polysulfide electrolyte (2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in aqueous solution). For each type of cell, five parallel cells sensitized with differently sized CdTe QDs with corresponding first excitonic onsets at 554, 608 and 640 nm, respectively, were prepared and measured under the illumination of a solar simulator (AM 1.5G) at 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of different cell devices are shown in Fig. 1c, the extracted average values for the main photovoltaic parameters based on five parallel cell devices are listed in Table 1, and detailed corresponding photovoltaic parameters for each cell are given in Table S1 in the ESI.† As shown in Table 1, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) values increase gradually from 9.57 to 12.15 mA cm−2, meanwhile the corresponding open-circuit voltage (Voc) values decrease from 0.627 to 0.589 V along with the first exciton absorption peak of the CdTe QDs red-shifting from 554 to 640 nm. The systematic increase of the Jsc value is attributed to the extending light absorption range with the increase of particle size and the red-shift of absorption onset of the QDs sensitizers. The dependence of the Voc on the particle size is reasonable since increasing QDs size results in the downward shift of the QD conduction band level due to the weaker quantum confinement effect,45 which reduces the energetic driving force for injecting photo-generated electrons into TiO2 and therefore diminishes the Voc. A similar variation trend of Jsc and Voc values were also observed in CdSe QD sensitized solar cells.33 The best photovoltaic performance with Jsc = 11.83 mA cm2, Voc = 0.609 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.676, and PCE = 4.87% was obtained based on the QD608 sensitizer cell devices. Hereafter, CdTe QD608 was selected to further study the effect of CdS or CdSexS1−x shells around the CdTe core in the photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell devices.

Formation of CdS and CdSexS1−x shells around CdTe cores
To obtain the type-II core/shell configuration, CdS or CdSexS1−x shells were coated onto CdTe QD sensitized photoanodes through the SILAR process to broaden the light harvesting range and suppress the combination process. To be specific, the CdS shells were coated on the QDs via placing these into a 0.1 M methanol solution of Cd2+ and a 0.1 M S2− aqueous solution alternately for four cycles. For the deposition of the CdSe0.2S0.8 (simplified as CdSeS henceforth) shells, an ionic solution was prepared by adding selenium powder into Na2S aqueous solution with a Se:S molar ratio of 1:4, and then completely dissolving the selenium powder by ultrasonication. It was observed that the color changed to deep red from colorless after the selenium powder dissolved in the Na2S solution as shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CdTe, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS QD sensitized TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption onset of CdTe absorption spectra is located at 710 nm. After the CdS or CdSeS shell has been grown on the CdTe sensitized TiO2 film via the SILAR method, the light absorption onset edges obviously shifted from 710 to 730 and 750 nm, respectively, and the absorbance values are significantly improved in the visible wavelengths range. In addition, the light absorption ability at short wavelengths was also improved, which is ascribed to the formed CdS or CdSeS shells around the surface of the photoanode (including both the QD and TiO2 matrix). The enhanced visible light harvesting capacity and red shift of absorption onset edges indicated that type-II CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS core/shell structure QDs had been generated via this SILAR process.

Structural characterization
In order to directly reveal the coverage of CdS and CdSeS shells grown on the CdTe sensitized TiO2 film electrodes, structural analysis using high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) was implemented and the results are displayed in Fig. 3. In this procedure, CdTe QD608 was prepared and subsequently immobilized on TiO2 film electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3a, for the plain CdTe sample, the distinct edges of TiO2 particles and isolated QDs (labeled by the dashed circles) with particle size of ∼4 nm can be clearly observed. After the successful growth of CdS or CdSeS shells, via four cycles of a SILAR method, onto the QD sensitized TiO2 electrode, the deposition of a CdS or CdSeS layer (labeled with arrows) with average thickness of ∼1.0 nm around both CdTe QDs and the exposed surface of TiO2 matrix was clearly observed as is shown in Fig. 3b and c.

For clarity, the QDs are marked by dashed circles, and the CdS and CdSeS shells are indicated by arrows. X-ray photoelectron spectra of CdTe, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS sensitized electrodes: (d) Cd 3d, (e) S 2p, and (f) Se 3d signals. 
In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectral (XPS) characterization was performed to further analyze the CdS and CdSeS shells around the CdTe QD sensitized photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Cd 3d signal appeared in all three samples of the CdTe, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS QDs sensitized TiO2 film electrodes. Meanwhile, a S 2p signal appeared in both the XPS spectrum of the CdTe/CdS and that of the CdTe/CdSeS samples (Fig. 3e), and a Se 3d signal appeared in that of CdTe/CdSeS sample (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, the XPS analysis showed that the Se:S molar ratio of the CdTe/CdSeS sample is close to 1:4 which is consistent with that of the anionic precursor solution used in the SILAR process. These results clearly confirm that a CdS or CdSeS layer was formed in the specified samples via the SILAR method, respectively.
Cell performance of the constructed CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSexS1−x sensitizers
The J–V curves of plain CdTe, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS QDSCs are displayed in Fig. 2c, and the average photovoltaic parameters based on five parallel cells are summarized in Table 2 (detailed parameters for individual cells are given in Table S2†). Despite that the FF values showed no significant difference among the three types of cells, both Jsc and Voc values showed remarkable enhancement for CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS samples compared to the plain CdTe samples. Furthermore, CdTe/CdSeS cells exhibited the highest Jsc (15.37 mA cm−2) among all the three studied types of cells, which derived from the red-shift of absorption spectra and improved light harvesting ability as indicated by the absorption spectra of TiO2 film electrodes in Fig. 2b. To further exploit the origin of the different Jsc values, the incident-photo-to-carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE, i.e. external quantum yield, EQE) was measured and the results are displayed in Fig. 2d. From these spectra, it can be seen that the IPCE curve of CdTe/CdSeS cells possessed the greatest values and widest light absorption range among the three types of cells. Meanwhile, the enhanced IPCE response was also observed in CdTe/CdS cells when compared with that of plain CdTe cells. This matched well with the variation trend of Jsc values as shown in the J–V characterizations (Fig. 2c). It is noted that the photocurrent response in the IPCE onsets at a wavelength of 750 nm for CdTe, 770 nm for CdTe/CdS and 790 nm for CdTe/CdSeS cells, respectively, is wider than the absorption spectral range of the photoanode, which attributed to the light scattering effect in IPCE measurement.46 Furthermore, the Voc of CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells has also been improved, and the enhanced Voc values derived from the accurate control of parasitic recombination processes, further analysis has been elaborated on in the next section. Benefiting from the enhanced Jsc and Voc, the PCE values of CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells were improved by ∼22 and 35%, respectively, meanwhile CdTe/CdSeS cells show the highest average PCE of 6.60% (Jsc = 15.37 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.626 V, FF = 0.686).

Impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage-decay measurement
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) was performed to reveal the change of interfacial charge transport and recombination characteristics after CdS or CdSeS had been coated onto the CdTe QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode. The IS measurement was carried out at forward bias ranging from −0.30 V to −0.60 V under dark conditions,47,48 and the detailed Nyquist curves under different bias for plain CdTe, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells are available in Fig. S1.† The extracted chemical capacitance (Cμ), recombination resistance (Rrec), and dark current from the corresponding Nyquist curves are shown in Fig. 4. It should be noted that there is not any obvious variation in the Cμ value for the three type of cells (Fig. 4a), which indicates that the position of the conduction band edge of TiO2 has not changed after the CdS or CdSeS coating.47 Nevertheless, great variation in Rrec occurred for the three type of cells as shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, the Rrec values of both CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells were improved in comparison with the plain CdTe cell. Table 3 shows the IS parameters extracted from Nyquist curves under forward bias of −0.60 V using the standard fitting models for QDSCs.47 As shown in Table 3, the Rrec value of CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells was 1.8 and 1.3 folds higher than that of plain CdTe cell, respectively, and Fig. 4c displays the direct contrast of the three samples at forward bias −0.60 V that is close to the Voc of the cells. Considering that the Rrec values are inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate,48 the enhanced Rrec indicates that the charge recombination process was significantly suppressed at the QD sensitizers/TiO2/electrolyte interfaces. As it is known that the suppression of the charge recombination process can effectively improve the open-circuit potential,12,49 the higher Rrec values can explain the enhanced Voc in the resultant CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells (as exhibited in Table 2). In addition, the CdTe/CdS cells showed higher Rrec values than the CdTe/CdSeS cells, which clarified the corresponding highest Voc among the three types of cells. The weaker dark current of CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells in comparison with that of plain CdTe cell (Fig. 4d) also reflects the reduced charge recombination process, which is consistent with the results of the Rrec values. Thus, these results indicate that CdS and CdSeS shells successfully act as a blocking layer to hinder change recombination at QD sensitizers/TiO2/electrolyte interfaces.

Open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) analysis was also carried out to measure the dynamics of the charge recombination process through monitoring the decay of Voc.50,51 To be specific, a steady Voc of the cell device was obtained by the illumination of a white LED (100 mW cm−2), and then the transient Voc variation was measured after switching off the illumination. Fig. 4e shows the representative Voc decay curves of the CdTe, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells. It should be noted that the Voc decay rate of CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells was significantly reduced compared with that of plain CdTe cells. Moreover, the electron lifetime has a direct connection with the Voc decay rate. The electron lifetime, τn, can be deduced from the following the equation of τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (298 K), and e is the electronic charge.50 According to the equation, the calculated τn curves of the three samples type were obtained and plotted in Fig. 4f. It was found that the trend of τn value is consistent with the Rrec results, where both CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells displayed longer electron times than CdTe cells at the same voltage conditions, and CdTe/CdS cells exhibited the longest electron time. The enhanced electron lifetime indicated CdS or CdSeS deposition on surface of the TiO2 matrix and that CdTe QDs can effectively passivate the surface trap states, thus hindering photogenerated electron recombination with the defect states or the oxidation species in the electrolyte, which matches well with the IS results.
All these results distinctly illustrate that the constructed type-II CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS QDSCs can enhance light harvesting capacity and light absorption range, as well as suppress charge recombination. Comparing the CdS and CdSeS shells, CdS deposition offers a more effective suppression of charge recombination due to a wider band gap, while CdSeS deposition provides higher light absorption ability and broader light harvesting range in resultant QDSCs. By balancing the influence of the two aspects, CdTe/CdSeS cells show the highest PCEs among the three types of cells. Furthermore, the stability of the obtained cells was also improved with the deposition of CdS and CdSeS shells (Fig. S2†). This is because the coating CdS and CdSeS shells can prevent the CdTe core from oxidization.
Optimization of CdSeS shell thickness
To further investigate the influence of CdSeS shell thickness on the resultant photovoltaic performance and to obtain higher PCE values of CdTe/CdSeS cells, different samples were prepared by repeating 2–8 cycles of CdSeS SILAR treatment. Fig. 5 shows representative J–V curves of the QDSCs prepared with different numbers of CdSeS cycles, and Table 4 shows the average photovoltaic parameters obtained from five cells in parallel for each condition, with the exception of the champion cell. The detailed results of the individual cells are given in Table S2.† Apparently, Voc, Jsc and the consequent PCE values significantly increased after the CdSeS coating. As shown in Table 4, it is found that the cell efficiency initially gradually improves with increasing the number of CdSeS cycles, and the cells with 5 CdSeS cycles obtained the maximum average PCE 7.10 ± 0.15% which is an increase of 46% in comparison with plain CdTe cells. However, after 6 cycles, CdSeS growth began to have a negative effect on the resultant cell efficiency, and a dramatic decline of cell performance is observed after 8 cycles. The observed negative effect on cell performance is ascribed to the excessive thick CdSeS layer on surface of the TiO2 matrix and CdTe QDs which blocks the mesoporous properties of the TiO2 film leading to a hampered redox couple of polysulfide electrolyte diffusion, and hindering the hole transfer from QD to polysulfide electrolyte.13,52,53 By optimizing the thickness of CdSeS shell, the maximum PCE of 7.24% (Jsc = 16.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.629 V, FF = 0.694) from a cell formed with 5 CdSeS cycles was obtained, which is among the highest efficiencies for type-II core/shell QDSCs.40–43

Conclusions
In summary, type-II CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS core/shell QDSCs were constructed by a low-temperature aqueous route. The PCEs of CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS cells were increased by ∼22 and 35%, respectively, in comparison with plain CdTe cells. The growth of CdS or CdSeS shells on the surface of the TiO2 matrix and CdTe QDs can effectively enhance light harvesting capacity and light absorption range as well as retard charge recombination, which has been proven by the UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO2 films, IPCE, IS, and OCVD characterizations, respectively. In addition, the thickness of shell play an important role in cell efficiency. With optimization of CdSeS shell thickness, an impressive PCE of 7.24% with average PCE 7.10 ± 0.15% was achieved, which is among the highest efficiencies for type-II core/shell QDSCs. The result provides a low-cost and convenient technology to further develop the third-generation photovoltaics.
