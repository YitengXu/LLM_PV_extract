    , Accepted 19th November 2019First published on 21st November 2019AbstractTwo mutually isomeric noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors (NC-FREAs) NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 containing two cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) moieties linked at the 2,6- and 1,5-positions, respectively, of the naphthalene ring were designed and synthesized for organic solar cells (OSCs). Intramolecular noncovalent S⋯O interactions were introduced into NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2. The tiny structural variation in NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 by just changing the linkage positions affects largely their molecular configuration, absorption, molecular packing, charge transport and photovoltaic performance. Compared to NOC6F-2, NOC6F-1 exhibits smaller distortions between cyclopentadithiophene and the naphthalene unit, leading to an extended conjugation and enhanced π–π stacking. NOC6F-2 exhibits a poor planarity, which restricts the electron delocalization as well as dense π–π stacking in the film form. When blended with PBDB-T, NOC6F-1 exhibits more orderly stacking along both the out-of-plane and in-plane directions than NOC6F-2. OSCs based on PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 merely showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.74% with lower Jsc and FF values. OSCs based on NOC6F-1 achieved a higher Jsc of 17.08 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.79%, thus leading to a significantly enhanced PCE of 10.62%. These results indicate that use of the acceptor molecules with a planar molecular backbone is an important design strategy for NC-FREAs.
Introduction
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have drawn significant attention for application in organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their distinct advantages such as broad and strong absorption1–4 and tunability of energy levels.5–8 Hitherto, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NFA based OSCs have reached over 16% for single junction devices9–11 and 17% for tandem devices.12 NFAs with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular architecture are of particular interest because of their stronger light-harvesting capability in the visible to near-infrared regions.13–15 Most OSCs with PCEs exceeding 11% employ A–D–A type small molecular acceptors.16–20 The central D units are usually fused-ring structures such as indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT). Such fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) usually possess a planar molecular structure, which is beneficial for efficient electron delocalization, face-on molecular arrangement, and charge transport in OSCs.21–25 However, the syntheses of such FREAs are challenging, often involving complicated synthesis procedures, low yields and multi-step purification.26,27
Noncovalent interactions, such as O⋯S, O⋯H, H⋯F, S⋯S, and S⋯F, have been used in developing high-performance organic semiconductors.28,29 Recently, a series of A–D–A type NFAs incorporating noncovalent interactions have been synthesized and applied in OSCs. Similar to covalently fused-ring acceptors, noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors (NC-FREAs) can also possess a planar ladder-like structure and exhibit good solubility.30 Broad absorption, efficient charge transport, exciton separation and PCEs comparable to FREAs can also be achieved for NC-FREAs.31–34 So far, optimized OSCs based on NC-FREAs have displayed an outstanding PCE of above 13% for single junction devices.35 More importantly, complicated synthesis procedures and low yields can be skillfully avoided. These results reveal that the strategy of incorporating noncovalent interactions into non-fullerene molecular acceptors has huge potential for low-cost high-performance OSCs.
To further enhance the photovoltaic performance of NC-FREA based OSCs, it is still meaningful to explore the effect of the molecular backbone, end-groups and side chains on their absorption, energy level, charge mobility and morphology. In addition, the “isomeric effect”, which has been widely explored in organic field-effect transistors and FREAs,19,36–39 is also valuable for being explored for NC-FREAs. On the basis of these considerations, herein, by virtue of noncovalent S⋯O interactions we designed and synthesized two mutually isomeric NC-FREAs NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2, which are composed of two cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) moieties linked at the 2,6- and 1,5-positions, respectively, of the naphthalene ring and two monofluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone electron-withdrawing end groups. Their absorption properties, molecular packing and charge transport behavior were extensively investigated. Compared with NOC6F-2, NOC6F-1 exhibited an enhanced planarity, a closer π–π stacking distance and an extended absorption. The as-cast devices based on PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 exhibited a superior PCE of 10.62% with a higher Jsc of 17.08 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.79%. For the OSCs based on PBDB-T:NOC6F-2, the PCE can only reach 6.74% due to the lower Jsc of 13.21 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.26%. Our studies have demonstrated that NC-FREAs are promising for achieving high performance organic solar cells.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 are displayed in Scheme 1 and the detailed information is provided in the ESI.† Taking 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,5-diol (1a) and 1,5-dibromonaphthalene-2,6-diol (1b) as starting materials, compounds 2a and 2b were obtained by alkylation of 1a and 1b with 1-bromohexane in 73% and 77% yields, respectively. Stille coupling of compound 3 with 2a and 2b afforded compounds 4a and 4b, respectively, in approximately 95% yields using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst precursor. Compounds 4a and 4b were subjected to lithiation with n-BuLi in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at −78 °C, and the formed dianions were subsequently quenched with anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to afford compounds 5a and 5b in 90% and 86% yields, respectively. NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 were prepared in 59% and 55% yields, respectively, by Knoevenagel condensation of 5a and 5b with compound 6. NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 exhibited excellent solubilities in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed at a heating or cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 and the curves showed no obvious crystallization or melting peak in the range of 80 to 300 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). Besides, it is observed from thermogravimetric curves (Fig. S2, ESI†) that the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 are 329 and 348 °C, respectively, indicating that NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 exhibit good thermal stabilities.

DFT calculations
The molecular geometry conformations of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The long alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the simulation procedure. As shown in Fig. 1, NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 exhibited torsion structures with the dihedral angles between the central naphthalene core and the cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) unit of 20° and 58°, respectively. The dihedral angles originate from the steric hindrance of hydrogen atoms on the naphthalene core and the adjacent thiophene ring. NOC6F-1 exhibited a smaller torsion angle than NOC6F-2; the reason is that the steric hindrance of the β position is weaker than the α position due to the para-H (α-H) of the naphthalene unit pointing directly towards the CPDT unit in NOC6F-2. NOC6F-1 is almost in planar conformation because of the intramolecular noncovalent S⋯O interactions. Enhanced planarity is conducive to good conjugation and intermolecular π–π interactions.30 Besides, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 were also calculated and the results are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The LUMO of NOC6F-1 has an electron density spreading across the entire molecule, while the electron density of the LUMO in NOC6F-2 is localized near the ending group due to the decrease in effective conjugation.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption properties of the two acceptor molecules are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1. In the CF solutions, these two acceptors exhibit a featureless absorption band in the range of 500 to 750 nm with a peak at 690 nm for NOC6F-1 and 632 nm for NOC6F-2, which may be attributed to their flexible and rotational conformations in solutions. The maximum molar extinction coefficients were determined to be 2.24 × 105 and 1.95 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2, respectively. On going from solution to film, NOC6F-1 showed a broader and structured absorption with two peaks at 665 and 717 nm, suggesting its aggregation in the film form. However, NOC6F-2 only exhibited a slightly broader absorption with the absorption peak slightly blue-shifted to 627 nm, indicating that it formed an amorphous structure in the film form. These results indicate that the tiny structural variation by just changing the linkage positions affects largely the molecule absorption and aggregation behaviors in the film form. According to the formula Eg,opt = 1240/λonset, the optical bandgaps (Eg,opt) deduced from the absorption edges (λedge) are 1.58 and 1.68 eV for NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2, respectively. In addition, the broad absorption of NOC6F-1 is complementary to that of PBDB-T, indicating that the PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 blend can capture a wider range of light.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to explore the electrochemical properties of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2. Ferrocene was chosen as an internal reference. The onset oxidation (Eonset,ox) and reduction potentials (Eonset,red) can be measured from the cyclic voltammograms as shown in Fig. 2c. By using the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eonset,ox/red − EFc/Fc+ + 4.80) eV, the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.55 and −5.50 eV for NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2, respectively. The LUMO energy levels were determined to be −3.77 and −3.72 eV for NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2, respectively. The higher LUMO energy levels of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 will be beneficial for high Voc in OSCs. The electrochemical data of the two NC-FREAs are summarized in Table 1, and the energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 2d.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performances of these two target acceptors were evaluated with an inverted solar cell structure of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. PBDB-T was chosen as the donor due to its favorable absorption complementary to NOC6F-1. Various conditions were carefully explored such as the D/A ratio, film thickness, additive and annealing temperature. The optimized device parameters are summarized in Table 2 and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are displayed in Fig. 3a. NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 displayed quite different photovoltaic performances. The OSCs based on PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 exhibited the highest PCE of 10.62% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 17.08 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.79% without any additive or post-treatment. However, the optimized OSCs based on NOC6F-2 afforded only a low PCE of 6.74% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 13.21 mA cm−2 and an FF of 53.26%. In addition, the high Voc for NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 based devices is related to their high LUMO levels. For PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 based devices, the high Jsc benefits from its broader absorption and the high FF value is due to its favorable carrier transport properties (vide infra).

External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 and PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 based devices were measured under monochromatic light and the curves are shown in Fig. 3b. The PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 based devices showed a photocurrent response in the range of 300 to 800 nm, which is stronger and broader than that of the PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 based ones, agreeing well with their film absorption spectra. The calculated Jsc values from the integration of the EQE curves are consistent with those from J–V measurements.
Charge mobilities
The hole mobility and the electron mobility of the blend films were determined by the SCLC method (shown in Fig. S5, ESI†) and the results are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). For the PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 film, the hole and electron mobilities are 2.56 × 10−3 and 2.07 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh value of 0.81. The PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 film exhibits hole and electron mobilities up to 8.39 × 10−4 and 6.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh value of 0.72. The results indicate that the PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 blend film has higher and more balanced charge transport capability, which is consistent with the Jsc and the FF of their devices.
Recombination dynamics
The exciton dissociation probability in the OSC devices was investigated by measuring photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) and the curves are shown in Fig. 3c. Jph is defined as the photocurrent density difference between illuminated (JL) and dark (JD) conditions. Veff equals V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent reaches zero and V is the applied voltage. When Jph reaches saturation (Jsat), it suggests that the exciton dissociation reaches the maximum level, and the charges are almost collected by the electrodes.40 The charge dissociation probabilities (P(E, T)), calculated from Jph/Jsat, of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 based OSCs, are 0.95 and 0.88, respectively, indicating that more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies occurred in NOC6F-1 based OSCs than NOC6F-2 based ones. To further understand the charge recombination behaviors of NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2 based solar cells, Jsc values under different light intensities (P) (Fig. 3d) are measured. The correlation between Jsc and Plight can be described by the equation Jsc ∝ Pα. When α = 1, it implies that no bimolecular recombination occurs. If α < 1, it indicates the existence of bimolecular recombination.5 The α values of PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 and PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 blend films are 0.92 and 0.87, respectively, demonstrating that NOC6F-1 based OSCs can better impede the bimolecular recombination than NOC6F-2 based ones, in accordance with the improved FF of PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 based devices compared with PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 based ones.
Non-radiative recombination losses
The non-radiative recombination losses in OSCs often constitute a significant part of the total energy losses, and are usually higher than those in inorganic or perovskite solar cells.41–43 The non-radiative energy losses are related to the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) via the equation qΔVnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL), where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.44 To further study the non-radiative recombination losses for NOC6F-1 or NOC6F-2 based OSCs, the EQEEL values are measured and the non-radiative recombination losses are 0.275 eV for NOC6F-1 and 0.286 eV for NOC6F-2 (Fig. S7, ESI†), indicating similar and low non-radiative recombination losses for both OSCs, which are comparable with amorphous Si or perovskite solar cells.41,42,45
Morphological characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed to explore the morphological characteristics of the active layers. The AFM images (Fig. S8a and b, ESI†) indicate that PBDB-T and these two acceptors exhibit good miscibility in the blend films, and the active layers are smooth with relatively low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.56 nm for PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 and 1.33 nm for PBDB-T:NOC6F-2, respectively. In the TEM images as shown in Fig. S8c and d (ESI†), fibril structures, which are beneficial to charge carrier generation and transportation,46–48 can be observed for both blend films. Besides, to investigate the molecular orientation and stacking behavior in the blend film, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured and the results are shown in Fig. 4. In the out-of-plane direction, the pristine PBDB-T presents a π–π stacking (010) peak at qz = 1.67 Å−1, corresponding to a d of 3.76 Å. For the PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 blend film, an enhanced π–π stacking (010) peak at qz = 1.65 Å−1 (d = 3.80 Å) emerges, suggesting that NOC6F-1 exhibits a closely ordered face-on packing. In contrast, for the PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 blend film, the (010) peak (qz = 1.64 Å−1, d = 3.82 Å) becomes weaker, demonstrating the existence of a more disordered structure of NOC6F-2 in the active layer. In the in-plane direction, the PBDB-T:NOC6F-1 blend film presents a stronger (100) peak at qxy = 0.30 Å−1 (d = 21.03 Å) than the PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 one (qxy = 0.30 Å−1, d = 21.14 Å), indicating that a more well-organized arrangement exists in the blend film of NOC6F-1. Hence, when blended with PBDB-T, NOC6F-1 exhibits more orderly stacking along both the out-of-plane and in-plane directions than NOC6F-2. The presence of orderly stacking along the out-of-plane for NOC6F-1 is more favorable for charge transport.

Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized two noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors NOC6F-1 and NOC6F-2, which are mutual isomers with the same side-chains and end-groups. The isomeric structures had a significant effect on the molecular stacking, absorption, charge transport and photovoltaic performances. Compared to NOC6F-2, NOC6F-1 exhibited smaller distortions between cyclopentadithiophene units and the central naphthalene unit, which resulted in an extended conjugation and enhanced π–π stacking. The molecular backbone of NOC6F-2 exhibited a poor planarity, which could restrict the delocalization of π electrons. When blended with PBDB-T, OSCs based on PBDB-T:NOC6F-2 merely showed a PCE of 6.74% with low Jsc and FF values. OSCs based on NOC6F-1 achieved a higher Jsc of 17.08 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.79%, thus leading to a significantly enhanced PCE of 10.62%. More importantly, our results demonstrated that the 2,6-linked naphthalene unit can be used as a core to synthesize NC-FREAs for high efficiency OSCs.
