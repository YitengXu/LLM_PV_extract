    , Accepted 30th January 2018First published on 2nd February 2018AbstractTo broaden the absorption spectrum, improve intramolecular electronic push–pull balance capability, enhance electron transfer and promote the photovoltaic performances of dye sensitizers, four new polymeric metal complex dyes (PBDTT-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu) with donor–acceptor–π-bridge-acceptor (D–A–π–A) structure were designed and synthesized. These dyes, for the first time, used the complexes of Cd(II) or Cu(II) with phenanthroline as auxiliary electron acceptors (A) instead of organic electron withdrawing groups and adopted thienylbenzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDTT) or hydroquinone (PV) derivatives as electron donors (D) and 8-quinolinol derivatives as π bridge and acceptors (A). The impacts of different auxiliary electron acceptors (A) of metal complexes due to their thermal, optical, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance were also investigated. The best power conversion efficiency of 6.68% was achieved in PBDTT-PhenCd DSSC device. In addition, all dyes showed outstanding thermal stability (Td > 300 °C). The results revealed that these novel polymeric metal complex dyes are potential materials for constructing new sensitizers of high performance.
Introduction
Since the first report published in 1991 by Michael Grätzel et al., dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as one of the most efficient devices to convert sunlight to electricity,1,2 have been extensively investigated by researchers due to their impressive advantages,3,4 such as really low cost, high efficiency and renewability.5–7 The performance of DSSCs is intrinsically regulated by light absorption, charge generation and multi-channel charge transfer dynamics, which are primarily dependent on the dye sensitizer.8–10 In recent years, numerous endeavors have been devoted to designing and synthesizing sensitizers for DSSCs, which generally fall into two groups: (1) metal organic dyes, which possess multiple absorption peaks and long-term stability compared to metal-free organic dyes. Noble ruthenium complexes11,12 are classical representatives, which have long been the champion dye sensitizers owing to their high efficiencies. Nowadays, DSSCs based on ruthenium complexes achieve more than 11.9% power conversion efficiency (PCE).13 However, they suffer from some of the following drawbacks: (i) complicated synthesis; (ii) difficult purification steps; (iii) resource limitations (ruthenium is a rare metal), which may limit practical applications.14 (2) Metal-free organic dyes,15 which usually feature the structure of donor–π-bridge-acceptor (D–π–A).16–18 Organic dyes, relative to Ru-complexes, exhibit encouraging properties: abundant material sources, lower cost, and easier synthesis and manufacturing processes.19,20 However, D–π–A metal-free organic dyes also have the following disadvantages: narrow absorption, charge recombination and low stability. Introducing an auxiliary acceptor into traditional D–π–A organic dyes for enhancing the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) and decreasing the optical band gap can enhance the performance according to the reports of researchers in this area.19,21 Therefore, D–A–π–A motif sensitizers have great appeal.
In 2011, the concept of D–A–π–A was proposed by Zhu et al.22 Very recently, with this novel strategy, organic dye WS-5 using benzotriazole derivative as auxiliary acceptors exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8.35%.23 In addition, YA422 dye with indoline derivative as the electron donor and quinoxaline as auxiliary acceptor achieved a PCE of 10.65%,24 while SM315 dye with porphyrin as donor and benzothiadiazole as auxiliary acceptor achieved a PCE of 13.0%.25 It has been found that D–A–π–A sensitizers for DSSCs can simultaneously tune energy levels, broaden absorption spectrum, improve photovoltaic performance and enhance the stability by choosing different auxiliary acceptors and donors.26–28 According to previous research, ligands carry favorable light-harvesting abilities and are therefore crucial in determining the overall power conversion efficiencies.29 Adopting the metal complex as an auxiliary electron acceptor can alter the electron-withdrawing ability by changing its coordination bond. Numerous metal complex dyes based on D–A–π–A have been investigated, which are expected to become good auxiliary electron acceptors for high performance dyes.29,30 The BDTT unit with bithienyl conjugated side chains is an excellent donor because of its stronger donating ability, broad absorption, lower HOMO energy level, higher hole mobility, and good photovoltaic performance, which are benefitted from the planar molecular structure of BDT unit.31,32
In this study, four polymers containing the D–A–π–A molecule structure have been synthesized. In particular, phenanthroline–metal (Cd(II) or Cu(II)) complexes, which are expected to exhibit extended absorption spectra, higher extinction coefficients and relatively higher stability, served as auxiliary electron acceptors together with the π-bridge, which plays a vital role in tuning charge-transfer due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of complexes, thus achieving the higher conversion efficiency. In addition, investigations of the influence of phenanthroline-metal (Cd(II) or Cu(II)) complexes, rather than organic electron-withdrawing groups, as auxiliary electron acceptors with different donors in the π-bridge on the optical, thermal and photovoltaic performance of various D–A–π–A sensitizers were conducted and the detailed results will be discussed in the following sections.

Fabrication of DSSCs devices
DSSCs with the sandwich structure was composed of the following components: a semiconductor electrode, usually TiO2; a sensitizer (dye molecules); an electrolyte; a counter electrode; a working electrode.43 Fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting-glass (FTO) was washed via ultrasonication in water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol, sequentially; then, it was subjected to O3 treatment for 10 min. The substrates were treated with a solution of aqueous TiCl4 (40 mmol L−1) at 70 °C for 30 min and cleaned using deionized water and ethanol. TiO2 film was prepared by coating 20–30 nm colloidal particles onto the as-prepared FTO glass via the sliding glass rod method. The TiO2 coated FTO substrates were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. To obtain a 15 μm thick TiO2 film, this process was repeated two more times. After cooling to 100 °C, the TiO2 film was immersed in DMF solution containing 0.5 mmol L−1 dye (for PPV-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu, PBDTT-PhenCd and PBDTT-PhenCu) for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the films were flushed with anhydrous ethanol and dried in air. The electrolyte containing 0.5 mol L−1 LiI, 0.05 mol L−1 I2 and 0.5 mol L−1 4-tert-butylpyridine was introduced into the surface of the TiO2 electrodes. The cells were fabricated using the modified TiO2 electrode with a Pt foil as the counter electrode. The dye-coated semiconductor film was illuminated through the conducting glass supported without a mask.
Characterization of the dyes
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the four polymers were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Lambada-25 spectrometer (USA). Samples were dissolved in DMF and diluted to solutions of 10−5 mol L−1. UV-vis spectrum was recorded on a Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer with a xenon lamp as the light source. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a Shimadzu TGA-7 Instrument in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 from 25 to 800 °C. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were performed on WATER 2414 system equipped with a set of HT3, HT4 and HT5, l-styragel columns using DMF as eluent (1.0 mL min−1) at 80 °C, calibrated by polystyrene standard.
Cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CH Instruments chi630c Electrochemical Workstation in a 0.1 mol L−1 [Bu4N]BF4(Bu = butyl) acetonitrile solution with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature. A glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and SCE as the reference electrode were used. Ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was used for the redox potential calibration.44 Photocurrent–voltage curves were recorded using a Keithley 2602 Source meter under the 100 mW cm−2 irradiation of a 500W Xe lamp with a global AM 1.5 filters for solar spectrum simulation. The measurement of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) was performed by a Zolix DCS 300 PA Data acquisition system and other optical systems. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were achieved on a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer with the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100000 Hz and the alternative signal of 10 mV.
Theoretical calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09 program package using the hybrid B3LYP functional together with LANL2DZ basis set for cadmium and copper atoms and 6-31G set for other atoms.45,46 The values of the HOMO and LUMO were plotted with Multiwfn and VMD software46 only with the alfa electron for polymeric Cu(II)complexes.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route of the monomers and the four target polymeric metal complexes are depicted in Scheme 1. Four polymeric Cd(II) or Cu(II) complexes were prepared by Yamamoto coupling reaction of metal complexes PhenCd and PhenCu with donors BDT and PV. The metal complexes PhenCd and PhenCu were obtained by the coordination reaction of compounds 6 and 4 with Cd(II) or Cu(II) acetate. Compound 6 was prepared from 5-formyl-8-hydroxyqzlinoline (5) by Knoevenagel condensation reaction and N-octyl substituted 2-(2,5-dibromothiophen-3-yl)-1-octal-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (4) was synthesized by a series of reactions from 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (1) and 2,5-dibromothiophene-3-carbaldehyde (2). Compound 3 was obtained by cyclodehydrogenation of the Schiff base under air. The mediator compounds 3 and 4 were thoroughly analyzed by 1H NMR (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The monomer 6 was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†). The 1H NMR spectral data were consistent with the proposed structures. The polymer structure characterization consisted of the elemental analysis, FT-IR spectra and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrenes as standards. The corresponding data are listed in Table 1. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the four polymeric metal complexes were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as standard in DMF eluent. From the results of GPC, polymers PPV-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd have Mn values of 8.9, 9.5, 9.7 and 10.9 kg mol−1, respectively, with a polydispersity index (PDI) from 1.75 to 2.28; the average number of repeating units in the four dyes were 7, 8, 8 and 8, respectively. From the abovementioned results, combined with elemental analysis, it can be suggested that the target polymers were synthesized successfully. These polymers showed certain solubilities in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) solvents at room temperature, but they could not be dissolved well in chloroform or other solvents. The metal complexes PhenCd and PhenCu and polymers PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu, and PPV-PhenCu were characterized by IR (Fig. S4, ESI†). It can be observed that there is a visible absorption band at about 3426–3434 cm−1, which is attributed to the O–H stretching vibrations. The peaks at 2933–2923 cm−1 and 2844–2855 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of the alkyl chains. As the strong absorption values of O–H and alkyl chains are nearly the same, it is difficult to observe the underlying weak peaks of the aromatic C–H stretching vibrations. The peaks at 2209–2207 cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching frequency of thiocyanate group (CN); it is easy to find that polymerization made it slightly weaker. CN–M stretching vibration peaks of the metal complexes appeared at 1123 cm−1 and 1126 cm−1, while the corresponding peaks of polymers PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCu were located at 1103 cm−1, 1102 cm−1, 1107 cm−1 and 1106 cm−1, respectively. Accordingly, the peaks at 523 cm−1 and 525 cm−1 for metal complexes PhenCd and PhenCu, respectively and the peaks at 491–497 cm−1 for polymers PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCu were caused by N–M bond stretching vibrations.47–49 From the data, it can be found that the peaks of corresponding polymeric metal complexes PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCu show about 20–30 cm−1 red-shift compared to those of metal complexes PhenCd and PhenCu, which is probably due to copolymerizations, leading to the increase in conjugation in the system.

Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of metal complexes PhenCd, PhenCu and the polymeric metal complexes PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCu in DMF solution (10−5 mol L−1) are shown in Fig. 1; the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The metal complexes PhenCd and PhenCu show maximum absorption peaks at 381 nm and 363 nm, respectively, which is primarily ascribed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer. In addition, the maximum absorption peaks of polymers PBDTT-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCd appeared at 523 nm and 434 nm, respectively, while PBDTT-PhenCu and PPV-PhenCu showed maximum absorption peaks at 504 nm and 411 nm. It can be easily found that the polymeric metal complex dyes containing Cd(II) show better light absorption than the dyes containing Cu(II) on using the same donor, which probably results from the larger radius of Cd ion than that of Cu ion, leading to the better coordination ability of metal complex PhenCd than that of PhenCu. In comparison with the metal complexes, the maximum absorption of the polymers exhibited distinct red-shifts owing to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated system in polymers during the ICT (intramolecular charge transfer) between donor and acceptor unit. Compared to the dyes PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu with alkoxy benzene as the donor, the absorption spectra of PBDTT-PhenCd and PBDTT-PhenCu with benzodithiophene derivative as the donor exhibited red-shifts by 89 and 93 nm, respectively. This was the result of introducing benzodithiophene derivatives with strong electron-donating ability into the backbone. This indicated that ligands can be modified with electron donor moieties to broaden the absorption spectra and the central metal ion can be changed to raise the HOMO energy of the complex, leading to a red shifted absorption. This observation provided a clearer roadmap to rationally extend the wavelength response compared to the organic auxiliary electron acceptors dyes.

Fig. 1b shows the normalized photoluminescence spectra of polymers PPV-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd; the correlative data of the polymers are summarized in Table 2. PL peaks of the four polymers were found to decrease in the order PBDTT-PhenCd (593) > PBDTT-PhenCu (578) > PPV-PhenCd (513) > PPV-PhenCu (486), which is consistent with the maximum absorption wavelengths, most probably to a successively lowered excited state.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the target polymeric Cd(II) or Cu(II) complexes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 2a shows the cyclic voltammetry curves of polymers PPV-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd; the corresponding data are listed in Table 3. In addition, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels and Eg (electrochemical bandgaps) of the four polymers were estimated according to the literature.49 From Table 3, it could be found that the HOMO energy levels of PPV-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd were estimated to be −5.46, −5.43, −5.37 and −5.35 eV and the corresponding LUMO levels of the four polymers were estimated to be −3.18, −3.21, −3.32 and −3.35 eV, respectively. Clearly, these HOMO energy values were lower than the standard potential of I3−/I− redox couple (−4.83 eV), which can guarantee the efficient regeneration of the excited dye molecules. Moreover, the LUMO values of the dyes were higher than that of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.26 eV), ensuring that electrons transfer efficiently from the excited state to the reduced dye molecules. Considering these results, the four polymers can be suggested as promising potential sensitizers in DSSCs. The calculated Eg of PPV-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd were 2.28, 2.22, 2.05, and 2.00 eV, respectively. It could be easily found that sensitizers based on BDTT, namely, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd exhibited better properties than those based on alkoxy benzene, namely, PPV-PhenCu and PPV-PhenCd, because on excitation, the narrower band gap indicates easier charge separation. Furthermore, polymeric Cd(II)complexes are more superior to Cu(II) complexes according to the data in Table 3, which is probably due to the stronger coordination ability of Cd(II) than Cu(II) caused by the larger radius of Cd(II) than that of Cu(II), leading to stronger electron-withdrawing ability of Cd(II) complexes than Cu(II) complexes.

Theoretical calculations
To investigate the impact of donor and using Cd(II) or Cu(II) complexes with phenanthroline as auxiliary electron acceptors (A) on the electronic distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the PBDTT-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09 program package using the level of B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ. To simplify the computations, the four new polymeric metal complex dyes were regarded as homopolymers. The optimized molecular structures and electron distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of PBDTT-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu are exhibited in Fig. 3. Clearly, the electron density of the HOMO levels was primarily delocalized over the metal complex moieties, while the LUMO levels were distributed on the 8-quinolinol derivative. Such electron distributions facilitate the charge separation from BDTT/PPV donor to 8-quinolinol derivative acceptor, resulting in the efficient electron transfer process. As shown in Fig. 3, it can be easily observed that the shapes of the four polymeric metal complex dyes were non-planar, which was beneficial for the ICT process caused by decreased charge recombination between the dye molecules.

Photovoltaic properties
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs devices based on the four polymeric Cd(II) or Cu(II) complexes are displayed in Fig. 4a and b; the corresponding parameters, namely, short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) are listed in Table 4. As shown in the Fig. 4a, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for dyes using BDTT and PV as donors exhibited a broad spectral response resembling their absorption spectra, indicating that the four dyes can efficiently convert the visible light into photocurrent. In addition, it can be easily observed that the device based on PBDTT-PhenCd showed the highest IPCE in the range of 400–500 nm, which may be ascribed to the expansion of the π framework and promotion of electron transfer due to the introduction of BDTT. However, it was weaker than the device based on N719 dyes, which has excellent IPCE values of over 80% at 425 nm.50

The devices based on four polymers showed open-circuit voltage (VOC) values in the order of PBDTT-PhenCd (0.72 V) > PBDTT-PhenCu (0.71 V) > PPV-PhenCd (0.68 V) > PPV-PhenCu (0.65 V), which may be ascribed to the gradually increased HOMO energy level of the dye. Facile dye regeneration by lowering the HOMO energy level of the dye has been proven to increase the VOC by reducing the charge recombination between the oxidized sensitizer and conduction band (Ecb) of TiO2.51 For JSC, the devices based on four polymers showed the trend of PBDTT-PhenCd (13.00 mA cm−2) > PBDTT-PhenCu (12.62 mA cm−2) > PPV-PhenCd (9.59 mA cm−2)> PPV-PhenCu (9.05 mA cm−2), which was consistent with the IPCE spectra. The JSC values of the PBDTT-PhenCd and PBDTT-PhenCu cells were greater than that of the PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu devices because of the stronger electron-donating ability of BDTT compared to PV. In addition, the DSSCs devices based on polymeric complexes containing Cd(II) exhibited higher JSC than Cu(II) polymeric complexes when the same donor was used owing to the stronger coordination bond between cadmium ion and ligand compared to that between copper ion and ligand, contributing to electron transportation in the dye molecules. The PCE of the devices decreased in the order of PBDTT-PhenCd (6.68%) > PBDTT-PhenCu (6.25%) > PPV-PhenCd (4.58%) > PPV-PhenCu (4.05%). Of all the polymers, the device based on PBDTT-PhenCd exhibited the best performance, which may be related to the enhanced photocurrent (JSC). From the abovementioned data, it is easily observed that there is only a slight difference among these polymers in terms of VOC and FF, while JSC values are significantly different. The JSC values are closely associated with the molecular structures and electrochemical and photophysical properties of the dye molecules, which in turn, depend on the electron-donating ability of donor moiety (D) and the electron-accepting ability of acceptor group (A) as well as with the appropriate π bridge. Therefore, by optimizing the structures of the polymers, the JSC values can also be increased.
Stability
The thermal stabilities are important parameters for sensitizers used in DSSCs, which can be revealed by thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analyses. From Fig. S5 (ESI†), the TGA results showed that polymers PPV-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd showed good thermal stability with 5% weight loss at relatively high decomposition temperatures (Td) of 308, 315, 326, and 335 °C in nitrogen, respectively. In addition, the DSC results revealed the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of these synthesized sensitizers ranging from 124 °C to 135 °C; the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Apparently, it is found that the four polymeric Cd(II) or Cu(II) complexes show good thermal stability with the Td values all above 300 °C and also, the Td values for PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd were higher than those for PPV-PhenCu and PPV-PhenCd. This indicted that the complexes based on BDTT have better thermal stabilities due to the better coplanarity of BDTT and the larger molecular weight. The stability of DSSCs sensitized with each of the four sensitizers under simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) at room temperature with an ionic liquid-based electrolyte was investigated. The photovoltaic parameters of various devices were recorded over a period of 250 h (Fig. 5). The devices based on PBDTT-PhenCu, PBDTT-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu and PPV-PhenCd maintained around 91.31%, 90.24%, 87.99% and 86.61%, respectively, of their initial efficiencies after 250 h of illumination. These results indicated that the DSSCs based on PBDTT-PhenCu and PBDTT-PhenCd were superior to those based on PPV-PhenCu and PPV-PhenCd in terms of the power conversion efficiency and long term stability of the dyes.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed in the dark with a voltage range of 5.5 V–8.5 V to obtain the chemical capacitance (Cμ), the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rct), and the electron lifetime (τn), which could help in deeply understanding the photovoltaic behavior of the DSSCs. The results of the EIS analysis of the devices based on PBDTT-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu are depicted in Fig. 6. The conduction band electron density caused by the charge recombination reaction and the movement of the TiO2 conduction band, which could be investigated from the chemical capacitance (Cμ), is an important factor that affects the VOC performance.52 As shown in Fig. 6a, the Cμ of the four new polymeric metal complex dye-sensitized DSSCs have minor differences. However, the trend of Rct values in these dye-based DSSCs is PBDTT-PhenCd > PBDTT-PhenCu > PPV-PhenCd > PPV-PhenCu, indicating that the impact of charge recombination reaction on the VOC of all these DSSCs is much greater than that of the TiO2 conduction band edge.
 Fig. 6  Plots of (a) Cμ, (b) Rct and (c) τnversus bias voltage of DSSCs based on PBDTT-PhenCu, PBDTT-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu and PPV-PhenCd. 
The electron lifetime (τn) of DSSCs based on PBDTT-PhenCd, PBDTT-PhenCu, PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu with iodine electrolytes were calculated from the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rct) using the equations τn = Rct × Cμ,53,54 which were plotted as a function of VOC for the four polymeric metal complex dyes (Fig. 6c). Generally, the longer the electron lifetime of the device, the greater would be the recombination resistance, resulting in a high VOC. As shown in Fig. 6c, compared to the device based on dyes with alkoxy benzene as donor (PPV-PhenCd, PPV-PhenCu), the device based on the dyes with benzodithiophene derivative as donor exhibited much longer electron lifetime. These results suggested that the benzodithiophene bulky donor moiety can prevent massive charge recombination more effectively than alkoxy benzene donor. Moreover, the τn of the PBDTT-PhenCd-based device is large, indicating that the charge recombination processes of the PBDTT-PhenCd-device is slow and the VOC is high, which is also in agreement with the trend of the VOC values of the DSSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, four D–A–π–A polymer dyes, using the complexes of Cd(II) or Cu(II) with phenanthroline as auxiliary electron acceptors (A), thienylbenzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDTT) or hydroquinone (PV) derivative as electron donor (D), were successfully synthesized and characterized. Their optical, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were investigated. It could be found that the electron-withdrawing ability of metal complexes as auxiliary electron acceptors and the electron-donor ability of donors can influence the performance of these dyes. The DSSCs based on the dyes containing benzodithiophene with alkyl thienyl substituents as donor (PBDTT-PhenCd, 6.68%; PBDTT-PhenCu, 6.25%) achieved higher power conversion efficiencies than those with hydroquinone derivative as donor (PPV-PhenCd, 4.58%; PPV-PhenCu, 4.05%) under standard illumination, which may be ascribed to the broadened absorption caused by the enhanced electron-donating ability of BDTT relative to PV in PPV-PhenCd and PPV-PhenCu. The DSSCs based on PBDTT-PhenCd displayed better device performance than that of PBDTT-PhenCu, which may be attributed to the enhanced electron-withdrawing ability caused by the stronger coordination bond of Cd(II) with phenanthroline compared to Cu(II). In addition, the novel polymeric metal dyes showed good thermal stability (Td > 300 °C).
Although their photoelectric conversion efficiencies are not too high, all regulations and discoveries discussed above are the foundations for designing D–A–π–A motif dyes of polymeric metal complexes by molecular engineering. Our study on this evolving field is in progress. Higher photon-harvesting efficiency will be realized by tuning the HOMO and LUMO levels, broadening the light absorption and extending the π-conjugated system of polymer molecule. Further studies for synthesizing sensitizers by employing easy preparation methods that are cost-effective and environmentally friendly are in progress.
