    , Accepted 8th October 2020First published on 10th October 2020AbstractTo understand the fundamental mechanism of aggregation-induced phosphorescent emission (AIPE) and to improve the development of mechanochromic molecules, five new Pt(II) complexes Pt-1–Pt-5 bearing different terminal substituents on 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene (N^C^N) ligands were designed and synthesized. Their photophysical properties have been investigated systematically via a series of spectroscopic methods. Upon excitation, the solid states of these Pt complexes exhibit tunable emissions from yellow to red, and complexes Pt-2 and Pt-3 with a large steric hindrance display remarkable AIPE properties in a tetrahydrofuran/H2O mixture. All complexes, except Pt-5, show evident mechanochromic and vapochromic behaviors. Based on in-depth experimental studies, the reason for the mechanochromic behavior could be the change in the distance of the neighboring Pt complexes, which causes a switching of the emission state from 3π,π*/3MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) to 3MLCT. The above results suggest an example of phosphorescence tuning by a switching of the triplet excited state in the solid state, and provide a mechanism of mechanochromic behavior. Furthermore, complex Pt-2 was used as an emission ink in the field of advanced anti-counterfeiting.
Introduction
The study of cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes has experienced exponential growth because of their unique photophysical properties and versatile potential applications from low-power upconversion1–4 and dye-sensitized solar cells5–8 to organic light-emitting devices,9–11 chemosensors,12,13 and nonlinear optics.14–17 Their abundant photophysical properties and applications originate intrinsically from multiple excited states, including ligand-localized π,π* transitions, metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT), and intraligand charge transfer (ILCT). Pt(II) molecules with square-planar geometry favour the formation of dimers or aggregate species through intermolecular Pt–Pt and π–π interactions under an external mechanical force, which results in significant changes in spectroscopic properties and excited states. These variations make them potential candidates for application in pressure sensors, optical recording, security inks, and memory devices.18–22
It is worth noting that compared with common fluorescent materials, phosphorescent mechanoresponsive Pt(II) complexes usually exhibit long-lived triplet excited states, larger Stokes shifts and obvious spectral shifts after grinding, which favours their practical application. However, transition-metal complexes usually exhibit a low luminescence efficiency in the solid or aggregated state because of the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect, which limits the real-world applications of mechanochromic materials significantly.23 In 2001, the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon was observed by Tang et al., and the aggregation-induced phosphorescent emission (AIPE) phenomenon has been discovered by Li and co-workers in transition metal complexes.24 These works sparked a rapid expansion in the field of photoluminescent and electroluminescent materials.25 As a result, a variety of molecules with simultaneous AIE/AIPE and piezochromism have been developed in the recent past, which provides direction for the development of more efficient piezochromic materials.21,26–29
Pt(II) complexes with the 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene (N^C^N) ligand were among the brightest Pt-based emitters that have been used in organic light-emitting devices.30 In previous work, Pt(II) complexes with modified N^C^N ligands showed remarkable luminescence changes from yellow to red upon mechanical grinding.31,32 However, an insufficient molecular-level understanding of the relationship between the molecular packing characteristics and the resulting optical properties makes it difficult to forecast whether a designed molecular model will possess luminescence switching properties. Chen's group reported a series of planar Pt(II) diimine complexes that exhibit remarkable luminescence vapochromic, thermochromic and mechanochromic properties because of changes in Pt–Pt interactions, which may result in the conversion of the 3MLCT/3LLCT emission state into the 3MMLCT state.33,34 The ground- and excited-state properties of these Pt(II) complexes can be readily tuned by modifying the ligand structures, such as by changing the substituent from electron-withdrawing to electron-donating groups, tuning the degree of π-conjugation and alternating different linkages between components.35–37 Therefore, the development of a novel class of Pt(II) complexes with N^C^N ligands is of fundamental importance in understanding the underlying mechanisms for stimuli-responsive luminescence switching, which will guide us to design novel phosphors, explore practical applications and promote technological innovations.
Inspired by these ideas, herein, a series of new Pt(II) complexes with different N^C^N ligands were designed and synthesized (Scheme 1). The distinct differences between the complexes Pt-1–Pt-5 are embodied in the structure of the cyclometalated ligands in which the fluorenyl are modified via electron-donating (phenothiazine and tert-butyl carbazole) and electron-withdrawing (benzothiazole and naphthalimide) substituents. Branched alkyl chains were introduced on the ligands to improve the solubility and prevent the intermolecular π–π stacking. Their photophysical properties in the solution and solid state could be tuned by altering substituents. Complexes Pt-2 and Pt-3 with a sterically bulky group exhibit remarkable aggregation-induced phosphorescent emissions. All Pt(II) complexes except Pt-5 show a colour-tuned piezochromic luminescence in response to mechanical grinding. This example requires an understanding of the structure–property relationship of the solid-state luminescent materials under mechanical stimuli. In addition, complex Pt-2 shows promise as an emission ink in advanced anti-counterfeiting. All complexes are expected to show potential application for multi-functional materials.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Complexes Pt-1–Pt-5 were prepared by reacting ligands L1–L5 with Pt(DMSO)2Cl2 in refluxing acetic acid under nitrogen for 24 h. The synthetic routes and procedures for Pt-1–Pt-5 are shown in Scheme S1 and the Experimental section in the ESI,† respectively. Their structures were determined by 1H NMR, ESI-HRMS, elemental analyses and single crystal structure analyses, all of which showed satisfactory results.
Ground state UV-vis absorption
All Pt(II) complexes obey Beer's law in CH2Cl2 (1 × 10−6 ∼ 1 × 10−4 M) wherein no ground-state aggregation was observed. The UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1a and the detailed photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. These complexes exhibit intense absorption bands and a broad tail. Compared with other Pt(II) chloride complexes with similar structures,38–40 the major absorption bands, except Pt-4, can be attributed to ligand-centered 1π,π* transitions; whereas the broad tail is dominated by the 1MLCT/1ILCT transition. The spectrum of Pt-4, which is dominated by an intense absorption band at λmax = 360 nm, is significantly different from those of the other complexes. Considering the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results shown in Table 2 and Table S1,† this band could be attributed to 1MLCT/1ILCT transitions mixed with a significant 1π,π* transition component, in other words, the lowest-energy 1MLCT (dπ(Pt) → π*(1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene)) and 1ILCT (π(fluorene) → π*(benzothiazole)). What's more, Pt-5 shows an obvious broad and strong absorption band from 370 to 440 nm due to the 1π,π* transitions of the naphthalimide ligand with little contribution from 1MLCT/1ILCT. Namely, the lowest-energy 1MLCT (dπ(Pt) → π*(1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene)) and 1ILCT (π(fluorene) → π*(naphthalimide)). Moreover, compared with Pt-1, other Pt(II) complexes exhibit stronger absorption intensities and minor bathochromic shifts. The reason for the bathochromic shift is that the addition of terminal substituents on 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene (N^C^N) ligands increases the intramolecular charge transfer (1MLCT/1ILCT). The assignment of the 1MLCT/1ILCT transition for Pt-1–Pt-5 can be supported by solvent-dependence studies (Fig. S1, ESI†). The assignment of this lowest energy absorption band is also supported by DFT calculations, which will be discussed in detail in the following section.

Excited state properties
Emission spectra of Pt(II) complexes Pt-1–Pt-5 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1b. The excitation of these complexes at their respective visible charge-transfer bands at room temperature results in green-to-yellow luminescence as shown in the CIE chromaticity coordinates (Pt-1 (0.29, 0.67), Pt-2 (0.31, 0.65), Pt-3 (0.32, 0.64), Pt-4 (0.41, 0.58), and Pt-5 (0.34, 0.53), Fig. S2†). Despite the different terminal substituents, the emission spectra of these complexes all resemble each other, except Pt-5, and they are quenched readily by air in CH2Cl2 solutions (Fig. S3, ESI†). Complexes Pt-1–Pt-3 exhibit well-structured emission at room temperature with band maxima at 531, 532, and 535 nm, which shows a minor solvatochromic effect (Fig. S4, ESI†). The emission lifetimes of Pt-1–Pt-3 range from 2.5–5.3 μs, and the emitting state could be assigned to the ligand-localized 3π,π* state.41–43 In contrast, the emission of Pt-4 shows a negative solvatochromic effect in different solvents as shown in Fig. S4, ESI.†Pt-4 exhibits a shorter lifetime (1.1 μs) and lower quantum yield (ΦPL = 0.12 in CH2Cl2). It can be concluded that the emission of Pt-4 has a significant contribution from the mixture of the 3MLCT/3π,π* state.38 However, Pt-5 exhibits a relatively short lifetime (4.3 ns), and little oxygen dependence. Moreover, the emission of Pt-5 exhibits a positive solvatochromic effect (Fig. S4, ESI†). Both the emission (wavelength, lifetime) and positive solvatochromism are similar to those observed in the ligand (Fig. S5, ESI†). Therefore, the observed emission for Pt-5 can be assigned to the 1ILCT fluorescence from the ligand with some 1MLCT character.44,45
DFT calculations
To better understand the nature of the ground and low-lying singlet excited states, Density-Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of Pt-1–Pt-5 were carried out in CH2Cl2. The ground-state electron density distribution of the five HOMOs (highest occupied molecular orbitals) and five LUMOs (lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) of Pt-1–Pt-5 are shown in Table 2 and Table S1.† The LUMO is almost exclusively π*(1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene)-based for all complexes, except for Pt-5, which is located on naphthalimide and fluorenyl components. The LUMO+1 of Pt-5 is similar to that of the other four complexes. The compositions of the HOMO vary because of substituent variation on the ligands from electron-withdrawing to electron-donating groups. The HOMO is localized primarily on the 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene ligands and the Pt atom in Pt-1, Pt-4 and Pt-5, whereas the HOMO of Pt-2 and Pt-3 is on the Pt atom, electron-donating groups (phenothiazine and tert-butyl carbazate), and has a minor contribution from the attached fluorene. The nature of the major electronic transitions of complexes Pt-1–Pt-5 in CH2Cl2 are evaluated by time-dependent DFT calculations based on an optimization of the ground-state geometry of the complexes. Table S2† lists the essential parameters of several low-lying electronic states that were obtained at the PBE1PBE level of theory. The calculation results show that electronic transition that involves the HOMO → LUMO orbital pair is the dominant contributing configuration to the first singlet excited state for Pt-1, Pt-4, and Pt-5, which occurs at 389 nm for Pt-1, 388 nm for Pt-4, and 403 nm for Pt-5. Transition that involved the HOMO−1 → LUMO orbital pair is the dominant contributing configuration to the first singlet excited state for Pt-2 and Pt-3. As a result, Pt-2 and Pt-3 process transitions at 387 nm and 390 nm, respectively. According to the electron density distributions of the HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1, the lowest-energy absorption bands should originate from the 1ILCT (π(fluorene) → π*(1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene)/1MLCT (dπ(Pt) → π*(1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene)) transitions for Pt-1 and Pt-4. Interestingly, the lowest-energy absorption bands for Pt-5 should arise from 1ILCT (π(fluorene) → π*(naphthalimide)) and 1MLCT (dπ(Pt) → π*(1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene)). The first and second excited states should be attributed predominantly to 1ILCT (π(electron-donating groups) → π*(NCN)) and 1MLCT (dπ(Pt) → π*(NCN)) transitions for Pt-2 and Pt-3. The results of DFT calculations are in agreement with the assignment of UV–vis absorption spectra for the Pt(II) complexes.
AIE properties
To confirm the aggregation properties of all complexes, the emission spectra at different ratios of tetrahydrofuran (THF)–water mixtures were investigated. The steric hindrance of terminal groups could influence their AIE properties effectively. For complex Pt-2 and Pt-3 as shown in Fig. 2, the phosphorescence emission intensity of complex Pt-2 increases 3.02 times upon addition of water to the solution, which shows typical AIPE properties. When the fw was below 50%, the green emission with λmax at 532 nm was quenched gradually. When the H2O fraction exceeded 60% in the mixed solvent, the complexes aggregated and showed a new emission at ∼650 nm with an increasing intensity. When fw increased to 90%, the intensity of emission at 653 nm reached a maximum. We can infer from these results that the phenothiazine chromophores rotate dynamically against the fluorenyl-substituted N^C^N platinum core on the single bond axes in diluted THF solution, which leads to a relatively weak emission. When a small fraction of water exists (fw ≤ 50%), intramolecular charge-transfer activity dominates the emission intensity and quenches the green light emission. When a large amount of water is added (fw ≥ 60%), the emission peak appears at ∼650 nm because the molecules tend to aggregate and form nanoparticles by intermolecular interactions, which restricts the radiationless relaxation channel, opens the radiative decay pathway, and increases the emission intensity. A similar AIPE behaviour for Pt-3 was observed because of the tert-butyl carbazole groups with a large steric hindrance. Pt-4 with a benzothiazole group exhibits an inconspicuous AIPE because of a small steric effect compared with Pt-2 and Pt-3 (Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 2e describes the possible mechanism for the bathochromic emission of these Pt(II) complexes, when molecular aggregation occurs, the intramolecular interactions and amorphous state formation in the aggregation state lower the energy level of first triplet excited state, which cause the red-shift emission.46 The emission spectra of Pt-1 and Pt-5 in water/THF mixtures with different water contents (0%–90%) were also obtained (Fig. S6, ESI†). Pt-1 and Pt-5 are highly emissive when dissolved in the solvent, but the emission intensity decreases sharply with an increase in water fraction because of the ACQ effect. No obvious restricted intramolecular rotation occurs in Pt-1 without terminal substituents could be the reason for the ACQ.47 A careful analysis of the structures of Pt-2–Pt-4 reveals the importance of aromatic rotors, which do not exist in Pt-1. The excited intramolecular motions in Pt-2 and Pt-3 may be considered to be the possible reasons for AIPE. However, the reason for Pt-1 and Pt-5 having ACQ properties could differ. The emission state of Pt-5 is assigned to 1ILCT mixing with 1MLCT to cause a low quantum yield, which could be responsible for the ACQ.

Piezochromic and vapochromic properties
The emission spectra of pristine samples in the solid state were obtained and shown in Fig. 3a. Phosphorescence colours of these complexes in the as-prepared samples were observed from yellow to red under UV light irradiation as shown in the CIE chromaticity coordinate (Pt-1 (0.41, 0.57), Pt-2 (0.46, 0.53), Pt-3 (0.42, 0.56), Pt-4 (0.49, 0.50), and Pt-5 (0.60, 0.40), Fig. 3b). Emission spectra of Pt-1, Pt-2, and Pt-3 displayed a similar pattern to those in solution with intense and sharp bands in the range of 520–550 nm, which suggests that the emission state in the solid state originates from the ligand-localized 3π,π* state. Meanwhile, with the enhancement of charge transfer, complexes bearing an electron-withdrawing substituent (benzothiazole or naphthalimide) exhibit a significant bathochromic-shift. In addition, the luminescence of Pt-4 showed structured bands at 609 nm with different patterns from that in solution, which were assigned to the mixture of 3MLCT/3π,π* states. The emission band of Pt-5 localized at 649 nm is broad and structureless, which is similar to that in solution (Fig. 1b) and could also be assigned to the 3MLCT excited state.

As is known, the twisted conformations of the molecules may generate their mechanofluorochromic properties.48,49 Therefore, we scratched all complexes with a metal spatula. Pristine and ground samples of Pt-2 exhibited luminescent mechanochromic behaviour in response to external stimuli (Fig. 4a and Table 1). When the samples were ground or scratched, their emission colour turned to red from yellow. Mechanical grinding resulted in a decrease at 541 nm and an increase at 639 nm in peak intensities of the emission bands, respectively (Fig. 4a), namely the emission maximum red-shifted by ∼118 nm. The emission colour of the ground sample was reversed to yellow when fumed under a CH2Cl2 atmosphere for ∼120 min, which indicates that the complex can be endowed with piezochromic and vapochromic properties. The grinding-fuming processes can be performed reversibly more than four times (Fig. 4b). Similarly, the emission spectra of complexes in the solid state, except Pt-5, exhibit major changes before and after grinding (Fig. S7–S10, ESI†). Comparing to Pt-1–Pt-5, the as-prepared Pt-4 and Pt-5 with electron-withdrawing groups were unique. When the original Pt-4 was ground in a mortar, the emission peak at 549 nm decreased and no new peak appeared. The maximum fluorescent emission wavelength of Pt-5 changed from the original 641 nm to 643 nm after grinding. Therefore, the mechanofluorochromic properties of the Pt(N^C^N)-cored fluorenyl-substituted derivatives could be fine-tuned by altering their electron-donating terminal groups to electron-withdrawing terminal groups.

The inset images show the reversible grinding–fuming photographs of Pt-2 based on piezochromic and vapochromic properties obtained under UV light at 365 nm; (c) changes in PXRD patterns upon mechanical grinding and solvent treatment for Pt-2; and (d) DSC curves of Pt-2 in original, ground, and annealed states. 
Although a few Pt complexes have been reported to show switchable luminescence under external stimuli, molecules that show such a colour-tuned luminescence are rarely reported. The detailed mechanism of piezochromic luminescence modulation of the reported molecules remains unclear and is likely to vary from case to case. In this work, grinding shows a relatively large effect on the characteristics of the emission bands of these complexes which exhibit piezochromic and vapochromic properties. Take Pt-2 for example, it possesses a sharp and structured phosphorescence spectrum originating from the ligand-centered 3π,π* state (ΦPL = 0.18) in the pristine state, and a broad and featureless phosphorescence spectrum originating from the 3MLCT state (ΦPL = 0.12) after grinding. However, for Pt-5, the solid state ΦPL are relatively low in both pristine and ground samples, and its phosphorescence from the 3MLCT state exhibits broad and featureless characteristics. In addition, all samples remained yellow after grinding, indicating that the mechanical force does not affect their energy gaps between the ground state and the singlet excited state significantly.
These observations appear to suggest that the unique piezochromic luminescence behaviors of Pt complexes Pt-1–Pt-4 can be assigned to the switch of the excited state before and after the mechanical stimuli. This behavior decreases the HOMO–LUMO gap significantly and the consequent absorption and emission energy, which results in an excited state conversion from a 3π,π*/3MLCT state to a predominantly 3MLCT state. Moreover, terminal substituents influenced the triplet excited state obviously, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing group could switch the 3π,π* state to a 3MLCT state. Pt-4 shows structured bands at 609 nm, which can be assigned to a mixture of 3MLCT/3π,π* states, while the emission band of Pt-5 localized at 649 nm is broad and structureless, which is assigned to the 3MLCT excited state. The grinding behavior exhibits no effect on the conversion of excited states of Pt-5. As a result, Pt-5 exhibits no piezochromic and vapochromic properties.
It has also been proposed that the mechanofluorochromic phenomenon usually occurs with the destruction of an ordered structure by external mechanical forces.50–54 Thus, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) combined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies was used to study the aggregation state changes of these mechanofluorochromic compounds. PXRD measurements were performed to understand the microstructure of the pristine powders in the original, ground, and fumed states. As shown in Fig. 4c, sharp scattering peaks were observed for the Pt-2 original samples, which indicate an ordered crystalline structure. After the as-prepared sample had been ground by external mechanical forces, a trend from crystalline structure to amorphous state occurred with the original sharp peak attenuation or even disappearance. When the as-prepared ground samples were fumed, the annealed samples led to a recovery of the crystalline structure, which was accompanied by the appearance of sharp peaks that coincided with the original samples. The above PXRD results indicate that the reversible transition between the ordered and disordered molecular aggregations is critical for the mechanofluorochromic behaviours. Reproducible heating DSC results showed that the ground state of Pt-2 exhibited an exothermic peak, which represented a reproducible cold-crystallization transition at 319 °C. However, no exothermic peak appeared near this temperature for the original and fumed states (Fig. 4d). Therefore, the aggregation structure in the ground sample is a metastable state, which could transform into a more stable packing structure through fuming. The morphological change of the compound that was induced by grinding, and fuming was reversible. All complexes exhibited a reversible conversion to the amorphous phase by mechanical grinding, and to the crystalline phase by treatment with a solvent (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†).
X-ray structure determination
Single-crystal analysis is a helpful tool to investigate the relationship between molecular packing and luminescence properties. To obtain a clear understanding of the structure–property relationships for these Pt(II) complexes, much effort has been devoted to grow single crystals from different solvents. Finally, single crystal of Pt-2 was obtained by slow evaporation from the mixture solvent of n-hexane–dichloromethane (3:1). The single crystal Pt-2 (CCDC number: 1558700†) was block-shaped and crystallized in the triclinic space group P (2), containing two independent molecules in the unit cell. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Pt(II) center adopted a square-planar coordination geometry and the dihedral angles between Pt-N^C^N and the directly connected fluorene ring were 43.6° for Pt-2, which is consistent with the optimal configuration of DFT. The bowl-shaped N-substituted phenothiazine rings were almost vertically twisted from the fluorene group, which implies that a highly twisted conformation exists in the single crystal of the complex. Fig. 5b shows the molecular packing structure in the single crystal. In the packing structure, Pt(II) complex is arranged in an antiparallel fashion, through weak π–π interactions between the N^C^N ligands (3.47 Å). The antiparallel packing pattern favours the formation of a long Pt⋯Pt distance (3.81 Å), thus Pt–Pt interaction is present but very weak. The complex adopts a stacking mode via intermolecular C–H⋯Cl and C–H⋯Pt interactions. The increased steric hindrance by long chains provides a relatively loose packing in the crystal that could be easily amorphized under a mechanical stimulus and exhibit piezochromic luminescence. Unfortunately, the single crystals of other complexes are too small and are unsuitable for X-ray structural analysis.

Application for data security protection
Based on the remarkable luminescence response of piezochromic and vapochromic stimulus, we expanded its potential utility in anti-counterfeiting. Counterfeiting is a growing global problem that impacts all levels of modern society.55–59 A variety of anti-counterfeiting and encryption technologies have been developed to combat counterfeiting, and phosphorescent security inks are most widely used in our daily life.60–63 The dispersion of Pt-2 in THF/H2O was loaded into rubber stamps that were carved with characters “N” and “J”. To demonstrate the performance of this ink as an anti-counterfeiting tool, English characters “N” and “J” were stamped on a banknote (Fig. 6). After drying under ambient conditions, the two characters were nearly invisible in daylight. Upon irradiation with a 365 nm UV lamp, bright red characters were visible, which are opposite to the existing anti-counterfeiting mark on the banknote itself (that is, the yellow number “100”). However, when the characters were exposed to a dichloromethane atmosphere, yellow instead of red characters were observed, but the yellow number “100” (anti-counterfeiting mark of the banknote itself) remained unchanged. These observations show that Pt-2 in the THF/H2O dispersion could be used as an advanced anti-counterfeiting ink.

Conclusions
We have synthesized and characterized five new Pt(II) chloride complexes (Pt-1–Pt-5) that contain different terminal substituents on 1,3-di(2-pyridyl)benzene ligands. Complexes Pt-2 and Pt-3 show obvious AIPE in solvent system. Yellow to red emissions were exhibited in the solid state for Pt-1–Pt-5. Complexes, except Pt-5, showed piezochromic and vapochromic behaviours. The emission colours could be reversed from yellow to red with grinding and CH2Cl2 fuming, as shown by PXRD spectroscopy and DSC. Based on in-depth experimental and computational studies, we believe that the different molecular conformations in the two distinctive solid phases causes substantial switching of the 3MLCT emission process, which can be correlated with the subsequent phosphorescence from the 3MLCT/3π,π* emission state. The Pt-1–Pt-5 molecular system presents a rare example of phosphorescence tuning that is driven by a switching of the excited state in the solid state under mechanical stimuli, and thus provides a novel mechanism of the piezochromic behavior. In addition, complex Pt-2 is used as an emission ink in advanced anti-counterfeiting and provides a strategy to design smart luminescent materials. Further studies will focus on the development of more efficient metal–organic mechanochromic materials following this precise design strategy and the applications of metal–organic mechanochromic materials in optical recording and pressure sensing. Moreover, the comparison of the difference between these complexes would help inform future experiments, and help make a potential connection with the AIPE experiments.
