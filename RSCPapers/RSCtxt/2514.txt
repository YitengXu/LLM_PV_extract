    , Accepted 1st May 2013First published on 1st May 2013AbstractWe report on a new series of Ru(II) sensitizers, TFRS-61–66, suited for high performance dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The molecular design incorporates novel dianionic bipyrazolate or bitriazolate ancillaries to replace the dual thiocyanates in N3 (or N719) with the aim of improving device stability. These newly designed dianionic biazolate ligands make feasible the fine-tuning of the ground state oxidation potential. This, together with the synergistic incorporation of electron-donating thiophene or thiophene-containing appendages to one bipyridine for improved light-harvesting, leads to the achievement of DSCs with a prominent JSC of 17.4 mA cm−2 and hence a high photon conversion efficiency of 9.6% using TFRS-63, which is comparable with the N3 control device (9.5% in this study) but with notably superior device stability. Comprehensive electrochemical impedance, charge extraction, transient photovoltage and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements were carried out to gain insights into the fundamentals of these new dyes and the associated device properties. These biazolate substituted Ru(II) sensitizers add another dimension in the search to replace thiocyanate ligands in Ru(II) sensitizers showing high performance in DSC devices.
Introduction
During the past two decades, metal-based photosensitizers have been considered as vital components of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1–4 In DSCs, a suitable sensitizer/dye is first deposited on a metal oxide thin film such as TiO2. Upon irradiation with sunlight, charge separation occurs at the TiO2/dye interface and the photo-injected electrons are then diffused through the interconnected mesoporous particles and extracted at the anode, while the oxidized sensitizer is rapidly regenerated by the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte solution. The oxidized I3− diffuses to the cathode and is reduced back to I− to complete the regenerative process. Nazeeruddin, Grätzel, and co-workers had reported the seminal work on the Ru(II) based sensitizers,5 namely: N3 with the formula cis-Ru(dcbpyH2)2(NCS)2 (dcbpyH2 = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridyl) and its di-t-butyl ammonium (TBA) substituted derivatives N719 (Scheme 1). Meanwhile, the best conversion efficiency of 11.1% was successfully achieved with the employment of N719 upon addition of one equiv. of TBA chenodeoxycholate salt (TBA-CDOC) as a co-adsorbent in dye solution.6 Thereafter, Wang and co-workers7 and Wu and co-workers8 reported the ingenious modification of N719 by the incorporation of electron-rich thiophene or functionalized bithiophene appendages into its structure. Subsequently this strategy was extensively applied to modify Ru(II) based sensitizers with the goal of further improving the overall conversion efficiencies.9–16 Two such sensitizers, C106 and CYC-B11, emerged showing large extinction coefficients of up to 1.8 and 2.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at their lowest energy MLCT band.8,17,18 DSCs fabricated with these sensitizers exhibited outstanding photovoltaic performances with power conversion efficiencies of over 11.5%. With regard to device stability, upon application of light soaking at one sun and under excessive thermal stress, it has been suggested that transition metal sensitizers with all multi-dentate chelates can attain better stability and longer device lifespan in comparison with those possessing the mono-dentate thiocyanate ligands.19 This has led to numerous studies on the so-called thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizers recently.20–27
 Scheme 1  Structures of Ru(II) sensitizers N719, C106 and CYC-B11. 
Another criterion for designing a highly efficient sensitizer is to shift the ground state oxidation potential (Eox°) at least 0.3 V more positive than a redox potential of I3−/I− in electrolyte (0.35 V vs. NHE) and, preferably, even more positive than that of the redox potential for the I2˙−/I− couple (ca. 0.79 ± 0.1 V vs. NHE),28–30 for which I2˙− is the unstable intermediate during the two-electron oxidation involving I3−/I−. This is to ensure effective regeneration of the oxidized sensitizers. To fulfil these requirements, ingenious design of strong electron-withdrawing ligands (or chelates) is necessary to reduce the electron density at the central Ru(II) metal. Herein, we report a new and promising class of dianionic chelates, which can effectively substitute the dual thiocyanates in N3 and N719. These chelates are termed biazolates (cf. bipyrazolate or bitriazolate), for which their structural design is markedly different from the 2-pyridyl azolate anions that were widely employed in preparation of transition metal complexes (Scheme 2).31 Moreover, the attached electron withdrawing CF3 groups are expected to increase the oxidation potential of Ru(II) sensitizers for satisfying the required electrochemical properties. Conjugated thiophene appendages were also introduced at the ligand periphery to increase dye absorptivity, such that thinner TiO2 mesoporous films (≤15 μm) can be employed for boosting the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of fabricated DSCs. We now report here the synthesis of this new class of sensitizers and associated characteristics of the DSC devices.

Results and discussion
For synthesizing the proposed Ru(II) sensitizers TFRS-61–66, the potentially dianionic chelate, 5,5′-di(trifluoromethyl)-3,3′-bipyrazole (dtpzH2), was first prepared from Claisen condensation employing ethyl trifluoroacetate and 2,3-butanedione, followed by hydrazine cyclization, while the other dianionic chelate, 5,5′-di(trifluoromethyl)-3,3′-bi-(1,2,4-triazole) (dttzH2), was obtained from coupling of oxalyl dihydrazide and trifluoroacetamidine, followed by thermal dehydration and vacuum sublimation. As shown in Scheme 3, our protocols are taken from those reported for alkyl and aryl substituted 3,3′-bipyrazole as well as 3,3′-bi-(1,2,4-triazole),32–34 and then modified according to the commercial availability of fluorinated starting materials, for which the exact procedures can be found in the ESI.†

The Ru(II) sensitizers were then obtained by ligand substitution between dtpzH2 (or dttzH2) and Ru(II) chloride complexes [Ru(ecbpy)(N⁁N)Cl2] in the presence of an acid scavenger such as NaOAc, N⁁N = ecbpy, htbpy and hSbpy, of which all chloride precursors are in situ synthesized using standard protocols reported in the literature.7,17 The ethoxycarbonyl derivatives were then purified using silica gel column chromatography. Subsequently, the ethoxycarbonyl groups were hydrolyzed in a basic mixture of acetone and water, and the Ru(II) sensitizers were precipitated out of the solution by adjusting the pH to 3, followed by drying under vacuum and stored. The typical yield runs from 34 to 41%, calculated using RuCl3·nH2O as the limiting reagent. Their purities were verified by routine mass, 1H and 19F NMR and elemental analyses (see ESI†). Their structural drawings are depicted in Scheme 4.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the studied sensitizers, TFRS-61–66 in DMF are depicted in Fig. 1, together with the reference spectrum of N3. The combined photophysical data are listed in Table 1. For the convenience of spectral discussion, three spectral pairs, TFRS-61, 64, TFR-62, 65 and TFR-63, 66 are depicted in Fig. 2a and b as well as in Fig. S1 of ESI,† respectively. The configurations of bipyridine chelates in each pair are the same except for the substitution of bipyrazolate (dtpz2−) with the bitriazolate (dttz2−) moiety. Fig. 2 also includes the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculated absorption wavelengths (vertical line) and the relative transition probability (magnitude of the vertical line). Also depicted are the frontier orbitals contributing to the major transition for each complex. For these TFRS sensitizers, TFRS-61 exhibits a slightly red-shifted MLCT absorption band at 547 nm versus that of N3 at 538 nm. In contrast, TFRS-64 shows the most blue-shifted MLCT absorption at 517 nm. For each spectral pair, the complex with the bipyrazolate moiety is evidently red shifted with respect to its congener with the bitriazolate moiety. This trend can be rationalized by the computational approach, in which the frontier orbital analyses indicate that the HOMO (and the HOMO-1) resides at metal dπ and bipyrazolate (or bitriazolate) π orbitals. Thus, the more electron deficient triazolate moiety further decreases the corresponding HOMO level (cf. the pyrazolate moiety), resulting in an increase of the HOMO/LUMO energy gap. Further experimental support of this viewpoint will be given in the section discussing electrochemistry. Moreover, after introducing the thiophene appendage to one bipyridine (TFRS-62 and 65), shown in Fig. 1, the lower lying absorptions reveal a significant hyperchromic effect and bathochromic shift; i.e. they are effectively increased in absorptivity and extended to red with the absorption extinction coefficient of at least 1.7 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 and an offset of 25–35 nm at the lowest lying peak wavelength (cf.TFRS-61 and 64). In comparison to TFRS-61 and 64, the lowering of the energy gap in TFRS-62 and 65, according to the frontier orbital analyses, is mainly due to a minor but non-negligible contribution of the thiophene π orbital to the HOMO (or the LUMO) to increase (decrease) the π (π*) energy level. The extension of π-electron delocalization as well increases the transition moment and thus the absorption extinction coefficient. Additional insertion of the hexylthiolate side chain to the thiophene appendage (TFRS-63 and 66) is capable of providing further delocalization and hence higher absorptivity, which is consistent with that reported by Wang et al.17

Inset: the frontier orbitals contributing to the major transitions for each complex. 
To check whether these sensitizers are sufficiently reducing in their excited state to allow for electron injection into TiO2 and oxidizing in their ground state to allow for regeneration by the I3−/I− redox couple, we then proceeded to measure the electrochemical potentials (Eox°) in DMF; the respective oxidation potential at the excited state (E°*) was deduced according to the equation E°* = Eox° − E0–0, for which E0–0 is defined as the optical gap of the sensitizer. According to Table 1, the obtained Eox° for each complex with the bitriazolate moiety is more positive, i.e. higher in oxidation potential, than its congener with the bipyrazolate moiety (e.g.TFRS-64 > TER-61, TFRS-65 > TER-62 and TFRS-66 > TER-63). Also, Eox° for all dyes in the TFRS series is more positive than that of the proposed I3−/I− redox potential, ca. 0.35 V (vs. NHE)35 as well as the I2˙−/I− couple, ca. 0.79 ± 0.1 V (vs. NHE). On the other hand, the excited state oxidation potentials (Table 1), estimated from the difference between Eox° and the onset of the optical energy gap E0–0, are also considered to be sufficiently more negative than that of the conduction band edge of the TiO2 electrode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE) by >0.25 V, confirming their ability to serve as efficient sensitizers for I3−/I− based DSCs.
These sensitizers were next utilized to fabricate DSC devices, in which the TiO2 mesoporous anode consists of a 10 μm (20 nm) absorbing layer and a 5 μm (400 nm) light scattering layer, deposited using the screen-printing technique. The sensitizers were dissolved in 20% (v/v) DMSO in EtOH, for which 2 eq. tetra-butyl ammonium deoxycholate salt, [TBA][DOC], was deliberately added for initiating possible H+/TBA+ metathesis to improve the solubility of the sensitizers. The electrolyte solution (Z960) consists of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), and 0.05 M LiI in a mixed acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v 85:15).7,17,36 The solar simulator was calibrated with a certified Si solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. The respective device parameters are listed in Table 2, while the I–V characteristics and the IPCE action diagrams are illustrated in Fig. 3.

The N3 reference cell shows an overall efficiency (η) of 9.5%, JSC of 17.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.74 V and FF of 0.745; these results are comparable to the optimized device data reported in the literature.37,38 Under the same conditions, devices containing the structurally related TFRS-61 and TFRS-64 exhibit inferior performances of η = 8.6% and η = 7.4%, respectively. This could be attributed to a combination of several factors, including (i) their reduced absorption extinction coefficients in the UV/Vis and/or (ii) their reduced dye loading on TiO2 nanoparticles. The latter is also consistent with the expanded spatial demand for the biazolate chelate versus that of thiocyanate ligands. Without doubt, both of these factors are expected to reduce the light-harvesting capability and, hence, to give a lowered JSC for DSC devices containing these dyes. Moreover, TFRS-64 possesses two relatively strong electron-withdrawing triazolate fragments, which is expected to further reduce the electron density at the central Ru(II) atom, causing a significant blue-shift of the MLCT band position by ∼30 nm versusTFRS-61 and ∼21 nm versus N3, and hence an even smaller JSC due to the concomitant reduction of the solar absorption.
Sensitizer structure was modified to further boost DSC efficiency. Our approach is analogous to examples in the literature in which one carboxyl substituted bipyridine is replaced with a bipyridine tethered with highly conjugated and electron-donating thiophene or functionalized thiophene units.39–47 The increase in conjugation is expected to shift the MLCT absorption toward longer wavelengths and increase the extinction coefficient simultaneously. As shown in both Fig. 1 and Table 1, this is indeed the case, with TFRS-63 exhibiting the most optimized photophysical behavior with an MLCT band centered at 581 nm with ε = 1.9 × 10−4 L mol−1cm−1. The TFRS-63 device exhibits a JSC of 17.4 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.74 V, and FF of 0.749, corresponding to a η of 9.6% and represents the highest efficiency obtained among the dyes measured in this study. The closely analogous bipyrazolate TFRS-62 also showed a comparable performance of JSC = 17.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.72 V, FF of 0.722, and η = 8.8%, despite its MLCT peak maximum being slightly blue-shifted to 571 nm. The corresponding bitriazolate derivatives TFRS-65 and 66 exhibited inferior overall efficiencies of η = 7.5 and 7.8% respectively, which is mainly attributed to their poor spectral overlap, as the onset of IPCE only starts at 750 nm for TFRS-64–66, being relatively blue shifted compared to that of more efficient bipyrazolate sensitizers TFRS-61–63 (810 nm). Finally, the current densities obtained by integration of IPCE curves (380–850 nm) are also shown in Table 2. It is notable that all data showed less than 3% deviation confirming the accuracy for all DSC measurements, for which a KG5-Si reference cell is employed to calibrate our solar simulator to minimize the spectra mismatch.48,49
Furthermore, electron density and electron lifetime in these devices were probed using charge extraction and transient photovoltage measurements. Fig. 4 shows relevant data for N3 and TFRS-61–66 devices. DSC devices show negligible differences in charge densities (Fig. 4(a)) indicating that the conduction band potential is similar in all cells. Transient photovoltage measurements show no obvious trend between sensitizer structure and electron lifetime for the TFRS-61–66 devices; however, this may be due to the small difference in lifetime between this series of dyes and N3, versus that of other thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizers (TF-11–14) we have studied.50 Indeed, the small difference in lifetime is reflected in the small differences in VOC for devices measured in this study, though a correlation between the device with the fastest recombination and lowest VOC (TFRS-64; 0.71 V) and the devices with the slowest recombination and largest VOC (N3, TFRS-63 and TFRS-65; 0.74 V) is evident. These data underscore that these TFRS dyes are capable of showing VOC and electron lifetimes similar to thiocyanate-containing dyes such as N3 despite the inherently increased conjugated nature of these sensitizers.
 Fig. 4  (a) TiO2 electron density versus voltage deduced from charge extraction measurements and (b) electron lifetime τ versus TiO2 electron density deduced from transient photovoltage measurements for DSC devices containing N3 and TFRS-61–66 sensitizers. The cell voltage is induced via illumination from a series of LEDs. 
To complement the transient photovoltage measurements, electrochemical impedance measurements were also conducted to investigate electron lifetimes in these devices. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots measured under dark conditions at a forward bias of 0.7 V. Two semicircles from left to right in the Nyquist plot are visible and represent the impedances of the charge transfer (RPt) on the Pt counter electrode (smaller circles) and the charge recombination (Rr) at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (larger circles). The radii of the second series of semicircles indicate Rr to be in the order of TFRS-63 > N3 > TFRS-65 > TFRS-61 > TFRS-66 > TFRS-62 > TFRS-64. A smaller Rr value in theory means faster charge recombination between electrons in TiO2 and electron acceptors in an electrolyte and thus shorter TiO2 electron lifetimes. Therefore the trends observed for electron lifetimes extracted from both transient photovoltage and electrochemical impedance measurements are mutually consistent.

Transient absorption spectroscopy was then used to probe regeneration in transparent DSC devices by the I3−/I− redox couple. Fig. 6 shows the transient kinetics recorded for N3 and TFRS-63 devices under 1 sun illumination. The kinetics were recorded at 800 nm (main panel) and are typical for the N3 device with a long-lived signal (t50%–35 μs) recorded in the absence of the redox couple (black decay) assigned to the cation of N3. In the presence of the redox couple the kinetics become bi-phasic with the loss of the N3 cation signal due to regeneration by I− and the appearance of a long-lived signal assigned to TiO2 injected electrons and/or I2˙− (red decay).51 The TFRS-63 device also shows a long-lived signal (t50%–445 μs) in the absence of the redox couple. In the presence of the redox couple this decay becomes faster due to regeneration by I−. However the slope of the decay is not as steep as in the case of N3.
 Fig. 6  Transient absorption kinetics of (a) N3 and (b) TFRS-63 transparent TiO2 DSC devices in the presence (red) and absence (black) of the I3−/I− red/ox couple. In the main panel kinetics were recorded at 800 nm and in the insets at 550 nm. In all cases kinetics were recorded following excitation at 500 nm and under 1 sun illumination intensity. 
To have a clearer estimation of regeneration in these devices it is more instructive to monitor the kinetics at the bleach of the ground state absorption. In this way there is no overlapping signal from TiO2 injected electrons. The insets in Fig. 6 show the ground state bleach recovery at 550 nm in the presence and absence of the I3−/I− redox couple. The t50% measured for N3 and TFRS-63 devices in the presence of I3−/I− are 2 and 28 μs respectively. The ten-fold difference in t50% can be explained due to the 0.25 V difference in driving force for regeneration for these sensitizers, i.e. due to the different ground state oxidation potentials (Eox°) for these dyes (1.10 and 0.85 V vs. NHE for N3 and TFRS-63, respectively). Such a dependence of regeneration on driving force has been reported before.52 It should be noted that the slower regeneration in the TFRS-63 device might explain why its JSC is not significantly higher than that of the N3 device despite the much greater light-harvesting ability of the TFRS-63 sensitizer. The same may also be true for TFRS-62.
Transient absorption measurements for devices made with the rest of the dyes in this study also show the dependence of regeneration on driving force (see ESI† for more kinetic data). Table 3 shows ground state oxidation potentials (Eox°) and recombination decay half-times (t50%) at the dye ground state bleach at 550 nm recorded in the presence of the I3−/I− redox electrolyte. We note that the regeneration dynamics of TFRS-64–66 devices are comparable to those for the N3 device, especially for the kinetics recorded at 800 nm which are clearly distinguishable as bi-phasic in nature. Evidently, this is the first time we have observed such dynamics for thiocyanate-free Ru(II) complexes and this case is due to the increase in regeneration driving force afforded by the bitriazolate chelates in these sensitizers.

TFRS-63 and N3 were then subjected to the standard one-sun light soaking test at 60 °C to probe device stability behaviour. These devices were fabricated using an alternative electrolyte with a composition of 1.0 M DMII, 0.15 M I2, 0.1 M GuNCS, and 0.5 M NBB (N-butyl-1H-benzimidazole) in butyronitrile (BN).53 As can be seen, TFRS-63 and N3 display a significant difference in JSC during the first 200 h, together with a slight decline of VOC during the whole period of time eventually giving a decline of efficiency, which is defined as (ηmax − η1000h)/ηmax, in the range 5.2% and 12.8% for TFRS-63 and N3 respectively. The initial increase of JSC for TFRS-63 during light soaking has also been observed for C101 and Z907 by O'Regan et al.,54 who attributed this to the downward shift of conduction band edge (CBE) of TiO2 and hence the improved electron injection. Apparently, JSC for TFRS-63 remains nearly unchanged after a period of 1000 h (see Fig. 7), which demonstrates the suitable stability of this sensitizer. As for the N3 reference cell, in sharp contrast, it showed a steady and notable degradation of JSC (5%) during the whole tested period, confirming the robustness of our bis-pyrazolate sensitizer TFRS-63, which is attributed to its hydrophobic nature and absense of thiocyanate ligands.

Conclusions
In summary, this study reports a new and alternative design of highly efficient Ru(II) sensitizers employing the hereto novel biazolate (both bipyrazolate dtpz2− and bitriazolate dttz2−) ancillaries. Upon employment of the dtpz2− chelate, despite the weaker electron withdrawing nature, it still affords an adequate ground state oxidation potential for dye regeneration using typical I3−/I− based electrolyte. Together with the adoption of electron donating thiophene or thiophene-containing appendages, we are capable of fabricating solar cells with efficiency as high as 9.6%, in comparison to 9.5% for the N3 device under identical conditions. The underlying advantage of this current design is in providing a series of Ru(II) sensitizers with positive enough ground state oxidation potential (0.83–0.94 V) for rapid regeneration, sensitive optical responses in the UV/Vis spectra, and coupled with the removal of unnecessary isocyanate ancillaries in its structure, to achieve better long-term device stability with high solar energy conversion efficiency.
Finally, as opposed to the monoanionic chelates such as phenylpyridinato and pyridyl azolate chelate, which are ubiquitously exploited in the field of DSC, the biazolates employed in the present study are a class of dianionic-bidentate chelates, whose chemistry and material applications are rather under-explored. With the prototype successfully demonstrated above, these biazolate chelates are worth extensive exploration, particularly in construction of Ru(II) sensitizers suitable for high performance DSCs.
Experimental
General procedures
All reactions were performed under nitrogen. Solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification, while 4,4′-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (ecbpy),55 4,4′-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine (htbpy) and 4,4′-bis(5-(hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine (hSbpy) were synthesized according to the procedures depicted in the literature.17 All reactions were monitored by TLC with pre-coated silica gel plates (Merck, 0.20 mm with fluorescent indicator UV254). Compounds were visualized with UV irradiation at 254 or 365 nm. Flash column chromatography was carried out using silica gel obtained from Merck (230–400 mesh). Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL SX-102A instrument operating in electron impact (EI) or fast atom bombardment (FAB) mode. 1H, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-400 or INOVA-500 instrument; chemical shifts are quoted with respect to the internal standard tetramethylsilane. Elemental analysis was carried out with a Heraeus CHN-O Rapid Elementary Analyzer. Photophysical data were obtained using an Edinburgh Fluorescence and Phosphorescence spectrometer FLS928P.
Synthesis of TFRS-61–66
The synthesis of TFRS-61–66 and all precursors and intermediates are detailed in the ESI.†
TD-DFT calculation
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program. Their ground state structures were first optimized with density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/LANL2DZ (Ru) and 6-31G* (H, C, N, O, S, F) level. The optimized structures were then used to calculate 60 lowest singlet energy optical excitations using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method. Their lowest ground triplet state energies were also calculated. A polarizable continuum model (PCM) in Gaussian 09 was applied using dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent.
Device fabrication
The FTO glass used as a current collector (4.0 mm thickness, sheet resistance of 10 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass) was first cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. After treatment in a UV–O3 system for 15 min (PSD series UV–ozone cleaning, Novascan Technologies, Inc.), the FTO glass plates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 75 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The photoanodes composed of nanocrystalline TiO2 were prepared using literature procedures. The transparent TiO2 electrodes (5 × 5 mm2) of 10 μm thickness were screen-printed on FTO glasses, followed by a 5 μm scattering layer containing 400 nm TiO2 particles (PST-400, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals, Japan). The TiO2 electrodes were heated under oxygen flow at 325 °C for 5 min, followed by heating at 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 1 h. The TiO2 electrodes were retreated with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 75 °C for 30 min. The electrodes were sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min and left to cool down to 80 °C before dipping them into dye solution for 18 h at room temperature. The dye solution (0.3 mM) was prepared in absolute ethanol with 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with addition of 2 equiv. of tetrabutylammonium deoxycholate [TBA][DOC] as an additive. Platinized counter electrodes were prepared by dripping down 10 μL of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropyl alcohol) on FTO plates, followed by pyrolysis at 400 °C for 10 min. The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were assembled with counter electrodes by inserting a hot-melt Surlyn film (Meltonix 1170-25, 25 μm, Solaronix) as spacer. The electrolyte consists of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.03 M of iodine, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) and 0.05 M of LiI in the mixed valeronitrile–acetonitrile solution (volume ratio of 15:85), which was then injected into the cell. Finally, the hole was sealed using another Surlyn film and a cover glass. In order to reduce light piping from the cross sections of glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer, all devices were covered with a large mask made of non-reflective black metal with a window area of 4 × 4 mm2.
For transient absorption spectroscopy measurements, sealed devices consisted of working electrodes of transparent 1 cm2 films of 8 μm mesoporous TiO2 (Dyesol DSL 18 NR-T). Kinetics recorded in the absence of the red/ox couple were recorded in an electrolyte containing 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in valeronitrile–acetonitrile solution (15:85). Kinetics recorded in the presence of the red/ox couple were recorded in an electrolyte identical to that used for optimized 0.16 cm2 devices except 1.0 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) was used instead of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII).
Photovoltaic characterization
Photovoltaic measurements were tested under a Newport Oriel Class A Solar Simulator (Model 91159) equipped with a 150 W xenon light source. The output power density was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 using a certified KG-5 Si reference cell with a circular aperture of 8 mm diameter. The current–voltage characteristic of each cell was obtained with adopting 4-wire sense mode, delay time set as 100 ms and bias scan from short-circuit to open-circuit using a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2400). The spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were calculated with the equation of 1240 JSC(λ)/(λ Pin(λ)) where JSC is the short-circuit current density under each monochromatic illumination in unit of A cm−2, λ is the wavelength of incident monochromatic light in unit of nanometer, and Pin is the monochromatic light intensity in unit of W cm−2 and were plotted as a function of incident wavelength with an increment of 10 nm. The current was pre-amplified using a current amplifier (SR570) and measured using a Keithley 2400. It should be noted that 10 values of JSC, which (interval 50 ms) were collected sequentially after a device was illuminated monochromatically 3 seconds later and were averaged for calculation of IPCE. A 300 W Xe lamp (Model 6258, Newport Oriel) combined with an Oriel cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator (Model 74100) provided a device under test with a monochromatic beam (dc mode). The beam power intensity was calibrated with a power meter (Model 1936-C, Newport) equipped with a Newport 818-UV photodetector.
Electrical impedance measurements
Electrical impedance experiments were carried out with a PARSTAT 2273 (AMETEK Princeton Applied Research, USA) electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range of 0.1 to 106 Hz and a potential modulation of 10 mV.
Charge extraction and transient photovoltage measurements
Transient photovoltage and charge extraction techniques were carried out on a system similar to that employed by O'Regan et al.56 Briefly, in charge extraction measurements pulses of white light from a series of LEDs are applied to the cell which is allowed to reach a steady state for several seconds under open circuit conditions. When the LEDs are turned off the cell is immediately short circuited and the charge is extracted allowing electron density in the cells to be calculated. By changing the LEDs intensity the electron density can be estimated as a function of cell voltage. In transient photovoltage measurements a constant background voltage is applied to the cells and again an equilibrium is reached in the cell. However a diode pulse (660 nm, 10 mW) is then applied to the sample inducing a change of approx 2 mV in the cell. The resulting photovoltage decay transients are collected and the τ values are determined by fitting the data to the equation exp(−t/τ). A programmable USB power supply changed the light bias from the LEDs, and a PCI-6251 card (National Instruments) was used for signal control and acquisition.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient Absorption Spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a system similar to that employed by Durrant and co-workers.57 A PTI nitrogen dye laser consisted of the tunable excitation wavelength. The sample was placed between the two monochromators and a 150 W tungsten lamp was used as a light probe. An Acostronics© Silicon detector connected to a Tektronic oscilloscope TDS 2022 and to an electronic filter box is used to monitor the change in absorbance after the laser pulse excitation. Kinetics were recorded under 1 sun illumination intensity using a ring of LEDS.
Stability measurements
The photoanodes of the device employed in this study composed of a 10 μm transparent TiO2 thin film and a 5 μm thick layer of 400 nm TiO2 particles. A 370 nm cut-off long pass filter film was attached on the cell surface during illumination. The cell was irradiated under a Suntest CPS+lamp (ATLAS GmbH, 100 mW cm−2) during visible-light soaking at 60 °C. The electrolyte consists of 1.0 M DMII, 0.15 M iodine, 0.1 M GuNCS, 0.05 M NaI, and 0.5 M NBB (N-butyl-1H-benzimidazole) in butyronitrile (BN).

 	Fig. 4  (a) TiO2 electron density versus voltage deduced from charge extraction measurements and (b) electron lifetime τ versus TiO2 electron density deduced from transient photovoltage measurements for DSC devices containing N3 and TFRS-61–66 sensitizers. The cell voltage is induced via illumination from a series of LEDs.	 

 	Fig. 5  Electrochemical impedance spectra of DSC devices tested under dark at a fixed forward bias of 0.7 V.	 

 	Fig. 6  Transient absorption kinetics of (a) N3 and (b) TFRS-63 transparent TiO2 DSC devices in the presence (red) and absence (black) of the I3−/I− red/ox couple. In the main panel kinetics were recorded at 800 nm and in the insets at 550 nm. In all cases kinetics were recorded following excitation at 500 nm and under 1 sun illumination intensity.
