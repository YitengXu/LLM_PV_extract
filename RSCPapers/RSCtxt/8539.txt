    , Accepted 7th July 2019First published on 8th July 2019AbstractWe have designed an A–π–D–π–A small-molecule triad consisting of a bacteriochlorin (BC) donor central core linked with two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptors via ethynyl bridges (BC-DPP-1). BC-DPP-1 has a narrow optical bandgap of 1.38 eV with highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of −4.93 eV and −3.40 eV, respectively, and it was used as an electron donor along with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor for solution-processed small-molecule organic solar cells. After optimizing the weight ratio between BC-DPP-1 and PC71BM and pyridine as a solvent additive and subsequent solvent vapor annealing using THF, an organic solar cell based on the optimized BC-DPP-1:PC71BM showed an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.48%. Since BC-DPP-1 shows a weak absorption band in the 650–750 nm wavelength region, we used a second small molecule having strong absorption in this spectral region and prepared the ternary active layer BC-DPP-1:SM:PC71BM, varying the weight ratio between the two donors and keeping the amount of PC71BM constant. The ternary active layer BC-DPP-1 (70% w/w):SM (30% w/w):PC71BM showed the best photovoltaic performance. After the optimization of the ternary active layer (i.e., the solvent additive and subsequent solvent vapor additive), the organic solar cell showed overall power conversion efficiency of 9.88%. The improved power conversion efficiency resulted from the enhancement of Jsc, Voc and FF as compared to the binary counterpart. Since BC is an analog of porphyrins and chlorophylls, these results demonstrate that benefiting from the narrow band gap of BC-DPP-1 (i.e., organic solar cells with light harvesting in the NIR region of the solar spectrum) can be a real improvement. Moreover, the low energy loss (0.48 eV) as compared to the binary counterpart (0.58 eV) also confirms the suppressed recombination in the ternary organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer (blend of electron donor and acceptor organic semiconductors) have emerged as a promising alternative for solar energy conversion into electrical energy to silicon-based solar cells.1–3 After designing new donor and acceptor materials for BHJ active layers, optimization of nanoscale morphology of active layers and interface engineering, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 14–16%4–7 have been achieved for single BHJ polymer solar cells using non-fullerene acceptors and 17% for tandem organic solar cells.8 Recently, OSCs based on a single BHJ active layer with large area of 1 cm2 also showed remarkable PCE of over 12%.9,10 As compared to conjugated polymers, small molecule (SM) organic semiconductors exhibit many benefits, such as well-defined molecular structure with low batch-to-batch variations and simpler synthetic routes and purification protocols,11–13 and PCEs of more than 11% have been reported so far,14 offering unlimited prospects for high-performance OSCs.15–17 Among the several types of SMs consisting of donor–acceptor (D–A) structure, for A–π–D–π–A type SMs which incorporate an electron donating unit as central core, two π-linkers and two electron withdrawing terminal units, outstanding photovoltaic performances have been reached when used either as electron donors or electron acceptors.18–20 The PCE of OSCs depends upon the light harvesting ability of the active layer in the longer wavelength region of the solar spectrum. In order to enhance this, strong electron donating core and strong accepting terminal were incorporated into the molecular backbone, lowering the optical bandgap via enhancing the D–A effects.4,21,22
Bacteriochlorins belong to the porphyrin family. They are considered as a reduced form of porphyrins, with all of the 18 electrons of the π-system being involved in the macrocycle aromaticity. The two reduced double bonds can be in opposing patterns (bacteriochlorins) or in two neighboring pyrrolic patterns (iso-bacteriochlorins). During, the last few decades, they have been extensively studied and developed by the group of Prof. J. S. Lindsey.23–32 In nature, the bacteriochlorin core is found in some bacteriochlorophylls which are photosynthetic pigments that occur in phototropic bacteria (e.g., purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria, etc.). One of the most interesting features of those naturally occurring pigments is their strong NIR absorption with an intense visible band at ca 760–800 nm and a blue-shift of the Soret band around 350 nm.25 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is a very versatile dye, in fact one of the most actually used, with very rich and tunable photophysical properties.33 Among remarkable properties, it is interesting to note its high fluorescence quantum yields, its chemical and thermal stability (as well as photostability) and more importantly its very smooth and easy functionalization leading to a rich variety of spectral properties.
Recently, different A–D–A or D–A–D systems based on both porphyrins and DPP units (either as small molecules or as oligomers) have been reported in the literature with, in some cases, very high PCE values.32,34–47 Indeed, after their first report, DPP-based small-molecule photovoltaic materials have been intensively studied, with, for some examples, PCEs reaching up to 8%.47,48
We have recently explored a unique molecular design approach toward tunable fluorophores based on bacteriochlorin–DPP hybrid core structures.49 Our guiding idea was to take advantage of valuable inherent properties of natural chlorophyll-related hydroporphyrins and to impart to them additional features without resorting to tedious de novo syntheses generally required to access these tetrahydroporphyrin-like molecules. Up to now and so far to our knowledge, only a few examples of bacteriochlorins designed for applications in solar cells have been reported in the literature and they were only focused on DSSCs. In 2009, Zhou and Tamiaki reported a bacteriochlorin-sensitized solar cell co-adsorbed with CDCA with short-circuit photocurrent = 18.4 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage = 0.54 V, fill factor = 0.66, and PCE = 6.6% under air mass AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination.50 More recently, some diphenylbacteriochlorins were reported by Lin et al. in DSSCs with good photovoltaic performances of 5.36% and 4.67% depending upon the number of phenyl substituents at the 5,15-positions.51
We now report the use of an A–π–D–π–A SM consisting of a bacteriochlorin central core donor unit covalently linked to two electron-withdrawing DPP units through ethynyl bridges for BHJ solar cells (Fig. 1). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are about −4.93 eV and −3.40 eV, respectively, and are suitable as donor along with PC71BM (HOMO = 6.10 eV and LUMO = 4.15 eV) as electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution-processed BHJ SM solar cells, since the LUMO and HOMO offsets between BC-DPP-1 and PC71BM are higher than the threshold value for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. After the optimization of the active layer (i.e. donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent additive and subsequent solvent vapor annealing), the OSC based on BC-DPP-1:PC71BM showed overall PCE of 7.48% with Jsc = 14.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78, FF = 64 and energy loss = 0.58 eV. As BC-DPP-1 showed weak absorption near 700 nm, in order to compensate for this, we used another SM denoted as SM1 (chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1, which has absorption peak around 710 nm and frontier energy levels (HOMO = −5.19 eV and LUMO =−3.47 eV)).52 We thus have fabricated OSCs based on the ternary active layer BC-DPP-1:SM1:PC71BM and, after optimization, we have achieved overall PCE of 9.88% with Jsc = 16.28 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.88 V and FF = 0.68 with energy loss of 0.48 eV. The increased value of Jsc may be related to the wider absorption spectra of the ternary active layer and improved exciton generation and dissociation rate, whereas the higher value of FF may be related to the more balanced charge transport. The higher value of Voc may be related to the deeper HOMO energy level of SM.

2. Results and discussion
Synthesis of triad BC-DPP-1
The BC-DPP-1 triad was readily prepared according to a multi-step procedure recently developed by one of our research groups, based on a key step copper-free Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between 3,13-dibromo-5-methoxy-8,8,18,18 tetramethylbacteriochlorin (diBr-BC) and ethynyl-functionalized thienyl-DPP (desilylated form of TMS-DPP-1 shown in Fig. 1).49BC-DPP-1 was fully characterized by 1H NMR and low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI†). Therefore, for this unusual three-chromophore system, a perfect match with the calculated molar mass was observed.
X-ray structure of starting diBr-BC
During the course of synthesis of triad BC-DPP-1, we managed to obtain single crystals of starting diBr-BC with good diffraction qualities. The core shape of bacteriochlorin diBr-BC, depicted in Fig. 2, is close to a perfect square with a medium side of a = 2.97(6) Å and diagonal of 2√a = 4.2 Å. The two pyrrole rings and two gem-dimethyl pyrroline rings that constitute a bacteriochlorin alternate upon circumambulating the macrocycle; thus, the two pyrroline rings occupy opposite corners, as do the two pyrrole rings. It has also to be noted the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between N2 and N1 (N2–N1 = 2.926(3) Å, D–H–A = 124°).

Electrochemistry
The redox properties of diBr-BC and TMS-DPP-1, as references, and BC-DPP-1 were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV; Fig. 3) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV; Fig. S6, ESI†) in CH2Cl2 (0.1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4)). All the potentials in this paper are given vs. the SCE reference electrode, unless otherwise noted; in these conditions, 0.52 V must be subtracted from the potential value vs. SCE to obtain potentials vs. the Fc/Fc+ couple. Electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1.

b Partially reversible peak*.*Under our experimental conditions (CH2Cl2 + 0.1 M TEABF4), the ferrocene redox couple, which is known to be a reversible, mono-electronic transfer redox system, exhibits an Ipa/Ipc ratio equal to 1.0 whereas the peak potential difference is 120 mV. For Ox2 for BC-DPP-1, the potential difference between the anodic peak and cathodic peak is 190 mV and the ratio between the intensities of the anodic peak and the cathodic peak is 1.4. Accordingly, this redox system is not reversible. However, CV shows that the electro-generated species at the Ox2 peak can be partially reduced (a ratio of 1.4 means that ca. 70% of the oxidized species at the Ox2 peak are reduced). That is why we call it partially reversible.

The bacteriochlorin diBr-BC exhibits two reversible monoelectronic oxidations at 0.655 (cation radical) and 1.15 V (dication) and two monoelectronic reductions, the first one being reversible (anion radical) in contrast to the second one (dianion), at −1.02 and −1.365 V (Fig. 3). The potentials and reversibility of the reduction peaks are very similar to those recently reported by Crabtree and co-workers27 (for a Zn-bacteriochlorin, −0.95 and −1.37 vs. Ag/AgCl, i.e. ca. −0.99 and −1.41 V vs. SCE).
The CV curves of diketopyrrolopyrrole TMS-DPP-1 reveal two reversible monoelectronic oxidations at 1.04 and 1.34 V and three reduction peaks at −1.02 (reversible, monoelectronic), −1.59 (irreversible) and −1.67 V (irreversible). These features are very similar to the CV curves obtained by Ludwigs et al. for the same compound TMS-DPP-1 but without the trimethylsilylethynyl substituent (named DPP).53 In their conditions, DPP exhibits two reversible monoelectronic oxidations at 0.52 and 0.90 vs. Fc+/Fc (i.e. ca. 1.04 and 1.32 V vs. SCE) and one monoelectronic reduction at −1.69 V vs. Fc+/Fc (i.e. ca. −1.17 V vs. SCE).

BC-DPP-1 combines both DPP and BC moieties and exhibits three oxidation and four reduction peaks. In the positive potential domain, by comparison with TMS-DPP-1 and diBr-BC cyclic voltammograms, the first reversible oxidation peak (E1/2 = 0.645 V) may be attributed to the first oxidation of the BC chromophore (methoxy derivative). The second oxidation peak (at ca. 1.21 V, partially reversible) might involve the second oxidation of the BC as well as the first oxidation of the DPP moiety. The third quasi-reversible oxidation peak (E1/2 = 1.36 V) is attributed to the second oxidation of the DPP fragments.
These electrochemical data were used to assess frontier orbital energy levels (Table 2). First, the potentials of the first oxidation and first reduction of the different compounds have been referenced to the Fc+/Fc redox couple. Then, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated by using the following equations: HOMO = −(4.8 + E1/2(Ox1)) and LUMO = −(4.8 + E1/2(Red1)) according to Cardona et al.54 and Wang et al.55 The HOMO–LUMO band gap for BC-DPP-1 was 1.525 eV, a value slightly lower than the one estimated for diBr-BC (1.675 eV), which is consistent with a more extended π-system between BC and DPP moieties.

Optical properties
The optical absorption spectra of BC-DPP-1 and other materials in solution are shown in Fig. 4. The absorption spectrum of BC-DPP-1 as thin film (f) showed a red-shift in all the absorption bands compared to its solution (s) counterpart which indicates stronger inter-electronic π–π aggregation in the BC-DPP-1 film. The optical bandgap of BC-DPP-1 is about 1.36 eV which was estimated from the absorption onset wavelength in thin film. The narrow optical bandgap is because of the enhanced π-conjugation and ICT interaction between BC core and DPP end groups and is beneficial for photocurrent generation in NIR region and can improve the short circuit current of the resulting OSCs.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance was investigated using a BHJ active layer consisting of BC-DPP-1 as donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor. The energy levels of BC-DPP-1 and PC71BM (Table 2) are suitable for electron/hole transfer to/from PC71BM. The LUMO offset between BC-DPP-1 and PC71BM is only about 0.30 eV, which is approximately equal to the threshold value needed for exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the BHJ active layer with minimum energy loss. First of all, we optimized the donor to acceptor weight ratio and found that the OSCs based on a BHJ active layer with weight ratio of 2:1 showed the best photovoltaic performance. The current–voltage characteristics of the optimized (as cast) OSC under illumination are shown in Fig. 5a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The OSCs processed with as cast BC-DPP-1:PC71BM active layer showed overall PCE of 3.90% with Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 10.82 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.44. The value of PCE for as cast layer is moderate which is mainly due to the low values of Jsc and FF, which may be attributed to poor nanoscale morphology of active layer and unbalanced charge transport within the BHJ film. In order to improve the overall PCE of the binary active layer, first we mixed 3% (v/v) pyridine into the host solvent, i.e. solvent additive (SA), as pyridine has been used as SA for OSCs based on SM consisting of porphyrins.56,57 The OSC based on the SA processed active layer showed overall PCE of 6.39% (for details, see Table 3). After that the SA processed active layers were subjected to solvent vapor annealing for 40 s using THF, i.e. two-step annealing (TSA), and the resulting OSC showed a PCE of 7.48% with significant improvement in Jsc and FF (Fig. 5a and Table 3). Here we are only describing results for the OSCs based on as-cast and TSA-treated active layers. The enhancement in the PCE for the TSA-treated layers is mainly due to the increase in Jsc and FF which may be related to the change in the nanoscale morphology of active layer and more balanced charge transport. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that IPCE spectra showed broad photo-response from 300 nm to 900 nm and also closely resemble the absorption spectra of BC-DPP-1 and PC71BM, indicating that both BC-DPP-1 and PCBM contribute to exciton generation and photocurrent. The values of IPCE for TSA-treated active layer OSC are higher than that for as-cast counterpart. The values of Jsc estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra are 10.71 mA cm−2 and 14.44 mA cm−2 for as-cast and TSA-treated OSCs, respectively, and are very close to the values observed in J–V characteristics under illumination.

In order to get information about the TSA treatment in enhancing Jsc and FF, fundamental charge transport, exciton dissociation and recombination investigations were executed. The charge transport was assessed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method58 Hole only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron only (ITO/Al/active layer/Al) devices were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobilities in the BHJ active layers and current–voltage characteristics in the dark were measured (shown in Fig. 6 for hole only devices). The electron mobilities were also measured in a similar way using the electron only devices. The hole mobilities in as-cast and TSA-treated active layers are about 7.15 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereas the electron mobilities are about 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Both the hole and electron mobilities were increased after the TSA treatment but the degree of the enhancement for hole mobility is much greater than for electron mobility. The electron to hole mobility ratios for as-cast and TSA-treated active layers are 3.27 and 1.45, respectively, indicating the charge transport in the TSA-treated device is more balanced as compared to the as-cast counterpart which may be the main reason for the enhancement in Jsc and FF.

The variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) is employed to understand exciton dissociation and charge extraction mechanisms as reported in the literature59,60 and shown in Fig. 7. Jph is estimated as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is described as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage. In general, it is assumed that when Veff is high enough, all photogenerated excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected by the electrodes. As shown in Fig. 7, in the case of TSA active layer OSC, Jph demonstrates a rapid increase toward saturated state (Jphsat) at low Veff (≤0.65 V), indicating efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport, extraction and collection. However, in the case of as-cast OSC, the saturation state of Jph is reached at around 1.58 V, indicating poor exciton dissociation, extraction and collection of charge carriers, which may cause the recombination of charge carriers in the active layer before collection by the electrodes, leading to the low value of FF. The value of Jphsat for as cast and TSA are 12.29 mA cm−2 and 15.59 mA cm−2, respectively. The value of maximum exciton dissociation rate (Gmax) can be estimated as Gmax = Jphsat/qL and the values of Gmax for as-cast and TSA active layer-based OSCs are 0.89 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.13 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and collection probability (Pcoll) were estimated by the ratio of Jph/Jphsat under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively. The Pdiss/Pcoll of as-cast and TSA-processed active layer-based OSCs are 0.88/0.69 and 0.961/0.73, respectively. The TSA-based OSC showed high Pdiss and Pcoll, indicating that both the exciton dissociation and charge collection were enhanced after TSA treatment and are consistent with the values of Jsc and FF.
 Fig. 7  Variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for OSCs based on different active layers. 
The charge carrier recombination mechanism was further analyzed by the variation of Jsc and Voc with illumination intensity (Pin) as shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. The dependence of Jsc with Pin can be described as Jsc ∝ (Pin)γ, where γ is the recombination constant and gives information about the extent of recombination. In general, a value of γ closer to unity indicates that more free charge carriers can be extracted prior to recombination, whereas a value of γ deviating from unity indicates more bimolecular recombination. The values of γ for as-cast and TSA-based OSCs are 0.892 and 0.949, respectively, indicating the bimolecular recombination is suppressed by the TSA treatment of the active layer. The slope of a Voc–Pin plot helps to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the OSCs under open circuit condition. When the slope is kT/q then the bimolecular recombination is dominant. If there is a stronger dependence of Voc on Pin with slope of 2kT/q then the trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is dominant. The values of slope for as-cast and TSA are about 1.54kT/q and 1.23kT/q, respectively, indicating that the SRH recombination is dominant in the as-cast device which is suppressed upon TSA treatment.

In order to get information about the influence of TSA on the crystallinity and stacking behavior of BC-DPP-1:PC71BM blend, X-ray diffraction patterns of thin films were recorded (Fig. 9). The as-cast BC-DPP-1:PC71BM showed three reflection peaks located at 2θ = 4.96°, 18.46° and 23.88° corresponding to (100) of BC-DPP-1, PC71BM and (010) of BC-DPP-1, respectively. The lamellar d-spacing and π–π stacking distance in the as-cast film are about 1.81 nm and 0.38 nm, respectively. In the case of TSA-treated blend the lamellar (100) is located at 2θ = 4.96° with increased intensity and π–π stacking (010) is located at 2θ = 24.42° (π–π stacking distance = 0.371 nm). Peaks of the TSA-treated BC-DPP-1:PC71BM film are more pronounced and sharper than those of the as-cast sample, indicating the crystallinity has been increased and the formation of stronger molecular packing and compact π–π stacking distance, which is more suitable for more efficient and balanced charge transport as supported by the SCLC results. After the TSA treatment, the coherence lengths of both lamellar d-spacing and π–π stacking were increased. The increase in the crystallinity and CCL after the TSA may be beneficial for charge transport which is consistent with the enhanced values of FF and Jsc.

Although the OSCs based on optimized BC-DPP-1:PC71BM showed wide IPCE spectra extending up to 900 nm owing to the contribution of the narrow bandgap of BC-DPP-1, the low IPCE value at the bottom of the valley (around 700 nm) clearly reflected the intrinsic absorption deficiency between 650 nm and 750 nm. Therefore, we assumed that ternary OSCs consisting of one more donor have great potential to enhance the light harvesting ability between 650 nm and 750 nm and improve the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs. Therefore, we have selected a wide-bandgap SM donor denoted as SM1 as a third component for ternary OSCs due to its complementary absorption spectrum and aligned energy levels with respect to both BC-DPP-1 and PC71BM. We kept the amount of PC71BM constant and varied the weight ratios between SM1 and BC-DPP-1 and the total concentration is 14 mg mL−1 as used for the binary device. For the optimization of ternary active layer, we adopted the same methods as for the binary layer, i.e. TSA. Compared to the binary OSC, BC-DPP-1:PC71BM, the ternary OSCs based on three active layers, namely BC-DPP-1:xSM1:PC71BM (x = 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 100% w/w), showed enhanced PCE of 8.39%, 9.08%, 9.88% 9.51%, 8.56% and 7.40%, respectively (details for photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S6, ESI†). The J–V characteristics of the optimized ternary OSC are shown in Fig. 5a. The IPCE spectrum of the ternary OSC is shown in Fig. 5b and exhibit a broad photo-response from 300 nm to 900 nm, indicating that all three components (BC-DPP-1, PC71BM and SM1) contribute to the photocurrent generation. The Jsc value estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra is 16.32 mA cm−2, which closely resembles the experimental value observed in J–V measurements. The increase in the PCE may be mainly due to the improved light harvesting ability in the range 650–750 nm and positive morphology for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the ternary device with SM. Moreover, Voc for the ternary OSC being higher than that for the binary counterpart may be related to the deeper HOMO energy level of SM1 as compared to BC-DPP-1.
The energy level diagram of BC-DPP-1, SM1 and PC71BM is shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the LUMO offsets for BC-DPP-1/PC71BM and SM1/PC71BM are about 0.75 eV and 0.68 eV, respectively, indicating that there is efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer at both the interfaces in the ternary active layer. Moreover, the HOMO offset between BC-DPP1 and SM1 is about 0.26 eV, which is very close to the threshold value for exciton dissociation and charge transfer, indicating that efficient dissociation and charge transfer are feasible at the BC-DPP-1/SM1 interface. Therefore, there are three interfaces present in the ternary active layer whereas there is only one D/A interface present in the binary active layer, indicating that the D/A interfacial area has been increased in the ternary active layer which is beneficial for improvement in Jsc and FF, and thereby overall PCE.

The hole and electron mobilities in the ternary active layers are measured as for the binary layer and the dark J–V characteristics of hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 6. The hole and electron mobilities in the ternary active layer are about 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the electron to hole mobility ratio is about 1.18 which is lower than that for the binary counterpart. The high and balanced charge transport properties of ternary OSCs facilitate efficient charge extraction and collection and suppress bimolecular recombination which are responsible for improved FF and Jsc and overall PCE of the ternary OSC.61,62
The value of γ in the Jsc–Pin plot (Fig. 8a) is about 0.978 which is higher than that for the binary counterpart indicating that the bimolecular recombination is further suppressed in the ternary OSC. The value of slope observed in the Voc–Pin plot (Fig. 8b) for ternary OSC is 1.13kT/q, being lower than that for the binary counterpart, also demonstrating that the trap-assisted recombination is hindered in the ternary OSC.63
As can be seen from Fig. 7, Jph increases more rapidly with the increase in Veff for the ternary OSC as compared to the binary counterpart and saturates at a value of Veff of 0.36 V which is lower than that for the binary counterpart. The value of Gmax for the ternary active layer is about 1.22 × 1028 m3 s−1, which is higher than that of the binary layer, and consistent with the broader photo-response for IPCE spectra. The values of Pdiss (0.978) and Pcoll (0.76) are higher for ternary OSCs as compared to binary ones, indicating more efficient exciton dissociation and higher charge transport efficiency and extraction compared to the binary counterpart, also supporting the higher FF.59,64
Moreover, the energy loss (Eloss), which is described as Eloss = qVoc − Eg, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the donor or acceptor used in the active layer,65 which is small, is about 0.58 eV and 0.48 eV for optimized binary and ternary OSCs, respectively. The low value of Eloss for the ternary OSC may be related to the suppression of recombination.66
Upon the introduction of SM1 to the binary BC-DPP-1:PC71BM blend (Fig. 9), the ternary blend exhibits a shifted (100) diffraction peak at 5.23° (lamellar distance = 1.72 nm) and broadened (010) peak with a shift located at 24.98° (π–π stacking distance = 0.36 nm), demonstrating than the addition of SM1 leads to stronger π–π stacking than in the binary counterpart. The CCL of π–π stacking was also found to be increased from 4.23 nm to 4.78 nm. The privileged morphology of the ternary blend is responsible for better charge transport and collection and resulting enhancement in overall PCE.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have explored the possibility of a narrow-bandgap small molecule consisting of a bacteriochlorin core and two DPP terminal units linked via ethynyl bridges as the donor along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor for BHJ OSCs. After the optimization of the active layer, the OSC showed an overall PCE of 7.48%. Utilization of SM1 as the complementary donor enables the BC-DPP-1:PC71BM binary system to produce a 32% increase in the PCE to 9.88%. The enhancement in the Voc for the ternary OSC may be attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level of SM1. The increase in Jsc may be related to the broader IPCE spectra of the ternary system as compared to the binary system, whereas the improvement in FF may be ascribed to the more balanced charge transport due to the more appropriate interpenetrating pathways and morphology of the ternary active layer.
