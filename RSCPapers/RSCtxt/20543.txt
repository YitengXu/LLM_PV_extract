    , Accepted 31st March 2022First published on 12th April 2022AbstractCarrier extraction in mixed tin–lead perovskite solar cells is improved by modifying the top and bottom perovskite surfaces with ethylenediammonium diiodide and glycine hydrochloride, respectively. Trap densities in perovskite layers are reduced as a result of surface passivation effects and an increase in film crystallinity. In addition, the oriented aggregation of the ethylenediammonium and glycinium cations at the charge collection interfaces results in the formation of surface dipoles, which facilitate charge extraction. As a result, the treated mixed tin–lead perovskite solar cells showed improved performance, with a fill factor of 0.82 and a power conversion efficiency of up to 23.6%. The unencapsulated device also shows improved stability under AM1.5 G, retaining over 80% of the initial efficiency after 200 h continuous operation in an inert atmosphere. Our strategy is also successfully applied to centimeter-scale devices, with efficiencies of up to 21.0%.

Broader context
Monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells are a highly promising low cost-per-watt solar technology. Currently, the power conversion efficiency of the narrow gap subcell, which is commonly fabricated from a mixed tin–lead perovskite absorber, is relatively poor. High trap densities, particularly at the surface of the tin–lead perovskite film, act as recombination centers. To address this, we applied surfactant molecules to the top and bottom surfaces of the tin–lead perovskite layer. Post-treatment with ethylenediammonium diiodide modified the top surface, resulting in lower carrier trap densities. The bottom surface was passivated using a glycine hydrochloride additive, which spontaneously accumulated underneath the perovskite layer during film fabrication. Surface dipoles were formed at both top and bottom interfaces, promoting charge extraction and leading to a significant improvement in the output voltage and fill factor of the solar cell devices.

Introduction
Due to their strong optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and efficient charge generation,1,2 metal halide perovskites are promising materials for printable, cost-effective next-generation photovoltaics. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be optimized for solar radiation by bringing the perovskite bandgap closer to the ideal range of 1.1–1.4 eV.3,4 Although most lead perovskite materials have bandgaps larger than 1.45 eV,5,6 smaller bandgaps can be obtained for tin–lead (Sn–Pb) compositions7–9 in which about half of the lead ions are substituted with tin.10 Introducing tin into the perovskite lattice, however, can adversely affect the device performance11–13 – primarily by self-doping due to the oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV).14 This process readily occurs through reaction with the solvent15,16 or trace oxygen.17,18 Suppressing these oxidation processes is therefore the key to realizing high device performance. Several means have been reported to reduce the Sn(IV) content in tin-containing perovskite films, including reducing agents19–23 as well as antioxidants.24–26
Currently, the highest PCE of mixed Sn–Pb perovskite devices reaches over 22%.27–31 Tan et al. achieved this by using a zwitterionic antioxidant, formamidine sulfinic acid, as a bifunctional additive, which both suppressed Sn(II) oxidation and passivated defects at the perovskite grain surfaces.27 Yan et al. used a reducing agent, 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid, and vertical Pb/Sn compositional gradients to enhance photocarrier separation and suppress carrier recombination.29 Zhu et al. were able to passivate structural defects in the Sn–Pb perovskite by adding guanidinium thiocyanate, which increased the charge carrier lifetimes (>1 μs) and diffusion lengths (>2.5 μm).32 Meanwhile, very recently, we achieved ultra-long carrier lifetimes (>7 μs) by applying a Sn(IV) scavenging method22 and treating the purified Sn–Pb films with maltol.33 Even with these long lifetimes, however, the efficiencies of mixed Sn–Pb devices10,27,28,32,34–41 still remain below those of their pure lead counterparts.42–47 As the quality of the material already appears to be sufficiently high, we believe that the efficiency of Sn–Pb PSCs is now primarily limited by poor carrier dynamics at the interfaces with the charge collection layers.48 We therefore aim to improve the structural and electronic properties at the top and bottom regions of the perovskite films by modifying them with surfactants containing a methylammonium terminal group. Methylammonium surfactants with different functional groups, such as NH3+–CH2–R (R = –CH2–NH3+ (ethylenediammonium, EDA2+)49,50 or –COOH (glycinium, GlyH+)51), offer the means of systematically tailoring the electrostatics at perovskite interfaces (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the challenge for improving the properties of the perovskite films is to selectively and reliably apply these simple surfactant molecules on specific charge extraction surfaces with favorable orientation in an easy and efficient way.

Design strategy
We propose the use of EDAI2 for the post-treatment of the perovskite top surface. The EDA2+ is sufficiently small to allow for electronic contact between the perovskite and the top charge transport layer (Fig. 1a). In addition, since EDA2+ is too short to occupy two A-sites of the perovskite lattice simultaneously,52,53 2D phases should not be formed. Unlike the EDA (ethane-1,2-diamine), a bidentate neutral base with lone pairs,54 for EDA2+, we speculate that one methylammonium group binds to the surface of the perovskite films, reducing the density of structural defects, especially the acceptor-like defects, and unsatisfied dangling bonds. The other methylammonium group would then point away from the perovskite surface, inducing a surface dipole,55 which may facilitate electron extraction from the top surface into the electron collecting layer of positive–intrinsic–negative (p–i–n) structured (inverted) PSCs.
When glycine hydrochloride (GlyHCl) is added into the perovskite precursor solution, the methylammonium head of GlyH+ is expected to bind to the surface of the perovskite crystallites, stabilizing the formation of larger particles.56 These particles, which sediment at the bottom interface, serve as nucleation centers in the film growth process.51 Therefore, the electronegative carboxyl groups at the bottom surface face outwards from the perovskite, towards the hole collection layer. The orientation of the resulting dipole creates an electric field57 which assists in driving the holes to the hole collection layer.
Realizing the modifications to the top and bottom regions
We started with a three A-site cations mixed Sn–Pb perovskite, Cs0.1FA0.6MA0.3Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium), fabricated, as reported in our previous work,33 from a 1.8 M precursor solution prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide with a volume ratio of 3:1. 10 mol% tin fluoride (SnF2), with respect to SnI2, and 2 mol% ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN), with respect to the total amount of the B-site precursor (SnI2 + PbI2), were added to the perovskite precursor solution. SnF2 suppresses Sn(II) oxidation,22,58,59 while thiocyanate salts mediate the perovskite crystal growth.10,60,61 This perovskite is the control to which the treated perovskite layers are compared. For top interface modification, a solution of EDAI2 in isopropanol/toluene (volume ratio of 1:1) is spin-coated on the top of perovskite films. This perovskite will be referred to as “EDAI2-treated”. To modify the bottom interface, GlyHCl (2 mol% with respect to the total amount of the B-site precursor) is added into the precursor solution. The perovskite layer to which both EDAI2 and GlyHCl treatments have been applied will be referred to as “EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated”.
To pinpoint the regions affected by each treatment, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to track the distributions of the EDA2+ and GlyH+ ions throughout the perovskite film (Fig. S1–S5, ESI†). The ToF-SIMS results show that the EDA2+ cations introduced by post-treatment are mainly distributed on the perovskite top surface (Fig. 1b, c and S6–S8, ESI†). In contrast, GlyH+ cations are found to be mainly located at the bottom region of the perovskite films (Fig. 1b, c and S9–S18, ESI†).
Further experiments were performed to better understand why GlyH+ cations preferentially aggregate towards the bottom region of the perovskite films. Although it has been reported for additives that the concentration gradients in perovskite layers can depend on the substrates, such as NiOx/ITO62 and NiOx/FTO63 (ITO and FTO stand for indium tin oxide and fluorine-doped tin oxide, respectively). The distribution of GlyH+ in the perovskite layers was concentrated near the substrate, regardless of the substrate examined (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Similar ion distributions were observed within the perovskite films fabricated on poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-coated, PTAA/PFN-coated, and bare FTO (PFN and PTAA is poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], respectively.) The distribution of GlyH+ is therefore more likely governed by interactions with the perovskite surfaces, as indicated by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results (Fig. S19, ESI†). Furthermore, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were conducted to study the formation of particles in the perovskite precursor solutions with and without the addition of GlyH+ (Fig. S20, ESI†). The results show that the size distribution of the perovskite colloidal particles formed in the solution was significantly altered after introducing GlyH+, with the big particles predominant in the colloidal system. We therefore propose that the GlyH+ is initially bound to the colloidal particles in the perovskite precursor solution (Fig. 1a). Large perovskite particles sediment at the substrate surface, where they serve as nucleation sites for the subsequent growth of the perovskite layer after the anti-solvent addition. While GlyH+ bound to the top surface of the nuclei are most likely replaced by the A-site cations stoichiometrically required for the continuous growth of the 3D perovskite layer, GlyH+ bound to the bottom surfaces remains, since there are no A-site components in a solution nearby. Note that no low dimensional perovskite phases were observed by XRD, even as the amount of GlyH+ was increased to 8 mol% (Fig. S21, ESI†). Although an extensive study would be necessary to examine the further details of the underlying mechanism, we assume that the residual GlyH+ is located as deposits at the bottom surface and grain boundaries as suggested by the ToF-SIMS results.
Effects of the treatments on film quality
The morphology of the perovskite layers was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). All samples show good coverage with large grains. Post-treatment with the EDAI2 solution appears to have a polishing effect64, washing away the surface layer of the perovskite film. In the control sample, some deposits, probably from SnF2,65–67 are visible between the grain boundaries (Fig. 1d). These deposits are less prominent after the perovskite films are post-treated with EDAI2 solution, and the surface roughness is reduced from 42 nm for control to 37 nm for the films treated with EDAI2 solution (Fig. S22, ESI†).
Viewed in the cross-section, all the perovskite films show an even, monolithic grain structure. The average thickness is 870, 830, and 860 nm for the control, EDAI2-treated, and the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite films, respectively (Fig. 1e and Fig. S23, ESI†). The EDAI2-treated film is notably thinner than the control, confirming the polishing effect of the post-treatment with EDAI2 solution. The isopropanol/toluene co-solvent system was found to be critical for this top surface modification. The details are given in the ESI† (Fig. S23 and S24). The polarity of the isopropanol helps the organic ammonium salts to anchor to the film surface, enhancing defect passivation.68 Sn-containing perovskites are soluble in isopropanol;69 however, so toluene was added to reduce the overall viscosity of the solution and accelerate the dispersion of the EDAI2 solution on the films before spinning.
The effect of the treatments on the crystallinity of the perovskite layers was monitored by thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. S21 and S25–S27, ESI†). Peaks at 14.2, 20.1, 24.6, 28.4, 31.9, 35.0, 40.7, and 43.2°, were observed for all the films, corresponding to (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (300) planes, respectively. The intensity of the (100) peak increases after the EDAI2 post-treatment, possibly as a result of the surface polishing effect64 and/or second stage crystallization.70 The intensity of the (100) peak was enhanced further in the XRD pattern of the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated film, suggesting that the GlyHCl additive is likely to be active during the crystal growth phase where it acts to enhance the crystallinity of the film. No low-dimensional phase was detected. The small peak at 2θ = 12.7° is attributed to PbI2 from the unreacted precursor material or the degraded perovskite.71,72 Although the peak was observed in the patterns of the control and EDAI2-treated films, it was absent in that of the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite film.
For effective charge extraction, high quality perovskite films with long charge carrier lifetimes are necessary. The improvements in the carrier dynamics were evaluated by using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL). The excitation energy was 1.80 eV, and the excitation photon flux was fixed at 3.5 × 1011 photons cm−2 (100 nJ cm−2), comparable to the incident photon flux under AM1.5 G. The perovskite films were excited either from the top surface of the perovskite film (front-side, Fig. S28, ESI†), or through the quartz substrate (back-side, Fig. 2a and b). Regional sampling specificity is possible, since the thickness of the perovskite films (∼850 nm) is considerably greater than the estimated optical penetration depth (1/α: ∼220 nm, α is absorption coefficient at 688 nm (1.80 eV), Fig. S29, ESI†). In each condition, a single PL peak around 1.25 eV was observed, with PL lifetimes on the order of microseconds. Note that the PL spectrum is slightly blue-shifted in the control films with the front-side excitation (Fig. S28 and Table S1, ESI†), when compared to the others. One of the possible origins of this blue shift is a Burstein–Moss shift, induced by significant unintentional hole doping.73 Another is a bandgap fluctuation due to compositional deviation at the film surface. These assumptions are reasonable considering that the surface quality of the control film is likely somewhat worse than the treated materials. With front-side excitation, the lifetime increased from 2.8 μs for the control films, to 4.5 μs for the EDAI2 post-treated films, and 4.9 μs for the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films, indicating that defects are greatly suppressed. At the top surface, most of the improvement originates from the EDAI2 treatment, as expected. Meanwhile, with back-side excitation, the lifetimes were elongated from 1.5 μs for control sample, to 3.2 μs for EDAI2-treated, and finally to 5.5 μs for the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films. Notably, the influence of the GlyHCl on the lifetimes is more prominent when the bottom region is probed. The steady state PL intensities were also increased (Table S1 and Fig. S30, ESI†). The results clearly show that EDAI2 post-treatment and GlyHCl additive are able to reduce the density of recombination centers in the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite films, particularly at the top and bottom regions, respectively.74

(c) PL decay curves for the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite film showing the variation in PL lifetimes with excitation intensity. Curve fits used to ascertain the PL lifetimes75 are shown by dashed lines, see the ESI† (Fig. S31). (d) Dependence of the lifetime and initial intensity of the PL signal on the excitation fluence. An initial carrier density of 1.5 × 1016 cm−3 corresponds to an excitation fluence of 100 nJ cm−2 (approx. AM1.5 G, 1 Sun). Black solid lines are the curve fits obtained using the rate equations reported in our previous work.75 
In order to better characterize the photocarrier recombination dynamics in the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated films, the PL decay was examined under different excitation intensities. The dependencies of PL decay curves, PL lifetimes, and initial PL intensities on photon flux are shown in Fig. 2c, d and Fig. S31 (ESI†). The decay curves can be modelled using the rate equations reported in our previous work.75 The results indicate that bimolecular recombination is dominant under a photon flux equivalent of AM1.5 G (initial carrier density n0 = 1.5 × 1016 cm−3). The charge carrier trapping rate is 9.2 × 104 s−1, three orders of magnitude lower than that of prototypical metal halide perovskite MAPbI3.75 The low trap densities for both electrons and holes are confirmed by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements (Fig. S32 and Table S2, ESI†). Most of these traps can be reasonably assumed to be located at the various surfaces of the perovskite layer.76 From the decay curve fits, the charge carrier density from unintentional doping is estimated to be 8.2 × 1014 cm−3, a value similar to the carrier densities reported for the high quality lead perovskite films (∼1015 cm−3).75
To summarize, the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite films, modified via both EDAI2 surface treatment and the addition of GlyHCl, show improved crystallinity and reduced defect densities, especially at the top and bottom regions. Characteristic p-doping, commonly observed in Sn-containing perovskite materials,77,78 has been effectively suppressed as suggested with the low unintentional doping induced carrier density.
Solar cell performance
The cells had the following inverted architecture: FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig. 3a). The active cell area was 0.0985 cm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under simulated AM1.5 G illumination (Fig. 3b). The best performance of the control cells was 19.6% (reverse scan, VOC = 0.79 V, JSC = 31.6 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.79). After the EDAI2 post-treatment, the PCE increased to 21.7% (reverse scan, VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 32.3 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.79). The FF remains the same, but the JSC and VOC increased. For the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated device, a maximum PCE of 23.6% was obtained (reverse scan, VOC = 0.89 V, JSC = 32.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.82). The stabilized power output is shown in Fig. S33, (ESI†) which presents a PCE of 22.8% at 300 s. The J–V curves of the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated devices show a small hysteresis (hysteresis index: 0.017), suggesting suppressed ion movements.79 The suppressed ion movements in the cells fabricated with GlyHCl relates to the enhanced crystallinity. In addition to the increase in VOC, for these modified cells, the FF improved as well. This efficiency is the highest reported value for any Sn–Pb perovskite solar cell, in addition to being one of the highest reported values for PSC having an inverted structure (Fig. S34, ESI†).47,80 The cell performance measured by the Kanagawa Institute of Industrial Science and Technology (KISTEC) was 23.1% for the reverse scan (VOC = 0.88 V, JSC = 32.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.81) and 22.2% for the forward scan (VOC = 0.86 V, JSC = 32.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.79) (Fig. S35 and S36, ESI†). All the related J–V results are summarized in Fig. S37–S39 and Table S3 (ESI†).

(d), J–V curves for the champion device measured with no optical mask and an active area of around 0.16 cm2. (e) Normalized maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curves for the unencapsulated control, EDAI2-treated, and EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated devices operating under AM1.5 G in an inert atmosphere. The initial efficiencies were 14.8, 18.2, and 20.1%, respectively. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3c. The highest IQE is close to unity, and the EQE reached 90%. The integrated JSC from the EQE spectrum is 32.2 mA cm−2, in close agreement with the values derived from the J–V scans (32.5 mA cm−2). The bandgap, estimated from the inflection point of the EQE spectrum,81 is around 1.25 eV, in line with the PL results.
As mentioned by the previous reports,43 when the device area is larger than the optical mask used for the J–V measurements, the recorded VOC values are slightly below the achievable maximum. With the optical mask removed, the VOC reached 0.91 V (Fig. 3d), 0.07 V below the thermodynamic limit of 0.98 V.82 The high VOC corresponds to a voltage loss of 0.34 V – one of the best results thus far for perovskite solar cell devices.42,83 The low voltage loss together with the long charge carrier lifetimes observed in the PL experiments confirm the remarkable suppression of non-radiative recombination channels in the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated devices.
The operational stability was evaluated by tracking the maximum power point84 under AM1.5 G. Unencapsulated devices were measured in a N2-filled glovebox. The EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated cell maintained over 80% of the initial PCE for up to 200 h, and was more stable than either the EDAI2-treated (65% in 180 h) or control (60% in 145 h) cells (Fig. 3e and Fig. S40, ESI†). The stability of the PSCs may be limited by the use of PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer. This material is known to be hygroscopic, and its acidity may negatively impact the stability of the perovskite layer.85 These effects could be mitigated by moving to a different hole selective layer, such as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)31 or modifying the acidity of the PEDOT system.86
Our top and bottom interface modification strategy was also applied to the fabrication of larger, centimeter-scale PSCs (Table S4 and Fig. S41 and S42, ESI†). For a 1 cm2 active area, a champion PCE of 21.0% (forward scan, VOC = 0.88 V, JSC = 33.1 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72) was achieved. The cells generally showed minimal hysteresis and good reproducibility.
Carrier extraction
For further insights regarding the improved performance, especially the low voltage loss, the effect of the EDAI2 and GlyHCl treatments on the energy levels of the perovskite films was examined with ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). The UPS experiments probe the vacuum, Fermi, and valence energy levels near the top surface of the perovskite films, where electrons are extracted in the working solar cells.
Four systems were measured. In addition to the control and EDAI2 post-treated films with and without GlyHCl additive, a film prepared with GlyHCl additive but without EDAI2 post-treatment was also examined (Fig. 4a and b). With this sample set, we investigated the influence of the EDAI2 post-treatment on the perovskite films prepared both without and with the GlyHCl additive. The secondary electron cutoffs, from which the work function of the perovskite surface can be estimated as (21.22 eV – EB,max), are shown in Fig. 4a. The onset of the valence band relative to the Fermi level is estimated from the spectral data in Fig. 4b. The energies of the Fermi and vacuum levels for each of the four samples relative to the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are compiled in Fig. 4c. Comparing the control and EDAI2-treated films, we can see that the vacuum level and Fermi levels both shift, by 0.05 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively, to lie closer to the CBM. When the perovskite film contains the GlyHCl additive, however, the shift in the Fermi level is less pronounced, at only 0.02 eV, while the EDAI2 post-treatment results in a shift in the vacuum energy of 0.04 eV, similar to what was observed for the control films.

(c) Energy-level scheme based on the UPS spectra. The full analysis is shown in Fig. S43 and S44 (ESI†). Energy values are given in electron volts relative to the vacuum level, Evac, and the conduction band energies are determined from the bandgap of 1.25 eV estimated from the PL measurements.

(e) Schematic illustrating how electron and hole extraction enhanced by surface dipoles induced by EDA2+ and GlyH+ cations at the top and bottom perovskite interfaces, respectively. 
In the UPS measurements, a surface dipole is indicated by a change of the vacuum level (Evac) relative to the valence level of the perovskite films (Fig. 4c and S43, S44, ESI†).55,57,87–89 Post-treatment with EDAI2 leads to the formation of a surface dipole with a magnitude of about 0.05 eV for the control film, and 0.04 eV for the film fabricated using the GlyHCl additive. The positive end of the dipole faces outwards from the perovskite.42,90 These results support our hypothesis that EDA2+, which accumulates at the top surface, is collectively bound to and oriented at the perovskite crystal grains. The potential difference created by the dipole can facilitate electron extraction by helping to sweep electrons away from the perovskite surface and towards the C60 electron collection layer.90
In addition, electron extraction may be enhanced by surface doping effects, indicated by the shifts of the UPS-determined Fermi levels (EF) with respect to the valence and conduction bands. EDAI2 post-treatment appears to induce the perovskite surface to become more n-type (the EF shifts to lie above the center of the band gap, Fig. 4c). The shift is more pronounced for the control film than the film with the GlyHCl additive, at –0.11 eV and –0.02 eV, respectively. The result can be understood by noting that while the Fermi level of the control film was nominally at the middle of the bandgap (0.60 eV from the VBM), the Fermi level of the GlyHCl-treated film was already close to the conduction band (0.71 eV from the VBM). Thus, while EDAI2 post-treatment makes the perovskite surface more n-type, the effect appears to vary depending on how p-type the surface region was initially. The Fermi level shifts correlate well with the difference in Sn(IV) concentrations observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S45 and Table S5, ESI†). If the top surface is more n-type than the bulk, band bending will be induced in the downward direction at the perovskite, facilitating electron extraction by drawing electrons to and holes away from the extraction layer.
As GlyH+ cations mainly accumulate at the bottom region of the perovskite films, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to examine the charge extraction from the perovskite layers to the PEDOT:PSS substrate. The ESR signal allows us to quantify the charge states in PEDOT:PSS films with and without perovskite capping layers (Fig. 4d and Fig. S46, Table S6, ESI†). The unit intensity is the peak-to-peak ESR intensity of the Mn2+ standard sample (IMn). The ESR absorption intensity of the PEDOT:PSS film was 131 IMn units, centered at 319.2 mT. When the PEDOT:PSS layer was coated with the control perovskite, the absorption intensity of the PEDOT:PSS ESR signal decreased to 63.6 IMn units, indicating that, as a result in the difference in Fermi levels between the perovskite layer and the PEDOT:PSS,91 some electrons from perovskite recombine with holes in the PEDOT:PSS layer at the interface. When the PEDOT:PSS is coated with the perovskite containing GlyHCl additive, however, the absorption intensity is only reduced to 85.6 IMn units, indicating fewer recombination events.
The change in absorption intensity of the ESR signal correlates with the relative position of the Fermi levels in the PEDOT:PSS and perovskite layers. The results imply that the Fermi level in the PEDOT:PSS and perovskite layers are closer in energy when the GlyHCl additive is used. The UPS results, meanwhile, confirm that the work function of the perovskite layer is not evidently altered by the addition of GlyHCl (control: 4.73 eV, GlyHCl: 4.69 eV). The GlyH+ cation, which accumulates at the bottom interface, binds to and aligns with the perovskite crystal face (Fig. 1a and 4e), inducing a surface dipole where the electronegative –COOH group points outwards from the perovskite surface. The resulting dipole, with the negative side facing the PEDOT:PSS layer, creates an electric field which drives the holes to PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 4e).57
Conclusions
Mixed Sn–Pb solar cells with high open circuit voltages and high fill factors were realized by optimizing charge extraction. Interface modification strategies using surfactants containing methylammonium terminal groups were used to facilitate the extraction of electrons and holes at the top and bottom perovskite surfaces, respectively. Post-treatment with EDAI2 showed polishing and passivation effects at the top surface, leading to lower carrier trap densities. The GlyHCl additive resulted in the accumulation of GlyH+ cations at the bottom region of the perovskite layer as well as an improvement in the film crystallinity. The GlyHCl treatment helped to passivate recombination centers, particularly at the bottom region of the perovskite layer. In addition to improvements in the perovskite layer, EDA2+ and GlyH+ cations at the top and bottom regions induced surface dipoles which facilitate electron and hole transfer, respectively, to the charge collection layers.
As a result of the improvements arising from the top and bottom passivation and dipole formation, the PCE of mixed Sn–Pb solar cells with a 0.0985 cm2 aperture area increased to 23.6%, the highest value reported so far for mixed Sn–Pb PSCs, and one of the highest values reported so far for PSCs with the inverted structure regardless of perovskite composition. Our top and bottom interface modification strategy was also applied to the fabrication of larger, centimeter-scale PSCs showing high efficiency with small hysteresis and good reproducibility. The easy-to-handle and effective approach should be widely applicable to other perovskite semiconductor devices, such as all-perovskite and perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics, perovskite light-emitting diodes, transistors, and X-ray detectors.

Broader context
Monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells are a highly promising low cost-per-watt solar technology. Currently, the power conversion efficiency of the narrow gap subcell, which is commonly fabricated from a mixed tin–lead perovskite absorber, is relatively poor. High trap densities, particularly at the surface of the tin–lead perovskite film, act as recombination centers. To address this, we applied surfactant molecules to the top and bottom surfaces of the tin–lead perovskite layer. Post-treatment with ethylenediammonium diiodide modified the top surface, resulting in lower carrier trap densities. The bottom surface was passivated using a glycine hydrochloride additive, which spontaneously accumulated underneath the perovskite layer during film fabrication. Surface dipoles were formed at both top and bottom interfaces, promoting charge extraction and leading to a significant improvement in the output voltage and fill factor of the solar cell devices.


 	Fig. 1  Narrow-bandgap perovskite films with top and bottom interface modification. (a) Schematic illustration of the interface modifications of mixed Sn–Pb perovskite films by the GlyHCl additive and EDAI2 surface treatment. (b) ToF-SIMS depth profile of EDA+ and Gly− ions for the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS/FTO. Full ion profiles are given in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S18). (c) Reconstructed, background subtracted 3D maps showing the distributions of EDA+ and Gly− ions through the modified perovskite films. The raster area of the primary ion beam was 30 μm × 30 μm, and the thickness axis has been expanded for clarity. (d) Top-view (scale bar: 2 μm) and (e), cross-sectional (scale bar: 500 nm) SEM images of the control, EDAI2-treated, and EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated (left to right) perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS-coated FTO/glass substrates.	 

 	Fig. 2  Carrier dynamics. (a) Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and (b) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) for the perovskite films on quartz substrates with the back-side excitation. (c) PL decay curves for the EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated perovskite film showing the variation in PL lifetimes with excitation intensity. Curve fits used to ascertain the PL lifetimes75 are shown by dashed lines, see the ESI† (Fig. S31). (d) Dependence of the lifetime and initial intensity of the PL signal on the excitation fluence. An initial carrier density of 1.5 × 1016 cm−3 corresponds to an excitation fluence of 100 nJ cm−2 (approx. AM1.5 G, 1 Sun). Black solid lines are the curve fits obtained using the rate equations reported in our previous work.75	 

 	Fig. 3  Solar cell devices. (a) Schematic and cross-sectional SEM image. (b) J–V curves of the best performing devices. (c) The EQE, IQE, and reflectance spectra of an EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated device. (d), J–V curves for the champion device measured with no optical mask and an active area of around 0.16 cm2. (e) Normalized maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curves for the unencapsulated control, EDAI2-treated, and EDAI2/GlyHCl-treated devices operating under AM1.5 G in an inert atmosphere. The initial efficiencies were 14.8, 18.2, and 20.1%, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Band structure and surface dipole formation. (a) Secondary electron cut-off and (b) valence band regions of the UPS spectra for the perovskite films. (c) Energy-level scheme based on the UPS spectra. The full analysis is shown in Fig. S43 and S44 (ESI†). Energy values are given in electron volts relative to the vacuum level, Evac, and the conduction band energies are determined from the bandgap of 1.25 eV estimated from the PL measurements. (d) The ESR spectra for PEDOT:PSS on quartz, with or without a perovskite capping layer. The g-factor is 2.0030. (e) Schematic illustrating how electron and hole extraction enhanced by surface dipoles induced by EDA2+ and GlyH+ cations at the top and bottom perovskite interfaces, respectively.
