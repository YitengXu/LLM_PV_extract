1. Introduction
Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors, are considered as one of the promising and reliable devices in the field of energy storage system due to their high power density, long lifetime, quick charging capacity and environmental friendliness.1–3 Recently flexible electronic devices have attracted more attention due to their potential applications in portable, wearable and roll up displays. Several kinds of functional devices have been developed such as thin film transistors, photodetectors, energy conversion and storage devices including fuel cells, solar cells, nanogenerators, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. All electronic devices require light, flexible, long-life and cost-effective energy storage systems with high energy and power densities.4 However, the conventional energy storage devices, such as batteries, cannot fulfill the requirements of energy for next generation electronic devices with small size, light weight and flexibility. Therefore supercapacitors have been used in many portable devices and heavy vehicles. Currently supercapacitors are based on carbon materials (graphene, carbon aerogels) for double layer capacitance,5 while composites of carbon and conductive polymers,6 transition metal oxides7 (TMO) and transition metal chalcogenides8 (TMCs) for the combination of double layer capacitance with faradic redox pseudocapacitance which shows considerably higher specific capacitance as compared with carbon based supercapacitors. TMOs and TMCs are especially investigated as promising electrode materials for next generation supercapacitors due to their multiple oxidation states for the generation of pseudocapacitance.9 Therefore, it is a great challenge to enhance the electrochemical performance of pseudocapacitive materials by controlling their structure, morphology, surface area.10 In recent years, TMCs have been reported to be electrochemically active materials and some exhibit higher electrochemical performance than single component oxides and carbon based materials due to their oxidation states and high electrical conductivity such as cupper sulfide (Cu7S4),11 potassium cupper selenium (KCuSe),12 molybdenum sulfide (MoS2),13 nickel sulfide (NiS2),14 cobalt sulfide (Co9S8),15 and tungsten sulfide (WS2).16 TMCs have been considered as reliable and promising alternative electrode materials for next generation pseudocapacitors with several advantages, such as low cost, high conductivity, abundance in nature and environmental friendliness.17
Zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) are two wide band gap multifunctional semiconductors and extensively studied in nanogenerators, sensors, lasers, photodetectors, transistors, photocatalysis and piezotronics due to their good electrical conductivity, electronic properties, stability and wide range of morphological properties.18–20 Wang et al. reported rectangular porous ZnS nanotubes and ZnO/ZnS nanocables for photoluminescence properties.21 Zhang et al. reported hybrid ZnO/ZnS nanoforests as an electrode material for the solid state supercapacitor with an areal capacitance of 217 mF cm−2 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution and 82% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles.22 However, the heterostructure of the ZnO/ZnS nanoforests would have extra barriers for the electron transmission between the interfaces which limits the achievement of a high areal capacitance. Improvement of the charge storage based on the ZnS material with a specific structure and contact directly to the electron collector is still a challenging work.
For real applications of flexible supercapacitors, particular attention should be paid to the mechanical, electrical, electrochemical and interfacial properties of the electrodes. Currently remarkable attention has been paid to the rational design and materials directly growing on a conductive substrate with unique architecture to achieve high electrochemical, electrical, optical and mechanical properties.23 Several types of conductive substrates have been used as current collectors to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors such as carbon fiber papers,4,24 graphene sheets,5,25 nickel foam,23,26 copper foam27 and carbon textiles.11,13,28 Among these substrates carbon textile is considered as an ideal flexible and conductive substrate for directly growing the active material due to its good mechanical strength, flexibility, excellent conductivity and low cost. Generally, the active materials are deposited or coated on carbon textile substrates and then used as electrodes for supercapacitors, which may contain binders, conductive agents and active materials. In this case part of the electroactive sites of the active material could not contact the electrolyte due to the use of binders and conductive agents. The binder will reduce the deep penetration of electrolyte ions into the electrode materials and hinder the performance of the supercapacitors.29 It is essential to design the rational architectures of electrodes for supercapacitors. Recently, an attractive way is to directly grow nanostructures of different binary materials on conductive substrates without the use of binders. The direct growth method has some intrinsic advantages, such as good electrical conductivity, low diffusion resistance, fast electron transportation and deep electrolyte ion penetration.
Herein, we report for the first time the ZnS nanospheres growing directly on flexible carbon textile (ZnS-CT) via a simple and cost effective hydrothermal method with high specific surface area. The ZnS-CT electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 747 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the LiCl aqueous electrolyte. The flexible solid state supercapacitor based on the symmetric ZnS-CT electrodes exhibits a specific capacitance of 540 F g−1 (areal capacitance of 56.25 F cm−2), at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with excellent cycling stability. A high energy density of 51 W h kg−1 at a power density of 205 W kg−1 is achieved. Furthermore, three charged supercapacitors connected in series could light 4 red color light emitting diodes (2.0 V, 15 mA) for 2 min. ZnS nanospheres with large specific surface area combined with flexible carbon textile substrate offer great prospect for energy storage devices with high energy.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Carbon textile (thickness 0.2 mm) was purchased from Shanghai Lishuo Composite Material Technology Company. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of ZnS nanospheres on carbon textile
Carbon textile (CT) was used as a substrate, and ZnS nanospheres assembled on the CT were fabricated via a cost effective and simple hydrothermal method. Typically, first, a piece of CT was cut into desired size and treated with deionized water, acetone and absolute ethanol in sequence under sonication. The well-cleaned CTs were immersed in 0.25 M of zinc acetate solution and heated in air at 300 °C for 20 min, this process was repeated 3 times to form ZnO seeds on CT. Then pieces of prepared CTs stood on the wall of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which contains the reaction solution. The reaction solution is the mixture of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) in a ratio of 1:2, respectively, in 50 mL deionized water. After sealing, the autoclave was put into a preheated electric furnace of 190 °C for 20 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally, and then ZnS assembled CTs and the remaining off-white precipitates in the solution were washed with deionized water and ethanol. The ZnS assembled CTs and the filtered product from the solution were put into oven for 24 hours at 60 °C for drying. The ZnS assembled CTs were calcined at 350 °C for 1 h for the final fabrication of supercapacitor devices. The optical photographs of bare, ZnS assembled CTs before and after annealing are shown in Fig. S1† and the schematic diagram of the fabrication process of ZnS assembled carbon textile by the annealing process is shown in Fig. S2.†
2.3. Fabrication of the electrode and full-solid state supercapacitor
To check the pseudocapacitive behavior, the electrochemical performance of ZnS nanosphere assembled carbon textiles (ZnS-CT) is first characterized in a three-electrode system with the 6 M LiCl aqueous electrolyte. The ZnS-CT with a working area of 2 × 2 cm−2 is used as a working electrode, platinum foil as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. The mass of the active material on the CT is about 0.20 mg cm−2. Further we fabricate the symmetric supercapacitors based on the ZnS-CTs. Positive and negative electrodes were the same of ZnS-CT with equal mass density and dimension (4.8 × 2 cm2). The ZnS mass loading density on the CT is approximately 1.22 mg cm−2 carefully weighed by using an electronic balance. The flexible supercapacitors were assembled with two pieces of electrodes face-to-face separated by a solid state electrolyte (LiCl–PVA gel) and a separator (Whatman 8 μm filter paper). After being solidified at room temperature for 24 h, the prepared supercapacitor is ready for electrochemical testing.
2.4. Characterization and electrochemical measurements
The chemical composition and crystal structure of the prepared ZnS were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (PANalyticalX'Pert Powder with Cu Kα radiation). The morphology of the prepared sample was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI Nova 400 FEG-SEM). The specific surface area was measured by the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method with a Quadrasorb 2MP system and the pore size distribution was obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method with a Quantachrome Instrument (version 5.12). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at 0.2 V amplitude in the frequency range of 0.01–100 kHz at open circuit potential.
3. Results and discussion
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern for the synthesized ZnS nanospheres is illustrated in Fig. 1. To avoid the intense peaks of carbon textile, we performed the XRD analysis of the powder sample without carbon textile. All diffraction peaks could be easily indexed to the standard PDF No: 05-0566 with a cubic structure. No impurities or residues have been detected, indicating the high purity of the synthesized product. The intense and sharp diffraction peaks confirm that the product is highly crystalline in nature.

The microstructure and morphology of the bare CT and ZnS-CT are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A demonstrates the SEM image of the bare CT in which the intercrossed carbon fibers make the 3D porous structure. Fig. 2B shows the low resolution SEM image of the ZnS-CT, which indicates that the solid ZnS spheres are uniformly growing on the fibers of carbon textile. The inset of Fig. 2B shows the photograph of the ZnS-CT and reveals the coverage of ZnS. Fig. 2C clearly shows the ZnS nanospheres on a single fiber of carbon textile with high density and an average diameter of 300–600 nm, which is further confirmed by the high resolution SEM image shown in Fig. 2D. As the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor depends on the morphology of the electrode material, the highly exposed active surface area of the ZnS spheres in the electrolyte can provide easy and fast transportation of electrolyte ions which would lead to the excellent electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor.

The specific surface area and porosity of the prepared ZnS spheres are investigated by N2 adsorption and desorption measurements. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of ZnS nanospheres was calculated to be 28.5 m2 g−1. The pore size was calculated by N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and is shown in Fig. S3(A).† A distinct hysteresis loop is observed which represents the typical type IV sorption behavior and indicates the existence of both nanopores and mesopores in the structure of the material. The average pore diameter of ZnS spheres is in the nanoporous region. The maximum pore size of the sample is mostly in the range of 10–30 nm, as shown in Fig. S3(B).† The linear increase in N2 absorption in the low pressure range (P/P0, 0.0–0.5) indicates the monolayer gas adsorption inside the pores. The sharp increase in N2 in the adsorption curve in the high pressure range (P/P0, 0.7–1.0) is due to the presence of interlayer spaces. Such a porous structure is considered as better energy storage due to the high surface area and multi channels for ion diffusion since electron transportation and ion diffusion are two key factors for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. Therefore the ZnS-CT supercapacitor may achieve the excellent performance due to its short ion diffusion and fast electron transportation from the 3D architecture of carbon textile assembled with ZnS spheres.
On the basis of above physical characterization, it is expected that the ZnS spheres assembled flexible carbon textile would have good electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor. First we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements in a 6 M LiCl aqueous solution in three electrode systems at room temperature. The CV curves for the ZnS-CT electrode at different scan rates from 5 to 75 mV s−1 in the potential window of −0.6 to 0.6 V are shown in Fig. S4(A).† The specific capacitances are 747, 593.5, 431.8, 335 and 253.6 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75 mV s−1 respectively in the 6 M LiCl liquid electrolyte and are shown in Fig. S4(B).† The GDC curves for the ZnS-CT electrode at different current densities in the potential window of 0 to 0.5 V are shown in Fig. S4(C).† The charging and discharging profile indicates good capacitive characteristics and they are in agreement with CV curves. The CV and GDC results are similar to the MnO2 (ref. 30) pseudocapacitive material. The good electrochemical performance of the electrode is further confirmed from EIS spectra in Fig. S4(D).† The ZnS-CT electrode has a small internal resistance of 1.66 Ω. All the above-mentioned results of a single electrode demonstrate the pseudocapacitive features of ZnS spheres, making them a promising material for energy storage applications.
Secondly, a symmetric supercapacitor based on ZnS-CTs was fabricated and the electrochemical performance was measured. Fig. 3A and B show the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor at different scan rates ranging from 5 to 300 mV s−1 in a potential window of −0.8 to 0.8 V. The CV curves are close to the ideal rectangular shape indicating excellent capacitive behavior and they display a similar behavior without any redox peaks, indicating that the ZnS-CT supercapacitor is charged and discharged at a pseudo-constant rate over the entire voltammetric cycles.31,32 The CV curve for the bare CT based supercapacitor at 50 mV s−1 is also illustrated for comparison, demonstrating a negligible capacitive contribution, as shown in Fig. S5(A).† The CV curves are almost symmetric on voltage reversal from 0 to −0.8 V and from 0 to 0.8 V, as shown in Fig. 3C. The shape of the CV curve remains to be rectangular even at a high scan rate of 300 mV s−1 suggesting ideal electrochemical capacitive behavior. The specific capacitance C calculated from CV curves (detailed calculation in the ESI†) gives the highest specific capacitance of 540 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 305 F g−1 at a scan rate of 75 mV s−1. The highest areal capacitance of 56.25 F cm−2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 15.62 F cm−2 at a high scan rate of 250 mV s−1 are achieved. The peak current density is directly proportional to the square root of the scan rate, as shown in Fig. S5(B),† which demonstrates fast electron transmission. The large specific capacitance is attributed to the highly exposed active surface area of the ZnS spheres to the electrolyte, which provides easy and fast transportation of Li+ ions, as well as good contact of the ZnS spheres on the carbon textile which leads to the fast electron transmission to the electrode. The decrease in capacitance at higher scan rates is due to the less diffusion of electrolyte ions (Li+) into the interior surface of the active material of the electrode.33

(A and B) CV curves at different scan rates ranging from 5 to 300 mV s−1 in the potential window of −0.8 to 0.8 V, (C) CV curves at different scan rates ranging from 25 to 150 mV s−1 in the potential window of 0 to 0.8 V, (D) specific capacitance as a function of scan rate, (E) charging–discharging curves taken at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mA cm−2 in the potential window of 0 to 1 V, and (F) Nyquist plot of impedance from 0.01 to 100 kHz, inset shows the corresponding equivalent electrical circuit. 
Rate capability is an important factor in the evaluation of the performance of the supercapacitor. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mA cm−2 in the potential window of 0 to 1.0 V are shown in Fig. 3E. All GCD curves have symmetrical and almost linear profiles suggesting high coulombic efficiency and good capacitive behavior. There is an existence of a small potential decrease (IR drop) of about 0.012 V at the beginning of the discharge cycle and it is also observed that the IR drop increases with the increase in current density. The IR drop as a function of current density is shown in Fig. S6,† revealing that the electrode material has a small ohmic resistance. At a high current of 0.7 mA cm−2 the IR drop is only 0.11 V which demonstrates good conductivity of the carbon textile and a smaller internal resistance of the electrolyte. The electrode material with good electrical conductivity and high specific surface area exhibits excellent capacitive behavior.
For deeper understanding of the electrochemical performance, EIS is performed and the results are presented in Fig. 3F. The measured EIS spectra are analyzed using Nyquist plots and the ZSimWin software simulation method based on the equivalent electrical circuit, which is also shown in the inset of Fig. 3F. The EIS spectra have a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region. The straight line nearly parallels the imaginary axis indicating good capacitive behavior. In the high frequency part the intersection of the curve with the real axis demonstrates the resistance of the electrochemical system (Rs ∼ 3.37 Ω, which includes the ionic resistance, contact resistance of the electrode–electrolyte and the inherent resistance of the material) and the diameter of the semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct ∼ 4.8 Ω). The smaller values of Rs and Rct are indication of good electrical conductivity and electroactivity of the electrode material.11,29

Fig. 4A shows the CV curves of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor at a constant scan rate of 75 mV s−1 in different operation potential windows. The CV curves attain the same rectangular shape indicating good stability of the supercapacitor. With an increase in the operation potential window a sharp increase in current is observed at higher potentials (1.5–1.6 V), demonstrating good capacitive behavior, as shown in Fig. 4B. The shape of the CV curves does not significantly change in the higher voltage window of 1.6 V indicating excellent reversibility of the supercapacitor at a constant scan rate of 75 mV s−1. The GDC curves of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor in different operation voltage windows ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 V at a constant discharge current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4C. The charging curves of the supercapacitor follows the same path up to even at a high voltage of 1.2 V, demonstrating the stable charging–discharging profile and good capacitance characteristics of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor at high operating voltage.

For actual applications, flexible, thin, light weight and easily portable electronic devices are highly desired. The ZnS-CT supercapacitor is light weight, thin (0.85 g as a whole device including electrodes, electrolyte and separator, thickness 1.13 mm) and highly flexible and can be twisted at any angle without damaging its physical shape and performance, as shown in Fig. 5A. To evaluate its potential applications as a flexible energy storage device the electrochemical performance was checked under various bending conditions. The CV and GDC curves of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor twisted at different angles (flat, 45°, 90°, and 180°) are shown in Fig. 5B and C, respectively, demonstrating no apparent change. These results indicate that the fabricated device is highly flexible.

(A) CV curves before and after 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, (B) charging–discharging curves before and after 5000 cycles taken at a current density of 0.8 mA cm−2, and (C) EIS spectra before and after 5000 charging discharging cycles. 
Life span is a very important factor for supercapacitors. The CV, GDC and EIS before and after long term (5000 cycles) are shown in Fig. 6. The results demonstrate that there is no significant loss in the performance of the supercapacitor. From the EIS test, the small increase in the Rs (4.3 Ω, increase ∼0.93 Ω) might be due to the delamination of the active material after long-term running. Thus, the ZnS-CT supercapacitor shows high electrochemical stability and rate capability for long cycle life applications.
The long-term cycling performance (number of cycles vs. capacitance retention) of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor is shown in Fig. 7A. It is observed that the specific capacitance slightly decreases until first 3000 cycles and then increases and attains 94.6% of its initial value at the end of 5000 cycles at a constant current density of 0.8 mA cm−2. The inset of Fig. 7A presents the charge–discharge process for the ZnS-CT supercapacitor, demonstrating excellent stability due to the high specific surface area of the ZnS spheres and good electrical conductivity between the spheres and CT.

The energy and power densities are calculated respectively (ESI†). The Ragone plot of the calculated specific energy and specific power at different current densities is shown in Fig. 7B. The ZnS-CT symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 51 W h kg−1 at a power density of 205 W kg−1 and even at a high power density of 822 W kg−1 the supercapacitor have an energy density of 22.66 W h kg−1, much superior to TMO and TMC based symmetric supercapacitors. The detailed comparison of the current work with the previous literature is presented in Table 1.

The high energy and power densities of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor are attributed to the following factors: (1) the electron transportation is significantly enhanced by the direct growth of active materials on conductive carbon textile. (2) The 3D nano-micro spheres provide porous channels for deeper penetration of electrolyte ions and enhance the specific capacitance. (3) The low internal resistance of the ZnS-CT electrodes provides a high charge transfer rate between the active material and electrolyte (which has only a slight increase (0.93 Ω) in internal resistance after 5000 cycles). (4) Direct growth architectures on conductive substrates ensure the good physical adhesion, electrical conductivity and stability of the active material. (5) The active materials growing directly on a conductive carbon textile also avoids the use of conductive agents and polymer binders which may increase the resistance of the materials. These features result in the high electrochemical performance of the ZnS-CT supercapacitor.
For practical applications, three supercapacitors in series can be easily charged up to 3 V, as shown in Fig. 8A. Three charged supercapacitors in series can light 4 red color LEDs (2.0 V, 15 mA) for 2 min. The optical photograph of lighted LEDs is shown in Fig. 8B demonstrating its capability as a good storage device.

4. Conclusions
An easy and cost effective method for the fabrication of ZnS nanospheres on conductive carbon textile for electrodes of a high performance solid state flexible supercapacitor is reported. The fabricated ZnS-CT supercapacitor shows excellent electrochemical performance along with light weight and good flexibility. The ZnS-CT supercapacitor demonstrates good capacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 540 F g−1 and an areal capacitance of 56.25 F cm−2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with good rate capability and excellent cycling stability (94.6% retention of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles). A high energy density of 51 W h kg−1 at a power density of 205 W kg−1 is achieved. These results suggest that the ZnS-spheres growing directly on a carbon textile are promising materials for supercapacitor applications.
