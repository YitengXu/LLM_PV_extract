    , Accepted 3rd October 2017First published on 4th October 2017AbstractOleylamine-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) has a shallower energy level of conduction band (ECB) and a deeper energy level of the valence band (EVB) as compared to common hole extraction layer (HEL) materials, which make the electron block layer (EBL). Photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and current density–voltage (J–V) curves with a large reverse bias voltage range obtained under dark conditions are used to determine whether GO layers play important roles in blocking the electron transport to the MoO3/Ag composite anode and prevent MoO3 diffusion into a photoactive layer under light illumination. Moreover, GO inserted between a photoactive layer and an HEL enhances charge carrier transport and collection and avoids the monomolecular recombination between the photoactive layer and HEL. Photovoltaic parameters and photostability measurements of inverted and forward PSCs have shown that upon introduction of GO, the performance and photostability of PSCs are improved. On adding GO to PSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases approximately 5% and 4% and reduces the decay ratio to approximately 50% and 65% of the initial value for the inverted and forward PSCs, respectively.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most attractive photovoltaic technologies; they have received significant interest as a way to address global warming by reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.1,2 The 13% barrier of PSCs has been broken in 2017 by Jianhui Hou's group, who employed tandem PSCs and a fullerene-free acceptor material.3 The device geometry of a typical laboratory-scale PSC is composed of a transparent ITO anode, a hole-extracting layer (HEL)-poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS), a photoactive layer, and a low work function metal cathode (Ca/Al). PEDOT:PSS on the top of ITO is unstable because PEDOT:PSS can corrode the ITO surface and thus degrade the performance of the PSCs. Moreover, the Ca/Al cathode has poor long-term stability.4–6 To circumvent these challenges, an inverted device architecture was developed, in which a high-work-function Ag electrode was selected to replace the Al electrode. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) (VOX, NiOX, MoO3, and WO3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) have also been used as alternative hole extracting layers (HEL) and electron extracting layers (EEL) instead of PEDOT:PSS and Ca, respectively.7–9
Fullerene-free acceptors, as an alternative to fullerene acceptors, have attracted extensive attention in recent years since they have significant advantages such as broad absorption, tunable energy level, and low-cost production, which are beneficial for achieving high short-circuit current density (JSC) and high open-circuit voltage (VOC).10–12 The Jianhui group reported that fullerene-free acceptor single-junction PSCs and tandem PSCs all had PCE values over 13%.3,13 To fabricate highly efficient and stable PSCs, interface engineering for effective charge collection and transport plays a critical role. Due to the elimination of PEDOT:PSS and Ca layers, the photostability of inverted PCSs can be effectively improved.14–16 TMOs enable good energy level alignment between the electrode and a wide variety of organic molecules; this reduces the contact resistance and correspondingly enhances the photovoltaic performance of devices.17,18 However, when TMOs are used as HEL materials, which are n-type semiconductors in nature, the energy levels are slightly higher than LUMO of the photoactive layer.19 Due to quantum effects of the semiconductor, a number of electrons will transfer from the LUMO of the photoactive layer to the conduction band of TMO and recombine with holes at the interface of the HEL/anode.20,21 Therefore, leakage current will compromise the photovoltaic performance for solution-processed inverted PSCs.22,23 Then, penetration of a TMO molecule into the underlying photoactive layer under light illumination causes defects that decrease the PCE and device stability.24,25
Herein, we have fabricated inverted and forward PSCs using a mixture of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(10,30-di-2-thienyl-50,70-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[10,20-c:40,50-c0]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:20,30-d0]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b0]-dithiophene (ITIC) as a photoactive layer. Then, we inserted oleylamine-functionalized graphene oxide (GO), having a shallower energy level of conduction band (ECB), as the electron-blocking layer (EBL) between the photoactive layer and HEL for inverted PSCs and between PEDOT:PSS and ITO anode for forward PSCs to avoid electron transport from the photoactive layer to the anode. The slight increase in performance suggests that the GO/MoO3 and GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HEL is a promising replacement for single-layer MoO3 layer and single-layer PEDOT:PSS for inverted and forward PSCs, respectively, with high performance and photostability.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
ITIC was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc; PBDB-T was purchased from Luminescence Technology Co; PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P V AI4083) was purchased from HC Starck. The ZnO solution was obtained by sol–gel.26,27 Oleylamine, chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99%), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), and graphite powder were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co, whereas MoO3, Al, and Ag were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co.
GO was prepared by a modified Hummers method.28,29 Oleylamine-functionalized GO was prepared using oleylamine (OLA): 50 mg GO was dispersed in 5 mL oleylamine (OLA) by ultrasonication to generate a well-dispersed solution. After this, 20 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was added to the solution, and the mixture was centrifuged at 14000 rpm to remove free oleylamine (the pellet was further washed with OLA by centrifugation 4 times). The pristine graphene cannot dissolve in an organic solvent and cannot fabricate a GO layer by solution processing. After grafting the amine -functionalized group onto pristine GO, the amine-functionalized rGO could be dispersed in isopropyl alcohol to fabricate a GO layer by processes such as spin-coating and spray-coating.30,31
2.2 Device preparation and characteristics
PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1, wt%) was dissolved in CB with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1 and stirred at 40 °C for 5 hours. About 1.5% [1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)/CB, v/v] DIO was added to the PBDB-T:ITIC solution to obtain better photovoltaic results. ITO substrates were ultrasonicated at 30 °C in an aqueous detergent followed by in isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and deionized water for 30 min each. The substrates were dried under a stream of nitrogen and heated on a hot plate. The ITO glass was treated with UV/ozone for 20 min. The ZnO solution was diluted in 2-methoxyethanol (10 mg mL−1), spin-cast onto pre-cleaned ITO substrates, and baked at 160 °C for 10 min in air to form a 20 nm-thick ZnO layer. After being transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox, the PBDB-T:ITIC solutions were spin-coated onto the ZnO layer and then thermally annealed at 130 °C for 15 min to form PBDB-T:ITIC photoactive layers of thickness ∼100 nm. Then, the isopropyl alcohol solution of GO was spin-cast onto the photoactive layer, and GO layers with various thicknesses were generated by changing the spin-coating speed (corresponding to the thickness of 2 nm, 4 nm, and 6 nm, the spin-coating speed was 3500, 2800, and 2200 rpm). Next, MoO3 powder was evaporated in vacuum, and a 10 nm-thick MoO3 layer was formed. The Ag electrode was vacuum evaporated through a shadow mask to define the photoactive area of the devices (3 × 3 mm2). Inverted structure PSCs were fabricated following the sequence of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/GOs/MoO3/Ag. The forward PSCs were fabricated by the same method as the inverted PSCs. The layer of GO/PEDOT:PSS and photoactive layer were prepared by spin coating and thermal annealing treatment, respectively, and the thickness of PEDOT:PSS was 15 nm. To avoid the oxidation of Ca by oxygen and water in air, the conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) layer was formed as an EEL by spin-coating the PFN solution on the top of photoactive layers to replace Ca,32–34 and the thickness of the PFN layer was 15 nm. The Al electrode was vacuum evaporated through a shadow mask to define the photoactive area of the devices (3 × 3 mm2). Forward structure PSCs were fabricated following the sequence of ITO/GOs/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC/PFN/Al. The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO are obtained from previous research.30 A schematic of the proposed PSCs and the energy level diagram of the device are shown in Fig. S1.† Average photovoltaic parameter values were obtained from ten devices fabricated in parallel. The ten devices were divided into five groups, and each group contained two devices. The J–V characteristics and photostability of PSCs were evaluated in a glove box under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 using an AM 1.5 G solar simulator. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured under short-circuit conditions with illumination through a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110). In order to again confirm the effect of GO as an EBL on the photovoltaic performance of fullerene acceptor-PSCs, the blend layer of PBDB-T and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as a photoactive layer and the same structure PSCs were fabricated. The PSC structure was ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:PC71BM/GO/MoO3/Ag and ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:PC71BM/PFN/Al for inverted PSCs and forward PSCs, respectively.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for depth profile studies was conducted using a commercial spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Theta Probe). The analysis was performed under a pressure of 5 × 10−9 mbar. The analysis source was monochromatized Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV) with a spot size of 400 μm, and a sample current of 1 μA was used for etching with an argon-ion gun with a 3 kV acceleration voltage.
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) devices without GO were fabricated according to the aforementioned procedure, but with different device configurations: Al/PBDB-T:ITIC/Al for electron-only SCLC devices and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC/Au for hole-only SCLC devices. Then, we fabricated electron-only SCLC devices by inserting GO layers of different thicknesses as an EBL between Al and the photoactive layer, and the device configuration was Al/GO/PBDB-T:ITIC/GO/Al. To show that GO cannot hinder hole transport between the photoactive layer and HEL, hole-only SCLC devices with GO layers of different thicknesses inserted into them were fabricated, and the device configuration was ITO/GO/PEODT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC/Au. The dark current of the SCLC devices was measured using an Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC with field-dependent mobility, as described below:35,36  where JD is the current density, μe is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer. In simulations, εr is speculated to be 3, which is a typical value for organic materials. The thickness of the film (L) was measured using a step profiler. The average photovoltaic parameter values were obtained from 5 devices fabricated in parallel.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Influence of GO as an EBL on the performance of the PSC devices

Fig. 1 shows the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO and amine-functionalized rGO. In the FTIR spectra of GOs, the bands at 1730 cm−1 and 1039 cm−1 are assigned to the CO and C–O stretching vibrations of COOH groups, respectively.37 The band at 1620 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of adsorbed water molecules and contributions from skeletal vibrations of unoxidized graphitic domains.38 The broad band ranging from 2900 cm−1 to 3650 cm−1 is assigned to O–H stretching vibrations of the adsorbed water molecules of unfunctionalized GO.39 After amine functionalization of GO, doublet bands at 2858 cm−1 and 2935 cm−1 are observed, which are attributed to the anti-symmetric and symmetric C–H stretching vibrations, respectively, of the –CH2– groups in oleylamine molecules.37 The bands at 1463 cm−1 and 1376 cm−1 are assigned to C–H bending vibrations.38 The band at 1630 cm−1 corresponds to C–N stretching vibration of amide.39 However, the band at 1730 cm−1 nearly disappears; this is attributed to the COOH groups being removed by the oleylamine chemical reaction, and the amine-functionalized GO molecules are successfully synthesized.

Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of fullerene-free inverted PSCs and fullerene-free forward PSCs with (the best GO layer thickness of 4 nm) and without GO as an EBL are shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the corresponding EQE curves of the PSC devices mentioned in Fig. 2a. All the relevant device characteristic parameters as a function of GO layer thickness are summarized in Table 1. In our experiment, GO layers with four different thicknesses (0 nm, 2 nm, 4 nm, and 6 nm) were chosen for PSCs with PBDB-T:ITIC as the photoactive layer based on forward and inverted structure of PSCs under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. We measured the PCE of 8.82% with a VOC of 0.89 V, JSC of 15.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 64.8% for the inverted PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs with 0 nm-thick GOs and a PCE of 8.59% with a VOC of 0.89 V, JSC of 15.1 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.9% for the forward PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs without a GO layer. After inserting GO layers for two kinds of PSCs, the PCE of devices slight increased, and an average PCE value of 9.31% and 8.93% was demonstrated in the inverted and forward PSCs, respectively. Similar to the inverted devices, forward devices with a GO layer of several nanometers of thickness showed competitive performance as compared to those without interlayers. After inserting GO between the photoactive layers and MoO3 layer, the GO layer blocks the electron transport from the photoactive layer to MoO3/Ag composite anode and cannot affect the incident light absorption of the photoactive layer, which favors full enhancement of photovoltaic parameters of the inverted PSCs. Changes in the photovoltaic parameters of forward PSCs are clearly distinct from those of the inverted devices. Despite moderate increases obtained in the VOC and FF values, JSC values are steady as a function of GO layer thickness. Due to JSC values that are closely linked to the incident light intensity and the similar incident light intensity when inserting GO in front of the photoactive layer,40 the JSC values are steady compared with inverted PSCs. After insert GOs between photoactive layer and electrode modified layer, the photovoltaic parameter of inverted PSCs and forward PSCs is shown the similar change ratio, which is attribute to the FF value are main determining by the charge carrier transport and collection ability and charge carrier recombination.41 The maximum VOC is mainly governed by the difference between LUMO of the acceptor and HOMO of the donor;42,43 the two kinds of PSCs show the same VOC value as a function of the GO layer thickness. The integrated JSC values obtained from the EQE spectra for the forward PSCs without and with GO as an EBL are 14.5 mA cm−2 and 14.6 mA cm−2, and for the inverted PSCs without and with GO as an EBL, these values are 14.6 mA cm−2 and 14.7 mA cm−2, respectively. The JSC value is measured under simulated AM 1.5 G light as a standard source and calculated by the EQE curve; the difference between the two values is less than 5%. The EQE results agree with the higher JSC values of the abovementioned PSCs.

To further confirm the effect of GO as an EBL on the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-acceptor PSCs, the same structure of PSCs based on the blend layer of PBDB-T and PC71BM as a photoactive layer was fabricated. The J–V curves of fullerene-acceptor inverted PSCs and fullerene-acceptor forward PSCs with (the best GO layer thickness of 4 nm) and without GO as an EBL are shown in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2d shows the corresponding EQE curves of the PSC devices mentioned in Fig. 2c. The photovoltaic parameters of the PSC devices show a similar change trend to those of the fullerene-free PSCs. The VOC value became stable, the JSC value slightly increased, and the FF value was significantly enhanced upon inserting GOs. The EQE results agree with the higher JSC values of the abovementioned PSCs.
As observed in Table 1, the improved device performance should be responsible for increased shunt resistances (RSH) and decreased series resistances (RS). RS and RSH of devices are significantly optimized after inserting the GO layers; this is favorable for effective exciton diffusion and dissociation.44,45 As shown in Fig. S1,† the deeper energy level of conduction band (ECB) of MoO3 and ELUMO of PEDOT:PSS are slightly higher than that of the ELUMO of PBDB-T and ITIC; this does not favor the block electron hopping, and electron–hole recombination may occur at the interface between the photoactive layer and electron-modified layer for non-GO devices. However, when the GO layer is inserted, probable electron–hole recombination can be effectively restrained by blocking electron transfer to the anode due to the high work function (WF) of GO.46,47 Moreover, increased RSH and reduced RS are possible evidence that GO is an effective electron-blocking interlayer for reducing reverse leakage current and the probability of electron–hole recombination at the interface.48–50 Moreover, the RSH and RS values of fullerene-acceptor inverted PSCs and fullerene-acceptor forward PSCs show the same change trend as those of the fullerene-free PSCs. RSH and RS values of fullerene-acceptor PSCs and fullerene-free PSCs jointly confirm that GO plays a vital role of blocking electron transport and decreases the probability of electron–hole recombination at the interface of photoactive layer/GOs.
3.2 Influence of GO as an EBL on the semiconductor performance at a big bias voltage and under dark conditions
After oxidation and oleylamine-functionalization of graphene, the graphene surface contains many amino groups and oxygen atoms, which have a strong effect on the WF of the GO layer.51 The WF of GO layer plays an important role in charge carrier collection and transport. From the UPS curve (as shown in Fig. 3a), Ecutoff is determined by linear extrapolation to zero at the yield of secondary electrons (left panels), and Eonset is the onset relative to the Femi level of Au (right panels). The energy level of the valence band (EVB) is determined using EVB = hv − (Ecutoff − Eonset).52 The hv value is defined by the incident photon energy (21.2 eV) of He I. The energy level of the conduction band (ECB) can then be determined by adding the optical band gap: ECB = EVB − optical band gap.53
 Fig. 3  (a) UPS curve for ITO/GO and GO/MoO3/Ag composite anode. (b) J–V characteristics of GO layers of different thicknesses as the EBL. (c) J–V curves of free GO- and GO-based inverted PSCs under dark conditions. 
The EVB values of the GO/ITO and GO/MoO3/Ag composite thin films were 4.55 eV and 4.75 eV, respectively. The ECB value of GO/ITO and GO/MoO3/Ag was 1.6 eV and 1.8 eV, respectively. This deeper EVB makes GO more matched with EHOMO of donor and does not hinder hole transport and collection at the interface of the photoactive layer and HEL. Simultaneously, the shallower ECB value as compared to that of the ITIC molecule and PBDB-T molecule makes GO more suitable as the EBL and blocks electron transport between the photoactive layer and anode. Fig. S1† displays the energy levels of inverted and forward PSCs with and without GO as an EBL. When light irradiates the photoactive layer of the PSCs through the ITO transparent electrode, the photogenerated excitons diffuse towards and dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface into electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor material; these electrons then transport from the LUMO of the acceptor to the cathode.54 There is a slight potential barrier between the LUMO of PBDB-T and HEL/anode that cannot obviously hinder electron hopping from the LUMO of PBDB-T to the HEL/ITO anode. After inserting GO between the photoactive layer and anode, the shallow ECB of GO/MoO3/Ag and GO/ITO composite anode as compared to those of the anode without GO is higher than the LUMO of the PBDB-T molecule, which blocks electron hopping between LUMO of PBDB-T and HEL/anode and avoids electron–hole recombination at the HEL/anode interface.55
Due to the higher photovoltaic performance and better photostability of the inverted structure PSCs as compared to those of the forward structure PSCs, the former can replace the latter and are used as the research sample in subsequent study. To further explore the effects of GO on device performance, reverse leakage current of devices as a function of GO thickness is investigated. Fig. 3b shows the J–V curves of the devices based on PBDB-T:ITIC as the photoactive layer with a bias range from −2 to 1 V. Specifically, the leakage current phenomenon is slightly within the forward bias region, but is more clearly within the reverse bias region in devices lacking GO. However, after inserting GO as an EBL, the reverse leakage current of devices is decreased with an increase in the thickness of GO layer. Thus, upon inserting a GO interlayer, the leakage current behavior is efficiently suppressed.
From Fig. 3c, the dark current of inverted PSCs with and without GO was measured. Fig. 3c shows an obvious variation in the dark current for the fullerene-free inverted PSCs with GO as the EBL-based PSCs, which is exhibited as a lower dark current in the reverse bias voltage range compared to EBL-based devices without GO and is attributed to the decreased leakage current in PSCs after inserting GO between the photoactive layer and MoO3 layer. The leakage current in PSCs can be considered as an undesirable current that is injected from the electrodes prior to voltage turn-on.56 Lower leakage currents indicate that the GO interlayer efficiently blocks electron hopping from LUMO of the donor and acceptor to the Ag electrode; this results in lower RS and higher RSH and FF values.57,58 The current ratio under the forward bias region 1 V and reverse bias region −1 V was calculated based on the J–V curves. For devices without GO, the current ratio is 1.46 × 102. After inserting GO into the PSCs, the current ratio is 5.41 × 102. Higher current ratios for the GO EBL devices can result from higher injection current at the forward bias voltage and lower leakage current at the reverse bias voltage.59 The leakage current flows in a opposite direction to photocurrent, which, therefore, reduces JSC and FF. The J–V curve under a large bias voltage and dark conditions jointly demonstrates that the GO interlayer plays the vital role of suppressing the leakage current and blocking the electron transport.
GO used as an EBL should help obtain better electron block ability, and this is supported by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements and calculated electron mobility (μe) values (as shown are Fig. 4a and Table S1†). The μe value without GO is 1.94 ± 0.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is close to the previously reported value.60 However, after inserting GO between Al and PBDB-T:ITIC layer, the μe value strongly decreases. The μe value of 2 nm GO-based SCLC devices is 1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (the decrease ratio is 35% that of without GO-based SCLC devices), the μe value for devices with 4 nm GO layers is 0.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (the decrease ratio is 55% that of without GO-based SCLC devices), and μe for devices with 6 nm GO layers is 0.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The SCLC measurement further confirms that GO layers have a significant role in blocking electron transport. From Fig. 4b and Table S1,† it can be observed that after inserting GO between the photoactive layer and HEL, hole mobility (μh) is not sensitive to GO layer thickness (corresponding to the GO thickness of 0 nm, 2 nm, and 4 nm, the μh value is 5.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, on inserting a thicker GO layer, μh slight decreases (the μh value is 5.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Thus, GO used as an EBL between the photoactive layer and HEL does not reduce the hole mobility while playing the role of blocking the electron hopping.

3.3 GO prevents penetration of the MoO3 molecule and attenuates the corrosion of the ITO surface by PEDOT:PSS
Apart from effectively decreasing the leakage current phenomenon as an electron-blocking layer, GO can also prevent penetration of the MoO3 molecule into adjacent photoactive layers and attenuate the corrosion of the ITO surface by PEDOT:PSS as a result of its unique planar structure. When illuminated with sunlight, the MoO3 molecule diffuses into the photoactive layer and damages the chemical structures.61,62 Moreover, diffusion of MoO3 into the photoactive layer may cause formation of polymer-chain defects, which act as trapping sites for excitons, greatly reducing the performance and stability of devices.63,64
Herein, we used the PBDB-T:ITIC layer to study the ability of GO to block molecular diffusion. Moreover, two composite layers, i.e. glass/MoO3 (20 nm)/PBDB-T:ITIC (100 nm) and glass/MoO3 (20 nm)/GOs/PBDB-T:ITIC (100 nm), were prepared on quartz glass substrates using identical procedures, and then, molybdenum (Mo) signal intensity was analyzed using XPS at different times of illumination with sunlight. The carbon (C) signal intensity was analyzed by the composite layer of glass/PBDB-T:ITIC (100 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm) and glass/PBDB-T:ITIC (100 nm)/GOs/MoO3 (20 nm). The first measurement of fresh thin films, that is signal intensity without illumination, was set as the normalized zero point. As can be observed in Fig. 5a and b, for the glass/MoO3/PBDB-T:ITIC and glass/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3 sample, the Mo signals originating from PBDB-T:ITIC strongly increased, and the C signals originating from MoO3 did not show obvious changes after illumination. These results indicated that many Mo atoms diffused into the PBDB-T:ITIC thin film, and a small quantity of C atoms diffused into MoO3 thin films during illumination with sunlight. After introducing the GO interlayer between PBDB-T:ITIC and MoO3, Mo signals from PBDB-T:ITIC slowly increased, and C signals from MoO3 did not exhibit substantive changes after illumination. These results suggest that the GO interlayer inserted between PBDB-T:ITIC and MoO3 effectively blocks adjacent MoO3 molecule from entering the photoactive layer in PSCs.

(c) PL spectra of PBDB-T/MoO3 thin films with and without inserted GO layers after 0 days and 6 days of illumination with light. 
Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of the PBDB-T/MoO3 layer with and without GO interlayer were investigated with and without light illumination to illustrate the efficiency of the GO layer in preventing MoO3 molecule diffusion into the PBDB-T thin film. As shown in Fig. 5c, for PBDB-T/GOs/MoO3 and PBDB-T/MoO3 thin films with and without light illumination, similar PL intensity and peak location were obtained. However, after 6 days of illumination, the PL intensity of the PBDB-T/GOs/MoO3 layer only exhibited a slight decrease (lower than 10%) as compared to that of the sample without light illumination. On the contrary, a sharp decrease (almost approximately 80%) in PL intensity was observed in PBDB-T/MoO3 thin films, suggesting that diffusion occurred at the interface and damaged the π conjugate structure, and caused the formation of polymer-chain defects that acted as trapping sites for excitons and reduced the PL intensity.65,66 This phenomenon is caused by favorable blocking ability of GO to prevent mutual interpenetration between the photoactive layer and MoO3.67,68 Therefore, XPS analyses and PL experiments both confirm that GO interlayers prevent MoO3 molecule from damaging the photoactive layer and avoid MoO3 molecule diffusion into the PBDB-T:ITIC layer. However, the inserted 4 nm thick GO layer cannot completely block mutual diffusion at the interface because of the sheet-like structure of GO.69,70 There is a balance between effective charge carrier transport and block ability because a thicker GO layer can reduce the risk of MoO3 molecule diffusion and electron hopping and can hinder hole transport between the photoactive layer and GO/MoO3/Ag composite electrode. However, thinner GO layers have advantages of higher ability of hole extraction, but they are not conducive to prevent penetration of MoO3 into adjacent photoactive layers as a result of their unique planar structure. Thus, it is important to balance hole extraction and MoO3 molecular penetration as a function of GO thickness, which plays an important role enhancing the performance of GO-based PSCs.
In recent years, many research groups have demonstrated the effectiveness of GO as an HEL in fabricating high-performance organic optoelectronic devices.22,71 We also investigated the influence of GO introduced between ITO and PEDOT:PSS on physical properties of ITO after storage for 5 days. The ITO glass was treated with UV-ozone for 20 min, and then, GO was spin-cast onto the ITO glass and baked at 160 °C for 10 min in air to form 4 nm-thick GO thin films. Then, PEDOT:PSS was spin-cast onto GO thin films and clean ITO glass and then baked at 130 °C for 10 min in air to form 20 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS thin films. After 5 days, PEDOT:PSS on the ITO glass was cleaned with deionized water, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS, conductivity, and transmittance of ITO were measured. Fig. 6a–c and d–f show the XRD and XPS results of ITO with different treatments. Table S2† demonstrates the conductivity and transmittance of three ITO samples. In Fig. 6c, XRD curve of ITO that was spin coated with PEDOT:PSS shows an overall change as compared to that of the fresh ITO (Fig. 4a); this indicates that ITO is corroded by PSS. Fig. 6d demonstrates the XPS curve of fresh ITO. The binding energies of In 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 were 444.6 and 453.2 eV, respectively, which correspond to In2O3. The binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 were 488.7 and 496.3 eV, respectively, which corresponded to SnO2.72,73 After PEDOT:PSS was coated on the ITO glass (Fig. 6f), In ion and Sn ion peak intensities strongly decreased, the C peak was slightly enhanced, and the S peak appeared; this further confirmed that ITO was corroded by PSS. Some of In and Sn ions were dissolved and washed away when PEDOT:PSS was cleaned with deionized water, and a small amount of PEDOT:PSS residues were attached on the ITO surface. Then, the conductivity of ITO spin coated with PEDOT:PSS also decreased as compared to that of ITO. In contrast, the XRD and XPS curves of the GO layers between the ITO glass and PEDOT:PSS layers (Fig. 4b and 3e) were slightly different than those of the fresh ITO glass, which indicated that the ITO surface was protected by the GO layer, avoiding corrosion by PEDOT:PSS. However, after inserting GO between the ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers, the transmittance ratio was slightly enhanced (the transmittance ratio was 79% and 83% corresponding to ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/GOs/PEDOT:PSS, respectively), which was attributed to the lower thickness of PEDOT:PSS of the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite layer (the pristine PEDOT:PSS thickness was 20 nm, and the composite GO/PEDOT:PSS layer consisted of a 4 nm GO and 10 nm PEDOT:PSS layers). The dark blue PEDOT:PSS layer played an important role in hindering incident light transmittance.

For free PEDOT:PSS, conductivity and transmittance were similar to those of ITO. The data of Fig. 6 and Table S2† jointly demonstrate that GO helps protect the ITO surface and reduces the impact of corrosion of the ITO surface by PEDOT:PSS. This further illustrates how GO prevents the PEDOT:PSS layer from corroding ITO, thereby protecting the ITO surface under light illumination.
3.4 Charge carrier dynamic process and photostability with and without insertion of the GO layer
Additionally, we studied charge transport, charge extraction, and charge recombination in PBDB-T:ITIC-based devices with and without GO. Fig. 7 exhibits photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of PSCs to gain more insight into the effect of GO layers on the dynamic process in PSCs. The incorporation of different interlayers could influence charge carrier transport and collection efficiency under short-circuit condition. Jph and Veff are expressed as follows:74,75  where JL and JD are current density in the presence of a standard solar simulated light source and in the dark, respectively; V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. When Jph value is saturated at high Veff (2 V and above), the efficient photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and very efficiently collected by individual electrodes at a sufficiently high electric field, with little geminate or bimolecular recombination for PSCs.76Jph value under the short-circuit condition of PSCs is 15.4 mA cm−2 (with GO), and the corresponding Jsat value is 16.7 mA cm−2 at the Veff of 2 V. However, for the PSCs without GO, the Jph values under the short-circuit condition of PSCs is 15.3 mA cm−2 (without GOs) and shows a stronger field dependence across a large bias range. The corresponding Jsat value is not fully saturated at Veff of 2 V and is 17.1 mA cm−2 at the same Veff. This suggests a significant geminate and/or bimolecular recombination and/or less efficient interfacial contact, thus a lower FF.77 The ratio Jph/Jsat can be used to judge overall exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency. The better charge carrier transport and charge carrier collection of PSCs can be further confirmed from the Jph/Jsat values obtained under the short-circuit condition. The corresponding exciton dissociation probability (defined as the ratio of Jph to Jsat) can be determined under the short-circuit condition. The corresponding Jph/Jsat values under the short-circuit condition are 92.1%, and 89.5% for with and without GO PSCs, respectively. Detailed Jph, Jsat, and Jph/Jsat values are calculated, as listed in Table 2. As Jph/Jsat is the charge collection efficiency, a decreased Jph/Jsat may indicate that charge carrier recombination between the photoactive layer and electrode-modified layer begins to dominate; this usually leads to lower JSC and FF. The trend of Jph/Jsat is consistent with the change in JSC and FF for all PSCs. The higher Jph/Jsat value of PSCs with GO as an EBL indicates efficient charge carrier transport and collection and avoidance of the electron–hole pair recombination at the interface of photoactive layer and electrode. Moreover, under maximal power output conditions (the voltage is 0.725 V and 0.75 V corresponding to PSCs without and with GO, respectively), Jph/Jsat is 61.2% and 54.5% for PSCs with and without GO, respectively; this also indicates higher charge carrier transport and collection efficiency and less bimolecular recombination under the maximal power output conditions after inserting GO layer into PSCs. In addition, PSCs with GO have larger RSH and smaller RS values than the PSCs without GO; this indicates a better interface contact and avoidance of charge carrier recombination in the PSCs with the GO layer. Thus, after inserting GO layer into PSCs, the higher Jph/Jsat value under the maximal power output conditions and saturated conditions (Veff is 2 V) jointly confirm that efficient charge carrier transport and collection and weakened charge carrier recombination.

To further research the kinetics of charge carrier recombination with and without GO, J–V characteristics as a function of light intensity are measured (the range of light intensity is from 3 to 100 mW cm−2). The light intensity of solar simulator (from 100 mW cm−2 to 3 mW cm−2) was adjusted, followed by 15 minutes of waiting, so that the light intensity and AM 1.5 G spectrum could achieve stability. The Fig. S2a† and Fig. 3c show the J–V characteristics curves of PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs with and without GO as an EBL, respectively. Fig. S2b† and Fig. 3d show the normalized photocurrent density versus the applied voltage at different light intensities. The current density flowing through the PSCs is given by the sum of dark current density (Jdark) and photocurrent density (Jphoto), as shown below:41J(I,V) = Jphoto(I,V) + Jdark(V)
The photocurrent density can be defined as follows:Jphoto(I,V) = edG(I)PC(I,V)where G(I) is the generation rate of the bound electron–hole pairs per unit volume, d is the distance between ITO and Ag cathode, and PC(I,V) is the charge collection probability. In Fig. S2a† and Fig. 2c, it can be seen that the current density becomes saturated as a function of applied voltage of around −0.5 V reverse bias. Under the reversed bias voltage conditions (−0.5 V), the reverse saturation current was such that G(I) = Jphoto (V = −0.5 V). Under a sufficiently large internal field, most charge carriers can be swept out and collected by respective electrodes. Assume PC(I,V) ≈ 1, which is following the below the equations :78  
This confirms that the internal quantum efficiency approaches 100% without any charge carrier recombination such that PC is known to approach unity at short circuit.41,79
Normalized photocurrent density versus applied voltage curve (Fig. S2b† and Fig. 2d) shows the charge collection probability as a function of applied voltage. Fig. S2b† and Fig. 2d show a set of normalized photocurrent data under simulated solar illumination covering a light intensity range from 100 mW cm−2 to 3 mW cm−2 for PSCs with and without GO, respectively. The normalized photocurrent data versus universal applied voltage is in the range from −0.5 to the maximum power point (MPP) (the MPP is around the applied voltage of 0.8 V). Notably, most of the charge generated under the short-circuit conditions (up to 90%) is swept out of the device prior to recombination and collected as current in the external circuit. Thus, under the short-circuit condition, charge carriers are efficiently swept out, which is not ideal for the study of charge carrier recombination. However, unders the reverse bias condition and open-circuit condition, nearly 100% charge carrier recombination occurs, which is ideal for the study of charge carrier recombination. Therefore, as observed from Fig. S2b† and Fig. 2d, the first-order recombination intimately relies on all the data in the range of applied voltage from −0.5 to the maximum power point.41 For all PSCs, monomolecular recombination dominates for the applied voltage range from −0.5 V to near the maximum power point. Even at the maximum power point, the probability of recombination remains independent of intensity. However, when the applied voltage is over the maximum power point, the charge collection probability becomes dependent on the incident light intensity. As observed from Fig. S3b† and Fig. 3d, under the open-circuit condition, this variation with light intensity arises from a change in charge carrier recombination kinetics with applied voltage, evolving from monomolecular recombination for applied voltage up to the maximum power point to bimolecular recombination.41
However, the J–V characteristics and normalized photocurrents of PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs with and without GO as an EBL indicate that charge collection probability is strongly dependent on light intensity at a given applied voltage, as displayed in Fig. S2b† and Fig. 2d. These results imply that loss in efficiency in the PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs with GO as an EBL is controlled by bimolecular recombination rather than monomolecular recombination.78 However, for PSCs without GO as an EBL, monomolecular recombination dominates. Moreover, for PSCs without GO, at the same incident light intensity, the applied voltage is higher than that for the GO-based PS. This implies that the same normalized photocurrent density at the same incident light intensity will require higher applied voltage for PSCs without GO.
Under the short-circuit condition, photogenerated charge carriers can be efficiently swept out from the photoactive layers prior to recombination. This recombination can be assessed by power-law dependence of JSC on light illumination intensity and is expressed as follows:JSC ∝ Iαwhere I is light illumination intensity and α is exponential factor.80,81 Under the open-circuit condition where most photogenerated charge carriers will be recombined in photoactive layers, the recombination mechanism can be evaluated by the following formula:41  where k is Boltzmann's constant, q is elementary charge, and T is temperature in Kelvin. The JSC and VOC dependence on light intensity is used to evaluate the photogenerated charge carrier recombination loss. The dependence of JSC on light intensity is displayed in Fig. 8a, in which JSC and VOC of the PSCs with and without GOs are plotted against light intensity on a logarithmic scale. The data are fitted according to a power law (the solid line with a corresponding color). In general, the exponential factor α = 1 is indicative of efficient sweep out of carriers prior to recombination.82,83 From Fig. 8a, we determine α for PSCs without and with GO as an EBL to be 0.921 and 0.934, respectively. The closer value to unity (α is 0.934) in the latter implies that effective photogenerated charge carrier is swept out from the photoactive layers prior to recombination and collected by the electrode. This is in agreement with the analysis of the Jph/Jsat value. The α value (α is 0.921) deviating from unity in devices without GO suggests that charge carrier recombination between the photoactive layer and electrode is more important in the devices.The dependence of VOC on light intensity is displayed in Fig. 8b. Under the open-circuit condition, bimolecular recombination is the sole loss mechanism, and most photogenerated charge carriers are recombined in the photoactive layers; the slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of light intensity gives kT/q. If the n value deviates from unity, trap-induced charge carrier recombination should be involved in the photoactive layers.74 When the slope is greater than kT/q, Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination mechanism is involved, and SRH competes with bimolecular recombination.41,82 From Fig. 8b, the slope yields 1.35kT/q for device without GO layer as an EBL, whereas it is only 1.08kT/q for those with GO layer as an EEL; this implies that SRH recombination (monomolecular recombination) is almost negligible in devices with GO layer as an EEL. However, before inserting the GO layers, monomolecular recombination is dominant between the photoactive layer and electrode.82 There is a similar reason for both JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity of the GOs layer as EBL.

3.5 Photostability of PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs with and without GO
Photostability of the un-encapsulated PBDB-T:ITIC-based PSCs as a function of light illumination time in the glove box under illumination with and without GO as the EBL material was studied. Fig. S3a and S3b† exhibit normalized PCE values for the inverted PSCs and forward PSCs, respectively. The initial PCE values of inverted PSCs are 8.82% for free GO and 9.31% for GO as an EBL. The initial PCE values of forward PSCs are 8.59% for free GO and 8.93% for GO as an EBL. Under continuous illumination for six weeks, all PCE values decrease with light illumination time. Clearly, the normalized PCE values of devices with free GO sharply decline within six weeks; especially for forward structure PSCs, the values are approximately 80% and 60% of the initial PCE value based on the inverted and forward structure, respectively. However, after introducing GO, the normalized PCE values only decrease approximately 10% and 17% for the inverted and forward structure PSCs, respectively. Thus, the improved photostability of the inverted and forward PSCs indicates the suppression of MoO3 diffusion into the photoactive layer for the GO/MoO3 device and decrease in PEDOT:PSS layer corrosion of ITO surface for the GO/PEDOT:PSS devices. However, after inserting a GO layer in forward PSCs, there was an obvious decrease in PCE of forward PSCs compared with inverted PSCs, which is attributed to the lower work function of the Al electrode which was easily oxidized by a small amount of oxygen in the glove box to produce aluminium oxide, and the GO layer can't completely prevent the corrosion of PEDOT:PSS on the ITO surface after a long light illumination time. The photostability of inverted PSCs and forward PSCs together show that GO layers have the ability to protect adjacent thin films from physical and chemical destruction.
4. Conclusions
In this study, low FF and RSH and high RS and leakage current of inverted PSCs without GO layer reveal an n-type nature and deeper ECB of the MoO3 layer and the insufficient electron-blocking ability of MoO3 layer. The shallower ECB of GO interlayer enhances the electron-blocking ability of the GO/MoO3 layer and restrains electron–hole recombination at the MoO3/Ag composite anode. The J–V curve obtained under high reverse bias voltage and dark conditions and the SCLC measurement together proved the better capability of electron block ability of the GO layer. The Jph–Veff curve and JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity further confirm effective charge carrier transport and collection and avoidance of the monomolecular recombination between the photoactive layer and HEL via insertion of GO layer between the photoactive layer and HEL. Simultaneously, the GO layer protects adjacent thin films, hinders MoO3 molecular diffusion into the photoactive layer, prevents PEDOT:PSS from corroding the ITO surface under light illumination, and consequently improves device photostability. Combining the advantages of electron blocking and protection of adjacent thin film, the GO/MoO3 layer and GO/PEDOT:PSS layer substantially enhance the PCE and photostability of the inverted and forward PSCs, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of the GO/MoO3 layer and GO/PEDOT:PSS layer for achieving photostable, high-performance inverted and forward PSCs.
