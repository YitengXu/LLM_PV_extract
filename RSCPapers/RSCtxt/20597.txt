    , Accepted 24th October 2020First published on 30th October 2020AbstractIn the present work, a relationship between the pencil-like growth of wurtzite zinc oxide (ZnO) with specific surfaces to support zinc sulfide (ZnS) deposition and its photovoltaic behavior is proposed. The wurtzite ZnO and zinc blende ZnS were explored in the context of the ZnO/ZnS interfaces obtained from zinc acetate (ZA) and zinc nitrate (ZN). A more effective ZnS coating was obtained on polar (101) ZnO surfaces, using ZN precursors, since the growth of planes is electronically and sterically favored because of the accentuated charge polarization. The hexagonal rod shaped ZnO with pencil-like end was examined by scanning electron microscopy, its surface stability was confirmed by density functional theory, and the shape change diagram obtained from the classic Wulff construction demonstrated that the (100) and (101) ZnO planes have increased energetic stability. From photovoltaic measurements we observed improvements in the ZnO/ZnS (ZN) (i) photocurrent density, from 0.88 to 1.03 mA cm−2, corresponding to an increment of 17%; (ii) open-circuit photovoltage, from 0.62 to 0.67 V, equivalent to an increment of 8%; and (iii) photoconversion efficiency, from 0.40 to 0.42%, representing an improvement of 4.7% in the case of the predominant (101) plane growth. On the other hand all ZnO/ZnS systems have the same main absorption bandgap of 3.1 eV. Significantly, this data set demonstrates that better photovoltaic behavior can be achieved in ZnO/ZnS (ZN) through covering and surface growth control, resulting in adequate band alignment.
1 Introduction
Several studies have shown that control of the shape of semiconductor particles is the key to manipulating their electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and optical properties.1,2 The different kinds of exposed facets, which represent different crystallographic indices, can generate different excess of surface energy or energy distribution.3 Therefore, the possibility of modulating specific characteristics can directly contribute to material applications. For this purpose, some strategies are used frequently for structural and morphological changes, such as different synthesis routes,4,5 heat treatments,6 pH control,7 different precursors,8 additives9 or surfactants,10 doping,11 different precursor concentrations,12 and others.
The verification and possible control of the properties based on structural changes allow unlimited applications. In this context, ZnO is an interesting material,13,14 and it has received considerable attention since it has several advantages, such as various methods of synthesis, plenteous reserves on Earth, and the fact that it is environmentally friendly.15 Beyond that, it is a unique material with semiconductor, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties.16 The possible ZnO nanostructures have great potential for applications in several prominent fields, e.g., photocatalysis, optoelectronics, nanopiezotronics, sensors, battery anodes, nanoelectronics, and others.17–22
New applications of ZnO are directly related to the search for methods or procedures to modify the surface and/or shape of the particles, without harming the physical/chemical properties.13,23,24 At the same time, modifications can be employed to improve the desired properties, such as photocatalytic activity. ZnO is an important semiconductor that has exhibited favorable optical, electronic, and surface properties.25 Also, such properties can be easily modified by alterations in the synthesis route.26,27 Several synthesis routes have been used to explore different exposed ZnO surfaces, such as the sol–gel method,27,28 thermal decomposition,29 hydrothermal and solvothermal methods with conventional heating,30,31 microwave-assisted hydrothermal (HAM) methods,32–34 chemical bath deposition (CBD),35 sputtering,36 electron beam evaporation,37 spray pyrolysis,38 and other techniques. The many ways of combining routes, conditions and methods make it possible to obtain ZnO with different shapes such as wires or nanowires,39 rods or nanorods,40 nanoplates,41 flowers,42 tetrapods,43 nanotubes,44 and other types of particle structures.45,46 Abd-Ellah et al.44 reported the specific growth of nanotubes, which can be used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. The type of exposed surfaces in the different shapes is a key point in tuning and optimizing the properties.
Manikandan et al.47 showed the photovoltaic capacity development of Ag grown on ZnO nanoparticles, which have three-dimensional pyramid structures and are applied as photoanodes in DSSCs. These authors reported increased photovoltaic energy for the DSSCs, with light dispersion induced and photo-generated electrons on the plasmonic surface, which is related specifically to the Ag nanoparticles.
Saidani et al. highlight the photocatalytic potential of ZnO, especially when the zinc acetate precursor is used instead of zinc nitrate. In addition, they demonstrated that zinc acetate has a better electrical conductivity than zinc nitrate, as well as a higher methylene blue (MB) degradation capacity.48
In this context, understanding the structural, energetic and electronic characteristics is vital when studying the surface stability of a crystalline system, mainly to verify its ability to anchor itself to another material. For this reason, both theoretical and experimental approaches are important, mainly because the surface region of the nanoparticles is challenging to evaluate experimentally. The role of the computational simulation is to provide a model that best represents the microscopic situation of the experiment, contributing to the comprehension of the system properties.49
In addition to the structural changes, the combination of different materials is an interesting way to explore the property modulation due to the synergistic effects.50 Synergistic properties of ZnO bound to other compounds can be seen in the literature, e.g., Castillejos-López et al.51 have shown that the synergy of the contacts between ZnO planes and PdZn nanostructures improves the chemical properties in hydrogenation processes. Some specific planes become more active and selective in these material systems, which can be used to favor catalytic positions on specific surfaces. The study of the synergism of ZnO with the interfaces of other materials, such as ZnO/ZnS;52,53 ZnO/ZnWO4;54 ZnO/CuO;55 ZnO–TiO2;56 ZnO/ZnX (X = S, Se, Te);57 and ZnO/ZnF2,58 is important in the search for optimized properties for applications such as photocatalysis;52,54,59 anodes for lithium-ion batteries;53 supercapacitors;60 solar cells;61 and gas sensors,55 among other applications. Thus, particle growth on ZnO offers important possibilities to change and tune particular properties.
A variety of theoretical studies based on modifying the surface parameters of ZnO and/or ZnS are being carried out to optimize the structural, electronic, optical and energetic responses of various types of photocatalytic systems.62–64 In the case of photovoltaic systems based on ZnO/ZnS, Saha et al.65 highlight the possibility of improving the photovoltaic response of a ZnO/ZnS system by controlling the core diameter and shell thickness, which are responsible for the variation of the system's bandgap and also for the type II band alignment, modified by a change in the structure. Schrier et al.,66 in a theoretical study on heterostructures related to photovoltaic systems, highlight the importance and the capacity of the ZnO/ZnS system to be used as a photovoltaic device upon reducing the bandgap. This study also stresses that many features of the ZnO/ZnS system can be exploited to further reduce the bandgap, such as the use of piezoelectric effects, alloys and interfacial roughness.
Joicy et al. suggest that ZnS growth on ZnO produces changes in the surface because of ZnS anchoring, which causes improvements in the optical properties of the system. Beyond that, the type II band alignment structure provides emission in the blue region while the UV and green ZnO emissions suffer a decrease in intensity due to the charge transition between the semiconductors.67 In this context, the ZnO/ZnS combination seems to be an excellent choice, since previous work68 has achieved highly efficient photocatalytic activity for this composite. Also, ZnS has several advantages, for example, reduced charge recombination,69 abundance and the fact that it is relatively inexpensive.70
Wang et al.61 performed a theoretical study involving ZnO/TiO2 and N3 where they showed that N3 adsorption can be improved with the introduction of ZnO in the ZnO/TiO2 system. In this sense, the novel behaviour caused by the synergistic effect of the ZnO/TiO2 component transformed the system into an excellent specific structure for DSSCs.
In our study, we seek to show the growth behavior of ZnO crystals from both theoretical and experimental points of view. The theoretical models served as a tool to assist the explanation of the characteristics of the ZnO crystal growth and the ZnS growth on ZnO, utilizing the structure and energy of the selective interface associated with the surface structural features. In this context, it was experimentally inferred that the coating of ZnO with ZnS could be selective. The selective interface associated with the surface structural characteristics may represent a significant advance in the control of the synergistic properties and may be reflected in the photovoltaic behavior of the solar cells.
2 Methodology
2.1 Experimental section
All the reagents were analytical grade purity and were used as received without further purification.

2.1.1 Synthesis of ZnO particles. 
The ZnO compound synthesis was carried out by dissolving 2.6 mmol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) in 45 mL of distilled water and 0.1 mol of NaOH (Synth) in 45 mL of distilled water, both under constant magnetic stirring for 10 min at room temperature. After complete dissolution of the solutes, the Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O was added to the NaOH under constant stirring for another 10 min until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. Then, the resulting homogeneous suspension was placed in a reaction cell and heated in a microwave oven, operating at 2.45 GHz with a power of 800 W, at 403 K for 40 min. The temperature and reaction time were chosen based on previous work by our group.71 After the synthesis process, the precipitate obtained was washed with distilled water several times until the pH reached a neutral value (approximately 7.0). Finally, the material was collected and dried at 353 K for 5 h.


2.1.2 Synthesis of ZnS grown on ZnO. 
The ZnS growth on ZnO was investigated with two samples using zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich) as sources of zinc, which were named ZnO/ZnS (ZA) and ZnO/ZnS (ZN), respectively. Initially, 5 mmol of ZnO obtained in the previous synthesis were dispersed and then added to 25 mL of distilled water in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. After that, a solution of 10 mmol of thiourea (Sigma-Aldrich) in 75 mL of distilled water was prepared separately, and then 5 mmol of zinc acetate was added after complete dissolution. The resulting solution of thiourea and zinc acetate was then added to the ZnO suspension initially dispersed in distilled water and transferred to the microwave reaction cell to be heated at 403 K for 40 min to prepare the first sample denoted by ZnO/ZnS (ZA). After the synthesis, with an approximately neutral pH (7.0), the product was sequentially washed with distilled water and isopropyl alcohol, and dried at 353 K for 5 h to obtain the first sample denoted by ZnO/ZnS (ZA). The process was repeated, replacing zinc acetate (ZA) with zinc nitrate (ZN) to obtain the second sample denoted by ZnO/ZnS (ZN).


2.1.3 Photovoltaic devices. 
For the preparation of single layer ZnO, ZnO/ZnS (ZA) and ZnO/ZnS (ZN) photoanodes, dispersions of 0.25 g of powder, 18 μL of ethylene glycol (Synth) and 15 μL of Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared. Afterwards, ethanol (Synth) was dripped into the solution until the desired consistency similar to a paste was obtained. These pastes were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (Sigma-Aldrich) with a delimited area of 1 cm2 by the doctor blade technique. After the deposition step the substrates were heat treated at 723 K for 30 min and naturally cooled to room temperature, and then sensitized with ruthenium(II) cis-(SCN)2 bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate) (N-3) (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration of 0.3 M in ethanol, for 24 h, at room temperature and without light.
For the blocking layer deposition, the FTO substrates were cleaned by immersion in isopropanol at 353 K. The deposition of the TiO2 layer was performed using the spin-coating technique. We prepared a solution of 5 mL titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration of 0.30 M. Then, the solution was deposited on the FTO substrate by spin-coating in two steps: (i) 1500 rpm for 15 s and (ii) 3000 rpm for 30 s. The layer was left to dry for 10 min at 398 K followed by thermal treatment at 773 K for 30 min. Considering the heterojunctions of TiO2 with ZnO, ZnO/ZnS (ZA) and ZnO/ZnS (ZN), counter electrodes with a layer of platinum deposited by thermal decomposition were used in all assembled cells. The photoanode and counter electrode were connected and sealed by introducing a potassium iodide/triiodide electrolyte. The schematic model is similar to that used in the papers of Lilge et al.72 and Gularte et al.73


2.1.4 Characterization. 
The structural phase and crystallinity level of the samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku diffractometer with Cu-K radiation from 20 to 100° with a 0.02° step width and a scanning rate of 5 s for each point. UV-Vis measurements were performed with a high-resolution Ocean Optics HR2000+ spectrometer, in the range of 300 to 1000 nm. FT-Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker MultiRam spectrometer using a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ge diode as the detector. The 1064 nm excitation line of an air-cooled Nd:YAG laser was applied as the light source. The FT-Raman signal was collected in the backscattered direction, and recorded over a range of 100 to 1700 cm−1 using an operating spectral resolution of 1.0 cm−1, and a laser power output of 100 mW. The morphological properties of the samples were examined using FE-SEM (Zeiss Supra35), operating at 5 kV, and EDX measurements were performed with an Inspect F50 field emission scanning electron microscope, operating at 20 kV. The photovoltaic J–V responses of the DSSCs were measured at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) and 298 K using a solar simulator (SLB-300A – ScienceTech) together with a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 3 – AMETEK Scientific Instruments).

2.2 Theoretical section
The ZnO theoretical models were obtained by quantum mechanical calculations according to periodic density functional theory (DFT)74 implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).75,76 The exchange–correlation energy functional was described by the semilocal formulation proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).77 To solve the Kohn–Sham equations, we employed the projector-augmented-wave pseudo-potentials found in the VASP database.76,78 The plane-wave expansion was truncated at a cut-off energy of 520 eV, and the total energy converged at 10−6 eV for the self-consistent interaction. The Brillouin zone was sampled employing the Monkhorst–Pack k-points method, with a k-mesh of 5 × 5 × 5 for the bulk model and 5 × 5 × 1 for the surface models. As an initial procedure, the optimizations of the lattice parameters and internal coordinates of wurtzite ZnO were performed until the forces on the atoms were <0.01 eV Å−1. The structural parameters of the input data were extracted from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) card no. 180050.79 From the optimized unit cell, the low index (100), (101), and (111) surfaces were modeled.
All possible stoichiometric terminations without reconstruction were tested. A vacuum spacing of 15 Å was introduced to avoid interactions between the slabs. In addition, dipole correction for the long-range dipole interactions between the slabs was performed by introducing a dipole sheet in the middle of the vacuum region in order to result in zero electric field in the vacuum region, as implemented in VASP. In the optimization of the surfaces, the five external-most layers on the top and the bottom side were relaxed (ten in total), while the central layers were frozen in the relaxed bulk positions. The atoms were allowed to relax while keeping fixed the parameters related to the optimized unit cell in the directions perpendicular to the vacuum. The convergence criterion for the atomic coordinates was that the forces experienced by each atom had to be smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. All the slab models had a thickness higher than 20 Å to guarantee the stability of the surfaces which represent 16, 28, and 32 layers of the (100), (101), and (111) surfaces, respectively. This procedure is intended to include the bulk properties in the model and to represent an equilibrium condition. The surface energy (Esurf) values were calculated according to the following equation: (1)where Eslab is the slab model energy, n is the number of molecular units in the model, Ebulk is the bulk energy and A is the surface area.
The shape estimation and the diagram of morphological changes were obtained from a classic Wulff construction. This model provides a simple relationship between the Esurf of a surface plane and its respective distance from the center of the particle.80
3 Results and discussion
The crystallinity of the ZnO, ZnO/ZnS (ZA), and ZnO/ZnS (ZN) samples was initially analyzed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the samples: (a) ZnO; (b) ZnO/ZnS (ZA); and (c) ZnO/ZnS (ZN). 
According to Fig. 1, the ZnO sample crystallizes in the hexagonal phase (zinc wurtzite – ZW) since all peaks could be indexed from the JCPDS card 3-888. The ZnO/ZnS systems were indexed from the same JCPDS card, 3-888, and a small shoulder at 2θ = 27° could be identified with the JCPDS card 65-309, which indicates a small amount of growth of ZnS in the cubic phase (zinc blende – ZB). In the case of the ZnO/ZnS samples, with both ZA and ZN precursors, an additional peak is present in the diffractogram besides the ZnO peaks. This peak is attributed to the (111) plane of the ZnS material in the ZB phase, as reported in the JCPDS card 65-309. After the ZnS is inserted as a shell in the system, it is possible to observe the (111) diffraction plane. The ZnO peaks are narrow, indicating good crystallinity; on the other hand, after the ZnS growth on ZnO, the lack of widening of the peaks may indicate a thin ZnS coating on ZnO.
In the Raman spectra of the samples (Fig. 2a and b), it was possible to identify modes at 333, 383, 407, 437, 555 and 1090 cm−1. The 437 cm−1 vibrational mode is equivalent to the main vibrational mode which is a ZW band, corresponding to the optical phonon E2H81 as observed in Fig. 2. The vibrations at 333 (second-order) and 383 (A1(TO)) cm−1 correspond to transverse vibrations which are also related to the typical modes of the ZW structure. The 407 cm−1 mode is related to the E1T (first process) vibration and completes the set of vibration modes of wurtzite ZnO.82 The mode at approximately 555 cm−1 with weak intensity results from the contribution of the E1 (LO) vibration of ZnO and is attributed to defects in the structure (oxygen vacancies), depending on the orientation and crystallinity of the system and the synthesis method adopted.81,83 Above 1000 cm−1, modes are assigned to overtones or combined bands.83 The lack of the 860 cm−1 mode corroborates the absence of impurities introduced during the material manufacturing process.84 All Raman modes were attenuated after ZnS growth on ZnO, as a result of electromagnetic radiation absorption by ZnS nanoparticles. No ZnS vibrational modes were observed, because the ZnS was not crystalline.

There were no obvious differences in the bandgap values, and the bandgaps of all samples were around 3.1 eV. If we consider that the bandgap practically did not vary, then we can conclude that the synergistic effect mainly acted as a mediator in the formation of ZnS crystals, which would explain the selectivity of the coating as shown in the microscopic images (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  SEM-FEG images with magnification 20.0k× and 100.0k× of (a and b) ZnO, (c and d) ZnO/ZnS (ZA), and (e and f) ZnO/ZnS (ZN) samples. 
The pure ZnO obtained by the microwave-assisted synthesis, as shown in Fig. 3a and b, is stable in hexagonal rod forms with pencil-like ends. Also, it is possible to observe flower-like shapes in some regions as a result of the growth of rods from a common central point. The rods have a typical microstructure composed of a hexagonal-based tapered prism with a diameter between 85 nm and 193 nm, as measured by the high-resolution microscope. The shape of the rod extremities varies from a pencil-like shape, with exposure of the (101) surface, to flattened tips, with stabilization of the (0001) surface. Since the growth appears to originate from the same nucleus, the tips and the body appear to undergo epitaxial growth, where each rod is, in fact, a single crystal, as observed in the literature.81
Regarding the ZnO/ZnS (ZA) compound form, a partial covering of the ZnS compound was observed over the ZnO hexagonal-based tapered prisms (HTPs), as shown in Fig. 3c and d, making the system a “ZnS grown on ZnO” system. Also, the ZnS nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed over all ZnO faces. Thus, it is shown that few ZnS particles are able to adhere to the surface of the ZnO rods. This could be caused by the solvent used, as suggested by Flores (2016).71
In order to ascertain if the partial covering on ZnO is really composed of ZnS, EDX measurements were used to analyze the elemental composition of the ZnO/ZnS (ZA) structures. Thus, the presence of the Zn and S components has been verified in selected regions, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5 for two identified sites. The tables included in Fig. 4 and 5 show the percentages of Zn, S and O at sites 1 and 2, respectively, demonstrating that the particles adhered to the ZnO sticks are actually non-crystalline ZnS. Furthermore, it is noted from the spectra in Fig. 4 and 5 that the signal ratios of the elements are very similar. As confirmed by the tables, it can be said that the ZnS growth is practically homogeneous over ZnO.
 Fig. 4  EDX spectrum of the ZnO/ZnS composite obtained from point 1 (left), shown in conjunction with the MEV-FEG image and the respective percentage levels of Zn, S and O. 
 Fig. 5  EDX spectrum of the ZnO/ZnS composite obtained from point 2 (right), shown in conjunction with the MEV-FEG image and the respective percentage levels of Zn, S and O. 
The best apparent covering was obtained for the ZnO/ZnS (ZA) system, which suggests homogeneous growth of ZnS on the ZnO rod faces. Moreover, this situation is not the best option since from the XRD pattern (Fig. 1) it is possible to observe a lower intensity for the (101) peak when the covering is not concentrated at the tip ((101) plane), and the intensity is smaller for ZnO/ZnS (ZA) than ZnO/ZnS (ZN).
On the other hand, ZnO/ZnS (ZN) presents new behavior concerning ZnS growth. From Fig. 3e and f and more clearly in Fig. 6, it is possible to observe selective covering of the two facets located at the rod extremities. More specifically, ZnS grows preferentially on the (101) and (0001) facets of the ZnO rods. It is already established that different from the (100) surfaces, the (0001) and (101) surfaces are polar. This fact is probably the key point for the growth orientation of ZnS and will be investigated further.85–87

This preferential selective growth over ZnO may create specific conditions that change the optical behavior due to exposure of specific planes, which is also correlated with surface exposure and coverage by ZnS. Thiourea is the vector responsible for the non-crystallinity of ZnS, offering less potential for ZnO coating compared to other sulfur sources, such as thioacetamide (TAA), as suggested by Hu et al. in the case of ZnO/ZnS core–shell nanostructures.88
Theoretical modeling of the ZnO surfaces was also performed to provide a basis for the understanding of the experimental ZnO and ZnS growth. Fig. 7 shows a side view of the (100), (101) and (0001) relaxed stoichiometric surfaces with the cutting conditions based on the lowest energy configurations found for our models.
 Fig. 7  ZnO surface regions of the (100), (101) and (0001) slab models. 
The structural schemes shown in Fig. 7 allow us to obtain valuable information about each cutting plane. As previously mentioned, the (100) surface has a nonpolar layer condition with a 1:1 stoichiometry with respect to the Zn and O. It is worth mentioning that after the relaxation process, the (100) slab model is showed a small displacement of the more exposed oxygen on the top side and the more exposed Zn on the bottom side, of the order of 0.01 Å. In the case of the (101) slab, the layer distribution consists of two Zn layers followed by two O layers. This model presents a charge separation between the Zn and O layers. In the theoretical calculations, the most stable condition is Zn termination on both sides of the model. The relaxation process resulted in compression of the most exposed Zn in the direction of the nearest oxygen layer due to the unsaturated surface and charge separation of the layers. Lastly, the (0001) slab has a Zn layer followed by an O layer, and so it continues alternately. The external layers did not present obvious changes during the relaxation process.
The surface energies (Esurf) showed that the stability order of the studied surfaces is: (100) > (101) > (0001), where the values are also depicted in Fig. 7. Many studies report the energies of different surfaces separately.89,90 However, the direct evaluation of the surface energies found by different methods can generate misleading results regarding relative stability. Park et al.91 presented a comparative table for different surfaces of ZnO. According to this study, the (100) and (101) surface energies were 1.12 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively. Both energies are 0.3 eV higher than our values. In the case of the polar (0001) surface, Park estimated energies of 2.04 eV and 2.25 eV for Zn-termination and O-termination, respectively. The average difference between these two values and our result for the (0001) surface is 0.5 eV. Even with the differences in relation to the absolute energies, the order of stability proved to be the same in both cases. It is also important to highlight that the stabilization of the polar surfaces, mainly the (0001) surface, is constantly studied.92,93 In addition, periodic surface arrangements over a long distance can also play an important role in the charge stabilization.94 In our models, the slabs were simplified to the stoichiometric conditions without reconstruction in the vacuum and with the addition of dipole correction generated by the asymmetric charges, according to Neugebauer and Scheffler,95 in order to obtain the starting point for the surface energies of the polar (0001) and (101) surfaces. Besides the Esurf values, Fig. 7 also shows the respective estimated shapes under vacuum conditions (also shown in the table in Fig. 8a).

The obtained shapes have a different rod length to the experimental shapes observed in Fig. 3. The imposition of a relative stabilization of the (100) surface with respect to the other surfaces is needed for the enlargement of particles, as shown in Fig. 8a. These data show the preferential stabilization of the (100) surface during the growth step under our experimental conditions. According to our model, the estimated relative surface energies of the (100) and (0001) surfaces of the ZnO particles with the experimental shape (Fig. 3) show that the stability of the (100) surface is about 8 times greater under our reaction conditions, as presented in the final step of the path in Fig. 8a (0.2 J m−2). Also, it is essential to highlight the variation of the particle extremities, where particles with both flat-tipped extremities ((0001) surface exposed) and pointed extremities ((101) surface exposed) can be found (Fig. 3). Such a change can be observed in Fig. 8b with the (101) stabilization, as expected. Our theoretical route of morphological change estimates that going from the flat-tipped shape (exposed (0001) surface) to the pointed-tipped shape (exposed (101) surface) involves a surface stabilization rate, (101)/(0001), of 53%. According to the experimental thickness and length values obtained from a sampling of our particles, we estimate that the relative stabilization rate of the (101) surface in relation to the (0001) surface oscillates between 1.8 and 2.15 times more stable. In general, it is clear that the environment, which includes the precursors, solvent and heating method, promotes significant stabilization of the (100) surface and intermediate stabilization of the (101) and (0001) surfaces, resulting in a mixture of morphologies with extremities of different shapes.
Based on the theoretical models, it is possible to understand the experimental facts in a more in-depth way. Even though the most stable theoretical terminations of the surfaces (Fig. 7) may not represent the real ones, it is evident that any termination of the (100) surface generates a plane with nonpolar characteristics and termination of the (101) and (0001) surfaces results in polar characteristics. We believe that these characteristics are the key point for the oriented growth observed under our conditions.
The only difference in the ZnS growth on ZnO between the samples was the Zn precursor, as previously discussed. Besides, it is essential to emphasize that the ZnO particles result from the same synthesis in both cases. Therefore, the precursors change the nucleation and growth points over the ZnO. In this sense, it is evident that the use of ZN in the synthesis of ZnS generates ZnS with favorable characteristics, electronically and sterically, for growth on planes that exhibit higher charge polarization. On the other hand, we believe that ZA has a certain preference for ZnS coating, causing a hindrance and, consequently, blocking the preferential kinetic growth at the tips, allowing homogeneous growth during the synthesis process.
3.1 Photovoltaic behavior
In this section we intend to demonstrate the correlation between the crystal growth and the preferential growth of ZnS on ZnO presented in the previous section, and the photovoltaic response of each system.

Fig. 9a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells based on ZnO/ZnS (ZN) (dash-dot/blue line), ZnO/ZnS (ZA) (dot/red line) and ZnO (dash/black line). The results revealed that devices with photoelectrodes of ZnS grown preferentially oriented on ZnO show better JSC and VOC, but with a slight reduction in the fill factor (FF) with respect to the ZnO cell. Note that ZnO/ZnS (ZN) showed better energy conversion efficiency, attributed to higher JSC (1.03 mA cm−2) and VOC (0.67 V). The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 where we observe the corresponding increases in JSC (17%), VOC (8%) and photon conversion efficiency (PCE) (4.7%), even though the FF decreases by 17%.

Other reports have already discussed the photovoltaic efficiency of ZnO/ZnS systems with better response than those presented here. These reports present results for devices using counter electrodes with reflective Al layers, electrolytes with high capacity to increase the response of the photovoltaic cell, and multilayered systems, among other peculiarities, which can improve the overall efficiency.96,97 On the other hand, our devices present greater simplicity in the preparation methods and efficiencies comparable to those of other more robust devices previously reported in the literature.
From the dark curves presented in Fig. 9b, it is possible to verify that the devices exhibited diode type behavior under dark conditions. Under forward bias the current increases exponentially as a function of the applied potential; when V = 0 the JSC value is respectively 1.5 μA cm−2, 1.4 μA cm−2 and 1.2 μA cm−2 for photovoltaic cells with ZnO, ZnO/ZnS (ZA) and ZnO/ZnS (ZN) photoelectrodes, which indicates that there are no significant differences in the current density values. The current densities of the same cells under illumination (AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2), whose data can be seen in Fig. 9a and are listed in Table 1, are 0.88 mA cm−2, 0.98 mA cm−2 and 1.03 mA cm−2, respectively. The relationship between the current densities of the illuminated and non-illuminated cells shows an increase of nearly 103 orders of magnitude when the cells receive light, which demonstrates the interesting photovoltaic potential of ZnO/ZnS systems. A faster JSC response can also be perceived in Fig. 9b for ZnO/ZnS (ZA) and ZnO/ZnS (ZN), which respond more quickly and at lower potentials.
In this sense, in agreement with the study by Wang et al.,98 it is observed that the higher current density obtained under illumination for the ZnO/ZnS system is due to the band alignment and increasing charge separation, as observed in Fig. 9a. On the other hand, in the dark, the formation of the heterojunction also increases the transfer of charge between ZnO and ZnS, as observed in Fig. 9b, where the current in the dark flows in the same direction as the photocurrent and the migratory charges from ZnS are fed back into the electrolyte by the diffusion process.98
In this context, for comparison, in previous work the FF goes from 29% for ZnO up to 37% for ZnO/ZnS,99 while our results provide FF values from 73.54% for ZnO to 60.25% for ZnO/ZnS (ZN). In our results, the FF values decrease significantly, but the absolute values are still high, indicating the efficient conversion of photons into electrons. Additionally the final efficiencies reported in the literature for similar systems99 were 0.19% for ZnO up to 0.62% for ZnO/ZnS (ZA) with 10 layers, and in our work the values 0.40% for ZnO and 0.42% for single-layer ZnO/ZnS were obtained. Therefore, we propose that our selective crystal growth can improve the photovoltaic behavior, even for single-layer systems. It is important to note that ZnS grown on the (101) plane of ZnO obtained with the ZN precursor (ZnO/ZnS (ZN)) provided our best result, improving the photocurrent by 17% and PCE by 4.7%, while in the literature,99 the ZA precursor is normally used.
Lastly it is important to note that all photocurrents were improved with specific ZnS growth on ZnO as can be observed in Fig. 9, and confirmed in Table 1. Thus, ZnS has the potential to increase charge transfer if it is deposited on specific faces (planes) of ZnO crystals, providing the best arrangement to obtain an adequate type II band alignment even if the (101) plane does not correspond to a highly stable surface. In this case, charge transfer is probably more favored (indicated by the photocurrent increase) compared with ZnO/ZnS systems where ZnS covers other surfaces.57
4 Conclusions
The increase in photovoltaic parameters is related to increased charge transfer as a result of the type II alignment present in this material. The fill factor decreases slightly from ZnO to ZnO/ZnS (ZN). On the other hand the efficiency increases, suggesting that this crystal growth model can help to improve our comprehension of the photovoltaic behavior in solar cells consisting of ZnS grown on the ZnO (101) surface.
In this sense, the polarities, surface stability, and the obtained energies corroborated to show that selective growth (covering) of another material (in this case, ZnS) on the (101) faces of ZnO crystals is possible, to isolate other faces. As observed in the study, this directly influences the photovoltaic behavior of DSSC systems, which is strongly favored by the better band alignment occurring on this surface, resulting in improvement of the photovoltaic behavior and increasing the photocurrent from 0.88 mA cm−2 for ZnO up to 1.03 mA cm−2 for ZnO/ZnS (ZN), corresponding to a 17% increase.
It is important to highlight that this observation shows new possibilities for studies of the ZnO/ZnS pair involving other types of properties. The possibility of modulating the results according to changes in charge transfer mechanisms and by controlling the concentrations of nanoparticles deposited on different surfaces can be useful in directing this material towards different types of applications.
