    , Accepted 26th January 2019First published on 28th January 2019AbstractManipulating the morphology of chalcogenide semiconductor crystals to tailor their shape- and size-dependent properties is much desired but remains a grand challenge. Herein, we for the first time develop a green, facile and surfactant-free hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) with highly tunable morphologies in H2WO4 aqueous solution. The H2WO4 is prone to balance the concentration of Bi3+ to S2− in aqueous solution, thus modulating the nucleation and epitaxial growth of Bi2S3. Specifically, in the presence of lower H2WO4 concentration, the low number of Bi2S3 nuclei facilitates the preferred growth of nanorod structures along the [001] direction, while the Bi-deficient, S-rich conditions in higher H2WO4 concentration give rise to Bi2S3 nanotubes, presumably due to the stronger interlayer interaction and preferred growth in the [hk0] direction. The resulting Bi2S3 nanostructures exhibit broad absorption overlapping UV-visible-NIR regions and red-shifted absorption edges owing to the increased S/Bi molar ratio in Bi2S3 lattices. The Bi2S3 nanorods with a higher aspect ratio demonstrate an enhanced photocurrent response by virtue of the improved charge carrier mobility along the [001] direction. Different from previous synthetic methodologies, this work details a facile, effective, and environmentally-benign protocol for the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanomaterials in the aqueous medium without any organic reagents. Notably, the excellent and tailorable photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance endows these Bi2S3 nanostructures with vast potential in solar cell and photodetector applications.
Introduction
Low-dimensional semiconductors with highly ordered nanostructures have garnered enormous attention in a plethora of fields including photoelectrochemistry, optoelectronics, thermoelectric devices, photothermal therapy, energy storage and catalysis owing to their unique chemical, optical and electrical properties.1–4 As an important V–VI-type semiconductor, the bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) nanostructure with a low dimension features the merits of excellent photoconductivity, tunable direct band gaps (1.3–1.7 eV), a large visible-light absorption coefficient (in the order of 104 to 105 cm−1) and reasonable incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (∼5%, measured in a Bi2S3-sentisized-TiO2-based photoelectrochemical cell with a calibrated silicon photodiode).5–7 Particularly, the earth-abundant element components and low toxicity endow Bi2S3 nanostructures with low cost and high biocompatibility.8 Bi2S3 has emerged as a promising candidate in photocatalysis, biosensors, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices, electrochemical energy storage, photothermal therapy, etc.9–17
Due to its highly anisotropic layer structure, Bi2S3 has the initial tendency to form a one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure.18 In this context, the highly ordered 1D nanostructure can provide a rapid highway for electron transferring and reduce the diffusion length of holes, which thus suppress the recombination of charge carriers and enhance the kinetics of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photophysical reactions.19,20 Therefore, optimizing the size and shape of 1D Bi2S3 microstructures including nanorods and nanowires is one of the reasonable directions to improve the PEC performance. To date, solvothermal methods are the most popular techniques for the synthesis of 1D Bi2S3 nanostructures.21–24 Despite significant progress made so far, the current state of the art suffers drawbacks such as relatively high temperature and pressure, long reaction time, and utilization of expensive and toxic organic solvents, surfactants and biomolecules as morphology regulators.10,18,24–27 To circumvent the abovementioned issues and to coincide with the concept of green chemistry, we envision that an endeavor to fabricate Bi2S3 nanostructures in aqueous medium without the aid of organic additives is highly desired but has been rarely explored.
Herein, we report a facile and green protocol for the synthesis of tunable Bi2S3 nanostructures through a hydrothermal reaction without any organic additives. The H2WO4 solution (pH 2.0) was utilized to provide the appropriate acid conditions that suppress the hydrolysis of Bi3+ ions and tune the growth dynamics of Bi2S3 nanostructures. By varying the concentration of H2WO4, the free Bi3+ ions in the aqueous solution could be well adjusted, leading to the alternative nucleation and epitaxial growth procedure. As such, Bi2S3 nanostructures display clear morphology evolution from nanoparticles, nanorods to nanotubes (Scheme 1) by simply increasing the concentration of H2WO4 from 0 to 0.2 M. Meanwhile, the bandgap decreased corresponding to the remarkably red-shifted absorption edges of Bi2S3 nanostructures. Bi2S3 nanorods revealed the enhanced photocurrent density while nanotubes demonstrated the declined one, largely due to the different preferred growing orientation. This work sheds light on the green synthesis of low-dimensional semiconductors with controllable morphology and tailorable PEC performance in the aqueous solution.

Experimental
Synthesis of Bi2S3 nanostructures
Bi2S3 nanostructures were prepared via the hydrothermal reaction of Bi(NO3)3 and Na2S in the presence of H2WO4. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Na2WO4·2H2O, Na2S·9H2O were purchased from TCI Chemicals. All other chemicals were commercially supplied and used as received. Typically, a Na2WO4 aqueous solution (40 mL with the concentration of 0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 M, respectively) was firstly obtained by dissolving Na2WO4 in deionized water, followed by adjusting the pH to 2.0 using concentrated nitric acid to afford a H2WO4 solution. Afterwards, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.97 g, 2 mmol) was gradually added into the H2WO4 solution under magnetic stirring, forming a uniform off-white slurry. When the aqueous solution of Na2S·9H2O (0.72 g, 3 mmol, 30 mL) was added dropwise to the above mixture, a dark brown suspension was immediately formed. After further agitation for 30 min, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed in a stainless-steel container and maintained at 130 °C for 24 h. The products were collected by centrifugation, rinsed with ethanol and deionized water, and finally dried under vacuum conditions for 6 hours. The Bi2S3 nanostructures were denoted as Bi2S3-0, Bi2S3-0.0125, Bi2S3-0.025, Bi2S3-0.05, Bi2S3-0.1, and Bi2S3-0.2, respectively, corresponding to the concentration of the H2WO4 solution.
General
The crystalline phase of the as-prepared samples was assayed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15416 Å) ranging from 10 to 60° with a speed of 2° min−1 at ambient temperature. The morphologies of the as-prepared products were investigated on a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope with a tungsten filament as an electron source operated at 5 kV and a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting the sample in anhydrous ethanol on copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200 W monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The 500 μm X-ray spot was used for XPS analysis. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10−10 mbar. Typically, the hydrocarbon C 1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon is used for energy referencing. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode on a Shimadzu UV-2600 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer with an integrating-sphere accessory.
Bi2S3 photoelectrodes for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement were prepared by casting the Bi2S3 suspension in deionized water (40 μL, 2 mg mL−1) to the ITO surface with a confined conductive area (0.20 cm2) and drying under ambient conditions. The PEC measurements were performed with a homemade PEC system. A 500 W Xe lamp was used as the irradiation source (50 mW cm−2). The photocurrent was recorded on a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua Apparatus Co., China) with a traditional three-electrode system: a modified ITO electrode as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode (in 3 M KCl solution) as the reference electrode. 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution served as the electrolyte solution for PEC measurements, which were all deaerated by nitrogen for 15 min before experiments. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted from −0.3 V to 0.8 V in 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution at a scan rate of 10 mV under chopped UV-vis-NIR irradiation.
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Scheme 1, we conducted the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanostructures through the direct reaction of Bi3+ with S2− in the aqueous solution. Firstly, Bi(NO3)3 is dissolved in H2WO4 solution (pH 2.0) forming a yellow-green mixture. Further addition of Bi(NO3)3 results in the formation of an off-white homogeneous suspension. There is a chemical equilibrium in the mixture, as shown in eqn (1): 2Bi3+ + H2WO4 + 2H2O ↔ 6H+ + Bi2WO6(1)
The acidic H2WO4 solution not only attenuates the hydrolysis process of Bi3+ but also regulates the equilibrium between Bi3+ and Bi2WO6. With the dropwise addition of the Na2S solution to the mixture above, Bi2S3 is preferentially formed due to the extremely low solubility (Ksp = 1 × 10−97), and controllable growth of Bi2S3 nanostructures could be realized via a facile hydrothermal reaction.
The representative morphologies and microstructures of Bi2S3 synthesized in the presence of H2WO4 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1A, Bi2S3-0 nanostructures mainly consist of nanoparticles of 72 ± 8 nm and various stubby nanorods with lengths of 226 ± 65 nm and diameters of 115 ± 32 nm. The average aspect ratio can be evaluated as 1.82. It shows the non-oriented crystallinity as demonstrated in the high-resolution (HR) TEM image (Fig. 1, Panel A3) although the wide distribution of length (diameter) size and low aspect ratio are recorded, presumably due to the larger nuclei number in the direct reaction between Bi3+ and S2− in the aqueous system.28 In the presence of H2WO4 (0.0125 M, pH 2.0), the morphology of Bi2S3-0.0125 (Fig. 1B) changed dramatically from stubby blocks to verminous nanorods with the length increasing to 373 ± 48 nm and a narrow diameter distribution of 124 ± 16 nm. The aspect ratio increases to 3.02. The crystalline structure of Bi2S3 is also obtained (Fig. 1, Panel B3). With the increment of the H2WO4 concentration to 0.025 M, the well-defined Bi2S3-0.025 nanorods are formed with a typical length of 435 ± 53 nm and diameter size of 92 ± 15 nm (Fig. 1, Panel C1 and C2). The aspect ratio increases to 4.73.

SEM images are summarized in the left dashed-line (blue) area, TEM images in the right dashed-line (magenta) area. Inset figures in (A3), (B3), (C3), (D3): FFT electron diffraction patterns. 
As shown in the HR-TEM image (Fig. 1, Panel C3), the observed lattice spacing size of 0.398, 0.50 and 0.79 nm corresponds to the (001), (120) and (110) facets of orthorhombic Bi2S3, respectively. These results unambiguously indicate the directional preferred growth of the Bi2S3 nanorods along the [001] direction. Upon further increasing the H2WO4 concentration to 0.05 M, a remarkable increment in length (1.95 ± 0.27 μm) of uniform Bi2S3-0.05 nanorods with a narrow diameter range of 177 ± 13 nm is observed in SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1, Panel D1 and D2). The aspect ratio reaches up to 11.06. The HR-TEM image also indicates the high crystallinity and c-directed epitaxial growth of the Bi2S3-0.05 nanorods (Fig. 1, Panel D3).
Interestingly, a remarkable morphology change of Bi2S3 from nanorods to nanotubes is observed when 0.1 M H2WO4 solution is used (Fig. 1E), while the diameter of these tubular structures dramatically increases to 550 ± 80 nm. The average size of the nanotubes is about 2.31 ± 0.17 μm in length and the aspect ratio is evaluated to be 4.31. As illustrated by the TEM image (Fig. 1, Panel E3), the typical diameter of the nanotubes is 135 nm. However, the Bi2S3 nanotube is so thick that the electron beam cannot transmit the tubular structures to obtain HR-TEM images. When the concentration of H2WO4 increases to 0.2 M, disorganized nanostructures are observed (Panel F1 of Fig. 1), although there are some incomplete tubular and even half-tubular structures (SEM image in Panel F2 and TEM image in Panel F3). The size of Bi2S3-0.2 nanostructures in both length and diameter is smaller than that of Bi2S3-0.1 nanotubes. Particularly, the pore size enlarges while the tubular wall becomes thinner. These results suggest that we can modulate the morphology of Bi2S3 nanostructures by merely adjusting the concentration of the H2WO4 solution in the aqueous solution rather than in organic solvents or coupling with organic morphology templates.
The crystal structures of the obtained Bi2S3 nanostructures were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. 2A). When varying the concentration of H2WO4 from 0 to 0.05 M, similar diffraction peaks of the main phase are observed, which can be well indexed to the orthorhombic lattice of Bi2S3 (JCPDF card no. 17-0320). It demonstrates the excellent crystallinity of Bi2S3 nanostructures (both nanoparticles and nanorods as revealed in Fig. 1A to D) obtained through the reaction of Bi3+ and S2− in the aqueous system with/without the presence of H2WO4. Moreover, no diffraction peaks of Bi2WO6, Bi2O3 or WO3 appear in the PXRD patterns. The two typical diffraction peaks at 24.96° and 25.20° correspond to the (130) and (310) lattice planes (Fig. 2B). Notably, the separated diffraction peaks of (130) and (310) facets are observed (curves b to d) in the presence of H2WO4 with a lower concentration (0.0125 to 0.05 M), indicating the nanorod morphology of Bi2S3 nanostructures as well as the good crystallinity.29 In contrast, Bi2S3-0 does not demonstrate the well distinguishable counterparts due to its smaller gain size which is in accordance with the SEM observation (Fig. 1A). With further increment of the H2WO4 concentration to 0.1 M and beyond, the separated (130) and (310) diffraction peaks of Bi2S3-0.1 and Bi2S3-0.2 are also recorded with enhanced diffraction intensity, while the (130) peak shifts to lower diffraction angles (ca. 0.04° shift, Fig. 2B) which is attributed to the enlargement of the Bi2S3 lattice in [hk0] directions. The diffraction peaks at 15.74, 17.67°, 22.46°, 35.64°, 45.67°, 47.01°, 47.33° and 48.27° can be indexed to (020), (120), (220), (240), (440), (350), (530) and (060) facets, respectively. The intensity of these (hk0) peaks is intriguingly enhanced, corresponding to the morphology change from nanorods to nanotubes in the presence of higher H2WO4 concentration (0.1 and 0.2 M, curves e and f in Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the characteristic peak of the (002) plane at 45.53° representing the (00l) facets significantly weakens. These results indicate that crystalline Bi2S3 prefers growing along a and b-axes rather than the typical c-axis in the presence of higher concentration of H2WO4 solution. We reason that H2WO4 can act as an effective modulator to synthesize various Bi2S3 nanostructures with high crystallinity and uniformly tailored morphology in the aqueous solution.

To provide deep insight into the Bi2S3 chemical structure, Bi2S3 nanostructures with varying morphologies were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3A shows the survey spectra of as-prepared Bi2S3 nanostructures. All the peaks can be assigned to the Bi and S elements as well as the weak peak of oxygen at 532 eV assigned to O2 or H2O adsorbed in the samples. No tungsten element is detected, indicating that no H2WO4, WO3, and Bi2WO6 formed in Bi2S3 nanostructures, which is consistent with the PXRD results. The HR XPS spectra of Bi2S3 nanostructures (Fig. 3B) reveal two strong peaks at 158.5 and 163.8 eV assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, with a reasonable Bi 4f spin–orbit doublet splitting of 5.3 eV.30,31 The two wide weak peaks at 161.3 and 162.4 eV are indexed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2. The addition of H2WO4 solution with varying concentrations from 0.0125 M to 0.05 M results in a slight peak shift to lower binding energy (ca. 0.32 eV in maximum) for both Bi 4f and S 2p. When further increasing the H2WO4 concentration to 0.1 M, the binding energies of Bi 4f and S 2p peaks shift to higher values and further shift to lower values in the presence of H2WO4 at 0.2 M. The similar binding energy shift is also observed in the case of S 2s transition (in the range of 225.6 to 225.3 eV with a maximum shift of 0.3 eV, Fig. 3C). Significant S-shape curves are recorded for the shifting trend of the binding energy for both Bi and S elements, which is possibly attributed to the varied interlayered interaction in Bi2S3 nanostructures.

Deriving from the peak area ratio of Bi 4f and S 2p peaks in the XPS spectra, the molar ratios of S to Bi in different Bi2S3 nanostructures are evaluated and listed in Table 1. The stoichiometric ratio of S to Bi in Bi2S3-0 is revealed. The S/Bi molar ratio slightly increases to 1.52 in the presence of H2WO4 from 0.0125 to 0.05 M, while it dramatically approaches to 1.7 when the H2WO4 is up to 0.1 M and beyond. There might be a reasonable relationship between the excess S element and the binding energy shifts, which may further explain the alternative morphologies from nanorods to nanotubes and the directional orientation along a- and b-axes rather than the typical c-axis in the higher H2WO4 concentration (0.1 and 0.2 M).

Considering all the characterization results, we sought to investigate the morphology and structure evaluation of as-prepared Bi2S3 nanostructures coupled with the morphology investigation of Bi2S3 formed during earlier reaction times (Fig. S1, ESI†). Given the characteristics of orthorhombic crystallinity and the inherent anisotropic Bi–S chain type structure, Bi2S3 has a preferred tendency to grow along the c-axis ([001] direction) with a stronger covalent bond in hydrothermal or solvothermal processes.32 In an acidic aqueous solution without any shape-regulating templates or organic solvents, the direct reaction of immediate dissociated Bi3+ and S2− ions can form a large quantity of Bi2S3 nuclei with outburst nucleation speed. As shown in Fig. S1-A,† most of Bi2S3 nanocrystals aggregate together with the length size less than 75 nm and diameter less than 25 nm. Thus, only limited Bi3+ and S2− ions remain in the solution for the further growth of Bi2S3 nanostructures. When prolonging the reaction time to 2 h and 6 h, the formed nuclei particles would laterally integrate along the a-axis and b-axis directions as well as the growth along the c-axis to lower the system energy, thus the length and diameter of rod-like Bi2S3 nanocrystals increase (Fig. S1,† A-2 h and A-6 h). With a longer reaction time (12 h or 24 h), the stubby nanorods, aggregated nanoparticles, and other irregular shapes are formed due to the hindered one-dimensional epitaxial growth.33 It can be confirmed by SEM and TEM observation (Fig. 1A and S1,† A-12 h).
In the presence of H2WO4, the chemical equilibrium of eqn (1) occurs where Bi3+ ions are partially transformed into Bi2WO6. The concentration of Bi3+ ions remaining in the acidic solution gradually decreases with the increment of H2WO4 from 0.0125 M to 0.05 M. Taking Bi2S3-0.05 as a typical example, the SEM image in Fig. S1,† B-0 h shows the irregular nanoparticles of formed Bi2WO6 and a small amount of Bi2S3 nuclei in the mixed slurry before thermal treatment. The nucleation rate and nuclei number of Bi2S3 particles are confined although the abundant S2− ions are introduced into the reacting mixtures. Under hydrothermal conditions, Bi2S3 nanorod growth along the preferential c-axis direction becomes noticeable on the basis of the small amount of nuclei and the fast reaction rate between plentiful S2− ions and gradually released Bi3+ from Bi2WO6 (Fig. S1,† B-2 h and B-6 h). The much weaker van der Waals interactions between the fast c-directionally growing planes limit the lattice growth in the a-axis and b-axis directions, which facilitate the anisotropic cleavage to form well-defined nanorod structures with improved crystallite size and fewer defects with prolonged reaction time (as demonstrated in Fig. S2,† B-12 h and 1D). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1A to C, the decreased diameter and increased aspect ratio are recorded for these nanorods by altering the H2WO4 concentration. On the other hand, the excess S2− with increased H2WO4 concentration would anchor to the surface of growing planes by bonding to the neighboring Bi atoms, enhancing the van der Waals interactions in the lateral directions. A slightly increased diameter of Bi2S3-0.05 (177 ± 13 nm even with an aspect ratio of 11.06) and gradually increased S/Bi molar ratio are revealed in Fig. 1D and Table 1, respectively.
In the case of higher H2WO4 concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 M, most of the Bi3+ ions are converted to Bi2WO6, which largely limits the forming dynamics of Bi2S3 nuclei. The irregular lamellar shapes consisting of nanoparticles are observed in Fig. S1,† C-0 h (in the case of Bi2S3-0.05). Under hydrothermal reaction conditions, both the c-axis growth and the lateral extension in the a-axis and b-axis directions are observed at 2 h and 6 h as shown in Fig. S1,† C-2 h and C-6 h. Under Bi-poor, S-rich conditions, the abundant S2− would bond to neighboring S as well as Bi atoms, further enhancing the interlayer interactions between Bi2S3 lamellar nanoparticles.34 It can be confirmed by the higher shift of binding energy as demonstrated in the XPS spectra (Fig. 3B and C). The stronger interlayer interaction would facilitate the preferred growth in [hk0] directions with enlarged lattice size rather than in the [001] direction as revealed by the PXRD patterns (Fig. 2, curves e and f), and thus result in the formation of Bi2S3 nanotubes (Fig. S1,† C-12 h and 1E and F). Therefore, H2WO4 plays an important role in balancing the concentration of Bi3+ to S2− in aqueous solution, thus modulating the nucleation dynamics, epitaxial growth rate as well as morphologies of Bi2S3 nanostructures.
The absorption properties of as-prepared Bi2S3 nanostructures were investigated by using UV-vis diffraction reflection spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4A, all Bi2S3 nanostructures show intense absorbance covering the whole visible range and even extending to the infrared region, which is mainly attributed to the intrinsic small bandgap and large absorption coefficient of Bi2S3. In particular, the absorbance peak is around 580 nm for Bi2S3-0, Bi2S3-0.0125, and Bi2S3-0.025, which shifts to 660 nm for Bi2S3-0.05, and further shifts to about 725 nm in the case of Bi2S3-0.1 and Bi2S3-0.2. Similarly, the absorption edge of as-prepared Bi2S3 nanostructures also demonstrates a redshift with increasing H2WO4 concentration. Corresponding to the red-shifted absorption edge, the direct optical bandgaps of Bi2S3 nanostructures gradually decrease from 1.54 eV for Bi2S3-0 to 1.46 eV for Bi2S3-0.5 and further drop to 1.29 eV for Bi2S3-0.2, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4B. The red-shifted absorption edge and declined bandgap may be attributed to the high S/Bi ratio in the Bi2S3 lattice which could increase the crystallite size and lack of quantum confinement.35 The excellent absorption properties of Bi2S3 nanostructures may guarantee robust photoelectrochemical performance.

Fig. 5A reveals the photocurrent density of different Bi2S3 nanostructures under light illumination. Bi2S3-0 demonstrates a photocurrent density of 0.46 mA cm−2. The photocurrent density slightly increases to 0.52 mA cm−2 for Bi2S3-0.0125 and further rises remarkably to 0.68 mA cm−2 for Bi2S3-0.025. The maximum photocurrent density of 0.70 mA cm−2 is obtained in the case of Bi2S3-0.05. The enhanced photocurrent density is well in accordance with the increased aspect ratio and wider light absorption of Bi2S3 nanorods. The preferentially growing orientation of Bi2S3 nanorod along the [001] direction provides a rapid electron transport route for the photo-induced charge carriers.29 Meanwhile Bi2S3-0.1 and Bi2S3-0.2 show dramatically declined photocurrent density due to the oriented lattice growth in [hk0] directions, although a broader absorption range is recorded. It indicates that the Bi2S3 nanorods prepared in aqueous solution without any organic additives reveal excellent photoelectrochemical performance.

(B) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Bi2S3-0.05, Bi2S3-NR, and Bi2S3-0, respectively, at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under light irradiation, and (C) photocurrent density-time response curves (0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl). 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution as the electrolyte, and a light intensity of 50 mW cm−2. 
The PEC performance of Bi2S3-0.05 as representative of nanorods was also investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution conducted from −0.3 V to 0.8 V at a scan rate of 10 mV under chopped UV-vis-NIR irradiation. The Bi2S3-0.05 electrode generates the typical anodic photocurrent as shown in Fig. 5B, which gradually rises along with the potential increasing from −0.3 V to 0.8 V. As the control, Bi2S3-0 and Bi2S3-NRs (control) synthesized via a solvothermal method in ethylene glycol according to the previous work36 demonstrate a similar anodic photocurrent response but lower photocurrent density under the same varied potentials. The onset potential for Bi2S3-0 and Bi2S3-0.05 is −0.046 V and −0.093 V, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). The difference (0.057 V) is smaller than the bandgap difference of Bi2S3-0 and Bi2S3-0.05 (0.09 eV), which may be attributed to their differences in morphologies, average aspect ratio, crystalline orientation and domain size as discussed above. As shown in Fig. 5C, the Bi2S3-0.05 electrode reveals high PEC stability under measurement conditions. These results clearly suggest the superiority of hydrothermal synthesis over the ones using organic solvents.
Conclusions
In summary, we for the first time have introduced a facile and green hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of various Bi2S3 nanostructures without the aid of any organic reagents. The resulting Bi2S3 nanostructures exhibit highly tunable morphologies including nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanotubes by simply varying the concentration of H2WO4 in an acidic environment (pH 2.0). H2WO4 at a lower concentration facilitates the formation of Bi2S3 nanorods with a high aspect ratio while higher concentration of H2WO4 gives rise to Bi2S3 nanotubes. The obtained Bi2S3 nanostructures demonstrated a broader absorption range from UV to NIR regions and the absorption edge shifted to a longer wavelength due to the increased S/Bi molar ratio in Bi2S3 lattices. Among the robust and tolerable PEC performances, only Bi2S3 nanorods with a higher aspect ratio could generate enhanced photocurrent response by virtue of the rapid charge carrier mobility along the [001] direction. This work opens up a new avenue for the facile, and green hydrothermal synthesis of Bi2S3 with tunable morphologies and tailor-made PEC properties. We envision that such green synthesis may be extended to synthesis of other metal sulfide nanostructures and bring immense potential in applications such as solar cells, photodetectors, and thermoelectric power generation.
