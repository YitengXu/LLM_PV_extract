1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as a widely applied power source, have dominated the portable device market and are pursuing markets such as transportation and large-scale energy storage. As an important component in LIBs, the electrolytes commonly used are organic liquids, which are volatile and flammable. This requires good packaging to preclude the leakage of the liquid electrolyte as well as a separator to prevent an internal short circuit due to lithium dendrite growth on the anodes. As a result, safety issues are the major concerns in the applications of LIBs.
Safety risks can be substantially lowered if the organic liquid electrolytes are replaced with nonvolatile and nonflammable solid electrolytes. Generally, the most commonly studied solid electrolytes are inorganic ceramics and polymer electrolytes. Inorganic ceramics are solid lithium ion conductors (also called superionic conductors), such as Li3N,1 La0.5Li0.5TiO3,2 Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4,3 Li7P3S11,4,5 Li2S·SiS2·Li3PO4,6,7 Li10GeP2S12 (ref. 8) and Li10SnP2S12.9 Although high ionic conductivity exceeding the order of 10−2 S cm−1 has been obtained in several glass–ceramic conductor systems,8,10 the volume changes in the electrodes upon cycling would undermine the contacts between the electrodes and the electrolyte, rendering the cycle life of all-solid LIBs problematic.11 Besides, inorganic ceramics are often costly in resource (e.g., Ge), production (often involving carefully controlled heat treatment) and processing (high elastic moduli).
Polymer electrolytes are another representative of solid electrolytes, the most prominent example being poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Polymers have obvious advantages in cost, production and processing (shaping, patterning and integration). Their low elastic moduli are especially favorable in flexible battery designs. In an ideal solvent-free polymer electrolyte, lithium salts are dissolved and solvated by the polymer chains. However, sufficiently high lithium conductivity (>10−4 S cm−1) at room temperature is yet to be demonstrated with solvent-free polymer electrolytes, due to the crystallization of the polymer at room temperature, which heavily hinders the transport of Li+ ions.
One possible strategy to improve the conductivity is to form a composite polymer gel by adding the solvent (organic or ionic liquids) as a plasticizer, but at the expense of compromised mechanical properties with safety risks (if an organic liquid is added).12–14 Another strategy is the incorporation of inorganic fillers into the polymer15–19 to form a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE). The inorganic fillers, serving as solid plasticizers, can kinetically impede the reorganization of polymer chains, and in turn facilitate the dissociation of lithium salt and the motion of Li+ ions, due to the Lewis acid–base interactions between fillers and polymer or fillers and ionic species. In addition, the physical properties of the inorganic–organic hybrid electrolyte system, such as thermal and mechanical stabilities, can also be modulated by the selection and design of inorganic fillers.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a rapidly growing class of porous crystalline materials synthesized by covalently joining metal ions or clusters with organic linkers, have drawn great attention in gas adsorption,20–23 sensing,24 drug delivery,25 catalysis,26 and optoelectronics.27 More recently, their properties in electronics28 and proton conduction,29–32 and more specifically in solid electrolytes for LIBs,33–35 have also been reported. Since MOFs are intrinsically inorganic–organic hybrid systems, with well-defined pores, rich structural diversity and functionality, they provide numerous opportunities and diversified options, many of which have been demonstrated, in pursuing high performance solid electrolytes for LIBs.
In this review, we mainly focus on two inorganic–organic hybrid electrolyte systems (Scheme 1): first, polymer electrolytes with inorganic fillers, and second, MOF-based solid electrolytes. We first present polymer electrolytes with different types of inorganic fillers, discussing how the fillers affect the electrochemical (i.e., ionic conductivity and lithium transference number) and physical (morphological, thermal, mechanical, etc.) properties of the system. Then we present state-of-the-art progress in MOF-based solid electrolytes, exemplifying how MOFs can contribute to such an inorganic–organic hybrid electrolyte system. This review ends with an outlook and directions for safe and high performance inorganic–organic hybrid solid electrolytes in the near future.

2. Solid composite polymer electrolytes
In a polymer electrolyte system, e.g. PEO/LiX (X = halide, ClO4−, CF3SO3−, PF6−, N(CF3SO2)2−, BF4−, etc.), in order to improve the ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, the addition of inorganic fillers, such as Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2 and Sm2O3,15–18,36 to form a CPE is a strategy widely studied for decades. The fillers serve as solid plasticizers; many chemical and physical properties of the CPE system can be significantly affected and systematically adjusted by the type, component, surface functionality and added amount of inorganic fillers.
Inorganic fillers can be categorized into two classes: inactive fillers and active fillers. Inactive fillers (e.g. Al2O3 (ref. 37) and SiO2 (ref. 38)) do not offer any Li+ ions to the CPE system; therefore, they are not involved in the conduction process of Li+ ions. In contrast, active fillers (e.g. Li3N (ref. 39) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (ref. 40)) themselves are fast ionic conductors for Li+ ions; they generally show high ionic conductivity and lithium transference number and directly participate in the conduction process of Li+ ions.
Good ionic conductivity (at least in the order of 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature), good electrochemical stability and compatibility with the electrodes are the most critical parameters when considering a new electrolyte candidate. Lithium transference number (TLi+) is also a key factor in determining the electrochemical performance of a CPE, since the use of a polymer electrolyte usually gives rise to a comparatively high charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface,41 and the TLi+ is relatively low for polymer electrolytes in general. The degradation process upon raising the temperature is also required to be investigated, so as to evaluate the thermal stability of an electrolyte candidate and judge its safety in the operating temperature range of LIBs.42 Parameters such as the degree of crystallinity, glass transition temperature (Tg), and melting point (Tm) are also of interest. Commonly used thermal analytical methods for a polymer electrolyte are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)43 and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).44 High mechanical strength and stability are also important for a polymer electrolyte. The electrolyte will have to bear the tear of regular usage and withstand clamping forces when it is fixed between the anode and the cathode. Poor mechanical strength and stability of the electrolyte will raise the risk of internal short circuit and the resulting safety issues.45
In addition, half cells with a lithium anode, at least, should be assembled and cycling tests be conducted to evaluate the applicability of the electrolyte in real batteries at varied temperatures and current densities.
In recent years, numerous CPE systems have been developed, most of which were based on PEO. The mechanism of the migration of Li+ ions,46–50 the proportional relation between fillers and polymer51,52 as well as the influence of the physical and chemical properties of PEO53 have been reported.45,54 Various types of fillers have been studied for the sake of enhancing the morphological, thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of the electrolytes; they include ceramic oxides, carbonaceous fillers, ferroelectric materials, clays as well as molecular sieves and zeolites.36,42,55–59
2.1 Inorganic oxides
The most widely employed inorganic oxides for fillers are inert ceramic oxides, silica (SiO2) (Table 1), alumina (Al2O3) (Table 2) and titania (TiO2) (Table 3).14 Other inorganic oxides (Table 8) investigated include MgO,60,61 ZrO2,62 sulphate-promoted superacid ZrO2,63 Zr–O–SO4,64 CeO2,65,66 NiO,67 CuO,68 ZnO,69–71 Sm2O3,72 Y2O3,73 Fe2O3,74 Fe3O4 (ref. 75) and Co3O4.76

The first study on the effects of incorporating inert Al2O3 fillers to a LiClO4/PEO electrolyte was reported by Weston and Steele et al.77 From then on, ceramic oxides of different dimensions, particle sizes, and crystal orientations as well as surface functionalities have been extensively studied as inorganic fillers for polymer electrolytes.37,39,52,78,79 They can be used solely or in a certain combination. Besides, inorganic fillers are often used with other plasticizers (e.g. organic solvent), cooperatively enhancing the ionic conductivity while maintaining the mechanical and thermal stability of the electrolyte.
Tailoring the particle size of inorganic fillers is a powerful approach to modulate the functions of the fillers. F. Croce et al.,37 for example, prepared an electrolyte of PEO/LiClO4 incorporated with TiO2 and Al2O3 (5.8–13 nm). In the temperature range of 30–80 °C, the CPE showed excellent mechanical stability with moderate ionic conductivity (10−4 S cm−1 at 50 °C and 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C), owing to the high specific surface area of the well-dispersed fillers.
In most reported PEO-based CPEs, the filler concentration has been confined to 10 wt% irrespective of the grain size, and a conductivity enhancement of up to two orders of magnitude has been achieved depending on the grain/pore size and the type of the filler used. In order to systematically study how the conductivity varies with the concentration as well as the grain size of the filler particles, Dissanayake et al.78 investigated a series of PEO/LiCF3SO3/Al2O3 CPEs, in which Al2O3 of four different sizes (<10 μm, 37 nm, 10–20 nm, and 5.8 nm) were employed as fillers. For each Al2O3 particle size, there is an optimized filler concentration for the maximum conductivity to be achieved. The highest ionic conductivity for the four Al2O3 fillers increased monotonically with diminishing size of the filler particles: from 1.29 × 10−6 S cm−1 (<10 μm) to 7.00 × 10−5 S cm−1 (5.8 nm) at 30 °C. Similarly, Hwang et al.81 observed that the ionic conductivity of a TiO2-modified CPE system (PEO/10 wt% LiClO4/5 wt% TiO2) increased with the decrease of TiO2 grain size. When TiO2 of 3.7 nm was added, the CPE achieved the highest conductivity of 1.40 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, which was an order of magnitude higher than those with TiO2 of 6.2 and 22 nm. Meanwhile, the TLi+ of the 3.7 nm TiO2-modified CPE was 0.51, much higher than that of the pure PEO/LiClO4 electrolyte (0.21).
Masoud et al.52 studied the influence of the added amount of a given type of filler on the CPE system. They fabricated a series of CPEs formulated as (Al2O3)x(PEO)12.5−x(LiClO4) with Al2O3 of 42 nm. The highest value of ionic conductivity (8.3 × 10−5 S cm−1) at 20 °C was obtained with the sample containing 1.25 mol of Al2O3. When the Al2O3 content decreased to 0.75 mol, the conductivity dropped to 3.8 × 10−5 S cm−1.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool that can provide us insights at the molecular level into the phenomena of interest. Ardebili et al.82 elucidated the impact of the size and shape of a nano-scaled filler on ionic conductivity by molecular dynamics simulation. By comparing the structural and dynamic properties of TiO2 nanofillers embedded in a PEO/LiClO4 electrolyte, they found that the nanofillers could affect the salt dissociation, lithium-ion mobility, and dynamics of PEO chains. They suggested that the repulsive nanofillers with different sizes could suppress the formation of ion-clusters and enhance the mobility of Li+ ions. Smaller-sized (lower volume fraction) nanofillers were better in increasing the mobility of Li+ ions. The surface properties of nanofillers could play a crucial role, while the shape of the nanofillers did not induce a significant effect on the observation.
Many studies have shown the tendency of increasing ionic conductivity of CPEs when downsizing the inorganic fillers under particular ranges of concentrations.37,78 However, the optimal properties of the CPE are not necessarily obtained with the filler having the smallest particle size.
Yap et al.83 studied the PEO/EC/LiCF3SO3/Al2O3 system with different Al2O3 sizes. The ionic conductivity with Al2O3 < 10 μm was 2.970 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, higher than the value of Al2O3 < 50 nm (4.843 × 10−6 S cm−1). Wang et al.84 compared two TiO2 fillers (5 and 25 nm) with the same added amount (0.1 wt%) in a series of CPEs of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mn = 300, 475, and 1100). The addition of 25 nm TiO2 tends to reduce the activation energy of the CPE system to a larger extent than 5 nm TiO2. The TLi+s of the electrolytes with different PEGMEMA (Mn = 300, 475) at 25 °C were improved from 0.41 and 0.52 to 0.51 and 0.54, respectively, by adding 5 nm TiO2; larger increases (0.57 and 0.61) were obtained by incorporating 25 nm TiO2. This phenomenon was explained by the hypothesis that a three-dimensional lattice is formed by the small molecular weight PEGMEMA chains and the ceramic nanoparticles so that a larger free volume within the polymer matrix can be produced by the larger particles. Conversely, the TLi+ of the electrolyte with PEGMEMA (Mn = 1100) at 25 °C decreased from 0.74 to 0.61 and 0.59 by adding 5 nm and 25 nm TiO2, respectively. The authors explained that the free volume was decreased by the longer side chains of EO wrapping around each other and the ceramic filler, hence limiting the ionic transfer-hopping pathway. Thus, the TLi+ can be only enhanced by an appropriate combination of ceramic filler and molecular chain.
These experimental results indicate that the ionic conductivity of a CPE system is not a simple monotonic function of the size of filler particles; other factors, such as the interactions between fillers and polymer and the dispersion of filler particles in the polymer system, can also have significant impacts.
Chen-Yang et al.85 reported a series of amorphous CPEs prepared from PEO, LiClO4 and silica aerogel powder (SAP) nanoparticles, which are tunable and designable and have unique features86 including interconnected pores, high porosity (90–99%), large surface area (>800 m2 g−1), low density (0.003–0.5 g cm−3), etc.87 At 30 °C the ionic conductivity of the CPE was 7.09 × 10−5 S cm−1, about threefold higher than that without SAP. The TLi+ of the CPE reached 0.67 at 70 °C. The CPEs were thermally stable until 200 °C. Shortly after that, the same group88 used SAP to increase the ionic conductivity of a PAN/LiClO4 electrolyte by 12.5 times (to 6.00 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C); the yield stress and elongation of the CPE also significantly increased from 1.57 MPa and 141% to 2.84 MPa and 210%, respectively. The authors ascribed the results to the increase in the amount of dissociated lithium salt by the coordination of Li+ ions with SAP, weakening the interaction of Li+ ions with CN groups in PAN. Li|CPE|LiFePO4 cells were tested and showed excellent electrochemical stability and good capacity retention (of about 120 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles).
Rhee et al.89 developed a filler, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which incorporates inorganic–organic components and possesses an inner inorganic silicon and oxygen core (SiO1.5)n. This filler is a kind of silsesquioxane molecule and is compatible with many polymers. They prepared a CPE of PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2/30 wt% POSS-PEG (EO:Li = 12:1). The CPE showed an ionic conductivity of 5.05 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 23 °C, 4.2 times higher than that without POSS-PEG, with a high electrochemical stability window up to 5.05 V. The system showed a very low Tg of −75.9 °C and an increase in the Young's modulus from 0.076 to 0.19 MPa.
The surface functionality of the filler is another factor that significantly affects the properties of the filler, and further influences the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Many efforts have been made to modify the surface of inorganic fillers.90,91
Park et al.92 studied nano-sized fumed SiO2 (12 nm) fillers with two surface groups of silanol (Si–OH) and octyl (Si–C8H17) in a LiClO4/PEO-based electrolyte. They proposed that the fillers could play two roles: interruption of the crystallization of PEO and arrangement of dipoles in the CPE so as to minimize the total energy. The ionic conductivity can be increased from 10−7–10−8 to 2.3 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C by adding the fillers. Giannelis et al.93 prepared a CPE composed of poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA) with hyper branched poly(amine-ester) (HBPAE) grafted nanosilica (denoted as SiO2-g-HBPAE). The abundance of hydroxyl groups on the SiO2-g-HBPAE surface enhances the ionic conductivity (to 1.51 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C; 1.36 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 100 °C) by facilitating the dissociation of Li+ ions and weakening the interactions between Li+ ions and PVA chains. Lee et al.94 prepared a CPE based on organic–inorganic hybrid branched-graft copolymers (BCP), using core–shell silica particles with ion-conducting PEG and an anion-trapping boron moiety in the shell layer. An ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C was obtained, attributed to the increase in the amount of dissociated Li+ ions as boron moieties effectively trap the anions of lithium salt. Even at elevated temperatures up to 100 °C, the CPE still retained its dimensional stability. When tested in Li|CPE|V2O5 cells at 60 °C and 0.1 C, the electrolyte with fillers helped to achieve an initial capacity of 291 mA h g−1 (very close to the theoretical capacity of V2O5) with a retention of 80% after 50 cycles; without fillers, the initial capacity was only 190 mA h g−1, which faded to 65% after 50 cycles.
Recently, Hassoun et al.95 compared the properties of silane-treated Al2O3 (Al2O3-ST) with the untreated one in a PEO/LiCF3SO3 system. With the addition of untreated Al2O3, the inflection temperature of the conductivity of the pure electrolyte decreased from approximately 67 to 62 °C (Fig. 2(a)). When Al2O3-ST was used in the system, a further decrease to about 55 °C was observed, presenting a much improved plasticizing effect. With the addition of the ceramic fillers, the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks decreased (Fig. 2(b)), implying the reduction of the crystalline plane spacing in the PEO matrix. When 10 wt% Al2O3-ST was added, the TLi+ of the CPE was 0.58 at 90 °C, while for the 10 wt% Al2O3 incorporated one it was 0.48 (Fig. 2(c)). In the test of a Li|CPE|LiFePO4 cell at 90 °C with a charging rate of 0.2 C, the irreversible capacity of the cell was limited to 10 mA h g−1 and the specific capacity remained 140 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles, comparable to that in liquid electrolytes. When the temperature was lowered from 90 to 65 °C, the capacity only slightly decreased from 140 to 120 mA h g−1. The Al2O3-ST fillers improved the ionic conductivity and lithium transference number of the electrolyte, which resulted in a lower polarization and reduced lithium-ion diffusion limitation of the cell compared with the cells using Al2O3-filled and Al2O3-free electrolytes.
In the preparation of CPEs, directly mixing the filler particles with the polymer is the most prevailing method. However, a considerable amount of crystallized polymer regions still exist, together with the agglomeration of fillers and the relatively weak polymer–filler interaction, making further improvement of ionic conductivity challenging. Cui et al.80 reported an in situ hydrolysis method for the synthesis of monodisperse ultrafine SiO2 nanospheres with precisely controlled size (12 nm) in a PEO-based CPE (Fig. 1). This method not only provides much stronger chemical/mechanical interactions between PEO and SiO2 but also enables better distribution of SiO2 in the PEO matrix. The SiO2 fillers significantly reduced the polymer's crystallinity, facilitated the segmental motion for ionic conduction and further improved the effective surface area for Lewis acid–base interactions. With these advantages, the prepared CPE showed a largely extended electrochemical stability window up to 5.5 V and high ionic conductivity (1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 60 °C, 4.4 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C). When operating at 1 C, the capacity of Li|CPE|LiFePO4 batteries with the SiO2-modified CPE was 118 mA h g−1 and 100 mA h g−1 at 90 and 60 °C, respectively, and still remained above 105 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 90 °C. In comparison, the batteries with the ceramic-free electrolyte only delivered 50 mA h g−1 at 90 °C.

Many studies96,97 have shown that the incorporation of organic solvents, such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC), as plasticizers can improve the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, but at the expense of the loss of mechanical stability. With the addition of inorganic fillers, this drawback can be overcome.
Dissanayake et al.98,99 added the combination of EC as a plasticizer and Al2O3 (pore size 5.8 nm, 150 mesh, neutral) as a filler to the PEO/LiCF3SO3 electrolyte. At 25 °C the ionic conductivity notably increased from 3.5 × 10−7 to 1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1, which was ascribed to the decrease in crystallinity and increase in the amorphous phase content of the polymer electrolytes. Subsequently, the same group investigated the influence of the TiO2 nanofiller and EC plasticizer on the electrochemical and thermal properties of a PEO-based electrolyte.100 The ionic conductivity of (PEO)9/LiCF3SO3/TiO2 significantly increased from 4.9 × 10−5 to 1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C when EC was added; simultaneously, the Tg decreased from −46 to −50 °C. The authors indicated that EC enhanced the conductivity by improving the ionic dissociation and increasing the content of the amorphous phase, while TiO2 nanofillers, besides the above two mechanisms, contributed to the conductivity by forming Lewis acid–base type transient bonding for Li+ ion hopping. Similarly, Ibrahim et al.101 reported a PEO/LiCF3SO3 system with EC as a plasticizer and Al2O3 (11.8 nm) as a filler; a considerable enhancement in conductivity from 5.04 × 10−8 to 5.07 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was achieved. S. Ramesh et al.102 investigated the CPE composed of PVC/PEO, LiCF3SO3, DBP, EC and SiO2. The ionic conductivity of the CPE at 25 °C was 3.32 × 10−4 S cm−1. A MCMB|CPE|LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cell was examined with an initial capacity of about 50 mA h g−1.
Polymer blending can further adjust the properties of polymer electrolytes.103 Liang et al.104 investigated the properties of a nano-Al2O3/PEO/PMMA CPE with lithium salts. PMMA polymer is strongly hydrophilic and chemically stable, rich in raw materials and easy to produce; nevertheless, its application is still heavily restrained by its brittleness. PEO has good solubility for lithium salts. When PEO and PMMA are combined, optimal compatibility and maximum conductivity can be obtained. With the addition of nano-Al2O3 (10 nm) to the PEO/PMMA/LiN(SO2CF3)2 electrolyte, the dispersion of film pores became more uniform and the surface morphology more even, which led to a decrease in the interfacial resistance of the electrolyte (Fig. 3).104 The addition of nano-Al2O3 also enhanced the tensile strength and elongation-at-break value of the electrolyte from 2.78 MPa and 9.5% to 3.26 MPa and 11.7%, respectively; the activation energy for Li+ conduction decreased from 20.10 to 10.96 kJ mol−1. In addition, the CPE presented an anodic breakdown voltage of approximately 4.9 V.

2.2 Carbonaceous fillers
Carbonaceous materials are also applied as fillers in polymer electrolytes and can be classified into two types (Table 4): electrically conductive fillers and insulating fillers. Electrically conductive carbonaceous fillers, e.g. carbon nanotubes, have the risk of electrical short circuit, and therefore need the incorporation of other insulating materials to obstruct the electronic conduction. Insulating carbonaceous fillers, e.g. graphene oxide (GO) and its derivatives, whose sp2 bonding networks are disrupted by defects and functionalization, have large surface areas, rich oxygen functional groups, and excellent mechanical properties. The addition of this type of filler to the polymer matrix can improve both the interfacial and thermal stability of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, along the interface between fillers and the polymer matrix, the Li+ ions may find low-energy paths, leading to a high ionic conductivity.

Ouyang et al.,105 for example, fabricated a PEO/LiClO4 electrolyte with oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (oMWCNTs), which were functionalized with carboxylic groups through oxidation with acid. With the addition of 1 wt% oMWCNTs, the Young's modulus and the tensile strength of the CPE significantly increased from 74 and 0.5 MPa to 474 and 3.7 MPa, respectively. In addition, the ionic conductivity rose by a factor of 3.3 at 20 °C, but the value was still very low (10−7 S cm−1). The authors explained that oMWCNTs could lower the crystallinity of PEO and improve the salt dissociation through the Lewis acid–base interactions of the oMWCNTs with PEO and LiClO4. As shown in Fig. 4, pure PEO, of which the crystals have an average diameter of ten micrometers,106 has a rough surface. After blending with LiClO4 and oMWCNTs, the surface became smooth and large crystal domains disappeared, indicating that the crystallinity of PEO was reduced due to the interactions among PEO, LiClO4 and oMWCNTs. The morphology of the electrolyte was affected by the content of oMWCNTs. The cross-sectional and surface SEM images of PEO/LiClO4/oMWCNTs (1 wt%) showed that oMWCNTs were dispersed homogeneously in the electrolyte, and no obvious oMWCNT bundle was observed. However, some oMWCNTs aggregated when the added amount increased to 3 wt%.

Despite the risk of electrical short circuit, Ardebili et al.107 created hybrid 3D nanofillers by packaging CNTs within insulating clay layers.108–110 The clay platelets could hinder the electron conduction in CNTs.107 They used it as a filler in a LiClO4/PEO-based electrolyte. The addition of 5 wt% clay-CNTs led to a 160% increase in the tensile strength of the polymer. When 10 wt% clay-CNTs was added, the highest conductivity reached 2.07 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The authors proposed107 that a CPE with both high ionic conductivity and improved mechanical properties could be further developed through embedding conducting–insulating hybrid nanofillers. Fig. 5 shows the schematics of the interactions among clay, CNTs, polymer chains, as well as lithium salt. Li+ ions have strong affinity to the electron donating outer surface of CNTs and the negatively charged oxygen atoms on the clay; such interactions result in the breakup of the contact-ion pairs, facilitating the mobility of Li+ ions along the polymer matrix. Moreover, due to the high aspect ratio of the 3D hybrid nanoscale fillers, the polymer chains can be unfolded; enhancement in free volume is therefore associated with higher mobility of Li+ ions owing to the lower resistant paths in the polymer matrix.

Two dimensional, single-atomic-thickness graphene oxide (GO) sheets with ultra-large surface area and excellent mechanical and electrical insulating properties can be promising filler candidates for improving the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of polymer electrolytes. Ardebili et al.111 also studied a graphene oxide (GO)/PEO/LiClO4 CPE (Fig. 6). With the addition of 1 wt% GO, the CPE exhibited an ionic conductivity of 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C and an over 260% increase in tensile strength. The areal capacity of the C/LiCoO2 cell increased from 0.01 to 0.17 mA h cm−1 by incorporating GO fillers. Lee et al.112 reported a series of CPEs prepared by using an organic–inorganic hybrid branched-graft copolymer (BCP) incorporated with PEG-grafted graphene oxide (PGO) as the filler material. The ionic conductivity of the CPE containing 0.2 wt% of PGO was 2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C; both the thermal and mechanical stabilities of the electrolyte were improved, and reasonable storage modulus values were maintained even at elevated temperatures up to 150 °C. Li/V2O5 cells with pristine BCP and BCP-PGO electrolytes were cycled at 60 °C and 0.1 C. The cell with BCP-PGO obtained a high initial discharge capacity of 287 mA h g−1, close to the theoretical capacity of the V2O5 cathode, with superior cycling performance. In comparison, the initial discharge capacity of the cell with pristine BCP was only 200 mA h g−1.

Recently, Li et al.113 fabricated a CPE with a homogeneous mixture of PEO, GO and LiClO4 by solution casting. They demonstrated that the orientation of PEO crystals in the PEO electrolyte could lead to anisotropic ionic conductivity along and through the crystalline lamellae. By incorporating 2D GO nanosheets that can retard the crystallization of PEO, template the crystal orientation, and guide the ion transport, the anisotropy in conductivity can be even more significant, resulting in highly conductive and anisotropic CPEs (Fig. 7 and 8). The highest anisotropic factor of conductivity obtained in the GO/PEO system was 70.

2.3 Ferroelectric materials
The dielectric constants of most polymers are comparatively low, limiting the dissociation of lithium salts. The addition of ferroelectric ceramics (Table 5), such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and LiNbO3, can raise the dielectric constant of the polymer, due to their large polarization effects. This effect can lead to an enhancement in ionic conductivity and lithium transference number and an improvement in the lithium/electrolyte interface.114,115

BaTiO3 is the most widely used ferroelectric ceramic in polymer electrolyte systems. Itoh et al.116 prepared a CPE composed of BaTiO3, LiN(CF3SO2)2, and PEO with hyper branched polymer (poly[bis(triethylene glycol)benzoate] capped with an acetyl group) (HBP). The ionic conductivity of the optimized CPE was 2.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 5.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 80 °C. The electrochemical stability window reached 4.0 V at 30 °C; the CPE was still thermally stable up to 312 °C under air. The DSC trace of the optimized CPE showed only a Tg of −34 °C, without any indication of melting transition, demonstrating that it is completely amorphous. Ulaganathan et al.117 prepared a CPE composed of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-co-HFP), BaTiO3, LiBF4, EC and PC. An impressive ionic conductivity of 5.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 30 °C was obtained with 8 wt% BaTiO3. The CPE was thermally stable up to 310 °C.
Kim et al.118 prepared a series of CPEs by adding different contents of nano-sized BaTiO3 filler (<100 nm) to PEO/PVDF/LiClO4/PC. At room temperature, the CPE containing 15 wt% BaTiO3 filler showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1, which was twice higher than that of the neat electrolyte. With the content of BaTiO3 filler increasing from 0 wt% to 20 wt%, the crystallization temperature (Tc) of the electrolyte gradually decreased from 45.87 to 28.81 °C. All CPE samples were thermally stable until 330 °C. Rajendran et al.119 reported a CPE composed of PEO/PVP/LiClO4/PC with different concentrations of BaTiO3 as the filler. The complex of PEO (72 wt%)/PVP (8 wt%)/LiClO4 (8 wt%)/PC (12 wt%) with the addition of 10 wt% of BaTiO3 showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1.2399 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 30 °C, and was thermally stable up to 341 °C.
2.4 Clay
Layered clays (e.g., montmorillonite (MMT), hectorite) have cationic exchange capability and can participate in intercalation and swelling processes.120,121 These features are highly beneficial for their dispersion within the polymer matrix when they are used as fillers. It has been reported that the exfoliated nanoplatelets of clay in the CPE system can minimize the ion-pairing effect; the intercalated clay structure can build up nanometric channels for cations to transport and impede the crystallization of the polymer (Table 6).122–126 To date, various researchers have focused on the electrical properties120,127–130 and ionic conduction mechanism120 of CPEs with intercalated clays.

Park et al.131,132 prepared layer-structured Li-MMT clays using lithium ion sources to exchange the sodium cations in MMT. When Li-MMT was incorporated to the PEO-based electrolyte, the Tm and crystallinity of the electrolyte gradually decreased. Accordingly, through adding 20 wt% Li-MMT, the CPE achieved an ionic conductivity of 5.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 (compared with 6.3 × 10−8 S cm−1, filler-free) at 25 °C with a TLi+ of 0.55. Thakur et al.122 reported a CPE composed of PEO, LiClO4 and MMT. The Na+ ions of MMT were replaced with dodecyl ammonium ions and therefore MMT becomes organophilic, which can resolve the ambiguity of the presence of the two alkali cations (Li+ and Na+) of the CPE in the clay channel. When the clay loading was ≤5 wt%, PEO8-LiClO4 was partially intercalated into the clay channels; when the clay loading was ≥7.5 wt%, the intercalation was significantly improved. Substantial enhancement in conductivity, cation transport and stability resulted from the nanoscopic confinement of a cation coordinated polymer in the channels of the organo-modified MMT clay. The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte increased from 10−7 to 10−5 S cm−1 by adding the fillers. The TLi+ of the CPE was 0.50.
Montmorillonite or hectorite appears to be promising due to its cationic exchange capacity as well as to its ability to participate in intercalation and swelling processes. The latter certainly facilitates the dispersion of the filler within the polymer matrix, but it may be also used for improving and/or regulating the properties of the electrolyte by means of an adequate functionalization. González et al.120 purified bentonite by cation exchange and sedimentation techniques and then converted it to the lithium form, which was used to form hybrid PEO@bentonite-Li+, by exchanging with 1 M LiCl (Fig. 9). They prepared a CPE with the hybrid PEO@bentonite-Li+ as the filler and the same PEO. The mechanical properties, transparency, and conductivity of the obtained CPE are better than those using bentonite-Li+ as a filler. The Young's modulus and the tensile strength (MPa) of the PEO/PEO@bentonite-Li+ were 325 ± 32.5 MPa and 7.5 ± 0.75 MPa, while for the PEO/bentonite-Li+ they were 247 ± 24.7 MPa and 2.9 ± 0.29 MPa. Compared with the PEO/bentonite-Li+, the ionic conductivity of the PEO/PEO@bentonite-Li+ increased from 3.89 × 10−8 to 1.81 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

Burgaz et al.133 prepared a PEO-based CPE containing 10 wt% clay and 5 wt% silica. PEO is known to be a strongly adsorbing polymer for hydrophilic nanosilica and a weakly adsorbing polymer for nanoclay. The addition of a strongly adsorbing polymer to a colloidal suspension can induce polymer bridges between particles due to the relatively high polymer–particle adsorption energy. The bridging of individual particles or particle clusters via polymer chains would lead to the formation of a physical particle–polymer network. As a result, higher modulus and much lower crystallinity were observed, compared to the 15 wt% clay system and pure PEO. Besides, the coordination of the ether oxygen with the sodium cations of clay and the H-bonding interactions of the ether oxygen with the surface silanols of hydrophilic fumed silica could shift the vibrational modes of the ether oxygen of PEO in the nanocomposites.
Sengwa et al.134–137 reported that the size of anions of the lithium salts and the concentration of MMT can both influence the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte system. In the study on the structure and dielectric properties of a blend-based CPE system (amorphous PMMA and semicrystalline PEO) incorporated with LiClO4 and MMT, they130 found that the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte at room temperature strongly depends on the structural dynamics as well as the preparation methods.138 Subsequently, the same group138 reported the effects of PEG as a plasticizer and MMT as a nanofiller on the dielectric dispersion and relaxation behaviour of a polymer blend-based CPE system. They found that the dielectric strength and relaxation times of the CPE vary with the addition of a plasticizer and nanofiller, which, however, have less effect on the ionic conductivity.
2.5 Molecular sieves and zeolites
Molecular sieves (e.g., MCM-41,139 ZSM-5,140–142 SBA-15 (ref. 15 and 143)), which have been widely employed in catalysis fields on account of their high surface area, special channel structures as well as strong Lewis acidity,144,145 can significantly improve the ionic conductivity, lithium transference number as well as other electrochemical properties of polymer electrolytes (Table 7).

Qiu et al.149 prepared a series of PEO/LiClO4-based CPEs with different ordered mesoporous materials (OMS: MCM-41, HMS and SBA-15) as fillers. They found that PEO chains could intercalate into the mesoporous channels of OMS by the solvent casting preparation process. As shown in Fig. 10, the internal and external surfaces of OMS had strong Lewis acid centers, which could act as physical cross-linking centers for PEO chains. The crystallinity of PEO therefore decreased owing to the interactions between those Lewis acid sites and the Lewis basic ether O of PEO, which inhibited the reorganization of PEO chains. When the OMS fillers were added to the electrolytes, the Tg and Tm of the electrolyte decreased; the tensile modulus increased considerably and was much higher than that of the electrolyte with nonporous silica.

SBA-15, one of the most widely studied mesoporous silicas, can be readily prepared over a wide range of uniform pore sizes (4.6–30 nm) and pore wall thicknesses (3.1–6.4 nm) by using a variety of poly(alkylene oxide) triblock copolymers as templates. The pore size of SBA-15 is large enough for the intercalation of PEO chains and thus forms the PEO/SBA-15 organic–inorganic nanocomposite material. Qiu et al.146 prepared a CPE composed of PEO/LiClO4/SBA-15. When lithium salt was introduced in PEO, the characteristic diffraction peaks of crystalline PEO became broader and weaker, indicating that the crystallinity of PEO decreased due to the coordination interactions between the ether O atoms of PEO and Li+ ions; meanwhile, a dramatic improvement of the surface morphology of PEO from rough to smooth was found. When a small amount of SBA-15 was added into the PEO12/LiClO4 complex, SBA-15 dispersed homogeneously in the PEO matrix and the smoothness of morphology was further improved; however, when its content further increased, SBA-15 particles began to aggregate. Owing to the special mesoporous channels of SBA-15, it can improve the mechanical stability of the electrolyte by acting as a physical cross-linking center of PEO chains. The peak intensities of the crystalline PEO decreased upon increasing the filler content.146 The Tm of the CPE decreased from 54.4 to 48.5 °C and the Tg from −32.8 to −40 °C. In addition, the TLi+ rose from 0.2 to 0.31 at 70 °C with the increase of SBA-15 content nearly in the whole range; the decomposition voltage of the CPE exceeded 5 V vs. Li.
Though the performance of the CPE with SBA-15 was obviously improved, resulting from the decrease in the crystallinity of PEO, aggregation of SBA-15 particles in the matrix and their relatively low compatibility with the polymer matrix limit the further improvement in the performance of the CPE. To solve this problem, Wang et al.148 surface-modified SBA-15 with γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane (GPTMS) and fabricated a PEO/LiClO4-based CPE with the modified SBA-15 (SBA-15-GPTMS). The conductivity and electrochemical stability of the CPE were improved by incorporating SBA-15-GPTMS. When 10 wt% SBA-15-GPTMS was added, the ionic conductivity of the CPE (10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C) was about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure electrolyte; the decomposition voltage of the CPE exceeded 5.0 V.
ZSM-5 molecular sieves have been used in a number of catalysis fields, due to their high surface area, special channel structures and strong Lewis acidity. ZSM-5 can obviously enhance ionic conductivity, lithium ion transference numbers and other electrochemical properties of PEO-based polymer electrolytes. In order to elucidate the role of ZSM-5, Qiu et al.147 studied the effects of ZSM-5 on the crystallization mechanism of PEO by the polarized optical microscopy (POM) technique. ZSM-5 considerably affects both the nucleation and growth stage of PEO spherulites: in the nucleation stage, ZSM-5 particles, acting as the nuclei of PEO spherulites, increase the quantity of PEO spherulites, while in the growth stage ZSM-5 curbs the recrystallization tendency of PEO chains through Lewis acid–base interactions. Therefore, the growth speed of PEO spherulites is decreased by ZSM-5. The increasing quantity of PEO spherulites, decreasing size of PEO spherulites, together with the incomplete crystallization, are all advantageous for creating more uninterrupted amorphous phases of PEO, which are in turn beneficial for the transport of Li+ ions. As a result, the ionic conductivity at 25 °C of a PEO/LiClO4-based electrolyte can be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude (to 1.4 × 10−5 S cm−1) with an ample quantity of ZSM-5 (10 wt%).
3. Metal–organic frameworks and their composites as potential electrolytes
As a complicated system composed of polymer, lithium salt, inorganic fillers and sometimes plasticizers, the properties of a CPE are determined by these components. As for fillers, factors such as structure, particle size, morphology, porosity and functionality can influence the system.14,42 It is highly desired that one can understand the property–structure relationships between the chosen material and the resulting system and modulate the targeting property by rational design of the material. However, such an attempt can only be realized when the structure of the material is well-defined and well-characterized; such a requirement can only be fulfilled in small molecules or crystalline materials, giving rise to powerful and fruitful molecular engineering and crystal engineering. Unfortunately, in a CPE system, the exact structures of polymer and fillers and their real interaction and bonding modes are far from being fully understood; there is still a long way to go to modulate lithium conduction as well as the electrochemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of the electrolyte at the atomic/molecular level.53 Crystalline inorganic–organic hybrid materials with versatile and tunable structures are of great research interest in the realm of ionic conductors or solid electrolytes. Such materials can set up a convenient platform for researchers to get insight into certain important processes, such as ion conduction and phase transformation, and systematically adjust the interactions with other species in a system so as to modulate properties such as dissociation of lithium salt and interfacial compatibility with metallic lithium.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous crystalline inorganic–organic hybrid materials, assembled by metal ions or clusters and organic linkers, first defined by Yaghi and co-workers.150 Due to their high surface areas, ease of modification, regular arrangement of porous channels, and tunable inner environment of cavities, MOFs have attracted considerable research interest in various applications including sensors, catalysis, gas storage and separation, as well as drug delivery.151,152 The application of MOFs in electrochemical systems has been an emerging field in recent years,152–156 and the use of MOFs in solid electrolyte systems has been proposed by several groups.33–35,157–159 MOFs can contribute to the construction of a solid electrolyte in two scenarios (Table 9): first, they can be used as functional fillers in a polymer electrolyte system, and second, with special design and treatment on the pore environment, MOFs can provide fast channels for Li+ hopping.

In the first scenario, MOFs are used as filler materials in polymer electrolytes, providing physical crossing-linking centers for the polymer to lower its crystallinity. Attractively, the cation sites of MOFs can facilitate the uptake of lithium salt, and preferentially bind to the anions of lithium salt, leaving the lithium ions comparatively free to move along the channels. Besides, MOFs have a strong ability to trap trace amounts of impurities in the system or side-products during operation, owing to their extraordinary specific surface areas. Such ability offers desirable protection to both electrodes, suppressing the formation of a passivation layer to increase the internal resistance and retard the electrode reactions.
Liu et al.158 prepared a CPE of PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2/MOF-5 by an in situ method. They dissolved quantitative PEO and LiN(SO2CF3)2 in a CH2Cl2–CH3CN solution and subsequently injected the blended solution to a MOF-5 reactor. The highest ionic conductivity was 3.16 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C for the optimized CPE, PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2 (EO:Li = 10:1)/10 wt% MOF-5. The increase in ionic conductivity was ascribed to the interactions among Lewis acidic sites in MOF-5, N(SO2CF3)2− and PEO chains, which not only inhibited the crystallization of PEO, but also benefitted the build-up of Li+ conducting paths similar to the structure of PEO6:Li+ on the surface of the filler. At 60 °C, a LiFePO4 half cell using the MOF-5-incorporated electrolyte showed discharge capacities of 143, 141, 138, and 132 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 C, respectively (Fig. 11), much higher than those with pure PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2, 126, 123, 118, and 107 mA h g−1 at the corresponding C rates. MOF-5 gave rise to a more stable interfacial resistance within a Li|CPE|Li cell. The anodic stability window of the CPE was 4.57 V at 60 °C, which was high enough to be applied in LIBs that generally operate at <4.20 V.

Liu's group34 prepared a CPE composed of PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2/MIL-53(Al), showing a high oxidation potential of 5.31 V at 80 °C and 5.10 V at 120 °C. The ionic conductivity was 3.39 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 120 °C, higher than that of the pure electrolyte (9.66 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 120 °C). The Tg decreased from 56.9 °C to 50.3 °C with the incorporation of MIL-53(Al). The discharge capacity of a Li|CPE|LiFePO4 cell tested at 5 C and 120 °C was 136.4 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, which remained at 83.5 mA h g−1 after 1400 cycles (Fig. 12).

Stephan et al.35 prepared a CPE composed of PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2/Mg-BTC by the simple technique of hot-pressing. The Tg of the electrolyte rose from −52 °C to −49 °C with Mg-BTC. They suggested that the Lewis acidic sites of Mg-BTC could interact with the O atoms of the EO moiety; the segmental movement of PEO chains would thus be restricted by the physical cross-linking of EO chains, resulting in an increased value of Tg. The Mg-BTC-free electrolyte began to decompose at around 190 °C while the Mg-BTC-incorporated one at around 290 °C. The remarkably increased thermal stability of the Mg-BTC-incorporated electrolyte was attributed to the intercalation/exfoliation of the polymeric matrix with the MOF fillers. The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte varied from 10−8 to 10−4 S cm−1 when the temperature ranged from 20 to 70 °C, and was more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than the electrolyte without MOF at 20 °C. In addition, the Ea for Li+ conduction without and with Mg-BTC were 1.3 and 0.6 keV, respectively. They speculated that the Lewis acid sites of Mg-BTC and the Li+ cations (also Lewis acidic) would compete with each other in order to form complexes with the O atoms of PEO chains and the anions of the lithium salt.160 Thus, an “ion–filler complex” can be formed by the Lewis acid–base interactions, which can lower ionic coupling and promote salt dissolution. Fig. 13 shows the cycling performance of a Li|CPE|LiFePO4 cell, which delivered a stable discharge capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at 70 °C and 1 C.

Later on, Stephan et al.159 studied PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2/Al-BTC. Between 20 and 80 °C, the ionic conductivity of the neat electrolyte ranged from 10−8 to 10−4 S cm−1. When the content of both MOF and lithium salt were 10 wt%, the ionic conductivity of the CPE increased by more than 2 orders of magnitude at 20 °C. The cell of Li|CPE|LiFePO4 demonstrated a specific capacity exceeding 135 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at 0.1 C. The same group161 then synthesized Cu-BDC (copper benzene dicarboxylate) by an electrochemical method and incorporated this MOF to a PEO/LiN(SO2CF3)2 system. With increasing temperature from 0 to 70 °C, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte enhanced from 10−6 to 10−3 S cm−1. The Li|CPE|LiFePO4 cell delivered an initial discharge capacity of 132 mA h g−1 at 0.05 C and 126 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C with good cycle performance.
In the second scenario, the MOF serves as a reservoir for the organic liquid electrolyte through the strong absorptive capacity given by its rich pore structure. The MOF channels, associated with the lithium salt loaded in the pores, enable the conduction of Li+ ions. The volatile organic electrolyte solution after confined by the MOF host is hard to leak, reducing the safety risks. Such a system would have a more reliable thermal stability and can be considered a rigid solid electrolyte alternative to the polymer electrolyte system. To date, however, only lithium conductivity values of this type of electrolytes are available; their applicability in a real battery has not yet been demonstrated.
Long et al.33 first studied the Li+ conduction properties of MOFs and proposed the use of MOFs as a host for charge carriers (Li+ ions). However, simply absorbing a commonly used organic electrolyte solution (1 M LiBF4 in a 1:1 mixture of EC and DEC) within MOFs (Mg2(dobdc), MOF-177, Cu-BTTri) could only give conductivity values of 10−9–10−6 S cm−1 at 27 °C, too low to meet the practical requirement (>10−3 S cm−1 at ambient temperature).162 In order to achieve good ionic conductivity, they showed that the uptake of a lithium alkoxide (LiOiPr) in Mg2(dobdc) before soaking in the electrolyte solution could lead to a solid electrolyte in the form of Mg2(dobdc)·0.35LiOPr·0.25LiBF4·EC·DEC with a much improved conductivity of 3.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 27 °C. Mg2(dobdc) is composed of 1D honeycomb-type pores, of which the average diameter is 1.4 Å; the interior pores are occupied with unsaturated Mg2+ metal centers (Fig. 14(a)).31 Long et al. hypothesized that the existence of open coordination sites of Mg2+ ions can facilitate the uptake of lithium alkoxide; the alkoxide anions preferentially bind to the Mg2+ sites, leaving the Li+ ions comparatively free to move along the channels. Fig. 14(b) shows a low Ea of 0.15 eV for Li+ conduction in the LiOiPr-grafted electrolyte, much lower than that of Mg2(dobdc) only incorporated with LiBF4 (0.31 eV). Through the impregnation process, the framework structure was still preserved, confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. Hence, they suggested that there should be a high density of charge carriers close to each other tightly in the pores of Mg2(dobdc), allowing Li+ ions to hop from site to site. They33 also elucidated the role of LiBF4 in the Li+ conduction of the electrolyte. They found that LiBF4 could affect the surface properties of the MOF crystallites, making a great contribution to the interparticle conductivity and interfacial contacts of the crystallites.

More recently, Long's group157 grafted lithium tert-butoxide (LiOtBu) with dehydrated UiO-66 (ref. 163) (Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc)6; bdc2− = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate). As shown in Fig. 15, an alkoxide anion interacts with three hard, oxophilic open Zr4+ sites in the Zr6O6 cluster core.164 The specific surface area of UiO-66 decreased from 1020 to 510 m2 g−1 after the uptake of LiOtBu. The ionic conductivity with the LiOtBu-grafted UiO-66 was moderate, of only 1.8 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature.

4. Conclusions
In this review, we have highlighted two inorganic–organic hybrid solid electrolyte systems: polymer electrolytes with inorganic fillers and MOF-based solid electrolytes.
Polymer electrolytes are a widely studied class of solid electrolytes that have accumulated abundant data and are close to practical applications. They have several specific advantages, including high safety, easy fabrication, low cost, high energy density, good electrochemical stability, and good compatibility with lithium salts. However, a major drawback of current polymer electrolytes is their insufficient ionic conductivity, especially at room temperature. The addition of inorganic fillers as “solid plasticizers”, under particular conditions, usually within a narrow range of concentrations, can improve the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, by modulating the Lewis acid–base interactions among the inorganic fillers, lithium salt and the polymer, weakening the coordination of Li+ ions with the polymer and the interactions between polymer chains and promoting the dissociation of lithium salt to increase the number of free Li+ ions.202 A suitable volume for lithium-ion transport at the organic polymer–inorganic filler interfaces helps to increase the mobility of free Li+ ions.165 Besides, inorganic fillers can increase the proportion of the amorphous phase and decrease the crystallinity of the polymer with a lower glass transition temperature. Generally, polymers and inorganic fillers tend to orient their dipoles in order to minimize the total energy.
It is noteworthy that different types of fillers show unique characteristics and contributions to the properties of polymer electrolytes. For example, ceramic inert oxides lead to an increase in the ionic conductivity and reinforcement of the mechanical integrity. Carbonaceous fillers contribute to the improvement of the interfacial stability of the electrodes and provide higher thermal stability. Ferroelectric materials can help to increase the transference number of Li+ ions by their strong polarization effects. The exfoliated layered configuration of clays can improve the transference number of Li+ ions, ionic conductivity and thermal stability properties owing to their advantages in cationic exchange capacity, intercalation and swelling. Porous molecular sieves decrease the crystallinity of the polymer through the Lewis acid–base interactions between the polymer and the porous system, preventing the reorganization of polymer chains intercalated into the mesoporous channels.
To further develop polymer electrolytes with better performance, novel fillers should be created, with carefully controlled particle size and smartly designed surface functionality. The fillers should have better compatibility with the polymer matrix and be thoroughly dispersed in the entire system, with an appropriate added amount. It is also useful knowledge to combine the advantages of different types of additives that show complementary properties, for example, the design of a multi-filler system, or a synergy of functional porous filler with organic/polymeric plasticizers. Accordingly, creating polymers with more complex structures and functionalities, or polymer blends with unique properties may also open up opportunities for better polymer electrolytes. The progress in synthetic research should be accompanied with and guided by the advances in characterization techniques and theoretical research, which afford more understanding and deeper insight into the underlying physics of the complex system built up by the polymer, lithium salt, inorganic filler, and other additives, including the phase transition behaviour and crystallization process of the polymer, as well as, most importantly, the mechanism of the dissociation and conduction of Li+ ions in the complex system, especially on the interfaces between fillers and polymer.
The transport of ionic species within MOFs and the applications of MOF materials in solid electrolytes are still an emerging research area.31 Though immature, research on MOF-based electrolytes has shown impressive results in the improvement of polymer electrolytes when MOFs are used as functional fillers, and more attractively, provided solid electrolyte alternatives to the polymer gel system when MOFs are used as host materials for Li+ transport. The highly tunable nature of MOFs, together with their extreme structural diversity and rich chemistry, sets up a versatile platform for new types of ion conducting materials to be designed and developed. Framework topology, pore size and functionality, crystallite size and morphology, solvent polarity, structure of lithium salt, and other parameters can all have significant impacts and therefore should be systematically adjusted for the optimization of the ionic conduction properties of MOF-based electrolytes.
Further engaged in polymer electrolyte systems, MOFs having open channels decorated with abundant open metal sites can interact with the anions of lithium salt in the electrolyte, anchoring the anions, while leaving the lithium ions relatively free to move along the channels. Such interactions can facilitate the dissolution of lithium salt, promoting both the lithium ion conduction and lithium transference number. The dispersion of MOF fillers and their compatibility with the polymer system can be improved by smart design of the organic linkers with desired functional groups that can covalently bond with the building units of the polymer. In situ polymerization/growth methods can also help to achieve this goal.203–205 Moreover, the high specific surface area, large pore volume and strong adsorbing capability of MOFs provide the possibility of using small molecular organic plasticizers, such as EC, DEC and PC, which are volatile and flammable, in a gel electrolyte system to obtain greatly enhanced lithium conduction without sacrificing the electrochemical, mechanical and thermal stabilities of the system and rendering safety issues.
The multifunctionality of MOFs may offer exciting opportunities in both fundamental and application research; unprecedented properties can be achieved that are hard to realize in conventional material families. For instance, a gas selective solid electrolyte would be extremely attractive; with such an electrolyte, a lithium–air battery can practically operate in air, without the deleterious effects of moisture and CO2 on both electrodes, instead of pure O2.166 This can be realized by introducing MOFs with good gas adsorptive and selective properties in combination with ionic conduction. A similar idea can be also implanted in a lithium–sulfur battery, in which the dissolution of polysulfide intermediates and the related “shuttle effect” can be addressed by an ion selective solid electrolyte that impedes the motion of anions. MOFs that undergo thermal induced structural transformation could lead to an intelligent electrolyte that can switch between ionically conducting and insulating states in response to heat;30 such an electrolyte provides an automatic approach for thermal runaway protection in overcharge or accidental conditions, thus greatly improving the safety of rechargeable batteries. The phase separation or solid solution type structure of MOFs may offer a wide variety of options to overcome interfacial issues between the electrolyte and electrode.167
The crystalline nature of MOFs can supply a distinct platform to study the motion of ionic species in nanoporous space via the structural characterization of key intermediates involved in ionic conduction using in situ crystallography or time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques.30 Such fundamental studies may build up a foundation to fully understand the structure–property relationships and ultimately lead to rational design and systematic optimization of MOF-based electrolytes. Though the tedious synthetic process, poor processability, and chemical, thermal and mechanical stability of MOFs still remain challenging, the number of MOFs created has been more than 20000 and the MOF chemistry is still under rapid development. Enormous opportunities and chances are there for researchers in designing novel electrolyte systems within the MOF family and their derivatives.
It is our belief that creating safe and high performance solid electrolytes by inorganic–organic hybridization in materials design is of great potential in the coming future.
