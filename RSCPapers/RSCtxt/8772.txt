    , Accepted 20th November 2019First published on 22nd November 2019AbstractFlexible perovskite solar cells (F-PSCs) are attracting tremendous research interest due to their light weight and flexibility. However, the poor quality of perovskite films caused by deformation of flexible substrates during a general heat treatment process hinders the fabrication of high efficiency flexible cells. Here, a simple gradient heat treatment (GHT) process is developed to effectively improve the crystal quality of perovskite films and the efficiency of F-PSCs. The results show that a smaller temperature fall-off gradient will be beneficial to the further growth of perovskite films, which helps to further enhance the crystalline quality. Compared with the conventional method, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of F-PSCs fabricated by a GHT process with a relatively small gradient significantly improved by 31%, and the maximum PCE increased to 17.37%. This work provides a new idea for ameliorating the quality of perovskite films and enhancing the performances of F-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Compared with optoelectronic devices on rigid substrates, flexible photovoltaic cells have stimulated great attention due to their advantages of light weight and large area roll-to-roll production,1–4 which enable them to be applied in numerous emerging fields, such as foldable electronic devices, wearable electronic textiles, irregular-shaped roof of buildings, etc.5,6 Organic metal halide perovskite materials have been recognized as promising candidates in flexible thin film photovoltaic cells due to their compatibility with low temperature (≤150 °C) and simple solution processes.7,8 In addition, their extraordinary optoelectronic properties of strong light absorption,9,10 tunable optical band gap (1.4–2.3 eV),11,12 long carrier diffusion length (100 nm–1 μm),13,14etc. have made them a competitive photoelectric material relative to traditional materials, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), organic photoelectric materials, etc.15,16
Recently, many groups have attempted to fabricate flexible perovskite solar cells (F-PSCs) on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates using indium tin oxide (ITO) as the transparent electrode.17 And they have made great progress by employing additives or adjusting precursor composition ratios to obtain large grain size and uniform perovskite films.18,19 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of F-PSCs has reached 19.38%,20 but this is still inferior to the one on rigid substrates. The relatively lower performance is mainly caused by the inherent properties of the PET/ITO substrate, including low transmittance, high surface roughness, large thermal shrinkage of PET, etc.21 Mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between ITO and PET may lead to the bending of flexible substrates,22 which will have a serious impact on the quality of the perovskite film on its surface. As we know, the outstanding performances of photovoltaic cells are dependent on the crystal quality of light absorption layers, which were usually fabricated through a heat treatment process, such as annealing.23 It is found that the reasonable regulation of annealing temperature and time can affect the properties of perovskite films effectively,24 and some studies have been done. Kim et al.25 have obtained perovskite films with large grain size by short-term (4 s) annealing at a high temperature (400 °C), and the best PCE on glass substrates has exceeded 20%. Meng et al.26 observed that CH3NH3PbI3 crystal grain size increases with the increase of annealing temperature (from 25 °C to 70 °C). Huang et al.27 found that a continued thermal annealing for CH3NH3PbI3 can increase the perovskite crystallinity and grain size. Obviously, the pre-annealing treatment or post-annealing treatment contributes to improve the crystal quality of perovskite films.28,29 Therefore, an opportune temperature fall-off gradient after annealing will also give rise to a further growth of perovskite films, which will often be neglected after the general heat treatment process.
In this work, a gradient heat treatment (GHT) process was designed to fabricate perovskite films for obtaining high crystal quality. By changing the temperature fall-off gradient after the heat treatment, we found that the crystal grain of the perovskite film exhibits a further growth leading to a more linear and regularized grain shape for edges and corners and larger grain size. The fabricated F-PSCs using the GHT process show the maximum efficiency of 17.37%, which is a 31% efficiency increase compared with traditional conditions. This work provides a common approach for further improving the crystal quality of perovskite films and PCE of F-PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
As we know, in order to obtain perovskite films with high crystal quality, a heat treatment at high temperature (e.g. 150 °C) was usually carried out after the spin coating process. Then, the temperature will fall-off with a natural cooling process. For flexible devices, PET/ITO substrates with perovskite films on their surface may bend easily because of large mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between ITO and PET substrates compared with rigid glass substrates (Fig. 1a).21 Generally, the bending of substrates may produce cracks in perovskite films and thus bring down the film quality, which has a serious impact on the performance of devices. Here, two perovskite solar cells with the same structure of SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au on different substrates (PET/ITO and glass/ITO) were fabricated using the same processing parameter to compare the distinction of device performance. From Fig. 1b, it is obvious that both VOC and JSC of the device on the PET/ITO substrate have a significant drop, resulting in lower device efficiencies. In order to improve the quality of perovskite films, the GHT process with different temperature fall-off gradients was applied after traditional heat treatment. Here, the gradient means the temperature change with respect to time. The large gradient implies the quick temperature fall-off rate. The perovskite films prepared by a sequential two-step spin-coating technique on PET/ITO substrates are shown in Fig. 1c. When PbI2 was deposited, the organic halogen mixed layer, CH3NH2I:CH3NH3Br:CH3NH3Cl (FAI:MABr:MACl), was spin-coated on the PbI2 film and then the samples were heat treated at 150 °C for 20 min. After this, five different GHT processes were designed to handle the perovskite films, and the temperature fall-off gradient curves are shown in Fig. 1d. GHT-2 represents the temperature decrease with a natural cooling process, and GHT-1 denotes a bigger fall-off gradient than GHT-2. GHT-3, GHT-4 and GHT-5 indicate that the temperature fall-off gradient is decreasing gradually. More details can be seen in the Experimental section. All samples were sealed in Petri dishes before the temperature fall-off to room temperature (25 °C), so they were not affected by any environmental factors.

(b) J–V curves of perovskite solar cells on both flexible and rigid substrates with the same fabrication process. (c) Schematic illustrates the fabrication process of perovskite films on flexible substrates by the GHT process. (d) The fall-off gradient curves of temperature decrease from 150 °C to room temperature with time. 

Fig. 2a–e shows the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films, which were examined to observe the evolution of morphology obtained by different GHT processes. Perovskite films are prone to crack at a relatively higher temperature fall-off gradient (GHT-2), corresponding to a natural cooling process from 150 °C to room temperature (25 °C). When the fall-off gradient continues to accelerate (GHT-1), more cracks appear in the perovskite film. However, when the fall-off gradient gradually reduces, the cracks can be eliminated effectively, demonstrating significantly improved quality of the perovskite film. In addition, as the fall-off gradient decreases, the average grain size of perovskites increases from 0.8 to 1.2 μm, indicating that the decreasing fall-off gradient is conducive to the further growth of perovskite grains. The statistical data of perovskite grain size distribution can be seen in Fig. S1.† The photograph of the perovskite single crystal is shown in Fig. 2f, which has very regular edges and corners. Compared with the morphology of the perovskite single crystal, the edges and corners of perovskite grain in films become more regular with the decrease of the fall-off gradient. In GHT-5 (Fig. 2e), the shape of perovskite grains appeared almost single-crystalline-like. Fig. 2g and h vividly illustrate the evolution of perovskite grain shape with the decrease of the fall-off gradient by means of SEM and schematic diagrams, respectively. A gradually regularized grain shape can be clearly seen, suggesting that a smaller fall-off gradient helps further growth of perovskite grains and thus improving the crystal quality of perovskite films.

It is necessary to understand whether the perovskite full growth is caused by its absorption of more thermal energy due to long time annealing and whether a low-temperature annealing will also work (without gradient) for supporting the perovskite to continuously grow. After 150 °C annealing, the perovskite films were cooled to 70 °C quickly and kept for 1 hour to realize a further low temperature annealing. The results show that the grain size changes a little bit, but the grain shape is not regular compared with the GHT-5 process. Therefore, after a high temperature annealing (150 °C), a low-temperature annealing (without gradient) will also increase the grain size of perovskite to a certain extent, but it will not make the edge angles of perovskite develop to a shape similar to that of a single crystal.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to analyse the evolution of perovskite crystallization by various GHT processes. All the perovskite films ((FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03) were fabricated on PET/ITO substrates by inter-diffusion between PbI2 and FAI:MABr:MACl. As shown in Fig. 3a, the asterisks stand for a series of characteristic peaks of perovskites, matching those reported for the (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 crystallized in the tetragonal perovskite structure. The peaks at 14.05°, 19.85°, 28.40° and 31.67° are assigned to the (110), (112), (220) and (310) planes, respectively.30,31 No PbI2 peaks occurred during different GHT processes, confirming that the perovskite film does not decompose. The reason may be that all the samples were kept in a small Petri dish during the temperature fall-off process. Thus, the Petri dish can prevent volatilization of organic halogens into the air leaving no excess of PbI2. According to Debye–Scherrer's formula, the size of grains can be calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD diffraction peaks.32,33 Gauss fitting of the three strongest peaks of the XRD test data shows that the FWHM at 28.4° has a tendency of becoming narrower with the decrease of the temperature fall-off gradient, as shown in Fig. 3b, which indicates that the grain size is gradually increasing and thus the crystallinity is getting better. The results are in good agreement with the SEM results.

(b) The FWHM of XRD spectra of perovskite films obtained by various GHT processes was fitted by Gauss fitting at 28.40°. (c) Absorption spectra of perovskite films obtained by various GHT processes and the inset shows the Tauc plot of the absorption data. (d) Steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films obtained by various GHT processes from GHT-1 to GHT-5. 
Besides the crystal quality, the optical characteristics of the films are also influenced by different GHT processes. As shown in Fig. 3c, the perovskite films present stronger absorption intensities with decrease in the fall-off gradient from GHT-1 to GHT-5. The perovskite films prepared by GHT-1 and GHT-2 processes showed almost the same absorption intensity over the range 650 to 900 nm, which may be due to the close fall-off gradient for GHT-1 and GHT-2 processes. When the fall-off gradient decreases in GHT-5, the optical absorption intensity increases obviously in the whole range. From the Tauc plot shown in the inset of Fig. 3c,34 the energy band gap of the perovskite film obtained by the GHT-1 process is 1.53 eV. As the fall-off gradient changes in GHT-5, the bandgap of the film reduces to 1.49 eV, corresponding to the red shift of absorption onset from 815 nm (GHT-1) to 837 nm (GHT-5), which may permit a higher photocurrent density. The smaller bandgap is most likely due to the enhanced crystal quality and the reduced defect density of the perovskite films. To further understand the influence of the GHT process on optical characteristics of the perovskite film, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was carried out using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Fig. 3d shows the PL spectra of (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 coated on PET substrates obtained by various GHT processes. The perovskite films exhibited the PL peak near 800 nm, which is in accordance with the bandgap of films. Although there is only a small red shift of the PL peaks, the PL intensities were obviously enhanced with decreasing fall-off gradient, indicating that gradual improvement of the optical properties may be related to the increase in quality of perovskite films.
Flexible solar cells were constructed with the above-mentioned perovskite films. The inset of Fig. 4a schematically illustrates the F-PSC structure. Here, a 25 nm thick SnO2 layer was used as the electron transport layer (ETL) on the ITO/PET substrate. The perovskite film, (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03, was deposited on the SnO2 layer as the light absorber with different GHT processes. Spiro-OMeTAD and Au were subsequently deposited as the hole transport layer and top electrode, respectively. Details of the experiment can be found in the Experimental section.

(c) Distribution of the JSC, VOC and (d) FF, PCE of the device with perovskite films obtained by the GHT process from GHT-1 to GHT-5. 
The J–V characteristics of the F-PSC fabricated by various GHT processes were measured under standard AM 1.5 G sunlight (Fig. 4a), and the corresponding performance of devices is summarized in Table 1. A clear relationship is observed between the device performances and different GHT processes. When the temperature fall-off gradient decreases, the device performance has been significantly enhanced in JSC, VOC and FF, leading to the improvement of PCE. In order to investigate the reproducibility, at least 15 devices were selected to perform an error analysis under each condition. Fig. 4c and d show the distribution of the JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of the devices treated by various GHT processes from GHT-1 to GHT-5. The gradual enhancement of device performance is attributed to the improvement of the crystal quality of perovskite films caused by the further growth due to the reduced fall-off gradient. Fig. 4d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum for the best performing devices prepared with different GHT processes when illuminated with monochromatic light over a wavelength range from 300 to 850 nm. The EQE of all devices reaches a maximum at 700 nm, which may be related to the maximum transmittance of the PET/ITO substrates at this wavelength. In addition, with the decrease of the fall-off gradient, the EQE of the device increases gradually. When the fall-off gradient dropped in GHT-5, the average value of EQE exceeds 80%, yielding an integrated current density of 22.2 mA cm−2, within 0.2% deviation compared with the JSC results. The gradual improvement of JSC is probably due to the gradual improvement of the crystal quality of perovskite films, which results in the enhancement of optical absorption properties as the fall-off gradient decreases.

The photoelectric performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices can be effectively reflected by charge carrier transmission characteristics. In order to estimate the trap density and carrier mobility of perovskite films, the electron-only devices, ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au, were fabricated on the PET/ITO substrate. Fig. 5a shows the logarithmic dark current density–voltage curves of the perovskite films obtained by various GHT processes from GHT-1 to GHT-5. The device of GHT-1 exhibits a large leakage current density of ∼2 mA cm−2 even at a small forward bias of −1 V. Nevertheless, when the fall-off gradient dropped in GHT-5, the dark current density is dramatically reduced by an order of magnitude, demonstrating that improving the quality of perovskite films is crucial in preventing leakage current.35,36Fig. 5b shows the log–log plots of space-charge-limited current (SCLC) curves. The current density exhibits the linear correlation with the voltage at the low bias voltage and high voltage region, indicating that it obeys Ohm's law.37 The rapid change in the middle region correlates with a trap-filled limit (VTFL), where all the defects are occupied by charge carriers. The trap density is extracted according to the equation: Ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/eL2(1)where ε and ε0 are the dielectric constants of (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 and the vacuum permittivity, respectively. L is the thickness of the obtained perovskite film (770 nm), and e is the elementary charge.38 According to the measurement of SCLC, the VTFL of perovskite films based on various GHT processes from GHT-1 to GHT-5 is 0.53 V, 0.49 V, 0.47 V, 0.41 V and 0.31 V, respectively. Electron trap density was calculated using eqn (1) to be 3.5 × 1016 cm−3 for GHT-1 and 2.0 × 1016 cm−3 for GHT-5, as shown in Fig. 5c. Obviously, the suppressed trap density should be attributed to the enhanced crystallization of perovskite films at the minor temperature fall-off gradient.

(e and f) Carrier transport schematic diagram when the GHT process has a lager and smaller fall-off gradient. 
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out to help understand the dynamics of carrier mobility and recombination in the F-PSCs,39–42 which were measured in the frequency range from 10−1 Hz to 106 Hz in the dark. Nyquist plots were obtained by a simple fitting, and two semicircles were observed as shown in Fig. 5d, where R1 represents the internal resistance and R2 and R3 represent the transfer resistance and recombination resistance, which are related to the first and second semicircles, respectively.43,44 Impedance fitting data of the F-PSCs are summarized in Table 2. The F-PSCs exhibit a lower internal resistance and transfer resistance, indicating a better characteristic of carrier migration as the fall-off gradient decreases. When the fall-off gradient decreases in GHT-5, the recombination resistance increases by an order of magnitude from 65921 to 355590 ohm, indicating that carrier recombination is suppressed in the F-PSCs. Less carrier recombination may be due to the reduction of defects in perovskite, owing to the improvement of crystallization quality. When there are more defects, the carriers are easily trapped by more shallow-level defects and a fewer deep-level defects.45,46 However, when the crystallization quality is improved after further growth during the slow temperature fall-off gradient, the defects will be relatively reduced, so that the carriers can migrate to electron and hole transport layers successfully. Fig. 5e and f vivid illustrate the carrier transport process in F-PSCs when the GHT process has a large and small fall-off gradient. The results show that an appropriate GHT process provides an effective way to enhance the crystal quality, reduce the defect density and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.

3. Experimental
3.1. Materials
PET/ITO substrates were purchased from GULUO GLASS Technology co. ltd. SnO2 colloidal dispersion (15%) was from Alfa Aesar. The rest of the chemicals were from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology corp., and they were directly used without further purification. All solvents were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
3.2. Synthesis of the perovskite precursor
The (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 perovskite was synthesized as already reported. First, PbI2 was synthesized with a ratio of 1.3 M in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 70 °C for 2 h with stirring. Then, FAI:MABr:MACl was synthesized by reacting 60 mg formamidinium iodide, 6 mg methanaminium bromide and 6 mg methanaminium chloride in 1 mL isopropanol at room temperature for 0.5 h with stirring.
3.3. Device fabrication
PET/ITO substrates (average transmittance in the visible region is around 73%) were treated with ultraviolet radiation for 10 min. For SnO2 nanoparticle films, the diluted SnO2 nanoparticle solution (the colloidal solution was diluted with deionized water from 15% to 2.67%) was spin coated on PET/ITO substrates in ambient air and then annealed at 100 °C for 25 min. After depositing the electron transport layer, the perovskite layer was deposited by a two-step spin coating method. First, the prepared PbI2 precursor solution was spin coated onto the electron transport layer at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 70 °C for 20 min; second, after the PbI2 layer had cooled down, the solution mixture of FAI:MABr:MACl was spin coated onto the PbI2 layer at 1500 rpm for 30 s in a N2-filled glove box, and then the film was annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in ambient air. After this, the hot samples were transferred to ice (GHT-1) and air (GHT-2) for rapid cooling, and the rest of the samples were still placed on the hot plate with a controlled temperature fall-off rate. From GHT-1 to GHT-5, the temperature fall-off gradient gradually decreases. After the GHT process, the perovskite film was transferred into a glovebox for hole transport layer deposition. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was synthesized by mixing 1 mL Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (90 mg mL−1) and the addition of 45 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (170 mg mL−1) and 10 μL TBP. Then it was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and without further heat treatment. Finally, an Au top electrode about 80 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area was 0.18 cm2.
3.4. Characterization
The morphology of the perovskite films was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SU-70). The crystal structures of the prepared perovskite films were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker-D8) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (TU-1810) with an integrating sphere. Steady-state PL was performed using a femtosecond laser system operated at a wavelength 532 nm with 35 fs pulses and a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Photovoltaic performance measurements were performed under illumination AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) under ambient conditions. The photo and dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. EQE spectra of devices were measured using a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (SCS10-X150-DSSC). Impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the dark with the frequency from 10−1 Hz to 106 Hz.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the gradient heat treatment (GHT) process is developed to improve the crystal quality of perovskite films on the PET substrate. The results indicate that when the temperature fall-off gradient reduced gradually, the perovskite grains exhibited further growth, resulting in more regularized grain shapes for edges and corners and larger grain size. Meanwhile, a smaller temperature fall-off gradient was conducive to improving the grain size and light absorption of perovskite films, reducing the dark current of the device. The excellent performance was attributed to the improved crystal quality and reduced defect density during the GHT process. The best PCE of F-PSCs reached 17.37%, which is a 31% enhancement relative to the one fabricated by the natural heat treatment process. The results show that the GHT process provides a promising way to improve the crystallization quality of perovskite films and the PCE of F-PSCs.
