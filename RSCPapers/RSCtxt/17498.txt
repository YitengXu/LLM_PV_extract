Electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as an important step in water electrolysis have been the subject of extensive study over the past decades. However, the low efficiency of electrolytic devices, caused by the slow kinetic reaction and the reliance on noble metal catalysts such as Pt, has limited their widespread application. Owing to their excellent conductivity, high stability, and tunable composition, nano-alloyed materials have been extensively studied in the HER. This article starts with an overview of the thermodynamics, kinetics, and pertinent electronic and structural descriptors essential for the HER. Combining the structure–activity relationship of nano-alloys with electrochemical reaction kinetics, the construction principles for nano-alloyed HER electrocatalysts (NAEs) are emphasized. Then, the reasonable construction, mechanistic studies, and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts are deeply discussed based on structure and composition tuning. Finally, challenges and possibilities for reasonable design of highly-efficient NAEs are proposed. This review aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between structure and electrochemical performance in alloy systems, providing guidance for the design of HER nano-alloyed materials with excellent activity and durability.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen energy is set to become a crucial component of the future national energy system, serving as a vital carrier for realizing green and low-carbon development in energy end-use. As such, it represents a key development direction for strategic emerging industries.1 Compared to hydrogen production from fossil sources, electrolysis of water is currently the most widely used and mature method due to its high efficiency, high purity, high current density, and low energy consumption, and other advantages, making it the most commonly used choice.2 Currently, the most advanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are typically noble metals such as Pt, Ru, or Ir.3 However, these precious metals have high cost, low utilization efficiency, and poor durability, which make them one of the biggest obstacles to the large-scale commercialization of electrolytic water hydrogen production technology. In order to reduce the cost of catalysts, nano-alloy-based materials have gained considerable popularity in the research field as potential substitutes for precious metal-based electrocatalysts. Their excellent conductivity and surface electronic structure can be greatly enhanced through composition engineering, shape manipulation, defect control, and strain modulation, leading to significant improvements in electrocatalytic activity.4,5
Alloys are composed of one metal combined with one or more other metals or non-metals. When different metals or non-metals form alloys, the redistribution of electrons around the metal occurs due to differences in their chemical properties, reducing the energy barrier for the generation of intermediates at the active sites.6 Therefore, nano-alloys have become increasingly prominent in the field of heterogeneous metal catalysts, displaying significant catalytic performance in various chemical processes.7,8 Typically, examples include hydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, electrochemical reactions, and so on. Taking the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene as an example, Zhang et al.9 have shown in their research that compared to monometallic Pd and Cu catalysts, PdCu alloy exhibits higher catalytic activity and ethylene selectivity due to its weak adsorption capacity for ethylene and moderate H2 dissociation ability. In addition, the isolation of Pd atoms by the Cu metal significantly contributed to both the conversion and selectivity. For the preferential CO oxidation reaction (PCOR), Pt-based catalysts are commonly used for PCOR in H2-rich stream, because they have a high affinity for CO molecules. However, monometallic Pt catalysts often suffer from catalytic performance degradation due to CO poisoning. To improve the catalytic performance of preferential oxidation of CO, it is a reasonable approach to introduce O2 adsorption sites by alloying Pt with other metals.10 Presently, there is growing interest in the utilization of alloys for the development of advanced electrocatalysts. Researchers from different countries have extensively studied alloy-based catalysts, which have shown excellent catalytic performance in the field of electrocatalysis. Over the past decade, a search for the keyword “hydrogen evolution* alloy” in the Web of Science core collection yielded over 8000 papers on the application of metal alloys in the HER. As time goes by, researchers have continuously modified alloy catalysts by tuning their composition and morphology to improve their catalytic performance. For example, in the case of noble metal-based electrocatalysts, by alloying noble metals (such as Pt, Ir, Ru, Au, etc.) with abundant non-noble metals (such as Co, Ni, Fe, Cu, etc.), the electrocatalyst cost can be significantly reduced while maintaining high electrocatalytic activity.11 Especially for the relatively slow Volmer step in alkaline environments, merging the active sites that favor the dissociation of the Volmer step into the alloy and effectively accelerating the adsorption and dissociation of water through dual functional synergistic effects can improve the rate of alkaline hydrogen evolution.12 Although there have been excellent reviews on the application of alloy materials in electrocatalysis,13,14 there has not yet been a systematic summary of the modification methods and structure–performance relationships for nano-alloys in the field of the HER. It is worth noting that this article does not review alloy materials formed by metals and non-metals (non-metallic alloys).
This study summarizes the latest progress of alloy-based materials in the HER, mainly focusing on the rational design and modification strategies of alloy materials. We start with the fundamental theory of the HER, including the necessary thermodynamics, kinetics, and relevant electronic and structural descriptors. Emphasis is placed on the construction principles for nano-alloyed HER electrocatalysts (NAEs), combining the structure–activity relationship of nano-alloys with electrochemical reaction kinetics. Fig. 1 illustrates the reasonable construction, mechanistic studies, and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts based on structure and composition tuning. Structural tuning mainly includes optimization of morphological structure, construction of core–shell structure, ordering of alloys, and interface assembly engineering. Component tuning mainly includes doping effects, multisite effects, and synergistic effects. Finally, we propose challenges and possibilities for the reasonable design of highly NAEs. This review aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between structure and electrochemical performance in alloy systems, providing guidance for the future design of advanced alloy-based HER electrocatalysts.

2. Fundamentals of the hydrogen evolution reaction
Although the HER is a simple two electron-transfer reaction, the pH of the electrolyte solution has a great influence on the mechanism of the HER. In acid solution, it is generally recognized that the HER consists of two basic steps. First, hydronium ions (H3O+) function as a proton source near the electrode surface accepting electrons, generating H* adsorbed on the electrode surface (H3O+ + e− → H* + H2O), which is called the Volmer reaction. Subsequently, the adsorbed H* is desorbed on the electrode surface in two possible ways. One is two adsorbed H* in the vicinity recombine to form the molecule H2 (H* + H* → H2), following a Volmer–Tafel mechanism. The other is the adsorbed H* reacts with another proton and electron to be desorbed from the electrode surface (H+ + e− + H* → H2), in terms of the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. It should be noted that the Heyrovsky and Tafel reactions are not mutually exclusive, and in some cases, the two steps may occur simultaneously.15 If the solution is basic, the reaction steps are similar to the acidic HER except for the Volmer step. Since the adsorbed H* produced in the Volmer step is derived from the cleavage of water (H2O + e− → H* + OH−), the reaction rate of the alkaline HER is 2–3 orders of magnitude slower than that in acidic environments.
From the HER mechanism, it is evident that the rate of the HER relies on the hydrogen adsorption on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Apparently, on the one hand, the combination of H and the catalyst should not be weak, because only a small amount of H* can be formed in this way, resulting in a slow reaction rate. On the other hand, the binding between H* and the catalyst surface should not be too strong, as this would make it difficult to decompose the products thereby preventing further reactions. Thus, the Sabatier principle states that the appropriate interaction between catalysts and reactive intermediates makes the catalyst have optimum catalytic performance.16 According to the volcano-type plots proposed by Parsons,17 Nørskov et al.,18 and Jaramillo et al.,19 the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of hydrogen adsorption on the metal surface was described as a suitable descriptor for predicting the acidic HER activity, and Pt was correctly positioned at the tip of the plot (Fig. 2a).

However, the difference between acidic and alkaline hydrogen evolution activity is still an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, in recent years, there have been many new advances in the study of the HER mechanism in alkaline media, such as hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory,20 bifunctional theory,21,23,24 interfacial water reorganization,22,25 etc. For HBE theory, Yan et al.20 found that the activity of the HER/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is only related to the bonding strength between the adsorbed hydrogen and the metal. The HER activity of Pt (100) and Pt (110) at different pH values indicated the linear relationship between the HBE values and the solution pH (Fig. 2b), which reveals that HBE is likely the sole descriptor for the HOR/HER activities on single metallic Pt in pH-buffered electrolytes. Markovic et al.21 proposed that there is no relationship between poor alkaline HER activity and HBE. In a bifunctional effect, the edges of the Ni(OH)2 clusters promoted the dissociation of water and the production of hydrogen intermediates that then adsorbed on the nearby Pt surfaces and recombined into molecular hydrogen (Fig. 2c). Water adsorption requires concerted interaction of O atoms with Ni(OH)2 and H atoms with Pt at the boundary between Ni(OH)2 and Pt domains. The Ni(OH)2-induced stabilization of hydrated cations (AC+) likely occurs through noncovalent (van der Waals type) interactions. Hydrated AC+ can further interact with water molecules, altering the orientation of water as well as the nature and strength of interaction of the oxide with water. Later, Koper et al.22 curiously found that HBE theory does not hold for well-defined single crystal surfaces (e.g. Pt(111)). As shown in Fig. 2d, the HER current and potential (E < 0 V) are completely different in deposition of the hydrogen (Hopd) region on Pt (111) in both acidic and alkaline media, while the voltammetry curves in the underpotential deposition (Hupd) (0.05 < E < 0.35 V) region are similar. This means that the HBE dependency theory does not seem to be universal. They showed that the difference in catalytic performance in different electrolytes may be related to the rearrangement of water at the interface through experiments of laser-induced temperature-jump. Regulating the potential of zero (free) charge (pzfc) and 0 vs. RHE by some means can affect the arrangement of water molecules at the interface and promote the improvement of catalytic performance.
3. Nano-alloyed electrocatalysts for the HER
The construction of alloyed materials is an effective way to optimize and improve the electrochemical activities of catalysts.
In recent years, many studies have shown that nanoalloy materials can maneuver the components, crystal structure, size, shape and structure of the alloy particles resulting in significantly different catalytic properties, even if the nanocrystals have exactly the same chemical composition or atomic ratio. To preferentially expose active sites and/or to promote site-specific activities, advanced strategies, such as downsizing size, preparing unique shapes, designing structure, doping, etc., have been applied to prepare efficient NAEs for the HER. In order to make a better understanding and comparison among these NAEs, the relationship between the metal loading and HER performance in different media, respectively, are summarized in Table 1.

3.1 Structure tuning
The structural tuning strategy can enhance the electrocatalytic performance by optimizing the surface electronic structure of the catalyst and enhancing the catalytic activity of single active sites. The structure tuning here mainly includes the following aspects to optimize the HER performance: 1) the unique shape design is conducive to exposing more active sites; 2) the construction of core–shell structure is helpful to optimize charge transfer and improve stability; 3) interface assembly engineering strategies provide the tunability of interface properties, such as the electronic structure of the active site of the interface; 4) the ordering of atoms in alloys gives them well-defined structure and tunable electronic properties due to ordered stoichiometry and strong d-orbital interaction, and is beneficial for enhancing their mass activity and improving their long-term durability.
Unique shape. The shape of catalysts markedly regulates the electrocatalytic properties via tailoring the population of the exposed active sites and governing the adsorption/desorption behaviors of the reaction intermediates/reactants.104 According to the idea of dimensional design, researchers have prepared NAEs in the shape of three-dimensional (3D) porous39,58,105 and hollow structures,63,75,76,88 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets,37,89,106 one-dimensional (2D) nanorods38,43 and nanodendrites,40,107 ultra-small nanoparticles,12,30,33,42,83–85 etc., in order to expose more active sites. First, we discuss the effect of a 3D pore structure on the HER performance. A highly hierarchical nanoporous bimetallic material Cu–Ti alloy (np-CuTi) with a well-defined bimodal pore size distribution exhibits high alkaline HER performance due to large surface areas and mass transport properties enhanced by the micrometre-sized pores (Fig. 3a and b).105 Similar to nanoporous materials, hollow-structured nanomaterials have well-defined void space and large specific surface area, which are believed to be beneficial for electrocatalytic reactions.108 For example, Wu et al.88 synthesized hollow interior and accessible surfaces of ternary PtNiCu nanoparticles with low Pt-content. The formation of hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles (H-PtNiCu NPs) was ascribed to the galvanic replacement reaction and atomic diffusion between CuNi nanocrystals prepared in situ and Pt species. Then, H-PtNiCu NPs with Pt-enriched surfaces (H-PtNiCu-AAT NPs) could be obtained after a subsequent acid and annealing treatment (Fig. 3c–f). Benefiting from hollow and open structures, the obtained catalyst showed excellent HER catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 32 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M HClO4 solution (Fig. 3g).

Owing to the distinctive ultrathin 2D shapes with single or less atomic layer thickness and abundant active sites and high unsaturated atom density, nanosheets may provide better catalytic activity from the perspective of morphology.96,109 Wang et al.89 synthesized trimetallic PtAgCo alloy nanosheets with controllable composition through an oxidative etching of twin nanocrystals (Fig. 4a–e). The PtAgCo-II ultrathin nanosheets possess useful HER properties, and achieve a current density up to 705 mA cm−2 at a potential of −400 mV (Fig. 4f). The surface structures (edge thickness and lateral size) of the PtAgCo nanosheets contribute to the HER performance enhancement. As compared to the 2D nanostructure, the 1D materials have the characteristics of high surface areas, high active-site densities, fast charge transport pathways, unidirectional electron flow, abundant open space and porosity between adjacent 1D nanostructures.110 Cao et al.43 reported the one-pot solvothermal synthesis of close-packed hexagonal platinum-nickel alloy nano-multipods. The SEM, TEM and HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 4g–o) show that each branch of the nano-multipods takes the shape of excavated hexagonal prisms assembled by six nanosheets of 2.5 nm thickness. In 0.1 M KOH, the overpotential for the unique hcp Pt–Ni excavated nano-multipods is only 65 mV versus RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, much smaller than that of the fcc counterpart and commercial Pt/C (Fig. 4p). The Tafel slope of Pt–Ni alloy is low, which indicates that the alloying of Ni and Pt in alkaline solution is favorable for the HER (Fig. 4q).

Whether 3D, 2D or 1D, alloy nanomaterials are designed with unique shapes to achieve sufficient active sites and high electrochemical activity. In addition, nano-alloy materials can also achieve the same purpose by dispersing the alloy into ultra-small nanoparticles with a suitable support. An extreme example, single-atom catalysts are known for their high activity and excellent chemical selectivity, because the catalytic active moiety consists of a single metal atom and the surrounding environment derived from the supports.111 Carriers are usually selected for good electrical conductivity and large surface areas, such as porous carbon carriers, which can enable rapid electron transport and fast gas diffusion, providing a large interface and gap between the catalytic active sites and the electrolyte.112 Huang et al.84 developed a surfactant-free, wet-chemical, and large-scalable strategy to prepare a series of ultra-small, monodisperse iridium (Ir)-based nanoclusters for highly efficient acidic overall water splitting. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and STEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mappings clearly reveal that ultrasmall IrNi nanoclusters are highly dispersed on the carbon surface without aggregation (Fig. 5a–h). The IrM (M = Ni, Co, Fe) nanoclusters exhibit higher activity compared to Ir nanoclusters, and most excitingly, the IrNi nanoclusters show even better catalytic properties than Pt/C (Fig. 5i). Unlike porous carbon black, carbon nanofibers are known to be ideal carriers because of their interconnected 3D architecture.113 PtCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon nanofibers (PtCo/CNFs) were prepared by a combination of electrospinning and graphitization processes.85 After graphitization, homogeneous PtCo alloy nanoparticles were formed in situ and encapsulated in the CNF matrix (Fig. 5j). PtCo/CNFs afford a current density of 10.0 mA cm−2 at 63 mV, which is very close to that of commercial Pt/C (about 57 mV) and far lower than those of Pt/CNFs and Co/CNFs at 104 mV and 475 mV, respectively, in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (Fig. 5k). Therefore, developing NEAs with specific shapes, such as dimensions, and porosity is a sensible strategy to ameliorate the catalytic performance, which needs to be further explored.

Core–shell structure. Core–shell nanomaterials are increasingly attracting attention owing to their interesting properties, that is, conducive and versatile compositions and structures.114 Among them, the synergism between the shell and the core enables them to obtain higher efficiency and selectivity in catalytic applications. In HER electrocatalysts with a core–shell nano-alloy structure, core–shell composite materials with alloy nanoparticles encapsulated within the carbon matrix are the focus of research, and the choice of carbon carrier is mainly nitrogen-doped carbon.4,45,46,62,78,81,82,91,115–117 The activity is mainly attributed to the interfacial charge transfer from the metal core to the carbon shell, which manipulates the electronic interactions between the catalyst surface and reaction intermediates, and varies with the structures and morphologies of the metal core (elemental composition, core size, etc.) and carbon shell (doping, layer thickness, etc.).118 In addition, the core–shell structure prepared as part of the work is an alloy core and a noble metal shell obtained by etching the non-precious metal components of the alloy119 or depositing noble metals onto alloy particles.94 These core–shell nanoparticles are more active for the HER in acidic solution than alloy or noble metal particles, and they are almost as active as commercial platinum catalysts, but with greatly enhanced durability.94,119 For example, the sub-monolayer Pt is controllably deposited on the intermetallic Pd3Pb nanoplates (AL-Pt/Pd3Pb), and enables ALPt/Pd3Pb to exhibit excellent HER activity (Fig. 6a–i).94 This is because the atomic efficiency and electronic structure of the active surface Pt layer are greatly optimized, that is, the charge transfer from Pd3Pb to Pt produces strong electrostatic interactions that can stabilize the transition state and lower the barrier. Furthermore, AL-Pt/Pd3Pb exhibits excellent stability and robustness (Fig. 6j). Synthesis by etching non-precious metals is a common method for preparing such core–shell materials.120 Sun et al.119 synthesized NiAu alloy by a co-reduction method, and after electro-anodic oxidation, the NiAu alloy nanoparticles were transformed into core/shell NiAu/Au nanoparticles (Fig. 6k and l). Core/shell NiAu/Au has Pt-like activity and is even more stable than Pt under HER conditions (Fig. 6m). First principles calculations indicate that the high activity of the NiAu/Au structure arises from the formation of Au sites with low coordination numbers. And such a defective Au shell promotes the recombination of the two adsorbed H atoms and thus the HER.

Except for a few core–shell NAEs with noble metals as shells, researchers pay more attention to carbon layers as shells, mainly nitrogen-doped carbon, can simultaneously promote the HER activity through the synergism and enhance the stability due to the protection from the carbon cage.78,82 Chen et al.4 developed RuCo nanoalloys encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphene layers (RuCo@NC) by an in situ method without adding any other carbon sources, that is, one-step annealing of Ru-doped prussian blue analogues (Fig. 7a). The N-doped graphene layers is able to efficiently avoid the agglomeration of the inside alloy particles to provide more eletrocatalytic active sites. Sample S-4, preferably selected from alloy systems with different component contents, exhibited better activity and stability in 1 M KOH electrolyte than commercial Ru powder catalysts and commercial Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 7b). Combining the computational and experimental results, it is demonstrated that the excellent HER activity originates from the alloying of Ru with Co atoms and the unique carbon layer-shell structure derived from the MOF. In other words, the enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity stems from the fact that the RuCo core can transfer more electrons to the graphene shell than the pure Co shell, thereby enhancing the C–H bond and significantly reducing ΔGH* (Fig. 7c). In an attempt to challenge the low efficiency and stability of non-precious metal-based catalysts in acidic media, Bao et al.47,78 designed a layered architecture consisting of an ultrathin graphene shell (only 1–3 layers) through which a homogeneous CoNi nanoalloy was encapsulated to enhance its HER performance in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 7d–f). The optimized catalyst is highly stable and active, with an almost zero starting overpotential relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an overpotential of only 142 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which is very close to that of commercial 40% Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 7g and h). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ultrathin graphene shell strongly promotes electron penetration from the CoNi nanoalloy to the graphene surface (Fig. 7i and j). Also, with the use of nitrogen dopants, they can synergistically increase the electron density on the graphene surface, resulting in excellent HER activity on the graphene shell layer (Fig. 7k).

Ordering of nanoalloys. Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) with ordered structures are very promising materials for NEAs and are widely used,36,44,53,59,60,73,86,90,121–126 for example, as highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions, the formic acid oxidation reaction and the HER. This impressive activity is attributed to the well-defined structure (ordered stoichiometry) and tunable electronic properties (strong d-orbital interactions),127 which allow IMCs to exhibit not only a uniform maximally dispersed active site and optimized electronic structure at the atomic scale thus increasing their mass activity, but also to achieve “enthalpy “stability to improve long-term durability.128,129 A representative study on ordered mesoporous intermetallic trimetals by Wang et al.60 demonstrated that the products are characterized by ordered mesoporous structures, stable intermetallic phases, and fine-tuned substituted metals. These multiple synergistical advantages enable the ordered mesoporous intermetallic PtZnCo (MI-PtZnCo) trimetals to have the best activity and robust stablity for HER electrocatalysis over a wide pH range (Fig. 8a–d). It is worth mentioning that the author's previous work on Ir3V (ref. 23) showed that structurally ordered Ir3V nanoparticle catalysts have the maximum number of synergistic neighboring Ir/V sites relative to disordered solid-solution structures, thus maximizing the number of active sites that enhances the alkaline HER activity. In addition, the charge redistribution on the surface of the ordered structure promotes water dissociation on the electron-deficient V sites, significantly enhancing HER kinetics under alkaline conditions. Similar conclusions were also reported by Cheng et al.73 In acidic systems, the ordered Pt3Co/NG-700 electrocatalyst exhibited higher mass activity than the disordered Pt3Co electrocatalyst and the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. The exceptional HER performance of the Pt3Co/NG-700 electrocatalyst originates from the charge redistribution of Pt induced by Co in the structurally ordered Pt3Co intermetallic nanoparticles. The charge redistribution of Pt facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of H* and provides higher electron transfer and better conductivity, thereby achieving an efficient HER.

The electron transfer can be well regulated by adjusting the content ratio of alloy components. From the work of Zhong et al.,90 compared with IrSb without the Rh element, in 0.5 M H2SO4, Ir0.7Rh0.3Sb exhibits excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 22 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 47.6 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8e–i). We all know that an ideal HER catalyst should have neither too weak nor too strong H adsorption to ensure a dynamic balance between proton capture and hydrogen release. Therefore, the optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy ΔGH* is thermally neutral.80,130,131 Here, on the one hand, when the component of the intermetallic compound is IrSb, the transfer of electrons from Sb to Ir causes the Ir atom to assume a negative valence state leading to the enhancement of the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the Ir site due to the accumulation of electrons. On the other hand, when Rh is added to the above component, the substitution of Rh alleviates the unfavorable thermodynamic constraints provided by the Sb and Ir sites due to the moderate adsorption capacity, resulting in a further optimization of the adsorption performance of the active H species in the HER (Fig. 8j and k).

Interface assembly engineering. The surface interface of nanocatalysts is the place where electrocatalytic reactions occur. The reactants, intermediates and products of electrocatalysis are diffused to the catalyst surface or the electrolyte through the interfacial microenvironment. The interfacial microenvironment structure has a very important effect on the internal reaction and transfer process. Recently, various interface assembly engineering strategies47,48,51,52,77,87,93 have been proved to be applicable to the synthesis of water splitting catalysts due to their effective optimization of the electronic structure of catalysts and improvement of the catalytic active site density and electron conductivity. As shown in Fig. 9a–e, a typical example from Huang et al.51 is the NiOx/Pt–Ni interface obtained after a simple thermal annealing of Pt–Ni alloy nanowires loaded on a carbon substrate (Pt–Ni NWs/C-air). This phase and interface engineered Pt–Ni NW/C-air electrocatalyst has excellent HER performance that is far superior to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solutions, especially the Pt3Ni3 phase, which has an overpotential of only 40 mA in 1 M KOH when the current density is 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9f). This is due to the transformation of the alloy phase after thermal annealing along with the formation of a high density of the NiOx/Pt–Ni interface (Fig. 9g). As the Ni content in PtNi NWs/C-air increases, the NiOx density at the interface increases, which can provide more sites to adsorb OH− in a timely manner, thus improving the HER performance. Later, the group prepared Pt3Ni/NiS interface nanowires by sulfidation,47 and the interfacial effect of NiS and Pt3Ni contributed to the excellent hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst in both acidic and basic media (Fig. 9h and i). Similar to the above example, Cheng et al.48 also designed an efficient Pt–Co/CoOx/C catalyst by constructing the interface between Pt–Co alloy and amorphous CoOx in situ, which reduces the dissociation energy of water.

Of course, besides constructing the alloy-metal oxide interface, the interface can also be created to promote the HER by making reasonable modifications on the alloy surface. For example, Qu et al.52 reported the improvement of the HER in alkaline solutions using NiMo electrocatalysts with amine modulation/engineered interfaces (Fig. 10a). Experimental results showed that primary amines hindered the reaction while diamines significantly promoted the HER activity. A comparison of various amine modifications revealed that NiMo modified with ethylenediamine (EDA) had the best HER activity with the lowest overpotential (72 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was 268 mV lower than that of unmodified NiMo (Fig. 10b). This is because diamine modification can regulate the interfacial properties of NiMo by reducing the charge transfer resistance and adjusting the electronic structure of the active site at the interface. Chen et al.93 showed that the PdMnCo alloy/pyridinic nitrogen-doped carbon interfaces weaken the hydrogen-adsorption energy on the catalyst and thus optimize the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate state (ΔGH*), leading to a remarkable electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 10c).

3.2 Composition tuning
Structural tuning is mainly to improve the catalytic activity by increasing the number and density of active sites and optimizing the electronic structure of active centers. In order to improve the intrinsic activity of catalysts, composition tuning of materials is an effective strategy to improve the catalytic performance. For alloy material systems, the current research on composition regulation mainly focuses on the synergistic effect (including the synergistic effect between metals,23,26,27,31,32,34,35,49,50,132–135 alloys and carriers,54–57,79,80,130,131 and alloys and structures)92,136–138 doping effect61,95,97,98,139–142 and multisite effect.64–72,99–103,143
Synergistic effect. Bonding dissimilar elements to provide synergistic effects is an effective way to improve the performance of metal catalysts. In the study of Ir-based alloys, the author found that only the Ir–V alloy formed by the alloying of different transition metals with Ir showed the best performance in the alkaline HER.23 The vanadium element has high oxophilicity, particularly, the metal–OH bond strength for vanadium is larger than that for other transition metals (Fig. 11a). Similarly, Li et al.31 demonstrated that appropriate Ni/Mo alloying can significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance of the alkaline HER (Fig. 11b). Combined with theoretical calculation, Ni and Mo alloying significantly weakened the adsorption of hydrogen, improved the adsorption of hydroxyl, and reduced the reaction barrier of water formation. Tan et al.34 accelerated the step rate of water adsorption and activation reaction by alloying Ru and Cu, optimized the hydrogen bond energy on the active sites of Cu and Ru, and improved the intrinsic activity of the HER. Lou et al.32 induced the adsorption free energy of hydrogen intermediates and multiple active sites to approach thermodynamic neutrality by alloying Pt and Co, thereby greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the HER. More recently, based on the HER, Yamamoto et al.134 have shown that bimetallic subnanoparticles always produce greater synergistic effects than bimetallic nanoparticles, and the greatest synergistic effect was found for the combination of Pt and Zr (Fig. 11c).

The supported nanomaterial catalysts exhibit excellent HER properties because the interfacial interaction between the active metal and the substrate can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the active site. A classic example54 is the application of the nanoporous Cu-supported intermetallic compound Co3Mo to water electrolysis. The intrinsic activity of the alloy works with the fast electron-transfer and mass-transport pathways of the carrier's hierarchical nanoporous copper skeleton, exhibiting negligible onset overpotentials and low Tafel slopes. Qin et al.80 prepared a three-component heterogeneous catalyst, PtCu alloy hollow nanospheres supported on a WO3 nano-array on Cu foam (PtCu/WO3@CF), by electrochemical deposition. In 0.5 M H2SO4, PtCu/WO3@CF has an extremely high Pt mass activity at the overpotential of 20 and 100 mV. DFT calculations reveal that the synergy between WO3 and Pt is responsible for the high HER activity where the hydrogen spillover effect triggers the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism and promotes the rapid removal of H* from Pt to re-expose the active sites (Fig. 12a). In the PtCu–Mo2C heterostructure prepared by Mu et al.74 using an elaborate mild-temperature reduction reaction method, Mo2C promotes the formation of electron-rich regions of PtCu, optimizing the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and exhibiting lower thermodynamic energy barriers compared to the two independent structures, thereby promoting high HER activity.

Carbon materials have been widely used in the preparation of electrocatalysts because of their excellent conductivity, large specific surface area and high adjustability, such as fewer carbon shells, which can directly improve the catalytic activity due to the modulation of electron density and the surface electronic distribution of penetrating electrons from the metal cores. Few carbon-layer-encapsulated NiFe nanoparticles (NiFe@C) synthesized by Kim et al.57 exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution for the HER (Fig. 12b). The excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of alloys and carriers, that is, positive charge active regions derived from Fe(III) species in NiFe nanoparticles and enhanced electron penetration from the core metal to the catalyst surface, resulting from the thin layer of carbon in the outer layer of the metal.
In this review, the structure of the alloy refers to the crystalline structure unless otherwise specified. The inhomogeneity of the crystalline alloy plays a key role in improving the catalytic performance by changing its chemical or defect microstructure,144 which contributes to the increased density of active sites. In the case of amorphous alloys, they have a homogeneous disordered structure (e.g., no compositional variations and no defects like crystalline materials). Due to their unique isotropic structure, amorphous materials have considerable advantages in surface reactivity, electron transfer, and corrosion resistance, which make them ideal candidates for pursuing active and durable electrocatalysts.41,145 Metallic glass is a general term for amorphous single metals and alloys, as well as M–X (X = B/P).146 Studies show that M–X metallic glass is more widely used in the HER than amorphous alloys.147 A typical case of the application of amorphous alloys in the HER in recent years, Liu et al.92 prepared an Ir25Ni33Ta42 amorphous alloy thin film by ion beam sputtering deposition (Fig. 13a–e), and tested the HER intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of the new material system Ir–Ni–Ta under acidic conditions. The thickness of the Ir25Ni33Ta42 amorphous alloy film is 15 nm, showing a flatness close to atomic level, and the loading capacity of Ir is about 8.14 μg cm−2 (Fig. 13f and g). In the environment of 0.5 M H2SO4, the Ir25Ni33Ta42 amorphous alloy film only needs 99 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2. Although the activity is not as good as that of the Pt film (overpotential 46 mV) and Ir film (overpotential 59 mV) prepared under the same conditions, it is better than phosphide film materials such as CoP (202 mV). Subsequent stability tests show that Ir25Ni33Ta42 amorphous alloy films have higher catalytic stability than Pt and Ir.

Doping effect. The doping of elements in the alloy system is mainly divided into metal elements and non-metal elements. The introduction of metal elements can increase the number of active sites and optimize the Gibbs free energy of reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity.148 The addition of transition metals can change the electronic environment around the active center (such as d-band center), increase the concentration of surface active species (such as surface OH groups), and optimize the geometric configuration of the active site (such as atomic distance, coordination number, etc.). To this end, Qiao et al.95 reported transition metal-doped RuIr alloy electrocatalysts (M-RuIr, M = Co, Ni, Fe), which achieved the dual functionality of electrocatalysts through electronic structure regulation and the resulting special physicochemical properties. The results of electrochemical tests showed that the activity order of the catalyst was Co-RuIr > Ni-RuIr > RuIr > Fe-RuIr (Fig. 14a and b). Due to the optimized chemical state/valence state, Co-RuIr exhibits extremely high OER/HER/total water splitting activity in 0.1 M HClO4 solution (the overpotential for the OER/HER current density to reach 10 mA cm−2 is 235 mV/14 mV, the cell voltage reaching 10 mA cm−2 during the whole water splitting process is only 1.52 V, and the stability test is over 25 h). The doping of transition metal Co has a dual effect: under OER conditions, the dissolution of Co causes the increase of surface OI− concentration, which enhances the OER catalytic activity; under HER conditions, the charge transfer triggered by Co doping regulates the valence state of the catalyst surface sites, which regulates the hydrogen adsorption capacity and enhances the HER catalytic activity (Fig. 14c). Cr, Mo and W elements belong to the same group (VIB) and they may exhibit similar eg orbitals that can adsorb and bind to surface atoms and affect the binding of reaction intermediates.149,150 However, the different outermost orbital structures may make them exhibit different modulation effects. Based on this, Zhang et al.139 demonstrated that doping with group VIB elements can significantly affect the ΔGH* value of the host NiCo alloy, while W-NiCo is obviously closest to the peak of the “volcano” curve, showing the most effective doping effect (Fig. 14d–f).

It is well known that introducing non-metallic elements (such as N, S, and B) into catalysts is an important strategy to improve the catalytic activity of the HER,151,152 so doping non-metallic elements into alloys is also a feasible method to improve the intrinsic activity of alloys. Taking N doping as an example, the doping effect of alloy catalysts doped with non-metallic elements in the hydrogen evolution reaction is briefly explained. Kang et al. prepared a N-doped PtRu single atom alloy by heat treatment, and only needed an ultra-small overcurrent of 15 mV in 1.0 M KOH to provide a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER.142 When doping N elements into a PtRu single atom alloy, the incorporation of N causes the d orbital of Ru to shift downward, making the symmetry of the d orbital of Ru more suitable for the p orbital of H2O, and accelerating the water dissociation kinetics on the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, the monodisperse Pt atoms lower the dissociation energy barrier of water and promote the desorption of H2.

Multisite effect. The construction of multimetallic electrocatalysts can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics and improve the electrocatalytic activity. HEAs have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis due to their unique advantages (tunable composition, complex surface, high tolerance, etc.).153 Based on the structure of HEAs, researchers have identified four “core effects” that distinguish HEAs from conventional alloys, including high entropy effect, lattice distortion effect, sluggish diffusion, and “cocktail” effect.154 Therfore, as a master of multisite effects, HEAs will be analyzed as the focus in this section. It is true that Pt is still considered to be the most efficient HER electrocatalyst for precious metal-based catalysts, but its practical application is limited by its high cost and low availability. One of the most effective ways to improve the HER activity at low Pt dosage is to introduce other inexpensive metals into Pt to create a multisite effect thereby effectively optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediates on the active site and thus improving the electrocatalytic activity.64–66,68,71,72,99,102 Furthermore, considerable research efforts have been focused on exploring cost-effective Pt-free non-precious metal electrocatalysts in order to replace the high-cost Pt-based materials.67,69,70,100,101 It is worth mentioning that obtaining HEA nanomaterials containing five or more elements is also a heavy research challenge. Due to the differences in the properties of HEA precursor salts (such as reduction potential, thermal decomposition temperature, etc.), they are difficult to decompose or reduce simultaneously, so phase-separated products tend to form. However, this review aims to highlight the discussion of the multisite effect caused by the high-entropy strategy on the improvement of HER performance, so this aspect will not be repeated. However, this review aims to highlight the exploration of the multisite effect on HER performance enhancement due to the high entropy strategy, so this aspect will not be elaborated.In terms of Pt-based HEAs, Wang et al.68 synthesized uniform and ultrasmall (~3.4 nm) HEA Pt18Ni26Fe15Co14Cu27 nanoparticles with a simple low-temperature oil phase strategy at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 15a). Based on the research findings, the Pt18Ni26Fe15Co14Cu27/C catalyst displays exceptionally high HER activity in alkaline environments (Fig. 15b). The catalyst exhibits an activity of 10.96 A mg−1 Pt at −0.07 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, while maintaining good stability. The efficiency of water-splitting and subsequent proton transfer in the HER process is determined by the initial adsorption of water. During the water adsorption process, a noticeable downshift in the s and p orbitals of H2O indicates the active electron transfer from the HEA to water for achieving stable adsorption. This establishes a solid foundation for the subsequent water dissociation process (Fig. 15c). DFT has substantiated that the presence of multiple active sites on the catalyst's surface and the rapid transfer of electrons between these sites are the crucial factors for achieving the efficient conversion of protons and intermediate products (Fig. 15d–f). Alloys with high-entropy disordered amorphous structures are also used for electrocatalytic water splitting. Dick et al.66 synthesized high-entropy metallic glass nanoparticles with up to 8 equimolar components by electrodepositing multiple metal salt precursors confined in water-in-chloroform emulsion droplets (Fig. 16a). The CoFeLaNiPt high-entropy alloy was synthesized and its electrochemical surface area was calculated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the high-entropy metallic glass alloy synthesized by nanoparticle-mediated electrodeposition had a higher electrochemical surface area. The CoFeLaNiPt high-entropy metallic glass alloy system provides multifunctional activity for the HER and OER by combining the electrocatalytic properties of transition and noble metals (Fig. 16b).

In the case of Pt-free non-precious metal-based HEAs, a typical example is the design and synthesis of a non-precious metal-based high-entropy intermetallic compound (HEI) FeCoNiAlTi by Liu et al.67 using the concept of high entropy and isolated sites. As shown in Fig. 17a, FeCoNiAlTi was proven to have an ordered crystallographic structure and a site occupancy of the L12-type structure, which exhibits hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance comparable to that of the precious metal Pt (Fig. 17b). The overpotential and Tafel slope of the compound in the alkaline HER are 88.2 mV and 40.1 mV dec−1, respectively. Results from the chronocurrent test indicate that the compound can remain stable for 40 hours at current densities of 20 and 100 mA cm−2. To reveal the HER catalytic mechanism of the FeCoNiAlTi HEI (Fig. 17c), DFT simulations were performed on the coordination environment of each metal element and found that its unique L12-type ordered structure can further stabilize the adsorption and desorption of H2O/H*, with an optimal HER energy barrier. Theoretical calculations suggest that the synergistic effect between the chemical complexity of the high-entropy intermetallic compound and its specific atomic configuration is beneficial for the regulation of its electronic structure.

4. Summary and outlook
In the clean energy economy, many countries have started to utilize hydrogen as a primary energy source to replace petroleum and natural gas. Among various hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis technology stands out as an unparalleled method driven by electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, with no greenhouse gas emissions. The development of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is crucial for the practical application of this technology. In this review, we systematically discuss the rational design principles of NAEs for the HER in water electrolysis. We focus on strategies for structural and compositional tuning of electrocatalysts, aiming to guide the design of HER nano-alloy materials with excellent activity and durability by deepening the understanding of the relationship between alloy structure and electrochemical performance. In terms of structural tuning, unique shape design, core–shell structure construction, interface assembly engineering, and alloy ordering are employed to optimize the surface electronic structure of the catalyst and enhance the catalytic activity of single active sites. In terms of compositional tuning, synergistic effects, doping effects, and multisite effects are utilized to improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Alloy materials are commonly regarded as a means to alter the charge distribution near the active center and optimize the interaction between metal atoms and hydrogen, thereby accelerating the kinetic rate of the HER. Particularly in alkaline environments, the dissociation of water is often a crucial step affecting the HER rate. For example, by tuning the composition, we can optimize the active sites for H2O adsorption and dissociation, or by controlling the structure, we can obtain alloys with ordered structures or unique morphologies, greatly enhancing the reaction rate in alkaline and neutral environments.
Although some progress has been made in the development of NAEs for the HER, further efforts are needed to understand the relationship between alloy structures and the specific processes occurring in the reaction in order to design more rational NAEs. Characterization methods for studying NAE structures can include in situ monitoring techniques, such as in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which analyze the electronic valence, coordination structure, spatial information, and atomic bond lengths of catalysts. DFT calculations can be used to analyze the possible paths and adsorption free energies of the HER reaction process in optimized catalyst systems, and then link these calculations to experimental results to explain the mechanism behind efficient catalytic hydrogen evolution. However, as electrocatalyst systems become more complex with a greater variety of elements, especially in the case of high-entropy materials, it becomes challenging to identify the true active sites. Therefore, developing new characterization techniques to accurately determine active sites is crucial for studying and improving the activity of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, due to the complexity and interactions in alloy systems, we have found from previous reviews that different alloy systems exhibit different HER mechanisms, which brings confusion to our understanding of the HER mechanism. Therefore, the following suggestions may be relevant for future research on how to better study the HER reaction mechanism through the rational design of nanoalloy catalysts. From the perspective of applying intelligent methods, advanced computational methods and predictive approaches can be employed to facilitate the rational design of nanoalloy catalysts, reducing the trial-and-error nature of material synthesis and greatly shortening the exploration period in catalyst preparation. DFT calculations, high-throughput methods, machine learning, and their combinations can play important roles in studying the HER reaction mechanism in alloy systems. From the development of characterization techniques, considering the dynamic nature of the HER, in situ monitoring techniques should be employed instead of relying solely on ex situ characterization, which can only provide information before and after the reaction and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism. In situ techniques can provide more complete insights into the microstructure evolution of surface atomic layers and the reaction intermediates adsorbed on the catalyst surface during the HER process, which are crucial for understanding the real HER reaction mechanism.
In order to better promote the industrial application of water electrolysis, the stability of electrocatalysts is crucial for the practical implementation of water splitting systems, especially under high current density and harsh electrolyte environments. Long-term stable operation at high current density is an important requirement for electrocatalysts, which necessitates high structural strength and excellent corrosion resistance. However, the stability assessment of most HER electrocatalysts is conducted at current densities below 1000 mA cm−2, and they exhibit poor durability, such as less than a week or even shorter, which is detrimental to the design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts. Furthermore, standardized testing protocols should be employed for stability testing since most research focuses on designing and synthesizing electrocatalysts with extremely high HER catalytic activity, and it is common to use mild testing conditions in stability studies. The catalytic durability of these electrocatalysts is usually tested only for short periods, far from meeting the requirements of practical applications. Additionally, there is limited research in the literature regarding the deactivation mechanisms of HER electrocatalysts under different electrolyte conditions, which hinders further development of HER electrocatalysts with high stability. In addition to the focus on the structure–performance relationships in electrocatalysts, it is worth mentioning that the majority of electrocatalysts studied in the laboratory are predominantly in powdered form, suitable only for low-current hydrogen production. However, powdered catalysts require the addition of binders during the electrode preparation process, which increases resistance to charge transfer and makes them prone to detachment during the gas generation process, thereby making it difficult to meet the high-power hydrogen production requirements in industrial applications. Therefore, it is necessary to develop binder-free self-supporting electrocatalysts.
In summary, this review contributes to providing readers with a systematic understanding of the application of alloys in the HER. We hope that this review will bring new insights to readers and inspire further efforts to discover and comprehend alloy electrocatalysts, thus promoting the profound development of this research field.
