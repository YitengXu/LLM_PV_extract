    , Accepted 10th August 2016First published on 10th August 2016AbstractDecatungstate acid (DA) was utilized to modify TiO2 in the photoanode of dye sensitized solar cells. The photo-induced electron lifetime was evidently improved and the recombination was greatly inhibited. DA can introduce levels of impurities and lower the Fermi level through a doping effect and thus increase the photocurrent. Moreover, the improved charge carrier density can be found through external electric field surface photovoltage and Mott–Schottky plots. A 22.94% enhancement in photocurrent was achieved with little degradation in photovoltage, leading to a 10.28% increase in optic-to-electric power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are low cost and promising alternatives to standard silicon photovoltaic cells. Since DSSC was first reported in 1991,1 it has attracted wide attention for its attractive features, including a simple structure, low production costs, high energy conversion efficiency, and good stability.2–4 However, the efficiency is greatly limited by a high electron–hole recombination rate or a low photogenerated charge transfer rate. There are several types of recombinations in the photoanode, and the dominant one is when the injected conduction-band electrons recombine with the oxidized species in the electrolyte.5,6 An effective way to retard the recombination by finding suitable methods to modify the TiO2 semiconductor is desirable.7–9
Recently, a new class of photoelectrochemical cells based on nanoscaled porous metal oxide semiconductors (i.e., dye-sensitized solar cells) has promoted intense research due to the prospects of cheap and efficient conversion of visible light into electricity and new applications. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of metal–oxygen cluster compounds with remarkable structural diversity and chemical composition variety, have shown unique physicochemical properties and are used in various applications.10,11 Polyoxometalates (POMs) have peculiar optoelectronic properties and high reduction potential, serving as excellent electron pools. Thus, during the recent decade, POMs have been increasingly recognized as important building blocks for highly efficient photocatalysts and photoelectrochemical devices by hybridizing with photofunctional semiconductor nanostructures and organic/inorganic molecules.12 Modification of TiO2 with POMs shows a significant change in the rate of charge recombination between injected electrons in TiO2 and the oxidized dye anchored to it following optical excitation, offering insight into the fundamental understanding of the processes occurring at the dye/semiconductor interface. POMs have several empty d-orbitals in their structures to accept electrons without structural changes.13 Recently, POMs have been widely employed as catalysts12,14 in heterogeneous reactions due to their unique structural and chemical properties, and they are expected to decrease fast electron–hole recombination on TiO2 due to their long transient lifetime. H3PW12O40-doped TiO2 has been briefly reported in a communication, and it was found that the electron lifetime became longer following an increase in the amount of the POMs with a 9.43% enhanced photocurrent.5 However, in most of the reported paper, POMs were directly composited with semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO. Moreover, an abundant crystal boundary and interface would limit the improvement of the performance.
In this study, decatungstate acid (DA) was doped into the TiO2 nano-network, and the change in photoelectrochemical properties is discussed. The optical and photoelectric properties were significantly improved. When assembled into a DSSC, DA-TiO2 with P25 as a filler exhibits a short-circuit photocurrent density as high as 19.93 mA cm−2, which is 22.94% higher than blank samples under the standard AM1.5G global solar irradiation. Furthermore, with various external electric fields, the surface photovoltage spectra of the modified samples show a quite interesting result, in which the samples give out a new visible photo-to-electric response band. In addition, DA improves the photo-induced electron lifetime and retards the recombination in dye sensitized solar cells.
Experimental
Preparation of decatungstate acid
Decatungstate acid was prepared according to a modified published procedure15 and characterized by spectral data. A solution containing Na2WO4·H2O (50 g) in distilled water (300 mL) was added into 400 mL of boiling 1 M HNO3 solution. Some yellow precipitate with high photochemical activity appeared in the resulting solution (in the presence of light such as sunlight, it would turn green). After 30 min of stirring, the precipitate was collected and washed with 1 L 0.05 M HNO3, 200 mL 95% ethanol, 100 mL 99.5% ethanol and 100 mL ethyl ether. This precipitate was filtered and dried at 100 °C for 4 h. The filtrate was placed in a freezer overnight. The absorbance spectrum of decatungstate acid consisted of well-defined maximum at 323 nm assigned to an O→W CT transition. FT-IR (KBr, cm−1): 956 (WOt); 898 and 805 (W–Ob–W).16
Preparation of DA-doped TiO2
DA was dispersed into 10 mL of distilled water, and the acidity of the solution was adjusted to pH = 2.0 using 1.5 M HClO4. To the resulting mixture, titanium isopropoxide (5 mL) mixed with 3 mL isopropanol was added dropwise, which was maintained under constant stirring for 1 h at room temperature, 3 h at 45 °C and 80 °C until gelling. After gelation, the solid was dried in vacuum at 45 °C for 12–24 h and then in air at 80 °C until completely dry. The dried gel was calcined in vacuum at 400 °C for 8 h to fasten the titania network and washed with hot water (80 °C) three times. Then, the solid was dried in air at 80 °C for 3 h. The loading of DA in the DA/TiO2 nanocomposite was approximately 10.57 wt% estimated by ICP-AES analysis.
Preparation of DSSC
Typically, for DSSC with DA-TiO2/P25, DA-TiO2 and P25 were mixed with the weight ratio of 1:1, and terpilenol and ethyl alcohol were subsequently added. With mechanical stirring for 8–12 h, the slurry would be ready for further use. All the photoanodes of the devices were prepared by screen-printing with silkscreen and sintered at 500 °C for 8 h. The photoanode area was 0.16 cm2. Optically transparent conductive electrodes were made from an F-doped SnO2-coated glass plate purchased from NSG, Japan. Two consecutive TiCl4 treatments were performed when preparing the TiO2 photoanodes for dye sensitized solar cells, one prior to and one following the screen printing of the mesoscopic (porous)-TiO2 films as reported in the literature.17 The films were immersed in a 0.3 mM N719 (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in absolute ethyl alcohol for 24 h at room temperature. The photocathodes were self-prepared with thermal decomposition of chloroplatinic acid at 500 °C, and the area was 1 cm2. After the photoanode and photocathode were fixed with two modified clips, the electrolyte that was composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, and 0.1 M TBP in 1:1 (volume ratio) acetonitrile–propylene carbonate was added. For the reference samples of DSSC, raw TiO2 and DA-TiO2 were utilized with the same procedure. All the substrates were dried by pure nitrogen after washing and treatment.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were taken using a Fei Tecnia G2-STWIN. The surface photovoltage test instrument was assembled by the Jilin University. Monochromatic light was obtained by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp through a double-prism monochromator (SBP300, China), and the signal was collected by a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained by a UV-3600 (Shimadzu, Japan). Electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained by a CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer (Chenhua, China). Mott–Schottky analyses of impedance were performed in a three-electrode cell using a platinum wire as a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.01 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 in an acetonitrile solvent. The measurements were performed at f = 200 Hz with a small amplitude of 10 mV using a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, CH Instruments). Photocurrent–photovoltage curves were recorded by an CHI660D electrochemical analyzer. The light intensity of the AM1.5 global sunlight from a filtered 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XM500, Changtuo, China with an AM1.5 global filter from Newport) was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (calibrated at National Institute of Metrology, P. R. China). IMPS under short-circuit conditions and IMVS under open-circuit conditions were carried out using the same electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6 & Zennium, Germany) with a frequency response analyzer under an intensity modulated (30–150 W m−2) white light emitting diode driven by a Zahner (XPOT) source supply. Illumination was always incident on the working electrode side of the solar cells. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1000 Hz to 0.1 Hz for IMPS and IMVS. All characterizations were carried out under ambient pressure and temperature. Based on the J–V curve, the fill factor (FF) is defined as (1)where Jmax and Vmax are the photocurrent density and photovoltage for maximum power output, and JSC and VOC are the short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage, respectively. PCE is the overall power conversion efficiency18 (Pin is the power of incident light, which is 100 mW cm−2 in this study) defined as (2)
Results and discussion
The morphology of DA-TiO2 particles was investigated by TEM, as shown in Fig. 1. These nanoparticles show shapes of nanospheres. The particle size distribution is around 14–16 nm. To investigate the composition of DA-TiO2 nanoparticles, XPS was conducted (details see Fig. S2 in ESI†). Fig. S2a† shows the XPS survey spectrum of DA-TiO2. The particles are made of Ti, O, W and C (impurity from original reagent). Moreover, the respective detailed XPS of Ti, O and W are listed in Fig. S2b–d.† All the peaks can be attributed to the standard XPS database.

Fig. 2a shows the UV-visible absorption of DA-TiO2 compared with blank samples of pure decatungstate acid and raw TiO2. For both pure DA and DA-TiO2, an absorption ranging from 300 nm to 460 nm is observed, which corresponds to a band-band transition. As the literature reports, TiO2 only absorbs UV light (λ < 387 nm) without any absorption in the visible and infrared regions, which means that TiO2 possesses a band gap energy of 3.2 eV for the anatase phase.19 However, it shows a good visible absorption when TiO2 is modified through DA. The broader absorption range can be ascribed to the narrowed band gap. The absorption coefficient of an indirect semiconductor near the absorption threshold and Kubelka–Munk function can be expressed as (3) (4)where Eg is the band gap of the indirect allowed transition (eV), h is Planck’ s constant (J·s), Bi is the absorption constant, and n is the frequency of light (s−1). Therefore, a transformed Kubelka–Munk function20,21 can be constructed by plotting [F(R∞)]1/2 against the energy of the excitation source to obtain the band gap of the modified TiO2 particles (Fig. 2b).

The band gap energy of DA and DA-TiO2 is 2.76 ± 0.02 eV and 2.98 ± 0.02 eV, respectively. Compared with raw TiO2 (3.18 ± 0.02 eV), the modified TiO2 shows a decrease in band gap. This can be attributed to the fact that DA formed a newly formed impurity level in the band gap of TiO2, which can lead to a narrowed band gap. Moreover, a narrowed band gap means that DA-TiO2 can absorb more photons with lower energies and accept the injection electrons from the dye more easily. Furthermore, DA can significantly reduce the photo-induced exciton pairs in TiO2 by absorption competition in the UV region of the solar light, leading to an extended photo-induced electron lifetime and retardation in the recombination.

Fig. 3a shows the Mott–Schottky plots (C−2vs. V) of the TiO2 film with a modification of DA from which the flat-band potential (VFB) can be obtained. Therefore, the studies of the flat-band potential provide valuable information for understanding the electron injection. The results in Fig. 3a indicate a positive shift of VFB with a modification of DA. Consequently, the driving force for electron injection, namely, the difference between flat band energy (EFB) and the LUMO,22 is increased by modifying DA, which correspondingly contributes to the enhancement of the electron-injection efficiency. On the other hand, the VOC of DSSCs is dependent on the difference between the VFB of TiO2 and the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple.21 Therefore, the VOC of DSSCs decreases because of the positive shift in VFB, as shown in Fig. 3a. Moreover, the conduction types of all the samples are confirmed as n-type according to the tendency of the curves in Fig. 3a. Donor densities were estimated from the slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots using the following equation: (5)where e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of TiO2, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the donor density, and V is the applied bias at the electrode. According to the equation, for the same host material, the larger slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots give rise to lower densities for the photoinduced carrier. As shown in Fig. 3a, the slope of raw TiO2, DA-TiO2 and DA is 3.67 ± 0.05, 3.38 ± 0.05 and 2.56 ± 0.05, respectively. Thus, DA doping can improve the carrier density of TiO2. The detailed energy level in DSSC is shown in Fig. 3b. Due to the increased driving force between the N719 dye and modified TiO2, electrons can be injected easily.

Surface photovoltage (SPV) method is a contactless and nondestructive technique. The surface photovoltage generation mainly arises from the creation of electron/hole pairs, followed by the separation under a built-in electric field (also called the space-charge layer). Thus, it can be expected that stronger surface photovoltage (SPV) responses result in higher separation efficiencies of the photoinduced charge carrier.23 In the present paper, the SPV spectra and EFISPV (electric field induced surface photovoltage) spectra were employed to investigate the behaviors of the photogenerated electrons and the photoelectric properties observed under the effect of the external bias, respectively. Fig. 4a shows the SPV signal of raw TiO2 and decatungstate acid modified TiO2. For all the samples, an obvious SPV response can be found at the wavelength range from 300 to 370 nm, which was attributed to the electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band (O 2p→Ti 3d) on the basis of the DRS spectra and TiO2 band structure. It is found that the photovoltaic action spectra follow the absorption spectra response in the UV region well, indicating that they correspond to the similar electron transition process. Compared with raw TiO2, DA-TiO2 shows an SPV peak with a slight red shift, which can be attributed to the narrowed band gap due to modification with DA. Furthermore, a new-emerging peak ranging from ca. 410 to 450 nm is ascribed to the SPV response of DA. However, the intensity of the response is not obvious enough to observe due to the bound exciton pairs.

For nanoparticles, the surface oxygen vacancies and defects can result into the occurrence of abundant surface states. Moreover, after modified with DA, the particles possess more abundant energy levels and surface states. The surface states as well as the localized energy levels of the bulk material can bind photoinduced electrons or holes to further produce free and bound excitonic pairs.24 The excitonic pairs are not easily separated under usual conditions, which can weaken the SPV response of nanoparticles such as the new SPV response band ranging from 410 to 450 nm. However, the excitonic pairs are very sensitive to an outer electrical field. An outer electrical field can help release the bound excitons. As shown in Fig. 4b and c, when an external electric field was employed, a remarkable change of the SPV response could be observed. When a positive electric field was applied, the SPV intensity was markedly enhanced, which was attributed to the same direction of the added-outer and built-in fields. Thus, n-type semiconductors can be confirmed for the two samples. Furthermore, the SPV response became broad, which was ascribed to trap-to-band transitions from the surface states. Moreover, there appears an interesting novel result in the EFISPV, wherein a new response band belonging to neither TiO2 nor DA alone can be found. As for the new response band that increases as the external electric field increases, it is due to the internal electron injection between DA and TiO2. DA induced a redox cycle in DA-TiO2 and lead to a new response band that cannot be simply attributed to either TiO2 or DA. When an external electric field was employed, an increasing SPV response occurred, which means that DA-TiO2 has the better ability to conduct electrons into the FTO substrate. Thus, DA-TiO2 performs better as a photoanode material to produce a photo-to-electric signal.

Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of a typical DSSC with a photoanode of P25, DA-TiO2 and DA-TiO2/P25. The results indicate that a DSSC with DA-TiO2 shows a short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 14.26 mA cm−2, which is only 87.97% that of the DSSC with P25. This can be ascribed to the low film quality, due to which some of the carriers cannot be conducted into the FTO substrate and the amount of the effective electrons is reduced. Moreover, due to the positive shift of the Fermi level of DA-TiO2 compared with TiO2, the VOC decreased accordingly. Caused by the decreased JSC and VOC, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) decreased to 6.35%, which is 16.34% less than that of P25. Considering the low film quality of single DA-TiO2, P25 was used as a filler to improve the film, as described above. DA-TiO2/P25 shows the highest JSC of 19.93 mA cm−2, which is 22.94% higher than that of commercial P25. Moreover, VOC value was maintained at 94.54% of that of P25. A greatly enhanced current and slight change in voltage value lead to an improved performance for the DSSC with DA-TiO2/P25 (PCE: 8.37%, 10.28% higher than that of P25).

Data shown for film thicknesses were 10 μm and cell active areas were 0.16 cm2. Data shown were obtained under AM1.5G simulated sunlight ∼100 mW cm−2 calibrated as detailed in the Experimental section. All data were obtained for non-scattering films with standard Pt counter electrodes. Each data point was the average of five cells in parallel experiments with errors below ±1%. 

Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plot and Bode plot of the DSSC with DA-TiO2, DA-TiO2/P25 and P25 as photoanode materials. Table 1 summarizes parameters of the equivalent circuit RS[C1(R1O1)](R2Q1), where R and C describe the resistance and capacitance, respectively; O, which depends on the parameters Yo,1 and B, accounts for a finite-length Warburg diffusion (ZDiff) with Q as the symbol for the constant phase. The series resistance of the system (RS) can account for the resistance of the electrolyte, the resistance within the photoelectrode film and the FTO electrode, as well as the contact resistance. RS changed from 18.11 to 18.44 Ω, which indicated that the DA-modification did not change the resistance much. The first arc in the high frequency range of the Nyquist plot (Fig. 6a) is assigned to the electron-transfer process at the electrolyte/counter–electrode interface, whose parameter R2 slightly changed for P25 (10.34 Ω) and DA-TiO2 (10.58 Ω). However, when mixed with P25, it shows a decreased value of R2, which is 8.40 Ω. A short straight line observed at high frequency is associated with the capacitance and resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface (CPE and R2 elements).25 The large semicircle at the medium frequency was attributed to the electron transfer process at the dyed-photoanode-material/electrolyte interface (capacitance, C1; charge transfer resistance, R1).25,26C1 increased from 0.56 to 1.04 mF and R1 decreased from 11.23 to 9.80 Ω by DA-modification. The decreasing value of R1 means that the recombination resistance is low at the interface of the dyed-DA-TiO2/electrolyte. In accordance with this observation, the corresponding phase angle peak in the Bode plot (Fig. 6b) shifts to a lower frequency (from 31.50 Hz to 6.64 Hz). This indicates a longer electron lifetime for the DSSC with DA-TiO2.27 From the Bode phase plots, the electron lifetime with DA-TiO2 is much longer than that obtained with commercial P25 at the same light intensity. When mixed with P25, DSSC with DA-TiO2 shows further improved performance, whose C1 is 1.25 mF and R1 is 7.99 Ω, respectively. As for the electron lifetime of DA-TiO2/P25, it falls between that of P25 and DA-TiO2. Considering the low film quality of single DA-TiO2, the DA-TiO2/P25 shows excellent impedance properties.

IMPS and IMVS are conventional methods to investigate the electron transfer and recombination process.28 To further elucidate the internal processes and effects of DA in DSSCs, the IMPS and IMVS responses were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The transport time (τd) and recombination time (τn) can be, respectively, calculated from the expression (6)where fd (fn) is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS (IMVS) imaginary component.29
 Fig. 7  (a) Transport time constant, (b) recombination time constant, and (c) charge collection efficiency for P25, DA-TiO2 and DA-TiO2/P25 cells as a function of applied voltage (or quasi Fermi energy). 

Fig. 7a and b show the recombination time and transport time based on DA-TiO2/P25, DA-TiO2 and P25 photoanodes, respectively, which are plotted as a function of the incident light intensity. τn of both the DA-modified devices is higher than that of P25, whereas τd of the two devices are lower than that of P25. This can be attributed to the excellent injection and transport of electrons of the DA-TiO2 photoanode, which suppresses the excited electrons to recombine with iodine in the interfacial region between the electrolyte and the photoanode. However, as discussed above, the film quality of the photoanode made from single DA-TiO2 is limited for agglomeration. As an additive, P25 prepared through a gas phase route was added into the photoanode as a “binder” or “filler” to reduce the macroscopic defect of the photoanode films. However, introduction of P25 would shorten the recombination time and increase the transport time to a limited extent. Fortunately, the performance is still much better than the blank sample of P25. In comparison with a pure P25 cell, the DA-TiO2/P25 cell has a shorter electron transport time and longer electron recombination time. It is noted that a shorter transport time as well as a longer electron recombination time can improve the photoelectric properties of DSSCs.
The charge collection efficiencies (ηcc) of the DSSCs are determined by the relation:30 ηcc = 1 − τd/τn(7)where τd is the charge transport time and τn is the charge recombination lifetime. Fig. 7c shows the charge collection efficiencies of DA-TiO2/P25, DA-TiO2 and P25 cells. It was found that the charge collection efficiency of both the DA-TiO2 and DA-TiO2/P25 cells is slightly higher than that of pure.
Furthermore, the electron recombination kinetics in different photoanode based cells was investigated by an open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement.31 This measurement was conducted by obtaining a steady state VOC value for the DSSC under solar light illumination, and then the decay of the VOC was monitored after the illumination was stopped. And the transient VOC as a function of time since turning off the incident light was investigated. When the illumination of cell is switched off under a steady voltage, the VOC, which is related to the electron lifetime, will decay sharply because of the electron recombination. Fig. 8a shows that the decay rate of the VOC with DA-TiO2 was much slower than that of DA-TiO2/P25 and P25. This indicates that DA can effectively inhibit the back recombination reaction between electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and oxidative species and suggest a large reduced recombination rate in the DSSCs. Although DA-TiO2 possesses such great properties, an aggregate of DA-TiO2 results in a loose interior structure and low conductive quality for the film. Thus commercial P25 was used as a filler in the film to improve the film quality. For a DSSC with the DA-TiO2/P25, it displayed a still slower decay rate (electron-recombination rate) than that of commercial P25, which confirms that the utilization of DA is advantageous for fast electron transport and retarding recombination.
 Fig. 8  The open circuit voltage decay curves of the DSSCs based on the different photoanodes (a), and the electron lifetime was determined from the open circuit voltage decay measurements (b). 
The lifetime of the photo-generated electrons (τ), which is defined as the average time that the photo-generated electrons exist before they recombine, can be calculated by the following equation, (8)where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature32 (Fig. 8b). It is evident that the τ of DSSC with DA is longer than for that with only P25. This result is in good agreement with the EIS and IMVS studies discussed above. According to these results, one can conclude that the excellent electron transport and recombination performance makes the DA-TiO2 a good candidate for efficient DSSC photoanode materials.
Conclusions
POM decatungstate acid was synthesized and introduced into a TiO2 network and finally introduced into DSSC. The Fermi level of TiO2 was lower due to DA and the driving force of electron injection from the dye molecule to TiO2 was increased significantly. Due to the internal interaction of DA and TiO2, an interesting new visible SPV response band that can be attributed to neither DA nor TiO2 can be found. As a result, a 22.94% enhancement in photocurrent was achieved with little degradation in photovoltage, leading to a 10.28% increase in optic-to-electric power conversion efficiency.

 	Fig. 3  Mott–Schottky plots (a) for an as-prepared DA film and DA-TiO2 film in 0.01 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile solvent at f = 200 Hz with a small amplitude of 10 mV with a raw TiO2 film as a reference and possible process in modified DSSC (b).	 

 	Fig. 4  SPV spectra (a) and EFISPV spectra of raw TiO2 (b) and DA-TiO2 (c).	 

 	Fig. 5  Current–voltage characteristics of typical dye sensitized solar cells fabricated employing different photoanode films. Data shown for film thicknesses were 10 μm and cell active areas were 0.16 cm2. Data shown were obtained under AM1.5G simulated sunlight ∼100 mW cm−2 calibrated as detailed in the Experimental section. All data were obtained for non-scattering films with standard Pt counter electrodes. Each data point was the average of five cells in parallel experiments with errors below ±1%.	 

 	Fig. 6  Nyquist plots (a) and bode plots (b) of the DSSCs based on the P25, DA-TiO2 and DA-TiO2/P25 films measured under the illumination of one sun (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at a −0.8 V bias.
