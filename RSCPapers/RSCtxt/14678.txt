    , Accepted 15th February 2017First published on 15th February 2017AbstractA facile chemical method is developed for the fabrication of Sb2S3 film with a lateral grain size as large as ∼12 μm. A solar cell based on this Sb2S3 film achieves a power conversion efficiency of 4.3%, which is the highest value in solution processed planar heterojunction solar cells based on Sb2S3 film.
The exploration of low-cost, stable, and efficient solar cell materials is one of the significant targets in solar energy applications.1 In this perspective, several classes of semiconducting materials such as silicon, CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGS), Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTS), organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite and conjugated polymers have been exploited as light absorption materials with specially designed device configurations.1,2 Recently, antimony sulphide, Sb2S3, has attracted intense attention due to its suitable band gap (∼1.7 eV), low-toxicity, high absorption coefficient in the visible region (1.8 × 105 cm−1 at 450 nm), and, more importantly, excellent moisture and air stability.3–5
The major tasks in the application of a new material for high efficiency solar device are to develop appropriate synthetic method, good film formation approach and efficient device structure. Sb2S3 is usually applied in either planar heterojunction structure6–8 or sensitized device configuration.9–12 Although the sensitized device structure is able to deliver a relatively higher efficiency of around 3–7%, the device fabrication is complicated, the high degree infiltration of hole transporting materials is challenging, and the large surface area of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network inevitably induces a huge amount of defect states on the surface of Sb2S3,13,14 all of which impede the enhancement on final power conversion efficiency (PCE). In comparison, planar heterojunction solar cell is advantageous in terms of simplified device fabrication and cost reduction. More importantly, absorbing film with large grain size domain can be expected in this device configuration. Both vapour deposition and solution process have been applied for the fabrication of Sb2S3 film in planar heterojunction solar cells. For example, following the successful fabrication of Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells by rapid thermal evaporation (RTE),15 Sb2S3 film was also prepared by RTE for planar heterojunction solar cells and generated a PCE of 3.5%.16 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical bath deposition (CBD) methods have also been applied for the fabrication of Sb2S3 films.6 However, the ALD approach requires high cost apparatus and the deposition rate is rather slow. The CBD approach, on the other hand, is convenient and employs simple synthetic equipment; the efficiency obtained from this method is in the range of 2%–4%.7,17
Herein, we demonstrate a fast chemical approach (abbreviated as FCA) towards Sb2S3 light absorption film for efficient planar heterojunction solar cells. Thermal decomposition of metal–organic molecular precursors for the preparation of light absorption films is an effective route in solar cell fabrication.18–22 In the present study, low cost Sb2O3 is used as a Sb-source that is dissolved in carbon disulphide (CS2) and n-butylamine mixed solution, forming an antimony-complex precursor solution. By spin-coating the precursor solution on a substrate and annealing at 300 °C for only 2 min, Sb2S3 film with a lateral grain size up to 12 μm can be obtained. A solar cell based on this Sb2S3 film delivers a PCE of 4.3%. Electrochemical characterization shows that the reduced recombination probability is responsible for the improved performance.
Specifically, a precursor solution composed of diluted CS2 in ethanol was firstly prepared. Sb2O3 powder was then dispersed in the solution. Afterwards, n-butylamine was introduced into the mixed solution in a dropwise manner. The solution was further stirred for another 30 min to obtain a clear solution (Fig. 1). In this system, the reaction between CS2 and n-butylamine generates butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA) (Fig. 1). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the appearance of all vibrational modes of BDCA (Fig. S1†).21,23 This kind of thiol-amine acid is highly active so it can react with a series of metal oxides and metal hydroxides to form an organometallic complex.19,21,23 Herein, the Sb-complex is antimony butyldithiocarbamates (Sb(S2CNHC4H9)3).

To study the thermal decomposition behaviour of the Sb-complex, we conducted thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis coupled with X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. Before TGA measurement, Sb-complex solution was dried at 100 °C for ∼24 h. The first stage of weight loss from 150 °C to 177 °C is primarily owing to the evaporation of the residual solvent (Fig. 2a). In this step, a dark yellow powder is formed and there is no diffraction peak observed from XRD characterization (data not shown). The significant weight loss occurs from 177 to 220 °C. To examine the detailed compositional change in this period, we collected samples at 200 and 220 °C for XRD characterization. At 200 °C, there is still a dark yellow amorphous product without discerned diffraction peaks (Fig. 2b). Once the sample was annealed at 220 °C, a series of diffraction peaks at 15.7°, 17.6°, 22.4°, 25.0°, 28.6°, and 35.6° were observed. The detailed index is provided in Fig. 2b, corresponding to a stibnite Sb2S3 structure.10 When the temperature reaches 250 °C, a negligible weight loss is observed. The XRD pattern in this step is slightly stronger than that at 220 °C, along with the appearance of a peak at 11.1°, which is indexed as (110) of stibnite Sb2S3. Further increasing the temperature to 280 °C and 300 °C does not cause weight loss, and the XRD patterns remain nearly unchanged, indicating that the reaction and crystallization are completed. Actually, in our experiment, at even higher temperatures the crystallinity does not show improvement, but the film fabrication at high temperatures is rather poor.

Temperature-dependent surface morphology evolution during Sb2S3 film formation was characterized by SEM. At 200 °C, the film displays a rough surface with many pin holes (Fig. 3a). Once the temperature was increased to 250 °C, small particles looked melted together (Fig. 3b). At 300 °C, further agglomeration occurs and generates a uniform surface morphology with lateral grain sizes as large as ∼12 μm, and the average size is about 6 μm (Fig. 3c and S2†). In the previous synthesis of CIGS and CZTS films using a similar method, the grain is relatively small at nanometer scale; the formation of a large grain size requires post-selenization at around 500 °C for tens of min, while it can only reach 1–2 μm.24,25 The synthesis of large grain of Sb2S3 herein is unique, and this is most likely due to the low melting point of bulk Sb2S3 (550 °C), which is much lower than those of CIGS and CZTS (990–1070 °C and 990 °C, respectively). Furthermore, the particle size of Sb2S3 film is around tens of nanometers (Fig. 3b), and the nanoscale domain size would facilitate the melting and crystal growth at a temperature significantly lower than its bulk melting point. In solar cell fabrication, a large grain is favourable for the charge transport across the film.

For optimized device fabrication, the Sb2S3 film was prepared by spin-casting the Sb-complex solution at 8000 rpm for 30 s onto the TiO2 compact layer, followed by annealing at 300 °C for 2 min. The Sb2S3 film displays a uniform surface morphology (Fig. 3c and S2†). The device was completed by coating a layer of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) as hole transporting material, followed by thermal deposition of Au film as back contact. The cross-section of the device is shown in Fig. S3,†Fig. 3d shows the enlarged image of TiO2/Sb2S3/HTM, where the thickness of Sb2S3 film is ∼137 nm. Photocurrent density–voltage measurement was conducted under standard AM 1.5 one Sun illumination (Fig. 4a). The device delivers a short-current density (JSC) of 12.93 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.63 V, fill factor of 52.43%, corresponding to a PCE of 4.3%. The device parameters are summarized in Table 1. We also conducted an initial examination of the stability of a complete device without any sealing, storing in air with moderate humidity. After one month, the device exhibits a PCE of 4.1% (Fig. 4a), with JSC of 12.63 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.65 V and fill factor of 49.89%. It can be seen that the overall PCE shows only a slight decrease (4.65% degradation), indicating the excellent stability of Sb2S3 based solar cells.

For comparison, we also prepared Sb2S3 film by the conventional CBD method with the same device configuration. The surface morphology is shown in Fig. S4,† and the cross section image is shown in Fig. S5† and Fig. 3e. This device exhibits an optimized PCE of 2.0% with JSC of 9.41 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.675 V, and fill factor of 31.97%. This performance is comparable to the device with CBD prepared Sb2S3 film.7 It can be seen that our FCA for the synthesis of Sb2S3 film markedly outperforms the conventional CBD method for solar cell fabrication (Table 1).
External quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization of the devices is shown in Fig. 4b. For both the devices with Sb2S3 films fabricated by FCA and CBD methods, the onset IPCE is located at 750 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.65 eV. This result is also consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the Sb2S3 film (Fig. S6†) and reported results in the literature.4,7 It can been seen from Fig. 4b that the photocurrent generation of the device based on the FCA synthesized Sb2S3 film is essentially higher than that based on the CBD fabricated film, which is consistent with the JSC change in the J–V measurement (Fig. 4a).
To probe the reason why the FCA fabricated device is better than the conventional CBD prepared one, we extract the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of the devices from the J–V measurement. The RS of the device based on the CBD fabricated film is 52.8 Ω cm2, while that based on the FCA method exhibits a RS of 10.0 Ω cm2 (Table 1). The considerably reduced RS is mainly owing to the large lateral grain size of the FCA prepared Sb2S3 film (∼6 μm on average). From the cross sectional SEM images in Fig. 3d, the FCA-prepared Sb2S3 shows a large grain size with some of the Sb2S3 grain across the film. However, the CBD-prepared Sb2S3 film displays a small grain size at 20–50 nm (Fig. 3e). The small grain size would generate a great amount of grain boundaries, which thus increases the RS. Since the fill factor of a device is dependent on RS, the reduced RS contributes to the essentially improved fill factor in the device based on the FCA fabricated Sb2S3 film. On the other hand, the RSH of the device based on the FCA prepared Sb2S3 is 472.0 Ω cm2, while the CBD prepared film generates a RSH of 157.5 Ω cm2. The larger RSH suggests enhanced recombination resistance, which increases the charge collection efficiency and thus contributes to the overall device performance.
Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) under a reverse potential of 0.6 V was also measured to further investigate the charge transport and interfacial charge transfer process in the two types of devices (Fig. 5). Since the device structure is identical to the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell, we employ the same equivalent circuit for Sb2S3 solar cells herein (inset in Fig. 5).26,27R1 is sheet resistance, stemming mainly from the FTO substrate. The high frequency feature is ascribed to contact resistance (R2), associated with TiO2/Sb2S3 and Sb2S3/HTM interfaces. For the two devices (FCA and CBD), the fitted values are 2.73 KΩ and 9.24 KΩ, indicating that the former device possesses a better interfacial contact. The R3 is related to the recombination resistance in the devices. The R3 of the devices based on FCA and CBD prepared films are 1.64 kΩ and 0.70 kΩ, respectively. This result suggests that an essentially suppressed recombination is achieved in the device based on FCA prepared Sb2S3 film. To further confirm this result, J–V response in the dark was also measured (Fig. S7†). It can be seen that the dark current of the device with Sb2S3 film fabricated by the CBD method is significantly larger than that fabricated by the FCA method, indicating that the current leakage in former device is more pronounced. This observation also suggests that the recombination resistance in the device with FCA-fabricated Sb2S3 film is larger than that with CBD fabricated Sb2S3 film, in line with recombination resistance change in the EIS measurement. In this case, the large grain size of FCA prepared Sb2S3 film is ascribed to the impeded recombination probability, which is also in agreement with the RSH variation obtained from the J–V measurement (Table 1).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a convenient chemical approach for the fabrication of Sb2S3 film for high performance planar heterojunction solar cells. The Sb2S3 film exhibits a very large lateral grain size up to 12 μm. Due to the reduced grain boundaries, the charge transport becomes efficient, which in turn leads to an enhanced fill factor of the solar cells and a PCE of 4.3%. This efficiency is the highest value in solution processed planar heterojunction solar cells based on Sb2S3 active layer. Our initial stability examination shows that the device based on Sb2S3 possesses good air and moisture stability, showing great potential in practical applications. Optimization of electron and hole transporting materials and interfacial engineering is expected to further boost efficiency. The high quality of Sb2S3 film obtained in this research would facilitate future research with regard to efficiency improvement.
