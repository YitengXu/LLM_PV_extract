    , Accepted 6th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractIn organic solar cells (OSCs), interlayers play a critical role in achieving good device performance and stability. However, the effects of hydrogen bonds between the interlayer and the active layer are less studied. In this work, a new interlayer modification strategy through hydrogen bonds is presented, and the interaction mechanism between the interlayer and the active layer is deeply analyzed. We use a new hydrogen-bond-induced interfacial material, 1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2N-SAM), as an interlayer and fabricate a high-power conversion efficiency of 16.03% in OSCs (compared to the 14.50% of pristine ZnO-based OSCs) based on PM6:Y6. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the N–H bonds of 2N-SAM and the F atoms of acceptor Y6, achieving a vertical phase separation in the active layer of the acceptor enrichment at the cathode and improving the transportation of electrons. Finally, the short-circuit current (JSC) is dramatically increased from 24.73 mA cm−2 to 27.08 mA cm−2. This demonstrates that hydrogen bonding between the interlayer and the active layer is a potential means to improve the performance of OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), with their advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and semitransparent, have been considered potential substitutes for conventional silicon solar cells.1–4 Additionally, OSCs have made significant breakthroughs and have experienced rapid development, with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%,5–7 which demonstrates a bright future for OSCs. In inverted OSCs, metal oxide semiconductors such as SnO2 and ZnO are widely used as electron transport layers (ETLs) due to their simple solution processes, high optical transparency, and environmentally friendly nature.8–11 However, intrinsic incompatibilities between inorganic metal oxide ETLs and the organic active layer negatively affect the charge transport, which is the reason for the relative inferior efficiency of inverted OSCs as compared to that of conventional OSCs. Thus, the interlayer between the active layer and the electrode is significant for the further improvement of OSCs.12
Nowadays, increasing research is being conducted on interface modification to improve OSC performance. The role of the interlayer is diverse and complex. Thus, the mechanism regulating the interaction between the interlayer material and the active layer has not been fully rationalized.13,14 The existing studies majorly focus on modifying ETLs, such as by down-shifting the work function (WF),15,16 passivating the surface of ETLs and improving their properties such as wettability and conductivity.17–20 Layers added on ZnO can be self-assembled monolayers (SAMs),17,21 small molecules22,23 or metal oxides.24,25 However, the interaction between the interlayer and the active layer is less studied. Intermolecular forces like van der Waals forces, ion–dipole forces, and hydrogen bonding exist everywhere in nature. When compared to intramolecular forces, intermolecular forces are relatively weak and can therefore form spontaneously and tendentiously. A hydrogen bond is formed between a hydrogen atom that is bonded to an electronegative atom and another electronegative atom, such as nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F). Recently, hydrogen bond interaction has been identified as an intermolecular force that inhibits bimolecular recombination and regulates the contact of two layers, which provides sufficient potential to manipulate the intermolecular carrier behavior.26–28 Our team first reported a hydrogen bond strategy by adopting a hydrogen-bond-induced third component in the active layer to acquire a high-efficiency ternary OSC.27,29–36 In addition, the hydrogen bond strategy proved to be a good strategy to improve the morphology of the active layer and charge mobility.37 Nevertheless, hydrogen bonds in the interlayer are unexplored. Yao et al. utilized a hydrogen-bond-forming aliphatic amine group-functionalized perylene diimide (PDI) derivative as the cathode interlayer material, demonstrating that hydrogen-bonding interactions at the interface improved the interfacial compatibility and reduced the series resistance of devices.38 These studies successfully proved the existence of hydrogen bonds, but the mechanism of how hydrogen bonds function in the active layer has not been sufficiently explained.
In this work, a hydrogen-bond-induced interlayer between the cathode and the active layer is employed to increase the short-circuit current (JSC) of OSCs. A new self-assembled material (2N-SAM) is used to modify the ZnO ETL. For devices based on PM6:Y6, the PCE increased from 14.50% to 16.03%.
Compared to pristine ZnO-based OSCs, their charge transportation is remarkably improved, with a JSC of 27.08 mA cm−2. This work provides deep insight into a new strategy combining hydrogen bonds and a self-assembled monolayer, which provides a ZnO modification method through hydrogen bonds to achieve high efficiency in inverted OSCs. The chemical structures of PM6, Y6, and 2N-SAM, and the inverted device structure with hydrogen bonds used in this study, are shown in Fig. 1.

Materials and methods
Materials
PM6 and Y6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. 2N-SAM was purchased from Bide. Chloroform (CF, 99.8%) and chloronaphthalene (CN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp.
Device fabrication and characterization
OSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/2N-SAM/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The pre-patterned ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent water, ethanol, acetone, and ethanol for 30 min. After the UV process for 30 min, the ZnO layer that served as the ETL was spin-coated onto the ITO glass substrate for 30 s at 5000 rpm, and then thermally annealed in air at 200 °C for 1 h. Additionally, the ZnO ETL was treated with 2N-SAM by spin-coating 2N-SAM methanol solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s and thermally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. Then, the active layer precursor solution (PM6:Y6) was spin-coated at 3100 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min in a N2 atmosphere. Herein, the precursor solution consisted of 8 mg mL−1 PM6 and 9.6 mg mL−1 Y6 together with 0.5 vol% CN. Finally, a 10 nm MoO3 film and 150 nm Ag anode were thermally deposited successively at rates of 0.3 Å s−1 and 2 Å s−1, respectively.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed using a Nexus 670 (Nicolet Industry). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry of ZnO with and without 2N-SAM were performed using a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. The J–V test was conducted using a Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulator and Keithley 2400 with an illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The contact angle was measured using a JY-82B (Germany Kruss Industry). ToF-SIMS tests were performed using a nanoTOF II (ULVAC-PHI Industry). The morphological properties were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a Dimension ICON (Bruker Industry).
Results and discussion
Proving the existence of hydrogen bonds
To confirm the existence of hydrogen bonds, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was conducted for the solution samples of Y6, 2N-SAM, and the Y6/2N-SAM blend (w/w, 1:1, in DMF), as shown in Fig. 2. The FT-IR spectrum of the 2N-SAM sample shows a peak at 2400 cm−1 that corresponds to N–H, while in the Y6/2N-SAM blend sample, the N–H peak shifts to 2350 cm−1 and is flattened. This result illustrates that hydrogen bonds are formed between the N–H group of 2N-SAM and Y6. The C–F peak of the Y6 sample at 1363 cm−1 is of the same intensity as that of the Y6/2N-SAM blend sample, while the 2N-SAM sample also has a sharp peak at 1363 cm−1. With this complicated figure, it was hard to confirm whether the C–F peak moved or not, but if there was no hydrogen bond formation at C–F, the peak intensity at 1363 cm−1 of the Y6/2N-SAM blend sample should have been between that of the Y6 and 2N-SAM samples. We speculate that the same intensity peak of the Y6 and Y6/2N-SAM samples might be caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds at the C–F bond of Y6. These results suggest that 2N-SAM is a good hydrogen-bond-inducing material that can form intermolecular interactions with the active layer.

Vertical phase separation
To further investigate the influence of 2N-SAM on the stratification of the active layer, we used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to characterize the change in the chemical composition ratio in the vertical direction. Fig. 3 shows the vertical profiles of the OSCs with/without 2N-SAM. Around 600 s, the content of O2− ions grows dramatically, which is attributed to the ZnO layer, and the C2N− ion curve rises in the 2N-SAM/ZnO film, in contrast to the reduction seen in the bare ZnO film. The C2N− ion is a characteristic group of Y6. This means that Y6 tends to accumulate towards 2N-SAM. However, we found that the imidazole group in 2N-SAM also includes the C2N− ion. To clarify the change in chemical composition of the active layer, the ratios of NH− to C2N− ions are calculated and are shown in Fig. 3(c). As 2N-SAM possesses the same amount of NH− and C2N− ions, the increased ratio of NH− and C2N− ions might be due to Y6 enrichment. The intensity ratios of S− to F− ions are illustrated in Fig. 3(d). We found that the content of F atoms in Y6 is more than that in PM6, while the content of S atoms in Y6 is less than that in PM6. The S/F ratio of the ZnO/2N-SAM film is lower than that of the bare ZnO film at the ZnO/BHJ interface and higher than that of the bare ZnO film inside BHJ, implying acceptor accumulation at the ZnO side. This enrichment of Y6 at the ZnO/BHJ interface is attributed to the hydrogen bond between Y6 and 2N-SAM. It is confirmed that this kind of vertical phase separation enhances the exciton diffusion and charge collection efficiency.39,40

Photovoltaic performance
The J–V curves of the studied OSCs are illustrated in Fig. 4(a), and the detailed electrical parameters are given in Table 1. The PCE of the control cells based on the ZnO cathode is 14.50% with a JSC of 24.73 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.81 V and a fill factor (FF) of 72%. The ZnO/2N-SAM-based OSCs possess a remarkably higher PCE of 16.03% due to a highly increased JSC of 27.08 mA cm−2. We further investigated the influence of interlayer thickness by controlling the concentration of the 2N-SAM solution (detailed characteristics are shown in Table S1, ESI†). The optimized concentration is 0.5 mg mL−1. Evidently, the cells with 2N-SAM outperform those with bare ZnO in terms of their JSC, while their VOC and FF remain constant and are equivalent to those of conventional devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:Y6/L-PFN-Br/Ag).41 We demonstrated that the higher JSC is due to the hydrogen bonds between Y6 and 2N-SAM, the better WF alignment between ZnO and Y6, and the better stratification in BHJ.

Light intensity, charge transport properties, and light stability
To obtain a better understanding of the effects of hydrogen-bond-inducing vertical phase separation, we investigated the exciton diffusion and charge extraction properties. The photogenerated density of photocurrent versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves are illustrated in Fig. 4(b and c). From the curves, we can calculate the charge collection (ηc) and exciton diffusion (ηd). The ηc is calculated by the ratio of Jsc and satisfying current; ηd is calculated by the ratio of Jpower and satisfying current. Jpower is the current value when J·V reaches a maximum. The device with ZnO/2N-SAM shows the highest ηd and ηc values (98.00% and 84.80%, respectively) compared with those of standard devices (96.98% and 84.60%, respectively), indicating that a better exciton diffusion and charge collection capability are obtained with the hydrogen-bonding-induced interlayer.
Next, we evaluated the charge recombination mechanisms using light intensity-dependent J–V measurements. The relationship of VOC and light intensity is shown in Fig. 4(d), which exhibits a slope of nkT/q, where n is the slope, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge.42 The slope n should be between 1 and 2. A slope n close to 1 means that bimolecular recombination plays a key role in the loss mechanism and a slope close to 2 means that trap-assisted recombination accounts for the main portion.43
The slope of the OSC with ZnO/2N-SAM is 1.17 kT/q, which is much lower than the slope (1.42 kT/q) of the bare ZnO-based OSC. This indicates that with 2N-SAM, the trap-assisted recombination in the active layer is reduced, further highlighting the key role of the hydrogen-bonding-induced interlayer in the device operation. The light intensity-dependent JSC curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 4(e). Theoretically, the relationship of JSC and light intensity (P) can be modeled by the equation JSC ∝ Pα. The exponential factor α is usually ranges from 0.85 to 1 for OSCs.43,44 A slope α of the fitted lines close to 1 means that bimolecular recombination is insignificant, and thus the occurrence of less carrier loss. The α values are approximately 0.934 and 0.992 for the ZnO-based and ZnO/2N-SAM-based solar cells, respectively. Therefore, with 2N-SAM, bimolecular recombination is reduced due to the suppressed surface recombination and hydrogen bonds at the ZnO/2N-SAM/BHJ interface.
Besides PCE, the short-time stability of OSCs in the light condition is significant. The interlayer/electrode contact plays an important role in the stability for the practical application of OSCs. Fig. S4 (ESI†) displays the steady-state efficiency of the OSCs under continuous air mass (AM)1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The results show that after 210 min, the 2N-SAM-based devices sustained better stability (89.0% of initial efficiency) than that of the bare ZnO devices (85.9% of initial efficiency).
Work function
The WFs of the ZnO/2N-SAM electrodes were measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS). The obtained results of kinetic energy (presented in Fig. S1, ESI†) show that the WF of the ZnO/2N-SAM electrode is smaller than the WF of ZnO by 0.3 eV (from 3.82 eV to 3.51 eV). The reduction of WF is attributed to the dipoles induced by SAM. The relatively low WF obtained for 2N-SAM might be associated with the high dipole moment from the imidazole group. This result indicates that 2N-SAM is a good SAM material for lowering the WF of electrodes. The smaller WF of ZnO/2N-SAM might lead to a smaller offset between ZnO and the LUMO of Y6. Thus, the electron injection barrier is reduced and the electron injection is enhanced.
Surface property of 2N-SAM-treated ZnO
To confirm the SAM coverage on the ZnO ETL, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). The presence of 2N-SAM molecules was probed by measuring N signals and then comparing with bare ZnO. This proved the existence of 2N-SAM.
To further investigate the influence of SAM coverage on the interface, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to study the surface morphologies of the ZnO and ZnO/2N-SAM electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5. After treatment with 2N-SAM, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the surface dramatically decreased from 4.1 nm (bare ZnO surface) to 1.74 nm (2N-SAM surface). The different surface morphologies lead to different surface energies of the interlayer, which are likely to influence the compatibility and contact between ZnO/2N-SAM and the active layer atop.45 To verify this, contact-angle measurements were conducted on both ZnO/2N-SAM and ZnO (shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). Our calculations show that ZnO/2N-SAM exhibits lower surface energy (22.68 mN m−1) than that of bare ZnO (22.96 mN m−1). Lower surface energy and the smoother surface of 2N-SAM might influence the spin-coating dynamics, which finally lead to a better contact between ZnO and the active layer.6

Conclusions
In summary, we report a novel self-assembled molecule 2N-SAM as the interlayer, which forms hydrogen bonds with the acceptor Y6. Cells comprising the ZnO/2N-SAM cathode yielded a maximum PCE of 16.03%, and control cells based on ZnO yielded a maximum PCE of 14.50%. We proved the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between 2N-SAM and Y6 using FT-IR spectroscopy. The existence of hydrogen bonds leads to the enrichment of the acceptor at the cathode, achieving a better stratification of BHJ. Moreover, due to the dipole moment induced by 2N-SAM on ZnO, the WF decreased to improve the WF alignment between ZnO/2N-SAM and Y6. With excellent electron extracting characteristics, a higher JSC is achieved. Moreover, the smoother surface of ZnO/2N-SAM might lead to a favorable contact between ZnO/2N-SAM and the active layer. As a result, trap-assisted recombination is reduced. Furthermore, better short-time stability in the light condition of the OSCs is achieved by the chemically stable nature of the ZnO/2N-SAM interface. Overall, these results highlight the tremendous potential of hydrogen-bond-induced ETL interlayers for high-performance OSCs.
