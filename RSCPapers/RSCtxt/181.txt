    , Accepted 22nd October 2020First published on 22nd October 2020AbstractNear-infrared (NIR) organic phototransistors (OPTs) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) conjugated polymers with partially removed long branched alkyl side chains are reported with significantly improved NIR photoresponses, which take advantage of both strengthened NIR absorption and improved charge transport. The NIR OPTs based on the terpolymer with properly partial removal of the alkyl side chains showed much higher photoresponsivity R (567 A W−1) and larger photosensitivity P (∼106) as compared to those of the other two control devices based on DPP conjugated polymers without removal or with excessive removal of the alkyl side chains. By incorporating a small amount of [6,6]phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester into the terpolymers with partially removed side chains, the resulting NIR OPTs exhibited ultralow detection limit (0.002 mW cm−2) and presented very high sensitivity with a maximum R of 4234 A W−1 and specific photodetectivity D* of 5.6 × 1013 Jones. These findings demonstrated that side chain engineering in conjugated polymers provides an excellent opportunity for developing high performance organic photodetectors.
1. Introduction
Highly sensitive near-infrared (NIR) organic photodetectors have attracted significant interest for their promising applications in night-vision, image sensors, and environment/health monitoring.1–3 Photodetectors based on organic field-effect transistors, called organic phototransistors (OPTs), are an important type of organic photodetector in which the channel carrier density can be modulated by both the incident light and electrical gating. Thus, OPTs can integrate the functions of light sensing and signal amplification in a single device, offering higher sensitivities and lower noise levels compared with the conventional two-terminal photodiodes and photoconductors. The emerging NIR OPTs are considered as an attractive alternative NIR detecting technology to traditional inorganic phototransistors. However, at the moment the performance of the NIR OPTs is still poor as compared to their inorganic counterparts with a typical photoresponsivity (R) of ∼400 A W−1.4,5 The performance of the NIR OPTs is limited primarily due to the low carrier mobility and/or poor NIR absorption of the organic semiconductor channel layer.6,7
Recently, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers have emerged as extremely attractive active materials for solution-processed organic electronic devices including OFETs,8–13 solar cells,14–18 and photodetectors.6,19,20 The electron-deficient DPP units alternately amalgamate with suitable electron-rich units to construct highly ordered and coplanar D–A conjugated copolymers which in turn allow for the realization of very high field-effect mobilities of over 10 cm2 V−1 s−18–10,13 and photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies of over 8%.17,18 Apart from this, attempts for the fabrication of NIR OPTs by the use of these DPP-based D–A polymers have been also made because of the narrow band NIR absorption of the DPP units.6,20 However, it is noteworthy that the development of DPP-based NIR OPT is lagging far behind that of the DPP-based OFETs and solar cells. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop and/or optimize more materials which are suitable for NIR OPT applications.
Side chain engineering involving the installation of appropriate side-chain substitutions has been proved to be an effective way to further optimize the molecular structure of the conjugated polymers and then improve their semiconducting performances.15,16,21–25 Much effort has been made to optimize the microstructure and morphology of DPP-based D–A polymer thin films through varying the length or position of the side alkyl chains in the polymers. In addition, branching alkyl side-chains were usually incorporated into the D–A polymers to improve their solubility, aiming to get a good processability of the polymers through a solution route. However, the branching alkyl chains linked on the DPP polymer backbones would hinder the molecular packing of the polymer chains due to the steric hindrance. To overcome this tradeoff, partially replacing or removing of the long branching alkyl chains has been proposed to further fine tune the molecular structure, which results in large performance improvements in both OFET and solar cells.15,21,25,26 These positive changes in the charge transport and optoelectronic properties of the DPP-based D–A polymer are also expected to result in performance enhancement in the OPTs when such a polymer is used as the channel layer in the device. Unfortunately, until now, few studies on this have been reported.
In this work, for the first time, the effects of side chain engineering on the device performances of DPP-based NIR OPTs were investigated. Highly sensitive DPP-based NIR OPTs with an R value of 567 A W−1 and photosensitivity (P) of ∼106 were achieved by partially removing the long branched alkyl side chains from the DPP backbone. The results revealed that the improvements in the photoresponse of the NIR OPTs resulted from the strengthened NIR absorption and improved charge transport due to the partial removal of long branched alkyl side chains. Upon doping a small amount of fullerene derivative [6,6]phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) into the DPP polymers with partially removed side chains, the resulting NIR OPTs exhibited an ultralow detection limit (0.002 mW cm−2) and very high sensitivity with a maximum R value of 4234 A W−1 and specific photodetectivity (D*) of 5.6 × 1013 Jones. This work provides a facile and effective approach to developing high performance D–A polymer phototransistors for NIR-detection applications.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of DPP-based conjugated D–A copolymers with partially removed long branched alkyl side chains are shown in Fig. 1a. Conjugated terpolymers P1, P2 and the parent polymer (P0) were synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization according to a previously reported procedure.26 By varying the feeding ratios between the two different DPP acceptor units, terpolymers P1 and P2, in which the ratios of the branching side chain containing DPP unit vs. side chain-free one are 40:1 and 10:1, were obtained, respectively. The solubility of the resulting terpolymers depends on the content of side chain-free unit in the total acceptor units.26P1 and P0 showed good solubility in hot (60 °C) dichlorobenzene and other halogenated solvents. In comparison, P2 displayed limited solubility under the same conditions. It is worth noting that the solubility of P2 in halogenated solvents was improved after 48 hours at a high temperature of 80 °C. Thus, all these conjugated D–A copolymers can be used to fabricate thin films through spin coating.

The optical properties of copolymers P0, P1, and P2 were investigated by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy in dilute dichlorobenzene solutions and in solid thin films. The copolymers P0, P1, and P2 in solution exhibited identical absorption features with typical π–π* absorption bands at 350–550 nm and intramolecular charge transfer (CT) bands at 550–1000 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). Compared to their absorptions in solution, the three copolymers thin films showed similar absorptions in the range of 300–1100 nm. It is noteworthy that the intramolecular CT bands of P1 and P2 were obviously red-shifted by 25–30 nm in comparison to that of P0, showing broader absorptions in the NIR region. Fig. 1b shows the absorption coefficients (α) of the three copolymers P0, P1, and P2 thin films. The corresponding maximum α values were 1.34, 2.36, and 0.97 × 105 cm−1 for P0, P1, and P2 thin films, respectively. The α value increased first and then decreased as the long branched alkyl side chains were removed from the DPP backbone. Note that P1 thin film with its broad and strong NIR absorption is able to harvest more incident NIR photons for efficient charge carrier generation, and thus would be beneficial for NIR OPT applications.
Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted to explore the changes in the molecular packing and morphology of the polymer thin films by the partial removal of side-chains from the DPP backbone, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the out-of-plane GIXRD patterns for the polymer thin films of P0, P1, and P2 spin coated onto a trichloro(octadecyl)silane (OTS-18) modified silicon wafer (SiO2/Si) substrate. The P0 film showed a weak primary (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.41°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 20.05 Å. The (100) diffraction peak intensified and its position shifted to high angles upon partially removing branched side chains (see inset in Fig. 2). Specifically, P1 exhibited a much stronger (100) peak at 2θ = 4.60°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 19.17 Å. However, excessive removal of long-branched alkyl side chains led to a reduction of diffraction intensity but without changing the peaking position (for example, in P2). The above results revealed that the partial removal of side-chains from the DPP backbone would enable the polymer chains to pack more closely by reducing the steric hindrance of the long branched side-chains. Moreover, the significant enhancement in the diffraction intensity for P1 thin film suggested that the suitable partial removal of the long-branched alkyl side chains helps to improve the interchain interactions, which results in a higher interchain packing order degree in the P1 thin film.

Fig. 3 shows AFM height images of polymer thin films on OTS-18 modified SiO2/Si substrates. The reference P0 films exhibited relatively smooth, nano-grainy features with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.95 nm (Fig. 3a). With the partial removal of branched side chains, P1 films displayed polycrystalline grain aggregates and the grain size grew larger, showing a much larger RMS roughness of 3.19 nm (Fig. 3b). The larger grain domain and the connectivity between the neighboring domains would facilitate the establishment of efficient pathways for charge transport.13 However, further removing long-branched alkyl side chains from the DPP backbone largely reduced the solubility of the resulting polymer, which led to some large aggregate domains in the resulting P2 films with a very large RMS roughness of 4.86 nm (Fig. 3c).

To investigate the effect of partially removing branched side chains on the NIR light responses of the copolymers, bottom-gate, top-contact OPTs were exposed to NIR light under top illumination (see the inset in Fig. 1b). The NIR light was supplied by a NIR LED that shows a quite narrow emission with the peak position at 870 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The transfer characteristics of the OPTs based on P0, P1, and P2 were measured in the dark and under NIR illumination to evaluate the photoresponses of the devices. All the characterization was performed under ambient conditions. The transfer curves of the OPTs were measured alternately several times before and after the exposure to the NIR light to ensure that the variation in the transfer curves of the devices really came from the incident light rather than their own instability (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Fig. 4 shows the typical photoresponse behaviors of NIR OPTs based on the D–A copolymers of P0, P1, and P2. It is seen that all these devices exhibit a typical p-type conduction mode in the dark (Fig. 4a–c). P1-based OPTs show a higher hole mobility of 0.72 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a larger on/off ratio of over 107 compared with those of the devices based on P0 (0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼105) and P2 (0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼104). These results are well consistent with the GIXRD and AFM results (see Fig. 2 and 3), indicating that the suitable partial removal of the long-branched alkyl side chains from the conjugated backbone promotes the molecular ordering of polymer semiconductors and enhances the field-effect mobility of P1-based devices. However, excessive removal of long-branched alkyl side chains (for example, P2) seriously affects the solubility of the material, which is not conducive to the formation of charge transport channels in the films and ultimately leads to a decrease in mobility (Fig. 4c).

When these OPTs were exposed to NIR light with an intensity of 0.063 mW cm−2, the source–drain current (IDS) under illumination increased dramatically compared with its corresponding IDS in the dark due to the positive shift of the threshold voltage (VTh). It was found that P1-based OPTs displayed the largest VTh shifts (ΔVTh) among these devices (Fig. S4, ESI†), showing the excellent detection capability of NIR light. From the transfer curves in the dark and under illumination, two important parameters that quantitatively described the light detection capability of OPTs, namely, P and R, were calculated using the following fundamental equations,2,27 P = (Ilight − Idark)/Idark(1) R = (Ilight − Idark)/Pinc(2)where Ilight and Idark are IDS values in the dark and under illumination, Pinc is the incident illumination power, respectively.

Fig. 4d–f shows the R and P versus gate voltage (VG) for the NIR OPTs based on the D–A polymers of P0, P1, and P2, respectively. The performance parameters under the NIR intensity of 0.063 mW cm−2 are summarized in Table 1. For the P0-based NIR OPT, the R and P at the crossing-point of two curves (Rcp and Pcp) were 3.3 A W−1 and 1.9 × 102, respectively. The maximum R value reached was 37.8 A W−1 at VG = −8 V (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the NIR OPTs based on P1 exhibited a much larger Rcp of 31.4 A W−1 and Pcp of 1.6 × 105, respectively. The maximum R value for the P1-based NIR OPTs reached 109.7 A W−1 at VG = −6 V (Fig. 4e), which was three times that of the reference P0-based NIR OPTs. Thus, the suitable partial removal of the long-branched alkyl side chains from the conjugated backbone did improve the photoresponse of the NIR OPTs. However, excessively removing the long branched alkyl side chains greatly reduced the performance of the NIR OPTs. For example, P2-based NIR OPTs showed a relatively lower Rcp of 5.6 A W−1 and Pcp of 1.1 × 102, respectively. The maximum R value for the P2-based NIR OPTs was only 13.5 A W−1 (Fig. 4f). These results suggest that the photoresponse performance of the NIR OPTs can be optimized by changing the molecular packing and morphology of the polymer films via the suitable partial removal of side-chains from the DPP backbone.

To further evaluate the photoresponse of NIR OPTs based on D–A polymers with partially removed long branched alkyl side chains, the transfer characteristics of the three types of devices based on P0, P1, and P2 were characterized under NIR illumination at different light intensities. As the NIR intensity increased, the IDS of three devices increased with a pronounced positive shift of the VTh (Fig. S5, ESI†). The corresponding R values (Fig. 5a–c) and EQEs (Fig. S6, ESI†) under different NIR intensities were calculated to compare the photoresponse of the three types of NIR OPTs. It was found that R followed a monotonically increasing trend with VG and showed a higher value under lower NIR intensity, confirming that the charge carriers in the present NIR OPTs can be modulated by both electrical gating and incident light. R showed a similar trend for P0-, P1-, and P2-based NIR OPTs, while the R value of the P1-based OPTs was higher than that of other two OPTs at the same NIR intensity. Under the quite low NIR intensity of 0.016 mW cm−2, the maximum R value of the P1-based OPTs reached 567 A W−1, which is comparable with that of silicon-based photodetectors (R ≥ 400 A W−1).4,5Fig. 5d plotted the R values (VG = −10 V) for the P0-, P1-, and P2-based NIR OPTs as a function of the NIR intensity on a double-logarithmic scale. R increased with the reduced NIR intensity following a sublinear power low, which resulted from the saturation of photogenerated charge carriers in the channel layer.6,28

Based on the above results, it was concluded that the performance of the NIR OPTs exhibited a good correspondence with the NIR absorption and field-effect mobility of their channel layer. Thus, we suggested that the strengthened NIR absorption and improved charge transport due to the partial removal of long branched alkyl side chains were the main reasons for the performance improvement of the present devices. To further improve the photoresponses of the NIR OPTs, the fullerene derivative PC61BM was incorporated into the P1-based channel layer. PC61BM is the most prominent electron acceptor in organic solar cells, which has been also used to facilitate dissociation of excitons and trap electrons in organic photodetectors.29–31 However, an excessive amount of PC61BM molecules in the channel layer in OPTs easily causes PC61BM aggregation that would disrupt the molecular packing of the D–A polymer in the channel and then reduce the hole mobility.6,20 In view of this, a small amount of PC61BM was doped into P1 (P1:PC61BM = 32:1, by weight) to construct the active channel layer in the NIR OPTs. The same device architecture was adopted to make a convictive comparison.
The photoresponse performance of the NIR OPTs based on P1:PC61BM (32:1) is displayed in Fig. 6. In the dark, the transfer characteristics of the PC61BM-doped NIR OPTs are similar to those of the pristine P1-based OPTs (Fig. 6a), showing roughly the same hole mobility and on/off ratio. Under irradiation of the NIR light (0.078 mW cm−2), VTh shifted largely toward positive voltages, resulting in a dramatic increase in IDS for the PC61BM-doped NIR OPTs. The Rcp and Pcp are determined to be 60.0 A W−1 and 5.0 × 104, respectively, with a maximum R value of 217.3 A W−1 at VG = −10 V (Fig. 6b). The R value for the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs was nearly twice that of the pristine P1-based NIR OPTs under a similar NIR irradiation of 0.063 mW cm−2, indicating a large improvement of the NIR photoresponse in the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs.

When the P1:PC61BM-based OPT device was exposed to different NIR light intensities, IDS gradually increased as light intensity compared to IDS in the dark (Fig. 6c). The P1:PC61BM-based device exhibited a stable and reversible response to NIR light with different intensities (Fig. S7, ESI†). It was found that the detection limit was lowered from 0.016 mW cm−2 for the pristine P1-based NIR OPTs to 0.008 mW cm−2 for the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs. In some independent tests, the detection limit can even reach 0.002 mW cm−2. Under the ultralow irradiation intensity of 0.002 mW cm−2, the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs exhibited obvious NIR responses in the transfer characteristics as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The corresponding R values and EQEs under different NIR light intensities were plotted as a function of VG (Fig. S9, ESI†), and the saturated R values (VG = −10 V) versus NIR light intensity are displayed in Fig. 6d. Nearly three orders of change in R values of the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs were observed over a NIR intensity range from 0.002 to 1.101 mW cm−2, showing a sublinear power law dependence. A very large R value of 4234 A W−1 was attained under an ultralow irradiation intensity of 0.002 mW cm−2, demonstrating excellent NIR photoresponses for the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs.
Specific photodetectivity (D*) is another important parameter for OPTs, which indicates the photosensitivity and shot noise limit of the OPTs.32 The shot noise is usually frequency independent in OPTs.33 Thus, assuming that the dark current (Idark) is dominated by the shot noise, D* can be estimated using the equation as D* = R·S1/2/(2eIdark)1/2,20,32,33 where S is the channel area of NIR OPTs and e is the elementary charge, respectively. The D*–VG characteristics measured for the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs under different intensities of NIR light are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). It is found that the D* values were VG and light intensity dependent. The representative D* values as function of NIR light intensity on a double-logarithmic scale at a fixed VG of −10 V are presented in Fig. 6d. Similar to the changed trend of R over intensity of NIR light, the D* value also increased with the reduced intensity following a sublinear power law. The D* reached a maximum value of 5.6 × 1013 Jones benefiting from the much enhanced photoresponsivity of the P1:PC61BM-based NIR OPTs.
The reason for the further improvement of light responses in NIR OPTs based on P1:PC61BM would be related to electron trapping in the PC61BM. According to the energy levels of P126 and PC61BM30,32 as shown in Fig. 7a, the electrons can transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of P1 to the LUMO of PC61BM. Thus, after a small amount of PC61BM was incorporated into the P1-based polymer channel, the isolated PC61BM molecules and/or aggregations in the doped channel layer can be considered as electron traps due to the energy barrier of ∼0.6 eV in LUMO levels between P1 and PC61BM (Fig. 7a). When the P1:PC61BM-based OPTs were exposed to NIR light, excitons were generated in the P1 and then dissociated into electrons and holes at the P1/PC61BM and P1/electrode interfaces. Some of the photogenerated electrons would be transferred into the disperse PC61BM and trapped at the PC61BM sites, while holes flow to the drain contact along the P1 channel (Fig. 7b). The trapped electrons at the PC61BM sites near the source contact can build up a Coulomb field and lower the barrier to assist hole injection from the source contact into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P1, leading to a trap-assisted photomultiplication.31 In this case, a higher photoresponsivity was attained in the NIR OPTs based on P1:PC61BM.

3. Conclusion
In summary, near-infrared organic phototransistors based on diketopyrrolopyrrole conjugated polymers with partially removed long branched alkyl side chains were demonstrated. The photoresponses of the NIR OPTs exhibited significant enhancements by suitably removing the long-branched alkyl side chains from the regioregular conjugated backbone. The NIR OPTs based on terpolymer P1, in which the ratios of the branching side chain containing DPP unit vs. side chain-free one are 40:1, possessed higher photoresponsivity R (567 A W−1) and larger photosensitivity P (∼106) as compared to those of the other two devices based on copolymers of P0 without removal and P2 with excessive removal of the long branched alkyl side chains. It is found that the strengthened NIR absorption and improved charge transport due to partial removal of long branched alkyl side chains are responsible for the performance improvement of the present devices. With a small amount of PC61BM doped in P1 (P1:PC61BM = 32:1, by weight), the P1:PC61BM NIR OPTs exhibited an ultralow detection limit (0.002 mW cm−2) and presented much higher sensitivity with the maximum R of 4234 A W−1 and D* of 5.6 × 1013 Jones. The enhanced photoresponses of the NIR OPTs based on P1:PC61BM were mainly attributed to the trap-assisted photomultiplication caused by the electron trapping in the PC61BM. These findings should be very encouraging in exploring high-performing NIR OPTs via side chain engineering.
4. Experimental
Materials
The chemical reagents and staring materials were commercially available and used without further purification. Conjugated polymers P0, P1 and P2 were synthesized according to our previous report.26 OTS-18 and PC61BM were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Sample preparation
The NIR-OPTs were fabricated with a bottom-gate, top-contact configuration in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. A heavily p-doped silicon wafer with ∼300 nm thermally grown SiO2 layers (Ci ∼ 11.5 nF cm−2)34 was used as the gate electrode and dielectric. The surface of SiO2 was modified by OTS-18 to remove the trap sites and improve its hydrophobicity.35 Conjugated polymers P0, P1, and P2 were dissolved in dichlorobenzene with 4 mg mL−1. Then, the polymer semiconducting layers were deposited by spin coating the hot dichlorobenzene solutions (60 °C for P0 and P1, 80 °C for P2) at 1500 rpm for 150 s. After annealing the resulting polymer semiconducting films at 180 °C for ∼20 min, a 40 nm-thick gold source and drain electrodes were thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber (2 × 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask with a channel length of 80 μm and channel width of 1500 μm.
Measurement and characterization
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymer thin films were obtained by a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. AFM (Veeco Digital Instruments) and GIXRD (Bruker D8 Advance system) instruments were used to characterize the morphology and molecular packing of the films. The electrical characteristics were measured using a probe station coupled with a Keithley 2636B dual channel source/meter under an ambient atmosphere. The NIR light was offered by an 870 nm NIR LED (ThorLabs). The intensity of the NIR light reaching the surface of the OPTs were adjusted by changing the output of the NIR LED and calibrated using a PM100A optical power meter (ThorLabs).
