    , Accepted 9th May 2013First published on 9th May 2013AbstractTwo dimensional (2D) nanostructures such as graphene have been attracting increasing research interest in the recent past due to their superior material properties. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method for the production of a few layered graphene sheets and the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of the prepared graphene sheets using a single step hydrothermal method. The composites prepared with different graphene loading were assessed for their photocatalytic degradation ability under visible light and in dye sensitized solar cells (DSC). The results showed that the average thickness of the obtained graphene sheets was 1.1 nm and the TiO2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the graphene. In the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO), the photoactivity of the composite (with 10 wt% graphene loading) was found to be three times better than bare TiO2 nanoparticles. This increased activity is due to the synergistic effects of TiO2 nanoparticles and graphene sheets. For DSC, composites with 0.7 wt% graphene loading showed a maximum efficiency of 4.26%, 25% higher than without graphene.
Introduction
Graphene is considered to be one of the most stable forms of carbon, which is a one atom thick sheet of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms.1 Due to its unique electrochemical and mechanical properties, graphene has found immense applications in the field of nanoelectronics, batteries, solar cells and photocatalytic applications.2 The preparation of graphene is generally carried out by the reduction of GO,3 micromechanical exfoliation of graphite4 or by chemical and physical vapour deposition.5 All these methods suffer from certain disadvantages such as defected graphene structure, addition of impurity, low yield, difficulty in controlling layer thickness, etc.6,7 Liquid phase exfoliation has been found to have great potential for bulk production of graphene.8 Graphene sheets have been prepared in various organic solvents via sonication in the presence of various stabilizers.9–11 In order to achieve efficient exfoliation in solution phase, minimum damage to layers of the material and minimal interference from the solvents and the stabilizers used is very crucial. Moreover, the solvents used should be low cost, eco-friendly and easy to handle.
Among the different graphene based composites, TiO2/graphene composites (TGCs) are widely used in solar cells, batteries and in photocatalysis.12–14 In general, TGCs are prepared by molecular grafting, solvothermal and hydrothermal methods.15–17 Hydrothermal processes generally involve multi-steps or the reduction of TiO2/graphene oxide (GO) into TiO2/graphene composites.18 For enhanced performance in photocatalysis and photovoltaics, it is highly desirable to eliminate multi-steps and the use of GO.19
In this work, we report a simple method for graphene preparation via sonication in presence of an aromatic stabilizer, 1-pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) and the fabrication of nano TGCs using a single pot hydrothermal method. TGCs were prepared from the as synthesized PCA stabilized graphene and titanium precursor, avoiding multi steps and additional reduction steps. In addition, its application in photocatalysis (methyl orange, MO, as a model) and DSC is explored. The obtained composites displayed enhanced photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties compared to bare TiO2 nanoparticles. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the combined properties of TiO2 and defect free PCA stabilized graphene.20 Incorporation of graphene in the composite resulted in shifting the absorption wavelength of TiO2 to the visible region, which enabled the composites to absorb the visible light, which is more efficient in photocatalysis.21
Experimental
Materials
Expanded graphite was provided by Lobachemie (extra pure fine powder ∼50 μm, Mumbai, India). PCA, titanium(IV) isopropoxide, acetonitrile (99.9%), t-butyl alcohol (99%), methanol and butanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Germany). N3 dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland and used as received. MO was purchased from local distributors.
Characterization
Wide angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert PRO Analytical) with Cu-Kα radiation. The phase identification was carried out using standard JCPDS database. Raman spectra were obtained using Confocal Raman Spectrometer (WITEC ALPHA 300 RA). UV-vis spectra were recorded using the Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The morphological and structural characterizations of graphene and TGCs were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM 6490 LA), atomic force microscopy (AFM) (JEOL SPM 5200), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (SEI Tecnai G230). Specific surface area was measured at 77 K by Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) Nitrogen adsorption desorption (Micromeritics TriStar 3000 V6.07A Instrument). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the assembled DSCs were measured under an illumination of 0.5 sun using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A). Keithley 2400 digital source meter was used to measure the photo-current (ISC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) under an applied external potential scan for an exposed area of 0.25 cm2.
Preparation of graphene
For the preparation of graphene, 25 mg graphite was dispersed in 50 mL of butanol with the addition of 12.5 mg of PCA. The dispersion was sonicated for 6 h and was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min to remove unexfoliated graphite. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness to get a few layered graphene sheets. The powder could be easily suspended in common organic solvents. It was resuspended in butanol for further characterization and experiments.
Preparation of TGCs
Different weight percentage of PCA stabilized graphene (varied from 0.3 to 10) was dispersed in 10 mL of butanol and was mixed with 2 mL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide and 40 mL of water in a Teflon autoclave and heated at 250 °C for 24 h. The product was washed several times with water and annealed at 450 °C for 12 h. A control of bare TiO2 was prepared in the same manner without graphene addition.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
About 30 mg of the TGCs (different compositions) were stirred with 0.05 mM MO solution in water. Under ambient conditions, the photoreaction vessel was exposed to visible light. The photocatalytic reaction was started by turning on the diffused light (CFL lamp, power of 50 W) and during the photocatalysis, all other light sources were isolated. After given time intervals of 15 min, 5 mL of photoreacted solution was taken out and used for the UV-vis absorption analyses.
Fabrication of DSCs
About 100 mg of the prepared nanocomposite was mixed with 100 μL polyester polymer22 and sonicated for 24 h to get an appropriate rheology necessary for doctor blading/screen printing. TiCl4 treated cleaned FTO plates were taken and TGCs–polymer paste was doctor bladed over it to get a thickness of about 15 μm. The FTO plates were sintered at 450 °C for 3 h (the average thickness reduces to ∼12 μm during the sintering process due to the degradation of the polymer from the composite) and subsequently soaked in 0.5 mM N3 dye solution (in 1:1 acetonitrile–t-butyl alcohol mixture) for 24 h for saturated chemisorption of the dye. The TiO2 electrodes were subsequently washed with methanol for removing the unanchored dyes and dried in vacuum. The photoelectrodes were sandwiched against a Pt counter-electrode in the presence of parafilm spacer and I3−/I−electrolyte to assemble typical DSC.
Results and discussion
Characterization of PCA stabilized graphene

Fig. 1(a) shows the TEM image of PCA stabilized graphene. Several nanosheets were observed and found to be stable under the high energy electron beam. Most of the sheets were 0.2–0.7 μm in size and were wrinkled around the edges. Wrinkling of the sheets can be attributed to the extra thermodynamic stability of the 2D sheets arising from microscopic crumpling involving either bending or buckling.23 Thickness and morphology of the sheets were further probed using AFM. Fig. 1(b) shows the AFM image of an individual nanosheet with a lateral dimension of 0.3 μm and the inset shows the height profiling along the green line. The thickness was found to be 0.9 nm, corresponding to ∼ 1–3 layers. The average thickness of the sheets was found to be ∼ 1.1 nm. The variation in the thickness could be due to the presence of residual PCA residing on the surface of individual sheets. The Raman spectrum for the prepared graphene sample is shown in Fig. 1(c) in which all the characteristic peaks of graphene are present.24 The less intensity of D peak at 1350 cm−1 indicates that the sample is relatively defect free. A slight shift in the 2D peak shows that the graphene obtained is a mixture of single and multi-layered graphene which is less than 5 layers.24

Characterization of TGCs
Wide angle XRD patterns of bare TiO2 and TGCs with different concentrations of graphene (1 to 10 wt%) are compared as shown in Fig. 2(a). Bare TiO2 is highly crystalline and all the peaks can be indexed to pure anatase form (JCPDS No. 21-1272). The sharp peak at 25° shows the diffraction peak of TiO2 in the plane (101) with an interplanar distance of 0.35 nm. No specific diffraction patterns of graphene were observed in TGCs with lower weight percentages of graphene (trace TGC-1 in Fig. 2(a)). But as the weight percentage of graphene increased, a peak started to appear at 26.4° corresponding to graphenic carbon with an interplanar spacing of 0.34 nm corresponding to (002) plane of graphene,25 indicating the incorporation of graphene in the composite.26 All the anatase peaks remained intact.

The Raman spectra obtained for the different samples is shown in Fig. 2(b). Bare TiO2 and all TGCs showed a peak at about 146 cm−1, corresponding to the main Eg anatase vibration mode. Furthermore, peaks present at about 397 (B1g), 516 (A1g) and 637 (Eg) cm−1 are also characteristic of anatase TiO2.27 This also proves the integration of graphene in the composite. The UV-vis absorption spectra recorded for both the control and TGC-10 (Fig. 2(c)) shows that the spectrum for TGC-10 is red-shifted by about 10 nm, indicating the interaction between graphene and TiO2. Band gap of bare anatase TiO2 particles is about 3.2 eV. Incorporation of graphene reduces the band-gap to less than 3 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†), thereby shifting the absorption wavelength to the visible region.28 This could be useful for photocatalysis and photovoltaics.29Fig. 2(d) shows the survey XPS spectrum of TGC-10. The peak centered at 464.5 eV, assigned to Ti 2p3/2, is in good agreement with the binding energy values of Ti3+ in the pure anatase form.13 The main peak centred at about 284.6 eV corresponds to sp2 carbon atoms. XPS showing the different concentrations of graphene is given as Fig. S2, ESI†.
The SEM images of the bare TiO2 and TGCs with different weight percentages of graphene are shown in Fig. 3. Bare TiO2, prepared via the hydrothermal route was aggregated and the particles were irregular in shape and size (Fig. 3(a)), whereas with the incorporation of graphene, the TiO2 particles were monodispersed and the particle size was of the order of 10–15 nm (Fig. 3(b–d)). Carboxylic (–COOH) groups of PCA on the surface of graphene helps in anchoring TiO2 particles onto graphene without aggregation.30

A large area TEM image of TGC-10 is shown in Fig. 4(a). It clearly depicts the distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles on the graphene surface, which gives them good contact which will eventually increase the conductivity. The HRTEM image (Fig. 4(b)) shows the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm which corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2, which is in agreement with the XRD data. The lattice spacing of graphene sheets were found to be 0.34 nm. HRTEM images recorded from the edge of a graphene sheet clearly showed the rolled edges of graphene sheets.

Photocatalytic activity of TGCs
The studies on the photocatalytic effect of bare TiO2 (control) and TGCs were carried out by the degradation of MO dye under visible light. Among the different compositions of TGCs; TGC-10 showed the highest catalytic activity. This could be because of better adsorption of MO on TGCs with more amount of graphene. Fig. 5(a) shows UV-vis spectra of photodegradation of MO with different compositions of TGCs after exposure to visible light after 1 h. It is evident that the absorption intensity of MO at ∼ 465 nm decreased considerably in presence of TGCs than in presence of bare TiO2. The degradation was completed in 1 h for all the TGCs, amongst which TGC-10 was found to be more efficient (Fig. S3, ESI†). Fig. 5(b) shows the photoactivity of TGCs of different compositions in different time intervals. Bare TiO2 showed an apparent activity of about 31%, whereas TGC-1 and TGC-5 showed 44 and 69%, respectively. PCA stabilized graphene showed only a photoactivity of 18% (Fig. S4, ESI†). TGC-10 exhibited the highest photoactivity of 99.8% which is almost three times higher than that showed by bare TiO2. Most of the recent literatures on photocatalysis based on TiO2/graphene composites rely on the synthesis of graphene via GO reduction route.31–37 One of the major issues with GO reduction is that the reduced sheets tend to become less hydrophilic and quickly aggregate, if there is no stabilizer present.38 The presence of stabilizers might hinder the photoactivity and hence complete dye degradation is not achievable in most of the cases, whereas in some cases the complete degradation was observed in an average time of 2 h.34–37 For TGC-10, the complete dye degradation was observed within 1 h. This indicates that graphene directly derived from graphite is better than graphene via GO route in photocatalytic applications. However, when the graphene content was increased to 15 wt%, the photo activity was significantly lowered. This can be attributed to the fact that excess of graphene masks the TiO2 particles, thereby increasing the opacity. Moreover excess of graphene creates recombination centres at the interface with TiO2 which eventually affects the reactivity.39Fig. 5(c) shows the digital photograph of 0.5 mM MO degradation with TGC-10 treatment in 1 h.

The higher photoactivity for TGCs can be attributed to the following facts. Graphene plays a dual role in this process. It stabilizes the Ti3+ ions in the composite matrix and also forms heterojunctions with TiO2. Under visible light irradiation, transfer of photoinduced electrons is facilitated in presence of graphene. Not only does this allow for visible light absorption, but the presence of trap sites within the TiO2 bands increases the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers.40 The photo-generated electrons in the TGCs could easily migrate from the inner region to the surface to take part in the surface reaction to form radicals such as O2˙−.41
Size of TiO2 nanoparticles also plays a significant role in photocatalysis. With increased loading of graphene, TiO2 particle size was reduced to 10–15 nm (TGC-10). Reduction in particle size must have reduced the distance that electrons needed to travel to the reaction sites.31 Better π–π interactions between MO dye and defect free graphene enhanced the dye absorptivity.34 Besides, TGC-10 showed a BET surface area of 158 m2 g−1 (Fig. S5, ESI†). Bare TiO2 nanoparticles prepared via hydrothermal route generally exhibit surface areas in the range of 40–45 m2 g−1.21 The enhanced surface area of TGCs must also have helped in better dye adsorption on the active sites.
Fabrication of DSC using TGCs
The performance of TGCs in DSC was assessed in comparison with the bare TiO2 particles. It is found that 0.7 wt% was the optimum concentration which showed the best performance. The short circuit current density–voltage (JSC–V) response of TGCs vs. bare TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6(a) which showed an improved energy conversion efficiency of 4.26% for TGC-0.7. This was about 25% higher than that of bare TiO2, which showed an efficiency of 3.22%. When graphene is introduced into the TiO2, the JSC has been enhanced from 4.29 to 6.13 mA cm−2 while the open-circuit voltage and fill factor is maintained at 0.46 V and 60.27%, respectively. Since graphene is a zero band material, the calculated work function of graphene is close to that of FTO and thus the incorporation of graphene does not show much effect on the apparent Fermi level of TiO2. As a result the value of VOC remains same even after the addition of graphene.42,43I–V characteristics of bare TiO2 and TGCs are compared in Table S1, ESI†. Literature on DSCs fabricated using TiO2 decorated graphene samples report power conversion efficiencies in the range of 4.28–5.46% for 0.5 wt % of graphene loading.44,45 From our results, it can be concluded that TGCs with 0.1–0.5 wt% of graphene loading might give better photovoltaic performance. This is currently under investigation.

The large surface area of the composite allots a space for more dye adsorption thus harvesting more light and leading to more photoinduced electrons being injected from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of the TiO2-graphene.45 However, the dye deloading results show that the dye loading for the composite is less than that of bare TiO2 (Fig. 6(b)) because of reduced effective mass of TiO2.44 The higher surface area also increases the diffusion of electrolyte in the cell which eventually helps in regenerating dye molecules for improved photo response. As the percentage of graphene in the composite increases beyond 0.7 wt%, there is a credible decrease in the efficiency. This is due to the shielded light-harvesting of dye molecules by graphene, which impairs the light adsorption of the dye-sensitizer and reduces the number of photogenerated electrons.45
Conclusions
In summary, a simple and scalable method for the production of a few layered graphene and its composite with TiO2 nanoparticles is reported. The TGC composites showed excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light and amongst which TGC-10 was found to exhibit maximum activity. The dye degradation in presence of TGC-10 was completed in a short time span of 1 h. The photovoltaic performance of TGCs was evaluated and TGC-0.7 showed the best efficiency of 4.26%, which is about 25% higher than the bare TiO2 nanoparticles. This methodology opens up a scalable and low cost approach for obtaining robust materials for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications.
