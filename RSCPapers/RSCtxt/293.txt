    , Accepted 19th October 2022First published on 20th October 2022AbstractLayered bismuth oxychalcogenides have been demonstrated as potential candidates for high-speed and low-power electronics due to their outstanding environmental stability and high carrier mobility, but the photoelectric performance of bulk species is still far from satisfactory. Herein, a novel Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film with a type-II heterojunction has been successfully prepared by combining chemical bath deposition (CBD) and spin-coating technologies. The structure, morphology, optical and photoelectric properties of the samples were investigated systematically. The photoelectric current of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film was obtained as 32.49 μA cm−2 at 1 V, which is about 13.9-fold and 3.3-fold higher than those of bare Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS. An enhanced photoelectric response and photostability were achieved in the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film, and can be appropriately attributed to the improved separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers driven by the type-II heterojunction. This work offers a promising route to develop high-performance visible-light photoelectric devices with type-II heterojunctions.
Introduction
In recent decades, the efficient utilization of solar energy has been considered as one of the most promising routes to overcome the issues of the energy crisis and sustainable human development.1–3 Besides silicon-based solar cells, numerous promising photoelectric materials have been developed but are still far from commercial applications, such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),4 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),5 halide perovskites6 and ferroelectric photovoltaics.7 There are two general strategies for promoting the development of solar cells: one is the exploration of new materials but it is always hard to predict their structures and photoelectric properties;8 the other is the performance optimization of the known photoelectric materials.9 As one of the extensively studied photoelectric materials, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has received great attention due to its excellent photoelectric response and can be utilized as building blocks for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.10,11 Nevertheless, serious photocorrosion and insufficient light absorption can resist its further application in photoelectric devices.12 Therefore, many types of CdS-based heterojunctions have been proposed to suppress the photocorrosion and improve the photoelectric performance of CdS.13,14 Among these heterojunctions, the type-II heterojunction is a particularly interesting one, which can effectively promote the separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes.15,16
Bismuth oxychalcogenides with layered structures have attracted great attention due to the abundant stacking modes always leading to extraordinary properties, such as Bi2O2Se,17 Bi2O2S,18,19 and Bi4O4SeCl2.20 As a typical bismuth oxysulfide, Bi9O7.5S6 has been demonstrated to have great potential for application in photoelectric devices,21 but the photoelectric performance of bulk Bi9O7.5S6 is still less than satisfactory. Many methods have been developed to improve the photoelectric performance of Bi9O7.5S6, such as nanocrystallization22 and high-pressure technology.23 In addition, the preparation of composite materials is one of the important strategies to optimize material properties by constructing appropriate heterojunctions.24 Furthermore, the type-II heterojunction can facilitate the transfer of photogenerated carriers between the semiconductors, resulting in enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency as extensively demonstrated previously.25,26 Recently, a type-II heterojunction has been proposed in carbon nitride coupled Bi9O7.5S6 nanoplates with a highly selective visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction.27 Considering the matchable band alignment of Bi9O7.5S6 to that of CdS, the photoelectric properties can also be enhanced by forming a type-II heterojunction between Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS. In this work, a novel Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film has been successfully prepared by combining the CBD and spin-coating methods. Enhanced photoelectric performance and long-term stability have been achieved in the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film due to the formation of the type-II heterojunction. Consequently, the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film can be a promising candidate for photoelectric sensors or detectors.
Experimental section
Synthesis of film samples
A facile hydrothermal method was adopted for the preparation of Bi9O7.5S6 microcrystals, as reported in the literature.21 TheBi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film was prepared by spin-coating technology combined with chemical bath deposition (CBD) as follows. Firstly, a 1 cm × 1 cm indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with a sheet resistance of 25 Ω was used as the conductive substrate. Before the deposition of CdS, ITO was cleaned sequentially with a neutral soap solution, deionized water, alcohol, and acetone and dried with N2. Then, the ITO substrate was vertically immersed in the solution containing 0.55 mL of 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2, 6.5 mL of concentrated ammonia water (∼28 wt%), 1.903 g of thiourea, 74 mL of DI water, and 1 mL OF CH3COOH (37%). The deposition temperature was maintained at 65 °C, and the deposition time was 30 min. The as-prepared CdS/ITO film was then cleaned with DI water and absolute ethanol several times and then annealed at 350 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 15 mg of the Bi9O7.5S6 powder sample (obtained by grinding the Bi9O7.5S6 microcrystals into a powder) was suspended in 1 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a slurry that was then spin-coated onto the as-prepared CdS/ITO film. Eventually, the as-prepared thin-film samples were annealed at 350 °C for 6 h. The detailed synthesis route of the film samples is shown in Fig. S1.†
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction was carried out to confirm the crystal structure and purity of the samples, using a Rigaku D/Max-2000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV, 100 mA. To detect the morphologies, microstructures and chemical composition of the samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed on an FEI Quanta 200F microscope operating at 3 kV. To reveal the oxidation states of Bi, Cd, O and S, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with a non-monochromatized Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV) at a pressure lower than 10−9 mbar. The data were collected for Bi 4f, O 1s, Cd 3d and S 2s regions with the C 1s reference of 284.80 eV. The optical properties were recorded on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3100) at RT. UPS spectra were collected on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab250Xi with a photon energy of 21.22 eV (He I emission line, ∼2 × 10−9 mbar) under an applied bias voltage of −5 V. The Fermi edge of the film sample was calibrated with an Au sample for reference.
Photoelectric measurements
The photoelectric properties of the films were evaluated using an interactive source meter instrument (Model 2450, Keithley) with a 500 W xenon lamp as the simulated solar irradiation source (AM 1.5).
Results and discussion
The purity and crystallinity of the as-prepared Bi9O7.5S6 powder sample, and Bi9O7.5S6/ITO, Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO and CdS/ITO film samples were determined by the powder XRD measurement. As shown in Fig. 1, all the Bragg peaks of the Bi9O7.5S6 powder and film samples can be indexed well to the rhombohedral symmetry with a space group of Rm as previously solved by single-crystal XRD diffraction,21 which indicated the high purity and quality of the Bi9O7.5S6 powder and film samples. For the CdS/ITO film, all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the reported cubic phase CdS (JCPDS no. 80-0019) and cubic phase In2O3 (JCPDS no. 88-2610) from ITO. It can be found that no other diffraction peak can be observed from the XRD patterns of the Bi9O7.5S6 films coated on either CdS/ITO or ITO substrates. This can be attributed to the masking effect of the thick Bi9O7.5S6 (optimally ∼25 μm) coated layer compared with the thin CdS (∼630 nm) and ITO (∼100 nm for commercialization) bottom layers. The thickness and chemical composition of the film samples can be identified from the cross-sectional SEM images and EDS analysis as shown in Fig. 1b–e and Fig. S2.† From Fig. 1b, it can be found that a dense CdS film was coated on the ITO substrate using the CBD technique followed by annealing treatments, revealing the excellent film-forming ability of CdS as also extensively reported before.28–30 For both Bi9O7.5S6/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO films, the Bi9O7.5S6 layer consists of aggregated small particles, which seem to be somewhat incompact but still strongly adhesive as shown in Fig. 1c and d. Besides, the sandwich structure of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film can be visually distinguished from the enlarged portion of the SEM image as shown in Fig. 1e.

The characteristic absorbances of the film samples were examined by the UV-Vis-NIR spectra as shown in Fig. 2a. Compared with that of the CdS/ITO film, the absorption spectra of the Bi9O7.5S6/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO films display higher visible-light absorptions, which can be mainly attributed to the narrow bandgap and large coating thickness of the Bi9O7.5S6 layer.21 By extrapolating the Tauc plots31 of photon energy hν versus (αhν)2 (see Fig. 2b), the optical bandgaps of the CdS/ITO, Bi9O7.5S6/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO films were obtained as 2.29, 1.39 and 1.36 eV, respectively, which are very close to the reported values of 2.40 eV for CdS32 and 1.35 eV for Bi9O7.5S6.27 The similar bandgaps of the Bi9O7.5S6/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO films can be related to the thick Bi9O7.5S6 layer covered on the thin CdS layer, which masked the XRD signal for the CdS layer as well. Actually, the thickness of the film samples can considerably affect their optical properties as extensively reported before.33–35 In this work, the absorbances of the film samples were collected at their optimal thicknesses according to their thickness-dependent photoelectric performances discussed later.

The oxidation states of Bi, Cd, O and S in Bi9O7.5S6, CdS and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS were examined by using the XPS spectra as shown in Fig. S3.† Two characteristic peaks of Bi3+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states can be observed at 158.93 and 164.22 eV, and those of Cd2+ 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states can be observed at 404.72 and 411.51 eV, with reference to the reported XPS results for Bi9O7.5S621 and CdS36 (see Fig. S3a and b†). The chemisorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen can be detected from two O 1s peaks at 529.92 and 531.78 eV (see Fig. S3c†). The S 2s states of Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS were located at the binding energies of 226.04 eV and 225.59 eV, respectively (see Fig. S3d†). Notably, for the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite sample, all the peaks of Bi 4f, O 1s, Cd 3d and S 2p were shifted to lower deconvolution peak values compared to those of bare Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS, which could be related to the strong electronic coupling at the interface between CdS and Bi9O7.5S6 layers by forming the heterojunction structure.27 Generally, heterojunctions often prefer to form between two semiconductors with similar crystal structures, close atomic spacing and thermal expansion coefficients. Among these, lattice mismatch is a critical factor for the heterojunction formation between the semiconductors. A high lattice mismatch would result in serious strains and high interfacial defects.37 Normally, a high-quality heterojunction can be achieved in the semiconductors with a lattice mismatch of less than 5%. The lattice constants of Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS can be calculated from their XRD data as 5.8618 and 5.6831, respectively. Using the mismatch definition formula:  (as and ae are lattice constants of the two semiconductors), the lattice mismatch for Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS can be calculated as 3.09%, revealing the good lattice matching for the heterojunction formation between Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS.
In fact, the matchable band positions of the semiconductors can greatly affect their photoelectric performances by constructing the composite heterojunction.38,39 To verify the type of Bi9O7.5S6/CdS heterojunction, the band edges of Bi9O7.5S6 have been identified by UPS measurements. Commonly, the work function of semiconductors can be obtained through the equation: φ = hν − W, where hv = 21.22 eV (He I) and W represents the spectral width associated with the Fermi edge (EF) and secondary cutoff (Ecutoff) edge. From Fig. 3a, the Fermi edge (EF) has been calibrated to zero and the secondary cutoff (Ecutoff) edge can be evaluated as 16.66 eV by extrapolating the linear portion of the UPS plot. Thus, the work function of Bi9O7.5S6 can be calculated as 4.56 eV. From the enlarged valence band (VB) portion of the UPS curve (see the inset in Fig. 3a), the VB edge of Bi9O7.5S6 can be obtained as EVB ≈ 4.90 eV. Associated with the bandgap (Eg) and VB of Bi9O7.5S6, the conduction band (CB) edge for Bi9O7.5S6 can be calculated as 3.51 eV according to the empirical formula:40EVB = ECB + Eg. The VB and CB edges of Bi9O7.5S6 are consistent with those reported previously by XPS and theoretical calculations.27 Besides, the VB and CB edges for CdS have been previously determined as 6.32 eV and 3.92 eV, respectively.41 Accordingly, the CB edge of Bi9O7.5S6 is smaller than that of CdS, while the VB potential of CdS is much higher than that of Bi9O7.5S6, indicating the formation of a type-II heterojunction between Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS. The band-edge positions and charge transfer in the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film are schematically shown in Fig. 3b. After contacting each other, considering the higher Femi edge of Bi9O7.5S6 than that of CdS, the electrons will flow from Bi9O7.5S6 to CdS until the Fermi levels of the two semiconductors are aligned. At the interface, the positive charge will be accumulated on the Bi9O7.5S6 side and the negative charge will be accumulated on the CdS side, resulting in the formation of an inner electric field which can facilitate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improve the photoelectric performance.42,43 Under light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of Bi9O7.5S6 can be easily transferred to the CB of CdS driven by the interface electric field, while the photogenerated holes in the VB follow the reverse route as shown in Fig. 3b.

To check the photoelectric performance of the composite film, the device of ITO/Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO with a sandwich-like structure has been assembled as shown in Fig. 4a. From the I–V test (see Fig. 4b), a notable photoelectric response can be observed under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. Under both dark and light conditions, the I–V curves show a semiconducting behaviour. The transient photocurrent curves at a 1 V bias voltage also revealed the remarkable photoelectric effect. Two distinct states can be observed in the on/off photocurrent plots as shown in Fig. 4c. For comparison, the transient photocurrent of the bare Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS films has also been measured. By forming the composite film, the photocurrent density of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film is 32.49 μA cm−2, which is about 13.9-fold and 3.3-fold higher than those of bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO (2.33 μA cm−2) and CdS/ITO (9.91 μA cm−2) films, respectively. The improved photoelectric performance of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film is probably caused by the formation of an efficient type-II heterojunction between Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS, corresponding to the previously reported results.27 Compared with those of typical two-dimensional optoelectronic devices,44,45 the performance of this heterojunction device is somewhat inadequate, but it is still superior to those of most CdS-based devices.46,47 The response time of Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film has been obtained as 0.17 s at a 1 V bias voltage (see Fig. 4d), which is a little longer than the 0.05 s reported previously in bulk Bi9O7.5S6.21 Actually, the precision of instruments can greatly affect the accuracy of the response time, which can also be reflected in bare CdS/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/ITO films with a long interval time between the two adjacent data points (see Fig. S4†). The recovery time (about 0.49 s) is much slower than the rise time, which can be attributed to the photothermal effect as reflected by the continuously rising photocurrent after the sharp increase under the initial illumination.

It has been demonstrated that the thickness of film samples plays an important role in the performance of photoelectric devices.33,48,49 Thus, the thickness-dependent photoelectric properties of the bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO film and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film have been studied systematically under a 5 V bias voltage. The film thicknesses were estimated from the SEM images as shown in Fig. S5–7.† For the bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO films, the photocurrent increases first upon increasing the film thickness up to 25 μm and then drops down gradually as shown in Fig. 5a. Accordingly, the optimal film thickness of Bi9O7.5S6 can be roughly defined as 25 μm and fixed to check the effect of the CdS layer thickness on the photoelectric performance of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film. By increasing the CdS layer thickness, the highest photocurrent can be detected at its nominal optimal thickness of 630 nm (see Fig. 5b). To double verify the optimal thickness of the Bi9O7.5S6 layer in the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film, the CdS layer thickness was fixed at 630 nm. From Fig. 5c, the highest photocurrent was obtained at the optimal Bi9O7.5S6 layer thickness of 27 μm, which is very close to that of the bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO film. The relationship curves between the thickness and photocurrent for the bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO film and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film have been figured by solely using the transient photocurrent densities under illumination as the data points (see Fig. 5d). The thickness-dependent photoelectric performance can be interpreted from the best compromise between the light absorption and the photogenerated carrier transfer. The thicker the film, the stronger the light absorption, but the more serious the carrier recombination and the higher the transfer resistance.

Besides the film thickness, the effect of the applied voltage on the photoelectric properties of the film samples has also been investigated at their optimal thicknesses. Not surprisingly, the photocurrent increases quickly upon increasing the applied voltage as shown in Fig. 6a–c, which is consistent with the results reported in the literature.50,51 It can be found that the breakdown voltage for the bare CdS/ITO film was less than 10 V, while for both bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO films, it was less than 20 V. At 15 V, the photocurrent density of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film is as high as 4.12 mA cm−2, which is about 46 times higher than that of the bare Bi9O7.5S6/ITO film (∼0.09 mA cm−2). This confirms that the heterojunction can promote the separation of the photogenerated carriers and accelerate the charge transport, as previously reported.49,52 For the bare CdS/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/ITO films, the increasing trend of the photocurrent density is almost the same (see the inset in Fig. 6d). After forming the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film, the increasing trend of the photocurrent density is significantly stronger than those of the bare CdS/ITO and Bi9O7.5S6/ITO films (see Fig. 6d), which can be attributed to the photogenerated carrier transfer facilitated by the type-II heterojunction between the Bi9O7.5S6 and CdS, as clearly verified already in many composite films.53,54

To further assess the photoelectric performance of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film, the responsivity of the photodetectors can be calculated using the following formulas:55 Iph = Ilight − Idark(1) (2)where Ilight, Idark, Iph, p and S are current under illumination, dark current, photocurrent, power density of the light source and device effective area, respectively. The calculated R results of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film under different bias voltages are shown in Fig. 7. In this work, the photoelectric responsivity of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film is somewhat lower than those of the outstanding CdS-based composites such as CdS:Al,56 but still much higher than those of the intermediate ones such as CdS/ZnO47 and Si/CdS photodetectors.46 Considering that the thickness and morphology of the semiconductor films can greatly affect their photoelectric performances,33,48 it can be expected that the improved photoelectric performance can be achieved by optimizing the quality of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS composite film.

Commonly, the environmental stability of the photoelectric devices is another crucial factor strongly restricting their practical applications. To assess the long-term environmental stability, photoelectric tests were performed at 15 V after keeping the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO film in the atmosphere and under glovebox conditions at room temperature (RT) for several weeks. From Fig. 8a, the photocurrent shows an obvious decrease with prolonging the exposure time of the film in the atmosphere due to the heavy photocorrosion of CdS.57 After two weeks, the photocurrent of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO film remains 47.4%, which is still superior to that of bare CdS.56 It is worth noting that the photocurrent only decreases by 7.1% after keeping it in the glove box for two weeks, which confirms the accelerated photocorrosion of CdS with moisture. It has been demonstrated that the photocorrosion process of CdS is mainly caused by the rapid oxidation of surface lattice sulfur via the photoproduction holes after visible-light irradiation. By forming the heterojunction structure, the CdS-based composites can suppress the oxidation of surface lattice sulfur, leading to superior photostability.28,57,58 Additionally, the photocorrosion of CdS usually occurs in a moist environment. Thus, a dense Bi9O7.5S6 layer covering the surface of the CdS layer can effectively prevent CdS contacting moisture. Consequently, CdS can withstand against photocorrosion. The long-term stability of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO film was also confirmed by XRD measurements. No notable signal of the impurity can be observed from the XRD pattern of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO film kept in the glove box for 2 weeks (see Fig. S8†). However, obvious impurity peaks can be found from the XRD pattern of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO film kept in air for 2 weeks, corresponding to the significant decline of its photoelectric performance.

Conclusions
In summary, a Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film was successfully prepared by spin-coating Bi9O7.5S6 nanoparticles on a CdS/ITO substrate. The formation of a type-II heterojunction has been verified in the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film through UPS and light absorption tests, which could greatly facilitate the separation and migration of photoexcited carriers. Compared with the bare CdS and Bi9O7.5S6 films, the photocurrent density of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film at 1 V bias voltage under AM 1.5 G illumination was increased by 13.9 and 3.3 times, respectively. Excellent stability of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film can be achieved by keeping such a film in a glove box. The superior photoelectric performance of the Bi9O7.5S6/CdS/ITO composite film can be attributed to the formation of the type-II heterojunction between the Bi9O7.5S6 and the CdS layers. This study not only enriches the variety of CdS-based photoelectric composites, but also extends the application of bismuth oxysulfides.
