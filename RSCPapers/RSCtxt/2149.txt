    , Accepted 19th August 2020First published on 19th August 2020AbstractConstructing two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures with novel physical properties is regarded as a promising strategy to obtain desirable optoelectronic devices. Here, by systematic first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the 2D blue phosphorene/Sc2CX2 (X = O, F) van der Waals heterostructures are robust type-II band alignment semiconductors with an indirect band gap, and exhibit low exciton binding energies as well as having a strong light-harvesting ability in the UV-visible region. Remarkably, both are found to be potential photocatalysts for water splitting in acidic and/or neutral solutions. Interestingly, the external strain can significantly increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the blue phosphorene/Sc2CF2 heterostructure up to 20.87% (increased by 36%). These results indicate that the blue phosphorene/Sc2CX2 heterostructures will have extensive application prospects in the field of solar energy utilization.
1 Introduction
Sustainable social development and environmental protection motivate people in the search for green and renewable energies to replace fossil fuels. Solar energy is one potential alternative energy source and is particularly attractive due to its inexhaustibility, accessibility and cleanliness. In recent years, the direct utilization of solar energy, such as solar photovoltaics and photocatalytic water splitting, has drawn extensive and increasing attention.1 It is well recognized that a promising photovoltaic material should satisfy several criteria: high photon-harvesting efficiency in the visible/UV light region, low exciton recombination rate and high carrier mobility. Besides, to be an efficient photocatalyst, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) must straddle the redox potential of water. That is, the CBM should lie at a more positive level than the water reduction potential (VH+/H2: − 4.44 eV), while the VBM should be more negative than the water oxidation potential (VO2/H2O: − 5.67 eV) in photocatalytic water splitting reactions.2 Therefore, the band gap for water splitting must exceed 1.23 eV and be smaller than about 3.20 eV to capture a significant fraction of the visible spectrum.3 In recent decades, a series of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),2,4 black phosphorene5 and Maxene,6–10 have been proposed and are expected to have good application prospects in solar cells, photocatalysis, and so forth. However, photo-excited carriers in the single component 2D materials are usually not well-separated spatially, which can cause a high rate of electron–hole recombination and thus reduce the solar energy conversion. A possible solution is to fabricate a type-II van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) by putting a monolayer on top of another monolayer,3,11 where photogenerated electrons and holes are confined separately in different building blocks, thus reducing the recombination rate. Additionally, the range of light-absorption may be broadened, which will enhance the utilization of solar energy. As a consequence, developing heterostructures with type II band alignments is in great demand.
Recently, a new elemental 2D material labelled as blue phosphorene (BlueP) was theoretically predicted12 and experimentally fabricated by epitaxial growth on Au(111)13 and GaN(001)14 substrates. Theoretical calculations reported that BlueP has a larger band gap and higher hole mobility (1700 cm2 V−1 s−1) than black phosphorene15,16 and its band gap can be modulated in a large range by applying external strains or electric fields.12,15 Another new family of 2D materials named MXene, including a series of 2D transition-metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been produced by isolating elementary MX layers from the bulk MAX phase,17 where M, A, and X represent an early transition metal, a IIIA or IVA element and carbon or nitrogen, respectively. Most bare MXenes show metallic features with the absence of a band gap.17 However, they can transform from a metallic state to a semiconducting state by surface functionalization. For example, monolayer Ti2CO2, Hf2CO2, Zr2CO2 and Sc2CF2, Sc2C(OH)2, and Sc2CO2 were predicted to be semiconductors with band gap values ranging from 0.24 to 1.8 eV, using PBE functional calculations.18 In particular, the Sc2CO2 and Sc2CF2 monolayers are demonstrated to have high carrier mobilities and outstanding optical absorption in the visible light region.19 By applying either external strain or an electric field, the monolayer Sc2CO2 undergoes a transition from an indirect to direct band gap semiconductor, and its band gap can be significantly modulated.20,21 More interestingly, BlueP shares a similar hexagonal crystal structure and nearly identical lattice constants with 2D Sc2CX2 (X = O, F), which is beneficial to the growth of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 bilayer in the laboratory. Meanwhile, we find that the VBM and CBM of BlueP are lower than those of the Sc2CX2 monolayers, indicating that type-II heterostructures could be realized between these monolayers. Therefore, the fabrication of BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures are highly expected and of great interest.
In this work, we focus on the exploration of BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures as potential photocatalytic or photovoltaic materials. Based on density functional theory (DFT), we first optimized the geometry of monolayer materials (BlueP, Sc2CO2, and Sc2CF2) to obtain their stable configurations. Then we determine the relative stabilities of the heterostructures with different stacking configurations, followed by the study of their electronic structures, band alignments, as well as optical absorption properties. Finally, we investigate the strain effect on the bandgaps, band edge positions, as well as power conversion efficiencies of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures.
2 Computational methods
In this work, we perform a comprehensive first-principles investigation using the projected augmented wave (PAW) method22 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).23 For the structural relaxations, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is employed.22,24 The computationally more expensive hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional method25,26 is used to obtain more accurate band gaps and band edge positions to correct the underestimation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The effect of weak vdW interactions between the two monolayers is dealt with using the DFT-D2 method,27 which has proven to be reliable for describing various vdWHs.3,28–31 A vacuum space in the z-direction of more than 35 Å is used to avoid the neighboring slab interactions. The plane wave energy cutoff of 500 eV, the energy convergence criteria of 10−5 eV, the force convergence of 0.01 eV Å−1, and the Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 31 × 31 × 1 (15 × 15 × 1), for the PBE (HSE06) simulations are sufficient for structural optimization and electronic property calculations.
The binding energies (Eb) of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures are calculated by Eb = EH − EBlueP − ESc2CX2, where EH, EBlueP, and ESc2CX2 represent the total energies of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures, BlueP and Sc2CX2 monolayers, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
First, the geometric structures and electronic properties of the freestanding BlueP and Sc2CX2 monolayers with the most stable structue6,13,20,32 are investigated. In the BlueP monolayer, a P atom is bonded with three neighboring P atoms, generating a buckled honeycomb structure, as presented in Fig. 1(a). In agreement with ref. 18 and 20, the Sc2CO2 and Sc2CF2 monolayers are found to have different stable configurations, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively. In the Sc2CO2 monolayer, one functional O layer (OI) is located on the hollow site of three neighbouring C atoms and the other (OII) points to a C atom; while in the Sc2CF2 monolayer, the two terminated F layers are stacked on top of hollow sites among three neighbouring C atoms. It is worth emphasizing that the structure of the Sc2CO2 monolayer is dissymmetric along the vertical direction. Therefore, as its different sides are in contact with the other 2D material, different contact interfaces induce different electronic structures (see later discussion). The optimized lattice constants for BlueP, Sc2CO2 and Sc2CF2 monolayers are 3.27, 3.41 and 3.25 Å, respectively, which makes it easy for them to form heterostructures with precise stacking in vertical directions. Moreover, the band structures of BlueP, Sc2CO2 and Sc2CF2 monolayers calculated by HSE06 functionals are shown in Fig. 1(d), (e) and (f), respectively; and the results show that all three monolayers are indirect band gap semiconductors, and their band gaps are 2.74, 2.91 and 1.86 eV at the HSE06 level, respectively. All of the results agree well with previous reports.6,13,20,32

We now investigate the geometric structures of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures. The lattice mismatch between Sc2CO2 (Sc2CF2) and BlueP is about 4.11% (0.61%), which is in an acceptable range and accessible in experimental synthesis because their interfaces are flexible and can accommodate this mismatch.6,13 We note that the BlueP/Sc2CO2 heterostructures have two different contact types because of the structural dissymmetry along the vertical direction in the Sc2CO2 sublayer.33 As illustrated in Fig. S1,† in the first type (α-type), the OI sublayer in Sc2CO2 touches the BlueP monolayer, whereas in the other one (β-type), the OII layer in Sc2CO2 connects with the BlueP monolayer. The close negative binding energies mean that both BlueP/Sc2CO2 heterostructures are all stable and possess similar stabilities (see the ESI: Fig. S1†). The latter have been investigated and found to have a very small band gap (0.218 eV),34 which could mean poor photovoltaic or photocatalytic properties. Thus, in this paper we focus on the former, with a view to obtaining efficient photovoltaic solar cells or photocatalysis for water splitting. Here, we consider six typical stacking configurations in terms of rotation angles (i.e., 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°) of the BlueP with respect to the Sc2CX2 layers. All of these configurations are fully optimized as illustrated in Fig. S2.† To confirm the thermodynamic stability of the most stable heterostructure among these configurations, binding energies (Eb) are calculated. Binding energies along with the interlayer distance (D) are illustrated in Table S1.† Negative binding energies for all configurations suggest that the fabrication of BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures are energetically feasible. An interlayer distance of about 3.3 Å verifies the vdW interaction between these layers. The smallest Eb and D suggest that the most stable structures of BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 are Model I and Model II, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. Therefore, both cases are studied in the following.

The projected band structures of (c) BlueP/Sc2CO2 and (d) BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructures, in which the blue, purple and grey dots indicate the contributions from the BlueP, Sc2CO2 and Sc2CF2 layers, respectively. The corresponding projected density of states are given in (c) and (d) (right-hand pane). All the results are from the HSE06 calculations. 
The projected band structures of the heterostructures given by the DFT/HSE06 calculations are plotted in Fig. 2(c and d). The results show that the BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructures possess an indirect band gap with a gap value of 1.91 and 1.49 eV, respectively. The band gap values are larger than the minimum (1.23 eV) required for the photocatalysis reactions, highlighting their potential application as visible light photocatalysts.35 Also, we can see that the VBM of the heterojunction is dominated by the Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) layer, while the CBM is mainly contributed to by the states from the BlueP layer. Therefore, a type-II band alignment is formed at the BlueP/Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) interface, which will spontaneously separate the free electrons and holes, enabling high-efficiency solar energy conversion. To show more detail, the projected density of states (PDOS) were also calculated using the HSE06 functional (see Fig. 2(c and d) (right pane)). It is clear that the CBM is mainly contributed to by the p states of the P atoms, while the VBM is dominated by the p states of C and O atoms, and the d states of the Sc atoms, which further demonstrate the type-II nature of the heterostructures. Meanwhile, we note that there are few p states of the P atoms near the VBM, which probably hampers the spatial charge separation, though such an effect is very weak.
The band alignment is crucial in the design and application of optoelectronic devices. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (b), both the CBM and VBM of the BlueP layer are lower in energy than those of the Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) layer, verifying the intrinsic type-II band alignment. As we all know, band offset is the driving force for the formation of charge transfer excitons and turns out to be essential for optoelectronic device applications. The valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO) between the BlueP and Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) layers are about 0.22 (1.33) and 0.91 (0.30) eV, respectively. When the heterostructure is illuminated with light, the electrons with energy obtained from the sunlight leap into the CB from the VB. Then these photogenerated electrons on the CB of the Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) sheet can be easily shifted to that of the BlueP layer due to the observed CBO. Conversely, the photogenerated holes on the VB of the BlueP sheet transfer to that of the Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) layer because of the VBO.

Besides, the chemical interaction in 2D heterostructures will induce charge transfer between adjacent layers. Bader charge analyses show that about 0.02 (0.007)|e| per unit are transferred from BlueP to the Sc2CO2(Sc2CF2) monolayer, which means that an intrinsic built-in electric field (Ein) is induced with its direction pointing from the BlueP layer to the Sc2CX2 layer. Specifically, Ein acts in the opposite (same) direction to the transfers of photogenerated electrons (holes) and thus inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As a result, under the combined effect of intrinsic Ein and band offset, the photogenerated carriers can be effectively separated on different surfaces, enabling high efficiency solar energy conversion.36
To further qualitatively evaluate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, the exciton binding energies (Eeb) are calculated using the Mott–Wannier model:37Eeb = 13.6μex/(m0ε2), where μex, m0 and ε are the effective exciton mass, the electron mass and static dielectric constant, respectively. Therein, μex is given by μex = memh/(me + mh). The effective mass of the holes and electrons are calculated by fitting parabolic functions near the VBM and CBM along the high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone, respectively, given by, m = ℏ2(∂2E/∂K2)−1, where ℏ is the reduced Planck’s constant, K is the wave-vector, and E(k) denotes the energy. ε is the sum of electronic (εel) and ionic (εion) contributions. Here, for 2D materials, ε = (εion−x + εion−y+ εel−x+εel−y)/2. As summarized in Table S2,† the Eeb values for BlueP, Sc2CO2 and Sc2CF2 monolayers are found to be 1.19, 0.24 and 0.04 eV, respectively. The BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 vdWHs present Eeb values of 0.12 and 0.07 eV, respectively, which is comparable to, or even lower than, their separate components, and hence will facilitate separation of the charge carriers.
As previously mentioned, the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures have decent bandgaps as visible light photocatalysts. Here, their photocatalytic activities are examined by comparing their band edge positions to the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. The pH dependent reduction potential for H+/H2 and the oxidation potential for O2/H2O can be determined by , respectively.38,39 As depicted in Fig. 3(a), the band edges of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 heterostructure can perfectly straddle the water redox potential at pH = 0 and 7, which indicates that the BlueP/Sc2CO2 heterostructure might be a water-splitting photocatalyst candidate, whether in acidic or neutral environments. For the BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructure (Fig. 3(b)), its band edges straddle the water redox potential at pH ≃7, indicating its overall water-splitting activity in neutral solutions.
Wide, strong optical absorption is a key factor to achieve high energy efficiency in photoelectronic devices. The optical absorptions of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures are calculated with the HSE06 functional and are displayed in Fig. 4. For comparison purposes, the optical absorptions of the corresponding monolayers are also provided. The computational details have been fully described in our previous work.3,11 It is seen that the BlueP and Sc2CO2 monolayers have strong ultraviolet absorption but hardly absorb visible light, while the Sc2CF2 monolayer shows the reverse characteristics. Fascinatingly, the designed two heterostructures show stronger absorption in the visible-UV light region compared with the constituent monolayers, which facilitates their solar energy harvesting capability. This arises from the fact that the new optical transitions can be induced by the interlayer coupling and charge transfer in the heterostructures.3,11,40–42

As we know, concomitant strain in 2D materials cannot be erased. Here, we will discuss the effect of strain on the electronic properties of the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures. The applied in-layer biaxial strain (ε) is defined as ε = [(a −a0)/a0] × 100%, where a and a0 are the optimized lattice constants with and without strain, respectively. The evolution of the band gaps of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructures with strain are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively, together with the strain energy. It is obvious that the band gap of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 heterostructure increases monotonically when the compressive strain changes from −8% to −4%, while the band gap decreases monotonically with changing strain from −4% to 8%. Similar behaviour can be found in the BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructure. To check whether the strains considered here are all within the elastic limit, we calculate the strain energy per atom, Es = (Estrained − Eunstrained)/n, where n is the number of atoms in the unit cell. As shown in Fig. 5(a and b) (right-hand y-axis), the strain energy curve is smooth as a quadratic function under the biaxial strain, indicating that all the strains considered are fully reversible and, therefore, are within the elastic limit. The band edge positions of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructures under different biaxial strains are plotted in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. Obviously, the CBM and VBM of the Sc2CX2 layer shift up under compression-to-tension strains, while undulation occurs in the CBM and VBM of the BlueP layer, which can affect the photovoltaic performance (see later discussion). We note that the systems undergo a transition from type-II to type-I band alignment in the vicinity of −4% strain, where both the CBM and VBM of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterobilayers, come from the BlueP and Sc2CF2 component, respectively. Usually, the type-I alignment band is associated with a significant rate of recombination, which is detrimental to photocatalysis.43 However, when the compressive strain is further increased, the shifting of the CBM and VBM causes the heterostructure to return to type-II band alignment, in which case the donor and acceptor are transposed. Obviously, the electronic properties of the heterostructures can be effectively modulated by the in-layer biaxial strain. This arises from the fact that the applied in-layer strain can change the distances and interactions among inner-layer and inter-layer atoms, which induces the charge redistribution in the heterostructures and further leads to the reconstruction of the built-in electric field. In short, such changes of the bandgaps and band levels of the heterostructures under strain are a result of multiple factors. At the same time, we find that the photocatalytic properties for water splitting are preserved under small compressive or tensile strains.
 Fig. 5  Strain effects on the band gap, strain energy and band alignments of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 (a and c) and BlueP/Sc2CF2 (b and d), heterostructures. The results are from vdW-DFT/HSE06 calculations. Water redox potential positions at pH 0 and pH = 7 are denoted by the green dashed line and blue short dashed lines, respectively. 
The electronic structures show that the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures may be potential candidates for solar cells. We further estimate the maximum power conversion efficiencies (η) of BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures as photovoltaic solar cells using Scharber’s method,44 which is defined as follows:  where Edg, ΔEc and J(ℏω) are the optical bandgap of the donor, the CBO value and the AM1.5 solar energy flux, respectively. In the two heterostructures, the Sc2CX2 layer is the donor because of its higher band edge, and BlueP is the acceptor, as shown in Fig. 3. Here, we take the calculated electronic gap from HSE06 to represent the optical gaps of donor materials (see the ESI for further discussion: Discussion S1†). In the BlueP/Sc2CO2 heterostructure, the overlarge Edg or ΔEc is disadvantageous to obtain high power conversion efficiency. Its maximum η value can only reach 4.5% at −6% biaxial strain (see Fig. 6). However, in the BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructure, the compressive strain profitably reduces the Edg and ΔEc and thus significantly improves the PCE. A PCE as high as ∼20.87% can be achieved under the −3% compressive strain, as shown in Fig. 6, which increased by about 36% compared with that of the pristine system, and is comparable to those of the recent reported BlackP-based heterostructures, such as BlackP/MoS2 (∼17.0%)45 and BlackP-BCN (∼22.0%)46 systems. This implies that the BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructure is also a promising material to be used in photovoltaic cells.

The spheres and pentagons on the contour represent the efficiency limits of the BlueP/Sc2CO2 and BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructures under the different strains, respectively. 
4 Conclusions
In summary, we design new two-dimensional BlueP/Sc2CX2 (X = O, F) heterostructures on the basis of first-principles calculations within density functional theory. The stability, electronic and optical properties and potential photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications of the heterostructures are investigated. Because of the low lattice mismatch as well as the negative formation energy, the BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures should not be difficult to synthesize experimentally. And the two heterostructures here are found to possess type-II band alignments, low exciton binding energies and efficient photo-absorption. These properties facilitate the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and solar energy conversion. Specifically, the proper band edges indicate that both heterostructures have potential for applications in sunlight-driven water splitting. Simultaneously, the power conversion efficiency of the BlueP/Sc2CF2 heterostructure with −3% strain can be as high as ∼21% for photovoltaic solar cells. Our investigation highlights the possibility of BlueP/Sc2CX2 heterostructures as photocatalysts and/or their photovoltaics applications, and offers guidance for extending their application areas in electronics and optoelectronic devices.
