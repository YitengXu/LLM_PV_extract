    , Accepted 4th January 2013First published on 7th January 2013AbstractZnO photonic crystals (ZnO-PCs) with large area and high quality were prepared by a facile auto-forced impregnation method. The resulting ZnO-PCs exhibited remarkable photocatalytic performance and photocorrosion inhibition compared with porous and commercial nanoparticle ZnO.
Photocatalysis, as a very promising technology for environmental remediation and solar energy conversion, has attracted great attention.1 However, the low quantum efficiency, low utilization of solar light and photocatalytic stability greatly limit its practical applications.1,2 For example, ZnO, a classic and widely used semiconductor with conspicuous optical and electrochemical properties, is considered as one of the most promising materials, and even shows higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2.3 Unfortunately, ZnO possesses the drawback of the photocorrosion effect in photocatalysis which causes decreases in photocatalytic efficiency and stability, which greatly limit its practical applications.4 Extensive studies have been devoted to addressing these problems such as doping or hybridization,5–9 however, nanoparticles usually give rise to some problems of reutilization and separation,10 and there are few reports about the photostability of pure phase ZnO.
Recently, hierarchical structures have attracted intense attention owing to their superior photocatalytic performance, such as nanotube arrays, porous architectures and photonic crystals, etc.11–13 Among these, photonic crystals (PCs) with the inverse opal structure are particularly attractive, because they not only possess ordered pores, but also enhanced light absorption and harvesting based on the PC effect.14–17 Some progress has demonstrated that PCs presented prominent performance in Li-ion batteries, solar cells, photocatalysis and so on due to their specific structure and PC effect.13–20 However, to our knowledge, there has so far been no report on the use of ZnO photonic crystals (ZnO-PCs) in photocatalytic applications. Thus, what would happen if ZnO was fabricated into PCs?
Conventionally, ZnO-PCs have been fabricated by several methods such as chemical vapor deposition,21 atomic layer deposition,22 electrodeposition,23 sol–gel technique,24 and templated salt precipitation and chemical conversion.25 However, all the synthetic processes are complicated, and require some special equipment, or fail to avoid the formation of an overlayer.
Herein, an auto-forced impregnation method was developed firstly for the synthesis of ZnO-PCs using carboxyl modified polystyrene (PS) spheres self-assembled into the opal template, and a nitrate solution as the infiltration precursor. As tested, the as-synthesized ZnO-PCs showed considerable quantum efficiency and photostability enhancement for pollutant elimination compared with disordered porous ZnO (ZnO-P) and commercial nanoparticulate ZnO (ZnO-N).

Fig. 1 shows the fabrication process of ZnO-PCs via this innovative and versatile approach. Firstly, the opal template is self-assembled by using carboxyl modified PS spheres which improves the orderly arrangement of PS spheres and mechanical strength of the template due to hydrogen bonding linkage among carboxyl groups from the surfaces of the PS spheres (Fig. S1a†).14 It can be proved from the hexagonally close-packed PS spheres in highly ordered array (Fig. S1†), the sharp reflection peaks (Fig. S2a†) and brilliant colors (top row of Fig. S2d†) are caused by Bragg diffraction.26 Secondly, the opal template is immersed in a nitrate solution containing absolute ethanol. After the precursor was infiltrated into the PS templates (denoted as PSZ), these reflection peaks were all red-shifted and remained sharp (Fig. S2b†), demonstrating homogeneous impregnation and high filling ratio of the precursor.19 This could also be identified from the uniform color of these PSZs (middle row of Fig. S2d†). Lastly, ZnO-PCs are obtained through calcination of PSZs at 400 °C (ZnO-270, ZnO-295 and ZnO-351 represent ZnO-PCs fabricated from 270, 295 and 351 nm PS spheres, respectively). Its PC properties are verified by the distinctive Bragg reflection peaks (Fig. S2c†) centered at 410 nm, 450 nm and 530 nm (a reference sample ZnO-P shows no reflection peak except the intrinsic absorption of ZnO around 380 nm) and the resulting different colors which are visible to the naked eye (bottom row of Fig. S2d†).15 The high filling ratio and homogeneous precursor impregnation are essential and crucial to prepare PCs with large area and prominent PC properties.27,28 This approach brings about several highlights for facilitating the precursor infiltration: (i) the electrostatic interaction between metallic cations and PS spheres (zeta potential of the series of PS latex is ca. −40 to −70 mV due to the carboxyl groups); (ii) low viscosity of the precursor solution and surface wettability of PS spheres improved by the absolute ethanol;29 and (iii) the solution flowability triggered by ethanol evaporation from the precursor. The electrostatic interaction and ethanol osmotic force as well as capillary force provide a combined driving force to promote the precursor impregnation like a reported forced impregnation and vacuum method, in which forced power was supplied from an external vacuum pump.27,28 Therefore, this strategy is named as an auto-forced impregnation method. To control the synthesis of high quality ZnO-PCs by this approach with one time infiltration, detailed experimental parameters were investigated (Fig. S3†). The results indicate that the integral ZnO-PCs could be obtained as the mass of ZnNO3 changed in the range of 3–4 g and the volume ratio of water/ethanol varied within a certain range (12/8–8/12). Furthermore, this general route is also proved to be effective in fabricating other metal oxide PCs (Fig. S4†). Compared with previous reports about preparing metal oxide PCs,21–28 this method is simple, controllable and friendly.

Scan electron microscopy (SEM) images further identify the large area and high quality of ZnO-PCs fabricated by our approach. As shown in Fig. 2, ZnO-PCs exhibit highly ordered periodicity and spherical pore interconnectivity with larger areas (∼104 μm2) and smaller shrinkage (<10%) (Table S1†) than the previous reports (102 to 103 μm2, 25–35%).25–28 Moreover, the thicknesses of ZnO-PCs are ca. 2.7 μm. The hexagonal close-packed and strictly ordered fcc structure of ZnO-PCs are clearly evident and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the expected hexagonal pattern in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) image (Fig. 2c).30 The clear and continuous ordered lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2d) reveal the highly single-crystalline characteristic of ZnO-PCs. X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. S5†) of the samples also show high crystallinity and are identified as the pure phase ZnO (JPCDS no. 36-1451). The compositions of these samples were detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S5d†), no extra peaks belonging to impurity were observed except for the elements of Si and Ca from the glass substrate, and Zn from the sample. Moreover, the intensity of the Zn peak increases in the order ZnO-351, ZnO-295, ZnO-270 and ZnO-P. More light will spread inside of ZnO-PCs, while ZnO-P will harvest more light just on its film surface. That could be confirmed by the diffuse reflectance spectra of ZnO samples (Fig. S2c†), in which ZnO-PCs show higher light harvesting than ZnO-P in the visible region due to the PC effect. This will result in good photocatalytic activity.

Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) has been demonstrated to be a model reaction for evaluation of the characteristics of these ZnO-PCs. For comparison, ZnO-P and ZnO-N films with the same thickness (Fig. S5a and b†) as ZnO-PCs were prepared. As shown in Fig. 3a, ZnO-PCs exhibited much higher photocatalytic efficiency than ZnO-P and ZnO-N with pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, and the apparent reaction rate constant (denoted as k) over ZnO-351 is about 2.5 times as high as that over ZnO-N. Moreover, ZnO-PCs also display higher performance for photocatalytic degradation of colourless 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) compared to ZnO-P and ZnO-N (Fig. S6†), which authenticates the superiority of ZnO-PCs in liquid photocatalysis. The enhanced photocatalytic activities of ZnO-PCs can be mainly attributed to the following reasons: (1) ZnO-PCs have a larger surface area than do ZnO-N and ZnO-P (Table S2†); (2) the PC effect enhances the light harvesting; (3) the interconnected nano-framework facilitates efficient charge transport to the reaction sites, and the highly ordered channels can efficiently transport the reactant/product molecules to arrive at/leave the active sites on the framework walls.13,15–19 Therefore, the incident light and photogenerated electrons and holes would be utilized much more efficiently in the photocatalytic reaction, thus improving the quantum efficiency.

The photostability and reusability of ZnO-PCs for photocatalytic degradation of dyes are evaluated by XRD, XPS and recycling tests (Fig. 3b and S7–9†). Clearly, no significant changes in the crystalline structure, surface composition and photocatalytic activities are observed even after five successive cycles. However, the photoactivities of ZnO-N and ZnO-P decreased inevitably with recycle times because of known photocorrosion of ZnO.4 Normally, ZnO coupled with other materials is necessary to restrain its photocorrosion.5–9 In contrast, the pure phase ZnO-PCs herein are photostable in the photocatalytic process.
It is well known that ZnO suffered from photocorrosion due to photooxidation of ZnO to Zn2+ and O2 by photogenerated holes under light irradiation.4 Once the holes were generated, either it detached from the oxide surface (surface dissolution), oxidized dye directly or reacted with OH− generating ˙OH.1 The high photostability of ZnO-PCs suggests that the reaction between the photogenerated holes and reductant is kinetically faster than the Zn2+ dissolution reaction on the walls surface,31 thus preventing occurrence of photocorrosion of ZnO-PCs. There would be more ˙OH generated in the photocatalytic process. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement was applied to detect ˙OH. As shown in Fig. 4a and S10,† the intensity of ˙OH signal of ZnO-PCs is medium and stable growth is maintained from the beginning of irradiation, and then it exceeds the intensity of ZnO-N and ZnO-P with rapid increase. This demonstrates that the photogenerated holes are trapped by OH− to generate ˙OH radicals efficiently. The intensity change of ˙O2− signal with the similar tendency is also shown in Fig. 4b, which indicates highly efficient photoinduced charge separation and transfer. To confirm the above analysis, transient photocurrent responses of the samples were detected at zero applied bias voltage (Fig. 4c). The photocurrent intensity demonstrates electron generation capacity and electron transfer effectiveness. Interestingly, the higher photocurrent intensity corresponds to the higher intensities of active species and photocatalytic activities. These behaviors are also supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Fig. 4d); for ZnO-PCs, the impedance components are supposed to be reduced, which means efficient electron mobility through the ZnO electrode.

In summary, various metal oxide PCs with different photonic stop bands were successfully synthesized by a facile approach. The resulting ZnO-PCs exhibited promising photocatalytic activities and photocorrosion inhibition for photooxidation of environment pollutants under UV-Vis light due to the synergistic effect of the inverse opal structure and the PC effect. The method and findings reported might open up a route for fabrication of various functional materials with advanced properties in diverse fields.
