    , Accepted 30th December 2018First published on 4th January 2019AbstractElectrochemical reduction of the naturally abundant nitrogen (N2) in aqueous solutions under ambient conditions is a quite promising way for ammonia (NH3) synthesis, in which the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts is a key scientific issue. Herein, by means of extensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we proposed that a boron-interstitial (Bint)-doped C2N layer can act as a metal-free electrocatalyst for N2 fixation and reduction to NH3. Our computations revealed that the Bint-doped C2N layer can sufficiently activate the N2 molecule through the “acceptance-donation” process due to its significant positive charge and magnetic moment on the B dopant. In particular, the subsequent N2 reduction reaction prefers to proceed via the enzymatic mechanism with a rather low limiting potential (−0.15 V), suggesting its superior catalytic performance for N2 reduction. Importantly, the Bint-doped C2N layer possesses comparable stability to the experimentally available S-doped one and thus holds great promise for experimental synthesis. Thus, by carefully controlling the doping sites, the B-doped C2N layer can be utilized as a quite promising metal-free catalyst with high-efficiency for N2 reduction, which may provide useful guidance for further facilitating sustainable NH3 synthesis.
1. Introduction
As the largest chemical product on the Earth, ammonia (NH3) is not only an essential building block for producing synthetic chemicals, such as fertilizers, medicaments, dyes, explosives, and resins,1–4 but is also an important carbon-free energy carrier due to its large hydrogen capacity (17.6 wt%) and high energy density (4.3 kWh h−1).5–8 Currently, the large-scale production of NH3 mainly relies on the Haber–Bosch process, which not only requires high temperature (300–500 °C) and high pressure (100–300 atm),9 but also accounts for more than 1% of the world's energy supply10–12 and generates more than 1.9 metric tons of CO2 per metric ton of NH3 produced.13–15 Therefore, it is highly imperative to develop alternative processes that have the potential to overcome the limitations of the Haber–Bosch process.
Encouraged by biological N2 fixation via nitrogenase enzymes under ambient conditions through multiple proton and electron transfer steps,16–19 the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR), ideally powered by clean/renewable energies (e.g., solar or wind), represents a promising and attractive approach for sustainable NH3 production under ambient conditions, in which the N2 molecules in air are used as the nitrogen source, and the protons are provided by electrochemical water splitting, and electrons are driven toward the electrocatalyst surface by an applied voltage.20–26 The NRR process, however, remains greatly challenging due to N2 activation and demands highly efficient electrocatalysts.2,20,21
Currently, a variety of transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been reported both experimentally and theoretically to be effective for N2 reduction, such as Fe-, Mo-, Rh-, and Ru-based surfaces, supported nanoparticles, and single atoms on a suitable substrate.27–46 Compared with metal-based electrocatalysts, metal-free materials are emerging as highly promising alternatives for N2 electrochemical reduction, due to their abundant natural resources, controllable composition, resistance to acids and bases, high-temperature stability, and environmental friendliness.47–55
In spite of the above advantages, we note that there are only a few reports on the applications of metal-free electrocatalysts for the NRR,56–61 among which boron doping has been very recently shown to be useful to enhance the catalytic activities of carbon-based catalysts towards the NRR,58–61 as the electron-deficient B dopants in carbon materials facilitate acceptance of the lone-pair electrons of N2 molecules, activating the inert NN bond of N2 molecules and further promoting its cleavage in the subsequent reduction process. For example, Qiu et al. fabricated a B4C nanosheet in experiment, which can be utilized as a superior metal-free electrocatalyst for the NRR with excellent selectivity at room temperature and ambient pressure.58 Yu et al. showed by combining experimental observations and theoretical simulations that B-doped graphene with a BC3 structure exhibits superior catalytic performance for the NRR with a NH3 production rate of 9.8 μg h−1 cm−2 and high faradaic efficiency of 10.8% at −0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under ambient conditions.59 Ling et al. theoretically proposed that B-decorated g-C3N4 can be used as metal-free single atom photocatalyst for N2 reduction with a record low onset potential (−0.20 V).61 The above pioneering studies encourage us to further search for other B-doped carbon materials with high-efficiency for the NRR.
In 2015, a novel layered material with evenly distributed holes, named a C2N holey 2D layer, was successfully synthesized through a simple wet chemical reaction.62 Remarkably, the C2N layer consists of a continuous network of benzene rings bridged by pyrazine rings so as to exhibit high electric conductivity.62 The well-ordered holes of the C2N layer make it a promising support to anchor one or two transition metals due to the rich electron lone pairs on the N atoms at the vacancy hole edge, which can be utilized as the electrocatalysts for the reduction reactions of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and so on.63–68
The great potential of electron-deficient B dopants for N2 fixation and the excellent properties of the C2N layer inspire us to ask an interesting question: can the B-doped C2N layer be used as a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for the NRR? To address this question, in this work, we explored the potential of B-doped C2N layers as the NRR electrocatalyst by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results demonstrated that the interstitial doped C2N layer with B atoms exhibits extremely high NRR catalytic activity with a rather low limiting potential (−0.15 V) via an enzymatic mechanism. Thus, by carefully controlling B doping sites, the C2N layer can be employed as a novel metal-free NRR electrocatalyst with high-efficiency.
2. Methods and models
All spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to obtain the geometric optimizations, single-point energies, and electronic properties of the B-doped C2N layer using the DMol3 code.69,70 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the electron interactions.71 The van der Waals interactions were determined using the empirical correction in Grimme's scheme (i.e., DFT+D2),72 and the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set was used for all elements. Self-consistent field (SCF) computations were performed with a convergence criterion of 10−6 a.u. on the total energy and electronic computations. To ensure high quality results, the real-space global orbital cutoff radius was chosen as high as 5.2 Å in all the computations.
Supercells consisting of 2 × 2 × 1 C2N layer unit cells were employed and the Brillouin zones were sampled with a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grid. The vacuum space was set to 15 Å to avoid the interactions between two periodic images. The first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Nosé–Hoover heat bath scheme were employed to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the B-doped C2N layer. The Hirshfeld charge analysis was employed to compute the charge transfer and magnetic moment.73
The electrochemical reactions were simulated according to the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) technique,74–76 which has been widely employed to determine the free energy profiles and the lowest energy pathways. According to the CHE model, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for each elementary step was defined as: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGpH + ΔGU, where ΔE is the reaction energy that can be directly obtained by analyzing the DFT total energies. ΔEZPE and ΔS are the zero point energy difference and the entropy difference between the products and the reactants at room temperature (T = 298.15 K), respectively. Furthermore, the ΔEZPE values of various intermediates in each elementary step of the NRR were computed from the vibrational frequencies, where only the vibrational modes of the adsorbed intermediates were explicitly computed, while the catalyst surface was fixed. The entropies of the free molecules were taken from the NIST database, while the entropy contribution from the adsorbed state was neglected. ΔGpH is the free energy correction of pH, which can be calculated as ΔGpH = kBT × pH × ln10, and the pH value was set to be zero in this work. ΔGU was the contribution of the applied electrode potential (U) to ΔG. To simulate real water solvent environments, a conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was used, in which the dielectric constant was set as 78.54 for the H2O solvent.77
3. Results and discussion
3.1. N2 adsorption on B-doped C2N layers
Firstly, we construct three kinds of B-doped C2N layer as shown in Fig. 1, including (1) one of C or (2) the N atom of the C2N layer is substituted by a B atom (labeled as BC and BN, respectively), and (3) the B atom is interstitially doped into the C2N layer, as denoted as Bint. After structural optimization, the structures of the C2N layers can be maintained well, in which all atoms are in the exactly same plane. The lengths of the formed B–N and B–C bonds in these B-doped C2N layers are 1.39, 1.43, and 1.50 Å, respectively.
 Fig. 1  The optimized structures of B-doped C2N layers with (a) BC, (b) Bint, and (c) BN configurations as well as the shortest distance between the B dopant and C2N layer. 
According to previous theoretical studies,38,78–82 the NRR process is generally initiated by N2 chemisorption on the catalyst surface. Thus, we next explore the interaction strength of N2 molecules with these B-doped C2N layers, in which both end-on and side-on configurations are considered, and the obtained stable structures are listed in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  The optimized structures of N2 molecules adsorbed on (a) BC, (b) BN, (c) Bint in an end-on manner, and (d) Bint in a side-on manner. 
Our computations reveal that the obtained N2 adsorption configurations are dependent on the B dopant sites in the C2N layer. On BC, the N2 molecule is only weakly adsorbed due to the small adsorption energy (−0.11 eV) and large distance between them (3.26 Å, Fig. 2a). In contrast, the end-on adsorption is stable for N2 on BN with an adsorption energy of −0.84 eV, accompanying the formation of the B–N bond with a length of 1.51 Å (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, both end-on and side-on adsorption configurations can be obtained for N2 on Bint (Fig. 2c and d), and the corresponding adsorption energies are computed to be −1.64 and −0.77 eV, respectively. The lengths of the formed B–N bonds are 1.44 and 1.55 Å, respectively, which are smaller than that of BH3NH3 (1.64 Å), suggesting the strong binding strength of N2 with BN or Bint. The strong adsorption of N2 molecules on BN and Bint elongates the N–N bond length from 1.11 Å in free N2 to about 1.18 Å, thus leading to the activation of the adsorbed N2 molecule. Regarding N2 adsorption on BC, the N–N bond length is nearly unchanged, in good agreement with the small adsorption energy (−0.11 eV), indicating the inefficiency in activating the N2 molecule. Thus, BN and Bint are identified to hold great potential for N2 fixation.
3.2. N2 reduction on B-doped C2N layers
Next, we evaluate the catalytic performance of the screened BN and Bint for the conversion of the captured N2 to NH3 by carefully exploring the full electroreduction paths to obtain the potential-determining step (PDS) and limiting potential. According to a summary of numerous previous theoretical studies,38,78–82 the NRR on the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst proceeds via three typical reaction mechanisms, i.e. enzymatic, alternating, and distal mechanisms (Fig. 3), in which various reaction intermediates, such as N2H*, N2H2*, N2H3*, N2H4*, N*, NH*, and NH2* species, are involved. In detail, the side-on adsorbed N2 can be reduced to NH3via the enzymatic mechanism, in which the two N atoms are alternately hydrogenated on the catalyst surface by the proton–electron pairs (H+ + e−), and the release of the first NH3 molecule is followed by the generation of the second one. For the end-on adsorbed N2 molecule, it will be reduced to NH3 through the distal or alternating pathways. In the distal pathway, the electron pairs continuously attack the N atom furthest away from the catalyst surface to release a NH3 molecule and then attack the second N atom to produce the another NH3 molecule. In the alternating pathway, however, the hydrogenation steps alternately proceed between two N atoms on the catalyst surface.
 Fig. 3  The involved mechanisms of the NRR on a catalyst surface, including distal, alternating, and enzymatic mechanisms. 
To evaluate the catalytic activity of B-doped C2N layers for the NRR, we take Bint as a representative to explore all possible elementary steps in the three mechanisms, as both end-on and side-on adsorption configurations are stable for N2 molecules on Bint. The computed free energy diagrams for the NRR on Bint along the three pathways are shown in Fig. 4, while the corresponding structures of the involved reaction intermediates are presented in Fig. S1.†
 Fig. 4  The free energy profiles of the NRR on a Bint-doped C2N layer along the (a) distal, (b) alternating, and (c) enzymatic pathways. 
Along the alternating and distal pathways that are initiated by end-on adsorption of N2 on Bint, the first two steps are same, i.e. N2 adsorption with a rather negative ΔG value (−0.99 eV), suggesting high binding strength between N2 and Bint. However, the hydrogenation of N2* to N2H* requires a high energy input due to its large ΔG value (0.80 eV, Fig. 4a), which is the PDS for the alternating mechanism, and the corresponding limiting potential is −0.80 V. Regarding the distal mechanism, the release of the first NH3 molecule exhibits an even higher free energy (0.93 eV, Fig. 4b) than the hydrogenation of N2* to N2H* (0.80 eV), resulting in a larger limiting potential (−0.93 V) than the distal mechanism (−0.80 V). Due to the high limiting potentials, the efficiency of the NRR on the Bint surface via the distal or alternating mechanism is very low.
Providing that the NRR proceeds along the enzymatic pathway, all elementary steps are exothermic except the hydrogenation of N2H* to N2H2* (Fig. 4c). Importantly, this reaction is slightly uphill in the free energy profiles by 0.15 eV, which is identified as the potential-determining step of the NRR on Bintvia the enzymatic mechanism. Thus, the corresponding limiting potential is as low as −0.15 V, which is much smaller than those in the distal (−0.93 V) or alternating pathway (−0.80 V). Although the N2 molecule is preferable to be adsorbed on Bintvia an end-on configuration than a side-on one, we note that the energy of the formed N2H species in the enzymatic pathway is lower by about 0.45 eV than that of the distal or alternating pathway. This gives us a hint: the catalytic activity of the NRR electrocatalyst cannot be only evaluated by the N2 adsorption strength; instead, the NNH* formation should be mainly examined. In particular, the limiting potential of the NRR (−0.15 V) on our proposed catalyst is even slightly lower than that of the reported B/g-C3N4 (−0.20 V),61 suggesting the extremely high efficiency of Bint for the NRR. Fig. S2† lists the process of the cleavage of N–N bonds in each pathway along the enzymatic mechanism. A rather good linear relationship of the N–N bond length before emitting the first NH3 is obtained, reflecting a gradual hydrogenation process for N2 fixation and conversion to NH3. The monotonically increasing relationship between the N–N bond length and hydrogenation pathways further testifies the great potential of Bint to N2 fixation.
Although the B-interstitial doped C2N layer exhibits quite high NRR catalytic activity, several questions should be addressed as follows: (1) after binding N2 onto the Bint configuration, there are four high active N atoms around the active site (Fig. 2), which are possible adsorption sites for H atoms during the subsequent NRR. Our results indicated that the barrier of H-transfer from the N atom of Bint to the adsorbed N2 molecule is about 0.51 eV, and the exothermicity is about 0.45 eV (Fig. S3†). Thus, the H atom is more favorable for attachment to the adsorbed N2 molecule; (2) the N2H4 is a possible by-product in the NRR. On the proposed Bint surface, however, the free energy of the release of the formed N2H4 species is 3.94 eV, which is much larger than its further hydrogenation to (NH2* + NH3, ΔG = −1.68 eV), thus ruling out the N2H4 formation; (3) the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the major competing reaction in the NRR. Thus, we compared the adsorption strength of HER species (H atom) and NRR species (N2H) on the Bint surface. Our results showed that the computed adsorption energy of N2H species on Bint is about −3.44 eV, which is much larger than that of H species (−2.40 eV), suggesting the significant suppressing effect for the HER; (4) the direct desorption of the formed NH3* from the electrocatalyst surface is difficult due to its large adsorption strength on Bint (ΔG = 3.72 eV). However, two reasons make NH3 desorption an unproblematic obstacle: (i) the formed NH3 can be further protonated to NH4+ under strongly acidic conditions (pH = 1), which has been observed in previous studies on the electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide (NO) on Pt surfaces;83–86 (ii) the released energy (5.05 eV) at the corresponding hydrogenation step is large enough to release the formed NH3 exothermically (3.72 eV) as shown in Fig. 4.
Finally, we also explored the catalytic performance of BN for the NRR via distal and alternating mechanisms, as only N2 end-on adsorption is stable. According to the free energy profiles (Fig. S4†), the limiting potentials are computed to be −1.65 V in the distal pathway and −0.75 V in the alternating pathway, which are much larger than that on Bint along the enzymatic pathway (−0.15 V), indicating a poor catalytic performance of BN, as compared with Bint.
3.3. The origin of the good catalytic activity of the B-doped C2N layer
To gain deep insight into the good catalytic activity of Bint for the NRR, we explored its electronic structures. Our results revealed that the Bint-doped C2N layer has a spin-polarized ground state with a magnetic moment of 1.00 μB which mainly localizes on the B atom (0.83 μB). According to previous theoretical studies on the NRR,38,45,81 the significant magnetic moment plays an important role in N2 activation. For example, about 0.10 μB magnetic moments are transferred from the Bint surface to the adsorbed N2 molecule, suggesting strong adsorption strength. Meanwhile, the B dopant carries +0.13 |e|, which can prohibit the binding of Lewis acid H+ at these sites under acidic conditions due to electrostatic repulsion between them, which gives rise to high selectivity for the NRR.
In addition, the B doping gives rise to the decrease of the band gap of the C2N layer due to the introduction of impurity levels. Our results demonstrated that the Bint-doped C2N layer has a much smaller band gap of about 0.69 eV (Fig. S5†) than the pristine one (1.77 eV), greatly enhancing the electrical conductivity and promoting the electron transport in the electrochemical reduction reactions. Moreover, the partial densities of states (PDOSs, Fig. 5a) show that the electronic coupling mainly comes from the hybridization of B-2p orbitals and N-2p orbitals of the N2 molecule. Importantly, significant charge transfer is observed between the B dopant and the adsorbed N2 molecule on Bint surfaces. Similar to N2 adsorption on B/g-C3N4, a two-way charge transfer or “acceptance-donation” process can also be observed here (Fig. 5b), i.e., the N2 molecule will donate its lone-pair electrons in the σg2p orbital. Meanwhile, the anti-bonding bond of N2 molecule can accept electrons of B dopant on BN and Bint, which help trigger the following reduction reaction.

3.4. The feasibility of experimental synthesis of B-doped C2N layers
According to the above discussions, we have identified that B-doped C2N layers could be utilized as the metal-free NRR catalysts by tuning the B doping site. As far as we know, however, there is no experimental report on the synthesis of B-doped C2N layers so far. Very recently, Shinde et al. successfully synthesized hierarchical sulfur-doped holey C2N aerogels via a facile scalable amination and polymerization strategy,87 which exhibits high energy densities and outstanding stability. This study inspires us to compare the stability between the experimentally available S-doped C2N layer and the as-designed Bint with the best NRR catalytic activity by computing their corresponding cohesive energies and formation energies.88
Our results show that the cohesive energy and formation energy of Bint are −6.70 and 0.97 eV, which are comparable to those of the synthesized Sint (−6.75 and 0.85 eV), indicating the good stability and high feasibility for experimental synthesis of this B-doped C2N layer. In addition, the MD simulations at 500 K are also performed to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of Bint, in which the time step was set at 1.0 fs for a total period of 10 ps. We find that no significant geometrical distortion was observed for this B-doped C2N layer (Fig. 6), suggesting its high thermodynamic stability. Thus, we predicted that the as-designed Bint-doped C2N layer can be easily fabricated experimentally.

4. Conclusions
In summary, by means of DFT computations, we have explored the potential of several B-doped C2N layers as a metal-free catalyst for N2 fixation and reduction for NH3 synthesis. Our results demonstrated that the Bint-doped C2N layer can effectively capture and activate N2 molecules via an “acceptance-donation” process. In particular, due to the significant positive charge and magnetic moment, this B-doped C2N layer exhibits an extremely high catalytic activity and selectivity for the NRR with a limiting potential of −0.15 V through the enzymatic mechanism. In addition, the Bint-doped C2N layer has similar cohesive energy and formation energy to the experimentally available S-doped one, as well as high thermodynamic stability, making it show great promise for synthesis. Therefore, we strongly believe that B-doped C2N layers can be employed as a metal-free electrocatalyst for N2 reduction to NH3. We also hope that our findings would encourage more experimental and theoretical studies to further search for more metal-free electrocatalysts with high-efficiency for sustainable NH3 synthesis.

The cohesive energy per atom (Ecoh) is defined as: Ecoh = [Edoped − nEC − mEN − qEdopant]/(n + m + q), where Edoped, EC, EN, and Edopant denote the total energies of the doped C2N layer, isolated carbon, isolated nitrogen, and isolated dopant (i.e., B or S), respectively, while n, m, and q represent the number of C, N, and dopant atoms. The formation energy (Ef) is defined as: Ef = Edoped − Epristine + nμC + mμN − μdopant, where Edoped and Epristine are the total energies of doped and pristine C2N layer, respectively. μC, μN, and μdopant are the chemical potentials of C, N, and dopant (B or S), respectively, in which μC, μN, μB, and μS are obtained from graphite, free N2 molecules, β-boron, and S8 clusters, respectively.
