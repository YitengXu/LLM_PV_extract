Introduction
Hematite has emerged as a good photocatalyst for efficient solar water splitting due to its favorable optical band gap (2.1–2.2 eV), extraordinary chemical stability in an oxidative environment, abundance, and low cost.1–9 According to theoretical prediction, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of hematite can be 16.8% and the water splitting photocurrent can be 12.6 mA cm−2.4 However, the practical performance of hematite for solar water splitting is far away from the ideal case which has been limited by several factors, such as poor conductivity, short lifetime of the excited-state carrier (10−12 s), poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), and improper band position for unassisted water splitting.5–9
Enormous efforts have been focused on improving the performance of the hematite photoelectrode.3–16 Elemental doping in hematite has been considered to be a promising way.5,15,16 Extrinsic doping with Ti, Sn, Nb, and Si in hematite has been tried to better the performance.5,6,12,14–16 For example, Ti-doping in hematite nanostructures achieved a low onset potential and an enhanced photocurrent density of 1.83 mA cm−2 at a relatively low bias of 1.02 V vs. RHE.15 In addition to extrinsic doping with various elements, intrinsic doping such as oxygen vacancies has also been reported to be an effective way to improve the photocurrent of hematite.7,10,11 Y. Ling et al. recently reported highly photoactive hematite nanowire arrays containing oxygen vacancies which showed a photocurrent of 1.82 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a maximum photocurrent of 3.37 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE.10 Recently we also developed a simple method to synthesize carbon-coated hematite nanostructures with oxygen vacancies for solar water oxidation which showed a photocurrent density of 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.7 Although many successful extrinsic and intrinsic doping methods were applied in hematite separately, whether or not the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic doping can improve synergistically the performance of hematite is still questionable.11 In addition, integrating the independently developed methods to acquire the higher efficiency of solar water oxidation by the cumulative effect is crucial to achieve a practical application of hematite.
Here we show that by controlling the oxygen pressure in the sintering process, the contents of oxygen vacancies in hematite can be effectively controlled to achieve an optimized performance. Moreover, by coupling Ti-doping and oxygen vacancies in hematite we obtained an efficient photoelectrode with a photocurrent density of 2.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE by the cumulative effect. Also a remarkable maximum photocurrent of 4.56 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE was achieved at a relatively low activation temperature of 550 °C, which was a significant improvement compared to the literature to date.6,9,10,15 The correlated behavior of oxygen vacancies and Ti dopants also effectively expanded the partial oxygen pressure range suitable to produce oxygen vacancies in Ti-doped hematite compared to that in undoped hematite, which was critical to the photoelectrode production in practical applications. Data suggest that the facile way by coupling independently developed methods such as oxygen vacancies and Ti-doping stands for an effective strategy for efficient solar water oxidation.
Experimental section
Preparation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes
Undoped hematite nanostructures were prepared on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, 14 ohm sq−1) glass by a hydrothermal method.6 A teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was filled with 15 ml aqueous solution containing 0.15 M of ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) and 15 μl HCl (45.3–45.8 wt%). The FTO glass was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water. The cleaned FTO glass slide (10 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm) was put into the autoclave and heated at 95 °C for 4 h. A uniform layer of yellow color film (FeOOH) was formed on the FTO substrate. Then, the FeOOH-coated substrate was washed with deionized water and subsequently sintered in a tube furnace with a controlled oxygen-deficient atmosphere (Ar + air) at 550 °C for 2 h. The oxygen-deficient atmosphere was achieved by applying vacuum to the system down to a pressure of 3.0 × 10−2 Torr, and then refilling with untra-high purity Ar and air. The flow-in rates of Ar and air were controlled by a mass flow controller (MFC) and the total pressure in the tube furnace was kept to be 1 Torr. The partial oxygen pressure (pO2) was estimated by the equation: pO2 = 21% × (air flux)/(air flux + Ar flux) × total pressure (1 Torr). A control sample sintered in ambient air (150 Torr) was also prepared.
Ti-doped hematite nanostructures were prepared by the same procedure except for adding 0.5 ml titanium carbonitride (TiCN, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) aqueous solution (10 mg ml−1) as the titanium precursor. The synthesized sample was washed with deionized water to remove the black powder (TiCN) before sintering in a controlled oxygen-deficient atmosphere (Ar + air) at 550 °C for 2 h.
Structural characterization
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of hematite nanostructures and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectroscopy were taken on a FEI-quanta 200 scanning electron microscope with acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a FEI/Philips Techai 12 BioTWIN transmission electron microscope and a CM200 FEG transmission electron microscope, respectively. An X-Ray Diffractor (XRD, PANalytical, Zmpyrean) and X-ray photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS, Kratos AXIS UltraDLD) were also used for structure characterization. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) data were collected on beamline 14 W at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments at the O K-edge were performed at the Soft X-ray Spectroscopy station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The spectra were recorded at room temperature with a resolution of 0.3 eV at the O K-edge with the total electron yield (TEY) detection mode.
PEC measurements
Hematite photoanodes on FTO substrate were covered by non-conductive hysol epoxy except for a working area of 0.1 cm2. All PEC measurements were carried out using CHI 660D electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference. The Electrolyte was an aqueous solution of NaOH with a pH of 13.6, bubbled with N2 for 20 min before measurement. The measured voltage was converted into the potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In a typical experiment, the potential was swept from 0.7 V to 1.8 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Xenon High Brightness Cold Light Sources (XD-300) coupled with a filter (AM 1.5G) were used as the white light source and the light power density of 100 mW cm−2 (spectrally corrected) was measured with a power meter (Newport, 842-PE). IPCE were measured using a Xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300/CEL-HXBF300, 300 W) coupled with a monochromator (Omni-λ3005). Capacitance was derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential with 10000 Hz frequency in the dark. Mott–Schottky plots were generated from the capacitance values.
Results and discussion
SEM images of Ti-doped hematite nanostructures sintered in a controlled oxygen-deficient atmosphere with a partial oxygen pressure of 2.4 × 10−2 Torr at 550 °C are shown in Fig. 1a (low resolution) and b (high resolution). Ti-doped hematite shows a thin film with vertical nanorods on the FTO substrate and some coral-like nanostructures consisting of nanorods covered on the vertical nanorod film. SEM images of undoped hematite nanostructures (sintered in a partial oxygen pressure of 2.1 × 10−2 Torr) at 550 °C are also shown in the ESI, Fig. S1.† Undoped hematite nanostructures show a uniform morphology like vertical nanorods covering on the FTO substrate similar to the background film of Ti-doped hematite. The coral-like nanostructures in Ti-doped hematite have a larger surface area, which may increase the effective interface of hematite and be water favorable for the performance of water oxidation.8 Elemental analysis by SEM reveals that the coral-like nanostructures show a Ti content of 1.8 wt% confirming Ti doping (ESI, Fig. S2†), while the region for the background nanorod film in the same sample shows a much lower Ti content (about 0.8 wt%). The dark field image of the TEM image and the corresponding elemental mappings for Ti-doped hematite nanostructures are also shown in Fig. 1c, which clearly indicate the uniform Ti-doping in the hematite. XRD data for undoped and Ti-doped samples are also shown in the ESI, Fig. S3 and S4,† which can be indexed to the characteristic peaks of typical hematite structure (JCPDS 33-0664) after subtracting the SnO2 peaks from the FTO substrate.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed in 1 M NaOH electrolyte using a three-electrode electrochemical cell with hematite nanostructures on FTO as the working electrode, a platinum coil as the counter electrode, and a reference of Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent density-applied potential (J–V) scans for hematite nanostructures were measured with the AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. In Fig. 2 we show a comparison of the J–V scans for Ti-doped hematite with oxygen vacancies (green) with undoped hematite with oxygen vacancies (black) and Ti-doped hematite without oxygen vacancies (red). Obviously, Ti-doped hematite without oxygen vacancies shows a very low performance at a sintering temperature of 550 °C (sintering at a higher temperature such as 750 °C may significantly improve the performance, but it is still lower than that for Ti-doped hematite with oxygen vacancies).8 The performance of undoped hematite with optimized oxygen vacancies is high showing a pronounced photocurrent of 1.75 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a maximum value of 3.93 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE, which is in good agreement with the literature.10 However, by coupling Ti-doping and oxygen vacancies in the same sample, we may achieve a better performance compared to those with only oxygen vacancies or Ti-doping, showing an enhanced photocurrent of 2.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a remarkable maximum value of 4.56 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE (at 1.5 V vs. RHE the current is 4.16 mA cm−2). The maximum photocurrent density of 4.56 mA cm−2 is a significant improvement compared to the literature to date.6,9,15

Black curves: undoped hematite nanostructures with oxygen vacancies (sintered in a partial oxygen pressure of 2.1 × 10−2 Torr with the best performance for undoped samples); red curves: Ti-doped hematite nanostructures without oxygen vacancies (sintered in ambient air); green curves: Ti-doped hematite nanostructures with oxygen vacancies (sintered in a partial oxygen pressure of 2.4 × 10−2 Torr with the best performance for Ti-doped samples). 
The effect of oxygen vacancy content on the performance has been investigated via sintering the hematite nanostructures in various partial oxygen pressures. J–V scans for Ti-doped hematite nanostructures sintered in the partial oxygen pressures from 1.1 × 10−2 Torr to 150 Torr at 550 °C are shown in Fig. 3a. Also J–V scans for undoped hematite nanostructures sintered in various partial oxygen pressures at 550 °C are shown in the ESI, Fig. S5.† For Ti-doped hematite samples with oxygen vacancies in Fig. 3a, the best performance shows at a partial oxygen pressure of 2.4 × 10−2 Torr (the oxygen content is about 2.4%). For undoped hematite samples, the best performance shows at a partial oxygen pressure of 2.1 × 10−2 Torr (the oxygen content is about 2.1%). In Fig. 3b and c, we show the photocurrents of undoped hematite samples (green curves) and Ti-doped hematite samples (blue curves) at 1.23 and 1.6 V vs. RHE as a function of partial oxygen pressure, respectively. Interestingly, for undoped hematite samples the maximum photocurrents at both 1.23 and 1.6 V vs. RHE decrease very quickly with the change of partial oxygen pressures. When the partial oxygen pressure increases or decreases about 0.6 × 10−2 Torr from the best pressure (the corresponding oxygen content range is from 1.5% to 2.7%), the photocurrent density decreases more than 50%. Thus it is not very easy for practical applications considering the narrow pressure range for good performance. However, with Ti-doping, the applicable partial oxygen pressure for oxygen vacancies with high performance can be expanded to a wide region compared to that for undoped hematite. It is obvious that for Ti-doped hematite samples the photocurrents decrease slowly and the applicable oxygen range expands a lot at both 1.23 and 1.6 V vs. RHE. Especially for the case of 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent keeps a very high level in a pressure range from 2 × 10−2 Torr to 9 × 10−2 Torr (the corresponding oxygen content range is from 2.0% to 9.0%) and the lowest photocurrent decreases less than 30% from the top value. It will be very helpful in preventing the efficiency fluctuation from the quality control in practical application.

(d) IPCE spectra for Ti-doped hematite sintered in a partial oxygen pressure of 2.4 × 10−2 Torr at 1.23 and 1.6 V vs. RHE. 
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) data of Ti-doped hematite sintered in a partial oxygen pressure of 2.4 × 10−2 Torr are measured at 1.23 (green) and 1.6 (red) V vs. RHE as a function of incident light wavelength. The data in Fig. 3d show the highest efficiency of about 45% at 1.23 V and about 75% at 1.6 V at a wavelength of 350 nm. Based on the IPCE data, the integrated photocurrents (the integrated curves can be found in the ESI, Fig. S6†) are also calculated, which reach 2.04 mA cm−2 and 4.41 mA cm−2 at 1.23 and 1.6 V vs. RHE, respectively. The integrated photocurrents are in accord with the PEC measurement. In the ESI, Fig. S5† the IPCE data of undoped hematite sintered in a partial oxygen pressure of 2.1 × 10−2 Torr are measured at 1.23 (green) and 1.6 (red) V vs. RHE as a function of incident light wavelength. The data show the highest efficiency of about 30% at 1.23 V and about 60% at 1.6 V at a wavelength of 350 nm. Based on the IPCE data, the integrated photocurrents are also calculated which are 1.51 mA cm−2 and 3.79 mA cm−2 at 1.23 and 1.6 V vs. RHE, respectively.
To optimize the experimental conditions, sintering temperatures from 450 to 750 °C were tested and a favorable temperature of 550 °C with best performance has been achieved.
Ti concentration in hematite was also optimized by controlling the quantity of TiCN (titanium precursor) in the solution. The performance stability tests of Ti-doped samples were carried out and the curves of photocurrent vs. time at 1.23 V and 1.6 V vs. RHE for the Ti-doped sample (2.4 × 10−2 Torr) are shown in the ESI, Fig. S7.† The stable photocurrents in a long run suggest that it is a true effect of water oxidation ruling out the sacrifice of the hematite nanostructures themselves.
Mott–Schottky curves of Ti-doped hematite samples sintered in various partial oxygen pressures at 550 °C are plotted in Fig. 4. Curvature in Mott–Schottky curves can be observed, which might be related to the morphology with coral-like nanostructures.13 The slopes from the Mott–Schottky plots are used to estimate the carrier densities using the following equation:Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1where e0 is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19C), ε is the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (80),16ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−14 Fm−1), Nd is the donor density and V is the potential applied at the electrode. Capacitances were derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential with 10000 Hz frequency in the dark. The Mott–Schottky slopes of Ti-doped hematite samples are positive which indicates that they are n-type semiconductors with electrons as majority carriers. The carrier densities are estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots.16 The results show that the highest donor density of the Ti-doped hematite sample is 3.26 × 1020 cm−3 at 2.4 × 10−2 Torr, while the donor densities of the samples sintered at other partial oxygen pressures are 4.33 × 1019 cm−3 at 1.5 × 10−2 Torr, 3.46 × 1018 cm−3 at 9.0 × 10−2 Torr and 2.57 × 1017 cm−3 at 150 Torr, which are about one to several orders lower than that of the Ti-doped sample sintered at 2.4 × 10−2 Torr. Thus the increased photocurrent for Ti-doped samples sintered in oxygen-deficient atmosphere may be attributed to increased donor density with oxygen vacancies.10,13 The pressure of 2.4 × 10−2 Torr stands for an optimized level of oxygen vacancies in hematite, resulting in the best PEC performance. In ESI, Fig. S8† we also show the Mott–Schottky curves of undoped hematite samples sintered in various partial oxygen pressures and the results also propose that the increased photocurrent is attributed to increased donor density with oxygen vacancies.10 The highest donor density of Ti-doped hematite (3.26 × 1020 cm−3 at 2.4 × 10−2 Torr) is similar to that of undoped hematite (3.73 × 1020 cm−3 at 2.1 × 10−2 Torr). The results suggest that Ti-doping does not significantly change the donor density of hematite as an electrical dopant. The result is similar to a recent report for Ti-doped hematite.14 Here, the improved PEC performance by Ti-doping could be related to other factors such as the surface catalytic effects or more active sites for water oxidation.14,17

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to elucidate the electronic structure of Ti-doped hematite nanostructures. For the Ti-doped sample (2.4 × 10−2 Torr), a Ti 2p signal can be clearly observed in the survey scan of XPS shown in Fig. 5a, indicating the presence of Ti, while no Ti signal is found for the undoped sample. Fe and O signals are strong for both undoped and Ti-doped hematite samples. Additional C and Sn signals can also be observed for both samples. The C signal can be attributed to the adsorbed carbon contamination in the sample preparation process, while the Sn signal stands for Sn-doping originated from the Sn diffusion from the FTO substrate.6,15 Sn-doping in hematite may help the performance.6 The Ti 2p detailed spectrum of the Ti-doped sample is shown in Fig. 5b, with a comparison to those of TiO2 and TiCN. The Ti 2p3/2 binding energy of 458.3 eV indicates that the Ti atoms in Ti-doped sample are not in a metallic state (for typical Ti metal the peak position is 454.2 eV) or a state for TiCN (455.2 eV), while similar to an oxidized state like TiO2 (459.0 eV).15,18 However, a binding energy difference (about 0.7 eV) between the Ti-doped sample and TiO2 can be observed, suggesting a different atomic environment from that in TiO2 where Ti atoms should locate in the crystal structure of hematite. The Fe 2p XPS spectra of Ti-doped hematite nanostructures were also measured and a small peak for Fe2+ at about 716 eV was observed for the samples with oxygen vacancies (data not shown).

To further investigate the electronic structure of oxygen vacancies in the Ti-doped hematite nanostructures, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were performed. XAS is an element-specific spectroscopic technique involving the excitation of electrons from a core level to the empty states, and is particularly powerful to obtain structural information of different species. In the near edge region (from just below the edge to ∼50 eV above the threshold) it is often referred to as X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) which probes densities of states and local symmetry, to be distinguished from Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) in the extended region (50 eV up to as much as 1000 eV above the threshold) which contains information about the inter-atomic distance and the local dynamics of the system. X-ray absorption spectra of Ti-doped hematite at the O K-edge were measured on the soft X-ray beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility and are shown in Fig. 6a. XANES and EXAFS data at Fe K-edge of Ti-doped hematite nanostructures sintered in various partial oxygen pressures have been collected on beamline 14 W at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The Fourier transform of the EXAFS data in R space is shown in Fig. 6b.

In Fig. 6a the XAS spectrum of Ti-doped hematite sintered at 150 Torr shows typical hematite features such as two separated prepeaks A1 and A2 and the main peak B. The prepeak can be attributed to transitions to anti-bonding O 2p states hybridized with the 3d metal states (t2g and eg orbital symmetry), mainly localized at the Fe site.19,20 Feature B can be generally attributed to oxygen 2p states hybridized with iron 4s and 4p states.19 Compared to the spectrum of Ti-doped hematite without oxygen vacancies, the O K-edge spectra of Ti-doped hematite with various oxygen vacancies show significant differences such as the convolution of the prepeaks (A1 and A2) and the increase of the shoulder A3. The spectrum of Ti-doped hematite at 1.1 × 10−2 Torr shows evidence for large amounts of Fe2+ in the sample since the prepeaks A1 and A2 convolute to be only one strong peak, similar to the spectrum for Fe3O4.19 The spectrum of Ti-doped hematite at 2.4 × 10−2 Torr (the best PEC performance) shows an obvious convolution of the prepeaks, indicating the existence of Fe2+ in the sample. Peak A3 could be assigned to a Ti-doped state according to the literature.21 The spectral differences among hematite samples with various oxygen vacancies can be assigned to the different contents of Fe2+ in the sample, which is consistent with the Fe 2p XPS result.19
Fourier transform of the EXAFS data in R space in Fig. 6b also shows an obvious difference among three samples with various oxygen vacancies. In Fig. 6b the peak around 1.5 Å can be attributed to Fe–O bonds with the peak around 3 Å attributed to Fe–Fe bonds.22,23 An obvious shift of the Fe–O bonds can be observed (shown by the arrow and vertical lines), indicating an increased bond length of Fe–O bonds as a result of the increase of oxygen vacancies (from 150 Torr to 1.1 × 10−2 Torr). The increased bond length stands for a lower oxidation state of Fe such as the formation of Fe2+, which is in good agreement with the O K-edge XAS data. Also, a decrease of the intensity of Fe–O bonds for the Ti-doped sample at 2.4 × 10−2 Torr can be found, indicating increased oxygen vacancies (less oxygen). Moreover, a decrease of the intensity of Fe–Fe bonds for the Ti-doped sample at 1.1 × 10−2 Torr can be observed, revealing the decrease of Fe–Fe bonds in the sample with a prominent distortion of the crystal structure. It is a result of the increased oxygen vacancies with less oxygen concentration in the sintering process. The distortion of the crystal structure may hinder the further improvement of the performance of hematite with more oxygen vacancies. Compared to the sample without oxygen vacancies (150 Torr) or with more oxygen vacancies (1.1 × 10−2 Torr), the EXAFS result of the sample with best PEC performance (2.4 × 10−2 Torr) suggests that an optimized oxygen vacancy concentration in hematite should be able to introduce a lower oxidation state of Fe (such as Fe2+) with longer bond length, but no more than the amount resulting in a strong distortion of the crystal structure.
By adding TiCN as the titanium precursor in a hydrothermal synthesis process, we successfully synthesized Ti-doped hematite and by additional annealing in a oxygen-deficient atmosphere, we could control the contents of oxygen vacancies in hematite nanostructures for the combination of Ti-doping and oxygen vacancies. The cumulative effect of Ti-doping and oxygen vacancies in hematite significantly improves the performance for solar water oxidation. The electronic structure of Ti-doped hematite with oxygen vacancies suggests that oxygen vacancies mainly affect the performance of hematite by increasing the donor density with a lower oxidation state of Fe (such as Fe2+) in the hematite crystal structure, which is consistent with the Mott–Schottky data. Although it is well known that Ti-doping in hematite may improve the performance, the exact mechanism in hematite with Ti-doping is still on the way.14 In the literature, the effect of Ti-doping in hematite was argued to various factors such as increased electron concentration, surface catalytic effects or increased active sites.13–15,17 Here our data clearly show the combination of Ti-doping and oxygen vacancies can significantly improve the performance of hematite and the oxygen vacancy effect has been clarified. However, the effect of Ti-doping for the improved PEC performance is still hard to be identified by present data. The Mott–Schottky curves indicate that Ti-doping in our samples does not significantly change the donor density of hematite as an electrical dopant.14 Thus the effect of Ti-doping could be attributed to surface catalytic effects or increased active sites.13–15,17 Future in situ XAS experiments which detect the electronic structure of hematite under practical conditions (in solution and with applied potential) might be useful to reveal the Ti-doping effect.
Conclusions
We presented the preparation of Ti-doped hematite nanostructures with various oxygen vacancies. The Ti-doped hematite nanostructures with optimized oxygen vacancies achieved a photocurrent of 2.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a remarkable maximum value of 4.56 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE for solar water oxidation. Moreover, Ti-doping can expand the applicative partial oxygen pressure to a wide range compared to that for undoped hematite. The expansion of partial oxygen pressure range might be useful for the practical application. Data suggest that oxygen vacancies in hematite mainly affect the performance by improving the donor density with lower oxidation state of Fe (such as Fe2+), while Ti-doping might affect the performance of hematite by surface catalytic effects or more active sites for water oxidation. The coupling of extrinsic Ti-doping and intrinsic oxygen vacancies stands as an effective strategy to design oxide-based photoanodes for efficient solar water oxidation.
