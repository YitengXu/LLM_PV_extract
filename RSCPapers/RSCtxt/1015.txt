    , Accepted 23rd February 2017First published on 23rd February 2017AbstractBi2S3 has attracted extensive attention recently as a light-absorber, sensitizer or electron acceptor material in various solar cells. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the photovoltaic efficiency of Bi2S3 solar cells is limited by its intrinsic point defects, i.e., both S vacancy and S interstitial can have high concentration and produce deep defect levels in the bandgap, leading to non-radiative recombination of electron–hole carriers and reduced minority carrier lifetime. Unexpectedly most of the intrinsic defects in Bi2S3, including even the S interstitial, act as donor defects, explaining the observed n-type conductivity and also causing the high p-type conductivity impossible thermodynamically. Doping in Bi2S3 by a series of extrinsic elements is studied, showing that most of the dopant elements such as Cu, Br and Cl make the material even more n-type and only Pb doping makes it weakly p-type. Based on this, we propose that the surface region of n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals in p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 nano-heterojunction solar cells may be type-inverted into p-type due to Pb doping, with a buried p–n junction formed in the Bi2S3 nanocrystals, which provides a new explanation to the longer carrier lifetime and higher efficiency [Nat. Photonics, 6, 529 (2012)]. Considering the relatively low conduction band and high n-type conductivity, we predict that Cu, Br and Cl doped Bi2S3 may be an ideal n-type electron acceptor or counter electrode material, while the performance of Bi2S3 as a light-absorber or sensitizer material is intrinsically limited.
1. Introduction
The search for novel photovoltaic semiconductor materials has drawn extensive attention in the past decade.1–4 The emergence of the perovskite semiconductor CH3NH3PbI3 represented an important breakthrough, with the CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cell efficiency increasing rapidly to over 22%.5–9 One important reason for the high performance is that CH3NH3PbI3 has a low carrier effective mass and thus superior carrier mobility, which results partially from the large relativistic effects of Pb, increasing the conduction band width through a significant lowering of the conduction band minimum (CBM), and the hybridization of the Pb 6s states with I 5p states in the top valance band, increasing the valence band width.3,10 As the neighbor in the elemental periodic table, the Bi3+ cation has a similar electron configuration to Pb2+ (5d106s26p0) and thus can have similarly large relativistic effects and strong hybridization of 6s states with the anion p states in the valence band,11 and so the Bi related compound semiconductors may also possess superior carrier mobility. Furthermore, Bi is a non-toxic and environment-friendly element. As a result, the search for candidate solar cell materials in Bi based compounds attracts more and more attention.11–13
Bi2S3 has a bandgap around 1.3–1.45 eV,14 close to the optimal bandgap for the light-absorber material in single-junction solar cells,15,16 and very high optical absorption coefficient, >104 cm−1 for λ < 780 nm and >105 cm−1 for λ < 500 nm. Therefore Bi2S3 attracted extensive attention as a photovoltaic material in the past decade,17–26e.g., as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells (replacing the expensive ruthenium dye),22,23 light absorber material,26 counter electrode in CdSe quantum dot-sensitized solar cells,24 active layer in organic/inorganic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells (blending Bi2S3 and polymers),27,28 n-type electron acceptor in p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 nano-heterojunction and polymer/nanocrystal heterojunction solar cells.17,25,29
However, the absolute power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of Bi2S3 based solar cells is still low relative to the commercialized Si, CdTe, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 or perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. The reason depends on the specific roles of Bi2S3 in these solar cells, e.g., a short lifetime and diffusion length of minority carriers is detrimental if it is used as the light-absorber or sensitizer, and low n-type conductivity is detrimental if used as the electron acceptor. Since the intrinsic defects and extrinsic dopants influence both the minority carrier lifetime and electrical conductivity significantly, a systematical study on the possible defects and dopants is critically important for understanding the current low efficiency of Bi2S3 based solar cells.
Motivated by the optimization of the thermoelectric performance, Chmielowski et al. studied four intrinsic defects (S and Bi vacancy, SBi and BiS antisites), finding that the S vacancy and BiS antisite make Bi2S3 weakly n-type. However, other possible defects such as S and Bi interstitials were neglected and their influences are still unknown.30 Doping Bi2S3 using extrinsic elements including Cu, Ag, Sb, Si, Ge and Cl had been tried experimentally,31–35 but their influence on the electrical conductivity is still not clear. Chmielowski et al. studied the Si, Ge, Sn, Hf and Cl doping theoretically, but none of them leads to p-type conductivity.30 Therefore, a clear understanding on how the intrinsic defects and extrinsic dopants influence the carrier lifetime, electrical conductivity and thus the photovoltaic performance of Bi2S3 is still not available, limiting the knowledge-based improvement of Bi2S3 based solar cells.
In this paper, we investigated all the common point defects and a series of dopants in Bi2S3 using first-principles calculations. We found that not only the vacancy and antisite defects, but also the interstitial defects can have high concentration in Bi2S3. Unexpectedly most of these intrinsic defects, including even the S interstitial, act as donors, contributing to the observed n-type conductivity and also causing the high p-type conductivity impossible. These high-concentration defects can produce deep levels in the bandgap and act as electron–hole recombination centers, decreasing the minority carrier lifetime, which should be an important reason for the current low efficiency of Bi2S3 based solar cells. The doping of Bi2S3 by extrinsic elements such as Cu, Br and Cl makes the materials even more n-type and only Pb doping makes it weakly p-type. Based on this, we propose that the surface region of n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals in the p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 nano-heterojunction solar cells may be type-inverted into p-type due to Pb doping, with a buried p–n junction formed in the Bi2S3 nanocrystals, which provides a new explanation to the observed longer carrier lifetime and higher efficiency.29 With a relatively low conduction band and high n-type conductivity, Cu, Br and Cl doped Bi2S3 may be an ideal n-type electron acceptor or counter electrode material, while its performance as the light-absorber or sensitizer material is intrinsically limited.
2. Calculation methods and models
2.1 Defect formation energies and ionization energy levels
The defect formation energy ΔHf(α,q) is a function of the elemental chemical potentials as well as the electron Fermi level,36,37 and can be calculated using the supercell model as defined, ΔHf(α,q) = E(α,q) − E(host) + ∑ni(μi + Ei) + q(EF + EVBM)(1)where E(α,q) is the calculated total energy of the supercell with a defect α in its charge state q, E(host) is the total energy of the host supercell without defects, ni is the number of atoms removed and q is the number of electrons removed from the supercell when the defect α (in the charge state q) is formed in the supercell, Ei is the total energy per atom of the element i in its elemental solid or gas phase, μi is the chemical potential of the element i referenced to the elemental phase with the energy Ei, EVBM is the valence band maximum (VBM) level of the host Bi2S3 and EF is the Fermi level referenced to the VBM level (ranging from 0 to the bandgap).
Under the equilibrium growth conditions, there are a series of thermodynamic limits to the chemical potentials of the component elements. Firstly, the leftover of the elemental phases of Bi, S, and the dopant X (X = Pb, Ag, Cu, F, Cl, Br, I) should be avoided, so μi should satisfy,μBi < 0, μS < 0, μX < 0
Secondly, the Bi2S3 compound should be stable (under equilibrium), which requires, 2μBi + 3μS = ΔHf(Bi2S3)(2)where ΔHf(Bi2S3) is the calculated formation energy of Bi2S3 (−2.01 eV).
Finally, the possible secondary compounds that can be formed by the dopant elements X and the host elements should be avoided, thus, nμX + mμS < ΔHf(XnSm)(3) nμBi + mμX < ΔHf(BinXm)(4)
For example, the formation of PbS (with a calculated formation energy −0.91 eV per f. u.) should be avoided, so the highest possible μPb is −0.24 eV under Bi-rich conditions (μBi = 0, μS = −0.67 eV), and −0.91 eV under S-rich conditions (μBi = −1.00 eV, μS = 0). With these chemical potential requirements satisfied, there will be no leftover of the secondary compounds such as PbS in the Pb-doped Bi2S3 samples.
After the range of the elemental chemical potentials is determined by these requirements, we can now calculate the formation energy ΔHf(α,q) as a function of the electron Fermi level (as shown in Fig. 2, 5 and 6). The transition energy level ε(q/q′) is defined as the Fermi level at which the formation energies of the defect α in the charge states q and q′ are equal, i.e., the Fermi level at the cross points in Fig. 2, 5 and 6. It can be calculated as, ε(q/q′) = [ΔHf(α,q) − ΔHf(α,q′)]/(q′ − q)(5)where q′ and q are different charge states, and ΔHf(α,q) and ΔHf(α,q′) are given by eqn (1) when the Fermi level is 0.38 When the Fermi level is located at the transition energy levels of a defect, the defect can accept (or donate) electrons to get ionized to the negatively (positively) charged state.
The total energy and electronic eigenstates are calculated using the density functional theory39,40 (DFT) methods as implemented in the VASP code,41 with the local density approximation42 (LDA) to the exchange correlation functional. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis is 400 eV. Since Bi is a heavy element, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is considered in our calculations. To calculate the formation energy of a defect, a 60 atom supercell and a Γ point centered 4 × 4 × 4 k-point mesh were used. For a charged defect, a uniform background charge is added to keep the global charge neutrality of the periodic supercell, and the Makov–Payne correction is included to account for the interaction between the image charges. Since LDA tends to underestimate the bandgap (usually underestimates the CBM energy and overestimates the VBM energy), we corrected our calculated formation energies by correcting the band edge energies.43,44 The correction to the band edge energies are determined by comparing the band edge energies from the LDA and hybrid functional (HSE45) calculations. Test calculations showed that the corrected formation energies agree well with the formation energies calculated directly using the hybrid functional.44
2.2 Crystal structure and doping sites
The crystal structure of Bi2S3 is orthorhombic with a space group Pbnm and has 20 atoms in the primitive cell. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal structure of Bi2S3 can be considered as aligned (Bi4S6)n ribbons that are bound to each other by van der Waals forces, i.e., the structure is a quasi-one-dimensional structure. In the (Bi4S6)n ribbons there are strong covalent Bi–S bonds along the [010] direction, whereas only weak van der Waals bonds along the [001] and [100] directions between the ribbons. A series of possible intrinsic defects, including the vacancy, antisite and interstitial defects, are studied. For a certain defect (dopant), we consider all the possible defect (doping) sites, e.g., the Bi vacancy has two different Bi sites, VBi1 and VBi2, both of which are studied, and the results are reported for the site that has the lowest formation energy. For the interstitial defects (dopants), there are many possible interstitial sites in the lattice. We constructed six different interstitial sites, among which the lowest-energy sites for the cation and anion interstitials are shown in Fig. 1.

3. Intrinsic defects
To study the properties of intrinsic defects in Bi2S3, we calculated their formation energies as a function of the Fermi level under (a) Bi-rich and S-poor and (b) Bi-poor and S-rich conditions, as plotted in Fig. 2 where the slope of the line shows the charge state of a defect. According to eqn (1), the positive slope of the line means that the defect is a donor and can donate electrons to get ionized to a positively charged state, while the negative slope means the defect is an acceptor and can accept electrons to get ionized to a negatively charged state. The slope equaling zero means that the defect is neutral (not ionized). The crosspoints of the lines determine the position of the ionization energy levels in the bandgap, which are also plotted in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 2  Calculated formation energies of intrinsic defects as a function of Fermi levels under (a) Bi-rich, S-poor and (b) S-rich, Bi-poor conditions. The Fermi level is referenced to the VBM level, i.e., 0 is at the VBM level, and 1.4 eV (calculated bandgap) is at the CBM level. 
 Fig. 3  Calculated transition (ionization) energy levels of intrinsic point defects in the bandgap of Bi2S3. 
Unexpectedly most of the intrinsic defects act as the donor defects, even the anion interstitial Si, which is usually an acceptor in compound semiconductors,46 acts as a donor. Only VBi and BiS can be acceptors, but their acceptor levels are both very deep (high), close to the conduction band minimum (CBM) level, so they cannot get ionized effectively and generate free hole carriers. The absence of effective acceptor defects indicates that the undoped Bi2S3 cannot show p-type conductivity.
As Fig. 2 shows, whether under the Bi-rich and S-poor or under the Bi-poor and S-rich condition, the donor defects such as VS and Si have much lower formation energies and thus higher concentrations than the acceptor defects, so the undoped Bi2S3 should exhibit intrinsic n-type conductivity. This is consistent with the experimental observation of the n-type conductivity.47–51 Furthermore, since the formation energies of the donor defects decrease to negative as the Fermi level is close to the VBM level (0), they will form spontaneously if the material is doped to p-type and thus pin the Fermi level at the middle of the bandgap, so a high hole concentration (thus high p-type conductivity) is thermodynamically impossible in Bi2S3.
Under the Bi-rich and S-poor condition, the neutral sulfur vacancy (VS) has the lowest formation energy, only 0.89 eV (when the Fermi level is at CBM) as shown in Fig. 2. This is normal since the anion vacancy usually has low energy in the binary compound semiconductors,46,52,53 especially under an S-poor condition. The ionization energy level of VS is relatively deep, with the (0/2+) level 0.46 eV below the CBM as shown in Fig. 3. This deep level can be understood through analyzing the component of the electronic band structure. In Bi2S3, the top part of the valence band is mainly composed of S 3p states and Bi 6s and 6p states (a mixture of the bonding state of the S 3p + Bi 6p hybridization and the antibonding state of the S 3p + Bi 6s hybridization), and the bottom part of the conduction band is composed of the Bi 6p and S 3p states (the antibonding state of the S 3p + Bi 6p hybridization). When an S vacancy VS is formed, the Bi–S bonds are broken, so the anti-bonding states in the conduction band shift down and produce a deep level in the bandgap. This deep level results from the Bi dangling bond, and is thus composed mainly of the Bi 6p states, localized near the broken Bi–S bond. Because the S anion is small while the Bi cation is large, the neighboring Bi cations get closer and have Bi 6p + Bi 6p hybridization after the S is removed, which pushes the bonding state, (0/2+) level, downward.
Among all the defects, the BiS antisite (Bi replacing S) has the second lowest formation energy, always lower than 1.6 eV. It is abnormal that an antisite defect has such a low formation energy, since the cation-substitute-anion or anion-substitute-cation antisites usually have high formation energies in three-dimensional covalent semiconductors such as CdTe and Cu2ZnSnSe4.44,54 This abnormal behavior of BiS results from the quasi-one-dimensional structure of Bi2S3, which has more tolerance to the antisite defects than three-dimensional covalent semiconductors. As shown by the calculated formation energy of BiS in Fig. 2, the neutral (unionized) state of BiS is not stable. When the Fermi level is close to the CBM, it acts as an acceptor defect with the negatively charged state as the most stable state, and when the Fermi level is more than 0.32 eV below the CBM, it acts as a donor defect with the positively charged state as the most stable state. Its (+/−) and (3+/+) ionized energy levels are located 0.32 and 0.87 eV below the CBM, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. When S is replaced by Bi, the Bi–S bonds are also broken, so the Bi 6p states in the conduction band drop down and produce the defect levels in the bandgap. The (+/−) level is relatively shallow (close to the CBM), while the (3+/+) level is very deep, because the Bi–Bi bonds are formed when S is replaced by Bi and the strong Bi 6p + Bi 6p hybridization pushes the bonding state downward dramatically into the bandgap.
Since both VS and BiS produce deep defect levels in the bandgap and have high concentration in the Bi-rich and S-poor Bi2S3 samples, they are effective recombination centers of the photo-generated electron–hole carriers and thus diminish the lifetime of the minority carriers in this n-type semiconductor. Therefore we can predict that the photovoltaic efficiency should be limited if the Bi-rich and S-poor Bi2S3 is used as the light-absorber material.
Under the Bi-poor and S-rich condition, VS and BiS increase their formation energy significantly, while SBi and Si have formation energies decreased to lower than 1.5 eV, becoming the dominant defects, as shown in Fig. 2. The formation energy for neutral Si is only 0.84 eV, and it acts as a donor defect, which is quite abnormal because the anion interstitial is usually an acceptor defect in compound semiconductors such as in ZnS and ZnO.52,53Fig. 4 shows the atomic structure around the S interstitial. As we can see, the interstitial S not only bonds with the neighboring Bi (Bi–S bond length 2.67 Å), but also bonds with a neighboring S (S–S bond length 2.06 Å), which is similar to the split-anion interstitials in other compound semiconductors.8,55 The p–p hybridization between the two S atoms decreases its energy, thus making Si the dominant defect. Furthermore, the S 3p + S 3p hybridization pushes one anti-bonding state upward, producing an occupied (0/2+) donor level in the bandgap, about 0.6 eV above the VBM as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 4  Relaxed atomic structure around the +2 charged S interstitial, +1 charged SBi antisite and +1 charged Bi vacancy. 
Neutral SBi has a formation energy slightly lower than 1.4 eV. Compared to Si, it is a relatively shallow donor, with the (0/+) level about 0.1 eV below the CBM. When an S atom replaces a Bi atom, a large structural relaxation happens too, with a 2.06 Å S–S bond formed (as shown in Fig. 4 for the +2 charged Si) and the strong S 3p + S 3p hybridization pushes one anti-bonding state upward, producing the localized but shallow (0/+) donor level near the CBM.
As we can see, the formation of S–S bonds makes the anion interstitial Si and anion-substitute-cation antisite SBi become donor defects, which is abnormal because they are usually acceptor defects.52,53 For the same reason, the cation vacancy VBi becomes a donor defect in Bi2S3. As shown in Fig. 4, an S–S bond is also formed near the +1 charged VBi after relaxation, and the strong S 3p + S 3p hybridization pushes the occupied bonding states downward into the valence band while the unoccupied anti-bonding states upward close to the CBM, which decreases the total energy significantly and stabilizes the +1 charged donor state of VBi. This is the case when the Fermi level is lower than 1.1 eV. However, when the Fermi level is high and the anti-bonding states are occupied by four electrons (VBi becomes −3 charged and thus an acceptor), the S 3p + S 3p hybridization cannot decrease the total energy and the formation of the S–S bond is energetically not favorable. The transition from the +1 charged donor state to −3 charged acceptor state happens at the Fermi level 1.1 eV above the VBM (0.3 eV below the CBM), corresponding to the (3−/+) level as shown in Fig. 3.
Considering the common mechanism that the easy formation of S–S bonds stabilizes the donor state of Si, SBi and VBi, we can understand why most of the intrinsic defects act as donor defects in Bi2S3. The easy formation of S–S bonds results from the quasi-one-dimensional structure of Bi2S3, which has more tolerance to the structural distortion.
Since the low-energy (high-concentration) defect Si produces deep levels in the bandgap, the photovoltaic efficiency of the Bi-poor and S-rich Bi2S3 samples is also limited. Therefore the intrinsic Bi2S3 should not be an ideal photovoltaic absorber material no matter synthesized under a Bi-rich, S-poor or a Bi-poor, S-rich condition.
4. Extrinsic doping (impurities)
From the discussion above, we can see that the undoped Bi2S3 always shows intrinsic n-type conductivity. In the solar cell devices, the absorber or buffer layer materials are usually doped to control its electrical conductivity and form a p–n junction. To predict whether it is possible to achieve bipolar (both p-type and n-type) doping in Bi2S3 which is important for designing p–n junction based devices, we studied a series of extrinsic dopant elements in Bi2S3, including Pb, Cu, Ag, I, Br, Cl and F. We found that only Pb doping under the Bi-poor and S-rich condition can make the sample show weak p-type conductivity, while other dopants lead to good n-type conductivity.
4.1 Pb doping
When Pb is doped into Bi2S3, it tends to occupy the PbBi and Pbi sites. Their formation energy dependence on the Fermi level is plotted in Fig. 5. Overall PbBi has a lower formation energy than Pbi, which indicates that PbBi is easier to form than Pbi. This can be understood considering that Pb2+ has a large ionic radius and the ionic radius disparity between Bi3+ and Pb2+ is small.
 Fig. 5  Calculated formation energies of PbBi and Pbi as a function of Fermi levels under (a) Bi-rich and (b) S-rich conditions. The formation energies of the intrinsic defects are also included in order to show the competition between intrinsic and extrinsic defects. 
The PbBi substitution site is an acceptor with the (−/+) ionization energy level 0.51 eV above the VBM, as shown in Fig. 7. When Pb replaces Bi in the lattice, the Bi–S bonds are replaced by Pb–S bonds. Because the Pb 6s levels are higher in energy than the Bi 6s levels, the hybridization between Pb 6s states and S 3p states is stronger than that between Bi 6s and S 3p, pushing the acceptor level up relative to the top valance bands (which are mainly the antibonding states of the Bi 6s and S 3p hybridization), and thus producing a deep level in the gap. In contrast, the Pbi interstitial is a donor with the (+/2+) ionization level 0.25 eV below the CBM. This deep level is composed mainly of the Pb 6p and Bi 6p orbitals, because a Pb–Bi bond is formed around the Pbi interstitial and the hybridization between Pb 6p states and the Bi 6p states pushes the donor levels downward from the conduction band into the bandgap.
Under the Bi-rich and S-poor conditions, the most favorable doping site PbBi has a formation energy lower than 1.1 eV, but it is not as low as those of the intrinsic donor defects such as VS (see Fig. 5), so Pb doping cannot make the Bi2S3 sample p-type. The competition between the PbBi acceptor and the VS donor sets the Fermi level located above the middle of the bandgap, about 0.5 eV below the CBM level, i.e., the sample is weakly n-type under this condition.
Under the Bi-poor and S-rich condition, PbBi decreases its formation energy significantly, making its formation energy even lower than those of the lowest-energy intrinsic defects such as Si and SBi (when the Fermi level is high). The competition between the acceptor PbBi and the donor Si and SBi sets the Fermi level located below the middle of the bandgap, about 0.5 eV above the VBM level, so the sample becomes weakly p-type. However, it should be noted that the Fermi level is still quite high, so the hole concentration is still low.
4.2 F, Cl, Br, I, Ag and Cu doping
In contrast to Pb doping which makes Bi2S3 weakly n-type and even p-type, doping by F, Cl, Br, I, Cu, and Ag enhances the n-type conductivity significantly. The calculated formation energies for these dopants at different sites are plotted in Fig. 6, and their ionization (transition) energy levels in the bandgap are plotted in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 6  Calculated formation energies of F, Cl, Br, I, Cu, and Ag dopants at different sites, as a function of Fermi levels under (a) Bi-rich and (b) S-rich conditions. 
 Fig. 7  Calculated transition energy levels of different dopants in Bi2S3. 
We first discuss the results about the F, Cl, Br and I doping. They all prefer substituting the S anion as the energetically favorable doping sites, i.e., the formation energies of FS, ClS, BrS and IS substitution are much lower than those of the Fi, Cli, Bri and Ii interstitials, which can be understood considering that substitution causes small structural distortion. Among FS, ClS, BrS and IS, ClS has the lowest formation energy and the FS and IS have almost degenerate energy levels, which should result from the smallest size difference between Cl and S.
The ionization energy levels of FS, ClS, BrS and IS donors are all resonant in the conduction band, with no impurity levels in the bandgap, indicating that these dopants are all ionized and generate free electron carriers once they are doped into the Bi2S3 lattice. Since their formation energies are only 0.2–0.5 eV under the Bi-rich, S-poor condition and 0.5–0.8 eV under the Bi-poor, S-rich condition (when the Fermi level is at the CBM), their concentration (solubility) can be very high in the Bi2S3 lattice. Therefore very high concentration of electron carriers may be achieved in Bi2S3 through Cl, Br, F and I doping.
Although the Fi, Cli, Bri and Ii interstitials have higher formation energies (lower concentration) in Bi2S3, they all show an abnormal trend, i.e., they prefer acting as donors when the Fermi level is low, in contrast to the anion interstitials in many other semiconductors which usually act as acceptors.46,52,53 This abnormal trend is similar to that of the intrinsic S interstitial which acts also as a donor. When these interstitials act as donors, they all undergo dramatic structural distortion. As shown in Fig. 8, the +1 charged Ii forms two I–S bonds with the neighboring S atoms. Bri actually takes the place of one S atom and displaces the S atom to an interstitial site, thus splitting into BrS and Si (with an S–S bond formed near the Si, as discussed in Section 3). Because of the formation of S–I and S–S bonds, the p–p hybridization pushes the partially occupied antibonding state (the donor level) close to the CBM for Ii and into the conduction band for Bri, so the (0/+) transition energy level of Ii is close to the CBM, and that of Bri is resonant in the conduction band (absent in the bandgap). Therefore, only in a very small Fermi level range close to the CBM level, Ii can be stable in its neutral state, and in the other range Ii is ionized to the +1 charged donor state. Bri is always ionized to the +1 charged donor state in the whole Fermi level range.
 Fig. 8  Structures of F, Cl, Br and I interstitials at different charged states: (a) +1 charged Fi, (b) −1 charged Fi, (c) +1 charged Cli, (d) −1 charged Cli, (e) +1 charged Bri, and (f) +1 charged Ii. The interstitial dopants are shown in blue, green and olive. 
In contrast, Fi acts as an acceptor in a much wider Fermi level range, and acts as a donor only when the Fermi level is close to VBM, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the local structures around Fi. It forms three F–Bi bonds with the neighboring Bi and causes small structural distortion when it acts as a −1 charged acceptor. However, it displaces one neighboring S significantly and forms an F–S pair (bond) which takes the place of the S atom, when it acts as a +1 charged donor. The (−/+) transition energy level of Fi is deep in the bandgap, resulting from the local antibonding state of F–S p–p hybridization. Since the formation energy of the −1 charged Fi decreases as the Fermi level increases, the formation energies of Fi decreases to close to or even lower than that of FS when the Fermi level is close to the CBM, so its concentration in n-type Bi2S3 is not negligible. Considering that Fi may be a deep-level recombination center, we predict that F doping is not a good choice for improving the n-type conductivity and photovoltaic performance.
The local structure of Cli is similar to that of Fi. When the Fermi level is low, Cli is stable as a +1 charged donor, but when the Fermi level is high, Cli can be stable in its neutral state or in the −1 charged acceptor state. Its (0/+) and (−/0) levels are close to the CBM level. The formation energy of Cli is always high in n-type Bi2S3, so its influence on the electric or photovoltaic performance can be neglected. Considering that both Br and Cl doping increases only the electron carrier concentration and does not cause high concentration of recombination centers, we predict that Br and Cl doping should be a good choice for improving the n-type conductivity and photovoltaic performance of Bi2S3. Since the formation energy of ClS and BrS can be very low under the Bi-rich, S-poor conditions, very high concentration of electron carriers and high n-type conductivity may be achieved under these conditions.
The effect of Cu and Ag doping is similar to that of F, Br and I doping, although the favorable doping site is different. Cu and Ag dopants prefer the interstitial sites (Cui, Agi), rather than substituting the cation Bi (CuBi, AgBi), with formation energies at the substitution sites much higher than those of the interstitial sites. The formation energies of Cui and Agi are only 0.2 and 0.8 eV respectively under the Bi-rich, S-poor condition, and 0.7 and 0.8 eV under the Bi-poor, S-rich condition (when the Fermi level is close to the CBM). They both act as donors, with the ionization energy levels resonant in the conduction band, so all these interstitial dopants generate free electron carriers once they are doped into Bi2S3.
Considering their low formation energies and resonant donor levels, we predict that Cu and Ag doping can also make the Bi2S3 sample highly n-type and push the Fermi level upward. In particular under the Bi-rich, S-poor condition, Cu doping can produce very high concentration of electron carriers and pin the Fermi level close to the CBM. When the Fermi level is determined to be close to the CBM (n-type) by Cui and Agi, CuBi and AgBi both act as acceptors, and their ionization energy levels are deep in the bandgap. Their formation energies can be low (concentration can be high) in the n-type Bi2S3 sample under the Bi-poor, S-rich condition, but is very low (concentration can be very low) under the Bi-rich, S-poor condition. So a Bi-rich, S-poor condition should be better for increasing the n-type conductivity through Cu or Ag doping and meanwhile suppressing the formation of recombination centers.
Summarizing the effect of F, Cl, Br, I, Cu and Ag doping, we can see that all these dopants prefer acting as donors and producing electron carriers in Bi2S3. This seems to be similar to the case of the intrinsic defects, where most of them act as donors and make Bi2S3 intrinsically n-type. The favorability of the n-type conductivity may result from the low conduction band edge position of Bi2S3, which is 4.27 eV below the vacuum level.17 According to the doping limit rule,46,64 it is easier to dope a semiconductor to n-type if its conduction band is low and it is difficult to dope it to p-type if its valence band is low. As shown in Fig. 9, both the conduction and valence band edges of Bi2S3 are low compared to those of other photovoltaic semiconductors, so the favorability of the n-type conductivity can be understood.

5. Discussion
The calculated results showed that Pb doping in Bi2S3 is unique among all the dopant elements that we studied, because it can make the intrinsically n-type Bi2S3 type-inverted into p-type. Therefore a p–n junction may be formed between the Pb-doped Bi2S3 and undoped Bi2S3. Interestingly, Rath et al. realized an over threefold efficiency increase in the p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 nano-heterojunction solar cell with a 3-absorber-layer structure (120 nm PbS quantum dot layer, 180 nm PbS/Bi2S3 blend nanocomposite layer and 40 nm Bi2S3 nanocrystal layer), relative to the conventional bilayer heterojunction solar cell (210 nm PbS quantum dots and 120 nm Bi2S3 nanocrystals).29 The explanation to the increased efficiency is the more efficient charge separation and transport in the nano-heterojunction structure, with the recombination in the n-Bi2S3 layer largely suppressed since the photo-generated holes in the PbS quantum dots and PbS/Bi2S3 nanocomposite layers are repelled from the n-type Bi2S3 layer by the built-in field.29 However, one open question is that the relatively narrow bandgap of Bi2S3 around 1.3–1.45 eV makes the visible-light absorption strong and there is still a high concentration of photo-generated holes in the Bi2S3 layer, although the photo-generated holes in the PbS quantum dots and PbS/Bi2S3 nanocomposite layers are repelled from the Bi2S3 layer by the built-in field. Since the intrinsic defects such as VS and Si have high concentration and deep levels, the recombination in the Bi2S3 layer is still serious and cannot be suppressed. Our current calculations show that Pb doping is unique in Bi2S3 and can make the semiconductor weakly p-type. During the fabrication of the p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 nano-heterojunction solar cell, some of the Pb atoms may be doped into the surface layer of the n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals, with the surface layer type-inverted into weakly p-type, then a buried p–n junction may be formed in the Bi2S3 layer, which can facilitate the electron–hole separation and thus increase the carrier lifetime as well as the photovoltaic efficiency. If this new explanation based on our dopant calculations is correct, the efficiency increase should be not so obvious if the PbS layer is replaced by other materials free of Pb (since many other elements cannot dope Bi2S3 to p-type). We call for future experimental investigation.
Bi2S3 plays different roles in a series of solar cells, such as the sensitizer in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells,22,23 light absorber material,26 counter electrode in CdSe quantum dot-sensitized solar cells,24 active layer in organic/inorganic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells,27,28 and n-type electron acceptor in p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 heterojunction solar cells.17,25,29 With the calculated properties of defects and dopants, we can analyze the performance of Bi2S3 in these solar cells. Firstly, because of the high concentration of deep-level intrinsic defects (serious non-radiative recombination), the performance of the solar cells using Bi2S3 as the light absorber, sensitizer or active layer should be limited. On the other hand, the quasi-one-dimensional structure of Bi2S3 indicates that the electron or hole carriers may have a large effective mass and thus a poor mobility along the direction perpendicular to the (Bi4S6)n ribbons, which limits the diffusion length of minority carriers. This is another limitation to the application of Bi2S3 as a light absorber, sensitizer or active layer, resulting from the electronic dimensionality as introduced by Xiao et al.,4 and indicates that the orientation control of Bi2S3 is necessary for these applications.
Secondly, although most of the intrinsic defects are donors, their formation energies are not very low and thus the concentration is not very high, so the n-type conductivity of undoped Bi2S3 and its performance as the n-type electron acceptor or counter electrode is also limited. Cl, Br and Cu doping can increase the n-type conductivity dramatically, especially under the Bi-rich condition. Meanwhile, the deep-level recombination centers (mainly the compensating acceptors) are suppressed under the Bi-rich condition. Therefore, we predict that good performance may be achieved using the Cl, Br and Cu doped Bi2S3 synthesized under the Bi-rich condition as the electron acceptor or counter electrode.
The band alignment in Fig. 9 shows that the conduction band edge of Bi2S3 is slightly lower than those of CuInSe2 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), between those of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, and very close to that of PbS. Considering the high n-type conductivity achievable in Cl, Br and Cu doped Bi2S3, we predict that a thin layer of n-type Bi2S3 may be a good candidate as the n-type electron acceptor or counter electrode material in CuInSe2, Cu2ZnSnSe4, MAPb(I,Br,Cl)3 and PbS based solar cells.
6. Conclusions
A series of intrinsic point defects and dopants in Bi2S3 solar cells are studied using first-principles calculations. Most of the intrinsic defects in Bi2S3 including even Si are found to be donor defects, explaining the observed n-type conductivity and also limiting the p-type doping. Significant structural distortion with the formation of S–S bonds makes Si, SBi and VBi (which are usually acceptor defects in other semiconductors) become donors in Bi2S3. No matter under Bi-rich or Bi-poor conditions, there are a high concentration of deep level defects (BiS, VS, or SBi, Si), so the minority carrier lifetime and photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells using Bi2S3 as the light absorber is limited. Most of the dopant elements such as Cu, Br and Cl make Bi2S3 more n-type, except Pb which makes it weakly p-type. Based on this, we propose that the surface region of n-type Bi2S3 nanocrystals in p-PbS/n-Bi2S3 nano-heterojunction solar cells may be type-inverted into p-type due to Pb doping, with a buried p–n junction formed in the Bi2S3 nanocrystals, which provides a new explanation to the observed longer carrier lifetime and higher efficiency. Considering its relatively low conduction band and high n-type conductivity, we predict that the Cu, Br and Cl doped Bi2S3 may be an ideal n-type electron acceptor or counter electrode material, especially under the Bi-rich condition, while its performance as the light-absorber or sensitizer material is intrinsically limited.
