    , Accepted 16th September 2016First published on 19th September 2016AbstractWe investigate the suitability of four different inorganic materials (chromium oxide (CrOX), titanium oxide (TiOX), aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) and zinc oxide (ZnO)) as electrode transport layers in fully roll-to-roll (R2R) fabricated P3HT:ICxA organic solar cells. CrOX and TiOX were found to be unsuitable, as the CrOX devices did not exhibit rectifying behaviour while the TiOX devices did not withstand the annealing conditions. Of the last two ETLs, ZnO showed by far the most promise with devices demonstrating an average efficiency of 2.2%, which is the highest reported value for R2R devices in normal geometry, and a significantly extended lifetime compared with AZO devices under ISOS-L-2 conditions.
Introduction
Solution based bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPV) have been widely studied during the past decade due to their potential for inexpensive electricity production.1,2 A common metric for means of comparison between power generation sources is the levelised cost of electricity, which is determined by two factors: the overall cost (fabrication and maintenance) of the modules and the total electricity generated.3
It is widely recognised that for OPVs to be manufactured at low cost, high through-put roll-to-roll (R2R) coating and printing methods must be utilized together with low temperature processing and flexible substrates.4,5 Although the requirement for high through-put fabrication has been widely acknowledged since the field of organic photovoltaics emerged,6,7 only a handful of scientific groups have focused on developing industry scalable fabrication; using methods such as slot-die coating, flexographic printing and rotary screen printing.8–14 This lack of activity is perhaps unsurprising given that upscaling is a challenging goal. Firstly, changing the deposition technique from laboratory scale spin-coating necessarily requires a re-optimization of all of the inks involved in device preparation.15 Secondly, as fabrication moves from laboratory devices on the square centimetre scale to the preparation of hundreds of metres of printed cells, the likelihood of a single coating error or imperfection causing the entire array to be non-functional, increases commensurately.16
The overall electricity generated by solar modules consists of two equally important parameters: (i) power conversion efficiency (PCE) and (ii) stability. Over the past decade, there has been an enormous focus by the scientific community on improving device PCE, which as a consequence has improved to a level where hero devices are now reaching PCEs in excess of 11%.17 By contrast, few studies have focused on the stability of modules. It is now increasingly recognised that the stability of OPV modules is a highly complex issue that is determined by multiple independent factors. Indeed, photochemical, morphological and interfacial stability, as well as interactions with buffer layers, encapsulation and device geometry have all been reported to be important parameters.18,19
Traditionally, the architecture used to fabricate OPV devices is described as either a “normal geometry” (where positive charge carriers flow to the transparent electrode) or as an “inverted geometry” (where negative charge carriers flow to the transparent electrode). To date, work on upscaling has been almost exclusively conducted on devices fabricated with an inverted geometry,8,20,21 which is in contrast to laboratory scale spin-coated devices where a normal geometry is predominantly used.22 This discrepancy arises primarily from the challenge of fabricating metal coatings using scalable deposition methods. Indeed, the few examples in literature of R2R OPV prepared in normal geometry involved printed cells that were all cut out into small samples prior to application of a top metal electrode by laboratory-scale thermal evaporation.9,10,23
Recent work in this laboratory has focused on developing the fabrication of solar modules in normal geometry using scalable metal deposition techniques. Our initial work showed that the sputter deposition of aluminium top-electrodes onto spin-coated devices fabricated on an ITO-substrate produced OPV devices with a PCE of ca. 1.6%, compared to devices with a conventional evaporated electrode that had a PCE of ca. 2.1%. Moreover, we showed that this difference was due to the formation of an energy barrier at the interface between the active layer and aluminium during sputter deposition.24 As a consequence of continuous stack and ink optimization, subsequently we demonstrated fully R2R fabricated devices with a sputtered back electrode by introducing aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) as an electron transport layer (ETL).14 We postulated that the benefits of the AZO layer were twofold: (a) prevention of the previously identified energy barrier from forming at the active layer/aluminium interface, and (b) prevention of aluminium penetration into the active layer, which causes the devices to short circuit as the bottom silver/PEDOT:PSS grid electrode has a large roughness, especially on the silver grid. In this case, the device efficiency only reached ca. 0.9%, which we ascribed to poor wettability of the AZO ink onto the active layer since light beam induced current (LBIC) maps of the as-prepared devices revealed inhomogeneous current extraction.
In this paper, we examine the effect of different ETLs on the device performance of R2R fabricated normal geometry solar cells. In particular, we focus on the coverage and uniformity of the ETL when replacing AZO with other inorganic metal oxide ETLs. We compare the performance of AZO with three other metal oxide ETLs, all of which have been previously characterised in OPV devices: chromium oxide (CrOX),25,26 titanium oxide (TiOX)27,28 and zinc oxide (ZnO).20,29 The performance of the devices prepared with the four different ETLs were evaluated both by PCE and stability.
Experimental
Materials
Materials were used as received unless otherwise stated. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) Clevios PH1000 was purchased from Heraeus. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was synthesized in house by modified McCullough30 and had an estimated molecular weight of 20 kDA. ICxA (a low cost indene fullerene mixture consisting of 36% ICMA, 53% ICBA and 11% ICTA) was synthesized in house according to literature.31 Zinc acetate, basic aluminium acetate and 2,2-methoxyethoxyacetic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Ink formulation and deposition
Coating and printing was conducted on a Solar-1 coating line from Grafisk Maskinfabrik using a slot-die head developed at DTU Energy Conversion having a 50 mL ink dead volume to ensure uniform inking to all 13 stripes. All thicknesses are unless stated otherwise determined by preparing a thickness vs. absorption standard curve by spin coating and measuring the absorption of the R2R coated layer on flexible substrate.
Charge collecting silver grid
Silver ink was R2R printed on to untreated PET using a patterned photopolymer flexo plate and 1.5 cm3 m−2 anilox roller. The conductive silver grid pattern was printed at 20 m min−1 and annealed in an inline oven (4 m in length) at 140 °C for a dry thickness of approximately 200 nm.
PEDOT:PSS electrode
1 L of Clevios PH1000 was mixed with 265 mL of isopropanol, and 65 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide. The mixture was treated with an ultrasonic booster horn (650 watt) for 2 × 30 s, after which 1.3 g of Zonyl® fluorosurfactant was added to the suspension and it was left to stir for 20 min prior to use. The PEDOT:PSS ink was slot-die coated with a web-speed of 1 m min−1 and a wet thickness of 47 μm resulting in an approximately 200 nm thick film with a drying temperature of 140 °C.
Active layer
P3HT and ICxA were dissolved in a 90:10 mixture of chlorobenzene and chloroform, respectively, the solid concentration was 22 mg mL−1 with a P3HT:ICxA ratio of 1:0.8 to ensure a sufficient wet thickness during ink deposition. The active layer was deposited by slot-die coating with 2 metre oven with a temperature of 140 °C with a web-speed of 1.5 m min−1 and the wet thickness of the coated film was 9 μm in order to obtain theoretical dry thicknesses of 150 nm using estimated densities 1.1 and 1.5 for P3HT and ICxA, respectively.
Aluminium doped zinc oxide
AZO was prepared in methanol according to literature.32 AZO was slot-die coated with 2-propanol prewetting from 65:35 methanol:2-propanol solvent mixture with a web-speed of 1 m min−1 with 4 metres of ovens at 140 °C. The deposited wet-thicknesses were 4, 6 and 8 μm in order to vary dry thickness.
Chromium oxide
CrOX was deposited by sputter coating of chromium on top of the active layer which was subsequently subjected to air, causing the chromium to oxidize and form CrOX. The sputter of chromium was conducted at 3000 W (3000 W was used to ensure a homogenously covering layer) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 s resulting in layer thicknesses of 4, 7, 10 and 13 nm in an attempt to achieve an optimum thickness.
Titanium oxide
Titanium oxide ink was prepared by a sol–gel route. A precursor solution containing 20 mL titanium diisoporpoxide bis(acetonate) 75% in isopropanol was diluted in 160 mL isopropanol and stirred. 10 mL glacial acetic acid was added, followed by 10 mL of deionized water. The solution was heated to 60 °C for 12 hours (200 mL TiOX stock solution). Prior printing, the titanium oxide stock solution was diluted with isopropanol in a 1:10 ratio. TiOX was slot-die coated with a web-speed of 1 m min−1 with 2 metres of ovens at 140 °C. The deposited wet-thicknesses were 4, 6 and 8 μm in order to obtain 13, 19 and 25 nm dry thickness.
Zinc oxide
ZnO was coated as an acetone based nanoparticular formulation prepared according to literature.33 ZnO was slot-die coated with isopropanol prewetting of the active layer with a web-speed of 1 m min−1 with 2 metres of ovens at 140 °C. Two ink formulations were utilized in order to achieve presented thickness range 10, 20, and 30 nm was coated from a formulation with a concentration of 16 mg mL−1 and the ink used to coat 40, 60, and 80 nm had a concentration of 56 mg mL−1 with wet thicknesses in the range of 7–12 μm.
Aluminium back electrode
Sputter coating of aluminium cathodes was performed using custom-built R2R sputter coater (Semicore Equipment, Inc). The system is comprised of two terminal 7 cm spindles which besides unwinding and rewinding also ensures web-tension as the web travels around a water-cooled drum with a diameter of 22.9 cm. The sputtering chamber is evacuated to low vacuum (0.1 mTorr) with a Trivac D40B-D65B roughing pump (Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum) and then further evacuated to a high vacuum base pressure (10−6 Torr) using a water-chilled Cryo-Torr pump (Helix Technologies). Sputtering was performed in an argon plasma created by a direct current (DC) magnetron; with power supplied to the 35.6 × 10.1 cm2 aluminium targets (Angstrom Sciences, Inc.) using separate 6 kW Pinnacle DC power sources (Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.). Sputtered cathodes for all OPV films in this study were subsequently prepared using a deposition time of 42 s at a sputtering base pressure of 5 × 10−6 Torr, a process pressure of 2 mTorr, and a target power of 1.5 kW (power density = 4.15 W cm−2) yielding an aluminium thickness of approximately 100 nm. OPV films were sputtered through a shadow mask applied to the samples with high temperature resistant tape.
Switching and encapsulation
Switching was conducted by subjecting the device to reverse bias in short pulses using an adjustable power supply with a current of 1 A and a voltage starting at 3 V. The reverse bias magnitude was subsequently increased in 2–3 volts steps up to a maximum value of 20 V for AZO devices and 10 V for ZnO and TiOx devices, which increased the resistance through the device from 2 Ω to 6 kΩ.
Devices for efficiency comparison were encapsulated between two pieces of microscope glass using a UV curable epoxy (Dymax GA-103) as adhesive and copper tape to ensure contact with the metal electrodes. Devices for lifetime were encapsulated between two pieces of Amcor UB4 with UV-barrier utilizing copper tape to ensure 0.5 cm between the active device and the closest open entry point for oxygen and water.

J–V measurement and lifetime study
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements and lifetime study were performed using a sulphur plasma lamp (irradiation spectrum can be found in Fig. S6†) or a Newport AAA Solar simulator (for reference) on devices with a typical area of 4 cm2. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a silicon reference solar cell (FHG-ISE). J–V data was recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
Light-beam induced current
Light-beam induced current (LBIC) measurements were conducted using a custom-built setup as previously described.34 Briefly, an electronically modulated laser diode (635 nm) is pigtailed into a single-mode optical fibre. The optical fibre is coupled into an assembly containing collimating and focusing lenses providing control over the spot radius down to 3.3 μm. For this study, a spot size of 100 μm was chosen, at which the photocurrent responds linearly with light intensity. The solar cell was mounted on 2 orthogonal computer-controlled translation stages. The short-circuit current of the solar cell was converted to a voltage using a current-to-voltage preamplifier (Stanford Research, SR570) before being detected using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research, SR830).
Capacitance–frequency and capacitance–voltage measurements
Capacitance measurements were conducted using the commercially available PAIOS 2 system (Fluxim AG). The capacitance response was measured over the range of 10 Hz to 2 MHz with an AC oscillation amplitude of 60 mV. Capacitance was recorded in the dark at 0 V applied bias for measurements where the frequency was varied. For measurements where the applied bias voltage was varied, capacitance was determined at a constant perturbation frequency of 1.5 kHz.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected by illuminating the samples with a non-monochromatic X-ray source (Omnivac) using Al Ka (1486.6 eV) radiation, and the photoemission collected by an SES2002 analyser (Scienta). Regions scans were performed using a pass energy of 10 eV. Working pressure in the analysis chamber was typically 2 × 10−9 mBar during spectra collection. Peak fittings for chromium oxides and hydroxides were conducted using CASA based on the work of Biesinger et al.35
Scanning electron microscope
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was conducted on a Hitachi TM3030Plus tabletop SEM.
Results and discussion
The device structure for the fully R2R coated devices is presented in Fig. 1. The devices consist of five printed or coated layers. The first layer consists of a flexographically printed silver layer in a finger pattern with a height of approximately 200 nm, a width of 200 μm and a distance between fingers of 2 mm (Fig. 1B). On top of the silver finger pattern a highly conductive PEDOT:PSS is slot-die coated with a thickness of approximately 200 nm to complete the transparent electrode (Fig. 1C). The second layer comprises a 150 nm thick active layer, consisting of a blend of P3HT and ICxA (a fullerene based acceptor developed in this laboratory31) in a ratio of 1:0.8, which is slot-die coated from a chlorobenzene/chloroform mixture (Fig. 1D). The third layer in the OPV device is formed by the metal oxide ETL. Four different ETLs were used in this study with the thickness of the prepared ETLs varied to determine an optimal layer thickness. Three of these ETLs (ZnO, AZO and TiOX) were deposited by slot-die coating (Fig. 1E–G), whereas the CrOX layer was fabricated by sputter deposition of thin layers of chromium metal which were then exposed to air to form CrOX, which is semitransparent (Fig. 1H). To complete the device architecture a 100 nm layer of aluminium was sputter deposited as a reflective top-electrode (Fig. 1I). Each layer was systematically investigated after each deposition to reveal any imperfections in the film structure.

Devices prepared with AZO as the ETL show an efficiency maximum of 1.23% for an ETL thickness of 45 nm with ETL thicknesses of 30 and 60 nm resulting in device efficiencies of 0.75 and 0.98%, respectively. This maximum in PCE stems mainly from an increased short circuit current (JSC) but also the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) experience a slight increase, most likely due to the increased charge density from the higher photocurrent and optimized charge collection processes, respectively. Interestingly, these efficiencies are higher than presented previously.14 We can attribute this slightly increased performance to a decrease in the molecular weight of the P3HT polymer used in this study compared to our previous work. In both cases, the P3HT was synthesised in this laboratory, but whereas the earlier study used P3HT with a molecular weight of ca. 40 kDa in this work the P3HT molecular weight was reduced to ca. 20 kDa in order to improve the morphology of the printed active layer.36
CrOX was coated on top of active layer by sputter deposition with thicknesses of 4, 7, 10 and 13 nm. A distinct advantage of sputter deposition is the avoidance of issues regarding wetting and compatibility between active layer and ETL ink. However, the J–V characterization of the prepared devices revealed ohmic behaviour with a very low series resistance of 2–3 Ω (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the sputtering of this material leads to shorting through the active layer. It is possible that the sputtered metallic chromium fails to completely oxidize, thereby preventing the formation of an electron transport layer with appropriate energy levels for charge extraction.
To shed light on this behaviour, the oxidation of Cr to CrOX was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Cr 2p scans can be seen in Fig. S1† and are summarised in Fig. S2.† XPS data showed the composition of the Cr layer was mainly Cr(0) with a surface consisting of 1.5–2.5 nm of Cr(III) with a 1:1.1 ratio between Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3. Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3 are two of the main components in the CrOX buffer layers that have been previously presented by Wang et al.37 and Tu et al.38 It is likely that Wang et al. did not detect the presence of Cr(OH)3 since their paper was published before Biesinger et al.35 who reported new XPS fitting parameters for chromium oxide. The presence of the Cr(III) and oxide species that we observe on the surface of the sputtered Cr layer is consistent with the formation of the electron transport layer detected in previous studies. We therefore conclude that the issue with poor photodiode device behaviour in the chromium experiments stems from another source, most likely chromium metal penetrating the active layer and forming multiple short-circuit pathways as a consequence of the energetic sputter deposition process. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that our Cr(III) precursor layer is thinner than that reported by Wang et al. and Tu et al.
Devices prepared with TiOX showed a maximum efficiency of 0.46% at 19 nm with 0.02% and 0.45% for 13 and 25 nm, respectively. A PCE of 0.02% at 13 nm indicates that a minimum thickness of TiOX is required to form a sufficient buffer layer. The efficiencies presented for TiOX devices are all for non-encapsulated and without additional thermal annealing as the efficiency of the device decreased significantly upon each of these processes (Fig. S3†). We speculate that the observed efficiency decrease is mostly likely due to either a mechanical deformation during encapsulation or an absolute thickness reduction of TiOX as it is being heat treated (the devices also heat up during encapsulation due to absorption of the high intensity UV light used to cure the epoxy-based encapsulant). Both of these processes (encapsulation and annealing) are essential for the large scale production of OPV devices. Devices with ZnO as an ETL were prepared with thicknesses ranging from 10–80 nm and reveal a maximum in PCE of 2.22% for a ZnO thickness of 30 nm, which is due primarily to an increase in FF and a minor increase in JSC. This PCE is the highest so far reported for R2R OPV devices fabricated with a normal geometry.
Our measured efficiency value of 2.2% needs to be placed in the context of known efficiencies of large area printed organic photovoltaics. Although small scale spin-coated hero devices are capable of reaching much higher efficiencies (>10%), it is well-known that a substantial drop in efficiency is anticipated with scaled-up fabrication. For example, Jørgensen et al.39 showed that, for all devices, PCE decreases approximately exponentially with device area: from 10–11% at very small areas (∼0.04 cm2) to 2.7% at 2 cm2 falling to approximately 2.55% at 4 cm2 before asymptotically approaching 2.5% at larger areas. The fact that our measured value of 2.2% is very close to the expected maximum efficiency for large area devices is especially promising given that very low cost donor and acceptor materials (P3HT and a fullerene based acceptor at 15 USD per g)27 were used. Moreover, we observed a PCE reduction of only 0.6% in going from a small area spin-coated device (4 mm2)31 to large-area (4 cm2) slot-die coated device on a R2R setup. By comparison, other R2R prepared devices (with P3HT as donor) with a similar electrode (but in an inverted geometry) report an efficiency of only 1.8% for single cells40 and 1.1% to 1.75% for modules,41 which is lower than the 2.2% efficiency that we report here; suggesting that the normal geometry architecture may assist in maintaining device performance at large areas. The dependency of PCE upon ETL thickness seen in this study is quite different to that previously reported by Krebs et al.,40 who demonstrated inverted devices with a ZnO thickness of up to 96 nm without observing any decrease in efficiency. This difference is not unexpected as changing from an inverted to a normal geometry will significantly alter the level of UV irradiation that reaches the zinc oxide transport layer, since this layer is now screened by UV absorbing polymer and fullerenes in the active layer blend in the normal geometry as seen in Fig. S4.† Therefore, the ETL must be made thinner in this geometry to receive the same amount of volume irradiation.
The capacitance of the ZnO device is constant with frequency between the ranges of 10 Hz to 10 kHz, whilst the AZO device displays both a higher overall capacitance, and an increasing capacitance towards low frequency. This suggests a larger number of deeper energy charge trap states in the AZO interlayer, which are progressively accessed as the perturbation frequency is decreased. The value of the capacitance in the dark at 1–50 kHz is higher than what would be expected for purely geometric capacitance with a dielectric constant of 3–3.542,43 in P3HT:PCBM films with these dimensions (∼16 nF for ZnO and 13 nF for AZO). It is speculated that this elevated capacitance is related to additional doping charges within the devices originating from the addition of the interlayers. To confirm this, the dependence of the capacitance on the bias voltage was determined for each device (Fig. 4b). Plotting the capacitance as a function of the bias voltage provides the ability to probe any potential charge accumulation in the device as the built-in field driving charge extraction is systematically diminished. At negative values the bias voltage adds to the magnitude of the built-in extraction field and sweeps charges out of the device. Consequently the capacitance in the dark is reduced for both devices as any mobile charges are forced out of the device. For the ZnO interlayer, this capacitance value at −1 V closely approaches the expected geometric capacitance, confirming the complete removal of any excess charges and a dielectric constant consistent with previous work. The AZO film still exhibits a somewhat higher value than the expected geometric capacitance, suggesting that −1 V is not sufficient bias to completely remove all the excess dopant charges. As the bias voltage becomes positive and sweeps towards VOC, the extraction field is reduced towards zero and charges begin to accumulate causing the observed peak. This peak is indicative of the value of the built-in field, and occurs at 0.70–0.72 V for both AZO and ZnO, indicative of similar energy levels for each interlayer. It is observed that the capacitance begins to increase at much lower bias voltages in the AZO device, indicative of poorer charge extraction or larger doping charge density influencing the extraction by shielding the built-in field. Screening of the electric field by large density of doping charges may also be responsible for the lower fill factor observed from the J–V measurements under illumination (Table 1).
The surface quality of the coated ETLs was examined via visual inspection with the imperfections observed as small different coloured spots (going from purple to a more blueish colour) all across the individual devices. These spots arise from inhomogeneous thickness variations in the film with the colour variation arising from optical interference effects.44Fig. 3 shows that the number of coating imperfections is greatest when applying a layer of AZO (Fig. 3A) on top of the active layer. This observation has previously been ascribed to the use of a non-optimal solvent mixture containing methanol.45 The TiOX layer (Fig. 3B) appears uniform with no colour variation observed, whereas the ZnO layer (Fig. 3C) shows minor colour variations along the coated film. These observations are consistent with the light beam induced current (LBIC) maps shown in Fig. 5 where a deep blue area in the LBIC image indicates a region from which no photocurrent is extracted whereas light blue going towards yellow indicates increasing photocurrent extraction. The laser used in the LBIC measurements had a wavelength of 635 nm, which is just on the edge of the absorption band of the active layer for these devices thereby enhancing the sensitivity to minor thickness variations in the active layer, which would not be noticeable if a laser operating at the wavelength of maximum P3HT absorption was used (Fig. S5†). It can be seen that devices prepared with AZO (Fig. 5A) have a number of dead spots corresponding to areas from where no photocurrent is extracted. These inactive areas appear in four horizontal lines along the length of device and these lines stem from drying effects in the AZO due to poor wetting of the active layer as described earlier.45 Aside from the inactive areas, the device shows a homogenous generation and extraction of photocurrent, with some minor variation due to thickness. By contrast, the ZnO ETL only exhibits a couple of vertical lines with lower photocurrent extraction (Fig. 5B).

To further probe the nature of the observed dead spots in the LBIC images, the surface of a freshly prepared device with AZO as the top surface was investigated before deposition of the aluminium cathode using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 5C reveals that, in addition to a number of minor scratches, the surface of the AZO layer contains large pinhole defects, which influence the morphology of the surrounding AZO layer. By contrast, the as deposited ZnO layer does not have any of these large pinhole defects (Fig. 5D).
Lifetime experiments
As described previously, the key figure of merit for OPV devices is their overall energy generation, which is a function of both the efficiency and the stability of the device. Devices were prepared with the ideal ETL thicknesses determined from the previous section. These devices were then encapsulated in Amcor UB4 with 1 cm edge sealing and a degradation study was conducted under ISOS-L-2 conditions (light soaking, 65 °C and ambient humidity) for 150 hours.
The three different device types (AZO, ZnO and TiOX as ETL) showed very different degradation behaviour (Fig. 6). Devices using TiOX as the ETL had a very severe “burn-in” illustrated by the significant decrease in efficiency during the first 10 hours which is expected as the efficiency for TiOX-devices reduces rapidly upon heat-treatment, as seen in Fig. S3.† During this period, the efficiency decreased to approximately 25% of the initial value, due primarily to a ∼60% drop in JSC, but a 20% drop in FF was also observed during this time. After the initial burn-in the rate of decrease in efficiency becomes much lower. However, this observation is dominated by the low absolute power conversion efficiency at this stage, which would be relatively invariant to any large percentage changes in performance that may still be occurring due to degradation. Therefore, the degradation behaviour for this ETL can only be confidently monitored outside the noise baseline to a time of ∼20 hours.
 Fig. 6  Normalized degradation curve of PCE, VOC, JSC and FF for devices prepared with AZO, ZnO and TiOX as ETL. 
ZnO ETL devices have an initial increase of around 10% in efficiency, mainly due to an increase in FF which is ascribed to the UV activation of the ZnO ETL.46 After the initial increase the efficiency decreases from a normalized value of 1.1 to 0.9 after 40 hours of degradation, upon which the rate of degradation reduces slightly and the efficiency continuous decreases to ∼0.5 after 150 hours caused by a corresponding decrease in the JSC. The degradation behaviour of AZO devices is similar to that of the ZnO devices except for the initial increase observed for ZnO devices, since AZO does not undergo UV-doping and the rate of degradation during the burn-in is slightly higher.
The degradation rate achieved for ZnO devices in this study is similar to that reported by Roth et al.41 in which they investigated the degradation behaviour of devices with a similar silver/PH1000 electrode after 7 days under ISOS-L-3 the tested devices had an efficiency of 15–25% of the initial efficiency. Similar observations have been reported by Lima et al.47 which devices had decreased to 60% of their initial efficiency during a ISOS-O-2 degradation study, they improved the device stability eliminating a layer of PEDOT:PSS. As such, the rate of degradation for ZnO devices is likely to be dominated by the applied PEDOT:PSS electrode and not the ZnO ETL. Furthermore, it has been shown by Benatto et al.48 that a component of the degradation in devices with this architecture is associated with the presence of the PEDOT:PSS electrode, since they were able to significantly improve device stability by applying a silver-nanowire electrode instead of PEDOT:PSS.
In order to understand the mechanisms underpinning the JSC degradation in the AZO and ZnO ETL devices, LBIC maps were obtained of AZO and ZnO devices in their degraded states (Fig. 7). Overall, there is no sign of degradation caused by water or oxygen ingress from the edges of the degraded devices as both still appear to have well-defined square shapes. However, the degraded AZO device reveals that current degradation occurs in the form of a series of circular structures (Fig. 7A) whereas no such features are present in the LBIC images of the degraded ZnO device (Fig. 7B). The presence of these circular degradation features is entirely consistent with the nucleation of degradation at the large pinhole sites observed in the SEM images of the as-prepared AZO layers (Fig. 5C), which are not present in the ZnO layer (Fig. 5D). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that there is no visible change (discolouration or photo bleaching) in the active layer of OPV devices with either AZO (Fig. 7C) or ZnO ETLs (Fig. 7D).

Conclusions
We have tested and optimized the thickness of 4 different inorganic electron transport layers (aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO), chromium oxide (CrOX), titanium oxide (TiOX) and zinc oxide (ZnO)) in normal geometry fully roll-to-roll coated/printed organic solar cells. AZO was utilized in three different thicknesses and the optimum thickness was found to be 45 nm with an average of 1.23% whereas device with 30 and 60 nm resulted in efficiencies of 0.75 and 0.98%, respectively. Devices prepared with CrOX produced J–V curves with resistor-like characteristics with very low series resistance. An XPS study of the sputter deposited Cr layer revealed that the surface consisted of Cr(III) in a 1:1.1 ratio between Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3, consistent with the characterisation of other chromium-based buffer layers. The failure of this material was therefore attributed to penetration of the conducting chromium through the active layer during sputtering deposition. The TiOX devices efficiency was relatively invariant with layer thickness, exhibiting a maximum of 0.46% at 19 nm, however, TiOX was deemed to be unsuitable as ETL for large scale R2R production with our current layer-stack and ink formulation as the devices' efficiency decreased significantly after both encapsulation and annealing, most likely due to a decrease in the absolute thickness of TiOX either as a consequence of mechanical stress or diffusion. ZnO devices were prepared with six different thicknesses of ZnO ranging from 10–80 nm. A maximum efficiency of 2.20% was found at 30 nm ZnO increasing from 0.44% and 1.56% at 80 and 10 nm, respectively. Lifetime studies of the optimized devices also showed ZnO devices as the most favourable as they decreased to ∼50% of their initial efficiency whereas AZO decreases to ∼35%, these losses stem primarily from losses in JSC. Light beam induced current maps of freshly prepared and degraded devices with AZO and ZnO showed that the reduction in current did not stem from ingress of water or oxygen through the edge of the device as active area was still a well-defined shape after degradation. Instead, it appears that degradation nucleates at point defects in the ETL in the AZO.
In summary, the most promising ETL used in this study was therefore found to be ZnO as these devices exhibit both the highest initial PCE and the longest lifetime.
