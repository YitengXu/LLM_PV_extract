The TNW array is desirable for the PSC, since it can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photo-generated electrons. The Ti foil substrate has many advantages such as flexibility, low sheet resistance, and excellent mechanical stability. The sunlight illuminates through the highly transparent poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film on the indium doped tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrate. The transparent PEDOT electrode can be used as the hole transporting layer (HTL) due to the well matched band positions for charge separation and transport. As a result, the Ti foil based light-weight PSC with TNW arrays yields an efficiency of 13.07% with an active area of 1.00 cm2, which is higher than that of the PSC with TNPs (9.93%). These promising results highlight the potential application of the PEDOT and Ti foil in cost-effective, large-area, and flexible PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much interest as promising light harvesters for highly efficient photovoltaic devices in the past few years, due to their clean, low cost, high efficiency, good durability, and easy fabrication.1–9 In a typical PSC, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass is usually employed as a working electrode substrate to meet the requirement of preparing a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron collection layer at high temperature (about 450 °C).10 However, the heavy-weight and rigid glass substrate means a low-cost manufacturing process (such as roll-to-roll processing11) is not possible. Therefore, fabrication of TiO2 anodes on light-weight and flexible conductive substrates (such as polymer substrates and metal foils) has been investigated to realize a high-speed and low-cost manufacturing process of PSC modules.12 Usually the polymer substrate cannot be heated up to 150 °C, thus preparation of the PSC on it requires different approaches. There are some methods to fabricate the TiO2 (electron collection and transport layer) on the polymer substrate: (1) low-temperature solution-processed method,12–14 (2) atomic layer deposition,15 and (3) replaced by other n-type materials (such as PCBM and polythiophene).16,17
Flexible metal foils (such as stainless steel and titanium (Ti) foil) have been widely used to fabricate flexible photovoltaic devices due to theirs flexibility, low sheet resistance, excellent thermal and mechanical stability. Flexible dye-sensitised solar cell based on Ti foil substrate was first demonstrated in 2006 by Ito et al.18 and has garnered considerable attention from large-area solar cells.19,20 Recently, L. Qiu, et al., prepared the PSC into a flexible stainless steel fiber with an energy conversion efficiency of 3.3%.21 J. Troughton, et al., reported an efficiency of 10.3% for a flexible, ITO-free PSC using 150 mm thick Ti foil as a working electrode substrate.22 The non-transparent metal foil in the PSC presents a different requirement to the transparent electrode to allow the backside sunlight illuminated from the transparent electrode side. Usually, the transparent polyaniline and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes have been widely used as the p-type hole transporting layers (HTLs) in the bifacial solar cells.23–25
Moreover, many efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of TiO2 with particular structures to improve the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 anode.26–28 The titanium dioxide nanowire (TNW) anode can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photo-generated electrons, which can improve the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell device.29,30 Here we devised a Ti foil based light-weight PSC with TNW arrays and the sunlight illuminated through the highly transparent PEDOT film on the indium doped tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrate. Fig. 1 shows the device schematic diagram and energy level diagram of the light-weight PSC. The light-weight PSC yielded an average efficiency of 13.07%.

Experimental
Materials
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (HF), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), lithium pechlorate (LiClO4), lead iodide (PbI2), hydroiodic acid (45 wt% in water), methylamine (30% in methanol), methanol, ether, and acetonitrile were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Agent Ltd., China (Analysis purity grade). γ-Butyrolactone (>99.9%), ferrocene (>99.9%), and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin. 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene monomer (EDOT) was purchased from Aldrich, USA. The above agents were used without further purification. Ti foil (>99.98%, 0.05 mm thickness) was purchased from Baoji Yunjie Metal Production Co., Ltd. China.
Preparation of the light-weight anode
Typically, the TNW arrays were prepared on the flexible Ti foil to obtain the light-weight anode according to our reported procedure.30 Firstly, Ti foil (1.0 cm × 2.5 cm) was cleaned in HF solution with a concentration of 0.03 mM for 2 min and rinsed in distilled water. Then the cleaned Ti foil was placed into Teflon-lined autoclave. Secondly, the autoclave was filled with 6 M NaOH solution (packing volume < 80%) and sealed into a stainless tank. Then the system was heated at 160 °C for 3 h. Thirdly, the obtained product was washed with HCl aqueous solution (pH = 2) and distilled water carefully until the pH value of the water equaled to 7. Finally, the product was sintered at 400 °C in air for 0.5 h.
Synthesis of the perovskite sensitizer solutions
The CH3NH3I was synthesized by a typical preparation procedure,31,32 then the as-synthesized CH3NH3I powder (0.395 g) was mixed with PbI2 (1.157 g) in γ-butyrolactone (3, 2, and 1 mL, respectively) at 60 °C for 12 h with stirring to obtain the three different concentrations of CH3NH3PbI3/γ-butyrolactone solutions.
Electropolymerization of the PEDOT electrode
Before the plating, the flexible ITO/PEN substrates (12 ± 1 Ω sq−1, Peccell, Japan) were cleaned with acetone and distilled water, respectively. The PEDOT was electrodeposited on the ITO/PEN substrate (1.0 cm × 2.5 cm) by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement from an aqueous solution containing 10 mM SDS, 10 mM LiClO4, and 2.0 mM EDOT under a three-electrode cell with a computer-controlled Autolab potentiostat (Type III) at ambient atmosphere.19 The potential range was −0.1 V and 1.2 V for 15 cycles at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 for the PEDOT electropolymerization. Finally, the product was drying at 80 °C in a vacuum drying oven.
Fabrication of the solar cell
Two binder clips were used to assemble the PSC with the as-prepared light-weight TNW arrays based anode and PEDOT electrode in a sandwich-like architecture under an open system without any sealing (shown in the left side of Fig. 1). Then the three concentrations of CH3NH3PbI3/γ-butyrolactone solutions were respectively injected into the PSCs from the gap between the two electrodes, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The three PSCs were described as the PSC-b, PSC-c, and PSC-d, respectively. For comparison, the PSC based on the TiO2 nanoparticles on the light-weight and flexible Ti foil was also prepared and named as the PSC-a. TiO2 nanoparticle (TNP) slurry was prepared according to our previous reports,19,33 and then coated on the Ti foil (cleaned by distilled water and acetone to retain the passive oxide film of TiO2 as the dense blocking TiO2 (DB-TiO2)) by the spin-coating method at 500 rpm for 10 s then at 6000 rpm for 30 s, then heat-treated at 400 °C for 0.5 h.
Characterizations and measurements
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the PEDOT was recorded on an Infrared Spectrometric Analyzer (BRUKER TENSOR 27) using KBr as pellets. The phase identification of the TNW, CH3NH3PbI3 and TNW-CH3NH3PbI3 was conducted with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, BRUKER D8-ADVANCE). The surface morphology of the sample was observed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-JSM-6701F) operating at 10 kV. UV-Vis transmittance and absorption spectra of the samples were performed with an Agilent 8453 UV-Vis diode array spectrophotometer. The perovskite film was prepared on the bare ITO/PEN substrate for the UV-Vis transmittance and absorption measurement, and for the following CV test. CV test was carried out on a computer-controlled Autolab potentiostat (Type III) in a solution of TBAPF6 (0.1 M) in anhydrous acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s at room temperature under argon protection. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. As a reference electrode (RE), a silver wire coated with AgCl was used. After each measurement, the RE was calibrated with ferrocene. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PSC was performed using a CHI660D (Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) electrochemical measurement system at a constant temperature of 20 °C in ambient atmosphere under dark condition, and the impedance data covered a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz with 5 mV of amplitude and 0.9 V bias potential. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the PSC was carried out using a computer-controlled CHI660D from forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) at 0.10 V s−1 in ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was set under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G), and a black mask (1.00 cm2) was used on top of the device to control the active cell area for the light irradiation. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured with a solar cell QE/IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Beijing Zolix Instruments Co. Ltd., China).
Results and discussion
As the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2, the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ of 25.3° for titania anatase (101) crystal face is observed in the pure TNW, and all sharp peaks can be indexed as titania anatase.30 Strong diffraction peaks are observed at approximately 14.3, 20.1, 23.5, 24.5, 28.6, 31.8, 35.1, 40.5, and 43.3°, respectively corresponding to the reflections from (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), and (314) crystal planes of the CH3NH3PbI3 structure.7,10,32,33 Fig. S1† proves that the PEDOT thin film was successfully electropolymerized on the transparent ITO/PEN substrate by using the CV method.19,34 The C–S bond stretching in the thiophene ring is found at 691 and 982 cm−1. The vibrations at 1092, 1143 and 1204 cm−1 are possibility owing to C–O–C bond stretching in the ethylene dioxy group. The vibrations at 1339 and 1518 cm−1 can be attributed to the C–C and CC stretching of the quinoidal structure of the thiophene ring.

Fig. 3a demonstrates three-dimensional interpenetrating network TNWs were successfully prepared on the Ti foil substrate through a facile hydrothermal approach. Fig. 3b–d represent the top-view SEM images of TNW arrays filled with three contents of CH3NH3PbI3/γ-butyrolactone solutions on the Ti foil substrates. The CH3NH3PbI3 could be well filled and contacted with the TNW arrays, and more CH3NH3PbI3 was filled in the TNW arrays with the increase of its concentration. However, there is some break revealed in the perovskite film when the CH3NH3PbI3 concentration is too high (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3e and f show the cross-sectional SEM images of the pure TNW arrays and TNW arrays filled with CH3NH3PbI3 in 2 mL γ-butyrolactone. It can be seen that the TNW array grows tightly on the Ti foil substrate with a thickness of about 1000 nm, even though it has been went through a cutting process to prepare the SEM sample, and CH3NH3PbI3 can be filled into the TNW arrays with a depth of 450 nm. Fig. S2† presents that TNPs film is released easily from the Ti foil after the cutting process, suggesting the TNPs are not contacted strongly with the Ti foil substrate, and the CH3NH3PbI3 only covers on the TNPs film. Fig. S3† shows that the PEDOT film on the ITO/PEN substrate is homogeneous. After injected the perovskite sensitizer, the PEDOT film was covered with the CH3NH3PbI3.

Fig. 4 shows the UV-Vis transmittance spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3, PEDOT, and PEDOT-CH3NH3PbI3 on the ITO/PEN substrates, respectively. The CH3NH3PbI3 film has a low transmittance at around 470–770 nm and transmits weakly below 570 nm.1,35 The transmittance at around 525–625 nm is observed for the PEDOT, which is assigned to π–π* electronic transition of the PEDOT.36 Overall, the transmittance of the thin PEDOT film is quite high in the visible region. Thus, it can be considered as a visibly transparent electrode. Additionally, the curve of the PEDOT-CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits superposed transmittance characteristics of the PEDOT and CH3NH3PbI3 film. The broad absorption window overlapping with the maximum irradiance of the solar spectrum ensures efficient photon harvesting, which may eventually lead to a high photocurrent.

The optical band gap energy (Eg) of each material was calculated by using the equation of Eg = 1240/λ, in which the λ value was measured by the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S4†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were estimated from the oxidation potential (Eox) by using the empirical formulas of HOMO = −(Eox + 4.80 − Eox(ferrocene)), in which the Eox and Eox(ferrocene) values were measured by the cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S5†), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were calculated according to the equation of LUMO = HOMO + Eg.33 The results were listed in Table 1. Fig. 1 (the right side) shows the energy level diagram of the TNW, CH3NH3PbI3, and PEDOT, respectively, where all the band positions are well matched for the charge separation and directional transport. In the photoelectric conversion process, the sunlight illuminates through the highly transparent PEDOT electrode, the CH3NH3PbI3 absorbs the photon at its interface, then charge separation occurs at the interface and quickly transfers to the conductive band (CB) of the semiconductor TNW arrays, finally forms the photo-current by the external circuit. In this structure, the TNW arrays can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photo-generated electrons. Moreover, the LUMO level of the PEDOT is higher than that of the CH3NH3PbI3, which can lead to a single directional pathway for the photon-generated electron transport to reduce the electron recombining to the PEDOT.

The internal resistance of the photovoltaic device is usually characterized by EIS, as shown in Fig. 5a, and the equivalent circuit of this model (inset of Fig. 5a) has been already reported.7,10,32,33,37 In which the RS refers to the ohmic series resistance, the RCT(PEDOT) and RCT(TNW) are the charge-transfer resistance at the PEDOT/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/TNW interface, the YCPE(PEDOT) and YCPE(TNW) refer to the constant phase elements. The resultant impedance spectra were fitted using the Z-view software and shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the RS, RCT(TNW), and RCT(PEDOT) values of the TNW arrays based PSCs (PSC-b, PSC-c, and PSC-d) are observably lower than those of the TiO2 nanoparticles based PSC (PSC-a), owing to that the TNW arrays have more excellent electron transport ability than that of the TiO2 nanoparticles, which can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photo-generated electrons. And these values of the TNW arrays based PSCs are gradually reduced by injecting more CH3NH3PbI3 into the device, owing to the high carrier mobility of the CH3NH3PbI3 were filled up in both the TNW and PEDOT films. However, an excess of CH3NH3PbI3 in the device brings about some break in the perovskite film, which could result in a disadvantage of the electron transport. The lowest RS, RCT(TNW), and RCT(PEDOT) values of the PSC-c are 13.15, 54.25, and 24.22 Ω cm2, respectively. The lower resistances could result in a more effective and rapid transporting ability for the electron and hole, which would further improve the performance of the PSC especially the fill factor.

The photovoltaic properties of light-weight PSCs were measured using a computer-controlled CHI660D from forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) at 0.10 V s−1 under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) from the PEDOT electrode side (Fig. 5b), and the average results were summarized in Table 3. The short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) values of the light-weight PSC-c are observably enhanced by introducing the TNW arrays into the solar cell and employing moderate amounts of CH3NH3PbI3. The light-weight PSC-a based on TiO2 nanoparticles yields an efficiency of 9.93%. However, the light-weight PSC-c with TNW arrays yields an increased efficiency of 13.07%. The enhanced JSC might be owing to the high specific surface area of the TNW arrays and enough CH3NH3PbI3 to increase the utilization of sunlight. The increased VOC might be due to the array structure of the TNW to provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photo-generated electrons. The FF value of the PSC-c is enhanced by employing the TNW arrays, attributing to the decreased values of the RS, RCT(TNW), and RCT(PEDOT).

Fig. 6 shows more photovoltaic performances based on the best device of PSC-c. Fig. 6a provides the statistics distribution on the reproducibility of the PSC-c efficiencies. The average efficiency is about 13.07% scanned from forward bias to short circuit at 0.10 V s−1. IPCE curve shows a wide light response across the whole visible spectrum (Fig. 6b), and the integrated current density from the IPCE is about 20.19 mA cm−2, which is lower than that of the measured value of 21.72 mA cm−2. This is due to that there is some mismatch between the simulated sunlight and AM 1.5G standard. The hysteresis behavior is universally present in the solar cell when the current–voltage curve is diminished at low scanning rate.38 Fig. 6c shows the PSC-c yielded efficiencies of 13.07% and 7.27% based on the scanning directions from forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) and from short circuit to forward bias (SC-FB), respectively. The average efficiency is about 10.17% from the two current–voltage curves. Because of the device was measured under an open system without any sealing in ambient atmosphere, decreasing values of the JSC, VOC, and η are observed in Fig. 6d under total scan time 400 s. However, 83.75%, 94.15%, and 78.81% of the initial values of the JSC, VOC, and η are retained after scanning 400 s taking no account of the change of the fill factor.

Conclusions
In summary, the TNW arrays were introduced as the electron collection layer for the light-weight PSC, which provided direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photo-generated electrons, resulting in a low resistances to enhance the PSC performance. The CH3NH3PbI3 could be well filled with a depth of 450 nm into the TNW arrays. The highly transparent PEDOT acted as the HTL due to well matched band positions for the charge separation. The low-cost and light-weight PSC based on the TNW arrays yielded an efficiency of 13.07% with an active area of 1.00 cm2. The present work suggests that the Ti foil and PEDOT show a great potential as a cost-effective substrate and HTL for the large-area, light-weight and flexible photovoltaic device.
