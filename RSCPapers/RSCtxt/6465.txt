However, in this work, an unusual particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition of ZrN has been observed for the counter electrode of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). If the primary crystal particle size of ZrN is 37 nm, it plays a promoting role for PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes, leading to a remarkable increase in DSSC power conversion efficiency. In contrast, when its primary crystal particle size is decreased to 21 nm, ZrN becomes a serious poison for PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes. This finding would be important for the development of highly efficient DSSC counter electrodes.1. IntroductionSolar energy is one of the most promising energy resources due to its unlimited energy supply. The direct conversion of sunlight into electric power via solar cells has attracted significant attention. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are the third generation solar cells due to their low-cost, easy fabrication, and relatively high conversion efficiency.1–4 DSSCs typically consist of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film as the photoanode, an electrolyte with a redox couple in the liquid or solid state, and a counter electrode (CE).5–13As an important component of DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) collects electrons from the external circuit and catalyzes the reduction of the redox electrolyte (such as I3−/I−). The standard counter electrode material used in DSSCs is platinum (Pt) due to its high conductivity for electron transfer and excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I−. However, its practical application is limited by its high cost and rare source. For this reason, various materials have been investigated to develop Pt-free counter electrodes for DSSCs, including conducting polymers,14−16 carbon allotropes,10,13a,17–20 metal sulfides,21–25 metal carbides,26,27 metal phosphides,28,29 metal nitrides,30–42 and metal oxides.43In 1988, Jonas et al. synthesized an electronically conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and demonstrated its high room temperature conductivity and remarkable stability.44–47 Yohannes and his co-workers showed that PEDOT can catalyze the reduction of I3− to I− in an organic solar cell.48 Furthermore, it was found that the combination of PEDOT with PSS resulted in a water-soluble polymer system (PEDOT:PSS) with good catalytic activity and high charge conductivity as well as excellent stability.47,49,50 Therefore, PEDOT:PSS is being considered as the promising candidate to replace the Pt counter electrode for DSSCs.50–54 However, DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes exhibited lower cell efficiencies than Pt-based DSSCs.55,56 To enhance the performance of DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes, the incorporation of PEDOT:PSS with other materials have been exploited to increase the film surface area, conductivity and/or catalytic activity.51–54,57–62So far, only two metal nitrides (TiN and MoN) have been investigated as DSSC counter electrode materials.30–42 Lee et al. showed that the introduction of 3 wt% TiN to a poly(vinylidenefluorideco-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) counter electrode increased the power conversion efficiency from 4.15% to 5.33%.38 Yeh et al. prepared efficient DSSC counter electrodes by combining TiN nanoparticles (TiN-NPs) with PEDOT:PSS, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 6.67%.39 Furthermore, Li et al. reported that the optimized TiN-conductive carbon black (CCB)/Ti counter electrode could provide a high efficiency.40 Those impressive results indicate that TiN is an efficient promoter for DSSC counter electrodes. In addition, highly ordered TiN nanotube arrays could be exploited as an independent counter electrode material without conductive polymer and carbon for DSSCs.36 Song et al. evaluated the combination of MoN nanoparticles with carbon nanotubes as a DSSC counter electrode, which exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 6.74%.41Zirconium nitride (ZrN) possesses unique physical properties, such as low electrical resistance, extreme hardness, high melting point, remarkable corrosion resistance, and low-temperature superconductivity.63–66 Those properties make ZrN promising for many potential applications. So far, however, ZrN has not been explored for DSSCs. The electrical conductivity of ZrN at room temperature is 1.98 × 106 Ω−1 cm−1,67 which is much higher than that (about 300 Ω−1 cm−1) of PEDOT.47 This can allow us to have a hypothesis: ZrN would be an efficient electrical promoter to accelerate electron transport in PEDOT-based counter electrodes, leading to the enhancement of DSSC photovoltaic performance. In this work, experiments and DFT calculations are carried out to test this hypothesis. An unusual particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition has been observed, which would be important for developing highly efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs.2. Experiment2.1 Preparation of counter electrodes2.1.1 PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) aqueous solution (PEDOT:PSS,PH500, 2.6 wt% dispersion in water), which was purchased from Aldrich, was deposited on a clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plate to form a film by the doctor blading method, followed by heating at 80 °C for 4 hours.2.1.2 ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes. Zirconium nitride powder was obtained from Aldrich and its particle size was tuned by ball milling for a selected time (5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 5 h, or 10 h). The ZrN samples were subjected to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at a Scintag XDS-2000 powder diffractometer. Crystal particle sizes were calculated from peak widths at half-height using the Debye–Scherrer equation with Gaussian and Cauchy corrections. The ZrN powder was mixed with PEDOT:PSS solution at a selected molar ratio and the obtained mixture was stirred for 5 min to form a homogeneous paste. The mixture paste was deposited on a clean FTO glass plate to form a film by the doctor-blade method, followed by drying at 80 °C for 4 hours.2.2 Preparation of photo electrodesFTO glass plates were ultrasonically washed with water and the conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a 0.4 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. A commercial TiO2 sol (Solaronix, Ti-nanooxide T/SP) was used to form a TiO2 film on a FTO by the doctor-blade method. The TiO2 film was thermally treated in air at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. The obtained TiO2/FTO glass plate was post-treated with the 0.4 mM TiCl4 solvent at 70 °C, followed by heating in air at 500 °C for 30 min. Finally, the obtained film was immersed in a cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)-bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, 0.3 mM in ethanol) dye solution for 24 hours to achieve dye sensitization.2.3 Fabrication and performance evaluation of DSSCsThe sandwich solar cells were assembled using the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode and the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrode (or the PEDOT:PSS counter electrode) with liquid electrolyte (I−/I3− redox) between them. The electrolyte consists of 0.025 M LiI, 0.04 M I2, 0.28 M tert-butyl pyridine (TBP), 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), and 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile/valeronitrile solvent with an 85/15 volume ratio. The effective cell area is 0.5 cm2. The photovoltaic performance of the obtained ZrN-based cells was evaluated by Keithley 2400 under an illumination of AM 1.5 (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Newport).2.4 CharacterizationThe film morphologies of ZrN, PEDOT:PSS, and ZrN/PEDOT:PSS were evaluated using a Hitachi-4700 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out for the crystal structures of ZrN powder and ZrN/PEDT:PSS films using a Scintag XDS-2000 powder diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. Sheet resistances were measured using the four point probe method with a Jandel model RM3 instrument. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of DSSCs were obtained at −0.7 V potential and 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz by a CHI 600D electrochemical workstation. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (EG&G Princeton Applied Research) with a three-electrode system (ZrN/PEDOT:PSS composite as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode) containing acetonitrile solution of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4.2.5 Calculation methodsAs the least expensive ab initio approaches, the Hartree–Fock (HF) and the density functional theory (DFT) methods are widely exploited for various calculations. Furthermore, a major improvement over the standard DFT can be achieved by combining the HF and DFT methods, leading to the so-called self-consistent hybrid (SCH) approaches. One of the hybrid DFT approaches is B3LYP, which is a combination of HF with a DFT based on the Becke three-parameter exchange coupled with the Lee–Yang–Parr (LYP) correlation potential.68 So far, B3LYP hybrid DFT has been widely used for the energy and structure calculations of various molecules and clusters.69–75 For this reason, in this work, we employed the B3LYP method with the 3–21 g basis set to perform geometry optimizations and energy calculations for (1) I− adsorption on ZrN and PEDOT and (2) the interaction between ZrN and PEDOT. The cubic unit of ZrN and the monomer of PEDOT were employed as cluster models for calculations. All calculations are carried out using the Gaussian 03 program.76 Furthermore, the interaction energy (Eint) between A and B can be defined as follows: Eint = (EA + EB) − EAB(1)where EA, EB, and EAB, which can be obtained from the above B3LYP hybrid DFT calculations, are energies of A, B, and the AB complex.3. Results and discussion3.1 Promoting effect of ZrN on the PEDOT counter electrodeTo reveal the promoting effect of ZrN on the PEDOT counter electrode, photovoltaic performances of DSSCs with counter electrodes of ZrN, PEDOT:PSS, and ZrN/PEDOT:PSS composites were evaluated using photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, one can see that the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) of a DSSC with a PEDOT counter electrode were 10.7 mA cm−2, 0.73 V, 0.443, and 3.46%, respectively, whereas a DSSC with a ZrN (crystal nanoparticles of 37 nm) counter electrode exhibited a negligible power conversion (0.09%). When PEDOT was combined with ZrN as a composite counter electrode for DSSCs, a remarkable enhancement in photovoltaic performance was obtained. As ZrN content in the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrode increased, the enhancement of power conversion efficiency increased to the maximum value (6.68%) and then deceased. This clearly demonstrates that ZrN can play a promoter role in a PEDOT counter electrode. The optimum molar ratio of ZrN to PEDOT (monomer base) for the best photovoltaic performance is 27. Furthermore, the short-circuit current density (JSC) had a similar ZrN-content-dependence as the power conversion efficiency (η), whereas the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the fill factor (FF) of the DSSC remained almost unchanged with increasing ZrN content. This indicates that the enhancement of η for the DSSC with a ZrN/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrode is mainly due to the increase of JSC.

Because ZrN possesses an excellent electrical conductivity,67 its poor performance as an independent counter electrode indicates its low catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I−. As an ionic material, ZrN would be able to activate I3− easily. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to propose that the low catalytic activity of ZrN would be due to its strong adsorption of produced I−, leading to very difficult desorption and thus inhibiting the adsorption of reactants (I3−). To prove this, adsorptions of I− on ZrN and PEDOT were evaluated by hybrid B3LYP DFT calculations. The geometry optimization showed that I− was adsorbed on a Zr site of ZrN with the formation of a Zr–I bond, while adsorption of I− on PEDOT resulted in two I–H bonds (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the interaction energy is 70.7 kcal mol−1 for I−–ZrN and 15.0 kcal mol−1 for I−–PEDOT. This confirms that ZrN has a very strong interaction with I−, leading to very difficult desorption of I− from ZrN and thus deactivating its catalytic ability. Therefore, the promoting effect of ZrN on PEDOT would be due to its electrical conductivity. This is consistent with the fact that ZrN has a much higher electrical conductivity (1.98 × 106 Ω−1 cm−1) than PEDOT (about 300 Ω−1 cm−1).47,67 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, one can see that ZrN and PEDOT has a strong interaction (40.8 kcal mol−1) via two C–Zr bonds, which are 2.2946 and 2.2220 Å long, respectively. The formation of the chemical bonds between ZrN and PEDOT can eliminate the contact resistance between them. As a result, the introduction of ZrN into a PEDOT electrode would increase its electric conductivity, accelerating the transportation of electrons. Indeed, as shown in Table 2, the sheet resistance of the ZrN/PEDOT film, which is about 10 times lower than that of PEDOT, decreased with increasing ZrN content.

The EIS spectra of DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS/ZrN counter electrodes were obtained at 100 mW cm−2 and frequency from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and a bias DC voltage of −0.7 V. As shown in Fig. 4, one can see Nyquist plots of DSSCs fabricated with various CEs, in which two semicircles are observed in the higher and lower frequency regions. The experimental EIS curves were fitted by equivalent circuit model with Z-view software and are summarized in Table 1. The high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs), while the low-frequency semicircle corresponds to charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface. As the content of ZrN varied in the ZrN/PEDOT counter electrode, Rs remained almost unchanged. This indicates that Rs exhibited a negligible effect on photovoltaic performance. In contrast, the value of Rct decreased from 96 to 80 Ω with the increase in the molar ratio of ZrN/PEDOT from 0 to 27 and then increased. This happened because Rct is dependent not only on the electrical conductivity of a counter electrode, but also on its catalytic activity. As ZrN content increased in the ZrN/PEDOT counter electrode, the electrical conductivity of the electrode increased and its catalytic activity decreased due to the excellent conductivity and the poor catalytic performance of ZrN. The optimum combination of electrical conductivity and catalytic activity, which corresponds to a ZrN/PEDOT molar ratio of 27 in the electrode, created the lowest Rct, leading to the largest short-circuit currency and the highest power conversion efficiency. This was further supported by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 5). The counter electrode of a DSSC can be evaluated by the peak current density and the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) of I−-to-I3− oxidation (Aox) and I3−-to-I− reduction (Ared) peaks, namely, the higher the peak current density and the lower the Epp value, the better the electrocatalytic performance is.77 As shown in Fig. 5, a ZrN counter electrode did not show effective catalytic activity, whereas a PEDOT:PSS electrode exhibited typical oxidation and reduction characteristics for the I−/I3− redox couple. Furthermore, one can see a larger current density (2.135 mA cm−2) and a smaller Epp (0.457 V) for the PEDOT:PSS/ZrN composite electrode, confirming the promoting effect of ZrN on the PEDOT electrode. Fig. 4  EIS (under dark conditions) of the DSSCs with ZrN; PEDOT:PSS; ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes (molar ratio of ZrN/PEDOT is marked in the figure).  Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of electrodes: (a) ZrN, (b) PEDOT:PSS, and (c) ZrN/PEDOT:PSS (molar ratio of ZrN/PEDOT = 27/1). 3.2 Particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition of ZrN in PEDOT counter electrodesTo evaluate the effect of ZrN crystal particle sizes on ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes, ZrN powder was ball-milled. The sizes of primary crystal particles were calculated from XRD peak widths at half-height using the Debye–Scherrer equation for ZrN with and without ball-milling and are listed in Table 3. The primary particle size of ZrN decreased from 36.9 nm to 26.0, 23.9, 21.1, 17.7, and 9.4 nm after ball-milling for 10, 30, 60, 300, and 600 min, respectively. Furthermore, photovoltaic performances of DSSCs with ZrN/PEDOT:PSS composite counter electrodes, in which ZrN was previously ball-milled, were evaluated with photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Table 3, one can see that the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs with ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes decreased with decreasing ZrN crystal particle sizes. Furthermore, when the particle size of ZrN decreased to 21.1 nm, the energy conversion efficiency decreased to 1.56%, which is even lower than that (3.46%) of a DSSC with a pure PEDOT:PSS counter electrode. This indicates that ZrN became a poison for the PEDOT:PSS counter electrode when its particle size was decreased to 21.1 nm or smaller. This would be the first observation for particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition in DSSCs. Such an unusual transition can be explained as follows: the decrease of ZrN particle size can increase its dispersion in PEDOT and thus reduce the contact between the reactant (I3−) and PEDOT, leading to the decrease in catalytic activity. This is supported by SEM images. As shown in Fig. 6, one can see that smaller particles of ZrN with ball-milling had a much higher dispersion in PEDOT than the larger particles of ZrN without ball-milling (it would be noted that the particle sizes in SEM images are much larger than the corresponding ones from XRD calculations, because the sizes from XRD are for primary crystal particles, but the SEM images are generated from the secondary particles composed of the primary ones). Furthermore, as ZrN particle size decreased, the sheet resistance of the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS film increased (Table 3). This could also make a contribution to the reduction of the power conversion efficiency. XRD patterns showed that the combination of amorphous PEDOT with crystal ZrN caused no change for the face centered (FCC) crystalline structure of ZrN (Fig. 7). However, the crystallinity of ZrN, which corresponds to X-ray diffraction intensity, decreased with decreasing particle size (Fig. 8). This happened because the ball-milling could easily generate a variety of crystal defects such as dislocations, vacancies, and the increased number of grain boundaries.78 It was demonstrated that the decrease in crystallinity can reduce electrical conductivity.79 Therefore, the decreased crystallinity of ZrN due to particle size change would be a responsibility for the increase in sheet resistance of ZrN/PEDOT films.

Fig. 8  XRD patterns of ZrN with ball-milling for (a) 10 min, (b) 30 min, (c) 60 min, (d) 300 min, and (e) 600 min. The size effect of ZrN particles on the PEDOT:PSS counter electrode was also evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the obtained EIS spectra of DSSCs with PEDOT:PSS/ZrN counter electrodes were fitted by an equivalent circuit (shown as an inset in Fig. 9) to obtain the series resistance (Rs) of the cell and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface, which are listed in Table 3. As the crystal particle size of ZrN decreased in the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrode, the series resistance (Rs) remained almost unchanged, indicating that the effect of Rs on photovoltaic performance can be neglected. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) remarkably increased with decreasing ZrN particle size (Table 3). This happened because the decrease in ZrN crystal particle size resulted in the reduction of both the electrical conductivity and the catalytic activity of the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrode. This was further supported by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. As the size of ZrN crystal particles decreased, the current density of the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS electrode decreased and the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) of Aox and Ared peaks increased (Fig. 10).

ConclusionIn conclusion, because of its excellent electrical conductivity, ZrN can be an efficient promoter for PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes in DSSCs, leading to a remarkable increase in the power conversion efficiency from 3.46 to 6.68%. However, the promoting effect of ZrN is strongly dependent on its content. As the content of ZrN in the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS increased, the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC increased to the maximum value (6.68%) and then decreased. The optimum ZrN/PEDOT molar ratio for the best performance is 27. Furthermore, an unusual particle-size-induced promoter-to-poison transition of ZrN was observed. When the crystal particle size of ZrN was 37 nm, it played as a promoting role for DSSC PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes. In contrast, if its crystal particle size was decreased to 21 nm, ZrN became a poison for PEDOT:PSS counter electrodes. This happened because the decrease in crystal particle size of ZrN can reduce both the electrical conductivity and the catalytic activity of the ZrN/PEDOT:PSS counter electrode.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF-CBET-0931587) and the ACS Petroleum Research Fund (PRF-51799-ND10).
