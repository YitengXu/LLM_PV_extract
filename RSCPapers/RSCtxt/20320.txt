    , Accepted 17th December 2012First published on 17th December 2012AbstractFirst-row transition metal oxides (TMOs) are inexpensive potential alternative materials for solar energy conversion devices. However, some TMOs, such as manganese(II) oxide, have band gaps that are too large for efficiently absorbing solar energy. Other TMOs, such as iron(II) oxide, have conduction and valence band edges with the same orbital character that may lead to unfavorably high electron–hole recombination rates. Another limitation of iron(II) oxide is that the calculated valence band edge is not positioned well for oxidizing water. We predict that key properties, including band gaps, band edge positions, and possibly electron–hole recombination rates, may be improved by alloying TMOs that have different band alignments. A new metric, the band gap center offset, is introduced for simple screening of potential parent materials. The concept is illustrated by calculating the electronic structure of binary oxide alloys that contain manganese, nickel, iron, zinc, and/or magnesium, within density functional theory (DFT)+U and hybrid DFT theories. We conclude that alloys of iron(II) oxide are worth evaluating further as solar energy conversion materials.
I Introduction
Decreasing fossil fuel reserves are stimulating the development of alternative energy resources to meet our global energy demand.1 A clean and abundant energy source is solar energy. However, converting solar energy to electricity or fuel remains either inefficient or expensive.2 An expensive purification procedure is usually required to fabricate defect-free photon-absorbing materials, such as single crystal silicon solar cells.3 Less expensive semiconductor materials such as organic solar cells tend to suffer from low conversion efficiencies.4 The discovery and development of alternative materials that are both inexpensive to manufacture and capable of efficiently converting solar energy to electricity or fuel is essential to our future.
The efficiency of a solar energy conversion device depends on the success of each step responsible for its operation. The first step in the mechanism of solar energy conversion involves the optical “band gap” property, defined as the minimum photon energy required to excite an electron from the valence band maximum (VBM) to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Photons with energies below the magnitude of the band gap cannot be absorbed and will be lost by optical reflection or transmission. Without these photons, the solar cell produces less current (“short-circuit current”).5 On the other hand, photons with energies much larger than the band gap will lose the excess energy as heat rather than provide additional power; the solar cell generates less voltage (“open-circuit voltage”).6 Therefore the value of the band gap needs to be optimized.7
The second step in the solar energy conversion mechanism is charge transport. After the electron is excited by absorbing a photon's energy, the electron in the conduction band and the hole left behind in the valence band must separate and move through the material. Otherwise, if the electron recombines with the hole, the energy gained is lost. This charge annihilation may involve spontaneous emission (“radiative recombination”), or may involve energy transfer to electrons or phonons (“nonradiative recombination”). In any case, the electron–hole recombination rate should be lower than the electron and hole separation and motion rates (conductivities).8
The final step is the generation of electricity or fuel. The electron and hole may drift or diffuse through the material and, depending on the device, may generate current (in photovoltaics), participate in surface reactions that generate fuel (in photocatalytic devices), or generate both current and fuel (in photoelectrochemical cells). In the latter two devices, fuel generation is thermodynamically favorable provided that the band edge positions straddle the free energies required for fuel-producing reduction and oxidation reactions; this is a necessary condition for generating fuel from solar energy.9 A practical material for solar energy conversion is therefore challenging to design, because several requirements need to be satisfied simultaneously: the material must have an optimal band gap, low electron–hole recombination rate, optimal band edge positions, and also be inexpensive for large scale deployment.
First-row transition metal oxides (TMOs) are potential alternative materials for solar energy conversion devices. Their major advantage, arising from their abundance and the fact that they are often naturally occurring minerals, is low cost. Another positive feature they possess is low toxicity and therefore less environmental concerns arise related to the manufacturing, use, and disposal of such devices.10
However, TMOs have several problems. First, some of them such as the iron(II) oxide considered here, are thermodynamically unstable at room temperature in bulk form.11 This problem can be overcome by fabricating these TMOs at the nanoscale so that bulk phase diagrams do not apply.12,13 Second, some of the TMOs (e.g., manganese(II) oxide and nickel(II) oxide) have band gaps that are too large for efficiently absorbing solar energy, ∼4 eV,14,15 compared to the ideal band gap of, e.g., ∼1.5 eV for photovoltaics7 and ∼2.0 eV for water-splitting photocatalysts.16 Third, some of the TMOs have conduction and valence band edges with the same character (e.g., in iron(II) oxide, the band edges are both iron-type orbitals).17 An optical excitation in such a material will involve intra-atomic excitation that may accelerate (band-to-band) radiative electron–hole recombination rates due to strong coupling between orbitals residing on the same atom. Fourth, in some cases such as iron(II) oxide, the calculated valence band edge position is above the free energy required for oxidizing water.18 Motivated by these challenges and inspired by the apparent advantage in combining different transition metals in biological systems (e.g., both iron and nickel are present in the active site of hydrogenase, a fuel (hydrogen) producing enzyme),19 here we use theory to test whether some of these inherent limitations can be overcome by alloying TMOs.
Alloying has been observed to modify band gaps in III–V semiconductors,20 in oxides such as Cd1−xCaxO,21 Zn1−xMgxO,22 and (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx),23 and in many other semiconductor alloys.24 The band gap of an alloy depends on the band gaps of the parent materials according to the following empirical relation,24 (1)where the band gap of the alloy, Eg, is expressed as the average of the band gaps of the two pure materials, E1g and E2g, weighted by the alloying fraction x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), with any deviation from the average given by the bowing parameter “b”. A similar relation can also be found theoretically within the virtual-crystal approximation,25 where each site in the alloy is represented by an average (“virtual”) potential of two parent materials.‡ As can be seen in eqn (1), the band gap of the alloy does not always depend linearly on the alloying fraction x (when the bowing parameter “b” is not zero) and therefore may not be just a weighted average of the band gaps of the two pure materials.
Here we will show that TMO alloys generally do not have an average of the band gaps of the two pure materials. Previous studies have usually explained the deviation from the average in terms of the difference in electronegativity or geometry between the two pure materials.26,27 Here we give another explanation for the deviation from the average, based on differences in band alignments of the parent materials, and exploit this deviation to optimize the band gap. At large deviations from the average (when the bowing parameter “b” is positive and large in eqn (1)), the band gap of the alloy can be smaller than the band gap of both parent materials.
The origin of the band gap reduction in (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) was not fully understood until very recently.28 Several explanations had been proposed, including N 2p–Zn 3d hybridization at the VBM. Very recent X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the band alignment determines the band gap reduction in this material.28 We agree with their explanation and propose a new metric for band gap reduction, the band gap center (BGC) offset, the importance of which is revealed in this work by systematically alloying oxides with different band edge positions. The BGC is the energy at the center of the band gap and corresponds to the Fermi level in an undoped, defect-free material. In contrast to the band edges, which require demanding many-body quantum mechanics calculations or careful photoemission spectroscopy measurements, obtaining the BGC is much simpler.18 This BGC offset can be determined a priori either from density functional theory (DFT) type calculations or by work function measurements on the parent materials, to determine which are worth alloying to achieve smaller band gaps.
In this paper, we evaluate whether several key properties affecting solar energy conversion efficiency, including band gap, character of band edge states, and band positions, are improved by alloying several materials including magnesium(II) oxide (MgO), manganese(II) oxide (MnO), iron(II) oxide (FeO), nickel(II) oxide (NiO), and zinc(II) oxide (ZnO). All of these oxides have band gaps that are larger than optimum for solar energy conversion, but FeO has the lowest band gap, suggesting that alloying with FeO may help in reducing their band gaps. Hence we used FeO as a parent material for all alloys considered. In addition, we deliberately chose parent materials that can form solid solutions so that the alloying concentration can be varied greatly without inducing phase transformations.29–32 Section II includes details of how the band gap and the band edge positions are calculated via DFT+U33,34 and hybrid DFT35,36 theories for periodic unit cells of pure and alloyed materials. Results and discussion of the electronic properties of the alloys Fe1−xMgxO, Fe1−xMnxO, Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO are in Section III, and concluding remarks on a new metric for screening solar energy conversion materials are given in Section IV.
II Computational methods and numerical details
This section presents the details of our periodic DFT-based calculations performed on bulk and slab unit cells of pure and alloyed TMOs. The bulk unit cells were used to obtain the band gap and then the slab unit cells were used to determine the band edge positions. In Section 2.1, we give the spin state, the phase structure, the exchange–correlation (XC) functional, and the numerical settings used for the bulk unit cells of the pure materials. In Section 2.2, we provide the corresponding slab unit cell size, the numerical settings, and the scheme used for calculating band edge positions of the pure materials. In Section 2.3, we present Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS)37 bulk unit cells for the alloys. In Section 2.4, we outline the corresponding alloy slab unit cells.
2.1 Bulk calculations for the pure materials
Spin-polarized Kohn-Sham (KS)-DFT, DFT+U, and hybrid DFT calculations were performed with the VASP program.38–40 The calculations were carried out for the rocksalt structure and according to the spin ordering of the pure materials in their ground state. The ground states of MnO, FeO, and NiO are antiferromagnetic whereas ZnO and MgO are nonmagnetic.17 All pure materials have a rocksalt structure in the bulk, except for ZnO, which has a wurtzite structure in the bulk and a rocksalt structure at high pressures and at the nanoscale.41,42 Here we considered consistently the rocksalt phase, as we anticipate usage of these alloys in nanostructured form to harvest the most charge carriers.
Conventional XC density functionals do not properly describe the physical properties of mid-to-late first row TMOs.43 For example, FeO is predicted to be a metal using either the local density approximation (LDA) or the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation XC functionals.43 Similar qualitative failure has been observed for MnO and NiO.43 Therefore, the DFT+U formalism of Dudarev et al.34 was used for periodic calculations of MnO, FeO, and NiO. We use U–J parameters in the DFT+U calculations of 3.5, 3.7, and 3.8 eV for MnO (Mn2+),44 FeO (Fe2+),45 and NiO (Ni2+),46 respectively, calculated by an ab initio scheme.45 ZnO (Zn2+) and MgO (Mg2+) do not include open-shell d or f electrons that suffer most from the self-interaction error that DFT+U theory is designed to ameliorate and therefore are treated simply with DFT (U–J = 0). Various U–J values have been assigned to Zn2+ in the literature;47–49 we found that using a nonzero U–J value (2.0–8.0 eV) within LDA+U does not improve the predicted geometry of rocksalt ZnO and therefore we did not pursue its use. PBE+U fails to predict the observed elongation of FeO along [111],45,50 and because either LDA+U or PBE+U can be used for the rest of the materials since both methods yield results that are in good agreement with experimental ground state properties (transition metal magnetic moment, bulk modulus, lattice constant, character of the band edge states, positions of the d-states relative to the band edges, and the existence of an eigenvalue gap),51,52 the LDA+U method was used for the structural optimization of all materials.
Other numerical settings are described as follows. The bulk unit cells of antiferromagnetic MnO, FeO, and NiO were taken as rhombohedral cells containing four atoms, and the bulk unit cells of the nonmagnetic MgO and ZnO were rhombohedral ones containing two atoms. Projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials representing the frozen core electrons and nuclei of each atom replaced the Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn 1s2s2p3s3p electrons, as well as the Mg 1s2s and O 1s electrons.53,54 The plane wave basis was truncated at a kinetic energy cutoff of 700 eV in all calculations. Gamma-point-centered k-meshes were used for all materials. The k-point grid size was 8 × 8 × 8 for all pure materials. This kinetic energy cutoff for the planewave basis and these k-point grids converge the total energy to within 1 meV per atom for all materials. The Brillouin zone was integrated with the Gaussian smearing method using a smearing width of 0.01 eV (the tetrahedron method was used for projected density of states (PDOS) calculations). Symmetry was not imposed for FeO to allow for rhombohedral distortion. For all other pure materials, the same structures were obtained whether symmetry was imposed or not and therefore for computational efficiency we imposed symmetry. The conjugate gradient method was used to relax the cell volume, cell shape, and ion positions using a stopping criterion of forces on all atoms of <0.03 eV Å−1.
The calculated equilibrium lattice constants of the bulk primitive cells were in reasonable agreement with experimental values (maximum 3% error). The calculated rhombohedral lattice constants for MnO, NiO, ZnO, and MgO were 5.27, 4.97, 2.98, and 2.95 Å, respectively, compared with room temperature measured values of 5.44,55 5.11,56 3.02,57 and 2.98 Å,58 respectively. The underestimation of the lattice constants can be attributed to the usual LDA over-binding in addition to neglecting thermal expansion of the lattice. The calculated rhombohedral lattice constants for FeO are |a| = 5.25, |b| = 5.25, and |c| = 5.33 Å,45 consistent with the high temperature measured value of 5.31 Å.59 The symmetry breaking is likely due to a Jahn–Teller distortion of the d6 Fe(II) octahedral field, which is probably averaged out in real macroscopic samples.
Finally, the Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid XC functional was used to evaluate the band gap,35,36 despite the fact that the eigenvalue gap obtained from a single particle KS equation is not directly comparable to either the optical or photoemission/inverse-photoemission (PES/IPES) experimental band gaps. The PES/IPES gap differs from the optical gap of TMOs by typically less than 0.1 eV (the magnitude of the electron–hole pair binding energy).60,61 Hence, the experimental optical or PES/IPES gap ideally should be compared to the quasiparticle gap calculated from a many-body GW approach, which directly yields the PES/IPES gap.
However, here we use the DFT-HSE hybrid functional approach to estimate the band gap, for several reasons. First, the DFT-HSE eigenvalue gap (2.69 eV) of our parent material FeO, which appears in all of the alloys considered, is close to the experimental PES/IPES gap (2.4 eV) and therefore can be used as a rough measure of the true band gap.62 Second, the DFT-HSE eigenvalue gap for FeO differs by <0.2 eV from the DFT-HSE/G0W0 quasiparticle gaps (obtained from a non-self-consistent GW calculation, denoted G0W0, with DFT-HSE wavefunctions and eigenvalues used as input),18,63 so one could argue that it is not worth the expense to add the quasiparticle calculation on top of the already very expensive DFT-HSE calculation. Third, the DFT-HSE eigenvalue gaps of MnO and NiO calculated here, 3.2 and 4.6 eV, are again close to the GW quasiparticle gaps, 3.5 and 4.8 eV, respectively (obtained with the quasiparticle self-consistent GW method).64 Fourth, it has been proven that a pure DFT eigenvalue gap is always a lower limit to the true band gap,65 the error being due to XC density functionals lacking the derivative discontinuity of the XC energy, and that a hybrid functional increases the gap and corrects much of this error.66 Fifth, unfortunately no single type of input for G0W0 accurately predicts the band gap for all of the pure materials we consider here. For example, the DFT-HSE/G0W0 gap of MnO (3.8 eV)18,44 is closer than the LDA+U/G0W0 gap (2.3 eV)67 to the experimental range of band gaps (3.5–4.3 eV),15 however the LDA+U/G0W0 gap of NiO (3.8 eV)67 is closer than the DFT-HSE/G0W0 gap (4.7 eV)63 to the range of measured band gaps (3.6–4.4 eV).14 Sixth, it is well known that hybrid functionals do a better job than conventional XC functionals such as LDA in estimating semiconductor band gaps on the basis of eigenvalue gaps,68 including those of TMOs43 and main group metal oxides. The LDA functional underestimates the band gap of MgO (5.4 eV)69 whereas we find that the HSE functional gives a band gap (6.9 eV) that is closer to experiment (7.8 eV).70 In this case, however, LDA/G0W0 gives a more accurate band gap of 7.3 eV.71 The LDA functional badly underestimates the band gap of rocksalt ZnO (1.1 eV)42 whereas we find that the HSE functional gives a band gap (3.0 eV) that is again closer to experiment (2.5 eV).42 Lastly, the HSE functional has a clear advantage over using DFT+U in the case of MnO and NiO, where the band gap is underestimated by the latter method by at least 0.7 eV.67 Therefore, we settle on a qualitative assessment of band gaps using the HSE functional as a best compromise.
Hence, the HSE XC functional with screening parameter of 0.2 Å−1 was used to estimate band gaps for the structures obtained with LDA+U.35,36 For these band gap calculations, the k-point grid size was 6 × 6 × 6 for MnO and FeO, and 4 × 4 × 4 for NiO, ZnO and MgO. A gamma-point-centered 3 × 3 × 3 and 2 × 2 × 2 q-point mesh was used in the calculation of the Fock potential for MnO and FeO, respectively. There was no reduction of q-points for NiO, ZnO, and MgO. These k-point and q-point meshes converged the DFT-HSE eigenvalue gap to within 0.1 eV.
2.2 Slab calculations for the pure materials
Equilibrium bulk lattice vectors obtained from LDA+U theory were used to construct the (001) rocksalt surfaces of MnO, FeO, NiO, ZnO, and MgO. The (001) surface plane was chosen because of its stability and non-polarity.72–75 The slab models of MnO, FeO, and NiO surfaces were periodic unit cells containing five layers of atoms and 10 Å of vacuum while the slab models of ZnO and MgO surfaces included three layers of atoms and 10 Å of vacuum. These slab and vacuum thicknesses converged the surface energy to within 0.01 J m−2 for MnO and NiO,18 as well as for ZnO and MgO (this work), and to within 0.025 J m−2 for FeO.72 The MnO, FeO and NiO slabs contained eight atoms per layer, while the ZnO and MgO slabs contained four atoms per layer.
After constructing each slab, the LDA+U functional was used to relax all ionic positions to an equilibrium structure. The ion relaxation was stopped when all force components on all ions were less than 0.03 eV Å−1. The same plane wave kinetic energy cutoff was used as for the bulk calculations and k-point meshes largely consistent with those converged for the bulk calculations were used for the surface slabs: gamma-point-centered grids with 4 × 4 × 1 k-points for MnO(001), NiO(001), FeO(001), ZnO(001), and MgO(001).
The slabs were used to calculate band edge positions within LDA+U by a recently proposed scheme.18 Accordingly, the position of the BGC relative to vacuum was determined by taking the energy half way between the KS VBM and CBM eigenvalues of the slab and referencing the BGC to the integrated electrostatic potential in the vacuum region (essentially obtaining the material's work function). The value of the BGC was shown to be independent of choosing either PBE+U or HSE functionals, and because LDA+U performs better than PBE+U in many cases,18 we use LDA+U to specify it. The valence (conduction) band edge was then determined by subtracting (adding) half the DFT-HSE eigenvalue gap of the bulk material. This scheme carries several advantages, including being based on a formally exact theorem, agreeing better with experiment, and being less computationally expensive than conventional approaches (see ref. 18 for more details; in the original work G0W0 quasiparticle gaps were used but since, as noted earlier HSE and HSE/G0W0 yield nearly the same gaps for FeO, we save time by estimating gaps with HSE for all the FeO-based alloys reported here). This scheme was first applied on a few oxide semiconductors18 and was very recently used to calculate band edge positions of several sulfide and selenide semiconductors, yielding results in good agreement with experiments.76
In our previous work,18 the BGC of FeO was calculated using a slab with 16 atoms per layer, whereas here we consider less atoms for fair comparison to the alloy slabs. In addition, we previously used a PAW potential that does not include the 3p electrons in the frozen core. With the PAW potential that does (used here), we obtain a value for the BGC that is higher by <0.04 eV than our previous result. The value of the BGC was found converged to within 0.1 eV compared to thicker slabs, and to within 0.05 eV compared to denser k-meshes.
2.3 Bulk calculations for alloys
The unit cells for alloys of Fe1−xMxO, where M = Mn, Ni, Zn, and Mg, were constructed for three different alloying concentrations, x = 0.25, x = 0.50, and x = 0.75 in the rocksalt structure. All of these alloys are known to exist in the rocksalt phase.29–32 Furthermore, a consistent rocksalt structure for both pure materials and alloys simplifies the analysis.
Alloy SQS unit cells, whose properties mimic those of a material in the limit of a perfectly random alloy, were built using the ATAT code.77 For an alloying fraction of x = 0.5, the code generated 21 16-atom cells that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor interactions and nine cells that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Correlation functions up through next-nearest-neighbor interactions were generated only for the alloying fraction of x = 0.5 as a representative test (vide infra). For an alloying fraction of x = 0.25 (or equivalently x = 0.75), the code generated six 16-atom cells that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor interactions. We selected cells from all those generated according to three criteria. First, antiferromagnetic cells were selected, because this spin ordering appears in the pure TMOs. Second, cells were chosen according to the ability to cleave them for slab calculations with (001) orientation without increasing significantly the number of atoms per cell. Third, cells that can be cleaved to form slabs with no dipole were selected. The final SQS cells chosen appear in the lower part of Fig. 1 and their coordinates are given in Part 1 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 1  DFT-HSE evaluation of the band gap dependence on the alloying fraction x for the alloys Fe1−xMgxO, Fe1−xMnxO, Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO. Unit cells are shown in the lower part of the figure for each alloying fraction. The unit cells for the alloys, at x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, are SQS cells that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor interactions. At an alloying fraction of x = 0.5, two cells are given: the upper (lower) cell corresponds to an SQS cell that mimics random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor (next-nearest-neighbor) interactions. At an alloying fraction of x = 1, the upper cell is used for antiferromagnetic materials and the lower cell is used for non-magnetic materials. 
The ordered bulk cells we considered are rhombohedral 2 × 2 × 2 supercells of the pure TMO's primitive cell (32-atom cells). We only built a few ordered cells at an alloying fraction of x = 0.5, as a representative case. Their ion distributions are given in Part 1 of the ESI.†
The numerical settings were largely consistent with those used for the pure materials. The k-mesh for the SQS cells of x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 was 3 × 5 × 2, while the SQS cell of x = 0.5 that considers next-nearest-neighbor interactions had a k-mesh of 5 × 3 × 2. The k-mesh of the ordered cells was 3 × 3 × 3. Other settings were the same as for the pure materials and taken together, all settings converged the total energies to within 1 meV per atom using the LDA+U functional.
Our study primarily considered the nearest-neighbor-correlation-function-based SQS cells. The importance of considering the next-nearest-neighbor correlations was tested on Fe0.5Mn0.5O and Fe0.5Ni0.5O; we observed less than 2 meV per atom difference in total energies and very similar PDOS compared to the nearest-neighbor SQS cell properties. The ordered cells were tested for Fe0.5Zn0.5O again exhibiting less than 2 meV per atom difference in total energies and very similar PDOS (<0.1 eV difference in LDA+U eigenvalue gaps) compared to the nearest-neighbor SQS cell properties. Hence, we show results primarily for nearest-neighbor SQS cells.
After structural optimization with LDA+U theory, the HSE functional was again used to calculate the DFT-HSE eigenvalue gap. The optimized bulk structures of the alloys were cleaved in subsequent slab calculations as explained below.
2.4 Slab calculations for alloys
The slab models of the alloys were constructed from their bulk unit cells. All slabs contained five atomic layers and 10 Å of vacuum. The SQS cells of x = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor interactions were transformed to cubic cells (by left multiplying the matrix [−3 0 −1; 0 1 0; 1 0 −1] onto the matrix of the cell's vectors, given in units of the transition-metal–oxygen distance: [1 2 −1; −1 0 −1; −3 2 3]), so that they can be cleaved to form an (001) oriented slab. The resulting slabs included eight atoms per layer. A k-point mesh of 5 × 2 × 1 was used for these slabs. The SQS cell of x = 0.5 that mimics random alloy correlation functions up through next-nearest-neighbor interactions was a right cuboid and after cleavage the slab included four atoms per layer. One of the surface lattice vectors of this cell is shorter along the y-axis than twice the corresponding surface lattice vectors of the SQS cells that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor interactions and hence a slightly denser k-mesh of 5 × 3 × 1 was used for this slab. The same slab that was used for the pure TMOs was used for an ordered slab at alloying fraction x = 0.5. The ion distributions are given in Part 2 of the ESI.† A k-mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 was used for this slab, which was found to be sufficient to converge the total energy to our usual threshold.
After constructing the slabs, ion relaxation with the LDA+U functional was stopped when all force components on all ions were less than 0.03 eV Å−1, and finally the BGC for the slabs of the alloys was calculated with LDA+U. As it turns out, the BGC was not terribly sensitive to the degree of order in the alloy. For example, the SQS cell of the Fe0.5Mn0.5O alloy, which mimicked correlations up to next-nearest-neighbors, had a BGC that differed by 0.06 eV from the nearest-neighbor-correlation-based SQS cell. An ordered cell of the Fe0.5Mn0.5O alloy had a BGC value that differed by 0.04 eV from the nearest-neighbor SQS cell. Hence, for the rest of our calculations, we show results only for the nearest-neighbor SQS slab cells (with one exception: due to difficulties in converging the electronic structure of the nearest-neighbor Fe0.5Ni0.5O SQS slab, the BGC of Fe0.5Ni0.5O was instead obtained from the next-nearest-neighbor Fe0.5Ni0.5O SQS slab).
III Results and discussion
The applicability of FeO-based TMO alloys for solar energy conversion is tested in this section by evaluating three key properties: the band gap, the character of the band edge states, and the band edge energy positions. The section ends with a fourth novel property, the BGC position, which we demonstrate to be a promising metric that can be used to select candidate alloys for potential use in solar energy conversion.
The first property, the band gap, is a crucial contributor to determining the efficiency of solar energy absorption. The band gaps of MgO, MnO, NiO, and ZnO are too large for efficient solar energy absorption ( ≥3 eV).78 As can be seen in Fig. 1, the band gaps are successfully reduced upon alloying with FeO. A range of gaps are produced, with the following relation, EHSEg(Fe1−xMgxO) > EHSEg(Fe1−xMnxO) > EHSEg(Fe1−xNixO) > EHSEg(Fe1−xZnxO),(2)where EHSEg denotes a band gap calculated with the hybrid (HSE) XC functional. Unexpectedly, the alloy gaps are not ordered according to the relative magnitude of the pure materials' band gaps. Moreover, some alloy gaps are lower than the gaps of the two parent materials, rather than being an average of them. The band gaps of Fe1−xMgxO alloys are the largest, larger than the gap of pure FeO but lower than the gap of pure MgO (∼7 eV) by more than 3 eV. The band gaps of Fe1−xMnxO alloys are lower than the gap of pure MnO and are near the gap of pure FeO. The gap of Fe1−xNixO at an alloying fraction of x = 0.25 is also similar to that of pure FeO. However, at larger alloying fractions, the gap of Fe1−xNixO is significantly reduced, lower than the gaps of the two pure materials, FeO and NiO. Finally, the Fe1−xZnxO alloys have the lowest gaps, considerably lower than both of its parent materials. Thus, the Fe1−xZnxO and Fe1−xNixO alloys have an advantage over the Fe1−xMgxO and Fe1−xMnxO alloys, because their gaps are lower and closer to the optimal band gap for efficient solar energy conversion.
Some portion of the reduction in the band gap may be an artifact of the computational method, specifically the choice of approximate XC functional. Indeed, the HSE XC functional underestimates the gaps of pure MnO and MgO, and consequently may bias the calculation toward reducing the band gap of their alloys. However, since the gaps of MnO and MgO alloys with FeO are too large anyway, this underestimation only serves to strengthen the conclusion that these alloys are unsuitable. On the other hand, the HSE XC functional overestimates the band gap of pure (rocksalt) ZnO and NiO (and FeO), while their alloy band gaps are nevertheless reduced. This band gap overestimation for these three materials strengthens our conclusion that alloys of FeO with NiO or ZnO may be suitable for solar energy applications. Moreover, the fact that the HSE functional sometimes overestimates gaps indicates that its use is not the primary source of the reduction in band gap.
The second property we consider is the type of states at the band edges (VBM and CBM), which is responsible for determining the electronic and optical properties of the materials. As can be seen in Fig. 2, in all of the alloys, iron d-states appear at the VBM. In contrast to the non-FeO parent oxides, the VBM of the alloys is not dominated by oxygen p-type states. Instead, the oxygen p-states are at the mid-to-lower part of the valence band. The Fe1−xMgxO and Fe1−xMnxO alloys have iron d-states at the CBM as well. Magnesium s-states, which appear at the CBM of pure MgO (too small to be seen in Fig. 2), are further inside the conduction band of the Fe1−xMgxO alloy. Manganese d-states appear at both band edges of pure MnO, but are further inside the bands in the Fe1−xMnxO alloy. Unoccupied iron s-states are spread over the conduction band of all alloys, and in Fe1−xMnxO, manganese s-states span the conduction band as well. Hence, iron states dominate the band edges of Fe1−xMgxO and Fe1−xMnxO, as they do in FeO (i.e., they are Hubbard-type insulators). These materials may therefore be useful as photoelectrodes that preserve the electronic and optical properties of FeO. Moreover, Fe1−xMgxO and Fe1−xMnxO should be of more practical use than FeO, because MgO and MnO are thermodynamically stable at room temperature unlike FeO.11 Preliminary evidence based on total energy differences suggests formation of these alloys may be thermodynamically favorable (see Part 3 of ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Projected densities of states of the alloys (a) Fe1−xMgxO, (b) Fe1−xMnxO, (c) Fe1−xNixO and (d) Fe1−xZnxO, at alloying fractions of x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1. The majority (minority) spin is set to have positive (negative) occupations, for clarity. DFT-HSE band gap values are indicated above the arrows and band edges are emphasized in the gray vertical stripes. 
The character of the band edges of the Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO alloys is influenced by both pure materials, as opposed to the band edges of Fe1−xMgxO and Fe1−xMnxO that have the band edge character of pure FeO alone. As can be seen in Fig. 2 for the Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO alloys, the CBM includes nickel d-states and zinc s-states, as in pure NiO and ZnO, respectively. Nickel d-states are further inside the valence band of the Fe1−xNixO alloy, while they appear at the VBM of pure NiO, together with oxygen p-states. Zinc d-states are at the lower part of the valence band in both the alloy Fe1−xZnxO and in pure ZnO. Iron d-states are also in the upper part of the conduction band. At alloying fractions x = 0.25 and x = 0.50 in the Fe1−xNixO alloy, significant hybridization between iron d-states and nickel d-states occurs at the CBM. Less hybridization of iron states is present at the CBM of Fe1−xZnxO. Unoccupied nickel s-states also span the conduction band of the Fe1−xNixO alloy. Therefore, photon absorption by the Fe1−xNixO (Fe1−xZnxO) alloys will produce holes in iron states at the VBM and electrons in nickel (zinc) type states at the CBM, i.e., the band gap transition involves charge transfer from iron to the alloying metal. The electron–hole recombination rate may be low in such materials, in which the band edges differ in orbital type and location (weak orbital coupling). Hence, Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO alloys could be promising for efficient solar energy absorption and subsequent charge transport because they have both adequate band gaps (∼1.3–2.6 eV) and possibly low electron–hole recombination rates.
We predict that all of these alloys have indirect band gaps. The CBMs are located at the gamma point in most alloys, but the VBMs are not. Since the VBM of FeO is not at the gamma point and the VBMs of the alloys are dominated by iron d-states, then the VBM of the alloys is not at the gamma point as well (the VBM is located at the k-point (0.3,0.4,0) for alloys Fe0.5Mg0.5O and Fe0.75Ni0.25O, at (0.3,0.4,0.5) for Fe0.5Mn0.5O, at (0.3,0,0.5) for Fe0.75Mg0.25O, and at (0,0.4,0.5) for the rest of the alloys, and is on average 0.25 eV higher than the valence band edge at the gamma point). An indirect band gap is not necessarily bad; it is certainly a disadvantage for efficient light absorption but it does inhibit radiative electron–hole pair recombination. After all, the most common photovoltaic material has an indirect band gap, namely silicon.
Another optical aspect is the reflectivity index, which determines what fraction of light is lost to reflection. Based on the known correlation between the reflectivity index and the band gap,79 these alloys may offer a range of optical capabilities that could be exploited for efficiently collecting solar energy (e.g., with anti-reflection coatings).5
The third property, the band edge positions (VBM and CBM), shows that TMO alloys may be useful for producing fuel from solar energy. As seen in Fig. 3, all of the alloys have conduction band edge positions above the free energy for reducing water and carbon dioxide, and therefore could be used as photocatalysts for reduction reactions in a z-scheme.80 However, the VBM of most alloys are above the free energy for the oxidation of water, and are therefore unable to catalyze water oxidation. Notably, the VBM of the Fe1−xNixO alloy at an alloying fraction of x = 0.75 is just lower than the free energy for oxidizing water, and therefore might be usable for water splitting.

Band gap center values are indicated above the dashed lines. 
The fourth property we consider is the BGC position. We observe that alloys with larger differences in BGC positions of the parent materials (normalized by half the difference in the band gaps of the parent materials§) also have smaller band gaps and possibly low electron–hole radiative recombination rates. The contribution of the BGC position in determining the band gap and electron–hole recombination rate, is most significant for the Fe1−xZnxO alloy because its difference in BGC positions is largest (1.4 eV).¶ We now derive an explanation for the BGC influence on the band gap and electron–hole recombination rate, as demonstrated on Fe0.5Zn0.5O.
In the case of Fe0.5Zn0.5O, the band edges of the parent materials are offset one against each other (Fig. 3), EVBM(FeO) > EVBM(ZnO)(3a) ECBM(FeO) > ECBM(ZnO).(3b)Summing the inequalities in eqn (3a) and (3b) and dividing by half gives a relation between the BGCs of the two pure materials, EBGC(FeO) > EBGC(ZnO)(4)Hence, a difference in BGC positions of the pure materials is a metric (and a sufficient condition||) indicating that at least one of the band edges is also offset. When the band edge offset is large, there is little hybridization between the two materials at the band edge, and each of the alloy band edge positions is determined by a different one of the parent materials, i.e., EVBM(Fe0.5Zn0.5O) ≅ EVBM(FeO) and ECBM(Fe0.5Zn0.5O) ≅ ECBM(ZnO) (see Fe0.5Zn0.5O in Fig. 3). Each of the alloy band edges also is associated with orbitals from different atoms, originating from a different one of the parent materials. In such materials that have band edges with different orbital types, the electron–hole recombination rate may be small due to small orbital overlap and hence weak coupling, and the band gap is smaller than the band gap of both parent materials, i.e., Eg(Fe0.5Zn0.5O) ≅ ECBM(ZnO) − EVBM(FeO). Thus, analyzing BGC positions may be useful as a new strategy to obtain materials with lower gaps and recombination rate.
This hypothesis can be tested by measuring the BGCs and band gaps. As an example, we can use the BGC metric to understand the (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) alloy that was previously discovered to be an effective photocatalyst for water splitting.81 The BGCs of GaN and ZnO are offset by 0.8 eV.82 The alloy has a band gap of 2.58 eV (at alloying concentration of x ≅ 0.13), which is smaller than those of both parent materials (3.4 and 3.2 eV for GaN and wurtzite ZnO, respectively) by ∼0.7 eV (ref. 23) and has band edges with different types of orbitals (the VBM is associated with nitrogen-type orbitals at x ≅ 0.13 and at the CBM zinc-type orbitals gradually increase in dominance as the ZnO concentration increases).83 The crystal structure of the pure materials GaN and ZnO are the same and their lattice constants are similar. Hence, the band gap is not reduced because of differences in geometries but rather due to differences in band alignments. This explanation is consistent with very recent X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy measurements on a (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) heterojunction that shows the CBM decreasing with increasing x.28
A similar rationale can be used to explain the reduction in the band gap of a newly proposed photocatalyst Mn1−xZnxO.44 The position of the band edges of ZnO that are calculated here show that there is an offset in the band edges of MnO and ZnO that cause a reduction in the CBM position for the alloy.
V Conclusions
Several TMO alloys are considered in this work as potential photoelectrodes and photocatalysts, including Fe1−xMgxO, Fe1−xMnxO, Fe1−xNixO, and Fe1−xZnxO. The band gap and absolute band edge positions are crucial for determining the efficiency of absorbing and utilizing solar energy and are therefore calculated here with the use of hybrid DFT and DFT+U for all of these oxides. The band gaps of materials with too large a gap for efficient solar energy conversion, such as MnO, NiO, ZnO, and MgO, are shown to be reduced when they are alloyed with FeO. A range of gaps for a variety of materials are obtained, where the alloys Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO exhibit much lower gaps than the gaps of Fe1−xMnxO and Fe1−xMgxO, and where the former are closer to the optimal band gaps for efficient solar energy conversion.
We find that all of the alloys containing FeO may be candidates for the reduction reactions involved in fuel production, but most of them cannot be used for the oxidation of water since their VBM lies above the free energy for oxidizing water. One possible exception is Fe0.25Ni0.75O, with band edges that may be adequate for water splitting.
This work has revealed a design strategy for producing materials with enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency, as a result of reducing the band gap and potentially the radiative electron–hole recombination rate. Reducing the band gap can be achieved through alloying with a material that has a smaller band gap (such as FeO, CoO, etc.). The key concept is that the alloy band gap may be substantially lower than the band gaps of either of the two parent materials when the band gap center positions of the pure materials are significantly different (by at least half the difference in band gaps of the parent materials). Alloying materials that have greatly different band gap center positions may have an additional benefit of reducing electron–hole recombination rate, because of different chemical character at the alloy band edges. Because the absolute position of the band gap center is effectively given by the material's work function, this concept offers a way to screen potential alloys theoretically by calculating the absolute band gap center position of parent materials or experimentally by simply measuring their work functions, and looking for combinations with large differences in work function (or equivalently, BGC). Alloys of such materials may be promising solar energy conversion materials. Of course, we used theory to establish this strategy and further experimental measurements of band gaps and band gap centers (respectively derivable from optical absorption or photoemission/inverse photoemission and from work function measurements) can be used to test our ideas.
We have not considered the effect of vacancy defects in this work. Such defects may promote nonradiative electron–hole recombination, inhibit charge transport, and therefore are not desirable. Pure FeO naturally has a significant concentration of cation vacancies (up to 16%),84 but the other parent materials (MgO, MnO, NiO, and ZnO) are less prone to such vacancies, suggesting that alloying FeO may also help suppress cation vacancy formation. Preliminary calculations suggest this may be so.
We acknowledge that many other properties, e.g., conductivity, could serve to derail the promise of such alloys. However, conductivity of TMOs can be improved via careful doping that avoids trap formation and that does not affect the band gaps/edges. Thus, after identifying the right alloy combination through the band gap center offset idea, the next step is to identify successful dopants to ensure reasonable conductivity of charge carriers.

 	Fig. 1  DFT-HSE evaluation of the band gap dependence on the alloying fraction x for the alloys Fe1−xMgxO, Fe1−xMnxO, Fe1−xNixO and Fe1−xZnxO. Unit cells are shown in the lower part of the figure for each alloying fraction. The unit cells for the alloys, at x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, are SQS cells that mimic random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor interactions. At an alloying fraction of x = 0.5, two cells are given: the upper (lower) cell corresponds to an SQS cell that mimics random alloy correlation functions up through nearest-neighbor (next-nearest-neighbor) interactions. At an alloying fraction of x = 1, the upper cell is used for antiferromagnetic materials and the lower cell is used for non-magnetic materials.
