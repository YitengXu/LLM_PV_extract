    , Accepted 14th July 2017First published on 14th July 2017AbstractRegioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as one of the most commonly used and thoroughly studied homopolymers has been demonstrated to be a promising commercial candidate for large-area, roll-to-roll printed solar cells. In this work, we designed a new low-bandgap electron acceptor material ATT-3 by combining rhodanine and octyl thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate as the electron-deficient part. ATT-3 shows a planar backbone configuration facilitating charge transport and exhibits strong and broad absorption ranging from 300 to 770 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.61 eV. ATT-3 shows a complementary absorption and well-matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels with P3HT. P3HT:ATT-3-based PSCs show a high PCE of 6.26% with a high Voc of 0.927 V and a small energy loss of 0.68 eV, which is comparable to the best value obtained by using an O-IDTBR acceptor.
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages such as mechanical flexibility, lightweight, and large-scale, low-cost device fabrication.1 In recent decades, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on fullerene electron acceptors have progressed dramatically, from 1% to over 10%, by elaborate design of low-bandgap polymer electron donors and device optimization.2 To date, the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, such as the weak light absorption in the visible near-infrared (NIR) region and the limited tunability of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, have become the bottleneck for further promotion of photovoltaic performance.3 As a result, increased efforts have focused on the development of non-fullerene acceptor materials that provide more opportunities for achieving higher performance based on the appropriate selection of electron donor and electron acceptor materials.3,4
Recently, wide-bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer donors have led to high PCEs of over 10% by combining them with low-bandgap D–A small-molecule acceptors. However, the high production cost (as a result of their complicated synthesis) and intrinsic scale-up difficulties may restrict their future practical applications. The regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most commonly used and well-studied homopolymers; it can be produced in quantities of over 1 kg and offers promising applications, such as large-area, roll-to-roll printed solar cells.5 However, despite its excellent charge transport properties, P3HT suffers from intrinsic drawbacks, such as limited visible light absorption (<650 nm) and a relatively high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (∼−5.0 eV). When paired with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), P3HT exhibited a low PCE of ∼4% with a low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼0.6 eV and a small short-circuit current (Jsc) of ∼9 mA cm−2.5a,6
Thus, non-fullerene electron acceptors have been viewed as very promising for achieving high-performance P3HT-based PSCs.7 Ideally, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of non-fullerene acceptors should be kept low to increase sunlight utilization, whereas the LUMO energy level should preferably be sufficiently high under the condition of ensuring an offset between the LUMO energy levels of donor and acceptor materials for efficient exciton dissociation, resulting in a high Voc.8 Normally, for a majority of PSCs, a high Voc is achieved at the expense of low photocurrent.9 Thus, to achieve the best photovoltaic performance with balanced high Voc and Jsc, the energy loss (Eloss), which is defined as Eloss = Eoptg − qVoc, should be reduced as low as possible.10 Although a number of non-fullerene acceptors have been developed to match with P3HT, to our knowledge, there are only eleven non-fullerene PSCs among over 120 examples that can deliver PCEs of over 4%.7i,11 Only one example using a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based electron acceptor, SF(DPPB) can exhibit a PCE of over 4% with a high Voc of 1.14 V and an Eloss below 0.7 eV (Fig. 1), and a PCE of 5.16% was obtained with a conventional device structure.11c Recently, McCulloch et al.11e reported the best P3HT-based non-fullerene binary PSCs by using an O-IDTBR acceptor, delivering a very high PCE of 6.4%, but with a rather large Eloss of 0.91 eV. In our previous work, a non-fullerene acceptor, ATT-1, was developed based on an efficient combination of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine, which delivered a high PCE of up to 10.07% by blending with PTB7-Th.12 From our initial investigations, we found that the combination of ATT-1 and P3HT in BHJ PSCs exhibited a quite low Voc of 0.68 V with a large Eloss of 0.86 V because of the mismatch in LUMO energy levels. We thus expected that higher photovoltaic performance should be achievable by fine-tuning the LUMO energy level of ATT-1. In this work, we developed a new non-fullerene electron acceptor, named ATT-3, by replacing the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine of ATT-1 with a weaker electron-deficient moiety, 3-ethyl-rhodanine. As shown in Fig. 2b, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G** level showed that the backbone of ATT-3 exhibited a nearly planar configuration that could facilitate charge carrier transport by forming intermolecular π–π stacking. Furthermore, large dihedral angles between the peripheral phenyl group and the conjugated backbone could efficiently prevent the excessively strong aggregation. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ATT-3 were −5.12 and −3.17 eV, upshifted by 0.20 and 0.22 eV, respectively, compared with the corresponding values of ATT-1. The BHJ PSCs based on the P3HT donor and ATT-3 acceptor showed a high PCE of 6.26% with Voc = 0.927 V, Jsc = 10.93 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 62%, which are among the highest performance figures ever reported for P3HT-based non-fullerene PSCs. The Eloss of P3HT:ATT-3-based PSCs was low, 0.68 eV, which may provide more opportunities for P3HT-based PSCs to achieve even higher performance through further molecular design and device optimization.

The chemical structure and synthesis route of ATT-3 are depicted in Fig. 2a and Scheme S1,† respectively. ATT-3 was prepared by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between dialdehyde 1 and 3-ethyl-rhodanine in 70% yield and was confirmed by conventional characterization methods. ATT-3 exhibits good solubility (>20 mg mL−1) in chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which are frequently used for PSC fabrication. According to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1†), ATT-3 showed excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss at high temperature (over 370 °C).
A comparison of the photophysical and electrochemical properties of ATT-1 and ATT-3 are presented in Table 1. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of ATT-3 in CF solution and thin films and P3HT in thin films are shown in Fig. 2c. The ATT-3 CF solution exhibits broad and intense light absorption in the range of 500–750 nm with a maximum molar absorption coefficient of 1.16 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 662 nm, which is slightly hypsochromically shifted by 28 nm over ATT-1. The maximum absorption of the ATT-3 solid film was red-shifted by 30 nm to 692 nm, implying the existence of intermolecular π–π interactions. The absorption spectrum of the ATT-3 film was complementary to that of P3HT. The blend film of the P3HT:ATT-3 (1:0.8, w/w) (Fig. S3†) exhibits a broad absorption range from 400 to 800 nm, which is desirable for sunlight collection enhancement. Well-matched frontier orbital energy levels of the electron donor and acceptor are a prerequisite for achieving high PCEs in PSCs because the HOMO or LUMO energy difference provides the driving force for the exciton dissociation and Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. Cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4†) was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of ATT-3, and the energy diagram of P3HT, PC71BM, and ATT-3 is shown in Fig. 2d. According to the onsets of the oxidation and reduction waves, the EHOMO and ELUMO of ATT-3 were determined to be −5.32 and −3.40 eV, respectively; these values are upshifted by 0.18 and 0.23 eV over ATT-1 and are favorable for achieving high Voc. Considering the EHOMO and ELUMO of P3HT (−3.1 and −5.0 eV), ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO between P3HT and ATT-3 are estimated to be 0.30 and 0.32 eV, respectively, which provide sufficient energy offsets for exciton dissociation.

To investigate whether efficient charge dissociation and transfer could occur at the electron donor and acceptor interface, photoluminescence (PL)-quenching experiments were performed. The PL spectra of the pure donor P3HT (excited at 515 nm), acceptor ATT-3 (excited at 690 nm), and their blend film P3HT:ATT-3 (1:0.8, w/w) (excited at 515 nm and 690 nm, respectively) (Fig. 3) clearly indicated that the emissions of P3HT and ATT-3 could be sufficiently quenched in the blend film with over 95% quenching efficiency (calculated by the ratio of the integrated area of the PL spectra between the blend and pristine films) and suggested that efficient charge separation and transfer occurred between P3HT and ATT-3 and both the donor and acceptor may have contributed to the photocurrent generation.
 Fig. 3  PL spectra of P3HT (excited at 515 nm) and ATT-3 (excited at 690 nm) thin films as well as the P3HT:ATT-3 blend film (1:0.8, w/w) excited at 515 and 690 nm, respectively. 
The photovoltaic performance of the non-fullerene acceptor ATT-3 was examined by fabricating BHJ PSCs with a device configuration of ITO/(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al and P3HT as the electron donor. The active layers were spin-coated from the P3HT:ATT-3 CF solution, and the polymer donor (D) and non-fullerene acceptor (A) blend ratio was optimized. Thermal annealing at 130 °C for 10 min was used for further optimization (Fig. S5 and Table S1†). Fig. 4a shows the current–density/voltage (J–V) curves of devices under simulated AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiance. Table 2 summarizes the detailed photovoltaic performance of the devices including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE at different D/A weight ratios. The as-cast PSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1:0.8 showed a poor PCE of 0.07% with a Voc of 0.934 V, Jsc of 0.31 mA cm−2, and FF of 25%. The high Voc mainly comes from the high-lying LUMO energy level of ATT-3. After thermal annealing at 130 °C for 10 min, the photovoltaic performance can be significantly improved and gives a maximum PCE of 6.26% with a Voc of 0.927 V, Jsc of 10.93 mA cm−2, and FF of 62%. Thus, thermal annealing could simultaneously improve the values of Jsc and FF, which may be related to the improved phase separation. The value of 6.26% for the PCE is one of the highest reported values for PSCs based on the P3HT donor and non-fullerene acceptors. Compared with the optimized P3HT:PC71BM-based PSCs (PCE: 4.05%, Voc: 0.624 V, Jsc: 9.33 mA cm−2, and FF: 69%), the P3HT:ATT-3 combination showed superior photovoltaic performance, which could be ascribed to the significantly increased Voc and Jsc values. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the P3HT/ATT-3-based PSCs with different D/A weight ratios and thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 4b. The devices had a broad photocurrent response in the range of 300–800 nm, indicating that each of the components in the blend films contributed to Jsc. The maximum EQE value of the optimized device was 49% at 495 nm, and in the visible light region of 420–740 nm, the EQE was higher than 40%. The Jsc value calculated from the integration of the EQE plots was 10.62 mA cm−2, which matched well with the value obtained from the J–V curves with a small deviation of 3%.

To understand how charge carrier transport affects photovoltaic performance, the bulk charge carrier mobility of the optimized P3HT/ATT-3 blend film was characterized by the space-charge limited current method. The device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ATT-3/MoO3/Al was used to measure the hole mobility and device structure of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:ATT-3/Al that was used for electron mobility measurements. Fig. S6† shows the I–V curves for the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility characterization. For the as-cast blend film, the hole and electron mobility values were measured to be 1.03 × 10−5 and 5.1 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 20.6. After thermal annealing, the hole and electron mobility values of the P3HT:ATT-3 blend film were increased to 4.71 × 10−5 and 0.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 4.9. These results indicated that high and balanced charge carrier mobility values after the thermal-annealing treatment may promote charge transfer and reduce recombination and thus improve the photovoltaic performance with higher Jsc and FF values.
To further investigate the exciton generation and charge collection behavior, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) in the P3HT:ATT-3 optimized device was measured in double logarithmic coordinates (Fig. 4c). The y-axis, Jph, is defined as the difference between the current density under illumination (JL) and dark conditions (JD).13Veff is defined as V0–Vappl, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage. The Jph of the P3HT:ATT-3 device reached saturation (Jsat) at a high Veff value close to 2.5 V, indicating that almost all photogenerated excitons were dissociated and the free charge carriers were effectively collected by the electrodes. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss), defined as Jph/Jsat, was estimated to be 96% for the P3HT:ATT-3 device, meaning an efficient exciton generation and charge collection that contribute to the performance improvement in our fullerene-free PSCs. In addition, light intensity-dependent photocurrent measurements were carried out to investigate the charge recombination behavior of the optimized device.14 The correlation of Jsc and light intensity follows a power law dependence on light intensity, which can be addressed by the formula Jsc ∝ Pα, where α should be equal to 1 when the space charge carrier is negligible. As shown in Fig. 4d, the α value of the P3HT:ATT-3 device was determined to be 0.93, indicating that a relatively weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the optimized PSCs devices. As a result, the efficient exciton dissociation and negligible bimolecular recombination were the reason for the improvement in the thermally annealed PSC devices.
The morphology of the P3HT:ATT-3 blend was further investigated to gain insight into the impact of phase separation on the photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 5, images obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode show the as-cast blend film to be fairly smooth and uniform with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.83 nm. After thermal annealing, the blend film had a rougher surface with a RMS value of 2.16 nm attributed to the enhanced self-aggregation of P3HT and ATT-3. The AFM section curves show that thermal annealing has slightly increased the domain size (Fig. S7†). Thus, the crystallization and phase separation in the blend film can be effectively enhanced by thermal annealing.15 The crystallinity and molecular orientation of pristine and blend films were studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. 6 presents the 2D GIWAXS diffraction patterns and the corresponding intensity profiles in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions. The P3HT neat film presents a (100) lamellar diffraction peak at 0.37 Å−1 (corresponding to a lamellar spacing of 17.0 Å) and a π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.63 Å−1 (3.9 Å), consistent with the previous study.16 The neat ATT-3 film shows a (100) lamellar diffraction peak at 0.33 Å−1 (19.0 Å) in the in-plane direction and a (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.67 Å−1 (3.8 Å) in the out-of-plane direction, indicating a typical face-on orientation. For the as-cast P3HT:ATT-3 blend film, a (100) diffraction peak at 0.37 Å−1 (17.0 Å) is observed in the in-plane direction and a (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.63 Å−1 (3.9 Å) in the out-of-plane direction. The peak positions were the same as for P3HT, indicating that the scattering intensity mainly originated from P3HT. After thermal annealing, three lamellar diffraction peaks along the qz axis at 0.37 Å−1, 0.76 Å−1, and 1.13 Å−1 are observed, corresponding to the (100), (200), and (300) of P3HT in the out-of-plane direction. In addition, the blend film exhibits a stronger (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.67 Å−1 (3.8 Å). Compared with the pristine film, a new (100) diffraction peak at 0.31 Å−1 is present for the thermally annealed film, suggesting that thermal annealing could also enhance the crystallinity of ATT-3 in PSCs and induce clear phase separation. Therefore, the increased crystallinity and face-on dominated stacking in PSCs result in better charge transport and less charge recombination, thus improving the photovoltaic performance.

In conclusion, we have developed a new non-fullerene acceptor, ATT-3, by combining rhodanine and octyl thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate as the electron-deficient part. ATT-3 shows a planar backbone configuration facilitating charge transport and exhibits strong and broad absorption ranging from 300 to 770 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.61 eV. ATT-3 shows complementary absorption and well-matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels with P3HT. P3HT:ATT-3-based PSCs show a high PCE of over 6% with a high Voc of 0.927 V and a small Eloss of 0.68 eV. The PCEs of P3HT:ATT-3-based PSCs are comparable with the best value obtained by using the O-IDTBR acceptor. Furthermore, the small Eloss induced by ATT-3 can provide even more space for improved photovoltaic performance.
