    , Accepted 12th June 2023First published on 29th June 2023AbstractWith the continuous consumption of fossil energy and the destruction of the ecological environment, it is urgent to develop environmentally friendly and renewable energy storage devices. Biomass is more suitable to be used as an active material in energy storage systems than other carbon materials because of its abundance, sustainability, natural pore structure, high safety factor, and low cost. In this review, the source and classification of biomass and the common preparation and modification methods of biomass carbon materials for supercapacitors are summarized, and the factors affecting the electrochemical performance of biomass carbon materials are systematically discussed, such as specific surface area, porosity, activator type, surface functional groups, heteroatom doping, activated carbon-based composites, etc. The latest research progress in the preparation of biomass derived carbon materials for high performance supercapacitors is critically reviewed and summarized. At the same time, several challenges to be solved are analyzed, and the future development trends of biomass carbon materials in energy storage are prospected.
1. Introduction
The excessive consumption of fossil fuels has led to resource shortages and environmental problems. With the development of science and technology and the continuous progress of society, people are aware of the crucial importance of energy storage and utilization in sustainable development. So far, a series of energy conversion and storage devices have been developed, such as solar cells, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and lithium batteries. These devices need not only high specific energy but also high specific power. Among all kinds of energy storage devices, supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors, have attracted extensive attention because of their advantages, such as convenient manufacturing, fast charging and discharging speed, long cycle life, wide operating temperature range, and excellent power density. They are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage devices.1–3 According to different energy storage mechanisms, supercapacitors can be divided into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudo-capacitors (PCs), and hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the three types of supercapacitors.4 Among them, the electric double layer capacitor stores energy through the accumulation of physical charges at the electrode/electrolyte interface; in the pseudo-capacitors also known as Faraday quasi-capacitors, the energy storage is caused by a Faraday reversible oxidation–reduction reaction and electrochemical adsorption/desorption of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface during charging and discharging; in the hybrid supercapacitors, the energy storage mechanism is a combination of those of electric double-layer supercapacitors and pseudo-capacitors.5 One electrode of the hybrid supercapacitors is made of an electric double-layer capacitive electrode material, and the other electrode is made of a pseudo-capacitive electrode material. This combination of asymmetric electrodes makes hybrid supercapacitors have a wider potential window and higher specific capacitance and energy density.6 Due to the above outstanding characteristics, supercapacitors have been successfully applied in many fields, such as electronics industry, computers, electric vehicles, solar and wind power generation, national defence, military, and industrial fields. Electrode materials are the core components of supercapacitors, and their structural characteristics directly determine the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.7,8 Therefore, considering sustainable development, environmental problems, and economic benefits, the preparation of electrode materials should be obtained from renewable resources by simple, low-cost, and environmentally friendly methods.9

At present, carbon materials are the most commonly used electrode materials for supercapacitors. Carbon materials include graphene,10 carbon nanotubes,11 carbon fiber12 and activated carbon,13 of which activated carbon is the dominant material for the production of supercapacitors. Although these carbon nanomaterials (graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, activated carbon, and carbon aerogel) have a good spatial structure and electrochemical properties as electrodes of supercapacitors, their preparation process is complex, the synthesis time is long, the cost is high and there is energy loss. Therefore, it is imperative to design a simple, environmentally friendly, and economical method to prepare carbon materials. In addition to fossil fuels, biomass can be used as a carbon material precursor.9 The carbon materials derived from biomass have many advantages: (1) using biomass with abundant sources, low price, and economic and environmental protection as the precursor to ensure the economic benefits in the production process; (2) physical and chemical properties are stable;14 (3) most biomass materials themselves contain heteroatoms (N, P, S, O, B, etc.), which leads to the formation of biomass derived carbon materials with more active sites and increases the hydrophilicity of the carbon surface, which is conducive to improving the electrochemical performance;15,16 (4) biomass-derived carbon materials usually have a hierarchical porous structure, which provides favourable conditions for the transport of electrolyte ions; (5) any types of functional groups (including oxygen-containing or nitrogen-containing groups) will be formed on their surface.17 Oxygen-containing functional groups can generally improve the wettability between the electrode and electrolyte. The formation of nitrogen-containing functional groups can generate pseudo-capacitance and thus improve the specific capacitance of the material. These advantages make the application of biomass-derived carbon in electrochemical energy storage attract the attention of many researchers. However, the traditional thermochemical conversion method cannot produce carbon materials with a graded porous structure and high electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to modify biomass carbon materials to make up for this defect. The most common and most effective modification method is activation, including physical activation and chemical activation. An activated biomass carbon material not only has abundant porosity but also has a large specific surface area and specific capacitance, which makes it an ideal activated carbon material for supercapacitors.
This review first gives a brief overview of the development of supercapacitors and summarizes the common preparation and modification methods of biomass carbon materials as electrode materials for supercapacitors (Scheme 1). The effects of the specific surface area, porosity, activator type, surface functional groups, heteroatom doping, and activated carbon-based composites are discussed. In addition, several problems to be solved are also analysed, and the future development trend of biomass carbon materials in this field is prospected.

2. Biomass sources and classification
Biomass refers to materials or by-products from animals and plants that can serve as a potential energy source. It consists of carbohydrates, lignin, starch, proteins, and lipids, which vary depending on geography and origin. Biomass is a natural and abundant renewable energy, including energy crops, crops and their residues, wood and wood waste, municipal and animal waste, aquatic plants and algae.18 However, these biomaterials can fall into four broad categories, namely plant-based, agricultural residue-based biomass, algal-based and animal-based biomass.19
2.1 Plant-based biomass
Generally, plants or plant-based biomass usually involves lignocellulose. It is mainly composed of carbohydrate polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.20 Other examples include aloe vera, leaves, petals, balsa, etc. The main advantage of plant-based biomass is being abundant, biodegradable and non-toxic.
2.2 Agricultural residue-based biomass
Many agricultural plant residues are produced worldwide every year, but these residues are not fully utilized. The most common agricultural residue is rice husk, and other agricultural residues include sugarcane (such as bagasse), coconut shell, straw and peanut shell.
2.3 Algal-based biomass
Algae biomass refers to aquatic microorganisms and aquatic plants mainly existing in the ocean. Because of its sustainable and renewable biomass properties, it has become a potential candidate for biochar production.21 The algae raw material has natural inherent nitrogen, so it is beneficial to prepare carbon materials from algae because of its inherent heteroatom functional groups. However, different types of algae have different cell structures, protein and carbohydrates, so different types of algae biomass composed of different chemical elements should be considered when preparing biochar-based materials.
2.4 Animal-based biomass
Animal-based biomass materials are usually carbonized by animal skins or metabolites. Most of these materials are the parts of animals that can be shed and regenerated or cannot be used. Usually, the epidermis of animals is mainly composed of protein, water, lipids, inorganic salts, and carbohydrates. The elements such as N, P and S contained in animal tissues can promote the electrochemical properties of materials to some extent after carbonization.22,23
3. Common preparation methods of biomass carbon materials
At present, the common and mature methods for preparing biomass carbon materials include a high-temperature carbonization method, hydrothermal carbonization method, template method, and activation method. The template method includes the hard template method and soft template method, and the activation method includes the physical activation method and chemical activation method. These preparation methods and research status are summarized below.
3.1 High temperature carbonization
High temperature carbonization, also known as pyrolysis and direct carbonization, is the most commonly used method to prepare biomass carbon materials. Generally, under the protection of a nitrogen or argon atmosphere, biomass undergoes thermochemical degradation, and removal of organic compounds and non-carbon substances to obtain porous carbon. When preparing biomass carbon materials through high temperature carbonization, the temperature is typically controlled at 400 °C to 1000 °C. The pyrolysis temperature of different biomass is different. During the experiment, the main factors affecting the morphology and performance of carbon materials are the carbonization temperature and time, heating rate, inert gas flow rate, etc., among which the carbonization temperature has the greatest impact on the product performance. With the increase of carbonization temperature, the organic matter in the biomass is removed more thoroughly and the graphitization degree is higher, but the yield of the prepared product will decrease at the same time. If the carbonization temperature is too high, the structure of the prepared product will be disordered, and the pore structure of the carbon material will collapse, and the pores will be blocked, and the specific surface area of the carbon material will be greatly reduced. Using carrot (Fig. 2) as a precursor, Liu24 prepared a three-dimensional porous carbon film electrode (CDCM) for supercapacitors through freeze-drying and high-temperature carbonization. The specific capacitance of the prepared electrode material is 196 F g−1 when the current density is 0.2 A g−1, and the capacitance retention is 90% after 2000 cycles of testing. The CDCM electrode in supercapacitors can provide an energy density of 13.3 W h kg−1 when the power density is 70.0 W kg−1, which exceeds those recently reported for biomass-derived carbon-based materials in supercapacitors.

3.2 Hydrothermal carbonization
Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a common method for preparing carbon materials. In essence, it is a method that can replace high temperature carbonization by using water or other solvents as media to convert biomass into functionalized carbon materials under relatively mild and low temperature conditions. This method has broad application potential and prospects.25,26 The hydrothermal preparation of carbon materials has many advantages, such as simple and convenient operation, mild reaction conditions, less energy consumption, no pollution to the environment, and controllable morphology of the prepared carbon materials. However, this method also has some disadvantages, such as a low specific surface area, underdeveloped pore structure, and low graphitization degree of the prepared product, which hinders its development in practical applications.27 In addition, porous carbon materials can be prepared by adding heteroatoms or combining with other activation methods in hydrothermal reactions. Zequine28 used jute as a raw material to synthesize a carbonized jute active material by the hydrothermal method and further improved the electrochemical performance of the material through chemical activation. The results showed that the jute-derived carbon electrode provided a specific capacitance of 408 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 and had high power and energy density. In another report, Yu29 combined hydrothermal carbonization and chemical activation to synthesize highly porous carbon (WB-HPC) with an ultra-high specific surface area (3151 m2 g−1) honeycomb texture from waste bagasse (Fig. 3d–g). This was higher than that reported in previous literature, thanks to its well-developed pores and hierarchical porous structure. In addition, the prepared carbon electrode has high specific capacitance (413 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent cycle stability, and ultra-high energy density (22.3 W h kg−1) and power density (220.9 W kg−1).

3.3 Template method
The template method is a method that selects the material with a special pore structure as a template, makes it grow directionally by introducing the precursor, and regulates the microscopic morphology and spatial structure of the product. It is divided into the hard template method and soft template method.25,30–32
The hard template method is to first synthesize template materials with porous channels, and then obtain carbon materials with specific structures (nanorods, nanofibers, nanospheres, porous carbon materials, etc.) according to the size and structure of the template so as to achieve accurate modulation of the morphological structure and size of carbon materials.33 Commonly used hard templates include zeolites, mesoporous silica, gypsum, MgO, etc.30 The advantage of this method is that the pore size distribution of the prepared carbon material is uniform, and the structure is controllable and stable, but the disadvantage is that the required template material needs to be prepared, the process is complex, and the template needs to be discarded later, the production cost is high, and it is not environmentally friendly. Cao et al.34 mixed L-arginine and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and then freeze-dried, high-temperature calcined, and acid-washed to prepare the SiO2 template. Then, the bean sprout stem (BS) solution was mixed with the acidified SiO2 template and carbonized at high temperature. Finally, the SiO2 template was removed during annealing to prepare a BS porous carbon material with a high specific capacitance of 203.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4).

The soft template method uses amphiphilic molecules or block copolymers as templates to self-assemble with precursor materials to form ordered porous carbon materials. Compared with the hard template method, this method does not require additional preparation of templates, and the removal of templates is more convenient and reduces the production cost; the disadvantage is that the pore structure of the product cannot be precisely controlled, and the prepared carbon material has poor stability.
3.4 Catalytic pyrolysis/graphitization
Biomass pyrolysis technology can effectively convert biomass into biochar. However, the development of biomass pyrolysis has always been limited by the suboptimal properties of products, such as the poor porosity and stability caused by the low graphitization degree of the prepared biochar.35 Liu et al.36 prepared nitrogen self-doped layered graphite biochar (Na-BC900) by catalytic pyrolysis at 900 °C using lotus leaves as the raw material in the presence of a NaCl catalyst. NaCl as a catalyst plays a key role in the preparation of Na-BC900, which not only increases the specific surface area (SSA) of the material, but also improves the graphitized structure and high graphite N content. Xia et al.37 reported that iron salt catalysts were used in the pyrolysis of biomass bamboo. Specifically, the addition of Fe(NO3)3 promotes the cracking of biomass and increases gas production, thereby improving the graphitization degree and microporosity of biochar.
3.5 Microwave assisted pyrolysis
Compared with the traditional high-temperature pyrolysis method and the hydrothermal method, the microwave-assisted pyrolysis method has the characteristics of simplicity, fast heating, non-retardation, and scalability,38 providing a new modification method to prepare biomass carbon materials. Microwaves can penetrate poor heat-conducting materials and store the converted heat in the materials. Through the rotation and round-trip movement of high-frequency internal dipole molecules, it can provide rapid and controllable volumetric heating.39 However, this method will consume a lot of time in the filtration process, which will inevitably wash away the carbon material and affect the yield. Therefore, researchers have developed strategies of combining microwave pyrolysis with other preparation methods to prepare electrode materials with high power densities and energy densities and excellent electrochemical properties. For example, Tang39 synthesized Ni2CoS4/GO electrode materials by combining the microwave heating method and hydrothermal method. When the electrode was tested, the specific capacitance of the electrode was up to 2675.0 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. It is worth mentioning that the energy density of the symmetrical supercapacitor device assembled with this electrode is 59.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 497.6 W kg−1.
3.6 Activation method
The specific surface area and porosity of carbon materials prepared by directly carbonizing biomass are usually very low, and activation is the most effective method to improve the specific surface area and porosity of carbon materials, which usually includes physical activation and chemical activation, as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Classification of activation methods. 

3.6.1 Physical activation method. 
Physical activation usually consists of two steps. Firstly, the biomass material is pyrolyzed to produce biomass carbon (400–850 °C) and then activated by adjusting the gasification temperature (600–1200 °C) using CO2, air, steam or their mixture.40 The essence of the reaction is the oxidation reaction between oxidizing gas and unsaturated carbon atoms in biomass. At high temperature, biomass carbon materials with a high specific area and porosity are prepared by removing ash and easily decomposed components in biomass.41,42 The advantages of this method are less corrosion to the equipment and friendliness to the environment, but the disadvantages are the high reaction temperature required and relatively low porosity and specific surface area of the prepared biomass carbon. Air activation is usually carried out at a relatively low temperature (<500 °C). Mitlin and co-workers43 combined pyrolysis and air activation methods to prepare high-performance carbon electrode materials using eggshell membranes as a precursor to maintain the interconnected porous structure of the eggshell membrane. The specific capacitance in a 1 M KOH electrolyte is 297 F g−1, and the cycle efficiency after 10000 cycles is 97%. Steam activation has attracted widespread attention because of its simple process, convenient operation and environmental protection.44 Theoretically, porous carbon can be activated in the air, on the one hand because it is a combustible, on the other hand, oxygen and carbon undergo redox reaction is a strong exothermic process. The direct use of air to prepare activated carbon may cause the raw material to be over-burned and unable to produce pores normally. Steam can react with carbon to form CO2 or CO, which can then react further with carbon, causing the carbon material to be etched to form pores.45 The reaction of water vapor with carbon requires a lot of heat and is usually carried out at higher temperatures (>750 °C).46 However, if the reaction temperature is too high (<900 °C), it will cause excessive diffusion of steam in carbide particles, making it difficult to enter the pores, which is not conducive to the uniformity of the reaction. Therefore, the relatively low activation temperature facilitates further diffusion of water vapor into the pores, which will lead to more efficient carbide reactions as well as improved reaction uniformity. By steam activation at 800 °C, Mi et al.47 prepared granular microporous carbon with a mesopore to total pore volume ratio (Vmeso/Vtotal) greater than 75% from coconut shell biological waste, with an SSA of 1532 m2 g−1. CO2 is often used as a clean and readily available gas.48 Taer49 used rubber sawdust as the biomass and prepared activated carbon by a CO2 physical activation method. The results showed that the specific surface area of activated carbon particles increased with increasing temperature (700–1000 °C) with a maximum value of 683.63 m2 g−1. Jiang42 reported direct and indirect carbon dioxide activation routes to convert willow branches, a lignocellulose biomass raw material, into graded porous carbon with a main microporous structure. The results showed that the microstructures of activated carbon obtained from direct activation and indirect activation were very similar. The prepared activated carbon electrode showed a specific capacitance of 80.9 and 92.7 F g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical characteristics of biomass carbon prepared by the physical activation method.

3.6.2 Chemical activation method. 
The chemical activation method is to mix biomass precursors or intermediate products with activators in a certain ratio, and then carbonizing them at 400–900 °C under an inert atmosphere (N2 and Ar) to prepare porous carbon. Commonly used activators include KOH,50 NaOH,51 H3PO4 (ref. 52) and ZnCl2.53 The essence of this method is that chemical reagents will etch and dehydrate biomass materials, which will remove part of the carbon atoms in biomass to improve the graphitization degree and specific surface area of carbon materials. Table 2 summarizes some commonly used chemical activators and the characteristics of the prepared biomass carbon.

Compared with the physical activation method, the chemical activation method has the advantages of a short reaction time, controllable reaction, high specific surface area, and porosity of the prepared activated carbon, but also has some defects, such as the corrosive nature of the activator, the subsequent need for acid washing for removal, and the cumbersome steps. The preparation of activated carbon by phosphoric acid activation is a complex physical and chemical process in which carbon materials are gradually transformed into solid carbon with developed pores and a certain pore structure and surface chemical properties under the action of phosphoric acid. The mechanism of action of activated phosphoric acid mainly includes hydrolysis, dehydration and pore formation.84 The activation mechanism of zinc chloride is that zinc chloride is vaporized at high temperature, and then zinc chloride molecules impregnate into the inside of carbon, acting as a skeleton, and carbon polymer is carbonized and deposited on the skeleton. When zinc chloride is washed with acid and water, the carbon becomes a porous structure activated carbon with a large surface.85 According to the study of Luo et al.,86 porous activated carbon from balsa wood ultra-low-density biomass was prepared by one-step phosphoric acid activation at different impregnation ratios. The phosphoric acid activation process can effectively control the surface area and pore size distribution of balsa active materials. The corresponding specific surface area and total pore volume were 1191.65 m2 g−1 and 1.19 cm3 g−1, respectively. Xiao and colleagues synthesized graded porous carbon by activating peanut shells with zinc chloride using simple hydrothermal treatment.87 Electrodes made of this material exhibit a specific capacitance of 340 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with good cycling stability, with capacitance retention rates of up to 95.3% after 10000 cycles. KOH is commonly used as an activator in chemical activation because of its ability to act as an oxidant to produce oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of biomass. In the activation process, KOH first undergoes an oxidation–reduction reaction with the biomass precursor at 400 °C to generate K2CO3, and reaction eqn (1) will occur. When the temperature rises to 700 °C, K2CO3 begins to decompose into K2O and CO2via reaction eqn (2), and at 800 °C disappears from the system. Then, it reacts to produce metal K through eqn (3),88 and the generated CO2 reacts with carbon to produce CO viaeqn (4),89 which will destroy the micropores and produce mesopores. And the potassium-containing compounds are reduced to simple monomeric K above 700 °C in reaction eqn (5). The generated gas (CO2 and H2O) enters the carbon lattice, which in turn produces abundant micropores. 6KOH + 2C → 2K + 3H2 + 2K2CO3(1) K2CO3 → K2O + CO2(2) C + K2O → 2K + CO(3) CO2 + C → 2CO(4) K2CO3 + 2C → 2K + 3CO(5)
Zhang90 prepared activated carbon with a high specific surface area (2221.1 m2 g−1) and mesoporous structure from bamboo by high temperature carbonization and KOH activation. In a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the maximum specific capacitance was 293 F g−1 when the current density was 0.5 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 6a, cicada sloughs were used as a biomass precursor to prepare P and O co-doped biological porous carbon materials for supercapacitors by hydrothermal carbonization and H3PO4 activation.91 Their results showed that the prepared electrode material had a mesoporous/microporous structure with a high specific surface area (1945.1 m2 g−1) and a high O and P co-doping ratio of 18 wt%. Chen92 using carbonization and KOH activation methods to develop derived carbon materials with a honeycomb framework porous structure with micro- and meso-pores from biomass taro peel for supercapacitors. Their research showed that the electrode derived from taro peel had excellent specific capacitance (466 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), high energy density (17.59 to 13.97Wh kg−1) and cycle stability (Fig. 6c–e). In addition, Dhakal75 successfully prepared 3D carbon by carbonization and KOH activation with waste biomass lotus calyx as a precursor. The results showed that the prepared 3D carbon materials (3D-LCAC) assembled into symmetrical devices exhibited high power density and energy density (800 W kg−1 @ 66.8Wh kg−1) in an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonate) imide). More importantly, a single device based on the ionic liquid can supply power to a blue LED lamp for 3 minutes and 40 seconds and run a fan for about 3 minutes at an operable voltage window of 3.2 V (Fig. 6f–g).

4. Factors affecting the electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials
The main factors affecting the electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are the specific surface area, porosity, activator types, surface functional groups, heteroatom doping, etc.
4.1 Specific surface area and porosity
According to the mechanism of electric double layer capacitors, the high specific surface area of carbon materials provides a large electrode/electrolyte interface for ion adsorption, which effectively improves the capacitance.93 In addition, pore size distribution, pore configuration and connectivity affect the movement of ions and electrons in carbon, thus affecting its electrochemical properties. The existence of micropores can provide more active sites, which is conducive to the storage of electrolyte ions. The proportion of mesopores in activated carbon tends to affect the capacitive behavior of activated carbon, mainly because the existence of mesopores can provide fast transport channels for electrolyte ions, to effectively arrange in the electric double layer for electrochemical energy storage and improve the electrochemical performance. Therefore, the reasonable pore size distribution has an important impact on the electrochemical performance of biomass carbon. Largeot94 proposed that in the ionic liquid of ethylmethylimidazole-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (EMI-TFSI), the pore size of a TiC-derived carbon electrode must be adjusted with the accuracy of sub-angstroms, and the capacitance will decrease significantly in the pore which is one angstrom larger or smaller than the ionic size (0.7 nm). This work shows that the pore size that leads to the maximum electric double layer capacitance is very close to the ion size, and both larger and smaller pores will lead to a significant decrease in capacitance. Chmiola95 reported that pores with an average size ranging from 0.6 to 2.25 nm were generated from carbide-derived carbon (CDC), and the electric double layer capacitance in an organic electrolyte was studied. The results showed that using microporous carbon with pores less than 1 nm allowed the volume capacitance to increase from 55 to 80 F cm−3. Liu et al.96 prepared nano-structured microporous carbon and used pore structure analysis for electrochemical measurement in aqueous KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes. The solvated/exposed K+ can pass through the narrow pore entrance of microporous carbon with an average pore size of less than 0.6 nm and form an electric double layer capacitor, while the solvated/exposed SO42− cannot because of its large ion size. However, when the average pore diameter is greater than 0.6 nm, the penetration of SO42− and subsequent hydration of H+ become available (Fig. 7c).

(c) Schematic pore-structure dependence of the supercapacitive performance for AMSs in KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes, modified with permission from ref. 96 Copyright 2022, Elsevier. 
The specific surface area and pore properties of biomass-derived carbon can be adjusted by different synthesis methods. Li 97used garlic sprouts, garlic seedling, onion and scallion stalk with a similar thin-walled tissue and vascular bundle structure as biomass precursors to prepare rich layered porous biomass carbon materials through carbonization and KOH activation. Most impurities were effectively removed by two-step acid washing, which resulted in channels conducive to electrolyte ion transport and provided more active sites. The results showed that the maximum SSA of these four samples can reach 3154 m2 g−1, the micropores with a pore diameter of 0.5–0.7 nm of the prepared activated carbon electrode material (PC) contribute the most to the capacitance, and the mesoporous with a pore diameter of 2–50 nm can efficiently transport electrolyte ions and shorten the diffusion distance of electrolyte ions (Fig. 7a and b).
Generally speaking, the larger the specific surface area, the higher the specific capacitance of the biomass carbon material. This is because the energy storage mechanism of an electric double-layer capacitor uses the specific surface area of activated carbon to form an electric double layer between the electrode and electrolyte thereby storing the energy charge. However, the specific capacitance does not always increase linearly with the increase of the specific surface area, because the high specific surface area is mainly contributed by small-sized micropores. When the size of micropores is smaller than that of electrolyte ions, they cannot increase the capacitance value, and even affect the migration rate of electrolyte ions in the pores of carbon materials. Barbieri98 believed that for double-layer capacitors, the mass specific capacitance will remain stable when the specific surface area of activated carbon reaches 1200 m2 g−1 and will not increase with the increase of the specific surface area. However, the specific surface area of carbon materials can be increased by activation to obtain ideal capacitance. In the activation stage, it participates in the fracture of chemical bonds formed during carbonization or pyrolysis and partial oxidation of carbon, thus effectively forming micropores.96 To sum up, the carbon structure with interconnected pores and optimal pore size is expected to obtain higher packing density and provide sufficient positions and channels for charge storage and rapid ion transport, thus producing excellent electrochemical performance.
4.2 Activator types
In order to explore the effect of different activators on the preparation of high-performance activated carbon, Phakkhawan99 prepared activated carbon electrode materials by chemical activation using sugarcane bagasse as the precursor and HNO3, H2SO4, KOH, and NaOH as activators. The effect of acid and alkali activators on activated carbon materials was explored. The results showed that the activated carbon prepared by KOH activation had the highest specific surface area (1058.53 m2 g−1) and specific capacitance (138.61 F g−1), the largest total specific pore volume, and most developed pore structure. As shown in Table 3, the activated carbon prepared by using an acid activator was far less effective than that activated by an alkaline activator in terms of the specific surface area, specific capacitance, and pore structure. In addition, the electrochemical performance of biocarbon materials after alkali activation was better. Sylla100 used peanut shell waste as the raw material with different concentrations of different porosity enhancers (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) to prepare electrode materials by a two-step method. Table 4 summarizes the electrochemical performance results of carbon materials activated by three different porosity enhancers (mass ratio 4:1). The results showed that the symmetrical device assembled with electrode materials activated by the porosity enhancer KOH (with a mass ratio of 4:1 to carbon material) had the best electrode performance.

4.3 Surface functional groups and heteroatom doping

4.3.1 Surface functional groups. 
The existence of surface functional groups in activated carbon materials has an important impact on the electrochemical performance of the electrode. On the one hand, the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups can improve the wettability of activated carbon materials and weaken the interaction between electrodes and electrolyte surfaces, thus enhancing the diffusion of electrolyte in electrodes and effectively improving the energy storage capacity. On the other hand, the Faraday oxidation–reduction reaction between oxygen-containing functional groups and the electrolyte in the process of electrode charging and discharging produces pseudocapacitance, which improves the specific capacitance of activated carbon electrode materials. Jin15 used dry grains as the biomass precursor to prepare graded carbon electrode materials by KOH activation and HNO3 surface oxidation modification. The results showed that after HNO3 surface oxidation modification, the mass specific capacitance of graded carbon increased by 260 F g−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte, and the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor only decreased by 5% when the current density increased from 100 mA g−1 to 600 mA g−1. The results showed that the comprehensive electrochemical performance of the graded carbon electrode material after HNO3 modified oxidation was significantly improved. Wang et al.101 reported that porous activated carbon with a high oxygen content (HC) was synthesized with heavy components of bituminous coal as raw materials by a new method. The heavy components were pre-treated with HCl–HNO3 mixed solution and acetone solution, and then activated with KOH. After HC was treated with hydrochloric acid (37%) and nitric acid (68%), minerals were largely removed. NO+, NO2 and active oxygen atoms produced by nitric acid decomposition may react with the aromatic structure of coal, causing the degradation of aromatic rings and the increase of carbonyl groups. Then, after acetone was added, the surface carbonyl group was changed into the quinone group under the catalysis of acid. The prepared porous activated carbon shows a high capacitance of 416 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the increase of specific oxygen-containing functional groups on porous carbon, which are formed by the reaction of coal macromolecules with acid/acetone solution.


4.3.2 Heteroatom doping. 
The existence of heteroatoms (N, O, P, S, B, etc.) in biomass carbon materials has a significant impact on the electrochemical performance of double-layer supercapacitors.13 The doping of heteroatoms can not only improve the wettability of electrode materials and generate pseudocapacitance, but also improve the specific capacitance and conductivity of double-layer capacitors.102 The doping forms of atoms include self-doping and artificial doping.103 Self-doping in which heteroatoms (N, O, P, S, B, etc.) are inherently present in the biomass precursor does not need artificial introduction. However, artificial doping requires people to treat biomass carbon materials with amine compounds, phosphoric acid, thiourea, etc., so as to introduce heteroatoms.104,105 For example, Zhou106 used soybean powder as the raw material to prepare N and O self-doped graded porous carbon by mixing it with a KOH activator in different ratios and chemical activation. The results showed that the sample AC-4 with an alkali/carbon ratio of 4:1 has the highest specific surface area (2251 m2 g−1) and the largest mass specific capacitance (248 F g−1) at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Cao107 used Camellia pollen as the raw material and different nitrogen-containing compounds (NH4Cl, (NH4)2CO3 and urea) as activators and dopants to prepare nitrogen-doped biomass-derived graded porous carbon materials by a one-step method. According to their findings, urea had the highest N dopant content (4.60%), and NH4Cl is the best porogen for maintaining the microscopic morphology of pollen grains. In addition, the activated carbon electrode material prepared with urea as the activator and dopant had a maximum specific capacitance of 300 F g−1 when the current density is 1 A g−1 and an excellent rate performance of 50% in the range of 1 to 50 A g−1. Wang108 used CN2H4O and CN2H4S as heteroatom dopants and pore-forming agents to transform the abandoned RCs of rose branches into a 3D hierarchical porous carbon system rich in N, S and O. The material was prepared by hydrothermal doping and activation. The experimental evidence and results of theoretical simulation are analysed to establish the doping principle with predictive electrochemical properties. Doping N, S and O atoms into carbon materials successfully broadens the working voltage of aqueous electrolyte (up to 1.8 V) and improves the prospect of capacitive ion adsorption (Fig. 8a). Zhu et al.109 prepared nitrogen-doped graded porous carbon (N-HPC) from houttuynia cordata. The nitrogen dopant melamine enhances the etching behaviour of the activator, thus promoting the ratio of pyridine nitrogen to pyrrole nitrogen. Theoretical calculation shows that besides pyridine, graphite nitrogen and pyridine-N-oxide, activators are more easily adsorbed on nitrogen-doped carbon surfaces and tend to etch carbon atoms. The nitrogen atoms in N-HPC mainly exist in the form of pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 9.82 W h kg−1 at a power density of 162.33 W kg−1 (Fig. 8b and c). In addition to the work mentioned above, more research on heteroatom-doped AC has been completed and is summarized in Table 5.

4.4 Activated carbon-based composites

4.4.1 Biomass-derived carbon/metal composites. 
In supercapacitors, metal and biocarbon composites show better energy storage efficiency than traditional biocarbon materials. Different transition metals, such as Cu, Ag, Ni, etc., have developed conductive materials with a changeable valence state to obtain higher economic benefits. These materials store charges in a specified working potential window according to physical accumulation and surface oxidation-reduction processes.119 Therefore, EDLCs usually use a porous biochar structure to enhance energy storage capacity. Zhan120 reported a novel Mn/Cu bimetallic decorated biomass porous carbon (AC@MnCu-X) prepared from agricultural wastes (peanut shells) to realize the double-layer capacitance of porous carbon materials and the pseudocapacitance of metal compounds. The obtained samples successfully modified the Mn/Cu nano-strip structure in the carbon matrix. Using AC@MnCu-32 as an electrode material, a high specific capacitance of 632 F g−1 was obtained in a three-electrode system with a current density of 1 A g−1, and excellent cycle life with a 90% capacitance retention rate after 10000 cycles. In addition, the AC@MnCu-X sample was also used as an asymmetric supercapacitor for electrode assembly, and its energy density reached 15.62Wh kg−1 at a power density of 625 W kg−1. Zhang et al.121 studied a synthetic route for growing Ni-MOF in the periphery and channels of walnut shell-derived carbon (WS), which had previously been carbonized by heat treatment in air at 850 °C to produce a highly porous network. The specific capacitance of the obtained WS@Ni-MOF composite can reach 14 times that of biochar at a current density of 1 A g−1, and it shows high cycle stability (the retention rate is 90.4% after 20000 cycles). In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) shows a high energy density of 34.79Wh kg −1 at a power density of 824 W kg−1.


4.4.2 Biomass-derived carbon/metal oxides or hydroxides composites. 
Biomass-based carbon composite transition metal oxides/hydroxides (for example, MnO2, RuO2, NiO, Ni (OH)2, Co (OH)2, etc.) have an important influence on high performance hybrid supercapacitors. The synergistic effect of transition metal oxides/hydroxides and biomass carbon materials can not only produce pseudocapacitance, but also improve the specific capacitance and conductivity of electric double layer capacitors. Yuan122et al. reported nano-hybrid materials (3D-HPCS@MnO2) as electrode materials for supercapacitors (Fig. 9a–d). 3D-HPCS@MnO2 was prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of HPCs derived from chicken bones and electrodeposited MnO2. The prepared 3D-HPCS@MnO2 showed a nano-fold morphology and rich pore structure. Thanks to this 3D porous structure, it provides a high specific area (1627 m2 g−1) and specific capacitance (476.4 F g−1). Owing to these advanced properties, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on HPCS//HPCS@MnO2 exhibits an energy density of 60.8Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 20.7 kW kg−1. In another study, Gao 123studied the synthesis of graded nanosphere double nickel-based composites by a two-step hydrothermal method (Fig. 9e and f). The grand Ni2O4/Ni(OH)2 nanosphere positive electrode benefits from the unique graded structure and the synergistic effect of the built-in electric field, which significantly improves the electron transmission capacity and ion/electron transfer rate. The hybrid supercapacitor composed of the positive electrode material and the pine petals derived carbon (PBC) negative electrode material synthesized by a hydrothermal method displays an energy density of 31.07Wh kg−1 and a power density of 833.47 W kg−1 in a maximum potential window of 1.7 V.

4.4.3 Biomass-derived carbon/metal chalcogenide composites. 
Metal chalcogenides have attracted extensive attention in the field of supercapacitors because of their unique properties. They store charge though fast and reversible Faraday behavior, aiming at obtaining high specific capacitance. In the past few years, different metal chalcogenides have been studies, such as MoS2, MoSe2, CoSe2, etc. Mahajan et al.124 synthesized Bio-C/MoS2 nanoparticles from fruit peels and seeds by a hydrothermal method. Bio-C/MoS2 composites have a very high capacitance of 945 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and an extremely high energy density of over 157.9Wh kg−1 and a high-power density of 8000 W kg−1 are obtained. Yi et al.125 designed a synthesis strategy with diatomite as the template to prepare a nitrogen-doped MoSe2/graphene (N-MoSe2/G) composite with a good pseudo-capacitor potassium ion hybrid capacitor (KIC). The obtained KIC full battery shows high energy/power density (the maximum is (119Wh kg−1/7212 W kg−1), which is better than that of the recently reported KIC peers. Miao126 proposed a simple MOF one-step derivatization and selenization method to obtain CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon skeleton materials (CoSe2/NC). The CoSe2/NC electrode with a special structure has a high capacity of 120.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and an excellent cycle capacity of 8% loss after 10000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor CoSe2/NC-NF//AC shows a maximum energy density of 40.9Wh kg−1 at 980 W kg−1 (Fig. 10).

4.4.4 Biomass-derived carbon/carbon nanomaterial composites. 
Functional carbon nanomaterials derived from biomass (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes and carbon dots) show a hierarchical structure, excellent mechanical strength, chemical stability, and thermal conductivity, which are helpful to enhance electrochemical performance and have been explored to build supercapacitors. Graphene refers to a single-layer graphite sheet with sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. It has a large surface area, high conductivity, and thermal stability, which makes it suitable for the application of supercapacitors. Xu et al.127 successfully synthesized high-performance biomass-based porous carbon/graphene composite aerogels with a new layered porous mixed structure by using nontoxic vitamin C as the reducing agent through chemical self-assembly. As the electrode material of supercapacitors, the composite aerogel prepared not only has good conductivity and a high specific surface area of 893.9 m2 g−1, but also has an ultra-high specific capacitance and rate performance of 176 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nano-sized hollow tubes formed by curling graphite-like planes composed of carbon six-membered rings. The diameter of single-walled carbon nanotubes is 0.8 to 2 nm, while the diameter of multi-walled carbon nanotubes is 5 to 20 nm.128,129 Carbon nanotubes have been widely used in biosensors, drug delivery applications, biomedical imaging fields and supercapacitors.130 Ren131 proposed a relatively simple method, using biologically derived carbon materials from poplar and carbon nanotubes as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The pore volume of the obtained multi-stage porous carbon material reaches 0.86 cm3 g−1 and the specific surface area reaches 1500.5 m2 g−1. The specific capacitance reaches 432.31 F g−1, and the capacitance retention rate is still 95.7% after charging and discharging for 3000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Different from graphene and carbon nanotubes, carbon dots (CQDs) are a quasi-zero dimensional nano-material, which has very high active surface sites, excellent chemical stability, easy solubility in water, and a wide range of functionalization possibilities132 and has attracted considerable interest in the application of high-performance energy storage materials. Quan133 reported a simple strategy to improve the capacitance behavior of porous carbon derived from Camellia oleifera by introducing carbon dots (CQDs) with a high graphitization degree into the skeleton of porous carbon. Thanks to the unique surface properties of CQDs, the obtained CQDs/graded porous carbon composites (CQDs/HPC) have developed porous structures, and their charge/ion transfer kinetics have been improved. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor provided an energy density of 8.61 (17.86) W h kg−1 with a power density of 477 (954) W kg−1 in 1 M H2SO4 (1 M Na2SO4) solution, and the stability of a 94% capacity retention rate after 20000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in the long term.


4.4.5 Biomass-derived carbon/MXene composites. 
The advantages of two-dimensional (2D) MXenes in the structure and electrochemical performance make them occupy an important position in the energy storage industry, especially in supercapacitor systems. MXenes are considered as promising 2D metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides. Good conductivity, rich surface functional groups, adjustable hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties and rich redox active reaction sites give MXenes excellent charge storage capacity. Li et al.134 used four kinds of renewable biomass (wheat straw, Enteromorpha prolifera, pomelo juice, and tribute chrysanthemum) derived hetero-atom-doped CDs as cheap conductive pads, and CDs/MXene self-supporting thin film electrodes with a unique 0D/2D dot-like structure were constructed by Coulomb self-assembly. Due to the synergistic effect of the unique structure and properties of a single component, NSPJCDs/M-5% shows excellent volume capacitance (984.5 F cm−3), volume energy density (19.42 W h L−1), symbolic rate capacity (79.80%) and long-term cycle stability (94.6% retention rate after 10000 cycles).


4.4.6 Biomass-derived carbon/conductive polymer composites. 
Conductive polymers are other commonly used electrode materials for SC applications (e.g., PANI and PPy), which can be used together with biomass-derived carbon to prepare biochar/polymer composite electrodes. Conductive polymers exhibit pseudo-capacitance behavior due to their redox process, which is beneficial to charge storage and discharge. The redox reaction of conductive polymers mainly occurs in the ion transfer between the polymer backbone and electrolyte. In the oxidation step, ions are transferred to the polymer backbone, and in the reduction step, they are released back into the electrolyte solution. These redox reactions cause mechanical stress in the polymer, which limits the number of charge and discharge cycles that can be carried out.135 Zhuo et al.136 used cellulose as the carbon precursor to prepare layered porous carbon aerogels as the carrier of conducting polymer PPy. The layered porous structure can not only make PPy permeate efficiently and distribute evenly in the whole carbon network, but also ensure the rapid transfer of the electrolyte and the high accessibility of PPy. The prepared hybrid battery showed 387.6 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1 in 1.0 M H2SO4) and excellent cycle stability (92.6% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). Lyu137 reported that yeast nitrogen-doped carbon microspheres/polyaniline (YC/polyaniline) composites were synthesized by in situ polymerization using yeast as the carbon source and structural template. Self-template hollow YC with good conductivity has many active sites for anchoring PANI, which reduces the structural damage caused by the PANI redox reaction. Therefore, YC/polyaniline composites as supercapacitor electrodes show high specific capacitance (500 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and good rate performance in the three-electrode system.

5. Conclusion, challenges, and prospects
5.1 Conclusion
In this review, the preparation and modification methods of biomass carbon materials used in supercapacitors are summarized, including physical activation and chemical activation. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods, different kinds of activators, and the effects of activation conditions on the electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are systematically outlined. In addition, the main factors affecting the electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials are discussed. According to the above summarized cases, activated biomass carbon materials can show better electrochemical performance, such as a high specific surface area and specific capacitance, excellent power density and energy density, and excellent cycle stability. At the same time, the biomass carbon material with rich pores and a graded porous structure can improve the specific surface area of the electrode material, which facilitates the transport of electrolyte ions and provides more active sites. Doping heteroatoms (N, O, P, S, B, etc.) or forming surface functional groups in biomass carbon materials will cause redox reversible reactions on the electrode surface to form pseudo-capacitance, thus further improving the specific capacitance of the material.
5.2 Challenges
Although the preparation methods of biomass carbon materials for supercapacitors are relatively mature and the field of modification is developing rapidly, there are still several problems to be solved for the practical application of natural products in energy storage device systems. (1) Precursor selection: knowing the similarities and differences between the original structures and chemical properties of all kinds of biomass is the key, which is helpful to efficiently screen out suitable precursors and prepare high-performance carbon materials. (2) Structural control: there are no appropriate countermeasures to control the spatial structure and surface stability of biomass carbon materials. For example, if the surface area is too large, the material will collapse, hindering the ion transmission of the electrolyte; if the surface area is too small, the active sites will be fewer, which is not conducive to the formation of excellent electrochemical performance. (3) Carbonization and activation: the process of transforming organic matter into inorganic matter during carbonization and the evolution of the carbon material structure caused by the addition of an activator or dopant during activation need further study. In addition, the carbon yield cannot be ignored because the reported biomass carbon materials with excellent electrochemical properties are only prepared in the laboratory, and the improvement of the carbon yield also lays the foundation for large-scale production in the future. (4) Theoretical modelling: at present, a reasonable theoretical model has not been constructed to explain the influence mechanism of capacitance, the interaction between molecules, and the diffusion of ions. (5) High mass-loading electrode: the main problem of a high-quality loaded electrode is the highly hindered kinetics of ion and electron transmission.138 With the increase of mass load, the thickness of the electrode plate increases correspondingly, which leads to a longer distance between mass transfer and charge transfer. Due to the larger area, the charge accumulation per unit area increases, and finally leads to the inefficiency of the charging/discharging process. (6) Environmental protection: although the activated carbon prepared by the chemical activation method has a good effect, a lot of chemical reagents are needed in this process, which leads to cost and environmental problems. Building a green reaction path is an effective solution to the current energy exhaustion.
5.3 Prospects
The post modification of biomass carbon materials has a significant impact on improving the electrochemical performance of the electrode material, and the optimization of modification methods is very important. The preparation of graded porous carbon materials with interconnections is a possible direction for future research. Meanwhile, researchers should explore other new biomass raw materials and better activation methods. In addition, the doping of heteroatoms greatly affects the electrochemical properties of biomass carbon materials, which can be studied in more depth.
At the same time, more novel methods for preparing biomass carbon materials can be explored, such as a more convenient, simple, fast, and green pyrolysis method with a modification method, or a one-step method using iron and potassium complexes as catalysts and activators to produce biomass carbon materials. It is predicted that in the future, with the continuous improvement and development of preparation methods and modification methods, the electrochemical performance of activated carbon electrode materials prepared by using new biomass as the precursor will reach a higher level.
