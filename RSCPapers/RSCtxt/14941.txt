    , Accepted 6th September 2015First published on 8th September 2015AbstractTwo series of Cu2+ and V4+ doped anatase TiO2 samples were prepared using the microemulsion synthetic route by varying the metal/Ti ratio. The samples were characterized by UV-vis absorption, nitrogen physisorption, XRD, XPS, Raman and EPR spectroscopy. Their photocatalytic activity against toluene photo-oxidation was evaluated under both sunlight-type and pure UV light irradiation. The photoactivity was drastically affected by the dopant content. Low or moderate metal doping levels were beneficial for toluene photo-degradation, while high doping levels suppressed the photoactivity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to study the structure and electronic characteristics of the prepared catalysts and elucidate the physicochemical aspects governing the photoactivity. The presence of different Cu and V species was detected as a function of the metal content in the catalyst. EPR spectroscopy revealed that photoinitiated charge formation takes place in both the Cu and V doped TiO2 series and that charge separation may be enhanced depending on the dopant content. A direct correlation between the dopant species formed and hole formation was observed in both series. Photoactivity is directly correlated with the formation of holes, which in turn is tuned by the dopant content regulating the isolated metal centers versus metal cluster formation. Low or moderate doping levels enhanced the separation of photo-produced electron–hole pairs via accepting e−, eliminating trapping sites related to localized Ti3+ states and increasing the abundance of hole species. At higher levels where metal clusters prevailed, dopants acted as recombination centers, deteriorating the photoactivity in both TiO2-doped series. The results indicate a general mechanism potentially applicable to similar photocatalytic systems.
1. Introduction
Photocatalysis using semiconductor nanomaterials is an attractive method for environmental protection and energy conversion since it can be applied under ambient conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure) using solar energy as the energy source.1,2 Among the different photocatalysts presented in the literature, nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) is definitely the most frequently employed due to its inherent properties (non-toxicity, low cost, and high stability).1,2 Many attempts have been made to improve and optimize the properties of TiO2 towards realistic application of heterogeneous photocatalysis. Much effort has been devoted to narrowing the relatively wide band gap of TiO2 (~3.2 eV for anatase), targeting its activation by visible light. Towards this objective, doping with transition metals has been largely employed to decrease the band gap energy or to introduce energy levels inside the band gap.1,3,4
Since the photocatalytic efficiency of titania in organic degradation reactions is usually defined by the available photogenerated charges,2,5,6 efforts have been devoted to extend the lifetime of such centers through the synthesis of either multi-phase materials, composites or metal-doped TiO2.7–17 In the case of doping, in addition to the desired red-shift of the absorption spectrum and in some cases the reported efficient separation of the photogenerated charges, the presence of transition metals has also been related to potential negative impacts such as acting as recombination centers or introducing defective sites in the crystal lattice and increasing the probability of electron/hole (e−/h+) recombination.1,3,18–20 Studies have been performed on charge trapping and recombination21,22 as well as on understanding the factors affecting such processes.23,24 Nevertheless, conflicting results have been presented in the literature regarding TiO2 doped with transition metals. This is related to the complex physicochemical effects originating from the doping process which show the dependence of a significant number of structural/electronic variables, which in turn originate from the preparation method and would ultimately control the performance of the photocatalyst.
Copper and vanadium are among the most used transition metals as TiO2 dopants25–30 since they can lead to significant absorption in the visible region of light. TiO2 nanomaterials loaded with Cu or V have been developed and studied in a variety of photo-initiated reactions30–36 presenting either increased or decreased photoactivity. Mechanistic schemes including the introduction of new energy levels into the band gap of TiO2 and the participation in charge transfer processes such as trapping of photogenerated electrons and holes and O2 reduction have been proposed.31,36,37 Gray and co-workers studied the copper loading effect on the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characteristics of surface-modified rutile TiO2.38 Mixed phase anatase/rutile nanomaterials doped with vanadium presented high activity under visible light irradiation.39 Co-doped materials have been also studied where copper and vanadium were proposed to act as electron scavengers facilitating charge separation.36,40 However, despite the great interest and numerous studies in the literature about transition metal-doped TiO2, very few works report a systematic study and detailed combined analysis of the dopant species present, the photogenerated charge carriers, the direct observation of their trapping sites in the final nanomaterial and their effect on photoactivity. Particularly for the case of Cu2+ and V4+ in anatase-based nanomaterials, such study has never been reported to the best of our knowledge.
The present work outlines the preparation of two series of doped anatase titania using Cu2+ and V4+ prepared by chemical interaction with species derived from the titanium isopropoxide precursor through a microemulsion procedure in an effort to minimize the differences between the samples prepared. Materials with primary particle size and textural properties in a comparable range were developed. The catalysts were evaluated against sunlight and UV-light gas-phase photo-oxidation of toluene and EPR spectroscopy was applied to study both the structure as well as the photogenerated charges in the nanomaterials. Electron and hole pairs generated by light irradiation and trapped in TiO2 were investigated in order to correlate their abundance and stability with the catalytic activity and the catalyst composition linked to the dopant species. The relationship between the structure, the dopant species, the photogenerated charges and the catalytic activity is discussed on the basis of the combined catalytic and spectroscopic study. The two series prepared using different and widely applied transition metals as TiO2 dopants were studied in an effort to validate the consistency of the mechanism proposed herein.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Titania precursor materials were prepared using a microemulsion synthetic route by addition of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Aldrich) to an inverse emulsion containing an aqueous phase (50 ml) dispersed in n-heptane (85/10 v/v vs. H2O; Panreac), with Triton X-100 (variable quantity; Aldrich) as surfactant in 1-hexanol (105/100 v/v vs. surfactant; Aldrich). The metal (Cu2+ or V4+) was introduced from copper nitrate and vanadyl acetylacetonate (Aldrich). The final atomic content of the metal (x%) varied from 0.05 to 1% (stoichiometry: Ti1−0.0xM0.0xOy). The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h, centrifuged, decanted, thoroughly rinsed under stirring with methanol in order to eliminate any portion from the organic and surfactant media, and dried at 110 °C for 24 h. The dried precipitates were calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h using a ramp of 1 °C min−1. A reference material was also synthesized using the same procedure without the presence of the doped metal. Sample labels are T for pure TiO2, and TCux and TVx for Cu- and V-doped TiO2, respectively (where x corresponds to the atomic percentage of the metal).
2.2. Characterization techniques
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity measurements were carried out by N2 adsorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics 2010 instrument. The nitrogen adsorption volume at the relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.98 was used to determine the pore volume and average pore diameter. XRD patterns were recorded in the range 10° < 2θ < 120° using 0.02° steps on a Siemens D-501 diffractometer with a Ni filter and a graphite monochromator with a Cu Kα X-ray source. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy experiments were performed with a Shimadzu UV2100 apparatus with a nominal resolution of ca. 1 nm using BaSO4 as a reference. Band gap analysis was carried out following standard procedures by plotting (hνα)1/2 (hν = excitation energy, α = absorption coefficient) vs. energy.18 Raman spectra were recorded using a Horiba iH320 spectrometer and He:Ne laser excitation (632.8 nm).
XPS data were recorded on 4 × 4 mm2 pellets, 0.5 mm thick, prepared by slightly pressing the powder materials which were outgassed in the prechamber of the instrument at room temperature up to a pressure of <2 × 10−8 Torr to remove chemisorbed water from their surfaces. The SPECS spectrometer main chamber, working at a pressure of <10−9 Torr, was equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 multichannel hemispherical electron analyser equipped with a dual X-ray source working with Al Kα (hν = 1486.2 eV). The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used to correct charging effects.
EPR measurements were carried out with a Bruker ER200D instrument operating in the X-band. All spectra were recorded at 77 K in a double T-type cavity. The frequency of the microwave was calibrated using diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as the standard (with g = 2.0036) located in the second cavity. For outgassing treatments, 60 mg of the Ti sample was placed in a quartz cell and vacuum-treated at pressures down to 2 × 10−5 Torr and room temperature for 1 h. Irradiation treatments were carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) by placing the EPR cell in a quartz Dewar flask, unless otherwise stated. The samples were irradiated with UV light for specific periods using four lamps (Philips TL 6W/08, identical to those used in the catalytic experiments) symmetrically positioned outside the sample. EPR spectra were simulated using the EasySpin software package.41
2.3. Photocatalytic experimental details
The activity for the gas-phase photo-oxidation of toluene was tested in a continuous flow annular photoreactor (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†)42 containing ca. 40 mg of the photocatalyst as a thin layer coating on a Pyrex tube, corresponding to a TiO2 surface density of 0.5 mg cm−2. The corresponding amount of the catalyst was suspended in 1 ml of water, painted on a Pyrex tube (cut-off at ca. 290 nm) and dried at room temperature. The reacting mixture (100 ml min−1) was prepared by injecting toluene (Panreac, spectroscopic grade) into a wet (ca. 75% relative humidity) 20 vol% O2/N2 flow before entering at room temperature to the photoreactor, yielding an organic inlet concentration of ca. 800 ppmv (velocity 1.33 cm s−1). After flowing the mixture for 3–4 h in the dark (control test), the catalyst was irradiated using four lamps symmetrically positioned outside the photoreactor. The photocatalytic tests were performed under a radiation spectrum simulating sunlight (Philips TL 6W/54-765; color rendering index 75; main peaks at 410, 440, 540, and 580 nm; 6 W) as well as under pure UV light irradiation (Philips TL 6W/08; 350 nm; 6 W). The external surface of the catalyst thin film was exposed to irradiance of 12.5 and 8 mW cm−2 under sunlight and pure UV light, respectively. Reaction rates were evaluated under steady-state conditions, typically achieved after 4–5 h from the beginning of irradiation. No change in activity was detected for all samples within 24 h after reaching steady-state conditions. The concentration of the reactants and products was analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent GC 6890) equipped with HP-PLOT-Q/HP-Innowax columns (0.5/0.32 mm I.D. × 30 m) and TCD/FID detectors for quantification of CO2 and organic substances (toluene, photocatalytic products), respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the pure and doped TiO2 samples. Typical spectra of anatase TiO2 are observed. The main Bragg reflections are indexed in the figure according to JCPDS card 21-1272 corresponding to the anatase structure. In both TCux and TVx series, the XRD patterns correspond to a 100% anatase crystal structure since no peaks assigned to other oxide phases were found, suggesting that either the dopant metal ions are incorporated into the TiO2 lattice or Cu and V oxides are very small and dispersed, non-detectable by XRD.43 The cell parameters of anatase are not affected in the case of Cu doping due to the low amount of metal doped and the compensation effect related to defect generation, particularly Ti vacancies, vs. the larger Cu ionic radius.4,47 In the case of V4+, the isoelectronic characters of V and Ti as well as the similar ionic radius (0.58 Å; compared to Ti4+ = 0.605 Å) justify the absence of changes in anatase cell parameters. Anatase crystallinity is not affected significantly by the introduction of the metal. The primary crystal size of anatase as estimated by the Scherrer formula using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense (1 0 1) diffraction peak is approximately 12 nm. Minimal variations in the anatase crystal size were thus observed within the samples of both series (Table 1).

The phase composition of the prepared nanomaterials was further studied by Raman spectroscopy. Representative Raman spectra of the undoped and the Cu- and V-doped TiO2 materials are shown in Fig. 2. The exclusive presence of the anatase phase is evidenced by the peaks at ca. 144, 195, 399, 517 and 639 cm−1, corresponding to the Eg(1), Eg(2), B1g(1), B1g(2), A1g(1) and Eg(3) modes, respectively.18 No crystalline phases of either Cu or V oxide are detected. This is expected for materials with low metal doping levels such as those prepared here. The detection of Cu or V oxides would be expected for dopant concentrations of >1.5%.44 Nevertheless, the Raman results are consistent with those of XRD.
 Fig. 2  Raman spectra of the indicated pure (TiO2) and metal-doped (TCux and TVx) samples. 
The BET surface area, total pore volume, porosity and average pore size of the investigated catalysts are listed in Table 1. First to mention is that most of the samples present textural properties in a comparable range. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the materials are presented in Fig. 3A. All samples exhibited typical features of type IV isotherms with an H2 hysteresis loop, attributed to the development of a mesoporous material.12,45 The surface area is not affected significantly by the presence of the dopant as extracted using the standard BET method.
 Fig. 3  Representative nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (A) and pore size distribution calculated from the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherms using the BJH method (B) of the pure and metal-doped TiO2 nanomaterials. 
The adsorption isotherms were used to determine the pore size distribution by the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. 3B). The presence of mesoporosity with narrow pore size distributions was observed, implying good homogeneity of the pores. In addition, the average pore diameter is not significantly altered within the samples of both series ranging from 5 to 6 nm.
The surface composition and chemical states were further investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the XPS survey spectra, peaks attributed to Ti, O, Cu and V were detected. Fig. 4 presents the representative XPS spectra for the Ti 2p, O 1s, Cu 2p and V 2p core level profiles of the prepared materials. The peaks at approximately 458.6 and 464.3 eV are ascribed to the Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit components characteristic of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 4A).46,47 No obvious differences in the binding energies of the Ti 2p peaks were observed within the samples of both series (i.e. TCux and TVx), indicating that the increase in the dopant concentration does not affect significantly the TiO2. The O 1s peaks (Fig. 4B) were fitted using two symmetric peaks centred at 529.80 and 531.45 eV, attributed to the oxygen lattice ions of the anatase network and surface hydroxyl groups.47,48

Fig. 4C presents the Cu 2p region of the XPS spectra. Typical Cu 2p XPS spectra are observed. The peaks centred approximately at 933.7 and 953.6 eV, ascribed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, accompanied by a satellite peak (clearly observed only for the main Cu 2p3/2 peak due to the low signal-to-noise ratio) located at approximately 941–944.5 eV, indicate the presence of Cu at the +2 oxidation state.49,50 The presence of Cu1+ is expected at lower binding energies.49,51 Cu 2p peaks were only detected in the materials with Cu content higher than 0.5% (Fig. 4C). In the TVx series, a weak peak at approximately 516.7 eV originating from a single contribution was detected only for the sample with a high loading (TV1) attributed to V 2p3/2 at the +4 oxidation state (Fig. 4D).36
Light absorption properties were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy. Starting with the analysis of the band gap (Fig. S2A and B†), we note first that anatase is known to be an indirect band gap semiconductor, although relaxation of energy and momentum rules on the nanoscale may induce a direct band gap character.2,4,52 In any case, the band gap behaviour throughout the series is similar for both cases (e.g. direct and indirect). Table 1 gives the results of the indirect band gap calculation.

Fig. 5 displays the plots used for band gap estimation as well as the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra of the prepared materials (insets). The increase of the absorption at wavelengths lower than 390 nm can be assigned to the intrinsic band gap absorption of pure anatase TiO2. Upon introduction of the metal, a noticeable shift of the absorption spectra towards the visible-light region can be observed, which increased with increasing dopant concentration. By extrapolating the linear portion of (hνα)1/2versus energy, the band gap (Eg) values were estimated (Table 1). The UV-visible information provides evidence that the dopants induce band gap modification (by altering the band structure) even for the lower doping quantity tested here. The trend indicates a decrease of the band gap energy with increasing dopant concentration in the nanomaterial. In addition, absorption in the visible region is also detected in all but the pure TiO2 reference sample. In the case of the TCux series, the intensity of the shoulder at ~440 nm and the absorption at ~700–800 nm increases continuously with increasing dopant concentration. The same is observed for the spectra in the TVx series in the range 450–700 nm. The light absorption in the visible region can be attributed to the d–d transitions of Cu25,53 and V,14,28 similar to that of Fe.18

3.2. EPR characterization

3.2.1. Cu2+-doped TiO2. 
The EPR spectra of the Cu-doped samples recorded in the dark are shown in Fig. 6. Two sets of Cu2+ EPR signals can be observed. The first dominates the low Cu2+ concentration samples presenting well-resolved hyperfine splitting and the second, a broad unstructured signal, dominates the high Cu2+ loaded samples.
 Fig. 6  Normalized EPR spectra of the TCux samples taken in the dark under vacuum (dashed green spectrum: computer simulation of the broad unstructured Cu2+ signal). Left inset: Hyperfine splitting in the parallel Cu2+ spectral region specifying the two distinct Cu2+ species (Cu-I and Cu-II). Right inset: Ti3+ centers formed in the TCu0.05 sample. Experimental conditions: 4 G modulation amplitude, 12.4 mW microwave power. For the TCu1 sample, a 10-fold smaller receiver gain was used due to signal saturation. 
In the low Cu2+-doped nanomaterials (samples TCu0.05 and TCu0.1), the EPR signals are characteristic of paramagnetic Cu2+ (3d9, S = 1/2) ions in an oxygen environment of a distorted octahedral geometry. They are characterized by a set of axial or near axial g-values. A hyperfine structure due to I = 3/2 (multiplicity 4) of the Cu2+ ions can be observed in both the parallel and perpendicular components of the spectra (low and high magnetic field region of the spectra, respectively). Due to the complexity of the experimental spectra, no reasonable computer-simulated spectra could be obtained. Nevertheless, distinct Cu2+ species were detected at the low magnetic field region. Two Cu2+ EPR signals can be clearly observed in the parallel region with g1∥ = 2.435, A1∥ = 75 G and g2∥ = 2.370, A2∥ = 109 G (named Cu-I and Cu-II, respectively, Table 2). They can be attributed to isolated or nearly isolated copper ions and they present similarities in terms of g and A values to Cu2+ species previously reported for copper ions incorporated into an anatase matrix,54 as well as for copper–alumina55,56 and Cu–TiO2–ZrO2 ternary samples.57 The hyperfine splitting of the spectral high-field component reveals the presence of at least two Cu2+ species with A⊥ = 26 and 18 G having approximately the same g-values (g⊥ ~2.09). Comparing the relative intensity of the Cu-I and Cu-II signals, the Cu-II signal is approximately two times smaller in TCu0.1 compared to that in TCu0.05.

The spectral resolution decreases with increasing Cu content. The sample containing 1% Cu2+ is dominated by a broad unstructured signal, extended from 2600 to 3500 G and centered at g ~2.1, while a hyperfine structure similar to the that of the low Cu-loaded samples is partially resolved in the perpendicular region. The increase of the line width and the loss of the hyperfine structure can be assigned to the dipole–dipole interaction occurring between neighboring Cu2+ sites within CuO clusters formed upon increasing the Cu content. These are probably nanoclusters of copper ions not detectable by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. This signal accounts for approximately 70% of the TCu0.5, 20% of the TCu0.1 and less than 3% of the TCu0.05 spectra.
An additional signal at g = 1.93 is also observed in the TCux series. This signal is not present in the pure anatase TiO2 reference sample and is attributed to Ti3+ centers23,31 (Fig. 6, right inset) previously assigned to surface trapping sites,23 most likely formed as charge neutrality species due to the incorporation of Cu2+ into the TiO2 lattice. Comparing the normalized EPR spectra of samples TCu0.05 and TCu0.1, the g = 1.93 signal intensity is almost two times lower in TCu0.1 and it follows the loss of the Cu-II signal. This may suggest that by increasing the Cu content from 0.05 to 0.1%, the portion of Cu2+ incorporated into the anatase lattice is decreased with respect to the total Cu2+ added, resulting in the decrease of the Ti3+ EPR signal with respect to Cu2+. It may also suggest that low Cu loadings favor the incorporation of Cu2+ into the anatase lattice, while for Cu2+ >0.1%, surface Cu species are also present. Alternatively, it may suggest that charge compensation occurs due to different physical phenomena at loadings below/above ca. 0.1%. Nevertheless, the presence of such a signal verified that some of the initial added Cu2+ occupied substitutional cation sites in TiO2. In the normalized spectra in Fig. 6, the Ti3+ signal is not clearly observed in the samples with high loadings because the spectrum is dominated by the Cu2+ signal. The inability to detect Ti3+ species by XPS is most likely due to the low Cu loading (i.e. <0.1%), which is overcome by the high sensitivity of EPR. The high sensitivity of EPR is also evidenced on the Cu2+ (Fig. 6) and V4+ (Fig. 7, see in the following section) EPR signals when compared to the XPS data (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 7  Normalized EPR spectra of the TVx samples in the dark under vacuum. Spectra specification: blue – experimental spectra; green – total simulated spectra; orange – individual simulated spectra (V-I to V-IV). Experimental conditions: 10 G modulation amplitude, 4.9 mW microwave power. 
Overall, the present EPR data verify the isolated nature of the copper species formed in the samples with low metal loading (TCu0.05 and TCu0.1) due to the hyperfine splitting observed in both the parallel and perpendicular components and the formation of Cu clusters upon increasing the Cu concentration. In addition, Ti3+ centers are formed due to the charge imbalance generated as a consequence of dopant introduction into the TiO2 lattice.


3.2.2. V4+-doped TiO2. 

Fig. 7 presents the EPR spectra of the V-TiO2 samples under vacuum and in the dark. In all samples, an eight-component hyperfine structure is observed due to the dipole–dipole interaction of the electronic (S = 1/2) and magnetic moment (I = 7/2, multiplicity 8) of V4+ ions (51V, natural abundance of 99.8%).
Magnetically isolated species, characterized by axial g and A tensors, have been detected. The TV0.05 and TV0.1 spectra present basically the same profile and can be analyzed as a superposition of two different V4+ species, with slightly different principal values (Table 2), suggesting minor differences in the coordination environment (species V-I and V-II). V4+ species presenting similar g and A tensors have been previously attributed to V4+ centers located within the anatase bulk.58 In the TV0.05 sample, the hyperfine structure in the parallel region cannot be clearly resolved due to the low signal intensity.
At higher vanadium concentrations, the interaction between different V4+ ions increases giving rise to a dipolar broadening (see spectrum TV1). This results in an additional broad, unstructured, singlet EPR spectrum centered at g = 1.93 with a line width of approximately 400 G (species V-IV). Similar EPR signals have been previously reported for V-doped anatase TiO2 samples.59–61 Nevertheless, hyperfine splitting due to isolated V4+ species can still be detected. In addition to the two V4+ spectra detected in the low V-loaded samples (TV0.05 and TV0.1), a new V4+ spectrum with g and A principal components g⊥ = 1.971, g‖ = 1.928, A⊥ = 62 G and A‖ = 162 G was detected (species V-III). The contribution of the broad singlet EPR signal is approximately 85% for the TV1 and 39% for the TV0.5 samples (based on double integration analysis of the simulated spectra), attributed to magnetically interacting vanadium species, indicating the formation of oxides. As in the case of the TCux nanomaterials, these are nanoclusters not detectable by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.
Based on the analysis of the giso and Aiso values62 of the three isolated V4+ spectra, the two species (V-I and V-II) detected at low V4+ doping level do not present a pronounced vanadyl character compared to the third species (V-III) detected only for V4+ >0.5%. This indicates that the third species might be located on the surface of the material as surface vanadyl sites. Of importance is to mention that, in contrast to the Cu-doped samples, no EPR signal attributed to Ti3+ was detected for the V-doped materials which can be attributed to the absence of charge imbalance due to the isoelectronic properties of Ti4+ and V4+.
At this point, we highlight the fact that while no difference was observed within the samples containing different amounts of dopants by XRD and Raman spectroscopy and only the nanomaterials with relatively high dopant content could be studied using XPS, EPR provided structural information for both the low and high doped catalysts in the two series.
The structural and electronic effects of Cu and V doping on anatase can thus be summarized as being related to the introduction of the dopant into the anatase matrix, and the formation of isolated species and clusters at low and high dopant concentration, respectively, altering the band gap energy and in some cases introducing Ti3+ centers into the crystal structure. The dopants introduced do not appear to substantially modify the primary particle size, the crystal structure as well the textural properties of the nanomaterials.

3.3. Photocatalytic activity

Fig. 8 shows the steady-state reaction rates for the gas-phase photo-oxidation of toluene by the two TiO2 series under artificial sunlight and pure UV irradiation (inset), taking into account the different BET surface area of the samples. Expressing the rate per weight unit (mol s−1 g−1) gives essentially a similar general behavior to the one presented in Fig. 8, since the specific surface area is not significantly altered especially for the samples with low dopant content (Table 1). For comparison, the photocatalytic results obtained for the commercial reference TiO2 Degussa P-25 are also included in the figure. Catalytic tests carried out without photocatalysts or irradiation confirmed that the measured activities were fully attributed to photo-induced processes on TiO2. CO2 and benzaldehyde were the only gaseous products detected during toluene photo-oxidation. No significant differences were detected on the selectivity towards CO2 or benzaldehyde within the samples of both series. The time evolution of toluene for representative examples is presented in Fig. S2 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 8  Surface area-normalized steady-state reaction rates for toluene photo-oxidation under sunlight irradiation by the Cu-doped (A) and V-doped (B) nanomaterials. Inset: photocatalytic results under pure UV light irradiation for selected samples (TCux: squares, TVx: circles, P-25: triangles). 
A first important observation is that most of the prepared nanomaterials improve the performance of P-25. In particular, the most active doped TiO2 nanomaterial (TV0.1) presents a six-fold higher photoactivity compared to pristine P-25. In addition, a number of the doped TiO2 nanostructures are more active than the pure TiO2 nanomaterial having a similar particle size and obtained using the same preparation procedure.
In the TCux series (Fig. 8A), the photoactivity under solar light irradiation continuously decreases with increasing Cu content. Compared to the pure TiO2 reference sample, photoactivity is higher only for the low-doped sample (TCu0.05). In the TVx series (Fig. 8B), photoactivity increases for the two low V-doped nanomaterials, presenting higher efficiency than the pure TiO2 reference sample, and it decreases at higher dopant concentration. Therefore, toluene photo-excitation appears to be favored at low metal doping levels and seems clearly detrimental for high levels. This suggests the presence of a turning point where a beneficial/detrimental effect on photoactivity is detected with respect to the pure TiO2 reference sample in both TCux and TVx series in which the dopant content varies. This turning point is observed at a relatively higher dopant amount in the TVx series (i.e. TV0.5) compared to the TCux nanomaterials (i.e. TCu0.1). Nevertheless, in both cases, it is observed at low dopant concentration, is approximately at similar levels as previously reported7,14 and falls within the optimal area defined by Bloh et al.63
The inset in Fig. 8 shows the results for selected samples under similar conditions to those reported in Fig. 8 but using pure UV light excitation. A similar trend of the photoactivity with respect to the dopant level is observed regardless of the nature of the light source. However, smaller differences were detected within the samples tested under pure UV light irradiation, since the improvement of photocatalytic activity is more pronounced under solar light irradiation. This indicates that visible light activity is induced in the doped nanomaterials. However, although electronic properties linked with the light absorption properties of the nanomaterials might have an impact, they are not the dominant parameter determining the photoactivity.
Regarding photocatalytic activity, one should mention that it is a result of different factors, including crystalline phases present in the nanomaterial, particle size, specific surface area, porosity, band gap, composition, charge separation and many others. Herein, precise control of the synthesis process and the mild conditions applied to the nanomaterial modification resulted in nanostructures practically unchanged with regard to their crystal structure, crystallinity and textural properties, minimizing the differences within samples of the two series. As was stated above, pure electronic properties are not of significance in fully interpreting the photoactivity. Therefore, additional EPR experiments were conducted to study the charge carrier formation and abundance under light irradiation.
3.4. Charge trapping sites on TiO2

Fig. 9 presents the EPR spectra of the pure anatase TiO2 reference sample in the dark (a) and under light irradiation (b and c). No EPR signal is detected in the spectrum recorded in the dark (Fig. 9a). After 20 min of UV irradiation at liquid N2 temperature, two sets of EPR signals are detected (Fig. 9b). The low-field feature is assigned to oxygen species, holes (h+) trapped at oxygen anions (O−). As summarized in Table 3, computer simulation of the experimental data allowed the determination of two overlapping signals (h+-I and h+-II) attributed to h+ trapped at two different O− sites.24,62 The g-values of both signals are similar to those of h+ species previously observed in anatase TiO2 samples prepared and treated in a similar manner to those here.21,22,64–72

The high-field component of the spectrum contains a sharp EPR feature of axial symmetry, g⊥ = 1.991 and g‖ = 1.961 (Ti-I). Based on the EPR characteristics in terms of g-values and spectral shape, this signal can be assigned to electrons trapped at localized states in the anatase structure as Ti3+ centers.68,69,71–73 These species have been previously attributed to centers located in the inner part of the particle.22,68,72–74 The intensity of the Ti3+ signal is not affected by the presence of atmospheric O2 which further confirmed their location in the lattice of anatase (data not shown). It should be noted that Ti3+ centers formed in the bulk of the material act as recombination centers, reducing the activity of the surface reactions.71,72 These centers are different from Ti3+ centers that give rise to a broad signal at a higher field (the negative contribution of which can be observed in the inset in Fig. 9 at g ~ 1.90) and have been previously attributed to centers in a disordered environment at the crystal surface.73,74 Double integration of the single spectrum corresponding to h+ (h+-I and h+-II) and e− (Ti-I) trapped at localized states reveals that e− are less than 10% of the trapped h+. The signal intensity of the trapped charges remains essentially constant at T = 77 K and in the dark during the course of the experiment. After subsequent warming of the sample at room temperature, both h+ and e− EPR signals are lost (data not shown) as a result of the h+/e− recombination process.
In the presence of isopropanol, a well-known hole scavenger, the EPR signal assigned to trapped holes disappears completely (Fig. 9c). The sharp Ti-I signal with g⊥ = 1.991 and g‖ = 1.961 remains essentially unchanged and a new signal at g ~ 1.95 assigned to different Ti3+ centers appears.31,65 This second species is located at the surface of the solid and is extended over 320 G due to the relatively disordered environment.74,75 These observations are in accordance with previous reports31,71 and clearly demonstrate that the holes are trapped at the surface since they easily react with hole scavengers such as isopropanol. Therefore, they are consumed during photo-oxidation of toluene.
Overall, based on the above observations and in accordance with the well-established charge transfer processes in similar systems,1,68,69 we indicate the following charge transfer steps under light irradiation: TiO2 + hv → e− + h+(1) e− + Ti4+ → Ti3+(2) h+ + O2− → O−(3)indicating the charge carrier formation under irradiation (1) and the electron (2) and hole (3) trapping at localized states.
Changes in the EPR spectra were also detected for the doped materials under irradiation. Representative spectra of the catalysts taken in the dark and under irradiation are presented in Fig. 10. Fig. 11 presents the EPR spectra of the doped materials in the region of the trapped h+ and e− normalized to their second integral. The spectra were taken under irradiation and in vacuum and were presented after removing an appropriate amount of the corresponding spectra recorded in the dark. Two important information can be extracted when the doped materials are compared with the pure reference material: (i) an EPR feature identical to that of the pure TiO2 reference sample assigned to trapped holes is observed in the majority of the doped TiO2 materials. No hole signal was detected for the TCu0.5 and TCu1 samples. The experimental spectra were simulated (red spectra in Fig. 11) by assuming two overlapping signals similar to those used for the pure TiO2 reference; (ii) the Ti3+ EPR signal of the e− trapped at localized centers (Ti-I) detected in the undoped TiO2 reference sample disappears completely in the presence of the dopant in both the TCux and TVx series (Fig. 11). These results clearly indicate that in the metal-doped anatase nanomaterials, photoinitiated charge formation takes place, forming h+ species identical to those in the pure TiO2 reference catalyst.

 Fig. 11  Normalized EPR spectra of metal-doped TiO2 taken after 20 min of UV irradiation in vacuum after subtracting an appropriate amount of the corresponding spectra recorded in the dark. Dashed red lines: computer-simulated spectra using two overlapping h+ signals. Experimental conditions: same as those in Fig. 9. 
Regarding the O− signal, clear differences in the intensity of the hole signal were observed by varying the amount of the dopant. The relative signal intensity corresponding to trapped holes as O− centers versus dopant concentration is presented in Fig. 12. The amount of trapped holes which ultimately drive the surface photo-oxidation processes follows a belt-like shape with optimum conditions achieved at low or moderate dopant concentration. In the case of the Cu2+-doped materials, the intensity of the hole signal when compared with that of the pure TiO2 reference is higher only for the TCu0.05 sample and is not detected in the high-loaded samples (Fig. 12, samples TCu0.5 and TCu1). In the case of the TVx series, the O− signal intensity is higher in TV0.05 and TV0.1 compared to the pure TiO2 sample and deteriorates at higher V4+ concentrations. This loss of intensity in both series for dopant contents higher than 0.5% cannot be attributed to a shading/shielding effect taking into account the low dopant-to-Ti surface ratio based on XPS. The relative contribution of the two individual hole signals (h+-I and h+-II), calculated as the % of the total intensity of the hole signal (I + II), is essentially stable in all samples and is not affected by the dopant concentration. At this point, we highlight the clear resemblance of the h+ EPR signal intensity variation with the catalytic activity presented in Fig. 8 for both series. It has been shown previously in V-doped TiO2 that the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in solution follows the hydroxyl radical formation,43 which in turn is related to h+ production.
 Fig. 12  Relative EPR intensity of the hole signal in the pure (solid symbol) and the TCux (blue color) and TVx (green color) series. 
The absence of the Ti-I EPR signal assigned to localized sites of trapped electrons (i.e. Ti3+) in all doped nanomaterials under irradiation can be exclusively assigned to the presence of the dopant. This is based on the general mechanism of the charge photo-generation and transfer process described in reactions (1)–(3)1,68,69 and is further supported by the hole formation in the doped materials (detected as O− centers) as well as the detection of Ti3+ centers as localized electron trapping sites in the pure TiO2 material. In such a scheme, the straightforward explanation would be the presence of an effective electron transfer process where the dopant plays the role of an acceptor of the photogenerated electrons,31,38,73 minimizing the Ti3+ signal at g⊥ = 1.991 (i.e. Ti-I species). In fact, a decrease of the Cu2+ EPR signal intensity was detected in the TCu0.05 nanomaterial upon light irradiation (Fig. 10, marked area). This suggests the reduction of Cu2+ to EPR-silent Cu+via accepting photogenerated e−.31,38 The signal intensity was restored after exposing the sample to ambient atmosphere. No such difference was detected for the V-doped materials. However, the vanadium case is more complicated due to the possible participation of three different oxidation states (+5, +4, and +3). This electron transfer process is expected to have an impact on the photoactivity, via eliminating the Ti-I species formed in the bulk of the material22,68,72,73 and facilitating charge separation.

Fig. 13 shows correlation plots between the EPR hole signal intensity versus the steady-state reaction rate for the gas-phase toluene photodegradation (left Y-axis) and cluster formation (right Y-axis) in the TCux (Fig. 13A) and TVx series (Fig. 13B). A linear trend between catalytic activity and metal cluster formation is observed as a function of hole formation in both cases. In the second case, note that some samples do not have a cluster contribution to the doped metal distribution and generate two linear response regions (one trivial, with null slope). Given that holes are the primary photogenerated species responsible for toluene degradation by TiO2,5,6,73 the difference in photoactivity detected between samples in both series (Fig. 8) is due to the relative abundance of such species in the nanomaterial, as expressed in Fig. 12 and indicated by the correlation plots in Fig. 13. On the other hand, cluster formation as expressed by the broad unstructured signal in the EPR spectra of both Cu and V series (Fig. 6 and 7, respectively) is inversely proportional to the EPR hole signal intensity.
 Fig. 13  Correlation plots between the EPR hole signal intensity and the steady-state reaction rates of toluene photodegradation (open symbols, left Y-axis) and the EPR hole signal intensity with the cluster formation (solid symbols, right Y-axis) for the TCux (A) and TVx (B) series. The pure TiO2 reference sample is indicated with the red symbol. Lines are a guide for the eyes. 
The interpretation of such correlation plots would imply that the photocatalytic degradation of toluene is directly correlated with hole formation, which in turn is tuned by the dopant species in the nanomaterial. Isolated and highly dispersed Cu2+ and V4+ species are beneficial for toluene photodegradation while the presence of metal oxide clusters reduces photoactivity via deterioration of hole formation. This mechanism is controlled by the dopant content in the nanostructures and in our materials, the turning points are 0.1% and 0.5% for Cu-doped and V-doped anatase TiO2, respectively. The isolated dopant species restrain the recombination rate of electron and hole pairs by accepting photogenerated electrons demonstrated by the absence of Ti3+ centers as localized electron traps in the doped materials (Fig. 8 and 9). Once efficiently separated, the photogenerated charges can be more effectively involved in oxidation and reduction reactions, enhancing toluene photodegradation. On the other hand, by increasing the dopant content above a certain point in the final nanomaterial, metal clusters are formed acting as recombination centers38,63 of photogenerated e− and h+, suppressing photoactivity. Despite the difference in the actual metal content linked with the turning point of the catalytic activity (0.1% for Cu2+ and 0.5% for V4+), the data presented herein verify that photoactivity is governed by the same mechanism in both TiO2 series, suggesting that this interpretation may find application in similar systems.
Conclusions
Two series of Cu2+ and V4+ doped anatase TiO2 samples were prepared via the microemulsion synthetic route. The electronic and structural properties of the metal-containing titania nanomaterials were fully characterized. Nanomaterials with primary particle sizes and textural properties in a comparable range were developed while band gap narrowing was observed for the doped nanostructures. EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of different dopant species via varying their nominal concentration and their effect on the abundance and stability of photogenerated charge carriers, e− and h+ pairs. Complete structural and electronic characterization combined with catalytic results of toluene photo-oxidation under both pure UV and artificial solar light irradiation allowed the determination of the factors affecting photoactivity. EPR provided direct experimental evidence that photoinitiated charge formation took place in the nanomaterials. Different dopant species were identified. Isolated and highly dispersed Cu2+ and V4+ species favored hole formation while at the same time decreasing the amount of Ti3+ centers (i.e. trapped e− at localized states) under irradiation. It is proposed that the presence of such dopant species is responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity via increasing the charge separation efficiency, acting as efficient electron scavengers and increasing the surface availability of the key charge carrier, the holes. At higher dopant levels, metal clusters were formed acting as recombination centers deteriorating the photoactivity.
