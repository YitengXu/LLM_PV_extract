    , Accepted 20th March 2021First published on 22nd March 2021AbstractIn this work, a new kind of CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods with controlled ZnO shell are first synthesized by a simple chemical deposition method in aqueous solution. The thickness and distribution of the ZnO shell can be accurately adjusted, and intimate contact interfaces between CdS and ZnO are well constructed. The optimal CSZ0.5 core–shell heterostructure exhibits a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 805.5 μmol h−1 without co-catalysts (3 mg of catalyst, equal to 268.5 mmol g−1 h−1), which is 12 and 895 times higher than that of CdS and ZnO, respectively, and is the maximum value among CdS-based photocatalysts under similar experimental conditions. The significant enhancement in the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate can be mainly attributed to three positive factors: the single-crystalline structure of CdS, the Z-scheme mechanism formed between CdS and ZnO, and the introduced ascorbic acid. The first two factors effectively promote the separation and migration of charge carriers, and the latter factor realizes efficient hydrogen spillover for CdS/ZnO to accelerate the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, the homogeneous ZnO shell grown on the CdS core efficiently suppresses the photo-corrosion of CdS, which endows CdS/ZnO with outstanding photostability.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting over semiconductors has been taken as an ideal strategy to obtain hydrogen to solve the urgent environmental and energy problems.1,2 Over the years, a lot of research studies have been focused on developing various semiconductors for efficient photocatalysts. However, most of those photocatalysts suffer low efficiency for solar energy conversion, mainly owing to the weak light absorption limited by the wide band gap.3–10 CdS has attracted more attention for photocatalytic H2 evolution due to its high visible-light absorption ability (2.4 eV) and suitable band position.11–14 Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity of pristine CdS is still poor, largely restrained by its fast recombination of charge carriers and serious photo-corrosion.15,16 Thus, some methods, such as morphology control17–21 and heterojunction construction,22–30 have been utilized to overcome the above drawbacks of CdS.
The morphology of photocatalysts has an important effect on charge separation. It has been reported that photocatalysts with a one-dimensional structure, such as nanorods, can attain quick electron transport.31 Additionally, the single-crystalline structure can prolong the electron transmit distance, which is a few orders of magnitude larger than that of a disordered polycrystalline structure.13,32,33 Hence, it seems reasonable that single-crystalline CdS nanorods possess a higher charge separation efficiency in comparison with polycrystalline CdS nanoparticles. Moreover, the heterojunction construction is another effective method to accelerate the separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes. ZnO is considered as an ideal semiconductor to construct a heterojunction with CdS because of its nontoxicity, low cost and matched band position.14,34–36 However, it can be found that the vast majority of reports about the CdS/ZnO heterojunction are focused on the structure constituting a ZnO core and CdS shell, which is unable to effectively utilize ZnO to restrain the photo-corrosion of CdS.35,37 The reason can be mainly ascribed to the fact that the morphology and distribution of the ZnO shell are very difficult to control by solution methods because ZnO prefers to grow along particular crystal planes.38 It is worth mentioning that the growth of the ZnO shell on the CdS core has been realized by an atomic layer deposition approach (ALD) in our group.14 Nevertheless, the method of ALD brings some disadvantages, including a complicated synthesis process (high vacuum and heating at 250 °C), high cost and poor yield. Therefore, the direct synthesis of the CdS–ZnO core–shell composites in solution with high photocatalytic performance without co-catalyst39 may be a good choice to overcome the above shortcomings.
Normally, the process of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) involves three hydrogen statuses: original proton H+, medial adsorbed H* and final generated H2. Additionally, the interaction between the hydrogen intermediate H* and the catalyst surface has a great effect on the catalytic reaction rates,40,41 where the H* adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of the catalyst. The value of ΔGH for the catalyst to realize high activity is expected to be not too negative (robust H adsorption, but unfavorable H2 generation) or too positive (advantageous H2 production, but inferior H adsorption). In fact, a lot of unitary catalysts suffered inappropriate ΔGH values (ΔGH < 0 or ΔGH > 0) commonly, accompanied by low catalytic activity. Therefore, some binary catalysts constituted by one with ΔGH < 0 (H*-enrichment region) and the other with ΔGH > 0 (H*-poor region) have been successfully constructed to boost performances for electrocatalytic HER,42 or ultrahigh selective hydrogenation of N-heteroarenes43 by realizing hydrogen spillover from the H*-rich region to H*-poor region. Additionally, it has been reported that small organic molecules (ethylene glycol) can assist the Pt/CoP binary catalyst to achieve efficient hydrogen spillover for electrocatalytic HER.40 It can be expected that hydrogen spillover induced by small organic molecules can also be taken as an effective method to improve the photocatalytic performance, especially for such CdS–ZnO core–shell structure by transferring H* to CdS (H*-poor, but electron-abundant region). However, the effect and mechanism of hydrogen spillover for photocatalytic HER have not been reported yet.
In this work, a new kind of CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods with controlled ZnO shell was successfully synthesized by a simple chemical deposition method in aqueous solution for the first time. With this method, the thickness and distribution of the ZnO shell can be precisely controlled, and the intimate contact interfaces between CdS and ZnO can be realized. Moreover, ascorbic acid (AA) was introduced into the binary photocatalysts system. The optimal CSZ0.5 core–shell nanorods exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 805.5 μmol h−1 without adding any co-catalysts, which is 12 and 895 times higher than that of pristine CdS and ZnO, respectively, and is the maximum value among CdS-based photocatalysts under similar experimental conditions. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) reached 34.46% at the wavelength of 365 nm. The mechanism for the improved photocatalytic performance of CdS/ZnO heterostructure and the hydrogen spillover induced by AA were studied in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of CdS nanorods
The CdS nanorods were synthesized by using a modified method according to a previous report.44 In brief, 2.85 g of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 2.85 g of CH4N2S were first dispersed in 60 mL of ethylenediamine under magnetic stirring. Next, the mixed solution was poured into a 100 mL volume stainless-steel autoclave, heated at 180 °C for 36 h in an oven, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The yellow precipitate was collected by filtration, and then was washed by distilled water and ethanol for a few times. Finally, the product was put in a vacuum oven and dried at 60 °C for 12 h, resulting in CdS nanorods.
2.2. Synthesis of CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods
The CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods were prepared by a facile modified method of chemical deposition, as reported in the literature.45 In a typical procedure, 120 mg of as-synthesized CdS nanorods, 50 mg of ascorbic acid (AA), and a certain amount of ZnCl2 were successively added into 60 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring for half an hour. Then, the mixed solution was transferred into an oil bath, and a volume of diluted ammonia solution (NH3·H2O) was added dropwise into the reaction solution. Afterward, the above solution was sealed and then heated at 60 °C under continuous stirring for 5 h. Finally, the resultant product was obtained by filtration, followed by washing with distilled water and ethanol for several times, and then was dried for 12 h in a vacuum oven, resulting in the CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods. For convenience, the obtained CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods with different mole ratios of added ZnCl2 to CdS nanorods (0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2) were marked as CSZ0.3, CSZ0.5, CSZ1 and CSZ2, respectively. The preparation process of the CdS/ZnO samples is presented in Scheme 1.

2.3. Synthesis of ZnO
For comparison, the pristine ZnO was synthesized by the same procedure as the preparation of the CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods without adding CdS nanorods.
2.4. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation of 1.5418 Å, working at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were measured on a FEI Quanta 250 SEM operated at 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were performed on a JEOL JEM2100 TEM. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were obtained by a V-670 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient PL decay spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrometer. The specific surface area and pore distribution measurements were finished on a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB spectrometer with aluminum Kα radiation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were given by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27).
2.5. Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic water splitting reaction was carried out in a cylindrical quartz cell combined with a sealed glass gas circulation system (CEL-SPH2N). 3 mg of photocatalyst was added into 25 mL of distilled water to realize a uniform suspension, and then a certain amount of sodium sulfide (0.35 M) and sodium sulfite (0.25 M) were added as sacrificial agents. The irradiation time of each reaction was 3 h, which was supported by a 300 W Xe lamp (320–780 nm). The generated H2 was periodically submitted to a TCD gas phase chromatograph (GC-9720) by carrier gas (N2) to evaluate the amount. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at 6 °C by a water-cooling circulation system.
2.6. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and transient photocurrent responses were recorded by using an electrochemical station (CHI 660E) in a normal three-electrode cell. The FTO coated with a little bit of catalyst was used as the working electrode, a saturation calomel electrode was used as a reference electrode, and a platinum plate was used as the counter electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp was applied as the light source for photocurrent responses, and the transfer period for light between on and off was 20 s. 0.1 M of Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte through the tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The characterizations of photocatalysts
The crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples was investigated by using XRD. As displayed in Fig. 1a, the pristine CdS nanorods exhibited a high crystalline structure of hexagonal CdS phase (JCPDS 41-1049).13,14,44 The CdS/ZnO composites showed the similar diffraction peaks as CdS nanorods. No obvious diffraction peaks of ZnO were observed for all CdS/ZnO composites, probably because the amount of ZnO generated on the surface of the CdS nanorods is too small.14 As the reference sample, all diffraction peaks of ZnO (Fig. S1a†) matched well with the hexagonal ZnO phase (JCPDS 36-1451).34 As shown in Fig. 1b, the two bands at 1158 and 1351 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of CSZ0.5 can be assigned to AA, suggesting the presence of AA molecules in the CdS/ZnO composites. To better understand the influence of AA molecules on the CdS/ZnO binary photocatalysts, the counterpart sample marked as CSZ0.5-1 was also prepared by the same synthetic process as CSZ0.5, but without adding AA. It can be apparently found in Fig. S1b† that no characteristic peaks of AA appeared in the CSZ0.5-1 sample, forming an evident contrast with CSZ0.5.

TEM measurements were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 1c and e, the pristine CdS sample displayed the nanorod morphology with a large aspect ratio and neat edges. It can be obviously observed from Fig. 1d that each CdS nanorod exhibited single crystal orientation, and a lattice fringe of 0.336 nm was in accordance with the (002) plane of the hexagonal CdS phase.16 Moreover, the corresponding lattice diffraction pattern (Fig. 1f) of the CdS nanorod (Fig. 1e) showed identical diffraction spot spacing, corresponding to the (002) plane of the CdS phase, indicating that the as-synthesized CdS nanorods were single crystalline.12 This was in line with the result shown in Fig. 1d. After combining with ZnO, the obtained CSZ0.3 (Fig. S2a†), CSZ0.5 (Fig. 1g), CSZ1 (Fig. S2c†) and CSZ2 (Fig. S2e†) composites retained the nanorod morphology, but their surfaces became a little rough compared with the smooth surface of pristine CdS. This was due to the thin shell coated on the core. Additionally, their shells seemed relatively homogeneous, and the corresponding thicknesses were about 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 6 nm, respectively, which can be determined from the corresponding HRTEM images of CSZ0.3 (Fig. S2b†), CSZ0.5 (Fig. 1h), CSZ1 (Fig. S2d†) and CSZ2 (Fig. S2f†). Moreover, the lattice spacings of 0.316 nm (Fig. S2b, 1h and S2f†) and 0.245 nm (Fig. S2d†) in the core were in good agreement with the (101) and (102) plane of the hexagonal CdS phase,16,46,47 respectively. Meanwhile, the lattice fringes of 0.26 nm (Fig. S2b, 1h and S2f†) and 0.28 nm (Fig. S2d†) in the shell corresponded to the (101) and (100) planes of the hexagonal ZnO phase,14 respectively, suggesting that the ZnO shell grown on the CdS core possessed good crystallinity.
The similar morphologic characteristics of the as-synthesized samples were further confirmed by the SEM images. The following points can be concluded by making comparisons of all the SEM images (Fig. S3†). First, the pristine CdS exhibited the nanorod structure with a diameter of 15–30 nm and a length of 100–500 nm, and these nanorods were arranged in different directions. Next, the morphologies of the CdS–ZnO core–shell nanorods showed no obvious change compared with that of the CdS nanorods, indicating that the amounts of generated ZnO were small. Furthermore, no surface agglomeration of ZnO was observed even in the CSZ2 sample with a ZnO shell thickness of 6 nm, demonstrating that the generated ZnO was completely grown on the CdS nanorods without the generation of dissociative ZnO. As the comparative sample, ZnO exhibited the hexagonal block morphology.48 Therefore, the obtained specific surface areas (SBET) of the CdS/ZnO composites (Fig. S4 and Table S1†) were close to the value of the CdS nanorods (24.32 m2 g−1).
STEM image (Fig. 1i) and elemental mappings (Fig. 1j–l) were further utilized to characterize the core–shell structure of the CSZ0.5 sample. The Cd and S elemental mappings further verified that CdS acted as the core with nanorod morphology in the CSZ0.5 sample (Fig. 1j and k). Meanwhile, the dots representing Zn and O elements outlined a thin shell, which was uniformly coated on the surface of the CdS core (Fig. 1l and S5†). Additionally, the amount of ZnO coated on the CdS nanorods over all of the samples was clarified by two methods, EDX and ICP-MS, respectively, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S6 and Tables S2, S3.† It can be clearly observed that the respective results of EDX and ICP-MS were close to each other, and the percentages of Zn increased with the original mole ratios of ZnCl2 to CdS. Notably, the measured mole ratios of Zn to Cd over the CdS/ZnO composites were obviously lower than the corresponding dosages, demonstrating that the produced ZnO was completely coated on the CdS nanorods and the redundant source of Zn was removed by subsequent cleaning process.
As a typical sample, the XPS of the CSZ0.5 sample was measured to ascertain the elemental composition and valence state. The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 2a confirmed the existence of Cd, S, Zn, O and C elements. The C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was mostly derived from the CO2 adsorbed on the surface of the sample and the double-sided tape used for pasting the test sample.49–51 The two peaks centered at 405.0 and 411.7 eV in the spectrum of Cd 3d (Fig. 2b) corresponded to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively, suggesting the presence of Cd2+ in the composite.52,53 The spectrum of S 2p with two peaks at 161.4 and 162.6 eV was in accordance with the common distribution of the S 2p peak positions (Fig. 2c), which indicated the existence of the S2− species in the system.54 Moreover, the spectrum of Zn 2p displayed two peaks with binding energies at 1021.8 and 1044.9 eV (Fig. 2d), which can be ascribed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, confirming the oxidation state of Zn2+.55–57 In addition, the high-resolution spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 2e can be fitted into two peaks, the lattice oxygen species at 531.6 eV and the chemisorbed oxygen species at 532.6 eV, demonstrating the presence of O2− in the sample.49,58 The above results verified the successful synthesis of the CdS/ZnO heterostructure.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured to reveal the optical absorption characteristics of the as-prepared photocatalysts. As presented in Fig. 3a, owing to the narrow band gap of 2.4 eV,59 the pristine CdS nanorods displayed strong light absorbance from the UV to visible light region (200–550 nm). As the reference sample, the pristine ZnO with a wide band gap of 3.2 eV only showed high light absorption in the UV region (200–400 nm).53 For the CdS/ZnO composites, the samples exhibited a similar feature with pristine CdS, except that a slight decline appeared in the wavelength region of 350–500 nm and the decline degree increased slowly with the thickening ZnO shell. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that the amount of thin ZnO shell coated on the CdS nanorods was small. Moreover, the equation α(hν) = A(hν − Eg)1/2 was applied to calculate the band gaps of those samples, where hν, Eg, α and A are the photon energy, band gap energy, absorption coefficient and a constant, respectively.60 According to the corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. S7†) and summarized results (Table S4†), it can be clearly observed that the calculated values of these band gaps, such as 2.4 eV for CdS and 3.2 eV for ZnO, were in good agreement with previously reported values.53,59

3.2 The H2 evolution performances of photocatalysts
The photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments over all photocatalysts were performed without loading any co-catalysts under simulated solar light irradiation. As displayed in Fig. 3b, the H2 evolution rate of pristine CdS nanorods was 66.9 μmol h−1, and is obviously larger than that of other structured CdS, such as nanoparticles,14 nanospheres,61 nanowires,62 and others. The relatively high photocatalytic activity of the pristine CdS nanorods can be attributed to the high crystallinity and single crystal in each CdS nanorod, which can effectively reduce the migration resistance of the photo-generated electrons through the internal crystal planes, realizing a quick and long-distance electron transmission.31–33 In contrast, the pristine ZnO presented the lowest H2 evolution rate (0.9 μmol h−1). This is probably due to the finite light absorption ability determined by its wide band gap. By depositing a shell layer of ZnO, the H2 evolution rates of CdS/ZnO composites were significantly enhanced in comparison with the pristine CdS nanorods. Moreover, the H2 evolution rate first increased and then gradually decreased with the increasing thickness of the ZnO shell, demonstrating that the thickness of the ZnO shell has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of the CdS/ZnO nanorods. It seems understandable that the appropriate deposition of ZnO on the CdS nanorods can form an effective heterostructure between CdS and ZnO to facilitate the separation and migration of photo-induced electrons and holes, while an excessive ZnO shell layer may reduce the quantity of charge carriers because of its wide band gap.14 The optimal ZnO/CdS mole ratio was confirmed to be 0.5, where the corresponding ZnO shell layer was 1.5 nm, and the maximum H2 evolution rate of the CSZ0.5 sample reached 805.5 μmol h−1, which is 12 times higher than that of the pristine CdS nanorods. The photocatalytic performances of different CdS-based photocatalysts reported in the literature were diffusely retrieved, and the data are listed in Table S5.† It is worth noting that the value of 805.5 μmol h−1 (3 mg of catalyst, corresponding to 268.5 mmol g−1 h−1) is the current maximum in CdS-based photocatalysts under similar measurement conditions. Simultaneously, the counterpart sample CSZ0.5-1 without AA molecules exhibited a much lower H2 evolution rate of 252.6 μmol h−1 compared to that of CSZ0.5, demonstrating that a small amount of AA molecules remaining in the CdS/ZnO composite had a positive impact on its photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, which will be subsequently discussed in detail. In addition, it can be obviously seen from Fig. S8† that the H2 evolution amounts over all samples increased linearly with time.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) over the CSZ0.5 sample was performed at four different wavelengths as follows: 365, 380, 420, and 500 nm. The test method and calculation procedure of AQE are presented in ESI.† As displayed in Fig. 3c, the CSZ0.5 sample reached the greatest AQE data of 34.46% at the wavelength of 365 nm, and the AQE dropped off with increasing wavelength. Meanwhile, the specific values of AQE over different wavelengths are summarized in Table S6.† The AQE value at 365 nm (20 mg of catalysts) in our work are relatively high (Table S7†) because the ZnO shell with a wide band gap (3.2 eV) uniformly coated on the CdS core can only be motivated by ultraviolet light (below 387 nm) to generate electrons and holes, and then form efficient heterojunction with CdS. Moreover, the cycling measurements of photocatalytic H2 evolution over the CSZ0.5 sample were accomplished to explore the stability of the photocatalyst. The cycling process was carried out for six cycles, and each cycle was maintained for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 3d, no obvious decline was found for the H2 evolution rate in 18 h, indicating the superior stability of the CSZ0.5 sample for H2 evolution. Similarly, no distinct change was observed in Fig. S9† for the XRD result of the CSZ0.5 sample compared with the fresh sample, further confirming the prominent photocatalytic stability and recyclability of this material.63 As we all know, CdS suffered severe photo-corrosion induced by the photo-generated holes, which would turn CdS into Cd2+ ions, resulting in the decline of the hydrogen evolution activity. Herein, we employed an ICP-MS instrument to measure the Cd2+ ions concentrations in the solution of pristine CdS and CSZ0.5 after photocatalytic reaction to evaluate their degree of photo-corrosion. As presented in Table S8,† the pristine CdS solution displayed a relatively high concentration of Cd2+ (1.22 mg L−1) after 3 h of irradiation, indicating its serious photo-corrosion. Unlike CdS, the Cd2+ concentration in the CSZ0.5 solution distinctly decreased to 0.008 mg L−1 after 3 h irradiation, and only reached 0.31 mg L−1 even after 18 h irradiation, suggesting that the ZnO shell deposited on the CdS surface can efficiently suppress the photo-corrosion of CdS.
3.3 The separation and transfer of charge carriers
The photoluminescence spectroscopies (PL) over these samples were performed at the excitation wavelength of 325 nm to study the separation and transmission feature of photo-induced charge carriers. It can be observed that the main emission peak located at about 468 nm in Fig. 4a, which was induced by the recombination behavior of photo-generated electrons and holes.63 Owing to the fast recombination of electrons and holes, the pristine ZnO displayed the highest PL intensity in the inset of Fig. 4a, which was consistent with its lowest H2 evolution rate. When combining CdS with ZnO, the CdS/ZnO composites exhibited lower PL intensity than that of either CdS or ZnO, demonstrating that the heterojunction constructed by CdS and ZnO can effectively suppress the recombination of charge carriers. Moreover, the lowest PL peak was observed for the CSZ0.5 sample, which implied the significantly enhanced separation efficiency of electrons and holes, corresponding to its highest H2 evolution rate. The time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) decay spectra of the CdS and CSZ0.5 samples were also measured to confirm the charge transfer process. The TRPL decay curves can be well fitted by a multi-exponential function, and the average emission lifetime can be calculated by the following equation: , where τ1, τ2 and τ3 represent the fluorescent lifetimes, A1, A2 and A3 correspond to the respective amplitudes, and τA is the average emission lifetime.64 As shown Fig. 4b and Table S9,† the average emission lifetime of the CSZ0.5 sample (6.86 ns) was apparently shorter than that of the pristine CdS nanorods (9.76 ns), further verifying that the charge transfer process over the CSZ0.5 sample was effectively accelerated by the CdS/ZnO heterostructure.13
 Fig. 4  PL spectroscopies (a), time-resolved PL decay curves (b), transient photocurrent responses (the measurement was conducted under the light intensity of 115 mW cm−2 without using a bias voltage) (c) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (d) of the as-synthesized samples. 
The transient photocurrent responses (TPR) were carried out over all of the samples under the condition of simulated solar light. As displayed in Fig. 4c, the pristine ZnO presented the lowest photocurrent density, due to its wide band gap and quick recombination of electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the pristine CdS nanorods exhibited a higher photocurrent response in comparison with ZnO, owing to its narrower band gap of 2.4 eV. Obviously, all of the CdS/ZnO composites showed an increased photocurrent density compared to that of CdS and ZnO alone, suggesting the more efficient separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes resulting from the heterostructure formed between CdS and ZnO. Besides, it can be observed that the highest photocurrent response was obtained by the CSZ0.5 sample, in accordance with its lowest PL intensity and highest photocatalytic performance. Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) over these samples are displayed in Fig. 4d, where the smaller arc radius in the Nyquist plot represented the lower charge transfer resistance.53 The CSZ0.5 sample presented the smallest arc radius, indicating the CdS/ZnO heterostructure with an appropriate thickness of ZnO shell layer can notably enhance the charge transfer ability. According to the above analysis of PL, TRPL, TPR and EIS results, it can be concluded that the CSZ0.5 sample achieved the highest photocatalytic performance benefiting from the most efficient charge separation and migration efficiency and smallest charge transfer resistance.
3.4 The photocatalytic mechanism
To investigate the charge transfer mechanism, the band positions of CdS and ZnO can be estimated by Mott–Schottky plots.63 As presented in Fig. S10,† the flat band potentials (Efb) for CdS and ZnO were −0.40 and −0.22 V versus NHE, respectively, which were nearly equal to their conduction bands. According to the above-calculated results of the band gaps for CdS and ZnO in the Tauc plots (Fig. S7†), their valence band values can be calculated to be 2.00 and 2.98 V versus NHE, respectively. It is well known that CdS and ZnO generally form II-type or Z-type heterojunctions based on their band positions. Hence, the concentration changes of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) with time over the CSZ0.5 and ZnO samples were conducted to make the mechanism clear. The tracer was terephthalic acid, which can react with the generated ˙OH to produce 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid.14 In general, the PL intensity increases gradually with the increasing amount of ˙OH. Here, it should be noted that ˙OH can be produced by two ways. As shown in Fig. S11b,† one way comes from the photo-induced holes of ZnO, which react with hydroxyl ions (OH−) or H2O to produce ˙OH. The other way originates from the photo-generated electrons of either CdS or ZnO, which can react with dissolved oxygen to generate superoxide radical anions (˙O2−), and ˙O2− further combines with hydrogen ions (H+) to generate ˙OH. Hence, p-benzoquinone was additionally utilized as the ˙O2− trapping agent to confirm the source of ˙OH. As displayed in Fig. S11a,† the PL intensities of the CSZ0.5 and ZnO samples increased with similar values and characteristics over time when p-benzoquinone acted as the ˙O2− trapping agent. It has been reported that the valence band position of ZnO (+2.98 V) is more positive than E(˙OH/H2O) (+2.27 V vs. NHE) and E(˙OH/OH−) (+2.38 V vs. NHE), while the valence band position of CdS (+2.00 V) is less positive than E(˙OH/H2O) and E(˙OH/OH−).14 Therefore, it can be concluded that the ˙OH was generated by the photo-induced holes of ZnO, demonstrating that the photo-generated holes of ZnO remained in the valence band of itself, not transferred to the valence band of CdS. As a consequence, CdS and ZnO did not follow the II-type heterojunction under photocatalytic reaction. Preferably, the photo-induced electrons from the conduction band of ZnO transmitted to the valence band of CdS to generate recombination, while the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of CdS reacted with H+ to produce H2. As presented in Fig. 5a, the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism without an electron mediator was naturally constructed between CdS and ZnO.
 Fig. 5  Proposed charge transfer mechanism of the CdS/ZnO heterostructure (a), calculated Gibbs free energy graph for hydrogen spillover on CdS/ZnO (black) and CdS/ZnO-AA (blue), and the insets are the optimized H* adsorption structures at different sites (b). 
However, the thin ZnO shell coated on the CdS surface would hinder the contact between H+ and CdS in some degree as vast H+ in solution directly contacted with external ZnO shell, resulting in the limited photocatalytic activity for the CdS/ZnO heterostructure. Considering the significantly improved hydrogen evolution performances of all CdS/ZnO composites with AA, AA must boost the catalytic kinetics of the CdS/ZnO-AA catalysts in some way. Additionally, it is well known that AA molecule cannot be motivated to generate charge carriers or considered as a medium to transmit electrons (or holes) due to the fact that AA is not a semiconductor or a good conductor. According to this situation, we can infer that AA may contribute to the transfer of hydrogen in the kinetic process of hydrogen generation to enhance the H2 evolution rate. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations (the specific calculated methods and details are depicted in ESI†) were conducted to investigate the influence of the AA molecule on the hydrogen transfer between ZnO and CdS. As displayed in Fig. 5b, for the CdS/ZnO composite without AA, ΔGH on the ZnO surface (site-a) was determined to be −0.18 eV, indicating that the ZnO surface was in favor of H* adsorption, but unfavorable for H2 evolution. The similar feature was found on the ZnO/CdS interface (site-b) with a slightly higher ΔGH value of −0.13 eV. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the ΔGH value on the CdS surface (site-c) was 0.61 eV, corresponding to its strong ability of H2 generation, but weak H* adsorption. It seemed beneficial for improving the photocatalytic performance if H* can gradually transfer from the ZnO surface (site-a) to the electron-rich CdS surface (site-c). Actually, the first-step of H* transfer from site-a to site-b may easily come true with a low barrier of 0.05 eV. However, the second-step for H* to further reach site-c from site-b was very difficult because the barrier between the two sites was fairly high (0.74 eV), resulting in the poor-connected catalytic system of CdS/ZnO with low activity. Compared with the CdS/ZnO composite, the introduced AA caused the corresponding ΔGH values of the CdS/ZnO-AA composite to apparently change from −0.18 to −0.26 eV (site-a), from −0.13 to −0.02 (site-b), and from 0.61 to −0.25 eV (site-c). Such changes made the H* adsorption on both site-a and site-c become stronger, especially for site-c. More importantly, the adjusted ΔGH of CdS/ZnO-AA exhibited the low barriers (0.24 and 0.23 eV) for the two above-mentioned steps of H* transfer from site-a to site-b, and then to site-c, facilitating the formation of a hydrogen spillover channel. In other words, the abundant H* adsorbed on the surface of ZnO would gradually transfer to the ZnO/CdS interface, and finally reach CdS surface (electron-rich region) to promote hydrogen evolution. Based on the results of the above experiments and DFT calculations, both of the Z-scheme CdS/ZnO heterojunction and hydrogen spillover induced by AA synergistically contributed to the significantly improved catalytic activity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple chemical deposition method was developed to prepare a new kind of CdS–ZnO core–shell heterostructure for highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution in aqueous solution for the first time. The thickness of the ZnO shell can be accurately controlled, and the intimate contact interfaces between CdS and ZnO can be well constructed. The optimal CSZ0.5 core–shell nanorods exhibited a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 805.5 μmol h−1 without co-catalysts, which is 12 and 895 times higher than that of pristine CdS nanorods and ZnO, respectively, and is the maximum value among CdS-based photocatalysts under the similar measurement conditions. The AQE reached 34.46% at 365 nm wavelength. There were three advantages, which contributed to the excellent photocatalytic performance. The single-crystalline structure and the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism formed between CdS and ZnO with intimate contact interfaces at the nano-scale can effectively promote the separation and migration of charge carriers. The introduced AA can realize efficient hydrogen spillover of CdS/ZnO to accelerate the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. Moreover, the homogeneous ZnO shell grown on the CdS core can effectively inhibit the photo-corrosion of CdS. This work may provide a promising strategy to design and prepare novel heterostructure photocatalysts for highly efficient H2 evolution from water splitting.
