    , Accepted 29th April 2019First published on 29th April 2019AbstractAs promising candidates for future applications in building-integrated photovoltaics, semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) have made tremendous progress. However, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the ST-OSCs is limited by intrinsic narrow absorption spectra concentrated in the near infrared region (NIR), weak extinction coefficient, and mismatched molecular energy levels of thin active layers. Here, an efficient ST-OSC based on a donor/acceptor electron pair of a trifluorinated polymer donor PBFTT and a tetrachlorinated acceptor IT-4Cl was fabricated. Due to halogenation, photovoltaic materials show stronger extinction coefficient, improved crystallinity and higher charge carrier mobility; PBFTT shows lower electronic energy levels, and IT-4Cl shows a red-shifted absorption spectrum. As a result, the PBFTT:IT-4Cl pair shows matched energy levels, complementary absorption spectra in the NIR region and a good blend morphology. Hence, as-cast OSCs based on PBFTT:IT-4Cl achieved a high PCE of 11.1% with a high short-circuit current density of 19.7 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor of 73.9%. Owing to the complementary absorption spectra in the NIR region, high EQE values between 600 and 830 nm and a favourable transparency window between 400 and 600 nm, while the human eye has the highest sensitivity in the yellow-green wavelength region (500–600 nm), ST-OSCs using an ultra-thin (10–20 nm) Au cathode showed high PCEs of 7.9–9.1% at a high average visible transmittance of 37.3–27.6% in the photopic region. The PCE of 9.1% is one of the highest values reported in the literature for ST-OSCs without any extra treatment and with an AVT of more than 25% in the photopic region so far.
1. Introduction
In the past few decades, significant progress has been made in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs)1,2 due to great development in device engineering,3,4 and high-performance donor (D)5–7 and acceptor (A)8–10 materials. So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs have reached 13–15%.11–13 Among OSCs, semitransparent-OSCs (ST-OSCs) are considered as a promising energy technology with aesthetics and decoration for energy-harvesting and heat-control windows and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPVs) applications.14,15 Despite the tremendous efforts of researchers, the PCEs of most ST-OSCs are still relatively lower because of the mismatched absorption spectra and molecular energy levels of D/A electron-pairs and the trade-off between the PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT) in devices, which cannot satisfy the practical application.
For the practical application of ST-OSCs, currently the important photovoltaic parameters of ST-OSCs are PCE and AVT.16 Unfortunately, these key parameters usually have a competitive relationship. And the top-topic and challenge to improve the overall photovoltaic performance of ST-OSCs is to synthesize new photovoltaic materials, match D/A electron-pairs reasonably, and develop efficient device engineering approaches to achieve both high PCE and AVT simultaneously.14–17 As we know, by selectively harvesting photons in the wavelength range of ultraviolet (UV, <435 nm) and near infrared regions (NIR, >670 nm), OSCs can display high AVT values.18 However, in earlier studies of conventional fullerene-based ST-OSCs (PCE <5% with a high AVT of 60%),19 the lack of high performance NIR absorbers has seriously hindered the improvement of device efficiency. Recently, the rapid development of nonfullerene (NF)-acceptors with a narrow optical bandgap provides a promising opportunity to selectively harvest NIR photons, thereby resulting in both high PCE and high AVT by avoiding competition between them.20–22 For example, recently a small molecular NF-acceptor BT-CIC with two strong electron-withdrawing acceptor terminals (IC-2Cl, dichlorinated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile) on both sides was reported by Forrest et al. and showed an absorption spectrum almost concentrated in the NIR region (650–950 nm) and an ultra-narrow bandgap of ∼1.3 eV.21 Matched with a narrow bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th, the BT-CIC-based ST-OSCs achieved a high PCE of 7.1% under a high AVT of more than 40%. So far, with the rapid development of high performance narrow bandgap NF-acceptors, the PCE of ST-OSCs has exceeded 10–11% in the literature.22 For example, Zhan et al. reported a fused-undecaryclic narrow bandgap NF-acceptor IUIC, and achieved a breaking 10% efficiency in ST-OSCs with a high AVT of 31%.22a Subsequently, Zhan et al. reported another narrow bandgap NF-acceptor FNIC2 by the molecular isomer effect, and achieved a high PCE of 11.6% under a low AVT of 13.6%.22b Recently, our gourp also reported a narrow bandgap NF-acceptor ACS8 with intramolecular noncovalent bonds, and obtained an high PCE of 11.1% under a high AVT of 28.6%.22b
However, almost all ST-OSCs based narrow bandgap NF-acceptors showed low open-circuit voltage (Voc) because of the deep LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels of these narrow bandgap NF-acceptors, which hinders further improvement of device efficiency.14b,15,17,21,22 As we know, the Voc of device is proportional to the offset between the HOMOdonor (HOMO is highest occupied molecular orbital) and the LUMOacceptor.5,7,23 So, for OSCs with the same acceptor material, the Voc increases with decreasing offset (ΔEHOMO) between the HOMOdonor and HOMOacceptor.23,24 But, too small ΔEHOMO also weakens the driving force needed for exciton dissociation and hole transfer from acceptor to donor. As a result, the related OSCs only achieved a low PCE due to the mutual restriction between Voc and short-circuit curent density (Jsc).25 Therefore, in order to achieve high PCE and realize the practical application of ST-OSCs, it is very important to reasonably select D/A electron-pairs with favorable optical absorption and matched molecular energy levels.
Herein, we fabricated an efficient ST-OSC based on a trifluorinated polymer donor PBFTT26 with a structure of fluorinated-thienyl benzodithiophene-alt-fluorinated thienothiophene-2-carboxylate (BDTT-2F-alt-TT-F) and a tetrachlorinated NF-acceptor IT-4Cl27 with a structure of a large-fused indacenodithiophene (IDTT) as the donor core along with two strong electron-withdrawing acceptor terminals (IC-2Cl) on both sides (see Fig. 1a and b). Compared to monofluorinated PTB7-Th,28 trifluorinated PBFTT displays a higher maximum extinction coefficient (∼0.83 × 105 cm−1 at 693 nm) (see Fig. S1, ESI†), a similar absorption onset in the NIR region and bandgap (∼1.60 eV), an enhanced hole mobility (>10–3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and an obviously decreased HOMO level (−5.47 eV). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1c, tetrachlorinated IT-4Cl shows a signifcantly red-shifted absorption spectrum and an increased maximum extinction coefficient (∼1.08 × 105 cm−1 at 749 nm) (see Fig. S1, ESI†), and an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.43 eV in comparison to ITIC,29 suggesting that PBFTT and IT-4Cl have very good absorption complementarity in the NIR region, which is conducive to the related ST-OSC to capture more photons and achieve a high Jsc. As shown in Fig. 1d, the PBFTT:IT-4Cl electron-pair shows a suitable ΔEHOMO (∼0.28 eV) for excitons dissociation of devices and a favorable offset (∼1.41 eV) between the HOMOdonor and LUMOacceptor, which is conducive to the OSCs simultaneously achieving high Voc and Jsc. As a result, PBFTT:IT-4Cl-based OSCs achieved a high PCE of 11.1%. Owing to the complementary absorption spectra in the NIR region, the ST-OSCs also obtained a high PCE of more than 9.0% under a high AVT of more than 25%. The PCE of 9.1% is one of the highest reported in the literature for ST-OSCs without any extra treatment and with an AVT of more than 25% in the photopic region so far.

2. Results and discussion
An inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/D:A/MoO3/Al was fabricated to probe the photovoltaic performances of OSCs based on PBFTT:IT-4Cl with different D/A weight ratios, and the related current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a and the device performance data are summarized in Table 1. The D/A ratios from 1:1 to 1:1.25 to 1:1.5 affect the device performance to some extent. OSCs display an almost constant Voc of 0.75–0.76 V, a slightly fluctuating Jsc of 17.9–19.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.5–73.9%, while the champion OSC with an optimal D/A ratio of 1:1.25 exhibits a high PCE of 11.1% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a high Jsc of 19.7 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 73.9% without extra treatments. Notably, the optimal OSCs show excellent repeatability and have an average PCE of 10.7% from 20 independent devices. Moreover, the optimal PBFTT:IT-4Cl films displayed high and balanced electron/hole mobilities (μe/μh) of 3.38 × 10−4 and 1.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in mobility measurements using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method,11a,30 as shown in Fig. 2c. Usually, the high and balanced μe/μh of D/A blend films can suppress space charge accumulation and improve charge extraction, thereby helping the related OSCs achieve high Jsc and FF,11c,24 which is consistent with the device performance.

As shown in Fig. 2b, OSCs with a D/A ratio of 1:1.25 show a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum in the whole range of 400–800 nm compared with other OSCs, which is consistent with the changing trend of Jsc values. Notably, the optimal OSC achieves an efficient EQE response in the NIR region of 675–865 nm and has a high maximum EQE value close to 80% at ∼760 nm, suggesting that the photons absorbed by IT-4Cl can be efficiently converted into electrons, which facilitates achieving a high Jsc in ST-OSCs at a high AVT. In addition, the integral Jsc values are in good agreement with the measured Jsc values, and the differences between them are less than 5%.
The charge generation and extraction properties of the OSCs were probed by evaluating the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E, T) from the measured plots of photocurrent (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff).7b,30 As shown in Fig. 2d, Jph reaches saturation at a high applied voltage (Veff > 2 V in this case), meaning that almost all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated, and free charge carriers are completely collected by the electrodes. The related parameter definitions and statistical methods are described in the ESI.† Under the maximal power output and short-circuit current conditions, the optimal OSCs show high P(E, T) values of 83.6% and 94.8%, respectively, implying that the PBFTT:IT-4Cl-based OSC has efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction behaviours. The charge recombination mechanism and properties of the OSCs were also studied. As shown in Fig. 2e, the relationship of Voc with light intensity (P) was investigated. As usual, the slope of Vocvs. lnP should be kBT/q if the device only has bimolecular recombination, while the slope closer to 2 kBT/q indicates that the trap-assisted recombination is dominant in the recombination mechanisms of the device (where T, kB and q are the Kelvin temperature, Boltzmann constant and elementary charge, respectively).30 The optimal OSC displays a slope (1.32 kBT/q) close to kBT/q, which implies that the device has a few trap-assisted recombinations. As shown in Fig. 2f, the curve of logJscvs. logP was also obtained. Normally, the correlation between them is expressed by Jsc ∝ Pα, where α values close to 1 suggest negligible bimolecular recombination in devices.30 The optimal OSC shows a high α value of 0.97, which is close to 1 and suggests very weak bimolecular recombination. The high exciton dissociation probabilities, weak trap-assisted recombination and negligible bimolecular recombination properties will improve the Jsc and FF of OSCs.
The surface and bulk morphologies of an optimal PBFTT:IT-4Cl film were probed by carrying out atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a, the blend film shows a very small root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.11 nm. Moreover, a very smooth and uniform surface morphology was also observed in the 2D height image of the blend film (see Fig. 3b). It is obvious that uniform phase separation can be observed in the phase image of AFM (see Fig. 3c), and the same phenomenon can also be observed in the TEM image (see Fig. 3d). As we know, because the top electrodes of ST-OSCs are very thin, it is difficult to form continuous and flat electrodes on the rough active layers. Therefore, for the PBFTT:IT-4Cl blend film, the small RMS roughness, smooth surface morphology, and uniform bulk morphology will be beneficial for the ST-OSCs to achieve high device efficiency.

As shown in Fig. 1c, the PBFTT:IT-4Cl film exhibits a maximum absorption peak at ∼710 nm and efficient optical absorption in the range of 600–850 nm with the maximum photon flux density in the solar spectrum,18 which is beneficial for efficient utilization of solar energy. Moreover, the blend film shows weak absorption in the range of 400–600 nm, which meets the requirement of ST-OPVs with a high AVT since the human eye has the highest sensitivity in the yellow-green wavelength region of 500–600 nm.20 Notably, OSCs show high EQE values in the wavelength region of 600–850 nm, which is conducive to breaking the dilemma between efficient photon harvest and high device transparency while maintaining the high transparency of the eye-sensitive region. Thus, ST-OSCs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br/PBFTT:IT-4Cl/MoO3/Au (x) were also fabricated. To obtain the optimal device performance by determining the trade-off between AVT and PCE, a series of ST-OSCs with different thicknesses of Au layers (x = 10, 15, and 20 nm) were fabricated. The J–V curves, EQE curves and transmission spectra of the related ST-OSCs are shown in Fig. 4a–c, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. Compared to normal OSCs with a high Jsc of 19.7 mA cm−2, ST-OSCs show a reduced Jsc of 15.5–17.6 mA cm−2 due to the decreased reflectivity of the thin Au cathodes.14b,18 Moreover, slightly reduced Voc (0.74 V) and FF (68.8–70.1%) were obtained for the ST-OSCs due to the increased sheet resistance of the thin Au cathodes.14b,20 In order to cater to the roll-to-roll production on the agenda, ST-OSCs with a large device area of 1.00 cm2 were also fabricated and achieved a PCE of over 7% under a high AVT of 27.6% (Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, a PCE of 7.7% is among the highest values reported in the literature to date for as-cast ST-OSCs with a device area as large as 1.00 cm2 and an AVT more than 25%.

As shown in Fig. 4c, the transmission spectra of ST-OSCs in the region of 350–900 nm were measured. The ST-OSCs show a large open spectral window in the 400–600 nm region, which covers almost all the maximum photopic sensitivity regions of the human eye. To accurately evaluate the AVT of ST-OSCs in the photopic region, we calculated it according to:18  where S, T, λ, and P are the solar energy flux (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the transmission spectrum, the wavelength, and the photopic response of the human eye, respectively. To completely encompass P, the integrations are performed over a full wavelength range of 350–900 nm, so that it is accordingly independent of any defined visible wavelength range. In this case, the AVT values decrease gradually with the increase in the thickness of the top electrode (Au, x = 10, 15 or 20 nm), and vary from 37.3% to 27.6% in the photopic region. For x = 10 nm, the ST-OSCs achieved a PCE of 7.9% under a high AVT of up to 37.3%; for x = 20 nm, the ST-OSCs showed a high PCE of up to 9.1% under an AVT of more than 25%. Fig. 4d shows the photographs of the library of Soochow University without/with the ST-OSCs with different thicknesses of Au layers.
To evaluate the colour perception properties of ST-OSCs, the 1931 CIE (Comission Internationale de I’Eclairage) colour coordinate and correlated colour temperature (CCT) were also calculated, as shown in Fig. 4e. The ST-OSCs with different thicknesses of Au as the top electrode (Au, x = 10, 15 or 20 nm) displayed the 1931 CIE color coordinates of (0.289, 0.364), (0.288, 0.370) and (0.279, 0.362), and the CCTs of 7409, 7385 and 7923 K, respectively, which are close to the white colour point ((0.33, 0.33) and 7500 K) and imply a good neutral colour feature. Notably, PBFTT:IT-4Cl-based ST-OSCs without extra treatments can not only guarantee the high PCE and AVT values, but can also provide potential operability for large-scale production of ST-OSCs in the future, which is very rare in ST-OSCs.
3. Conclusions
In summary, an efficient ST-OSC based on a trifluorinated polymer donor PBFTT and a tetrachlorinated NF-acceptor IT-4Cl was fabricated. Due to halogenation, the photovoltaic materials show higher extinction coefficient and stronger crystallinity, PBFTT shows lower electronic energy levels, and IT-4Cl shows a red-shifted absorption spectrum. Moreover, the PBFTT:IT-4Cl pair shows matched energy levels, complementary absorption spectra in the NIR region and a good blend morphology. As a result, the as-cast OSCs based on PBFTT:IT-4Cl achieved a high PCE of 11.1% with a high Jsc of 19.7 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 73.9%. Owing to the complementary absorption in the NIR region, high EQE values between 600 and 830 nm and a favourable transparency window between 400 and 600 nm, the as-cast ST-OSCs showed PCEs of 7.8–9.1% under high AVTs of 37.3% to 27.6% in the photopic region. The PCE of 9.1% is one of the highest values reported in the literature for the ST-OSCs without any extra treatments and with an AVT of more than 25% in the photopic region so far.
