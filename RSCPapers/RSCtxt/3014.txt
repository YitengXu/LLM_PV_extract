    , Accepted 20th May 2023First published on 22nd May 2023AbstractHighly transparent and self-cleaning ZnO nanorods (NRs) and ZnO@TiO2 core–shell (CS) nanoarrays were fabricated using the sol–gel dip-coating technique. TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were coated as a shell layer over the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRs. The number of shell layers on the ZnO NRs was varied by modulating the number of dipping cycles from 1 to 3 to optimize their transmittance. The optimized CS nanoarrays with two dipping cycles display a 2% enhancement of optical transmission compared to the ZnO NRs. In addition, superhydrophilicity (contact angle ∼of 12°) stimulates the self-cleaning nature of the thin films. A water contact angle of 12° was noted for the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle sample, indicating their superhydrophilic nature. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the pristine ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays was tested under UV and direct sunlight through the dye degradation of methylene blue (MB). Based upon the TiO2 morphology and accessibility of the ZnO@TiO2 heterojunction interface, CS nanoarrays with two shell layers exhibit the highest degree of dye photodegradation efficiency of 68.72% and 91% under sunlight and UV light irradiation, respectively. The CS nanoarrays demonstrate medium sunlight and excellent UV-light-driven photocatalytic activity. Our findings suggest that the ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays are potential photocatalysts for dye degradation and self-cleaning applications in solar cell coverings.
1. Introduction
Glass is extensively utilized in solar modules to protect active parts from heavy rain, wind, humidity, dust storms, etc.1 The glass cover allows sunlight to reach the active layer of the device to a maximum extent because of its high transmittance. The performance of solar cells under natural conditions substantially decreases owing to dust deposition and organic contaminants on the cover glass. Deposited dust on the covering layer of the solar module reduces the photoelectric conversion efficiency by absorbing and transmitting the light falling on it.2 Hence, minimum human intervention and easy cleaning with an anti-reflective coating are prerequisited for optimum power generation from the prevailing solar modules.
The application of the anti-reflective coating on the glass cover of photovoltaic (PV) panels is an efficient strategy to achieve maximum power output. Various metal oxides have been used comprehensively to fabricate self-cleaning coatings on the cover of a solar module.3–5 In particular, ZnO, TiO2, SiO2 and WO3 metal oxides are widely explored self-cleaning materials owing to their high transmittance, excellent photocatalytic activity and good anti-reflective properties.6–8 Among these, TiO2 and ZnO are the most extensively studied semiconductors due to their easy synthesis, natural abundance and less toxicity to the natural environment.9–12 TiO2 is an effective self-cleaning material due to its outstanding stability, magnificent photocatalytic behaviour and super hydrophilic nature. Specifically, anatase TiO2 is more suitable owing to its large number of reactive facets, which improve the effectiveness of the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic effect is the disintegration of dirt adsorbed on the outer surface of the film with the help of light.13 Other than photocatalytic behaviors, the hydrophilicity of TiO2 is crucial for self-cleaning applications. The superhydrophilicity of titanium is ascribed to the photoreduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ states. It takes place at O2 vacant sites of the TiO2 surface, where preferential adsorption of hydroxyl groups occurs, which further results in the complete wetting of the coated surfaces.14
Despite facilitating excellent photocatalytic and superhydrophilic properties, the optical transparency of the TiO2 NPs limits their application due to their wide bandgap and high refractive index.15 This prevents a considerable amount of incident light from reaching the active layer solar module. Developing porous materials and bifunctional layers on the glass cover may overcome the low transmission problems. ZnO NRs have been explored extensively owing to their unique structure, porosity and single crystalline phase inside each NR, which effectively enhances charge, light transportation, and photocatalytic activity.16 But ZnO is unstable as it is easily dissolved in both acid and base solutions.13 According to the reports, composite materials are generally more effective than materials in their pure form.17 The interaction between two oxides results in the formation of new active sites and enhanced specific surface area. Fabrication of heterostructures such as ZnO@TiO2 with a thin coating of TiO2 on the ZnO NRs has been reported to improve stability and overcome corrosion problems.18,19 The coating of TiO2 NPs on the ZnO NRs is very effective as TiO2 layers protect the ZnO NRs from photocorrosion, which is highly vulnerable compared to its pure form. The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure can be enhanced by proper alignment of the energy levels of the individual materials. The energies of the band edges of ZnO and TiO2 are almost alike.20–22 Therefore, the photocatalytic reaction of the heterostructure is improved by the transportation of photogenerated electrons of TiO2 to the conduction band (CB) of ZnO NRs and holes travel from ZnO to the valence band (VB) of TiO2.23,24 Due to the efficient charge separation, the carrier recombination rate of the heterostructure is significantly suppressed.
So far, several research groups have reported the fabrication of ZnO@TiO2 CS for numerous applications like dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),25 UV photodetectors,9 and photoelectrochemical reactions,7etc. Wang et al.13 successfully synthesized ZnO NRs coated with a layer of TiO2 nanosheets to form ZnO@TiO2 NR arrays on an FTO substrate. They also concluded that TiO2 coatings on highly crystalline ZnO NRs improve the chemical stability, photocatalytic activity and hydrophilicity of the pure ZnO NRs. But, the transmittance of the FTO substrate itself is ∼80% and after coating with ZnO and TiO2, transmittance reaches only up to 85%. Chen et al.26 prepared a ZnO/TiO2 composite on glass substrates for self-cleaning applications. They reported that the water contact angle of the film is less than 5° without UV treatment. 78.1% of organic pollutants (MO) are degraded using ZnO/TiO2 composites. Fateh et al.27 have also reported the synthesis of ZnO@TiO2 CS coatings on a polycarbonate polymer. They achieved better transmittance than Wang et al. However, the application of a polycarbonate substrate is still limited to a specific industry. Several methods such as electrospinning coupled with pulse deposition,28 spray pyrolysis,29 sol–gel processing30 and chemical vapour deposition31 have been used to fabricate TiO2-coupled ZnO NRs. Most techniques rely on high temperatures and sophisticated and expensive equipment usage. Sol–gel is a cost-effective, non-vacuum technique involving polycondensation and hydrolysis.32 In this work, we use the sol–gel route, particularly for the following characteristics: low cost, ease of compositional control, good homogeneity and optical tuning. Notably, the sol–gel technique is prevalent in producing controlled thicknesses and morphologies on several substrates.33 Self-cleaning materials possess excellent hydrophilicity, high photocatalytic activity, anti-reflective properties and good adhesion to substrates. Hence, a low-cost self-cleaning coating on easily available low-cost substrates is the primary requirement for industry use with excellent photocatalytic activity and high transmittance.
This work reports on the fabrication of TiO2-covered ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays with a variable shell thickness of TiO2 NPs on the glass substrate. Herein, we have employed low-cost and simple sol–gel dip-coating techniques to develop a controlled thickness of TiO2 NPs over the ZnO NRs. Firstly, the hydrothermal method was used to fabricate high-quality and vertically aligned ZnO nanorods. Secondly, the dip-coating technique was used to coat TiO2 nanoparticles on the ZnO NRs with shell layers varied from 1 to 3 cycles to cover the NRs. The annealed ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarray was characterized using FESEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, PL and Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure was investigated through MB dye degradation. Furthermore, the hydrophilicity of the ZnO@TiO2 CS system was measured using a Drop Shape Analyzer (DSA). The optical transmittance of the CS structure is also investigated for application in solar cells.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Materials
Zinc acetate dihydrate [(CH3COO)2Zn·2H2O, 98% purity] (ZAD), 2-propanol [(C3H8O), 99% purity], acetone [(C3H6O), Emplura grade, 98% purity], zinc nitrate hexahydrate [(Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), 98% purity], hexamethylenetetramine [(C3H12N4), 99% purity] (HMT), and sulphuric acid [(H2SO4), Emparta ACS grade, 98% purity] were purchased from Merck Chemicals. 2-Methoxyethanol, [(C3H8O2), 99% purity], and monoethanolamine [(C2H7NO), 98% purity] (MEA) were procured from Alfa Aesar. Titanium isopropoxide [Ti(C4H9O)4], the titanium precursor, was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water (DI) was utilized throughout the experiment to prepare aqueous solutions. Glass substrates were cleaned using ultrasonication treatment in piranha solution for 2 hours followed by DI water, acetone, and ethanol each for 20 minutes. Cleaned and wet glass substrates were left overnight in an oven at 60 °C to dry in natural ambient conditions.
2.2. Fabrication of ZnO NRs
A 2-step process was followed to grow ZnO NRs on borosilicate glass substrates. Firstly, the seed solution was prepared by adding 0.5M ZAD in 20 mL of 2-methoxyethanol, followed by dropwise addition of MEA to stabilize the solution mixture. The above reaction was stirred for 2 hours at 60 °C in a water bath. A homogeneous and transparent solution was obtained and kept for ageing for 24 hours. The seed layer was synthesized by coating the seed solution on glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds using a spin coater. After each coating layer, the substrates were preheated at 300 °C for 10 minutes to remove inorganic impurities. This process was repeated four times to obtain the required thickness of the film. The synthesized films were annealed at 500 °C for one hour to get a highly adhered seed layer. Secondly, an equimolar amount of ZnH and HMT was added to obtain an aqueous solution. ZnO NRs were grown by dipping the seed layer upside down in an aqueous solution for 5 hours at 90 °C. After five hours, the grown NRs were removed from the growth solution and washed with DI water to remove organic residuals from the film surfaces.
2.3. Fabrication of ZnO@TiO2 CS
To prepare the aqueous solution for coating the TiO2 shell layer, a certain amount of titanium isopropoxide was dissolved in isopropanol and stirred at 1000 rpm for 2 hours. The dip-coating technique was performed to obtain a shell layer on the previously grown ZnO NR array. The ZnO nanorod array was dipped into the solution and drawn out at a constant velocity of 100 mm min−1 using a dip coating apparatus that allows precise velocity control. The thickness of the shell layer can be controlled using the pickup velocity. The dipping velocity has no significance to the thickness of the film. The overall reaction of the shell layer can be written as: Ti(C4H9O)4 + 4H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 4C4H9OH(1) Ti(OH)4 →TiO2 + 2H2O(2)For optimization, two more dipping cycles were used to coat the TiO2 layer over the ZnO core, following the same procedure as the first cycle. The samples with 1, 2 and 3 dipping cycles of TiO2 coating over the ZnO core are named as ZnO@TiO2: 1 cycle, ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle and ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle. A schematic diagram of the experimental procedure of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS fabrication is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) for better understanding. The preparation of seed layers using the spin-coating technique and growth of ZnO NRs using the hydrothermal method are shown at the top of the diagram, and the coating of the shell layers over the ZnO NRs using the dip-coating process is shown at the bottom of the image.
2.4. Materials characterization
The structural properties of the CS nanoarrays were recorded by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Smart lab) equipped with a fixed monochromator on the diffracted beam side. Continuous film scans were carried out between 10–70 2θ degrees at a scan rate of 4 degrees per minute with a 0.02 step size. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) (ZEISS Supra 55 model) was used to visualize the morphology and perform elemental analysis of the nanoarray films. In addition, the chemical composition of the nanoarrays was studied by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 500 versa probe III). The optical study of the samples was investigated by a UV-Vis-NIR double-beam spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 5000). Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the sample were recorded using micro-Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Scientific, France, LabRAM HR-UV-Open). High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with a Thermo scientific Talos F200X G2 200 kV. The topography and surface roughness of the films was recorded using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) (Multimode 8, Bruker corporation). Water Contact Angles of the films were determined by a Drop Shape Analyzer (KRUSS DSA 25) using DI water droplets under ambient conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties

3.1.1 XRD. 

Fig. 1(a) depicts the XRD pattern and crystallinity of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays with varying the number of dipping cycles of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) over the ZnO NRs. The detected diffraction peaks of the grown ZnO NRs confirm their hexagonal wurtzite structure, which agrees with ICDD card no. 00-005-0664. The narrow and sharp diffraction peak at 34.48° corresponding to (002) indicates that the ZnO NRs are vertically oriented along the c-axis with good crystallinity. The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 31.89°, 34.44°, 36.25°, 47.54°, 56.56° and 62.86° correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) planes of bare ZnO NRs respectively. For the ZnO@TiO2 CS structure, two weaker peaks at 25° and 48° corresponding to the (101) and (200) planes were observed upon increasing the shell layer from one to three. The peaks of the (101) and (200) planes confirm the presence of anatase TiO2 NPs, which is also confirmed by the TiO2 (anatase) ICDD card no. 00-021-1272. The crystalline phase of TiO2 significantly affects their photocatalytic behaviour. As per reports, anatase is the most photocatalytic active phase of TiO2.34 This result agrees well with the HRTEM data of the CS nanoarrays Fig. 3(c), which shows a TiO2 nanocrystal coating of a thickness of approximately 5–6 nm over the ZnO NRs. It can be inferred from Fig. 1 that as the number of TiO2 shell layers increases, the intensity of plane (101) rises, which can be attributed to the increased thickness of TiO2, which is also confirmed by the FESEM image. An intense peak is observed for the core–shell ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle at 48.72° corresponding to the (200) plane, which confirms the anatase phase of TiO2. Similarly, a prominent peak appeared at about 56° for the ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle sample, corresponding to the (211) plane of anatase TiO2. In addition, the crystallite size (D), lattice parameters, strain (ε) and dislocation density (δ) are obtained from the following equations: (3) (4) (5) (6)Here, K signifies the Scherrer constant (0.9), the wavelength of the X-ray source is represented by λ, β represents the full width at half maximum and θ represents Bragg's diffraction angle.

The crystallite size of the ZnO NRs and CS ranges between 15 to 24 nm. The crystallite size of the core–shell structure reduces with the addition of TiO2 NPs compared to ZnO NRs, which can be explained by the Zener pinning effect.32 According to this effect, the increase of grain size is confined by retarding force initiated from crystal imperfections like vacancies and interstitials.35


3.1.2 Raman spectroscopy. 
Raman spectroscopy is an efficient method to confirm the crystallinity, structure and defects in the nanostructure materials. Fig. 1(b) depicts the Raman spectra of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS samples. The synthesized ZnO NRs have a hexagonal structure which belongs to space group P63mc (no. 186). The characteristic peak of the E2 high Raman mode at 437 cm−1 confirms the hexagonal phase of the ZnO NRs.36,37 The peak associated with the second-order Raman mode is situated at 331 cm−1, which arises due to the E2–E1 vibrational modes.38 The peak at 586 cm−1 indicates the E1 (LO) mode, which is further related to different defects in the ZnO NRs, like oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitial defects. A small peak at 661 cm−1 is owing to acoustic overtone.39 Furthermore, the primitive cell of the TiO2 with anatase phase consists of two-unit cells. TiO2 belongs to a tetragonal crystal structure with space group 141 (I41/amd). Based on the group theory, six Raman active phonon modes are obtained; A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg.40 After coating TiO2 on the ZnO NRs, an intense peak near 143 cm−1 confirms the anatase phase of TiO2 and a small peak at 440 cm−1 is due to the hexagonal phase of ZnO.41 The respective peaks at 144, 197 and 638 cm−1 are assigned to the Eg vibrational mode of the TiO2.42,43

3.2. Morphological properties
The top and cross-sectional FESEM images of the pristine ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarray thin films on borosilicate glass substrates are presented in Fig. 2. The ZnO NRs with a diameter of approximately 170 nm show defined facets with hexagonal structures along the c-axis. The average diameter of the NRs is calculated utilizing ImageJ software. The cross-sectional image of the ZnO NRs shows good verticality to the surface of the seed layer. Interestingly, it is evident from the top view of the image that there is a clear gap between the NRs, which is vital for TiO2 shell formation.25 In addition, we attribute the increase in diameter of the NRs and the formation of rougher surfaces to surface modification of the ZnO NRs with TiO2 NPs. For the TiO2 shell layer formation over the ZnO NRs, there is a slight change in the morphology after one dipping cycle. It is visible from Fig. 2(c) that a clear gap between the nanorods and TiO2 hardly covers some parts of the ZnO nanorod arrays. This discontinuous covering of TiO2 over the ZnO NRs does not improve significant charge transfer at the interfaces. On increasing the shell layer up to 2 cycles, Fig. 2(e) shows a clear linkage between the nanorods through TiO2 nanoparticles, which is beneficial to improving charge transfer that would increase the photocatalytic activity. Further increasing the TiO2 NPs layer up to 3 cycles, Fig. 2(g) shows that TiO2 forms a very thick layer on the ZnO core that is detrimental to the transmittance of the core–shell structure, which is undesirable in self-cleaning applications. However, the formation of a shell significantly increases the roughness and length of the nanorods, which confirms the formation of the TiO2 shell layer. The shapes and sizes of the nanoparticles play a significant role in creating outer surface roughness. Moreover, the surface roughness of the NRs is very beneficial in self-cleaning applications. The nano-roughness of the core–shell structure diminishes the contact area between the top surface and accumulated dust, further reducing the attraction force.

Two-dimensional (2D) (5 μm × 5 μm) and three-dimensional (3D) (5 μm× 5 μm) surface micrographs of thin films were analyzed by AFM in tapping mode. The topographical images of the core ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Nanoscope analysis software (version 1.40) calculated the surface roughness of the films, which was found to be 26.82 nm, 16.73 nm, 8.06 nm and 14.28 nm for the ZnO NRs, ZnO@TiO2: 1 cycle, ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle and ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle, respectively. The higher roughness value of the ZnO NRs is attributed to the large crystallite size of the ZnO NRs, which is also confirmed by XRD analysis. As the TiO2 shell layer increases, the surface roughness of the NRs also decreases due to the smaller crystallite size of the covering shell. With the rise of the TiO2 shell layer, the surface roughness increases, which may be attributed to the aggregation of some TiO2 NPs on the NR arrays.
3.3. HRTEM analysis
For confirmation of the ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarray fabrication as well as a better and in-depth understanding of the morphology and crystallinity of CS, HRTEM and SAED analysis were performed. The thickness of the film has a significant impact on the self-cleaning application. The greater thickness of the film may lead to a reduction in light transmission. The transmission spectra of the sample ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle exhibit the highest transmission among the other samples. Hence, sample ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle is considered as a suitable sample for the HRTEM study. Fig. 3(a) and (c) illustrate the HRTEM images of the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle sample. Fig. 3 (c) shows that the ZnO NRs are fully covered with TiO2 nanosheet-like structures, similar to the FESEM image. It is visible from the figure that the formation of a continuous TiO2 NPs layer with an average thickness of 5–6 nm occurs. It is believed that the TiO2 NPs tend to fill the void spaces between the nanorods to reduce the surface energy, which increases the CS structure's stability, which is very beneficial in anticorrosion of the sample when exposed to the environment. Moreover, the interplanar spacing (d) has been calculated and the corresponding planes are compared with the XRD data. From Fig. 3(a), the d-spacing was measured as 2.49 Å and 2.69 Å, which corresponds to the (101) and (002) planes of the ZnO NRs. In addition, an interplanar spacing of 3.56 Å was also found, which matches with the (101) plane of TiO2Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(b) represents the SAED pattern of ZnO@TiO2. The SAED patterns were also analyzed to find different planes of CS. In addition, the HAADF-STEM elemental mapping is presented in Fig. 3(d), which shows the presence of Zn, O and Ti. It also exhibits the cluster sizes and precise atomic distribution of Zn, O and Ti.44 The elemental mapping image of Zn, Ti and O atoms is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

3.4. Photoluminescence spectra
The PL spectra of the pristine ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays were measured at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. This gives an idea about the defect level, transfer, and recombination process of the photogenerated charge carriers. Fig. 4(a) depicts the PL spectra of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays with varying TiO2 shell layers. The PL spectra of the samples have two distinct emission bands. The first peak at 380 nm originated because of the near band emission (NBE) of excitons.45 However, the second peak has a wide distribution range of 440 nm to 820 nm with a band centered at 626 nm, which arises due to the presence of different types of defect levels in the ZnO NRs, which contributed to the emission spectra in the visible region (deep-level emission (DLE)).46 The intensity of DLE is much higher than the NBE, indicating the higher defect level concentration present in the ZnO NRs. Furthermore, the DLE intensity of the CS samples keeps decreasing by increasing the TiO2 shell coating cycles. This may be attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers by forming type-II band alignment of TiO2/ZnO CS. However, a well-known fact is that the broad spectra are the combination of many peaks, so the broad peak of the samples is deconvoluted for better insight into the present defect levels in the synthesized samples. For the prominent appearance of peak locations throughout the emission spectra of ZnO, deconvoluted PL spectra are depicted in Fig. 4(b). The first peak at 526 nm is due to the recombination of the electrons in the singly ionized oxygen vacancy (V+O) to the holes in the VB.47 The green emission centered at 0.91 eV below the CB arises due to the V+O. In addition, the yellow emission center (1.18 eV below the CB) is situated at 576 nm, which indicates the presence of doubly ionized oxygen vacancies (V++O) in the synthesized ZnO NRs. The yellow emission band results from the recombination of electrons from the V++O to the holes in VB. The third peak (619 nm) is associated with the orange emission band, is because of oxygen interstitial (Oi) defects and occurs primarily due to the presence of TiO2 NPs on the ZnO NRs surface.48 Also, this peak is constant with the intra-gap states formed from Ti4+ ions, which are adjacent to oxygen vacancies (Oi). The red emission centered at 661 nm is owing to the transition from zinc interstitial (Zni) defects, situated 1.38 eV below the CB. The peak at 766 nm is due to electron transition from the Zni to the Oi.49Fig. 4(c) presents the energy level plot to better understand the defect states and their positions. From the PL curve, quenching in emission intensity is observed with an increase in the TiO2 shell layer in the visible region of the solar spectrum. From Fig. 4(a), the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle sample has the lowest intensity peak, which indicates the least carrier recombination rate. This is further attributed to the surface defect passivation after TiO2 NPs deposition on the ZnO NRs. Due to surface coating, some modification in the ZnO surface is expected, leading to the change in the radiative recombination involving the surface defects.9,50 This observation guarantees the significance of the TiO2 shell layer in decreasing the recombination of charge carriers.

3.5. XPS analysis
XPS investigation uncovered the surface composition, oxidation state, and defects of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle samples. Broad survey scan spectra of both the pristine ZnO and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays have a carbon peak at binding energy 284.5 eV, which is attributed to the presence of carbon atoms because of sample annealing at high temperature or exposure to the natural environment. The existence of carbon atoms at the surface is in the form of C–OH or C–O–C groups.49,50Fig. 5(a) depicts the XPS survey scan of the ZnO NRs. The presence of zinc and oxygen atoms in the survey scan of the ZnO NR sample supports the formation of ZnO NRs. Survey scan of the ZnO@TiO2:2 cycle sample Fig. 5(b), confirms the presence of Zn, O and Ti elements in the CS heterostructures. This suggests that no impurity is introduced during the fabrication process.

Zn 2p core level spectra. 

Fig. 5(e) and (f) show the core-level Zn 2p spectra of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycles sample. The Zn 2p core-level spectra exhibit two distinct peaks centered at binding energy 1044.41 eV & 1021.26 eV and 1044.70 eV & 1021.63 eV for the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS, respectively. The peak at lower binding energy identifies the Zn 2p3/2 states and at higher binding energy Zn 2p1/2 states. The 2p state of zinc is attributed to the Zn2+ oxidation state of the ZnO core and ZnO@TiO2 CS. The spin–orbit splitting energy separation is estimated to be 23 eV, which agrees well with the reported value of Zn 2p orbitals in ZnO.51,52


O 1s core level spectra. 

Fig. 5(c) and (d) illustrate the O 1s core-level spectra of pristine ZnO and ZnO@TiO2, respectively. The O 1s spectra of both samples were deconvoluted and resolved into two Gaussian peaks. From the O 1s core-level spectra, the intense peak at 529.25 eV is attributed to lattice oxygen bonded to Zn+ or Ti+ ions (i.e., Zn–O and Ti–O) in ZnO and ZnO@TiO2, respectively. The shoulder peaks at 530.35 eV are attributed to OH groups at the surface. In addition, the presence of OH groups can be ascribed to water adsorption on the ZnO and ZnO@TiO2 surface during exposure to air. The second deconvoluted peak at lower binding energy explicitly describes the number of oxygen ions (cations) present in the oxygen-deficient region, which further determines the density of oxygen vacancies.7,53–56


Ti 2p core level spectra. 
The Ti 2p core-level spectra of ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays are presented in Fig. 5(h), where solid curves illustrate the measured data. Moreover, Ti 2p core-level spectra are fitted by a Gaussian peak fit with a sum of two peaks positioned at ∼457.1 eV and ∼462.9 eV, which are photoelectrons from Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 core levels,57 respectively. As per the literature, standard peaks of Ti 2p are located at 464.3 eV and 458.5 eV corresponding to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 states, respectively.58 These corresponding peak shifts may be due to the size of the particles and the effect of the interface between the ZnO NRs and TiO2 NPs.54
Upon coating TiO2 nanoparticles onto the ZnO nanorods, shifting of the Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 peaks towards lower binding energy has been observed. The comparative peak shift of the Zn 2p high-resolution spectra of ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS are depicted in Fig. 5(g) and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The shifting of the XPS peaks can be explained by the different electronegativity of interacting ions and the strong interaction between nanocrystals.59 The electronegativity of Zn2+ is 0.165 and that of Ti3+ is 1.45, and thus Zn2+ can absorb electrons from Ti3+ which makes Zn2+ more electron rich and increases the shielding effect on Zn2+.60 Hence, the Ti 2p peaks shift towards higher binding energy and the Zn 2p peaks towards lower binding energy. The electron transfer from Ti to Zn may be in the Ti–O–Zn bonds at the interface between ZnO and TiO2, which is also confirmed by TEM analysis. This result shows that there may be strong interactions between ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles in the ZnO@TiO2 heterostructure.61,62
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lines at different g values accurately confirm the existence and status of oxygen/zinc/titanium vacancies in materials. Fig. 4(d) presents the EPR spectra of the ZnO nanorods and ZnO@TiO2 core–shell structure. It is visible from the EPR spectra that there are g signals around 1.9794 and 1.9369 for the ZnO nanorods and 1.9780 and 1.9358 for ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycles have been observed. For the ZnO sample, although attribution of the g signal around the 1.9794 peak is still highly controversial, it is ascribed to a singly ionized surface oxygen vacancy (Vo), whereas the peak at g = 1.9369 is ascribed to the presence of a zinc vacancy (VZn).63,64 Similarly, for the core–shell sample, the g signal at 1.9358 may be due to Ti3+ and zinc vacancies, whereas the g signal at 1.9780 is due to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies.65 As shown in Fig. 4(d) inset, the EPR spectra of the ZnO@TiO2 core–shell nanorods have higher intensity than the ZnO nanorods indicating that the ZnO@TiO2 core–shell has more oxygen vacancy defects.

3.6. Photocatalytic activity

Fig. 6 shows the absorption spectra of the MB dye solution under UV and direct sunlight irradiation in the presence of ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS heterostructure catalysts. The corresponding kinetic study of the catalyst is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). At 664 nm, a distinct peak of MB dye has been observed with varying light exposure times. The absorption spectra of MB dye degradation are calculated using the following equation: (7)where η represents the degradation efficiency, C0 shows the concentration of the dye at t = 0, and C defines MB dye concentration at a specific exposure time t. The decomposition of MB dye on TiO2 and ZnO follows the first-order kinetic rate equation: (8)where k is the kinetic rate constant. Moreover, the kinetic data were obtained from absorbance spectra by fitting the logarithm concentration ratio with the function of time. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the time evolution of MB dye decolorization in the presence of all catalysts under UV and sunlight irradiation. The calculated degradation efficiency and kinetic rate constants are tabulated in Table 2. The coating cycle of TiO2 on the ZnO NRs is observed to influence the photocatalytic activity of the zinc oxide NRs. It has been perceived that the degradation efficiency of ZnO@TiO2 CS under UV and direct sunlight significantly increases without any significant effect on the overall bandgap of CS. This can be ascribed to the passivation of the ZnO NR surface by titanium atoms, suppressing the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers. This is beautifully explained in the photocatalysis mechanism.

The degradation efficiency of ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays is significantly higher than that of the ZnO NRs. This can be attributed to improve charge carriers' separation, which results in a better lifetime of charge carriers. The ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle has the highest degradation efficiency under both UV (91.04%) and direct sunlight (68.72%), which can be attributed to the least charge recombination compared with other photocatalysts. PL studies explain the reduction of charge carrier recombination after applying a TiO2 shell layer in Section 3.5, in which sample ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle shows better charge separation. The presence of oxygen vacancy defects also affects the degradation efficiency of the photocatalysts. Fig. 4(d) shows that the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle sample has a more intense g signal than the ZnO nanorods, and exhibits a core–shell structure and has a greater number of oxygen vacancies compared to the ZnO nanorods. As the oxygen vacancy defects increase, the bandgap of the heterostructure becomes narrower.60,66 The presence of denser oxygen vacancy defects in the core–shell nanoarrays also modifies their electronic band structure, and hence narrows the bandgap energy, and enhances visible light absorption. It is also believed that a greater number of oxygen vacancies strengthens the O–Ti–O bonds and further shifts the valence band maxima upwards and increases the visible light absorption. The visible light absorption of the core–shell structures can be attributed to the increase in the photocatalytic efficiency.
The charge separation of a CS structure is illustrated by the charge transfer diagram of the heterostructure and illustrated in Fig. 7(c). Table 2 shows that the core–shell structure exhibits a significant increase in the degradation efficiency under sunlight compared to pure ZnO and TiO2 under UV light irradiation. The improvement in the efficiency of the core–shell structure is much better than reported in the literature.8,67
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the pristine ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle are further analyzed in 1M KOH electrolyte to understand the interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers. Fig. S6 (ESI†) depicts the Nyquist plot of the ZnO and ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle samples. The arc of the plot represents the interfacial charge transfer and recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers at the photocatalyst/electrolyte interface.68 A photocatalyst with smaller arc diameter indicates a faster charge transfer through the interface and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers.69 It is observed that the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle sample has a smaller semicircular diameter than the ZnO NRs, which indicates faster charge transfer, efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lower carrier recombination rate of the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle photocatalyst. After the construction of a heterostructure, an electric field is generated at the interface, which drives the separation of photogenerated charge to different materials and lowers the carrier recombination rate.70 This results in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle heterostructure sample.
3.7. Photodegradation mechanism
In this mechanism, when the ZnO@TiO2 CS heterostructure is photo-induced with photonic energy (hν) greater than or equal to the excitation energy, electrons (e−) in the filled VB jump to the empty CB, leaving behind holes in the VB. These photogenerated charge carriers migrate to the surface of the ZnO NRs and TiO2 nanosheets and participate in a redox reaction with the help of different active sites.71–73 Herein, at first, the hole oxidizes moisture or water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). After that, MB dye reacts with these radicals to produce colourless byproducts. Meanwhile, electrons react with oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O2˙−) and hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen vacancy at the surface acts as an active site to generate superoxide radicals. These superoxide radicals react with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl ions. Eventually, these powerful oxidizing hydroxyl radicals attack the adsorbed pollutants on the heterostructure surface to produce green compounds such as H2O, CO2, and other mineral acids.
Besides the above mechanism, recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers also takes place, i.e., a significant amount of charge carriers does not participate in photocatalytic activity. Unfortunately, 90% of e−/h+ pairs recombine rapidly after generation due to the bulk oxygen vacancies (Vo)bulk in the ZnO lattice. In solution, a ZnO@TiO2 heterostructure is fabricated to reduce this recombination rate and to utilize the charge carriers to enhance photocatalytic activity. When a sufficient amount of photons illuminate the heterostructure, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the CB of TiO2 to the CB of ZnO, as the CB of TiO2 is situated at a less negative energy level in comparison to the CB of ZnO (Fig. 7(c)). In the opposite path, holes travel from the VB of ZnO to the VB of TiO2. A built-in electric field is generated at the interface from TiO2 to ZnO, which prevents the recombination of the charge carriers. Hence, with the addition of TiO2 on the ZnO NRs, the recombination rate is significantly reduced, which is also confirmed by the quenching of the PL intensity and higher dye degradation efficiency of the ZnO@TiO2 core–shell heterostructure. The overall reaction of the degradation process of MB dye in the presence of ZnO and ZnO@TiO2 is: (9) (10) ZnO, TiO2(h+VB) + H2O → ZnO, TiO2 + OH˙ + H+(11) ZnO, TiO2(h+(VB)) + OH− → ZnO, TiO2 + OH˙(12) OH˙ + Dye → colourless degradation byproducts(13) ZnO, TiO2(e−(CB)) + O2 → ZnO, TiO2 + O2˙−(14) (15) O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙(16) HO2˙ + HO2˙ → H2O2 + O2(17) ZnO, TiO2(e−(CB)) + H2O2 → OH˙ + OH−(18) Pollutant + OH− → colorless byproducts(19)However, owing to the smaller energy level difference in the reduction potential of oxygen to superoxide radicals (O2˙−) (−0.284 eV vs. NHE) and the energy levels of the lower edges of the TiO2 CB (about −0.5 eV vs. NHE at pH = 7) and ZnO (about −0.63 eV vs. NHE), the reducing power of CB electrons of these semiconductors is relatively low and the decolorization process of MB more likely occurs via oxidation by holes from the VB.
3.8. Self-cleaning
An in-depth understanding of the hydrophilicity of films is gained through calculating the water contact angle (WCA) by employing a drop shape analyzer. Fig. 8(a–e) depicts the WCA of ZnO, TiO2 and ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays. The TiO2 and pristine ZnO NRs show medium hydrophilicity, whereas ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays exhibit superhydrophilic nature. The surface roughness of the films plays a decisive role in finding the wettability of the nanostructure.74 Our results show that ZnO NRs have the highest contact angle among the four samples, which can be attributed to the highest surface roughness of ZnO, obtained by AFM analysis. Applying TiO2 as a shell layer on ZnO NRs leads to a decrease in the contact angle, which is ascribed to the reduction of the surface roughness. The order of water contact angle is ZnO NRs (37.3°) > TiO2 (32.6) > ZnO@TiO2: 1 cycle (25.8°) > ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle (20.2°) > ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle (12.0°). Furthermore, applying more layers on the ZnO NRs increases the surface roughness (sample ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle), which can be attributed to the agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles above the ZnO NRs. The hydrophilic nature of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and anti-reflective coating of solar modules is essential for automatic and manual cleaning with water as an external source. The self-cleaning area of the anti-reflective coating has minimal surface-dust contact area, reducing the adhesive force between the surface and contaminants. Thus, accumulated dust adheres stronger to water than the structured layer, aiding the water to carry the contaminant particles to drain them off the surface. Upon irradiating under UV light for 60 minutes the water contact angle of ZnO, TiO2 and all heterostructure samples reduces close to 0°.
 Fig. 8  Contact angle of (a) ZnO NRs, (b) ZnO@TiO2: 1 cycle, (c) ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle, (d) ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle and (e) TiO2, and (f) transmittance of the ZnO NR and core–shell samples. 
Transmittance has a remarkable impact on self-cleaning applications. Fig. 8(f) depicts the transmittance spectra of the ZnO NRs and ZnO@TiO2 CS. It has been reported that the bare glass substrate shows 89.9% transmittance.6 After growing ZnO NRs on the glass substrate, the transmittance improved up to 90.60% approximately throughout the whole spectrum (400–800 nm) owing to their unique NR-like structure, which reduces the refractive index of the films. After coating TiO2 NPs on the ZnO NR arrays, the transmittance of CS increases from 90.6% to 91.4%. However, coating of TiO2 with a higher number of cycles on the ZnO NRs increases the thickness of the shell layer, filling the gap between the NRs, and may increase the refractive index and decrease the transmittance.75 That is why sample ZnO@TiO2: 3 cycle shows a decrease in the transmittance even lower than bare glass substrates.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a fast and simple procedure is considered to synthesize ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays for self-cleaning applications as a TCO layer in solar cell modules. After the vertical development of ZnO NRs on borosilicate glass substrates using hydrothermal methods, a TiO2 shell was deposited by dip-coating techniques. It was observed that pristine ZnO NRs are highly porous and avail enough space between the NRs to get covered by titanium shells. The thickness of the coated TiO2 shell on the ZnO NRs increased gradually with an increasing number of deposition cycles. The XRD result and Raman mode confirmed the presence of anatase titanium on the pristine ZnO NRs. Due to the porous morphology of the ZnO NRs, up to 2 cycles of TiO2 deposition, the transmittance increased slowly; however, on further TiO2 deposition, there is a sudden decrease in transmittance, which can be attributed to the high thickness of the shell layers. The hydrophilicity of the films was compared and the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle has the lowest contact angle (12°). The optical transmission of the ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle CS nanoarray demonstrates the highest transmittance of ∼91.6%, with an average transmittance greater than the uncoated glass and other coating nanoarrays. The self-cleaning photocatalytic behaviour of these coatings has been tested by investigating the degradation of MB dye solution in the presence of UV and sunlight. Sample ZnO@TiO2: 2 cycle exhibits the highest MB dye degradation rate of 68.72% and 91.06% under sunlight and UV light irradiation. The decomposition of MB dye shows that the photocatalytic activity strongly depends on the accessibility of the dye solution to the ZnO/TiO2 interface. The anatase titanium with optimum shell thickness on ZnO NRs favours efficient charge separation and reduces the charge recombination rate, which further enhances the photocatalytic activity. It can be concluded that ZnO@TiO2 CS nanoarrays can be a potential material for better self-cleaning properties and photocatalytic activity under sunlight irradiation.
