    , Accepted 16th December 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractConjugated polymers with fluorine substituents on their backbone have exhibited improved performance over their un-fluorinated analogues by lowering the polymer HOMO level, thereby increasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC). To further investigate how fluorine substituents improve device performance, three polymers with the same donor and acceptor co-monomers, but differing by the number of fluorine atoms on the acceptor unit, were synthesized. Although the HOMO levels of the mono-(P1F) and di-fluorinated (P2F) polymers are essentially the same, an increase in VOC was still observed in the OPV device incorporating P2F. This implies that correlating the VOC to the donor polymer HOMO level is inadequate to fully explain the improvement in VOC. By calculating the charge transfer exciton binding energy from the measured film dielectric constant, it was found that the increase in VOC in going from P1F to P2F matches the decrease in charge transfer exciton binding energy.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) using π-conjugated polymers as the light-harvesting electron donor have shown promise as a low-cost and low-carbon renewable energy source. To achieve OPVs with high efficiencies, efforts have been devoted to develop π-conjugated polymers with enhanced optical and electrical properties to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and ultimately, the power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–5 Recently, π-conjugated polymers with fluorine atoms as substituents on the polymer backbone have been shown to greatly enhance the performance of several high performing polymers.6–9 Since they are strongly electron-withdrawing, fluorine atoms lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of a given π-conjugated polymer when compared to its non-fluorinated counterpart.4,6,10 Because the VOC of OPV devices is primarily determined by the energy difference between the HOMO of the electron donor and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electron acceptor, an enhanced VOC is expected in conjugated polymers with fluorine substituents. This effect has been proposed as the main factor for the performance improvement observed in OPVs containing fluorinated polymers.6,10–12 Besides lowering the HOMO of conjugated polymers, fluorine substituents have also been reported to play a role in enhancing JSC, VOC and FF of OPVs by: (1) reducing bimolecular recombination and (2) increasing the charge dipole moment thereby suppressing geminate recombination.10,13–15
To obtain a better understanding of the working principle of fluorine substituents on the donor polymer on the VOC of OPVs, and to separate out the effect of how lowering the HOMO of the donor polymers affects the VOC, we synthesized the following three polymers, PBnDT-DPNT P0F, PBnDT-DPfNT P1F and PBnDT-DPffNT P2F (Fig. 1), which were designed to have approximately the same HOMO levels while having a differing number of fluorine groups. Both material properties and their optimized OPV devices were characterized. Despite the minimal difference between the HOMO levels of P1F and P2F, P2F showed an enhanced VOC in OPVs. This enabled the investigation of the fluorine substituents' impact on the VOC beyond that of shifting the donor polymer HOMO level. A quantitative relationship between the fluorine substitution and VOC was built by using a more precise equation including the charge transfer exciton binding energy.

All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or VWR and used as received unless otherwise specified. Molecules 1,165,16917 and 1018 were synthesized according to previous literature procedures. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance DPS-300 spectrometer. Mass spectrometry was performed using a Hewlett-Packard 5971A gas chromatograph and Bruker Bi flex III MALDI-TOF (both positive and negative ion reflector mode). The molecular weights of the polymers were measured using a Viscotek TDA 305 with a polystyrene standard (room temperature, THF as eluent). The absorption spectra were measured using a Perkins-Elmer Lambda-9 spectrophotometer.

General procedure for the polymerization
All the polymers were prepared by a similar procedure. To a Schlenk flask was introduced compound 10 (753.5 mg, 0.5 mmol), corresponding acceptor monomer 4, 8, or 9 (0.5 mmol), and anhydrous chlorobenzene (4 mL). The solution was flushed with nitrogen for 10 min, and then a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium(0) (8.6 mg, 3 mol%) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (22.9 mg, 15 mol%) was added into the solution. After the resulting flask was degassed thrice via a freeze–pump–thaw cycle, the mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 48 h. Then, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and added into methanol dropwise. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was then concentrated and precipitated into methanol. The solid was filtered and dried under vacuum for 1 day.

Polymer films for cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization were prepared by spin coat 4 mg mL−1 polymer solution in chlorobenzene onto a clean ITO substrate. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted in acetonitrile with 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate using a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. ITO, Ag/AgCl, and Pt mesh were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode respectively. Films for photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and UV-vis were coated using the same conditions mentioned above but on glass substrates. PESA measurements were recorded with a Riken Keiki AC-2 PESA spectrometer with a power setting of 5 nW and a power number of 0.5. A Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer was used for UV-vis measurements.
Fabrication and characterization of BHJ devices
ITO/glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were covered by a 30 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS by spin coating. After annealing in air at 140 °C for 10 min, the samples were cooled to room temperature. Polymers were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) at a concentration of 4 mg mL−1 and PC61BM was added to reach the optimized ratio (1:3). The solutions were then heated at 90 °C and stirred overnight. Prior to deposition, the solutions were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and the substrates were transferred into a glovebox. The photoactive layer was then spin-coated at different speeds to get a thickness about 100 nm. The aluminum cathode (100 nm thick) was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask under high vacuum about 4.0 × 10−7 torr. Devices were then tested using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit, and an Oriel Xenon lamp (450 W) coupled with an AM1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated with a calibrated standard silicon solar cell with a KG5 filter which is traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used in all the measurements in this study. Devices parameters were obtained by taking the average of 15 devices for each sample. Films for capacitance measurements were prepared on SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrate using the same procedure used for the fabrication OPV devices. The capacitance of each film was recorded with Agilent HP 4278A by applying a small voltage perturbation (20 mV rms) and sweeping frequencies from 1 MHz down to 20 Hz.
Result and discussion
Prior to their synthesis, density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level were performed to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers.19,20 To minimize computing time, dimers of P0F, P1F and P2F were used and methyl groups replaced the alkyl chains for the simulation. The calculated HOMO and LUMO of the optimized structures are summarized in Fig. S1.† The calculated HOMO energy levels are −4.76 eV, −4.78 eV and −4.80 eV for P0F, P1F and P2F respectively (Table 1), which made them potentially good candidates to probe the origin of VOC improvement upon fluorinating the acceptor unit. After polymer synthesis, the HOMO levels and band gaps of P0F, P1F and P2F films were measured using UV-vis spectrometry (Fig. 2(a)), CV (Fig. 2(b)), and PESA (Fig. S2†). The characterization results are summarized in Table 1.

The UV-vis of all three polymer thin films are shown in Fig. 2(a). Each of them shows an absorption band between 400 and 500 nm, and a second band between 500 and 700 nm. The first band can be attributed to the π–π* transition, while the band with lower energy is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-rich and electron-deficient monomers.19 Moreover, from the absorption edge of the thin films, it can be seen that their optical band gaps (Eg,opt) are nearly identical with values around 1.80 eV (Table 1). The small differences in the absorption spectra after fluorine substitution were previously reported in PBnDT-FTAZ and PTB4 as well,6,21 although in PCPDT-DFBT, the addition of fluorine atoms were found to cause a blue shift in the absorption spectrum.21
CV was employed to determine the HOMO energy levels (Fig. 2(b)). The HOMO energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation potential versus Ag/AgCl using the equation EHOMO = −(4.8 − E1/2,Fc/Fc+ + Eox,onset) eV. Stable and reversible oxidation behaviour was observed for all three polymers, revealing their p-type semiconductor nature. The HOMO energy levels of P0F, P1F and P2F were found to be −4.98 eV, −5.07 eV and −5.08 eV, respectively (Table 1) using CV. Although the HOMO energy level differences between P0F and the other two polymers are larger than the estimated values obtained using DFT, the HOMO energy levels of P1F and P2F are essentially the same. To further confirm the HOMO levels, films of all three polymers were characterized by PESA (Fig. S2†). The same 0.01 eV difference between P1F and P2F HOMO levels was still observed. The energy levels of all three polymers are summarized in Fig. 3. The PC61BM energy levels were previously reported and obtained using CV.22,23 To be consistent with the PC61BM energy levels, we will be using HOMO levels obtained using CV for the rest of the discussion.

Optimized OPVs were fabricated by spin-coating polymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend solutions (1:3 ratio) in chlorobenzene onto indium tin oxide coated glass (ITO) with a pre-coated PEDOT:PSS layer. After drying in a nitrogen atmosphere overnight, the active layer thicknesses of photovoltaic devices were approximately 100 nm. Fig. 4(a) shows the J–V characteristics of OPVs containing the three polymers. The device parameters are summarized in Table 2. All the device parameters increase upon addition of a fluorine atom on the polymer backbone. In most previously reported systems, the PCE enhancement of polymers with fluorine substituents was mainly due to either an increase in VOC10–12 or an increase in JSC and FF.24,25 However, in our case, all three parameters increased with each subsequent fluorine atom addition. The JSC increased from 6.37 mA cm−2 in P0F to 6.52 mA cm−2 in P1F and to 6.84 mA cm−2 in P2F. Although the absorption of all three polymers is similar between 500 nm and 700 nm (Fig. 2(b)), the EQE (Fig. 4(b)) of the P2F device is the highest, while P0F and P1F devices show almost identical EQEs in that region. Dark current curves were also obtained. The excellent fit to the modified Schockley equation confirms the validity of our measured VOC (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). Table S1† also lists the ideality factor, n, and the shunt resistance, Rsh, for all three devices. The similarity between the numbers shows that the extent of recombination is similar in all three devices.

The change in VOC is surprising considering that all three polymers had similar HOMO levels. The VOC of the devices increased from 0.832 V in P0F to 0.872 V in P1F and to 0.914 V in P2F. It increased by approximately the same amount (∼0.04 V) with each additional fluorine substitution. If the VOC is only related to energy difference between the LUMO of acceptor and the HOMO of donor,26,27 the change in VOC that we observe cannot be explained because they have nearly identical HOMO levels.
In order to further reveal the influence of fluorine substituents, a more precise relationship between the VOC and energy levels of the active layer materials by using the concept of a charge transfer (CT) state is needed:28–30 (1)where EALUMO is the LUMO energy level of acceptor, EDHOMO is the HOMO energy level of donor, ECTEB is the binding energy of charge transfer exciton (CTE), q is the elemental electron charge and C is a constant only related to illumination and temperature, which can be mainly attributed to voltage losses at the interface.30 The CTEs can be thought of as being the precursor to the free carriers where a binding energy (ECTEB) must be overcome to form the free carriers. Moreover, the ECTEB can be estimated by:31 (2)where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, εr is the relative average dielectric constant of the active layer and r is the radius of average initial CTE after charge transfer.31
The relative dielectric constants of P0F, P1F and P2F pure and blends films were calculated from the capacitance of each film on 300 nm SiO2 layer (Fig. S4†). The ECTEB for each polymer was then estimated using the calculated relative dielectric constants and using r = 1.5 nm which is common in OPVs29,30,32 although this value is expected to vary to a certain extent for each polymer. The ECTEB values and VOC of all devices are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that after adding the second fluorine, the relative dielectric constant of the blend film increased by 1 unit compared to a 0.2 increase by adding the first fluorine. As a result, the ECTEB in P2F:PCBM blend film has the lowest value of 0.18 eV, while the ECTEB for both P0F:PCBM and P1F:PCBM films are over 0.2 eV with values of 0.23 eV and 0.22 eV, respectively. According to eqn (1), as the ECTEB decreases by 0.04 eV from P1F to P2F, the VOC of their devices should increase by 0.04 V, which is very close to the difference in experimental values (0.042 V). Moreover, because a lower ECTEB facilitates free carrier generation, the lower ECTEB also explains the higher EQE values between 500 nm and 700 nm in P2F:PCBM devices. Changes in ECTEB obtained from measuring bulk film properties and EALUMO − EDHOMO alone are insufficient to explain the VOC difference observed between the P0F and P1F based devices. In this case, the change in VOC may be a result of the change in local dipole moment that is observed when a fluorine atom is introduced.13

Conclusions
In summary, three conjugated polymers with 0, 1 and 2 fluorine substituents on the polymer backbone were synthesized. The HOMO levels of P2F and P1F were found to be nearly identical, and an enhancement VOC was still observed in their PVs. By further investigating the VOC change with a model involving the CTE binding energy, it was revealed that in addition to increasing VOC by decreasing the HOMO levels of polymers, fluorine substituents are also able to affect the VOC of OPVs by lowering the CTE binding energy.
