    , Accepted 21st September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractChalcogenides are an important class of materials that exhibit tailorable optoelectronic properties accessible through chemical modification. For example, the minerals kesterite, stannite, and velikite (Cu2MSnS4, where M = Zn, Cd, or Hg, respectively) are a series of Group 12 transition metal tin sulfides that readily exhibit optical bandgaps spanning the Shockley–Queisser limit; however, achieving consensus on their structure (space group I vs. I2m) has been difficult. This study explores the average long-range and local structure of Cu2HgSnS4 and evaluates the parallels of M = Zn and Cd sister compounds using complementary X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The 63/65Cu NMR spectra were acquired at multiple magnetic field strengths (B0 = 7.05, 11.75, and 21.1 T) to assess the unique chemical shift anisotropy and quadrupolar coupling contributions. They reveal two inequivalent sets of Cu sites in Cu2ZnSnS4, in contrast to only one set of sites in Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4, clarifying structural assignments previously proposed through X-ray diffraction methods. The presence of these Cu sites was further supported by DFT calculations. The 119Sn and 199Hg NMR spectra suggest that an ordering phenomenon takes place in Cu2HgSnS4 when it undergoes annealing treatments. The trend in measured optical band gaps (1.5 eV for Cu2ZnSnS4, 1.2 eV for Cu2CdSnS4, and 0.9 eV for Cu2HgSnS4) was confirmed by electronic structure calculations, which show that the band gap narrows as the difference in electronegativity is diminished and that Hg–S bonds in Cu2HgSnS4 have greater covalent character.
1. Introduction
Multinary chalcogenides have elicited interest for various materials applications, and among these, Cu2ZnSnS4 has stood out as a promising photovoltaic material because it has a direct band gap of appropriate magnitude (1.5 eV), a high absorption coefficient (104 cm−1), and a composition derived from inexpensive and earth-abundant elements.1–4 The power conversion efficiency of Cu2ZnSnS4 is relatively high (9%), but much remains to be done before it can rival conventional materials such as Si (>20%). It has become very popular to suggest new photovoltaic materials through first-principles calculations and machine learning algorithms;5,6 such prognostications are facile to make but hardly ever tested through experiment. Among various strategies to increase the efficiency, substitution of Zn in Cu2ZnSnS4 with Cd and Hg has been proposed,7–12 even though this entails new risks of toxicity that will eventually need to be mitigated. Some calculations indicate that the “spectroscopically limited maximum efficiency” could reach as high as 25% for Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4.11,12 Of course, the reliability of such predictions depends on the accuracy of the crystal structures assumed,13 and in our opinion, further experimental evidence would be beneficial. In an actual solar cell fabricated from a Cu2Zn0.6Cd0.4SnS4 absorber, the partial substitution of Zn with Cd led to small improvements in efficiency (11%).7,8
Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4 have long been known to adopt tetragonal structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Fig. 1).14,15 All metal atoms lie within tetrahedral sites located on the z = 0, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 planes. For Cu2ZnSnS4 (space group I), there is broad consensus that the Cu atoms occupy two sets of sites (2a, 2c) which lie within all planes, although disorder of Cu and Zn atoms is possible depending on preparative conditions.16 For Cu2CdSnS4 (space group I2m), the Cu atoms occupy one set of sites (4d), which lie within alternate planes.17,18 For Cu2HgSnS4, two structural models have been reported having site distributions similar to that of Cu2CdSnS4, with Cu atoms lying in alternate planes but with subtle differences. From powder XRD data, Kabalov et al. proposed that the Cu atoms occupy two sets of sites (2c, 2d) in I.19 From single-crystal XRD data, Kaplunnik et al. proposed that the Cu atoms half-occupy one set of split sites (8h at 0, 1/2, 0.2498) in I2m, but the splitting is so small that merging them into fully occupied unsplit sites (4d at 0, 1/2, 1/4) is clearly a better description, corresponding to the same structure as Cu2CdSnS4.20 The key distinction is that the Cu–S distances fall into two sets (2.23 Å and 2.42 Å) in the Kabalov model, but one set (2.26 Å) in the Kaplunnik model.
 Fig. 1  Structural models for Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4. Two models have been proposed for Cu2HgSnS4 distinguished by the presence of two Cu sites in I vs. one site in I2m. 
Given that Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4 exhibit different site distributions, solid solutions derived from them are likely to complex site disorder, as observed in Cu2Zn1−xCdxSnS4, for example.9,21 As a complementary method to confirm the site distributions established from earlier structural determinations on the parent compounds, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides valuable information on the local environments around specific atoms, as has been demonstrated for (Cu1−xLix)2ZnSnS4, Cu2Zn1−xCdxSnS4, and Cu2ZnSn(S1−xSex)4, among other semiconducting and catalytic compounds.22–27
To clarify the site distributions, we report here an analysis of the 63/65Cu, 119Sn, and 199Hg NMR spectra for Cu2HgSnS4 and compare these results to our recent work on Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2CdSnS4.23 Furthermore, a full analysis of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and electric field gradient (EFG) tensors are presented for the first time.23,28 The effect of annealing in Cu2HgSnS4 was probed by XRD and NMR measurements. Optical band gap measurements and electronic structure calculations were also performed on Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
Starting materials were Cu powder (99.5%, Alfa-Aesar), Zn granules (99.9%, Baker), Cd powder (99.5%, Alfa-Aesar), HgS powder (99%, Alfa-Aesar), Sn powder (99.9%, Cerac), and S flakes (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich). Stoichiometric mixtures of these substances were prepared with the loading compositions Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4. The mixtures were ground together, pressed into pellets, and placed within carbon-coated fused silica tubes, which were evacuated and sealed. For Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2CdSnS4, the tubes were heated to 250 °C over 5 h, held there for 2 h, heated to 800 °C over 18 h, held there for 4 d, and then cooled to room temperature over 24 h. For Cu2HgSnS4, the tubes were heated to 250 °C over 5 h, held there for 2 h, heated to 700 °C over 15 h, held there for 2 d, and then cooled to room temperature over 24 h. The slightly lower annealing temperature was used in the synthesis of Cu2HgSnS4 as a pre-emptive measure to minimize volatilization losses of HgS, which has a relatively low boiling point of 584 °C. The samples were ground, pressed into pellets, and subjected to a second heat treatment at 800 °C for 4 d (for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2CdSnS4) or 700 °C for 1 d (for Cu2HgSnS4). This treatment ensures that the samples are pure phase.
2.2. XRD and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
Powder XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα1 radiation source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Unit cell parameters were refined, and Le Bail profile fitting was applied using the FullProf suite of programs.29 Samples were examined on a Zeiss Sigma 300 VP field-emission scanning electron microscope, operated with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, and their elemental compositions were obtained by EDX analysis.
2.3. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
Optical diffuse reflectance spectra were measured from 200 nm (6.2 eV) to 2000 nm (0.6 eV) on a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer, with a polytetrafluoroethylene disc having >98% reflectivity used as a reflectance standard. The reflectance spectra were converted to optical absorption spectra using the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R) = α/S = (1 − R)2/2R, where α is the Kubelka–Munk absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient, and R is the reflectance.30
2.4. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy
Solid-state 63/65Cu, 119Sn, and 199Hg NMR spectra were collected on Bruker Avance Neo 300 (B0 = 7.05 T), Avance III HD 400 (B0 = 9.40 T), Avance Neo 500 (B0 = 11.75 T), or Avance II 900 (B0 = 21.1 T) spectrometers equipped with double resonance H/X magic-angle-spinning (MAS) Bruker probes, with experimental details listed in Table 1. Samples were ground and packed into 4 mm outer diameter (o.d.) ZrO2 rotors sealed with Kel-F caps, or 2.5 mm o.d. and 1.3 mm o.d. ZrO2 rotors sealed with Vespel top and bottom caps. The non-spinning NMR spectra at 21.1 T were acquired using a home-built 4 mm solenoid probe (pure Ag R.F. coil to minimize probe background from Cu metal). The spectra were processed using the Bruker TOPSPIN 4.0.6 software package with 100–300 exponential apodizations and they were fit using the Dmfit31 program to extract various NMR parameters. Reference standards were CuCl(s) (0 ppm for 63/65Cu NMR), (C6H11)4Sn(s) (−97.5 ppm for 119Sn NMR, which corresponds to 0 ppm for (CH3)4Sn), and HgF2(s) (−2826 ppm for 199Hg NMR).32–34

As a reminder, NMR spectra are typically characterized by features based on the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and quadrupolar coupling interactions, which are tensor quantities.35–44 The lineshape of an NMR signal is described by its isotropic chemical shift, δiso = (δ11 + δ22 + δ33)/3, its span, Ω = δ11 − δ33, and its skew, κ = 3(δ22 − δiso)/Ω. For nuclei having I > 1/2, the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant is CQ = eQVzz/h (where e is the elementary charge, Q is the quadrupolar moment of the nucleus, Vzz is the largest principal component of the electric field gradient (EFG), and h is Planck's constant) and the asymmetry parameter is η = (Vxx − Vyy)/Vzz (where |Vxx| ≤ |Vyy| ≤ |Vzz|).
2.5. Quantum Chemical Computations
The magnetic shielding and EFG (I > 1/2) tensors were calculated using the program CASTEP,45 which applies a gauge-including projector augmented plane wave basis set suitable for periodic structures and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in the generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation energy.46–48 Ultrasoft pseudopotentials and zeroth-order regular approximation relativistic effects were applied. Calculations were carried out with an extreme accuracy basis set, a maximum plane-wave energy of 500–566 eV, and a Monkhorst-Pack grid of 4 × 4 × 20 k-points for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2CdSnS4 or 20 × 20 × 10 k-points for Cu2HgSnS4. The computed magnetic shieldings were converted to chemical shifts, δ(ppm) = σcalcref − σcalcmodel, using SnO for 119Sn (σcalcref = 2802), HgF2 for 199Hg (σcalcref = 6261 ppm) and Cu2HgSnS4 for 65Cu (σcalcref = −7 ppm). The 63/65Cu isotropic chemical shift was set to 815 ppm in Cu2HgSnS4 (I2m).
The electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) were calculated using the projected augmented wave method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.44), with the generalized gradient approximation parameterized by PBE used to treat exchange and correlation.46,49–51 The recommended standard Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Sn_d, and S potentials were used, with the plane-wave basis cutoff energy set to 400 eV. The first Brillouin zone was sampled by a 9 × 9 × 5 k-point grid. The convergence criteria were set to 10−6 eV for electronic optimization, and |−2 × 10−2| eV for ionic relaxation. To correct for the underestimation of the PBE band gap, a hybrid HSE06 functional (PBE:Hartree–Fock = 65:35) was applied. Spin–orbit interactions were not considered to reduce computational cost. Chemical bonding was examined by evaluating projected crystal orbital Hamilton populations (–pCOHP), electron localization functions (ELF), and Bader charges, using the program LOBSTER (version 3.2.0).52
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure
Samples of Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4, which were prepared at 700–800 °C, were confirmed to be single-phase from powder XRD patterns (Fig. 2) and to have compositions in good agreement with expectations from EDX analyses (Table S1 in ESI†). From Le Bail fittings of the powder XRD data (Fig. S1 in ESI†), the refined tetragonal cell parameters were found to agree well with literature values (Table S2 in ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Powder XRD patterns for Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2CdSnS4, and Cu2HgSnS4. 
The unit cell volume expands on proceeding from Cu2ZnSnS4 to Cu2CdSnS4, and then is little changed in Cu2HgSnS4, in accordance with trends in typical distances for Zn–S (2.3–2.5 Å), Cd–S (2.3–2.8 Å), and Hg–S bonds (2.3–2.8 Å). The c/2a ratio serves as a useful measure for the degree of tetragonal distortion in these structures. For Cu2ZnSnS4, this ratio is essentially unity (0.997–0.998). For Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4, this ratio is perceptibly smaller (0.97–0.98), giving rise to slight splitting of peaks in the powder XRD patterns, the most prominent being seen in the 220 and 204 peaks near 47° in 2θ. There are occasional statements made in the literature that this splitting offers direct evidence for structural assignments (i.e., site distributions and space groups), but such pronouncements are misguided.
To examine the local environments around atoms in more detail, NMR spectra were analyzed for these compounds (NMR fitted parameters are summarized in Table 2).

3.2. Local structure around Sn
The Sn atoms occupy one set of sites at 2b (0, 0, 1/2; 1/2, 1/2, 0) in Cu2HgSnS4 similar to the Sn sites found in both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2CdSnS4 compounds. They are surrounded in the first coordination sphere by four S atoms in tetrahedral geometry and in the second coordination sphere by eight Cu and four M atoms, but the arrangement of these atoms differs in Cu2ZnSnS4vs. Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4. These different environments were examined by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy (I = 1/2; 8.6% natural abundance; Ξ = 37.29%),53 which is a highly sensitive technique showing a wide diamagnetic chemical shift range of up to 6000 ppm.54–57 The single resonance seen in the 119Sn MAS NMR spectra for all three compounds is consistent with the presence of a unique Sn site, with the isotropic chemical shift (δiso) in Cu2ZnSnS4 (−120.9 ppm) found at a significantly lower frequency than in Cu2CdSnS4, δiso = −81.5 ppm and Cu2HgSnS4, δiso = −89.8 ppm (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The non-spinning 119Sn NMR spectra, which provide information about the CSA tensor, show that the span is narrow in Cu2ZnSnS4 (30 ppm), but wide in Cu2CdSnS4 (110 ppm) and Cu2HgSnS4 (113 ppm) indicating a less symmetric Sn environment (Fig. 3). The skew is negative for Cu2ZnSnS4 (−0.45), but positive and close to unity for both Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4 (+0.95), indicating axially symmetric CSA tensors with δ33 as the unique component. These results can be understood in terms of the tetrahedral coordination around the Sn sites by S atoms, which form nearly ideal angles in Cu2ZnSnS4 (109.5°), but show deviations in Cu2CdSnS4 (108.7–109.8°) and Cu2HgSnS4 (100.0–114.4°).18,20,58 This effect may be further influenced by the arrangement of Cu and M atoms in the second coordination sphere, which is closer to spherical symmetry in Cu2ZnSnS4, by virtue of the Cu atoms lying on all planes, in contrast to the axially symmetric symmetry in Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4, by virtue of the Cu atoms lying on alternate planes. GIPAW DFT computed CSA tensor components bisect the SnS4 tetrahedral angles with the δ11 and δ22 component found to be out of the plane of the page for Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnS4, respectively. From GIPAW DFT computations on Cu2HgSnS4, the computed span in Cu2HgSnS4 is 104 ppm (Kabalov model) or 52 ppm (Kaplunnik model), and the skew is +1, in reasonable agreement with observations.

GIPAW DFT CSA tensors, δ11, δ22 and δ33 are shown as green arrows (top). The resemblance of 119Sn local chemical environment with Cu2CdSnS4 is indicated with a □ (green), whereas the disagreement with Cu2ZnSnS4 is indicated with a X (red). The experimental NMR simulations (blue) were performed using the Dmfit software. 
3.3. Local structure around Cu
The most definitive evidence to determine the number of crystallographically inequivalent Cu sites in Cu2MSnS4 (M =Zn, Cd, Hg) was provided by the 63/65Cu NMR spectra. The first coordination sphere consists of four S atoms and the second coordination sphere consists of four Cu, four M, and four Sn atoms, but in different arrangements. The 63Cu NMR spectra (I = 3/2; 69.7% natural abundance, Q = −22.0 fm2, Ξ = 26.5%)53 show two resonances for Cu2ZnSnS4 with centre of gravity shifts (δcgs) of 793 and 749 ppm, but one for Cu2CdSnS4 (δcgs = 753 ppm) and Cu2HgSnS4 (δcgs = 810 ppm) (Fig. 4). These observations confirm the presence of two Cu sites (2a, 2c) in Cu2ZnSnS4vs. one site (4d) in Cu2CdSnS4. The occurrence of one resonance in Cu2HgSnS4 supports the Kaplunnik model in which Cu atoms occupy one site (4d), as in Cu2CdSnS4, and rules out the Kabalov model in which Cu atoms occupy two sites (2c, 2d) which differ slightly in Cu–S distances. To discount the possibility that sizeable quadrupolar interactions or poor spectral resolution could hinder the detection of additional Cu sites, MAS 63Cu and non-spinning 65Cu NMR spectra were simulated from GIPAW DFT calculations for Cu2HgSnS4 with these two models (Fig. 5). Under experimental conditions of 21.1 T, the resonances for the two Cu sites in the Kabalov model would be clearly resolvable, with moderate CQ values and distinguishable isotropic chemical shifts. Instead, these quantum chemical computations strongly favour the Kaplunnik model containing one Cu site, although they do overestimate the 63/65Cu quadrupole coupling constant.

 Fig. 5  Experimental (black) and DFT (blue) predicted (a) 63Cu MAS and (b) 65Cu non-spinning NMR spectra for Cu2HgSnS4. The parameters for the DFT predicted spectra are listed in Table 2. 
The lineshapes in the 65Cu NMR spectra (I = 3/2; 30.8% natural abundance, Q = −20.0 fm2, Ξ = 28.4%)32,53 were examined in detail because they are particularly sensitive to distortions around the Cu atoms, given the strong interaction between the quadrupolar moments of 65Cu nuclei with the local EFG.28 To investigate the effect of magnetic shielding anisotropy and quadrupole coupling parameters effectively, NMR data were acquired at three magnetic field strengths, whereby the CSA interaction is more prominent at higher magnetic fields, while the second-order quadrupolar interaction is diminished. Based on fits of the 65Cu NMR spectra at different magnetic fields (7.05, 11.75, and 21.1 T) at kHz (Fig. 6) and ppm (Fig. S3 in ESI†) scale, the CSA and quadrupolar parameters were determined (Table 2). For Cu2ZnSnS4, two resonances at δiso = 804 and 786 ppm are apparent, which correspond to the 2a (Cu2) and 2c (Cu1) sites, respectively. From the deconvoluted spectra (Fig. S4 in ESI†), the relative areas under these peaks are roughly equal, but the 2a site experiences a larger CQ (6.5 MHz) than the 2c site (1.5 MHz), which correlates with greater deviations from ideal tetrahedral angles (106.6–110.9° for 2a, 108.9–110.6° for 2c).58 The resonance for the 2a site narrows with stronger magnetic field, indicating that the quadrupolar interaction is the main factor affecting linewidth. In contrast, for Cu2CdSnS4 and Cu2HgSnS4, the 65Cu NMR spectra show single resonances dominated by CSA as the linewidth (in kHz) of the resonances increases with increasing magnetic field. Within the entire series, the maximum Ω value increases from 270 to 300 ppm on proceeding from Cu2ZnSnS4 to Cu2HgSnS4, the κ values of +1 or −1 imply that all Cu CSA tensors are axially symmetric, and the η values of 0 (or nearly so) imply that the magnitudes of Vxx and Vyy are equal, within error. CSA tensor components were coincident with the axially symmetric EFG tensor components where δ11 and Vxx are out of the plane of the page, while the Vzz (δ33) and Vyy (δ22) bisected the CuS4 tetrahedral angles.59

3.4. Local structure around Hg in Cu2HgSnS4
Although 199Hg NMR spectroscopy (I = 1/2; 16.9% natural abundance, Ξ = 17.1%)53 is a sensitive method for probing short- and medium-range environments, with a sizeable chemical shift range spanning over 5000 ppm,60 it has rarely been applied to purely inorganic compounds, such as Hg-containing chalcogenides.61,62 The 199Hg NMR spectrum for Cu2HgSnS4 shows a single resonance (Fig. 7), which is consistent with the presence of a unique Hg site (2a), surrounded by eight Cu and four Sn atoms in the second coordination sphere, in either the Kabalov or Kaplunnik models. The isotropic chemical shift is −540.9 ppm, indicating a strongly deshielded environment around the Hg atoms in Cu2HgSnS4 compared to other previously reported inorganic compounds.34,63,64 The CSA parameters extracted from fitting the non-spinning NMR spectrum agree well with computed values (Table 2), with a near axially symmetric CSA tensor (κ = +0.95) and a Ω = 183 ± 5 ppm span.

3.5. Effect of annealing
Cu2HgSnS4 was synthesized through an initial heating at 700 °C for 2 d, followed by a repeated heat treatment at 700 °C for 1 d. It is interesting to evaluate if there are any changes to the long-range vs. local structures after these treatments by examining powder XRD patterns as well as 119Sn and 199Hg MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 8). The XRD patterns were not perceptibly different. However, after the second heating, the initially broad asymmetric peaks in the NMR spectra become more Gaussian-like and narrowed significantly (FWHM decreasing from 2.6 to 1.6 kHz in 119Sn NMR spectrum, and 3.7 to 2.0 kHz in 199Hg NMR spectrum). These observations suggest that an ordering phenomenon, of uncertain origin, takes place in a short-to-medium range that is undetected by XRD. For example, we can speculate that longer annealing times improve the degree of crystallinity through further ordering of the Sn- and Hg-centred polyhedra (i.e., by reducing local distortions in bond lengths and angles); alternatively, a reduction in S vacancies could be promoted during the annealing step, which may influence the linewidths. One could further consider site mixing between Sn/Hg, creating different medium-range (i.e., second cation sphere) chemical environments for Sn and Hg, which could influence the chemical shift distributions of these nuclei. If these chemical shifts are closely spaced, they would induce peak broadening. However, significant mixing is not expected to occur due to the considerable mismatch of cation size and charge for Sn4+vs. Hg2+, although a low level of mixing (<2%) cannot be ruled out.

3.6. Optical band gaps and electronic structure
Tauc plots were derived from the optical diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S5 in ESI†). The extracted band gaps, based on the assumption that they are direct (as described below), follow a clearly decreasing trend of 1.5 eV for Cu2ZnSnS4, 1.2 eV for Cu2CdSnS4, and 0.9 eV for Cu2HgSnS4. These band gaps are consistent with the black colour of these samples65 and agree well with calculated values, for which there is no shortage in the literature.12,66 Experimental band gaps have generally been reported to be close to 1.5 eV for Cu2ZnSnS4,67,68 with variations attributed to Cu/Zn disorder which introduces tailing in the optical spectra and decreases to 1.3–1.4 eV for Cu2CdSnS4.18,69–71 In contrast, relatively less is known about Cu2HgSnS4, for which an experimental band gap of 1.3 eV was estimated from valence band XPS spectra.10
The band structure, DOS, and –pCOHP curves for these compounds were determined from DFT calculations using the hybrid HSE06 functional, which gives better estimates of band gaps (Fig. S6 in ESI†). The valence band is dominated by Cu 3d and S 3p states, and splits into lower and higher energy regions caused by the tetrahedral crystal field around Cu atoms, corresponding to Cu–S bonding and antibonding interactions, as verified by the –pCOHP curves. The bottom of the conduction band is dominated by Sn 5s and S 3p states involved in Sn–S antibonding interactions. The valence and conduction band extrema are located at the Brillouin zone centre, indicating direct band gaps, which decrease on proceeding from Cu2ZnSnS4 to Cu2HgSnS4 because the bottom of the conduction band is lowered in energy. In agreement with the experimental values (as well as previous calculations on these compounds),12,66 the calculated direct band gaps are 1.48 eV for Cu2ZnSnS4, 1.24 eV for Cu2CdSnS4, and 0.86 eV for Cu2HgSnS4.
The bonding character in these Cu2MSnS4 (M = Zn, Cd, Hg) compounds was examined through ELF plots and Bader charges (Fig. 9). The ELF plots suggest significant polar character in the bonding, with electron density strongly shifted toward the S atoms. In comparison to the charges assigned in a fully ionic formulation, (Cu1+)2M2+Sn4+(S2−)4, the Bader charges are not as extreme, but their relative values are in good agreement: 0.4+ to 0.6+ for Cu, 0.7+ to 1.0+ for M, 1.4+ to 1.6+ for Sn, and 0.8− to 1.0− for S atoms. Given the high electronegativity of Hg, the smallest electronegativity differences and the least extreme charges are found in Cu2HgSnS4; this leads to greater covalent character, as seen in the enhanced overlap of electron density in the Hg–S bonds.

4. Conclusions
Comparison of the experimental and simulated 63/65Cu NMR spectra revealed one Cu site in Cu2HgSnS4 with similar local structural parameters to Cu2CdSnS4, whereas two Cu sites are present in Cu2ZnSnS4. The CSA and CQ NMR parameters are reliably determined using multiple magnetic fields, previously lacking in the literature. These parameters agree reasonably well with the GIPAW-DFT computations, although the magnitude of the 63/65Cu quadrupole coupling constant remains overestimated. Moreover, we found that these NMR parameters correlated with small changes in the local environment and the degree of distortion around metal atoms in these compounds. The results support the structural assignments previously made from XRD methods; in particular, Cu2HgSnS4 was confirmed to be isotypic to Cu2CdSnS4, adopting the so-called stannite-type structure in space group I2m (i.e., Kaplunnik model). The 199Hg NMR spectra suggest that annealing treatments of Cu2HgSnS4 help promote ordering, on a local level that is undetectable by XRD methods. An important implication of this observation is that these small structural changes need to be considered when physical properties are evaluated for compounds prepared by different synthetic methods. The band gap follows a clearly decreasing trend from 1.5 eV for Cu2ZnSnS4 to 0.9 eV for Cu2HgSnS4, a reflection of the greater covalent character imparted by the decreased electronegativity difference in Hg–S bonds.
