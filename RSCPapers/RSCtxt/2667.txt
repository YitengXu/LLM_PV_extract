I. Introduction
In 2004, two-dimensional (2D) graphene with outstanding charge mobility and mechanical properties was obtained using an adhesive tape-assisted mechanical exfoliation method.1 However, the electronic applications of graphene are hindered because of its zero band gap. 2D semiconductors, exhibiting advantages of being small, thin, and flexible,2,3 are regarded as the cornerstone of next-generation electronic devices. In 2010, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as MoS2, WS2, and MoTe2, demonstrated potential for electrical, optoelectronic, and valleytronic applications4,5 owing to their diverse physical properties, such as a high carrier mobility, a direct band gap, and a spin–valley locking effect.6–8 Beyond transition metal dichalcogenides, semiconducting tin dichalcogenides (SnS2 and SnSe2) have been proposed for diverse electronic applications, such as photodetection,9 photocatalysis,10 and thermoelectric devices.11,12
Precisely controlled doping is critical in modern semiconductor technology because it improves the conductivity of semiconductors. Doping engineering in 2D semiconductors plays an important role in various applications. Many methods of doping strategies in 2D materials have been successfully verified, such as interfacial transfer doping,13 intercalation doping,14 electrostatic doping,15 photo-induced doping,16,17 and substitutional doping.18,19 Among these methods, substitutional doping is considered as the most established technology. Therefore, extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have focused on the effect of doping on 2D semiconductor properties.20 Because of the importance and corresponding research progress, several reviews on tin dichalcogenides have been published. For example, the intrinsic properties of SnS2, such as its crystal structure, preparation method, and phonon properties, were reviewed.21 Recent developments regarding the chemical synthesis, structural design, and application in photocatalytics of 2D materials, including SnS2 at the nanoscale, were reviewed.22 The impact of substitutional doping on the electrical and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides is comprehensive reviewed.23 However, a review focusing on substitutionally doped tin dichalcogenides and their corresponding application is still lacking.
In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advances in the substitutional doping of tin dichalcogenides. First, we discuss the general applied doping methods in tin dichalcogenides. Second, experimental work regarding metallic and non-metallic element doping is discussed, as well as the effect of doping on electrical, optical, and thermoelectric properties. Finally, we present a brief summary and outlook of substitutional doping in tin dichalcogenides.
II. Intrinsic properties
Monolayer tin dichalcogenide exhibits a sandwich structure, with a Sn atomic layer sandwiched between two chalcogen planes. The atoms within the layer are connected by strong covalent bonds, while interlayers are bonded together by weak van der Waals forces. The space group of tin dichalcogenides is Pm1. The reported experimental lattice constants for hexagonal SnS2 are a = 3.647 and c = 5.899 Å,24 and for SnSe2, a = 3.811 Å and c = 6.137 Å.25 Tin dichalcogenides are intrinsic n-type indirect semiconductors that do not exhibit magnetism. Due to the quantum confinement effect, the band gap of tin dichalcogenides increases from bulk to monolayer. The band gaps of SnS2 in the bulk and monolayer are 2.2 and 2.6 eV, respectively,26 and those of SnSe2 are 1.4 and 0.8 eV, respectively.27
Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on SnS2 have a high on/off ratio of 108 and a carrier mobility of 2.58 cm2 V−1 s−1.28 Furthermore, the drain–source tunneling in short-channel devices based on SnS2 is effectively suppressed because of the large band gap. Therefore, SnS2 has an inherent advantage in low-power FETs. The carrier mobility of FETs based on SnSe2 reaches up to 8.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is better than many other TMDCs.29 In addition, tin dichalcogenides exhibit excellent performance in the field of photodetection, such as a high responsiveness and fast response times.9,28
III. Doping methods
Substitutional doping can be divided into metal doping and non-metal doping according to the different substitution positions in tin dichalcogenides, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). There are various synthesis methods developed for 2D materials, such as chemical vapor transport (CVT), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), solid state synthesis, and the hydrothermal method. Different doping methods lead to different morphologies and qualities, resulting in various application scenarios. The characteristics of the different substitutional doping methods vary. Table 1 lists the different doping methods along with corresponding advantages and disadvantages. Some doping examples are also summarized in Table 1.

A. Chemical vapor transport (CVT)
The CVT method is a mature technique widely used for centimeter-sized crystal preparation and block doping. In particular, the low-pressure closed system is beneficial for the preparation of materials that are unstable in air and enables the direct solid-phase synthesis between volatile raw materials. Sn has a low-melting-point and is volatile at low pressure. Such characteristics suggest that Sn can act as a transport agent in the preparation of certain special materials. The starting materials tin, sulfur, selenium, and dopants are loaded into quartz glass tubes in stoichiometric ratios and then the tube is sealed under a vacuum, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The side with the reactants and the other side are placed in a high and low temperature zone, respectively. If the reactants contain a volatile transfer agent, the tube should be cooled under liquid nitrogen during the sealing process. Various foreign elements, such as Fe,30 Mn,31 Re,32 and V33 have been successfully doped in tin dichalcogenides. The high resolution scanning transmission electron microcopy (STEM) image and the Z-contrast intensity distribution demonstrate the substitutional doping of Fe at the Sn atom site from Fig. 1(c and d).

B. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
CVD is the most successful method for synthesizing 2D semiconductors because it allows the precise tuning of the final morphology, structure, and defects of the product. There have been many attempts to prepare high-quality thin layers of tin dichalcogenides by CVD. Beyond conventional CVD methods, auxiliary strategies enable preparation at lower temperatures. The addition of halogen salts or tellurium lowers the melting point of the precursor and enhances its volatility,34,35 which enables the preparation of SnSe2 films at a relatively low temperature (150 °C).36 In addition, artificial intervention at nucleation sites can achieve selective growth.37 Doping by the CVD method can be divided into two forms according to the different types of doping atoms. The difference between tin dichalcogenides and metal-doped tin dichalcogenides by CVD growth is that the precursor containing the foreign metal element should be spin-coated onto the growth substrate,38 and the gas phase doping source is usually obtained by heating the monomers [Fig. 2(b)].39
C. Solid-state synthesis
The advantages of the solid-phase method are the simplicity of the preparation method, low cost, and low risk to the environment. For the synthesis of SnS2, tin chloride hydrate and different sulfur sources have been used, such as thiourea42,43 or sublimed sulfur.44,45 The as-grown product is repeatedly washed by centrifugation to obtain the gold-colored SnS2. The advantage of using thiourea as the sulfur source is that it is free of inert gas or vacuum protection. Moreover, sublimed sulfur can also be used to synthesize SnS2 directly.44
There are two solid-state synthetic strategies to achieve doping in tin dichalcogenides, one of which is shown in Fig. 2(c). Sn, heteroatoms, and S/Se are first mixed in a stoichiometric ratio. The mixture is then heated at high temperature under vacuum to obtain the bulk product.40 The other strategy is to select the corresponding chloride first, and then heat at a lower temperature. Taking Fe-doped SnS2 as an example,46 the selected raw materials are SnCl2·2H2O, FeCl2·6H2O, and thiourea. Nitrogen gas is then applied to protect the reactants. The reaction temperature and time are 280 °C and 3 hours, respectively. Finally, the powdery product has to be washed several times with distilled water to remove (NH4)2SnCl6.
D. Hydrothermal synthesis
Hydrothermal synthesis is a method of synthesizing materials by mild chemical reactions in a sealed solution at high pressure and high temperature. The advantages of this method are a controlled reaction, lower temperature, uniform distribution, and reduced atmospheric pollution. Hydrothermal synthesis has been widely used for the preparation of tin dichalcogenides. The process of doping by the hydrothermal method is schematically shown in Fig. 2(d). Usually, a solution containing the foreign atoms is chosen in the growth process. For example, Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O or Cu(NO3)2 can be used as dopants for the growth of Cu-doped tin dichalcogenides.41,47
E. A comparison of the four growth methods
The four different doping methods have different characteristics, resulting in different morphologies and properties of the as-grown tin dichalcogenides. Fig. 3 shows the typical morphologies of the as-grown samples formed by using the four doping methods. Both CVT and CVD can grow high-quality tin dichalcogenides [Fig. 3(a) and (b)]. Centimeter-sized single bulk tin dichalcogenides can be grown by the CVT method. Monolayers can be obtained by mechanical or liquid peeling from bulk tin dichalcogenides. The CVD method enables the direct growth of few-layer samples with a large size, even reaching wafer scale. The samples synthesized by the CVT or CVD method are applicable for electronic or optoelectronic devices. The tin dichalcogenides synthesized by solid-state synthesis or the hydrothermal method are small. The morphology of the as-grown sample is strongly influenced by the growth temperature and the precursors. For example, tin dichalcogenides synthesized by the hydrothermal method exhibit several different morphologies, such as nanosheets,84 ribbons,85 and spheres.86 Tin dichalcogenides synthesized by the solid-state method are mostly in powder form. Tin dichalcogenides synthesized by solid-state synthesis or the hydrothermal method can be applied in photocatalytic materials,44,80 solar cells,46,67 and anode materials for batteries.45

IV. Substitutional doping in experiments
The substitutional doping of tin dichalcogenides has been experimentally achieved through different strategies and shows potential in various electronic applications, such as Hall devices, FETs, optical devices, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. For clarity, we classify substitutional doping into metal doping and non-metal doping.
A. Metal doping

1. Mg doping. 
Doping of the main group element Mg reduces the band gap and shrinks the lattice of SnS2. Since Mg has two fewer valence electrons than Sn, it is likely to introduce excess holes for the Mg-doped SnS2. It has been reported that the photocurrent density of a Mg-doped SnS2-based photodetector is significantly enhanced by a factor of about two, and can be switched quickly between the on and off states (Fig. 4(a) and (b)],78 indicating excellent photovoltaic performance. In addition, the introduction of Mg introduces carrier density and reduces the resistance of SnS2.

2. Ag doping. 
Ag is a commonly used dopant because the Ag atom has only one valence electron. A large number of holes are introduced after doping, achieving a p-type carrier. Cui et al. reported that the introduction of Ag leads to a transition from n-type to p-type SnS2.70 As shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), when an appropriate concentration of Ag atoms is introduced, the conductivity and response current density of SnS2 is significantly improved. Doping with 1% Ag can increase the conductivity from 2 S cm−1 to 60 S cm−1. Moreover, the Hall voltage decreases with the increase of the Ag content.71 Furthermore, Li et al. found that the bond energy of the Ag–Se bond is greater than that of the Sn–Se bond,88 which improves the oxidation resistance of Ag-doped SnSe2. In addition, the doping induces a band tail phenomenon, resulting in a redshift of the absorption and emission spectra.89 However, due to the larger ionic radius of Ag compared with Sn, the doping introduces great structural distortion. An excessively high Ag concentration can destroy the original crystal structure and seriously degrade the electric performance.


3. V doping. 
Vanadium, a transition metal element widely distributed on earth, has multi-valent states, such as ±1, +2, +3, +4, and +5. Therefore, V can be doped in most compound semiconductors to vary the electronic and magnetic properties of parent semiconductors. For example, V has been demonstrated as an effective electron acceptor, which alters the electrical,90,91 valleytronic,92 and magnetic properties of TMDCs.91,93,94 Similarly, V doping can also effectively modulate the band gap and electrical properties of SnS2. For example, the introduction of V can improve both its photovoltaic conversion efficiency and photoresponse current intensity.67
Recent theories have shown that a band gap of 2.0 eV is referred to as the “intermediate band” and a theoretical photovoltaic efficiency of a semiconductor with such a band gap is 63.2%.95 SnS2 has a wide optical band gap of 2.45 eV. It is reported that the band gap of V-doped SnS2 can be reduced to nearly 2.0 eV [Fig. 5(a)].67,68 For example, Wahnón et al. reported that V doping introduces an intermediate band and leads to a wider range of absorption spectra.68 Ullah et al. reported that the band gap reduces with the increase of the V doping concentration.67 The band gap of SnS2 becomes 2.02 eV with a V doping concentration of 5%. The V-doped SnS2 shows strong absorption [Fig. 5(b)] in the visible range.

The photoresponse current intensity is an important parameter of optoelectronic devices. The wider absorption range and the higher absorption coefficients are beneficial for optoelectronic device performance. The introduction of V significantly improves the performance of SnS2. Under visible light irradiation, the photoresponse current intensity of SnS2 increases with increasing V concentration. In addition, the photocurrent increases from 0.38 μm cm−2 to 0.96 μm cm−2 after 5% V doping [Fig. 5(d)]. However, different form V-doped SnS2, most studies on V-doped SnSe2 are theoretical. The limited amount of experiments have only focused on the doped crystal morphology and structure.33 In theoretical calculations, V-doped SnSe2 monolayers become half-semiconductors and have potential applications in spintronics.96 Experimentally, solid solution VxSn1−xSe2 with a V concentration of up to 50% can be prepared by the direct vapor phase transport method. The absence of new peaks in X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the space group of the crystals remains Pm1,97 and the red shift of the Raman and XRD spectra [Fig. 5(c) and (e)] indicates the substitution of Sn by V.33


4. Sb doping. 
Sb-Doping reduces the band gap of SnS2. Sun et al. reported that the band gap reduces to 0.05 eV by Sb doping, which greatly enhances the electrical conductivity, leading to the outstanding electrical performance of resulting devices.98 Theoretical calculations predicted that Sb doping introduces an intermediate band in the band gap of SnS2. The intermediate band leads to a wide optical absorption range and a high photoresponse intensity,99 which has been verified by the experimental phenomenon reported by Hu et al.55 Moreover, Liu et al. found that Sb-doped SnS2 can reduce the Schottky barrier width and, thus, lower the contact resistance.47 In addition, its mobility is more than 10 times higher than that of pure SnS2 [Fig. 6(e)]. The drain–source current (Ids)–drain–source voltage (Vds) curves of the monolayer SnS2 phototransistor at a low drain bias voltage of <0.15 V indicate the presence of a Schottky barrier at the contact [Fig. 6(a)]. In contrast, Sb-doped SnS2 monolayer phototransistors exhibit different characteristics. For example, the Ids–Vds curve of an Sb-doped SnS2 monolayer phototransistor is linear. In addition, the n-type mobility increases with increasing Sb concentration [Fig. 6(b)–(d)]. However, higher Sb doping concentrations are detrimental to the photocurrent response. Compared to a photocurrent response of 8 ms for pristine SnS2, the photocurrent response time increases to 16 ms and 24 ms [Fig. 6(f)] for Sb-doped SnS2 with concentrations of 0.34% and 1.21%, respectively.

5. In doping. 
The d orbital of In strongly hybridizes with the p orbitals of S in SnS2.100 Since In and Sn are adjacent in the periodic table and the corresponding ionic radii are close to each other, In is a good candidate for the doping of SnS2. In-Doped SnS2 has been applied in various electronic applications. The introduction of In3+ leads to the color of SnS2 changing from golden to pink, and the XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy peaks red shift. In addition, In doping introduces holes,73,74 leading to a p-type character. Li et al. investigated the performance of 0.9% In-doped SnS2 and pure SnS2 and confirmed that the In-doped SnS2 turned into a p-type semiconductor48 [Fig. 7(c) and (d)]. In addition, it was reported that the intensity of both charge transfer and photoresponse currents was enhanced considerably [Fig. 7(a) and (b)]. In doping increases the carrier density but inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the photocurrent intensity becomes stronger with increasing In concentration, but the response speed becomes slower [Fig. 7(e) and (f)]. It is unusual that the hole concentration is negatively correlated with the In doping concentration, which is attributed to the hole killing mechanism.101 Considering all factors, the best device performance is achieved for a 1.4% In doping concentration.

The doping of SnSe2 using other metals has also been reported for optoelectronic applications. For example, Pb doping led to a higher on/off ratio for FET applications.51 Re doping achieved a strong optical response in the visible range for photodetector applications.32 In addition, metal doping of SnSe2 also exhibits some novel phenomena, such as ferromagnetism induced by Bi doping,50 and superconductivity by Li doping.102 Therefore, metal-doped SnSe2 deserves to be further explored for various applications.

B. Non-metal doping
Similar to metal doping, non-metal doping also modulates the band gap of tin dichalcogenides and the corresponding electronic and optical properties. Recent studies show that the conductivity of SnSe2 can be improved by replacing the Se site with a non-metal.56,58 Here, we focus on halogen doping of SnSe2.

1. Cl doping. 
Metal–insulator transition behavior in Cl-doped SnSe2 was reported by Kim et al.57 The metal–insulator transition was attributed to the delocalization of the 5s orbital of Sn induced by excess electrons from Cl. The introduction of Cl led to a red shift of the A1g peak in the Raman spectra of SnSe2, and the shift depended on the Cl concentration [Fig. 8(a)]. Lee et al. found that when the doping concentration of Cl exceeded 0.3%, a distinct shoulder width signal appeared around 140 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum. The half-peak width and peak position of the shoulder increased and blue-shifted with the increase of Cl concentration, respectively.58 In addition, due to the enhanced phonon scattering between van der Waals layers of Cl-doped SnSe2, the thermal conductivity was effectively reduced.59,103 Therefore, the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) is significantly improved and has attracted attention in the field of thermoelectricity. With the increase of Cl concentration, the zT value at 610 K increases from 0.15 to 0.226. To enhance the zT value, an improvement of the synthesis method is required.60,82,83 The highest zT record was reported by Luo et al.,104 where 1.5% Cl-doped SnSe2 achieved an in-plane zT value of 0.63 at 673 K. In addition, SnSe2 doped as such maintained n-type semiconducting properties, which was much higher than that of pure SnSe2 [Fig. 8(b) and (c)].88,105

2. Br doping. 
Similar to Cl, the introduction of Br also increases the electron carrier concentration and induces a metal–insulator transition in SnSe2. Therefore, Br doping can effectively improve the electronic and thermoelectric properties of SnSe2.63 The introduction of Br altered the inter-atom interaction and induced a peak shift in Raman the spectrum,64 for example, the red shift of A1g at 180 cm−1, which was consistent with the Cl doping system. Since Br and Se are adjacent in the periodic table and their ionic radii are close to each other, the introduction of Br has a weak effect on the lattice of SnSe2.
Doping has been proven as a significant strategy to improve thermoelectric performance of SnSe2. Wu et al. first reported that SnSe2 doped with Br enhanced the thermoelectric properties and maintained n-type conduction.61 Pham et al. achieved a high Br doping concentration of 7.5% by the CVT method using SnBr2 as the dopant.62 The as-prepared single crystal had a zTc (zT along out-of-plane direction) of 0.54 at 673 K, which was seven times higher than that of pristine SnSe2. Kim et al. achieved a zT value of 0.62 at 750 K with a 1% Br doping concentration [Fig. 8(d)] and found that an increase of the Br doping concentration led to a higher zT value.65 The thermoelectric properties of SnSe2 co-doped with Br and Cu was investigated by Zhou et al.106 The prepared SnCu0.005Se1.98Br0.02 achieved a zT value of up to 0.67 at 773 K [Fig. 8(e)], which was better than pristine or Br-doped SnSe2 at the same measurement conditions. The doping of Br was demonstrated as a significant option for improving the thermoelectric performance of SnSe2-based devices.


3. Other non-metal doping. 
Although F can also introduce electrons to SnSe2, the electrical properties of SnSe2 doped by F are not as good as those doped by Cl or Br.11 In addition, due to the danger of handling the element F, the experimental work on F doping in SnSe2 is limited. There are some theoretical calculations regarding other non-metal doping, such as N, P, and As in the VA group, and O and S in the VIA group.107 It is predicted that N or As is difficult to dope because of the positive substitution energy in monolayer SnSe2. Although P is easily introduced in SnS2 because of the negative substitution energy, the introduced trap states in the band gap will lower the electrical and thermoelectric properties of SnS2. Because O, S, and Se have the same valence electrons, O or S doping does not change the semiconductor properties of SnSe2.108

V. Conclusion and outlook
According to experimental progress, research on doped tin dichalcogenides mainly focuses on photovoltaics and photodetection. Because n-type or p-type SnS2 can be achieved by doping with low concentrations of Ag or In, the doping strategy is of great significance for the development of 2D FETs. Because of the intermediate bands introduced by V or Sb doping, a wide light absorption range and a high light response intensity of photodetectors based on doped SnS2 can be achieved. Non-metal doping mainly focuses on the thermoelectric conversion of F-, Cl-, or Br-doped SnSe2. Although Cl- and Br-doped SnSe2 have similar thermoelectric properties, Br has a smaller effect on the original crystal lattice of SnSe2. Therefore, Br-doped SnSe2 is more promising for thermoelectric devices.
Tin dichalcogenides exhibit excellent electrical properties, an environmentally friendly character, and a low cost. Doping will improve their performance and can further expand their applications. This review focused on the application of substitutionally doped tin dichalcogenides in electrical, photodetection, and thermoelectric conversion devices. Metal doping in SnS2 not only induces an increase of the carrier density and a reduction of the band gap, but also enhances the photodetection sensitivity and intensity of the photoresponse current. Non-metal doping in SnSe2 enhances the interlayer phonon scattering, reduces thermal conductivity, and improves performance in thermoelectric conversion. The present research progress regarding tin dichalcogenides demonstrates that doping is an effective strategy to improve their electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties.
In addition to the previously described applications, theoretical studies suggest other applications of doped tin dichalcogenides, such as spintronic devices, photocatalysis, batteries, and gas sensing.109–112 It is also predicted that van der Waals heterostructures based on tin dichalcogenides enhance lithium ion storage performance.113–116 For example, high-throughput calculations predicted that magnetic monolayer SnS2 and SnSe2 can be achieved by transition metal doping, such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni.117 Fe- and Mn-doped SnS2/SnSe2 are magnetic semiconductors and have potential for spintronic applications, which have been verified experimentally.30,31,40,103,118,119 Because of the potential spintronic applications for high capacity storage and fast computing, further experimental investigations of other transition metal doping in tin dichalcogenides, such as Cr, Co, and Ni, are desired. Further potential applications of doped tin dichalcogenides, such as photocatalysis, batteries, and gas sensing, also deserve experimental verification. Though various doping strategies, such as CVT, CVD, solid-state synthesis, and hydrothermal synthesis, have been developed, high yield, low cost and universal strategy is still on demand.
