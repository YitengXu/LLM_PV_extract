    , Accepted 11th September 2018First published on 12th September 2018AbstractUtilization of “dark” triplet states is a key task for design of novel emissive organic compounds. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are two promising pathways to employ triplet excitons and reach high internal quantum efficiencies. In this paper we present a series of carbazole–pyrimidine cored compounds, showing RTP and TADF. A specific energy level scheme was shown to promote intersystem crossing and RTP in carbazole–pyrimidine derivatives with phosphorescence quantum yield values of up to 0.07 in rigid Zeonex films. The modification of the acceptor core with 2-methylthio and dimethylamine fragments allowed us to reduce the singlet–triplet energy gap, enhance the rISC (reverse intersystem crossing) rate and obtain high intensity TADF with a fluorescence quantum yield of up to 0.32. Time resolved fluorescence analysis revealed the presence of conformational disorder of the donor–acceptor core governing TADF properties in solid films. A method to control the conformational disorder by enhancing the host rigidity was demonstrated. Sky-blue electroluminescence was shown for the dimethylamino-modified compound with the most intense TADF. Our results show that carbazole–pyrimidine cored materials are versatile donor–acceptor systems for achieving RTP and TADF via simple structural modifications.
Introduction
Every three out of four excitons created in 1st generation OLED devices are of triplet nature with negligible radiative recombination rate. In this way, only singlet excitons can be used for light emission, remarkably limiting their performance. Phosphorescent compounds, containing heavy rare-earth atoms, allow triplet excitons to be employed and 100% internal quantum efficiencies to be obtained,1,2 however the stability of blue emitters still is insufficient. During the last several years, two new concepts were suggested to employ triplet excitons for light emission without the involvement of heavy atoms: TADF3,4 and RTP.5–9 In both cases triplet management was achieved via rather simple modification of the molecular core. Since the discovery of this effect, the main requirement for efficient TADF was thought to be a negligible energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet states (ΔEST), which is obtained in the compounds possessing donor–acceptor fragments with strong intermolecular charge transfer (ICT).10,11 However, later findings revealed that the mechanism behind TADF is more complex and efficient rISC requires a specific energy level scheme. According to the scheme, the lowest charge transfer singlet state (1CT) should be in the close proximity to localized and CT triplets (3LE and 3CT, respectively), which should be vibronically intercoupled.12,13 Despite the ongoing debates regarding the TADF mechanism, highly efficient electroluminescence has been demonstrated for TADF OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of about 20%11,14–17 and more (30%) by enhancing light extraction.18 The main requirement for efficient RTP is similar as for TADF: there should be at least two triplet states, separated by a low energy gap, situated below the S1 state and coupled by a spin-vibronic mechanism.19 Such an energy scheme leads to the emergence of highly efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and rISC, which surely is important only for TADF. Certainly, other important requirements should be fulfilled: materials should contain heteroatoms, should be dispersed in a rigid matrix with high triplet energy and glass transition temperature and should be composed of rigid fragments.7,19–21 However, the RTP efficiency is usually low and the RTP lifetime22 is much longer than that of TADF.23 This results in unwanted EQE roll-off24 and the application of RTP in OLEDs is still scarce.5 Nevertheless, long-lived RTP is promising for other applications, like photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, and solar cells.6,7,22,25
Since the main requirements for both RTP and TADF are the same, the possibility of easy tuning of the nature of delayed emission via simple structural modification looks promising. For example, Ward et.al.21 have shown that TADF can be converted to intense RTP by impeding the rotation of the phenothiazine fragment along the N–C bond.12 The selection of particular donor and acceptor fragments may also allow one to change the nature of delayed emission.
In this work we present a series of carbazole–pyrimidine cored compounds showing RTP and TADF. Pyrimidine–containing compounds were demonstrated to be promising for TADF applications,26–30 unlike for RTP, where their applications are still scarce.31 The conversion of RTP to TADF was achieved by altering the pyrimidine acceptor with various fragments: methyl (1a), ethyl-phenyl (1b), 2-methylthio (1c) and dimethylaminophenyl (1d). RTP and TADF properties were assessed by comprehensive analysis of time-resolved fluorescence, which revealed the presence of conformational disorder of the flexible donor–acceptor molecular core. Sky-blue electroluminescence via TADF was demonstrated for the compound with the lowest singlet–triplet energy gap.
Experimental
Absorption and emission spectra of pyrimidine derivatives were measured in 1 wt% Zeonex (polyolefin) and PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) films, prepared by drop-casting the mixture of polymer and compound dissolved in chlorobenzene on a quartz substrate at room temperature. Absorption spectra were recorded by UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer Lambda 950 (Perkin Elmer). Time-integrated fluorescence spectra were measured employing a back-thinned CCD spectrometer PMA-11 (Hamamatsu) coupled with a CW xenon lamp and a monochromator (FWHM <10 nm) as an excitation source. The fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) was estimated by using the integrating sphere method.32 Time-resolved fluorescence, fluorescence transient and phosphorescence measurements were performed using nanosecond YAG:Nd3+ laser NT 242 with an optical parametric oscillator (Ekspla, excitation wavelength 350 nm, pulse duration 7 ns, repetition rate 0.01–1 kHz) and time-gated intensified CCD camera iStar DH340T (Andor) with spectrograph SR-303i (Shamrock). The measurements were performed at 1 × 10−4 Torr pressure by exponentially increasing the delay and integration time as described in ref. 33. This allowed us to record up to 10 orders of magnitude in time and intensity of the photoluminescence decay. Temperature dependent measurements were performed in a closed cycle He cryostat (Cryo Industries 204N). OLED devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. The small-molecule and cathode layers were thermally evaporated using a vacuum evaporation apparatus (Vacuum Systems and Technologies Ltd) at 7.5 × 10−8 Torr pressure and a deposition rate of about 1 Å s−1. OLED devices were encapsulated with a clear glass cover to prevent the interaction with O2 and H2O. Device current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and electroluminescence properties were measured using an ETO TEC 100 characterization system (Orb Optronics) and a GS-1290 spectrometer (RadOMA), powered by a 2601A power supply unit (Keithley).
Results and discussion
Materials
The studied carbazole–pyrimidine cored-derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. The molecular structure is composed of an electron-accepting pyrimidine group and electron-donating carbazole groups. The pyrimidine ring at the 2nd position was decorated with methyl (1a), 4-ethylphenyl (1b), methylthio (1c) and electron-donating 4-dimethylaminophenyl (1d) groups. The sulphur-containing 2-methylthio fragment was selected to tune the ISC rate via the external heavy atom effect, while the donating 4-dimethylaminophenyl group was selected to enhance the charge transfer character.

The synthetic details and an extensive study of the optical properties of compounds 1a–d in diluted solutions were reported by us elsewhere.34
DFT calculations
Quantum chemical calculations of ground-state geometries, electronic excitation energies, oscillator strengths of the singlet transitions, and spatial distributions of electron density of frontier orbitals for carbazole–pyrimidine cored derivatives were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Gaussian 09 software package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.35 The Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) was used to estimate the solvation behaviour of toluene surroundings. Detailed analysis of the optimized geometry and HOMO–LUMO gaps of derivatives 1a–d were reported previously.34 Briefly, DFT analysis revealed that the phenyl-pyrimidine moiety is almost planar, whereas the phenyls at the 4th and 6th positions are twisted by about 16°–23° angles. The dihedral angle between phenyl and carbazole fragments was much larger (54°–55°). The electron density distribution was found to be rather similar for compounds 1a–c, i.e. the electron density was localized mostly on carbazole fragments in the HOMO and the 2,4-phenylpyridine fragment in the LUMO, which is typical for compounds with ICT. A different situation was found for 1d. Here, the electron density in the HOMO was localized over the 4-dimethylaminophenyl moiety with some extension to the pyrimidine ring, while the LUMO was very similar to that of 1a–c. In this case, the dimethylamino fragment acted as the electron donor instead of carbazole, while 2,4-phenylpyrimidine remained as the electron accepting moiety. Twisted carbazole fragments provided steric hindrance and suppression of concentration quenching in solid films.36
Calculated oscillator strengths of the S0–S1 transition and energies of the S0–S1/T1/T2 transition of carbazole–pyrimidine cored derivatives 1a–d are shown in Table 1. The oscillator strength was found to be very similar for compounds 1a–c (∼0.57), while it remarkably decreased for 1d (0.03) having the strong electron-donating dimethylamino fragment. A similar trend was observed for the S0 → S1 transition energy, which was comparable for compounds 1a–c (3.02–3.1 eV) and lower for compound 1d (2.871 eV). Reduced oscillator strength and S0 → S1 transition energy for 1d denote stronger ICT character due to the more pronounced electron-donating abilities of the dimethylamino fragment. This leads to the reduced overlap of the electron density distribution in the HOMO and LUMO and thus the smallest ΔEST of 0.245 eV. Although the calculated ΔEST values of ICT compounds can be overestimated due to the electron correlation problem in hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP,37 the clear trend for this series of carbazole–pyrimidine compounds can be observed. All the studied compounds 1a–d exhibited the same triplet energy scheme, where two the lowest triplet levels had energy lower than that of S1. Such a scheme was previously shown to be mandatory for the realisation of RTP and TADF.12,13,19 Energy level schemes of compounds 1a–1d are compared in Fig. 2a and a full list of molecular orbitals of S0 → T1/T2 transitions for all compounds is shown in Table S2 in ESI.†

Top pictures represent HOMO-like orbitals, lower pictures – LUMO-like orbitals. S0 → S1 are pure HOMO → LUMO transitions, while for S0 → T1/T2 only the dominant transitions are shown. 
As discussed above, the S0 → S1 transition (HOMO → LUMO) for compound 1d possesses strong ICT character, the same as for the S0 → T2 transition (see Fig. 2b). In contrast, the dominating S0 → T1 transition (HOMO → LUMO+1) expressed rather strong LE features. Such an energy level scheme, where S0 → S1 has 1CT character and the lower lying two triplet levels (of 3CT and 3LE character) have a low energy difference, is favourable for efficient TADF.12,13 For 1c, the energy level scheme was similar, however the dominating transitions for S0 → T2/T1 (HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO, respectively) showed weaker ICT character, indicating that less efficient TADF may be expected. The larger ΔEST estimated for the other carbazole–pyrimidine cored compounds may lead to the observation of RTP.19
Absorption and emission properties
To reveal the origin of emissive states and confirm our theoretical predictions, absorption, fluorescence and phosphorescence properties of carbazole–pyrimidine cored-derivatives 1a–d were studied in two different polarity media – PMMA and Zeonex polymer films at low concentration (1 wt%) (see Fig. 3 and Table S1 in the ESI† for details). Taking into account that Zeonex is a low-polarity polymer,38 while PMMA is more polar39 with a triplet energy of about 3.1 eV,40 the comparison of fluorescence properties in both surroundings will provide some insights into the solid state solvatochromical behaviour. A concentration of 1 wt% was selected in order to avoid concentration quenching effects.
 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption (thin solid lines), fluorescence (thick solid lines) and phosphorescence (thick dashed lines, 77 ms delay at 77 K) spectra of carbazole–pyrimidine cored-derivatives 1a–d in 1 wt% Zeonex (black lines) and PMMA (red lines) films. All spectra were normalized. 
Absorption spectra of compounds 1a–d were observed in the range of 300–400 nm in both Zeonex and PMMA. The spectra of non-polar Zeonex films contained weakly-expressed vibronic progressions with peaks in the range of 352–362 nm, while those of polar PMMA were broad and almost structureless peaking at 342–362 nm. Similarly, fluorescence spectra of compounds 1a–d in Zeonex showed vibronic structure with peak positions of 0th vibronic replica at 384–394 nm for compounds 1a–c and 435 nm for compound 1d. The vibronic progression of 1d in Zeonex was rather weak and the spectrum was quite broad. The vibronic progression disappeared and 1CT spectra were redshifted in the more polar PMMA surroundings (up to 404–420 nm for compounds 1a–c and 475 nm for 1d with stronger ICT character). Solid state solvation was found to be the strongest for 1d.
Phosphorescence spectra of compounds 1a–d peaked at about 460–477 nm in Zeonex films and 461–488 nm in PMMA films. A slight redshift of the phosphorescence peak position was observed for compound 1d. Clear vibronic progressions in the phosphorescence spectra denoted the 3LE nature of the lowest triplet state. The estimated energy gap between 1CT fluorescence and 3LE phosphorescence peak positions (ΔEST, see Table 2) for compounds 1a–c was almost the same in Zeonex (0.52–0.54 eV) and in PMMA (0.26–0.38 eV), though for 1c in PMMA it was slightly lower. For compound 1d ΔEST decreased down to 0.25 eV in Zeonex due to stronger ICT character. The exact value of ΔEST in PMMA is hard to estimate due to broad and structureless fluorescence spectra.41 The estimated ΔEST from the peak positions was of about 0.07 eV, while that from the spectral onsets was of about 0.41 eV. Despite the difficulties to estimate ΔEST, it is clear that the lowest ΔEST is for compound 1d.

Room temperature phosphorescence vs. thermally activated delayed fluorescence

Room temperature phosphorescence. 
Singlet oxygen is a well-known quencher of triplet excitons,42 thus minor impact of triplet states on the emission properties should be observed in an oxygen-saturated environment. Conversely, intense RTP or TADF is expected to emerge in oxygen-deficient conditions. Indeed, the comparison of time-integrated emission spectra in both conditions evidences the impact of triplet states through phosphorescence and TADF.
Time-integrated room temperature emission spectra of Zeonex and PMMA films of carbazole–pyrimidine cored derivatives 1a–d in oxygen-saturated and oxygen-deficient environments are shown in Fig. 4 and detailed parameters are given in Table 2. Emission spectra obtained in oxygen-saturated environments match the fluorescence spectra shown in Fig. 3. On the contrary, in oxygen-deficient environments additional peaks emerged in the range of about 450–550 nm for compounds 1a–b, coinciding with the phosphorescence spectra shown in Fig. 3 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI† for a detailed comparison).
 Fig. 4  Emission spectra of compounds 1a–d in 1 wt% Zeonex (left) and PMMA (right) films in oxygen saturated (O2+, black line) and oxygen-deficient (O2−, red line) environments, obtained under CW excitation. 
Time resolved emission analysis (see Fig. 5) revealed that the fluorescence decays during the first ∼100 ns, then after about 5 μs the long-lived low intensity (the initial intensity is about 106 times lower than that of fluorescence) phosphorescence become observable. The emission quantum yield for compounds 1a–b increased from about 0.51 to 0.58 in Zeonex and from about 0.74 to 0.81 in PMMA in oxygen-deficient environments. Phosphorescence accounted for up to 14% of the total emission of compounds 1a–b in Zeonex films and about 6% in PMMA films, thus the phosphorescence quantum yield (ΦRTP was calculated from the product of ΦVacF in Zeonex and the ratio of the integrated phosphorescence spectrum to the total integrated emission spectrum6,7) can be estimated to be of about 0.07 for Zeonex and 0.06 for PMMA films. The estimated values of RTP quantum efficiency are comparable to the values of similar molecular compounds in solid films.7,20,22 Clearly, the Zeonex polymer favoured more efficient RTP. ΦRTP was larger in Zeonex due to the different rate of non-radiative recombination caused by the different rigidity and polarity of the polymer.7–9,20,40 As it was shown by DFT calculations, both compounds 1a and b have two triplet levels below S1. Molecular systems having a T2 level situated below S1 tend to show an enhanced ISC rate.19,43 The tuning of the energy of singlet and triplet levels by ambient polarity may alter the ISC rate and ΦRTP. Additionally, Zeonex has a higher glass transition temperature and is more rigid (see Fig. S2 in ESI†), thus can more efficiently suppress the non-radiative decay through molecular vibrations, which quenches RTP.20,22 Surprisingly, the fluorescence intensity of compounds 1a–b in Zeonex films (see the range at about 350–450 nm) was higher in oxygen-rich environments than in oxygen-deficient surroundings. The relatively high population of long-lived triplets under CW excitation leads to the emergence of fluorescence quenching by singlet–triplet annihilation (STA). The fluorescence intensity decreased by about 4–5% for both 1a and 1b (STA quenching was minor for PMMA films with lower triplet concentration). Similar fluorescence quenching through STA was also shown for NPB:PMMA blends.40

(b) Normalized time resolved fluorescence spectra of compound 1a in Zeonex film at room temperature. The dashed line is the time-integrated phosphorescence spectrum at 77 K temperature. Numbers on the right side denote the delay time of every spectrum. All spectra were shifted vertically for clarity. 
A different situation was observed for compounds 1c–d. ΦF of compound 1c amounted to 0.2 and 0.3 for Zeonex and PMMA films, respectively. In this case, the presence of sulphur may cause more rapid non-radiative decay and lower ΦF due to the internal heavy atom effect. ΦF decreased down to 0.05 in both Zeonex and PMMA films for compound 1d with the strongest ICT fluorescence. However, emission intensity enhancement in oxygen-free environments for compounds 1c–d was remarkably higher, reaching up to 4.6 for Zeonex and 6.4 for PMMA due to the emergence of TADF.

Thermally activated delayed fluorescence
In order to clearly identify the mechanism of fluorescence enhancement of compounds 1c–d in 1 wt% Zeonex and PMMA films, fluorescence decay transients of films in oxygen-saturated and oxygen-free environments were measured (see Fig. 6). Both prompt and delayed emission was observed.
 Fig. 6  Log–log scale fluorescence decay transients of carbazole–pyrimidine compounds 1c (upper pictures) and 1d (lower pictures) in Zeonex (left pictures) and PMMA (right pictures) films in oxygen-rich (black figures) and deficient (red figures) environments. Blue lines are bi-exponential fits. 
Initially, the prompt fluorescence was observed during the first hundred nanoseconds, which later turned into the delayed emission, observed up to 0.1 s with multiexponential decay. The ratio of delayed and prompt emission integrals (DF/PF ratio) was as high as 2.5 for 1c and 10.8 for 1d in PMMA films, while for 1d the DF/PF ratio was lower in non-polar Zeonex films. The delayed emission portion amounted to 72% (for 1c) and 92% (for 1d) of the total emission in PMMA films and corresponded to a delayed emission quantum yield (ΦDF) of 0.43 and 0.27 for 1c and 1d, respectively. The TADF intensity was enhanced by embedding 1d into polar small-molecule host DPEPO (bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]ether oxide, see Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI†). The peak position of 1CT emission of 1d:DPEPO film was redshifted by 80 meV as compared to the peak in PMMA due to the slightly higher dipole moment of DPEPO. The more polar DPEPO surroundings favoured lower ΔEST and more efficient TADF with a DF/PF ratio of 11.41.
Temperature activation of the delayed emission for 1d in PMMA is shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† Only phosphorescence decay is observed up to about 200 K (the decay profile is the same as that of compounds 1a–b), which later turns to TADF with exponentially increasing intensity10,11 up to room temperature. The intensity of delayed emission increased linearly with the increasing laser pulse energy (see Fig. S5b in the ESI†), typical for monomolecular recombination, such as TADF. Contrary to triplet–triplet annihilation, which also could result in delayed emission, its intensity of delayed emission should increase quadratically.44,45 Additional proof for the delayed emission to originate from TADF is provided in Fig. 6 and Fig. S4 in the ESI.† Oxygen quenching of the delayed fluorescence proved that it has triplet-like nature. However, TADF in oxygen-saturated environments was not quenched completely, rather intense delayed emission was observed. TADF decayed single-exponentially in oxygen-saturated conditions with a decay time of about 70 μs for 1c and 50 μs for 1d (in PMMA). DF/PF ratios in air were remarkably lower: 0.11 for 1c and 0.43 for 1d and corresponded to delayed emission fractions of 10% (for 1c) and 30% (for 1d) of the total emission. This shows that the polymer host surroundings provide fair protection from oxygen impact. Our results show, that the estimation of ΦF enhancement in oxygen-saturated/deficient environments should be carried out carefully, since TADF still may be present in air (ΦF with excluded TADF contribution were used for DF/PF calculations in Table 2).
TADF parameters of compound 1d, having the most intense TADF, dispersed in Zeonex, PMMA (both at 1 wt%) and DPEPO (3 wt%), obtained from fluorescence transients, are listed in Table 3.10,11 Clearly, a more polar environment enhanced TADF due to reduced ΔEST, leading to larger ΦDF in DPEPO films. Although the exact value of the TADF rate could not be estimated due to complex fluorescence decay, a clear trend can be seen (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†). The TADF lifetime (τTADF) was shorter in hosts of higher polarity, thus krISC, which directly depends on kTADF and ΦDF (krISC = τTADF−1 × (ΦPF + ΦDF)/ΦPF),10 should be larger in more polar surroundings.

Conformational disorder of compound 1d dispersed in various solid surroundings was investigated by estimating time resolved emission spectra. Rather complex behaviour was observed (see Fig. 7a). Time resolved fluorescence spectra of compound 1d in 1 wt% PMMA film in oxygen-saturated conditions initially are observed at about 3.3 eV (energies were estimated from the spectral onsets). This prompt 1CT emission redshifts up to about 2.82 eV and stabilizes after about 100 ns. Then the DF is observed up to about 1 ms. In the case of oxygen-deficient conditions (see Fig. 7b), the firsts steps are the same as in oxygen-rich environments, however TADF is still observed after more than ∼1 ms delay. This 1CT DF starts to blueshift up to about 3.02 eV at the largest 77 ms delay. Such temporal behaviour of DF corresponded to fluorescence decay (see Fig. 6), where only single-exponential DF decay was observed in oxygen-rich environments and multi-exponential DF decay emerged at larger delays in oxygen-deficient environments, showing the involvement of multiple recombination pathways. The same trend was also observed for compound 1d in 1 wt% DPEPO film and compound 1c in dilute PMMA film (see Fig. S7 and S8 in the ESI†).

This double shift of time resolved fluorescence of TADF compounds in solid films was observed previously.46,47 Dias et.al.46 performed fluorescence transient measurements of 5 wt% DPTZ-DBTO2:Zeonex film and observed multiexponential decay of both PF and DF. Fluorescence spectra showed an initial redshift due to the interplay of 1CT and 1LE fluorescence decay. With increased delay time, 1CT TADF decay dominated up to about 400 ns, where the blueshift of the emission peak was observed up to hundreds of μs due to the emergence of 3LE phosphorescence. Mehes et. al47 also observed a redshift of 1CT emission up to about 15 μs and later blueshift at a ms time range in 2 wt% ACRF:DPEPO films. A time-dependent ΔEST model was suggested, where the singlet–triplet energy gap was tuned by time-dependent host polarity. According to this model, the initial stabilization of the 1CT state by the increase of host polarity is the nature of the blueshift of prompt fluorescence, while the opposite mechanism causes the later reverse temporal shift of DF. Also, the redshift of prompt fluorescence in solid films occurring in the first ∼100 ns was observed by Santos et. al.48 and was explained by stabilization of the 1CT state, which is slower than in solutions.
Although the fluorescence dynamics of compound 1d is rather similar to that observed by Mehes et.al.,47 the presented mechanism is unlikely. We have observed the same spectral shifts in both polymer and small-molecule hosts with different rigidity and ability for reorganization, so a different explanation probably is needed. The recent report by Northey et.al.,49 based on molecular dynamics, ruled out the time-dependent ΔEST model.47 The authors proposed a new possible mechanism, where spectral shifts are explained by the dispersion of ΔEST values. Molecules having more planar conformations would have higher S1 energy and ΔEST, and thus will emit earlier, inducing the redshift of prompt fluorescence. Concomitantly with radiative S1 deactivation, ISC efficiently populates triplet states. The reverse trend is observed for the TADF. Molecules with more twisted conformations having the lowest ΔEST would emit first because of exponential krISC dependence on ΔEST causing the blueshift of fluorescence. This proposed mechanism nicely explains the fluorescence dynamics of compound 1d. In this case, the weakest steric interactions should be between pyrimidine and 4-dimethylaminophenyl fragments thus the energy barrier for twisting should be low. Initially, prompt 1CT emission is observed from molecules with the lowest pyrimidine–4-dimethylaminophenyl twist angle having the highest oscillator strength and 1CT energy. Since the non-radiative decay rate (through ISC) is high, the triplet population rapidly rises and after several hundred nanoseconds TADF emerges firstly from the molecules with more twisted geometry, the lowest 1CT energy and ΔEST. The later slower TADF from more planar conformations with larger ΔEST is observed only in oxygen-free conditions, however DF from the most planar conformations with the largest singlet–triplet gaps cannot be observed due to quenching by structural defects or remaining oxygen. Interestingly, DF blueshift in more polar DPEPO was stronger than in PMMA (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†) due to more rapid rISC.
Selection of a more rigid polymer host allows us to reduce conformational disorder (see Fig. S9 in the ESI†). Dispersion of compound 1d in the more rigid Zeonex polymer resulted in smaller temporal shifts of prompt and delayed fluorescence spectra due to the more restricted molecular core conformation, and thus the lower ΔEST dispersion. TADF spectra at the largest delay times resembled those of prompt fluorescence observed just after the photoexcitation, originating from molecules with the same conformation. This shows that rigid hosts or less flexible molecular geometry50,51 should be used in order to reduce unwanted temporal shifts of fluorescence spectra.
In the final stage, compound 1d showing pronounced TADF properties, was used as a dopant for sky blue OLEDs.
Electroluminescence properties
Carbazole–pyrimidine cored compound 1d was used as a TADF emitter in an OLED. The device configuration was: glass/ITO/m-MTDATA (10 nm)/NPB (15 nm)/mCP (10 nm)/3 wt% 1d:DPEPO (20 nm)/TPBi (45 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm), where ITO, m-MTDATA, NPB, mCP, DPEPO, TPBi, LiF and Al represent indium tin oxide, 4,4′,4′′-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine, N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine, 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene, bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether oxide, 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole), lithium fluoride and aluminium, respectively.
The fabricated OLED device showed sky blue electroluminescence (with a device turn-on voltage of about 5–6 V) centred at about 490 nm with CIE colour coordinates of (0.19;0.29). The peak luminous efficiency was 8.5 lm W−1 and the maximum external quantum efficiency reached 6% with noticeable roll-off at the highest current densities (see Fig. 8) due to rather slow TADF decay.24 The calculated theoretical EQE of the OLED with the TADF emitter, having ΦTADF of 0.32 and ΦPL of 0.03, a light outcoupling ratio of 0.2 and a charge balance factor of 1, was 0.07,46 in-line with the experimental value.

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a series of carbazole–pyrimidine cored compounds showing room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed emission. RTP was shown in compounds with a large energy gap between the lowest singlet state and two triplet states, while RTP was transformed to TADF in compounds with a reduced singlet–triplet energy gap. The alteration of the delayed emission type was achieved only by modifying the pyrimidine acceptor fragment and enhancing the charge transfer character. The RTP quantum yield reached about 7% in rigid nonpolar Zeonex due to efficient intersystem crossing. On the contrary, TADF was more intense in more polar surroundings due to the lowered singlet–triplet energy gap. The PMMA polymer matrix and DPEPO small-molecule host were shown to suppress TADF quenching by oxygen in air and allowed us to observe rather intense DF. Analysis of time resolved fluorescence revealed the existence of an initial redshift and later blueshift of delayed fluorescence. Such unusual behaviour in solid films was explained by the existence of various conformations of the donor–acceptor core with different 1CT energies and ΔEST values acting on different time-scales. Selection of a more rigid polymer host allowed us to reduce conformational disorder and fluorescence temporal shifts. Finally, TADF enhanced sky-blue electroluminescence was demonstrated in an OLED from the compound with the most intense TADF.
