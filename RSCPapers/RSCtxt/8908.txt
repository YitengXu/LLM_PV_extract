    , Accepted 5th November 2012First published on 5th November 2012AbstractBecause of the large specific surface area and superior electrical conductivity of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the high electrocatalytic activity of cobalt sulfide (CoS), CoS/MWCNT hybrid films are deposited onto Ti foil substrates by sequential electrophoresis and pulse potentiostatic electrodeposition. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy observes that the surface of the MWCNTs is wrapped with a nano-honeycomb CoS thin film of ∼55 nm in thickness. Cyclic voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel polarization characterization indicate that the CoS/MWCNT/Ti counter electrode (CE) has better electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction than Pt CE. Under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G), the dye-sensitized solar cell based on the CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE achieves a power conversion efficiency of 8.05%, which exceeds that of the device based on Pt/Ti CE (6.39%).
Introduction
As one of the most promising alternatives for traditional silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention in the past two decades, due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, simple production processes, and relatively high energy conversion efficiency.1–3 Typically, the DSSC has a sandwich structure with a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE) catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. Usually, the CE comprises a F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with a Pt film. Although Pt has high conductivity, catalytic activity and chemical stability to speed up the reduction of I3−,4,5 it is one of the most expensive components in DSSCs.6 For commercialization, numerous studies have been made with the aim of reducing or eliminating the dependence on the noble Pt, such as carbon materials,7,8 conductive polymers,9,10 inorganic materials,11–18 and other hybrid materials.19–23
Among them, multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have the most potential for use in DSSCs as alternative CEs due to their features of large specific surface area, superior electronic conductivity and excellent mechanical strength,24 but their stabilities and catalytic activities are not satisfactory. To improve the catalytic activity, Huang et al.19 reported that reducing Pt nanoparticles on the MWCNTs achieved an enhanced photovoltaic performance owing to the specific surface area increase. Xiao et al.22 reported that nano-meadows poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) electropolymerized on the MWCNTs and achieved a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.03%, which is higher than that based on the Pt CE (5.88%). Recently, some inorganic compounds have also been introduced into DSSCs as electrocatalysts, such as nitrides,11,12 sulfides,13–15 selenides,16 and carbides,17,18 which show good catalytic activity as CE materials. Additionally, Li et al.20 utilized MWCNTs with TiN nanoparticles as a CE, showing a comparable performance to that of the Pt CE. Lin et al.21 further enhanced the performance of DSSCs using a CoS/MWCNT composite catalytic film by electrophoresing MWCNTs onto a conducting glass substrate followed by CoS cyclic voltammetry (CV) electrodeposition. Compared to CV electrodeposition, the pulse electrodeposition technique for metal deposition has many well-known advantages, such as particle size control, uniform distribution and easy preparation, which avoid the diffusion-limited mass transport of ions to the electrode surface in the bulk solution.25,26
In this paper, integrating the large specific surface area and superior electrical conductivity of MWCNTs and high electrocatalytic activity of CoS, we successfully synthesize a nano-honeycomb CoS coated MWCNT/Ti counter electrode for Pt-free DSSCs using the pulse potentiostatic technique for the first time. The DSSC based on the CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE exhibited a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 8.05%, which is higher than those of DSSCs with Pt/Ti, MWCNT/Ti, and CoS/Ti CEs.
Experimental
Fabrication of CEs
A flexible Ti foil (0.05 mm thickness, Baoji Yunjie Metal Production Co., Ltd China) was used as the substrate due to its excellent electrical conductivity, plasticity and resistance to the corrosive electrolyte. Ti foils with rectangular dimensions of 2.0 × 1.5 cm2 were washed with mild detergent and rinsed in distilled water, then immersed in hydrofluoric acid solution of suitable concentration for 2 min and rinsed in distilled water again. Raw MWCNTs (purity: >99.5%; average diameter: 40–90 nm; length: >10 μm; Golden Innovation Business Co.) were refluxed in a 3:1 mixture of 98% H2SO4 and 78% HNO3 at 120 °C for 2 h to oxidize the graphitic sp2 carbons into –COOH functional groups on the side walls of the nanotubes. The oxidized MWCNTs were further filtered by suction filtration, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and suspended in a 1:1 mixture of acetone and ethanol by ultrasonication for 2 h. Aqueous MWCNT suspensions of 0.5 mg mL−1 concentration were used for the electrophoresis experiments. Cleaned Ti foil and a Pt sheet (2 cm2) were used as a working electrode and a counter electrode, respectively. A constant potential of 18 V vs. open-circuit potential was employed for 15 s.21 Subsequently, the resultant MWCNT/Ti CEs were dried at 50 °C for 10 min.
The pulse potentiostatic electrodepositions of CoS thin film onto Ti foil substrates and MWCNT/Ti foil substrates were carried out using a Zahner electrochemical workstation (Zahner-Elektrik Gmbh & Co. KG, Germany) from an aqueous solution containing 5 mM CoCl2 (ARCOS, 99%) and 0.75 M thiourea, CH4N2S (ARCOS, 99%) in a three compartment cell at ambient atmosphere, which was controlled by ZAHNER THALES software. The parameters for the CoS electrodeposition were set at a pulse-on potential of −0.8 V, pulse-reversal potential of 0.2 V, pulse-on period of 0.5 s, pulse-reversal period of 1.0 s, and total duration time of 200 s. Cleaned Ti foil substrates and a Pt wire were used as a working electrode and a counter electrode, respectively, in addition to a saturated silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode. The obtained CoS/Ti and CoS/MWCNT/Ti CEs were rinsed in distilled water and dried under a cool air flow. For comparison, an electrodeposition Pt/Ti CE was prepared according to our previous reports.27
Characterization
The surface features of the CEs were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan), with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attached to it. The crystal structure was explored using glancing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD, Rigaku-TTRAXIII) analysis. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for the I−/I3− system were measured in a 3-methoxypropionitrile solution consisting of 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4, and conducted over the potential range from −0.4 V to 0.4 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a computer-controlled potentiostat (PGSTAT320N, Autolab) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell; the resultant CEs acted as the working electrode, a Pt-foil as counter electrode and a Pt-wire as reference electrode. Symmetric dummy cells were used for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and Tafel polarization tests. The detailed produce for the fabrication of the symmetric dummy cell has been reported elsewhere.22,28 The EIS measurements were conducted using the Zahner electrochemical workstation. The impedance studies were carried out simulating open-circuit conditions at ambient atmosphere, and the impedance data covered a frequency range of 10−1 to 106 Hz with a zero bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude, in dark conditions. The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed by means of the Z-view software. The Tafel polarization curves were measured using an electrochemical workstation system (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The redox electrolyte consisting of 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodine (Merck), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich), 0.15 M iodine (J. T. Baker), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (Aldrich) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (ARCOS) was employed in EIS, Tafel polarization, and photovoltaic conversion measurements.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
TiO2 films on FTO glass substrates were prepared according to our previous reports.29 The resultant TiO2 films were further soaked overnight in a 0.3 mM ethanolic solution of N719 dye ([cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis (2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II)]; Everlight Chemical Industry Co.), followed by air drying. After dye adsorption, the TiO2 photoanodes were assembled with various CEs. Then the electrolytes were injected into the cells. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were made using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination by a solar simulator (Yamashita Denso YSS-150A). The incident light intensity and the active cell area were 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) and 0.28 cm2, respectively.
Results and discussion
Morphology, phase and composition

Fig. 1a-1 and a-2 show the fiber-like MWCNTs on the Ti foil substrate at a magnification of 10.0 k and 50.0 k. It can be found that the MWCNTs may be piled up onto the Ti foil substrate with weak adhesion. Fig. 1b-1 and b-2 illustrate that the nano-honeycomb structured CoS is fabricated on the Ti foil substrate. From Fig. 1c-1 and c-2, the CoS thin film is preferably deposited on the MWCNT surface. CoS uniformly and continuously grows on the MWCNT surface, thus improving the adhesion of the MWCNTs on the Ti foil substrate. It is interesting that the CoS gradually covers the entire surface of the MWCNTs on increasing the duration of CoS electrodeposition. After 200 s duration of CoS electrodeposition, the MWCNTs are covered well with nano-honeycomb structured CoS (Fig. 1e-1 and e-2). Fig. 1f-1 and f-2 demonstrate the CoS thin film becomes denser, which could decrease the specific surface area of the film, thus the best electrodeposition duration for CoS electrodeposition is 200 s.
 Fig. 1  FE-SEM images of MWCNTs (a-1, a-2), CoS (b-1, b-2), CoS/MWCNT-100s (c-1, c-2), CoS/MWCNT-150s (d-1, d-2), CoS/MWCNT-200s (e-1, e-2), CoS/MWCNT-250s (f-1, f-2) grown on Ti foils at different magnifications. 
The CoS could grow on Ti or MWCNT/Ti foil substrates using the pulse potentiostatic method. The best CoS/MWCNT/Ti film in terms of the DSSC performance was obtained under the pulse-on potential of −0.8 V, pulse-reversal potential of 0.2 V, pulse-on period of 0.5 s, pulse-reversal period of 1.0 s, and total duration time of 200 s. It is interesting that the original diameter of MWCNTs is about 40–90 nm (Fig. 1a-2). After 200 s electrodeposition of CoS onto the MWCNTs, the diameter increases to 150–200 nm (Fig. 1e-2), thus the thickness of CoS thin film coated onto the MWCNTs is about 55 nm. Therefore, the electrodeposited time for all CoS/MWCNT/Ti films in the following section is 200 s.
The EDS analyses were carried out to identify the compositions of the MWCNT/Ti, CoS/Ti, and CoS/MWCNT/Ti films. Fig. 2 reveals that Co and S are found in the CoS/Ti and CoS/MWCNT/Ti films. The atomic percentages of Co and S demonstrate that the Co:S ratio in both is nearly 1:1. This illustrates that CoS is successfully deposited on the Ti foil or MWCNT/Ti foil. Other elements, such as Ti, O, and C, are found in the three samples. The large amount of Ti is due to the Ti foil substrate, a little O may be from the passive oxide film of TiO2 on the Ti foil substrate, and C is due to the holey conductive carbon glue or the MWCNTs.

GIXRD analyses were carried out to identify the compositions of the samples. The sample of CoS/MWCNT is scraped off from the CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrode. Fig. 3 illustrates the four peaks located approximately at 2θ equal to 30.5°, 36°, 47.5° and 55° which are due to the reflections of the (100), (101), (102), and (110) planes, in the CoS/MWCNT phase, respectively.30 These results indicate that the CoS/MWCNTs is successfully electrodeposited onto the Ti foil substrate.

Cyclic voltammetry analysis

Fig. 4 shows the CVs for the Pt/Ti, MWCNT/Ti, CoS/Ti, and CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrodes. The electrodes show a pair of oxidation and reduction peaks in the potential range from −0.4 to 0.4 V, the redox pair is attributed to the reaction of I3− + 2e− → 3I−, which directly affects the DSSC performance.31 The peak currents and peak-to-peak separation (Epp), which is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction, are two important parameters for comparing the catalytic activities of different electrodes.32 The peak positions and shapes of the CoS/Ti and CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrodes are very similar, thereby the two electrodes have the same Epp value (Table 1), but lower than that of the Pt/Ti electrode. Moreover, the two electrodes have higher potentials and larger current densities than those of the Pt/Ti electrode. These reveal that CoS/Ti and CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrodes are better electrochemical catalysts for the I−/I3− redox reaction than the Pt/Ti electrode. However, no reduction peak is observed for the MWCNT/Ti electrode in this potential interval, suggesting the reduction reaction of I3− to I− on the MWCNT electrode is remarkably slower. Notably, the introduction of CoS results in an obvious enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−, especially on the increase of the reduction and oxidation current densities. Based on its highest peak currents and lowest Epp, the CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrode is superior to the Pt/Ti and CoS/Ti electrodes. This indicates that the CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrode exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity, which can be attributed to its highly uniformity and nano-honeycomb morphology around the MWCNT network, the high specific surface area of MWCNTs for CoS attachment, and superior electrical conductivity of MWCNTs for electron transport from Ti foil to CoS.

Electrochemical impedance analysis
To further elucidate the electrochemical catalyst of different electrodes in the reduction of I3−, electrochemical impedance analyses (EIS) of the samples were performed. EIS experiments were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes. Fig. 5 demonstrates the Nyquist plots for symmetric cells with different electrodes. The insets of Fig. 5 show the symmetric cells and equivalent circuit model, the latter is employed to simulate the resultant spectra of electrodes. The high frequency intercept on the real axis represents the Ohmic series resistance (RS) including the sheet resistance of two identical electrodes and the electrolytic resistance. The span of a single semi-circle along the real axis from high to low frequency (RCT) corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the I3− reduction. While the right arc represents the Nernst diffusion impedance (W) corresponding to the diffusion resistance of the I−/I3− redox species. The constant phase element (CPE) is frequently used as a substitute for the capacitor in an equivalent circuit to fit the impedance behavior of the electrical double layer more accurately when the double layer does not behave as an ideal capacitor.33

Table 1 presents the impedance parameters obtained from the Z-view software analyses of the EIS spectra. Owing to the symmetric configuration of the dummy cell, the real RCT value was calculated as half of the value obtained from the Z-view fitting. RCT increases in the order of CoS/MWCNT/Ti (0.85 Ω cm2) < CoS/Ti (1.29 Ω cm2) < Pt/Ti (1.42 Ω cm2) < MWCNT/Ti (2.29 Ω cm2), indicating an inverse order of electrocatalytic activity.34,35 The Nernst diffusion impedances for the four symmetric cells also increases in the order of CoS/MWCNT/Ti (0.25 Ω cm2) < CoS/Ti (0.77 Ω cm2) < Pt/Ti (2.31 Ω cm2) < MWCNT/Ti (29.54 Ω cm2), which reveals that I3− can be rapidly reduced to I− under the catalysis of CoS to speed up the diffusion of I3−. Consequently, the overall impedance of the CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrode is superior to that of the other three electrodes. The conclusions for the catalytic activity derived from the EIS and CV data are consistent.
Furthermore, to confirm the catalytic activities of the Pt/Ti, MWCNT/Ti, CoS/Ti, and CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrodes, the Tafel polarization curves were measured on the symmetric cells used in the EIS experiments (Fig. 6). The slopes for the anodic or cathodic branches are in the order of CoS/MWCNT/Ti > CoS/Ti > Pt/Ti > MWCNT/Ti. A larger slope indicates a higher exchange current density (J0) on the electrode, the higher the J0 then the more catalytically active the material.13J0 can also be calculated by eqn (1), where RCT is the charge-transfer resistance obtained from EIS spectra (Fig. 5), R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction at the electrode, and F is Faraday's constant. (1)
 Fig. 6  Tafel curves of the symmetric (a) Pt/Ti, (b) MWCNT/Ti, (c) CoS/Ti, and (d) CoS/MWCNT/Ti electrodes. 
In addition, at a low sweep rate, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) depends on the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple in the electrolyte, which can be expressed by eqn (2),13 where C is the concentration of I3−, D is the diffusion coefficient of I3−, l is the space thickness, n and F have been defined previously. (2)
The value of Jlim decreases in the order of CoS/MWCNT/Ti > CoS/Ti > Pt/Ti > MWCNT/Ti and is directly proportional to D, which indicates the CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity. These Tafel polarization experiments are therefore consistent with the EIS results.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs

Fig. 7 compares the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on the various CEs measured under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) and the resultant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. All DSSCs had comparatively similar open circuit voltages (Voc) (750 mV) except for that of the MWCNT/Ti CE. The explanation is that the Voc is mainly determined by the energy level between the Fermi level of the electron in the photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte.1,2 Because these DSSCs have similar compositions, their Voc values are close. As for the lower Voc of that using the MWCNT CE, one possible reason may be due to the adsorption of electrolyte, 4-tert-butylpyridine, onto the MWCNT surface.36 Another reason may be there are few electron transport paths between the MWCNT and Ti foil, which is shown in Fig. 8. Notably, not only a remarkable increase in the short-current density (JSC) value, but also an improved fill factor (FF) value results from the introduction of CoS on the MWCNT. The increase in JSC for the CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE possibly results from its high cathodic current density and enhanced diffusivity of the I−/I3− redox couple, as indicated in the aforementioned CV and Tafel polarization tests.37,38 The improvement in FF can be attributed to the slightly lower RCT at the electrolyte–CE interface and the much lower W of I3− in the electrolyte.35,37,39 Comparing CoS/Ti CE with CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE, the high electrical conductivity of the MWCNT network demonstrates an indispensable role to improve the photovoltaic performance, especially on JSC and FF values due to the high active specific surface area and improved electron transport. Therefore, the DSSC assembled with the CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE exhibited a Voc of 751 mV, JSC of 14.69 mA cm−2, FF of 0.73, and cell efficiency (η) of 8.05%, which is superior to that using Pt CE (6.39%).

Mechanisms analysis

Fig. 8 shows the possible catalytic mechanisms of MWCNTs, CoS, and CoS/MWCNT CEs for I3− reduction during the operation of the DSSC. For the MWCNT/Ti CE, although the MWCNTs has superior electrical conductivity, but there are few charge transport paths between the MWCNTs and Ti foil, this is because the MWCNTs are piled up onto the Ti foil with weak adhesion. For the CoS/Ti CE, the CoS thin film shows lots of charge transport paths between CoS and Ti foil. In the CoS/MWCNTs/Ti CE, the CoS thin film improves the adhesion of the MWCNTs on the Ti foil substrates, meanwhile enhancing the connection of the CoS/MWCNTs. This supplies a large number of charge transport paths, along which the charges can be transferred to the MWCNTs and surface of the CoS/MWCNTs. Therefore, the CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE displays the highest catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− of the MWCNT/Ti and CoS/Ti CEs.
Conclusion
A CoS coated MWCNT/Ti hybrid CE without expensive Pt catalyst was fabricated by using a pulse potentiostatic method in the current study. The MWCNTs were uniformly wrapped with nano-honeycomb CoS thin film with a thickness of ∼55 nm. This hybrid CE showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the I3−/I− redox reaction due to its features of intrinsic excellent electrocatalytic activity from CoS, and large specific surface area and superior electrical conductivity from the MWCNTs. The Pt-free DSSC using CoS/MWCNT/Ti CE yielded a high efficiency of 8.05%, increased by 26.0% compared to the DSSC using a Pt/Ti CE. As a result, the CoS/MWCNT CE is a potential substitute for the expensive Pt CE.
