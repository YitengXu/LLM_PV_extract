    First published on 9th February 2022AbstractAdvanced solar energy utilization technologies have been booming for carbon-neutral and renewable society development. Photovoltaic cells now hold the highest potential for widespread sustainable electricity production and photo(electro)catalytic cells could supply various chemicals. However, both of them require the connection of energy storage devices or matter to compensate for intermittent sunlight, suffering from complicated structures and external energy loss. Newly developed photoelectrochemical energy storage (PES) devices can effectively convert and store solar energy in one two-electrode battery, simplifying the configuration and decreasing the external energy loss. Based on PES materials, the PES devices could realize direct solar-to-electrochemical energy storage, which is fundamentally different from photo(electro)catalytic cells (solar-to-chemical energy conversion) and photovoltaic cells (solar-to-electricity energy conversion). This review summarizes a critically selected overview of advanced PES materials, the key to direct solar to electrochemical energy storage technology, with the focus on the research progress in PES processes and design principles. Based on the specific discussions of the performance metrics, the bottlenecks of PES devices, including low efficiency and deteriorative stability, are also discussed. Finally, several perspectives of potential strategies to overcome the bottlenecks and realize practical photoelectrochemical energy storage devices are presented.

1. Introduction
Currently, the total energy consumption of the world is ever-increasing, in which fossil fuels take the highest share by far throughout the world.1 However, the limited storage of fossil fuels and their inherent production of CO2 cannot meet the requirement of drastically increasing energy demand and sustainable development of human society.2 Therefore, with increasing attention toward replacing fossil fuels by carbon-neutral energy, sunlight, as an essential, abundant and renewable energy resource, holds great promising potential to supply the global energy demand by converting it into various types of energies.3–5 Among the developed solar energy utilization technologies, photovoltaics (PV) has caught much attention due to the direct output energy in the form of electricity for practical applications and has grown enormously with the introduction of perovskite materials in recent years.6,7 Meanwhile, photo(electro)catalysis offers an option to convert solar energy into combustible fuels (H2, CO, NH3, etc.).8,9 Particularly, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting technology has been regarded as a prototype of artificial photosynthesis for sustainable, clean, and recyclable hydrogen production. However, the further utilizations of photogenerated electricity and fuels require the combination with separated devices (rechargeable batteries, regenerative fuel cells, etc.) to fulfil efficient solar energy utilization on demand with high reliability.10,11 With the booming development of PV systems and electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, converting and storing solar energy into rechargeable batteries hold a great promise for solar energy utilization with practical viability.
The most traditional and common solar energy storage method is connecting the PV cells with external rechargeable batteries (such as lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, etc.) by electric wires (Fig. 1a). Nevertheless, this integrated system with two device units inclines to be bulky and large in volume, making it inflexible especially for smart consumer electronics and electric vehicles.12 Meanwhile, the mismatch of the current or voltage between the PV system and batteries as well as the energy loss through external wires also reduces the energy utilization efficiency of the whole system.13 As a simpler integrating configuration, combining rechargeable batteries with a third photoelectrode was also studied. In this three-electrode system (Fig. 1b), the potential energies of each part need to be highly compatible to form an effective redox cycle for the utilization of photogenerated electrons or holes.14–17 Although this design improves the practicality to some extent, the internal integration of the photoelectrode and the use of the redox shuttle certainly increase the complexity and cost of battery construction. Considering this, an appealing solution is designing a single device system, which implements direct solar energy storage in just two-electrode configuration. To realize such a system, dual functional photoactive electrodes that perform photoconversion as well as energy storage are the main components. Then, a single device system with only a two-electrode configuration could be achieved by further connecting with a common battery cathode/anode (Fig. 1c). In this system, the photoactive electrode materials capable of solar conversion and energy storage form the crucial part, and determine the cost, stability and solar-to-output energy storage efficiency of the system.
 Fig. 1  Three configurations of a solar energy conversion and storage device system: (a) directly connected PVs with a battery in series; (b) three-electrode devices with the introduction of photoelectrodes; (c) two-electrode devices based on dual functional materials. 
Such dual functional materials generally go through two steps in a single device: (1) absorbing solar energy and generating hole and electron pairs; (2) the photo-generated holes/electrons further transfer the energy to the electrochemical energy storage materials for charge/discharge processes. Photoelectrochemical energy storage (PES) materials are thus proposed in this review, which possess multiple abilities of light harvest, the matching of energy levels and the reversibility of electrochemical reactions at the same time. Compared to photo(electro)catalytic systems employed for producing fuels and photovoltaic systems employed for generating electricity, single systems with PES materials show an alternative way for efficient solar utilization by direct solar energy storage (Fig. 2). Although many PES materials have been developed with great advances and several types of devices with direct solar to electrochemical energy storage have been realized, it is still a big challenge to conclude the design principles of PES materials and to fabricate two-electrode solar energy storage devices that simultaneously achieve miniaturization and practicability, high solar-to-output energy conversion and storage efficiency, and long-term stability.

In this review, PES materials are first introduced with classification into three types based on their different mechanisms, including combined photoelectric materials with energy storage materials, PES inorganic materials and PES organic materials. Then the design principles of PES materials with simultaneous solar conversion and storage ability are proposed. Particularly, the recent advances in direct solar to electrochemical energy storage devices with a two-electrode configuration, including metal–ion batteries, O2-involved batteries, supercapacitors, redox flow batteries etc., are specifically summarized, which mainly focus on the influence of light illumination on the potential, solar-to-output energy conversion and storage efficiency, and stability. Finally, we propose the challenges and potential development directions for future PES materials and the corresponding devices to provide a competitive and pioneering strategy for solar energy storage.
2. Types of PES materials and its design principles
PES dual functional materials should hold multiple abilities of solar energy conversion and storage. Researchers have explored many PES materials, ranging from inorganic materials to organic materials, as well as combined photoelectric materials with energy storage materials. In this section, typical examples for these three types of PES materials and their design principles will be discussed.
2.1 Combined photoelectric materials with energy storage materials
To simultaneously convert and store solar energy, an apparent strategy is combining photoelectric materials with energy storage materials. TiO2 has been widely studied as a typical inorganic semiconductor material, which is easy to modify and composite with other materials.18–20 In 2008, Chien-Tsung Wang et al. successfully synthesized TiO2/V2O5 composites with a core–shell structure, in which TiO2 was responsible for photovoltaic conversion under UV illumination and V2O5 for energy storage. The photo-generated electrons from TiO2 transfer and accumulate in the V2O5 matrix with a downstream conduction band (CB) structure (Fig. 3a), which benefit the formation of the bronze structure of V2O5 with the intercalation of H+ or Li+ ions, as shown in eqn (1).21 V2O5 + xe− + xM+ ⇌ MxVx4+V2−x5+O5(1)

There are many TiO2-containing composites on the basis of the above-mentioned photo-induced electron storage mechanism, such as TiO2–NiO/TiO2 thin films,22 TiO2/Ni(OH)2,23 TiO2–WO3,24 TiO2–MoO3, etc.25,26 Usui and coauthors have put much effort into TiO2/MnO2 composites for effective solar energy storage and proposed a more detailed possible mechanism as follows: upon light irradiation, electron–hole pairs are generated in TiO2. The holes are consumed on the electrode surface while electrons accumulate in TiO2 and then move to the MnO2 side for Na+ adsorption.27,28 They further doped Fe3+ and Zn2+ into TiO2/MnO2 composite electrodes to improve the performance.29,30 According to the above-mentioned mechanism, consuming holes on the TiO2 surface with electrolyte additives could effectively suppress unfavourable electron–hole recombination. For the first time, they used nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which serves as an electron-transfer mediator in the photosynthesis system, to consume the photoexcited holes in TiO2. The oxidation state NADP+ could be reduced to NADPH by chlorophyll a on the TiO2 surface to obtain high and stable photovoltages.31,32 Constructing a TiO2 based heterojunction structure is another solution to address the problem of a high charge recombination rate in TiO2. Yu Jihong et al. designed a TiO2–Fe2O3 heterojunction, in which the TiO2 electronic structure was regulated to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance. The photoexcited electrons acquired a negative potential lower than 2.96 V (vs. Li/Li+) under illumination, which reduced the overpotential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (Fig. 3b).33 Very recently, Jiang Hao et al. designed a SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction and found that the photogenerated electrons could quickly flow to SnO2 due to suitable CV potentials between SnO2 and TiO2 to accelerate the lithiation process of SnO2. The remaining holes in turn enhanced the Li+ migration to the TiO2 by achieving charge balance.34
Traditional TiO2 only absorbs UV light, which limits its photo-electric conversion efficiency and practical application. Considering this, more photoactive materials were studied to composite with energy storage materials to broaden the spectral range for the application under sunlight illumination. For example, Fe2O3, considering the advantages of high electrochemical stability, appropriate band gaps (1.9–2.2 eV) and low cost,35 could be combined with NiOOH to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under light illumination.36 Fe2O3@Ni(OH)2 nanorod arrays could also be used as electrodes in photochargeable supercapacitors, in which Fe2O3 absorbed sunlight and produced electron–hole pairs and Ni(OH)2 stored the energy from photo-generated holes for further discharging.37 Similarly, CdS can couple with Pt or TiO2 to achieve dual functions of harvesting and storing the solar energy.38,39 Additionally, as traditional solar-cell materials, Si and halide perovskite material CH3NH3PbI3 could couple with WO3 or NiCo2O4 to output notable power energy in the dark after photocharging, respectively.40,41
In addition to inorganic photo absorbents, organic materials in dye-sensitized solar cells and organic solar cells could also serve as light capture agents in this system. George Demopoulos and coauthors mixed N719 dye (visible light absorption) with commercial LiFePO4 (lithium-ion battery cathode materials), as shown in Fig. 3c.42 Under light illumination, the N719 dye in the hybrid photocathode absorbs photons and generates electrons and holes. Since the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of N719 dye (−5.0 eV) is higher than that of LiFePO4 (−5.2 eV), the generated holes could oxidize the LiFePO4 leading to delithiation of LiFePO4 to FePO4, which enables the photo-charge process when it is used as an photoelectrode in lithium-ion batteries. Hyun-Kon Song et al. investigated the phase transition process during the insertion of lithium into LiMn2O4 to form Li2Mn2O4 in a dye-sensitized photoelectrode, and the photorechargeable battery could obtain an overall energy efficiency as high as 13.2%.43 Wei Lv et al. prepared a dye-sensitized TiO2–Cu2S composite and once illuminated with visible light, the generated dye+ helps in the oxidation reaction during the process of charging and discharging.44 Wan Jae Dong et al. coated semiconducting polymers poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) on indium tin oxide branched nanowires (ITO BRs).45 When under light illumination, P3HT captures the solar energy to generate excitons, which further separate as electrons and holes. The separated holes can transfer to the ITO BRs due to the matching energy levels between P3HT and ITO. The separated electrons move and accumulate at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces and thereby attract positive ions in the electrolyte, which are pulled by the electric field between P3HT and ITO BRs and are then stored within the porous ITO BRs to realize the energy storage function (Fig. 3d).
With the strategy of simply combining photoelectric materials and energy storage materials, composites with both solar energy conversion and storage abilities can be prepared more conveniently. Besides, the composites consisting of two more materials with different energy band structures can facilitate the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes to a certain extent. However, the physically mixing method to obtain such composites with disorder structures usually leads to the recombination of electrons and holes, with which it is hard to achieve high solar-to-output energy conversion and storage efficiency for related devices. PES materials with single components are thus attracting attention to solve this problem.
2.2 PES inorganic materials
Inorganic compounds are rich in diversity and well-studied as photoelectric and energy storage materials.46,47 Early in 1976, Hodes and his coauthors have designed the first photo-rechargeable battery using a Cd–Se semiconductor; however, the efficiency and stability issues limited its further application.48 PES inorganic materials for both solar energy conversion and storage are still in the early stage of development. Currently, great efforts have been made in this research area. For example, TiO2 is a typical semiconductor and anode material for lithium-ion batteries. C. Laberty-Robert and coauthors found that lithium-rich TiO2 (orthorhombic phase) can oxidize itself into lithium-poor TiO2 (tetragonal phase) by photogenerated holes under light, thus promoting the deinsertion of lithium ions (Fig. 4a). The phase transformation was reversible during photocharge and dark discharge. These processes could be evidenced by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests under dark and light conditions.49,50 Moreover, since the redox potential of CO2/Li2CO3 (2.80 V vs. Li+/Li) is located between the CB and valence band (VB) potential of TiO2 (2.58 V and 5.49 vs. Li+/Li, respectively), the photogenerated holes provided efficient oxidation of Li2CO3 for the photocharging process.51 Except for TiO2, Jason Scott et al. found the light-induced ion intercalation process in MoO3 accompanied by a two-phase structure transformation from NaxMoO3 to α-MoO3 (Fig. 4b). However, this process was not fully reversible since a proportion of Na+ would be trapped in the NaxMoO3 phase. The conduction and VB edge positions of MoO3 could reversibly shift resulting in a concurrent narrowing/widening of the host optical band gap, respectively.52 Cheng Zhong et al. proposed that the VB potential of α-Fe2O3 is higher than that of the O2/OH− couple. Therefore, the generated holes could transfer to the photoelectrode surface, thus facilitating the OER process under sunlight illumination by reducing the charging voltage, which could also happen in the case of BiVO4 photoelectrodes (Fig. 4c).53 Co3O4 also showed both solar energy harvesting and storage abilities.54 Interestingly, LiMn2O4, as a typical lithium-ion battery cathode material, has recently showed a novel light–matter interaction phenomenon of inducing the microsecond long-lived charge separated state consisting of Mn4+ (hole) plus electrons under light illumination.55

As an emerging solar-cell material with remarkable energy conversion properties, halide perovskites have recently been extended to applications in energy storage systems as well.56,57 Consequently, halide perovskites demonstrate promising capabilities of multifunctional solar energy conversion and storage in a single material. Michael De Volder et al. reported a multifunctional 2D halide perovskite (C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4, which is responsible for both light harvesting and photocharging behaviors (Fig. 4d). The phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used for energetically favorable transport of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite to current collector Cu, since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of (C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (−3.0 eV) is higher than that of PCBM (−3.8 eV) and Cu (−4.6 eV). The positively charged photogenerated holes are proposed to repel the Li+ out of the perovskite matrix or react with lithium iodide (LiI) to form Li+ (2LiI + 2h+ → 2Li+ + I2) and the photoelectrons are accumulated on the counter electrode to reduce the Li+ in the electrolyte, which fulfill the photocharging process of the battery.58 Lead-free halide perovskites are more environmentally friendly and thus attract much attention.59,60 Jonathan E. Halpert et al. reported an all-inorganic, bismuth-based perovskite material Cs3Bi2I9. Particularly, the zero-dimensional (0-D) Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanocrystals showed favorable charge transport, high defect tolerance, and a wide absorption region, benefiting solar energy conversion and storage. PCBM is also introduced in this system for effective electron transfer. Upon illumination, due to the suitable LUMO alignment, the photogenerated electrons transfer from Cs3Bi2I9 (−3.4 eV) to PCBM (−3.8 eV) and then flow to carbon felt (CF) (−5.0 eV). The photogenerated holes in the VB of the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite may participate in the following processes: repulsing the intercalated Li+ back into the electrolyte by the delithiation process, or photo-oxidizing metallic Bi0 with lower relative voltages to high valence state Bi3+ (Fig. 4e).61 Although the matching energy level alignment takes advantage of efficient electron/hole separation, the short carrier lifetimes and short diffusion lengths of electrons and holes in perovskites lead to their recombination or trap, resulting in a low solar to energy storage efficiency in the battery. Vanadium oxide has been researched extensively as a cathode material for metal ion batteries (Zn2+, Mg2+, Li+, etc.).62–64 Meanwhile, vanadium oxide also is one kind of typical p-type semiconductor.65,66 Michael De Volder et al. mixed vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanofibers with P3HT and rGO for solar energy conversion as well as Zn2+, Li+ storage and capacitors.67–69 V2O5 is responsible for the energy storage function and light harvesting function at the same time due to its high reversible capacity and suitable bandgap energy in the visible light spectrum, respectively. Under light illumination, the photo-excited electrons from V2O5 nanofibers can transfer to P3HT due to the matching energy levels between V2O5 (−2.4 eV) and P3HT (−3.2 eV), and further travel through rGO (−4.4 eV) to the current collector. Meanwhile, the valence band of P3HT is lower than that of V2O5, which blocks the unpaired photo-induced holes and resulted in the accumulation of holes in V2O5. So, P3HT and rGO in this design take advantages of favorable charge separation (Fig. 4f).68 The CV tests of the photo zinc-ion battery with the corresponding photoelectrode show an obvious increase in the current upon light illumination as well as a slight negative shift of potentials, which demonstrate that the separated electrons and holes would benefit the ion storage processes. Similar results and photoelectrochemical storage processes could be obtained when they used vanadium dioxide nanorods as functional materials.70
As mentioned above, the photogenerated holes can promote the de-lithiation process of some inorganic cathode/anode materials; however, the strong oxidation ability of high-energy holes would react with the electrolyte or damage the materials, resulting in unwished byreactions that reduce the solar to energy storage efficiency and cause stability issues. Meanwhile, short carrier lifetimes and short diffusion lengths of electrons/holes in inorganic materials lead to their recombination or traps, resulting in low solar to energy storage efficiency in the related devices.
2.3 PES organic materials
Organic materials are attractive in solar cells and electrochemical energy storage devices considering their tunable structures as well as potentially sustainable production from abundant precursors and low carbon footprint.71–75 Meanwhile, organic materials usually exhibit remarkable self-organizing behavior, holding the potential for low-cost fabrication on flexible substrates to construct wearable smart electronics and optoelectronics.76,77 Organic materials for both solar energy conversion and storage should hold the following advantages: (1) good light absorption in the visible spectrum range and charge separation; (2) catalytic sites or redox-active functional groups for energy conversion and storage reactions; (3) photoinduced electron transfer or photoisomerization in organic materials is usually accompanied by reversible structure changes, which is coincident with some energy storage processes, demonstrating a novel way for solar energy conversion and storage.
The first PES organic material to our best knowledge is the cationic cyanine chromophore. The photoelectrochemical energy storage processes are proposed as shown in Fig. 5a: the cationic core chromophore generates a singlet exciton upon irradiation (step 1), which receives the electrons transferred from the I− to form a chromophore radical (step 2). The radical on the cyanine chromophore migrates to the interface of the electrode to maintain the charge flow and reduce the I˙ back to the I−; at the same time the cyanine chromophore reverts to its thermodynamically stable structure (step 3). The relatively long-lived nature of the charge storage state may be due to trans–trans–trans to cis–trans–trans isomerization of the cyanine chromophore as a result of the decreased bond order of the double bonds upon excitation and reduction.78 Lepretre et al. demonstrated that organic boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye derivatives could also act as a combined photosensitizer and electrical storage unit. They proposed the photoelectrochemical energy storage processes; when the BODIPY derivatives absorb the photons and are excited, the electron transfer is thermodynamically easier for both the anodic and the cathodic processes and has resulted in an energy gain according to the energy level of the excited state.79 However, the above studies suffer from low photoelectrochemical energy storage efficiency.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as a fascinating conjugated polymer, has elicited ripples of excitement in the research areas of solar energy conversion, e.g., (photo)electrocatalysis.80 Additionally, due to its structure analogous to graphite, g-C3N4 has widely been studied in the field of electrochemical energy storage, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIB), lithium–O2 batteries, zinc–air batteries (ZAB), supercapacitors (SCs), etc.81 It is reasonable that g-C3N4 holds great promise for simultaneous solar energy conversion and storage as one kind of PES material. In this regard, Zhou et al. investigated the multifunctional capability of g-C3N4, which serves as a highly efficient photocatalyst and an ORR electrocatalyst at the same time. The soluble redox shuttle (I−/I3−) was introduced to transfer the energy of photoexcited holes to oxidize the Li2O2 to assist the charging process (Fig. 5b).82 They further explored the unmediated photoelectrochemical approach to realize photoassisted charging without the I−/I3− redox shuttle. The photoexcited holes from g-C3N4 could directly oxidize Li2O2 during the charging process upon illumination.83 Interestingly, Li et al. found that C3N4 can accelerate both the ORR and OER under light illumination. The photoelectrons generated in the CB of g-C3N4 (1.31 V vs. Li+/Li) could reduce O2 for O2−, which is further reduced to O22− by electrons from the circuit and finally generates Li2O2 during the discharge process. The holes left behind in the VB of C3N4 accelerate the Li2O2 oxidation process, which results in a lower applied voltage than in the normal charging process (Fig. 5c).84 In their further work, they decorated plasmonic Au nanoparticles on C3N4 with nitrogen vacancies (Au/NV-C3N4). The plasmonic Au nanoparticles could increase the light absorption and conversion ability in this issue.85 Kang et al. demonstrated that g-C3N4 as both the cathode and anode materials could harvest light and catalyze O2/H2O redox couples into H2O2 for further reactions. Under irradiation, g-C3N4 absorbs photons and produces the excited electron–hole pairs. The produced electrons transfer from an external circuit to the g-C3N4 cathode to electrochemically catalyze O2 to H2O2 through two-electron, two-proton processes. The generated holes in the anode oxidize H2O to H2O2 by two-electron, two-proton processes, as well. The formed H2O2 could further be consumed by other reactions.86 Michael De Volder's group investigated 2D g-C3N4 for the simultaneous harvesting of solar energy and Zn2+ storage. Upon irradiation, the photogenerated electrons transport from g-C3N4 to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) through rGO as a selective electron transport layer, and finally accumulate on the Zn anode by an external circuit, which may help in the deposition of Zn2+ from the electrolyte. The photogenerated free holes attract anions (e.g., SO42−) toward the g-C3N4@rGO material for adsorption on the surface, which serves as a supercapacitor for energy storage.87
Distinct from well-studied g-C3N4, most recently, Yu et al. designed low-band-gap mesoporous C4N, particles, which showed an obvious enhancement for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions under light illumination as depicted above.88 Bettina. V. Lotsch et al. designed a 2D cyanamide functionalized polyheptazine imide (NCN-PHI) as one single material for solar energy conversion and electrochemical energy storage. They also proposed a novel underlying mechanism for photoelectrochemical energy storage processes: the photogenerated electrons can reduce the carbon nitride backbone in NCN-PHI to obtain a light-induced negative charge in the form of long-lived, “trapped” electrons, which further attract and absorb alkali metal ions within the NCN-PHI layers and at the solution interface to fulfil the cation storage process (Fig. 5d). The photogenerated holes transfer to the counter electrode through an appropriate hole shuttle.89 Poly(terthiophene) (PTTh), as one kind of conducting polymer with dedicated light-harvesting and electron-transfer functionalities, can be conjugated with other organic polymers for the photo-enhanced electrocatalytic ORR.90–92 In 2016, Li Can et al. found that the use of only pTTh could also promote the ORR under light illumination from the energy viewpoint. The electrons in the VB (1.53 V) of pTTh could be excited to the CB (−0.52 V) under illumination, which position at a sufficient potential to allow the transfer into the π*2p antibonding orbital of molecular oxygen, but may not be of sufficient energy for transferring into the σ* orbital. As a result, with the light illumination, the ORR proceeds with a two-electron transfer mechanism for H2O2 formation. The resulting holes are transported to the anode via the external circuit. (Fig. 5e).93 Li Fujun et al. also investigated this process in photo-driven ZABs.94 Recently, novel PES organic materials have been designed in two studies to demonstrate new possibilities for simultaneous solar conversion and lithium-ion storage. Wang et al. designed a covalent organic framework integrating naphthalenediimide and triphenylamine units (NT-COF) (Fig. 5e). They for the first time proposed that intramolecular charge transfer from the TPA to the NDI could accelerate insertion/deinsertion of lithium ions under light illumination by photo/electrochemical measurements.95 Pulickel M. Ajayan et al. investigated the photo induced delithium process of small molecular organic material-lithiated tetrakislawsone. After capturing sunlight with a desired wavelength, lithiated tetrakislawsone generates electron−hole pairs. The holes oxidize the lithiated tetrakislawsone to tetrakislawsone with Li+ deinsertion for the charging process while the generated electrons flow from the tetrakislawsone to the anode to reduce Li+ into Li metal (Fig. 5f).96
Although many PES organic materials have been reported and shown promising potential for direct solar energy conversion and storage, there are also some limitations. Compared to inorganic semiconductors with free charge formation after photon absorption, the optical excitation in organic semiconductors usually results in the formation of excitons (tightly bound electron–hole pairs), which possess a low dielectric constant and weak intermolecular electronic coupling. Therefore, molecular design for donor–acceptor (D–A) or related structures is needed to drive exciton dissociation and yield efficient charge separation. So, here molecular structure design requirements are proposed for PES organic materials, especially considering efficient solar energy conversion and storage.
2.4 Design principles for PES materials
Overall, here we summarise the basic requirements for the design of PES materials: (1) PES materials should capture the sunlight and it is better that the bandgap of the PES materials be located in the range of 1.5–3 eV for more visible light absorption. A too large or too small bandgap will reduce the absorption efficiency of solar light; (2) PES materials with the capability of separating photogenerated electrons and holes could reduce their recombination, which is further beneficial for the acceleration of energy storage reactions; (3) a long life and a short travel distance of excited holes/electrons would be beneficial for the oxidation/reduction reaction processes; (4) PES materials must have the ability to store energy; (5) the photogenerated electrons or holes on PES materials should promote or replace the energy storage process. Therefore, the matching of CB and VB locations and the redox potential of the anode/cathode materials are vital for the photoelectrochemical energy storage process. For example, if the VB of the PES materials lay higher than the redox potential of energy storage reactions, the photogenerated holes would transfer to the surface of the anode and then promote the oxidation reaction. In a similar way, if the CB of the PES materials lay lower than the redox potential of energy storage reactions, the photogenerated electrons would transfer to the surface of the cathode and then promote the reduction reaction. In particular for the O2-involved reaction, the photoassisted charge and discharge could be fulfilled if the VB and CB of the PES materials are within the redox potential window for O2 reactions. After summarizing and thoroughly analysing the photoelectrochemical energy storage processes of the above-mentioned PES materials, as shown in Fig. 6, we propose the possible mechanisms of PES materials for direct solar energy conversion and storage as below: (1) photogenerated holes oxidize the PES materials for the deinsertion of ions (PHD); (2) photogenerated electrons reduce the PES materials for the insertion of ions (PEI); (3) photogenerated holes in PES materials catalyze the oxidation reaction (PHO); (4) photogenerated electrons catalyze the reduction reaction (PER). Table 1 summarizes most of the above-mentioned PES materials with regard to their types of mechanisms and applications.

3. Integrated two-electrode configuration of PES batteries
Recently, many PES devices with a two-electrode configuration have been developed for solar energy storage, including metal-ion batteries, O2-involved batteries, supercapacitors, redox flow batteries, etc. To evaluate the performance of PES devices, the solar-to-output energy conversion and storage efficiency (ηc) is a key parameter, which can be calculated by this formula: ηc = Eoutput/Elight × 100%. Eoutput refers to the discharging energy from the device and Elight refers to the input energy from light.97 The changes of charge/discharge potential upon light illumination and stability are also important to assess the performance of PES devices.
3.1 PES metal-ion batteries
Among the metal-ion batteries, Li-ion batteries are more universally used as standard battery technologies, because of their superior performance, such as a long cycle life, high energy and power densities, and no memory effect.98 To address the energy consumptions during the charge process, the conversion and storage of solar energy into LIBs to assist or fulfil the battery charging has attracted the attention of scientists.99 In the early stage, many research studies have focused on connecting the PV part with the LIB by electric wires or introducing photoelectrodes into the LIB, which suffer from a complex configuration and high cost.100,101 Introducing PES materials that act as the cathode/anode into single LIBs with a simple two-electrode configuration has been regarded as a more feasible manner for the construction of miniaturized and practical solar to electrochemical energy storage devices. Mitsunobu Sato et al. constructed PES LIBs using TiO2 for photoactive anodes and LiCoO2 for cathodes. The assembled battery showed a charging voltage of 1.38 V with irradiation of 1 sun and a discharge voltage of 1.37 V for at least 30 cycles, which was much improved than that in the dark.102 C. Laberty-Robert et al. also investigated the LixTiO2 photoactive anode and found that by cycling at C/7 under light illumination, the capacity of LixTiO2 could exceed the theoretical value, showing an effective utilization of solar energy.49 A similar behavior was later observed for LiMn2O4 with an increase in the discharge capacity after light illumination.55 George P. Demopoulos and his coworkers present a two-electrode PES LIB with Li metal as the anode and LiFePO4 nanocrystals mixed N719 dye as the photoactive cathode. A discharge capacity of 340 mA h g−1, double the theoretical one, is achieved when the photoactive cathode was under irradiation. After relatively short photocharging time (<24 h), the battery could discharge under dark conditions. However, the overall energy efficiency was only 0.06–0.08% due to the complex reaction between the photogenerated electrons with the electrolyte.42 Michael De Volder etc. first investigated photocharge LIBs consisting of a perovskite photoactive cathode and a Li metal anode. This PES LIB could be fully photo-charged under illumination and then be discharged by loading. However, the capacity declined within a few cycles, which demonstrates the critical stability problem of the perovskite (Fig. 7a).58 Similarly, Jonathan E. Halpert etc. used a bismuth-based perovskite halide as the photoactive cathode and achieved a photo conversion efficiency of ∼0.43% for the first discharge as well as an increase in the capacity from 410 to 975 mA h g−1 upon discharging under illumination.61 Michael De Volder etc. designed a V2O5 based material as a dual functional cathode in LIBs. Under illumination, the capacity increased by more than 57% and the potential reached up to ∼2.82 V. The light conversion efficiency was calculated to be ∼2.6% for 455 nm illumination and ∼0.22% for 1 sun illumination, respectively (Fig. 7b).68 Almost the same time, Pulickel M. Ajayan et al. used an organic molecular lithiated tetrakislawsone as the cathode for the photorechargeable LIB. A larger discharge capacity (332 mA h g−1) under light illumination was obtained compared to that under dark conditions (296 mA h g−1), representing an extra capacity around 12%.96 The above-mentioned photobatteries only highlighted the effect of light illumination on the charge potential. Interestingly, Wang et al. designed a photoactive covalent organic framework, NT-COF, to construct a solar energy storage LIB, which can enable photo-responsive charge and discharge. Specifically, the charging voltage decreased from 2.53 to 2.02 V while the discharging voltage increased from 2.42 to 2.96 V under light, resulting in an increase of total battery efficiency from 78.3% to 117% (Fig. 7c). Besides, this solar energy storage LIB showed a capacity over theoretical capacity upon irradiation, as well as well-reproducible and reliable on–off responses.95

Due to the limited reserves and uneven distribution of Li resources, the exploitation of alternative metal-ion batteries has been ongoing in recent years, such as sodium-ion batteries (SIB) and zinc-ion batteries (ZIB). Yun Hau Ng et al. reported a solar-intercalation SIB consisting of an MoO3 photoelectrode. The open-circuit potential of such a battery increased from 0.26 to 0.55 V after 1.5 h of illumination. The battery exhibited similar discharge characteristics after light illumination.52 Michael De Volder et al. studied a series of photochargeable ZIBs based on vanadium oxide (e.g. V2O5, VO2, etc.) photoactive materials. In the first example, V2O5 was combined with P3HT for effective electron transfer. The corresponding battery showed capacities of ∼190 mA h g−1 and ∼370 mA h g−1 in the dark and under illuminated conditions, respectively, and photo-conversion efficiencies of ∼1.2% (λ ∼ 455 nm, intensity ∼12 mW cm−2).67 In the second example, VO2 was combined with rGO for better charge separation and storage. The photo-ZIB obtained capacities of ∼282 mA h g−1 in the dark and ∼315 mA h g−1 under illumination as well as a capacity retention of ∼90% over 1000 cycles (Fig. 7d).70 In their further work, ZnO and MoS2 were grown on carbon fiber layer-by-layer as the photoactive cathode. The as-constructed battery could achieve ∼0.2% of solar-conversion efficiency and the battery capacity could be increased from 245 to 340 mA h g−1 when under illumination.103
Although the as-fabricated PES metal-ion batteries have demonstrated desired solar energy conversion and storage functions, the ηc of these devices is usually lower than 1% and the performance tends to deteriorate upon long-term illumination. In particular in organic electrolytes, previous studies have found complex reactions between the photogenerated electrons/holes and the electrolyte. In aqueous electrolytes, when the photogenerated electrons/holes react with water, it would have less influence on the device performances compared to organic electrolytes. However, the small potential window (usually <1 V) would restrict its practical application.
3.2 PES O2-involved batteries
Metal–air batteries, included but not limited to Zn–air and Li–air batteries, have received extensive attention recently.104–106 However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and oxygen–oxygen bond breakage and formation during the ORR and OER in the electrode, respectively, lead to high overpotentials, which still hinder their development.107,108 Drawing attention on reactions in (photo)electrocatalysis, designing effective materials that can produce photogenerated electrons or holes to facilitate the catalytic reactions will be promising to reduce the overpotential of the reactions and improve the efficiency of the related devices.
Li-O2 batteries (LOB) have been regarded as a promising energy storage technique due to the largest theoretical energy density (∼5928 W h kg−1) and a large cell voltage (∼2.96 V) based on the battery reaction of 2Li + O2 ⇌ Li2O2.109 Zhou et al. designed a g-C3N4 photocatalyst coupled with an I− ion redox mediator for a photo-assisted rechargeable LOB. The charging voltage of the as-fabricated battery decreases from 3.55 V to 1.9 V under illumination. It is worth noting that the value of 1.9 V is very close to the theoretical energy difference between the CB of g-C3N4 and Li/Li+ couple potential (1.7 V). An energy savings of about 46.5% could be achieved when this battery was under illumination (Fig. 8a). Moreover, the photo-assisted LOB exhibits excellent cycling stability under illumination for 50 cycles without noticeable performance decay.82 However, the reduction of a redox mediator on the metal electrode will cause the shuttle phenomenon and consume the active mass of the metal electrode, and undesirable side reactions would happen due to the high concentration of redox mediators. To avoid the deleterious effects of the redox mediators, they later presented a direct unmediated oxidization reaction of solid Li2O2 by photogenerated holes from g-C3N4. Under light illumination, the charge voltage is equal to the theoretical energy difference between the CB of g-C3N4 and Li/Li+ couple potential (1.7 V). As a result, the charging voltage could be decreased to 1.96 V. Therefore, the energy efficiency of this battery could reach as high as 95.3% and an energy saving of about 17.4% could be obtained under illumination.83 The use of solid-state electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the stability of the device due to their better photostability and safety compared to conventional liquid electrolytes. Therefore, they introduced succinonitrile as the solid-state electrolyte into a photoassisted LOB, in which ZnS@CNTs acts as both a photocatalyst and an OER electrocatalyst. The photoassisted charging potential of the fabricated cell (2.08 V) was significantly lower than that in the dark state (4.09 V), which resulted in an effective energy saving of 50%. More importantly, the charging potential remained very stable during the cycling test (50 cycles), superior to previously reported photoassisted LOBs using liquid electrolytes.110 Li et al. also reported a photoassisted LOB that was constructed by using a single dual functional material, g-C3N4, for solar energy storage. The photoassisted LOB showed that the discharge and charge voltages under illumination were 3.22 V and 3.38 V, respectively, while the discharge and charge voltages of the conventional LOB in the dark were 2.63 V and 4.09 V, respectively (Fig. 8b), which indicated that the utilization of solar energy could effectively save the charge energy and output more electricity.84 By designing a TiO2–Fe2O3 heterojunction, a photoassisted LOB could be constructed with a significant decrease in the charge voltage from 4.2 V to 3.2 V, and the round-trip efficiency was stable at ≈86% after 100 cycles.33 The loading of gold nanoparticles on TiO2 could also achieve similar results.111 Recently, few-layer siloxene nanosheets were introduced into a Li-O2 battery, which showed an ultra-low charge potential of 1.90 V and an ultra-high discharge potential of 3.51 V under light illumination.112 Chen Jun etc. synthesized a semiconducting metal–organic polymer (Co-TABQ) on the carbon paper as the photoelectrode. The as-constructed Li-O2 battery could deliver discharge and charge voltages of 3.12 and 3.32 V under illumination, which was 0.51 V higher and 0.99 V lower than that in the dark, respectively.113 Yu Jihong etc. also proposed a novel strategy to encapsulate CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into a metal−organic framework (MOF) cage to construct a photoactive electrode, which demonstrated an improved stability as a photoassisted Li-O2 battery.114

Zinc is a cost-effective alternative with energy density (≈1218 W h kg−1) and bulk energy density (∼6136 W h L−1) comparable to lithium. Zinc–air batteries (ZABs) are an advanced energy storage device with a high theoretical energy density (1086 W h kg−1) and a safe and cost-effective battery system.115,116 In recent years, with the developments of photo-assisted LIBs and LOBs, researchers also tried to reduce the high overpotential of ZAB charging by introducing dual functional PES materials. For example, a photo-assisted ZAB was designed by using two typical semiconductors α-Fe2O3 or BiVO4 as air electrodes to investigate the effects of band structure towards photoelectrochemical activity and stability in detail. It is shown that the photo-assisted ZAB with the BiVO4 photocatalyst can operate at a very low charging voltage of 1.20 V at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, achieving an energy saving of about 38.8%. With the help of an α-Fe2O3 photocatalyst, a low charging potential of about 1.43 V is observed for the ZAB at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 under illumination, compared to about 1.97 V in the dark (Fig. 8c), showing an energy saving of about 27.4%.47 However, the potential in the case of BiVO4 increased quickly due to severe photocorrosion while a stable potential even after cycling for 50 h could be obtained in the case of α-Fe2O3. This suggests that the selection of semiconductors with more negative CB positions, suitable VB positions, and high photoelectrochemical stability is important for practical photoassisted ZABs. In addition, metal sulfides and metal phosphides can also be used as photoelectrodes for photoassisted rechargeable ZABs, including NiCo2S4, and Ni12P5@NCNT.117,118 For example, photoassisted ZABs with NiCo2S4 photoelectrodes exhibit stable cycling performance with charge and discharge potential plateaus of ∼1.92 V and ∼1.32 V at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 under light illumination, increasing the energy efficiency from 59.2% to 68.8%.117 Furthermore, when Ni12P5@NCNT was introduced into the ZAB, the charge/discharge voltage and energy efficiency under light were also improved due to the good photocatalytic activity of the dual functional Ni12P5@NCNT air cathode (Fig. 8d).118 In addition to inorganic semiconductors, polymer semiconductors have also been investigated for photo-assisted ZABs. Typically, pTTh is designed to improve the electrocatalyst activity by reducing the energy barrier of the OER/ORR process at the air electrode of a ZAB with the help of light energy. The pTTh-based ZAB exhibited a high discharge voltage of 1.78 V under 0.1 mA cm−2 of light, with no degradation for 64 h during the discharge and charge cycles. In particular, the battery can increase the energy density under light by 29.0% compared to a conventional Pt/C-based ZAB.94 Recent work has demonstrated an unprecedented low charge voltage of 0.59 V with poly(1,4-di(2-thienyl))benzene (PDTB) and a TiO2 photo active electrode in a ZAB, which may present a promising strategy for solar energy storage in the ZAB.119
A H2–O2 fuel cell is a clean and efficient energy conversion device that has the potential to replace conventional fossil fuel combustion technologies.120 In 2016, Li et al. reported the first example of a photo-responsive H2–O2 fuel cell based on a pTTh photocathode and a common cell anode. This cell exhibited sensitive photo-responsiveness and effectively extended the discharge performance with a high OCP (1.18 V) and peak power (∼0.52 mW cm−2) under light (Fig. 8e).93
Compared to PES metal-ion batteries, PES O2-involved batteries showed superior stability, which may be ascribed to the matching between photogenerated electrons/holes and O2-involved reactions (e.g. the ORR and OER). However, in PES O2-involved batteries, studies usually focus on photoassisted charge and discharge for the increase of energy storage efficiency and photocharge batteries have not been reported yet.
3.3 PES supercapacitors
Supercapacitors (SCs) are outstanding electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh power density, quick response to potential changes, long cycle life, and safety.121,122 Therefore, solar charge SC systems have been popular over the past few years with the introduction of dual functional PES materials capable of light harvesting and electrochemical energy storage at the same time.123 Ding et al. fabricated a photoassisted supercapacitor with a nonporous Cu@Cu2O material as the photoactive electrode. With the capture of solar energy, the supercapacitor exhibited an incredibly high capacitance of 782 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is 37.9% higher than that in the dark (Fig. 9a).124 Safshekan and coworkers designed a BiVO4/PbOx heterostructure material as a functional electrode for photoassisted supercapacitors. BiVO4 could provide the photoactive function, while PbOx nanoparticles provide the capacitive performance by redox pseudocapacitance. Therefore, the photoassisted supercapacitor exhibited a high capacitance of 6 mF cm−2 at low current density under illumination and a high open-circuit potential of 1.5 V as well as stable charge−discharge cycling for 100 cycles.125 Based on the above strategy, Zhu et al. synthesized core–shell nanorod Fe2O3@Ni(OH)2 as a photoelectrochemical supercapacitor for the direct storage of solar energy. The performance of the device was enhanced up to 20.6 mF cm−2 at a discharge current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, which is 4.5 times higher than that of the existing BiVO4/PbOx.36 Sawangphruk et al. designed Co3O4 nanosheets with absorption across the visible spectrum as the photoactive material in the SC, which exhibited the highest volumetric capacitance of 80.8 F cm−3 under white LED illumination, 2.2 times higher than that under dark conditions.54 Yao et al. designed a photocharge supercapacitor based on Si/WO3 junctions. The two-electrode device with an Si/WO3/H2SO4(aq)/C electrode can work without bias. As shown in Fig. 9b, during photo-charging, an initial negative voltage of −0.3 V is observed in the Si/WO3/H2SO4(aq)/C electrode, which gradually increases to 0.7 V after 60 s of illumination.40 Dong et al. reported a photorechargeable SC with a composition of ITO BRs and P3HT semiconductor polymers. The photorechargeable SC showed an areal capacitance of 2.44 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.02 mA cm−2, which could be photocharged up to 0.28 V and stored the charge efficiently for several tens of seconds.45 Liu and co-workers fabricated a photo-assisted rechargeable SC using nitrogen-doped carbon dot (NCD)-modified Ti3C2Tx-based hybrid fibers. When under light illumination, the photoassisted SC demonstrated a volumetric capacitance of 630 F g−1 at 10 A cm−3, a 35.9% increase over the capacitance of 464 F g−1 under dark conditions (Fig. 9c).126 Michael De Volder et al. presented a solar charged zinc ion capacitor, in which g-C3N4 could realize light harvesting and ion storage at the same time. The as-constructed device allows direct charging using light and can operate in continuous light mode. These capacitors showed a photocharging specific capacitance of 11377 mF g−1, a photocharging voltage response of 850 mV, and a cyclability of 90% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles (Fig. 9d).87 They further investigated the photocharging behavior of zinc ion capacitors using V2O5 nanofibers, which can also simultaneously harvest and store solar energy without bias. The photocapacitor showed 63% capacity increase under illumination, light charging in 30 minutes, and 99% capacity retention in 4000 cycles.67

The cycle stability of PES supercapacitors is excellent (see Table 2) due to the adsorption/desorption energy storage mechanism. Meanwhile, the photocharge time is much faster than other types of PES batteries. However, in most cases, the potential window of PES supercapacitors is lower than 1 V due to the use of aqueous electrolytes. The low energy density is another question for PES supercapacitors for their practical applications.

3.4 Other PES batteries
Other types of static batteries, such as Li–CO2 batteries, Li–Sulphur (Li-S) batteries, were also been applied for solar energy storage. Xu et al. in situ grow TiO2 on carbon cloth (CC) as the photo-cathode. The charge potential decreased from 3.97 V to 2.88 V and the discharge potential slightly increased to 2.78 V when under light illumination. As a result, the energy efficiency could reach 97.2%, which indicates the effective solar energy ultilization.51 They also used In2S3@CNT as the photocathode and obtained similar results.127 Gao et al. proposed an integrated MAPbI3 perovskite coated with CNT@S for solar driven Li-S batteries based on a novel joint electrode mode. The PES Li-S battery could be photocharged with a high ηc of 5.14%, which provided a new design strategy for PES batteries.128
Compared to the above-mentioned static batteries, redox flow batteries (RFBs) hold inherent benefit of storing energy in fluid electrolytes containing redox couples, which enable the large-scale energy storage without increasing the volumes of batteries.129 Recently, by introducing photoelectrodes into RFBs, solar flow batteries (SFBs) could be constructed with the same electrolyte and redox species, demonstrating a more compact approach for solar energy storage.130 In the early stages of development, Gao et al. integrated dye-sensitized TiO2 as the photoanode into RFBs to build SFBs with nonaqueous redox couples; however, this system suffers from a low working current density (∼0.1 mA cm−2) and efficiency (∼0.1%).131,132 With the developments of device configuration and extension of redox couples, the match between the redox potential and the semiconductor bandgap could be further improved to achieve higher efficiency, larger capacity, superior stability and lower cost (Fig. 10a).133 For example, a single side photocharging configuration with a simple form and low cost has been investigated in early stages. Mendes and coauthors designed a SFB with Fe(CN)64−/Fe(CN)63− and anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonate (AQDS/AQDS2−) redox couples, which could be solar charged by a hematite photoanode. However, the devices showed a low efficiency ca. 0.05–0.08%.134 Jin Song et al. designed a monolithically integrated SFB to replace the separated photoelectrochemical/RFB chamber configuration, which delivered an energy storage density of 1.15 W h L−1 and a solar-to-output electricity efficiency of 1.7% over many cycles with the AQDS and 1,2-benzoquinone-3,5-disulfonic acid (BQDS) redox couple and silicon photoelectrodes.135 Nevertheless, the AQDS/BQDS redox couple is unstable for long-term cycles and would cause corrosion on photoelectrodes, which seriously hamper the practical application. In their subsequent work, they changed the redox couple into bis((3-trimethylammonio)propyl)-ferrocene dichloride (BTMAP-Fc) and bis(3-trimethylammonio)propyl viologen tetrachloride (BTMAP-Vi) to deliver an extremely stable SFB with a continuous cycling performance of over 200 h. The n+np+–Si photoanode and the p+nn+–Si photocathode were also well protected. This SFB could obtain an average efficiency of 5.4%.136 They further designed a new redox couple: 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (4-OH-TEMPO) and 1,10-dimethyl-4,40-bipyridinium dichloride (MVCl2). The 4-OH-TEMPO/MVCl2 redox couple could deliver a voltage as high as 1.25 V, when combined with a high-photovoltage (2.4 V) III–V tandem cell photoelectrode, an improved efficiency of up to 14.1% could be achieved by this SFB (Fig. 10b).137 Although the photocorrosion in the photoelectrode and fast decomposition of the redox couple result in a short lifetime of this SFB, the voltage matching design principle proposed in this work paved the way for the design of efficient SFBs. Therefore, after theoretical model calculations and electrochemical study of state-of-the-art aqueous organic RFB redox couples, they chose BTMAP-Vi and 4-trimethylammonium-TEMPO (NMe-TEMPO) redox couples, which could be well matched with the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (Fig. 10c). The as-fabricated SFB reached a high efficiency of up to 20.1% as well as and an unprecedented continuous operation lifetime of more than 500 h.138

Although heartening breakthroughs have been made recently to realize efficient photocharging, the redox electrolytes and photoelectrodes still need careful design of energy level matching. More redox couples with high solubility, fast kinetics, and good stability should also be developed to suit the requirements of SFB devices. The fundamental reaction at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and the costs of redox couples and photoelectrodes should also be paid more attention.
4. Summary and perspectives
Current research studies have proved that PES materials could effectively convert and store solar energy and then discharge as a battery to fulfill feasible solar energy utilization. When PES materials in devices were under light illumination, the charge voltage could be reduced, especially in some cases photocharging could be realized without an external bias, and discharge capacity can be greatly increased. Therefore, PES materials and direct solar-to-electrochemical devices may open a new avenue to better meet future increasing energy demand with just two-electrode device configuration, which can be widely realized in the form of metal-ion batteries, metal–oxygen batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells. It may be envisioned that PES materials and devices will motivate R&D peers for developing fossil fuel-free technologies such as solar charging battery-based electric vehicles and inspire new work for developing renewable wearable smart electronics and optoelectronics. However, most research studies and development of PES materials and the corresponding devices are still in an early experimental stage. Toward practical application, PES materials and devices suffer from several bottlenecks:
(1) The absence of design principles of PES materials hampers the development of more suitable materials, especially for organic PES materials, which are mostly limited to g-C3N4;
(2) Almost all solar to electrochemical processes originate from the oxidization/reduction of photogenerated holes/electrons on the PES materials. Photogenerated holes/electrons could also react with electrolytes or impurities in the batteries, which results in unwished consumption of holes/electrons, leading to the decrease of solar energy utilization efficiency and device stability;
(3) The detailed mechanisms of PES processes are still unrevealed due to the difficulty of observing structure changes during solar energy conversion and storage in situ;
(4) Limited by the short carrier's diffusion distance, the PES materials have to be thin enough to reduce the recombination of hole and electron pairs; however, the thin PES materials represent a low mass loading of active materials, which limits the final solar utilization efficiency of the device. Therefore, the design of battery configuration with high mass loading of active materials with improved light absorption is crucial yet remains unsolved.
In conclusion, several challenges need to be addressed. We make some suggestions for the further development of PES materials for practical solar energy utilization:
(1) Other photo-active materials, such as photochromic materials, could be taken into consideration as PES materials due to their structure changes under light illumination, especially organic photochromic materials, which could harvest and store solar energy not only by generated holes/electrons, but also by photoinduced electron transfer or photoisomerization processes;
(2) For effective separation of electron–hole pairs and subsequent solar energy storage, the matching of the energy level and the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction are priority to achieve high performance on integrated devices. So, simulation or modeling studies would benefit the design and predict the performance of these systems.
(3) Further studies with in situ characterization would help dig in the fundamental understanding of solar conversion and energy storage processes in the device, such as in situ confocal photoluminescence, in situ X-ray diffraction, in situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy.
(4) Regarding miniaturization and practicability of solar to electrochemical energy storage devices, a standard battery configuration and test protocol should be established based on a benchmark PES material.
In summary, in the context of the increasingly severe energy problem, we believe that PES materials and solar rechargeable batteries with PES materials as electrodes in simple two-electrode devices for direct solar to electrochemical energy storage are expected to be next-generation power sources. More efforts should be devoted to this end.
