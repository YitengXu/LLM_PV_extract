    , Accepted 12th November 2013First published on 12th November 2013AbstractTwo Anderson-type heteropolyanion-supported copper phenanthroline redox couples have been successfully introduced into dye-sensitized solar cells, which can significantly increase the short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit voltage and the conversion efficiency by 2.2 times, 26.8% and 3.93 times respectively, compared to the pristine copper phenanthroline redox couple.
Nowadays, the discordant relationship between rising demand and diminishing storage of energy threatens the development of society. Exploring renewable energy resources has become an urgent affair, especially on how to take full advantage of solar energy. Hence, a large number of studies have concentrated on solar cells in succession. Among the numerous solar cells, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) pioneered by Grätzel and co-workers has attracted extensive attention since it was fabricated in 1991.1 A DSSC is typically fabricated from a dye-sensitized photoanode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte. The electrolyte, as a hinge between two conductive transparent electrodes, provides internal electric conductivity; thus it has become one of the crucial factors for determining the cell performance. The iodide/triiodide redox shuttle is a typical electron-transfer mediator working in electrolytes which have reached 11.1% under irradiation of AM 1.5.2a However, the disadvantages of the I−/I3− system have restricted the development of semiconductors, photo-sensitizers, and counter electrodes,3 such as the corrosivity of the Pt cathode, the absorption of visible light at high concentration, and the leakage from the cell due to the high vapor pressure of I2. In this regard, more and more alternative redox couples2 have been exploited, such as the halogens, interhalogens and pseudohalogens,2b non-corrosion redox couples, including Br−/Br3−,2c,d IBr2/I2Br, SCN−/(SCN)3− and SeCN−/(SeCN)3−,2eetc. But their chemical instability is a disqualifying property for practical use. Other types of alternative redox couples are transition-metal-based systems, such as Co2+/Co3+,2f Cu+/Cu2+2g,h and Ni3+/Ni4+.2i Copper model complexes have favorable properties such as high redox potentials and efficient electron transfer, which make them greatly attractive as effective electron mediators. Yanagida et al. introduced a series of blue copper model complexes ([Cu(phen)2]2+/+, [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+, and [Cu(SP)(mmt)]0/−) as redox mediators into DSSCs and investigated their efficiency for the first time, although the conversion efficiency of DSSCs (0.1%, 1.4%, and 1.3%) remains to be increased.2g Peng Wang et al. employed a C218-coated titania film and the [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ redox couple based electrolyte to fabricate DSSCs, which achieved remarkable performance. However, to our knowledge, this remarkable performance largely benefits from the bilayer mesoporous titania film coated with a high-absorption-coefficient organic photosensitizer.2h Hence, this is a long-term study on how to improve the efficiency of copper redox shuttle-based electrolytes by means of modifying copper species or adding additives.
Polyoxometalates (denoted as POMs) are a well-known class of transition metal oxide nanoclusters with well-defined structures,4 unique photoelectrochemical properties,5 reversible multielectron electrochemical reactions6 and catalytic activity.7–9 POMs are soluble and stable in a variety of conventional organic solvents. Meanwhile, in organic solvents the signals of the transition metal redox reaction could be detected in the transition metal based POMs. Differences in POM building blocks and connection may cause the shift of redox potential of the transition metal. The aforementioned properties create the possibility of introducing the POMs into the electrolytes of DSSCs. More importantly, POMs are expected to restrain fast electron–hole recombination on TiO2 owing to their long transient lifetime.10 With this concept Anandan et al. impregnated POM in polyvinylidene fluoride polymer as a solid polymer electrolyte in DSSCs and obtained expectant results.11 The above-mentioned excellent properties and pioneering studies indicate that POMs will be promising candidates to optimize the efficiency of electrolytes in DSSCs.
In this paper, we attempt to introduce two Anderson-type heteropolyanion-supported copper phenanthroline complexes {[Al(OH)6Mo6O18{Cu(phen)(H2O)2}2][Al(OH)6Mo6O18{Cu(phen)(H2O)Cl}2] (denoted as POM1-Cu-phen) and [Cr(OH)6Mo6O18{Cu(phen)(H2O)2}2][Cr(OH)6Mo6O18{Cu(phen)(H2O)Cl}2] (denoted as POM2-Cu-phen) into DSSC electrolyte as the redox shuttles for achieving high solar energy conversion in DSSC. Taking POM1-Cu-phen as an example, in the [Al(OH)6Mo6O18{Cu(phen)(H2O)2}2]1+ cation, MoO6 octahedra acts as a bidentate ligand that it coordinates to two [Cu(phen)(H2O)2]2+, similarly, in the [Al(OH)6Mo6O18{Cu(phen)(H2O)Cl}2]1− anion, MoO6 octahedra coordinates to two [Cu(phen)(H2O)Cl]1+. To summarize, the introduction of POM into [Cu(phen)2]2+/+ (denoted as Cu-phen) redox couple has three functions: (i) it shifts the redox potential of Cu(I/II) to the positive direction, thus increasing the open circuit voltage (Voc) values of DSSCs; (ii) it restrains electron–hole recombination thus increasing the short current density (Jsc) values of DSSCs; and (iii) it also facilitates electrons transfer from [Cu(phen)2]+ to the dye cation thus improving the Jsc. Above all, this heteropolyanion-supported copper phenanthroline redox couple exhibits higher conversion efficiency (η), higher Jsc and Voc compared with the Cu-phen redox couple based electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first report on the use of polyoxometalate-supported transition metal complexes in liquid electrolytes as the redox couple.
The performance of the DSSCs with POM1-Cu-phen, POM2-Cu-phen and Cu-phen redox couples based electrolytes was measured under irradiation of simulated sunlight (AM = 1.5). Fig. 1 shows that the photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs. Jsc, Voc, and fill factors (FF) are three important parameters which are used to calculate the η of DSSCs:12 (1)

The increase in Voc, Jsc, and FF would lead to higher efficiency. The resulting values of Jsc, Voc, FF and η are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that DSSCs with POM1/POM2-Cu-phen show notable performances, which are superior to those of DSSCs with the Cu-phen redox couple as a whole. In terms of Jsc, Voc, FF, and η, POM1-Cu-phen redox couple based DSSCs are significantly improved 2.2 times, 26.8%, 19.23% and 3.93 times more than Cu-phen redox couple based DSSCs, respectively. Namely, the efficiency of Cu-based DSSCs is remarkably increased after the incorporation of POM polyanions. We also measured the performance of the DSSCs with AlMo6/CrMo6-only based electrolytes under irradiation of simulated sunlight (AM = 1.5). As seen in Fig. S1,† pure POMs-only based electrolytes have almost no efficiency in DSSCs. The great disparity of the performance of DSSCs between DSSCs with POMs-Cu-phen and DSSCs with POMs-only indicates that the significant increase in the performance of DSSCs was attributed to the combination of POMs and Cu-phen. The operational principle of electron transfer processes in the interior of DSSCs involves the injection of electrons of photo-excitation dye into the conduction band of TiO2, and the regeneration of the dye molecules by electron transfer from reduced species (Cu(I)) in electrolyte. Electron–hole recombination at TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and slow electron transfer from reduced species (Cu(I)) to oxidized dye molecules certainly will reduce the performance of DSSCs. We take the POMs for an inhibitor of electron–hole recombination or a promoter of electron transfer from [Cu(phen)2]+ to dye cation, finally resulting in the improvement of the performance of Cu-phen redox couple DSSCs. As to Voc, the Voc values of the cells with POM1-Cu-phen, POM2-Cu-phen, and Cu-phen as redox couple are 472 mV, 466 mV, and 372 mV, respectively. The order of the Voc values is consistent with the redox potential values (Fig. 2), POM1-Cu-phen (EI = 0.225 V vs. NHE) ≈ POM2-Cu-phen6 (EI = 0.180 V vs. NHE) > Cu-phen (EI = 0.109 V vs. NHE) [E, defined as E = (Epc + Epa)/2].12,13 As seen in Fig. 3 process (a), it is obvious that the redox potential of Cu(I/II) positively shifts by 0.16 V with the introduction of POM, resulting in the notable increase of Voc.

Dark current–voltage experiment of DSSCs is a qualitative technique to describe the extent of the electron–hole recombination at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.14 We performed dark current–voltage measurements to investigate the back electron transfer. Fig. 4 shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs with the applied bias from 0 to +0.45 V. Under the same potential bias, the dark current for POM1/POM2-Cu-phen redox couples was noticeably smaller than that for the Cu-phen redox couple. In other words, with the introduction of POMs, the dark reaction at the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface is effectively restrained. Consequently, without losing the electron–hole recombination, more electrons that gather at the conduction band of the photoanode transfer to the external circuit to improve the performance of DSSCs.
 Fig. 4  Dark current of DSSCs with POM1-Cu-phen, POM2-Cu-phen and Cu-phen redox couple based electrolytes. 
In order to further study electron–hole recombination, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement was employed. The OCVD experiment was carried out by monitoring the decay of Voc after stopping the illumination on DSSC under open-circuit conditions.15 As seen in Fig. 5, the OCVD response of DSSCs with POMs-Cu redox couples is much slower than that of the DSSC Cu-phen redox couple. Electron lifetime (τn) was calculated with the OCVD results according to the following equation:16 (2)
 Fig. 5  Open-circuit voltage experiment for DSSCs with POM1-Cu-phen, POM2-Cu-phen and Cu-phen redox couple based electrolytes. The insert shows the relation between the electron lifetime (τn) and the voltage. 
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the positive elementary charge. The shorter the lifetime of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, the faster is the electron–hole recombination rate.17 As seen in the inset of Fig. 5, it is obvious that, at any given open-circuit potential, the electron lifetime of the POM1/POM2-Cu-phen redox couples based DSSCs was longer than that of the Cu-phen redox couple based DSSC, namely, the electron–hole recombination rate of the POMs-Cu redox couples based DSSCs was slower than that of the Cu-phen redox couple based DSSC. This suggests that the electron–hole recombination rate is reduced after the incorporation of POMs. The Jsc of DSSC is mainly influenced by dye loading and the electron–hole recombination at the photoanode.18 Dye loading is not a variable quantity in our experimental conditions. Therefore the electron–hole recombination at the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface should mainly affect the Jsc of the DSSC.
Taking the results of dark current–voltage and OCVD measurements into consideration, the introduction of POM restrains electron–hole recombination, thus improving the Jsc and ultimately improving the performance of DSSCs. The energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the materials can be measured by UPS/IPES,19 or cyclic voltammetry,20 using the reduction potentials measured for POM1/POM2-Cu-phen (Fig. 2). The LUMO levels of reduced POM1/POM2-Cu-phen in the excited state (heteropoly blue in the excited state denoted as HPB1*/HPB2*) are −3.86 eV and −3.88 eV, with reference to the reduction potential (−0.64 V vs. NHE and −0.62 V vs. NHE). Since the LUMO level of POM1/POM2-Cu-phen is higher than the level of the TiO2 conduction band (−4.3 eV),21 excited electrons could inject from HPB* into the TiO2 conduction band. It suggests that POM may participate in the following process, as seen in Fig. 3 process (b): upon photo-irradiation, HPA receives the returning electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to be reduced to the HPB form, HPB in the excited state is so active that it injects electrons into the semiconductor and then rapidly converts back to HPA, thus reducing the electron–hole recombination. In conclusion, according to the dark current—voltage and OCVD measurements, the POM was proved to be an effective inhibitor of the fast photoelectron recombination.
Fast electron transfer from reduced species [POM1/POM2-Cu(I)-phen] to dye cation contributes to efficient regeneration of the dye molecules, resulting in the improvement of the performance of DSSCs. According to the previous investigations,16 the amount of the photo-generated electrons is directly proportional to the incident irradiation power (Pin). The dependence of Jsc on various intensities of Pin can be used to investigate the electron transfer process. Hence, the photovoltaic measurements were also performed under the irradiation of various Pin. As seen in Fig. 6, the Jsc value of the DSSCs using POMs-Cu redox couple increase follows the increasing of Pin, which indicates that the electron transfer from POM1/POM2-Cu(I)-phen to the oxidized dye at high intensity irradiation light condition is also fast. However, for DSSC using the Cu-phen redox couple, the photocurrent reaches a nearly constant value when the intensity of the incident light reaches 20 mW cm−1. It may be because of the slow electron transfer from Cu-phen to the dye.2g Faster regeneration of the dye contributes to higher values of Jsc,2c so Jsc values of DSSCs with POM1/POM2-Cu-phen are sharply higher than DSSC with Cu-phen. This demonstrates that the introduction of POMs facilitates the electron transfer from [Cu(phen)2]+ to dye cation. The dependence of the η values on Pin is shown in Fig. S2.† The maximum η value (2.76% and 2.61%) is attained for DSSC using POM1/POM2-Cu-phen under light irradiation of 40 mW cm−2 intensity.

The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) experiment was carried out to detect the performance of the cells under different wavelength lights. IPCE is a measure of the external quantum efficiency, which is calculated according to the following equation:16 (3)
where λ, e, h and c are the incident wavelength, elementary charge, Planck constant and speed of light, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 7, the DSSCs with POM1/POM2-Cu-phen redox couples showed striking higher IPCE values in the wavelength range of 400–650 nm in comparison to DSSC using Cu-phen, which is consistent with their higher Jsc values. The IPCE values of the DSSCs with POM1/POM2-Cu-phen as the redox mediators were up to 48.8% and 47%, respectively, at the wavelength of 530 nm in the wavelength region 400–630 nm.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of photocurrent action spectra of DSSCs containing POM1-Cu-phen, POM2-Cu-phen and Cu-phen as the redox couples. 
Taking both η values and IPCE values into consideration, it is obvious that DSSCs using POM1/POM2-Cu-phen as the redox mediator show a better performance than DSSC using Cu-phen as the redox mediator. Moreover, a POM1-Cu-phen based electrolyte presents slightly better properties than the POM2-Cu-phen based electrolyte. We carried out UV-vis absorption measurements of POM1/POM2-Cu-phen and showed the visible region of the spectrum. As seen in Fig. S3,† it is partly ascribed to the more intensive absorption of visible light of POM2-Cu-phen than that of POM1-Cu-phen. This may arouse the competition of light harvesting with N719 thus reducing the performance of DSSCs. The absorption in infrared light is due to the Cu element in POM1/POM2-Cu-phen.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully introduced two Anderson-type heteropolyanion-supported copper phenanthroline complexes into the electrolyte of DSSCs and achieved the expected results. The incorporation of Anderson-type heteropolyanions restrains the fast electron–hole recombination at the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, facilitates the electron transfer from [Cu(phen)2]+ to dye cation, and tunes the redox potential of Cu(I/II) effectively. As a result, the Anderson-type heteropolyanion-supported copper phenanthroline redox couple exhibits higher Jsc and Voc in comparison to the Cu-phen redox couple, with the result that the performance of the Cu-phen redox couple DSSCs is improved 3.93 times. As far as we know, this is the first report on the use of POM-supported transition metal complexes as the redox couples in liquid electrolytes. More importantly, the present work extends the application of research on POMs in the DSSC field. Further studies in this line are in process.
