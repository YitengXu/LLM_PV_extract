    , Accepted 17th November 2019First published on 19th November 2019AbstractSemiconductor photocatalysis towards pollutant degradation driven by solar energy is regarded as a promising technology to solve global energy and environmental problems. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 microflowers (MFs) were hybridized with one-dimensional (1D) K2Ti6O13 nanobelts (NBs) to construct novel hierarchical Ti–O-based micro-nano heteroarchitectures (HAs) using a controlled hydrothermal route. The well-developed TiO2 MFs were featured with their petals consisting of several 1D nanostructures with the width of around 100–200 nm. Particularly, the crystal growth mechanism of the unique 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 HAs was proposed based on the time-dependent experiments combined with structural and morphological characterizations. Unexpectedly, the optimized K2Ti6O13/TiO2 composites exhibited much higher photocatalytic performance for the degradation of organic dyes and antibiotics under simulated sunlight irradiation, which was more than 2-folds higher than that of single K2Ti6O13 and TiO2 catalysts. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 composites for dye degradation was higher than that of commercial P25 under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). Apart from the advantages of hierarchical micro-nano HAs in improving light adsorption and surface area, the enhanced photocatalytic properties could be particularly attributed to the formation of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 heterojunctions that offered available interfacial channels for charge transfer and separation, as proved by the photoluminescence and photoelectrochemical measurements. Furthermore, good stability and long-term durability of the composite photocatalysts were also determined by cycling tests, mainly resulting from the tightly combined K2Ti6O13/TiO2 heterostructures. This work can be extended to design other hierarchical TiO2-based micro-nano hybrids with superior photocatalytic properties for environmental purification and solar energy conversion.
1 Introduction
As a green and promising technology, solar-driven semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted tremendous attention in the past decades due to its universal applications in degradation of organic pollutants, H2 production, CO2 reduction, water disinfection and air purification, which is significant for environmental remediation and the development of renewable energy technologies.1–5 Currently, hundreds of semiconductor materials are available for various photocatalytic applications, including metal oxides, sulfides, (oxy)nitrides, oxyhalides, vanadates, metal–organic frameworks, metal-free semiconductors, and so on.1–9 Among them, TiO2 has become one of the most extensively studied semiconductors since 1972 and still plays an important role in the field of photocatalysis, owing to its non-toxicity, low cost, good chemical stability, strong UV-light photoactivity and high oxidation potential.2,10 However, the low visible-light absorption due to wide band gaps (anatase and rutile: ca. 3.2 and 3.0 eV, respectively) and high charge recombination rate result in unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance under sunlight or visible light irradiation, which greatly hinders the practical applications of TiO2 photocatalysts.10,11 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficient and stable sunlight-responsive TiO2-based materials through facile and controllable strategies.
Up to date, numerous promising strategies have been proposed to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2via increasing light adsorption and charge separation efficiency, etc., which can be readily divided into two types: compositional and structural optimization.12 In recent years, the construction of heterostructures via coupling TiO2 to other semiconductors with well-matched energy band structures has become one of the most effective methods to fabricate high-performance TiO2-based photocatalyst systems, such as CdS/TiO2,13 Ta3N5/TiO2,14 ZnO/TiO2,15 CdTe/TiO2,16 ZnIn2S4/TiO2 (ref. 17) and BiVO4/TiO2,18 g-C3N4/TiO2,19 BiOX (X = Cl, Br)/TiO2.20 In addition, structure-engineering design at the micro/nanometer scales is also an important strategy to design highly efficient photocatalytic materials with desirable structure and morphology.10,12,21–23 Usually, 3D hierarchical photocatalysts with different dimensional levels and multimodal pore structures are assembled by various nanosized building blocks such as nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanoplates, which has superior advantages in enhancing light-harvesting ability, improving molecular diffusion/transport kinetics, increasing surface area and active sites, tailoring energy band structures, and so on.23 However, to maximize the synergistic effects of structural and compositional optimization, the facile and controlled strategies to 3D hierarchical architectures with the formation of semiconductor heterojunctions is still a challenge.
1D alkali metal titanate micro/nanomaterials (such as K2Ti6O13, Na2Ti6O13, Na2Ti3O7, K2Ti8O17, etc.) are an important kind of wide-band-gap semiconductors and especially characteristic of their good UV-light photocatalytic properties for energy and environmental applications.24–30 Meanwhile, titanates have similar structural frameworks to TiO2, i.e., TiO6 octahedron-built crystal structures (Fig. 1).24,27,28 Thus, intimate interfacial connections between titanates and TiO2 can be easily constructed via a direct phase transformation process, which provides an inspiration for the design of Ti–O-based heterostructure photocatalysts with unique structures and morphologies. Very recently, the controllable preparation of hierarchical 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts was achieved by an acid-assisted hydrothermal route.31 As a reference method, the formation mechanism of such a unique architecture is indispensable for guiding the controllable synthesis of other material systems with superior photocatalytic properties. Herein, the crystal growth and formation mechanism of hierarchical K2Ti6O13/TiO2 micro-nano HAs was emphatically discussed based on the structural and morphological characterizations. Moreover, the enhanced photocatalytic performance was further evaluated by pollutant degradation under different light irradiation. Furthermore, cycling photodegradation tests also suggested the good stability of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 composite catalysts. The combination of good stability and improved photocatalytic properties was indicative of the promising applications of 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 micro-nano HAs in photocatalytic water purification.

2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
K2Ti6O13 NBs and 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 micro-nano composites were synthesized by a typical molten salt and controlled hydrothermal method, respectively. The detailed experimental process can be seen in our previous studies.24,31 Herein, the preparation of 3D TiO2 MFs via HNO3-assisted hydrothermal route using the flux-grown K2Ti6O13 NBs as processors was schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. Note that the as-synthesized samples were denoted as KTO, HKT-1, HKT-3, HKT-5, HKT-7, HKT-12 and HKT-18, according to the different reaction time of 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 12 and 18 h, respectively.

2.2 Characterization
The structure and composition of the samples were characterized by Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra on a Raman microscope spectrometer (Renishaw, inVia Reflex) using a 514 nm laser as excitation source and the Nicolet 6700 spectrometer using KBr pellets in the region of 400 to 4000 cm−1, respectively. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with monochromatic Alα source. The morphologies and microstructures were fully characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-3400N), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI, Nova NanoSEM 450) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, EDAX Genesis XM2). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and EDS elemental mapping analysis were also collected on the JEM-2100 microscopy at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured by a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer at room temperature with excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The intermediates generated during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS, Xevo G2 TOF, Waters).
2.3 Photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants
Photocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and levofloxacin (LVF) using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfect Light Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) to offer simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation (>400 nm, a UV cutoff filter). Firstly, 100 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 100 mL of RhB aqueous solution with an initial concentration (C0) of 10 mg L−1 by ultrasonic and stirring treatment. Then, the obtained homogeneous suspension was transferred into a self-designed quartz reactor maintained at room temperature by a flow of cooling water. Prior to irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in dark for 1 h to reach the absorption–desorption equilibrium between the catalysts and dyes. At given time intervals, about 4 ml suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the catalyst powders. Lastly, the concentration of dye filtrates were measured by Lambda 950 spectrophotometer to evaluate the degradation efficiency (η, %). Herein, η was calculated by the following formula:  where Ce and C are the equilibrium-state concentration and time-dependent concentration of RhB solutions, respectively. As for photocatalytic degradation of LVF antibiotics (C0 = 20 mg L−1, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L−1), the tests were also performed using the above method.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
PEC tests were carried out using the Solartron 1260/1287 electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode quartz cell with a 300 W Xe lamp as light source. A Pt foil, Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl aqueous solution) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The catalyst films deposited on ITO substrates by a dip-coating method were served as the working electrodes. Specifically, a catalyst slurry (20 mg mL−1 in DMF) was obtained by ultrasonic and stirring treatment. A certain amount of slurry was dip-coated on the clean ITO glass and the area of catalyst film was controlled to be 0.2 cm−2. Finally, the sample film/ITO electrodes were heated at 300 °C in air to remove the organic impurities and obtain the close film adhesion.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
The phase transformation from monoclinic K2Ti6O13 to tetragonal rutile TiO2 (r-TiO2) via the acid-assisted hydrothermal treatment had been well determined by XRD analysis,31 which could be expressed by the following chemical reaction: K2Ti6O13 + 2H+ → 6TiO2 + 2K+ + H2O. To further confirm the K2Ti6O13-to-TiO2 phase transition, Raman spectra of the as-synthesized samples were shown in Fig. 3. In the case of KTO, the Raman peaks below 500 cm−1, at 651 and 857 cm−1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration of K–O–Ti, Ti–O–Ti and Ti–O bonds, respectively,32,33 which was strong evidence of K2Ti6O13 phase. HKT-1 exhibited the almost same Raman profile to KTO, revealing a stable K2Ti6O13 phase under the current experimental condition. When the reaction time increased to 5 h, apart from the K2Ti6O13 traces, HKT-5 exhibited two new peaks centered at 447 and 610 cm−1, corresponding to the Raman-active modes of tetragonal r-TiO2 with symmetry of Eg and A1g, respectively.34,35 With the increase of reaction time, r-TiO2 signals were enhanced gradually along with the decrease of K2Ti6O13 peaks. As for HKT-12 and HKT-18, the Raman peaks at 142 cm−1 and 232 cm−1 could correspond to B1g mode and multi-phonon scattering process of r-TiO2.34,35 These observations could revealed the presence of r-TiO2 phase when reaction time increased to 5 h. Nevertheless, no obvious r-TiO2 signals could be found for HKT-3, which was likely related to the low amount of TiO2 in the composites. Moreover, it was noticeable that, the peaks of r-TiO2 were wider and centered at the positions close to those of K2Ti6O13. These facts could result in the coverage of weak r-TiO2 peaks by the intense K2Ti6O13 peaks, thus explicating the absence of r-TiO2 signals in HKT-3. As compared to HKT-5, HKT-7 exhibited more intense Raman peaks of r-TiO2 and meanwhile the relative intensities of K2Ti6O13 became much weaker, implying that more K2Ti6O13 was transformed into r-TiO2 under the current conditions. Apparently, HKT-5 and HKT-7 were composed of K2Ti6O13 and r-TiO2 and the content of r-TiO2 was more than K2Ti6O13 based on their Raman intensities, consistent with XRD results.31 According to the absence of K2Ti6O13 signals in HKT-12 and HKT-18, it could be inferred that all the K2Ti6O13 precursor had changed into r-TiO2 phase after the long-term acid-assisted hydrothermal treatment (more than 12 h). Besides, the replacement of narrow Raman peaks below ca. 350 cm−1 (assigned to K–O–Ti bonding) by the broad ones could serve as a reference to recognize the phase transformation from K2Ti6O13 to r-TiO2. The Raman peaks belonging to r-TiO2 exhibited a stepwise increase in intensity, further suggesting the larger particle sizes and/or higher crystallinity of r-TiO2 products with prolonging the reaction time.35

Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared samples to get further insights into the structural evaluation of K2Ti6O13 during the hydrothermal process. Firstly, these profiles were similar to each other, which could be mainly attributed to the analogical structural features of TiO2 and K2Ti6O13 (building units: TiO6 octahedra). The bands at around 1640 cm−1 and 2750–3680 cm−1 were present in all samples, which corresponded to the bending and stretching vibration modes of hydroxyl groups (O–H) and the surface physisorbed water.32,36–38 Moreover, these bands became more intense after subject to hydrothermal treatment, probably ascribed to the protonation of K2Ti6O13 NBs in HNO3 solution (resulting in abundant O–H groups on the surface), which would be favorable for their physicochemical properties in aqueous system, such as physical adsorption (towards organic pollutants) and chemically photodegradation. Besides, a weak vibration was observed at ca. 2930 cm−1 for these samples, attributable to the strong interaction between Ti-ions and O–H groups.38 As for the samples containing only K2Ti6O13 phase (including KTO and HKT-1, based on Raman and XRD results31), the distinct characteristic bands with different intensities between 400–1500 cm−1 for potassium titanate could be observed, which were similar to the data reported for alkali-metal hexatitanates in the previous studies,37–39 thus further proving the existence of K2Ti6O13 phase. It should be pointed out that the pronounced adsorption bands belonging to K2Ti6O13 phase at 937 cm−1, 769 cm−1 and 460 cm−1 became weaker and even disappeared in the spectra of HKT-12 and HKT-18, and meanwhile the new bands between 400 and 1000 cm−1 could be assigned to the characteristic Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti stretching and bending vibrational modes of r-TiO2 lattice,40 once again proving the successful phase conversion of K2Ti6O13 into r-TiO2. To some extent, it seemed like that the FT-IR spectra of HKT-3 and HKT-5 had no significant difference in comparison with that of pristine KTO except the decreased K2Ti6O13 signals, which could be explained by the similar crystal structure of K2Ti6O13 and r-TiO2.

The surface elemental compositions and chemical states of the as-synthesized samples were further characterized by XPS technique. As shown in Fig. 5a, KTO was composed of K, Ti and O, and the atomic ratio of K/Ti was close to 1/3, suggesting the formation of K2Ti6O13 phase. Whereas, no K element could be detected on HKT-18 surface and the typical K2p peaks at 292.2 eV (K2p3/2) and 295.0 eV (K2p1/2) of K2Ti6O13 disappeared in the XPS spectrum of HKT-18 (Fig. 5b).37 The above results clearly confirmed the successful phase transformation from K2Ti6O13 to TiO2 through the acid hydrothermal route (reaction time: 18 h).

3.2 Morphological characterization
As shown in Fig. 6, HKT-5 exhibited a characteristic composite structure consisting of K2Ti6O13 NBs and TiO2 MFs, implying that HKT-5 was formed at the transition state of K2Ti6O13-to-TiO2 phase transformation process, which is in good agreement with our previous results.31 To clarify the formation mechanism of 3D TiO2 MFs and especially the unique 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 micro-nano hybrid architectures, the microstructure and crystallization characteristics of the pristine K2Ti6O13 NBs, resultant hierarchical TiO2 MFs (HKT-18) and their composites (HKT-5 and HKT-7) were further characterized by TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7a, the flux-grown K2Ti6O13 NBs exhibited a typical 1D noodle-like structure with well-defined shapes and smooth surfaces, which was strongly indicative of their highly crystalline feature. The flower-like particles shown in Fig. 7b were r-TiO2 products in HKT-18 originating from K2Ti6O13 NBs and meanwhile the dark color of TiO2 MFs can be ascribed to their large sizes and thickness. The coexistence of 1D NBs and 3D MFs in HKT-7 could be observed in Fig. 7c, and meanwhile the 3D MFs were tightly stuck in the 1D nanobelt-built structures, which was in accordance with SEM observations in Fig. 6. As for HKT-5, there were certain petal-like structures (width: 100–200 nm) peeled from 3D TiO2 MFs that could be seen in Fig. 7d–f, and interestingly these TiO2 petals looked like unpeeled corn cobs (insets in Fig. 7d and e), indicating a stable composite structure: TiO2 petals grown on 1D K2Ti6O13 NBs. Noticeably, there were many broken NBs with spinous cross-sections present in the composite samples (HKT-5 and HKT-7), probably due to the etching effect of HNO3-assisted hydrothermal treatment. Moreover, the shape and outline of NBs become blurry with light layers (seemingly amorphous products) covered on the surface, suggesting that the K2Ti6O13 NBs had been partially transformed into the heterogeneous TiO2/K2Ti6O13 NBs (hereinafter named HNBs), resulting in such significant changes in interior structure and exterior morphology. Thus, the amorphous component in Fig. 7d can be assigned to the aggregation of undefined TiO2 products, which can serve as a reference to distinguish the multiphase NBs from the intact and pristine K2Ti6O13 NBs. Particularly, it was evident in Fig. 7d–g that the formed HNBs were inserted into the petals of TiO2 MFs, implying the close contact between K2Ti6O13 NBs and TiO2 petals. To visualize the interface-phase junction, the composite sample HKT-5 was further investigated by HRTEM. In Fig. 7h, the HRTEM image recorded on a nanobelt in HKT-5 (marked by a red row in Fig. 7e), presented the wavy lattice fringes, while the pristine K2Ti6O13 nanobelt had perfect and straight lattice fringes (inset of Fig. 7h), which was related to the extraction of K+ ions from the tunnel structure of K2Ti6O13 with the generation of lattice distortion. Consequently, in spite of the well-maintained nanobelt morphology, the NBs should have suffered from the ion-exchange and surface phase transformation reaction (K2Ti6O13 + 2H+ → 6TiO2 + 2K+ + H2O). As shown in Fig. 7i, the HRTEM recorded on the petal of TiO2 MFs dispalyed more than five kinds of crystal fringes (different direction), suggesting that the resultant TiO2 petal could be assembled by at least five original K2Ti6O13 NBs through an attachment growth pathway with the formation of smooth and intimate interfaces.41,42 Based on the above results, it can be inferred that an interfacial junction will be readily constructed between K2Ti6O13 and TiO2 during the phase transformation process in the composite systems.

3.3 Formation mechanism
From the above structural and morphological characterizations, a possible mechanism responsible for the formation of hierarchical 3D TiO2 MFs and 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 HAs was proposed, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 8. From the viewpoint of structural changes, the K+ ions in the TiO6 octahedron-built tunnel networks of K2Ti6O13 were gradually extracted under the hydrothermal conditions in the presence of HNO3, thus impelling the phase transformation from monoclinic K2Ti6O13 to tetragonal r-TiO2. Herein, such a K2Ti6O13-to-TiO2 transition should be the comprehensive result of the similar crystal structures (TiO6 octahedral units) and specific hydrothermal conditions (concentration of acid solution, reaction temperature and duration time, etc.), which still needed further study. Notably, the phase transformation proceeded throughout the whole growth process of 3D TiO2 MFs until all the K2Ti6O13 precursors were exhausted. As for the morphological evaluation, the pristine K2Ti6O13 NBs with smooth and flat surfaces firstly turned into 1D HNBs, namely, more slim crystalline K2Ti6O13 NBs capsuled by the fluffy TiO2 layers, that resembled the unique 1D core–shell nanostructures.42,43 Owing to the continuous extraction of K+ ions and intense acid-etching effects, the HNBs turned into phase-pure TiO2 nanostructures and probably fractured at certain time. Meanwhile, with the increase of reaction time, the surface layers gradually thickened and then peeled off from the 1D structures, and finally were dissolved in the hydrothermal environment. To some extent, the film layers generated on K2Ti6O13 surface emphasized in turn that, the presence of smaller and naked nanobelt-derived structures. Thus, it should be pointed out that the heterogeneous nanostructures, as the primary building blocks for further grain growth, were characteristic of the weaker stability in comparison with pristine K2Ti6O13 NBs due to their exposed surface and thinner nanosized structures. Consequently, the adjacent HNBs tended to spontaneously combine with each other (or the initial TiO2 MFs) following an oriented attachment mechanism and grew together so as to minimize the surface and interfacial free energy of the system by decreasing total surface area. Such an oriented attachment and self-assembly process was responsible for the formation of larger petal-like particles and initial flower-like architectures. Along with the generation and assembly of primary building blocks, a series of complex material evaluation processes, mainly including crystallization and precipitation, anisotropic growth and Ostwald ripening of the nanostructures proceed simultaneously, which cooperatively leaded to the further growth of the aforementioned flower-like configuration and finally the formation of unique hierarchical 3D flower-like TiO2 microstructures.
 Fig. 8  Schematic illustration of the morphological evaluation from 1D K2Ti6O13 NBs to 3D TiO2 MFs. 
Therefore, the growth of 1D K2Ti6O13 NBs-derived 3D TiO2 MFs could be mainly attributed to three process: (i) continuous phase transformation from K2Ti6O13 to r-TiO2, (ii) assembly of 1D HNBs or r-TiO2 nanostructures into larger petals and initial flower-like architectures in an oriented attachment growth pathway, (iii) crystallization and precipitation of TiO2 phase on the aforementioned structures followed by the Ostwald ripening process to construct the well-defined 3D TiO2 MFs. According to the above mechanism, well-developed 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 HAs with desired and optimized ratios could be readily obtained by monitoring the intermediate growth stage (i.e., controlling the holding time of hydrothermal reaction). Importantly, it was hoped that this work would offer useful information to the fabrication of various specific 1D core–shell nanostructures and titanate-derived hierarchical micro-nano architectures for wide catalysis, energy and environmental applications.
3.4 PL spectra
To further investigate the charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer in the light-excited photocatalysts, solid-sate PL spectra of the as-prepared samples were also measured. Given that PL emission result from the recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs, the lower PL intensity means more efficient charge separation, thus a higher photoactivity. As shown in Fig. 9, the PL emission bands of these samples were mainly located at the wavelength range of ca. 350–600 nm, likely due to their similar Ti–O-based crystal structures, which was in good agreement with the previous reports.27,44–47 As for pristine KTO and HKT-1, a narrow emission band centered at ca. 364 nm can correspond to the band-to-band emission of K2Ti6O13 phase (3.43 eV). Moreover, this emission band weakened gradually for HKT-3, HKT-5 and HKT-7 owing to the decrease in K2Ti6O13 content. Notably, under the same intensity of excitation irradiation, HKT-1 exhibited a stronger PL emission band than KTO, which can be explained by the presence of surface oxygen vacancies and defect states in K2Ti6O13 NBs induced by the acid etching process.46,48 Interestingly, a slight blue-shift for HKT-1 (362 nm) and HKT-3 (361 nm) in relative to KTO (364 nm) was also found, which could be ascribed to the quantum confinement effect and also coincided with UV-vis DRS results.31 In the case of HKT-12 and HKT-18, the trace of K2Ti6O13 disappeared completely, and the broad bands at ca. 380–600 nm can be attributable to the characteristic PL signals of r-TiO2 materials.44,45,47 Herein, the shoulder appearing at 421 nm (2.95 eV) was readily assigned to the near band gap emission of r-TiO2 (O2p→Ti3d), and meanwhile the visible emission peaks at 452, 469, 483 and 493 nm were attributed to the charge transfer transition from trapped electrons in oxygen vacancies and the intrinsic defect states in TiO2 networks.45,47,49 Importantly, it should be pointed out that HKT-5 possessed the lowest PL emission intensity, meaning the highest charge-separation efficiency in the light-excited HKT-5 catalysts, which could result from the efficient interfacial charge transfer between 1D K2Ti6O13 NBs and 3D TiO2 MFs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the construction of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 hybrids with well-developed interfaces can greatly improve the photocatalytic performance via facilitating charge separation and leaving more charge carriers available for photo-induced redox reactions.

3.5 Photocatalytic activity for pollutant degradation
In the present study, RhB dye, widely used in many industrial fields such as textile, paper, leather, food, cosmetic and printing industries, was selected as a model organic pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 10a, the adsorption–desorption equilibrium results demonstrated that the samples had a similar adsorption capability with the removal percentages of RhB at ca. 15.0–20.0%, which was mainly related to their surface charges and textural characteristics (such as surface area, porous structures, etc.). The blank test without any catalysts revealed that RhB was relatively stable and the photolysis of RhB could be almost negligible. When the catalyst samples were added, as shown in Fig. 10b–d, the major adsorption peak of RhB at λmax = 554 nm decreased gradually and shifted to the shorter wavelength with unique color changes of RhB solution from initial rose red to light red or green-yellow (and finally colorless) with prolonging the illumination time, which corresponded to the deethylation (from N,N,N′,N′-tetraethylated rhodamine to rhodamine) and further decomposition of RhB into other smaller molecules (destruction of the conjugated chromophoric structure).50,51 This could be further confirmed by EIS-MS analysis of RhB solutions during the photodegradation process and the proposed degradation pathway of RhB was shown in Fig. S1.† Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of these samples could be preliminarily determined by the degree of peak shift of RhB. The above results suggested that the presence of both light illumination and catalysts was necessary for the efficient RhB degradation in water. Obviously, KTO had the lowest photocatalytic activity with a dye removal percentage of 84.5% after two hours under light irradiation. Whereas, HKT-1, possessing the same phase composition to KTO, exhibited a much higher activity than KTO for RhB degradation, which could be attributed to the introduction of surface defects on K2Ti6O13 NBs during the acid-assisted hydrothermal process that acted as charge traps to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and offered more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of HKT-18 was also higher than that of KTO, mainly resulting from the stronger light adsorption ability of HKT-18.

(e) Pseudo-first-order kinetic fitting and (f) the corresponding k values for the tested samples. 
Benefiting from the synergistic effect between 1D K2Ti6O13 NBs and 3D TiO2 MFs, a pronounced increase in photodegradation performance was observed for the composite samples (taking HKT-5 for example) in comparison with the single-component catalysts (KTO and HKT-18), which could be clearly confirmed by the corresponding time-dependent UV-vis spectra and photographs of RhB solutions.
To investigate the photocatalytic reaction kinetics for RhB degradation in aqueous solution, the degradation data was fitted by the pseudo-first-order kinetic equation:−ln(C/Ce) = ktwhere t and k represents the light irradiation time and apparent reaction rate constant (min−1), respectively. The linear relationships of −ln(C/Ce) versus irradiation time and the determined apparent rate constants of the tested samples were displayed in Fig. 10e and f, respectively, clearly revealing the photoactivity order of the as-tested samples: HKT-5 > HKT-3 > HKT-7 > HKT-1 > HKT-12 > HKT-18 > KTO. More specifically, HKT-5 exhibited the highest k value (0.045 min−1), which was about 3.2 and 2.4 times higher than that of KTO (k = 0.014 min−1) and HKT-18 (k = 0.019 min−1), respectively. It suggested that the successful construction of hierarchical 3D TiO2 microflower/1D K2Ti6O13 nanobelt hybrids could effectively improve photoactivity for RhB degradation. Moreover, it was also found that (in Fig. 11) HKT-5 showed higher visible-light photocatalytic activity (0.024 min−1) for RhB degradation than single K2Ti6O13 (0.012 min−1), TiO2 (0.016 min−1) and commercial P25 (0.018 min−1), which could be mainly ascribed to synergy of Ti–O-based heterojunction and hierarchical 1D nanobelt/3D microflower HAs. Table 1 shows the comparison of photocatalytic performance based on various TiO2-based materials from other literature, highlighting the superiority of the as-designed K2Ti6O13/TiO2 composites for RhB degradation.

In addition, to further confirm the improved photocatalytic activity of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 micro-nano HAs, the tests for LVF degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation by KTO, HKT-5 and HKT-18 were also carried out. As shown in Fig. S2a and b,† HKT-5 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, which was more than 2 times higher than that of KTO and HKT-18. The characteristic peak of LVF at ca. 288 nm decreased gradually in the presence of HKT-5 with the increase of irradiation time (Fig. S2c†), indicating the decomposition of LVF molecules. Furthermore, Fig. S2d† showed that HKT-5 had good stability for photocatalytic degradation of LVF antibiotics, which could be ascribed to the tightly combined K2Ti6O13/TiO2 heterostructures.
3.6 Possible mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic performance
Based on the above results, it could be concluded that the formation of 1D/3D micro-nano heteroarchitectures would increase the specific surface area and porosity, which could promote the photocatalytic reactions via improving light adsorption and surface adsorption as well as diffusion/mass transfer of reactant molecules.23,24 More importantly, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 hybrids could be mainly assigned to the promoted charge transfer and separation process based on the K2Ti6O13/TiO2 heterostructures with more available charge-transfer channels, as confirmed by PL analysis. To further investigate the charge transfer behaviors in composite photocatalysts, PEC measurements were also carried out, including transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).
As shown in Fig. 12a, an obvious photocurrent response was observed for the three electrodes under the chopped light irradiation, suggesting the good photoactivity of TiO2 and K2Ti6O13 semiconductors. Noticeably, HKT-5 exhibited the higher photocurrent responses than HKT-18 and KTO, indicating that the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes was significantly improved through the combination of TiO2 MFs and K2Ti6O13 NBs in HKT-5. Besides, EIS Nyquist plot can reflect the interface reaction rate and charge transfer efficiency. In general, a smaller arc radius means a more efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and faster charge migration across the electrode/electrolyte interface. As shown in Fig. 12b, the arc radius of HKT-5 was smaller than that of KTO and HKT-18, suggesting the higher charge separation efficiency in K2Ti6O13/TiO2 composites than that in single K2Ti6O13 NBs and TiO2 MFs. Thus, the PEC results were in consistent with PL analysis, revealing that the increased charge separation efficiency of K2Ti6O13/TiO2 composites could be mainly attributed to the formation of interfacial heterostructures between K2Ti6O13 NBs and TiO2 MFs. It could greatly contribute to the photocatalytic reactions for pollutant degradation.
 Fig. 12  (a) Transient photocurrent responses and (b) EIS plots of the as-synthesized samples. 
According to above results and our previous studies,24,31,37 the mechanism for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance was proposed. Firstly, K2Ti6O13 NBs cannot be excited by the visible light (>400 nm), while HKT-5 and HKT-18 (due to the existence of r-TiO2 MFs) are visible-light responsive samples although the photon absorption efficiency is considerably low, according to the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 13a). As shown in Fig. 13b, efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers across the K2Ti6O13/TiO2 heterostructures were achieved on the basis of the potential difference between K2Ti6O13 (ECB = −0.81 eV, EVB = 2.63 eV) and TiO2 (ECB = −0.20 eV, EVB = 2.82 eV).31 Hence, more photogenerated electron and holes would be available for the production of reactive species (such as ˙OH and ˙O2−) and the oxidative decomposition of RhB molecules. Besides, it was worthy to point out that the dye sensitization process was indispensable for the improved visible-light photocatalytic reactions towards RhB degradation because the light-induced electrons could transfer from dye molecules to conduction band of TiO2 and K2Ti6O13 and thus contributed to the following photodegradation process.

4 Conclusions
In summary, novel hierarchical 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 micro-nano HAs were successfully synthesized using a controlled hydrothermal method. The formation mechanism of the unique 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 HAs was proposed according to the structural and morphological characterizations. The K2Ti6O13/TiO2 hybrids exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than the single catalysts for the degradation of RhB and LVF contaminants. In addition to the advantages in light adsorption and surface areas of 1D/3D K2Ti6O13/TiO2 HAs, the main factor responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance could be the promoted charge transfer and separation across heterojunction interfaces, as supported by PL and PEC measurements. Moreover, the composites showed good stability for pollutant degradation, due to the formation of closely coupled heterostructures. Furthermore, plausible mechanisms for enhanced photocatalytic RhB degradation under visible-light illumination was also proposed. It was anticipated that this strategy could be extended to controllably fabricate other TiO2-based composites with hierarchical micro-nano architectures for potential applications in pollutant degradation, water splitting, energy storage, and so on.
