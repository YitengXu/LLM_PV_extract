It is of great interest and importance to rapidly and sensitively detect disease-related biomarkers, environmental pollutants (e.g., heavy metals and other chemical contaminants), which are severely detrimental to human and animal life and the environment as a whole. Further, efficacious sensing is required for the detection of food resident contaminants (e.g., bacteria, viruses and parasites) and for the verification of the therapeutic ingredients of dietary supplements. Enzyme kinetics is another interesting domain that employs SWV as an effective analytical tool for the mechanistic study of enzyme reactions. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the electrochemical SWV method and its significant applications in sensing and biosensing spanning various fields such as diagnosis, environmental and food analysis and enzyme kinetics. The development of novel and improved electrode surfaces and nanomaterials introduces the possibility of sensors and biosensors that will exhibit even higher sensitivity, with SWV serving as an ideal methodology for its optimization. Concurrent with a better understanding of electrochemistry and life sciences, sensors and biosensors based on SWV have the potential to serve as next generation point-of-care diagnostic devices, as well as highly sensitive and selective detectors for food/environmental monitoring and enzyme studies.Aicheng ChenAicheng Chen is a Professor of Chemistry and Canada Research Chair at Lakehead University.

The main advantages of using voltammetric methods over spectroscopy or chromatography include their high sensitivity, precision, accuracy and cost effectiveness. In the past, voltammetric techniques were difficult to apply and were not nearly as useful as they are today. Present techniques are largely available due to the advent of computers and their key role in the control and measurement of the potentials and currents of potentiostats. Previous polargraphic techniques have advanced largely due to better instrumentation and improved electrode materials.In recent years, the use of square wave voltammetry (SWV) has been a staple in the fabrication of sensitive electrochemical sensors and biosensors. The effectiveness of a sensor is directly proportional to how sensitive and selective it is as relates to its analyte.6 This responsiveness may be increased by applying a more sensitive electrochemical technique such as SWV. Other methods for increasing sensitivity include the modification or development of more effective electrodes. Investigations regarding the effect of electrodes on sensitivity and detection limits have been conducted using boron-doped diamond film electrodes,7 carbon paste electrodes,8 metal oxide based nanowires/nanotubes,9 and carbon nanotubes.10 Each of these studies involved the utilization of modified or bare electrodes in which SWV was employed as the primary methodology.A survey of relevant papers spanning the last ten years in which SWV was utilized as a methodology in sensor development reveals that the technique is increasing in popularity as shown in Fig. 1. The application of this technique for analytical purposes is gaining ground and becoming recognized as a useful methodology. This is evidenced by the doubling of the number of associated publications per year over the last ten years. Fig. 1  Number of publications reporting the use of square wave voltammetry as an electroanalytical technique (2003–2012) based on Web of KnowledgeSM (December 21, 2012). This methodology has impacted multiple fields including diagnostics, environmental analysis, food sciences, enzyme kinetics and pharmaceuticals. This review will examine each of these areas as derived from the literature mainly over the last five years, but save for pharmaceutical applications, which have been extensively catalogued.11–15 Finally, the assessment and future prospects for the advancement of sensors and biosensors, which have evolved through the implementation of SWV, and unique electrode materials will be addressed.2 PrincipleThe most common voltammetric techniques are based on the continuous alteration of the potential that is applied to the solution through the electrode, coupled with the measurement of the resulting current. The most popular continuous wave technique is cyclic voltammetry (CV), which is used to determine the nature of the redox reactions that take place in a solution. This strategy, although not as sensitive as the pulse techniques, has a multitude of uses beyond the trace determination of an analyte. CV is most often used as a tool for the acquisition of critical data such as oxidation/reduction mechanisms, the determination of formal potentials, electron transfer and electron transfer kinetics.16Waveforms for different types of voltammetry and current sampling time are depicted in Fig. 2. The waveform for CV is linear; therefore the potential is continuously modified as a linear function of time. Of all electroanalytical techniques, the pulse strategies tend to be the most sensitive. Procedures such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), normal pulse voltammetry (NPV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) have been repeatedly shown to be some of the most useful electroanalytical techniques. These methods alter the potential of a sample through pulsing from one potential to another rather than sweeping through varying potentials, as is the case with cyclic voltammetry. For DPV, current is sampled at points S1 and S2. The typical value of T ranges from 0.5 to 5.0 s, while the value of tp is on the order of 50 ms. If we consider current at points S1 and S2 as I1 and I2, respectively, the difference of I2 − I1 represents the current due to the application of pulse. The waveform of SWV can be seen as a special case of DPV waveform, where the pre-electrolysis period (T) and pulse period (tp) are of equal duration. The waveform of SWV is a symmetrical square wave on a staircase; current is sampled twice per cycle, at the end of each pulse, as shown in Fig. 2. The forward sample S1 arises from the first pulse per cycle, while the reverse current is sampled at the end of the second pulse. The difference is calculated as forward current − reverse current (S1 − S2). Fig. 2  Waveforms for CV, DPV and SWV with the current sampling time. The core principle behind pulse techniques resides in the difference in the decay rates of the charging and faradaic currents. The charging current decays much more rapidly than the faradaic current due to its decaying as an exponential function, while the decomposition of the faradaic current is inversely proportional to the square root of time.11,12 Therefore, at the conclusion of each pulse the capacitive current is negligible compared to that of the faradaic current.17 This increased ratio of faradaic to non-faradaic current allows for a lower detection limit as well as higher sensitivity, and is therefore ideal for analytical purposes. SWV can be applied for the analysis of reversible and irreversible reactions, reaction with slow electron transfer as well as for catalytic reactions. O'dea et al. have calculated experimentally measurable parameters such as peak shifts, heights, and widths for different types of reactions and plotted them as a function of the appropriate rate constants.2SWV is often utilized due to its ability to be operated at high frequency.11 This means that square wave utilized experiments may be accomplished quickly and can conserve electroactive species with respect to other pulse techniques.18 Since there is a decrease in the use of electroactive species, electrode surfaces tend to be less hindered with non-electroactive products. Another advantage of SWV is that the exclusion of oxygen from the analyte solution may not be necessary due to the reduction of oxygen being included in the background current.12 This, of course, is dependent on whether the applied potential is more cathodic than that for the reduction of oxygen. If the potential is indeed more cathodic, the magnitude of the forward and reverse currents will both include the current from the reduction of oxygen and will be subtracted from the background.The square wave frequency is a parameter that arises from the use of the square wave on the staircase potential and is the frequency at which the analyte is sampled. Each pulse results in a small increment of potential and hence, should the frequency of the pulses increase then an increase in the rate at which the potential is scanned occurs. Similar to cyclic voltammetry, the increase in the sweep rate will also correspond to an increase in the peak current. However, this also involves an increase in the peak potential, and unlike in a CV, this shift in peak potential will be proportional to the logarithm of the square wave frequency. Chatterjee and Chen showed an increase in the peak current and potential with the increase in square wave frequency as seen in Fig. 3.19 Fig. 3  The effect of square wave frequency on the peak current (A) and peak potential (B) of guanine. A linear increase in the square wave frequency showed a linear increase in the peak current, while a linear increase of peak potential was seen with an increase in the log of f.

A comparison of the three main voltammetric techniques is depicted in Fig. 4, which shows the voltammograms of a glass carbon electrode (GCE) recorded in a 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution in the presence of (red curve) and in the absence (blue curve) of 50 μM of 4-nitrophenol. The characteristics of these voltammograms follow the trends that are expected of them, with the peak current of SWV being approximately four times larger than that of DPV.11 The positive aspects of square wave voltammetry far outweigh any negatives; thereby affording further credence for its use as a dynamic and versatile technique. SWV has been widely applied in medical diagnostics, environmental analysis, food sciences and toward the determination of enzymatic kinetics.

In recent times various approaches have been employed in sensing/biosensing for various disease biomarkers. Primary approaches include immunoassay, antibody-functionalized magnetic beads and DNA decorated electrodes.There are numerous studies related to electrochemical sensing/biosensing of various analytes for diagnostic purposes using SWV. Various papers relating to diagnostic electrochemical sensors or biosensors based on SWV are listed in Table 1. For instance, Reisberg et al. have developed an electrochemical DNA hybridization sensor that has the remarkable capacity for detection down to the resolution of a single point mutation (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)).39 This sensor is based on a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe that is attached to a quinone-derived electroactive polymer, poly(JUG-co-JUGA). As shown in Fig. 5, upon the hybridization of the PNA probe with a complementary target DNA strand, changes in the flexibility of the PNA probe strand generate electrochemical changes at the polymer–solution interface. An increase in the peak current of quinone was observed by SWV; whereas no change was observed with a non-complementary sequence. This sensor has very strong potential to be used in the genetic diagnosis of various diseases that are caused by SNP. An electrochemical genosensor was developed by Liao et al. for the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, a verocytotoxin (VT1/2)-producing pathogen, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and severe haemolytic-uremic syndrome.55 It is commonly found in ground beef, unpasteurized or raw milk, cold sandwiches, vegetables, apple cider and drinking water. In this paper, electrodeposited gold nanoparticle screen-printed electrodes were developed and modified with a self-assembled monolayer of thiol-capped single-stranded DNA (capture probe) for the detection of the rfbE gene, which is specific for E. coli O157:H7. As depicted in Fig. 6A, this genosensor functions on the principle of competitive assay; competition between the target gene in E. coli (complementary to the DNA capture probe) and the DNA-tagged reporter hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride-encapsulated liposomes for hybridization. As shown in Fig. 6B, when the reporter DNA binds with the capture probe, the current signal is increased via the released liposomal Ru(NH3)63+. When both the target DNA in E. coli and reporter DNA are present, the intensity of the current is contingent on the amount E. coli present. Liu et al. have developed an immunosensor for interferon gamma (INF-γ), which is a cytokine produced by T cells and NK cells.48 It is used in the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and severe malignant osteopetrosis. An electrode was fabricated by immobilizing a thiolated DNA hairpin containing an IFN-γ binding aptamer that was conjugated with a methylene blue (MB) redox tag on a gold electrode via self-assembly. As presented in Fig. 7, when IFN-γ combines with its binding site on the aptamer it unfolds and pushes the MB away from the electrode, which in turn decreases the electron transfer efficiency. Changes in the redox current due to this process were observed by SWV. Ho and Liao have developed an immunosensor for the detection of immunogenic tumor-associated antigen α-Enolase (ENO1), which is associated with small cell lung cancers, non-small cell lung cancers and head and neck cancers. Thus the detection of ENO1 may be employed as a potential diagnostic test for lung cancer.56 As is shown in Fig. 8, the electrode was fabricated by immobilizing anti-ENO1 monoclonal antibodies on a disposable polyethylene glycol-modified screen-printed electrode. Gold nanoparticles were tagged with polyclonal secondary anti-ENO1 antibodies and used as detection probes. Subsequent to binding with ENO1, electrochemical signals from the bound nanoparticles were obtained following their oxidation in 0.1 M HCl at 1.2 V for 120 s, followed by the reduction of AuCl4− by square wave voltammetry. Li et al. have developed a biosensor based on aptamers for the detection of angiogenin, one of the most potent angiogenic factors, which is involved with angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) in tumors.25 The electrode was fabricated by immobilizing anti-angiogenin aptamers on a bare gold electrode, while ferro/ferricyanide couples were employed as redox couples. The binding of analytes with the aptamers on the surface of the electrode makes them less available for the redox couples, resulting in a decrease in current that may be observed by SWV. Labib et al. developed an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor for the detection of HIV-1 virus reverse transcriptase (HIV1 RT).45 The HIV virus is responsible for causing AIDS and its early detection can be very useful in the diagnosis of the disease. This biosensor was based on the formation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), comprised of a synthesized ferrocene (Fc) labeled lipoic acid on a gold electrode. For the detection of HIV-1 RT, a short RT-specific peptide (VEAIIRILQQLLFIH) was covalently attached to the Fc labeled lipoic acid. When the RT was bound to its specific peptide, the anodic shift and reduction of current density of the Fc redox were observed by SWV. This biosensor has a very sensitive (50 pg mL−1) limit of detection, and a rapid (20 s) response time, compared with other methods such as ELISA and western blot. More examples related to diagnostic electrochemical sensors or biosensors based on SWV can be found in Table 1.

It is well understood that increasingly pervasive chemical contaminants in the atmosphere and waterways are severely detrimental to human and animal life and the environment as a whole. Various techniques such as HPLC, GC, FT-IR and other wet chemistry methods are being used for the detection of various pollutants such as phenolic compounds, heavy metals and organophosphate pesticides. All of these techniques suffer from various drawbacks, while electrochemical methods offer advantages, including rapid and sensitive detection and cost effectiveness.

A TNT selective, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) modified carbon paste electrode was used for the sensitive detection/recognition unit. The LOD and linear range for this sensor were 1.5 × 10−9 mol L−1 and 5 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−6 mol L−1, respectively.95 Mazloum-Ardakani et al. proposed a sensor that was based on a TiO2 nanoparticle and quinizarine modified carbon paste electrode for the sensitive determination of hydroxylamine. The anodic oxidation of hydroxylamine at the electrode surface was observed by SWV, and the LOD and linear range for this sensor were 0.173 μM and 1.0–400 μM, respectively.77 A sensor for the detection of the extremely toxic insecticide fenitrothion was developed by Pellicer et al. using a portable device, which was based on a molecularly imprinted polymer modified screen-printed electrode. The selectivity of this sensor was tested via the detection of fenitrothion while in the presence of some potential interfering compounds, such as metamitron, fenitrothion-oxon and methyl-parathion. The LOD and linear range for this sensor were 8 × 10−7 M and 3 × 10−6 to 10−4 mol L−1, respectively.75 Noroozifar et al. proposed a sensor for the detection of cyanide in wastewater samples. This sensor was fabricated through the modification of a glassy carbon electrode with silver hexacyanoferrate nanoparticle (SHCFNP) doped MWCNTs. The cyanide reacted with the SHCFNPs to produce Ag(CN)2− complexes, which may be reduced to Ag in an electrochemical reaction. The LOD and linear range for this sensor were found to be 8.3 nM and 40 nM–150 μM, respectively.71 Du et al. developed a biosensor for the detection of organophosphorylated acetylcholinesterase (OP-AChE), which is a biomarker that indicates exposure to organophosphate pesticides. This biosensor works on the principle of a sandwich immunoassay. As shown in Fig. 9, zirconia nanoparticles were immobilized on a screen printed electrode to capture the OP-AChE via metal chelation with phosphomoieties in an enzyme. This AChE enzyme was detected via a lead phosphate apoferritin labeled anti-AChE antibody. Subsequent to these immunoreactions, the released lead ions were detected by SWV. This biosensor can be employed to screen for organophosphate pesticide exposure in humans because of its low limit of detection (0.02 nM) and wide linear range (0.05–10 nM).88 Atrazine (ATZ) is a highly toxic, mutagenic and teratogenic herbicide that is in wide use. Tran et al. proposed an immunosensor for the highly selective determination of atrazine, based on a poly(JUG-HATZ) and anti-ATZ modified glassy carbon electrode. The polymer contains a hydroxyatrazine functional group, which serves as a bio-recognition element. The changes in current prior to and following the addition of atrazine serve as an indicator, as shown in Fig. 10.61 More examples associated with the broad application of SWV for environmental monitoring are summarized in Table 2.

The contamination of food stuffs with bacteria, viruses and parasites comprises the major source of foodborne diseases. The high resolution detection of these agents may significantly facilitate the prevention of these illnesses. The detection of food allergens/pathogens and the recognition and quantification of therapeutically valuable ingredients in dietary supplements hold equivalent importance. Recent advances in the field of SWV-based sensors/biosensors for food analysis are summarized in Table 3.

Both of these compounds are in wide use as artificial sweeteners in variety of products. In a number of countries such as Canada, the USA and several European countries, cyclamate is prohibited as an artificial sweetener due to its possible conversion to cyclohexylamine, a potent carcinogen. A boron doped diamond electrode and SWV were utilized in this sensor, where anodic peak potentials of 1.5 V (aspartame) and 1.9 V (cyclamate) were observed for analytical purposes. This sensor exhibited good selectivity and sensitivity with a LOD and linear range for aspartame of 3.5 × 10−7 mol L−1 and 5.0 × 10−6 to 4.0 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively. For cyclamate, the LOD and linear range were 4.5 × 10−6 mol L−1 and 5.0 × 10−5 to 4.0 × 10−4 mol L−1, respectively.96 A sensor proposed by Barbosa et al. was used to detect trace quantities of the antibiotic ceftiofur in milk. A hanging mercury drop electrode was used for analysis and a LOD of 1.86 ng mL−1 was obtained, which is five times lower than the LOD obtained from HPLC analysis (9.70 ng mL−1).103 Miranda et al. developed a sensor for the detection of lipoic acid in dietary supplements. Lipoic acid is utilized in the treatment of diabetes and various other diseases. A fluorine doped tin oxide electrode was used to observe an anodic peak at about 0.95 V. The proposed sensor was highly sensitive, with a LOD of 3.68 μmol L−1 and a linear range of 5–200 μmol L−1 (ref. 105). Perotta et al. proposed an immunosensor for the sensitive detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) in red wine. OTA is a secondary fungal metabolite produced primarily by several Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. OTA is typically found in improperly stored food including cereals, dried fruits, nuts and beverages, such as beers and wines. OTA is a powerful nephrotoxic, teratogenic and immunosuppressive agent. The proposed sensor was based on the competitive immunoreactions between monoclonal anti-OTA antibodies that are attached to magnetic beads, and OTA and HRP attached to an anti-OTA antibody. H2O2 was used as a substrate for the HRP enzyme and a screen printed electrode was used for SWV analysis.108 Chatterjee et al. have developed a sensor based on the platinum electrodeposited SWCNT modified GCE for determination of an α-dicarbonyl compound: methylglyoxal in wine and beer. This compound is of interest as it is associated with the pathophysiology of diabetes, and is being utilized as an indicator of complete fermentation in wine and beer. The proposed sensor exhibits a LOD of 2.8 × 10−9 M with the linear range from 0.1 × 10−6 to 100 × 10−6 M.107 More examples of SWV-based sensors/biosensors for food analytics can be found in Table 3.6 Application of SWV in biosensors for the study of enzyme kineticsA novel and effective use of electrochemical biosensors resides in the realm of enzymatic kinetics studies. In addition to their serving as integral elements in various industrial processes, enzymes also play a vital role in the pathogenesis of various diseases. A biosensor that is endowed with the capacity to determine enzymatic activity may impart multiple benefits. Martic et al. developed a biosensor to determine the activity and inhibition of an enzyme sarcoma (src)-related protein kinase. The overexpression of protein kinase is associated with the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cancer; therefore it is a viable target for cancer treatment. Some of the important protein kinase inhibitors currently used in cancer treatment are gefitinib, desatinib and imatanib. This biosensor can be utilized in high throughput screening for protein kinase inhibitors. For analytical purposes, protein kinase was observed to catalyze phosphorylation reactions in the presence of adenosine 5′-γ-ferrocenoyl triphosphate (FcATP). As shown in Fig. 11, the sensor platform is based on a highly specific amino acid sequence Glu-Gly-Ile-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro (EGIYDVP), to which a FcPO2 moiety may be transferred from FcATP via the action of the src related protein kinase. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined for src related protein kinase with respect to the FcATP co-substrate, and were found to be 200 mM and 115 mA cm−2 min. for the phosphorylation of the EGIYDVP peptide substrate.115 Recent advances in sensors/biosensors for the determination of enzyme kinetics are summarized in Table 4.

The sensitivity of SWV coupled with its high frequency was demonstrated as an ideal technique for the development of rapid response and reliable sensors. The usefulness of this technique was elucidated for applications in diagnostics, environmental analysis, the food industry and the measurement of enzymatic activity. The development of novel and improved electrode surfaces and nanomaterials introduces the possibility of sensors that will exhibit even higher sensitivity, with SWV serving as an ideal methodology for its optimization. Concurrent with the greater knowledge of electrochemistry and a better understanding of electrode synthesis and modification, sensors will improve considerably in terms of both sensitivity and detection limits. Micro- and nano-sensors will likely constitute the next disruptive paradigm in the field of sensing and biosensing, and SWV will surely play a critical role in their development. Advances in these areas will be sure to spark innovations in industry and society as a whole.AbbreviationsBDDEBoron Doped Diamond ElectrodeCPECarbon Paste ElectrodedsDNADouble stranded DNAEPPGEEdge Plane Pyrolytic Graphite ElectrodeGCEGlassy Carbon ElectrodeHMDEHanging Mercury Drop ElectrodeJUG-HATZ[N-(6-(4-hydroxy-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino)hexyl)-5-hydroxy 1,4-naphthoquinone-3-propionamide]MBMethylene BlueMWCNTMulti-Walled Carbon NanotubesSWCNTSingle Walled Carbon NanotubesPGEPyrolytic Graphite Electrode.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).
