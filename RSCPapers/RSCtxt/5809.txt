    , Accepted 20th May 2015First published on 20th May 2015AbstractIn the present investigation, tetragonal p-type stannite group member Cu3SbSe4 has been successfully synthesized in an aqueous alkaline medium using a self organized arrested precipitation technique (APT). The deposited thin films were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is investigated by the measurement of the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity of deposited thin films. On the basis of experimental details, the reaction mechanism is also discussed in detail. Optical absorption spectra show direct allowed type transition with a band gap energy of 1.96 eV. XRD results indicate that APT is a favourable technique to synthesize pure Cu3SbSe4 thin films having a tetragonal crystal structure. FESEM and HRTEM micrographs of Cu3SbSe4 show spherically diffused granular morphology having an average grain size of 40 nm. EDS and XPS spectra confirm the presence of Cu, Sb and Se elements in the composition. The compact nature leads to a higher electrical conductivity and a smaller grain size of the material leads to lower thermal conductivity in thin films, so that a promising ZT value is obtained at room temperature (0.2 at 300 K). The present work provides a new method to engineer efficient thermoelectric material for power generation in an effective manner.
1. Introduction
Synthesis of stoichiometric ternary metal chalcogenides by a simple approach is an attractive and challenging task due to their unique physical and chemical properties.1 Since the last four decades, scientists have been attempting to find out alternative renewable energy sources to traditional energy sources. In recent years more efforts have been made to utilize the waste environmental energy by introducing alternative energy conversion routes such as solar cells,2 fuel cells,3 water splitting for hydrogen production,4 nanogenerators,5,6 as well as thermoelectricity.7 In the past few years copper containing chalcogenides have become promising materials due to their potential applications in photovoltaic, photocatalytic and thermoelectric devices. Nowadays semiconducting materials of I–V–VI group chalcogenides gained increasing attention as they showed good electronic transport properties like low thermal conductivity, near-optimum band gap energy and a large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1).8–12 Among the group I–V–VI elements Cu–Sb–Se forming highly conducting solid solutions with varying compositions such as CuSbSe2,13 Cu3SbSe314 and Cu3SbSe412 have been reported. With respect to its availability and low cost it was suggested as an alternative to CIGS.15 Cu–Sb–Se has been studied as a promising material for photovoltaics as well as thermoelectric purposes.12,13,16,17 The thermoelectric materials are used to convert heat energy to electrical energy and their efficiency depends on the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT). Thermoelectric materials are also used in refrigerators which utilize electricity for cooling. An ideal thermoelectric material should have high electrical conductivity, high power factor (S2σ) and low thermal conductivity.
However, very few physical and chemical techniques have been utilized to synthesize Cu–Sb–Se materials that usually require high processing temperature. In the last few decades CuSbSe2 has been deposited by direct fusion technique18,19 and the effect of different doping metals was also studied.16,20,21 D. Colombara et al.15 have prepared CuSbSe2 thin films by simple evaporation of metal precursors followed by annealing in a chalcogen environment. X. Y. Li et al.12 have studied thermoelectric properties of bismuth doped Cu3SbSe4 prepared by the melting method and the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique, and the ZT achieved is 0.7 at 600 K. Some combinatory techniques with electrodeposition like chemical bath deposition22 and rapid thermal annealing23 were also reported. Recently D. Li et al.24,25 have reported a low-temperature co-precipitation route and by doping of metal this group has achieved a highest ZT value of 1.1 at 700 K. A low temperature solvothermal method was also reported to synthesize Plank-like crystals26 and recently nanocrystals of Cu3SbSe4 have been reported by the hot-injection method having a bang gap of 1.31 eV.14 Last year Tyagi et al.27,28 and Wei et al.29,30 have reported mechanical fusion, followed by a spark plasma sintering method for the synthesis of this material. Last year we have reported a microwave assisted synthesis technique for the deposition of Cu3SbSe4 thin films.31 However, these methods require high temperature and time consuming manufacturing processes. Despite previously reported methods, there is still need to develop a simple and cost effective synthesis route to deposit the Cu–Sb–Se material. Hence we have developed a new low cost and effective method for the synthesis of Cu3SbSe4 thin films i.e. the arrested precipitation technique (APT). Nowadays, the synthesis of thin films based on APT is found to be a good technique in comparison with other routine methods, because it is simple, of low cost, energy efficient and consumes less time. APT is also known as a modified chemical bath deposition technique. Recently the synthesis of nanostructures of oxides,32 sulphides,33 selenides and tellurides34 and mixed metal chalcogenides35 was achieved successfully by using a chemical route for optoelectronic applications. The APT is based on simple arresting (complex formation) of metal ions using an organic complexing agent and the so formed stable complex facilitates slow release of metal ions in reaction mixture. The released metal ions react with chalcogen ions and a metal chalcogenide molecule is formed.
Herein, an effort has been made for the first time to synthesize thin films of copper antimony selenide using a simple and rapid self organized APT. The non-hazardous, biocompatible and phosphine free complexing agent, tartaric acid was used for the deposition of Cu3SbSe4 thin films. An aqueous alkaline medium was maintained for 4 h to deposit good quality thin films. The deposited thin films were characterized by different characterization techniques to study optostructural and optoelectronic properties. The thermal properties were also investigated to demonstrate the applicability of the Cu3SbSe4 thin films in a thermoelectric device.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All the chemicals were of analytical reagent (AR) grade and were used as received without further purification. In the typical experiment, copper sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O, 99.5% Ranbaxy) and antimony trichloride (SbCl3, 99.0% Merck) were used as a source of Cu and Sb ions with tartaric acid (C4H6O6, 99.0% S D Fine Chem) as a complexing agent. Aqueous sodium selenosulphite (Na2SeSO3) solution was used as a source of Se, which was obtained by refluxing selenium metal powder (Se, 99.5% Sigma Aldrich) with a saturated solution of sodium sulphite (Na2SO3, 97.0% S D Fine Chem) as per our earlier report.31 Ammonia (NH3, 28.0–30.0% Thomas Baker) was used to adjust the pH of the reaction bath and ammonium acetate (C2H4O2·NH3, 96.0% S D Fine Chem) was used as buffer solution. Ultrasonically cleaned glass substrates were used for the deposition of Cu3SbSe4 thin films.
2.2 Deposition
For the deposition of Cu3SbSe4 thin films, the bath was prepared in a 50 ml reaction container. In a typical synthesis, 5 ml (0.25 M) of CuSO4·5H2O and 5 ml of (0.25 M) SbCl3 with 1 M tartaric acid were taken. After this 1 ml of ammonium acetate were added as a buffer solution and the pH of the resultant solution was maintained at 9.0 by adding NH3. During the addition of NH3 the solution turns dark blue coloured. Then the reaction bath was stirred vigorously for 1 min and freshly prepared 10 ml of (0.25 M) Na2SeSO3 was added followed by the addition of distilled water to make a total volume of up to 40 ml. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for 2 min to get a homogeneous colourless solution. Finally the ultrasonically cleaned glass substrates were mounted vertically in the reaction container and kept at room temperature. After 4 h the as deposited thin films were taken out from the reaction bath and were washed with double distilled water 2 to 3 times and dried at 60 °C in a hot air oven. The thickness of films has been measured using a surface profiler and was observed to be 700 nm. The as deposited films are made up of CuSbSe2 with presence of other mixed phases as per our earlier report,31 and to obtain a pure Cu3SbSe4 material the as deposited films were annealed at 473 K for 1 h and were used for further characterization. The possible schematic growth mechanism for deposition of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film is given in Fig. 1. The reproducibility of the thin films was examined by performing repeated depositions under the same conditions and all time pure Cu3SbSe4 thin films were obtained after annealing.

2.3 Characterizations
The optical absorption study of nanocrystalline Cu3SbSe4 thin films was carried out using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300 to 1100 nm (Shimadzu UV-1800). To study the structural properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker AXS, D8 Model with Cu kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The surface morphology and compositional study were carried out by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (FESEM-S-4700, Hitachi), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (TECNAI F20 Philips microscope operated at 200 kV), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) coupled with FESEM and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (K-Alpha, Thermo VG Scientific, UK) having a multi-channel detector. The DC electrical conductivity and thermal electromotive force (thermo emf) as a function of temperature were measured using a two-probe method in the temperature range of 300–500 K. To ensure good ohmic contacts between sample and probe high purity silver emulsion (paste) fingers were applied to films and to measure working temperature a chromel–alumel thermocouple was used. Electrical conductivity was measured from the resistance measurement using a multimeter (RISH Multi 15s) over entire temperature range. The Seebeck coefficient was calculated from thermo emf of the film at a given temperature measured by applying a temperature gradient across the film as per our previous report.36 The room temperature thermal conductivity was measured by a ring probe method using commercial conductivity equipment (C-T meter, Teleph, France).
3. Results and discussion
The APT is a Ostwald's self organized growth process in which the formation of the complex is a key factor to obtain high quality thin films. The possible reaction mechanism for the deposition of Cu3SbSe4 thin films is as follows, at the beginning copper sulphate pentahydrate and antimony trichloride forms stable complexes with tartaric acid as [Cu(C4H4O6)] and [Sb(C4H4O6)]− respectively. The Na2SeSO3 added in the reaction bath plays a dual role, as it releases Se2− anions for the reaction and also releases a reducing agent Na2SO3. At alkaline pH both complexes undergo slow dissociation and releases Cu2+ and Sb3+ cations as given in reactions (1) and (2). Simultaneously Na2SeSO3 hydrolyses to release Se2− anions and Na2SO3 reducing agent as in reaction (3). The released Na2SO3 hydrolyses to give an electron, which is responsible for the conversion of Cu2+ to Cu+ ions as in reaction (4) which was confirmed by physical observation of change in colour of reacting solution from blue to colourless. [Cu(C4H4O6)] → Cu2+ + (C4H4O6)2−(1) [Sb(C4H4O6)2]− → Sb3+ + 2(C4H4O6)2−(2)Na2SeSO3 + H+ → HSe− + Na2SO3 HSe− + OH− → Se2− + H2O(3)Na2SO3 + 2OH− → Na2SO4 + H2O + 2e− Cu2+ + e− → Cu+(4)
The deposition of thin film on the substrate surface takes place by ion-by-ion condensation followed by the Ostwald's ripening process. Generally in Ostwald's ripening process ‘the growth of large particles takes place at the expense of smaller particles which have higher solubility’. The reaction bath remains colourless for first 30 min, and shows an induction period for the formation of nucleation centres. After the induction period and under alkaline medium when ionic product (Kp) of metal ions exceeds solubility product (Ksp) the nucleation process starts at substrate surface and reaction mixture turns turbid as in reaction (5). Cu+ + Sb3+ + 2Se2− → CuSbSe2(5)
These nucleation centres form a monolayer onto a substrate surface which acts as a catalyst for fast deposition and film grows thicker following the Ostwald's ripening law. The as deposited films are composed of CuSbSe2 together with presence of mixed phases of Sb2Se3, Cu3Se2 and CuSe, which was confirmed by XRD. The presence of Cu2+ in reaction bath may be due to the insufficient amount of reducing agent (Na2SO3). Deposited films were converted to pure stoichiometric Cu3SbSe4 films after annealing at 473 K for 1 h as in reaction (6). (6)

Fig. 2 shows the plot of (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν) of Cu3SbSe4 thin film and inset shows a plot of absorbance vs. wavelength. The nature of optical transition and the band gap of semiconducting Cu3SbSe4 thin film was confirmed using eqn (7). αhν = A(hν − Eg)n(7)where, ‘α’ is the absorption coefficient, ‘h’ is the Plank's constant, ‘ν’ is the frequency, ‘A’ is the parameter that depends on transition, ‘Eg’ is the optical energy gap and exponent ‘n’ depends on the type of transition. The nature of plot suggests the direct allowed type of transition. The value of Eg was obtained by extrapolating a linear portion of plot and taking intercept on the X-axis of (αhν)2vs. (hν) graph. The observed optical band gap energy for the Cu3SbSe4 thin film is 1.96 eV, which corresponds well with our previously reported value.31

Fig. 3 shows indexed XRD patterns of as deposited and annealed thin film with a standard diffraction pattern in the range of 20° to 80°. The strong and sharp diffraction peaks imply good crystallinity of films. The as deposited film shows the presence of ternary orthorhombic CuSbSe2 (JCPDS card no. 75-0992) phase with some mixed phases of binary Sb2Se3, Cu3Se2 and CuSe. All the peaks of Cu3SbSe4 diffraction patterns are isostructural with a standard JCPDS card (PDF No. 85-0003).
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of as deposited and annealed thin films prepared by APT, indexed with standard JCPDS card. 
The observed peaks of the annealed film can be indexed to pure tetragonal Cu3SbSe4 and no other contamination phase was found which confirms the formation of prominent phase. The calculated lattice parameter values, a = 5.67 Å and c = 11.29 Å, are found to be in good agreement with the JCPDS data values. The XRD pattern of the annealed Cu3SbSe4 thin film shows prominent peaks at diffraction angles 27.25, 45.18, 45.39, 53.62 and 53.76 degree and can be indexed as (112), (220), (204), (312) and (116) (hkl) planes respectively. The intense peak at 27.25° clearly confirms the preferred orientation along (112) plane of tetragonal Cu3SbSe4. The crystallite size along (112) plane was calculated using the Scherrer's formula (8) (8)where, ‘D’ is the diameter of crystallite, ‘K’ is the dimensionless constant (0.94), ‘λ’ is the wavelength of X-rays (1.5406 Å), ‘β’ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and ‘θ’ is the diffraction angle.37 The crystallite size of Cu3SbSe4 for the prominent diffraction peak (112) was found to be 32.6 nm.
The size and shape of the material is an important parameter of nanostructure which can affect the optoelectronic performance of that material. To understand the morphology and nanostructure of deposited thin films FESEM analysis was performed. Fig. 4(a and b) shows FESEM images of the as deposited thin film having granular morphology with an average grain size of 35 nm. Fig. 4(c and d) shows FESEM images of the annealed Cu3SbSe4 thin film having diffused grains and an average diameter of 40 nm. From FESEM images it is clear that after annealing the grain size is increased and morphology becomes diffused granular with quite uniform distribution and grains get densely packed. As observed in FESEM images, the grains were aggregated, which may be due to the absence of a capping agent. FESEM images of Cu3SbSe4 reveals that the diffused grains show very small interparticle distances which minimize the barrier between adjacent grains and it would make easier charge transfer mechanism across the crystal lattice.

To study the additional information on morphology and structural properties of thin films, samples were further characterized by a HRTEM technique. Fig. 5 shows HRTEM and SAED patterns of as deposited (a–d) and annealed Cu3SbSe4 (e–h) thin films. The HRTEM images are in well agreement with FESEM results and show a grain size of ∼35 nm for as deposited and ∼40 nm for annealed thin films. Results show spherically diffused granular morphology of the material. The lattice fringes observed in both HRTEM (Fig. 5(c and g)) point out that both films were crystalline in nature. The inter-planar spacing of the as deposited film was observed to be 0.312 nm for (013) plane of CuSbSe2 and that of the annealed Cu3SbSe4 film was observed to be 0.326 nm for (112) lattice plane having tetragonal crystal structure. The HRTEM results are consistent with the XRD pattern and they confirm good crystallinity and phase of both films. HRTEM images correspondingly confirm that after annealing crystallinity of film increases.

The elemental composition of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film was determined using EDS spectra. The three prominent peaks at 0.93 eV, 3.60 eV and 1.37 eV confirm the presence of Cu, Sb and Se elements respectively. Furthermore, element valance states and the existing form of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film was investigated by XPS study as shown in Fig. 6. The survey spectrum (Fig. 6(a)) of Cu3SbSe4 indicates the presence of Cu, Sb and Se peaks along with C in the sample. The core level spectrum of copper (Fig. 6(b)) shows prominent peaks of Cu2p which can be clearly distinguished, in which two peaks located at binding energies of 934.1 eV and 954.2 eV are assigned to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, confirming the presence of Cu2+ in the sample with a splitting energy of 20.1 eV. However, two satellite shake up peaks were also observed at binding energies around 942.3 eV and 962.2 eV, further implying the presence of Cu2+ (ref. 38). Moreover, two peaks with binding energies of 932.1 eV and 951.9 eV were assigned to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, confirming the presence of Cu+ (ref. 39) with a splitting energy of 19.8 eV. Previously some reports have already presented the same behaviour of copper.40,41 The core level spectrum of antimony (Fig. 6(c)) showing two strong peaks at binding energies 530.7 eV and 540.1 eV are assigned to Sb3d5/2 and Sb3d3/2 respectively, which is consistent with the Sb3+ in sample42 with a splitting energy of 9.4 eV. Furthermore the presence of Se2− is confirmed by presence of peak at 54.1 eV assigned to Se3d transition (Fig. 6(d)).43

Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependent thermoelectric transport properties like electrical conductivity (σ), Seebeck coefficient (S) and thermal conductivity (κ) of Cu3SbSe4 thin film in a temperature range of 300 K to 500 K. The electrical conductivity of the thin film was measured to be 723.84 S cm−1 at 300 K. The σ of the film decreases with temperature which shows the metallic nature of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film. Room temperature moderate conductivity can be pointed out due to the complete removal of the complexing agent and presence of diffused grains which facilitates a smooth charge transfer.

The temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of Cu3SbSe4 thin film was measured and shown in Fig. 7(b). The Seebeck coefficient of the thin film was calculated by using eqn (9). (9)where, ‘ΔV’ is the measured thermal voltage and ‘ΔT’ is the temperature difference across the film. Temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient shows approximately linear behaviour throughout the temperature range. The Seebeck coefficient of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film was found to be 66.66 μV K−1 at 300 K. The Cu3SbSe4 thin film possesses a positive Seebeck coefficient, which reveals that the major charge carriers in the film are holes and this is consistent with the expected p-type semiconducting nature.
The power factor is also one of the important parameter, because it evaluates the performance of the thermoelectric materials. It can be easily obtained from the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient using eqn (10). PF = S2σ(10)
The temperature dependence of power factor was shown in Fig. 7(c), it also shows the linear relationship with temperature. The power factor of Cu3SbSe4 thin film was calculated to be 3.21 μW cm−1 K−2 at 300 K and for instance the highest power factor was observed to be 19.18 μW cm−1 K−2 at 500 K. This value is comparable with the reported value in Cu3SbSe4 (between the range 2 μW cm−1 K−2 to 5 μW cm−1 K−2),12 in Ge doped Cu3SbSe4 (around 16 μW cm−1 K−2 at 600 K)21 and in Cu3Sb0.94Sn0.06Se3.5S0.5 (17 μW cm−1 K−2 at 620 K).24 It demonstrates that the deposited thin films exhibit good thermoelectric properties.
The thermal conductivity (κ) is an important parameter of thermoelectric materials. The thermal conductivity is due to the heat transport from one side to other by phonons and carriers. The carrier concentration of semiconductors is generally small as compared to metal. Therefore in semiconductors, phononic contribution is larger than electronic contribution. The phonon thermal conductivity is affected by grain size of the material and presence of grain boundary in the material leads to reduction in thermal conductivity. In our case it is ∼40 nm and which may be responsible for a lower value of ‘κ’. The ‘κ’ of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film is observed to be 0.478 W mK−1 at 300 K.
The thermoelectric performance of the thin film was quantified by using eqn (11). (11)
An ideal thermoelectric material should have high electrical conductivity, higher power factor and lower thermal conductivity. The dimensionless ZT of the Cu3SbSe4 thin film is calculated to be 0.20 at 300 K. The room temperature ZT and other parameters (σ, S, power factor and κ) of Cu3SbSe4 thin films are given in Table 1. These values are comparable with our previously reported values in microwave assisted Cu3SbSe4 (0.14 at 300 K)31 and CuSb0.98Ti0.02Se2 (0.0041 at 300 K),18 but lower than that reported in Cu3Sb0.98Bi0.02Se4 (0.7 at 600 K),12 in Cu3Sb0.975Sn0.025Se4 (0.75 at 673 K),20 in Cu3Sb0.94Sn0.06Se3.5S0.5 (1.1 at 700 K),24 in Cu3Sb0.98Sn0.02Se4 (1.05 at 700 K),25 in Cu3SbSe4 (0.30 at 550 K),28 in Cu2.925SbSe4 (0.50 at 673 K),29 in Cu2.95Sb0.98Sn0.02Se4 (∼0.7 at 673 K)30 and in Cu3Sb0.97Al0.03Se4 (0.58 at 600 K).44 These reported values might be improved at higher temperatures or may be by controlled addition of different dopants. The structural, morphological, compositional and thermoelectric results show that the deposited thin films are good candidates for thermoelectric applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized tetragonal p-type Cu3SbSe4 thin films for the first time using a simple arrested precipitation technique. The present technique is based on a tartaric acid mediated complexing agent, which is of low cost, non-toxic, stable and environmentally friendly. The deposited Cu3SbSe4 thin films showed good crystallinity and morphology with remarkable thermoelectric properties and figure of merit. The calculated figure of merit was found to be 0.20 at 300 K. It was demonstrated that the deposited thin films exhibit good electronic properties and also hold potential for optoelectronic device fabrication.
