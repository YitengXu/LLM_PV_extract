    , Accepted 2nd February 2021First published on 23rd February 2021AbstractCarbon-based materials stand out from all possible non-precious metal-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, owing to their low cost, high conductivity, and variety of allotropes with different bonding and structures. There have been many reviews on the ORR performance of carbon-based materials in aqueous electrolyte, but until now, there has been no specific review on the ORR activity of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte. In this review, a comprehensive insight into carbon-based catalysts for the ORR in non-aqueous electrolyte in terms of the ORR mechanism and strategies for performance modulation (including morphology/nanostructure engineering, strategies for doping with foreign atoms, defect engineering, and functionalization engineering) is provided. Also, the challenges for carbon electrocatalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte and the corresponding solutions are also discussed.
1. Introduction
With the gradual exhaustion of petroleum energy and aggravation of global warming, the exploitation of “green energy” (solar, wind and tide) has been considered as a promising solution to significantly resolve these issues. These renewable energy sources, however, are intrinsically fluctuating and intermittent owing to the variety of weather conditions. Thus, large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) are required to assist in the utilization of renewable energy. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which offer long cycle life (>5000 cycles),1–8 are not suitable for application in large-scale ESSs due to the ever-increasing price of lithium. Recently, various alternatives to LIBs have been developed for ESSs, such as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),9–17 potassium-ion batteries (KIBs),18–20 zinc-ion batteries,21–24etc. Although more research achievements have been made for SIBs and KIBs, the insufficient energy density (<400 W h kg−1) of these batteries, which are based on the conventional intercalation reaction mechanism, makes it hard to meet the high energy demand of large-scale electricity storage for renewable energy. Eventually, metal–air batteries, which are based on oxygen electrochemistry, began to emerge as an alternative battery technology, owing to their extremely high energy density (1084 W h kg−1 for Zn–air batteries,25–27 1683 W h kg−1 for Na–air batteries,28–30 and 11680 W h kg−1 for Li–air batteries31–33), at least two times higher than for conventional alkaline ion batteries.
A typical metal–air battery consists of a metal anode, a porous air electrode and a separator soaked in metal ion-conducting electrolyte, as schematically shown in Fig. 1a. In metal–air batteries, electricity is generated through a redox reaction between the metal and the oxygen in the air. In the discharge process, electrons are released to the external circuit and the metal anode is oxidized. At the same time, the electrons are accepted by oxygen at the cathode, forming oxygen-reduced species, and vice versa. According to the electrolyte, metal–air batteries are classified into two types: one is aqueous metal–air batteries, including mostly polyvalent metal (Zn, Mg, Al)–air batteries; the other is non-aqueous alkali metal–air batteries including Li–air batteries, Na–air batteries, and K–air batteries. In metal–air batteries, two reactions, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are involved and respectively determine the discharge and charge performance of the batteries. The sluggish kinetics of the ORR and the OER induce overpotentials during the discharge and charge processes, respectively, resulting in high energy storage inefficiency. This issue is especially severe in non-aqueous metal–air batteries. Therefore, simultaneously mitigating the ORR and OER overpotentials is crucial for developing rechargeable metal–air batteries. And in some cases, the OER process (or charge performance) is also greatly determined by the composition of the discharge (ORR) product.34–37 One typical example is the Na–O2 battery, in which if the discharge (or ORR) product is NaO2, the OER process only needs a small overpotential and is insensitive to the performance of OER catalysts; however, if the ORR product is Na2O2, the situation is very complex and sensitive to the activity of OER catalysts.38 Therefore, active ORR catalysts are highly desirable to improve both the discharge and charge performance of non-aqueous metal–air batteries.

As for most state-of-the-art aqueous-electrolyte-based fuel cells, a power density of 1.0 W cm−2 (corresponding to ∼1.5 A cm−2 at a 0.7 V cell voltage) can easily be achieved with a catalyst loading of 0.2–0.4 mgPt cm−2.39 For non-aqueous electrolyte-based Li–air batteries, however, even in a pure oxygen atmosphere, to achieve a power density of 25 mW cm−2, the amount of catalyst per watt (g W−1) should be 3–5 orders of magnitude higher than that for aqueous fuel cells, based on the performance of current ORR catalysts.40 Hence, for practical application of non-aqueous electrolyte-based Li–air cells, high performance electrocatalysts without precious metals are urgently needed. Among all the possible non-precious metal-based ORR catalysts, carbon-based materials stand out because of their low cost, high conductivity, variety of allotropes with different bonding and structures, mature knowledge database and strategies to control the morphology and porosity.
There have been many reviews on the ORR performance of carbon-based materials in aqueous electrolyte,41–46 but until now, there has been no specific review on the ORR activity of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte. In this review, we discuss carbon-based catalysts for the ORR in non-aqueous electrolyte in the following topics: (1) the ORR mechanism of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte; (2) strategies for modulating the ORR activity of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte, including morphology/nanostructure engineering, strategies for doping with foreign atoms, defect engineering, and functionalization engineering; and (3) challenges for carbon electrocatalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte, including carbon decomposition and ORR activity evaluation. Finally, we provide our perspective on carbon catalysts for the ORR in non-aqueous metal–air batteries.
2. Oxygen reduction reaction in non-aqueous electrolytes
To achieve the rational design of desirable catalysts for the ORR, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of the ORR in non-aqueous electrolyte. According to the oxygen dissociation barrier on the surface of carbon-based catalysts (or the intrinsic activity of the catalysts), the ORR procedure in non-aqueous-based electrolyte could be mainly divided into single- and two-electron processes. Generally, according to the Hard–Soft Acid–Base Theory (HSAB), soft acid cations can effectively stabilize the soft base O2−, leading to an easier one-electron ORR process. In non-aqueous electrolytes with large cations (or soft Lewis-acid cations), such as tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) and tetraethylammonium (TEA+), the ORR process is a one-electron transfer reaction. That is, the oxygen molecule (O2) is reduced to a superoxide radical (O2−), followed by its subsequent solvation by TBA+ or TEA+.47,48 Therefore, in this situation, the ORR process is a catalyst insensitive reaction, which means that the performance of catalysts does not affect the kinetics of the ORR. For one thing, as for the single-electron process, no cleavage of the O–O bond is involved, indicating a low energy barrier. For another, the O2− ion is a weakly adsorbed radical and highly soluble in electrolyte, which will prevent clogging of the electrode and active sites.40
However, alkali metal cations such as Li+, which are hard acids, cannot effectively stabilize the O2− ions. The LiO2 will transform into Li2O2via a subsequent disproportionation process, leading to a 2-electron process. The strong ionic bond between Li+ and the superoxide ion also results in their precipitation on the electrode surface, which passivates the electrode and shuts down the reduction, making the reaction irreversible. Hence, oxygen electrochemistry in nonaqueous electrolytes with small alkaline cations (or hard Lewis-acid cations) such as Li+ and Na+ presents a high ORR (discharge) overpotential and low reversibility or low discharge/charge voltage efficiency. Moreover, unlike the dominant lithium ion batteries, non-aqueous electrolyte-based Li/Na–O2 cells employ a dissolution/precipitation reaction during the electrochemical process rather than the intercalation mechanism. The dissolution/precipitation reaction involves an evolution in the structure of the electrode material.
In more detail, Li2O2 is the thermodynamically stable discharge product of the Li–O2 battery. The discharge reactions on the cathode are expressed by eqn (1)–(3),49–52 in which LiO2(ads) and LiO2(sol) represent the surface-adsorbed and soluble LiO2, respectively. O2 + Li+ + e− → LiO2, (E = 3.0 V vs. Li/Li+)(1) LiO2(sol) → Li2O2 + O2(2) LiO2(ads) + Li+ + e− → Li2O2 (E = 2.96 V vs. Li/Li+)(3)
The total discharge (ORR) reaction takes place in the following sequence: O2 molecules are initially adsorbed onto the positively charged active sites on the surface of the air cathode, such as on the positively charged carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen atoms. Then, the O2 is reduced by the electrons to form superoxide ions (O2−). As for the carbon materials, the electron for the reaction originates from the π electrons activated via various strategies, such as conjugating with the lone-pair from the doped nitrogen atom or defects. Then the superoxide ions will combine with Li+ ions to form LiO2, either in solid form deposited on the surface or in soluble form in the electrolyte. Then, despite the instability of LiO2, it undergoes either a disproportionation reaction (eqn (2)) or combines with another electron and a Li+ ion to form the stable discharge product Li2O2. The insulating Li2O2 will aggregate and block the ORR active sites and pores of the O2 cathode because of limited solubility in non-aqueous electrolyte, finally blocking the electron-transfer pathways and transport of O2 and Li+, and diminishing the discharge performance of the Li–O2 cell (such as the specific discharge capacity and discharge overpotential).
The discharge (ORR) process of the Na–O2 battery is very similar to that of the Li–O2 cell. The difference lies in the final discharge product, which is either NaO2 or Na2O2, i.e. either a single- or two-electron pathway, depending on the performance of ORR catalysts, oxygen partial pressure, the presence of ORR catalysts, and the properties of the organic electrolyte. Generally, the excellent ORR catalysts loaded on the air cathode in metal–air batteries could effectively control the composition of the discharge product, decrease the discharge overpotential, and improve the battery kinetics, specific capacity and cycling performance. An investigation on ORR catalysts towards metal–air batteries, especially non-aqueous electrolyte-based cells, is of great importance to promote the performance and wide application of metal–air batteries. For example, current Li–air batteries can only be discharged–charged at a current density of 0.1–0.5 mA cm−2 (in comparison to >10 mA cm−2 for a Li-ion battery), and the voltage gap between charge and discharge is above 1.0 V with a low voltage efficiency below 70%, while it is above 90% for a Li-ion cell.40 These results can be largely attributed to the poor performance of the air (oxygen) electrode because of the sluggish kinetics for the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Therefore, developing effective catalysts towards the ORR is of great importance for boosting the discharge performance of non-aqueous metal–air batteries.
3. Strategies for modulating the performance of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte
Similar to other electrocatalysts, the ORR activity of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte can be boosted in various ways including increasing the number of active sites and increasing the activity of each site, as well as increasing the conductivity. In more detail, four main strategies are summarized: (i) morphology/nanostructure engineering, (ii) strategies for doping with foreign atoms, (iii) defect engineering and (iv) functionalization engineering. The corresponding details of each strategy will be discussed below.
3.1 Morphology/nanostructure engineering
The overall energy density of metal–air batteries is determined by the amount of insoluble discharge products stored on the surface of the oxygen electrode.55,56 The discharge product morphology is crucial for the reversibility and cycling performance of non-aqueous metal–air batteries, owing to its influence on the decomposition of the discharge product.57,58 It has been found that the cell performance of lithium–oxygen largely depends on the structure, surface area, and pore size distribution of the meso- and macro-pores of carbon materials used for electrode fabrication.60 X. B. Zhang et al. revealed that the nanoscale pores can provide tri-phase (solid–liquid–gas) regions for oxygen reduction, while the large tunnels (macropores) could serve as transport paths that continuously supply oxygen to the interior of the electrode during the discharge process.61 It is crucial to design a hierarchical porous structure for a catalyst containing both substantial nanoporosity for collection of the solid-state discharge product (Li2O2), and open porosity for facilitating electrolyte immersion and Li+ diffusion. Therefore, to modulate the carbon catalysts in nonaqueous electrolyte, the principles of morphology/nanostructure engineering are grouped into three categories: (1) increasing the active sites by introducing more edges and nanopores, which can provide more accommodation sites for insoluble discharge products (e.g. Li2O2, Na2O2, etc.); (2) introducing more diffusion paths by increasing the amount of large tunnels or macropores in the carbon catalysts, which can facilitate electrolyte and mass diffusion; and (3) modulating the discharge product identities (product components, morphology) by altering the carbon electrode morphology, which can improve the cycling reversibility. The details of morphology/nanostructure engineering are discussed in terms of the four following categories, according to the carbon morphology and composition: one-dimensional (1D) carbon, 2D carbon, 3D carbon, and dual-phase carbon (Fig. 2). The representative examples of morphology/nanostructure modulation of carbon-based catalysts are listed in Table 1.

The design of a carbon-fibre electrode with low carbon packing has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to efficiently utilize the available carbon mass and void volume for Li2O2 formation, resulting in high gravimetric energy density. Y. Shao-Horn et al. utilized porous anodized aluminium oxide (AAO) substrates coated with thin layers of Ta and Fe as substrates (Fig. 3a), accompanied by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), to synthesize a well-designed carbon-fibre electrode (Fig. 3b). This carbon-fibre electrode delivered high discharge capacity (∼5000 mA h g−1).53 In Na–O2 batteries, Guo and co-workers demonstrated that vertically aligned carbon nanotube electrodes could greatly improve the capacity and cyclability.62 Although the carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers presented good performance, the limited surface area of the 1D morphology restricted the active sites. 2D carbon materials possess abundant active sites, thus exhibiting much enhanced electrochemical and catalytic properties compared to 1D carbon materials. Graphene nanosheets were initially introduced as cathode active materials in non-aqueous lithium–oxygen batteries and delivered a high capacity of 8705.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 75 mA g−1.54 Also, in sodium–air batteries, exfoliated graphene sheets, which have more edges than graphite, presented higher electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).65 The unique structure of thin and wrinkled graphene morphology in this report is especially beneficial, because it not only increases the electrochemically accessible sites, but also provides large diffusion paths for the O2 mass diffusion.54,65

Although the ORR performance is improved in the 1D and 2D carbon electrodes to some extent, the reversible capacity is relatively limited, due to the structural anisotropy of the 1D or 2D electrodes. As a result, both the electron transport and mass transport of reactants in 1D or 2D electrodes are restricted by the structural characteristics of the 1D and 2D electrodes.54,66–68 To resolve this issue, the nanostructure design of three-dimensional (3D) carbon electrodes has been developed. It has been confirmed that 3D architectures are effective for facilitating the mass transport of reactants through the electrode, improving both the power density and the energy density of metal–air batteries simultaneously.69,70 Therefore, various 3D hierarchical carbon electrodes have been prepared to further improve the electrochemical performance of metal–air batteries, such as a mesoporous carbon nanocube architecture,59 3D porous honeycomb-like carbon,60 3D hierarchical porous carbon spheres,55,56etc. These hierarchical carbon electrodes contain numerous mesopores and macropores, facilitating oxygen diffusion and electrolyte impregnation throughout the electrode, as well as providing enough spaces to accommodate insoluble discharge products. Fig. 4 shows representative 3D hierarchical carbon catalysts in Li–O2 batteries. B. Sun synthesized mesoporous carbon nanocubes (MCN) through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using MnO2 as a template, which contained a large amount of hierarchical mesopores and macropores (Fig. 4a and b). They delivered a higher discharge capacity of 26100 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 current density and better rate capability (Fig. 4c) in comparison with a carbon black (CB) catalyst.59 Honeycomb-like carbon containing large tunnels and nanosized porosity was synthesized using silica as a template, featuring numerous nanoscale pores and large tunnels (Fig. 4e and f). In comparison with Super P, the discharge capacity was increased to 3250 mA h g−1, and the voltage polarization was decreased by 0.25 V, as shown in Fig. 4g.60 The three-dimensional ordered mesoporous/microporous carbon sphere arrays could effectively enhance the electrochemical performance of Li–O2 batteries.71 This is because the ordered mesoporous channels and hierarchical mesoporous/microporous structure of this carbon material facilitated electrolyte immersion and Li+ diffusion, and provided effective space for O2 diffusion and O2/Li2O2 conversion. K. Lim et al. synthesized graphene hollow spheres (CBH) as an air cathode in Li–O2 batteries by utilizing Fe3O4 spheres as the template and vacuum residue as the carbon precursor.55 CBH shows a hollow sphere morphology featuring multilayered graphene (Fig. 4h). The CBH electrode was tested in Li–O2 batteries in comparison with commercial carbon material KB600J (Ketjenblack EC-600JD). These hollow carbon spheres showed a higher capacity of 16805 mA h g−1 than that of commercial KB600J (5493 mA h g−1). Also, they showed better rate capacity than that of commercial KB600J, as shown in Fig. 4i and j.

The nanostructure-engineering reports mentioned above are based on modulating the nanostructure of a single carbon source. Dual-phase carbon nanoarchitectures can incorporate the advantages of both components, consequently boosting the electrochemical performance of non-aqueous electrolyte-based metal–air batteries.63,64 H. T. T. Pham et al. designed a dual-phase carbon nanoarchitecture composed of a porous metal–organic framework (MOF) derived carbon (MOF-C) and conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as illustrated in Fig. 5a. The uniformly dispersed MOF-C nanoparticles, with sizes of 300–500 nm, were interwoven with and connected by the CNTs, as shown in Fig. 5b.63 In this dual-phase nanoarchitecture, MOF-C provides a large surface area for the oxygen reactions and a large pore volume for Li2O2 storage, while the CNTs provide facile pathways for electron and O2 transport as well as additional void spaces for Li2O2 accommodation. Various MOF-C/CNT samples were synthesized with different CNT contents. For simplicity and conciseness, the samples with 29.4, 58.8, and 88.2 mg of CNTs were referred to as MOF-C/CNT-1, MOF-C/CNT-2, and MOF-C/CNT-3, respectively, with MOF-C/CNT-2 delivering the highest specific discharge capacity of 10050 mA h g−1 (Fig. 5c).

Besides the electrochemical performance, in non-aqueous metal–O2 batteries, it is recognized that the discharge product identities (including the components and the morphology) significantly depend on the types and properties of the carbon material used for the oxygen electrodes.56,62,72–77 The discharge product morphology is crucial for the reversibility and cycling performance of non-aqueous metal–air batteries, owing to its influences on the decomposition of the discharge product. It was reported that densely deposited Li2O2 toroids with high crystallinity are hard to decompose during the charging process, resulting in inferior cycling performance.57,58 The hollow-sphere carbon could regulate the morphology of the discharge product, which appeared as smaller and far less developed toroids. This kind of discharge product almost disappeared during the subsequent charging process, making the hollow sphere carbon electrode present better cycling stability than that of the commercial carbon material (KB600J).55 A free-standing honeycomb-like palladium-modified hollow spherical carbon deposited onto carbon paper was synthesised and employed as a cathode for a lithium–oxygen battery by X. B. Zhang et al.85 The battery shows both high capacity (5900 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1.5 A g−1) and long-term stability (100 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g−1 and a specific capacity limit of 1000 mA h g−1). This was explained by the tailored deposition and morphology of the discharge products as well as the alleviated electrolyte decomposition compared with conventional carbon cathodes. Also, a similar phenomenon is observed in Na–O2 batteries. G. Wang et al. reported that their nanostructured carbon materials could control the morphology of the discharge product – NaO2, aiding in the development of high-performance NaO2 batteries (Fig. 6a and b).56 The unusual conformal film-like morphology of the NaO2 discharge product was deposited on the surface of the hierarchical porous carbon sphere (HPC) electrode (Fig. 6c and d), while the commonly observed NaO2 on the carbon black (CB) electrode is in the form of microsized NaO2 cubes, as shown in Fig. 6e and f. Besides the inherent morphology of the discharge product, the structure of the carbon electrode can also influence the components of the discharge product. Yadegari et al. employed corrosive gas-treated mesoporous carbon as the oxygen cathode in Na–O2 batteries and found that both NaO2 and Na2O2 were produced at the end of discharge.74

However, to modify the ORR activity of carbon-based materials via morphology control, the following problems should be considered: (i) some morphology control strategies, such as the formation of discrete carbon nanostructures, usually lead to poor electrical conductivity and therefore deteriorated ORR activity. (ii) Some morphologies of carbon materials, such as hollow structures and porous structures, show a significant impact on the pressure of oxygen gas, which also affects the mechanism of the ORR. This makes the investigations on the intrinsic ORR activity difficult. (iii) Due to the shortcomings of nanoengineering, the more accurate the morphology control, the more difficult it is to increase the yield and productivity.

In addition to the various strategies for porous and nanostructure engineering, modulation of the surface chemistry of carbon materials through introducing foreign atoms into carbon lattices has been extensively verified as an effective approach to enhance the ORR activity of carbon in non-aqueous electrolyte.43,46 Heteroatoms doped into carbon lattices could modify the electronic and geometric structures of pristine carbon significantly, leading to atomic defects, as well as non-uniform distributions of the spin and atomic charge density, which are able to tune the oxygen adsorption properties and catalytic activity.86 Hence most of these atomic defects can become active sites to adsorb O2 and metal ions, increasing the density of reaction sites and thus enhancing the discharge voltage as well as the capacity of non-aqueous electrolyte-based metal–air batteries.87 Although foreign atom doping can promote the ORR activity of the carbon material, the stability of the doped carbon cathode is further deteriorated compared with that of pure carbon when it comes into contact with highly oxidative environments, which is due to the highly aggressive reaction intermediates during the discharge process, such as superoxide and/or other oxygen-containing free radicals.88,89 This is related to the broken C–C bonds and generated defects, which will accelerate the carbon electrode corrosion, passivation and performance fading.90–93 Therefore, as shown in Fig. 7, the foreign atom doping seems to be a double bladed sword: it contributes to activity but likely leads to poor durability. According to the kind of foreign dopant, we classified the strategy as single-element doping and co-doping strategies. Representative examples of the foreign atom doping strategy are summarized in Table 2.

3.2.1 Single-non-metal element doping. 
Compared with metal elements, non-metal elements including B, N, P, O, S, Se, F, Cl, Br, and I are more easily doped into the sp2 hybrid C–C lattice to form single-element doped metal-free catalysts with activity towards the ORR.43–45 To date, there have been no reports on the ORR activity of single-metal-element doped carbon used in non-aqueous electrolyte. In the case of the non-metal single-element doping, Hu et al. proposed that the ORR activity of carbon originates from the carbon π electrons, which are activated by perturbing the integrity of π conjugation after doping, which could be quantitatively correlated with the electronegativity (or electron affinity).94 The difference in this electronegativity between the carbon and dopants strongly influences the ORR process (Fig. 8a). Fig. 8b illustrates the possible positions of dopants. Based on this information, a descriptor (Φ) was proposed by Xia et al.41 to study the effect of electron affinity on the ORR catalytic activity, as shown in eqn (4): (4)where Ex/Ec is the electronegativity, while Ax/Ac is the electron affinity of the dopant (X) and the carbon (C). The obtained volcano relationship between Φ and the intrinsic ORR activity in aqueous electrolyte was established (Fig. 8c) and experimentally verified. Those dopants with Φ < 1 (such as B and P) themselves can act as ORR active sites as the electron cloud is attracted by adjacent carbon atoms, leaving positively charged dopants, while the dopants with Φ > 1 (N, S, Se, Ci, Br, and I) could attract the electrons from carbon atoms, yielding negatively charged dopants and enhancing the ORR activity of neighbouring carbon atoms. It is obvious that nitrogen is the best dopant for ORR activity among the various non-metal elements (Fig. 8c). The unusual onset potential of fluorine may be attributed to unexplored ORR mechanisms because of its extremely high electronegativity.

Due to the modified charge distribution in doped carbon that originates from the electronegativity difference, the wettability of carbon-based materials is also adjusted, which is important for the typical three-phase reaction, including the ORR process on the air-cathode of metal–air batteries.43 Good contact between catalysts and the non-aqueous electrolyte offers a higher charge transfer rate and better ORR activity. Moreover, as displayed in Fig. 8a, the atomic sizes of non-metal dopants are different from those of carbon. Therefore, introducing these foreign atoms leads to deformation of the carbon lattice, causing strains and geometric defects, which are also possible active sites towards the ORR. Another noticeable thing is the difference in valence electron numbers between C and the various dopants, which would tune charge carrier concentrations and carbon frameworks. For example, nitrogen group elements, such as N, P, etc., have one valence electron more than C, which is favourable for reactions needing electrons, such as the one-electron ORR process. Also, thanks to their compatible atomic size with C (74 pm vs. 77 pm), N atoms are easily doped into the carbon lattice and form pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic N structures, as shown in Fig. 8d. According to the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the ORR catalytic activity of different N species is in the order of pyridinic-N > pyrrolic-N > graphitic-N > oxidized-N > C (carbon) because of the difference in unpaired and lone-pair electrons. While the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N catalytic sites are favourable for the four-electron process of the ORR, graphitic-N and oxidized-N are more suitable for the two-electron process of the ORR.95 Hence, the different valence electron numbers generate different carbon structures, finely tuning the ORR activity of doped carbon.
Boron doped graphene was used as a cathode for Li–O2 batteries by Lu et al.96 Compared with pure graphene, graphene doped with a tiny amount of boron exhibited a large discharge capacity and a higher discharge voltage plateau. The better ORR activity of B doped graphene stems from the electron accumulation in the vacant 2pz orbital of the B atom from the π electrons of the conjugated system. The transferred charge weakens the O–O bonds when O2 is adsorbed with boron as a bridge, which decreases the overpotential for the ORR. Shu et al.97 reported a Na–O2 battery employing B-doped onion like carbon microspheres as an air cathode. The results demonstrated that after B doping, the adsorption of O2 on the carbon surface is enhanced, leading to improved kinetics of the oxygen electrode reaction. Compared with the undoped sample, the B doped sample yielded higher specific capacity (10200 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.15 mA g−1) and improved rate capability (capacity retention of 73% when the discharge current density increased from 0.15 to 0.60 mA cm−2), indicating the improved ORR activity of the B doped carbon.
Sakaushi et al.98 assembled a lithium–air battery employing N doped carbon as an air cathode (with 0.5 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LITFSI) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) as the electrolyte, with a potential window of 2.0–4.0 V versus Li/Li+ at a 100 mA g−1 current density), and the nitrogen doped carbon was found to present a lower discharge overpotential of 0.3 V as compared with Pt–carbon catalysts (0.45 V). The specific discharge capacities also reached 1750 mA h g−1 (at 100 mA g−1), higher than for the pure carbon (1065 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1) indicating high ORR activity of the N doped carbon. Zhou et al. reported that the pyridinic nitrogen in N-doped carbon materials has strong adherence to Li+ and O2, improving the catalytic performance.84 First-principles computations revealed that the pyridinic N can attract Li+ and give an electron to form LiPyriCs (a Li+-adsorbing carbon sheet with pyridinic nitrogen doping). This pyridinic N site is a strong O2 adsorption and activation site, and thus could catalyse electrochemical reactions. Phosphorus doped porous carbon was developed by Sun et al. via pyrolyzing pinecones.99 The Li–O2 battery employing this P doped carbon as an air cathode delivered a large discharge specific capacity of 24500 mA h g−1 and a durability of 205 cycles when operated at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, better than the results of pure carbon in both aspects. It was found that Li2O2 did not block the P doped carbon after discharging because of its fast charge transfer as well as its high O2 and Li+ diffusion rate.
There is no experimental evidence on carbon lattice doping by oxygen atoms; instead, oxygen element shows a strong influence via surface functional groups, which will be discussed later. As chalcogen group elements, sulphur and selenium (Se) could also be applied as dopants to improve the ORR activity of carbon.100–102 As early as in 2012, Sun et al. fabricated sulphur-doped graphene and demonstrated its positive influence on Li2O2 formation for the first time.102 Compared with the undoped sample, the S-doped graphene promoted the formation of Li2O2 nanorods, while pure graphene promoted the formation of irregular Li2O2. It was proved that S-doping adjusted the electronic state of the original graphene, which diminished the binding energy between O2− ions and graphene. This did not promote the breaking of O–O bonds, but enhanced the diffusion of superoxide ions. Finally the growth of nanorod Li2O2 was promoted.102 In contrast, poor diffusion promoted the clogging of the electrode surface by irregular Li2O2 on pure graphene, which degraded the catalytic performance. Se is a typical element known as an anti-oxidative agent in the human body due to its ability to effectively scavenge free radicals.103 Hence, Yin et al. developed Se-doped carbon as a cathode for Li–O2 batteries.100 Their results showed that the Se-doped carbon cathode had 53% higher discharge capacity, decreased overpotential and superior rate capability compared to pure carbon. The high stability of this cathode was ascribed to the outstanding antioxidant ability of Se element.
To date, there have been no reports on halogen doped carbon used in non-aqueous electrolyte-based metal–air batteries. Experimental results in aqueous electrolyte, however, proved that halogen atom doping into carbon could lead to an enhancement of the ORR current density at high overpotentials through a four-electron pathway. Also, the ORR activity order did not follow the electronegativity order of the halogen atoms.104 This demonstrates that the ORR activity of halogen-atom doped carbon is not dominated by electronegativity solely or directly. In line with the results displayed in Fig. 8c, F doped carbon exhibited the greatest catalytic activity. This could be explained by the synergistic effects of the existence of ionic/semi-ionic bonds, structural defects, and oxygen surface functional groups. Meng et al. compared the ORR activity of I and N doped carbon in alkaline solution. The results demonstrated that iodine doped graphene possessed better ORR activity than pure graphene but it was weaker than for N doped graphene, while the I and N co-doped sample showed the best activity.105 It is safe for us to deduce that the halogen doped carbon may be effective in non-aqueous electrolyte-based metal–air batteries like under aqueous conditions.
Theoretical calculations provide another effective platform to study the kinetics of catalytic reactions. Different descriptors for intrinsic ORR catalytic activity have been developed to predict the catalytic mechanisms of carbon-based materials with different dopants via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, most of the previous studies on theoretical calculation of the electrocatalytic processes employ heteroatom-doped graphene as a model, and mostly focus on aqueous-based electrolyte.106–109 For example, as early as in 2009, for the first time, Dai and Xia et al. investigated the ORR activity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with or without N doping using a cluster approach with the hybrid DFT method.110 Their results suggested that the carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen dopants were highly positively charged while the doped N atoms were negatively charged; the O2 chemisorption mode could also be modified by nitrogen doping. It is common sense that the activity of carbon-based catalysts is affected by dopants via the triple effect: charge, spin density and ligand effect.
Until now, there have been hardly any reports on DFT calculations to predict the effect of different dopants on the ORR activity of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte systems. This is because the ORR products of non-aqueous-based metal–air batteries are usually O2− or O22− ions, which easily form insoluble solids that clog the ORR active sites. Further prediction of ORR activity in non-aqueous electrolyte by DFT calculations therefore is difficult. In 2014, the chemisorption of molecular O2 on N, B, and O doped and non-doped edge sites of carbon materials, which is the first reaction step of the ORR process both in aqueous and non-aqueous-based electrolytes, was systematically investigated using the DFT method.111,112 The simulation results proved that the O-doped carbon edges would attain an irreversible oxidation state and accelerate the chemical degradation of the microstructure of carbon materials. Therefore, the stronger affinity of boron atoms to oxygen than to carbon atoms leads to the formation of B–O–C motifs and deterioration of the stability of B-doped carbon materials. And the carbon edges doped with pyridinic nitrogen can serve as the sites for molecular oxygen chemisorption only in the presence of valence unsaturated carbon atoms. This means that the ORR activity could be enhanced by the presence of graphitic nitrogen. According to investigations by Z. Zhou et al.,113 the in-plane pyridinic N-doped graphene is more effective in facilitating the nucleation of Li2O2 clusters than pristine or graphitic N-doped graphene, therefore exhibiting a more optimal performance in the catalytic activity of the ORR process. Recently, the ORR/OER performance of pristine graphene, N- and B-doped graphene, and N,B co-doped graphene was predicted using DFT for potential catalysts for the ORR/OER in non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries.114 It was found that B-doped graphene presents the lowest discharge and charge overpotentials compared with N,B co-doped graphene, indicating that it is the best catalyst for both the ORR and OER processes in Li–air batteries. Just recently, Y. S. Mekonnen et al.115 conducted the first DFT calculations on sodium–air batteries and the result revealed that two-boron- and three-nitrogen (pyridinic)-doped graphene exhibited plausible discharge/charge reaction pathways at the lowest overpotentials, thus significantly improving the oxygen reduction reaction of pristine graphene for sodium–air battery systems operating with non-aqueous electrolyte.


3.2.2 Co-doping. 
Besides single element doping, co-doping with nitrogen and other elements has been developed into an attractive research direction to further improve the ORR activity of nitrogen-doped carbon-based materials in non-aqueous electrolyte. The co-doped carbon materials exhibited higher electrocatalytic activities than their corresponding single-atom-doped counterparts, due to a synergistic co-doping effect or atomic interaction between the two dopants. Generally, co-doping could further adjust the electronic structures and affinity towards the ORR intermediates of the carbon host while creating more defects. It was also found, however, that some combinations of co-dopants, such as B and N in co-doped CNTs,116 exhibited an antagonistic rather than a synergetic effect, because a large-scale neutralization of lone-pair electrons from N by vacant orbitals of B occurred, which resulted in difficulty in conjugating and activating the π electrons in carbon. Hence it seems that there is an optimal ratio between N and B dopants to achieve the highest ORR activity, while the ORR activity was not proportionate to the content of boron and nitrogen. Hence, for the co-doping strategy, the selection of co-dopants and ratio control are important to increase ORR activity.46 Another fundamental issue for co-doping relates to the distribution of the two dopants. For one thing, if the two dopants are far away from each other, the situation would be exactly the same as single-element doping, since there is no interaction effect between the two dopants. If the two dopants are too close, however, it is possible to form a separate compound, instead of doping individually into the carbon lattice. A typical example is that when B and N coexist in an sp2 carbon lattice, under suitable control of parameters in the synthetic process, a composite between pure carbon and non-activity BN will form.132 Therefore to achieve co-doping, the two dopant atoms should be at a suitable distance.
Kim et al.128 synthesized a composite of mesoporous carbon grown on N,S co-doped graphene nanosheets (MC/NSG) for rechargeable lithium–oxygen batteries (LOBs). ORR activity was evaluated in O2-saturated 1 M LITFSI in TEGDME with a voltammetric response between 2.2 and 3.0 V, in which the MC/NSG demonstrated better performance than the mesoporous carbon grown on un-doped graphene due to the enhancement effects of N and S co-doping on its structure and performance. Employing N,S co-doped carbon that was derived by Liao et al. from carbonized nori seaweed, the LOB delivered a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at a current density of 500 mA g−1 with a discharge plateau at 2.60 V.82 The battery also achieved 100 stable cycles under a limited capacity of 600 mA h g−1. Both results are ascribed to the better ORR activity than for the undoped sample.
Jasinski et al. demonstrated the oxygen reduction activity of cobalt phthalocyanine in alkaline electrolyte at room temperature for the first time.133 After that, carbon supported transition metal/nitrogen (M–Nx/C) motifs (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, etc., and normally x = 2 or 4), in which the transition metal atom is stabilized by doped N in the C lattice, were proved to be a group of promising co-doped ORR catalysts.42,44 The active sites of this structure are still unclear, however. Van Veen and Yeager's model suggested that the central metal atoms (M) in the M–Nx motif acted as ORR active sites; Wiesener et al., however, thought that the metal did not play a role as an active site, but only as a promoter to form ORR-active nitrogen doped carbon. In contrast, Savy and Dodelet's model postulated that both the metal centre and the N activated carbon served as active sites towards the ORR.42 Nevertheless, some consensus has still been reached: (1) the ORR active sites are important for adsorbing O2 and breaking O–O bonds. (2) The binding energy of M–O2 has a correlation with the d-orbital centre of the central transition metal in this case, indicating the possibility of optimizing other metal-containing catalysts by tuning their electronic structures or supports.134 According to theoretical calculations, the ORR activity of M–Nx follows the order of Fe > Co > Ni > Cu ≈ Mn.135
Basically, the synthesis route to the M–Nx co-doped carbon-based ORR catalysts requires a nitrogen source, a metal source, a carbon support, and suitable heat treatment. Heat treatment plays a significant role in modulating the ORR activity of the final product. For one thing, with increasing annealing temperature, N content is decreased due to volatilization, and therefore, the amount of metal and ORR activity are suppressed. On the other hand, the high temperature endows the carbon lattice with high conductivity due to the increased degree of graphitization. In the case of the most ORR active Fe–Nx doped carbon, the low-temperature active site (FeN4) contains pyrrolic nitrogen, and the high-temperature active site (FeN2) contains pyridinic nitrogen. Since the pyridinic nitrogen is more effective towards the ORR compared with pyrrolic nitrogen, the key to improving the ORR activity of non-noble metal catalysts is to increase the metal-coordinated pyridinic nitrogen content via heat treatment control. Since the metal atoms are stabilized by nitrogen doping into the carbon lattice, maximum metal loading is reached when the active nitrogen atoms are saturated with coordinated metal ions. Excess metal content may form isolated inactive materials that do not contribute to, or even suppress, ORR activity.42 This means that the tuning of the ratio between nitrogen and metal is also important for ORR activity adjustment.
Q. Li et al. used a newly designed cage-containing metal–organic framework (MOF) as a template and a novel nitrogen–carbon precursor (dicyandiamide) to synthesize N–Fe co-doped graphene/graphene-tube ORR catalysts (Fig. 9a and b), and the ORR activity in Li–O2 batteries was investigated.35 Interestingly, besides having proven that the metal atoms acted as active sites, they also found that the graphitic nitrogen was as important as the pyridinic nitrogen for the enhancement of ORR activity. Quaternary nitrogen in plane will decrease the C–N bond length to facilitate the O2 adsorption and subsequent weakening of O–O bonds. As shown in Fig. 9c, the ORR activity of N,Fe co-doped carbon is even better than for the Pt/C sample in 0.1 M LiPF6/TEGDME electrolyte. Thanks to the high ORR activity, the average voltage plateau of the N–Fe-MOF catalyst during discharge is as high as 2.80 V, significantly higher than those of carbon black (2.51 V), MOF-free N–Fe material (2.62 V), and Pt/C catalyst (2.71 V) (Fig. 9d).

As a kind of point geometric defect, the doping strategies can adjust the ORR activity of carbon-based materials. However, the detailed mechanism of these dopants, or the exact ORR active sites have rarely been experimentally proven because the dopant can also have an impact on the neighbouring carbon atoms. Besides, these geometric defects increase the instability of carbon-based materials in the superoxide radical rich electrolyte.

3.3 Defect modulation
Introducing defects on the carbon surface could improve the electrochemical performance of cathode catalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte, in the form of increased discharge capacity and lower overpotential. Here the defects are places that are different with perfect basal carbon rings, including edges, vacancies, and imperfect hexagonal carbon rings. Heteroatom doping also introduces defects, but since this part has been mentioned above, the effect of this group of defects will not be discussed in this part. Generally, the principles of defect modulation of carbon's catalytic performance in non-aqueous electrolyte can be categorized into three categories (Fig. 10): (1) defects can improve the electronic conductivity, making the carbon behave as a zero-band-gap semiconductor or take on metallic characteristics; (2) defects can lower the adsorption energies of all the reaction species, suggesting that a defect is a strong active site for starting electrochemical reactions and that it can adsorb Li2O2 homogeneously; and (3) the particle size and morphology of the discharge product are significantly modulated by the defects, resulting in a smaller discharge product particle that is easy to decompose. The details of the defect modulation strategy will be further discussed in the following part.
 Fig. 10  Principles of defect engineering for carbon catalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte. 
A density functional theory (DFT)-based first-principles study showed that defect-rich surfaces lead to a nonuniform distribution of electrons. Further density of states (DOS) graphs of defect-rich surfaces demonstrated zero-band-gap semiconductor or metallic characteristics, ensuring excellent electrical conductivity.138 According to the calculation, carbon edges will significantly contribute to the size and morphology of the discharge products as well as the charging properties. Also through first-principles calculations, H. Iba et al. reported that the defective carbon edges are deposition sites for storing solid products such as Li2O2 in Li–air batteries.136 The adsorption energies of all the reaction species on the defect model were much lower than those of species on the basal model, suggesting that a defect is a strong active site in starting electrochemical reactions. In addition, the adsorption energy of Li2O2 at defective sites was the lowest compared to all other adsorbates (O2, LiO2 and Li2O2) (Fig. 11a and b), indicating that the adsorbed Li2O2 migrated with difficulty on a defective carbon surface in comparison with the adsorbed O2 and LiO2. Therefore, a carbon surface covered with numerous defects could adsorb Li2O2 homogeneously, resulting in a layer-like morphology.

Besides theoretical calculations, Huang et al. experimentally verified that the defects on CNTs could promote the ORR, leading to an increased discharge capacity.137 The particle size of the discharge product is also modulated by the defects, decreasing from 200 nm on pristine CNTs to 50 nm on defective CNTs, as shown in Fig. 11c and d. The smaller discharge product particles are much easier to decompose, thus resulting in a lower charge overpotential and high reversibility for defect-rich CNTs (Fig. 11e).137 Notably, the roles of defects on the carbon surface in battery performance are also highly related with the type of electrolyte. In carbonate or ether-based electrolytes, such as tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), the defects on CNTs promote decomposition of the electrolyte during discharging, increasing the amount of Li2CO3 deposited on the cathode surface (Fig. 11f), which causes the cell cyclability to worsen. In contrast, the ionic liquid electrolyte can reduce the formation of side products such as Li2CO3 through the passivation layer for defect-rich CNTs.137 Thus, the defect strategy should be utilized in association with the most suitable electrolyte. Soon afterwards, T. S. Zhao et al. studied the role of point defects on the carbon surface by first-principles calculations.138 It was found that the existence of DV5555-6-7777 (four pentagons, one hexagon, and four heptagons, as shown in Fig. 11g) and Stone–Wales (SW) defects (Fig. 11h) is beneficial for non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries, which increases the discharge voltage, decreases the charge voltage, does not promote the formation of the Li2CO3 side product, and does not promote the decomposition of electrolytes (Fig. 11i).
Catalytic activity adjustment via defect engineering has become an effective approach and hot topic for almost all kinds of catalyst. However, there is still a lack of strategies that can induce defects with controlled types and amounts. The stability of these defects and their effects on the stability of carbon-based materials have also rarely been investigated.
3.4 Functionalization strategy
Besides defect modulation, functional groups could also improve the discharge process of metal–air batteries. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was demonstrated that functional groups could regulate the Li2O2 deposition mechanism on the graphene surface. The calculated binding energy of the Li2O2 monomer on the surface of –COOH functionalized graphene (−0.9 eV) is lower than that on pristine graphene (−0.26 eV), indicating that the interaction between the Li2O2 monomer and graphene is strengthened after introducing the –COOH group.69 It was suggested that the Li2O2 particles preferred to nucleate and grow around the functional group in graphene (Fig. 12a). Moreover, the functional groups can restrain Li2O2 aggregation, and thus the deposited Li2O2 would appear in the form of isolated nanosized “islands” on the graphene, ensuring smooth oxygen transport during the discharge process. The DFT results indicated that the Li2O2 aggregation on the –COOH functionalized graphene surfaces is energetically unfavourable (Fig. 12b). The –COOH functionalized graphene was tested in Li–air batteries, and it showed a high discharge capacity of 15000 mA h g−1 with a plateau at around 2.7 V (Fig. 12c). This demonstrates that the graphene catalyst's performance can be optimized by tailoring the number and positions of functional groups on the graphene.69 Amine-functionalized graphene could improve the electrical conductivity of carbon due to the electron-donating effect of the amine groups, and could also provide electrochemically active sites for oxygen adsorption reactions. As a result, the amine-functionalized graphene delivered higher capacity (19789 mA h g−1) and a more stable cycle life than pristine graphene (Fig. 12d).139 It has been proven that LiO2 is the ORR intermediate, and it undergoes two pathways to form the Li2O2 discharge product, as illustrated in Fig. 12e:140,141 one is the disproportionation reaction, as shown in the following equation (eqn (5)): (5)the other is the reduction step, as described in eqn (6): (6)

The Li2O2 formed viaeqn (5) is believed to be a toroid-like species with high crystallinity. In comparison, the Li2O2 produced viaeqn (6) shows a non-crystalline thin film-like structure. Z. Qian et al. proposed that the oxygen functional group can regulate the pathway of Li2O2 formation through controlling the binding energy between the carbon surface and the lithium superoxide 142 The functional groups can increase the binding energy between  and the carbon surface, and thus, the disproportionation reaction is inhibited to some degree.69 As a result, the discharge product characteristics are modulated by the oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface.
However, the surface functionalization may cause the following problems: (i) the wettability between the electrolyte and carbon-based catalysts could be affected by these functional groups; (ii) the functional group on the carbon surface may compete with functional groups in the electrolyte, leading to instability of ORR activity.
4. Challenges of carbon electrocatalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte
4.1 Challenges for the stability and promoting electrolyte decomposition of carbon
Carbon materials have generally been applied as air cathode materials for non-aqueous-based metal–air batteries due to their unique properties of low cost and excellent ORR catalytic activity. According to an investigation by Itkis et al.,91 carbon-based materials commonly suffer from performance fading, however, because of carbon corrosion under the harsh oxidative environments in Li–O2 batteries. Superoxide radicals generated during the discharge process will react with carbon that contains activated double bonds or aromatics to form epoxy groups and carbonates. The behaviour of the carbon electrode during charging was also investigated by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) employing a 13C isotope carbon electrode.90,143,144 When the carbon electrode is charged above 3.5 V, it exhibits significant decomposition to form Li213CO3, as shown in Fig. 13a and b. Moreover, the quantity of Li213CO3 formed by decomposition of the carbon electrode increases with increasing charging voltage, and at the same time, 13CO2 evolution in the in situ DEMS reveals that Li213CO3 is being oxidized. Therefore, the Li213CO3 is simultaneously being formed and partially oxidized on charging. Therefore, in a Li–O2 battery, the oxidation of the carbon electrode forms undesirable Li2CO3, as shown in the following equation (eqn (7)):144 (7)
 Fig. 13  Challenges for carbon catalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte: in situ DEMS data for CO2 evolution from decomposition of products formed from the electrolyte (12CO2) and the carbon cathode (13CO2) in (a) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and (b) tetraglyme-based electrolyte (for the first charging after discharge to 2.0 V). Charging is carried out in an Ar:O2 gas mixture (5:95 (v/v)). (c) Schematic diagram of carbon behaviour in non-aqueous electrolyte.90 Copyright 2013, American Chemical Society. (d) Summary of the challenges and solutions for carbon catalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte. 
The carbonate is further electrochemically oxidized to form carbon dioxide during charging, as shown in eqn (8):55 2Li2CO3 → 4Li+ + 2CO2 + O2 + 4e− (>4 V vs. Li/Li+).(8)
Notably, the carbon decomposition on charging only occurs above 3.5 V and in the presence of Li2O2 oxidation. It does not occur at lower voltages even though Li2O2 is being oxidized.
Apart from the carbon decomposition, P. G. Bruce also pointed out that carbon-based materials also promote electrolyte decomposition during discharge and charge in a Li–O2 cell, giving rise to Li2CO3 and Li carboxylates (Fig. 13c).90 This oxidation of the carbon electrode results in loss of both the carbon electrode and electrolyte.
The challenges of carbon catalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte could be alleviated by some strategies summarized in Fig. 13d, including reducing the number of defects, making use of functionalized surfaces, utilizing ionic liquid electrolyte, and keeping the charge voltage low.
Although some defects and functional groups on the carbon electrode can promote the ORR catalytic activity, they can also promote carbon corrosion, which significantly decreases the stability of the carbon electrode.91,145 For example, the initial imperfections of sp2 carbon materials strongly influence the activity and stability of carbon-based materials. Theoretical calculation by Xu et al.146 showed that the armchair edge and divacancy of carbon are highly reactive towards oxygen molecules. The defects are well known for Michael-type activated double bonds in olefins and substituted aromatics.147 The double bonds or aromatic systems activated by the presence of defects promote carbonate production. Hence, these defective sites are potentially vulnerable to superoxide radical attack. Liu et al.137 introduced defects on the surfaces of carbon nanotubes by Ar bombardment. The defects increase the number of nucleation sites and reduce the size of Li2O2, leading to increased discharge capacities and decreased overpotentials. However, the defects also enhance the formation of side products (i.e., carbonate species) by oxidation of hydrophilic carbon materials and decomposition of the TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) electrolyte.90,137 Hence, to maximize the ORR activity and alleviate the corrosion of the carbon electrode by superoxide radicals, the amount and type of defect should be carefully controlled.91 Appropriate preparation methods, such as suitable heat processing and gas phase deposition of a coating layer onto the surface, can be used to modulate defects in carbon materials.148,149 For example, highly crystalline carbon can be prepared by high-temperature treatment above 2000 °C, which substantially reduces the surface area and causes the capacity and activity of carbon to worsen.150 K. Kang et al. proposed another way of eliminating the defects in carbon-based materials, that is, selective growth of materials (such as Al2O3 and ZnO) specifically on the defect sites with the minimal amount of coating via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to prohibit the side reactions caused by defects.151,152 However, complete removal of defects in the production of large-surface carbon materials is impractical, and new ways of modulating the amount and species of defects are still needed.
Similar to defects, the surface functional groups not only have a great influence on the ORR activity, but also on the stability of carbon-based electrodes in metal–air batteries. For one thing, some oxygen related surface functional groups serve as defect sites, which are vulnerable to superoxide ion attack. For example, Huang et al.137 stated that carbon materials with hydrophilic surface groups such as C–O, COOH and C–OH are more reactive toward strong nucleophiles, such as LiO2, inducing stronger corrosion on the carbon electrode. On the other hand, the surface functional groups strongly affect the stability and activity of carbon by varying the surface wettability with non-aqueous-based electrolyte.137,153 As for the non-aqueous-based electrolyte, the hydrophilic functional groups decrease the electrochemically active surface area (EASA) while hydrophobic ones increase the EASA. Although the small EASA is not beneficial for improving the ORR activity because the ORR is a three-phase reaction, it can suppress the corrosion of the carbon electrode by preventing direct contact between the dissolved superoxide radicals and carbon.154 Lastly, some functional groups are reported to have a protective effect on carbon-based electrodes. Just recently, C. R. Park et al.153 prepared CNT buckypaper functionalized with a 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylmaleimide group as a binder-free oxygen electrode for non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries. Their results prove that the maleimide group enhances the affinity between the electrolyte and CNTs by increasing the polarity of the CNTs while the 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group protects the maleimide group from decomposition. Therefore, both the capacity and cycle stability of the Li–O2 battery are improved. In all, the selection of functional groups is essential for increasing the stability of carbon-based electrodes. To achieve high stability of the carbon electrode, oxygen related functional groups such as –CO, –COOH and –C–OH should be avoided; groups that are hydrophilic or have high stability are preferred.
The ionic liquid can also reduce the carbon corrosion and electrolyte decomposition through formation of a passivation layer for both pristine and defect-rich CNTs.137 Compared with carbonate and ether-based electrolytes, which irreversibly decompose due to the high reactivity of superoxide, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are highly chemically and electrochemically stable and feature a favourable combination of such physicochemical properties as low vapor pressure, low flammability, high thermal stability, good ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability window and hydrophobicity.89,137,155–158 Therefore, employing RTIL-based electrolyte provides protection to the carbon-based electrode. In comparison with the tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)-based electrolyte, the ionic liquid N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PP13TFSI)-based electrolyte could cover the surface defects to reduce the formation of side products such as Li2CO3 by suppressing carbon corrosion and electrolyte decomposition. Therefore, the cycle life of the defective CNTs is significantly improved in the ionic liquid.137 Hence, the passivation of stable RTILs on the surface could significantly improve the stability of the carbon electrode.
Also proven by the work of P. G. Bruce et al.,90 the major contribution to carbon decomposition occurs when the applied potential is above 3.5 V, while the carbon decomposition is much less at or below 3.5 V. Hence, the carbon electrode is very stable below 3.5 V if the charging process is carried out at a lower potential range. This means that the development of effective catalysts towards the charging (or OER) process could also help to alleviate decomposition of carbon-based materials via suppressing the charging overpotential.
4.2 Challenges of ORR activity evaluation
Uncovering the secrets of the active sites will pave the way to the controllable design and synthesis of carbon-based catalysts with higher activity and better stability. How to determine the actual configurations of the active sites and how to distinguish the sites for each individual catalyst are difficult, however, because they exist simultaneously in the carbon lattice. Advanced in situ tools are required for investigation of the structure and composition of the catalyst interfaces.42,44,159–161 For example, as a more mature and common in situ technique, in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) has been widely applied to provide a simple analytical method to characterize the discharge/charge processes of batteries.162,163 By real-time monitoring of the solid-state Li2O2 peak area via the in situ XRD technique, the efficiency of Li2O2 formation and the number of electrons were accurately evaluated by Byon et al.164 By employing an in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique, the reaction intermediates and products of the Li–O2 discharge could be easily monitored.165 Read and Abraham et al. analysed the decomposition process of an ether based electrolyte during discharge/charge by this technique in combination with in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).166,167In situ quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) has been proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the presence or absence of side-reactions in Li–air batteries.145,156 Moreover, in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques have also been used to elucidate the ORR process in Li/Na–O2 batteries.168,169
4.3 Challenges of ORR performance stability evaluation
Another practical issue lies in how to accurately evaluate the stability of the intrinsic ORR activity of a carbon material. Unlike the situation in aqueous electrolyte, where the ORR product (OH− or H2O2) is highly soluble, the ORR product in non-aqueous electrolyte-based metal–air batteries is usually deposited on the surface of the air cathode, which will prevent contact between the catalyst and oxygen. This means that besides the charge/discharge speed, cut-off capacity and charge/discharge voltage window, the stability fading of carbon-based ORR catalysts should be due to the clogged sites, not deterioration of the intrinsic activity. On the other hand, even with the same number of active sites and same amount of intrinsic activity, the ORR and discharge performances of carbon-based cathodes in the same electrolyte system are totally different if the pore size distribution and morphology are different. For one thing, it has been proven that the structural design of catalysts has a significant effect on the partial pressure of oxygen, which is critically important for the composition and morphology of the ORR products, especially for the situation in Na–O2 batteries.72,77,170–176 For Na–O2 batteries, if the discharge (or ORR) product is NaO2, which can be reversibly converted back to Na under a low overpotential, the overall cycle performance of the electrode should be excellent; however, if the ORR product is Na2O2, the cycle stability would be rather poor because of the poor conductivity and high charge overpotential of Na2O2.38 For another, with different structural designs, the deposition and clogging situation for the discharge product is different, causing performance deterioration to different extents, as displayed by the cycle performance in Tables 1 and 2.177,178 The discharge product nucleation and growth procedure of the discharge product is also significantly affected by the morphology, catalytic activity, and surface status of the carbon-based cathode, which finally have a significant impact on the capacity, round trip efficiency and cycle stability of the Li–O2 battery. A carbon-based ORR catalyst with strong adsorption towards oxygen species was proposed to facilitate the formation of defect rich or amorphous Li2O2, which are predicted to show better discharge–charge cycling due to their higher conductivity than the perfectly crystalline Li2O2,141,179,180 while ordered graphitized carbon electrodes with lower adsorption energy towards oxygen species were favourable for perfect crystalline Li2O2 particle growth.179 The defective sites on the surface of the carbon electrode can also promote surface nucleation and the subsequent growth of amorphous Li2O2.179 It has also been proven that amorphous Li2O2 films were formed on a CNT electrode functionalized by oxygen functional groups, which led to lower charge overpotential and improved cycling.179
In general, unlike the situation in aqueous electrolyte, the ORR activity of carbon-based materials in a non-aqueous electrolyte system involves a synergetic effect of the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and its structural design. This leads to a big gap between theoretical prediction of the ORR activity and practical ORR performance in metal–air batteries. And it is expected that the high specific area and good conductivity of carbon-based catalysts are important and effective in improving the ORR stability of non-aqueous-based metal–air batteries.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, this review has focused on carbon-based materials for the ORR in non-aqueous metal–air batteries and has attempted to provide comprehensive insight into their performance modulation strategies and challenges for the ORR in non-aqueous electrolyte. Owing to their environmental friendliness and low cost, carbon-based materials are considered as excellent catalysts for non-aqueous metal–air batteries. In order to obtain metal–air batteries with superior electrochemical performance, some ORR activity modulation strategies are summarized and can be categorized into the four following categories. Firstly, morphology/nanostructure engineering can increase the discharge capacity, increase the rate capability, and improve the cycling stability. The principles of morphology/nanostructure engineering can be classified as relating to three aspects: (1) increasing the active sites by introducing more edges and nanopores, which can provide more accommodation sites for discharge products (e.g. Li2O2); (2) introducing more diffusion paths by increasing large tunnels or macropores in the carbon catalysts, which can facilitate electrolyte and mass diffusion; and (3) modulating the discharge product identities (product component, morphology) by altering the carbon electrode morphology, which can improve the cycling reversibility. Secondly, the foreign-atom doping strategy can enhance the discharge voltage and capacity of carbon-based materials in non-aqueous metal–air batteries. Heteroatoms doped into the carbon lattice could significantly modify the electronic and geometric structures of pristine carbon, leading to atomic defects, which can become active sites to adsorb O2 and metal ions. In addition, heteroatoms doped into carbon induce non-uniform distributions of the spin and atomic charge density, which can tune the oxygen adsorption properties and catalytic activity. Thirdly, defect engineering modulates the carbon catalytic performance in non-aqueous electrolyte through improving the electronic conductivity or wettability, lowering the adsorption energies of all the reaction species and regulating the particle size and morphology of the discharge products. And thus, introducing defects on the carbon surface could improve ORR activity, increase the discharge capacity and lower the discharge overpotential. Fourthly, functionalization engineering can regulate the Li2O2 deposition mechanism on the graphene surface, consequently restraining Li2O2 aggregation, and modify the conductivity of the carbon.
Carbon-based catalysts for the ORR in non-aqueous metal–air batteries, however, suffer from some challenges including carbon decomposition, promoting electrolyte decomposition and compromising the ORR activity. The carbon corrosion and electrolyte decomposition in the harsh oxidative environments in Li–O2 batteries give rise to Li2CO3 and Li carboxylates, resulting in a loss of the carbon electrode and low reversibility. In addition, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the mechanism and stability of the intrinsic ORR activity of carbon materials. The challenge of carbon decomposition can be overcome by modulating the number of defects, introducing protective functional groups, utilizing ionic liquid electrolyte, and decreasing the charge potential window by employing effective OER catalysts. The challenge of ORR activity evaluation can be resolved by utilizing advanced in situ characterization techniques including in situ TEM, in situ FTIR, in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and in situ quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). In the long run, we are confident that carbon-based materials are quite promising as ORR catalysts for non-aqueous metal–air batteries because of their low cost, high conductivity, and low technological barriers.
