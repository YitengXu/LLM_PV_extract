    , Accepted 16th March 2013First published on 18th March 2013AbstractA synthetically facile and earth abundant Cu(I) metal-to-ligand charge transfer sensitizer was successfully incorporated into two distinct photochemical upconversion schemes, affording red-to-green and orange-to-blue wavelength conversions.
Photochemical upconversion is accomplished through sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation, ultimately generating high-energy photons from low energy light.1 A most promising application of this technology enables single junction solar cells to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit by capturing and converting sub-bandgap photons into those that can be absorbed by the solar cell.2–5 Similarly, wide bandgap semiconductors such as titanium dioxide and tungsten trioxide are know to split water or decompose chemical and biological contaminants in drinking water when irradiated with ultraviolet light. Photon upconversion thereby offers a means to convert terrestrial sunlight into ultraviolet light for powering solar fuels producing photoelectrochemical cells and can drive solar disinfection photochemistry.6,7
Sensitized upconversion typically uses an inorganic photosensitizer with high intersystem crossing (ISC) yield ultimately producing excited triplet states of an aromatic organic acceptor through triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET). Two triplet acceptors eventually undergo triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), forming one highly excited singlet acceptor, which then fluoresces at higher energy than the sensitizer originally absorbed. This phenomenon was first observed in the 1960's by Parker and Hatchard,8–10 but suffered from low efficiencies mainly because organic sensitizers with poor ISC yields were used. One of the first examples of an inorganic photosensitizer for photon upconversion was a ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) complex, [Ru(dmb)3]2+.11–13 Since that time other metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) complexes of Ru(II),14,15 Pt(II),16 and Ir(III)17 have been exploited as photosensitizers for photon upconversion.  
In order for this technology to be used in large-scale solar harvesting applications, the rare and costly heavy metal-containing sensitizers must eventually be replaced by more abundant and less expensive first row transition metals. This manuscript investigates the performance of the synthetically facile red-absorbing bis-(2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) copper(I) complex (1) as a sensitizer for photon upconversion in concert with the blue and green emitting acceptor/annihilators 2 and 3. This work successfully incorporates Cu(I) charge-transfer complexes as sensitizers in two distinct upconversion schemes.
Over the past 30 years, the photophysical properties of 1 and other copper(I) bis-phenanthroline complexes have been described in great detail using many different experimental techniques.18–28 The π interactions between the phenyl rings and the phenanthroline ligands lead to the geometry of 1 being distorted from a pseudo-tetrahedral (D2d) geometry in the ground state.30 This is reflected in the intensity of the low energy shoulder on the MLCT absorption band shown in Fig. 1. In the excited state, the transiently oxidized Cu center undergoes Jahn–Teller flattening rendering it susceptible to quenching through solvent coordination. However, the phenyl rings in 1 effectively shield this metal center from solvent and the complex is emissive in coordinating solvents such as acetonitrile and water.18 In comparison to other copper(I) diimine complexes, 1 has a relatively long triplet lifetime (250 ns in CH2Cl2) making it susceptible to bimolecular energy transfer reactions.22,23,29 While the rate of ISC for copper diimine complexes is considerably slower than their ruthenium counterparts (ps vs. fs),28 photoinduced electron transfer between 1 and methyl viologen has a cage escape efficiency of 95%.29 This suggests that the yield of the 3MLCT state in 1 is approaching unity.

Two acceptors were chosen to pair with 1 for proof-of-concept upconversion studies. The first, perylene (2), is a blue emitter that has been successfully incorporated as an acceptor/annihilator in a number of other photon upconversion schemes.31–34 The second, pyrromethene 546 (3), is a commercially available BODIPY laser dye. While other members of the BODIPY family have been used in photon upconversion compositions,33,35 this represents the first example of 3 being adapted to this technology. The absorption and emission spectra of 2 and 3 under optically dilute conditions are presented in Fig. 1. Bimolecular Stern–Volmer (SV) quenching experiments show that both 2 and 3 are energetically capable of quenching the triplet excited state of 1 (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Both acceptors show only moderate SV quenching constants (305 M−1 for 2 and 338 M−1 for 3) and exhibit bimolecular energy transfer rate constants slightly below the diffusion limit in CH2Cl2 (Table 1), but these still represent a significant improvement over previous results using higher energy anthracene as the excited state quencher.29 It is important to note that the low quenching constants measured for 2 and 3 does not exclude them from being useful acceptors/annihilators in sensitized upconversion, it simply means that a larger concentration of 2 and 3 must be used to sufficiently quench the sensitizer's excited state.36 In both instances, selective excitation of 1 in the presence of 2 (Fig. 2, λex = 593.5 nm) or 3 (Fig. 3, λex = 635 nm) resulted in the observation of upconverted photoluminescence that strongly resembled that of each respective acceptor/annihilator. Due to the broadband visible absorptions characteristic of the MLCT transitions in 1, the concept of upconversion margin used to describe anti-Stokes shifts (ΔE) in metalated porphyrins becomes somewhat ambiguous,37 and is defined here simply as the difference between the excitation wavelength and the peak of the upconverted fluorescence, collected in Table 1.

 Fig. 3  (a) Upconverted emission spectra from a solution of 1 (3.7 mM) and 3 (21 mM) in dichloromethane, varying the 635 nm excitation power. Black dashed line shows the fluorescence from an optically dilute solution of 3 with direct excitation (450 nm). (b) Double logarithmic plot of the emission intensity vs. excitation power. Lines illustrate a slope of 2.0 (blue, quadratic) and a slope of 1.0 (green, linear). 
In sensitized photon upconversion, the yield of excited singlet acceptors, and therefore the upconverted emission intensity, is dependent on two competing kinetic processes.38 The first is the pseudo-first order decay of the excited triplet acceptor (kT). This includes the intrinsic non-radiative decay of the triplet acceptor as well as bimolecular quenching of this triplet acceptor by oxygen. The other is the second order TTA process (kTT[3A*]). In the weak annihilation limit, where kT ≫ kTT[3A*], the resulting emission intensity will have a quadratic dependence on incident light intensity and in the strong annihilation limit, where kTT[3A*] ≫ kT, the resulting emission intensity will have a linear dependence on incident light intensity. In this latter saturation limit, the upconversion process will be at its most efficient.
The power dependence of the upconverted fluorescence signal from 2 and 3 was therefore measured as a function of incident laser power, Fig. 2 and 3. A laser diode (593.5 or 635 nm), focused to a ∼2 mm diameter spot, was used as the excitation source in these experiments. At low power, the sensitized fluorescence intensity from both 2 and 3 exhibited a quadratic dependence on excitation power, seen as a slope of 2.0 in the associated double logarithmic plots (Fig. 2b and 3b), implying that the emission arises from sensitized upconversion occurring in the weak annihilation limit. At higher incident irradiances, the respective power density dependencies become linear, seen as a slope of 1.0 in the associated double logarithmic plots (Fig. 2b and 3b), consistent with upconversion occurring in the strong annihilation limit. These latter observations are important as they illustrate that Cu(I) MLCT complexes can successfully serve as upconversion sensitizers achieving the saturation limit for a given composition. A limitation of this particular sensitizer lies in its small SV quenching constants that mandate large concentrations of quenchers to facilitate upconversion (10 mM for 2 and 21 mM for 3). The blue portions of the upconverted emission spectra are reabsorbed by ground state acceptor chromophores under these experimental conditions. This inner filter effect is responsible for the distortions observed in the anti-Stokes fluorescence emission profiles from the two upconversion compositions, Fig. 2a and 3a. Similarly, these experiments also required significant incident power densities to access the high efficiency linear regime in both instances. Given the inability to achieve such excitation powers in real-world solar-driven applications, we did not attempt to evaluate the upconversion quantum efficiencies in these particular compositions but note that Cu(I) charge transfer chromophores with extended lifetimes39 would significantly lower the incident power requirements, shifting the desired linear regime towards solar concentrated flux.
The current effort represents the first example of a copper(I) diimine complex successfully being used as a sensitizer in two distinct upconversion photoreactions, accomplishing a red-to-green conversion (ΔE = 0.52 eV) as well as an orange-to-blue (ΔE = 0.34 eV) wavelength shift. While the performance of this new copper based sensitizer cannot effectively compete with previously established metalated porphyrin-based sensitizers,1 this work does indeed demonstrate that Cu(I) MLCT complexes readily enable upconversion photochemistry. Further modification of the diimine ligand framework to lengthen the lifetime of the resultant Cu(I) complex would increase its susceptibility to bimolecular quenching and may lead to new, low cost, synthetically facile sensitizers that can compete with and potentially replace established compositions incorporating low abundance heavy metals.
