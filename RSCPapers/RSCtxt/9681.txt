    , Accepted 8th December 2017First published on 11th December 2017AbstractExploiting solar power for hydrogen production from seawater is a great challenge owing to the corrosive properties of seawater and inadequate visible-light conversion capabilities. Here we report an uncomplicated post-processing method to construct Ti3+ self-doped titanium–silicon material with corrosion resistance. This is a new experimental method to regulate the electrical, optical, and photocatalytic performances of titanium-containing photocatalysts in a controlled way. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ti–O–Si materials with different calcination temperatures can serve as a highly efficient and convenient catalyst for photogeneration of hydrogen from water and simulated seawater. Consequently, the optimized Ti–O–Si (400) sample exhibits impressive enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, by nearly 10.0 and 43.1 times compared with TiO2 nanoparticles in water and simulated seawater. The Ti–O–Si (400) with substantial Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 production performance due to the improved separation and transmission of the photogenerated electron–hole, the extended visible light response, and corrosion resistance. Our work opens a new door to engineering the intrinsic properties of the titanium-containing materials.
Introduction
With increasing concerns regarding the prevalent energy crisis and environmental pollution, hydrogen (H2) as an alternate fuel is receiving considerable attention from around the world.1–3 As one of the prospective technologies, solar driven H2 generation plays a considerable role in H2 evolution strategies as a renewable and clean energy source that can compensate for rapidly depleting fossil fuels.4–6 In the past decade, many kinds of materials have been utilized for photocatalytic H2 production.7–9 Of these, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is famous as one of the most extensively utilized materials in the fields of photocatalytic and solar energy conversion.10,11 Unfortunately, the application of TiO2 to photocatalytic H2 production generally suffers from moderate photocatalytic activities due to a fast electron–hole recombination and a wide band gap (3.0–3.2 eV).12–15 Over the last 40 years, various strategies have been explored to improve the performance of TiO2 including doping metals (Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, Cr),16–19 nonmetal elements (N, S, C, I),20–22 noble metal nanodots,23–25 dye-sensitized decorated TiO2 nanostructures,26,27 and constructing heterojunctions with other semiconductor materials.28–32
In particular, a lot of interest has been focussed on the Ti3+ (or oxygen vacancies) in self-doped TiO2.33 As is well known, the photoexcitation in stoichiometric anatase TiO2 comes from transitions from the O 2p states in the valence band (VB) to the 3d states of the Ti (formally Ti4+) cations in the conduction band (CB).34 Moreover, Ti4+ in TiO2 can very easily be reduced to Ti3+.35 As shown by the material's color, the d → d transitions from the gap states promote the optical performances of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2.36 Consequently, owing to the band gap narrowing and enhancing of the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole connected with the existence of the Ti3+ induced band gap state, a highly active Ti3+ self-doped photocatalyst has been implemented.37 Usually, Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 is obtained by generating oxygen vacancies from sodium borohydride (NaBH4), as well as additional reducing reagents (Al, Zn, and H2etc.).38–41 However, the reduction method is difficult because of the need for high temperatures or a high pressure sophisticated environment along with H2/N2/Ar treatments.42 It is thus important to develop a low-cost, environmentally-friendly, and reproducible method for the large-scale preparation of Ti3+ defects in photocatalysts with dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity.43 Keeping these facts in mind, lately we have successfully synthesized a homogeneous titanium–silicon material with corrosion resistance by selecting the low cost and less toxic organosilane and titanium(IV) butoxide as the raw materials. Interestingly, we discovered that the commonly used thermal treatment strategy (i.e., direct heating of titanium–silicon material to 400 °C for 3 h) under atmospheric pressure and air atmosphere can also be used for the synthesis of Ti3+ self-doped in titanium (Ti4+)–silicon material. Furthermore, compared to the scarcity of fresh water, we first discovered that the Ti3+ defects in titanium (Ti4+)–silicon materials can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from simulated seawater under solar light irradiation.
In this research, we first report the uncomplicated synthesis and detailed characterization of Ti3+ defects in corrosion resistant titanium (Ti4+)–silicon materials to the best of our knowledge. This is the latest experimental method to regulate the electrical, optical, and photocatalytic performances of titanium-containing photocatalysts in a controlled way. Owing to the introduction of a certain amount of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, the Ti–O–Si (400) and Ti–O–Si (500) materials showed excellent light absorption covering both the visible and ultraviolet light region. The obtained Ti–O–Si (400) material, with excellent optical properties, displayed much better capability in photocatalytic H2 production from fresh water and simulated seawater than pure TiO2 nanocrystals. Furthermore, a possible mechanism is also proposed whereby the Ti3+ doping and introduction of Ti–O–Si (400) synergistically improve the visible light photocatalytic activity due to a reduced band gap and restrain the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.
Experimental
Reagents
Diethoxydimethylsilane ((CH3)2Si(C2H5O)2, 98.0%), p-xylene solution (C8H10, 99.0%), triethoxymethylsilane (C7H18O3Si, 98.0%), titanium(IV) butoxide (C16H36O4Ti, 99.0%), ethanol absolute (C2H6O, 99.8%), and triethanolamine (C6H15NO3, 99.0%) were purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd. The materials were all utilized without further purification and were all analytically pure. Deionized water was utilized throughout the experimental work.
Preparation of TiO2, Ti–O–Si, Ti–O–Si (400, 500, and 600) materials
8.0 mL (0.04 mol) methyltriethoxysilane, 8.9 g (0.06 mol) dimethyldiethoxysilane, and 25 mL ethanol absolute were added to a 250 mL three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. The mixture was stirred at 140 rpm with a mechanical stirrer and heated to a temperature of 65 °C. After adding 0.17 mL of HCl, 4.41 g (0.25 mol) H2O was added drop by drop to the mixed solution allowing a hydrolysis reaction. After completion of the dropwise addition, the temperature was maintained at 65 °C for 2 h. Then, 6.81 g (0.02 mol) titanium(IV) butoxide dissolved in 20 mL p-xylene solution and 1.891 g (0.11 mol) H2O were added dropwise, respectively, to the mixture solution, and then the solution was maintained at 65 °C for about 2 h for the hydrolysis reaction (clear liquid). A three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a condenser, and a vacuum pump was used to perform a reduced pressure condensation. The pressure was 0.02 MPa. The hydrolysis solution was heated to 80 °C to distill out the ethanol, n-butanol, and p-xylene solution, and was then heating was continued the reaction solution to 120 °C for a decompression condensation for about 2 h. This solution was allowed to stand for a period of time (30 d) for curing. The obtained solids were respectively washed with ethanol and deionized water (labeled as Ti–O–Si). The Ti–O–Si material was heat treated at 400, 500, and 600 °C for 3 h under atmospheric pressure and air atmosphere (labeled as Ti–O–Si (400), Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600)). For comparison, a TiO2 sample was prepared using the same method and heat treated at 400 °C for 3 h without the addition of methyltriethoxysilane and dimethyldiethoxysilane. The specific synthetic steps of the materials are shown in Fig. S1.†
Characterization
To measure the structural variations, the XRD patterns (X-ray diffraction, Bruker D8 Advance) were obtained by using graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. Raman spectra were measured using a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia) in the backscattering geometry using an Ar ion laser (532 nm) as an excitation source at room temperature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the materials were measured on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with the KBr tableting method. Microstructural characterization and the elemental mapping of the desired regions were performed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hatachi, S-4800) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on an FEI, Tecnai G2 F20 TEM. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer) were obtained by conversion of the Kubelka–Munk approach with BaSO4 as a reference at room temperature. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer at 110 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos) measurements were carried out with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα, 15 kV, 200 W). Steady-state/time-resolved photoluminescence emission spectra (320 nm excitation) were measured at room temperature with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLSP-920).
Photocatalytic H2 production
Photocatalytic experiments for H2 evolution were carried out in a pyrex reaction cell connected by a closed gas evacuation and circulation system. 0.100 g of sample powder was dispersed in a mixed system of 78 mL of distilled H2O and 10 vol% of triethanolamine (TEOA, sacrificial reagent) and with its pH adjusted to 8.2. The suspension of aqueous solution was then degassed for 1 h and irradiated by 300 W Xe lamp without or with an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) (PLS-SXE300, Trusttech). A flow of cooling water was used to maintain the reaction temperature at room temperature. The content of H2 generated was determined by online gas chromatography (GC7900, Tian Mei, Shanghai) equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) by using nitrogen as the carrier gas, as shown in Fig. S2.†
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements (CHI660C electrochemical Instruments) utilized a standard three-electrode system with a Na2SO4 (1 mol L−1) aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and platinum flake were used as the reference electrodes and counter electrodes, respectively. The sample electrodes served as the working electrode that was obtained by using the doctor blade coating method to help the suspensions deposit onto Indiumtinoxide (ITO). The light source employed was a 300 W Xe lamp. The working electrodes were prepared through the following method: the nanocomposite (0.05 g) was ground with 0.5 mL deionized water and 0.02 g polyethylene glycol to make a slurry. Next, the slurry was coated onto ITO glass electrodes and these electrolytes were dried at 120 °C for 2 h.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and composition

Scheme 1 evidently shows that the Ti–O–Si materials were obtained by a multi-step hydrolysis and condensation process, these are obviously distinct from white perfect TiO2 nanoparticles. The individual Ti3+ self-doped Ti–O–Si materials obtained after the ordinary heat treatment method (air atmosphere and atmospheric pressure) change their color dramatically by causing partial Ti–O–Ti bonds to break. More meaningfully, according to this color change we observe that they can be kept for up to 10 months unchanged, the defects in Ti3+ self-doped Ti–O–Si materials exhibit excellent stability. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystallite sizes and crystal structures of the as-obtained samples were researched using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The diffraction peaks of the TiO2 sample exhibit a distinct anatase structure without any other impurity components consistent with the JCPDS card No. 65-5714. By forming a uniform transparent Ti–O–Si material, XRD characterization showed that the crystalline state of TiO2 was changed. Moreover, through gradually increasing the calcination temperature, the TiO2 diffraction peak becomes sharper and stronger owing to the increase of crystallinity. The maximum peak intensity was observed once the annealing temperature increased to 600 °C, which indicates that the Ti–O–Si bonds are all destroyed by ultra-high temperature treatment. Moreover, these XRD results show that annealing at the highest temperature does not cause a crystal phase transformation, indicating that the carefully controlled synthesis of Ti–O–Si materials with distinct bulk Ti3+ distributions can inhibit phase transformation from anatase to rutile.

Fig. 2 depicts the FTIR spectra of the obtained samples. It shows several bands at 605.3, 863.8, 1069.6, 1271.7, 2968.4, and 3432 cm−1. For TiO2, the spectra showed a broad absorption peak around 605.3 cm−1, which was attributed to the Ti–O–Ti stretching vibrations.44 The presence of an absorption peak around 3400 cm−1 was attributed to the O–H stretching frequency, which came from the surface hydroxyl groups.45 In the case of the Ti–O–Si and Ti–O–Si (400) materials, there were five characteristic peaks in the region of 800–3500 cm−1. The peaks at 863.8, 1069.6, 1271.7, 2968.4, and 3432 cm−1 were attributed to the Ti–O–Si groups stretching, Si–O–Si groups stretching, –CH3 groups bending vibration, –CH3 groups stretching, and O–H stretching frequency from the surface hydroxyl frequency, respectively.46,47 For Ti–O–Si (500) and Ti–O–Si (600), however, the peaks of the Ti–O–Si bonds and –CH3 functional groups decreased dramatically in intensity or even disappeared. The crystallite size of TiO2, Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600) were determined by using Sherrer's formula (L = 0.89λ/βcosθ) and are 7.7, 8.6, and 8.0 nm, respectively. Apparently, the crystal size of TiO2 and Ti–O–Si (600) is getting closer due to the total breakage of the Ti–O–Si bonds.

As a more sensitive technique for unambiguously discriminating the local order characteristics of the as-prepared samples, Raman spectroscopy is the accepted method to monitor the microstructure variations.48 As shown in Fig. 3, the characteristic Raman peaks of pure TiO2 at 143.9, 401.2, 504.1, and 642.0 cm−1 are ascribed to the Eg1, B1g1, A1g + B1g2, and Eg3 modes of anatase TiO2, respectively, and the strongest peak at 143.9 cm−1 is the symmetric stretching modes of O–Ti–O.49 Compared to pure TiO2 samples and the literature, the Raman vibration peaks of Ti–O–Si and Ti–O–Si (400) are shifting, broadening, weakening, and can even disappear, which reveal that the crystallography geometric symmetry is changed due to the structure distortion.50 From T500 to T600, the intensity of the Raman peaks increases with the increase of calcination temperatures, implying the improvement of anatase TiO2 crystallinity, which is in agreement with the XRD results.

In order to investigate the surface composition of Ti–O–Si and Ti–O–Si (400) materials, the XPS was employed to analyze the chemical composition and bonding configuration for the as-prepared sample, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The full scale XPS pattern of Ti–O–Si and Ti–O–Si (400) are shown in Fig. S3,† which indicates the existence of Ti, O, Si, and C elements. What is more, no other elements are detected, revealing that the unreacted HCl can be washed off completely by deionized water. The peak at 284.0 eV in high-resolution C 1s could be attributed to the signals of the Si–C bonds (Fig. 4(a)). As shown in Fig. 4(b), the binding energies of Ti4+ 2p1/2, Ti3+ 2p1/2, Ti4+ 2p3/2, and Ti3+ 2p3/2 are 464.7, 462.7, 458.8, and 456.8 eV, respectively.51 The surface atomic concentration of the Ti3+ ion is also obtained from XPS (Table S1†). During synthesis, the mixture solution is composed of methyltriethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, and titanium(IV) butoxide dissolved in absolute ethanol at the molecular level to form Ti–O–Si composites, consequently removing the probability of bulk diffusion restrictions during the heat treatment process. After heat treatment, part of the Ti–O–Ti bond breaks to form the Ti–O–Si (400) with defects. As expected, the O 1s was decomposed at two peaks (Fig. 4(c)). The peak at 530.0 and 531.7 eV in high-resolution O 1s could be attributed to the signals of Ti–O–Si and Si–O.52 Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4(d), the signals of Si4+ in Ti–O–Si and Ti–O–Si (400) materials peaked at around 101.9 eV.53

To further confirm the presence of subsurface and bulk Ti3+, EPR spectroscopy at 110 K was performed on the as-prepared samples. For comparison, the pristine TiO2 sample has also been tested. As illustrated in Fig. 4(e), no obvious EPR signals were detected in the TiO2 nanoparticles, which indicate that the compositions of titanium elements in this sample are all in the Ti4+ 3d0 states. Ordinarily, the surface Ti3+ can easily absorb oxygen from the air, which could be reduced to superoxide radical anions with an EPR signal at a g-value of 2.02.54,55 Therefore, no signal attributed to surface Ti3+ is found, showing the absence of surface Ti3+. Furthermore, the Ti–O–Si (400) and Ti–O–Si (500) materials show all intense axially symmetry signals centered on the g value of 1.99 corresponding to bulk Ti3+ spins due to localized Ti3+ 3d1 states, which are consistent with the previously reported results of Ti3+ ions in titanium-containing materials.56 The above outcomes confirm the successful synthesis of Ti3+ self-doped Ti–O–Si (400) photocatalysts, and are in good agreement with the results of other tests.
Morphology
The scanning electron micrograph of TiO2, Ti–O–Si, Ti–O–Si (400), Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600) were characterized by SEM. The morphology of as-prepared TiO2 is shown in Fig. S4(a) and (a1).† The morphology of TiO2 consists of irregular particles or a small aggregation of grains. However, the prepared Ti–O–Si (Fig. S4(b) and (b1)†) exhibits a thick sheet morphology, which is beneficial to protect the titanium element from simulated seawater corrosion. By increasing the annealing temperature, the morphology of Ti–O–Si (400) (Fig. S4(c) and (c1)†) and Ti–O–Si (500) (Fig. S4(d) and (d1)†) materials have not changed. Furthermore, when the temperature reaches 600 °C (Fig. S4(e) and (e1)†), the morphology also has not changed, but there is a small amount of TiO2 particles on the surface. These results indicate that the Ti–O–Si bonds are all destroyed by ultra-high temperature treatment once again. In addition, the EDS of TiO2 (Fig. S4(a2)†), Ti–O–Si (Fig. S4(b2)†), Ti–O–Si (400) (Fig. S4(c2)†), Ti–O–Si (500) (Fig. S5(d2)†) and Ti–O–Si (600) (Fig. S5(e2)†) from SEM respectively indicate the presence of Ti, O, Si, or C.
TEM and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses were executed to further survey the shapes and the lattice properties of the as-obtained photocatalysts. Fig. 5(a) shows that TiO2 is indeed highly crystalline, which is consistent with the FESEM observations. The HRTEM image (Fig. 5(a1)) presents a (101) plane of anatase TiO2 that has an inherent spacing distance of 0.346 nm.57 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 5(a2)) revealed the crystalline nature of TiO2 with bright diffraction rings accorded to a (101) plane of TiO2, successively. Interestingly, the TEM image (Fig. 5(b)) reveals that the Ti–O–Si material is uniform and transparent in the plane shape, which states that the mixture solution of titanium(IV) butoxide, methyltriethoxysilane, and dimethyldiethoxysilane are linked homogeneously at the molecular level to form Ti–O–Si complexes. Unlike the TiO2 particles, this corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 5(b1)) and SAED pattern (Fig. 5(b2)) also attests to this point. The prepared Ti–O–Si complexes exhibited a thick flat morphology, which is beneficial in protecting the titanium element from the simulated seawater corrosion. According to TEM (Fig. 5(c)), HRTEM (Fig. 5(c1)), and the SAED pattern (Fig. 5(c2)) test results, the morphology of Ti–O–Si (400) materials have not changed with increasing the annealing temperature. When the temperature respectively reached 500 (Fig. 5(d)) and 600 °C (Fig. 5(e)), the morphology also has not changed, but there are many TiO2 particles in the interior. The chemical structure of Ti–O–Si material has been changed in the calcination process, and many TiO2 particles were present in the silicon layer. As shown in Fig. 5(d1) and (e1), the lattice spacing was measured as d = 0.346 nm, which is consistent with the (101) plane of TiO2. The SAED pattern (Fig. 5(d2) and (e2)) revealed the crystalline nature of TiO2 in Ti–O–Si (500) and Ti–O–Si (600) with bright diffraction rings accorded with a (101) plane of TiO2, successively. The obtained TiO2 particles were still surrounded by the silicon layer so that it avoided corrosion from seawater. The element mapping (Fig. 5(f)) investigations revealed the presence of C, O, Si, and Ti (element mapping signal from SEM).

Corrosion resistance and optical absorption properties
The corrosion resistance of the as-obtained photocatalysts at ambient temperature is shown in Fig. 6, Fig. S5 and S6.† The coating plate contains TiO2 particles according to the composition of the coating. The paint surface covered the Ti–O–Si material coating and the pure paint plate were both immersed in 5 wt% NaCl and fluorescein aqueous solution. After soaking for 10 days, the pure paint plate on the fluorescein could not be washed away. In contrast, the paint surface covered with the Ti–O–Si material coating does not have any fluorescein attached to it. Under simulated sea conditions, this indicates that the titanium–silicon material is not damaged and has a high corrosion resistance. However, after soaking in simulated seawater for only 10 days (Fig. S7†), the XRD intensity of the TiO2 nanoparticles became weaker and the color and absorbability of the TiO2 sample were all changed, which indicates that the simulated seawater can greatly affect the properties of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, to find the wetting properties of the water on the coating surface covered Ti–O–Si material and the pure paint plate surface, the apparent contact angle was measured and illustrated in Fig. 6. The results show that the pure paint plate transitioned from the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic surface after the covering Ti–O–Si material coating. The static contact angle increases from 70.80° ± 2 to 93.86° ± 2 with the Ti–O–Si surface coating. The appropriate hydrophobic properties favor the photogeneration of hydrogen in the simulated seawater by the photocatalyst.

(b) The pure paint plate. Images of a water droplet on the paint plate with Ti–O–Si material and the pure paint plate. The volume of the droplet is 5 μl. 
It was expected that the defects of the as-obtained samples would have a strong impact on the optical performances of the photocatalyst. The optical properties of the as-obtained photocatalysts were studied by recording the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS). As shown in Fig. 7, a precipitous increase in absorption at wavelengths shorter than 402 nm and 390 nm can respectively be from the intrinsic band gap of the TiO2 and Ti–O–Si sample. In comparison with that of the pristine TiO2 and Ti–O–Si samples, a great red shift of the intrinsic absorption edge of Ti–O–Si (400) and Ti–O–Si (500) materials due to the formation of Ti3+ cations or O vacancies was noticed. However, when the temperature reached 600 °C, in comparison with that of Ti–O–Si (400) and (500), a slight blue shift of the intrinsic absorption edge of Ti–O–Si (600) sample was observed. This shift can be attributed to the completely fractured Ti–O–Si chemical bond, eventually forming white nanoparticles. Based on the plot of a transformed Kubelka–Munk function (αhυ)1/2versus the energy of exciting light (hυ) (Fig. S8†), the band-gaps of TiO2, Ti–O–Si, Ti–O–Si (400), Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600) were estimated to be 3.01, 3.01, 2.36, 2.82, and 3.01 eV, respectively.58 By linearly extrapolating the leading edge of the VB of the XPS of Ti–O–Si (400) to the base line (Fig. S9†), the VB level was determined to be +1.32 eV.59 The band-gap of Ti–O–Si (400) was determined to be 2.36 eV, with the corresponding CB position at −1.04 eV. The band structure indicated that the band edge of the Ti–O–Si (400) sample satisfies the thermodynamic requirement for the water reduction reaction.

Photocatalytic H2 production and stability
The photocatalytic H2 evolution abilities of TiO2, Ti–O–Si, Ti–O–Si (400), Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600) were each investigated in 78 mL pure deionized water solution and 10 vol% TEOA (adjusted to pH 8.2) or 78 mL 5 wt% NaCl water solution and 10 vol% TEOA (adjusted to pH 8.2) under irradiation with full-sunlight. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the H2 production rates of TiO2, Ti–O–Si, Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600) samples were 163.2, 329.9, 952.1, and 465.4 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively, while the Ti–O–Si (400) could reach up to 1640.2 μmol h−1 g−1, which is more than 10.0 times higher than that of TiO2 (163.2 μmol h−1 g−1). It is easy to draw the conclusion that the photocatalytic H2 production and photoconversion of Ti–O–Si (400) materials can be significantly improved by Ti3+ self-doped Ti–O–Si materials, which have perfectly conquered the two main shortcomings of TiO2 nanoparticles, containing poor visible-light utilization and high charge-recombination rates. In addition, for more than 40 years, photocatalytic hydrogen production was needed in fresh water, but the scarcity of freshwater resources led to the selection of new sources of water, and the richness of seawater resources may make it a great application in the field of photocatalysis. Therefore, 5 wt% NaCl water solution is used to simulate seawater.60 As compared to the photocatalytic H2 production of the TiO2 sample in pure water, the H2 production rate of TiO2 is reduced 3.6 times in simulated seawater. The results show that excessive NaCl hinders the separation and transmission of the photogenerated electron–hole. On the contrary, the H2 production rate of Ti–O–Si (400) was almost 1.2 times that of the Ti–O–Si (400) material. Hence, these different photocatalytic H2 evolution activities shown by Ti–O–Si materials may have resulted from the thick sheet morphology, which is beneficial in protecting the titanium element from simulated seawater corrosion. At the same time, compared to other materials, the Ti–O–Si (400) material with increased photocatalytic activity may be due to the introduction of NaCl affecting the surface interface properties of special materials, thus resulting in a higher carrier separation efficiency of the materials. Furthermore, by filtering out the incident ultraviolet light (Fig. S10†), the Ti–O–Si (400) sample still showed higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for Ti–O–Si reached 8.9% at 420 nm in 5 wt% NaCl water solution. A photocatalyst must display a stable performance for its successful practical application.61 The stability of Ti–O–Si (400) was assessed in a 5 wt% NaCl water solution under irradiation with full-sunlight by carrying out a “time-circle” H2 evolution experiment. The reaction was stopped every four hours. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the photocatalytic H2 evolution was maintained for seven repeated runs without adding a sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic experiment period, indicating good stability and recycling performance by Ti–O–Si (400). Furthermore, analysis of the XRD pattern, FTIR spectrum, EPR spectrum, and XPS spectrum of Ti–O–Si (400) after this experiment (Fig. S11 and S12†) also indicated its good stability.62 The reason for the high stability of this photocatalytic activity is as follows: the prepared Ti–O–Si complexes exhibited a thick flat morphology, which is beneficial in protecting the titanium element from simulated seawater corrosion. In addition, the EPR signals are not surface Ti3+ but bulk Ti3+ spins, which can effectively avoid the photocorrosion.

Clarification of the mechanism
To further demonstrate the charge separation efficiency levels, the transient photocurrent responses of the TiO2, Ti–O–Si, Ti–O–Si (400), Ti–O–Si (500), and Ti–O–Si (600) photoelectrodes were obtained by the I–t curves with seven on–off cycles under full-sunlight irradiation (Fig. 9(a)).63 An implication can be drawn that the photocurrent value that rapidly appeared in all the photoelectrodes when the lamp was turned on, and then quickly returned to zero when the lamp was turned off, demonstrating that the photoelectrodes had great stability and repeatability. The order of the photocurrent value under full-sunlight illumination was Ti–O–Si (400) > Ti–O–Si (500) > Ti–O–Si (600) > Ti–O–Si > TiO2, which certificated that the Ti–O–Si (400) sample could greatly improve the separation of the photoproduced electron–hole. This experimental result shows that Ti3+ can efficiently enhance the transmission efficiency of photogenerated electrons. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the electrical conductivity of the samples (Fig. 9(b)).64 Considering the diameters of the semicircles were associated with the charge-transfer resistance of a photocatalyst, the electrical Nyquist plots indicated the information on the charge transfer process across the electrode/electrolyte interface. Generally, the smaller size of the semicircle arc diameter implies the fast separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and smaller charge-transfer resistance in an EIS Nyquist plot. Compared to other as-obtained samples, the smallest arc radius of a Nyquist plot for Ti–O–Si (400) suggests the smallest charge transfer resistance of Ti–O–Si (400).

The photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy technique can be considered as a useful method to comprehend the transfer and recombination of the photoproduced electron–hole in a composite.65 Thus, the PL spectra of as-obtained photocatalysts has been investigated as shown in Fig. 10(a). The PL spectrum of pure TiO2 displayed a sharp emission peak at 467 nm. The intensity of the emission bands of Ti–O–Si (400) and Ti–O–Si (500) were lower than that of TiO2, demonstrating that the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs through the Ti3+ was more suppressed for Ti–O–Si (400) and Ti–O–Si (500) than that for TiO2. We further obtained information about the charge-carrier transport by the time-resolved PL spectra collected at the wavelength of their maximum emission as shown in Fig. 10(b). After multi-exponential fitting, the radiative lifetimes of pure TiO2, Ti–O–Si (400), and Ti–O–Si (500) were 0.34 ns, 2.78 ns, and 2.21 ns, respectively. The resulting PL lifetime (τ) is 2.78 ns for Ti–O–Si (400), which is almost 8.18 times longer than that of TiO2. The lifetime prolongation of charge carriers had an indispensable role in improving photocatalytic reactions before recombination.66,67 It is believed that the increased lifetime of charge carriers is associated with electron transport improvement and electronic structure change induced by the Ti3+ defect effect in the Ti–O–Si (400) materials. This outcome is consistent with the transient photocurrent response, EIS, and PL spectrum.

According to the above test, the possible photo-generated electron transfer mechanisms of Ti–O–Si (400) composites are shown in Fig. 11. Under full-sunlight irradiation, the Ti–O–Si (400) sample is excited to produce an electron (e−) on the conduction band (CB) of the Ti–O–Si (400) composite, leaving a hole (h+) on the valence band (VB). Finally, the electrons reacted with H+ and it becomes H2. In the meantime, the Ti–O–Si (400) sample that accumulated holes could have reacted with the TEOA molecule. There are two ways for the photoexcitation to occur in the Ti3+ self-doped samples; one arises from the Ti3+ 3d1 electrons near the Fermi level (close to CBM), and the other is from the O 2p6 electrons near VBM. The dark color is caused by the transitions (Ti3+ 3d1 → Ti3+ 3d1 or Ti4+ 3d0) of the Ti3+ 3d1 electrons to the unoccupied Ti 3d states.49 The Ti3+ self-doped Ti–O–Si material with the excellent broad-spectrum light absorption capacity can generate an extra photoinduced electron–hole and cause a better full-sunlight photocatalytic H2 production activity than pure TiO2. Furthermore, compared to the pure TiO2 nanoparticles, the unique corrosion resistance of the titanium–silicon material makes it possible to maintain a higher photocatalytic H2 production activity in simulated seawater.

Conclusions
In summary, Ti3+ self-doped titanium–silicon material constructed using a novel approach induced changes in defect distribution, defect concentration, and the band gap. Amongst the many factors, a non-uniform distribution of defects in the bulk plays a key role in terms of photocatalytic activity. Such as, the Ti–O–Si (400) sample gains enhanced photocatalytic activity not only in fresh water, but also in simulated seawater. The H2 generation of Ti–O–Si (400) is respectively 10.0 times greater in pure water and 43.1 times greater in simulated seawater than that of a TiO2 nanoparticle under full-sunlight irradiation, superior to the frequently reported titanium-containing materials in simulated seawater. The excellent photocatalytic activity of Ti–O–Si (400) depends on the recombination center reduction, solar absorption enhancement, and corrosion resistance. We believe that the preparation method provides an effective way for the rational design of corrosion resistant Ti3+ self-doped Ti–O–Si materials. Therefore, hydrogen can be produced from seawater, which would be an interesting and important research direction to boost the potential practical application ability of the photocatalyst.
