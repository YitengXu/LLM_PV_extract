    , Accepted 14th January 2020First published on 16th January 2020AbstractMulticolor lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles have attracted extensive interest due to their application in biosensing, bioimaging, and therapeutics. Herein, a facile strategy of inert gadolinium or yttrium ion doping is proposed to implement tunable multicolor upconversion luminescence in a conventional single red emitting KMnF3 matrix through engineering the local crystal structure and controlling the energy exchanging transfer process. Variation of the Gd3+ or Y3+ doping content in the KMnF3:Yb3+/Er3+ lattice induces a gradual morphological transformation from cube to polyhedron, which arises from the increased lattice binding. The enlarged crystal cell size and the engineered local crystal structure enable the confinement of energy transfer as well as back transfer between Er3+ emitters and Mn2+ ions. Moreover, the partial replacement of Mn2+ ions by Gd3+ or Y3+ ions also weakens the intense interaction between Er3+ and Mn2+ ions. Based on the above functions caused by the precise control of the inert ion doping amount, a palette of multicolor UC luminescence shifting from red to green can be produced and immediately recognized by the naked eye. The results here provide the possibility of realizing simultaneous control of the physical dimensions as well as the luminescence properties of lanthanide-doped upconversion systems.
Introduction
Lanthanide-doped upconversion (UC) nano/micromaterials are able to efficiently convert two or more near-infrared (NIR) photons into visible or ultraviolet luminescence, characterized by a successive multiphoton process in a system of real energy levels in an appropriate host lattice.1–3 Compared with organic dyes or quantum dots, lanthanide doped UC materials have distinct advantages of high photon stability, non-blinking and blanching, tunable emission color, large anti-Stokes shift etc4,5 These outstanding advantages favor their extensive applications in optical bioimaging, 3D display, photo-catalysis, sensing, and solar cells by manipulating the emission color, excitation wavelength, decay lifetime, and polarization properties.6–9 In particular, achieving tailored multicolor UC emission gains continuous interest not only due to the fundamental understanding of the related upconversion mechanism, but also for applications in multichannel biosensing, theranostics, full color display, and multiplex coding.10–14
Tunable emission bands can be achieved through various approaches, among which researchers prefer to control the energy transfer and migration processes between activators and sensitizers,15–18 for instance, Liu et al. obtained photoluminescence covering blue to near-infrared by precise control of the emission intensity balance of Yb3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ dopants,19 as well as through the exploitation of energy migration from Tm3+ to Gd3+ and then to other activators.8 However, another efficient strategy is to induce energy cross relaxation via varying their doping concentrations. For example, the emission intensity ratio of green/red lights can be controlled precisely by adjusting the concentration of Er3+ ions from 1% to even 50%, as well as the variation from blue to red through increasing the concentration of Tm3+ ions from 0.2% to even 10%.20,21 In addition, Zhao's group22 and Liu's group23 discovered that the 4T1 level of Mn2+ ions can acquire the energy transferred from 2H9/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ ions, followed by back transfer to the 4F9/2 level of Er3+ ions, as a result, a substantially enhanced red/green ratio or even single red emission was obtained. Recently, other active impurity doping strategies of Tm3+/Yb3+/Ce3+/Ho3+ ions in a Er3+ sensitized system also showed great potential in remarkable UC color tuning via controlling the energy transfer and back transfer processes.24–26 In particular, Tm3+ ions could serve as energy reservoirs that can transfer the stored energy back to the activators and shift the corresponding population into lower excited states. With the co-doping of Tm3+ ions, the red UC emission from Er3+-activated UCNPs was further boosted.24,26 Apart from this, other methods of realizing full-color volumetric three-dimensional display by modulating pulsed excitation lasers and excitation power densities were also demonstrated to be effective means for modulating the population distribution of typical green (2H11/2/4S3/2) and red (4F9/2) energy levels, which benefits the control of UC emission profiles.14,27,28 However, the phenomenon of luminescence concentration quenching of the excited state, excitation energy losses and increased nonradiative relaxation in active ion doped multicolor UC systems caused by deleterious cross-relaxation processes pose a significant constraint.29–31 Herein, we reported a simple inert Gd3+/Y3+ ion doping strategy to achieve tailored UC emissions from red to green through engineering the local crystal field structure of conventional single red emitting KMnF3:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles. This kind of inert impurity doping strategy exhibits extraordinary ability in controlling the local crystal structure and energy exchanging transfer processes without unnecessary energy loss, thus achieving efficient modulation of the competitive UC emission pathways of green and red outputs. Our strategy has integrated implications for the use of inert impurity doping to simultaneously control the physical dimensions and tune the luminescence properties of lanthanide-doped upconversion systems.
Results and discussion, experimental
KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ products were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method by using oleic acid as the capping agent. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) was performed to characterize the morphology of the as-prepared KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ nanoparticles at various Gd3+ concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1A, KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ nanoparticles are cubic in shape with a smooth surface, and the average size is about 250 ± 20 nm. By elevating the Gd3+ doping concentration from 0 to 25 mol%, the size of the nanoparticles increases to 330 ± 20 nm (shown in Fig. 1A–F), which may arouse from the embedding of large-size Gd3+ (0.94 Å) ions into the KMnF3 lattice for substituting the small Mn2+ (0.81 Å) ions.32 Along with the size increase, the morphology also changes from cube to polyhedron, implying the successful embedding of Gd3+ ions into the KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ lattice.
 Fig. 1  FESEM images of KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ with different amounts of Gd3+ dopants: (A) 0%, (B) 5%, (C) 10%, (D) 15%, (E) 20%, and (F) 25%. The insets shown in (A and F) are the corresponding structures of oleic acid capped KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ doped with 0% and 25% Gd3+ ions. 
The crystallographic phases of the as-prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the results are shown in Fig. 2A. The diffraction peaks at 21.18, 30.15, 37.14, 43.12, 48.54, 53.51 and 62.67 can be indexed to the planes (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211) and (220), respectively, demonstrating that the KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ nanoparticles agree well with the standard JCPDS 17-0116 cubic phase KMnF3. In addition, XRD measurements confirm that the cubic KMnF3 structure is retained as the Gd3+ doping concentration reaches as high as 15 mol%. When the Gd3+ content exceeds 20 mol%, obvious extra (111), (200), and (220) diffraction peaks at 27.10, 31.21, and 44.72 of GdF3 appeared (Fig. S1, ESI†). This further demonstrates that the appeared small particles in Fig. 1E and F are GdF3, which agrees well with the SEM results in Fig. 1. This conclusion is also supported by the EDS spectra of KMnF3:10%Yb3+/2%Er3+ nanoparticles co-doped with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mol% Gd3+ ions. The signals of Mn, F, K and Yb are presented when the doping content of Gd3+ ions is low. The co-existence of Mn, K, F, Yb and Gd signals was obviously detected within the highly doped nanoparticles, confirming the successful introduction of Gd3+ ions into the KMnF3 host lattice. In particular, the gradually increased signal ratio of Gd/Mn indicates a substitution of Mn2+ ions with Gd3+ ions in the KMnF3 lattice.

The present process proceeds through nucleation and growth steps as shown in Scheme 1. At the initial stage of nucleation, OA as the stabilizing agent is introduced into the reaction system for forming complexes with Mn2+ and Ln3+ (Yb3+, Gd3+, and Er3+) ions through strong coordination interactions. Through hydrothermal treatment with the reaction conditions of high temperature and pressure, the chelating abilities of the Mn2+-OA and Ln3+-OA complex are weakened. Subsequently, the Mn2+ and Ln3+ ions are released gradually. All ions including Mn2+, Ln3+, K+ and F− ions react simultaneously to produce KMnF3:Yb3+/Er3+/Gd3+ nucleation seeds due to the strong interactions between cations and F− anions. In the growth step, OA still adsorbs on the surfaces of nucleation with the alkyl chains left outside, controlling the growth of nanoparticles.33,34 And the presence of a certain amount of oleic acid on the surface of cubic nanoparticles is identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis (see Fig. S2, ESI†). As can be seen, when the Gd3+ content is lower than 20 mol%, the resulting products grow into cubic KMnF3:Yb3+/Er3+/Gd3+ nanoparticles. However, the KMnF3:Yb3+/Er3+/Gd3+ nanoparticles incline to form a polyhedron while the concentration of Gd3+ ions is higher (≥20%), because excessive implantation of larger Gd3+ ions into the KMnF3 lattice induces an obvious expansion of the cell volume. It is worth noting that smaller GdF3 nucleation seeds are also generated due to the introduction of superfluous Gd3+ ions.

To reveal the importance of Gd3+ ion doping concentration for tuning multicolor UC luminescence, the UC emission spectra of KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+ nanoparticles with different Gd3+ contents are acquired under continuous excitation of a NIR 980 nm laser. The UC emitting spectrum of the KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+ sample shows a single red emission band centered at 660 nm, which is attributed to the 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions, as shown in Fig. 3A. The pure single red emission in the KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+ system originates from the energy transfer between the doped Er3+ and host Mn2+ ions.23 Interestingly, when the concentration of Gd3+ increased from 0% to 25%, the intensity of the red emission band decreases and the intensity of the green emission that originated from 2H11/2/4S3/2 to 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions enhances gradually. The emission color of the as-prepared nanoparticles shows a continuous evolution from red to green in Fig. 3B. This is further supported by the integrated emission intensity ratio of green and red emission bands in Fig. 3C. The calculated chromaticity coordinates are shown in Fig. 3D to elaborate the grand evolution of the UC fluorescence color, revealing a similar trend to the photographic observation. The corresponding chromaticity coordinates (x, y) in the CIE 1931 color space change from (0.6621, 0.2847) to (0.3332, 0.6211) with the increase of the Gd3+ ion concentration from 0% to 25% (shown in Table S1, ESI†). These results demonstrate the advantage of the Gd3+ doping KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+ system for producing a tunable UC output.

To further verify the multicolor control mechanism of Gd3+ doping, one control experiment with Gd3+ ions replaced by much smaller Y3+ ions is implemented. In order to obtain an accurate comparison, the doping concentrations of Y3+ ions are set to exactly equate with that of Gd3+ ions. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the Y3+ doping content dependent UC emission spectra of the KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+/(0–25%)Y3+ nanoparticles. It is found that the red emission band centered at 660 nm decreases slightly with the increase of the Y3+ concentration from 0% to 25%, while the green emission peak located at 540 nm enhances gradually. It is worth noting that the final green fluorescence intensity is still inferior to that of the red one. The green/red (G/R) ratio of the KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+/(0–25%)Y3+ nanoparticles changes from 0 to 0.47, confirming that the replacement of the Mn2+ host ions by inactive Y3+ ions also plays a role in the adjustment of the UC emission color to some extent. It is worth noting that, however, the tuning function caused by inactive Y3+ ions is much weaker than that of Gd3+ ions, demonstrating the more powerful multicolor tuning ability of Gd3+ ions in the KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+ system. To explain the realization of Gd3+ ion dopant-tuned multicolor UC emission, Rietveld refinement of the diffraction patterns using the Fullpro analysis software is shown in Fig. 4A and Table S2 (ESI†). With the increase of the Gd3+ ion doping concentration, the cell volume changes gradually from 73.44 Å3 to 73.58 Å3 (Fig. 4B), leading to the prolonged energy transfer distance between Mn2+ and Er3+ ions. Meanwhile, the lifetimes decrease from 174 μs to 57 μs, which indicates the blocking of the energy back transfer from Mn2+ (T1) to Er3+ (4F9/2) (Fig. S4, ESI†). Thus, possible UC mechanisms in KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+/Gd3+ nanoparticles can be proposed in Fig. 4C. As shown in the left part of Fig. 4C, the Yb3+ ions act as sensitizers for NIR photon absorption of the 980 nm laser, resonantly excite Yb3+ ions from the ground state 2F7/2 to its excited state 2F5/2. The energy transfer process from the excited Yb3+ ions to the adjacent Er3+ ions can populate its 4I11/2 state. The continuously absorbed photons would persistently transfer to Er3+, promoting the Er3+ ions at the high energy level of 4F7/2. Multi-phonon assisted relaxations from the 4F7/2 state can then populate the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels. Due to the unique KMnF3 matrix favoring efficient energy exchanging transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+ ions, the excited electrons at 4F7/2 and 2H11/2 states of Er3+ can transfer their energy to the 4T1 level of the neighboring Mn2+ ions. Once the 4T1 level is populated, the excited electron would tend to transfer the energy back to the 4F9/2 state of Er3+ ions. The single red emission at 660 nm can be produced by the radiative decay to the ground state from the 4F9/2 state. However, with the successful introduction of Gd3+ ions, two important tuning functions are activated in the KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+/Gd3+ system. (i) The weakened Mn2+ energy exchanging transfer function arise from the partial substitution of Mn2+ ions by Gd3+ ions in the host lattice, leading to low red emission efficiency. (ii) The enlarged crystal cell size and alternate local crystal structure would also confine the interaction between Er3+ and Mn2+ ions. As a result, the energy exchanging transfer process and the population upon 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 4F9/2 can precisely be controlled by varying the Gd3+ ion doping amount, thus achieving multi-color UC emission adjustment from red to green.

Conclusions
In summary, Yb3+/Er3+codoped cubic KMnF3 nanoparticles are successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route. Furthermore, the KMnF3:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles can be manipulated simply from cube to polyhedron through varying the content of Gd3+ dopants in the range of 0–25%, implying the controllable localized crystal structure of KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+/Gd3+ nanoparticles. The Rietveld refinement of the diffraction patterns indicated the cell volume expansion from 73.44 Å3 to 73.58 Å3, strongly confirming the engineering function of Gd3+ doping to the local crystal structure of the host matrix. As a result, tunable multicolor UC luminescence from red to green was observed in KMnF3:10Yb3+/2Er3+/Gd3+ nanoparticles with the variation of Gd3+ doping concentration under single-wavelength excitation at 980 nm. It is worth noting that the changed local crystal structure and the energy exchanging transfer process between Mn2+ and Er3+ ions within KMnF3 nanoparticles are found to be dominant UC pathways for tuning emission colors. This strategy shows great potential for implementing simultaneous control of the physical dimensions as well as the UC luminescence properties of lanthanide-doped upconversion systems.
