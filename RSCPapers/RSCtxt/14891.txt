    , Accepted 6th December 2022First published on 6th December 2022AbstractPhotocatalytic H2O2 production from H2O and O2 is a green technology, but the available photocatalysts are limited, due to multi-step charge transfer-originated recombination. In this work, Bi6S2O15 (BSO) photocatalysts exposed with (110), (400), and (−130) surfaces, respectively, are newly studied to produce H2O2 from only H2O and O2. The crystal surface-dependent internal electric field (IEF) is found to strongly inhibit the rapid charge recombination by generating high charge density at the surface and decreasing the electrostatic potential energy. In particular, BSO with the (110) surface exposed exhibits the highest H2O2 production activity (3.4 mM h−1 g−1) under Xe lamp irradiation due to the strongest IEF. The effectiveness of IEF control on H2O2 production gives guidelines for developing more efficient photocatalysts in the future.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant that is widely used in environmental purification and organic synthesis and also as a sustainable energy carrier in fuel cells.1,2 In recent years, photocatalytic H2O2 production has received extensive attention, because the technology uses only H2O and O2 as the raw materials and sunlight as the energy supply.3 However, the reaction is an endergonic reaction (ΔG > 0) that cannot proceed spontaneously. Many reported photocatalysts need sacrificial reagents to achieve high activity, while the method may result in impure H2O2 production and increase the cost. As a consequence, highly efficient H2O2 production from only H2O and O2 remains a challenge.
Up to now, some organic photocatalysts and Bi-based salts have been developed for non-sacrificial H2O2 production, such as g-C3N4, RF resins, GO, BiPO4, and BiVO4.4–8 H2O2 is produced using these photocatalysts from either O2 reduction via a two-step one-electron transfer or from water oxidation via a multiple-hole transfer reaction. Simultaneous multi-step charge transfer of both electrons and holes are often required for the reaction, which will cause severe charge recombination.9 Therefore, the enhancement of the charge separation and transfer provides a key solution for developing highly efficient H2O2-production photocatalysts.
To achieve efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer in photocatalysts, various strategies, such as loading noble metals as cocatalysts, introducing foreign ions, and combining with π-conjugated materials, have been established.10–12 Among them, internal electric field (IEF) construction is a recent method that can efficiently promote charge separation and transfer. The IEF separates the positive charge center and negative charge center in the photocatalysts spatially, which will strongly inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.13,14 Moreover, the method can also be combined with the above-mentioned methods to further enhance the charge separation and transfer.
Crystal facet engineering is an effective method to enhance the IEF.15,16 The effect of regulating the IEF on photocatalysts with different exposed planes for photocatalytic activity has been studied, and mainly used for water oxidation, pollutant degradation, and CO2 reduction.14,17,18 For example, in PDI photocatalysts, photogenerated electrons and holes have been demonstrated to spatially separate on π-conjugated planes and π-stacked planes, respectively, because the different exposed surfaces with different charge densities cause a strong IEF in the crystal.17 On applying the crystal facet engineering to the H2O2 production photocatalysts, the formed IEF would solve the rapid charge recombination originating from the multi-step charge transfer of both electrons and holes during the H2O2 production reaction. However, few studies have been reported on the regulation of different exposed crystal planes to construct a strong IEF for H2O2 production.
BiPO4, has recently been discovered by our group to achieve efficient non-sacrificial H2O2 production because of its appropriate band edge potentials and stable chemical compositions.7 However, the BiPO4 photocatalyst only responds to UV-254 nm light due to its wide bandgap (ca. 3.9 eV). The Bi6S2O15 (BSO) photocatalyst, also developed by our group, exhibits an onset absorption wavelength near 400 nm, indicating that it responds partially to the solar spectrum.19,20 Previous studies show that both BiPO4 and BSO exhibit many similarities: high photocatalytic degradation activity due to their oxyacid cations with strong negative charges in the structure. It is worthwhile to evaluate crystal facet-engineered BSO with a wider sunlight absorption as a suitable photocatalyst for H2O2 production.
In this work, we reported for the first time, a BSO photocatalyst with suitable crystal facet engineering that enables photocatalytic H2O2 production from only H2O and O2. The BSO photocatalysts with different morphologies exposed to different crystal planes were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method to induce a strong IEF. The H2O2 production rate, under Xe lamp irradiation for 5 h, on the (110) surface exposed on BSO-110 (3.4 mM h−1 g−1) was three and two times that of on the (−130) surface exposed on BSO-30 (1.0 mM h−1 g−1) and on the (400) surface exposed on BSO-400 (1.7 mM h−1 g−1), respectively. The strong IEF originating from the (110) planes exposed on BSO-110 resulted in excellent H2O2 production activity relative to the (−130) planes exposed on BSO-30 and the (400) planes exposed on BSO-400. Thus, establishing a strong IEF through crystal face engineering effectively promotes the activity of H2O2 production.
2. Experimental section
All chemicals in the experiment were purchased from the National Chemical Company and used without further purification. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used in all the following experiments.
2.1 The crystal surface regulation of BSO photocatalysts
Bi6S2O15 (denoted as BSO) photocatalysts with different exposed planes were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal process. Typically, 1 mmol Na2SO4 and 3 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were added in a beaker containing 30 mL ultrapure H2O. The pH of the mixed solution was adjusted to 9.0 by dropwise addition of diluted NH3·H2O solution. Then, the solution was stirred vigorously for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Subsequently, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL para-polyphenol-sealed stainless-steel autoclave and kept at given temperatures (120 °C, 180 °C, and 240 °C) for 24 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was naturally cooled down to room temperature, and the white precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times, respectively, and dried at 80 °C overnight. According to the HRTEM image in Fig. 1, the exposed crystal faces on the BSO photocatalysts prepared at 120 °C, 180 °C, and 240 °C are the (−130) faces, (110) faces, and (400) faces, respectively, and they were named BSO-30, BSO-110, and BSO-400, respectively.

Fig. 1a, d and g insets show the concurrent crystal surface schematics. 
2.2 Characterization of Bi6S2O15
The morphology of all BSO photocatalysts was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100plus, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The surface potentials of BSO photocatalysts with different exposed planes were measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon, German) equipped with a Kelvin probe. The hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical were tested in the dark and under light with Xe lamp irradiation for 10 min by using an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Bruker EMXplus, German) spectrometer. The transient fluorescence properties of all materials were studied via a photoluminescence spectrometer (PL, FS5, Edinburgh, UK). Surface photovoltage was measured using a surface photovoltage spectrometer (SPV, SPS1000, China) equipped with an arc lamp as the power supply.
2.3 Photocatalytic H2O2 production
Photocatalytic H2O2 production was performed in a 100 mL beaker. In detail, 25 mg of BSO was dispersed in 50 mL of H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 4.0 using HCl solution, or in 50 mL of H2O containing 10 vol% HCOOH as a sacrificial reagent. High purity oxygen (>99.999%) was bubbled into the solution at a flow rate of 200 mL min−1 for 30 min to reach oxygen saturation, and then oxygen bubbling was maintained at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 to maintain an oxygen-enriched environment in the reaction. A 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 300 nm) or 18 W UV-254 nm lamp was used as the light source. The temperature of all experimental reactions was kept at 25 °C with cooling water in all cases. The H2O2 concentration was determined by the potassium titanium oxalate method as reported.21 In detail, 1 mL of solution was taken out with a syringe topped with a 0.45 μm filter at certain intervals. Then, the solution was mixed with 1 mL of 0.02 M potassium titanium oxalate solution. The transparent solution quickly turned yellow due to the formation of Ti peroxide by H2O2 and potassium titanium(IV) oxalate. The H2O2 concentration was determined using a UV-Vis spectrometer at an absorbance of 400 nm (UV-9010, Pushi Inc., Beijing, China).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical test
The Mott–Schottky, LSV, and EIS curves of all materials were recorded using a CHI 750E (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) electrochemical workstation. A three-electrode system was used in the test with an FTO/photocatalyst as the working electrode, a Pt net as the counter electrode, and a standard Ag/AgCl electrode (E = 0.210 V vs. NHE) as the reference electrode. During the test, 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte and a 300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source. For the FTO/photocatalyst electrode, a certain amount of photocatalyst slurry was evenly coated on FTO. In detail, 3 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 μL of ethanol solution to form a homogeneous slurry by sonication. Then, the slurry was evenly dropped onto the resistive side of the FTO glass (1 cm × 1.5 cm) and naturally allowed to dry overnight to evaporate all the ethanol. The thickness of the photocatalyst on the FTO glass was estimated to be around 150 μm.
2.5 Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements
The RDE measurements were performed on a rotating ring disk electrode instrument (RRDE-3A, Japan) with a three electrode-system using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode.22,23 The working electrode was prepared in the following manner: 50 mg of BSO photocatalyst was dispersed in 2 mL of EtOH containing 50 μL of Nafion to form a slurry by sonication. Then, the 20 μL slurry was put onto a GC disk electrode and dried at room temperature.
The LSV curves were obtained in an O2-saturated 0.1 M PBS solution (pH = 7) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 after O2 (>99.999%) bubbling for 5 min. The average number of electrons (n) involved in the overall O2 reduction was determined using the slopes of the Koutecky–Levich plots with the following equations:22 j−1 = jk−1 + B−1ω−1/2(1) B = 0.2nFν−1/6CD2/3(2)where j is the current density, jk is the kinetic current density, ω is the rotating speed (rpm), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), ν is the kinetic viscosity of water (0.01 cm2 s−1), C is the bulk concentration of O2 in water (1.26 × 10−6 mol cm−3), and D is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (2.70 × 10−5 cm2 s−1), respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Exposed surface control on Bi6S2O15 photocatalysts
The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1 show the morphology of Bi6S2O15 (BSO) photocatalysts hydrothermally prepared at 120 °C, 180 °C, and 240 °C, respectively. At 120 °C, BSO exhibits a particle structure (Fig. 1a and b) with a diameter of 16 ± 3 nm (Fig. S1a†). The BSO particles are nearly monodisperse under TEM, probably because the material has the most negative zeta potential (Table S1†) to increase electrostatic repulsion between individual particles, as reported.24
At 180 °C, BSO exhibits a nanorod structure (Fig. 1d and e). No particles are observed, indicating that all the particles are completely converted into nanorods at 180 °C. The diameter of nanorods is measured to be 95 ± 38 nm and the length is 1.6 ± 0.8 μm (Fig. S1b and c†). The diameter of the nanorod is around 6 times as large as that of the nanoparticle suggesting that the nanorod may form from the agglomeration of the particle. The agglomerated particles tend to fuse together to decrease the surface energy via the increase of the dissolving-precipitation process of Bi3+ at elevated temperatures as reported for the Bi2O3 solubility in the literature.25 The TEM image of the intermediate step (obtained at 150 °C) for the formation of nanorods supports the conclusion as shown in Fig. S2.† A similar phenomenon in which the agglomerated particles tend to fuse together to form nanorods is reported for CuGaS2 nanorod formation in the literature.26
BSO prepared at 240 °C shows a layered structure (Fig. 1g and h) with a size larger than 1 × 1 μm and a thickness of 9.5 ± 1.2 nm (Fig. S3†). The possible formation is due to cross stacking of the tiny nanorod-like grains (diameter 5.7 ± 1.5 nm) in the initial steps (Fig. S4a†), a similar phenomenon to that reported for 0.65(PbMg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.35PbTiO3 (PMN–PT) synthesis in the literature.27 The TEM image of the intermediate step (obtained at 200 °C) shows the formation of sheets and supports the conclusion of cross stacking (Fig. S4b†).
Different morphologies of BSO samples have different exposed crystal planes. Fig. 1c shows BSO with a particle structure exposing lattice distances of 0.298 nm and 0.265 nm, corresponding to the (002) and (431) planes of the BSO lattice, respectively. The intersection angle between the (002) and (431) planes is 62°, which is consistent with the result of the schematic diagram in Fig. S5a.† The exposed planes of BSO nanoparticles are found to be the (−130) planes by a geometric relationship as shown in Fig. S5b,† in which the (002) plane and (−130) plane are perpendicular to each other, and the (431) plane and the (−130) plane are also perpendicular to each other. The BSO particle with the (−130) planes exposed is named BSO-30.

Fig. 1f shows the BSO sample with a nanorod structure exhibiting a lattice distance of 1.030 nm, corresponding to the (110) planes on the BSO crystal, indicating that the lateral exposed planes are the (110) planes,19 and it is named BSO-110.
Similarly, a lattice distance of 0.305 nm is found on the BSO nanosheet in Fig. 1i, corresponding to the (400) planes. Since the lattice distance is obtained from the curling edge of the nanosheet, the exposed planes are found to be the (400) planes, and it is named BSO-400.
XRD patterns in Fig. S6† show the crystal structure of the BSO samples prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures. Three patterns are normalized with the strongest diffraction peak located at 28.2°. All three samples show the XRD peaks corresponding to a standard BSO pattern reported in the literature,28 but with different crystallinity. No extra diffraction peaks or impurities are observed in the XRD patterns, suggesting that the prepared BSO samples are a pure phase. The (400) plane of BSO-400 is clearly stronger than that of the other two samples, confirming the stacking planes observed in the TEM image in Fig. 1h.
UV-Vis DRS spectra in Fig. S7† show the absorption band edge of BSO photocatalysts hydrothermally prepared at 120 °C, 180 °C, and 240 °C, respectively. The prepared BSO-30 photocatalyst exhibits an absorption band edge of around 340 nm, while BSO-110 and BSO-400 photocatalysts exhibit absorption band edges of 354 nm and 360 nm, respectively. BSO-30 exhibits a blue shift relative to BSO-110 and BSO-400, which may arise from the strong quantum confinement effect of the charge carriers on smaller size BSO-30 as reported.29,30 Moreover, the BSO-110 and BSO-400 photocatalysts have similar absorption band edges, indicating that the effect of the light adsorption difference on the photocatalytic activity of the two samples can be ignored.
Raman spectra in Fig. S8† show the lattice vibration of the three samples. The vibrational modes observed below 150 cm−1, between 150 and 400 cm−1, and above 400 cm−1, that is, 425, 441, and 478 cm−1, and 578, 609, and 628 cm−1, can be assigned to Bi atoms, Bi and O atoms, and the v2(E) bending mode and v4(T2) vibrational modes of SO42−.19,31,32 The relative intensities of Bi–O in [BiO6] octahedra located at 151, 185, 222, and 315 cm−1 change obviously with increasing hydrothermal temperature. Taking the Raman peak ratio between peak A (Bi–O A1g at 151 cm−1) and peak B (SO42− v2(E) at 441 cm−1) as an example (the tendency of the other Bi–O Raman peaks are similar), the intensity ratio of IA/IB changes in the following order: BSO-110 (9.8) > BSO-400 (8.4) > BSO-30 (6.4). BSO-110 exhibits a much stronger Bi–O Raman peak than the other two samples, which may be due to the presence of more distorted [BiO3] and [BiO6] polyhedra on the (110) surfaces relative to the [SO4] tetrahedron (Fig. S9†). The large distortion of the [BiO6] octahedron with exposed (110) surfaces may increase the lattice dipole of the sample and contribute to the internal electric field, and thus benefit the charge separation and transfer that enhances the photocatalytic activity as discussed below. Similar Raman results have been reported for γ-Bi2MoO6 samples with different morphologies.33
3.2 Strong internal electric field induced by exposing suitable surfaces on Bi6S2O15
The different exposed surfaces will lead to a change in the internal electric field (IEF), which may influence the charge separation and transfer and photocatalytic activity as reported.34 The IEF is proportional to the square root of the product of surface potential and surface charge density (eqn (S3)†).17,34 Surface potential can be measured by the KPFM measurement, while surface charge density is proportional to the zeta potential. Fig. 2a–c show the ranking of surface potentials of BSO with three exposed planes in the following order: BSO-110 (37.39 mV) > BSO-400 (26.68 mV) > BSO-30 (11.95 mV). The (110) planes exposed on BSO-110 exhibit the highest surface potential compared to those of the (−130) planes exposed on BSO-30 and the (400) planes exposed on BSO-400. Zeta potentials of the three exposed planes are shown in Table S1† and they change in the order below: BSO-30 (−39.02 mV) > BSO-110 (−33.01 mV) > BSO-400 (−26.01 mV). The calculated IEF based on eqn (S3)† for BSO is shown in Fig. 2d, where the IEF on BSO-110 with the (110) planes exposed is 2.65 and 1.78 times higher than those on BSO-30 with the (−130) planes exposed and on BSO-400 with the (400) planes exposed, respectively.
 Fig. 2  Surface potential of BSO with different exposed surfaces. (a) KPFM measurements of the (30) surfaces exposed on BSO-30, (b) KPFM measurements of the (110) surfaces exposed on BSO-110, and (c) KPFM measurements of the (400) surfaces exposed on BSO-400. (d) Internal electric field of different exposed surfaces (assuming that the intensity of the internal electric field in BSO-30 is “1”). 
The IEF can also be estimated from the product of the photo-generated charge density and surface voltage.34 The photo-generated charge density and surface voltage can be measured from transient photocurrent and open circuit potential (OCP) as shown in Fig. S10.† Photo-generated charge density of the three exposed planes is shown in Fig. S10a–c† and the trend is as follows: BSO-110 (0.77 μC cm−2) > BSO-400 (0.58 μC cm−2) > BSO-30 (0.33 μC cm−2). The surface voltage of the three exposed planes in Fig. S10d† exhibits the same tendency as photo-generated charge density: BSO-110 (18.85 mV) > BSO-400 (9.48 mV) > BSO-30 (6.41 mV). According to the calculated results as shown in Fig. S11,† the IEF on BSO-110 with the (110) planes exposed is 6.86 and 2.64 times higher than those on BSO-30 with the (−130) planes exposed and on BSO-400 with the (400) planes exposed, respectively.
Both the above two methods show that BSO-110 exhibits the highest IEF, while BSO-30 exhibits the lowest IEF. The highest IEF of BSO-110 is considered to originate from the charge density on the planes, which has been reported before,35–37 and detailed in Section 3.4.
3.3 Strong surface-derived IEF enhancing the H2O2 production activity on the Bi6S2O15 photocatalyst
H2O2 production on the three prepared BSO photocatalysts was investigated to clarify the influence of the crystal surface-dependent IEF on the activity. Fig. 3a shows the H2O2 production on the three prepared BSO photocatalysts from pure H2O and O2 under Xe lamp irradiation. The BSO-110 photocatalyst exhibits the highest H2O2 production activity among the three BSO photocatalysts: 180 μM H2O2 on the BSO-110 photocatalyst within 5 h irradiation, while 60 μM and 90 μM H2O2 on the BSO-30 and BSO-400 photocatalysts, respectively. The specific H2O2 production rate on BSO-110 is 3.4 mM h−1 g−1, which is higher than that on BSO-400 (1.7 mM h−1 g−1) and BSO-30 (1.0 mM h−1 g−1).
 Fig. 3  H2O2 production on the three prepared BSO photocatalysts. (a) Time-dependent H2O2 production curves. Reaction conditions: 25 mg of cat., 50 mL of H2O (pH = 4.0), 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 300 nm). (b) H2O2 production after 5 h irradiation with and without sacrificial regents. Reaction conditions: 25 mg of cat., 50 mL of H2O (pH = 4.0) or 50 mL of 10 vol% HCOOH aq., 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 300 nm). (c) EPR measurements for hydroxide and superoxide radicals for the BSO-110 photocatalyst during the H2O2 production. (d) Calculated band edge potentials for BSO-110. The stability of H2O2 production on (e) BSO-110 and (f) HBIP@BSO-110. Reaction conditions: 50 mg of cat., 100 mL of H2O (pH = 4.0), 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 300 nm). 
Next Fig. 3b and S12a† compare the H2O2 production on the three prepared BSO photocatalysts with different light sources (Xe lamp and a UV-254 nm lamp) and with or without sacrificial reagents. First, the influence of the light source on non-sacrificial H2O2 production on BSO with different IEFs is studied. Under UV-254 nm lamp light irradiation, the H2O2 concentration on the BSO-110 photocatalyst is approximately 280 μM from pure H2O, while around 130 μM and 180 μM H2O2 are produced on the BSO-30 and BSO-400 photocatalysts, respectively. The AQY of BSO-110 under 254 ± 10 nm is measured to be 1.89% in H2O. The pH of reaction solution is set to 4.0 by optimizing the experimental conditions as shown in Fig. S12b.† Though H2O2 accumulation on BSO photocatalysts increases 1.5–2 times under UV light irradiation due to a stronger input photon energy, the three samples exhibit a similar activity sequence relative to Xe lamp irradiation. The activity difference between the three samples is mainly influenced by the IEF rather than the excitation energy, indicating that the IEF may affect the intrinsic properties that govern the H2O2 production, such as charge separation and transfer.
The H2O2 accumulation on the three prepared BSO photocatalysts is further evaluated by adding HCOOH as a sacrificial reagent. The optimized HCOOH concentration is 10 vol% as shown in Fig. S13.† Under 5 h Xe lamp irradiation BSO-110 produces 5.1 mM H2O2, while BSO-400 and BSO-30 photocatalysts produce 4.2 mM and 3.4 mM H2O2, respectively. The BSO-110 photocatalyst also exhibits the highest H2O2 production activity among the three as-prepared BSO photocatalysts. Under UV light irradiation, the H2O2 accumulation on BSO photocatalysts is enhanced 3–3.6 times relative to that under the Xe lamp, but also with the same activity sequence. Note that the activity difference with sacrificial reagents between the BSO samples with the highest activity and lowest one is ca. 1.5, only half relative to those without sacrificial reagents. The decrease of the activity difference is probably due to the assistance of HCOOH in charge separation and transfer.38 The existence of HCOOH may help the charge separation and transfer, resulting in a small difference, while for pure water the IEF governs the H2O2 production process. Since the IEF for BSO-110 is 2.65 times higher than that for BSO-30, the activity may be largely different. It is well known that the H2O2 production from H2O is a greener reaction relative to that with sacrificial reagents. Therefore, the finding on the relationship between the IEF and the activity is more important to develop environmentally friendly H2O2 production.
Table S2† compares the H2O2 production performance of BSO-110 with other Bi-based and typical inorganic photocatalysts in the presence of H2O and O2. The result clearly shows that the prepared BSO-110 photocatalyst exhibits both the highest H2O2 production rate (80 μM h−1) and accumulation amount (180 μM) among all the inorganic photocatalysts without doping or combination under Xe lamp irradiation. Also, in the presence of organic sacrificial reagents, the BSO-110 photocatalyst exhibits both the highest H2O2 production rate (2.0 mM h−1) and accumulation amount (5.1 mM) under Xe lamp irradiation among all the inorganic photocatalysts without doping or combination as shown in Table S3.† The excellent photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production on the BSO-110 photocatalyst may be due to the strong IEF of the (110) surface, which will inhibit the fast charge recombination of the multi-step charge transfer of electrons and holes, as detailed in Section 3.4.
The EPR results of BSO-110 with the highest activity in Fig. 3c show the intermediates during H2O2 production. The EPR signals of superoxide radicals are observed after 10 min photoirradiation, indicating that part of H2O2 is produced from superoxide radicals. For hydroxide radical detection, strong sulfate radical signals and weak hydroxide signals are observed in the profile. This indicates that the H2O2 production by holes may be via sulfate radical intermediates. It is well known that sulfate radicals can convert into hydroxide radicals and the rate strongly depends on the pH as reported for the conversion of sulfate radicals in the literature.39 Thus at a suitable pH, the conversion of sulfate radicals to hydroxide radicals is accelerated and the H2O2 production rate is enhanced.
The XPS valence state spectrum, Mott–Schottky curves, and Tauc plot in Fig. S14† are used to determine the band edge potentials of the BSO-110 photocatalyst. According to the valence state spectrum, the valence band edge is 2.40 V relative to the Femi energy level, while the Femi energy level is ca. −0.60 V vs. NHE determined using the Mott–Schottky curve. The valence band edge is therefore 1.80 V vs. NHE. The bandgap of BSO-110 is 3.40 eV from the Tauc plot. Therefore, the band potentials of BSO-110 are determined to be 1.80 V and −1.60 V for the valence band edge and the conduction band edge, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3d. Since the potential requirements for H2O oxidation and O2 reduction are 1.78 V vs. NHE and 0.68 V vs. NHE, respectively,9 the conduction band potentials of BSO-110 meet the potential requirements for H2O2 production, while the valence band edge is not large enough to facilitate direct conversion of H2O to H2O2. Therefore, the H2O2 production by holes is via a sulfate radical to hydroxide radical conversion pathway as observed from the EPR results.
The stability of H2O2 production on the BSO-110 photocatalyst with the highest activity is further evaluated as shown in Fig. 3e. The amount of H2O2 production decreases to less than a half after three cycles. The decrease may be due to the break of the crystal structure originating from the side reaction between produced H2O2 and sulfate radicals formed during the H2O2 production reaction. H2O2 and sulfate radicals can produce SO42− as reported.40,41 To avoid the collapse of the structure, we employ a hexagonal BiPO4 (HBIP) coating method to improve the stability and activity of BSO-110 as shown in Fig. S15.† After coating with HBIP, the H2O2 production on the HBIP@BSO-110 photocatalyst not only increases by 1.6 times (280 μM H2O2) after 5 h irradiation under a Xe lamp, but remains stable in the three cycles, as shown in Fig. 3f. The HBIP coating can accelerate the diffusion of produced H2O2 into the solution and avoid its re-contact with the BSO surface via the steric hindrance effect as studied in our previous work.7 The reported7 effect of the HBIP coating works for monoclinic BiPO4 (nMBIP), a UV-active photocatalyst mainly absorbing below 300 nm, while the H2O2 production from H2O and O2 on the HBIP@nMBIP photocatalyst has negligible activity under Xe lamp irradiation. Here, coating HBIP also improves the stability and production activity of H2O2 on HBIP@BSO-110 under Xe lamp irradiation absorbing above 300 nm, indicating that the effect of the HBIP coating to avoid the H2O2 overreaction is not influenced by the light source.
3.4 Efficient charge separation and transfer due to the high IEF in BSO benefitting H2O2 production
The number of transferred electrons on the BSO photocatalysts with different IEFs for H2O2 production is calculated by linear sweep voltammetry with a RDE electrode as shown in Fig. 4. The linear sweep curves in Fig. 4a–c are measured on a rotating disk electrode in an O2-saturated 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution under different rotating speeds.22 Obvious O2 reduction signals are observed in these plots, indicating that the electrons are transferred during H2O2 production on BSO with different exposed surfaces. The Koutecky–Levich diagram of the data in Fig. 4d is obtained at a constant electrode potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The slope of the diagram obtained by linear regression is used to estimate the average number of electrons (n) participating in overall O2 reduction, according to the literature.22 The n value is determined to be 1.04 on BSO-110, and 1.33 and 1.64 on BSO-30, and BSO-400, respectively, indicating that mainly a one-electron O2 reduction process (n = 1) occurs on the BSO photocatalysts. Combined with the previously mentioned EPR result in Fig. 3c, the pathway of H2O2 production on the prepared BSO photocatalysts is the two-step one-electron O2 reduction process (e− + O2 → ˙O2−E = −0.33 V, ˙O2− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2E = 1.44 V) as reported in the literature.2 The number of electrons transferred on BSO-110 is closer to 1 relative to BSO-30 and BSO-400, indicating that the charge separation and transfer on BSO-110 will be more efficient than on BSO-30 and BSO-400 under a stronger IEF. In previous studies, the electron transfer number of O2 reduction to H2O2 on the formaldehyde-treated g-C3N4 (n = 2.56) is closer to the theoretical electron number of 2 compared to that on pristine g-C3N4 (n = 3.38), indicating the superior kinetic selectivity of formaldehyde-treated g-C3N4 for the reduction of O2 to H2O2.42 The stronger IEF on BSO-110 is more favourable for the two-step one-electron process, thus ensuring the continuous generation of H2O2.

The influence of IEF derived from the different exposed planes of the three samples on the charge separation and transfer is further elucidated using transient PL spectra and photoelectrochemical measurements. The transient PL spectra in Fig. 5a and the average decay lifetime in Table S4† show the effect of exposed planes on charge separation and transfer. The decay order of the photogenerated carrier in BSO photocatalysts is as follows: BSO-110 (3.81 ns) > BSO-400 (2.79 ns) > BSO-30 (1.55 ns). Apparently, the BSO-110 photocatalyst shows the longest decay time among the three catalysts, revealing that the (110) planes exposed on BSO-110 are more efficient for charge separation and transfer relative to the (400) planes exposed on BSO-400 and the (−130) planes exposed on BSO-30.
 Fig. 5  Transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra (a), surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra (b), i–t plots (c), and the electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra and fitting plots (d) of the three prepared BSO photocatalysts. 
SPV spectra of BSO with different exposed planes are shown in Fig. 5b. SPV is caused by the surface charge concentration originating from the surface-transfer of photogenerated carriers as reported.43,44 The (110) planes exposed on BSO-110 exhibit the highest intensity (6.12 μV) compared to the (400) planes exposed on BSO-400 (4.21 μV) and the (−130) planes exposed on BSO-30 (1.05 μV). The tendency indicates that the (110) planes exposed on BSO-110 have the highest charge concentration among all the exposed planes, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge.
The efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer can be further reflected by the photocurrent measurement (Fig. 5c).8,45 The photocurrent density of BSO-110 is 0.095 μA cm−2, which is 2.2 times higher than that of BSO-30 (0.044 μA cm−2) and 1.3 times higher than that of BSO-400 (0.074 μA cm−2). This indicates that the (110) planes exhibit the highest photogenerated charge separation and transfer efficiency among all the exposed planes obtained.
EIS spectra in Fig. 5d and fitting data in Table S5† show the results of the photogenerated charge transfer resistance for the BSO photocatalysts with different exposed planes. The inset shows the equivalent circuit diagram, in which Rs, Rct, and CPE represent the solution resistance, the charge transfer resistance, and the constant phase element for the electrolyte/electrode interface, respectively. The EIS results agree well with the fitting plots, indicating that the equivalent circuit is suitable for our system. According to the fitting plots, the EIS curves of BSO are all semicircles whose radii are proportional to Rct obtained from the equivalent circuit diagram. BSO-110 exhibits the smallest semicircle radius among the three photocatalysts, which proves that BSO-110 with the strongest IEF is most suitable for charge transfer.
The PL, SPV, and PEC results all suggest that the (110) planes exposed on the photocatalyst with the highest IEF will promote charge separation and transfer, resulting in significant activity enhancement. To further investigate the origins of the IEF with different planes exposed on the charge separation and transfer, the charge density difference and electrostatic potential of the BSO photocatalysts were calculated by DFT as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  (a)–(c) Charge density difference on the (−130), (110), and (400) planes of BSO, and (d)–(f) corresponding crystal planes. (g)–(i) Electrostatic potential in the (−130), (110), and (400) planes. 

Fig. 6a–c show the charge density difference on different exposed planes, and Fig. 6d–f are the corresponding element distribution. The (−130), (110), and (400) planes are the exposed planes on BSO-30, BSO-110, and BSO-400, respectively. Among all the exposed planes obtained, the (110) plane has the highest charge density, while the (−130) plane has the lowest charge density. The large charge density on the (110) plane may be due to the presence of more O element on the crystal plane and increases the potential between planes, which results in a strong electric field.35,46 The (110) planes exhibit the strongest IEF relative to the (−130) planes and the (400) planes, corresponding to the experimental results in Fig. 2. The strong IEF between the (110) crystal planes can promote effectively the continuous transfer of electrons, and ensure the process of two-step one-electron O2 reduction. This result supports our hypothesis that the strong IEF will effectively inhibit the rapid charge recombination originating from the multi-step charge transfer of both electrons and holes during the H2O2 production reaction, and more importantly, drive the two-step one-electron O2 reduction process.
The electrostatic potentials (Fig. 6g–i) are used to evaluate the difficulty level of charge transfer on a given crystal plane as reported in the literature.17 The electrostatic potential energy changes are as follows: (−130) planes (0.022 eV) > (400) planes (0.017 eV) > (110) planes (0.014 eV). The (110) planes exhibit the smallest potential energy among all the exposed planes obtained, indicating that the plane with the strongest IEF exhibits the easiest charge transfer.47

Fig. 7 summarizes the effect of the crystal-surface dependent IEF of the BSO photocatalyst on non-sacrificial H2O2 production. The (110) planes exposed on the BSO nanowires exhibit a higher IEF relative to the (−130) planes exposed on the BSO nanoparticles and the (400) planes exposed on the BSO nanoplates due to a higher surface charge density. The strong IEF effectively inhibits the rapid charge recombination from the multi-step charge transfer of both electrons and holes, thus facilitating the H2O2 production via O2 reduction via a two-step one-electron process and a sulfate radical to hydroxyl radical conversion.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a BSO photocatalyst with suitable crystal facet engineering was found to enable efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production from only H2O and O2 under Xe lamp irradiation. BSO-110 exposing the (110) faces exhibits the highest H2O2 production activity (3.4 mM h−1 g−1) relative to BSO-30 exposing the (−130) faces (1.0 mM h−1 g−1) and BSO-400 exposing the (400) faces (1.7 mM h−1 g−1). The high activity originates from the exposed (110) faces on BSO-110 which exhibits the strongest IEF among all the three faces obtained. The strong IEF will effectively inhibit the rapid charge recombination from the multi-step charge transfer of both electrons and holes during the H2O2 production reaction. This study will provide a feasible strategy for boosting the activity of H2O2 photocatalysts and its versatile combination with other methods will further enhance the charge separation and transfer and open up more possibilities for efficient and eco-friendly H2O2 production.
