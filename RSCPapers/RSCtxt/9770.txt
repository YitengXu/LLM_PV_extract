    , Accepted 21st September 2017First published on 22nd September 2017AbstractThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media was investigated on nanostructured Fe2O3, NiO, and Ni1−xFexO (Fe-doped, rocksalt NiO, x = 0.05–0.19) electrocatalysts deposited via microplasma on indium tin oxide. A detailed investigation of film morphology, structure, and chemical surface state using SEM, XRD, and XPS, respectively, was carried out to understand catalytic activity, which was assessed using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. Iron was seen to be fully incorporated into the parent rocksalt NiO lattice during microplasma deposition, and overpotentials (η) decreased from 360 mV for NiO to 310 mV for Ni1−xFexO at 10 mA cm−2. Interestingly, overpotential did not change significantly for Fe compositions from 5–19%. The Ni1−xFexO films displayed relatively low Tafel slopes of 20–30 mV dec−1 at 0.01–1 mA cm−2, demonstrating their high activity for (OER). Turn-over-frequency (TOF, i.e., O2 molecules per Ni atom per s) at η = 350 mV revealed a continuous improvement in activity of the NiO surface with increasing Fe content, where values of 0.07 and 0.48 s−1 were measured for undoped NiO and Ni0.81Fe0.19O films, respectively. Chronopotentiometry measurements followed by SEM and XPS verified that the as-deposited Ni1−xFexO catalysts were mechanically and chemically stable for OER under alkaline conditions. This work highlights that microplasma-based deposition is a general approach to realize conformal coatings of nanostructured, doped oxides with high activity for OER.
1 Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, into gaseous oxygen and hydrogen (2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)) is currently a hotbed of research for potential clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels.1–3 A major inhibitor to the feasibility of this technology is the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH(aq)− → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) + 4e− in alkaline electrolytes), requiring potentials significantly higher than its thermodynamic value of 1.23 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).4 Current commercial OER catalysts are made from precious metal (oxides), such as IrO2 and RuO2, and require relatively high overpotentials (η > 200 mV) to drive O2 production at 10 mA cm−2.5–7 The high cost and scarcity of these precious metals make it clear that cheaper and more earth-abundant materials with high activity for OER need to be found to realize efficient, large-scale energy production from PEC devices.
To this end, considerable effort has been taken to study first-row transition metal oxides (e.g., Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni-based oxides and (oxy)hydroxides),8–12 which have been shown to have intrinsic activities comparable to and even higher than Ru and Ir-based catalysts when operated in alkaline media. In particular, Ni–Fe oxides and (oxy)hydroxides have consistently demonstrated the highest activities, and consequently, have become the most promising earth-abundant catalysts for OER.13–19 Only recently, it was shown that Fe may be the active center in these catalysts, challenging the pre-existing notion that Fe enhances the activity of Ni (oxy)hydroxides by altering the local structure and electronic properties of the catalytically active Ni sites. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Ni1−xFex(OH)2/Ni1−xFexOOH catalysts by Friebel et al. revealed that the Fe–O bond length is unusually short due to edge sharing with NiO6 octahedra, resulting in lower activation energies for oxygen intermediate formation (i.e., lower overpotential) on Fe sites compared to Ni.20
Comparing the performance of heterogeneous catalysts against different material classes and synthesis techniques has been difficult due to the large variation in electrochemical measurement conditions used among research groups. McCrory et al. have outlined an approach to standardize the evaluation of catalyst activity where the overpotential required to generate 10 mA of O2 production per cm2 of geometric area of catalyst is the primary figure of merit.10 One such way to decrease the ‘apparent’ overpotential is to increase the number of active sites (surface area) exposed to the electrolyte for a given geometric area. Stevens et al. have also recently presented a thorough review of informative and proper methods to benchmark and compare various electrocatalysts.21
Approaches used to synthesize heterogeneous electrocatalysts include solid-state,22 solvothermal,17,23,24 and hydrothermal methods.25 These techniques often require many steps and long processing times, and the resulting catalysts are typically powders that are either spin-cast onto a substrate or anchored down using a polymer binder such as Nafion. The resulting thin films are dense with low roughness ‘factor’ (i.e., ratio of the true-to-geometric surface area), with a correspondingly low number of catalytically active sites exposed to the electrolyte for oxygen evolution. Additionally, the use of polymer binders generally results in poor mechanical stability of the catalyst, and can lead to peeling or flaking of the catalyst when operated for long times at OER potentials.26
In this work, we use flow-through microplasma (MP) jets27,28 to synthesize Ni–Fe oxide films exhibiting high activity and excellent stability for OER. Microplasmas offer a simple, one-step approach to realize aerosolized nanoparticles and nanostructured thin films of oxides, metals, and semiconductors with varying morphologies and structures on virtually any substrate (i.e., conductors, insulators, polymers, and temperature sensitive materials), but have yet to be used to prepare electrocatalysts for OER.29–36 Moreover, the technique we present has great potential for direct spray deposition of conformal coatings of Ni–Fe and other oxide catalysts on a variety of substrates (see ref. 34 for examples) with unique architectures, such as Ni foams, graphene, and carbon nanotubes, which have all been shown to greatly enhance activity and charge transfer efficiency from catalyst to substrate.14,37–40 In the MP process (see ref. 29–31 for details), vapors of metal–organic precursors are delivered via an Ar gas flow to a non-equilibrium, hollow-cathode discharge where high-energy electrons (>10 eV) dissociate the precursor, resulting in activated growth species (i.e., atoms, radicals, ions, and clusters). The high frequency of gas phase collisions due to high pressure operation (>10 Torr) fosters nucleation and growth of clusters and crystalline nanoparticles in the hollow-cathode that are subsequently spray-deposited onto a substrate located downstream of the jet to form nanostructured thin films.
Here, we study microplasma-based deposition of Fe2O3, NiO and Ni1−xFexO (x = 0.05–0.19) thin film catalysts on ITO for OER. Film morphology, structure, and surface chemical state as a function of Fe loading were investigated to understand the catalytic activity for oxygen evolution in basic media. It was found that incorporating Fe into the rocksalt NiO structure results in a decrease in overpotential (i.e., 320 vs. 360 mV@10 mA cm−2 for Ni0.95Fe0.05O and NiO, respectively). Interestingly, overpotentials were found to not vary considerably (310 to 325 mV) with Fe doping in Ni1−xFexO, so long as the Fe content was above x = 0.05. This result was attributed to a simultaneous change in morphology and reduced crystallinity of the films with higher Fe content, as well as from mass transport phenomena and variations in electrical conductivity among different Ni1−xFexO films. Catalyst stability at OER-relevant conditions was tested using chronopotentiometry, and its effect on the structural and chemical properties of the catalyst surface were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Finally, this work demonstrates that microplasmas offer a general synthesis route for mono and mixed metal oxide catalysts for OER and other electrochemical applications.
2 Experimental
2.1 Microplasma-based deposition of electrocatalysts

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the microplasma reactor used to deposit Fe2O3, NiO and Ni1−xFexO (x = 0.05–0.19) thin films on ITO substrates as OER catalysts, and has been detailed elsewhere.32,33 A flow-stabilized, direct-current hollow-cathode Ar discharge was struck inside a stainless steel capillary tube (i.d. = 500 μm) using a current-regulated, negative high voltage power supply (8 mA, 420 V). The anode was a grounded stainless steel ring positioned concentrically around the capillary cathode with Macor insulator. An auxiliary Ar gas flow (100 sccm) into the background of the chamber and a rotary vane vacuum pump were used to regulate the operating pressure at 20 Torr.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the microplasma reactor used to deposit Fe2O3 and Ni1−xFexO (x = 0–0.19) films. A flow-stabilized, direct-current Ar/O2 discharge is struck inside a stainless steel capillary tube. Ni(Cp)2 and Fe(Cp)2 vapors delivered to the plasma are dissociated via electron impact, and react to form Ni/Fe-oxide nanoclusters and/or nanoparticles, which are subsequently spray deposited onto an ITO substrate located downstream. The substrate stage is equipped with x–y stepper motors for raster scanning during deposition. HVPS = high voltage power supply, MFC = mass flow controller, Vac = vacuum, and P = pressure transducer. 
Nickelocene (Ni(Cp)2) and ferrocene (Fe(Cp)2) vapors, created via sublimation of powdered precursors (Strem Chemicals, Inc.) in individual, temperature controlled, stainless steel sublimation cells, were entrained in Ar (10–50 sccm), mixed with a separate Ar/O2 (0.154 mol% O2) stream (50–100 sccm), and delivered to the hollow-cathode where the feedstock was dissociated via electron impact. Operation at elevated pressure (20 Torr) results in high collision frequency in the hollow-cathode (∼1010–1011 s−1) that fosters nucleation and growth of clusters and crystalline nanoparticles. Growth is rapidly quenched due to the supersonic velocity of the jet (∼300 m s−1) and small plasma volume (∼2.0 × 10−4 cm3), yielding clusters and/or nanoparticles <5 nm with narrow size distributions – in similar fashion to microplasma jets at higher (>100 Torr) pressures (see ref. 27, 28 and 31). It is also possible that other ‘active species’ in the jet, e.g., radicals and ions, may contribute to more 'direct' growth of nanostructures on the substrate surface. The gas-phase clusters/nanoparticles were subsequently spray-deposited onto unheated ITO substrates (∼70 °C due to local heating from the plasma jet afterglow; temperature estimated from a fine-wire thermocouple directly beneath the substrate), located 1 cm downstream of the capillary exit to form nanostructured Ni1−xFexO or Fe2O3 films (4 × 4 mm2 deposit) as OER catalysts. The substrate stage was equipped with x–y stepper motors for raster scanning during growth (serpentine pattern at 0.17 mm s−1), making it possible to deposit large area films (4 × 4 mm2). All samples were deposited on both ITO and <100> Si substrates, the latter being used for materials characterization studies. Finally, the composition of the resulting films was controlled by varying the Ar flow rate through the Ni(Cp)2 and Fe(Cp)2 precursor cells, which were held at constant temperatures of 20 °C and 7 °C, respectively.
2.2 Physical characterization
An FEI XL30 Sirion FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an EDAX Si-drift energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector was used to measure bulk compositions of Ni1−xFexO films on ITO using a 20 kV accelerating voltage. High-resolution images were obtained using an FEI Nova Nano 650 FEG SEM with 5 kV accelerating voltage. Plan-view and cross-sectional images were taken from films deposited on ITO and Si, respectively.
Bragg–Brentano X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on films deposited on Si substrates using a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer outfitted with monochromatic Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation and a high-resolution PIXcel 1D detector. The diffraction geometry was offset by −4° to eliminate the high intensity <004> Si peak at ∼69° 2θ from the underlying substrate. All patterns of the Ni1−xFexO (x = 0–0.19) films were collected in a 2θ range from 28 to 82° with a step size of 0.013° and dwell time of 0.627 s per step, whereas the Fe2O3 film was scanned from 20–58° 2θ with a step size of 0.013° and 0.855 s per step scan rate. Grain size was calculated from the most intense reflection using the Scherrer equation after calibrating the diffractometer with a sintered alumina plate (SRM 1976a; NIST) to account for instrument broadening and measurement geometry.
A Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system with a monochromatic Al source (1486.6 eV) was used to measure the surface composition as well as to assess the chemical surface states of all Ni1−xFexO films deposited on ITO. Since the Ni (LMM) Auger peaks overlap with the Fe 2p photoelectron line when using Al X-rays, surface compositions were determined from the Ni 3s and Fe 3p peaks, where the relative sensitivity factors were calibrated beforehand using NiO and Fe2O3 standards, respectively. Survey scans were obtained using a pass energy of 160 eV with a 0.5 eV step size and 150 ms dwell time; high-resolution scans were obtained using a 20 eV pass energy with a 0.1 eV step size and 500 ms dwell time. All data were collected using charge compensation and corrected by setting the true position of the adventitious C 1s line to 285.0 eV.
2.3 DFT electronic structure calculations
Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab Initio Software Package41–44 (VASP) version 5.4.1, using the PBESol45 functional, which provides superior accuracy for equilibrium properties calculated in dense solids. Projector-augmented wave46,47 (PAW) pseudo-potentials treating the 4s electrons as valence states for Fe and Ni were chosen from the GW PAW set provided with VASP.
To understand if Fe substitutes Ni in NiO, and how this impacts the lattice parameter, the CASM48–51 software package was utilized to enumerate several hundred (>800) symmetrically distinct supercells of the cubic rocksalt primitive cell. To ensure proper breaking of the magnetic symmetry, and to avoid local magnetic minima and a potentially inaccurately calculated lattice parameter via magnetostriction, we considered both the chemical (Ni/Fe) and magnetic (up/down) degrees of freedom when performing enumerations. In the case where two or more configurations with identical chemistry (Ni/Fe placement), but different starting magnetic configurations relaxed onto the same final magnetic state, the calculation resulting in the lowest relaxed energy was used.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode setup housed in a glass round bottom flask using a Gamry Series G 300 potentiostat. All measurements were performed in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte solution (pH = 13.7), made from certified ACS grade KOH pellets (Fisher Scientific) and ultra-high purity H2O (18 Megohm cm). Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode. Ni1−xFexO or Fe2O3 films on conductive ITO substrates were used as the working electrode (WE). Recorded potentials were measured against a Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl reference electrode, which was positioned ∼1 cm from the WE using a Luggin capillary. Electrochemical data were corrected for uncompensated resistance, Rs (i.e., solution resistance between reference and working electrodes), using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Rs was attributed to the total impedance measured at 170 kHz using an open circuit potential of 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl, where no Faradaic processes took place. Typical Rrms values ranged from 20–30 Ω and were sensitive to the exact position of the Luggin capillary with respect to the WE. Positive feedback correction was used during cyclic voltammetry measurements to compensate 90% of Rs, and the remaining resistance was compensated manually on the collected data when necessary for precise evaluation of catalyst activity. Current densities were calculated using the geometric area of the deposited square films (16 mm2).
Preconditioning was achieved by allowing the catalysts to soak for 10 min in a magnetically stirred 0.5 M KOH electrolyte under constant aeration with N2 followed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). All catalysts were cycled between −0.1 to 0.6 V (or 0.7 V for less active catalysts) vs. Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl electrode at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 until OER currents reached stable values. The number of CV cycles varied between 20 and 40, where films with higher Fe content stabilized more quickly. After preconditioning, CV scans from −0.1 to 0.6 or 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 were obtained for analysis of overpotentials (η) and the turn-over-frequency (TOF) on a per Ni atom basis. Finally, chronopotentiometry measurements were conducted at a constant current of 10 mA cm−2 for a duration of 2 hours to test the structural and chemical stability of the catalysts during OER. XPS, SEM and CV were used post-run to assess changes in surface chemistry, morphology, and electrochemical behavior, respectively.
The overpotential, η, was evaluated using the equation η = Vmeas − [VNHEmeas − VNHEAg/AgCl − 0.059 × pH] − iRs, where Vmeas is the measured potential vs. the Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl reference electrode. The quantity in brackets represents the reversible potential of the OER vs. Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl (0.225 V at a pH of 13.7), where VNHEOER is the thermodynamic potential of OER vs. NHE (1.23 V), VNHEAg/AgCl is the potential of Ag/AgCl/sat'd KCl vs. NHE (0.197 V), and the final term is the pH dependence of the potential obtained from the Nernst equation. Finally, i is the current and iRs is the voltage drop due to the uncompensated resistance.
The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as the number of O2 molecules generated per electrochemically accessible Ni site per second at η = 300 and 350 mV. The number of O2 molecules produced per second was obtained by measuring the current at η = 300 or 350 mV, where we assumed the evolution of oxygen (4OH(aq)− → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) + 4e−) had a 100% Faradaic efficiency so that every 4 electrons collected equated to the formation of one O2 molecule. The number of electrochemically accessible Ni sites was estimated by integrating the cathodic peak (NiOOH + H2O + e− → Ni(OH)2 + OH−) to obtain the total charge transferred. One electron transferred per Ni atom was assumed, which may overestimate the total number of Ni sites giving a lower bound for the TOF (see section 3.2 for further details).52
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
The surface and bulk compositions of Fe2O3, NiO, and Ni1−xFexO (x = 0.05–0.19) nanostructured thin films on ITO were obtained using XPS and EDX, respectively. Fig. 2(a) clearly demonstrates that the surface and bulk compositions of the Ni1−xFexO films are in good agreement, where x has been measured on a metals basis (i.e., x = Fe/Fe + Ni). All as-deposited Ni1−xFexO films are denoted in this work by their surface composition measured via XPS (i.e., x = 0, 0.05, 0.09, 0.15, and 0.19). Fig. 2(b) and (c) display the powder XRD spectra for the Fe-oxide and Ni1−xFexO films, respectively. The Fe-oxide film was indexed as corundum Fe2O3 (Rc), where the only high intensity peak was from (110) lattice planes, suggesting a highly textured <110> growth direction composed of crystals with an average grain size of 63 nm (calculated from the line broadening of the (110) reflection). The pure Ni oxide film and all mixed Ni1−xFexO films were indexed to the cubic rocksalt structure (Fm3m). The large 25:1 ratio of the (200):(111) reflections for the as-deposited, pure NiO film is much greater than expected from a polycrystalline powder pattern (i.e., (200):(111) = 5:3; ICDD ref. pattern: Bunsenite, syn, 00-047-1049), implying that, like the Fe2O3 film, NiO is strongly textured with growth along the <100> direction and perpendicular to the substrate surface. Interestingly, the (200):(111) ratio progressively decreases with increasing Fe content in Ni1−xFexO films with the smallest ratio of 2:1 seen in the x = 0.19 sample, indicating that Fe incorporation reduces the preferred growth orientation of NiO.

XRD spectra of as-deposited (b) Fe2O3 and (c) Ni1−xFexO films, respectively. Plus (+) and star (*) symbols correspond to peak locations of hematite Fe2O3 and rocksalt NiO, respectively. The broad hump centered at ∼69° 2θ is due to the underlying Si substrate and measurement geometry (−4° offset). Curves have been offset for clarity. 
Additionally, there is a continuous shift in the (200) rocksalt reflection to lower 2θ and a decreasing peak intensity with increasing Fe content, as can be seen in Fig. 3(a). A shift to lower 2θ suggests that Fe2+ dopants are incorporating into the rocksalt NiO structure, resulting in an expansion of the lattice (ionic radius: Fe2+ (0.78 Å) > Ni2+ (0.69 Å)53). Electronic structure calculations were performed to verify this hypothesis and are displayed in Fig. 3(b). The relative change in the rocksalt lattice parameter obtained both from XRD data and DFT calculations at 0 K (∼6 and 7% dilation for x = 0.19, respectively) are in good agreement and follow a Vegard's law dependence. Charge localization (as projected onto each atom) in the DFT calculations shows no abrupt changes in the charge distribution as Ni is replaced with Fe; that is, both species are consistently in the +2 oxidation state.
 Fig. 3  (a) Magnified view of (200) NiO reflection of Ni1−xFexO films from Fig. 2(c), demonstrating expansion of the NiO lattice with Fe incorporation (i.e., peak shift to lower 2θ with Fe). (b) Lattice parameter of rocksalt Ni1−xFexO films normalized by pure NiO measured from XRD data, panel (a), and calculated from DFT assuming Fe2+ dopants. The good agreement between experiment and theory suggest that Fe2+ and not Fe3+ (Fe2+ > Ni2+ > Fe3+) incorporates into the rocksalt NiO lattice during microplasma deposition. 
The agreement between DFT and XRD, and investigation of the precise electronic structure, highly suggest that the lattice expansion is due to Fe2+ incorporation and not Fe3+. Furthermore, the corresponding decrease in peak intensity with higher Fe content can be attributed to reduced crystallinity and/or smaller grain sizes. The average grain sizes for Ni1−xFexO films were calculated from the (200) reflection. Films with lower Fe content (x ≤ 0.09) had relatively large crystal sizes of ∼16–18 nm; whereas, smaller grain sizes of 9 and 6.5 nm were seen in the x = 0.15 and 0.19 films, respectively. Finally, the formation of any Fe-rich phases in mixed Ni1−xFexO films was not observed, implying complete incorporation of the Fe cations into the NiO lattice.
High-resolution SEM micrographs of the deposited Fe2O3 and Ni1−xFexO films are presented in Fig. 4. Plan and cross-sectional views of pure NiO (Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively) reveal that the film is composed of a dense packing of highly crystalline pyramidal columns (d < 100 nm), indicative of a cubic <100> growth direction in agreement with the corresponding XRD spectrum (Fig. 2(c)). This structure is maintained at small Fe doping levels (i.e., x = 0.05 shown in Fig. 4(c)), but the columns and crystalline features become much smaller and appear to have reduced texture at the intermediate composition of x = 0.09 (Fig. 4(d)). As shown in Fig. 4(e)–(g), the morphology of the Ni1−xFexO films changes significantly for x > 0.09, where the films are now dense and comprised of small, randomly-oriented grains. The observed reduction in crystallinity, grain size, and preferred growth direction for Ni1−xFexO films with increasing Fe loading corroborates with the respective XRD data (Fig. 2(c) and 3(a)). Similar to pure NiO, the as-deposited Fe2O3 film shown in Fig. 4(h) is composed of relatively large, crystalline columns with highly faceted tops, indicative of a rhombohedral (110) texture. Finally, all deposited films were between 650 and 900 nm thick, where the variation in height can be attributed to slightly different total precursor fluxes used during growth and film packing densities.

Thorough investigations of phase equilibria in the Ni–Fe–O system by Rhamdhani et al. revealed that the Fe solubility limit in rocksalt NiO is <1 at% at temperatures <600 K.54 The ability to realize crystalline and metastable Fe-doped NiO rocksalt with a high solubility of Fe (up to 20% on a metals basis) on cold substrates using MP jets, where the temperature of the expanding gas is close to ambient, may be explained by selective heating of the nanoparticles in the hollow-cathode region of the plasma above their crystallization threshold temperature. Recently, it has been shown that nanoparticles formed in low-temperature plasmas can achieve temperatures significantly higher than the apparent gas temperature due to a number of energetic surface processes that include ion/e− collisional heating, ion/e− recombination, and association of atoms on the growing nanoparticle surface.55–58 For example, Askari et al. demonstrated that Si nanoparticles <10 nm formed in atmospheric-pressure microplasmas (Tgas ∼490 K) can reach temperatures of ∼780 K from collisional heating.59 The same mechanism is most likely at play here for the formation of crystalline Ni1−xFexO and Fe2O3 particles in the hollow-cathode. Additionally, bombardment of the growing film surface with charged species from the plasma jet afterglow could enhance surface diffusion explaining the formation of highly textured, crystalline films for pure NiO and Fe2O3. Interestingly, the film morphology of mixed Ni1−xFexO films with x > 0.09 is reminiscent of ballistic aggregation, where nanoparticles or clusters from the gas phase hit and stick to the substrate surface due to low surface mobility, resulting in tapered columns with random crystallographic orientations (Fig. 4(e)–(g)).60–62 This suggests that the incorporation of Fe into the crystalline NiO nanoparticles formed in the gas phase significantly influences film growth dynamics, where arriving Ni1−xFexO nanoclusters and/or particles are unable to rearrange on the film surface to form long range crystalline grains.
3.2 Cyclic voltammetry measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on pure NiO and Fe2O3 films were performed in 0.5 M KOH and are displayed in Fig. 5(a). The NiO film shows behavior characteristic of NiO with cathodic and anodic peaks centered near 0.3 and 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl using a 10 mV s−1 scan rate, respectively, followed by a large increase in current density from the evolution of oxygen with an onset potential of ∼0.51 V (ηonset = 0.29). Although the as-deposited film is crystalline rocksalt NiO, it is well known that Ni(OH)2 surface layers spontaneously form when NiO is exposed to alkaline electrolytes. As such, the measured anodic peak at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH, and the corresponding cathodic peak at ∼0.3 V to the reduction of NiOOH back to Ni(OH)2. In contrast, there were no Faradaic reactions on the Fe2O3 film for the potential range of the measurement, and the onset of oxygen evolution occurs at ∼0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (ηonset = 0.38), significantly higher than NiO. The overpotential (η) measured at 10 mA cm−2, which is the generally accepted figure of merit of OER catalysts, for the as-deposited NiO and Fe2O3 films was 360 and 470 mV, respectively. The relatively low overpotential measured here for NiO compares favorably with the literature.10,12,23

The anodic and cathodic peaks of NiO can be attributed to the Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH redox reaction. Current density based on geometric area (4 × 4 mm2). (b) High resolution XPS scans of the Fe 3p peak show an increase in Fe on the NiO surface during electrochemical cycling in unpurified KOH. 
Recently, Trotochaud et al. showed that the low intrinsic overpotentials of NiO measured in alkaline media are most likely due to the incorporation of Fe dopants from impure electrolytes.63 They discovered that no significant OER currents were witnessed until >400 mV overpotential for Ni(OH)2 catalysts cycled in purified KOH electrolytes, demonstrating that NiOOH is a poor catalyst for OER. Similar findings from other groups have verified that undoped NiO catalysts would become contaminated with trace quantities of Fe from unpurified electrolytes, resulting in high activity.64,65 To test if trace Fe impurities from the 0.5 M KOH electrolyte were incorporated into our NiO film during electrochemical testing, XPS scans of the Fe 3p photoelectron peak were taken both before and after electrochemical cycling and are shown in Fig. 5(b). There was no detectable Fe signal in the as-deposited NiO film, but a small Fe 3p signal emerged after cycling in 0.5 M KOH, with an approximate surface Fe composition of 2% on a metals basis (i.e., Fe/Fe + Ni). As such, we cannot discount that the relatively low overpotentials seen here in the pure NiO film are influenced by the presence of Fe impurities on the catalyst surface.
CV curves of the Ni1−xFexO films are plotted in Fig. 6(a). As with the pure NiO film, only the redox reactions associated with Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH were observed, but the redox pair shifts to more anodic potentials with increasing Fe dopant concentrations. Additionally, the integrated area of the redox peaks, which is a measure of the total charge transferred, decreases with higher Fe loadings. These results suggest that the presence of Fe suppresses the oxidation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH, and that the Fe dopants are displacing Ni surface sites in the rocksalt structure, resulting in fewer electrochemically exposed Ni atoms to undergo oxidation and reduction reactions. Fig. 6(b) summarizes the measured η at 10 mA cm−2 for Ni1−xFexO films. There is a significant decrease in η from 360 mV for the as-deposited, undoped NiO film to 320 mV for Ni0.95Fe0.05O, but the overpotential remains relatively constant for Fe compositions between 5 and 19% (i.e., between 310 and 325 mV). Louie and Bell saw a similar result in their electrodeposited Ni–Fe catalysts, albeit at a different composition range, where catalytic activity increased with Fe composition up to about 20% (on a metals basis), remained relatively constant up to 50% Fe, and then decreased again with even higher Fe concentrations.15 Fominykh et al. have seen a similar trend.17

The anodic and cathodic peaks of Ni1−xFexO films can be attributed to the Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH redox reaction. (b) Overpotential (η) measured at 10 mA cm−2 for different Ni1−xFexO films. Lines are only meant to guide the eye. 
The turn-over-frequency (TOF) was calculated at η = 300 and 350 mV to assess the catalytic activity of the Ni1−xFexO films normalized by the number of electrochemically accessible Ni atoms. Irrespective of whether Fe is a (the) catalytically active site in our Ni1−xFexO films, it is still worthwhile to scale against Ni, as it allows for direct comparison between catalysts and of the effectiveness of the NiO surface at catalyzing OER. More specifically, the TOFs of the Ni1−xFexO films displayed in Fig. 7(a) were calculated as the number of O2 molecules generated per electrochemically accessible Ni site, where the number of Ni sites was estimated from the charge obtained from integration of the cathodic going reduction peak assuming a 1e− transfer per Ni site (note: Stevens et al.21 have shown this to be equivalent to quartz crystal microbalance measurements, but comment that older literature frequently use 1.53e− per Ni site). The TOFs for pure NiO were calculated as 0.01 and 0.07 s−1 at η = 300 and 350 mV, respectively, using 1e−/Ni site, which is higher than many reported NiO electrocatalysts.12,65,66 The TOF increased with Fe doping levels, with the x = 0.19 sample having the highest values of 0.10 and 0.48 s−1 at η = 300 and 350 mV, respectively. Published TOF values for Ni–Fe catalysts have been shown to range anywhere from ∼0.01 to 90, and depend strongly on the method used to estimate the number of catalytically active Ni sites, which has been discussed in great detail in the literature.15,17,21 As such, this measurement should be taken with great care when comparing to other experimental efforts, but is well suited for comparing activity trends between similar catalysts in a single study. As seen in Fig. 7(a), the TOF measured at η = 350 mV increases sharply for Fe levels up to x = 0.1, followed by a marginal improvement from x = 0.1 to 0.19. Although the measured overpotentials do not vary much for the Fe containing NiO films, the incorporation of Fe up to 19% improves the catalytic activity of the NiO surface. Fig. 7(b) displays the Tafel plots for all Ni1−xFexO films. The Tafel slopes obtained at low current densities (<1 mA cm−2) for Fe-doped samples (20–25 mV dec−1) were slightly lower than that for the undoped NiO film (30 mV dec−1), and compare well with other Ni–Fe oxide electrocatalysts, where Tafel slopes of 30–40 mV dec−1 are commonly observed.14–17,65,67,68

There are a few important points to consider when assessing the catalytic activity of our Ni1−xFexO films. First, the morphology change and decrease in grain size and crystallinity with increasing Fe concentration make it challenging to isolate the effects of Fe dopants on activity. Also, all CV measurements were performed with a static working electrode where mass-transport phenomena certainly influence the observed activity, which would actually underrepresent the true activity of our catalysts. Moreover, higher activity catalysts would be more impacted than lower activity catalysts, as was shown by Louie and Bell for electrodeposited Ni–Fe thin films using a rotating working electrode.15 Finally, the ∼600–950 nm thick films we show are much thicker than most OER catalysts (<100 nm), which could lead to a non negligible voltage drop across the thickness of our oxide films and a corresponding increase in measured overpotentials; as such, the overpotentials we measure are an upper bound for the true value. Furthermore, the magnitude of this voltage drop is not expected to be constant among all films due to differing film thicknesses and Fe concentrations, where it has been shown that higher Fe loadings lead to better electrical conductivity in Ni–Fe oxide electrodes.63 It is worth noting that our oxide films are relatively conductive, as evidenced by the high-resolution SEM images obtained without coating the surface with a conductive layer.
3.3 Catalyst stability testing
The electrochemical stability of Ni1−xFexO films was tested using chronopotentiometry at OER relevant conditions (i.e., 2 hours @ 10 mA cm−2), which is shown in Fig. 8(a). The potential needed to maintain a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 decreased with time for the pure NiO film, and increased slightly for all Fe-doped NiO samples. The decrease in potential signifies an improvement in catalytic activity for the NiO film, where in the literature, has been attributed to transformation of the surface γ-NiOOH phase to the more crystalline and catalytically active β-phase when aged in alkaline electrolytes.69–71 However, Trotochaud et al. and Klaus et al. have recently shown that β-NiOOH, when cycled in purified electrolytes, is less active than γ-NiOOH, and that previous reports of highly active β-NiOOH may be rationalized by the incorporation of trace Fe impurities from the electrolyte.63,64 As discussed above and shown in Fig. 5(b), Fe uptake onto the pristine NiO surface from the KOH electrolyte may explain the improvement in catalytic activity seen here. For the Fe-doped NiO films, the slight increase in potential with time may be due to mass-transport phenomena, where oxygen bubbles forming on the catalyst surface during OER block catalytically active sites, requiring higher potentials to realize a constant current density. This hypothesis was tested on the x = 0.09 and 0.15 samples by stopping the measurement after 1 hour to remove any accumulated oxygen bubbles before continuing the chronopotentiometry test. After interruption, the voltage drops down to its original value at the start of the measurement (Fig. 8(a)), confirming that the increasing voltage with time is due to blocked catalytic sites and not from catalyst deactivation. CV curves after OER polarization were measured to assess changes in the electrochemical behavior of the catalysts. Fig. 8(b) displays CV curves measured both before and after chronopotentiometry testing for pure NiO and the x = 0.15 film. The redox peak area increases for both samples, which is most likely due to an increase in surface area from restructuring of the film surface and/or conversion of the underlying Ni1−xFexO film to Ni1−xFex(OH)2. The increase in activity of the pure NiO film after OER polarization can be rationalized from the incorporation of trace Fe from the electrolyte, as opposed to an increase in surface area from restructuring; whereas, the x = 0.15 sample had no change in activity. Finally, the structural stability of the catalysts after OER polarization was assessed via SEM, with the x = 0 and 0.15 samples shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d), respectively. There is evidence of local ripening of surfaces from electrochemical cycling, resulting in smooth facets, but the macroscopic morphology of the films was unaltered. Moreover, there was no flaking or peeling of the Ni1−xFexO films from the ITO substrate. These results demonstrate that Fe-doped NiO films deposited via microplasmas are mechanically and electrochemically robust for OER.
 Fig. 8  (a) Chronopotentiometry results where the Ni1−xFexO films were held at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 2 hours. The discontinuity for the x = 0.09 and 0.15 films (arrow) is from current interrupt, where oxygen bubbles were removed from the film surface after 1 hour to verify that the voltage creep was due to blocked catalytic sites and not from catalyst deactivation. (b) CV curves for the x = 0 and 0.15 films measured before and after OER polarization, illustrating that Fe-doped NiO films are electrochemically stable. (c) and (d) High-resolution SEM micrographs of x = 0 and 0.15 films after chronopotentiometry measurements, respectively, demonstrating structural and mechanical stability at OER conditions. Compare with pristine film morphology in Fig. 4(e) and (f). 
High-resolution XPS spectra of the Ni 2p and O 1s photoelectron lines were collected before and after chronopotentiometry measurements to assess any chemical changes on the Ni1−xFexO film surface. Fig. 9(a) displays the Ni 2p photoelectron lines and the corresponding shake-up peaks from unpaired electrons for the as-deposited Ni1−xFexO films. Quantitative analysis of the Ni 2p envelope in this case is complex because of the overlap between Ni 3d and O 2p electrons, resulting in many multiplet structures and shakeup satellites.72 An NiO powder sample (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a reference for the Ni2+ oxidation state, and is presented in Fig. 9(a). The Ni 2p3/2 portion of the Ni 2p spectrum for the NiO powder is manifested as a doublet at a bonding energy (BE) of ∼853.8 and 855.8 eV, with the former having a higher peak intensity. This same doublet structure appears in all microplasma deposited Ni1−xFexO films, but the relative peak intensity of the higher BE peak with respect to the lower peak is greater than that for the NiO reference sample. It is likely that the increase in intensity at 855.8 eV is from the presence of Ni1−xFex(OH)2, which has been shown to have its largest peak contribution at 855.7 eV.73 Moreover, absence of the major Ni3+ peak signature at ∼856.5 eV suggests that there are no Ni1−xFexOOH or Ni2O3 phases present.73 Finally, doping Fe into the NiO structure appears to have no effect on the shape of the Ni 2p photoelectron line.

The relative quantities of these chemical states are labeled above each peak. 

Fig. 9(b) shows the Ni 2p spectra for the Ni1−xFexO films after exposure to OER conditions (i.e., 2 hours @ 10 mA cm−2). The Ni 2p3/2 peak of the pure NiO film is dominated by Ni(OH)2 character, with a single peak at 855.8 eV, and no indication of the NiO feature at 853.8 eV, suggesting that the entire NiO surface has transformed to Ni(OH)2 during electrochemical testing in KOH electrolyte. Interestingly, the peak structure at 853.8 eV is observed in all of the Fe-doped NiO samples, and its intensity, relative to the higher BE feature, increases with Fe. Moreover, the intensity ratio of the higher-to-lower BE peaks is much greater than that for the pristine, as-deposited films. The latter two observations imply that the Ni1−xFexO films are more hydrated after OER polarization with the degree of hydration dependent on Fe composition, where higher Fe content hampers the hydration of Ni1−xFexO to Ni1−xFex(OH)2. Additionally, the characteristic signatures of Ni3+ at higher BE (∼856.5 eV) are not present, implying that the Ni1−xFexOOH surface phase present at OER potentials reduces entirely to Ni1−xFex(OH)2 when the potential is removed.
High resolution scans of the O 1s peak can give further insight into the bonding environment of the Ni1−xFexO film surfaces, as well as the degree of hydration. Fig. 9(c) clearly shows three distinct bonding states of O in the as-deposited films, where the fitted peaks at 529.3 (blue), 531 (red), and 532.5 eV (yellow) correspond to the Ni–O, Ni–O–H, and adsorbed O–H and O–C bonding states, respectively. In all films, the surface is composed of Ni–O from NiO, and to a lesser extent, Ni–O–H from Ni(OH)2, in good agreement with the Ni 2p spectra. After OER polarization, the O 1s peak is dominated by Ni–O–H at 531 eV, with a small contribution from Ni–O at 529.3, and negligible signal from adsorbed species at 532.5 eV (Fig. 9(d)). In the case of pure NiO, there is a negligible signal of the Ni–O phase, verifying that the film surface has become entirely hydrated Ni(OH)2. Incorporation of Fe into the NiO structure appears to suppress the hydration of NiO to Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 9(d)). This was also observed by Nardi et al. in atomic layer deposited NiO films tested in Fe-rich KOH electrolyte.65 Both the Ni 2p and O 1s XPS spectra reveal that the surface of the as-deposited Ni1−xFexO films is a mixture of both Ni1−xFexO and Ni1−xFex(OH)2 phases, which become predominately Ni1−xFex(OH)2 with small quantities of Ni1−xFexO upon exposure to OER potentials. The increasing Fe content in the NiO films appears to suppress the hydration of Ni1−xFexO to Ni1−xFex(OH)2.
4. Conclusions
Nanostructured Fe2O3, NiO, and Ni1−xFexO films with electrochemical OER activity were deposited on ITO substrates using flow-stabilized microplasma jets. Pure Fe2O3 and NiO films formed as a dense packing of highly crystalline and textured columnar structures with relatively large crystal sizes (63 and 16 nm, respectively). For the as-deposited Ni1−xFexO films, Fe2+ was observed to fully incorporate into the rocksalt lattice, resulting in a lattice dilation of ∼6% with 20 at% measured on a metals basis. The crystallinity and grain size decreased with increasing Fe content, where the film morphology transitioned from oriented crystalline columns to a dense packing of small, randomly oriented grains (<10 nm) at x > 0.09. The relatively low overpotentials measured for the undoped NiO sample may be due to incorporation of trace amounts of Fe from the unpurified KOH electrolyte. It was seen that intentionally doping NiO with Fe resulted in lower overpotentials; however, the actual level of Fe doping (5–19%) did not appear to have a significant effect. This finding may be due to mass transport phenomena, variations in electrical conductivity in the different Ni1−xFexO films, as well as a change in morphology and reduction in crystallinity and grain size with increasing Fe incorporation into the NiO lattice. In contrast, the TOF of the Ni1−xFexO catalysts increased with Fe content from 0.07 s−1 for NiO to 0.48 s−1 for Ni0.81Fe0.19O at η = 350 mV, leading to an improvement in catalytic activity of the NiO surface. XPS and SEM analysis after chronopotentiometry and electrochemical cycling verified that the catalysts are chemically and mechanically stable during operation at OER conditions. Moreover, this work demonstrates that microplasmas offer a general, one-step approach to deposit conformal coatings of oxide-based catalysts with high activities for OER.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the microplasma reactor used to deposit Fe2O3 and Ni1−xFexO (x = 0–0.19) films. A flow-stabilized, direct-current Ar/O2 discharge is struck inside a stainless steel capillary tube. Ni(Cp)2 and Fe(Cp)2 vapors delivered to the plasma are dissociated via electron impact, and react to form Ni/Fe-oxide nanoclusters and/or nanoparticles, which are subsequently spray deposited onto an ITO substrate located downstream. The substrate stage is equipped with x–y stepper motors for raster scanning during deposition. HVPS = high voltage power supply, MFC = mass flow controller, Vac = vacuum, and P = pressure transducer.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Comparison of surface and bulk compositions of Ni1−xFexO films obtained via XPS and EDX, respectively, where x has been measured on a metals basis (x = Fe/Fe + Ni). XRD spectra of as-deposited (b) Fe2O3 and (c) Ni1−xFexO films, respectively. Plus (+) and star (*) symbols correspond to peak locations of hematite Fe2O3 and rocksalt NiO, respectively. The broad hump centered at ∼69° 2θ is due to the underlying Si substrate and measurement geometry (−4° offset). Curves have been offset for clarity.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Magnified view of (200) NiO reflection of Ni1−xFexO films from Fig. 2(c), demonstrating expansion of the NiO lattice with Fe incorporation (i.e., peak shift to lower 2θ with Fe). (b) Lattice parameter of rocksalt Ni1−xFexO films normalized by pure NiO measured from XRD data, panel (a), and calculated from DFT assuming Fe2+ dopants. The good agreement between experiment and theory suggest that Fe2+ and not Fe3+ (Fe2+ > Ni2+ > Fe3+) incorporates into the rocksalt NiO lattice during microplasma deposition.	 

 	Fig. 4  High-resolution SEM micrographs of microplasma jet-deposited Ni1−xFexO and Fe2O3 films: (a, b) x = 0, (c) x = 0.05, (d) x = 0.09, (e, f) x = 0.15, (g) x = 0.19, and (h) Fe2O3. Cross-sections for all doped films were similar to NiO shown in panel (b).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of undoped NiO and Fe2O3 films on ITO in 0.5 M KOH at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The dotted line represents the CV scan of a blank ITO substrate. The anodic and cathodic peaks of NiO can be attributed to the Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH redox reaction. Current density based on geometric area (4 × 4 mm2). (b) High resolution XPS scans of the Fe 3p peak show an increase in Fe on the NiO surface during electrochemical cycling in unpurified KOH.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of Ni1−xFexO films on ITO in 0.5 M KOH at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The dotted line represents the CV scan of a blank ITO substrate. The anodic and cathodic peaks of Ni1−xFexO films can be attributed to the Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH redox reaction. (b) Overpotential (η) measured at 10 mA cm−2 for different Ni1−xFexO films. Lines are only meant to guide the eye.	 

 	Fig. 7  Kinetic analysis of Ni1−xFexO films from the CV scans in Fig. 6(a): (a) turn-over-frequency (TOF) calculated at η = 300 and 350 mV, where the lines are only meant to guide the eye, and (b) Tafel plot, where both NiO (∼30 mV dec−1) and Ni1−xFexO (∼20–25 mV dec−1) display relatively low Tafel slopes at low current densities from 0.01 to 1 mA cm−2 (see ref. 17, Fig. S11 for a comparison).	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Chronopotentiometry results where the Ni1−xFexO films were held at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 2 hours. The discontinuity for the x = 0.09 and 0.15 films (arrow) is from current interrupt, where oxygen bubbles were removed from the film surface after 1 hour to verify that the voltage creep was due to blocked catalytic sites and not from catalyst deactivation. (b) CV curves for the x = 0 and 0.15 films measured before and after OER polarization, illustrating that Fe-doped NiO films are electrochemically stable. (c) and (d) High-resolution SEM micrographs of x = 0 and 0.15 films after chronopotentiometry measurements, respectively, demonstrating structural and mechanical stability at OER conditions. Compare with pristine film morphology in Fig. 4(e) and (f).	 

 	Fig. 9  High-resolution XPS spectra of the (a, c) pristine, as-deposited Ni1−xFexO films and (b, d) after polarization at OER conditions (10 mA cm−2 for 2 hours): (a, b) Ni 2p photoelectron line, where an NiO powder was used as a reference (grey, top curve), and (c, d) O 1s photoelectron line, where the fitted peaks at 529.3 (blue), 531 (red), and 532.5 (orange) correspond to the Ni–O, Ni–O–H, and adsorbed O–H and O–C bonding states, respectively. The relative quantities of these chemical states are labeled above each peak.
