    , Accepted 20th July 2011First published on 8th August 2011AbstractThe energy transfer cassettes composed of coumarin and Bodipy as well as NIR distyryl Bodipys were designed to capture photonic energy and convert it to longer wavelength fluorescence emission; large pseudo-Stokes' shifts (up to 410 nm) and efficient energy transfer efficiencies (up to 98.6%) as well as a marked antenna effect were demonstrated.
Excitation energy transfer (EET) is a vital process in nature, and primarily responsible for ensuring that the reaction-center complex is adequately supplied with photons.1 For example, photosynthetic organisms make use of chromophore-rich antenna proteins to funnel the captured light energy to the reaction center where it initiates a multistep electron-transfer reaction, leading eventually to the oxidation of water to oxygen and the fixation of carbon dioxide.2 Energy transfer has also found numerous important applications in many fields, such as measuring distances in biological materials,3 improved efficacy of organic light-emitting diodes,4 chemical sensors,5 advanced photochromic devices,6 and sensitized solar cells.7
Essentially, EET can take place via two pathways (Fig. 1): fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and through-bond energy transfer (TBET). FRET dyads8 are, generally, linked by a nonconjugated spacer, and the single excitation wavelength of a donor fluorophore results in emission of the acceptor at a longer wavelength. The efficiency of FRET is primarily controlled by two parameters:9 (1) the distance between the energy donor and acceptor fluorophores, and (2) the spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of the energy donor and the absorption spectrum of the energy acceptor. Virtually, the strong overlap requirement in FRET systems places a limitation on the flexibility of selection of the donors or acceptors, and therefore limits the number of FRET-based EET systems to some extent. By contrast, in TBET systems,10–13 the donor and the acceptor fragments are joined via a conjugated spacer (for example phenyl and ethynylphenyl), but steric effects prevent them from becoming flat and conjugated. Compared with FRET, TBET is not limited by the known constraint of intense spectral overlap between the donor emission and the acceptor absorption in FRET, thereby providing more opportunities to develop EET systems on the base of the TBET platform. The high energy transfer efficiencies, fast energy transfer rates and large pseudo-Stokes' shifts make TBET systems considerably attractive, and enable their applications in many fields, such as optical materials,11 photosynthetic models,12 biotechnology10 and chemosensors.13 However, a few TBET systems that involve the near-infrared (NIR) dyes were reported though NIR dyes have found wide applications in various fields, such as laser printing, information storage, displays,14in vivo imaging15 and solar power conversion.16
 Fig. 1  (a) FRET and TBET cassettes. (b) Energy level diagram illustrating the photophysical processes of EET. Excitation of the donor results in EET to the higher excited state of the acceptor. This state is rapidly converted to S1, from which the acceptor emission is observed. 

        Distyryl boron dipyrromethenes (Bodipys) are versatile NIR dyes of which the absorption and emission properties can be easily tuned by chemical modification of the π systems.17 Some of the desirable characteristics of these dyes include strong absorption in the NIR region, high fluorescence quantum yield, and good solubility and stability in many solvent systems. As a result, they have been widely studied as fluorescent probes for metal ions,18 building blocks for artificial photosynthetic models,19 and photosensitisers for photodynamic therapy20 and dye-sensitised solar cells.21 Herein, we present a series of TBET cassettes (5–8, Scheme 1) that combines the properties of coumarin and Bodipy as well as NIR distyryl Bodipy dyes in a donor–acceptor chemical architecture. In these cassettes, a rigid and conjugated phenyl moiety was selected as a linker that may prevent the donor and acceptor moieties from becoming planar (Fig. S1, ESI†) and facilitate the TBET process.10 These cassettes display efficient energy transfer efficiencies (up to 98.6%) and a large pseudo-Stokes' shift (up to 410 nm) as well as a remarkable antenna effect (up to 5.5-fold). Specially, cassettes 6–8 work via excitation of a coumarin donor with blue light (340 nm) followed by efficient energy transfer to variable distyryl Bodipys-based acceptors, which then emit at the NIR region varied from 632 to 750 nm. In addition, this TBET platform was also applied to develop an NIR pH probe.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the coumarin–Bodipys EET cassettes 5–8. 
Compound 4, 3-(4-formylphenyl)-coumarin, was prepared according to a literature procedure.10f As shown in Scheme 1, the cassette 5 was synthesized by condensation of compound 4 with 2,4-dimethylpyrrole with added TFA as catalyst followed by oxidation with DDQ and treatment with BF3–OEt2. The cassettes 6 and 7 were obtained by the reaction of compound 5 with the corresponding aldehydes in toluene, using piperidine, glacial acetic acid, and Mg(ClO4)2 as catalyst. The cassette 8 is the doubly protonated species of 7, and could be easily prepared by treatment of an ethanolic solution of 7 with ethanol–HCl. These new coumarin–Bodipy compounds were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and HRMS (ESI†).
As expected, the absorption spectra of cassettes 5–8 reflect the presence of the separate coumarin and Bodipy units (Fig. 2). They all have a coumarin donor component, and hence they absorb around 340 nm (the π–π* transitions of coumarin groups). The bands at 501, 641, 700 and 620 nm for 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively, are attributed to the S0 → S1Bodipy transition. For 6 and 7, the high energy parts of the spectra at 370 nm and 415 nm, respectively, can be assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) bands due to electron-donating methoxy group and dimethyl amino group. In fact, the band at 415 nm of 7 disappeared on protonation, suggesting its ICT property, as shown in absorption spectra of 8. The above results reveal that there are very weak electronic interactions between the donor and the acceptor in the ground state, and the compounds 5–8 behave as cassettes instead of planar, totally conjugated dyes.
 Fig. 2  Normalized absorption, excitation and emission spectra of cassettes 5–8 [(a)–(d), respectively] in EtOH. The concentration of all the compounds is 5 μM. The excitation wavelength for 5–8 is 340 nm. 
The emission spectra of cassettes 5–8 are displayed in Fig. 3. When cassettes 5–8 in ethanol were excited at 340 nm, the emission of the coumarin energy donor around 408 nm was almost completely quenched when compared with that of model coumarin 3, only the characteristic emission bands of the acceptor Bodipys (512, 658, 750, and 632 nm, respectively, for 5, 6, 7, and 8) were observed. The weak emission at 750 nm for 7 is likely because the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the dimethylamino nitrogen to the excited state Bodipy moiety quenches the emission. This is demonstrated by the emission spectra of its protonated product 8, where a strong and hypsochromic-shift emission at 632 nm was observed due to the loss of lone pair delocalization and inhibition of PET. The visual emission color of cassettes 5–8 when excited at a hand-held 365 nm UV lamp is shown in Fig. 4, which is consistent with the above analysis. In addition, the excitation spectra obtained by collecting emission data of 5, 6, 7, and 8 at 512, 658, 750, and 632 nm, respectively, match the absorption spectrum well (Fig. 2), indicating that all transitions participate in the emission process and the energy transfer can occur from the coumarin donor to the Bodipy acceptors. The energy-transfer efficiencies were calculated based on the equation: E = {100 × [1 − (fluorescence intensity of the donor in the cassette)/(fluorescence intensity of the free donor)]%},10g to be 96.0%, 98.5%, 98.5%, and 98.6%, respectively, confirming the efficient energy transfer in cassettes 5–8. In addition, it was noted that when the coumarin donor moiety in 5–8 was excited, the fluorescence intensities of Bodipys emission were significantly higher than that obtained by direct excitation of the Bodipy acceptors, suggesting the marked antenna effect.8h The antenna effect quantified in this way for 5–8 is 3.0-, 1.6-, 2.7-, and 5.5-fold, respectively.
 Fig. 3  The emission spectra of cassettes 5–8 (excited at the coumarin donor unit and the core Bodipy units, respectively) and the model donor 3 in ethanol. The efficient energy transfer and the marked antenna effect are displayed. The concentration of all the compounds is 5 μM. 
 Fig. 4  The visual emission color of cassettes 5–8 when excited at a hand-held 365 nm UV lamp. The concentration of all the compounds is 5 μM. 
The photophysical data of the cassettes 5–8 are given in Table 1. Indeed, in these cassettes, the energy is absorbed at wavelengths corresponding to the donor fragment and emitted at wavelengths governed by the acceptor part, hence large pseudo-Stokes' shifts (up to 410 nm) were observed, which is, to the best of our knowledge, much larger than those of the reported TBET cassettes,10 as well as those of the typical FRET-based systems.8

Due to the large differences of the emission properties between cassette 7 and its protonated product 8, cassette 7 is expected to be a sensitive pH probe. As shown in Fig. 5, with decreasing the pH value from 7.5 to 1.5, the emission at 750 nm gradually decreased; concomitantly, the emission at 632 nm was drastically enhanced due to the inhibition of the ICT and PET processes upon protonation of the basic dimethyl amino groups. The fluorescence quantum yield finally reaches a value of 0.56, and the fluorescence of the solution also turned to bright red. The change of fluorescence intensity at 632 nm based on the pH variation is over 1460-fold, suggesting the high sensitivity of 7 to a minor pH change. There was a good linearity between the fluorescence intensity and pH in the range from 1.9 to 3.4 (Fig. 5b). The regression equation was YF = 1.91 × 106 − 5.65 × 105XpH with a linear coefficient of 0.992.

In summary, we have synthesized and characterized a series of coumarin–Bodipy/distyryl Bodipy EET cassettes. The important features of this class of EET cassettes are the efficient energy transfer efficiencies, and the large pseudo-Stokes-shifts, as well as the remarkable antenna effect. In addition, this EET platform was also applied to develop an NIR pH probe.
