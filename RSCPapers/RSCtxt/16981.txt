    , Accepted 8th April 2014First published on 9th April 2014AbstractDespite their extremely low solubility in most solvents, hexagonal grey selenium and tellurium are shown to be remarkably soluble in binary mixtures of thiols and ethylenediamine (en) at room temperature and ambient pressure. A 1:4 vol/vol mixture of ethanethiol (EtSH) and en gave saturated solutions of 38 and 9.3 wt% for grey selenium and tellurium, respectively. Crystalline and phase-pure chalcogen is easily recovered from solution by drying and mild heat treatment at 250 °C (for selenium) or evaporation at room temperature (for tellurium). To demonstrate utility for these dissolved chalcogens, it was shown that elemental antimony readily reacts with the dissolved selenium to give a stable, solution processable Sb–Se precursor solution. In the same way, elemental tin reacts with the dissolved tellurium to generate a Sn–Te precursor solution. Upon solution deposition and heat treatment to 250 °C, these precursor solutions yielded crystalline Sb2Se3 and SnTe.
Introduction
Elemental selenium and tellurium are notoriously insoluble in most common solvents, which limits the scope of solution-phase chemistry that can be done with the elemental sources. While the amorphous and red monoclinic allotropes of selenium possess marginal solubility in carbon disulfide (CS2) and diiodomethane, the most thermodynamically stable, grey hexagonal (or “metallic”) allotrope of selenium is on the order of 103 times less soluble, with a reported solubility in CS2 of only 4.5 × 10−5 wt% at 25 °C.1 The solubility of tellurium in CS2 and related solvents is negligible and is thus usually regarded as insoluble.2 Both grey selenium and tellurium are soluble in oleum and highly caustic solutions;2,3 however, the ramifications of working with highly acidic or basic solutions limit their practicality. Selenium is partly soluble in aqueous solutions of strong, chemically soft nucleophiles (Nu−) through equilibrium formation of catenated ions NuSe−; formation constants for SeSSO32−, SeSCN−, HOCH2CH2SSe−, and SeSO32− are 3.6 × 10−3 (23 °C), 4.0 × 10−3, 0.33 (23 °C), and 0.52 (25 °C), respectively.4 Aqueous cyanide easily dissolves selenium, forming stable salts of SeCN−; however, tellurocyanates can only be prepared under non-aqueous conditions and are extremely unstable towards loss of tellurium.5
More recently, tellurium and selenium have been reported to have ∼0.5 wt% solubility in ethylenediamine (for both Se and Te)6 and glycerol (for Te)7 under solvothermal conditions (180–200 °C and elevated pressure). Selenium has also been reported to be moderately soluble in bicyclic amidines,8 in a dodecanethiol–oleylamine mixture,9 and in hydrazine.10 Of these examples, the solubility of selenium in hydrazine has proven very significant for the solution processing of absorber layers in high efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) solar cells,11 although hydrazine has the disadvantage of being highly toxic. While both selenium and tellurium possess some solubility in imidazolium and phosphonium ionic liquids at elevated temperatures,12 the involatility of these liquids limits their usefulness for solution processing semiconductor films.
Overall, these examples highlight the need for new solvents or solvent mixtures that are (i) less hazardous, (ii) have appreciable solvent power for both selenium and tellurium under mild conditions, and (iii) have sufficient volatility such that they are amenable to solution deposition of semiconductor films. Such a system would have important applications in both the solution chemistry of these elements and also the fabrication of metal selenides and tellurides upon reaction with an appropriate metal precursor. Herein, we demonstrate the outstanding solvent power of binary thiol–1,2-ethylenediamine (en) solvent mixtures for both grey selenium and tellurium, where the thiol component can be ethanethiol (EtSH), 2-mercaptoethanol, or 1,2-ethanedithiol. We further demonstrate the easy recovery of crystalline and phase-pure selenium and tellurium from these solutions, and utilize the dissolved species for the low-temperature synthesis of Sb2Se3 and SnTe, which are semiconductors with potential use as infrared detectors,13 photovoltatics,14 and thermoelectrics.15
Results and discussion
A 1:4 vol/vol mixture of EtSH and en possesses excellent solvent power for both grey selenium and tellurium at room temperature and ambient pressure. The solubilities, given as wt% solute in the saturated solution, are 38 and 9.3 for grey selenium and tellurium, respectively. These solubilities are extremely high when compared to the solubilities that have been reported for other solvents (vide supra), especially since the values reported here correspond to room temperature and ambient pressure. The dissolved grey selenium gives a yellow/orange solution, transitioning to intense black with increasing concentration, while that of the dissolved tellurium is dark brown (Fig. 1).
Both solutes give optically transparent solutions that are free of visible scattering. Grey selenium and tellurium were insoluble in either unary solvent of EtSH or en (at 25 °C, 1 atm), suggesting a strong cooperative solvent effect. It was found that the EtSH could be replaced with mercaptoethanol or 1,2-ethanedithiol to give marginally higher selenium solubility; however, the solubility of tellurium in these solvent mixtures was significantly lower (ESI†). Interestingly, replacement of EtSH by the closely related nPrSH or iPrSH alkanethiols gave clearly reduced tellurium solubility.

Saturated solutions of grey selenium and tellurium in EtSH and en were prepared under nitrogen and subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine the appropriate temperatures needed for recovery of the elemental form of the chalcogen. In these experiments, solutions were evaporated by in situ drying (5 °C min−1 to 125 °C, 20 min isothermal) and cooling to 30 °C prior to thermal analysis (10 °C min−1 to 360 °C for selenium or 410 °C for tellurium). The solid recovered via evaporation of the dissolved grey selenium solution shows a 31.2% mass loss from 30–250 °C, corresponding to loss of organic species from the dried solid (Fig. 2a). Further mass loss at higher temperatures is due to selenium evaporation, as verified by comparison to TGA of pure selenium (ESI†). Remarkably, the solid recovered via evaporation of the dissolved tellurium shows no mass loss (0%) from 30–400 °C (Fig. 2a). Saturated selenium and tellurium solutions in mercaptoethanol and en or 1,2-ethanedithiol and en were also analyzed by TGA, and were found to undergo broadly comparable thermolyses, with the notable exception of tellurium in 1,2-ethanedithiol and en. This combination appears to form an exceptionally stable complex, with thermolysis ending at ∼310 °C with a large observed mass loss of 61% (ESI†).

(b) FT-IR spectra for (i) dissolved selenium dried to a solid at room temperature, (ii) dissolved selenium dried to a solid and heated to 250 °C, and (iii) dissolved tellurium dried to a solid at room temperature. 
The decomposition of the dried solutes from the EtSH–en solution was also analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. A solution of grey selenium was dried at room temperature under a nitrogen flow. The resulting solid displayed strong ν(C–H) and ν(N–H) stretching bands at ∼3300–2800 cm−1, which are consistent with the presence of organic species from the solvent mixture (Fig. 2b). Thermolysis of the dried solid at 250 °C resulted in complete loss of the ν(C–H) and ν(N–H) stretching bands, corroborating the loss of organics by TGA (Fig. 2b). A slow nitrogen flow passed over the tellurium solution at room temperature resulted in growth of lustrous tellurium crystals within a few days (ESI†). The recovered tellurium displayed no bands in the IR characteristic of organic species, despite the absence of heat treatment (Fig. 2b).
The nature of the dissolved selenium species (36 wt% in EtSH–en) was probed using Raman and NMR spectroscopies. It was found that the addition of EtSH to en (1:4 vol/vol) qualitatively resulted in a large increase in electrolytic conductivity, suggesting extensive ion formation as has been observed in binary solvent mixtures of 1,2-ethanedithiol–en.16 Partial deprotonation of the thiol is supported by the observed loss of the sulfhydryl proton in the 1H NMR spectrum of the EtSH–en mixture (ESI†), in addition to the greatly reduced intensity of the S–H Raman band at ca. 2569 cm−1 upon mixing with en. Raman spectra of selenium dissolved in EtSH–en showed multiple bands (240, 277, 367, and 387 cm−1) in the region characteristic for the vibrational modes of selenium and sulfur (ESI†). The two bands at 240 and 277 cm−1 suggest the coexistence of selenium chains and rings, which can typically appear anywhere from 230–260 cm−1 and 250–275 cm−1, respectively, depending on the chemical environment.10,17 The remaining bands in the region from 360–390 cm−1 are assigned to S–Se stretching vibrations.18 For example, the band at 387 cm−1 likely corresponds to the Se–S stretching mode for an RSSe− anion.4c This evidence, in addition to the disappearance of the S–H band at ca. 2569 cm−1 upon selenium dissolution, leads to the conclusion that we have a heterogeneous system comprised of pure Se rings/chains and of mixed Se–S species generated by a nucleophilic thiolate.19

1H and 77Se NMR spectra of the dissolved selenium corroborate the Raman results (Fig. 3). The 1H NMR spectrum of selenium dissolved in EtSH–en shows broadened and upfield shifted resonances for the methyl and methylene protons of the thiol/thiolate relative to EtSH–en with no dissolved selenium. That is, the 1H NMR spectrum of the binary solvent mixture shows well-resolved resonances centered at δ 2.73 (q, CH2) and 1.48 (t, CH3) ppm for the thiol/thiolate; whereas, after selenium dissolution, the resonances shift upfield to δ 2.42 (CH2) and 1.22 (CH3) ppm. The change in chemical shift may result from bond formation between S and Se to form the EtSSe− anion suggested by Raman. This anion is known to form in thiolate solutions saturated with elemental selenium and undergoes exchange with polyselenide species.4c The 1H NMR resonances corresponding to en remain relatively sharp both before (δ 2.80 (CH2) and 1.93 (NH2/NH3+) ppm) and after (δ 2.70 (NH2/NH3+) and 2.65 (CH2) ppm) the addition of selenium, and the change in chemical shift is consistent with previous reports of selenium dissolved in en.6 The 77Se NMR spectrum of selenium dissolved in EtSH–en yields a single, broad resonance at δ 624 ppm. This resonance appears in a region from δ 550–750 ppm that is characteristic of eight-membered Se rings (i.e., cyclic Se8 melt has a 77Se chemical shift of δ 621 ppm).20 The broadness of the peak indicates that a moderately fast Se exchange is occurring in these solutions. Even faster exchange, observable on the Raman timescale (ca. 10−14 s) but not on the NMR timescale (10−1 to 10−6 s), may be responsible for the apparent lack of any other 77Se peaks related to the polymeric selenium species (which should appear in the region from 850–1050 ppm)20 and/or the EtSSe− anion.4c

1H and 77Se NMR spectra for a 36 wt% selenium solution in EtSH–en. The 1H NMR of the EtSH–en solvent system shows well-resolved resonances corresponding to the en and thiol. After selenium dissolution, the thiol resonances become broadened and shift upfield while the resonances corresponding to en remain relatively sharp. The 77Se NMR spectrum shows a single, broad resonance at a chemical shift generally assigned to cyclic Se compounds. 
Interestingly, the various selenium species generated by dissolution in EtSH–en converge back to crystalline grey selenium upon solvent evaporation and heat treatment. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that the grey selenium recovered from the EtSH–en solution was phase pure after thermolysis at 250 °C (Fig. 4a). The tellurium that was crystallized from EtSH–en at room temperature was also found to be phase pure, unlike the starting material, which contained a small proportion of TeO2 (Fig. 4b). The lattice parameters for the solution-recovered grey selenium (a = 4.35, c = 4.92 Å) and tellurium (a = 4.44, c = 5.88 Å) match the expected literature values (PDF #01-071-4647 and 03-065-3370, respectively). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to probe the compositional purity of selenium and tellurium recovered from the EtSH–en solution. The recovered selenium shows a trace of sulfur contamination from the thiol, quantified as ∼0.9 at%, while the recovered tellurium did not show any evidence of sulfur incorporation.

The asterisks show peaks corresponding to TeO2 impurity (PDF #01-071-4822) in the reference tellurium. 
Selenium was crystallized from mercaptoethanol–en and 1,2-ethanedithiol–en solutions by drying and thermolysis at 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively. XRD analysis of the crystallized materials in both cases revealed hexagonal grey selenium with no secondary phases (ESI†). Dissolved tellurium recovered from these solutions (150 °C for mercaptoethanol–en, 350 °C for 1,2-ethanedithiol–en) was also phase pure (ESI†). EDX data showed no detectable sulfur in the selenium recovered from either the mercaptoethanol–en or 1,2-ethanedithiol–en solvent mixtures; however, the tellurium contained 3–4 at% sulfur in both cases. Sulfur contamination in tellurium from mercaptoethanol–en may partly be a function of the low thermolysis temperature, but that cannot be the case for tellurium recovered at a much higher temperature from 1,2-ethanedithiol–en. In the latter case, the sulfur contamination is likely an unavoidable consequence of 1,2-ethanedithiol ligand decomposition during the high temperature, high mass loss event observed by TGA (vide supra).
To demonstrate the utility of selenium and tellurium solutions for the solution deposition of metal chalcogenides, simple reactions with main group elements were attempted. An orange Sb–Se precursor solution (ink) was readily prepared by stirring selenium dissolved in EtSH–en with elemental antimony in a 3:2 Se–Sb stoichiometry (60 °C, 2 h). The resulting Sb–Se precursor ink was stable at room temperature and appeared to be insensitive to light. Control experiments showed that antimony possessed negligible solubility and/or reactivity towards the EtSH–en solvent system in the absence of selenium. The Sb–Se ink can then be solution processed (e.g., by drop casting, spin coating, etc.) followed by heat treatment to recover Sb2Se3. To determine the temperature at which Sb2Se3 can be produced, the Sb–Se ink was dried in situ and analyzed by TGA (Fig. 5a). Mass loss from the dried solid was relatively low, amounting to 4% over the range from 30–250 °C. To ascertain the identity of the solid thermolysis product, the Sb–Se ink was dried, heat-treated to 250 °C, and then analyzed by XRD. The material was revealed to be phase-pure orthorhombic stibnite Sb2Se3, matching both an authentic reference sample and PDF #03-065-2433 (Fig. 5b). EDX corroborated the XRD results, giving a composition of 43 at% Sb and 57 at% Se (with no detectable sulfur impurities) for the Sb2Se3. The lack of sulfur contamination in the Sb2Se3 synthesized here contrasts favorably with previous results on bulk Sb2Se3 dissolved in 1,2-ethanedithiol–en and subsequently recovered by heat-treatment at 350 °C, where 2 at% sulfur contamination was observed.16 In a similar manner, a red Sn–Te precursor ink was generated by the reaction of elemental tin with tellurium dissolved in EtSH–en (60 °C, 3 h). Similar to elemental antimony, it was found that tin had negligible solubility in the neat EtSH–en solvent system without the presence of tellurium. TGA showed a 6% mass loss over the temperature range of 30–250 °C for the dried Sn–Te precursor (ESI†). The thermolysis product of the Sn–Te precursor heated to 250 °C was predominately cubic rock salt SnTe (PDF #03-065-0322); however, there was a fraction of elemental tellurium impurity present (ESI†). EDX corroborated the XRD results for SnTe, giving 41 at% Sn, 58 at% Te, and 1 at% S. The Sb–Se and Sn–Te inks in EtSH–en were amenable to solution processing by spin-coating, producing chalcogenide films of high visual and microscopic quality after heating (ESI†).

The formation of Sb–Se and Sn–Te inks were also tested using the mercaptoethanol–en solvent system. TGA of in situ dried solids indicated slightly higher mass losses at 250 °C for Sb–Se (∼7% mass loss) and at 350 °C for Sn–Te (∼17% mass loss) in this solvent system as compared to EtSH–en (ESI†). XRD indicated crystallization of phase-pure Sb2Se3 at 250 °C, but there was more free tellurium in the SnTe product (with 350 °C heat treatment) than when the EtSH–en solvent system was utilized (ESI†). By EDX, the Sb2Se3 appeared sulfur free, but the SnTe contained ca. 14 at% S. Therefore, EtSH–en appears to be the optimal solvent for these particular precursor inks.
Conclusions
The dissolution of elemental grey selenium and tellurium in novel solvent mixtures has been investigated. We have shown that binary thiol–en mixtures possess remarkable solvent ability for both grey selenium and tellurium, with EtSH–en giving a solvent mixture that possesses particularly favorable properties. Although the dissolved selenium was shown to consist of a range of species in solution, crystalline and phase-pure grey selenium can be recovered by moderate heat treatment at 250 °C. Tellurium can also be recovered from EtSH–en; however, in this case the crystalline and phase-pure chalcogen can be remarkably recovered by slow evaporation of the solvent mixture at room temperature. The availability of new solvent systems for grey selenium and tellurium offers new avenues for the solution deposition of inorganic chalcogenide materials. Along these lines, selenium and tellurium solutions were found to readily dissolve antimony and tin, respectively, to give stable Sb–Se and Sn–Te precursor inks that were easily solution processed to give crystalline Sb2Se3 and SnTe upon heat treatment at 250 °C. Given these results, we believe these new solvent systems to have considerable potential for the solution deposition of selenide and telluride semiconductors.
