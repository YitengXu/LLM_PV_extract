    , Accepted 19th February 2018First published on 27th February 2018AbstractTwo organic photovoltaic (OPV) donor materials (one polymer and one small molecule) are synthesized from the same constituent building blocks, namely thiophene units, cyclopentathiophene dione (CTD), and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT). Photobleaching dynamics of these donor materials are then studied under white light illumination in air with blends of PC70BM and the bis-trifluoromethylfullerene 1,7-C60(CF3)2. For both the polymer and small molecule blends, C60(CF3)2 stabilizes the initial rate of photobleaching by a factor of 15 relative to PC70BM. However, once the small molecule:C60(CF3)2 blend bleaches to ∼80% of its initial optical density, the rate of photobleaching dramatically accelerates, which is not observed in the analogous polymer blend. We probe that phenomenon using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to measure PL quenching efficiencies at defined intervals during the photobleaching experiments. The data indicates the small molecule donor and C60(CF3)2 acceptor significantly de-mix with time, after which the blend begins to bleach at approximately the same rate as the neat donor sample. The work suggests that perfluoroalkylfullerenes have great potential to stabilize certain OPV active layers toward photodegradation, provided their morphology is stable.
Three useful parameters for determining the efficacy of any solar energy technology include cost, efficiency, and lifetime.1 OPV technology, attractive for its lightweight, flexible, and transparent applications,2 has recently seen improvements in all three of these fronts: advances in roll-to-roll slot-die coating techniques are making the large-scale production of OPV modules more cost efficient;3 reports of lab-scale power conversion efficiencies for single-junction devices have now surpassed 13%,4 more than doubling in the previous decade; and several photobleaching studies5,6 have identified components of OPV donor materials and processing additives that should either be selected or avoided in order to improve photostability. While all of these accomplishments have been the product of a tremendous collective research effort across the field,7,8 the bulk of the OPV literature has been geared towards improving efficiencies rather than the long term stability of devices.9 Very few studies have been reported that provide guidance for designing OPV active layer components with improved intrinsic stability, despite the fact that such knowledge would go a long way towards improving the industrial viability of this technology.
One recent elegant study10 probing degradation mechanisms in OPV materials found that the rate of donor polymer photobleaching in blend films with 5 different fullerenes consistently correlated with the electron affinity (EA) of the fullerene, i.e., the larger the EA of the fullerene/deeper its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the more stable the polymer donor became towards photooxidation. This observation was explained by invoking a mechanism whereby both the polymer and fullerene donated photogenerated electrons to diatomic oxygen to form a superoxide radical anion that in turn was responsible for degrading the polymer. The study looked at fullerenes with EAs ranging from 3.77 eV to 4.07 eV, the latter belonging to PC60BM, which demonstrated the strongest stabilizing effect.
In previous work,11 we demonstrated that the photoconductance of a polymer:fullerene blend utilizing a polymer donor with a rather deep LUMO could be improved when PC60BM was exchanged with C60(CF3)2, which has a LUMO ∼200 meV deeper than PC60BM.12 We attributed the improvement in photoconductance to a more appropriate energy level offset between the donor and C60(CF3)2 that enhanced free charge generation efficiency. Here, we test the degree to which C60(CF3)2 can stabilize photodegradation of donor materials as a function of its stronger electron affinity. We developed two new donor materials for the study, one small molecule and one polymer, both synthesized from the same constituent building blocks, namely thiophene units, cyclopentathiophene dione (CTD), and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Small molecule and polymer donors synthesized for photobleaching studies. 
The small molecule (SM1) consists of a CPDT core positioned between two CTD units and is terminated on either side with bithiophenes. Its non-trivial synthesis is described in detail in the ESI.† Molecules possessing this type of framework have formed the basis of several high performance small molecule OPV systems.13–15 The CTD building block has been employed in low band gap copolymers16,17 for OPV applications but, to the best of our knowledge, has not been employed as a component of small molecule donor materials. After synthesizing SM1 and observing its intriguing photobleaching kinetics (vide infra) with C60(CF3)2, which suggested the donor and acceptor might phase separate on the time-scale of the photo-bleaching experiment, we then synthesized copolymer P1 from analogous components in an effort to probe how molecules more prone to chain entanglement might behave under the same conditions. While the optoelectronic properties of SM1 and P1 were not anticipated to be identical, different chemical functionalities and side chains can dramatically affect the stability of donor materials.6 Using the same constituent building blocks in SM1 and P1 should thus help minimize the number of variables that affect photobleaching dynamics in these systems.
The graphs of the normalized absorbance measured for chloroform solutions of SM1 and P1, as well as thin films on quartz substrates, are presented in Fig. 2. A comparison of the SM1 solution and film red-edge local λmax and λonset (recorded where the slope of the absorption edge crosses the baseline) reveals a red shift of 30–35 nm. By comparison, the absorbance spectrum of the P1 film appears to broaden, with the local λmax blue-shifting 10 nm and the λonset red shifting 30 nm, though the latter appears exaggerated by scattering. The results suggest that intermolecular interactions in the small molecule may be stronger overall than those in the polymer in the solid state. Cyclic voltammetry was utilized to evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the two materials in the solid state by drop casting films on a platinum electrode from 1 mg mL−1 solutions. Given that the redox processes were quasi-reversible at best (Fig. S10†), EHOMO was estimated from the onset potential. The results suggested that SM1 had a slightly deeper HOMO than P1 (−5.4 vs. −5.2 eV, respectively), though these values should be considered a relative comparison between the two materials and not necessarily taken as absolute measurements.

We then made blend films of donor:fullerene (1:1 by weight) using SM1, P1, PC70BM, and C60(CF3)2. Photodegradation of the neat and blend films was monitored using an automated photobleaching apparatus set to record the FA of these samples every 10 minutes during continuous illumination with a tungsten halogen bulb array in air. The lamp intensity was measured as approximately 120 mW cm−2. The surface temperature of the substrates was recorded as 65 °C. The apparatus is described in more detail in the ESI.†Fig. 3 highlights the power of the instrument, illustrating the degradation of P1 in a P1:C60(CF3)2 blend over 96 h as a function of 576 spectra auto-collected every 10 minutes.
 Fig. 3  Approximately 576 spectra of P1:C60(CF3)2 auto-recorded every 10 minutes over 96 hours during continuous illumination at 120 mW cm−2 (∼1.2 suns) in air with a tungsten halogen bulb array. Black dashed spectra were recorded at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. 
Over the course of the photobleaching experiments, the spectra of both SM1 and P1 exhibit a blue shift (see Fig. 3 and S4 and S5 in the ESI†), though the blue shift for the polymer is much more pronounced than for the small molecule. This behaviour has been observed in numerous conjugated organic polymer materials in the literature5 when they are photobleached and is consistent with a decrease in the average chromophore length of the material. In the left panel of Fig. 4, we illustrate the photobleaching kinetics of these systems as a function of time by plotting the normalized FA for each sample near their red-edge local maximum (that is, a kinetic slice at 656 nm for SM1 and 705 nm for P1). By quantifying the lamp irradiance data and converting it to photon flux (see eqn (S3) in the ESI†), we were further able to plot the normalized FA as a function of cumulative absorbed photons (right panel of Fig. 4). This approach accounts for changes in photon dosing as the optical densities of the film change over time. It thus effectively normalizes the photobleaching kinetics for films of different optical densities and further allows anomalies or changes in the photobleaching kinetics over the course of the experiment to be more easily identified and quantified.
 Fig. 4  Normalized fraction of absorbed light (FA) near the respective λmax of SM1 and P1 are plotted as a function of time (left panel) and as a function of the number of absorbed photons (right panel). 
The initial relative photostability of the samples was then compared by quantifying the number of absorbed photons required to bleach each sample to 80% of its initial maximum FA (P80). For SM1, the P80 for the neat and PC70BM blend were very similar (0.8 and 1.1 × 1020 absorbed photons, respectively). However, the SM1:C60(CF3)2 blend requires 15 times the number of absorbed photons (16 × 1020) before it bleaches to 80% of its initial FA.
The data for P1 are interesting in that PC70BM appears to promote photodegradation relative to the neat sample, while C60(CF3)2 stabilizes the polymer. Values of P80 for samples of neat, PC70BM, and C60(CF3)2 blends with P1 are 20, 2.4, and 36 × 1020 absorbed photons, respectively. Thus, while PC70BM accelerates photodegradation of P1 by almost a factor of 10, the blend with C60(CF3)2 again requires 15 times the number of absorbed photons to bleach to 80% of its initial FA relative to the blend with PC70BM, just as with SM1. Indeed, it has previously been observed in the literature that a fullerene with a smaller electron affinity can promote photodegradation while a fullerene with a higher electron affinity can inhibit it for the same polymer.10 The mechanism explaining why PC70BM accelerates photodegradation of P1 relative to the neat sample may involve photogenerated electrons on the fullerene10 or formation of an excited polymer triplet state that could subsequently sensitize reactive singlet oxygen.18 However, confirming either mechanism would require more detailed studies beyond the scope of this manuscript.
For both the neat SM1 and P1 samples, photobleaching kinetics are quite linear for the duration of the experiment until the samples are almost completely bleached (see the red traces in the right panel of Fig. 4). However, the photobleaching kinetics change in the blend samples beyond the P80 value and appear to undergo two distinct “stages” of bleaching. For three of the four blends, the rate of photobleaching slows after some time. This might be rationalized considering that blends are never perfectly homogeneous. We would expect domains of neat and blended regions to bleach at different rates, and once the faster bleaching domains are consumed, the bulk sample would simply appear to stabilize. However, the fact that the SM1 blend with C60(CF3)2 begins to bleach faster after it reaches 80% of its initial FA around 20 h into the experiment is an indication of its markedly different behaviour from the other samples. By the end of the experiment, this blend is bleaching at nearly the same rate as the neat sample, some 15 times faster than it was initially degrading.
We sought to explain this behaviour by probing whether SM1 and C60(CF3)2 were de-mixing with time. Such a phenomenon has been observed for other high performance OPV donor:fullerene blends under solar cell operating conditions.19 As small molecule donor crystallization is known to drive blend phase separation and dictate morphology,20 we initially attempted to use X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study crystallization of neat SM1 and its blends at several intervals during the photobleaching experiment. Unfortunately, all of the blend samples were completely amorphous from start to finish over 40 h of exposure under the lamps. However, if the neat and blend samples of SM1 were cast on quartz substrates and kept under an inert atmosphere in the dark for ∼2 months, they all developed crystalline peaks in the XRD patterns (see Fig. S11 in ESI†). These results provide some evidence that the degree of order in SM1 films is prone to changing with time.
We then indirectly probed changes in morphology over the course of the photobleaching experiments by monitoring the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the blends.21 If the donor and acceptor components were significantly de-mixing with time, this would presumably affect PL quenching by the fullerenes. Time-resolved PL measurements were employed as they potentially also provide information about static and dynamic quenching processes, but after conducting the measurements, the most interesting data came simply from quantifying changes in quenching efficiencies of the fullerenes at times 0, 15, and 41 h during the photobleaching experiments. The latter times were chosen as they marked intervals that both preceded and followed, respectively, the dramatic change in photobleaching kinetics for the SM1 blend with C60(CF3)2.
The PL decays in Fig. 5 were plotted by first normalizing for the number of scans and then for the fraction of absorbed light at the excitation wavelength (600 nm) in each sample. Integration of the initial SM1 PL data (see ESI† for full details of these calculations) for the neat and blend samples with C60(CF3)2 indicated that the trifluoromethylfullerene exhibited very strong initial quenching efficiency (>99%). After aging 15 h under the lamps, this efficiency dropped only slightly to 98%. However, between 15 and 41 h, the time during which the photobleaching rate began to sharply accelerate, quenching efficiency dropped to 90%. Fig. 5 illustrates the PL decays as a function of time for these aged blends, from which the change in quenching efficiency is clearly evident (compare the red trace with the green and black traces). The photobleaching kinetics thus appear fully consistent with the PL quenching data that suggest SM1 and C60(CF3)2 de-mix over time. By comparison, the SM1:PC70BM blend initially only displayed 96% quenching efficiency. After 15 h of aging, efficiency does drop to 93%; however, between 15 and 41 h, quenching efficiency does not change significantly (93 to 92%, see Fig. S8†). The results suggest that PC70BM may also slightly de-mix from SM1 during the photobleaching experiment, although not to the same degree as C60(CF3)2, and on a shorter time scale.

Finally, we measured the photoconductance of the films using time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) in lieu of making OPV devices. Contactless photoconductivity has previously been used by our group22–24 and others25,26 to study the dynamics of free carrier generation and decay in bulk heterojunctions of OPV donors with fullerene acceptors, and it has been shown how TRMC can be used as a versatile method to screen the potential of new photovoltaic materials by predicting the upper limits of attainable device efficiencies.17,26,27 We present the general methodology for TRMC in the ESI.† In short, the TRMC figure of merit (ϕΣμ) measured during the experiment is a product of the quantum efficiency of free carrier generation per photon absorbed (ϕ) and the sum of the mobilities of electrons and holes (Σμ). The ability of the absorber material to efficiently generate long-lived free charge carriers under illumination in a bulk heterojunction film can also dramatically affect ultimate device performance,28,29 thus making TRMC an efficient screening tool for several device relevant characteristics.
After evaluating all six neat and blend samples used in this study with TRMC, the results can be summarized as follows: at a constant flux of ∼5 × 1014 photons per cm2 per pulse, the TRMC figure of merit (ϕΣμ) for neat P1 and P1 blends with PC70BM and C60(CF3)2 is 0.1, 0.9 and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. For neat SM1 and SM1 blends with PC70BM and C60(CF3)2, ϕΣμ is 0.08, 0.8 and 0.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. On one hand, these values are several orders of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art materials in the literature, which therefore suggests these donor materials are unlikely to make record efficiency OPV devices. However, the significant results here are (1) that ϕΣμ for all the blends increases roughly one order of magnitude over the neat samples, and (2) the magnitude of ϕΣμ in analogous blends of PC70BM and C60(CF3)2 are quite similar (the signal for C60(CF3)2 is slightly higher than PC70BM with P1 and slightly lower with SM1). The results suggest that while these donor materials may not ultimately make high efficiency devices, the trifluoromethylfullerene C60(CF3)2 has the potential to perform as well as PC70BM in devices with high efficiency donors while additionally offering improved photostability.
Conclusions
The most important conclusion from this work is that C60(CF3)2 can stabilize the rate of OPV donor material photooxidation by a factor of 15 relative to more traditional fullerene acceptors like PC70BM. For the polymer donor in our study, that stabilization persisted over the course of the photobleaching experiment, but for the small molecule donor, the rate of photobleaching dramatically accelerated following an initial period of stabilization by C60(CF3)2. PL quenching measurements suggested that the small molecule and C60(CF3)2 significantly de-mix with time. The work suggests that perfluoroalkylfullerenes have great potential to stabilize certain OPV active layers toward photodegradation, provided their morphology is stable with time. To overcome the latter problem, we are currently focusing on additional strategies involving side-chain engineering30 to improve miscibility of donor materials with perfluoroalkylfullerenes, including those with significantly stronger electron affinities than C60(CF3)2.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Small molecule and polymer donors synthesized for photobleaching studies.	 

 	Fig. 2  Normalized absorbance measured for solutions (CHCl3) and thin films of SM1 (top) and P1 (bottom).	 

 	Fig. 3  Approximately 576 spectra of P1:C60(CF3)2 auto-recorded every 10 minutes over 96 hours during continuous illumination at 120 mW cm−2 (∼1.2 suns) in air with a tungsten halogen bulb array. Black dashed spectra were recorded at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.	 

 	Fig. 4  Normalized fraction of absorbed light (FA) near the respective λmax of SM1 and P1 are plotted as a function of time (left panel) and as a function of the number of absorbed photons (right panel).	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoluminescence decays for un-aged neat SM1 film (blue) as well as 1:1 blends of SM1:C60(CF3)2 aged for 0, 15, and 41 h (black, green, and red, respectively) in air at ∼1.2 suns.
