    , Accepted 21st January 2014First published on 22nd January 2014AbstractDuring the past decade, organic electronics has attracted a great deal of interest due to its applicability in a wide range of applications and high potential for commercial success. These applications notably range from organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) to organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and sensors. Organic diodes undoubtedly have the potential to redefine many present day lighting solutions if performances and device stability are significantly improved. In these different applications, materials which combine in one molecule a balanced hole and electron transport are currently under intensive research as these materials can ensure an effective exciton recombination or dissociation within the active layer. Over the years, several basic structures have received the attention of researchers for the design of these appealing materials, namely triphenylamines (TPA) and oxadiazoles (OXD) that can respectively act as the hole-transporting and electron-transporting moieties in these ambipolar materials. This review aims at reporting the different OXD–TPA hybrids that have been synthesized to date and to develop a systematic understanding of the structure–property–performance relationships.

1. Introduction
Organic electronics is a rapidly evolving field of research with a wide range of applications including OLEDs to OPVs and sensors. Although enormous progresses have been made recently in the research and the development of new materials, optimization in terms of device performance, cost-cutting and device durability is still required to fulfill the requirements of successful commercialization. To address these issues, the key ingredient is an in-depth and extensive knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the different materials involved in the device fabrication and a due understanding of the factors influencing the device performance such as the metal/organic and the organic/organic interfaces effects and/or phase segregations. The mobility of holes versus electrons is a long-standing issue for materials used in the field of organic electronics. For OLEDs devices, carrier injection and carrier transport of opposite signs should be balanced to favor charge recombination within the emissive layer. If only one type of charge carrier is preferentially injected and transported, recombination of the opposite charges is shifted out of the emissive layer, lowering the device efficiency. One way to improve the device performances and to favour the recombination of the confined excitons within the active layer can be made through either selecting an emitting layer with ambipolar transport characteristics1 or phosphorescent emitters with host materials exhibiting balanced electron and hole mobilities.2 To design these ambipolar molecules, a vast number of potential building blocks have been explored over the years and notably triphenylamines and oxadiazoles that could respectively act as hole-transporting and electron-transporting materials. At present, triphenylamine derivatives have been the most widely used hole-transporting materials as they are excellent hole-transport materials, as typical examples (4,4′,4′′-tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-phenylamino)triphenylamine (m-MTDATA), 4,4′,4′′-tris(N,N-diphenylamino)triphenylamine (TDTA), tri(p-terphenyl-4-yl)amine (p-TTA), 1,3,5-tris(4-diphenylamino-phenyl)benzene (TDAPB))3 exhibit a three-dimensional propeller structure that can effectively avoid molecular aggregation and possess an excellent thermal stability.4 Presence of this functional group in the molecular structures of the hole-transporting layer (HTL) is also well-reported to improve the solution processability of the materials in which this group is introduced.5 Similarly, oxadiazole derivatives have enjoyed widespread use as electron-transporting and hole-blocking materials due to the electron-withdrawing nature of this aromatic heterocycle molecule with a relatively high electron mobility that can facilitate the injection and transport of electrons,6 along with thermal and chemical stability7 and photoluminescence.8 Extensive works have been devoted to the design of charge transport materials that exhibit both comparable hole and electron mobilities by integrating the two molecules within a single material. Based on chemical engineering, a wide range of OXD–TPA hybrids have been designed and synthesized. From the standpoint of generating stable devices, synthesis of materials exhibiting high glass transition temperatures (Tg) gives the insurance that no phase transition will occur upon operation. This parameter is of crucial importance especially if these molecules are used as hosts. Molecules with high Tg values can be easily obtained with a suitable molecular design. To combine the advantages of ease of fabrication and low production cost, solution-processable small molecules and polymeric bipolar materials have also been developed as an attractive alternative to the incumbent vapor deposition process. The present review summarizes the different TPA–OXD hybrids that have been synthesized to date. Ambipolar materials have been divided into two main categories directly linked to their molecular weight, namely small-molecules and polymeric materials as the deposition process is intimately related to the nature of the bipolar materials.
2. Small-molecule based bipolar materials
2.1. Bipolar materials in OLEDs
Small molecules with a bipolar transporting character are extremely attractive as they offer the possibility to deposit different layers by vacuum deposition or by solution processing techniques. Derivatives containing a hole-transporting triphenylamine and an electron-transporting 1,3,4-oxadiazole unit while maintaining their sublimation properties have triggered a great deal of interest for the construction of heterojunction multilayered devices due the possibility to finely tuning the mobility between holes and electrons. In view of the electronic processes involved in solar cells (charge separation) or in OLEDs (charge recombination), materials used within the active layer must possess a bipolar nature. In order to achieve the right balance in the transport of the two opposite charge carriers, many structural variables could be taken into consideration. Triphenylamine (TPA) is well-reported to possess a high triplet energy (3.04 eV) and good hole-transporting ability.9 The first combinations of triphenylamine and 1,3,4-oxadiazole moieties as ambipolar carrier transports for optoelectronic applications were reported in 1997 by Tamoto et al. who synthesized several interesting materials which were tested as emitters in multilayered OLEDs.10
In this pioneering work, introduction of arylamines into the amine–oxadiazole dyads 1–5 was found to be highly beneficial for the injection of holes into the materials while retaining the electron-transporting capability (see Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of bipolar small molecules 1–6. 
In particular, use of hole-transporting materials with a low ionization potential was determined as favoring a better balance between hole and electron transport. When incorporated in the emitter, association of triphenylamine and oxadiazole were expected to improve the bipolar character of the emitter and thus to enhance the electroluminescence characteristics. In particular, improvement of the charge transport ability of the emitter was also expected to avoid the formation of exciplexes and to enhance light emission. Emitters with bipolar characters are also expected to limit exciplex formation. Among the five emitters reported by Tamoto et al., the starburst molecule 5 exhibited the highest Tg of the series, followed by 1 exhibiting a hexafluoropropane group as the linking unit (see Table 1). Comparison of 2, 3 and 4 clearly provided evidence to support that the substitution pattern deeply affects the thermal properties, where the highest Tg was observed for 2 (possessing the linear structure). All compounds formed amorphous glassy films under vacuum deposition and were tested as emitters for OLEDs. When investigated in various multilayered device structures, the emission efficiency was determined as being strongly impacted by the possible exciplex formation between the emitters and the hole transport materials.

Still with aim of balancing charge carrier mobility by constructing chemical structures containing hole- and electron-transport moieties, an extended starburst molecule 6 was later reported, comprising three oxadiazoles interlinked to the central triphenylamine via a vinylene unit.11 Its glass transition temperature was determined as being 168 °C, close to the temperature determined for 5 (>160 °C) (see Table 1). When used as an emitter in single layer light-emitting diodes, green light-emitting devices were obtained with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.0 × 10−2%. The performance of this molecule was assigned to the perfect balance existing between its hole mobility (μh = 1.4 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.36 MV cm−1) and its electron mobility (μe = 0.98 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.36 MV cm−1). This investigation clearly demonstrated the crucial importance of correctly designing the structures to achieve the right balance in carrier mobilities.
Apart from these few examples of starburst molecules, a wide range of linear or bent-shape emitters were also designed and synthesized (see Fig. 2). As first examples of combinations, the simplest ones consisted in the linkage of a triphenylamine and an oxadiazole moiety as exemplified with the molecules 7–12.12 Especially, the influence of the electron-donating or electron-releasing groups on the thermal and electrochemical properties and on the device performance was investigated. As a first influence, the thermal stability of the different triphenylamine–oxadiazole dyads proved to be strongly affected by the substitution pattern. Notably, CF3-substituted derivatives 8, 10 and 12 displayed lower glass transitions compared to that obtained with the tert-butyl analogues 7 and 9 and remained in the range 85–129 °C (see Table 1). Within the series, the highest Tg was obtained for 11. Electrochemical properties were also modified by the substitution pattern. Inspection of their HOMO and LUMO levels by cyclic voltammetry provided evidence that these molecules were only capable of functioning as hole transporters despite the presence of both hole and electron transporting moieties in their scaffolds (see Table 2). Notably, a large energy barrier with the cathode could be observed, negatively impacting the electron injection. As a result of the presence of the electron-deficient CF3 group on the oxadiazole moiety, the electron-accepting ability was significantly enhanced. On the other hand, the presence of the electron-withdrawing nitrile group on the carbazole moiety significantly reduced the electron-donating ability of the carbazole group and strongly destabilized the HOMO level, resulting in a better matching with the anode level (see Table 2). Two device configurations were investigated i.e., ITO/7–12 (40 nm)/TPBI (40 nm)/Mg:Ag and ITO/7–12 (40 nm)/Alq3 (40 nm)/Mg:Ag for devices I and II, respectively. Devices prepared using the first configuration (device I) were characterized by electroluminescence (EL) spectra that superimpose the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the emitters, indicating the excitons to be effectively confined within the emissive layer. Exciton confinement within the emissive layer was notably obtained by the higher energy difference between the HOMOs than the LUMOs, maintaining holes in the hole-transporting layer (HTL). A completely different behavior was obtained with the second configuration (device II). Formation of excitons within both the emissive and the electron-transporting layer resulted in a dual emission issued from a mismatch between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the HTL and the ETL. Emission only originating from the electron-transporting layer Alq3 could even be observed for devices II prepared with 9. While when adding a hole blocking layer (BCP), the emission of Alq3 could be suppressed (device III, ITO/7–12 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/Mg:Ag) but a reduction of the device performance could be jointly observed.

Finally, insertion of a hole-transporting layer (NPB) between ITO and the emitters (device IV, ITO/NPB (40 nm)/7–12 (30 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/Mg:Ag) was beneficial to the overall device performances and one order of magnitude higher could be gained. In particular, higher performances obtained with all CF3-derivatives were assigned to the hole blocking and the electron transporting abilities of the fluorine atoms.13
Previous to this study, another series of green and yellow electroluminescent dipolar carbazole-based derivatives 7, 13–18 was investigated by the same authors.14 In this work, a careful comparison between disubstituted carbazole derivatives and monosubstituted analogues was established. As a first influence, the disubstitution of the carbazole moiety (13, 15) led to a significant enhancement of the Tg values compared to that of the monosubstituted analogues (7, 14) (see Table 1). A similar trend was observed when a pyrene moiety was incorporated into the scaffold (molecule 18). When tested in electroluminescent devices, carbazole derivatives proved to behave better as hole-carriers than electron-transporters. Two double-layer device configurations involving the use of TPBI or Alq3 as the electron-transporting layer and carbazole derivatives as the hole-transporting layer were designed. Similar behaviors to that observed for 7–12 were observed. As observed for TPBI-based devices, the high interfacial energy barriers existing between TPBI and HTL (∼1.1 eV) impeded the crossing of holes into TPBI and the recombination takes place inside HTL. On the other hand, the energy barriers for a hole and electron to enter TPBI and HTL, respectively, were similar and charge recombination could be observed within the two layers. As a second influence of the substitution pattern, monosubstituted derivatives exhibited higher performances in devices when compared with their disubstituted homologues. Interruption of the hole transport path in 13 and 15 by the presence of the hole-blocking oxadiazole was suggested to explain the lower performance. For emitters 7, 13–16, TPBI devices exhibited brighter light outputs and performances than Alq3-based devices. The opposite phenomenon was observed with 17 and 18, both of which exhibited higher performances with Alq3-based devices. Noticeably, these two emitters are substituted with a pyrene moiety that lowers the LUMO and favors the electron injection from Alq3, which in turn enhances the overall device performance (see Table 2). This study provided clear evidence that substantial gains in term of performance can be achieved by subtle changes in the structural design of the host material and the judicious choice of the electron-transport material.
Recently, a series of HTL comprising a thiophene unit as an end group was developed.15 In particular, the thiophene unit is well-reported to enhance the overall thermal stability of the compounds in which this heterocycle is introduced.16 The choice of this group was notably motivated by previous reports mentioning its ability to transport either holes,17 electrons18 or behaving as a bipolar carrier.19 Enhancement of the thermal stability of 19–21 compared to similar molecules without a thiophene unit was evidenced and Tg values above 55 °C were obtained (see Table 1). However, if a significant increase of the Tg could be obtained for all emitters comprising the thiophene unit, as a main drawback, the presence of this thiophene fragment resulted in a dramatic decrease of the long-term device stability, assigned to the reactivity of the thiophene units upon exposure to a high electrical field.20 Only molecule 20 was tested as an emitter, this molecule being the only one capable of assuming both the roles of a hole- and electron-transporting material. When 20 was examined as an emitter, the device performances were determined as being strongly dependent of the film thickness and the best performances were obtained with the thicker devices. In particular, a shift of the hole–electron recombination zone from near the electrode toward the film center was clearly evidenced with increasing of the thickness. The usefulness of 21 as a hole-transporting layer was also demonstrated in a bilayer configuration ITO/20/21/Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm) where the pyrene unit was introduced as the end group of the triad 2121 to serve as the emitter segment. A brightness as high as 7476 cd m−2 and a maximum current efficiency of 2.3 cd A−1 could be obtained (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Ambipolar molecules 19–32. 
In particular, comparisons with well-known hole-transporting materials proved 20 to be a better material than usual molecules, such as N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB). Notably, if a maximum brightness of 3000 cd m−2 was only reached with NPB as the hole-transport layer, a maximum brightness of 7476 cd m−2 was obtained under similar conditions with 20.21b Among all the OXD–TPA hybrids reported in the literature, combination of an OXD with two TPA was among the most widely studied. If numerous symmetric combinations have been synthesized, to date no asymmetric molecules have been reported.22 Generally speaking, most of these molecules have been designed for two complementary applications. The first one relies on the emissive properties of these molecules. Notably, the substitution positions relative to the oxadiazole ring were determined as strongly influencing the emission color, the nature of the intramolecular charge transfer as well as the triplet energy level. Notably, twisted 24 exhibited a lower LUMO (2.60 vs. 2.41 eV), a lower Tg (116 vs. 94 °C) and a blue-shifted emission (454 vs. 467 nm) relative to the linear 23 (see Tables 1 and 2).22b While examining their emissive properties in a multilayered device ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/NPB (80 nm)/23 or 24 (20 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), the charge-transfer or excimer emission could be efficiently avoided with 24 since a single EL peak could be obtained at 453 nm. Alternatively, 23 displayed a main peak at 459 nm with a low energy shoulder at 520 nm. The two compounds displayed high triplet energy levels (2.35 and 2.46 eV for 23 and 24, respectively) so that the two molecules could also act as appropriate bipolar host materials for orange or red dopants. When used as hosts for [(piq)2Ir(acac)] as a dopant, the best performances were obtained with the twisted molecule 24 and a maximum brightness of 24416 cd m−2 was reached at 14.9 V. Finally, by utilizing the dual roles of 23 as a blue emitter and as a host for a red dopant, a white OLED could be obtained by reducing the concentration of [(piq)2Ir(acac)] from 6 to 0.1 wt%. Twisted molecule 24 was recently revisited as a host for red, green and yellow emitters.23 In particular, the authors previously investigated a similar host bearing carbazoles24 instead of TPA as ends groups and a comparison was established between the results obtained with the two hosts. The applicability of 24 as a universal host material for green to red dopants was studied in detail. Comparison of the device performances prepared with the carbazole-based host and the TPA-based host provided evidence of a significant enhancement of the overall performances in terms of maximal brightness, power and current efficiencies as well as EQE when 24 was used as a host. Excellent performances were obtained for all dopants and by varying the thickness and the respective choice of the hole and electron-injection layers, a current efficiency as high as 85.7 cd A−1, a power efficiency of 99.9 lm W−1 and a maximum brightness of 48613 cd m−2 at 11.7 V were obtained with (ppy)2Ir(acac) as dopant.
Comparisons were later established with a series of ortho- and para-linked hybrids (23, 25–27).22c In this series, hybrids differ from 24 through different linkages established between the triphenylamine and oxadiazole moieties. By breaking the conjugation between TPA and OXD and inducing a large torsion, twisted molecules 25 and 27 displayed less intramolecular charge transfer, blue-shifted emission, a wider energy gap, and a higher triplet energy as compared to their linear congeners 23 and 26, respectively. When tested as hosts for a red dopant [(piq)2Ir(acac)], the results showed the twisted molecules to more efficiently host the emitter. Higher performances were assigned to the higher triplet energy of 25 and 27, resulting in better energy transfer form the host to the guest. Similarly, the higher triplet energy levels of 25 and 27 could efficiently prevent the reverse energy transfer from guest to hosts and thus enhance the device performances. When used as a host for the yellow emitter Ir(ppy)3, compound 27 excelled in terms of brightness and external quantum efficiency and a maximum brightness of 48743 cd m−2 at 15.3 V, a maximum current efficiency as high 70.8 cd A−1, and a maximum power efficiency of 66.5 lm W−1, corresponding to an EQE of 19.6% could be reached. These performances are among the highest ever reported for TPA–OXD hybrids used as hosts. The highest current efficiency was undoubtedly obtained with 28 as a host for green and red emitters.22d In particular, this molecule was capable of acting as a host for solution-processable PhOLEDs. In fact, this molecule constitutes a unique example of OXD–TPA hybrids used for the fabrication of PhOLEDs by a wet process. The unique design consisting of the meta-linkage of the two TPA relative to the OXD ring enabled the suppression of all conjugation between the two moieties, leading to the complete separation of the HOMO level that was maintained on the TPA moiety and the LUMO level that remained localized on the OXD moiety. Notably, the HOMO level of TPO (5.19 eV) was determined as being close to those obtained for PEDOT:PSS (5.20 eV), thus allowing an efficient hole injection from the anode (see Table 2). When tested as a host for a red dopant in the stacked device ITO/PEDOT:PSS (80 nm)/28:(PPQ)2Ir(acac) (5 wt%, 80 nm)/TPBI (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), it exhibited performances comparable to that obtained with solution-processed PhOLEDs prepared with commercially available hosts.25 The bipolar transport feature of 28 was evidenced with the green triplet emitter Ir(ppy)3. The low roll-off value obtained in the same device configuration evidenced the excitons to be evenly distributed through the emissive layer and thus the bipolar characteristics of the host to be demonstrated. A series of molecules that could be easily complexed to metal cations by the presence of a phenylpyridine end-group was also studied.26 Interestingly, molecules 29–31 were characterized by a high thermal stability as decomposition temperatures as high as 456 and 466 °C were respectively determined for 29 and 30 (see Table 1). The emissions of 29–31 were sensitive to the para-substitution on the Ar2N group. The emission wavelengths were affected by the electronic withdrawing or releasing properties of R and varied from 472 nm for 29 to 537 nm for 31. The electroluminescent behaviors of 29–31 in OLED devices were examined in the following configuration: ITO/CuPc (15 nm)/TPD (40 nm)/29–31/Ca (30 nm)/Al (80 nm). For all devices, the EL emission was observed at 464, 480 and 508 nm for 29, 30 and 31, respectively, which is consistent with each of their corresponding PL spectra. Color tuning was made feasible by the appropriate substitution of the triphenylamine moiety. With the absence of any electron-transporting layer in these devices, the ability of 29–31 to act as an ETL was also demonstrated. The final control consisted of the fabrication of devices without any HTL. These simplified devices displayed performances akin to those of devices comprising an HTL. Finally, the best performances ever reported with OXD–TPA hybrids were obtained while using the m-TPA-o-OXD isomer 32, which was formed by connecting the meta-position of a phenyl ring in triphenylamine with the ortho-position of 2,5-biphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole.27 This matrix proved to be an exceptional host for green, yellow-emissive guests. Thanks to the two triphenylamine moieties attached at both ends of the molecule, a high triplet energy level of 2.51 eV was obtained, enabling this molecule to host green to red phosphorescent emitters. The high triplet energy of m-TPA-o-OXD 32 is notably issued from the two TPA exhibiting a high triplet energy (3.04 eV).28 The HOMO level (5.21 eV) of m-TPA-o-OXD, which is close to the usual HIL NPB (5.4 eV), also ensured a low hole-injection barrier between m-TPA-o-OXD and NPB (1,4-bis[(1-naphthyl-phenyl)amino]biphenyl) (see Table 2). The new compound was evaluated in typical device architectures ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/NPB (80 nm)/32:(ppy)2Ir(acac) (9 wt%, 20 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). A maximum current efficiency (ηc,max) of 76.7 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency (ηp,max) of 77.9 lm W−1, a turn-on voltage of 2.9 V and a maximum external quantum efficiency (ηEQE,max) of 19.7% were obtained in the initial tests (see Table 1). Subsequent to these initial results, the fabrication process was improved and simplified by using TPBI instead of Alq3/LiF. While keeping the same thickness (40 nm), an enhancement of the device performance was obtained and ηc,max of 84.5 cd A−1 at a luminance of 48230 cd m−2, ηp,max of 84.2 lm W−1 and an ηEQE,max of 21.7% were attained. The higher EL performances of the TPBI-based devices over the BCP-based devices were ascribed to the higher LUMO level of TPBI (2.7 eV) compared to that of BCP (3.2 eV), lowering the energy barrier and facilitating electron injection from the cathode. The higher electrons of TPBI compared to NPB may also facilitate the electron current and thus improve the device performance. A higher confinement of the excitons could also be obtained by the higher triplet energy level of TPBI, and non-radiative recombination through energy transfer from the emissive excited state of (ppy)2Ir(acac) (2.41 eV) to the triplet state of ETL. Similar trends were observed while using the green triplet emitter Ir(ppy)3 or the yellow-emitter (fbi)2Ir(acac).
The inverse strategy of linking one or more OXD units to one TPA unit was also investigated and the different molecules obtained using this approach are presented in the Fig. 4.29 Interestingly, the thermal stability and the glass transition temperatures were determined as being in the same temperature range to that previously obtained for the various OXD–TPA hybrids comprising one OXD for several TPA units. If the thermal properties are not modified, an increase in the number of OXD units was demonstrated to negatively impact the photophysical properties of these new hybrids. Thus, the PL of 36 was red-shifted by 21 nm from 529 nm to 550 nm for 35 and 37, respectively. Electrochemical investigations also evidenced a destabilization of the LUMO levels with an increasing the number of OXD, while the HOMO levels remained unchanged (see Table 2 for values). While examining their optical properties, the PL spectra of molecules 33–37 exhibited strong positive solvatochromism with the polarity of the solvent, evidencing a strong charge redistribution upon photoexcitation.30 On the other hand, no solvatochromism was observed in the absorption spectra, indicating that these molecules exhibit a weak dipole moment in the ground state.
 Fig. 4  Ambipolar molecules 33–37. 
When tested in single layer devices, an increase of the number of OXD units resulted in a significant imbalance between the hole- and electron-transport properties of the ambipolar molecules, lowering device performances. The respective hole- and electron-transporting abilities of the different materials were examined by designing heterojunction devices where the different materials acted successively as the hole- or electron-transporting layer.
When introduced in the stacked devices as HTL, a decrease in the hole-transport property due to an increase in the hole-blocking oxadiazole units could be clearly observed. The maximum brightness notably decreased from 9720 cd m−2 for 36 to 3380 cd m−2 for 37 (see Table 1). Unexpectedly, a low ability of these materials to efficiently act as electron-transporting layers was observed with the second series of devices, even if a higher electron-transport ability was expected by increasing the number of OXDs.
Finally, various bipolar triphenylamine–oxadiazole hybrids including emitting spacers between the two OXD and TPA moieties were also investigated as electroluminescent dyes for OLEDs. In this field, 38 was the first push–pull molecule to be published, which comprises a fluorene unit as the emitting fragment in between the two charge carriers.31 Even if the performances obtained during this first study were moderate (498 cd m−2 at 25 V), this approach was a few years later extended to π-extended structures varying in their scaffolds by the juxtaposition and the combination of OXD, TPA and fluorine units.32 Even if some of these molecules were obtained in multistep syntheses, whatever the substitution pattern was, no real modification of the EQE could be observed for the single layer devices. Only a variation of the emission color could be obtained.
These studies were extended to dendrimer-like molecules differing from the former ambipolar molecules 38–42 (Fig. 5) by the substitution pattern of the fluorene unit.33 The main interest of molecule 43 (Fig. 6) relies on the fact that this molecule is a solution-processable host material. This molecule exhibits a specific design, namely the TPA central core is substituted on each aromatic ring by a fluorene unit whose one is substituted by an OXD. As a result, the three-dimensional and asymmetric structure of 43 suppresses its crystallizability leading to an amorphous material. In particular, a very high Tg was determined for this material (207 °C), which is the highest reported in this review (see Table 1). To assess the utility of 43 as a host material in OLEDs, white PhOLEDs were designed by doping 43 with a blue-emitting complex (FIrpic, 14 wt%) and a red-emitting complex (Os(fppz), 0.1 wt%). A fairly pure white OLED with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.37, 0.39) at 11 V was realized. The emission color was determined as remaining almost constant with the driving voltage.
 Fig. 5  Ambipolar molecules 38–42. 
 Fig. 6  Ambipolar molecules 43–45. 
A turn-on voltage of 5.9 V and a maximum brightness of 20280 cd m−2 were achieved in this configuration. Devices with high performances were obtained (EQE equal to 11.6%) and the high efficiency was assigned to the presence of both electron-rich TPA and electron-deficient OXD units in 43 and the short triplet excited lifetime of Os(fppz), preventing undesired triplet–triplet annihilation. The balanced charge-transport ability of the ladder-type pentaphenylene molecules 44 and 45 was determined as being highly dependent on the substitution pattern.34 Notably, the donor–acceptor interactions were determined as being very dependent on the nature of the connectivity existing between the OXD–TPA moieties and the main pentaphenylene chain. When substituted on the opposite sides of the π-conjugated pentaphenylene chromophore (45), photoluminescence with long lifetimes typical of exciplex-like species were observed. On the other hand, substitution of TPA at both ends of the conjugated spacer (44) furnished a blue/green photoluminescent material that exhibited the best ability to act as an ambipolar material. In order to investigate the basic carrier-transport properties of the materials, a solution-processed device was designed.
The device stacking was the following: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/44 (30 nm)/Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm). Surprisingly, the device displayed extremely low performances. Only surface brightness values in the range of 10–100 cd m−2 at relatively high driving voltages (5–10 V) were obtained (see Table 1). This relative counter-performance was ascribed to the low viscosity of the oligomer solutions, resulting in the deposition of very thin films. As a result, the device performances were affected by the presence of “pin holes” that considerably reduced the current to-light conversion
2.2. Bipolar materials in OPVs
Ambipolar character of the materials is also important for other applications than light-emitting devices. However, a careful survey of the literature evidences that these properties have only been scarcely explored for other applications. In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), only one article mentions the use of an OXD–TPA hybrid molecule as a sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).35 Metal-free organic dye sensitizers are highly researched due to their high molar absorption coefficients, facile molecular design and their simple and relatively inexpensive preparations. TPA possesses an easy oxidizable amine nitrogen atom and this chromophore is well-known for its hole-transport ability. In order to enhance the light harvesting of DSSCs not only in short wavelength spectral region where TPA has very weak absorption, formation of a push–pull molecule by joining an OXD to TPA ensured to extend the absorption range by the electronic delocalization.
All the dyes 46–50 (Fig. 7) exhibited a negative solvatochromism, indicating that the molecules have smaller dipole moments in the excited state than in the ground state. This unexpected behavior was ascribed to the partial deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group in the excited state.36 The best device efficiency (3.21%) was reached with 49, which possesses a bulky tert-butyl substituent. The higher performance of 49 over 46–48 and 50 was ascribed to the suppression of the molecular aggregation with this substituent, that in turn prevents the intermolecular energy transfer.
 Fig. 7  Ambipolar molecules 46–50. 
2.3. Bipolar materials for PL investigations
If the ambipolar nature of these molecules is researched by designing such a combination of OXD and TPA, a couple of reports have simply been devoted to investigate the thermal and the PL properties of these molecules, as exemplified in the Fig. 8. For the purpose of balancing the charge-carriers' transport, a unique combination can be obtained if the two molecules are associated with phenanthrolines, which are well-known to exhibit hole-blocking and electron-transporting properties. This unique architecture was recently proposed by Bing and coworkers,37 who developed two distinct procedures to access proligands 51 and 52. Especially, ligand 51 was prepared by the conventional reaction of a tetrazole with an electrophile,38 whereas 52 was obtained by the Radziszewski imidazole synthesis39 consisting of the reaction of a 1,2-dicarbonyl compound,40 an aldehyde and ammonia to form the imidazole ring. Even though the two proligands were not complexed with metals or even tested in devices, the influence of the conjugated bridge between the two partners was clearly evidenced by means of the emission color, which shifted from red for 51 (λem = 635 nm, ϕ = 0.4) to blue (λem = 461 nm, ϕ = 0.78) for 52 accompanied by a strong enhancement of its emission quantum yield. Control of the emission color was notably assigned to a higher electronic delocalization throughout the six-membered pyrazine ring compared to the five-membered imidazole spacer. A more blue emission could be obtained by slightly modifying the design of the OXD–TPA hybrid.41 With the aim of developing a wide bandgap material, 53 exhibited a strong blue fluorescence (λem = 436 nm) with a high quantum yield of luminescence (ϕ = 0.91) (see Table 1). As a main drawback, introduction of the alkyl tail strongly impacted the Tg, which was determined to be as low as 27 °C. Molecular wires (54 and 55) displaying an OXD and TPA at both ends of a conjugated and rigid spacer were also designed as another approach to finely tune the emission wavelength.42 Both push–pull molecules 54 and 55 showed single-wave emission bands at 466 and 479 nm, respectively, whatever the excitation wavelength was. The red shift of the emission of 55 compared to that of 54 can be easily ascribed to an elongation of the conjugated spacer and lowering of the HOMO–LUMO gap. The wavelengths and intensities of the emission bands were also determined as being temperature-dependent. Notably, the PL intensity of 54 and 55 at 77 K was about 2.5-fold magnitudes higher than at 150 K. Varying the substitution at the aniline moieties did not alter the trends of temperature dependence.
 Fig. 8  Ambipolar molecules 51–55. 
3. Metal complexes
Emissions of the different luminescent molecules that have been discussed till now are dominated by fluorescence, and their phosphorescent emissions are usually very weak. One effective way to promote a phosphorescent emission from organic molecules is to introduce these organic molecules into the coordination sphere of d-block metal cations and to generate a metal complex. Indeed, metal centers can play a key role in promoting singlet–triplet state mixing and hence, phosphorescent emission.43 As a drawback, the emission band of the complex is often considerably shifted compared to that of the free ligand, except for metal complexes involving ligand-centered π → π* transitions for which the emission band of the complex usually resembles that of the free ligand.44 Concerning wide band gap metal complexes, the main issue surrounding their long-term stability remains, and stable blue phosphorescent complexes are still scarce. One easy way to achieve blue phosphorescent complexes is to find ligands that display a blue emission, which can be later enhanced by metal centers. The first complexation of a TPA–OXD ligand was reported in 2001 with the formation of Re(I) and Mn(I) polypyridine complexes C1 and C2 (Fig. 9) containing pendant OXD–TPA assemblies.45 Elucidation of the nature of the emitting state was the main focus of this initial study. The emission of the Re(I) complex C1 was determined as originating from the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state, while transient DC photoconductivity clearly evidenced the emission of the Mn(I) complex as arising from an intraligand charge-transfer. Complexation of a ligand that emits a strong blue fluorescence to form a blue emitter for OLEDs was achieved a few years later.46 As anticipated, complexation of the ligand with Zn2+ provided complex C3 with an emission involving a ligand-centered π → π* transition. When tested in a single layer device, the emissive layer of C3 was deposited by spin-coating and not by sublimation due to its low decomposition temperature. To form a homogeneous film, the emissive layer was obtained by mixing an equimolar amount of PMMA and C3. Only moderate performances were obtained as a result of the presence of the insulating PMMA. A turn-on voltage of 15 V and the maximum brightness of 271 cd m−2 at 27 V were obtained with this complex (see Table 1). A more irregular behavior was obtained with two novel bipolar-transporting dinuclear europium(III) complexes C4 and C5 that only differ by a tiny structural variation.47 It has to be noticed that dinuclear complexes have only been scarcely investigated as emitters for OLEDs, whatever the metal.48 As a first point, the structural variation does not impact the PL of the two complexes, which displayed the same emission maxima (λem = 613 nm). Influence of the structure was noticeable in the single-layered devices as A-doped devices were two-times brighter than B-doped devices.
 Fig. 9  Ambipolar molecules complexed to metals. 
The substantial difference in brightness is related to the different inter and intramolecular energy transfers existing between the two complexes. In particular, dinuclear complex C4 is characterized by the conjugation existing between the TPA and OXD moieties. This conjugation does not exist in complex C5 since it possesses a flexible linkage between OXD and TPA. However, in the two cases, only a moderate brightness was obtained and the best C4-doped devices exhibited a maximum brightness of 296.3 cd m−2 at 69.1 mA cm−2 with a turn-on voltage of 8.5 V (see Table 1).
4. Bipolar polymers
4.1. Bipolar polymers in OLEDs devices
Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) have been extensively studied due to their potential applications in large-area and flexible displays.49 Although a great deal of progress has been made in solution processed PLEDs, the reliability of PLED devices is still much behind that of vacuum deposited small-molecule-based organic light-emitting diodes and still does not meet the requirements for commercialization. However, contrarily to small molecule-based devices that require an expensive and time-consuming deposition process to deposit the different organic layers, polymers can be deposited by a solution process thanks to their high film-forming abilities. In order to cut costs and to simplify the device structure, also including the top and bottom contacts, the different layers can be deposited from solution, which is compatible with cheap production methods such as roll-to-roll process. Among PLEDs, polyfluorenes (PF) and poly(1,4-phenylenevinylene)s (PPV) and their corresponding derivatives are mainly at the center of a significant research effort50 due to their high photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies, high thermal stability and easy color-tuning through the introduction of low-band gap co-monomers. However, these conjugated polymers tend to form aggregates during device fabrication and/or excimers upon operation, leading to both red-shifted emissions and lower efficiencies. Besides the long-wavelength emission, another drawback of PF-based PLED devices is their lower EL efficiencies compared to that of PPV-based devices caused by the low yield of exciton formation within the emissive layer. To address this issue, it is necessary to improve both the injection and transport of electrons and holes to produce more excitons within the active layer. As triphenylamines exhibit a good hole-transport property and a high solubility,51 several research groups combined 1,3,4-oxadiazole (an electron deficient molecule) with triphenylamine units into polymer backbones or as side groups to achieve the best balance in terms of charge injection and transport properties in PLEDs.52 Formation of bipolar-transporting luminescent polymers not only solves the common problem of phase segregation typically observed at the interface between materials of different natures and which often occurs in molecularly doped and blended polymer-based devices, but also eliminates in this case the interface existing between the electron- and hole-transport layer by combining the two properties within a single material. It thus solves the problem of a segregation phase for devices fabricated by spin coating.
In the first approaches to combining TPA and OXD, electron- and/or hole-transporting segments were directly incorporated into the polymer backbone in the main chain and not as pendant groups. Such an incorporation of donor–acceptor segments along the conjugated copolymer backbone was expected to directly influence both the delocalization of electrons and holes, and thus deeply impact the charge transport and the charge recombination in PLEDs. The first combinations of triphenylamine and 1,3,4-oxadiazole moieties as ambipolar carrier-transporters in PLEDs were reported in 2003 by Shirota et al.52c In this work, a specific design was used as both TPA and OXD were fused, sharing one aromatic ring in common. The fused species was introduced as a pendant group of a poly(methylmethacrylate) PMMA polymer. The idea of Shirota's team was to synthesize a novel class of polymeric materials which show liquid crystalline (LC) phases while comprising multifunctional mesogens with photo- and electroactive properties. Different kinds of polymers containing an oxadiazole and various arylamine moieties were prepared and notably poly[2-{4′-(m-methacryloyloxy-1-alkyloxy)biphenyl-4-yl}-5-(4-N,N-diphenyl-aminophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole] as PMm-OXD-PA P1–P2 (with m = 6 or 11, which corresponds to the alkyl spacer length) (Fig. 10). However, these latter polymers did not exhibit any LC phase regardless of the value of m. PM6-OXD-PA and PM11-OXD-PA showed only Tg at 124 and 95 °C, respectively. It seems that the steric hindrance existing between the two benzene rings introduced as the end-group of PMm′-OXD-PA may prevent the formation of LC phases. Single layered EL devices consisting of PM6-OXD-PA P1 were elaborated and exhibited a low turn-on voltage at 10 V. With a high quantum yield of fluorescence (0.82) and an EL emission in the blue region (λem = 453 nm), only a weak emission was obtained as only a maximum brightness of 30 cd m−2 was achieved at 27 V (see Table 1). The high similarities of the EL and the PL spectra clearly evidenced that the charge recombination occurs on the chromophore and the emission originates exclusively from PM6-OXD-PA P1. Parallel to this study, two other series of soluble electroluminescent polymers containing hole-deficient triphenyl-amine and electron-deficient oxadiazole units in the main chain were investigated. Both of them were designed with TPA and OXD units being separated by vinyl (P3)52a or azomethine groups (P4),52e respectively. In these two articles, TPAs and OXDs are directly connected one to each other and form the main chain. As a result of the good bipolar transporting performances, the brightness and electroluminescent efficiency of P3 were significantly improved and the turn-on voltage was reduced compared to that of similar polymers that do not comprise the electron-deficient oxadiazole units in the main chains (see P5). Notably, for devices built up with the following configuration (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3/CsF/Al), a maximum brightness of 3600 cd m−2 and a maximum current efficiency of 0.65 cd A−1 (quantum efficiency of 0.3%) were obtained for P3, which is about 15 times brighter and 15 times more efficient than the corresponding P5. These results indicate that the introduction of the oxadiazole units both increases the conjugated length of the polymer, leading to the red-shifted emission spectrum but also to an enhancement of the electron-transport ability, thus improving the charge-transport balance between electrons and holes. The importance of a balanced charge-transport within the emissive layer is evidenced with the turn-on voltage of P3 (4 V), which is significantly reduced by the introduction of the oxadiazole group compared to that of P5. More recently, Sek et al.52e synthesized bifunctional oligoazomethines with triphenylamine moieties exhibiting blue, blue-green and green light depending of the electron-acceptor (4,4′-diaminooctafluorobiphenyl (P6), 4,4′-(hexafluoro-isopropylidene)dianiline (P7), and 4-amino-phenylsulfone (P8) respectively) or the electron-donating group (4,4′-(4,4′-isopropylidenediphenyl-1,1′-diyldioxy)dianiline (P9) and 2,5-bis(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-oxadiazole (P4)). The choice of these molecules was motivated by the desire to determine the influence of the solvent polarity and a wide range of protonating agents on the absorption and emission wavelength of these five bifunctional oligomers. Fine tuning of the optical properties by varying both the electron acceptor and donor was assigned to a modification of the planarity of the main chain, modifying thus the conjugation. In the solid state, the energy gap (Eg) of the oligomer films prepared with P6, P7 and P4 were determined as being the same (2.46 eV).
 Fig. 10  Structures of polymers P1–P9. 
In this work, bifunctional oligomers possessing both hole- and electron-transporting units in the main chains were investigated in thin films after iodine doping. It is well known that iodine doping increases dramatically the magnitude of charge-transfer from the donor to the acceptor in bulk reactions and thus shifts their absorption and emission. The highest blue-shift was observed for P4 with a blue-shift of 43 nm after doping with iodine (43 nm). Electron-donating groups in P4 and P9 shifted the second band to longer wavelengths in comparison to the other oligomers. When investigated in solution, in the most polar solvent (i.e., DMA), the emission of all the oligomers was bathochromically shifted in comparison to that observed in chloroform and detected in the range of 469–552 nm (2.64–2.25 eV). The strongest influence of the polarity of the solvent on the emission band was observed for P6 and was as high as 52 nm. Strong solvatochromism with the solvent polarity is indicative of significant charge redistribution upon photoexcitation.30,53 For all the other oligomers, the shift was lower and ranged from 22 to 27 nm. While varying the possible combination of OXD and TPA, Mikroyannidis et al.52b reported different polyfluorenevinylene copolymers PFV-OXD P10, PFV-TPA P11, and PFVCOP P12 (Fig. 11) containing only OXD and dihexylfluorene in the main chain, TPA and dihexylfluorene in the main chain, and a copolymerization of OXD, TPA and dihexylfluorene in the main chain, respectively. Interestingly, all copolymers emitted blue-green colors in dilute solution with high PL quantum yields of 0.76–0.87. The presence of donor–acceptor moieties in the copolymers led to intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) excited states. By incorporating electron-rich tertiary aromatic amines in the polyfluorene backbone, copolymers exhibited much lower ionization potentials (IP) (5.0–5.3 eV)50a that better matched with the work function of the ITO/PEDOT layer (5.2 eV). Consequently, devices based on these copolymers P10–P12 exhibited lower operating voltages compared to that of devices based on the corresponding dihexylfluorene-based homo-polymer.54 When tested as emitters in single-layer light-emitting diodes, PFV-TPA P11 gave the best device performance out of the three copolymers, even if these values remained poor. Indeed, a current efficiency of 0.33 cd A−1 and a brightness of 360 cd m−2 at the driving voltage of 10.5 V were only obtained (see Table 1). Importantly, the EL spectra obtained from all three copolymers were found to be highly voltage-dependent and a significant red-shift of their EL spectra compared to that of their PL spectra was observed. The red-shift of their emission was assigned to a partial doping of the copolymers at the PEDOT/polymer interface, shifting their emission and decreasing the brightness. However, these results clearly demonstrated the interest of correctly selecting both the donor and acceptor moieties to attain the optimum balance between hole- and electron-injection/transport. To avoid this problem of interface doping and in an effort to enhance device performances, an intermediate layer of PVK between PEDOT:PSS and the copolymer was introduced, enabling to solve the EL red-shift, while keeping the device performances in the same order of magnitude. Finally, improvements were aroused by carefully balancing the charge-carriers' transport. With this aim, the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the different copolymers could be finely tuned by addition of OXD and TPA segments into the polyfluorene-vinylene backbone. A stable blue EL with CIE coordinates (0.17, 0.16) was obtained in the diodes elaborated with the typical devices architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS (65 nm)/(PVK/copolymer) (40 nm)/TPBI (20 nm)/LiF (2 nm)/Al (120 nm) where the emissive layer was composed of a PVK/P12 blend at ratios of 95:5 w/w. A blue shifted EL emission of the blend was evidenced compared to the emission of P12 as a result of the high amount of PVK in the blend. However, an efficient energy transfer of the host PVK to the copolymers was observed and the peak at 420 nm of the PVK was almost undetected in the EL spectra. When optimized, luminances of the blend LEDs varied from 1530–3400 cd m−2, enhancing the device performances by a factor 3–11 compared to devices comprising neat copolymer thin films.

In the same spirit, Lin et al.52d synthesized and studied two blue light-emitting copolymers comprising OXD, TPA and dihexylfluorene moieties in the main chain while carbazole-TPA or tricarbazole-TPA were respectively introduced as pendant groups of POFPA P13 and POFCPA P14, respectively. Turn-on voltages of the two devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/polymer (40 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), were the same (4.5 V) but it could also be found that the POFCPA P14 device had a higher maximum brightness (4701 cd m−2), current efficiency (1.79 cd A−1), and power efficiency (0.87 lm W−1) than those obtained for POFPA-based devices (4211 cd m−2, 1.60 cd A−1, 0.83 lm W−1). POFCPA devices showed a voltage-independent EL peak centered at 472 nm with the CIE coordinates (0.15, 0.20), while the EL emission maximum of the POFPA devices was observed at 480 nm with CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.24) (see Table 1). These results suggested that the extra carbazole units introduced as side chains of the copolymers could improve the color purity by blue-shifting the emission. Different variations of the positions of OXD and TPA were further investigated under the form of copolymers P15–P17.
Notably, when OXD was attached to the phenyl ring of TPA (P15),52g the electron affinity of the polymer increased, consequently helping the charge recombination to occur within the emissive layer. Compared to P16, that does not comprise any OXD units, the presence of the pendant OXD does not significantly affect the HOMO level of P15. Indeed, the LUMO energy levels of P15 and P16 were also the same, i.e., −2.38 and −2.26 eV, respectively (see Table 2). However, if the energy levels were not modified by the presence or absence of OXD moieties, the EL properties of P15 showed by far the best results of the two polymers, with a maximum brightness and current efficiency of 167 cd m−2 and 0.018 cd A−1, respectively, indicating that the presence of the very strong electronegative OXD group in the side chain could be of great help for electron transport. The performances of these two polymers P15–P16 remained extremely low. However, enhancement of the device performance resulted from the more balanced charge injection due to the simultaneous introduction of TPAs and OXDs in the polymer. The opposite effect was observed for TPA and OXD-substituted poly(1,4-phenylenevinylene) (PPVs). Notably, TPA- and OXD-substituted poly(1,4-phenylenevinylene)s P18, where TPAs and OXDs are introduced as pendant groups of a PPV main chain, exhibited a poorer luminance and current density compared to that of P19–P21 in the same device configuration.52j The lower PL quantum yield of P18 compared to that of P19–P21 was notably assigned to exciton trapping during the charge separation in the excited state.
While extending this concept to more complex structures, Wu et al. synthesized P17.52f This opposite strategy, consisting of the synthesis of a fluorene-based copolymer with bipolar charge transporting functionalities, P17, with TPAs in the main chain and OXDs as pendant groups attached at the C9 position of each fluorene repeating units, was more fruitful for the design of highly emissive OLEDs.52f The presence of the propeller-like triphenylamine units in P17 efficiently hindered the close-packing of the polymer chains and thus suppressed its crystallizability.55 Additionally, introduction of the two rigid OXD groups provided a three-dimensional structure to the polymer that enhanced the chain rigidity and restricted its segmental mobility, which leads in turn to the high Tg value of 306 °C.52i,56 Under the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/P17 (50–70 nm)/TPBI (30 nm)/Mg:Al (100 nm)/Au (100 nm), a maximum brightness of 7128 cd m−2 was reached at the current density of 563 mA cm−2 and a driving voltage of 12 V (see Table 1). Devices also exhibited the low turn-on voltage of 3.7 V. Good performances of P17 were notably assigned to the low ionization potential of this polymer, which matches well with the work function of the ITO/PEDOT electrode and thus facilitates hole injection. In the same study, Wu et al. compared the performance of P17 with a fluorene-based copolymer P22 (Fig. 12) possessing this time both TPA and OXD as the side chains of a polyfluorene copolymer.52f This latter copolymer possesses a lower Tg (166 °C) compared to P17 as a result of the presence of additional 9,9-dioctylfluorene units in its main chain and flexible n-butyl chains on TPA. Devices prepared with P22 exhibited much lower performances than the corresponding P17-based devices while using the same stacking. A higher turn-on voltage (4.7 V), a lower quantum efficiency (1.07%), and a lower luminance (3769 cd m−2) were also obtained. However, P22 which is a blue emitter is also a wide-band gap material that was also investigated as a potential host for phosphorescent red dopants.52h When used as a host for the red dopant Os(fppz) complex at the doping concentration of 2.6 wt% and blended with P23, white OLEDs (WOLEDs) with CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.32) were obtained. Through chemical engineering and the incorporation of the low-band gap 2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole (BT) moieties52h into the backbone of the polyfluorene blue-emitting copolymer P22, P23 was obtained as a new polymer with a shifted emission compared to the parent P22. Devices based on this BT-containing copolymer exhibited a bright green light with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.61), a maximum brightness of 10232 cd m−2 and a maximum luminous efficiency of 8.9 cd A−1 (see Table 1). Incorporation of 5 mol% of BT units in this polymer led to a weak absorption at ca. 445 nm, and a longer-wavelength emission at 540 nm, overlapping well with the blue emission from the polyfluorene segments. While examining the EL performances of this polymer enriched with BT units (P23) relative to the former devices (P22), the authors noticed these green-emitting devices possessed significantly improved performances compared to that of the P22-based devices or a copolymer only comprising fluorene and BT units P24.57 The more facile charge injection and the more-efficient charge recombination within P23 due to the presence of the TPA and OXD pendant groups could explain this device improvement.

4.2. In PV devices
To the best of our knowledge and prior to this study, no reports of polymers containing both OXDs as the electron-acceptor units and TPA moieties as the hole-transporter units for OPV applications have been reported.58 During the last decade and to improve OPV performances, low band-gap conjugated materials with appropriate energy levels are required for efficient charge transfer in OPVs: poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT) are the two well-known conjugated polymers used as donor materials in OPV applications. One of the successful approaches that has been developed to reduce the band gap is to arrange the electron-donor and electron-acceptor repeating units alternately along the conjugated backbone. Lim et al.58 proposed a series of fluorene–thienothiophene-based copolymers P25–P27 (Fig. 13) with TPA units and containing triazole (P25), oxadiazole (P26) or benzo[2,3,5]-thiadiazole moieties (P27) as electron-acceptor units, with OPV device structures like ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/copolymer:PCBM (60–70 nm) (1:3 wt%)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) Interestingly, the introduction of triazole groups in the copolymer was more effective than that of benzothiadiazole or oxadiazole.
 Fig. 13  Structures of copolymers P25–P27. 
The substitution of the triazole unit for benzothiadiazole increased the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 0.23% to 0.33% (∼43% of improvement). The highest PCE of 0.30%, with oxadiazole in the main chain, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.79 V and a short circuit current (Jsc) of 1.21 mA cm−2 was achieved by device annealing at 80 °C. In fact, although benzothiadiazoles are known to be the best electron-deficient unit and used in PCDTBT, oxadiazole and triazole units could be good candidates for electron-deficient moieties in organic photovoltaic materials if the donor material has higher optical properties and higher hole mobility.
4.3. Bipolar polymers in memory devices
With regards to the growing demand for memory devices characterized by high data storage density, fast write/read speed and high capacity, polymers have also been identified as potential candidates for memory elaboration as a result of their mechanical properties, 3D-stacking capability, easy processability and their low-cost. For memory applications, polymeric materials must be characterized by an electrical bistability, exploited during the writing process of the memory device. Upon application of a sufficient voltage, the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor via (or not) a mediator group gives rise to an abrupt increase of the current density indicative of the device transition from its initial “off” state to the “on” state. This electrical transition from the “off” state to the “on” state corresponds to the “writing” process and the encoding of a bit of information. Two studies clearly evidenced the potential and usability of TPA and OXA-based materials for this application. In the two studies, TPA was considered each time as the donating group of the polymeric materials.59 In the first polymer (P28),59a OXD was used as the conjugated spacer group between TPA, the phthalimide group used in this last case as the strong electron acceptor. To investigate this polymer in memory applications, a single sandwiched device was investigated. Interestingly, the threshold voltage to switch the device from its initial low-conductivity (off) state to its high-conductivity (on) state was determined to be only of 1.8 V. After undergoing the off-to-on transition, the on state was determined to withstand for 6 h upon application of a constant voltage stress of 1 V. A shorter retention time of both the on and off states could be evidenced for the copolymers used in the second study. Chen et al. proposed random copolymers P29 containing different donor/acceptor ratios of pendent TPAs and phenyl-OXDs (see Fig. 14).59b The ITO/homopolymer poly(TPA) or copolymers with a high proportion of TPA/Al devices exhibited dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static random access memory (SRAM) behaviors with an on/off current ratio of 107–108. However, no switching phenomena were observed for a higher OXD ratio. Moreover, the devices could endure 108 cycles under a voltage pulse and show a long retention time of at least 104 s under constant voltage stress. The interesting aspect of this study surrounds the fact that these experimental results suggested that the observed switching behavior could be determined by donor/acceptor ratio through notably, the ability of charge trapping/back-transferring of trapped charges. Moreover, in both cases the glass transition temperatures are high enough (220–210 °C for P29 and 317 °C for P28) to suggest their applications for the long term stability of device operation.

4.4. Bipolar polymers in electrochromic applications
To the best of our knowledge, only one study revealed a TPA and OXD-based polymer that exhibited electrochromic properties.60 The structure of P30 (Fig. 15) is based on a novel 9,9′-spirobifluorene-cored donor–acceptor bichromophore system in which the electron-donating moieties are triphenylamine and carbazole groups, and the oxadiazole groups are the electron-withdrawing moieties. The electrogenerated film is a novel material that contains excellent charge-transport groups of tetraphenylbenzidine and dicarbazoyl units that have great potential for applications as hole-transporters.
 Fig. 15  Structures of copolymers P30. 
The OXD moieties not only play an important role in blocking electronic delocalization between the two terminal TPA groups but also possess the ability to transport electrons efficiently.
These polymer films exhibit reversible electrochemical oxidations accompanied by strong color changes (493 nm (0.0 V); 749 nm (1.0 V)) having a high coloration efficiency. The transmittances of 79.2 and 7.3% in the neutral and fully oxidized states, respectively, provide a difference between those states of 71.9%. Together, these characteristics suggest that this new type of polymer has a great potential for use in optoelectronic applications.
5. Perspectives
To conclude, TPA and OXD proved to be excellent candidates for the design of various polymers and organic molecules with well-defined properties. Concerning the small molecules, the best results in the devices were undoubtedly obtained while combining one OXD moiety with two TPA units and breaking the conjugation between OXD and TPA. The best combination was achieved with molecule 26, which exhibited the more balanced hole- and electron-transport ability. In this last case, highly emissive OLEDs were obtained while using 26 as a bipolar host for phosphorescent dopants. Small molecules were also used as promising emitters for OLEDs. On the contrary, copolymers were only used as emitters for OLEDs and all copolymers proved to exhibit only weak emissive properties. A degree of magnitude was definitely lost compared to what can be obtained for small molecules when tested as emitters for OLEDs. Apart from OLEDs applications, a combination of OXD and TPA were only scarcely investigated for light harvesting, memory devices or for electrochromic applications and these different topics deserve to be further investigated. As clearly evidenced, OXD–TPA combinations were clearly synthesized for OLED applications. In OLEDs, the future challenge definitely consists of addressing the efficiency roll-off issue, i.e., the reduction of the quantum efficiency with increasing current density, which is almost general and constitutes the most significant problem facing organic light-emitting devices. With the aim of developing solid-state light sources for next generation energy-saving lighting, the efficiency roll-off must be as low as possible in the region of interest of manufacturers, namely from 100 to 10000 cd m−2. Several factors have been identified to explain the decrease of the device efficiency with the current density: triplet–triplet annihilation caused by the long lifetime of the triplet excitons but also by the space charge accumulation caused by the narrow exciton recombination region,61 dissociation of excitons induced by the electric field,62 exciton formation in the hole transporting layer,63 triplet-polaron annihilation,64 or loss of charge balance with increasing current density.65 This last point could be clearly addressed by developing new OXD–TPA combinations, with OXD clearly possessing a good electron transport ability and TPA a good hole-transport ability. By favoring a more balanced charge transport and injection in the emissive layer, roll-off could be significantly reduced and the recombination zone being expanded to the whole EML, thus reducing charge accumulation and the probability of triplet–triplet exciton quenching. Although only a few examples of these appealing molecules are reported to date,66 none of them have been designed with OXD, TPA or OXD–TPA combinations as of yet. Hence, the challenge is set.
