    , Accepted 1st August 2017First published on 2nd August 2017AbstractAn antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) semiconductor is appealing as a promising light absorber due to its suitable bandgap (1.5–1.7 eV), ‘one dimensional’ crystal structure and non-toxic constituents. In this work, the orientation preferences of the Sb2S3 thin films grown on the CdS layer and bare glass substrates were compared by SEM and XRD measurements. The growth direction of (Sb4S6)n ribbons was found to be substrate-dependent, and the growth mechanism was discussed. Thin film solar cells in the configuration of glass/(SnO2:F) FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/Au were fabricated and the highest conversion efficiency reached 3.01%. The defects and recombination losses in the thin film solar cells were investigated by voltage-dependent quantum efficiency and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. The CdS/Sb2S3 (n–p) heterojunction solar cells showed a little decrease by about 0.2% in conversion efficiency to 2.84% after three month storage in ambient air without encapsulation.
1. Introduction
V–VI group compounds have received great attention recently because of their potential applications in the fields of thermoelectric devices,1 optical storage,2 photonic crystals3 and photovoltaic devices.4,5 Furthermore, some compounds of this family like Sb2S3, Bi2S3 and Sb2Se3 exhibit appropriate optical band gaps for photovoltaic devices. Since pioneering research work from Hodes's group employed Sb2S3 as an absorber material in solar cells, the Sb2S3 semiconductor has received more and more attention in photovoltaic applications.6 In 2014, Seok's group reported a 7.5% conversion efficiency Sb2S3 solar cell with a glass/TCO/TiO2/Sb2S3/polymer structure.7
Most commonly, high efficiency Sb2S3 solar cells utilized a mesoscopic device structure, which usually employed a mesoporous layer of TiO2 of a few microns thick or just a flat dense layer of TiO2 with a thickness of tens of nanometers. These devices needed the assistance of an inorganic electron transport layer (ETL) and organic hole transport layer (HTL) for extracting the carriers.8,9 However, the mesoscopic devices with an organic HTL usually have device instability issues due to the inter-diffusion.10,11 Deng et al. reported that the efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells with a P3HT HTL decreased from 2.9% to 1.52% after 100 hour illumination.12 In contrast, the Sb2S3 solar cells with a planar heterojunction structure without organic hole conducting materials exhibited long-term stability and even can be stored in ambient air without encapsulation.13
In 2009, Nair's group developed planar heterojunction Sb2S3 thin film solar cells with a glass/SnO2:F(FTO)/CdS/Sb2S3/PbS/C–Ag structure, where the Sb2S3 absorber layer was prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD). Though the open circuit voltage (VOC) was higher than 600 mV, the efficiency was only 0.7%.14 A Sb2S3 thin film solar cell with an efficiency of 1.27% was obtained later, where the device structure was FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/C–Ag and Sb2S3 was deposited by thermal evaporation from the Sb2S3 powder at room temperature followed by an annealing process in N2.15 In 2016, Yuan et al. reported rapid thermal evaporation (RTE) processed Sb2S3 thin film solar cells with an efficiency of 3.5%.13 However, RTE is not a common technology in large area thin film deposition. Traditional thermal evaporation is a general thin film deposition technology, which has wide applications in laboratory and industrial production.
Moreover, orthorhombic phase Sb2S3 has a special ‘one dimensional’ structure and it comprises (Sb4S6)n ribbons held together through van der Waals force, thus the conductivities along the ribbons are much higher than those across the ribbons.16–18 If the Sb2S3 absorber grows along a suitable orientation, it will offer a competing efficiency. Though one-dimensional structural Sb2S3 materials along [001] direction, such as nanotubes, nanowires or nanobelts, were easily synthesized via chemical synthesis methods, the growth direction of (Sb4S6)n ribbons in Sb2S3 thin films was usually influenced by the deposition parameters, such as growth temperature, annealing temperature and crystal structure of substrates, etc.15,19,20
In this work, Sb2S3 thin films were deposited by thermal evaporation from the Sb2S3 powder. The influences of growth temperature on structural properties of thin films and device performance were investigated systematically. The growth directions of (Sb4S6)n ribbons on glass coated with a CdS layer and bare glass were studied. Finally, Sb2S3 thin film solar cells with a power conversion efficiency over 3% in the configuration of glass/SnO2:F(FTO)/CdS/Sb2S3/Au were fabricated and the defects in the device were analyzed.
2. Experimental
Sb2S3 thin films were deposited by thermal evaporation and the commercial Sb2S3 powders were used as the evaporation source. Two types of substrates were used for the growth of Sb2S3 thin films: (1) bare glass, (2) commercial SnO2:F(FTO) glass coated with a 100 nm thick CdS layer, where the CdS layer was deposited by CBD at 70 °C and followed by annealing at 450 °C for 10 min.5 The Sb2S3 powders were placed in a ceramic crucible twined with a tungsten wire. Commercial FTO glass coated with a CdS layer and bare glass substrates were heated up to certain temperatures (280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C) and dwelt for 15 min before the deposition of Sb2S3 thin films. The deposition rate and film thickness were monitored by quartz crystal balance. Solar cells were fabricated with an FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/Au structure. Gold contacts with 50 nm thickness were deposited by thermal evaporation.
The phase structure of Sb2S3 thin films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation. The optical properties of the films were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere. The surface morphology of Sb2S3 thin films was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI nova nano SEM450). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi XPS instruments. The current density–voltage measurements for solar cells were carried out under the illumination from an AM1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (Model No. XES-100S1, SAN-EI, Japan) under standard test conditions (25 °C, AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by an Enlitech QER3011 system equipped with a 150 W xenon light source. An external DC power supply ranging from −1 V to 0 V was applied to the devices during EQE measurements. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement was carried out using a 470 nm pulse laser (pulse FWHM = 87 ps, frequency = 20 MHz), the emission signal was first dispersed using a 50 cm Acton spectrometer, then detected using a PicoHarp 300 time correlated single photon counting system with a silicon SPAD detector. The PL spectra peaked and were measured at about 722 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Substrate-dependent growth of Sb2S3

Fig. 1a and b display the XRD patterns of the Sb2S3 films deposited on bare glass and CdS/FTO/glass substrates, respectively. For description clarity, the films directly deposited on bare glass were labeled as G-based Sb2S3 and the samples prepared on CdS/FTO/glass substrates were labeled as C-based Sb2S3. As displayed in both Fig. 1a and b, the diffraction patterns corresponding to films deposited at 280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C matched well with the orthorhombic structure of Sb2S3 (JCPDS: 06-0474), and no other diffraction peaks of an impurity phase were observed. It was important to note that the deposition rate decreased with the increasing substrate temperature and it was difficult to deposit Sb2S3 when the substrate temperature was higher than 350 °C because of the high sublimation rate from the substrates. The crystalline C-based Sb2S3 thin films displayed both (120) and (310) preferential orientations. In contrast, the G-based sample deposited at 280 °C exhibited both (211) and (221) preferential orientations. When the substrate temperature increased to 300 °C, the intensities of (211) and (221) diffraction peaks got stronger, and became stronger further when the substrate temperature reached 320 °C and 350 °C. It indicated that the Sb2S3 thin films got more crystallized at higher temperature in the investigated range.

To investigate the differences of polycrystalline structures between G-based and C-based Sb2S3 samples in more detail, the texture coefficients (TCs) were calculated and are displayed in Fig. 2.21 As shown in Fig. 2a, the TC values of G-based Sb2S3, grown at 280 °C, for the (020), (120), (220), (130), (310), (320), (240) and (250) orientation peaks, were 1.96, 1.52, 1.09, 1.75, 1.61, 1.12, 0.96 and 1.39, respectively. In contrast, the TC values of C-based Sb2S3 for the (020), (120), (220), (130), (310), (320), (240), and (250) orientation peaks were 0.55, 0.60, 0.94, 1.05, 0.98, 1.11, 0.76 and 1.37, respectively. The TC(hk0) values of G-based Sb2S3 thin films were larger than those of C-based samples, whereas most of the TC(hk1) values of G-based Sb2S3 thin films were smaller than C-based samples. Moreover, the TC values of Sb2S3 thin films deposited at 300 °C (Fig. 2b), 320 °C (Fig. 2c) and 350 °C (Fig. 2d) exhibited similar behaviors to the samples deposited at 280 °C. This indicated that [hk0] orientated grains were strengthened in G-based Sb2S3 films while the [hk0] orientated grains were suppressed in C-based samples. As the polycrystalline Sb2S3 thin films grown on both CdS/FTO and glass substrates employed the same evaporation process, there was a high correlation between the growth orientation of films and the substrate.

Furthermore, Fig. 3 displays the surface morphologies of G-based and C-based Sb2S3 films prepared at 280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C, respectively. For G-based Sb2S3 films, bundles of flat strips of Sb2S3 grains were observed, suggesting that the (Sb4S6)n ribbons were tiled on the glass substrate, which resulted in [hk0]-preferred orientation grains. In contrast, the C-based Sb2S3 films displayed a compact and smooth morphology, composed of polyhedron and compact grains, indicating that the (Sb4S6)n ribbons were stacked vertically on the CdS/FTO substrate, and it led to [hk1]-preferred orientation grains. The one-dimensional (Sb4S6)n ribbons were held together through van der Waals forces, and the Sb and S atoms were bonded by strong covalent Sb–S bonds in the (Sb4S6)n ribbons. As a result, the cleavage planes of crystalline Sb2S3 lie between the ribbons.16 The (Sb4S6)n ribbons were easier to grow parallel to the glass substrate because this growth process did not require the breaking of any Sb–S bonds. In contrast, the surface of crystalline CdS could supply dangling bonds of Cd2+ and S2−, which would tend to form dative bonds with S2− and Sb3+ atoms at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface. It is suggested to be favorable for the (Sb4S6)n ribbons grown perpendicular to the substrate. In addition, comparison of the morphology of G-based and C-based Sb2S3 thin films deposited at different substrate temperatures suggested that higher temperature led to bigger grains. As shown in Fig. 4, the thickness of Sb2S3 films deposited at 280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C was controlled at approximately 600 nm by adjusting the deposition time.

3.2 FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/Au thin film solar cells
In order to examine the quality of polycrystalline C-based Sb2S3 thin films, CdS/Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells were fabricated in the configuration of glass/FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/Au. The influences of substrate temperature on the device performance parameters are shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, as the substrate temperature increased from 280 °C to 320 °C, all the VOC, short current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) got improved, resulting in an increase from 1.20% to 2.89% in the median value of efficiency, while the value decreased to 1.22% for the samples deposited at 350 °C. The J–V curves and corresponding device performance parameters of the champion solar cells with a Sb2S3 absorber deposited at 280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C are displayed in Fig. 6. The solar cells based on Sb2S3 thin films grown at 280 °C exhibited a VOC of 454 mV, a JSC of 8.03 mA cm−2, a FF of 41.89% and an efficiency of 1.53%. As the growth temperature increased to 300 °C and 320 °C, the VOC and JSC of the solar cells were improved gradually. The solar cells based on Sb2S3 films grown at 320 °C exhibited a maximum efficiency of 3.01% (VOC of 588 mV, JSC of 10.92 mA cm−2, and FF of 46.77%), which is 1.97 times higher than that of the samples prepared at 280 °C.

To explore the recombination losses in the Sb2S3 thin film solar cells, EQE measurements at zero and −1 V voltage biases were performed. As shown in Fig. 7a, the EQE spectra at zero voltage bias (solid line) of all of the devices peaked at 520–650 nm and declined at shorter and longer wavelength ranges. The decrease at short wavelength (<520 nm) could be attributed to the strong absorption of the CdS buffer layer, in which the photogenerated electron–hole pairs could not be collected because of its high doping density.22–24 The decrease at long wavelength (>650 nm) displayed an incomplete collection, which might be associated with the reduction of the bulk defects (VS, etc.) and the back surface recombination losses.25 Compared with the EQE spectra at zero bias, the EQE curves at −1 V (dashed line) were higher in the whole measured wavelength range. As shown in Fig. 7b, for each of the devices, the enhancement ratio retained nearly the same value at shorter wavelengths, and it increased sharply at longer wavelengths and reached the highest values at the wavelength near the position of the long-wavelength EQE edge. The increased voltage dependence at longer wavelengths indicated poor carrier collection from the bulk film of the absorber. This voltage dependence increase can be attributed to the enhanced electrical field of the junction and larger space charge width under reverse bias. The electric field of the junction was enhanced when a reverse bias was applied on solar cells, and it drove more minority carriers across the junction, which were collected by the electrode, which led to higher spectral response values. On the other hand, the effective collection length of solar cells was determined by the total length of carrier diffusion and the space-charge width. The space-charge width got widened when a reverse bias was applied, which increased the collection length and allowed diffusion of more carriers into the collection region, resulting in enhanced current collection at longer wavelengths. In addition, the solar cell with an Sb2S3 absorber deposited at 320 °C displayed a less bias-dependent EQE spectrum in the longer wavelengths, indicating less recombination centers in the Sb2S3 film grown at 320 °C.

The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technique was employed to investigate the defects in these devices. Fig. 8 shows the TRPL decay curves of the Sb2S3 solar cells with an absorber grown at 280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C, respectively. The decay curves were measured at 77 K. The TRPL lifetime was calculated from the fitting of the decay curves by using the following equation:y = A1exp(−x/τ1) + A2exp(−x/τ2)where A1 and A2 are coefficients and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow components of the TRPL lifetimes, respectively. The fast component τ1 and slow component τ2 were suggested to be ascribed to the recombination at the interface and in the bulk, respectively.26 The TRPL lifetime τ1 for the devices with Sb2S3 thin films grown at four substrate temperatures (280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 350 °C) was calculated to be 1.3 ns, 1.5 ns, 1.9 ns and 1.12 ns, respectively. And lifetime τ2 for these samples was calculated to be 13.2 ns, 51.4 ns, 55.0 ns and 7.96 ns, respectively. Both the TRPL lifetimes τ1 and τ2 were observed to increase with the increasing substrate temperature from 280 °C to 320 °C, indicating that both recombination rates at the interface and in the Sb2S3 thin films decreased with increasing substrate temperature from 280 °C to 320 °C and the Sb2S3 absorber layer deposited at 320 °C had the least bulk defects compared with those deposited at 280 °C and 300 °C. However, lifetimes τ1 and τ2 decreased to 1.13 ns and 7.96 ns for the films grown at 350 °C, respectively, suggesting that the recombination centers increased both at the interface and in the Sb2S3 films. The results were consistent with the EQE analysis. The more bias-voltage EQE and decreased lifetimes for the sample grown at 350 °C may be ascribed to the more obvious sulfur deficiency behavior in the Sb2S3 films. The EDX measurement result (Fig. S7, ESI†) displayed that the thermally evaporated Sb2S3 samples were sulfur poor because of the high saturated pressure of sulfur, and the sulfur deficiency became most serious for the sample deposited at 350 °C (S/Sb ratio reached 1.1). The sulfur-poor condition in Sb2S3 absorbers usually generated sulfur S1 and S2 vacancies (V1S and V2S) and  antisites.25 These defects, as n-type donors, created deep trap levels below the conduction band that acted as recombination centers leading to lower carrier concentrations and higher activation energies.

The solar cell efficiency (Fig. 9) showed a little decrease by about 0.2% (from 3.01% to 2.84%) after three month storage in ambient air without encapsulation, which was much more stable than the device with organic HTL layers.12 In addition, the optimal thickness of the Sb2S3 absorber layer in our work was estimated to be 600–700 nm, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). This value was consistent with the previous works on n–p (Sb2S3/CdS) heterojunction structure solar cells,13,27 but it was different from the value of optimal Sb2S3 thickness in n–i–p (FTO/ETL/Sb2S3/HTL/electrode) photovoltaic devices, where the best cells usually employed about 100–200 nm thick Sb2S3 absorber layers.8,20,28 As shown in Table 1, this difference in thickness of Sb2S3 absorbers between the n–p and n–i–p heterojunction solar cells was attributed to the role of Sb2S3 absorber layers. The optimal absorber thickness for high efficiency solar cells was a definite tradeoff result between the stronger light absorption and thus higher photocurrent and the increased carrier recombination which results in lower photocurrent, photovoltage and fill factor as the film thickness increased.

On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 10c, the band alignment between the Sb2S3 absorber layer and Au back contact layer in the n–p configuration did not match so well. The Fermi level of Sb2S3 was 4.6 eV and the work function of Au was 5.1 eV, Sb2S3 surface modification or a buffer layer was desired for high efficiency Sb2S3 thin film solar cells. Moreover, several groups reported Sb2S3-based solar cells with efficiency higher than 5% (Table S1, ESI†), and the highest efficiency as high as 7.5% was achieved.9,29–33 However, most of the high efficiency device was in a mesoscopic structure. Compared with the mesoscopic structure Sb2S3-sensitized device, the conversion efficiencies of the Sb2S3 thin film solar cells, especially the device in p–n structure, were relatively low. In the mesoscopic structure, the bulk defects of nano-crystalline Sb2S3 were insignificant while the surface defects dominated. In contrast, both the defects in bulk and surface defects were important for the Sb2S3 thin film solar cells. To increase the efficiency of Sb2S3-based thin film solar cells, several approaches were desirable: doping, post-treatment, element substitution and so on. For example, replacing some of the element sulfur in Sb2S3 has been approved to be one efficient way to increase the device efficiency. Zhang et al. reported an efficiency of 5.71% with Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film absorbers.34 The Sb2S3 thin film solar cell efficiency increased from 2.47% to 3.22% by a post-selenization process, reported by Deng et al.12

4. Conclusion
In this work, the Sb2S3 thin films were deposited at different substrate temperatures. The growth of Sb2S3 on bare glass and FTO coated with CdS layer substrates was compared and analyzed. The (Sb4S6)n ribbons were found to be easier to grow parallel to the bare glass substrate while the CdS layer was found to be favorable for the (Sb4S6)n ribbons grown perpendicular to the substrate. CdS/Sb2S3 (n–p) heterojunction thin film solar cells were fabricated and a stable efficiency of 3.01% was obtained. The device exhibited stable performance after three month storage in ambient air without encapsulation. Analysis of bias-voltage dependent EQE and TRPL measurement suggested that fewer defects are present in Sb2S3 films grown at 320 °C. Further material understanding and device structure improvement are desired to improve the conversion efficiency of Sb2S3-based heterojunction thin film solar cells.
