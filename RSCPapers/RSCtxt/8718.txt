    , Accepted 3rd February 2021First published on 10th February 2021AbstractH2/CO2 fuel cells are important devices that convert CO2 into CH4 while generating electricity at mild temperatures. Anhydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2) on carbon nanotubes (CNT) as a cathode catalyst causes CO2 methanation, but the methane production rate needs to be improved. In this paper, a core–shell structure of CNT@hydrous RuO2 was fabricated by a simple sol–gel method. Unlike anhydrous RuO2, which is a single electronic conductor, CNT@hydrous RuO2 is a proton–electron mixed conductive material. Therefore, protons transfer not only in thepolybenzimidazole (PBI) film but also in the catalyst layer with the assistance of crystalline water in hydrous RuO2. CO2 methanation involving a reaction of multiple protons and electrons can be accelerated. The methane generation rate of CNT@hydrous RuO2 reached 331.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1 at 190 °C which is 3 times higher than that of anhydrous RuO2. This research result provides an effective strategy for the catalytic reaction of multiple proton–electron transfers.
1. Introduction
Since the industrial revolution, the content of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has continuously increased from 280 ppm in the early 1800s to 417 ppm in the present day (https://www.CO2.earth/), which makes global warming an urgent issue.1–4 To reduce the CO2 content in the atmosphere, the first step is the capture of CO2. The cryogenic air separation method was successfully industrialized in the 1950s.2,5,6 The remaining challenge is how to deal with the captured CO2. Traditional underground landfills and deep ocean dissolution have potential leakage risks and are not sustainable.2,7 In recent years, the conversion of carbon dioxide into high value chemicals or fuels under mild conditions has attracted researchers' attention.1,2,8 However, CO2 has high thermodynamic stability, and the dissociation energy of the CO bond is as high as 750 kJ mol−1.9,10 A large amount of energy is needed to activate the chemical bond of CO2 and convert it into products such as methanol (CH3OH),11,12 methane (CH4),13,14 carbon monoxide (CO),15–18 formate,19,20 and ethylene (C2H4).21,22
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 reduces CO2 to higher-value chemicals through the input of electrical energy. Due to its mild reaction conditions, easy operation, and high Faraday efficiency, electrocatalysis has become the most popular research direction of CO2 reduction.10,21,23,24 The large amount of electrical energy required for electrocatalysis is a problem. At present, the solution to this problem is to use green energy such as wind energy and solar energy to generate electricity.2,25 Due to the limitations of natural factors and geographical conditions, green energy power generation is discontinuous and unstable so it is difficult to connect to the grid.26,27
Is there a device that can achieve CO2 reduction without relying on an external power input? The prerequisite for the excellent catalytic effect of common cathode catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is to an input of a large amount of electrical energy to overcome a large reduction overpotential, such as some Cu overpotentials that exceed 1 V.28,29 However, the Pt electrode achieves the electrical reduction of CO2 to CO at a low overpotential (close to the standard electrode potential).30,31 Minoru Umeda et al. combined the fact that CO2 reduction has a reduction potential higher than hydrogen oxidation with the operating principles of fuel cells. They used Pt/C as the cathode and anode catalyst for H2/CO2 fuel cells to achieve simultaneous CO2 reduction and power generation for the first time.32 Pt/C is poisoned by CO2 reduction products (CO), making the reduction process discontinuous. To solve this problem, Ru, which does not strongly adsorb CO, was added. Compared with Pt/C, Pt0.8Ru0.2 as a cell cathode catalyst has a discharge power density that exceeds 1 mW cm−2 at 60 °C, which is 5 times greater than the discharge power density of Pt/C.33 These studies have proven the feasibility of H2/CO2 fuel cell power generation but neglected to explore the CO2 reduction products of the cathode. Instead, the catalyst that generates electricity is used for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Ru-Based catalysts are well-known in the field of CO2 methanation for their high conductivity, excellent catalytic activity and thermodynamic stability.34–37 The catalytic activity of Ru catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methane is second to none.35 Ru-Containing catalysts are used commonly as precious metal catalysts with relatively low overpotentials,38 so we aimed to introduce them into H2/CO2 fuel cells as cathode catalysts. In a previous work,39 we assembled a H2/CO2 fuel cell to reduce CO2 while generating electricity at mild temperatures in the range of 130–170 °C. This temperature range was maintained using industrial waste heat. It has been shown that nano-RuO2 supported on CNT as a cathode catalyst and Pt/C (40%) as an anode catalyst can stably and effectively achieve CO2 methanation. The methane generation rate of a single cell reaches 66.25 μmol gcat−1 h−1, and the electrode reaction equation40,41 is as follows:
Anode: H2–2e− → 2H+, E° = 0.000 V vs. SHE(1)
Cathode: CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O, E° = 0.169 V vs. SHE(2)

Eqn (2) shows that CO2-to-CH4 is a complex eight-proton and eight-electron transfer process. Hence, we prepared a catalyst that conducts both protons and electrons to promote the reaction. Finally, CNT@hydrous RuO2, which features a CNT core with a diameter of approximately 14 nm and a hydrous RuO2 shell with a thickness of approximately 5 nm, was synthesized by a simple sol–gel method.42 Hydrous RuO2 combines effective electron transport (along dioxo bridges in RuO2) and convenient proton transfer (through crystalline water) for CO2 reduction.43 Under the same test conditions, the methane production rate of CNT@hydrous RuO2 as the cell cathode catalyst is 331.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1, which is almost 3 times higher than that of anhydrous RuO2 on CNT.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Anhydrous RuO2 and RuCl3·3H2O were purchased from Shaanxi Kaida Chemical Engineering Co., Ltd. Pt/C (HiSpec 4000, 40% Pt) was obtained from Johnson Matthey (UK). Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were supplied by Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd (Chengdu, China). Nafion solution (Du Pont D520, 5 wt%) and carbon paper (0.21 mm in thickness) were purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. PBI membranes (60 μm in thickness) were purchased from Shanghai Shengjun Polymer Technologies Co., Ltd. Nitric acid (HNO3, 65%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) gaskets were supplied by Shenzhen Xinlongyuan Plastic Materials Co., Ltd (Shenzhen, China). N2 (99.999%), Ar (99.999%), and air (O2 ≈ 21%, N2 ≈ 79%) were supplied by Shaanxi Xinkang Medical Oxygen Co., Ltd. CO2 (99.999%) was purchased from Praxair (Shanghai) Industrial Gas Co., Ltd. H2 (99.999%) was obtained using a QPH-300II Hydrogen Generator.
2.2 Preparation of CNT@hydrous RuO2 and hydrous RuO2
CNT were treated with 2 M nitric acid reflux at 80 °C for 8 h. CNT (200 mg) were dispersed in a 20 mL 0.1 M RuCl3 solution by ultrasonication for 30 minutes. Then, 0.3 M NaHCO3 was slowly added to the solution while stirring until the pH reached 7. After stirring for 15 h, the solution was filtered and washed with deionized water (Milli-Q, 18.25 MΩ) several times, and then dried in an oven under vacuum at 50 °C for 8 h. Finally, the dried particles were ground and heat-treated at 150 °C for 8 h. The black powder was collected and shown to be CNT@hydrous RuO2. The preparation of hydrous RuO2 was the same as that of CNT@hydrous RuO2 except that CNT were not added.
2.3 Fuel cell assembly
The PBI membrane was soaked in H3PO4 at room temperature for 48 hours for subsequent use. First, the cathode and anode catalytic ink needed to be prepared. Twenty-five milligrams CNT@hydrous RuO2 was weighed for the cathode catalyst (the comparison group included 15 mg anhydrous RuO2 and 10 mg nitric acid-treated CNT), 1.5 mL alcohol and 15 μL Nafion solution were added in order, 10 mg Pt/C was weighed for the anode, and 0.3 mL deionized water, 1.5 mL alcohol and 15 μL Nafion solution were added in order, and then the electrode mixed solution was dispersed by ultrasonication for 0.5 h. Well-dispersed catalytic ink was sprayed onto hydrophobic carbon paper as a gas diffusion layer by using a gas-powered airbrush (Ruiyi HD-130). Catalyst loading was calculated by weighing the mass of carbon paper before and after spraying. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was hot-pressed by using a powder tablet press at 130 °C and 1.5 MPa force for 3 minutes. Finally, PTFE gaskets with a thickness of 0.2 mm were embedded on both sides of the MEA for heat transfer and sealing, and the fuel cell structure is shown in Fig. 1.

2.4 Fuel cell measurements
After cell assembly was completed, residual air was passed out of the cell device by introducing N2 until the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the cell system (Neware BTS-5V1A) was zero. Then, CO2 was passed into the cathode, H2 was passed into the anode, and the gas flow was controlled by a gas mass flow meter (Sevenstar D07–19B). After 10 minutes, the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) of the gas chromatograph (GC, Techcomp GC7980) was used to detect whether H2 was in the cathode gas to determine whether the MEA leaked. Under normal cell operating conditions, the cell discharge data were measured at each test temperature. When the cell was run and tested, the CO2 flow rate at the cathode was 5 sccm (mL min−1), and the H2 flow rate at the cathode was 20 sccm. After the cell's limiting current remained stable for 0.5 hours, the cathode outlet gas was detected by the thermal conductivity detector and the hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID).
2.5 Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the material was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F). The microstructure of the sample was obtained by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) on a JEM-2100 instrument (JEOL, Japan). The specific surface area was tested by using a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method for N2 adsorption–desorption (ASAP-2460, Micromeritics, USA). The thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the CNT@hydrous RuO2 sample was obtained using a Setaram Labsys Evo (France). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+ instrument (Al Kα radiation).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2a and b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) information before and after CNT were coated with hydrous RuO2. The two diffraction peaks at 25.9° and 43.1° represent the (003) and (101) planes of the CNT (PDF#26-1079), respectively; CNT@hydrous RuO2 has three broadened humps at 28.0°, 35.0°, and 54.2°, which are assigned to the (110), (101), and (211) planes of RuO2 (PDF #43-1027), respectively; since the heat treatment temperature was only 150 °C, its crystallinity is lower than that of anhydrous RuO2 (Fig. 2c). To gain a deep understanding of the catalyst composition and element valence information, XPS analysis was performed. For the XPS studies of the catalytic material, the charge shifts were corrected using the binding energy (BE) of polluted carbon, centred at 284.6 eV as a reference.44 Deconvolution analysis of the full spectrum, Ru 3d, and Ru 3p peaks for CNT@hydrous RuO2 is shown in Fig. S1.† In the full spectrum (Fig. S1a†), C 1s and Ru 3d overlap significantly at a BE of approximately 285 eV. The C 1s spectrum can be deconvolved into three peaks at 284.6 eV, 285.2 eV, and 286.8 eV corresponding to C–C, C–O, and CO in acid-treated CNT, respectively;44,45 Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 are located at 281.3 eV and 284.8 eV, and the two peaks at 283.4 eV and 287.9 eV belong to satellites (Fig. S1b†).46 Due to the overlap of the spectral peaks, to more clearly identify the valence state of Ru, Ru 3p deconvolution (Fig. S1a†) was processed.47 Similarly, Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2 are assigned at 462.9 eV and 485.1 eV, and the two peaks at 465.6 eV and 487.4 eV are satellites.46 XPS analysis once again proved that RuO2 was successfully prepared. In the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2d and e), the deconvolution of the electron binding energy of Ru–O–Ru (529.6 eV), OH–CO (532.4 eV), and H2O (free water, ca.534 eV)48 was observed for anhydrous RuO2/CNT and CNT@hydrous RuO2; the difference is that at an electron binding energy of 530.9 eV, CNT@hydrous RuO2 corresponds to Ru–O–H and satellite peaks, however, anhydrous RuO2/CNT only corresponds to satellite peaks,46 and the Ru–O–H peak represents hydrous ruthenium dioxide (RuO2·xH2O),43,49–51Fig. 2e shows that crystalline water was successfully introduced into the catalyst prepared by the sol–gel method.

The presence of crystal water was confirmed. To further quantify the components of the catalyst, thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermogravimetry (TGA/DTG) of different gas environments was executed. In flowing high-purity nitrogen, the weight loss comes from moisture. The thermogravimetric results of anhydrous RuO2/CNT show that the small amount of free water adsorbed on the surface slowly contributes to the weight loss from room temperature to 280 °C (Fig. S2†). XPS shows that the free water content of CNT@hydrous RuO2 is lower than that of anhydrous RuO2/CNT (Fig. 2d and e), so the water loss comes from crystalline water (approximately 99% or more), except for a very small amount from the loss of free water. This weight loss corresponds to the composition of RuO2·2.76H2O. RuO2 will not decompose into Ru metal when the temperature is lower than 1000 °C in an air stream,43 so 52% of the mass loss is contributed by CNT and moisture. In other words, the mass percentages of RuO2 and CNT are divided into 48% and 24.8% in CNT@hydrous RuO2, respectively.
To gain more insight, the microscopic morphology of the material was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Compared to the morphology of the acid-treated CNT, the surface of CNT@hydrous RuO2 has an obvious coating layer (Fig. S3†), which is apparent in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image shown in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 4b and c, a single carbon tube before and after being coated indicates that the thickness of the hydrous RuO2 coating layer is approximately 5 nm. In other words, CNT@hydrous RuO2 features a CNT core with a diameter of approximately 14 nm and a hydrous RuO2 shell with a thickness of approximately 5 nm. To characterize the pore size distribution of the catalyst, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was performed (Fig. S4†).52,53 CNT@hydrous RuO2 (91.2 m2 g−1) is a combination of hydrous RuO2 (12.7 m2 g−1) and CNT (160.8 m2 g−1) with a large difference in specific surface area. CNT@hydrous RuO2 disperses hydrous RuO2 and retains more than half of the mesopores in CNT. The result is consistent with the above TEM image. The specific surface area of anhydrous RuO2/CNT is larger than that of CNT@hydrous RuO2 due to its greater number of micropores, so the surface adsorption free water content is higher,54 which is consistent with the difference in the free water content from XPS analysis. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 4d shows that hydrous RuO2 (coexisting of crystalline water and weakly crystalline RuO2 in a mixed solid-state) has no graininess and low crystallinity. The interplanar spacings of 0.222 and 0.225 nm match the (200) and (111) planes of RuO2, respectively. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping of the C element in Fig. 4f corresponds to the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM situation (Fig. 4e). Fig. 4g and h shows that O and Ru are uniformly distributed around the CNTs.

The performance of CNT@hydrous RuO2 as the cathode catalyst of the cell at different temperatures in Fig. 5a shows that the discharge current decreases with increasing temperature. In contrast, when anhydrous RuO2/CNT is the cathode catalyst, no current decay occurs from 130 to 190 °C (Fig. 5b). It is further found that the open-circuit voltage (OCV) in Fig. 5a is significantly lower than the theoretical value (0.169 V) of CO2 methanation40 and the OCV decreases with increasing temperature. The higher resistance of hydrous RuO2 than anhydrous RuO2 has been confirmed by electrochemical impedance analysis.43 Therefore, the OCV of hydrated RuO2 is lower than the theoretical potential. Based on these data and the TGA/DTG curve (Fig. 3), it can be determined that there is a small loss of crystalline water from 130 to 210 °C. Mesopores formed at the site of crystalline water loss can be used as substance exchange channels.55 However, the overall continuity of the proton–electron hybrid conduction network is slightly affected, as described in detail in the discussion later. The effect is manifested as a decrease in external voltage, followed by a decrease in current. To determine the type and content of the product, the gas from the cathode outlet of the cell is passed into the gas chromatograph (GC) for testing. The test showed that the contents of the products are mainly H2 (Fig. S5†) and CH4 (Fig. 6a and b). In previous reports,39 nano-RuO2 supported on CNTs (RuO2/CNTs) was used as a CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalyst to achieve CO2 methanation, and the possible reaction paths for the formation of CH4 were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Before each cell test, the TCD test of the cathode outlet gas was performed under the open-circuit voltage conditions, as shown in Fig. S6,† and H2 was not found in the open circuit. The purpose of this test is to show that the H2 of the cathode under operating conditions comes from the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)56 rather than diffusion or leakage from the anodic side of the cell. Regardless of whether CNT@hydrous RuO2 or anhydrous RuO2/CNT is used as the cathode catalyst of the cell, the amounts of CH4 (Fig. 6a and b) and H2 (Fig. S5†) in the cell increase as the operating temperature range increase from 130 to 190 °C increases with temperature. To explain the decay of current and cathode products at higher temperatures, the cells were disassembled and compared after running at various temperatures (Fig. S7†) because the phosphoric acid-soaked PBI membrane is mechanically damaged.57,58 This is one of the limitations in the long-term research of PBI membranes as electrolyte. Therefore, before this limit is reached, it is more appropriate to operate the cell at 190 °C. Fig. 6a and b shows that the catalytic ability of CNT@hydrous RuO2 to reduce CO2 is higher than that for anhydrous RuO2/CNT, especially at 190 °C, which shows a significant abrupt increase, and the concentration of the reduction product CH4 reaches 147.8 ppm. The material conduction mechanism of the material, excluding the CNT contained in both anhydrous RuO2/CNT and CNT@hydrous RuO2, involves anhydrous rutile RuO2 acting as a single metal conductor (electron conduction along dioxo bridges),34,43 and its catalytic reaction site is found at the three-phase reaction interface contact with the PBI film. However, the crystalline water in hydrous RuO2 can transport protons from the anodic reaction,34,43,59,60 which occurs in the entire three-dimensional space of the catalytic layer of the CO2 methanation reaction. In other words, the introduction of crystalline water greatly increases the number of active sites in the catalytic reaction, and the effectiveness of the catalyst is increased accordingly. Next, calculations of the test results will be used to support this finding.

The calculated result of the CH4 generation rate based on the ESI† is shown in Fig. 6c. The trend of the CH4 generation rate is similar to that of the change in the CH4 concentration, and the maximum reduction generation rate of CNT@hydrous RuO2 reaches 331.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1 at 190 °C, which is 3 times that of anhydrous RuO2/CNT under the same conditions. Compared with the previously reported39 highest single cell CH4 yield of 66.25 μmol gcat−1 h−1, the current work successfully achieved a 5-fold increase. The transfer efficiency (TE) calculation for the CO2RR setup in detail is shown in the ESI,† and the relevant data are shown in Fig. S8.† The TE value for CNT@hydrous RuO2 as a CO2RR catalyst is 1.3% at 190 °C. The stability test was carried out at the limit discharge current of the cell at 30 mA and 190 °C. Fig. 6d shows that the cell is quite stable within 470 minutes. According to these data and the DTG curve in the N2 gas flow, only a small amount of crystalline water is lost (Fig. 2a). To sum up, the CNT@hydrous RuO2 catalytic stability was confirmed.
4. Conclusions
In summary, CNT@hydrous RuO2 as the cathode catalyst of CO2/H2 fuel cell was prepared by a simple sol–gel method, and the presence and content of crystalline water were identified by XPS and TGA/DTG, respectively. Unlike anhydrous RuO2, which relies on single electron conduction, CNT@hydrous RuO2 embedded crystalline water that maintains a continuous conductive network so that the crystalline water conducts H+ in the entire catalytic layer to increase the active sites of the catalytic reaction. At 190 °C, the methane generation rate of CNT@hydrous RuO2 reaches 331.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1, which is almost 3 times that of anhydrous RuO2/CNT under the same conditions, and the reaction can remain stable for 470 min. Although the TE of the catalytic reaction still needs to be further improved, we hope that the study of this catalyst will provide a strategy for the future design of catalysts of multi-proton–electron catalytic reaction.
