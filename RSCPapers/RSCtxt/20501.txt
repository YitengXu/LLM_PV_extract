Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin films, containing a high-density of semiconducting nanotubes, were obtained by a gel-centrifugation method. The agarose gel concentration and centrifugation force were optimized to achieve high semiconducting and metallic nanotube separation efficiency at 0.1 wt% agarose gel and 18000g. The thickness of SWCNT films can be precisely controlled from 65 to 260 nm with adjustable transparency. These SWCNT films were applied in photoelectrochemical devices. Photocurrents generated by semiconducting SWCNT enriched films are 15–35% higher than those by unsorted SWCNT films. This is because of reducing exciton recombination channels as a result of the removal of metallic nanotubes. Thinner films generate higher photocurrents because charge carriers have less chances going in metallic nanotubes for recombination, before they can reach electrodes. Developing more scalable and selective methods for high purity semiconducting SWCNTs is important to further improve the photocurrent generation efficiency by using SWCNT-based photoelectrochemical devices.
Introduction

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been intensively studied for photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic devices because of their unique optical, electrical and electronic properties, wide electrochemical stability window, and high surface area.1,2 Individual nanotubes and nanotube thin films can create electron-hole pairs through direct band gap visible light excitation.3 SWCNTs can also act as a charge-transport pathway to improve the transport of charge carriers generated by other light-harvesting molecules, and as nanoscale scaffolds to assemble light-harvesting molecules.1,2 Current experimental results reveal that the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of solar cells based on SWCNT direct band gap excitation is very low (0.15%).4 Various photoelectrochemical devices, containing SWCNTs in their photoactive layers, also show limited cell performance.5,6 The low performances have been attributed to metallic nanotubes because they may cause short circuits, which would simultaneously annihilate separated charge carriers caused by photons.2,7 Thus, using high purity semiconducting SWCNTs is desired to boost the performance of SWCNT-based photoelectrochemical devices.
However, all currently available SWCNT synthesis methods inevitably result in a mixture of both semiconducting and metallic nanotubes. Various methods have been proposed to separate metallic and semiconducting nanotubes.8 SWCNT samples got from most separation methods suffer from several important drawbacks for potential solar energy conversion applications. (1) The intrinsic optical and electronic properties of SWCNTs may be altered during the separation, which may deteriorate their photoresponses. (2) The scalability of most separation methods is poor, which results in too few samples to be fabricated into solar devices for tests or extreme high cost of purified products. (3) The selectivity toward semiconducting nanotubes is too low to display significant performance differences. The improvement of photocurrent generation by SWCNT samples containing a high-density of semiconducting nanotubes has not been experimentally demonstrated in photoelectrochemical devices. In this study, we first optimized a gel-centrifugation method developed by Tanaka et al.9 to obtain high purity semiconducting SWCNTs. Semiconducting enriched SWCNTs were then fabricated into thin films with controllable thickness and transmittance. Further, SWCNT films were incorporated in photoelectrochemical devices as their photoactive layers. The results showed that thin films containing a high-density of semiconducting SWCNTs can improve the photocurrent generation.
Experimental
SWCNT separation
SWCNTs (Carbon Solution Inc.) were first purified by a centrifugation based purification method, which was developed in our lab to eliminate metal and carbon impurities.10 Briefly, SWCNTs were suspended in 2 wt% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution by tip sonication (SONICS, VCX-130) at 20 W for 4 hours in an ice water bath. Then, the suspension was centrifuged at 120000g for 1 hour to remove various impurities and small nanotube bundles. The semiconducting nanotubes were obtained by the gel-centrifugation method.9 SWCNT SDS suspension was mixed with the equal volume of agarose dissolved in TB buffer (100 mM tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane and 97 mM boric acid). The well mixed SWCNT–agarose gel solution was cooled, solidified, and then centrifuged for 3 hours in a swing bucket (Hitachi-Koki). After centrifugation, the upper liquid suspension enriched with metallic nanotubes was decanted; while the lower solid gel part was enriched with semiconducting nanotubes. The solid gel was collected and washed with DI water before the gel was dissolved by refluxing in 1 wt% citric acid for 2 hours. To assess the separation efficiency, separated nanotube samples were resuspended in 1 wt% sodium dodecyl benzosulfonate (SDBS, Sigma-Aldrich) solution for UV-vis-near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopic measurements on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer.
Two enrichment parameters, agarose gel concentration and centrifugation force, were optimized in this study to improve the semiconducting-metallic SWCNT separation efficiency. First, the centrifugation force was fixed at 18000g, while the agarose gel concentration in the SWCNT–agarose gel solution was varied from 0.05 to 0.6 wt%. Second, six different centrifugation forces, including 1800, 5000, 10000, 18000, 40000 and 80000g, were tested on the 0.1 wt% SWCNT–agarose gel solution to find out the best centrifugation condition.
Thin film fabrication
For SWCNT thin film fabrication, unsorted and enriched nanotube samples were both suspended in 1 wt% SDBS solution. The concentration of nanotube suspensions was further adjusted to the similar level using 1 wt% SDBS solution. We ensured that areas under absorption spectra between 610 and 1220 nm from the concentration adjusted nanotube suspensions are comparable. Different amounts of SWCNT suspensions (1, 2 and 4 mL) from each nanotube sample were filtered on mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membranes (Millipore, 50 nm pore) by vacuum filtration. The films were further washed by water and 0.1 M nitric acid to remove SDBS adsorbed on nanotube surfaces. The films deposited on filtration membranes were then transferred onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates following a reported method.11 Briefly, ITO glass substrates (Rs = 7–10 Ω □−1, Geomatec), serving as transparent electrodes, were first bath sonicated in isopropanol (IPA), followed by ozone treatment to remove surface contaminations. Membranes together with SWCNTs were pressed directly on ITO substrates. MCE membranes were then dissolved by acetone, and left only SWCNT films on ITO substrates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the SWCNT films. Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were used to find out the thickness of the SWCNT films. Transmittance of SWCNT films deposited on ITO substrates was measured on the Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
All photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode system as sketched in Fig. 1 using an ALS 630 electrochemical analyzer. The SWCNT film deposited on an ITO substrate as a working electrode was immersed into an acetonitrile electrolyte solution containing 0.5 M LiI and 0.01 M I2. A Pt wire covered with a glass capillary, whose tip was near the working electrode, and a Pt coil were used as quasi-reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A 500 W xenon lamp (XB-50101AA-A; Ushio, Japan) was used as a light source. The wavelength dependence of the IPCE of the SWCNT films was also examined using a monochromatic light through a monochromator (MC-10N; Ritsu, Japan), illuminating the area of the working electrode (0.20 cm2) from the backside. The light intensity was monitored and corrected by an optical power meter (ML9002A; Anritsu, Japan).

Results and discussion

Fig. 2 showed the normalized absorption peaks between 500 and 1250 nm, which correspond to the absorption induced by electronic transitions between the first pair or the second pair of van Hove singularities of metallic nanotubes (M11) and semiconducting nanotubes (S22). The decline of the M11 peak indicates the enrichment of semiconducting nanotubes. The separation of different SWCNT species can also be visualized by the change in colors of SWCNT suspensions. The unsolved SWCNT suspension was black, while the metallic nanotube enriched suspension was dark green, and the semiconducting nanotube enriched suspension was dark brown.

To further assess the semiconducting and metallic nanotube separation efficiency, we used the absorption peak area ratios S22/(S22 + M11) as an evaluation criterion. The larger peak ratios point to a higher concentration of semiconducting SWCNTs in nanotube suspensions. Fig. 3a shows normalized absorption spectra when the agarose gel concentration increases from 0.05 to 0.6 wt%. The correlation between the peak area ratios and the agarose gel concentration was shown in Fig. 3b. The separation efficiency reaches a maximum at the agarose gel concentration of 0.1 wt%. A previous study has proposed that the separation of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes in the agarose gel may be due to the higher affinity of semiconducting nanotubes in the agarose porous structure.9 It is harder to squeeze liquid out of the dense agarose gel when the gel concentration is high. Thus, when the agarose gel concentration is too high, few metallic nanotubes can be removed from the agarose gel by centrifugation, resulting in the poor separation efficiency. On the other hand, when the agarose gel concentration is too low, both metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs are squeezed out of the agarose gel, also resulting in the poor separation efficiency. Fig. 3c shows normalized absorption spectra when the centrifugation force varies from 1800 to 80000g, while the agarose gel concentration was fixed at 0.1 wt%. The peak area ratios increase with the increase of centrifugation forces as shown in Fig. 3d. When we applied larger centrifugation forces, the gel deformed more, and we squeezed out more metallic nanotube enriched suspensions entrapped in the agarose gel. However, there are no significant changes when the centrifugation force is larger than 18000g. This may be because most of free liquid suspensions have already been removed from the agarose gel.

Thus, based on the optimization results, we chose the 0.1 wt% agarose gel concentration and 18000gcentrifugation force as the separation condition to obtain a large amount of enriched SWCNTs. Under this condition, the M11 peak area decreased from ca. 20% of the total absorption peak area before separation to less than 5% after separation. If we assume that 1/3 of nanotubes in the unsorted samples are metallic, the semiconducting nanotube concentration is more than 90% in the enriched samples. Several milligrams of enriched SWCNTs were prepared in this study for fabrication of SWCNT thin films.
The SEM image in Fig. 4a shows the SWCNT film was composed of small SWCNT bundles. The AFM image in Fig. 4b indicates the film has uniform thickness. The height profile from AFM (Fig. 4c) crossing the edge of the thin film illustrates its thickness. Transmittance spectra of films deposited on ITO substrates were shown in Fig. 4d. Table 1 summarizes fabrication parameters, thickness, and transparency of films. When SWCNT suspensions used for filtration was increased from 1 to 4 mL, the film thickness increased from 65 to 259 nm, while the transmittances at 550 nm decreased from 75 to 26%. Two extra films (labelled as U4 and E4) were fabricated using 1.5 mL of unsorted and separated SWCNT suspensions, and their properties agreed with our expected values. This verified the consistency of our SWCNT film fabrication procedure. Overall, these results demonstrate the thickness and transmittance of SWCNT films from both unsorted and separated samples can be controlled for photoelectrochemical devices.

Fig. 5a and b display photoelectrochemical responses of SWCNT films fabricated from unsorted and separated nanotube samples. The films were illuminated with white light (λ > 380 nm) at an input power of 37.4 mW cm−2. No bias potential was applied against the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The photoelectrochemical responses were prompt, steady, and reproducible during repeated on/off cycles. Blank ITO substrates without SWCNT films did not display comparable photocurrent responses under the same condition. Two important trends can be observed from photocurrents illustrated in Fig. 5a. First, the photocurrent intensities increase with the decrease of SWCNT film thickness. The photocurrents generated by the SWCNT films with thickness of 65 nm are 0.84 and 0.74 µA for separated and unsorted nanotube samples, respectively. In comparison, those generated from the 258 nm thick SWCNT films are 0.62 and 0.46 µA. The decrease in photocurrent intensity can be attributed to the recombination of free carriers induced by metallic nanotubes. Electron-hole pairs are generated in SWCNT films upon light illumination. The holes may diffuse to the ITO substrate, while electrons are scavenged by the I3−/I−redox couple in the electrolyte. However, metallic nanotubes existing in SWCNT films facilitate the recombination of holes and electrons. Luer et al.12 suggested the length scale for surface quenching of excitons in SWCNTs is below 10 nm. The thicker the SWCNT films are, the longer the distance that holes or electrons have to travel to reach ITO substrates or electrolytes. A recent study has showed that the metallic path becomes dominating with the increase of SWCNT film thickness.13 Separated carriers from excitons would have higher chances to go in metallic nanotubes in thicker SWCNT films, leading to recombination in metallic nanotubes. We speculated that the photocurrents may further increase with the decrease of film thickness. However, the current filtration-based thin film fabrication technique can only produce stable SWCNT thin films down to about 60 nm in thickness. When SWCNT thin film thickness is further reduced, it loses mechanical stability and uniformity. Second, the photocurrent intensities generated from SWCNT films containing a high-density of semiconducting nanotubes are about 15–35% higher than those from unsorted nanotube samples. This is the direct experimental evidence that thin films of semiconducting SWCNTs can enhance the photocurrent generation. Fewer metallic nanotubes in the films can reduce the quenching channels of recombination, and more holes and electrons are able to reach ITO substrates or electrolytes.

Electrolyte: 0.5 M LiI and 0.01 M I2 in acetonitrile. (c) The intensities of photocurrents plotted against the SWCNT film thickness, unsorted (■) and separated (○) SWCNT films. 
When external bias is applied to the working electrode, it creates an additional field to drive the electrons and holes to the electrolyte and the ITO electrode, respectively. This facilitates to suppress the charge recombination. Fig. 6a shows the current-applied potential curve of the device (E4) fabricated from the sample containing high-density semiconducting nanotubes. We scanned bias voltage to the reference electrode from −0.2 to 0.12 V. Chopped white light was used for the excitation, and the total current–potential curve in Fig. 6a shows a sawtooth pattern. The upper and bottom lines in Fig. 6a indicate the total current values when the irradiation light is off and on, respectively. The inset in Fig. 6a shows deduced photocurrent vs. applied-potential. When the negative bias increases, the photocurrent increases compared to the dark current, and reach a maximum at −1.95 µA under −0.151 V vs.SCE. The easy transport of charge carriers under the negative bias is responsible for the increased photocurrent generation. To further evaluate the photoelectrochemical response of films containing high-density semiconducting SWCNTs, the wavelength dependence of the IPCE of the SWCNT films was also examined. Fig. 6b shows the result obtained on the E4 and U4 devices. The IPCE values are calculated by normalizing the photocurrent densities for incident light intensity, and we used the expression: IPCE (%) = 100 × 1240 × i/(Win × λ), where i is the photocurrent density (A cm−2), Win is the incident light intensity (W cm−2), and λ is the excitation wavelength (nm). The exhibited photocurrent generation has IPCE values of 0.68% with no bias and 3.41% under negative bias (−0.1 V vs.SCE) at 400 nm, which are significantly higher than the values for unsorted SWCNT electrodes (0.60 and 2.81%, respectively).

Conclusions
SWCNTs were purified by a centrifugation based purification method, and semiconducting-metallic separation was achieved by a gel-centrifugation based method. The agarose gel concentration and centrifugation force of the separation method were optimized. The 0.1 wt% agarose gel concentration and 18000gcentrifugation force yield the highest separation efficiency. Our procedure yields a sufficient amount of semiconducting nanotube enriched (>90%) samples to construct photoelectrochemical devices. SWCNT thin films with controllable thickness and transmittance from both unsorted and enriched samples can be easily fabricated on ITO substrates. Photoelectrochemical responses generated from SWCNT thin films deposited on ITO substrates were measured. The results provide direct experimental evidence that semiconducting nanotube enriched thin films produce 15–35% higher photocurrents compared to SWCNT films from unsorted samples in photoelectrochemical devices. Further, decreasing the SWCNT film thickness helps to produce higher photocurrents. The observed trends can be explained by the reduction in the exciton recombination channels when metallic tubes are removed, and fewer chances for carrier recombination in metallic nanotubes in thinner SWCNT films. The results also call for more scalable and selective enrichment methods to provide high purity semiconducting SWCNT samples, which are important to realize efficient solar energy conversion in SWCNT-based devices.
