    , Accepted 13th April 2021First published on 15th April 2021AbstractIn this work, the effects of alkyl side units of double-cable conjugated polymers on the photovoltaic performance of single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) were systematically studied. Four double-cable conjugated polymers with the same conjugated backbone, linker and naphthalene diimide (NDI) side units, but with distinct alkyl units from ethylhexyl, butyloctyl, hexyldecyl to octyldodecyl were designed and synthesized. These polymers exhibit similar absorption spectra and frontier energy levels, but show distinct crystallinity, charge carrier mobilities and photovoltaic performance. Several advanced techniques, including differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray, reveal that double-cable conjugated polymers with longer side units exhibit high solubility, resulting in large fibrillar structures and low crystallinity. Therefore, double-cable polymers with longer alkyl side units exhibit low charge carrier mobilities and low efficiencies in SCOSCs. Our universal studies provide a good example to show the effect of alkyl side units in double-cable polymers on the performance of SCOSCs, which is useful for designing new double-cable conjugated polymers.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJOSCs) with physically blended electron donors and acceptors in the photoactive layers have obtained rapid development in recent years with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 17%,1–11 but there are still many issues to be solved in order to realize applications. For example, under long-term sunlight illumination, two-component systems with BHJ structures tend to self-aggregate to form a large domain phase, which is detrimental to photovoltaic performance.12–14 In order to solve this issue, researchers incorporate electron donors and acceptors into a single conjugated material, which can prevent the self-aggregation due to the covalently-linked nature of donor and acceptor. They can be used in single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs), exhibiting excellent stability during long-term applications.15 Besides, SCOSCs use a single material in the photoactive layer, so that the fabrication complexity and the cost will be reduced compared to the two-component photoactive layer.16 Therefore, it is of great significance to develop high-performance single-component conjugated materials, accelerating the research of OSCs for industrial applications.
Double-cable conjugated polymers use conjugated backbones as electron donor and aromatic side units as electron acceptor, which have been widely used in SCOSCs.17–24 In the previous studies, fullerene and perylene bisimide (PBI) units as electron acceptor have been incorporated into double-cable conjugated polymers,24,25 since in BHJOSCs, their derivatives have also realized high photovoltaic performance.26,27 Naphthalene diimide (NDI) has a similar structure, high crystallinity and deep frontier energy levels with those of PBI, but shows a small π-conjugated system as compared to that of the PBI unit.28,29 As a consequence, NDI-based small conjugated molecules have the difficulty to achieve high PCEs in small-molecule BHJOSCs (Fig. 1b).30 Researchers have also tried to incorporate aromatic units into NDI cores in order to improve the physical properties of the molecules, but their applications in BHJOSCs are still dissatisfied.31–46 Therefore, there are few reports on NDI-based double-cable conjugated polymers for SCOSCs.47

Recently, for the first time, we have attempted to use NDI as electron acceptor in double-cable conjugated polymers.48 We found that the nature of the small π-conjugated system in NDI can still guarantee the electron transport channels in double-cable conjugated polymers and additionally ensure excellent solubility and easy synthesis compared to those of PBI-based double-cable conjugated polymers. When controlling the miscibility of donor and acceptor segments via introducing chlorine atoms into the conjugated backbones, the NDI-based double-cable polymer JP02 (also as P2 in this work) provided a PCE of 8.4%, which represents the highest performance in SCOSCs. This result indicates that NDI is a promising building block to design double-cable polymers for SCOSCs.
The nanostructure of double-cable polymers plays a crucial role in the process of exciton diffusion, charge separation and transport in SCOSCs.16 In the previous studies, the length of alkyl linkers between the backbones and acceptor side units,22 the configuration of conjugated backbones (linear or twist),48 and the post-treatment via solvent and thermal annealing process23,49 showed the significant impact on the nanophase separation of double-cable polymers and hence provided the distinct photovoltaic performance. We note that the effects of side chains attached to the acceptor units on the optoelectrical properties of double-cable conjugated polymers have never been reported. In BHJOSCs, the alkyl chains of conjugated polymers, such as the length, branching point and heteroatoms (Si, F, etc.), were found to influence the photovoltaic performance via controlling the solubility, crystallinity and charge transport properties of the polymers.50–54 For example, the shorter side units enabled the conjugated polymers to have low solubility, exhibit fibrillar structures with small diameters, and hence provide high PCEs in BHJOSCs.53,55,56 Therefore, it will be an interesting topic to change the length of the side units in double-cable conjugated polymers and study the effects on their physical and photovoltaic properties.
With these motivations, in this work, we systematically studied the effects of side units of NDI-based double-cable conjugated polymers on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs. NDI-based double-cable polymers P1–P4 with different side units, varying from 2-ethylhexyl (EH) to 2-butyloctyl (BO), 2-hexydecyl (HD) and 2-octyldodecyl (OD) units, were synthesized (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1c, the polymer P2 with BO side units exhibited the highest PCEs, corresponding to the high hole mobility and high crystallinity with a large coherence length. The crystallinity, charge transport properties and photovoltaic performance in SCOSCs were systematically studied. Notably, the PCEs of NDI-based double-cable conjugated polymers exceed their BHJOSCs based on NDI small molecules (Fig. 1b). Our results demonstrate that the subtle modification of chemical structures in double-cable conjugated polymers has a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers are presented in Scheme S1 (ESI†), which are similar to the previous work.48 It is worth mentioning that the yield of monomers M1–M4 with NDI units is higher (over 70%) than that of the monomers with the PBI side units (yield: 44%).24 The polymerization was performed in a mixed solution of toluene/DMF (10:1, v/v), which is different from our previous condition using toluene as the solvent. DMF as a polar solvent is able to speed up the reaction, so that polymer P2 had a high number-average molecular weight of Mn = 51.5 kDa compared to that of JP02 with Mn = 37.9 kDa in the previous work. P1–P4 with different side units showed a distinct molecular weight, in which P1 with EH side units and P4 with OD side units exhibited a relatively lower molecular weight (Fig. S1, ESI† and Table 1). P1 with the shortest side units showed poorer solubility in chlorobenzene (CB), since it could only be dissolved in CB at a high temperature (>90 °C). Therefore, P1 could easily precipitate out during polymerization, which is responsible for the lower molecular weight. The relatively lower molecular weight of P4 is hard to explain, and we suppose that P4 with long side units shows excellent solubility. This would reduce the aggregation tendency in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene that is used for gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements, resulting in a low molecular weight, but the real reason behind this would require additional studies.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
Room-temperature absorption spectra in films and solutions are shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 (ESI†). All of the four polymers exhibited similar absorption profiles in the solution and thin films covered from 300 to 700 nm. Two absorption bands can be observed: the first band at 300–400 nm is attributed to the absorption from NDIs and the second band at 550–750 nm belongs to the backbone of the polymers. P1 with the shortest EH side units shows stronger absorption at 300–400 nm, indicating its different aggregation behavior. The frontier energy levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 2b. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of all the four double-cable polymers are close to those of NDIs, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels remain similar to those of the conjugated backbones (Table 1). The results are consistent with our previous study on double-cable polymers.23,24,48,57,58 Notably, the HOMO and LUMO levels of these polymers show small variations although they have the same backbones and side units, which would be due to the different aggregation behavior of the polymers in thin films.

The thermal properties of these polymers were further investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. 2c and d. It is clearly observed that all of the four polymers displayed phase transitions. It is worth mentioning that the phase transition temperature decreases as the length of the alkyl chains increases during both heating and cooling processes. This indicates that the polymers with longer flexible alkyl chains have a higher degree of freedom. All of the four polymers exhibited low enthalpies around 5–10 J g−1 while NDI showed high enthalpies over 80 J g−1,48 which is due to the covalently linked NDI side units with limited aggregation tendency.
2.3. Single-component photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic properties of these double-cable polymers were investigated by SCOSCs with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/Active layer/MoO3/Ag. The active layers were spin-coated from the polymer solutions in CB and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as an additive due to its high boiling point. In addition to the additive, we also optimized the thermal-annealing temperature and the thickness of the photoactive layers (Tables S1–S4, ESI†). Besides, we obtained averaged data for each optimal device as shown in Tables S5–S8 (ESI†). The J–V characteristics of the optimized cells are shown in Fig. 3a and the optimized photovoltaic parameters of these cells are summarized in Table 2.

P4-based SCOSCs exhibited the lowest photovoltaic response with a PCE of 5.24% due to their limited short-circuit current density (Jsc). P2-based SCOSCs exhibited the best PCE of 7.97% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V, a significantly increased Jsc of 12.84 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.66. P1 with the shortest side units provided a relatively low PCE of 6.30%, which is mainly due to the low FF of 0.57. We think that this is possibly due to the poor solubility of P1, so that the photoactive layer based on P1 has to be fabricated from CB with a high temperature of 90 °C. This would change the nanophase separation in P1, and hence is responsible for the low PCE. All these SCOSCs have similar absorption spectra, in which the light response in the range of 300–400 nm is mainly due to the absorption of NDI and the range of 500–650 nm is due to the conjugated backbones. As shown in Fig. 3b, SCOSCs based on P2 had a high EQE of up to 0.75, while the EQE of P4-based solar cells is below 0.55. The Jscs integrated from the EQE spectra are shown in Table 2, which agree within 10% of the measured Jscs from the AM1.5G solar simulator. These cells also show slightly different Vocs, which would be due to the different aggregation behavior in these double-cable polymers.
2.4. Charge transport properties by SCLC
The charge transport properties of these polymers were studied by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, and the details of device fabrication are presented in the ESI.† The mobilities of holes and electrons are summarized in Table 3 and the SCLC curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Except for the hole mobilities of P4, both hole and electron mobilities of P1–P4 are decreased with the increased length of side chains. The unusual behavior of P1 is also possibly due to the hot spin-coating process. We also calculate the ratio of hole and electron mobilities, in which the polymers with longer side units show a larger ratio (Table 3), corresponding to the unbalanced charge transport. The results indicate that the longer side units are detrimental to the charge transport, which is also consistent with the trend of solar cell performance.

2.5. Morphology and crystalline properties
The surface morphology of these SCOSCs was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. All four cells have similar surfaces with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of about 2 nm. The fibrillar structures can be observed in these cells, but when increasing the length of side units it seems that the diameter of the fibers is enhanced, corresponding to the large domain size. This is similar to the BHJ systems, in which the longer side units would enhance the width of the fibers, so that the charge separation efficiency will be reduced.

We further used grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray (GIWAXS) to study the crystalline behavior and phase separation of these polymers in these blended thin films, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4. Similar to the donor polymer PClBDB-T (Scheme S2, ESI†),59 all the double-cable polymers display significant π–π stacking peaks (010) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating their preferential face-on packing. In the in-plane (IP) direction, the diffraction peak q1 located at ∼0.15 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 3.99–4.48 nm corresponds to the lamellar stacking of the conjugated backbones. This d-spacing of P1–P4 increases with the enhanced length of the alkyl chains. Besides, the intensity of the peak q2 (∼0.30 Å−1) is obviously high compared to that of the peak q1, which would be due to the overlap of the peak q(200) and the peak q(001) as the repeat units of the conjugated backbones, as shown in Fig. 4a.24 According to Fig. 5 and Table 4, the π–π stacking intensity and the coherence length (CL) of P2 are the highest, while in P4, the CL for the peaks is the lowest. This result is consistent with the performance in SCOSCs. Through the above analyses, it can be seen that all the double-cable polymers show similar packing behavior in the crystalline region, but different CLs of the conjugated backbones. This is strongly related to the charge carrier mobilities and PCEs in SCOSCs.

2.6. Discussion
In this section, we discuss the effects of alkyl side chains on the photovoltaic performance of double-cable conjugated polymers. Except for P1 with the hot spin-coating process, polymers P2–P4 show decreased PCEs due to the enhanced length of the side units, which is very similar to the BHJ systems. In two-component BHJ solar cells, the longer side units will provide the polymers with better solubility, resulting in a large domain size (since the polymer has enough time to be crystallized) in thin films. This will lower the charge separation efficiency and hence provide poor PCEs in solar cells.
In the double-cable conjugated polymers P2–P4, we also observe similar PCE trends. It is interesting to discuss how this phenomenon occurs. From GIWAXS measurements, we can infer that all the polymers form lamellar stacking structures that can be observed in a diblock copolymer, that is, conjugated backbones and NDI side units form alternating structures as shown in our previous work.24 When enhancing the length of the side units, the distance of the conjugated backbones and NDI side units is increased, as also confirmed by the d-spacings of the peak q1 in Table 4. This would be detrimental to the charge separation efficiency. Additionally, the polymers with longer side units show good solubility, providing large fibrillar structures, as shown in Fig. 4. However, we are confused with the relationship between large fibrillar structures and low PCEs, since the donors and acceptors are covalently linked. This will require further investigation in the future.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we have developed four double-cable conjugated polymers for SCOSCs, in which the effect of the length of the alkyl side units on the photovoltaic performance has been studied. The length of the side units has little influence on the absorption and frontier energy levels, but has a significant effect on the crystallinity. When enhancing the length of the side units, the polymers show better solubility and the distance between the conjugated backbones and NDI side units is also increased. Therefore, low transition temperatures in DSC measurements, large fibrillar structures in AFM images and large CLs in GIWAXS patterns have been found in the polymers with long alkyl side units. These cause the low PCEs in SCOSCs together with decreased charge mobilities. Our results reveal the importance of alkyl side units on the nanophase separation and photovoltaic performance in double-cable conjugated polymers.
