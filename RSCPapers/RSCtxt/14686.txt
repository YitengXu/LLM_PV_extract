Tremendous effort has been directed at improving photovoltaic (PV) conversion efficiencies, resulting in dramatic device performance increases over the past two decades for novel, cost-effective PV systems. Nevertheless, performance issues related to device stability, scalability, and flexibility prevent these novel designs from achieving their market potential. For mechanically flexible architectures, integration of new materials such as graphene-derived nanomaterials (i.e. graphene/graphite oxide and their modified analogs with other nanocarbons and carbon nanotubes) may be necessary to enhance alternatives to silicon-based PV systems. Among the diverse solar technologies, perovskite solar cells—most notably organometal halides—have stood out from the crowd with solar efficiencies over 20% and potential for highly scalable manufacturing. Here, we review the use of graphene and graphene-derived nanomaterials in new designs of perovskite solar cells associated with organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites utilized as light-harvesting layers, outlining design perspectives, device characterization, and performance. Recent efforts to clarify stability issues and efficiency control mechanisms are also briefly discussed, and we provide some perspective on the currently available literature and future research directions in the field.Muge AcikMuge Acik is an Argonne Scholar-Joseph Katz Named Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory.

1. Introduction
Renewable electricity capacity represents a significant portion of the total global energy supply, currently ∼27% of total global electricity capacity and more than 61% of new US installed capacity. Among renewables, solar electricity has been the fastest growing technology. In the second quarter of 2015, total installed PV capacity reached 22.7 gigawatts (GW), sufficient to power over 4 million American homes. Cost efficiency is often touted as the dominant driving force, but other factors must also be considered. Looking forward, if solar energy is to assume a significant fraction of global energy supplies, it will necessitate implementation of abundant, environmentally benign, sustainable, and rapidly scalable technologies. Among these, organic1 and organic–inorganic2 nanomaterials are attractive options.
Solar cells as a building block in a solar array of a PV system provide clean electrical power from sunlight. Crystalline silicon (polysilicon or monocrystalline silicon) solar cells have so far served well with 250–300 μm thick active layers and are commercially available with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20%.3 High-performance developments have been achieved with III–V thin-film (a few 100 nm) and ultrathin (5–20 μm) crystalline Si (c-Si) cells. Unfortunately, alternative thin film solar cells such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) cannot reach such high efficiencies due to high recombination currents and low open circuit voltages. Recent developments in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have generated broad interest, including the use of graphene-like nanomaterials, as promising low-cost solar cell technology. Further improvements are necessary for practical device operation such as implementing new high-refractive index nanostructured materials to fabricate ultrathin, flexible, stable and lightweight solar cells.4 With recent innovative cell designs, PSCs have emerged as attractive candidates for future commercialization due to their low-cost, easy scale-up and high PCE over 20%.
Current state-of-the-art PSC devices are commonly based on organo-lead or -tin halide perovskites as light harvesters, especially for graphene-based PSCs. The literature contains excellent reviews covering the use of organic–inorganic halide perovskites in different types of solar cells, focusing primarily on their physical properties such as film morphology, surface and interface uniformity, thickness, material composition, deposition method, and mechanism for materials design, that is, factors affecting device performance or stability.5–16 Several reviews discuss graphene-related nanomaterials and nanocarbons in dye-sensitized, organic, and mesoscopic thin film and quantum dot solar cells.17–22 Here we capture the existing research on the use of graphene and graphene-derived nanomaterials in perovskite solar cells and provide an outlook on future directions in the field. This review first briefly introduces the fundamentals of organic–inorganic perovskite nanomaterials in the context of PSC designs. The context is broadened to overview current PSC device architectures and their comparison with other types of solar cells. Recent progress in emerging graphene-based PSCs together with the challenges correlating performance with process chemistry control and their optimization using several methods of device characterization is discussed. A further topic is chemical synthesis of functionalized graphene from either graphene/graphite oxide or their modified nanostructures via chemical, thermal or electrochemical reduction processes, or their composite derivatives by sonothermal/hydrothermal processes as well as synthesis of graphene/graphite oxide nanoribbons to generate “graphene-derived nanomaterials,” which in this text represent materials used as hole/electron transport layers or contacts. Devices made of these graphene-derived nanomaterials that are further modified by deposition of other layers are named “graphene-based PSCs”. Terminology used for nanocarbons and carbon nanotubes is followed similarly. Comparison will be provided between graphene and other nanocarbons such as carbon nanotubes, carbon black, and amorphous carbon.
2. Structure–property relationships of organometal halide perovskites in perovskite solar cell designs
Semiconducting organic–inorganic perovskites have been successfully employed in PSCs and have exhibited impressive leaps in PCE.2,24 Beyond device architectures, the crystallographic orientation and chemical structure of these perovskites influence the device characteristics and are important parameters to be understood. The generic perovskite formula is ABX3, which is labeled specifically as MAPbX3 or CH3NH3PbX3 when methylammonium (MA) lead (Pb) trihalide (X) is used as the perovskite absorber (Fig. 1), where X is a halogen ion (Cl−, Br−, I−). The methylammonium ion located in a cage is surrounded by four PbX6 octahedra and considered to move inside the cage.
 Fig. 1  Crystal structures of cubic (left column) and tetragonal (right column) halide perovskites with a chemical formula of ABX3, often representing methylammonium lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3, showing that organic or inorganic cations occupy position A (blue) whereas metal cations and halides occupy the B (grey) and X (purple) positions, respectively. The crystal structure of methylammonium lead halides with a methylammonium cation locates on the A-site with lead halide octahedra forming the corner linked network. 
Chemical interactions occur by hydrogen bonds between the amino group and the halide ions; whereas weak van der Waals interactions exist among the organic components of these organometal halides. In a crystal cage, occupation and orientation of the organic amino cations determine the spacing between the inorganic layers; thus, the crystals may lead to transitions with varying properties. PSCs based on CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3, abbreviated as MA+ ion and X = I, Br, and Cl) benefit from tuning interfacial energy levels and control of thin film morphology.25–28 These organometal halide perovskites,29 primarily with lead- or tin-based perovskites, are commonly used in PSCs as the light absorbing layers having a direct band gap, easy solution processability, low-temperature operation with a high light absorption coefficient (1.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm), a long electron–hole diffusion length (∼100 nm for CH3NH3PbI3 and ∼1 μm for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), and high carrier mobility.30–32 Moreover, PSCs exhibit high PCE, low cost, and easy fabrication for solar cell design optimization.15,33 Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites behave not only as a broad-band absorber but also as an ambipolar charge transporter.32,34 Once light is absorbed by the perovskite layer, charges are rapidly generated within the bulk. The band gap in these systems can be tuned between 2.3 eV and 1.6 eV by varying the halide content.5
Tin-based perovskites such as CH3NH3SnI3 (Fig. 2, left image) have also been studied as lead-free systems,35 however, lower PCE was reported in such devices. The organic component is also interchangeable to a degree. For example, the use of formamidinium (FA) lead halides offers a potential design advantage owing to their cheap and simple production. In the case of replacing MA cations with FA cations, the band gap is lower and is tunable between 2.23 eV and 1.48 eV (H2NCHNH2PbX3, FAPbI3).25 The PCE of FAPbI3 has been shown to be lower than that of MAPbI3 with this configuration, however FAPbI3 phase stability could be improved with optimization of the crystallinity and the cell architecture. As an example, phase combination of both in the form of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x as the light harvesting absorber layer was shown to increase the PCE to ∼18%, which could be attributed primarily to improved surface coverage.36 Other mixed halide perovskites were also employed using formamidinium (FA) lead triiodide perovskite with chlorine addition (H2NCHNH2PbI(3−x)Clx, Fig. 2 – right image),37 or even in the form of mixed halides such as formamidinium lead bromide iodide mixed halide perovskites (FAPbIyBr3−y)25 as promising light harvesters.

The structural design of lead- or tin-based organometal halide perovskite absorbers has recently received considerable attention, in particular when studied with temperature-controlled processes, due to the importance of thermal properties in PSC device stability. For instance, varying the deposition temperature in MAPbX3 type perovskites leads to cubic–tetragonal transitions. In this context, continuous, leakage-free perovskite film deposition with desirable thickness has been challenging due to the presence of this type of temperature-induced phase transition between the blend solutions of lead iodide (PbI2) and methyl ammonium halide (CH3NH3X). The presence of uncontrolled precipitation, low viscosity of the perovskite solution, and quick crystallization of the mixed precursor upon drying hampers practical solar power applications.38 Control of organic cation exchange of the perovskite from MA to FA could also result in a material with either a trigonal structure (black color, α phase) or a hexagonal structure (yellow color, δ phase) depending on the temperature-controlled chemistry (Fig. 3).39,40 In such circumstances, several side reactions are likely to occur such as the formation of non-perovskite FAPbI3 “yellow” phase, the sublimation/evaporation of FAI, and further decomposition of FAPbI3. Therefore careful control of the thermal annealing process is necessary to produce high quality FAPbI3 phases. Apart from the structure–property relationships of these halide-based perovskites, device architectures need to be well understood in comparison with other solar cell fabrication in order to address device performance issues. The following section will address these issues.

3. Design characteristics, processing, and performance of perovskite solar cells
With a significant price drop of c-Si solar cells in the large-scale power market, there is no novel solar device technology yet that can compete with the c-Si efficiency and price. Alternative technologies that have been explored include amorphous silicon, biohybrid, buried contact, cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium indium gallium selenide (CIGS), concentrated photovoltaics, gallium arsenide (GaAs), organic hybrids, luminescent solar concentrators, micromorph tandem cell, monocrystalline, polycrystalline, multi-junction, nanocrystal, photoelectrochemical, dye sensitized (DSSC), quantum dot, black silicon and organic polymer solar cells. Thin film solar cells, in which a solid semiconducting film is sandwiched between charge selective contacts, still require improvement to approach efficiencies of c-Si. The most successful thin film solar technologies have been CIGS, copper indium sulfide (CIS), and CdTe; however, they generally require high-temperature deposition, include toxic elements, and rely on rare materials, all of which limit compatibility in multi-junction device architectures.
PSCs have captured tremendous attention in large part because of the capability to fabricate large-scale transparent or semi-transparent flexible devices,41,42 and simplicity of processing, especially after the design shown by Kojima et al. in 2009.43 PSCs' easy optimization for structural design and material engineering,44–47 and projected cost efficiency with superior PCE have also increased their impact.48 PSCs have shown great promise, providing longer electron/hole diffusion length (100 nm and >1 μm for CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, respectively)32,49 than low-temperature processed PVs (∼100 °C),50,51 thus holding a higher PCE of >20%.52,53 In particular, perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx yield high PCEs (4% in 2009,43 10% in 2012,23 15% in 2013,48 and 19.3% in 2014 (ref. 42) and >20% at present).54 Although PSCs provide broad spectral absorption and high open circuit voltage, photon energy is lost to thermalization and carrier trapping as a result of their longer electron (0.4 ns) and hole (0.6 ns) injection times relative to the hot carrier cooling (thermalization) time (∼0.4 ps).32 Therefore, there is still room for the improvement of PCE in these devices, especially via faster electron injection.
To improve PCE in a conventional PSC design, various device fabrication strategies have been promoted involving changing chemistry of the perovskite absorbers or top (anode, p-type) and bottom (cathode, n-type) electrode materials. In a simplified design perspective, traditional PSCs consist of three major layers: scaffold layer for electron transport (n-type semiconductor, e.g. TiO2) (ETL), light absorbing layer (e.g. MAPbX3, perovskite), and a hole transport layer (HTL). As the device working principle suggests, the light harvester layer absorbs visible light and generates a negative charge (electron) and positive charge (hole). These charges are then transferred into either the HTL or ETL layer, which further flow into an external circuit as electricity (Fig. 4a and b). Titanium dioxide has been the most popular scaffold material, which originally was coated with the perovskite as a sensitizer to absorb visible light, known generically as “sensitized perovskite solar cells”. In such devices, after light absorption in the perovskite absorber layer, the photogenerated electron is injected into the mesoporous TiO2 (Fig. 4c). Methyl ammonium lead halide perovskites were subsequently discovered to act as both a light harvester and charge-transporter.55,56 Following this discovery, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have been widely used in alternate solar cell architectures such as thin-film PSCs (Fig. 4d).

The perovskite/hole transport layer interface plays a crucial role for charge collection efficiency by preventing charge recombination near the metallic cathode, but it can also impact device stability. Methyl ammonium lead halide perovskites are vulnerable to environmental effects such as moisture and heat.57,58 Therefore perovskite layers require high temperature stability studies for ascertaining long-term PSC stability. To overcome stability issues, for example, researchers have explored replacing the traditional organic HTL with a conducting CNT-insulating polymer composite. Efficient charge separation also requires judicious selection of a positive and a negative contact material.
Various HTLs have been investigated recently.59–61 Among them, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-ethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) and poly(triarlyamine) (PTAA) are the most studied. In 2012, Lee et al. reported that spiro-OMeTAD acts as a highly efficient HTL layer together with the replacement of n-type TiO2 with insulating Al2O3 in meso-superstructured solar cells.23 Studies with amorphous spiro-OMeTAD indicated that its low hole mobility necessitates increasing the charge density by oxidative doping.62–65 For this purpose, lithiated salts have been shown to be one of the most efficient p-dopants in the presence of oxygen. The PCE of devices using P3HT as the HTL tends to be comparatively low (∼4.5%), which is attributed to significant charge recombination, low hole mobility and conductivity (order of 10−5 S cm−1) and poor crystallinity.66,67 The charge transport in the P3HT layer has been mainly determined by the conductive domains involving ordered crystallites, which could be improved by the application of post-thermal annealing processes as well as treatment with additives and/or solvents.68,69 Composites with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were shown to improve the crystallinity of P3HT resulting in a highly ordered local molecular orientation of the P3HT chains that also varied the optical band gap of P3HT and thus the carrier mobility.70,71 CNTs were also proved to enhance the interactions between P3HT and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) due to self-assembly as a result of a wrapping mechanism of P3HT chains around CNTs.72 In addition to the charge transport mechanism in PSCs with organometal halides, it is also critical that the photogenerated electron–hole pair at the interface of MAPbX3 and the HTL layer displays efficient separation to avoid charge recombination. Carbon-based PSCs have also been reported in which the carbon species acted as an ETL, highlighting another interface of importance in these systems. Fullerenes are one such example as electron acceptors, but these materials exhibit diverse lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels resulting in poor interfacial energy control.73
Another significant challenge of PSCs has been replacement of the PEDOT:PSS hole transport material due to its hygroscopic and acidic nature that has a detrimental effect on device performance. NiO (ref. 84–86) has been shown recently as an alternative material to PEDOT:PSS with better energy-level alignments,74,75 but NiO is a high-temperature processing material that requires a high vacuum-process for its deposition and a further UV/O3 treatment. Graphite oxide (GO) was introduced as a promising carbon nanomaterial shown to replace NiO and other metal oxides,87 but GO also has a drawback due to its high oxygen content. Removal of oxygen from GO by chemical, thermal or electrochemical methods generates the electronic transition from being an insulating material to a semiconductor and finally a graphene-derived semimetal based on the degree of reduction/oxidation. Therefore the solar cell performance is determined by the improvement of the conductivity in GO as the HTL material that ultimately induces the increase of the fill factor which is also highly sensitive to the film thickness in its fully oxidized form. In one study, for example, by sandwiching a buffer layer of spiro-OMeTAD between the perovskite and the GO HTL,76 GO interacted with the perovskite via π–π interactions of the C–C backbone and improved contact between the layers leading to enhanced wettability characterized by contact angle measurements (Fig. 5). Organometal halide perovskites are known to be sensitive to moisture and require control of surface chemistry to prevent environmental effects indirectly affecting PCE. Contact angle measurements are commonly used to understand these interface wettability issues.

Long-term stability is one of the most critical parameters for solar cells in general and is a challenging goal for PSCs specifically. Thermal degradation in the HTL is one of the significant issues; one approach to mitigate this issue is through replacement of the organic HTL with polymer-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) embedded in an insulating polymer matrix. Another significant factor has been the disruptive effect of moisture. Perovskites are water-sensitive absorbers. To overcome moisture instability, a carbon nanotube/polymer composite matrix (P3HT/SWNTs/PMMA) has been implemented as the HTL layer over perovskites.77 This study emphasized the impact of replacement of the organic HTL with a conducting SWNT/insulating PMMA composite HTL that acted as a protective layer on the perovskite layer, blocked atmospheric moisture, and sealed in the volatile perovskite components at elevated temperatures. The presence of PMMA also filled the pores in the nanohybrid composite and therefore did not allow direct contact between the metal cathode and the perovskite layer. A third major degradation factor is UV-light induced instability arising from light-induced desorption of surface-adsorbed oxygen (interacting photogenerated holes and surface oxygen radicals) in meso-TiO2.58
To improve the stability of PSC devices, alternative optimization methods have been reported such as replacement of Pb with Sn,26,27,35 use of mixed halogen perovskites,78 composites of TiO2 and Sb2S3,79 TiO2-free oxides,58 CNT/polymer nanocomposites,77 and layered hybrid perovskites.80 Stability issues arise peripherally beyond the perovskite active layer. For example, semiconducting (p-type) inorganic materials involving CuI (ref. 57) and CuSN (ref. 61 and 81) have been studied in PSC designs to reduce the cost and to sustain suitable energy levels. However, the poor stability of CuI and CuSCN results in degradation.82 Instead, NiO has been employed as the p-type semiconductor having a wide band gap and carrying a reasonable thermal and chemical stability as a hole conductor.83 In such designs, NiO acted as an electron blocking layer with its high conduction band relative to CH3NH3PbI3.75
Apart from stability issues associated with conventional PSCs, solid-state meso-structured solar cells (MSSCs) based on mixed halogen organometal halides also face issues that are mostly dependent on unclear charge separation mechanisms88 although they possess an impressive PCE of >12%, in large part due to broad light absorption and open circuit voltages >1.1 V. In such MSSC designs, the use of meso-structured scaffolds alters the structural properties of perovskites, particularly with remarkable modifications of their grain size, preferential orientation, and unit cell volume, compared to those materials grown with no constraints.89 However, inhomogeneous infiltration of the perovskite precursor is a serious issue in meso-superstructured PSC designs, in which a metal oxide (TiO2, Al2O3, etc.) is infiltrated with the perovskite.34 Metal oxides such as TiO2 and ZnO have been extensively studied as electron absorber/collector layers to prevent leakage currents under reverse bias,90 however they require high temperature processes and carry poor crystallinity and charge carrier mobility.91 Processability is therefore critical to improve HTL and ETL layer designs. Several different techniques have been used to obtain n-type collection layers, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), high-pressure pressing, chemical sintering, sol–gel, and electro-deposition.92–96
In an alternative solar cell design, planar heterojunction (PHJ) PSCs, a perovskite layer is sandwiched between electron and hole conductors that eliminate the common pore filling problem.97–99 The role of conductors in this case is to provide charge transfer between the anode and cathode interfaces. As a different approach to mesostructured PSCs, graphene-derived nanomaterials have been inserted into these devices to improve charge transfer and also to provide lower processing temperatures. For instance, in an earlier study, Wang et al. successfully integrated graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites, specifically designed as an electron collector layer in PSCs, which reduced the processing temperature from 500 °C to 150 °C.100 Inverted PHJ PSCs also offer low-temperature (<150 °C) solution processing.101,102 In these devices, holes are collected through the transparent conductive oxide anode and electrons are collected through the metal cathode. In inverted PHJ PSC designs, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) are commonly used as n- and p-type conductors, respectively, resulting in efficiencies of 10–11%.103,104 Device performance improvement is still required in these solar cell designs, which will benefit from exploration of new stable conductors and interfacial material design optimization.
PSCs suffer from challenges beyond stability. Hysteretic and transient current–voltage (IV) behavior is another major challenge. Considering conditions such as voltage scan direction, scan speed, light soaking, and biasing, Snaith et al. reported scan discrepancies between forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB) that need to be addressed in order to reach an electronic steady-state and stabilize the power output of the devices.105 Unger et al. suggested addressing various causes such as ion movement, polarization, ferroelectric effects, and filling of trap states to determine PCE utilizing proper characterization not to under or overestimate the device efficiency.106
To date, much effort has been directed at overcoming these device process and fabrication challenges revolving around carbon-based PSCs. Novel designs have been explored using graphene-derived nanohybrid materials (summarized in Table 1) analogous to other nanocarbons (summarized in Tables 2 and 3). Recently, organometal trihalide perovskites have also mingled with solar cell platforms beyond PSCs, for instance, in both liquid-state43 and quantum-dot-based107 dye-sensitized solar cells. With such designs, PCEs exceeded 15% in mesoscopic solar cells23,34,58,108 using solid-state HTLs (p-type)30,48 as well as in planar heterojunction PSCs.4 Flexible PSCs109–112 have recently captured significant attention since they can retain 80% of their initial PCEs after thousands of bending cycles, but these applications still require HTL and metal electrode optimization due to the drawback of the use of high temperature processes in device fabrication. Thus significant improvements are necessary to tune the breakthrough light absorbing properties to make high efficiency PSCs with long-term chemical, thermal and mechanical stability. Design of novel HTL and ETL layers is of utmost importance. Among them, graphene-based nanomaterials are an enticing option to address PCE and stability issues. This review targets a strong focus on graphene-based PSCs (Table 1) and their comparison with other carbon-based PSCs. We first focus on a brief introduction to the broader topic of carbon-based PSCs involving CNT-based (Table 2) and other nanocarbon-based (Table 3) PSCs for comparison. Prior to the introduction of the devices based on designs with carbons, fundamentals of novel graphene materials and their composites with other nanocarbons will be briefly overviewed in the following section.

4. Graphene, graphene/graphite oxide, other graphene-derived and carbon-derived nanomaterials
Graphene,113 a 2D atomically thin sp2-hybridized carbon allotrope, is a single sheet (monolayer) of 3D graphite (layered material) and has been a rising star due to its extraordinary properties. Numerous unique properties make it attractive: large theoretical specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1), high intrinsic charge carrier mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), high Young's modulus (∼1.0 TPa), high thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1), high optical transmittance (∼97.7%), and good electrical conductivity (0 eV bandgap semiconductor).114 Although graphene (perfect, defect-free) is an outstanding zero-bandgap semiconductor, it is not directly applicable for solution-processed applications such as sensors, solar cells, ultracapacitors, and batteries. Rather, the focus has been on new solution-processable graphene derivatives, mostly synthesized by modifications of graphite oxide or via direct functionalization of graphite accompanied by further exfoliation to achieve 2D/3D graphene-derived nanomaterials. Many graphene derivatives have been explored leading to complex and confusing terminology such as transferred, suspended, epitaxial-grown, CVD-grown, isolated/free-standing, single-layer, few-layer, multi-layer or bilayer graphene, nanoplatelet graphene, and so on.115 Each graphene-like material will be evaluated individually for each specific PSC design in this review by emphasizing its unique fabrication processes and optimized conditions to achieve high PCE.
This field began with Brodie's116 discovery of graphite oxide (GO) and was expanded further with exploration into its composition by Staudenmaier,117 Hummers and Offeman.118 Reacting graphite with a mixture of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) yields GO, well known as Hummers' method. The resulting material is a non-stoichiometric, amorphous, electrically insulating GO with a net formula of C2O, a layered material connected through trapped water molecules in its interlayers (6–12 Å, c-axis depending on the humidity levels) via hydrogen bonding and weak interlayer van der Waals interactions.119 To make graphene oxide—a single layer—from a layered material of graphite oxide, intercalating solvent, salt or surfactant molecules (i.e. choice of a suitable intercalation compound) with a further chemical, thermal or electrochemical treatment results in exfoliated, expanded, free-standing GO thin films with controlled flake size.120 Moreover, derivatives of graphite/graphene oxides can also be synthesized through either non-covalent121 or covalent122,123 chemical functionalization with nanoparticles, organic compounds, polymers, biomaterials,124 or via doping.125 Each synthesis treatment creates a different GO material (i.e. change in chemistry) altering its oxidation level,126–128 thus requiring characterization as a new nanomaterial with novel physical, optical, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties.129,130
GO has favorable characteristics for use as a transparent conductor with sheet resistances as low as 102–103 Ω per square with 80% transmittance for 550 nm light.131 In solar power technology, various hybrids of GO have been employed in the form of composites with other nanocarbons, metals or polymers. Examples include its use as semitransparent electrodes comprised of GO/CNT composites in heterojunction solar cells,132 as an interfacial anode layer by deposition of a cationic polyelectrolyte poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride) (PDDA) on GO,133 as a GO/GO-Cs (cesium neutralized GO) bilayer modified with ultrathin Al and MoO3 for polymer tandem solar cells,134 as nitrogen/sulfur doped GO counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),135 as hole and electron extraction layers136 for polymer solar cells implemented as chlorinated GO for an anode interface layer,137 GO/oxygen deficient MoO3−x bilayer for a hole transport layer,138 and as an interface material in graphene/GO/Si solar cells.139
Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been another option in this materials family, most frequently as a HTL in PV technologies replacing the more traditional PEDOT:PSS for high-efficiency polymer organic solar cells.140 RGO has also been reported as a transparent electrode in OPV devices.141 Additional studies utilize RGO-based composites as an electron acceptor in a RGO/P3HT hybrid solar cell,142 a counter electrode in CoS/RGO,143 MoS2/RGO–CNTs composite counter electrode,144 multiwalled carbon nanotube/RGO nanoribbons as counter electrodes,145 TiO2/RGO photoanode146 in DSSCs, TiO2/RGO as ETLs in inverted hybrid bulk-heterojunction solar cells,147 RGO/GO nanocomposites as a hole collection material in PSCs,148 and as composites of RGO with metallic clusters such as Cu2S counter electrode materials as highly efficient quantum dot solar cells.149
Graphene-derived nanomaterials are often applied in solar cell designs,150 but CVD-grown graphene applications have been limited, so only basic material design characteristics have been discussed. Structure–property relationships of other graphene-derived nanomaterials are routinely explored, but as of yet there is no well-controlled chemistry or a clearly optimized fabrication process. Due to the non-stoichiometric nature of these nanomaterials with unclear chemical empirical formulae, structural evaluation is limited; this also restricts complete process understanding. Considering all of the aforementioned approaches of graphene derivatives for high-efficiency and highly stable solar cell manufacturing, fundamentals for processes are not yet clear enough to enable an industrial manufacturing approach. As other reviews18,151–154 provide an ample background, comprehensive synthesis and production details of graphene-derived nanomaterials are not provided here. We focus instead on fabrication details specifically associated with graphene-derived nanomaterials implemented in perovskite solar cell devices. The following sections of this review first discuss carbon/carbon nanotube-based PSCs to provide design and device perspective. Graphene-based PSCs are then extensively discussed. Design challenges specific to each device are briefly introduced, with correlated discussions regarding processes affecting integration of these graphene-derived nanomaterials.
5. Carbon-derived nanomaterials in perovskite solar cells: material design & device implementation
Any large-scale energy technology will necessarily depend on low-cost, scalable materials. Carbon is abundant and widely explored as an alternative material in PV devices. In particular, carbon derivatives provide promising PSC designs with their potential low cost, high chemical stability, and appropriate energy levels. In practice, various types of carbon-derived nanomaterials such as CNTs, carbon fibers, carbon black and graphene have been employed and resulted in impressive PCE values in these devices, particularly among other solution-processed devices.155–158 Nanocarbons have received increasing attention as electrode materials because of their lower cost compared with noble metal cathode materials (Au or Ag) and as a support material in the light absorbing layers to improve flexibility and scalability. Substitution of amorphous silicon with proper nanocarbons can also provide HTL-free or ITO-free PSC designs, which is advantageous in terms of reducing the manufacturing cost and improving the stability.
Commercial carbon paste is a suitable, low-cost carbon nanomaterial that exhibits significant performance improvement owing to its high conductivity, high stability, and low-temperature (∼100 °C) process operation. In dye-sensitized solar cells and HTL-free PSCs, carbon black and graphite have been employed as counter electrodes.159,160 Beyond nanocarbon-derived electrode materials, highly ordered mesoporous carbon further improved the performance of PSCs.161,162 High surface area, regular and tunable pore sizes coupled with stable nanostructured frameworks in such synthesized nanocarbons allowed formation of mesopores and interconnected structures favoring perovskite precursor penetration through the pores. Enhanced penetration provides effective contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and the nanocarbon. Moreover, HTL-free PSCs received several improvements for perovskite layer designs. For instance, Han et al. also showed that use of 5-ammoniumvaleric acid iodide in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer as a light absorbing layer reasonably increased PCE compared to non-iodide applications.163 Since the diffusion length of CH3NH3PbI3 is ∼100 nm, which is smaller than that of ZrO2 (thickness ∼ 1–2 μm), the presence of CH3NH3PbI3 enhanced hole transport into the counter electrode thereby improving the PCE.31,32
Carbon-based PSCs have been developed with various designs based on their degree of transparency, such as fabrication of semi-transparent devices. Recent developments in such transparent devices utilize perovskite islands with Au transparent electrodes,39,164 obtained by thermally annealing perovskite layers along with a thin Au electrode,165 using Ag nanowire electrodes as transparent layers,166 or with Ni mesh top electrodes and fluorine doped tin oxide bottom electrodes.167 Design of these transparent electrodes must also provide low sheet resistance, high chemical stability, effective charge collection as well as high transparency and cost efficiency. Among all conductive nanomaterials such as conductive polymers,168,169 CNTs,170–172 and metallic nanowires139,173 used as transparent electrodes, graphene113,115 is a strong candidate owing to its high conductivity, superior transparency, and smooth surface coverage. Graphene has also shown remarkable properties involving high thermal conductivity and high optical transmittance174–176 in addition to its superior physical and mechanical properties.177
The latest development in graphene-based PSC designs is the use of graphene-derived nanomaterials (either in 2D as layered nanomaterials in the form of thin films or 3D nanoporous structured materials). Tremendous improvements in such device designs, especially compared with other nanocarbon-derived PSCs, originate from the necessity for solution processing. RGO, derived from the graphene oxide precursor by either thermal annealing, electrochemical reduction/functionalization, or treatment by chemical reduction, is a powerful example. All of these methods provide efficient solution dispersibility and a high degree of solubility, but the large defect concentration of the resulting RGO materials degrades the electronic properties.178,179 Recent studies have shown that liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite powders using organic solvents produces higher quality graphene flakes.180,181 Improvements in material properties boosted the PCEs for graphene-based PSCs. However, further improvements are still required at the perovskite/graphene interface of PSC designs for better device stability, flexibility, and therefore scalability. For this purpose, the following section will discuss design challenges and device improvements in graphene-based PSCs.
6. Graphene-derived nanomaterials in perovskite solar cells: challenges & efficiency improvement
In a simple conventional PSC design, semiconductor nanomaterials such as graphene or its derivatives are used either as an n-type ETL (electron transport layer) or p-type HTL (hole transport layer). Indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) are the common substrates onto which a HTL layer is deposited using either liquid or vapor processing techniques. These substrates are expensive and their poor mechanical properties (extremely brittle), toxicity, and material abundance limitations suggest the need for alternative substrates. Graphene derivatives have been demonstrated as highly capable nanoelectrodes with their high conductivity (low sheet resistance), high transparency (∼97.4% with a sheet resistance of 100 ohm per sq.)53 and good mechanical flexibility to fabricate ITO- or FTO-free PSCs. Compared to semitransparent Al-based contacts182 having an optical transmission of only 30% and even their alternatives using silver nanowire mesh electrodes (max. transmission of 89.5%),183 graphene represents an exciting option.
Multilayer semiconductors with different band gaps can function with increased light absorption efficiency. For instance, first-principle calculations indicate that a bilayer semiconductor with optimum band gaps of 1.64 eV and 0.94 eV is expected to reach 44% power conversion efficiency, and a three-layer design with band gaps of 1.83, 1.16, and 0.71 eV increases it to 48%.22 PCE could be further boosted to 64% with an infinite number of layers, which is in principle possible with a gradual variation in the doping levels of the semiconductors or even by addition of impurities generating a novel variable-band gap design. In this context, layered graphene derivatives appear promising. Although increase of graphene film thickness decreases transparency, the absorption coefficient of the films is maintained by allowing complete solar radiation conversion and photoelectron transport. Combination of both its superior electrical and thermal conductivity hints at outstanding solar-power efficiencies. Control of band gap variation of graphene depends on chemical functionalization and edge modification. Chemistry control in these graphene-derived nanomaterials alters the lateral sheet/ribbon dimensions, number of monolayers, defect concentration, types of defects, degree of functionalization, and type of modification of the basal plane or the edges therefore varying their electrical, optical, mechanical and electronic properties. Furthermore, tailoring the graphene chemistry generates new derivatives with novel properties such as low sheet resistance and therefore superior electrical conductivity. In a recent report, Eletskii et al. reviewed graphene-derived polymer or dye-sensitized solar cell materials and showed that there is a strong correlation between the transparency of the graphene layer and the sheet resistivity; however, PCEs of these devices fall within the 0.1–4.1% range using rGO, rGO-CNTs, CVD-graphene, multilayer CVD-graphene and also doped with organic and inorganic materials.22 The PCE in related device architectures varies from 0.26 to 9.7% using either rGO, graphene platelets or composites with CNTs, and various polymers as electrodes in DSSCs. These statistical reviews highlight the importance of the sheet resistivity and electrical conductivity. Although there is a significant correlation between them, there are some other factors that influence device function. In the following section, several different graphene derivatives and their roles as either HTLs or ETLs in PSC designs are discussed. Key parameters in the chemical modification of graphene derivative materials are also reviewed together with major challenges for PSC device optimization.
7. Hole transport layers of carbon/graphene-based perovskite solar cells
Transparent graphene184 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)185,186 have been integrated broadly as counter electrodes in DSSCs; recent developments have shown their successful implementation in PSC designs as well.187,188 In such applications, in order to collect and transport charge in PSCs, 1D nanomaterials such as CNTs could be used; however, their 1D nature and high manufacturing cost suggest the need for alternative technologies. 0D fullerenes and 3D graphite or carbon black were also used as HTLs, but these materials produce devices with very low PCEs.155,189,190 Graphene, in contrast, has excelled because of its capability to enhance electron/hole transfer properties. Prior to discussing recent graphene designs for PSCs, various HTL designs based on other nanocarbons will be discussed for context.
7.1. Carbon nanotube-based hole transport layers
Several designs have been elucidated by implementing various different kinds of CNTs as HTLs. One approach is to use Ti/TiO2 nanotube arrays as an electron conducting layer for the perovskite absorber layer (CH3NH3PbI3).191 In such a PSC design, transparent CNTs blended with 2,20,7,70-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,90-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) for better hole conduction were deposited on the perovskite layer (Fig. 6) and served as a hole conductor. The design with CNTs/spiro-OMeTAD blend led to a PCE of ∼8.3% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−1), one of the highest PCEs achieved for TiO2 nanotube-based PSCs. Incorporation of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) into the carbon layer was also tested by Li et al. as the counter electrode, in which SWNTs acted as a HTL (Fig. 7).192 In such a CNT-based PSC design, SWCNT-doped graphite/carbon black counter electrodes were deposited over a CH3NH3PbI3 light harvester layer without using a HTL such as spiro-OMeTAD and resulted in a PCE up to 14.7%. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to test the ability of charge extraction, which confirmed that addition of SWNTs to make SWCNTs/carbon composite counter electrodes increased the work function. Fig. 8 summarizes two different trials by comparing two films with SWNTs (0.05%) and without SWNTs (0%) from UPS characterization. The measurements showed that the cutoff energy was calculated to be 16.52 and 17.12 eV, respectively, which corresponded to work functions of 4.70 and 4.10 eV, respectively. The charge-transport dynamics of SWNT-based PSCs was also investigated by Aitola et al. using the intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) technique (Fig. 9) for PSCs resulting in an average PCE of 13.6%.193 IMPS measurements were performed on the spiro-OMeTAD + Au and SWCNT:spiro-OMeTAD cells and investigated for charge-transport time dependence on short-circuit current. The results indicated that SWCNT films could replace gold electrodes without significant reduction of charge-collection efficiency under short-circuit conditions with a PSC design of a hybrid hole–transporting material–counter electrode based on a thin single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) film and drop-cast spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. Spiro-OMeTAD could also be replaced by incorporation of CNTs as a HTL combined with PMMA and the light harvester layer of CH3NH3PbBr3 (Fig. 10).194 In a different study, a thin poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) layer was developed to functionalize and modify CNTs for fabrication of the counter electrodes of a mesoscopic carbon nanotube-based PSC without the need for a HTL layer (Fig. 11c).195 As shown by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements in Fig. 11a and b, respectively, thin P3HT layer modified-CNT films were synthesized via crosslinking of P3HT through a strong π–π interaction serving as a polymer binder, which improved the conductivity and modified the perovskite interface contact of the counter electrode. In such a PSC design, P3HT also acted as a hole transporter to inhibit electron transfer into CNTs, and its hydrophobic nature enhanced the moisture resistance resulting in an increase of the cell stability.

In a different study implementing CH3NH3PbI3 into TiO2 as the light absorbing layer, conductive bamboo-structured carbon nanotubes (BCNs) were used together with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a hole transport material, as shown in Fig. 12a by a cross-sectional SEM image (with Au as the top contact). It should be noted that the presence of BCNs improved P3HT crystallinity and thus allowed faster interfacial charge transport between the MAPbI3/TiO2 light absorbing layer and P3HT. Such a design also led to large compact grains correlated with significantly reduced charge recombination.196 Moreover, PCE was measured as 8.3% in the presence of 1 wt% of BCNs, a significant increase compared with that of only P3HT and higher or lower concentrations of BCNs (Fig. 12b). These test results therefore confirmed that the device performance is highly dependent on the BCN composition with P3HT as the HTL layer. To study the evolution of the interfacial charge transfer process between the HTL layer prepared using P3HT/BCN composites and the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite light absorbing layer, a photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was provided (Fig. 13).196 Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy ensures detection of the material quality, identification of spectral emission with specific emissive states or study of energy transfer from one component to another for solar cells. As for the characterization of the interfacial charge transfer in CNT-based PSCs, the quenching behavior in the PL spectrum confirmed the dissociation mechanism of an exciton (electron–hole pair) into an electron and a hole. Time-dependent PL spectroscopy also showed that the PL quenching was two times faster with the P3HT/BCN layer interfaced with the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer, suggesting an efficient charge separation at the perovskite–HTL interface, thus reducing the interfacial charge carrier recombination. In the presence of CNTs, strong photoluminescence at ∼770 nm (Fig. 14) was shown to be suppressed indicating an efficient charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to CNTs. CNTs therefore provided significant hole collection and transport to the external circuit compared to the Au-based PSC designs.170 All of the above discussions support the fact that nanostructured materials perform well due to their high surface area allowing high levels of light absorption, thus rendering them advantageous to device architectures and performance.

HTL layers are often utilized as protectants against environmental degradation, especially to seal the perovskite active layer and therefore mitigate atmospheric effects. A common issue with exposure of perovskite films to air at elevated temperatures is structural deformation driven by introduction of water molecules into the crystal structure.197 PSC stability is highly dependent on the hydrophobicity, permeability, and density of the hole-transporting material. In the case of chemical stability of the perovskite layer in a polymer-wrapped CNT-based PSC design, there are several reports on their use as the HTL layer—a superior protectant, particularly against moisture. It has been shown that spiro-OMeTAD doped with lithium trifluoromethane sulfonamide (Li-TFSI) as the HTL resulted in the degradation of the perovskite to lead iodide (PbI2) due to its hygroscopic nature introducing moisture into the perovskite layer. Development of non-hygroscopic HTL materials is necessary for use in PSC designs. An insulating hydrophobic polymer such as poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) could inhibit this hydrophilic effect and thereby avoid degradation of the perovskite layer. However, PMMA does not have π-conjugation and acts as an insulator. To overcome this obstacle, a conductive polymer is applied to maintain charge collection; an insulator/hole-conductor polymer composite is beneficial to both increase the charge collection and transfer within the HTL layer.198 Similarly, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were shown to solve this conductivity problem (Fig. 15) by acting as a charge transporter. SWNTs can also maintain chemical stability with the presence of conducting P3HT taking a role as the protective layer for the perovskite in a device stack of FTO/TiO2/Al2O3 + CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT/SWNTs/PMMA/Ag.77 In the case of incorporating P3HT in such devices, the solubility of SWNTs could be improved when wrapped with P3HT,71 which act as a p-type hole-selective collection layer in such SWNT-based PSC devices.199,200

In recent reports, polymer-wrapped CNTs were studied as HTLs and shown to enhance charge extraction through undoped spiro-OMeTAD.188 The effect of moisture on these polymer-based PSCs was tested, and the presence of PMMA or polycarbonate (PC) was found to enhance the water resistance of perovskite layers. A recent study77 illustrates the presence of SWNTs blended in a P3HT polymer network together with the use of spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 16a) as the HTL. Improvement was observed at room temperature, but further annealing treatments reduced the PCE in such devices. Therefore an alternative approach has been the use of P3HT blended with SWNTs as an interlayer sandwiched between an Al2O3/perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD (HTL layer) using Ag as the top contact (Fig. 16b). In these architectures, individual SWNTs (shown in a magnified SEM image, Fig. 16d) could be observed as the interface between the alumina and spiro-OMeTAD layers (Fig. 16c).

In some designs, electron collectors such as Ti foil were introduced into the light absorbing layer and showed power increase of CNT-based PSCs. Wang et al. showed that treatment of Ti foil with TiCl4 increased Voc, FF and Jsc, which they explain by the smoothing effect of TiCl4 for the Ti foil surface allowing for a flatter perovskite surface.191 TNT arrays grown by electrochemical anodization on Ti foil were used as an electron collector embedded into the perovskite layer, and a CNT network with spiro-OMeTAD served as the hole collector transparent electrode in these devices. The PCE improved to ∼7.4% (Fig. 17 with the summary table).

Flexibility in PSCs is a significant requirement for their roll-to-roll manufacturing and easy installation in real-world applications and integration, especially for buildings. Therefore, bending tests have been used frequently for CNT-based PSCs, as an example with Wang et al.'s study shown in Fig. 18.191 For such purposes, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated by conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely integrated into device fabrication as a flexible substrate.102,103,109–111 The structural conformation and morphology of the films of each layer design can determine the long-term stability of the device, but mechanical resistance to stress is also a durability-determining factor. Flexibility is a key parameter to fabricate long-life PSCs with large-area manufacturing involving graphene-derived materials, and therefore bending tests are of great importance to test the device flexibility. As an example, for this purpose, the mechanical flexibility of PET/ITO- and PET/AZO/Af/AZO-based perovskite devices was measured, and the latter device exhibited excellent performance with only modest PCE degradation from 7.97% to 7.65%, mainly due to reduced fill factors as shown in Fig. 19 and in Table 4. These devices on glass/ITO substrates also performed much better with increased PCE to 11.9%, higher than that of PET/AZO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO (see Table 5), although of course those devices were not mechanically flexible.

In addition to HTL layer modifications, metal top contacts also influence the device performance, particularly based on their deposition procedure. Several approaches have been studied, usually in HTL-free PSC designs. To lower the fabrication cost and eliminate high temperature deposition processes, substitution of the metal electrode layers is necessary. Accordingly, replacement of evaporated metal (Au/Ag) electrodes with low-cost materials avoids excess energy consumption. Li et al. demonstrated the potential use of CNTs as a charge collector in a CH3NH3PbI3/CNT-based solar cell and eliminated the use of both the metal electrode and the hole transporter.170 In such a HTL-free design, CH3NH3PbI3 served as a hole transport layer in the device as shown in Fig. 20 and enabled CH3NH3PbI3/Au solar cells with a PCE of 8% without utilizing a HTL, which greatly simplifies the device fabrication process.201,202

Although spiro-OMeTAD has been widely used as the HTL for high PCE, necessary doping for improvement of intrinsic charge mobility of spiro-OMeTAD has been a drawback since dopants are considered a central cause of poor stability. Therefore, recent research efforts have been focused on finding new HTL alternatives for long-term stability in order to prevent device degradation by facilitating higher carrier mobility, improved solubility for fabrication and commercialization, and providing a compatible highest occupied molecular orbital energy level to the perovskite underlayer. Various π-conjugated materials, especially conducting polymers, have shown promise in this regard.203 Such polymer embedded HTLs typically employ thiophene- and pyrrole-derived conducting polymers to replace spiro-OMeTAD. In a study with a semiconducting benzodithiophene polymer, poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C), the HTL was replaced for fabrication of dopant-free PSCs.204 To avoid doped spiro-OMeTAD and mitigate device degradation of lead halide based PSCs, a solution processable diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymer (PDPP3T) has recently been studied by Dubey et al., which is a p-type conducting polymer with a high hole mobility for efficient hole extraction.205 Spiro-OMeTAD carries other potential drawbacks for commercialization such as its polydisperse nature, leading to limited characterization, batch-to-batch variation, and poor purity that lowers production yield. In order to address such issues for a low-cost PSC design, a dithiophene-fluorene derived hole transporter has shown promise. Saliba et al. introduced a new design of 2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino) spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,9′-fluorene] as a family of high-performance HTLs.206 Fluorene derivatives as polymers have been widely studied to replace spiro-OMeTAD. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) has been widely used as an electron acceptor.207 In some PSC designs, composites comprised of PCBM with thermally evaporated C60 and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) on top of the perovskite layer were shown to planarize the perovskite interface and facilitate electron extraction and hole blocking.208,209 In related systems, modification of the interlayer between PCBM and C60 using Rhodamine 101 improved electron collection to build transparent conductive-oxide free PSCs.210 Apart from modification or replacement of spiro-OMeTAD, HTL-free PSC designs have gained significant interest in order to avoid oxidation, reduce fabrication cost, and enhance the stability with consistent device designs.211 These systems require a deep understanding of new interfaces formed between the perovskite layer and contacts as well as perovskite–ETL interfaces as a result of such HTL-free PSC production.
7.2. Nanocarbon-based hole transport layer-free designs
To lower the cost of counter electrode fabrication in PSCs, various nanostructured carbons155,161 have been promoted as potential counter electrodes in the form of nanocomposites for hole-conductor-free PSC designs. Herein the discussion is based on HTL-free PSC designs derived from nanocomposites of carbon materials since most attempts to apply nanocarbons as HTL materials have been unsuccessful. Until now, various HTL-free PSC solar devices have been fabricated involving designs of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon(MAPbI3), TiO2/NiO/carbon(MAPbI3), and TiO2/ZrO2/NiO/carbon(MAPbI3). In such combinations as represented in Fig. 21,212 carbon was used as a low-temperature electrode material to prepare hole-conductor-free planar heterojunction PSCs and later replaced metal electrodes. A CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite layer was sandwiched between an n-type ZnO ETL and a carbon electrode hole selective layer.166 Several similar devices were fabricated with varying thicknesses of these ZnO layers, and from these studies, 55 nm (mean thickness) of ZnO was found to be the optimum layer thickness that improved the PCE to 7.3% (Table 6). Alternatively, in devices shown in the SEM images in Fig. 22,213 CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was embedded separately into the carbon electrode layer, ZrO2, TiO2 and NiO layers rather than as a separate light absorbing layer discussed in the previous study. Charge accumulation and fast interfacial recombination at the CH3NH3PbI3 light absorbing layer and electron selective contact layers of mesoporous TiO2 (n-type semiconductor) could be achieved in the presence of NiO (p-type semiconductor) using a carbon electrode yielding a PCE of 14.9%.214 This study demonstrated that NiO as the charge extraction layer improves the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, ZrO2 was used as an insulating spacer between TiO2 and NiO. Similar to ZnO shown in earlier studies, NiO also acted as both an electron blocking and a hole transport material that suppressed charge recombination at the interface by allowing efficient hole extraction.215

In some devices, the ZrO2 insulating layer has been replaced by mesoscopic NiO (p-type) in the layer structure of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon to develop a hole-conductor-free PSC shown in Fig. 23, in which the light absorber CH3NH3PbI3 was deposited in the pores of TiO2/NiO/carbon.216 In addition to the studies illustrating NiO as an HTL in PSCs, NiO (p-type semiconductor, mesoscopic) was also utilized as an interfacial layer between the active layer and electron blocking layers with a screen printing/pressing method for the perovskite and the mesoscopic carbon layer deposition (Fig. 24). Replacement of the ZrO2 insulator with the p-type semiconducting NiO increased the electron lifetime and accelerated hole extraction of the counter electrode resulting in a PCE of 11.4%. The CH3NH3PbI3 absorber was sandwiched between carbon and NiO layers to match the band gap of the TiO2 layer used as the ETL together with the deposition of a compact TiO2 layer (Fig. 25).217 Time-resolved PL spectroscopy was performed for such carbon black-based PSC designs. Electron injection from carbon black/CH3NH3PbI3 to that of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI and ZrO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film confirmed the fast interfacial charge transfer in the excited state as compared to NiO/CH3NH3PbI3 film (Fig. 26).216

A mesoscopic TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon PSC device (Fig. 27) has been recently presented with CH3NH3PbI3 as the light harvester layer without employing a traditional HTL, in which n-type TiO2 and p-type NiO promoted the electron and hole extraction in place of a HTL layer using carbon as the top electrode.218 In such a device design, the interface between carbon and TiO2 played a role where the electron–hole recombination took place and hole conducting p-type NiO acted as the hole selective contact, embedded into the mesoscopic layer of the Al2O3 scaffold (Fig. 28). The long-term stability of such mesoscopic PSCs was tested, and it was found that the PSCs exhibited good stability both in the dark and under light illumination. Wei et al. also fabricated a HTL-free flexible PSC design (Fig. 29), where a graphite and carbon mixture was used as the counter electrode (Fig. 30) resulting in an average PCE varying from 13.53% to 12.87% with a 5% drop during PSC storage over 20 days.219 Encapsulation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer with a graphite/carbon counter electrode increased the device stability, and use of a conducting graphite also maintained a good conducting electrode pressed on top of the light harvester layer doubling as a protective top layer.

An alternative approach is to use a flexible conductive graphite sheet with the mesoscopic carbon layer (Fig. 31), thereby eliminating the insulating spacer layer and the high-temperature sintering processes and creating a new hole-conductor-free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction PSC.220 Hole-conductor-free mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 PSCs were also built with the counter electrode comprised of a combination of graphite and carbon black, resulting in a PCE of 10.2%. These devices avoid the use of expensive organic/polymeric hole transport materials.201,202 Thermally deposited Au is one of the most efficient and widely used counter electrodes in these PSCs, creating both economic and environmental hurdles.221 Cheaper metals such as Ag-based counter electrodes have been reported, but to date these devices are less stable.58 This study also examined the quality of the contact between the counter electrode and the perovskite layer, which affects cell performance and charge transport resistance in the perovskite layer and thus alters the charge transfer process at the CH3NH3PbI3/counter electrode interface. Table 7 summarizes numerous carbon-based counter electrodes and their corresponding PCEs (%). Among these, carbon electrodes with increased surface area in the mesoscopic composition result in a higher PCE (10.2%, Table 7, D), nearly matching the PCE of PV devices with a Au electrode (10.7%, Table 7). Consequently, one can conclude that it is crucial for the counter electrode to have a high surface area for good contact at the interfaces, which is possible with carbon nanomaterials.

Graphite has been used as the top electrode instead of Au in these HTM-free solar cell designs, and an important finding was that increasing the graphite flake size decreased the device performance because of the larger interfaces contributing to higher contact resistance to the mesoscopic carbon film. Composites with carbon black increased the PCE by increasing the charge transport as a result of addition of more interfaces between small graphite flakes (1 μm) and carbon black particles. Mesoporous graphite/carbon black paste was also employed as a counter electrode in HTL-free mesoscopic PSCs using screen printing; this approach achieved a PCE of 11.4% (Fig. 32).222 In addition to graphite-based top electrodes in HTL-free designs, Yan et al. recently demonstrated the use of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as top electrodes in the form of single or multi-layered RGO, derived from GO by reduction at 1000 °C in argon gas.223 These top electrodes were deposited over a light absorbing layer of CH3NH3PbI3 and using TiO2 as the ETL layer in such HTL-free devices. Multilayered RGO-based devices improved the PCE (11.5%) much better than single layered RGO-based devices due to the formation of a Schottky barrier in the former case resulting in better hole extraction. Kojima et al. reported the single-halogen CH3NH3PbBr43 for the first time as a light harvesting layer in PSCs.224,225 The use of CH3NH3PbBr3 as the light absorbing layer together with TiO2 nanosheets instead of TiO2 nanoparticles as the electron collecting layer provided a PCE of 10.64% in HTL-free mesoscopic PSCs.162 In such device designs, graphite flake-based carbon counter electrodes (CCEs) showed higher PCE in the presence of TiO2 nanosheets under ZrO2 with large pore size (correlated with lower resistance in the HTL-free PSCs). CCEs with different pore sizes are given in Table 8. Indeed the thickness of the CCEs had a significant impact on the PCE, with 9 μm-thick CCE showing the highest PCE of 11.63% (Fig. 33).

7.3. Graphene-based hole transport layers, top and bottom contacts
In order to demonstrate successful integration of graphene in PSCs for high-efficiency, it is important to evaluate different designs based on graphene-derived materials, used either as a HTL or a top contact. One such derivative is graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which are promising candidates in PSCs utilized both as an electron acceptor and as a charge injector. In a particular CH3NH3PbI3/GQDs/TiO2 design shown in Fig. 34, insertion of GQDs of several nanometers in between the layers of perovskite and TiO2 improved the PCE from 8.81% to 10.15%.226,227 The improved PCE in this specific design was associated with increased electronic coupling at the edge structure and electron flow from the perovskite layer into the conduction band of the TiO2 layer. Electrochemical synthesis of these single/few layer GQDs modified the edges and further led to uniform distribution within the TiO2 mesoporous film. Uniformity of the TiO2 layer certainly increased the energy of π orbitals and thus enhanced the solar cell efficiency in the presence of spiro-OMeTAD (HTL layer). The increased PCE of these GQD-derived PSCs was correlated with ultrafast hot-electron extraction.228

Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TA) was used to confirm the charge injection role of GQDs in such GQD-based PSCs.32 This is a common technique providing essential information regarding fast chemical kinetics. With such a spectroscopic evaluation, non-radiative relaxation of higher electronic states (∼femtoseconds), vibrational relaxations (∼picoseconds) and radiative relaxation of excited singlet states (occurs typically on nanosecond time scales) are detected. In a typical experiment, the absorbance at a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths of a sample is measured as a function of time after excitation by an ultrafast flash of light. In GQD-based PSC studies, charge carriers were detected within femtoseconds by a separate absorption wavelength dedicated to electron extraction as a result of photogenerated electrons in the perovskite layer due to the presence of an ultrathin layer of GQDs. The measurements for CH3NH3PbI3/GQDs/TiO2 based PSCs indicated a consistent photobleaching negative peak at ∼750 nm and a photoabsorption positive peak at 500–600 nm (a strong photoluminescence peak at ∼540 nm) suggesting fluorescence emission from the perovskite and the intense absorption of the perovskite-GQD interfacial excited states (∼530 nm) and perovskite bulk excited states (>600 nm) (Fig. 35). The photobleaching at ∼750 nm displayed a decay time of 260 ps while the photoabsorption peak at 530 nm decayed within 310 ps due to the faster electron extraction from the photoexcited perovskite to the TiO2 conduction band. The transient absorption spectra showed a strong peak at ∼760 nm with a significant film intensity reduction (∼75% of quenching) in the presence of GQDs as a result of a perovskite excited state, which also prevented charge trapping events. The film intensity quenching was correlated with enhanced charge carrier extraction with GQDs' widely distributed π orbitals that increased electron coupling between TiO2 and perovskite layers.

In inverted planar heterojunction PSCs, pursued for solution-processable solar cell applications, GO was shown as a hole transport layer (HTL) with a favorable work function (∼4.9 eV). When used with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite as a light absorbing layer, these GO HTLs provide an efficiency of >12% (Fig. 36).229 Perovskite grown on GO exhibits high surface coverage and a high degree of crystallization carrying in-plane orientation through the (110) plane, which together enable efficient hole extraction.230,231 Therefore, charge transfer occurred between GO and the perovskite layer, and its surface doping effect on the active layer allowed hole transport at the electrode-active layer interface.232–234 Improvements in such an inverted PHJ PSC design with GO HTL could be associated with the effect of rapid thermal annealing that grew large textured domains in the perovskite layer with a preferable (110) in-plane orientation, which was achieved with the assistance of an additive procedure.104 As summarized in Table 9, decrease of GO concentration from 4 to 0.25 mg ml−1 increased the PCE of GO-based PSCs from 7.9 to 11.1% (based on the average PCE of 30 devices, Fig. 36c), which is even higher than that of PEDOT:PSS only (9.26%) in the absence of GO. The sheet resistance was not directly correlated with the increased PCE which was independent of the GO concentration, but rather dependent on the type of HTL layer.

PL spectroscopy was also used to understand the interface charge transport mechanism between GO (hole conductor) and the perovskite layer (absorber) as a function of film thickness (Fig. 37). In this study, PL spectra showed that large surface coverage and higher roughness of GO on ITO (elimination of PEDOT:PSS as a hole conductor) as a result of increased film thickness resulted in an enhanced contact area and thus efficient charge transfer.229 Increase of the series resistance with a reduced current density was therefore attributed to the increased GO film thickness, which lowered the transmittance of the anode. A thick GO film also exhibited balanced electron and hole transport and therefore decreased charge recombination that was ascribed to the improvement of the rough perovskite layer surface (i.e. improved film coverage) with the increase of GO film thickness. It was found that the perovskite surface is less rough in the presence of PEDOT:PSS than in the presence of GO, which confirmed the fact that GO improved the surface roughness and enhanced light scattering for better energy harvesting. Therefore increase of the GO film thickness allowed higher sheet resistance but also lowered the transmittance, current density and charge recombination.

PEDOT:PSS doped with AgOTf blended in GO was used as a hole interfacial layer, which enabled fabrication based on low-cost processing (ITO/PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/Au) at <120 °C.235 This doping process using a blend with AgOTf in the presence of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx absorber layer significantly improved the PCE (11.90%) compared to conventional devices with polyethyleneterephthalate (PET)/ITO (PCE ∼ 9.67%) or PET/aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO)/silver (Ag)/AZO (PCE ∼ 7.97%). Fig. 38 shows AFM images of AgOTf-doped GO films and their surfaces varying as a function of doping concentration. Increase of Ag nanoparticle (∼10–30 nm particle size) concentration (i.e. doping concentration) increased the surface roughness of GO based on these AFM images and was therefore well correlated with the decrease of the sheet resistance.235 Raman spectroscopy was also utilized to study the effect of doping concentration with Ag nanoparticles in the form of AgOTf introduced into the GO layer (p-type behavior due to the absorbed water in as-prepared AgOTf-GO based transistors). In particular, PSC designs need defect analysis to improve the PCE; therefore, Raman spectroscopy is beneficial because, as it detects the variation in frequency of photons via inelastic scattering, it helps determine film defects and electronic structure variation. For this purpose, shifts in Raman wavenumbers of G and 2D bands in PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO were used to examine the charge transfer from the AgOTf dopant to GO as a result of phonon softening (Fig. 39).236,237 Increased doping concentration was also measured by the increase of the Raman intensity ratio I (D/G), which was associated with the increase of molecular bonds as a result of impurity introduction from the AgOTf dopant. The shift in the Fermi level above the Dirac point of GO was clear from the decrease of the work function in the presence of AgOTf doping compared to that of Ag (4.26 eV) and GO (∼4.9 eV) indicating the hole transfer mechanism from Ag nanoparticles to GO (donor and acceptor, respectively, for p-doping).238 Based on the PCE analysis of such devices with different HTLs, PEDOT:PSS/AgOTf-doped/GO HTLs increased the PCE (11.9%) as compared with the PCE (10.7%) of PEDOT:PSS HTL and almost doubled as compared to the PCE of ∼5% with GO only HTLs (Table 10).

Film defects in various PSC designs could also be detected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In one specific study, for instance, XPS analysis was used to examine the interactions between GO and the perovskite/hole transport layers and revealed that O atoms in GO bonded to Pb of the perovskite surpassing the surface defect states (Fig. 40).76 Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is another surface analysis method broadly utilized for PSC characterization. This technique maps the work function of surfaces at atomic and molecular scales. Thus information regarding the compositional and electronic states of a solid surface is obtained to evaluate many surface phenomena such as reconstruction of surfaces, doping in semiconductors, and charge trapping mechanisms of dielectrics. In one study, for instance, the surface inhomogeneity of GO and its effect on the film quality could be explained by Kelvin probe images (Fig. 41), which also confirmed the presence of surface structural defects due to the oxygen groups of GO reducing the electron mobility. Because GO partially covered the perovskite surface, the presence of the buffer layer was needed to decrease the surface distortion of GO at the interface in the device configuration.

There are also several examples of CVD-grown graphene integration in planar PSCs beyond HTLs. In a recent PSC design with CVD-grown graphene (a bilayer approach) reported by You et al., with a PDMS/PMMA/graphene stack using a layer-by-layer stacking method, the graphene layer was used as the top electrode and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL on top of the perovskite layer (Fig. 42).187 Uniform coating of PEDOT:PSS over the hydrophobic surface of graphene in the design was achieved by the addition of a surfactant (Zonyl FS-300) to increase the contact angle over its surface. Since PEDOT:PSS (5.0 eV) has a larger band gap than graphene (4.6 eV), i.e. higher Fermi level in PEDOT:PSS than the Dirac point of graphene, hole introduction was accelerated from PEDOT:PSS into graphene as a result of electrostatic doping and therefore elevated graphene conductivity. To enhance the interfacial contact with the underlying graphene, D-sorbitol was introduced into the PEDOT:PSS layer at different concentrations (Table 11). Addition of 150 mg ml−1 of D-sorbitol into PEDOT:PSS improved the PCE from ∼4% (control devices without graphene) to ∼12% (with graphene). The concentration of the ETL layer (spiro-OMeTAD) also improved the PCE significantly along with the improvements in the HTL layers (Table 12). Furthermore, perovskite thickness analysis indicated that increase of the film thickness from 150 nm to 350 nm significantly improved the PCE from ∼6% to 12% (Table 13). Therefore, optimization of the perovskite film thickness is another key parameter to be analyzed in PSC designs with careful analysis on semitransparent substrates such as FTO/graphene. In other studies, CVD-grown graphene was utilized as the top contact and used along with Au metal deposition. In a recent effort, Lang et al. showed successful deposition of CVD-grown graphene on a spiro-OMeTAD HTL that was used as a top contact material. Combination of a graphene-contacted perovskite top solar cell with an amorphous/crystalline silicon bottom solar cell therefore resulted in a PCE of 8.3% in a tandem-cell device configuration of glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/CVD-graphene (Fig. 43).239 Lang et al. also studied CVD-grown transparent graphene contacts embedded between a Au top electrode and the HTL layer in a tandem-cell PSC design of glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au as seen in Fig. 44.240 Implementation of spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL layer between graphene contacts and the perovskite layer eliminated interfacial defects, thus enhancing hole selectivity, interface passivation and doping of graphene, resulting in an increase of the device performance.

Chemical or thermal reduction of GO removes the electronic states from the Fermi level resulting in a conductive material formed from insulating GO. In earlier studies, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was implemented as a hole transport layer, which allowed a room-temperature processable PSC device (ITO/RGO/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/bathocuproine(BCP)/Ag) with a PCE of 10.8% and improved device stability—higher than that of devices fabricated with PEDOT:PSS and GO-based hole transport layers (Fig. 45).241 In this study, RGO was obtained through a reduction process using p-hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid hemihydrate and is a promising candidate due to its low cost, abundance, solution processability, conductivity and stability.141,242 Recent time-resolved spectroscopy studies indicated that the RGO/CH3NH3PbI3 film had a faster decay lifetime than that of PEDOT:PSS based films, which was attributed to faster charge transfer at the RGO/perovskite interface and reduced recombination strength resulting in enhanced charge transfer and thus much better device performance (Fig. 46).241 Device stability in the case of RGO was associated with the presence of few oxygen functionalities and the inherent passivation ability of RGO against oxygen and moisture243 reducing the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3.241 RGO exhibited superior photoluminescence quenching ability and more efficient hole generation in perovskite absorbers244 to the conventional PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs.109

As discussed earlier, the chemical stability of such PSC devices is altered by uncontrolled environmental effects such as hydration in the presence of moisture. In particular, HTL layers made of spiro-OMeTAD are prepared by incorporation of p-type dopants such as lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (Li-TFSI) to enhance the overall conductivity,245 or with pyridine additives to generate improved contact between the perovskite and HTL layers.246 Addition of such dopants is necessary to prevent low hole mobility and poor conductivity leading to charge recombination at the interface, possibly due to oxidation in the presence of dopant additives. However, this type of dopant introduction into the spiro-OMeTAD HTL layers degrades the device performance due to the hygroscopic and corrosive nature of the dopants, which encourages dopant-free HTL designs. A recent study by Luo et al. revealed that dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD is possible with the use of RGO (p-type, reduced by ferrous iodide acid) as the HTL layer and spin-coated over CH3NH3PbI3 as the light absorbing layer (Fig. 47).247 Several devices were fabricated with the RGO/spiro-OMeTAD (dopant-free) composite, which resulted in a superior PCE of 10.6% (relatively improved PCE compared with devices using doped spiro-OMeTAD – PCE of 6.5%). Dopant-free HTL layers also retained superior chemical stability (over 85% after 500 h in air) in the presence of conductive RGO embedded in HTL layers.

Apart from HTL and top contact roles of graphene, a recent study by Batmunkh et al. demonstrated replacement of FTO or ITO bottom electrodes with solution-processed GO (CRGO), prepared from a chemical reduction by hydrazine exposure and then deposited over glass (Fig. 48).248 Further incorporation of CRGO structures into the compact and meso-TiO2 ETL layers by thermal reduction during the sintering process of TiO2 improved the PCE of the solar device using CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the light harvesting layer and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL (Fig. 49). This study demonstrated the utilization of transparent chemically modified conductive graphene films instead of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) at the electron collection layer with a FTO/ITO-free perovskite solar design for the first time. Another recent development was made by Sung et al. to replace TCO with graphene in an inverted perovskite solar device (Fig. 50), resulting in a PCE of 17%.249 In such a PSC design of graphene/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/fullerene (C60)/bathocuproine (BCP)/lithium fluoride (LiF)/aluminum (Al), MoO3 was deposited between graphene and PEDOT:PSS to lower the work function of graphene to 4.23 eV (Fig. 51). Fullerene (C60) was also employed as a carbon HTL layer in this device. MoO3 served as an interlayer improving agent for the anode interface by introducing a high degree of wettability at the graphene surface as shown with the contact angle measurement tests in Fig. 52.

8. Graphene-derived nanomaterials as electron transport layers of perovskite solar cells
Various types of ETL materials have been implemented in PSC devices, such as TiO2, ZnO, and Al2O3. Mesoporous TiO2 is one of the most common anode materials used as an electron transport layer, which extracts photoexcited electrons generated in the absorber layer.250 Anatase TiO2 nanoparticle-based ETLs in such PSCs show PCE of >17% while those with rutile TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit a lower PCE of ∼15%; the higher efficiencies are correlated with higher electron diffusion coefficients and lower electron recombination.251 Mesoporous ZnO nanorod array-based PSCs, replacing TiO2, possessed higher electron mobility,252,253 which was first reported by Bi et al. with a PCE of 5% and increased to 11.13% by Son et al.254,255 ZnO nanoparticles assembled with CH3NH3PbI3 improved the PCE to 15.7% as reported by Liu et al.97 If Al2O3 is used as an insulating material instead of TiO2 or ZnO, the PSC architecture is called a “meso-superstructured” solar cell as named by Lee et al.23 This device differs from others in the sense that the photoexcited electrons were directly transported throughout the perovskite layer instead of injecting into the oxide. When graphene/TiO2 was used as an anode material, graphene's high transparency and electron mobility dramatically improved the PCE in TiO2-based mesoporous PSCs.
High temperature processes for sintering of an electron collection layer are unfavorable for low-cost device manufacturing and are not compatible with plastic substrates. Utilization of graphene nanoflakes requires only low temperatures, and fabrication of a mesostructured PSC using TiO2 as an electron collection layer with such materials improved the PCE to 15.6% (Fig. 53).100 In this design, graphene flakes were sandwiched between TiO2 and the FTO substrate. Exfoliated graphene flakes were obtained using a liquid-phase exfoliation technique in isopropanol and used with anatase-TiO2 prepared by a hydrothermal method. Devices were fabricated with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the light absorbing layer, demonstrating a relatively high PCE compared to other graphene-based PSCs. Apart from graphene nanoflakes as ETLs, nanocomposites of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/mp-TiO2 were recently used as an ETL layer of a meso-super-structured solar cell that improved the PCE to 14.5% as a result of interfacial resistance drop and improved charge collection efficiency in the device glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 + RGO/mp-TiO2/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag (Fig. 54).256 Charge collection efficiency was improved by allowing reduced interfacial resistance and enhanced electron transport in the presence of RGO, which was then embedded into the perovskite layer to improve the perovskite-mp-TiO2 interface. Increase of RGO concentration to 0.4 vol% significantly improved the short circuit current density of the RGO/mp-TiO2 nanocomposite based device, thus improving the PCE as shown in Table 14. RGO was also embedded between crystalline (c-TiO2) and mesoscopic (m-TiO2) TiO2 layers chemically, followed by a thermal treatment in an inert gas, in which GO was reduced by thermal reduction to form a RGO layer with simultaneous crystallization of TiO2 and added as an ETL layer in a PSC design of FTO/cTiO2(RGO)/mTiO2 (RGO)-CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au (Fig. 55).257 Incorporation of GO with its in situ thermal conversion to RGO to fabricate an organic–inorganic hybrid PSC device therefore boosted the cell efficiency from 6.6% to 9.3%, as compared to RGO-free designs. Agresti et al. also worked on modified GO, wherein lithium-neutralized GO was incorporated as an ETL layer, but deposited as an interface between m-TiO2 and the perovskite layer (Fig. 56).258 GO-Li introduction as an interlayer increased the work function (4.3 eV) of GO upon Li intercalation, resulting in an energy match with the TiO2 conduction band, increased electron injection from the perovskite into the m-TiO2 layer, and enhanced PSC stability by passivation of oxygen vacancies and defects in GO.

As an analog of TiO2, SrTiO3 has a slightly higher conduction band than TiO2, and charge recombination at the interfaces might be anticipated to decrease as a result of its high dielectric constant. Binary or ternary oxides such as SrTiO3 are purported to be better candidates than TiO2 as ETLs in combination with the CH3NH3PbI3 layers and were also used as a graphene/SrTiO3 nanocomposite ETL in the perovskite absorber layer for mesoporous PSC designs (see TEM and HRTEM images of the SrTiO3/graphene films in Fig. 57). These materials decreased charge recombination centers and therefore improved the PCE to 10%, compared with other mp-SrTiO3-based devices.259 As a result of replacement with the SrTiO3 assembly with graphene, the PCE of SrTiO3-based mesoporous PSCs increased due to the high conductivity of graphene and SrTiO3.260–262 UV-vis transmission spectra of these mesoporous graphene/SrTiO3 films confirmed that 85% transmittance was retained indicating that the film morphology was suitable to be used as an anode material.259 A series of nanocomposites of SrTiO3 with varying amounts of graphene were prepared using 0 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg, 35 mg, and 45 mg and named as S, C5, C15, C25, C35, C45, respectively (Fig. 58). Increased thickness of the graphene layer within the packed structural design of this combination with SrTiO3 decreased the absorbance of CH3NH3PbI3 coated onto the SrTiO3 layer since graphene absorbed part of the light and increased the short circuit current density by maintaining high open circuit voltage. Introduction of graphene into the mesostructured PSCs therefore clearly introduced new charge recombination centers at the interface as an electron transport layer and induced lower photocurrent.

Such devices have been recently combined with integrated flexible solid-state supercapacitors263 with high surface area to fabricate self-powered electronics. These hybrid PSCs48,264,265 are high performance devices that could be charged/discharged at 0.75 V (Fig. 59) and charged under AM 1.5 white light illumination. The device shown in Fig. 60 was fabricated using self-stacked solvated graphene films from the chemical reduction of GO in the presence of aqueous ammonia prepared by facile vacuum filtration as the free-standing electrode for portable and flexible device designs with a high PCE of >19%.42 Using the vacuum filtration technique, a uniform layer-by-layer assembly of microporous graphene layers has been demonstrated for the device design as a result of the layer aggregation and π–π interactions within graphene.266

9. Device performance challenges in graphene-based PSCs: power conversion efficiency control
Device efficiency tests are commonly used to evaluate device performance that is, in general, defined as the ratio of the power output from the solar cell to the input power from the sun. Performance varies based on the intensity of the incident sunlight and is often dependent on the temperature as well. Thus standardized tests are performed under AM1.5 (air mass, special distribution of solar radiation) sun conditions and at a temperature of 25 °C. In that, air mass affects the power output and alters the solar spectrum since air filters the incoming light on earth as opposed to the air in space (unfiltered spectrum). As a result, the solar cell produces considerably less power on earth therefore lower efficiency is measured than in space, as indicated by the reduced percentage of the total incident energy. To test the device performance for PSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been measured and calculated by the formula η = JscVocFF/Pin, where Pin is incident solar irradiance peaks and FF is the fill factor. The energy output determines JscVocFF in the formula, where Jsc and Voc stand for short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage, respectively.
In an early trial with PSCs in 2009, a PCE of 3.1–3.8% was obtained by Kojima et al.43 Upon optimization of the concentration of the CH3NH3PbI3 coating solution, thermal annealing temperature, and electrolyte composition, Im et al. could improve the PCE to 6.5%,107 which was a great success compared to the dye-sensitized liquid type solar cells using a CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br or I) perovskite layer in the design. To overcome the difficulties with the solubility of the dye-sensitized solar cells in polar liquid electrolytes, a solid hole conductor such as a combination of CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 improved the PCE much better to 9.7% based on Kim et al.'s study,30 which thereafter improved to 10.9% by utilizing Al2O3 instead of TiO2.23 Recent studies have shown remarkable PCE values of >20% indicating the enormous promise of organohalide derived perovskites.42,56 Although Zhou et al. were able to demonstrate a PCE of >20%, use of yttrium-doped TiO2 as the ETL to improve electron extraction and transport has remained a challenge due to the high temperature (>500 °C) manufacturing of the TiO2 condensed layer.42 Implementation of fully low-temperature processed PSCs with different transport layer, solution-based processing on flexible substrates generally results in lower device performance.101,112
Graphene and its derivatives have emerged only recently in PV applications, primarily as the hole transport layer or as a conductive transparent electrode. Transmittance and sheet resistance need to be improved without reducing the conductivity in these devices. High conductivity with a good electrical contact has been reported for GO and GO-derived materials for effective electron transport using PEDOT:PSS mixed with GO.267,268 GO has great potential to retard electron recombination in PSCs, making it potentially a superior candidate for replacement of Al2O3 and montmorillonite.14,269 GO was used as an insulating layer in these studies that could retard the charge recombination, which increased the efficiency by 45.5%, from 10.0% to 14.5% as a result of elevated open circuit voltage and the fill factor. For such tests, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed information about different dielectric reaction mechanisms of an electrochemical process at certain frequencies to identify the rate limiting steps. This technique therefore determines the interaction of an external field with the electric dipole moment of the sample (i.e. permittivity), which was performed in sunlight and indicated higher efficiency in charge collection and higher short circuit current as a result of reduced forward transport resistance.76 In some PSC designs, a montmorillonite layer was also used as a buffer layer on top of HTLs to prevent the corrosion of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer,246 reduced charge recombination at the interface and therefore improved the hybrid solar cell efficiency. However, graphene-derived nanomaterials have been shown to be better candidates to eliminate high-temperature processes (such as for TiO2) and to improve the optical and electrical properties of the HTL as a new material for flexible PSC designs.
Increase of the light intensity generates charge carriers (i.e. photogenerated carriers) as a function of solar power. In the case of PSCs, targeted photocurrent of 27.2 mA cm−2 was calculated by simulations if the photons in the range of 280–800 nm can be fully converted to electricity.270 Recent studies, using organometal lead halides as the light harvesters in PSCs, have indicated a photocurrent of ∼20 mA cm−2 that was attributed to the photogenerated carrier loss at the MAPbX3/charge selective layer interface. The key limitations could arise from light harvesting and exciton dissociation, space charge layer and recombination of the electrons and holes in PSCs.271–273 The charge selectivity is therefore based on the choice between the interfacial recombination and carrier transport that determines the charge carrier efficiency at the interfaces. Therefore physical mechanisms need to be understood for alternative device designs to determine the carrier transport and loss of the various selective layers. In such circumstances, to determine current density, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is the best method, which is defined as the ratio of current (number of electrons) to irradiance (number of input photons). IPCE of these devices is expressed by IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)Φinjηc where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the quantum yield of the electron injection from the sensitizer (in the excited state) into the TiO2 conduction band, and ηc is the collection efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. In a recent study, a slight increase in the LHE value as a function of GO concentration was shown, which also enhanced the IPCE by ∼20.1% at the 700 nm wavelength.76 Both electron collection from TiO2 to FTO and hole collection from the hole transporter to the Au counter electrode determine ηc. Electron injection from the perovskite (in the excited state) to the TiO2 conduction band and hole injection to the hole transporter also determine Φinj. To optimize the devices, the graphene content in the TiO2–graphene composite was investigated under simulated AM1.5, 106.5 mW cm−2 sunlight (Fig. 61); it was found that increasing graphene concentration in the electron collection layer increased Jsc and FF but maintained Voc by a slight increase. This behavior was associated with the direct recombination between the electrons of graphene and the holes in the perovskite.

10. Summary and outlook
Thin-film technologies are preferable for highly scalable solar cell designs, thanks to their significantly shorter energy payback times (energy recovery time after manufacturing a solar cell) compared to crystalline silicon modules. Perovskite solar cells shine due to their cost-effective manufacturing among organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells. Although solution processability reduces the fabrication cost, material stability still requires considerable improvement to elevate market realization for such devices. Traditional (CVD) graphene, a 2D carbon nanomaterial, is arguably not a suitable choice for solar cells. Restricting oneself to solution-processing techniques, other 3D graphene derivatives such as GO (thin films or nanoribbons unzipped from CNTs), chemically, electrochemically or thermally reduced GO (RGO), n-doped/p-doped RGO, and functionalized graphene (physical adsorption or chemical functionalization) appear far more promising. These graphene-derived materials, in general, have been used in a variety of roles such as electron/hole transport layers, top contact, or by simple integration into the light absorber such as the perovskite layer. However, currently there is no standard chemical procedure to obtain and fabricate each device layer, and inconsistent information reported by authors can contribute to confusion. When the chemistry and mechanisms are unclear, results are often characteristic only of the individual work and the device operation conditions, thus no current PSC designs are yet sufficient to meet application demands.
As an ETL, graphene-derived materials have been n-doped, following a chemical treatment or by application of a simple thermal technique to transport electrons into the perovskite layer. Chemically or thermally modified graphene-derived materials are tailored by their oxygen vacancy/defect concentration varying the material's optoelectronic properties. Each PSC design can lack consistency in PCE measurements due to limited process optimization in terms of chemicals treated or the temperature applied to the material. Unless sandwiched between a c-TiO2/m-TiO2 or TiO2/Al2O3 scaffold as common ETLs, graphene-derived materials are in direct contact with the light harvesting perovskites. Considering the temperature-dependent sensitivity of perovskite crystallinity, controlled experiments are necessary to avoid PCE variability, which is likely to be addressed by innovative process-based tests.
There are several reports of graphene-derived HTL materials in which perovskites are embedded into the graphene-like nanomaterials, however these studies did not discuss the interfacial chemical changes occurring in the material upon thermal treatment or doping. Also, spiro-OMeTAD as a common HTL was shown to be highly moisture sensitive due to the dopants. Therefore interfacial transport mechanisms are highly dependent on the degree of HTL doping and its chemical interactions with the graphene material, which also tailor the PCE. Recent studies have focused on HTL-free and ITO/FTO-free designs, replacing spiro-OMeTAD HTL with nanocarbons, CNTs, or graphene-derived materials. PCEs of such device designs have been low and process controls limited to date. Future studies will be motivated to boost the PCE, driven by reproducible experimental processes and by optimizing top/bottom counter electrodes made of graphene-derived materials.
Current PSC designs implementing graphene-derived materials face the fact that thickness control of the layered graphene material also varies the charge transport mechanisms, thus potentially degrading device performance. Layered graphene-derived materials therefore would benefit from consistent deposition processes (time, temperature, solvent, precursor selections, etc.) over substrates and controlled crystallographic orientation for mass production, especially when they are in contact with the layered perovskites. Limited materials characterization results in poorly controlled chemistry of each ETL, HTL or light harvesting layer, which needs to be further addressed to develop high-quality solar cells. To solve such process-related problems, studies need to align well with X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques for stability tests and microscopy characterization for morphology. Interfacial reactions play a crucial role in determining the charge transport mechanism as well as bandgap alignment and energy-level match with the underlayer or overlayer material in a PSC stack. Such chemical and physical interactions can be understood by applying in situ or in operando techniques that can be developed for enhanced film deposition control and simultaneous thin film characterization. Large-area fabrication and solution processability requirements limit the use of alternative chemicals, which warrants further investigation.
Nevertheless, it is significant to note that graphene-derived materials have different chemical compositions, indeed non-stoichiometric, and varying material properties that may be advantageous to create new PSC designs with enhanced device performance. CVD-graphene would be an ideal performer because of its high conductivity, high transparency, low sheet resistance, superior thermal conductivity and so relative inertness, but process issues also limit the applications. Although graphene derivatives can be used to improve the PCE of PSCs by a variety of process optimization approaches, manufacturing of highly efficient and stable PSCs still remains a challenge. For future research directions with graphene-based PSCs, one should also take into account that chemistry varies the graphene properties, especially light-matter structural properties. There are many challenges remaining in this research field to achieve high PCE, cost-effective PSC design as well as improvement for long-term device stability for innovative commercial applications. To encourage the next breakthrough, novel layered graphene materials and development of different layer designs of PSCs with controlled mechanisms will be needed.
