Changing the side chains caused the three polymers to have different physical and chemical properties. The thermoelectric properties of BDT-based conjugated polymers have been systematically investigated through fine tuning of the side chains. Among the three polymers, the polymer with alkylthienothiophene moieties as the side chains exhibited the best thermal stability (thermal decomposition temperature above 400 °C), the highest electrical conductivity (1.519 S cm−1), and the largest Seebeck coefficient (413.79 μV K−1). The results of this study can guide the future design and synthesis of high-performance thermoelectric conjugated polymers.
Introduction
Improving the efficiency of energy conversion is very urgent as fossil energy sources are getting gradually exhausted. The majority of the energy produced, especially in industry and everyday activities, is wasted as heat, which has inspired the development of thermoelectric materials. As a novel energy material, thermoelectric materials can directly convert heat to electricity by the motion of an internal carrier. The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, is usually used to evaluate the conversion efficiency achieved by thermoelectric materials based on the equation ZT = S2σT/κ, where σ, S, T, and κ are the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, and thermal conductivity, respectively. Obviously, a large S and σ with a small κ is beneficial for a high conversion efficiency in thermoelectric materials. Due to their low thermal conductivity (0.1–0.5 W m−1 K−1), a different parameter, the power factor (PF = S2σ), is also used to evaluate the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of organic materials.
In the past several years, great progress has been made in the development of thermoelectric materials, especially inorganic materials, which have been designed to have large ZT values by tuning their nanostructure to include features such as superlattices,1 nanowires,2 and quantum dots.3 However, the toxicity, poor processability, and high cost of inorganic materials impeded their application as thermoelectric materials.4 In contrast, organic thermoelectric materials have attracted increased attention due to their unique properties, such as low cost, flexibility, good processability, and generally low thermal conductivities. These advantages make organic thermoelectric materials potentially applicable in wearable electronics, e-skins, etc. Studies on organic thermoelectric materials have been focused on conjugated polymers (such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene, and polyfluorene derivatives)5–10 and their composites.11–15 Pipe et al. reported a maximum ZT value of 0.42 at room temperature for PEDOT using poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as a dopant.16 In addition, remarkable progress has been achieved by introducing carbon nanotubes or graphene in the matrices of organic thermoelectric materials;12,17,18 Grunlan et al. prepared a thin film that comprised a PANI/graphene-PEDOT:PSS/PANI/double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT)-PEDOT:PSS repeating sequence by layer-by-layer assembly deposition, and the film showed outstanding thermoelectric properties.19 However, compared to inorganic thermoelectric materials, such as bismuth telluride-based alloys, thermoelectric materials prepared from conjugated polymers still show somewhat inferior thermoelectric properties. As a result, the optimization of S and σ by careful design of the molecular structure of conjugated polymers has become a key to improving the thermoelectric properties of conjugated polymers.
Benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units, common organic semiconducting units, have good planar conjugated structures and high oxidative stability due to the fusion of a benzene moiety with two flanking thiophene units.20–22 Furthermore, different substituents can be attached to the central benzene core of BDT to tune the energy levels, thermal stability, absorption spectra and solubility of BDT-based conjugated polymers.23–25 The planar backbone and tight packing of BDT-based conjugated polymers can effectively improve the charge carrier mobility; thus, conjugated polymers of this type perform well in organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). For example, a BDT-thiophene-based conjugated polymer exhibited a hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is the highest value among the polymer-based OFETs reported to date.26 In addition, BDT-based conjugated polymers are widely used in OSCs because of their good electron-donating ability.27–30 Although BDT-based conjugated polymers perform well in both OFETs and OSCs, their thermoelectric properties have rarely been investigated.
Herein, three BDT-based donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated polymers, PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 (Scheme 1), with modified BDT and benzothiadiazole (BT) moieties as the D and A units have been synthesized by Stille polymerization. We systematically investigated the effect of different side-chain moieties on the thermal stability and optical, electrochemical, and thermoelectric properties of BDT-based D–A conjugated polymers.

(Suzhou, China). Tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (0) (Pd2(dba)3) and tris(2-methylphenyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) were purchased from Beijing Green Chem Technology Co., Ltd. Anhydrous chlorobenzene was purchased from Shanghai Sun Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. All other reagents, including methanol, acetone and n-hexane, were used without further treatment.
Synthesis of the polymers

General procedure. 
A two-neck flask was charged with 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5b′]dithiophene (100 mg, 0.1295 mmol), 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (136.6 mg, 0.1295 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (5.9 mg, 0.0065 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (9.9 mg, 0.0324 mmol), and the air in the reaction vessel was exchanged with nitrogen and argon three times. After anhydrous chlorobenzene was injected into the two-neck flask with a syringe, the solution was heated to 110 °C and allowed to reflux for 72 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to ambient temperature, the mixture was poured into 50 ml methanol, and the polymers precipitated from the solution. The precipitate was collected and further purified by sequential washing with methanol, acetone, and hexane. Subsequently, the purified polymer was collected and dried under vacuum overnight to afford the target polymer, PBDTDTBTF-1, as a crimson solid (84% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 8.05 (s, 2H), 4.02 (s, 4H), 2.88 (s, 4H), 1.80 (s, 4H), 1.70–0.95 (m, 80H), 0.79 (s, 24H).

PBDTDTBTF-2 was obtained as a black powder (80% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 7.32 (s, 4H), 7.01 (s, 2H), 6.87(s, 2H), 2.92 (s, 8H) 1.81 (s, 4H), 1.60–0.80 (m, 80H), 0.78 (s, 24H).

PBDTDTBTF-3 was obtained as a black powder (93% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 7.62 (s, 4H), 6.98 (s, 2H), 2.83 (s, 8H), 1.31 (s, 4H), 1.27–0.95 (s, 80H), 0.77 (s, 24H).

Preparation of doped polymer films
The polymer solution was prepared by dissolving the appropriate polymer in chlorobenzene. The polymer films were prepared by drop-casting the polymer solutions on glass substrates under ambient conditions. The polymer films were doped by immersing in a 0.10 M FeCl3 solution in nitromethane followed by rinsing with excess nitromethane and drying. Finally, the thermoelectric properties of the doped thin films were evaluated.
Measurements

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ADVANCE III 600 MHz NMR spectrometer, and the polymers were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and molecular weight distributions of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Agilent PL-GPC220) using trichlorobenzene as the mobile phase at 150 °C. Thermal analyses were carried out on a TGA-Q50 system at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere with a nitrogen flow of 40 mL min−1. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements were performed on a HITACHI DSC 7020 thermal analysis system by heating at 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere with a nitrogen flow of 25 mL min−1. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were acquired using a Thermo Evolution 220 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The absorption spectra of the polymers in solution were obtained with the polymers in chlorobenzene; film-state absorption spectra were obtained from the thin films of the polymers by spin coating the solutions of the polymer in chlorobenzene onto a glass substrate. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymer thin films was conducted in acetonitrile with 0.1 M nitrogen-saturated tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. A platinum plate, Ag/Ag+, and a platinum wire were used as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. The reference electrode was calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple, which has a redox potential with an absolute energy level of 4.80 eV in a vacuum, and the half wave potential (E1/2) of Fc/Fc+ was measured as 0.09 V against Ag/Ag+. The morphology and thickness of the polymer films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi SU-70 system. Polymer films obtained by spin coating on silicon plates were used to obtain atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a MiniFlex 600 diffractometer (Rigaku Co., Japan) with a copper target (λ = 1.54 Å) and at a scanning rate of 2° min−1. Carrier concentration and mobility were obtained using a Hall effect test system (East changing ET9000). The Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities of the polymer films were determined under vacuum using an MRS-3 thin-film thermoelectric test system (Wuhan Joule Yacht Science & Technology Co., Ltd, China).
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis of polymers
Based on our previous studies, conjugated D–A polymers generally have promising thermoelectric properties.14,31 To increase the solubility of the polymers, we introduced thiophene units containing 2-octyldodecyl side chains as a π-bridge between the BDT and BT units. The BT unit was further modified with fluorine moieties to increase its intermolecular interactions.32 Three BDT-based D–A polymers with different side-chain units, namely alkoxy, alkylthiophene, and alkylthienothiophene moieties, were combined with the BDT building block to form PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3, respectively. The molecular design principle of PBDTDTBTF-3 with a two-dimensional conjugated side chain is shown in Fig. 1.

PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were prepared by palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization. All three polymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, chloroform, and dichloromethane. The Mn values of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were 23.46 kDa, 37.50 kDa, and 25.37 kDa, respectively, and the polymers showed polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 2.36, 2.27, and 2.41, respectively. The good processabilities and high molecular weights of these compounds give them their good thin film-forming properties. As shown in the TGA curves (Fig. 2), all three polymers showed good thermal stability, and the thermal decomposition temperatures of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 with 5% weight loss were found to be about 336 °C, 385 °C, and 426 °C, respectively, indicating that PBDTDTBTF-3, containing alkylthienothiophene side chains, was more thermally stable than PBDTDTBTF-2, containing alkylthiophene side chains, and PBDTDTBTF-1, containing alkoxy side chains. After doping with FeCl3, PBDTDTBTF-3 still showed good thermal stability (Fig. S7†), but the stabilities of PBDTDTBTF-1 and PBDTDTBTF-2 were greatly decreased by the oxidative doping process. The molecular weights and thermal properties are summarized in Table 1.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 in chlorobenzene and as thin films are shown in Fig. 3(a, b). All three polymers showed absorption bands in the range 350–700 nm both in chlorobenzene and as thin films. The absorption maxima (λmax) of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 in solution appeared at 566, 567, and 579 nm, respectively, and the maximum absorption band of PBDTDTBTF-3 showed a strong shoulder at 627 nm, indicating that PBDTDTBTF-3 has a more planar conformation than either PBDTDTBTF-1 or PBDTDTBTF-2 in solution. The absorption maxima in the thin-film state were observed at 580, 584, and 587 nm for PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3, respectively, which are redshifted by approximately 14, 17, and 8 nm, respectively, compared to the absorption spectra of the same polymers in solution. This phenomenon is mainly due to the intensity of the polymer chain planarization and the interchain delocalization in polymer films. The corresponding optical bandgaps (Eoptg values) of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were calculated to be 1.81, 1.78, and 1.75 eV, respectively, using the formula Eoptg = hc/λoneset. These values indicate that the alkylthiophene and alkylthienothiophene conjugated side chains can effectively reduce the optical bandgap of the polymers. After doping with FeCl3, the absorption spectra of the thin films exhibited obvious changes, leading to new, broad absorption peaks between 750 and 1000 nm due to the formation of polarons.33 This result also confirmed that FeCl3 can effectively dope these polymers in the thin-film state.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of three polymers were investigated by CV. As shown in Fig. 4, all three polymers showed good oxidation–reduction behaviors with reversible peaks. The onset oxidation potentials (φox) and onset reduction potentials (φred) of all three polymers were obtained from CV curves. The onset oxidation/reduction potentials of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were 0.62/−1.59, 0.66/−1.54, and 0.70/−1.44 V, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were calculated using the equation EHOMO = −(4.80 − E1/2 + φox) eV and were found to be −5.33, −5.37, and −5.41 eV for PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were calculated to be −3.12, −3.17, and −3.27 eV, respectively, determined by the equation ELOMO = −(4.80 − E1/2 + φred) eV.34–36 The electrochemical band gap (Eecg) of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were 2.21, 2.20, and 2.14 eV, respectively, by using the formula Eecg = φox − φred. The electrochemical and photophysical properties are summarized in Table 2.

Theoretical calculation
To predict the energy levels of all three polymers, theoretical calculations were conducted using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level in Spartan software 2016. For clarity, dimers were chosen as model systems, and the alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups. The HOMO and LUMO levels were obtained and are given in Fig. 5. All of the HOMO wave functions were well-localized over the whole conjugated backbone, whereas the LUMO wave functions were mainly delocalized on the benzothiadiazole units.

Morphology characterization
The surface morphologies of the polymer thin films were observed by AFM as shown in Fig. 6. PBDTDTBTF-1 showed a relatively smooth morphology; however, PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3, which have two-dimensional conjugated backbones, showed lamellar fibers on their surface. These results indicated that the two-dimensional conjugated side chain could strengthen the packing of the polymer chains. To determine the packing structure of the polymer films, we conducted X-ray diffraction analyses of the polymer films, as shown in Fig. S8.† All three polymers showed a broad diffraction peak at about 20–25° and a sharp diffraction peak at around 4–5°. The broad diffraction peaks at about 20–25° reflect the π–π stacking of conjugated polymer backbones,37 and the sharp diffraction peaks at about 4–5° correspond to the lamellar packing of the polymers, suggesting that the polymers have a long-range ordered lamellar structure. Compared to PBDTDTBTF-1 and PBDTDTBTF-2, PBDTDTBTF-3 has a more sharp diffraction peak at around 4–5°, indicating that PBDTDTBTF-3 exhibited a more ordered structure in the film state.38 The cross-sectional morphology and thickness of the polymer films were determined by SEM, and all the polymer films were approximately 5–6 μm thick. The magnified images of the cross sections of the polymers showed that they had different morphologies (Fig. S9–S11†), and PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3 are denser, which may be due to the differences in their side chains.

Thermoelectric properties
The dependence of the thermoelectric properties on this type of conjugated polymer on dopant concentrations was investigated. Taking PBDTDTBTF-3 as an example, we investigated the influence of different doping concentrations on the thermoelectric properties of this polymer at room temperature, the results are shown in Fig. S12;† five different concentrations of dopant (FeCl3) in nitromethane (0.03 M, 0.05 M, 0.10 M, 0.15 M, and 0.20 M) were chosen in this study, with PBDTDTBTF-3 showing the highest Seebeck coefficient of 124.34 μV K−1 at a dopant concentration of 0.03 M, and with the increase of dopant concentration, the Seebeck coefficient presents a downward trend. The variation trend of electrical conductivity with dopant concentration is opposite to that of the Seebeck coefficient, and the highest electrical conductivity (2.284 S cm−1) was achieved for PBDTDTBTF-3 with a dopant concentration of 0.20 M, and the best thermoelectric properties were achieved at a dopant concentration of 0.10 M. Therefore, the dopant concentration of all the three polymers was selected as 0.10 M to exclude the influence of dopant concentration on the thermoelectric properties of the polymers.
The temperature-dependent electrical conductivities of the three polymers are shown in Fig. 7. At room temperature, the electrical conductivities of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were 0.002 S cm−1, 0.349 S cm−1, and 1.519 S cm−1, respectively. PBDTDTBTF-1 has a lower electrical conductivity than those of PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3 mainly because the conjugated side chains of PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3 favor the formation of planar structures and effectively extend the conjugation length of the polymers, and as a result, increase the carrier mobility (Table S1†),39,40 which is proportional to the electrical conductivity. With increasing temperature, the movement of polymer chains becomes easier, destroying the stacking of the polymers, and in turn, this disorder causes the electrical conductivity of PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3 to gradually decrease.

The temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients are shown in Fig. 8. The room-temperature Seebeck coefficients of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were determined to be 240.72, 36.09, and 60.83 μV K−1, respectively. Generally, the electrical conductivity decreases as the Seebeck coefficient increases.41 In this case, PBDTDTBTF-1 exhibited a relatively high room-temperature Seebeck coefficient compared to those of PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3. The Seebeck coefficients of all three polymers increased with increasing temperature, and the rate of increase in the coefficient of PBDTDTBTF-1 was less than those of PBDTDTBTF-2 and PBDTDTBTF-3, suggesting that the effects of temperature on the Seebeck coefficients of polymers containing two-dimensional conjugated side chains are greater than those of polymers containing alkoxy side chains. The maximum Seebeck coefficients of PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were determined to be 285.86 μV K−1 at 135 °C, 333.80 μV K−1 at 134 °C, and 413.79 μV K−1 at 137 °C, respectively. Polymers with two-dimensional conjugated side chains have larger Seebeck coefficients at higher temperatures. This phenomenon could be due to the two-dimensional conjugated side-chain structure enhancing the carrier mobility of the polymers at high temperature, which leads to higher Seebeck coefficients. The power factors of all three polymers tended to initially increase and then decrease (Fig. 9); the maximum power factors for PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3 were determined to be 0.037 μW m−1 K−2 at 106 °C, 0.177 μW m−1 K−2 at 97 °C, and 1.12 μW m−1 K−2 at 70 °C, respectively. These results demonstrated that conjugated side chains can enhance the thermoelectric performance of BDT-based conjugated polymers, which is mainly due to the formation of an ordered structure generated by the introduction of conjugated side chains, which can improve the charge carrier mobility. As a result, PBDTDTBTF-3 with long conjugated side chains exhibited the best thermoelectric properties in contrast to the other two polymers (PBDTDTBTF-1 and PBDTDTBTF-2).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully designed and synthesized three BDT-based D–A conjugated polymers, PBDTDTBTF-1, PBDTDTBTF-2, and PBDTDTBTF-3. The replacement of alkoxy and alkylthiophene moieties with alkylthienothiophene groups as the side chains of PBDTDTBTF-3 resulted in better thermal stability, a narrower optical band gap, and a more ordered structure. Therefore, PBDTDTBTF-3 exhibited the largest power factor values among the three polymers. This result demonstrated that two-dimensional conjugated side chains can effectively improve the thermoelectric properties of BDT-based conjugated polymers. Therefore, our study provides novel insights for the development of high-performance thermoelectric conjugated polymers.
