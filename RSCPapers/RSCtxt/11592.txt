    , Accepted 7th July 2014First published on 9th July 2014AbstractCore/shell-shaped CdSe/PbS nanotetrapod (NT), a novel nanostructure, has been synthesized and incorporated as an electron acceptor in organic–inorganic hybrid bulk-heterojunction (HBH) solar cells with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) acting as an electron donor. The composite NT shows an homogeneous decoration of 4 nm PbS quantum dots on the CdSe NT surface, forming an inorganic heterojunction with a type-II band alignment. Compared to pure CdSe NT, the core/shell-shaped NT demonstrates an improved performance on splitting photogenerated exciton in P3HT. The charge reverse transfer (leakage or recombination) at the heterojunction interface is suppressed due to a potential barrier that is as high as 0.5 eV for CdSe/PbS NT. Furthermore, charge transport and collection are also enhanced through the spatially isolated charge channels of P3HT (for holes) and the CdSe core (for electrons). The efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection greatly contribute to the photovoltaic performance improvement. Compared with the P3HT:CdSe hybrid solar cell, a remarkable efficiency enhancement of 76% is achieved by incorporating the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid with a donor–acceptor mass ratio of 1:6.
1. Introduction
The organic–inorganic hybrid bulk-heterojunction (HBH) solar cell has attracted intense attention, based on its integration of the flexibility and tunability of organic semiconducting molecules and the facial synthesis and quantum size effects of inorganic nanocrystals. To date, various inorganic nanocrystals have been explored as electron acceptors in HBH structured solar cells, such as ZnO quantum dot (QD),1 TiO2 nanorod or nanorod array,2,3 CdS nanorod,4 CdSe nanotetrapod,5,6 PbS QD,7 and so on. Core/shell-shaped nanocrystals with either dispersed nanorods, nanotubes, or oriented arrays have also been researched as electron acceptors or transport media.8–11 The photovoltaic performance of the HBH solar cell has also seen great improvements in recent years. The light conversion efficiency has been enhanced using different strategies, from 1.7% with well-dispersed CdSe nanorods and a P3HT hybrid4 to 4.7% after ligand treatment to a low band gap polymer–CdSe nanorod film.12 Further, by tuning the vertical phase segregation, a power conversion of 5.5% has been obtained in the hybrid containing PbSxSe1−x nanocrystal and with a low band gap polymer.13
High performance organic–inorganic HBH solar cells require the efficient dissociation of excitons, as well as extraction of the charges. This points toward performance optimization by tuning the morphology of the inorganic nanocrystals, such as the core/shell-shaped nanoparticles, for an efficient separation of electron–hole pairs through a cascade band gap or graded energy level alignment.14,15 It is also known that mono-dispersed nanotetrapods are superior in collecting electrons through an extended charge path with three-dimensional continuity in organic–inorganic HBH solar cells.5,6 Therefore, combining the advantages of cascade nanoparticles for the separation of excitons, core/shell-shaped nanotetrapods should be much more attractive as electron acceptors and transport media in HBH solar cells. Until now, no reports on this kind of nano-building block have been made, but herein, we report on our synthesis of core/shell-shaped NTs and our investigations into their role as an electron acceptor in hybrid solar cells.
For the synthesis of core/shell-shaped NTs, a hot-injection method was employed because of its facial process control and good dispersion of the products. CdSe was selected as the core NT as it has a mature synthesis technique. PbS QDs were deposited on the CdSe NTs surface to form composite NTs with a type-II energy level alignment that is convenient in charge transfer and transport. It has been found that CdSe/PbS core/shell-shaped NTs have a superiority in splitting photogenerated excitons in the organic semiconductor, P3HT. The charge dynamics at the double type-II heterojunction interface in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid indicates a suppressed charge reverse transfer recombination and transport (or current leakage). The carrier lifetime and extraction efficiency also benefit from the isolated charge collection channels in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid. A clearly improved phtotovoltaic performance was thus achieved through the introduction of a core/shell-shaped NTs acceptor.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of CdSe and CdSe/PbS NTs
CdSe NTs were synthesized according to the procedure in literature.16 CdO (1 mmol), oleic acid (OA, 6 mmol), and 20 mL 1-octadecene (ODE) were pumped at 140 °C under a N2 flow for 30 min. Afterwards, the temperature was first raised to about 240 °C, where the solution turned clear and then decreased to 190 °C, at which point a TOP-Se-CTAB (CTAB–hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) solution (containing 1 mL TOP, 0.5 mmol Se, 0.05 mmol CTAB and 3 mL toluene) was quickly injected. The injection caused a temperature drop to about 165 °C, where the reaction occurred and persisted for an hour to grow the CdSe NTs. Then, the heating mantle was removed, and the solution was cooled to room temperature, after which, 10 mL acetone was injected to collect the red precipitation by centrifugation at 4500 rpm. The obtained CdSe NTs were cleaned with chlorobenzene/acetone solvent/antisolvent at least six times and then dissolved in chlorobenzene to form a clear red solution with a desired concentration.
For the core/shell-shaped CdSe/PbS NTs, CdSe NTs were first synthesized, purified, and dispersed in 10 mL ODE to form a clear red solution. Then, PbO (0.5 mmol) and OA (2 mmol) were added and the solution were degassed at 120 °C under a N2 flow for 60 min. Afterwards, a solution containing 45 μL bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide (TMS) and 3 mL ODE was injected quickly and 1 min later the heating mantle was removed. After the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, it was injected with 5 mL toluene and 10 mL ethanol to allow a precipitation of reddish brown CdSe/PbS NTs. The products were isolated by centrifugation at 4500 rpm and cleaned with toluene/ethanol solvent/antisolvent at least six times. Finally, the composite NTs were dispersed in chlorobenzene to form a reddish brown solution with the desired concentration.
2.2 Fabrication of organic–inorganic HBH solar cells
Patterned ITO-coated glasses substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol under ultrasonication for 20 min. The substrates were then dried under a N2 flow, after which a compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the top by spin-coating a titanium–acetylacetone precursor and then sintering at 450 °C for 90 min. The ITO/TiO2 substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glovebox, where the fully mixed P3HT:NTs chlorobenzene solutions were spin-coated. The freshly prepared hybrid films then underwent solvent treatment with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)–methanol (10% by volume) before annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. The fabrication of the hybrid solar cells was finished by the evaporation of 3 nm MoO3 followed by 100 nm Ag on top. A shadow mask was used to define six separated devices, each with a diameter of 2 mm.
2.3 Characterization
The morphology of the synthesized CdSe and CdSe/PbS NTs was confirmed by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-2100) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The crystal structure was researched by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/max-gA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Raman scattering was collected on a Renishaw RW1000 confocal microscope with 514 nm line of Ar+ iron laser as the exciting light. Light absorption measurements were carried out on a Varian Cary-5000 model Ultraviolet-visible-inferred spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorlog-3 system, with an exciting wavelength of 360 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy measurements (FLSP920 lifetime spectrometers, Edinburgh Instruments, EI) were conducted using a pulse laser (380 nm) with a pulse width of 70 ps for excitation. The TRPL decays at 730 nm were recorded by a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer. The current–voltage characterizations were carried out using a Keithley 2440 source meter and Newport 94043A solar simulator (AM 1.5 illumination). External quantum efficiency (EQE) and photocurrent measurements were performed in a forward bias DC mode on a solar cell IPCE measurement system (Crowntech Qtest Station 500ADX) with a CM110 monochromator, a Keithley 2000 source meter, and a CT-TH-150 Br-W lamp. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were collected in the dark from a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation, applying a 10 mV AC signal and scanning in a frequency range between 1 MHz and 1 Hz at different forward applied biases.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of the synthesized nanoparticles
First, the morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles was confirmed by TEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. CdSe NTs show a good dispersion in organic solvent with weak polarity (such as cholorobenzene, toluene, ODE, OA), making it possible for the epitaxial deposition of PbS in solution. The length and diameter of the NTs arms are about 15–20 nm and 3–4 nm, respectively [Fig. 1(b)]. The dispersion of CdSe NTs is still good at the early stage of the secondary reaction [Fig. 1(c)], but there is no obvious PbS decoration at this time [Fig. 1(d)]. Alongside the reaction time, the nanoparticles exhibit slight aggregation and an observable decoration of PbS QDs (Fig. 1(e–g)). The aggregation is probably caused by the elimination of the surface ligands (such as CTAB and/or OA) on CdSe NTs due to the adsorption of reactive TMS, which, on the other hand, provides nucleation sites for the epitaxial growth of PbS QDs. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis shows the crystallized PbS QDs with a diameter of about 3.5–4 nm [Fig. 1(h)].
 Fig. 1  Nanoparticles morphology of (a and b) as-synthesized CdSe NTs, (c and d) 5 seconds after the injection of a sulfur precursor, and (e–h) core/shell shaped CdSe/PbS NTs with a reaction time of 1 min. Inset in (b) shows the lattice structure of CdSe arm with a calculated 0.351 nm constant of [002] orientation of wurtzite-phase CdSe. Inset in (g) shows the lattice structure of PbS QD with a calculated 0.301 nm constant of [200] direction of cubic-phase PbS. 
The existence of Pb and S elements are revealed by the energy dispersive spectra (EDS) in Fig. 2(a) and (b). XRD measurements demonstrate the good crystallization of CdSe with a wurtzite phase [Fig. 2(c)]. The strong diffraction from the (002) facet matches well with the preferred [002] orientation of CdSe arms in Fig. 1(b) inset. For a clear comparison, pure PbS QDs with diameters of about 3.5 nm were also synthesized under a similar procedure to that of the CdSe/PbS NTs. It was found that the XRD profile of CdSe NTs and PbS QDs is very similar except for an intense (200) diffraction peak in the PbS sample [Fig. 2(c) blue curve]. The composite CdSe/PbS NTs sample exhibited a combined XRD pattern where all the peaks could be traced in CdSe and PbS. The unique (200) diffraction peak could be used to evaluate the diameter of the decorated PbS QDs after a simple curve fitting treatment [Fig. 2(c) inset], which interestingly demonstrates particle diameters (3.4 nm) similar with that of the pure PbS QDs (averaged 3.5 nm). What is also interesting is that the [200] lattice orientation of PbS QD is observed in the HRTEM analysis [Fig. 1(g) inset], which together with the XRD pattern, indicates a cubic phase of decorated crystalline PbS. Raman spectrum shows LO1 and LO2 modes of CdSe NTs located at 210 cm−1 and 420 cm−1, respectively. However, only the LO1 mode signal of CdSe is detected in the CdSe/PbS composite NTs [Fig. 2(d)]. The Raman signals at 140 and 280 cm−1 are assigned to TO and 2TO phonons of PbS nanocrystals. It is noted that there is neither Cd–S nor Pb–Se bond signals on the Raman spectrum, thus the CdSe NTs crystalline is not affected during the deposition of PbS QDs on surface.

Inset in (c) left is the fitting curves of the diffraction peak near 30°. The blue lines at (c) bottom represent the diffraction peaks location of the cubic-phase PbS (JCPDS no. 5-592). 
3.2 Optical properties of the nanotetrapods and hybrid materials
The light absorbance of CdSe/PbS NTs in chlorobenzene shows the combined absorption of CdSe NTs and PbS QDs, with peak signals at about 540 nm and 1000 nm [Fig. 3(a)], respectively. However, the peak intensity ratio of CdSe to PbS is remarkably large, which suggests that the amount of PbS QDs on CdSe NTs is relatively small. The absorption response of PbS also indicates the particle size (less than 4 nm) with a 1.24 eV optical band gap (Eg) value.17 For organic–inorganic HBH solar cell applications, P3HT is used as the electron donor, while different NTs are incorporated as electron acceptors. The absorption of hybrid thin films was also characterized [Fig. 3(b)]. Typically, pure P3HT film shows two distinct peaks at 530 nm and 620 nm, with a light response edge at about 650 nm. The shoulder peak at 620 nm indicates a regioregular stacking of P3HT molecules forming microcrystallines in a thin film.18 The absorption spectrum is broadened in the short wavelength region after the introduction of inorganic nanoparticles, which is commonly seen as a superposition of the respective absorption of pure P3HT and nanotetrapods.19 An enhanced absorption intensity is observed near 550 nm, because of the incorporation of the peak absorption from CdSe NTs. Compared with the P3HT:CdSe NTs hybrid film, the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid shows a further increased absorption intensity below 550 nm, which is ascribed to the increased light scattering by the PbS quantum dot or its intense absorption at short wavelength. A slight increase in absorbance at wavelengths over 650 nm is also observed, which is ascribed to the characteristic absorption of PbS quantum dots. However, the exciton absorption of PbS QDs is not present at about 1000 nm, possibly because of its too weak response in a thin film. It is noted that the shoulder absorption of P3HT at 620 nm is still observable in the hybrid samples, suggesting that the regioregular crystallization of the P3HT molecules is well retained for high charge mobility in the hybrid.18

Light absorption spectra of NTs in chlorobenzene (a) and hybrid film (b), photoluminencence spectra of organic–inorganic hybrids (c), the solid colored line is for P3HT:CdSe and the dashed line is for P3HT:CdSe/PbS (inset is a comparison between the normalized PL intensity of the different hybrids), and time-resolved PL properties of different samples (d). 
As the energy level of PbS QD lies between the electron donor of P3HT and CdSe NT, the intermediate linkage of a PbS level will influence the separation of the electron and hole at the organic–inorganic interface. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were characterized to evaluate the influence of the core/shell-shaped NT on the exciton splitting; the result is shown in Fig. 3(c). The mass ratio of P3HT to NTs (CdSe or CdSe/PbS) was selected to be 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6. It was found that the CdSe/PbS composite NTs could quench the PL intensity more effectively than the CdSe NTs at each ratio, with 63%, 74%, and 80% quenching for 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6 in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid compared, respectively, to 58%, 71%, and 77% in the P3HT:CdSe hybrid. It was noted that the energy difference between the LUMO level of P3HT (−3.2 eV) and the conduction band of PbS (−3.9 eV for 3.5–4 nm PbS QD17) was as large as 0.7 eV, large enough to overcome the exciton bonding energy and ensure an efficient electron transfer.20 Thus, the relatively enhanced PL suppression demonstrates more efficient exciton dissociation in the hybrid film with the CdSe/PbS acceptor. For more evidence, time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was employed to investigate the dynamics of the charge separation at the interface between P3HT and CdSe or CdSe/PbS NTs. Fig. 3(d) shows the TRPL decay curves of the pristine P3HT and different hybrids. The instrument response function is first eliminated from the decay curves, and then the decays are analyzed by biexponential decay kinetics. The average PL lifetime of the pristine P3HT, P3HT:CdSe NTs, and P3HT:CdSe/PbS NTs hybrid is 719, 625, and 596 ps, respectively. In comparison, the P3HT:CdSe/PbS NTs hybrid shows the shortest PL lifetime, revealing that the charge separation at the interface of P3HT and CdSe/PbS NTs is more efficient than that in the other two samples. This is consistent with the PL quenching characteristics analyzed from the steady state. The efficient exciton dissociation in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid is ascribed to the appropriate double type-II energy alignment at the P3HT:CdSe/PbS interface, which facilitates charge separation via the intermediate PbS energy step.
3.3 Skeleton and photovoltaic performance of hybrid solar cells
The photovoltaic devices containing P3HT:CdSe or P3HT:CdSe/PbS NTs hybrid were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/TiO2/P3HT:NTs/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The optimized thickness of the hybrid layer was similar for P3HT:CdSe and P3HT:CdSe/PbS, about 120 nm. The energy band alignment of the whole solar cell with CdSe/PbS acceptor is also shown. As mentioned above, the double heterojunction at the P3HT:CdSe/PbS interface guarantees an efficient dissociation and separation of charges once excitons are photogenerated and diffused to the interface. Here, it should be noted that in order to promote efficient charge separation at the interface of the P3HT and CdSe or CdSe/PbS NTs, EDT treatment to hybrid thin films was adopted to increase the electrical contact. This strategy has the same benefit as charge transfer with the commonly used pre-treatment method, such as a functionalized grafting of the conjugated polymer onto nanotetrapods,19 quantum rods21,22 and quantum dots.23
 Fig. 4  Performance of hybrid solar cells. (a) Skeleton of hybrid solar cell and its energy level alignment (a), dark (b), and light (c) I–V properties, and external quantum efficiency (d) of different solar cells. 
To evaluate the electrical properties of different hybrids, the dark I–V characteristics of hybrid solar cells are shown in Fig. 4(b). Compared to the P3HT:CdSe device, the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid solar cell generates a smaller reverse saturation current, also a “leakage” current. A decreased leakage current reflects a suppressed reverse transfer of charges,24 which concerning this work, means that electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of CdSe to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of P3HT is confined by the intermediate PbS. Although the potential barrier of electron transfer from CdSe to P3HT (ΔCB = 1.2 eV) is divided into two small parts [from CdSe to PbS (ΔCB1 = 0.5 eV) and from PbS to P3HT (ΔCB2 = 0.7 eV), the ultimate leakage current can still be suppressed by two-step jump tunneling, like that in other reported core/shell-shaped nanoparticles.14,25

Fig. 4(c) shows the I–V characteristics of the two hybrid solar cells under AM 1.5 illumination. The P3HT:CdSe NT solar cell generates a short current density (Jsc) of 3.9 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.6 V, a fill factor (FF) of 49.1% and a conversion efficiency (Eff) of 1.15%. Comparatively, hybrid solar cells incorporating CdSe/PbS NT generate much better photovoltaic performances, with Jsc, Voc, FF and Eff values of 5.9 mA cm−2, 0.68 V, 50.3% and 2.02%, respectively. The performance improvement mainly benefits from the obviously enlarged Jsc, as well as the slightly increased Voc and FF. A comparatively enhanced efficiency of the exciton dissociation in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid will definitely increase the charge density and the photocurrent, which was already revealed in the PL and TRPL analyses. Moreover, as the saturation dark current was demonstrated to be an important factor in determining the value of Voc,26,27 a low dark current in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS solar cell could explain the high Voc value in this cell. Furthermore, if considering the classical theory of Voc determination on the band offset between the HOMO level of electron donor and the LUMO level of acceptor,28 the larger offset value in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid (1.2 eV vs. 0.7 eV in P3HT:CdSe) also suggests a higher Voc in this cell. For FF, as it physically represents an efficiency of energy collection, an enhanced charge collection or reduced recombination loss is thus indicated in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS solar cell compared to the P3HT:CdSe cell,29,30 as the former has a higher FF value. For further comparisons, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured. The EQE of an organic hybrid solar cell is obtained from the calculation: EQE = ηa × ηes × ηcc(1)where ηa is the light absorption efficiency, ηes is the splitting efficiency of the photogenerated exciton in P3HT, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency. EQE enhancement is observed across a wide wavelength region after introducing the PbS shell onto the CdSe NT [Fig. 4(d)]. However, we did not see an increase of EQE in the infrared region where PbS QD has an exciton absorption, probably because this absorption intensity is comparatively too weak. The EQE increase at short wavelengths is partly attributed to the increased light absorption. The exciton dissociation and charge collection properties may also play a role in improving the EQE performance, considering the morphology differences of the electron acceptor in this study.
3.4 Charge transfer and carrier lifetimes in hybrid solar cells
In order to further investigate the charge transfer properties at the hybrid bulk-heterojunction interface, we carried out research on the charge dynamics by electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) characterization. The EIS method is commonly used in analyzing charge recombination at electron donor–acceptor contact interfaces, such as P3HT/inorganic nanocrystals31 and sensitizer/TiO2.32 Here, EIS measurements were performed at different applied forward biases in the dark. Fig. 5(a) shows the Nyquist plots of P3HT:CdSe and P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid solar cells at 0.6 V. There is one obvious impedance semicircle for each cell. This semicircle mainly corresponds to a mid-frequency response that is correlated with the charge transfer recombination process at the heterojunction interface.32–34 The recombination resistance (Rct) indicated from the diameter of the semicircle is enlarged in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid solar cell compared to that in the P3HT:CdSe cell, which means the charge recombination is suppressed by using a core/shell-shaped CdSe/PbS NT as the electron acceptor. The voltage dependence of the Rct value in Fig. 5(b) shows a decreased tendency following the increase in the applied voltage (Vapp); this is because charge recombination at the heterojunction interface is easier at a higher bias voltage.35,36 Also, the P3HT:CdSe/PbS solar cell exhibits a smaller Rct value at each Vapp, which further confirms the validity of CdSe/PbS NT in lowering the geminate recombination after exciton dissociation at the interface.
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of hybrid solar cells (a), and charge transfer recombination resistances obtained from the EIS measurements at different applied voltage (b). 
Considering the core/shell-shaped electron acceptor with a type-II band alignment, we propose two reasons for the enhanced suppression of the charge recombination at the interface. As depicted in Fig. 6, the interface contact is formed between P3HT and PbS in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid. The electron transport is confined in a potential well of CdSe NT, and the PbS shell behaves as an intermediate isolator that separates the transport channels of electrons (in CdSe) and holes (in P3HT), decreasing the rate at which electrons and holes encounter each other. Meanwhile, the back transfer of electrons from CdSe to P3HT has to overcome a higher PbS potential barrier due to the large band offset at the CdSe/PbS interface (ΔCB = 0.5 eV), and thus. charge recombination is potentially inconvenient. This speculation is validated by the smaller effective constant of the charge recombination rate (Keff) in P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid [Fig. 7(a)], which is indicated from the peak frequency (fpeak) of the Nyquist plot at different Vapp.37,38 Correspondingly, the electron lifetime obtained from τ = 1/2πfpeak also slightly increases [Fig. 7(b)]. The prolonged electron lifetime and suppressed charge recombination in the core/shell-shaped CdSe/PbS acceptor suggests an improved charge collection efficiency in this cell.

3.5 Charge extraction properties of hybrid solar cells
For further validation, light intensity dependence of Jsc and Voc was researched to evaluate the efficiency of the charge collection, ηcc, the third component of EQE. Generally, both P3HT:CdSe and P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid solar cells present linear variations of the Jsc value following the increase in light intensity [Fig. 8(a)], indicating that no charges accumulate during their transport in the hybrid film.39 Comparatively, the Jsc value increases more rapidly in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS solar cell than that in the P3HT:CdSe cell, demonstrating an enhanced charge collection in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS solar cell at high light intensity.40Fig. 8b also shows a similar logarithmic increase of Voc with increasing light intensity. Both these devices have the maximum value of Voc at 100 mW cm−2, 0.60 V and 0.67 V for P3HT:CdSe and P3HT:CdSe/PbS, respectively. The results show that charge collection and extraction is more effective in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid than that in the P3HT:CdSe hybrid. Accordingly, I–V characteristics and EQE performance benefit from the enhanced charge collection in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid solar cell.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have prepared core/shell-shaped CdSe/PbS NTs and fabricated organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells incorparating CdSe NTs or CdSe/PbS NTs as electron acceptors. Photoelectric characterization of the different solar cells has demonstrated enhanced excitons splitting and charge collection, and extraction in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS hybrid solar cell. In particular, electron transfer from the P3HT donor to the CdSe NT acceptor is facilitated through a PbS intermediate buffer level in the P3HT:CdSe/PbS composite. A back transfer recombination of charge is also suppressed at the donor–acceptor interface and during their extraction. The photovoltaic performance of the hybrid solar cell clearly improves from 1.15% in P3HT:CdSe to 2.02% in P3HT:CdSe/PbS, an enhancement of up to 76%. Our research thus demonstrates a novel nanobuilding block as a promising electron acceptor and transport media in efficient hybrid solar cells.
