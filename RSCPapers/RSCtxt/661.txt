    , Accepted 18th January 2023First published on 21st January 2023AbstractMetal halide perovskites (MHPs), as a new generation optoelectronic materials, have attracted a surge of attention due to their remarkable intrinsic properties. Despite tremendous advances in polycrystalline thin-films (TFs), the presence of grain boundaries serving as recombination centers severely affects the performance and stability of the devices. MHP single crystals (SCs) containing less grains or no grains are anticipated as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications by virtue of their longer carrier mobility and lifetime, low defect density, long diffusion lengths, and wide optical-absorption range that are expected to deliver superior optoelectronic performance. Whilst MHP SCs can surpass the limits of their TF counterparts, the exploration of MHP SC solar cells lags far behind. In this review, the challenges of the MHP SC solar cell development are considered to set some guidelines in this emerging research direction. In particular, the scientific and technical barriers are systematically discussed in terms of their harmful impacts on the material's functionality as the active layer for solar cell application. The correlation between these potential limiting factors and the device performance is fundamentally discussed. In addition, by analyzing the strategies thus far in mitigating these obstacles, some innovative insights are proposed to further improve the performance and practical applications of MHP SC solar cells.
Introduction
In the last decade, metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have received increasing attention in the field of photovoltaic research1–3 due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties, including high absorption coefficients,4 high defect-tolerance,5 and long carrier diffusion lengths.6 The record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of MHP solar cells are generated from polycrystalline thin-films (TFs).7,8 However, regardless of the impressive progress of the PCE of MHP solar cells, the performance of this group of solar cells has plateaued due to some inherent imperfections, such as the significant structural disorder and high concentration of grain boundaries in the MHP layer.9–11 The grain boundaries host numerous charge trap states that act as nonradiative recombination centres, which hinder the performance of various devices.10,12–14 It has been demonstrated that grain boundaries also are responsible for initializing ion migration and composite degradation.15,16 On the other hand, in the single-crystal (SC) form of the materials, no grain boundary is presented. This leads to a remarkable reduction of the structural defect density, which benefits their optoelectronic properties.17–19 A clear example is the much longer carrier diffusion length of up to 175 μm for the composition of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3, MA = CH3NH3) SCs, in contrast to the nanometre scale for its polycrystalline case.20–22 This remarkable carrier diffusion length for MAPbI3 SCs is associated with the suppressed carrier recombination in this system,22 with several orders of magnitude lower trap densities. In addition, early observations show much higher moisture and thermal stability of MHP SCs compared to the polycrystalline ones, which potentially overcome the main bottlenecks towards widespread commercialization of MHP solar cells.15,23,24 These findings hold the promise that MHP SCs can be the best solution to alleviate the challenges of their polycrystalline counterpart.25 As the first study in 2016, Peng et al. explored the potential of MAPbBr3 SCs in a device with a sandwiched structure of glass/ITO/MAPbBr3/Au that yielded a PCE of 6.53%.26 A few years later, this efficiency was significantly increased to 22.8% by the Bakr group in 2021,27 mainly by optimizing the synthesis condition of the SCs.27
Over the past few years, the performance of the polycrystalline MHP SCs has generally experienced tremendous development mainly by modifying the crystallinity of the compounds. However, this progress cannot continue because even in the best reported systems, the polycrystalline MHPs demonstrate inferior characteristics of trap density, carrier mobility, carrier diffusion length, grain-size inhomogeneity, and long-term stability compared to those of single crystal ones. In fact, MHP SCs with no grain boundaries provide significantly higher carrier lifetime and diffusion length with uniform carrier transportation across the system. This is highly beneficial for efficient carrier collection and better engineering of single junction solar cell devices with more efficient carrier separation and collection. On the other hand, the adverse effects of deep trap states for conventional semiconductors, such as GaAs, polycrystalline Si, single crystalline Si, and CdTe, are certain. It is expected that the superior characteristics of the MHP SCs, combined with their easier synthetic methods than those for inorganic SCs (e.g., Si, GaAs), enable much simpler device architecture compared to their polycrystalline TFs and commercial Si solar cells. This provides an opportunity to address the challenges related to the cost, manufacturability, and long-term stability. Now, the question is if the MHP SC solar cells are superior for commercialization given that the current polycrystalline TF-based solar cells still encounter the critical technical problem of instability, which inhibits their market acceptance. So far, only a limited number of studies have reported on MHP SC-based solar cells. In fact, the full realization of the MHP SCs potential faces some challenges mainly related to their bulk formation, and the difficulties in producing thin- and large-enough monocrystalline films essential for practical device applications. The successfully synthesized MHP SCs mostly are organic–inorganic compositions with a brittle intercalation between the volatile organic part and the inorganic framework. This structural property sets serious limitations in the applicability of the well-established techniques, such as pulsed laser deposition and sputtering for preparing high quality MHP thin-films, while the conventional solution-based methods mainly generate bulk MHP SCs with a small aspect ratio. Therefore, the scarce attention on MHP SC-based solar cells may originate from the complexity of their synthesis, device fabrication, and some constraints related to the synthesised compositions. In contrary, among the advantages of MHP polycrystalline TFs solar cells is their ease of fabrication.28 Although there exist several obstacles for MHP SCs in their broad utilization in the field of photovoltaics, the reported PCE values for this type of solar cells approach those for the polycrystalline group. There are several reviews that comprehensively discuss various growth methods of MHP SCs and their development in different optoelectronic applications.22,28–40 In these works, the aim is mainly to present a general comprehension of the current state of the MHP SCs in different fields by covering a wide range of synthetic techniques, optical properties and their implementation in some typical applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, photodetectors, and X-ray detectors. However, an in-depth elucidation on the scientific challenges against the broad progress of this burgeoning topic is absent. A critical discussion on the existing hindrances and corresponding pathways will provide substantial understanding and guidance toward exploring systematic solutions to further advance the research on MHP SCs and their applications. The goal of the current work is to present the physical and technical challenges against the development of the MHP SCs for photovoltaics. Firstly, an overview of the advantages of the MHP SCs is systematically summarized to demonstrate their potential as promising candidates for high-performance solar cells, especially compared with their polycrystalline thin film counterparts. In the following sections, the focus is mainly on the current obstacles against the broad applications of the MHP SCs in the field of photovoltaics. Therefore, a relatively full picture of the challenges is provided and ascribed to the thickness control, abundance of surface defects, composition-related limitations (e.g., thermal stability, dimension and geometry, bandgap, carrier transport), and complexity of their device fabrication. From a structure–property relationship point of view, the physics of these barriers and their subsequent effects on the optoelectronic characteristics of the MHP SC, as well as the ultimate device performance are discussed in detail. The current strategies to overcome these barriers are also systemically highlighted. In line with the identified challenges, some potential strategies to either eliminate or minimize the diverse effects of the discussed barriers are proposed. This review aims to provide a relatively full picture on the current challenges against widespread application of the MHP SC solar cells based on the current knowledge, and propose some guidelines to promote the future development and utilization of the MHP SCs in the field of photovoltaics.
The advantages of MHP SCs
Since the first report of the synthesis of bulk MAPbI3 SCs, various research groups have investigated the optoelectronic properties of MHP SCs with different compositions. Altogether, these studies concertedly present the superiority of the MHP SCs to the polycrystalline TFs, including below-bandgap absorption, significantly lower trap density, higher charge-carrier mobility, longer carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths.19,21,41–44 For instance, the enhancement of the below-bandgap absorption causes a remarkable redshift in the absorption spectrum compared to their TF counterparts (Fig. 1a–d).45–47 This feature has been demonstrated to be due to the indirect bandgap absorption with 60 meV smaller bandgap than the intrinsic direct bandgap of the material.45,46,48 The below-bandgap absorption is obviously larger in MHP SCs because of their significantly larger thickness compared to that of polycrystalline TFs. Consequently, a huge redshift is observed from 780 nm for MAPbI3 polycrystalline TF to 850 nm for MAPbI3 SCs (Fig. 1b).49,50 A significant redshift of the absorption onset of a MAPbI3 wafer with the thickness of >150 μm to ≈900 nm compared to the 800 nm absorption onset for the polycrystalline TF also has been reported.49 The strong optical absorption from the visible region to the near-infrared region is noted as a necessity for high-performance optoelectronic devices.51 By tuning the halide composition of MHP SCs with the general formula of ABX3, the optical bandgap of the compounds can be tuned in a broad range (3.0 eV, 2.24 eV, and 1.53 eV for Cl, Br, I at X site, respectively).52–54 The redshift in the absorption of the MHP SCs with respect to the polycrystalline TF is also associated to the lower crystal disorder and long-range structural coherence in the case of SCs.41 The distinct onset cut-off in the absorption spectra of the MHP SCs is an indication of the low in-gap defect states in the system. This observation is also supported by the blueshift of the photoluminescence spectra of the MAPbBr3 SCs relative to the absorption onsets as a sign of the lower defect density (Fig. 1c).41,50

For MHP polycrystalline TFs, grain boundaries disturb efficient charge-carrier mobilities and lifetimes by trapping the carriers during their transport, and acting as deep trap states.55 Therefore, there is a higher contribution of the trap density at the surface and the grain-boundaries of the polycrystalline TFs compared with their deep bulk.56 In MHP SCs with no grain boundaries, the defects are mainly located at the surface and partly in the bulk. Ultimately, much smaller trap densities for bulk SCs are observed on the order of 109 to 1010 cm−3, which are several orders of magnitude lower than those found for polycrystalline TFs (1016 to 1018 cm−3).41,57 Since the electrical response of the materials is associated with their charge traps density, lower trap states in the SCs results in better emission, lower carrier trapping, higher carrier mobilities, longer carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths.50 Owing to the lower defect density, MHP SCs can be a suitable candidate for low solar intensity operation, such as indoor working solar cells.58 The better electrical properties cause efficient carrier transport and collection of MHP SCs for optoelectronic applications.59
It has been theoretically demonstrated that the efficiency of MAPbI3-based solar cells can be promoted from 22.5% to 25.3% by increasing the grain size from 1 μm for the MAPbI3 polycrystalline TF to 1 mm for the MAPbI3 SC (Fig. 1e).22 A thin MAPbI3 SC with the thickness of 200 nm shows the charge-carrier mobility of 45.64 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than that of the MAPbI3 polycrystalline TF (0.2512 cm2 V−1 s−1).60 For MAPbI3 SCs with higher thickness, similar values of the charge-carrier mobilities have been reported.47 Lowering the trap densities is also highly beneficial to mitigate the unwanted charge recombination and improving the system photoelectric responses, which is translated into enhancing the charge carrier's lifetime.61 For example, a charge carrier lifetime of 3.1 μs was reported for the MAPbI3 SCs, while the value for its polycrystalline TF was as low as 0.6 μs.61
Despite the great development in the performance of MHP TF-based devices at an unprecedented rate, the humidity, thermal, and photo-instability issues of this family of materials have substantially restricted their broad commercialization.62 Storage of the unsealed MHP TF-based devices in ambient condition can cause extreme degradation of the system by forming a hydrate product of ((MA)4PbI6·2H2O) upon the interaction of the water molecules with the perovskite ingredients, which severely deteriorates the device performance.63 It has been also reported that grain boundaries and defects act as triggers for the degradation of halide perovskites by providing open areas for a fast diffusion of water molecules (Fig. 1f).15,64
Accordingly, the lack of these disadvantages in MHP SCs should afford their superior stability against external stimuli. Wang et al. reported on the remarkable stability of the MAPbI3 SCs after storage for 2 years in ambient condition (Fig. 1g).15 Other studies reported on the substantial stability of the MHP SC solar cells stored in different humidity ranges and successful preservation of over 90% of the initial PCE.65,66 The operating temperature can also be a challenge towards delivering the satisfactory long-term performance of the MHP-based devices. Increasing the temperature of the solar cells after continuous illumination motivates the thermally-induced phase transition in the MHP system.67 In addition, corrosive contaminants generated in the grain boundaries adversely accelerate this phenomenon. Accordingly, due to being free of the grain boundaries, MHP SCs can tolerate higher operational temperatures, with a compositional stability of up to 337 °C for MAPbI3 SCs by reducing the channels of the thermo-induced volatilization of the organic iodide parts (Fig. 1h). This temperature tolerance is limited to ≈150 °C for MHP polycrystalline TFs.47 Interestingly, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 SCs can endure temperatures of up to 567 °C before melting.68 Prolonged illumination of the MHP TF-based devices causes the photoinduced degradation in the system stimulated by the photoinduced-ion migration in the MHP structure.69 Both theoretical calculations and experimental evidence suggest the major role of the vacancy or interstitial defects in promoting the ion migration in MHP systems.70 The more ordered crystal structure of the MHP SCs with lower trap states should provide a rough platform for the ion migration and its following impairments. That being the case, it can be seen that the absence of grain boundaries in MHP SCs provides much better optoelectronic properties and significantly more stable structures that are highly suitable for different optoelectronic systems.22,71 Contrary to the polycrystalline TFs, MHP SCs hold superior optoelectrical properties that facilitate improved carrier transport efficiency. In previous works, their characteristics in improving the performance of the optoelectronic applications have been thoroughly discussed. However, an actual picture regarding the barriers towards the broad implementation of the MHP SCs for efficient solar cells is still rare. Therefore, it is of tremendous interest to investigate the potentials of MHP SCs in the field of photovoltaics, which may demonstrate a bright future for MHP SC-based solar cells. Given the importance of this aspect, in the following sections, we provide a fundamental understanding regarding the intrinsic material properties and device physics to develop the most promising perovskite solar cells. The main factors that obstruct the development of the MHP SC solar cells as an emerging field of research are thoroughly discussed, which may inspire more efforts to address these challenges.
The challenges of MHP SCs
It is obvious that MHP SCs hold remarkable optoelectronic characteristics that are superior to their TF counterparts. Regardless, the implementation in the field of photovoltaics is still rare with limited publications on this matter. In the following sections, the potential reasons for the lack of studies on the MHP SCs for photovoltaic applications are discussed. Moreover, the existing conventional approaches to address these challenges are discussed. Some innovative insights for the future advancement of the MHP SCs in the field of photovoltaics are also provided.
Thickness
MHP devices are mainly based on TFs with the thickness of several hundreds of nanometres, which are usually fabricated using solution processing and vacuum deposition methods.74 The deposited TFs using these methods are polycrystalline in nature, which are largely affected by the processing condition. A large number of grain-boundaries are inevitable in the deposited TFs, which cause a great deal of defects in the system. Many nonradiative recombination centres are formed in the grain-boundaries, which cause significant free carrier loss and create feasible paths for the ion migration.75 In general, the presence of the grain boundaries is considered detrimental for the performance of the system. In contrast, the continuous and ordered crystal structure of the SCs promises a system with much lower number of grain boundaries, and thus lower defect density, that drops from 1016 to 1018 cm−3 for the MHP polycrystalline TF to 109 to 1010 cm−3 for the MHP SCs.41,64 The lower values of defect density in a semiconductor is critical to suppress the unfavourable defect trapping in the system.
The synthesis of high-quality bulk MHP SCs can be summarized in three different approaches of solution temperature-lowering (STL) method, antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallisation (AVC) method, and inverse temperature crystallisation (ITC) method, which are mainly based on controlling the solution concentration and solubility. STL is a traditional method for bulk SC synthesis, which contains a supersaturated solution of perovskite precursors in a HX (X = I, Br, Cl) solvent with a precise control of temperature lowering.44 In brief, for the synthesis of MAPbI3 SCs, the precursor solution is prepared by dissolving Pb(CH3COOH)2·3H2O and MAI in a HI aqueous solution, which is slowly cooled from 60 °C to 45 °C at a cooling rate of 0.1–0.5 °C per hour (Fig. 2a).76 MAPbI3 SCs with a 10 mm size prepared by STL method is presented in Fig. 2b.17 This method can be further optimized by placing seed crystals in different positions in the container, which can be either on the top (named the top seeded solution growth (TSSG) method) or at the bottom (named bottom seeded solution growth (BSSG) method) to provide bigger size MHP SCs.50 However, in the STL method, strict control over the temperature cooling is necessary to keep the growth rate as low as 2 mm per day. In the AVC method, the solubility difference of perovskite precursors in different solvents is used to trigger the crystallization. The scheme of the method is shown in Fig. 2c. The antisolvent engineering method is commonly used for the deposition of the polycrystalline MHP TFs with large grain size by inducing fast nucleation and crystallisation stimulated by the antisolvent.77 Inspired by this strategy, in 2015, the synthesis of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 SCs was reported41 by dissolving an equal molar ratio of MAI (MABr) and PbI2 (PbBr2) in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) as the solvent, while the solution container is placed in a bigger container with dichloromethane (DCM) as the antisolvent. Diffusion of the DCM vapour reduces the solubility of the MHPs precursors in the original solution, which provokes the following crystallization and gradual growth of the SCs.78 By controlling the growth rate for 15 days, MAPbBr3 SCs with the large size of 50 mm could be synthesized (Fig. 2d). The Inverse Temperature Crystallisation (ITC) method was first reported in 2015 by the Bakr group. Nowadays, ITC is frequently used as a fast and convenient method to synthesize large and high quality MHP SCs.79 It was observed that the MHPs solubility in certain solvents is retrograded, as the solubility decreases at higher temperatures (Fig. 2e and f). Therefore, by keeping the MHP precursor solution at adequately high temperatures, the crystallization can be promoted. It was found that this phenomenon occurred due to the formation of a complex by molecular binding between the perovskite precursors and the solvent at low temperatures. This complex can be broken by further increasing the temperature.80 The synthesis of MA+ and FA+ or mixed-halide MHPs have been reported using the ITC method,79–81 with a relatively fast growth rate of 3 mm3 h−1 for MAPbI3. In this method, the growth rate increases exponentially, which makes ITC an effectively faster route in comparison to the others.44,80 ITC has been recognized as a popular method for the fabrication of high quality MHP SCs for optoelectronics, such as photodetectors, lasers, transistors, and photovoltaics.34 However, having precise control of the growth condition can be a difficult task because the fast growth of MHP SCs can cause the formation of more defects in the structure. Large dimension MHP SCs synthesised by these methods provide a convenient platform to fundamentally study the nature of the materials, although it can generate some barriers for their implementation in various applications, especially for photovoltaics. As mentioned before, the greater thickness of MHP SCs compared to the polycrystalline TFs enhances the light absorption ability of the material. On the other hand, this can have a detrimental effect on the charge separation and collection efficiency in the system, where the fast separation of the photo-generated charge carriers and their collection by the corresponding carrier transport layer are necessary to generate current in the system. It is also noteworthy that in solar cells, the cost of the materials is a significant factor, while the large thickness of the MHP SCs certainly requires more materials. Therefore, reducing the thickness to an acceptable range is crucial, even though it will limit the below-bandgap absorption. Generally, the thickness of the bulk MHP SCs is in the range of several millimetres, which is far greater than the measured carrier diffusion length for bulk SCs (175 μm).35 Conversely, for the polycrystalline TFs with the thickness of several hundreds of nanometres, the fast transport of the free charge carriers along the depth of the material is straightforward. The recombination of the carriers before their effective separation and collection in photovoltaic devices based on the bulk MHP SCs is reflected in the reduction of the ultimate external quantum efficiency and device performance.72 In a theoretical study by Chen et al., an obvious dependency of the performances of the MHP SC-based solar cells on the thickness of the MAPbI3 SC active-layer is demonstrated (Fig. 3a).48 By assuming a greater carrier diffusion length than the MAPbI3 SC thickness, they observed an increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 23.0 mA cm−2 to 27.1 mA cm−2 when the thickness of the SC active-layer increases from 500 nm to 200 μm. The reason of the Jsc enhancement is ascribed to the broadened light absorption spectrum of the MAPbI3 SC active-layer. In contrast, considering the diode equation, further increasing the MAPbI3 SC dimensions decreases the open-circuit voltage (Voc). This is due to the higher rate of charge carrier recombination and increased reverse bias saturated dark current density (J0). Considering the changes of the Jsc, fill-factor (FF) and Voc, the PCE of the solar cell device first increases, then decreases following a continuous increase in the thickness of the MAPbI3 SC active-layer, with the highest PCE of ≈24% for an optimal thickness of 200 μm.

Therefore, the prerequisite for the fabrication of efficient devices based on MHP SCs is lowering the thickness in a range that is compatible with the carrier diffusion length.53,83 To achieve this, a number of methods have been developed to govern the thickness of the MHP SCs that opens the avenue of thin MHP SCs. These methods include vapour-phase epitaxial growth,65,84 cavitation-triggered asymmetric crystallization,85 top-down methods (including thin wafer cutting from a bulk SC86 and mechanical exfoliation87), free-standing wafer growth on the surface of a growth solution,88 perovskite SC microarray growth on substrate,89 and solution-based lateral crystal growth using the space-confined ITC method.47,48
Vapour-phase epitaxial growth is known as an efficient method in the synthesis of high-quality thin SCs of IV, III–V, and II–VI groups of semiconductors,90 in which the vapour of the precursors is deposited on a monocrystalline substrate at an optimized temperature. Successful growth of CsPbBr3 and CsSnBr3 on monocrystalline alkali halide substrates has been reported with the adjusted thickness between 200 nm to 7 μm (Fig. 3b).65 Although impressively thin SCs from monolayer levels can be afforded, relatively high temperatures, sufficient match between the lattice constants of the substrate and the product, and compatibility between their expansion coefficients hinder the broad application of this method. It has been shown that slicing the large-dimension SCs of traditional semiconductors to thin-wafers is a reliable strategy to adjust the thickness of the SCs.92 Inspired by this, Liu et al.52 reported the preparation of the thin-wafer FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 crystals through diamond-wire dicing (Fig. 3c).92 Using this technique, the wafers of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 with lateral sizes of more than 20 mm and thickness as low as ≈100 μm could be achieved. However, fragmentation of the SCs through mechanical polishing was a challenge to produce thinner wafers.52,87,92 Yan et al. further modified this method by employing a combination of wire cutting, mechanical polishing, and wet etching in a unsaturated mother liquor that was beneficial to further reduce the thickness of the wafer down to 15 μm.87 Although these slicing techniques have provided a feasible path to produce thin MHP SCs, the mechanical polishing and etching steps can induce a considerable amount of surface defects along with the material waste.92
Having a precise control on the nucleation and growth mechanism using solution-based methods is essential for the growth of high-quality MHP SCs with adjustable thickness. As mentioned earlier, in the current methods of synthesising MHP SCs, the crystallization is mainly promoted by the formation of nucleation sites in the precursor solution by controlling the solution concentration and temperature.92 An anisotropic growth of the SCs along the lateral or vertical direction is possible provided that the optimum condition for the precursor ratios, solvent type, solution concentration and appropriate mineral additives are found for the system.92 However, these factors cannot sufficiently adjust the growth condition of MHPs with a 3D structure.35 Recently, it has been shown that confining the geometrical space for the growth of the SCs can be highly effective and straightforward to harvest MHP SCs with the thickness in the range of μm, compared to the mm size for those bulk ones. This strategy, known as space-confined method, can be successfully implemented for different solution-based methods of inverse temperature crystallization,24,93 temperature-lowering crystallization,93 antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization,41 and slow evaporation crystallization.94 Since the ITC method provides a crystallization rate that is an order of magnitude faster than the other solution-process methods, this method has been widely used to synthesize thin MHP SCs by virtue of its simple procedure and fast crystallization rate through space-confined strategy.80 The space-confined strategy is based on confining the crystal growth by introducing two parallel plates along the z-direction, which can control the thickness proportional to the gap between the plates (Fig. 3d).35 In a report by Liu et al. in 2016, MAPbI3 SCs with relatively large lateral size of ≈ 1 cm and thickness of 150 μm was successfully obtained using the space-confined ITC method (Fig. 3e and f).47 They designed a dynamic flow reaction system actuated by a peristaltic pump to maximize the mass transport during the crystallization and to supply a constantly fresh solution for the gradual crystal growth (Fig. 3e). However, the captured thickness of the wafer was still a challenge for its implementation in solar cells and photodetectors with vertical configuration. The MHP SCs can also be directly grown on the substrate, where two substrates of a type are clipped to each other with a gap in between by controlling the clipping force (Fig. 3g).53 The MAPbBr3 perovskite with the thickness of 13 nm to 4.5 μm could be synthesized. However, the lateral sizes of the products were in the range of only hundreds of micrometres, which was problematic for the device fabrication. To address this problem, Kuang and co-workers synthesized MAPbBr3 SCs with the impressive lateral size of 120 cm2 with a thickness range of 100–800 μm (Fig. 3h).72 They further reduced the thickness of the SCs to 16 μm with the dimensions of 6 × 8 mm2 by using an ultrathin polytetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) as the spacer between the two glass plates. In Table 1, a list of different thin MHP SCs synthesized by different methods is presented. Among the difficulties of growing high quality SCs using conventional space-confined method are limited mass-transport, which negatively interferes with the growth dynamic, unbalanced crystal growth, and preferential nucleation at the edges.48 It has been shown that depositing a thin layer of the PTAA on the substrate has a significant impact in reducing the wettability of the substrates, which is helpful for the even transportation of the precursor in the narrow space (Fig. 3i–k). Using this method, mm-sized MHP SCs (MAPbI3, MAPbBr3) with thicknesses of ten to tens of μm have been reported.48

A summary of the adopted synthesis techniques to produce MHP SC in various ranges of thicknesses is presented in Table 1. It shows that regardless of the tremendous advances in the preparation of the thin MHP SCs through the abovementioned methods, the design of a universal technique to synthesize different types of MHP SCs with different compositions is still a challenge that has yet to be addressed. Peng et al. showed the effect of the MHPs thickness on the performance of SC solar cells with the configuration of a simple Schottky cell of ITO/MAPbBr3/Au.26 They observed that by increasing the thickness of the MAPbBr3 SC to 12 μm, Jsc preserves its high value. This is due to the long charge-carrier diffusion length of ≈10 μm and a large depletion width of ≈7 μm. On the other hand, a drop in the FF and Voc was inevitable due to the higher series resistance and bulk recombination in the system. Upon further increasing the thickness of the MAPbBr3 SCs to 60 μm, a sharp decrease in the device performance was reported. The reason originates from the fact that the light-absorption penetration in MAPbBr3 is in the range of hundreds of nanometres, which is significantly lower than the SC thickness. Therefore, the photogenerated charge carriers must efficiently transport through the MAPbBr3 SC to be collected. At thicknesses higher than a certain range, the collection of the photogenerated carriers is less possible due to their bulk recombination.66,95 To enhance the charge carrier transport and collection efficiency, it is essential to provide a reasonable ratio between the carrier diffusion length and active layer thickness. It is noteworthy to mention that the large carrier diffusion length for bulk MHP SCs (254 μm, 190 μm, and 175 μm for MA0.45FA0.55PbI3,19 MAPbBr3,96 and MAPbI3 (ref. 21) SCs) dramatically decreased to small values of < 10 μm for thin MHP SCs due to the much higher sensitivity of the carriers to the surface recombination.48 Therefore, providing an optimized correlation between the carrier diffusion length and film thickness is vital, especially for vertically structured optoelectronic devices. Besides adjusting the thickness of the SCs, another promising strategy is to enhance the charge carrier transport and separation in the system driven by a built-in electric field formed in the bulk, or at the interface of the MHP SCs and charge-extraction layer.66 This is because the exciton separation is governed by the binding energy, which can be manipulated by inducing an extra built-in electric field.97 In general, in the applications of photovoltaics and detector, efficient separation of the photgenerated charge carriers and their quick transport to the respective charge carrier collecting layers is highly desirable.98
The presence of a built-in electric field provides an efficient charge carrier extraction before their recombination in the bulk. Recently, we have shown a controllable carrier transport in MAPbI3 bulk SCs through the CsI layer deposition on top of the SCs. It was found that in the specially designed metal-alloy structure of CsPbI3/(MA1−xCsx)PbI3/MAPbI3, the transition layer of (MA1−xCsx)PbI3 causes an energy gradient in the structure, which can effectively control the acceleration or deceleration of electron transport simply by optimizing the thickness of the CsI layer. A significant surface passivation was also achieved in the gradient bandgap MAPbI3 SCs. In this specific gradient composition SCs, the controllable transport of photoexcited electrons is highly beneficial for charge carrier recombination for LED and lasing applications, while the carrier recombination can also be greatly mitigated, which is desirable for photovoltaics and detector applications.
Overall, to suppress the limitations associated with the large thickness of the MHP SCs, developing practical techniques for the growth control is critical. SCs that are too thick also result in material waste, while significantly restricting their potential for flexible applications. For efficient extraction of the carriers, the thickness of the operation layer should not be larger than the carrier diffusion length. Therefore, it is essential to create a high possibility to quickly separate and collect carriers. Since the exciton separation is dependent on the binding energy, accelerating this separation (for instance, by creating a built-in electric field) can have a notable effect on their rational dissociation and collection. In general, besides the urgent need to grow thin MHP SCs of high quality, finding potential strategies to enhance the carrier transport and reducing bulk and interfacial recombination is highly desired.99
Defects
As mentioned above, in MHP polycrystalline TFs, the density of defects on the surface and grain boundaries are higher than that in bulk.56 In MHP SCs with advance crystallinity and less or no grains, most defect states are located at the surface with significantly decreased density of defects in the bulk of the structure. Due to the lower density of defects in MHP SCs relative to their counterparts of polycrystalline TFs, the carrier diffusion length of MHP SCs is around 100 times longer. Defects are generally defined as the discontinuity in the arranged order of the crystals, which occurs due to the misplacement of the atoms during crystallization. These defects create deep-level trap states that act as non-radiative recombination centres, which is detrimental for optoelectronic properties of the system. The surface quality of the MHP SCs play a pivotal role in their device's performance. Despite the much lower trap density in the bulk of MHP SCs, the surface still suffers from the high concentration of defect states.100–102 Such surface defects create local electronic band structure distortions that cause subsequent defective charge carrier transport in this region of the structure. In the electronic/optoelectronic applications based on MHP TFs, the surface of the operational layer normally forms a heterojunction with other functional selective layers to create a charge-carrier current in the system. Therefore, any distortion in the electronic band structure of the operational layer with impurities on its surface or interface can hinder the charge carrier flow through the heterojunction interfaces and ultimately deteriorate the device performance. It is accepted that precise crystal control and effective surface/interface passivation of the GaAs and Si thin SCs yields significantly high solar cell performances of 29.1% and 26.7%, respectively.103,104 Developing various surface defect engineering techniques, several breakthroughs in the performances of the solar cell devices based on the conventional semiconductors of silicon and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 has been recorded,105–107 which emphasizes the importance of the suppression of the deep trap states in the system. One of the distinguished features of the MHPs is their high tolerance towards the formation of the deep defects in their crystal structure, known as defect-tolerance.108,109 MHPs possess relatively liquid-like and reactive crystal lattices that create a soft environment for the halide perovskite crystal deformation at the surface.110 Regardless of this intrinsically defect-tolerant nature of MHPs, which is associated to the high ionicity and characteristic valence-band maximum with anti-bonding coupling,111 surface defects are fatal for the optoelectronic performance and stability of MHP-based devices.112,113 Employing a surface passivation layer has now become an essential part of the highest recorded PCE of the TF-based MHP solar cells.114,115 The trap density of the MAPbI3 SCs formed by AVC method and top-seeded solution-growth crystallization (TSSC) and ITC method is in the range of ∼1010 cm−3, while such a low level of trap density for Si SCs is achievable by applying post-annealing treatment at thousands of °C.116,117 As discussed above, the conventional MHP crystallization techniques are based on the solution methods. Although MHP SCs have shown remarkable diffusion lengths ranging from 1 μm to several mms,118 various imperfections in their structure (such as the surface dangling bonds, dislocations, and chemical contamination through the synthesis) adversely affect their intrinsic properties, including their expected charge transport efficiency. It has been shown that the surface recombination velocity of MHP SCs is around 6 times higher than that of polycrystalline films (Fig. 4a).28 The surface recombination velocity of SCs has been reported to be 2.8 × 103 cm s−1, which is much higher than 0.45 × 103 cm s−1 for polycrystalline TFs.119 This is translated into a comparable or lower PL lifetime for the surface of the MAPbI3 SC in comparison to its polycrystalline TF.100,120 Dong et al. studied the optoelectronic response of MAPbI3 SCs using light-intensity-dependent impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage measurements, which together, presented much higher surface recombination at light intensities near 1-sun illumination.21 The surface defects promote more atom dislocation on the surface area, which is reflected in the larger bandgap for this region of the structure relative to its bulk.112,121 PL decay measurements also indicated an obvious contrast between the fast decay in the surface and bulk area, confirming the presence of more non-radiative recombination centres on the surface (Fig. 4b). It has been suggested that the total carrier lifetimes in MHP TFs is restricted by the surface carrier dynamics of the system.119 Turedi et al. theoretically investigated the detrimental effects of the bulk and surface defects on the photovoltaic responses of solar cells containing C60/MAPbI3 SC (20 μm)/PTAA with light illuminated on the PTAA side.28 In this study, they considered two criteria: (i) variation of the bulk defects to reach the performance of a defect-free solar cell, (ii) variation of the surface defects near the two interfaces of MAPbI3/C60 and PTAA/MAPbI3. The calculations show that by decreasing the bulk defects from 1012 cm−3 to 108 cm−3, no substantial improvement in the photovoltaic response of the device is observed (Fig. 4c). In contrast, by varying the surface defect densities from 1017 cm−3 to 1013 cm−3, a sharp increase in the calculated PCE is obvious (Fig. 4c). Considering the thinner MAPbI3 with an active layer from 20 μm to 2.5 μm thickness, a similar behaviour is observed (Fig. 4d). These results clearly decouple the surface properties of MHP SCs from their bulk properties, and highlight the critical effect of the surface defects on the device performance even though the bulk defects are highly mitigated. Therefore, exploring potential strategies to suppress the surface defects of MHP SCs is highly critical because the surface defects are the major bottleneck for the enhancement of the PCE of devices containing MHP SCs as the operational layer.5,101,118 The synthesis condition greatly determines the quality of the final product. A majority of the surface defects in these systems are governed by metallic Pb0 and PbI2 defects. Therefore, choosing an iodide-rich, Pb-rich or moderate ratio in the precursor solution is critical.122,123 Similarly, in organic–inorganic MHPs, the organic cation is sensitive to the heating process, and can be easily volatilised under thermal stress, which leaves behind a PbI2-rich surface with metallic Pb0 (Fig. 4e).124,125 Another source of damage can be the partial dissolution of the SCs surface by the residual solution at this area during the synthesis process.21 Thus, to ensure high quality MHP SCs with low defects, a stable environment is essential by controlling the precursor ratio, temperature variation, surrounding vibration, humidity, and light. It is common to transfer the SCs to fresh solvents to reach to a desired dimension, which causes the inevitable formation of defects. Adopting high crystallization temperatures of >120 °C for a relatively long period of time in the conventional methods of MHP SC synthesis provoke MAI to escape from the surface, and the consequent formation of numerous surface defects.118 Reducing the crystallization temperature to room temperature can minimize the fatal effects of temperature sensitivity during the crystallization.126 Liu et al. showed the crystallization of the MAPbBr3 SCs with the dimension of around 5 mm by controlling the heating rate at 2 °C per day for 18 days. This precise control on the growth condition resulted in a relatively long carrier lifetime of 900 ns with a trap density of 6.2 × 109 cm−3. Although the slow heating rate can reduce the nucleation centres, it was observed that the thermal gradient can still interrupt the long-ordered crystallization that accordingly induces defect states.127 To avoid this, Yao et al. reported a method of room-temperature liquid-diffused separation to reduce the concentration of the MHP precursors in the solvent with the assistance of a second liquid-like silicon oil.128 Using
this strategy, MAPbBr3 SCs with a low trap density of 4.4 × 109 cm−3 were produced. The disadvantage of this method was its slow crystallization rate of 4 mm in several days compared to the fast rate of within several hours in the conventional ITC method. Dissolution of the high-quality seeds can provide an environment to accelerate the growth by preserving the solution at low temperature.129 The dissolution of the seed's surface reduces the impurities on the surface area, which ultimately minimizes the mismatch between the nucleation and surface of the seed.130

Until now, the highest PCE reported for the solar cells of MHP SCs is 22.8%.47,48,118 This is still lower than that of the polycrystalline TF counterpart, despite the significantly higher trap states in polycrystalline TFs. The measured trap density for the thin MHP SCs using the ITC method is around 2.5 × 1010 cm−3, which is close to the reported ones for the bulk MHP SCs.66 Chen et al. showed that surface passivation of the thin MAPbI3 SCs prepared by the conventional ITC method is necessary to enhance the device performance.131 The reason originates from the MAI deficiency on the surface of the SC structure using high temperature crystallization growth, as mentioned previously.125 Accordingly, by controlling the growth of the MAPbI3 SCs in an inert environment, they fabricated solar cells with a PCE of 21.09%.131 Later, this efficiency was elevated to 21.93% by lowering the growth temperature.118 They developed a solvent-engineering method by using a combination of propylene carbonate (PC) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) for the solvents, which allows for the nucleation and crystallization of MAPbI3 to occur at temperatures ≤90 °C in the ITC method (Fig. 4f). Accordingly, a significantly longer lifetime was observed in the PL decay for the MAPbI3 thin SCs (Fig. 4g).118 Besides the controlling crystallization condition, post-treatment of the as-grown MHP SCs can be another approach to mitigate the impact of the surface defects.48 Song et al. showed the reduction of the surface trap density in the MAPbI3 thin SC by MAI treatment to prevent the formation of the metallic Pb0 on the surface, which results in the consistently longer PL decay.125 Dong et al. speculated that the formation of the Pb-rich surface of the MAPbI3 SCs is derived from the partial evaporation/dissolution of the less stable/more soluble MA+ organic cation at the time of removing the SCs out of the precursor solution.21 Therefore, retaining and replenishing the MAI component on the surface of the MHP SCs should preserve the surface structure and fill out the vacancy defects. We also demonstrated the beneficial passivation effect of CsI evaporation and deposition on the surface of the MAPbI3 SCs.98 By controlling the thickness of the CsI top layer to 25 nm, the PL quantum yield (PLQY) of the system increases from 2.40% to 18.32% as an indication of the enhanced electron–hole recombination. The much higher PLQY for the CsI-treated systems highlights the significant defect/surface passivation upon CsI deposition, which significantly reduces the nonradiative recombination due to the defect/surface trapping, and consequently increases the PL efficiency. Regarding the surface treatment, Lei et al. also studied the restructuring of the MAPbI3 SCs using a fresh supersaturated precursor solution to wash the top surface from contaminations and decomposition residues.132 With the same goal, Wang et al. demonstrated that depositing an ultrathin Al2O3 layer can effectively passivate the surface defects of MAPbBr3 thin SCs.133 In a further optimization, they showed that the subsequent co-deposition of Al2O3 and Ti overlayers significantly elevates the operating stability and photocatalytic activity of MAPbBr3 thin SCs. Some chemical treatments to capture the under-coordinated Pb-centres on the surface should be also an effective approach to reduce the dangling bonds on the surface and passivate the corresponding trap densities.101,134 For example, Mahapatra et al. examined the effect of the lead sulphate (PbSO4) on the surface passivation of MAPbBr3 SC,135 where the interaction between the surface Pb+2 ions and the SO4−2 greatly elevated the activation energy of surface mobile ions.
From these observations, it was found that the surface of the MHP SCs is the most vulnerable part to the defects formation, while the stability and the performance of the fabricated devices are associated with the existence of few defect states in the system. In the field of MHP TFs, surface passivation engineering has become an essential process in different electronic/optoelectronic fields to produce state-of-the-art efficiencies. Despite the extensive research efforts that have been devoted to passivating the surface in the MHP TF technologies, the developed engineering strategies for their SCs are still in the early stage. There is a great chance that surface passivation of the MHP SCs can be a shortcut from the currently developed methods for their TF counterparts (e.g., such as PMMA passivation, non-stoichiometry, contact passivation, fullerene passivation,136 coordinate bonding, ionic bonding, and coordination of large band-gap material naming 2D perovskite capping).137,138 Fundamental knowledge of the surface defect dynamic and chemistry can provide a clearer picture to develop a new passivation mechanism by realizing the interactions between the various surface defects and passivating agents. Quantitative analysis on the surface elementary distribution and surface recombination velocity also would give a clear image for the better evaluation of the passivation effect. The current reports on the trap density of the MHP SCs mainly reflect the average values for the whole system, while the difference between the bulk and surface might be overlooked. In fact, the inferior trap density in the bulk of the system can pull down the overall number by impacting the actual values of the surface trap states. Therefore, a systematic exploration of the potential passivation approaches is essential to draft new strategies. Equally important, studying the type of defects in the bulk of SCs is crucial. Theoretical calculations suggest that these defects can be interstitial defects, substitutional defects, and vacancy defects.139,140 In addition, protecting the surface of the MHP SCs from the degrading agents of oxygen and moisture is an important task. Despite the significantly better stability of the MHP SCs, the surface part is still vulnerable towards long period storage in ambient condition.140 MAPbBr3 SCs demonstrated different optoelectronic properties of the bandgap edge, PL efficiency and absorption, and ultimately carrier transport lifetime after aging in a humid environment for a few days.140 Furthermore, it is also important to design the optimized device configuration, adjust the relative band alignment of the functional layers, and understand the carrier transport dynamic in the heterojunction interfaces to advance the technology of MHP SCs. Besides controlling the growth condition and the surrounding environment, reducing the lattice strain by doping metal ions can be an effective way to reduce or replace the defect sites in the bulk of the MHP SCs.141,142
Composition-related limitations
As discussed earlier, the performance and stability of MHP-based devices are intimately correlated with the defect states and the surface morphology of the perovskite layer, which formulates the dominant charge carrier dynamics in the system. Although the solar cells based on MHP SCs have been spotlighted as an encouraging platform to break the limits of their polycrystalline analogy, in the realistic context, the high surface trap density is a serious obstacle to advance their performance. During the crystallization process, some inhomogeneity in the MHP SCs composition occurs, which is rooted in the inadequate reaction between the perovskite ingredients, partial dissolution of the SC surface during the crystallization/the cooling step, and uncoordinated bonds on the surface of the SCs.50,118 These imperfections act as deep level defects hindering the efficient carrier transport and subsequent device performance. Despite the abundant studies to passivate the surface defects of MHP polycrystalline TFs,37 forming a uniform passivated surface on top of their SCs is still challenging because of the high surface roughness and different chemical state of the defects. Therefore, exploring other components or finding effective compositional engineering strategies are necessary to enhance the stability and performance of the MHP SC-based devices. To find these, discovering the nature of the MHP SCs by understanding the surface morphology characteristics, and recognizing the uncoordinated ions and the residue of the halide anions should be considered as the main sources of deep level defects.28 These findings will pave the way to investigate the specialized passivation techniques by fundamentally understanding the correlation between the passivation strategy and the intrinsic characteristics of the system. It has been discussed that the concentration of the metallic lead (Pb0) on the surface of the MHP is high.143 In combination with the highly volatile MAI and Iodide (I−) species under high temperatures and prolonged illumination, the deterioration of the device performance is inevitable. As discussed earlier, adoption of high temperatures (≈120 °C) in the most conventional crystallization techniques of the MHPs induces a surface full of PbI2 and MA vacancy defects. Unavoidably elongated illumination under the operation condition further decomposes the PbI2 species into Pb0 and volatile iodide that induces undesirable ion migration into the system.144 In a systematic work, we demonstrated that upon top layer CsI deposition, these vacancies and metallic Pb0 can be re-coordinated with the caesium (Cs+) species, which effectively passivate these dangling bonds through the energetic CsI-driven surface engineering process by highly-ordered nano-island morphology (Fig. 5a).145 Simultaneously, a mixed-cation composition of MAxCs1−xPbI3 is formed near the surface that is beneficial to reconstructing the ununiform crystal surface of the host MAPbI3 SC. This passivation technique by optimizing the composition and morphology of the surface region confirms the significantly enhanced carrier transport by increasing the carrier mobility from 56 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 93 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Another aspect that should be considered is that to deliver high-performance MHP solar cells, the presence of formamidinium (FA+) and I− is desirable due to the better thermal stability of such a composition and its closer bandgap to the ideal Shockley–Queisser limit (SQ) range for single-junction solar cells (1.1–1.4 eV).146,147 The best single-junction solar cells of 29.1% are achieved by employing Gallium Arsenide SCs with a small bandgap of 1.4 eV.7 This highlights the importance of creating a balance between the small bandgap of the light absorber and its high crystal quality to drive the performance of the MHP solar cells towards the theoretical predictions. MHP SCs with higher thickness can extend their absorption spectra. However, there are challenges related to the thickness hindering the performance of the system, which were discussed in detail in the previous sections. Table 1 shows different MHP compositions with their corresponding bandgap. It indicates that most of the highest recorded efficiencies of SC MHP-based solar cells are based on the MAPbI3 thin SCs,28,118 with the bandgap of 1.61 eV larger than the ideal SQL limit.21 In addition, the solar cells based on the MAPbI3 SCs have demonstrated stability after 30 days storage in low humidity. Nevertheless, this compound is intrinsically unstable due to easy volatilization of the organic cation of MA+ during the heating process.48 It is also worth mentioning that the MAPbI3 crystal structure experiences a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic phase at ∼60 °C,148 which is in the range of operational temperatures. Hence, a loss of PCE is inevitable for MAPbI3 SC-based solar cells over continuous operation, which instigates polymorphism-assisted volumetric changes in the system.149
Regarding the absorption efficiency, Fig. 5b depicts the relationship of the bandgap and the SQL performance,27 where SCs GaAs with the bandgap of ≈1.4 eV stands at the peak with the PCE of 32.9%. For FAPbI3 MHP, which holds the smallest achievable bandgap in different MHP compositions, the predicted PCE value can reach up to 31.6%. This bandgap is still around >100 meV larger than the optimal bandgap range of 1.1–1.4 eV for high efficiency single-junction solar cells. Therefore, to realize the full potential of the MHP SCs for applications mainly in photovoltaics, it is vital to expand their absorption capability to near-infrared to approach the theoretical limits. One of the adopted strategies in the field of polycrystalline MHP technology to redshift the absorption capability is alloying Sn2+ into the structure. However, the decreased bandgap is obtained at the cost of sacrificing the crystal quality and system stability.150 This behaviour is originated from the fast oxidation of the Sn2+ to Sn4+, which causes higher density of the intrinsic defect in the film. Regarding the thermal stability, as a prototypical composition for either fundamental investigation or device fabrication, MAPbI3 does not properly meet the standard of an ideal absorbing layer. This is principally due to the easy loss of the MA+ organic cation.151 Inspired by these observations in developing their polycrystalline counterparts, it should be noted that the mixed-cation engineering of FA and/or Cs,152 with a proven better chemical and structural tolerance under maximum power point (MPP) operation, may be a promising solution. Decreasing the volatile MA+ organic cation in the crystal structure of the operational layer can significantly help the enhancement of the surface quality, interfacial contact with other selective layers, and finally the device performance.153 Besides the optimal bandgap, polycrystalline FAPbI3-based solar cells also have attained remarkable attention due to the significantly better humidity stability of the FAPbI3 composition. However, realizing the advantages of this compound in its SC format and the related technologies is challenging. This is because the popular methods for the structure stabilization of the polycrystalline FAPbI3 TFs are not fully applicable for its SC crystallization. The larger FA+ cation size compared to the MA+ makes the growth dynamic of FAPbI3 SCs and MAPbI3 totally different.43,153 Huang et al. first reported the mixed-cation mixed-halide composition of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 SCs as the active layer in an inverted structure device of ITO/NiOx/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 SCs/TiO2/Ag (Fig. 5c).154 They systematically investigated the effect of the interfaces between the charge transport layers and mixed-cation MPH SC on the carrier extraction. Through careful optimization of these interfaces, the surface roughness and the thickness of the SCs, the PCE of the related solar cells was elevated up to 12.8%. The Bakr group also recently uncovered the synthesis of a mixed-cation thin SC of FA0.6MA0.4PbI3, which was used as the absorber layer in a solar cell with the structure of glass/ITO/PTAA/FA0.6MA0.4PbI3 thin SCs/C60/BCP/Cu.27 They confirmed the ability of the mixed-cation alloying in decreasing the band edge of the polycrystalline FAPbI3 solar cells by as much as 50 meV (Fig. 5d). This new onset is just 60 meV away from the optimal SQL value, and this mixed-cation engineering approach generates the high PCE of 22.8%, setting a record for the performance of the MHP SC-based solar cells. The composition of the MHP SCs also has a distinguished impact on the carrier transport performance of the structure. For example, for the MAPbI3 bulk SCs, the carrier diffusion length of 175 μm under 1 sun illumination has been reported.155 This characteristic experiences a huge increase to 254 μm for MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 SCs at 1 sun illumination with a remarkable carrier lifetime of 100 μs (Fig. 5e).19,22 Thus, the low charge recombination and superior carrier transport could be expected by adopting efficient compositional engineering approaches. Mahapatra et al. investigated the role of the guanidinium (GUA) cation in ion transport in GUAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite SCs using temperature-dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.156 It was found that the incorporation of the big GUA+ cation into the MAPbI3 crystal structure lowers the activation energy for iodide ions relative to the pure MAPbI3 SC. The reason was attributed to the large size of the GUA+ cation in the host crystal structure.
Another feature affected by the composition of the structure is long-term stability, which is one of the main bottlenecks hindering the commercialization of MHP perovskites either in the TF or SC form. Meanwhile, all of the highest recorded PCE for MHP solar cells are based on the organic–inorganic hybrid compositions, in which the organic cation holds a low tolerance against normal operation condition and easily decompose under thermal stress.157,158 Developing compositions without the organic cation or restricting the amount of organic cation in the structure using alloying strategies confers an advantage for the stability of the system.159 One established approach to stabilize the MHP composition is to replace the organic cation with a more stable inorganic cation of Cs+ in the form of CsPbI3.160 Although all-inorganic CsPbI3 provides much higher temperature decomposition stability with regard to MAPbI3,160 the challenge with this composition is that its cubic phase (α-CsPbI3) is thermodynamically stable at temperatures above ≈325 °C.161,162 At ambient condition, the structure quickly degrades to the yellow phase material of δ-CsPbI3, which is undesirable for photovoltaics (Fig. 5f).158 This problem is rooted in the size of the Cs+ cation, which is near the lower limit for MHP perovskite formation.163 Studies on the all-inorganic CsPbI3 compounds for photovoltaics is mainly around the synthesis and modification of the TFs and nano crystals,164 while the attention toward their SC growth has been rare. The large volume variation of 6.9% when the structure changes from its yellow-phase (δ-CsPbI3) to cubic phase (α-CsPbI3) would promote the SCs to be easily fractured, which excuses their further investigation.160 From the early works on all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites, the PCE of the reported TF-based solar cells have experienced a fairly rapid rise to around 20%.165–167 There have been successful stabilization techniques, such as dimensional engineering, organic cation surface termination, and doping/alloying of B and/or X sites (ABX3 perovskite formula) into synergetic strategies to simultaneously realize better stability and performance.168 Considering the progress of the all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite compounds, these materials are emerging as a promising research area in the field of photovoltaics.168 In contrast, their SCs counterparts have been rarely investigated in the field.158 Besides the superior thermal stability, comparing the isotropic structure of inorganic Cs to the anisotropic organic cations, the lack of hydrogen bond and cation orientation in all-inorganic MHPs renders their interestingly unique optoelectronic properties with great differences between the two systems. Inspired by the achieved breakthroughs on the synthesis, phase stability and PV performance of all-inorganic perovskite and considering the challenges of organic–inorganic MHP SCs (MAPbI3) to fulfil the requirements of the field, it is highly beneficial to use the current knowledge on CsPbI3 TFs progress to promote their SC potential. Implementing advanced characterization techniques to fundamentally understand the photophysical properties of the compound and developing new stabilization strategies would be highly beneficial.
Overall, the mixed-cation and all-inorganic MHPs have several advantages over the single-cation compositions, which includes a tunable bandgap, superior PCE, large grain size in TFs, suppressed trap state density and much higher stability. However, for the case of SCs, the mixed-cation and all-inorganic MHP compounds can be synthesised in much smaller dimensions than MAPbI3 SCs. To evolve the functionality of the MHP SCs for the devices with the heterojunction-interdigitated back contact structure, it is necessary that the crystal has a wafer-scale large area, which is a problem for the current MHP SCs with either mixed-cation or single-cation compositions.170 Therefore, the synthesis of large MHP SCs with controlled thickness is indeed urgent to investigate their intrinsic properties and device performance.48 So far, different techniques have been proposed to prepare high quality MHP thin SCs, but the compatibility of these methods with the synthesis of small bandgap MHP SCs, which now is mainly dominated by MAPbI3, is a problem that should be considered.171 For example, in the cavitation-triggered asymmetrical crystallization approach, the large difference in the solubility of the perovskite precursors is not compatible with the growth of the iodide-based MHP thin SCs. For the epitaxial growth method, high temperature and an adequately high lattice matched between the host substrate and the product is crucial, which can be a hassle considering the crystal structure of the MAPbI3 with volatile organic cation. Using a combination of these mature preparation technologies based on the solution process of MHP SCs with space-confined method, it was feasible to transfer the crystal format from bulk to semi TFs, as discussed earlier.34 Although this technique can act in synergy with most of the conventional synthesis methods with a reasonable control on the thickness, there are some limitations for the synthesis of large-area MAPbI3 compound with low bandgap compared to MAPbBr3 with larger bandgap (Table 1). This is due to their different natural geometries, which is dodecahedrons and cubic, respectively. In fact, none of the current techniques are satisfactorily able to synthesise MAPbI3 SCs with wafer-size area possessing a thickness comparable to the charge diffusion length. Despite the efforts to reduce the thickness of the crystals, the achieved lateral size is mainly less than 1 mm2, making them not viable for solar cell applications.53,172 Generally, in the crystallization process, the size of the product relies on the nucleation and crystal growth rate, where the large nucleation density and inadequate long-range transportation of precursor ions noxiously decrease the size of the crystals. For MHPs, the large difference in the solubility of the precursors in the solvent causes a rapid precipitation of the ingredients with lower solubility that function as the seed, resulting in random nucleation.173,174
This problem can be controlled by manipulating the nucleation process, for example by the addition of crystal seeds, inducing a temperature gradient in the system, and the treatment of the substrate surface as optimistic approaches.53,175,176 However, in the conventional space-confined method, the lateral growth of the SC is still hindered by the restricted precursor ion diffusion in a narrow channel with micrometre size to supply the required material for crystal growth.83 Further growth of crystals depletes the precursor solution that prevents the subsequent crystal growth.48 Therefore, accelerating the ion diffusion rate in the precursor trapped in the confined space is critical to increase the lateral size of the product. Liu et al. designed an ultrathin geometry-defined dynamic-flow reaction system to grow SC films of MAPbI3 with a lateral size of ≈ 1 cm (Fig. 3e and f).47 The dynamic flow of the solution provides the fresh solution to recharge the precursors, which significantly overcome the problem of the insufficient ion supply, leading to the formation of the relatively large crystal size. However, the complexity of the process (such as controlling the subsequent effects of the dynamic flow on the growth rate or proper sealing of the modules) should be seriously considered, as it largely limits the immense application of this method. Chen et al. demonstrated that compared with the hydrophilic surface (glass), the ion diffusion rate on the hydrophobic surface of ITO treated by PTAA substrates is at least 100-fold faster (Fig. 3i–k).48 This is attributed to the weakened interaction between the solvent and substrate to promote the feasible diffusion of the ions. After all, the achievable sizes for the small bandgap MAPbI3 SCs is still inferior to those for the less favourable MAPbBr3 for photovoltaics (Table 1). Given this observation, developing a halide gradient perovskite structure where the as-grown perovskite system can be converted into a halide gradient composition can be a possible strategy because heterojunction engineering has been indicated as a rational way to stimulate the charge carrier transport in the system.171,177 Recently, different works have demonstrated the significant enhancement of the carrier transport and the performance of the optoelectronic devices with halide gradient perovskite films due to the formation of a built-in electric field.178,179 Li et al. reported the space-confined ITC synthesis of a laminar MAPbBr3/MAPbBr3−xIx graded heterojunction SC, in which centimetre-sized MAPbBr3 SCs are converted into the MAPbBr3/MAPbBr3−xIx graded heterojunction using a gas–solid exchange (Fig. 5g).66,171 Accordingly, the MAPbBr3/MAPbBr3−xIx system displayed a twofold longer carrier lifetime of 27.5 μs than the pure MAPbBr3 SCs at 14.8 μs. A much faster carrier transport time of 60 ns for MAPbBr3/MAPbBr3−xIx was found compared to 106 ns for pure MAPbBr3 (Fig. 5h). These observations highlight that the halide gradient compositions can simultaneously provide an avenue for large-size MHP SCs with straightforward bandgap tunability, efficient carrier separation efficiency and retarded recombination. Thus, considerable improvement in the MHP SC-based device performance can be expected.
The geometry of the MAPbI3 SCs also can be one of the limiting factors to crystalize large-sized SCs. The natural geometry of MAPbI3 SCs is in the shape of nonrectangular dodecahedrons, in which the rhombic facets of (100) and (112) in the tetragonal phase are exposed.92,180 This particular growth orientation causes difficulties for the formation of large-sized MAPbI3 SCs in a confined space that is not as feasible as cuboid-shaped MAPbBr3 SCs with much larger lateral size compared to MAPbI3 SCs (Table 1). Given this specific geometry, the following device fabrication procedure on MAPbI3 SCs would also face some challenges. The reported crystallization methods of MHP SCs are not perfectly able to control the exposed facets of the final product. The characteristics of the SCs surface has notable effects on the material properties and the device performance, as there are some studies proposing the dependency of the MHP-based device performance on the orientations or exposed facets of SC.181,182 For example, the rectangular facets of (110) and (001) in cubic shape indicate a longer carrier lifetime and more efficient carrier transport than the rhombic facets of (100) and (112) in the nonrectangular dodecahedron shape.183,184 In fact, it is a common behaviour in perovskite oxides to show facet-dependent properties.185,186 Therefore, it is essential to find strategic ways to regulate the type and percentage of the exposed facet to produce an ideal MHP with properties suitable for different target applications. There have been some reports showing that the shape of the bulk MAPbI3 SCs could be converted between dodecahedral shape and cubic shape to predominantly expose the rectangular facets of (110) and (001).92 The commonly used approach is varying the molar ratio between the precursor ingredients of MAI:PbI2, where the halogen-rich environment in a molar ratio of 2:1 induces the shape transformation from dodecahedra to cubic.92 The reason originates from the higher coordination between I− and Pb2+, which promotes the dominant growth of the halogen-crowded (110) facet over (100), and finally forming cubic shape MHP SCs (Fig. 5i). Ligands, carboxylic acids and organic amines were also demonstrated as efficient additives to control the crystal shape of the MHP SC.187 In these approaches, the binding between the carbon chain and the perovskite surface with lower coordination energy provides an opportunity to tune the exposed facet.188 However, the effect of the residual ligands on the material properties and the system performance should be taken into account.188 In general, the optoelectronic properties and device applications of the facet-controlled MHP SCs either in bulk or TF format are rarely studied probably due to the poor crystal quality (Fig. 5j).129 Thus, it is highly desirable to explore new approaches to capture high-quality MHP SCs with different compositions to study the impacts of the different crystal orientation adjustment on the physical properties of the material for emerging device applications.
Device fabrication
Traditionally, the semiconductors of Si, Ge, and GaAs have shown better performance as the light absorber in their SC form rather the polycrystalline TF.189,190 However, MHP SCs so far lag behind their polycrystalline counterparts due to a range of limitations, as described in the previous sections. Another factor that has directed attention onto the MHP SC-based solar cells is their complicated device integration, where just a limited number of reports on this category of solar cells are found in the literature. In Table 1, a summary of the reported solar cells based on MHP SCs can be found. In 2017, Dong et al. demonstrated the promising PCE of 17.8% for the solar cell with the configuration of the ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3 SC/PCBM-C60/BCP/copper (PTAA = poly(triarylamine), PCBM = phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, BCP = bathocuproine), Fig. 6a and b.48 They presented the critical role of the surface passivation with MAI to heal the surface of the MAPbI3 SCs. Later, this performance was enhanced to 21% by controlling the growth of MAPbI3 SCs in a nitrogen-filled environment to prevent interface hydration that can cause poor interface contacts (Fig. 6c and e).131 Through low-temperature growth strategy, the next record PCE for the MAPbI3 SC-based solar cell was 21.93% (Fig. 6f and g).118 Recently, a promising PCE of 22.8% was reported, where the composition of the active layer was engineered through alloying FA+ in the system (Fig. 6h and i).27 It was noted that FA0.6MA0.4PbI3 has higher solubility at lower temperature compared to MAPbI3 (Fig. 6j), which can be helpful to initiate the crystallization at lower temperatures. This is beneficial to yield devices with better VOC, especially when involving the volatile cation MA.118 Although the reported PCEs are getting closer to the best ones for polycrystalline MHP TFs, the interest toward this field is still insignificant. The developed crystallization techniques require long processing times to produce single crystals with acceptable size for the device fabrication, as discussed earlier. However, the size enlargement is still a challenge to overcome. The process is more challenging when a balance between the lateral area and the thickness of the MHP SCs should be obtained. For the solar cell devices with the vertical configuration, it is essential to have an efficient contact between the surface of the SCs and the charge collective layers across the whole area, like their polycrystalline TF-based devices. As mentioned earlier, it was demonstrated that a hydrophobic substrate (covered ITO by PTAA) paves the way for easy diffusion of ions in the precursor solution in the confined space. This facilitates the continuous growth of the MHP SC up to 1 mm2 surface area.48 The other side of the coin is that this tendency creates some limitations regarding the selection of various charge transport layers and device configurations. Considering the performance of the PTAA as the appropriate hydrophobic substrate, so far, all the best-recorded PCE solar cells based on MHP SCs adopt p-i-n configuration. Conversely, the best recorded ones for MHP polycrystalline TFs use the n-i-p structure.7,191 Hence, digging for more potential charge carrier transport layers beyond PTAA is urgent to broadly examine the potential of the MHP SCs in the field of photovoltaics.

Pursuing the sandwiched vertical device structure for the MHP SCs also opens some additional issues related to the long-term stability. For example, the large inconsistency between the thermal expansion coefficients and mechanical properties of the MHP SC and the glass substrate stimulates the peeling of the SC from the surface of the layer underneath, considering the temperature changes during the operational conditions.48,131 Another possible reason for the peeling problem is speculated to be due to the phase transition of MAPbI3 SCs from cubic α-phase to tetragonal δ-phase at a temperature of ≈57 °C when the crystals cool down to room temperature.148 The intimate contact between the absorbing layer and the charge transport layers is obligatory to have efficient carrier extraction for high EQE and Jsc.192 To achieve this, it is recommended that in addition to enhancing the quality of the relative MHP SC, the role of the different carrier transport layers with respect to the carrier extraction and active layer surface passivation be investigated.193 Another solution is to develop a stand-free lateral architecture for MHP SCs device fabrication, which is safe from the commonly observed strain–stress induced mechanical device degradation in sandwiched structures. For the case of free-standing SC and wafers sliced from bulk crystals, the charge transport layers are deposited directly on both sides of the SCs with controlled thickness that can be through either confined space or wafer slicing.193 Therefore, the crystal growth process is decoupled from device fabrication. The lateral structure is also independent from the type of substrate, which is ITO-covered PTAA at the moment.194 The absence of the substrate and the conductive electrode would have a better effect on enhancing the light absorption efficiency on the surface of the SCs. In a recent work, Song et al. demonstrated the highly stable MHP SC solar cells in a lateral-structure, where the optimized anode contact is simply achieved by MAI-passivation of the surface of the SCs (Fig. 6k).125 This treatment showed a significant effect on the elevation of the device performance to more than 11% (Fig. 6l) by a better energy level alignment at the anode contact, in addition to the surface treatment effect. The problems with this type of solar cells architecture are the significant dependency of the device performance on the surface quality of the SCs, their frangibility due to lowering the thickness of the bulk SCs compatible with their carrier diffusion length, and the small size area of the SCs that makes device fabrication rather complicated using sophisticated technologies.47,52 In addition, this approach is not easily scalable like the progress observed for the MHP polycrystalline-based solar cells.195,196 However, their prospects for the small optoelectronic devices, such as self-sufficient small sensor, camera systems and light-emitting devices, should be considered.197,198 It is expected that the development of adequately large-area MHP SCs with controlled thickness and passivated defect-free surface will reach their potentials for high performance solar cells with optimum material and fabrication cost.
It has been widely discussed that MHP SCs have numerous remarkable optoelectronic properties that render them promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications, such as photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LED. It is anticipated that their high absorption coefficient, remarkable long carrier diffusion length combined with appropriate composition, and MHP SC solar cells will outperform their polycrystalline thin film analogy. However, as a young technology, there are several challenges that need to be addressed for their further development, which have been mentioned in this review. In brief, one can say that most of the developed MHP SC solar cells are based on MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 compounds, which are mainly known prototype materials with intrinsically unstable structures. Based on the breakthroughs of the polycrystalline TFs, it is expected that cation-mixed halide perovskite or all-inorganic ones demonstrate superior optoelectronic performances and operational stability to those of single cation-single halide compositions in solar cells. To put the potential of these compositions into practice, investigating their crystallization dynamic, phase stabilization, and exploring the right crystallization technique are crucial. Needless to say, enlarging the dimensions of the synthesized MHP SCs should be further developed to satisfy the industrial standards, which can be done through investigating new crystallization methods or finding post-treatment strategies exclusive to MHP SCs. Devoting more efforts to improving the surface properties, dimensions, and composition of the MHPs with their substantial optoelectronic properties can help to fully exploit MHP SCs for various applications that are not limited to solar cells.
Conclusions
While the applications of different MHP thin films with various compositions have been widely studied in the field of photovoltaics, the utilization of the MHP SCs has remained in its infancy. Here, we provided a perspective on the various obstacles in the way of the broad implementation of the MHP SCs for solar cell application, including the large product's thickness, abundance of surface defects, composition-related limitations (e.g., thermal stability, dimension and geometry, bandgap, carrier transport performance, etc.), and complexity of the device fabrication. Most of the challenges are related to the regulations of the synthesis and the limitations of affordable compositions of the corresponding MHP SCs. Although the large dimension MHP SC provides an appropriate platform to gain fundamental insight into the materials, their performance in the field of photovoltaics can be highly restricted. Specifically, their large thickness in the range of several millimetres can severely affect the charge collection efficiency in the system. In bulk crystals with mm-scale thickness, the carrier diffusion length is much shorter than the thickness, which increases the carrier recombination before extraction. Regardless of the tremendous advances in the preparation of the thin MHP SCs through the abovementioned methods, the design of a universal technique to synthesize different types of MHP SCs is still a challenge. In addition to adjusting the thickness of the SCs, another promising strategy is to control the charge carrier transport and separation in the system driven by a built-in electric field because the exciton separation is governed by the binding energy that can be manipulated by inducing an extra build-in electric field.97
Regarding the surface defects of the MHP SCs, despite the much lower trap density in the bulk of MHP SCs, the surface still suffers from relatively high density of defect states, while the surface quality of the MHP SCs plays a pivotal role in their device performance. Due to the abundant surface trap states, the PL efficiency of the MHP SC surface is mostly inferior to that of the polycrystalline film surface, which subsequently diminishes the performance of the device. Through the development of various surface defect engineering techniques, a spectacular growth of conversion efficiency of solar cells based on the conventional semiconductors of silicon and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 has been achieved, which highlights the importance of the suppression of deep trap states in the system.105–107 Therefore, exploring potential strategies to suppress the surface defects of MHP SCs is highly required. Having a stable environment during the synthesis can also have a significant effect on the quality of the MHP SC products. This can be achieved by controlling the precursor ratio, temperature variation, surrounding vibration, humidity, light, and other parameters.118,126
Reducing the crystallization temperature down to room temperature can highly minimize the fatal effects of temperature sensitivity during the crystallization. Post-treatment of the as-grown MHP SCs can be another effective approach to mitigate the impact of the surface defects. For instance, adopting appropriate top-layers, or some chemical treatments can preserve the surface structure and fill out the vacancy defects. This is because the organic component (MAI) on the surface of the MHP SCs can be efficiently retained and replenished.125 This is also a great opportunity because surface passivation of the MHP SCs can be a shortcut for their TF counterparts (such as PMMA passivation, non-stoichiometry, contact passivation, fullerene passivation, coordinate bonding, ionic bonding, and coordination of large band-gap material named as 2D perovskite capping).137,138 It is worth mentioning that fundamental knowledge of the surface defect dynamics and chemistry can provide a clearer picture to develop a new passivation mechanism by controlling the interactions between the surface defects and passivating agents.
On the other hand, the developed compositions still lack some characteristics of an ideal absorber layer. These limiting factors generally include ineffective thermal stability, relatively large bandgap in comparison to the ideal Shockley–Queisser limit (SQ) range for single-junction solar cells (1.1–1.4 eV), high velocity of the surface recombination, the intrinsic tetragonal shape of the MAPbI3 SCs (that may be contrary to the preferential growth direction along the substrate), insufficient interfacial contact between the MHP SCs and the charge transport layers, as well as small lateral dimensions of the SCs, where the large-area active layer is demanding for practical applications. Exploring other components with less volatile organic compounds or all-inorganic frameworks or finding effective compositional engineering strategies are critical to address these limitations. To this end, discovering the nature of the MHP SCs by understanding the surface morphology characteristics, and recognizing the uncoordinated ions and the residue of the halide anions should be considered as the main sources of deep level defects.
These findings will pave the way to investigate the specialized passivation techniques by fundamentally understanding the correlation between the passivation strategy and the intrinsic characteristics of the system. These challenges, combined with the difficulty in device integration due to the small size and special geometry of the synthesised MHP SCs, lead to their limited interest for photovoltaics. Therefore, it is of importance to design the optimized device configuration, adjusting the relative band alignment of the functional layers and understanding the carrier transport dynamics in the heterojunction interfaces to advance the technology of MHP SCs.
Generally, the optoelectronic properties of MHP SCs are highly dependent on the synthesis conditions. Therefore, it is highly crucial to adopt effective growth approaches to produce sufficiently thin SCs, while preserving their high quality. To this end, developing new synthesis techniques, post-treatment strategies and creative designs of the devices exclusively for MHP SCs are urgent to realize their full potential in the field of photovoltaics. Overall, exploring simpler and more reproducible methods to synthesize high quality MHP SCs with various compositions and sufficiently thin thickness is critical. These efforts, combined with achieving acceptable stability against the operation condition and tailoring effective device architectures, will establish MHP SCs as excellent candidates for photovoltaic applications in the future.
