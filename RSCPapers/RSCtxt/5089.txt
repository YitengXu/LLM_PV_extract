    , Accepted 10th September 2018First published on 21st September 2018AbstractThe trap states at the interface between perovskite and charge-transport layer have a great influence on the performance of perovskite solar cells. Here, a high efficiency MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cell has been demonstrated, by introducing a thin layer of LiF or PbF2 between the SnO2/perovskite. Improved charge collection and reduced interfacial charge recombination are realized, leading to remarkable rises of both open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc). This successful interfacial passivation paved a new way to fabricate high performance perovskite solar cells with large Voc.
Perovskite solar cells (PVSC) have attracted enormous attention in the past few years owing to more and more exciting progress in power conversion efficiencies (PCE).1,2 The PCE has jumped rapidly from 3.8% (2009) to 23.2% (2018), benefiting from the perovskite's extraordinary optoelectronic properties, such as large absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, and high tolerance for trap states.3–5 Among these studies, plenty of effort has been devoted to enhancing the quality of the perovskite film by cation exchange, additives, solvent engineering and so on.6–9 Besides achieving high quality perovskite films, novel electron-transport layers (ETL) and hole-transport layers (HTL) were also treated as an important issue for PCE enhancement.10–13 For example, charge-transport materials with well-aligned band structure and high mobility such as SnO2 and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) were employed in the perovskite solar cell to improve its PCE.14–16
Although the perovskite layer itself has been dramatically improved, owing to lack of study, knowledge about the interfaces between perovskite and HTL/ETL is still insufficient. According to reported results, once long carrier diffusion distance was achieved in perovskite, the loss at the interface became a main factor for further PCE improvement.13,14 The interface PCE loss was usually caused by the deep trap states present at the interface between perovskite and charge-transport layers.13 From theoretical simulation, 109–1010 cm−2 interface trap states could greatly reduce the solar cells’ fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and PCE.17 These interface trap states could have several causes, such as the layer-by-layer fabricating process and lattice mismatching between the perovskite and charge-transport layers.7,18
Recently a few attempts have been made to eliminate these interface trap states. By introducing a chlorine-capped layer on the TiO2 and an organic buffer layer on PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)), the performances of solar cells have been successfully improved.18,19 The surface passivation was regarded as an efficient method in both papers. It is also worth mentioning that the interface defects present at the light-incident side were more harmful to the PVSC's PCE.17 Although these attempts only scraped the tip of the iceberg, the importance of the perovskite/charge transfer layer interface has already been demonstrated. To fully understand the interface, obviously more systematical studies are still highly demanded.
In this work, we have found that LiF can function as a highly efficient interfacial passivation layer for the SnO2/perovskite interface, which is widely used.20,21 With this LiF layer, the best Voc increases from 1.06 to 1.16 V, which is very close to the recently reported highest Voc (1.18 V).22 And the Jsc increases from 20.4 to 21.6 mA cm−2. The best solar cell's PCE is 18.3%, which is 22% higher than the reference device. Further investigations of light dependent Voc and impedance spectrum were conducted. They gave solid evidence that the LiF suppressed the surface trap states and reduced the interfacial charge recombination. Our research highlights a possibility of opening a new way for suppressing the SnO2/perovskite interface trap states, which is of great interest for efficient perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
Perovskite solar cell fabrication

Fig. 1A shows a schematic of our perovskite solar cell. A 30 nm thick SnO2 film was spin-coated onto the ITO (indium tin oxide) substrate using a 1% SnO2 colloidal dispersion (Alfa Aesar) and annealed at 180 °C for 1 h in air. A LiF or PbF2 film with varying thickness was deposited on the SnO2 film via thermal evaporation under high vacuum (5 × 10−5 Pa). Based on the thickness of LiF or PbF2, the devices were denoted device A (0 nm LiF), B1 (0.4 nm LiF), B2 (0.7 nm LiF), B3 (1 nm LiF), B4 (1.5 nm LiF) and C (0.7 nm PbF2), respectively. Then, 50 μL perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by dripping 400 μL methylbenzene in 1 s onto the rotating film. After that, the film was annealed at 100 °C for 7 min in a N2 glove box. A doped spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene; 80 mg mL−1) layer was spin-coated onto the perovskite film. Finally, in a vacuum chamber, a 50 nm gold anode was deposited, with an active area of 0.06 cm2.

Characterization of LiF modified perovskite solar cell
By applying a LiF layer between the SnO2 and the perovskite film, all aspects of the perovskite solar cell performance was enhanced. The LiF layer led to a significant increase of the devices’ Voc and PCE. As shown in Table 1, reference device A shows a best PCE of 15.6%. By precisely controlling the thickness of the LiF modified layer, the 0.7 nm LiF perovskite solar cell (B2) shows a best PCE of 18.3% with a Voc of 1.15 V, a Jsc of 21.6 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.7% under reverse voltage scan. Compared with the device without the LiF layer, the LiF cell's average Voc is significantly increased (from 1.08 to 1.14 V), as shown in Table 1. It is worth noting that the best achieved Voc is 1.16 (for B3), which is among the highest Voc values of recently reported SnO2-based PVSCs (listed in the ESI Table S2x†). For the Jsc, a thin LiF layer (<1 nm; B1 and B2) also leads to a higher Jsc compared with the reference device, while a thicker LiF layer (1.5 nm; B4) could reduce the Jsc because of the additional resistance brought by the LiF layer. And for the best device (B4), the series resistance is changed from 45.3 Ω to 59.3 Ω when the LiF layer is increased from 0 nm to 1.5 nm (0 nm LiF (device A): 45.3 Ω, 0.4 nm LiF: 55.9 Ω, 0.7 nm LiF: 57.5 Ω, 1.0 nm LiF: 56.9 Ω, 1.5 nm LiF: 59.3 Ω).

Characterization of LiF modified perovskite films
To explore the reason why the PVSC with LiF layer exhibits an outstanding performance, the effect of LiF on the perovskite bulk properties should be investigated. We investigated the perovskite film's bulk properties by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM images of the perovskite films on the SnO2 layers with different LiF thicknesses are shown in Fig. 2. The different perovskite films show very similar surface morphology. These films are very smooth and formed by a large number of nanometer-sized perovskite crystals without any observable pinholes. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S1.† Different perovskite films have the same peaks at 14.1° and 28.6°, which are attributed to the (110) and (220) planes of perovskite. On the other hand, there is a small peak at 12.7° in all the films, which indicates the existence of a small amount of PbI2 on the grain boundary. Moreover, this PbI2 can passivate the trap states on the grain boundary, which is helpful to the PVSC performance.23 From all the above results, it is evident that the perovskite films with or without LiF are very similar in their morphology and crystal structures.24 These results also suggest that the difference in the devices’ performance cannot be attributed to the perovskite film's quality.
 Fig. 2  SEM of the perovskite film on different modified layers. The films were deposited on ITO/SnO2(LiF or PbF2) substrates, which can be described as follows: (device A) 0 nm, (device B1) 0.4 nm LiF, (device B2) 0.7 nm LiF, (device B3) 1 nm LiF, (device B4) 1.5 nm LiF, (device C) 0.7 nm PbF2. The scale bars indicate 1 μm. 
In order to shed light on the effect of the LiF layer on the absorption performance of the device, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PVSC were investigated (Fig. 3A). From Fig. 3A, the absorption spectra of those PVSC almost share the same tendency and have little difference in the region between 300 nm and 1000 nm. And similar absorption edges are observed for all the samples, which indicates a unified perovskite band gap is formed.23 So it can be deduced that the LiF layer makes no difference in the devices’ light absorption.

Since the light absorption of each device was nearly the same, the difference in the devices’ PCE could only come from different photoelectric conversion efficiency. So external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra tests were conducted on the PVSC to give us more details about the role of the LiF layer in photoelectric conversion efficiency.25 The EQE results obtained for the devices with and without LiF are depicted in Fig. 3B. Devices B1 (0.4 nm LiF) and B2 (0.7 nm LiF) showed higher conversion efficiency than the other devices. Those devices with LiF had a better EQE than the reference one. In general, higher EQE means more efficient carrier migration and collection.
Identifying the interfacial passivation of LiF modified layer
As the SEM and XRD measurements confirm that the bulk properties of the perovskite films are not the source of the performance enhancement, we then paid attention to the interface. As we know, the existence of trap states at the SnO2/perovskite interface will cause a charge recombination leading to a reduced carrier density and Voc.14 Furthermore, for a solar cell, the Voc usually follows the function of Jsc,26 as: (1)
In the equation, Voc,rad is the radiative limit of Voc, and EQEEL describes the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence. According to this equation, the Voc is affected by the carrier's non-radiation combination. And the surface trap states which can greatly promote the carrier's non-radiation combination will reduce the Voc significantly. Here, we investigated the PVSC's Voc curves as a function of illumination intensity to further explore the interfacial trap states suppressed by the LiF layer.27 In this experiment two exciting light wavelengths, 427 nm and 575 nm, were applied. Because of the different absorption length (the blue light's absorption length (about 80 nm) is shorter than the yellow's (about 300 nm)), this method can be applied to identify the carrier recombination near the ETL/perovskite interface.
As shown in Fig. 4, the devices’ Voc values are positively correlated with the light intensity. Moreover, there is a big difference between LiF modified PVSC and the reference cells, especially at weak light intensity. All the devices with a LiF layer show a linear dependence on the light intensity, while the reference device A does not. In addition, device A's Voc curves under weak light are much smaller than the fitted curves deduced for the strong light condition. Secondly, at each light intensity, device A always has a smaller Voc than the LiF modified PVSC. The 1 nm LiF device (B3) has the highest Voc, which coincides with the device J–V test. Thus, we suggest a high non-radiation combination exists in the reference device A.26

On the other hand, the Voc curves showing the difference between the blue and yellow light for each device also give us a hint of where the non-radiation combinations happen. For device A, the yellow light's Voc values were higher than the blue light ones. From eqn (1), a smaller Voc indicates a more severe non-radiation combination. Combined with the fact that the blue light's absorption length was shorter than the yellow one, the location of these carrier non-radiation combination trap states can be confirmed to be at the SnO2/perovskite interface. Furthermore, for the devices B1, B2 and B4 the differences in Voc curves between the blue and yellow light were reduced and even eliminated. This suggested that the LiF layer successfully eliminated the surface trap states.
The devices’ impedance spectra measurement can further identify the effect of modified layers on the surface trap states and charge collection.28Fig. 5A is a schematic diagram of the Nyquist plot of the PVSC with/without LiF layers and the equivalent circuit, which will be useful in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis.29 All the devices’ Nyquist plots show a typical shape of the reported perovskite Nyquist curve plot, which is a half circle at high frequency and an arc at low frequency. The equivalent circuit used to describe these two features comprises the charge-transport resistance Rs, recombination resistance (Rrec), the selective contact capacitance (Ccon) due to the charge buildup at the interfaces of perovskite/contact layers, the dielectric relaxation resistance (Rdr) and the dielectric relaxation capacitance (Cdr) of the perovskite film. Among these parameters deduced from the equivalent circuit, the charge-transport resistance Rs and the contact capacitance Ccon are the two most important parameters to characterize the role of LiF layer. The Rs is constituted of the resistances of fluorine-doped tin oxide (ITO), SnO2, LiF, perovskite, HTL, Au and conductive wire of the external circuit. So, the difference in Rs is mainly contributed by the LiF layer. The contact capacitance Ccon is an indicator of the trap state density. A higher trap state density leads to a higher contact capacitance.

The fitted resistances and capacitances are shown in Fig. 5C (table). The reference device A's Ccon is the biggest, at 11.1 nF. With increasing LiF thickness from 0.4 to 1.5 nm, the devices’ Ccon reduces from 10.5 nF to 6.4 nF, which is almost half the value of the highest Ccon. As we mentioned before, a higher contact capacitance Ccon means a higher trap state density. It also means that the thicker LiF can contribute to a lower trap state density. On the other hand, the serial resistance shows a positive correlation with the LiF thickness. The reference device's serial resistance was the smallest (36.8 Ω) and the device with 1.5 nm LiF was much larger (92.7 Ω). This means that the LiF could also reduce the devices’ conductivity, which would also inhibit the collection of the electrons. This could explain why thick LiF reduces the device PCE.
By the results discussed above, the LiF layer has been proved to be very important in interface trap passivation. In order to verify whether Li+ or F− plays the key role, devices with PbF2 (F− only) or LiTFSI (Li+ only) modified layer were fabricated. We found that a thin PbF2 modified layer on SnO2 also enhanced the device's Voc from 1.06 to 1.14 V, while LiTFSI did not affect the devices’ Voc. Therefore, the F− ion may be the main factor in the device performance improvement. Recently, Zuo et al. have demonstrated that the F− ion may change the interfacial chemical interaction and suppress the surface trap states efficiently;19 the device improvement in the present work could also be attributed to a similar mechanism.
Conclusions
A simple method of inserting a LiF layer increased the PCE of the perovskite solar cell to 18.3%, with a 0.08 V improvement for average Voc. Without a doubt, the light dependent Voc and impedance results proved that the LiF layer could effectively passivate interface trap states between SnO2 and perovskite. The F− ion on the surface is suggested to play an important role of adjusting the interfacial chemical interaction, suppressing the surface trap states efficiently. Our research highlights a new way to passivate the SnO2/perovskite interface trap states, which is of great interest to the device researchers.
