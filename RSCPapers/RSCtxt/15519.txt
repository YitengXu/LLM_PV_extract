    , Accepted 3rd October 2016First published on 4th October 2016AbstractIt is well-known that the inner electric field formed between the counter electrode and the semiconductor surface has a substantial effect on the efficiencies of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). To reveal the function of the inner electric field for different types of porphyrin sensitizers in DSSCs, the properties of three types of porphyrin sensitizers (α, β, and center axial positions) under different electric fields were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The electronic structures and optical properties of these studied dyes in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution were also investigated correspondingly. Key parameters of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) including light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection driving force (ΔGinject) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) were detailedly discussed. The results show that the a-position type porphyrin sensitizer can be used as a potential sensitizer for DSSCs under an enhanced electric field. We expect that the present study would deepen the understanding of the function of an inner electric field and may be helpful in DSSC design in the future.
1. Introduction
As alternatives to conventional silicon-based inorganic solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have low production costs, simple fabrication, low toxicity of the constituent elements and relatively high light-to-electric energy conversion efficiencies (η) especially under low-light intensities and scattered light conditions.1–3 As important components in DSSCs, sensitizers play a crucial role in promoting a higher solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Several sensitizers, such as ruthenium complexes,4–6 zinc porphyrin7,8 and metal-free organic dyes9,10 have shown high DSSC efficiency. Among these sensitizers, porphyrin sensitizers have been considered to be promising candidates for DSSCs due to their stable structure, intense Soret and Q bands and tunable spectral properties. Recently, the cobalt redox-based DSSCs may reach a conversion efficiency exceeding 12% (12.3% with YD2-o-C8 dye7 and 13% with SM315 dye8). These milestones stimulate the investigation of porphyrin sensitizers for developing high-efficiency DSSCs.
In order to be applied to DSSC devices, porphyrin sensitizers must have anchoring groups or bridged-binding groups in their molecular structures, which allow the attachment of the dye to the TiO2 surface.11 Therefore, different dyes can be designed by adopting different connecting positions of the anchoring groups. A free based porphyrin macrocycle have four meso and eight β-positions which are potentially available for ligand substitution. Moreover, taking metal–porphyrin into account, its metal axial center can also provide two connection sites (one of them headed towards the effect connection with TiO2). All these above-mentioned positions are potentially available for functionalization with at least one anchoring group or other substituents (see Scheme 1). Hence, according to the connection position of the acceptor group, porphyrin sensitizers can be divided into three types (meso,7,8 β,4,12,13 and center axial positions14–16) according to the connection position of the acceptor group. Nevertheless, their efficiencies are greatly different. Among these different porphyrin sensitizers, the meso-porphyrins have been the most efficient ones reported for DSSCs. In 2014, Nazzeruddin and co-workers reported the meso-porphyrin dye SM315 achieving a power conversion efficiency of 13%.8 Besides, for β-substituted porphyrin sensitizers, to date the tda-2b-bd-Zn dye reported by Ishida et al. in 2011 achieved the best performance with a power conversion efficiency of 7.5%.12 Lastly, non-covalent self-assembled systems of metal–porphyrin through an axial coordination linked center axial position still belongs to porphyrin sensitizers in DSSCs. This type of sensitizer is less efficient than that mentioned above.

However, the understanding of the DSSC complex system is still far from percipient. And, the performance of dye sensitizers is affected by many factors. Their detailed principle of operation in DSSCs is still very necessary to identify the factors that actually limit their performance. Actually, when the DSSCs work, the electron-injection of photo-excited dye and regeneration of redox mediator processes occur, thus leading to a large number of electron accumulations in the TiO2 semiconductor and the counter electrode. Consequently, it is inevitable that the inner electric field is created between the TiO2 semiconductor and the counter electrode under sunlight conditions, which will affect the efficiency of dyes during the operation of DSSCs, further determining the overall performance of DSSCs to some extent. Previous experimental and theoretical studies reported that the reversible or local electric field affects the absorption spectra of the sensitizer in DSSCs.17–19 Boschloo et al. observed the change in the absorption spectra of attached ID28, D149 and P1 sensitizer molecules.20,21 They interpreted that these appearances could be caused by a band edge shift of the TiO2 semiconductor in these devices and/or a shift of the redox potential of the electrolyte. Yang and co-workers reported the interaction between accumulated electrons inside TiO2 and the cations in the surrounding electrolyte are at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.22 They found the slow local charge compensation and a reversible electric field during the local charge compensation processes at these interfaces. In addition, for the theoretical study of the local electric field between the dye and the TiO2 surface, our group investigated that the lower electric field strength could lead to better performance of DSSCs.17 Inspired by the above research studies, we speculate whether the inner electric field acting on ground-state sensitizer molecules could provide a clear explanation on the greatly different efficiencies of various porphyrin-sensitizers.
Thus in the present study, we constructed a D–π–A model containing a TiO2 substrate and three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers as shown in Scheme 1, aiming to elucidate how the inner electric field of the DSSCs affects the dipole moment and the absorption spectra of these three studied types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers, exhibit the properties of short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photo-voltage under different electric field strengths, and thus improve our comprehension of dye molecular engineering in DSSCs.
2. Method
2.1 Computational details
In this work, the Gaussian09 suite of programs (Revision D.01)23 with a tight self-consistent field convergence threshold (10−8 a.u.) was employed for all calculations. The DFT with the B3LYP functional24 was used to optimize all molecules, which is a thoroughly explored method for a wide variety of dyes and dye–TiO2 systems used in the earlier studies.17,25 Based on such calculations, the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)26–28 was used to obtain the spectroscopic absorptions of three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers with the TiO2 model. The solvent effects of tetrahydrofuran (THF) were simulated by the polarizable continuum model (PCM).29,30
In our calculations, the LanL2DZ basis sets were used to carry out the quasi-relativistic pseudopotential of Ti and Zn atoms, and the split valence basis set 6-31G(d) was employed for other atoms. The Gaussian curves were used to simulate all UV/Vis spectra under a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.10 eV. The natural bond orbital (NBO) charge analysis were performed at the same level of theory by employing the NBO 3.1 program packages under different electric field strengths. Five different electric fields of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 × 10−4 a.u. (electric field strength, 1 a.u. = 5.142 × 109 V cm−1) parallel to the x-axis (normal to the TiO2 surface) were applied on the isolated dye systems. As for the dye–TiO2 systems, only two conditions are considered, without inner electric strength or with 5 × 10−4 a.u. inner electric strength paralleled to the x-axis.
In addition, the B3LYP functional was also selected to calculate the through-space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The excited-state densities have been computed within the linear-response TD-DFT framework using a vertical approximation. The electron transfer distance and the fraction of electron exchange of all sensitizers that related to the vertical transitions were calculated using Multiwfn 3.0.5.31
2.2 Theoretical background
As is known to all, the overall efficiency (η) of the DSSCs is defined by the ratio of the maximum output electrical power of the DSSCs to the energy of incident sunlight (Pin), which is determined by the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (ff) and Pin (generally AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The overall efficiency was calculated according to the following equation:32 (1)
2.3 Short-circuit current density Jsc
Accordingly, the photocurrent per unit area (mA cm−2) is expressed by the Jsc when DSSCs under irradiation is short-circuited, which is related to the interaction between TiO2 and dye as well as the absorption coefficient of the dye. The value of Jsc in DSSCs can be calculated as:33 (2)where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, Φinject denotes the electron injection efficiency, and ηcollect is the charge collection efficiency. First, a high Jsc is obtained based on eqn (2), the efficient dyes used in DSSCs should have a large LHE, which is described by: LHEλ = 1 − 10−A.(3)where A is the absorption of the dye; the larger A could fulfill a better light capturing. At the same time, a large Φinject based on eqn (2) could also guarantee a high Jsc. The Φinject is affected by the free enthalpy (ΔG) related to the electron injection from the photo-induced excited states of dyes into the TiO2 surface. The ΔG determines the electron injection rate and can be viewed as the electron injection driving force (ΔGinject).34,35 Φinject ∝ f(−ΔGinject)(4) ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB = Edye − E0−0 − ECB(5)where Edye* is the oxidation potential energy of the dye in the excited state and ECB is the reduction potential of the TiO2 conduction band (CB). Therefore, we used ECB = −4.0 eV in this work for TiO2 which is widely used in previous research studies.15 The Edye is the oxidation potential energy of the dye in the ground state, while E0–0 is the electronic vertical transition energy. Meanwhile, dye regeneration (ΔGreg) is calculated from the difference between the ground-state oxidation potential and the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3− (±4.8 eV), which is described by: ΔGreg = EI−/I3− − Edye(6)
2.4 Open circuit photovoltage VOC

V
oc is defined as the voltage difference between the electrolyte redox potential (Eredox/q) and the quasi-Fermi potential of electrons (EF,n/q) in the TiO2 semiconductor. The Voc in DSSCs is expressed by:36 (7)where ECB is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, Eredox is the electrolyte Fermi level, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the unit charge, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, and NCB is the accessible density of conduction band (CB) states. ΔCB is the shift of ECB when the dyes are adsorbed on the semiconductor surface and can be expressed as:33 (8)where q is the electron charge, μnormal is the component of the dipole moment of the individual sensitizer perpendicular to the surface of the semiconductor, γ is the dye's surface concentration, ε is the permittivity of the dipole layer, and ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum. It is obvious from eqn (7) and (8) that a dye with large nc and μnormal would exert a crucial influence on Voc.
The Stark effect is used to describe the effect of an applied electric field on an absorption or emission spectrum. The Stark spectroscopy generally represents the study of spectral changes in the presence of electric fields, which has been proven to be a wildly useful approach to characterize the changes after electron injection from the excited dye sensitizer into the semiconductor electrode. Stark effects are expected to cause a small peak shift in the absorption (or emission) spectrum but no change in line shape; that is, the applied electric field, . An absorption Stark spectrum, ΔA, is the change in an absorption spectrum area under the influence of an applied electric field:37,38ΔA = A( ≠ 0) − A( = 0)The absorption difference, ΔA, caused by the Stark effect in the spectrum of a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode is given by:  where dA/dν is the first derivative of the ground state dye absorption spectrum with respect to transition frequency. Δ is the change in the dipole moment between the ground and excited states of the dye,  is the applied electric field and h is the Plank's constant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular structure
We selected three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers (dye A, B and C) as models to detect the inner electric field effect on the performance of DSSCs. The structure of dye A is meso-substituted Zn-porphyrin, in which one meso position is decorated by an ethynylcarboxyphenyl group while the other three meso positions are grafted with the same phenyl groups. The structure of dye B is a β-substituted Zn-porphyrin. Compared with dye A, the only difference in this model is that the substituted position of the ethynylcarboxyphenyl group is changed from the meso-position to the β-position. As for dye C, the structure is quite different. It can be divided into two parts of tetrakis(phenyl) Zn-porphyrin and the linker 4-pyridyl-carboxylic acid. The tetrakis(phenyl) Zn-porphyrin can bind to the semiconductor electrode by the linker that coordinates to the metal center in the axial position. Compared with A and B type dyes, the anchor group of the C type sensitizer is obviously different, which is caused by the difference in the connection position of the anchor group to the Zn-porphyrin. We choose the 4-pyridyl-carboxylic acid as the anchor group in the C type dye. This anchoring group is known to bind strongly to semiconductor surfaces while the pyridyl group axially coordinates to the metal center of the Zn-porphyrin through the pyridyl N atom, and then sensitizing the TiO2 surface. Taking into account the representativeness and simplicity of this model, and suitable computational cost, the structures of these three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers were finally determined. These studied molecules can be considered as the basic structures of the different Zn-porphyrin sensitizers and their properties can reflect the real situation. In addition, three systems containing the TiO2 model and different types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers were constructed and are shown in Fig. 1. In these systems, the direction from the Zn-porphyrin groups to the anchor is along the x-axis. Considering the large size of different types of dye molecules, only the ground state structures are obtained in this work. In these three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers, due to the differences in the geometry structure, the type C sensitizer is somewhat different from that of type A and B sensitizers. Affected by the connector group, the porphyrin macrocycle of the type C sensitizer is not quite planar, but this plane was distorted a little bit. The Zn atom is out of the plane almost 9° from the dihedral angle and four N atoms remain almost unchanged from planarity. Accordingly, the optimized structure was employed to calculate their electronic structures and optical properties with and without an applied electric field.
 Fig. 1  (a) The direction of the inner electric field in three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers linked to the TiO2 model system. (b) The representative geometry of three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers linked to the TiO2 model after optimization. 
The most significant and interesting factor is the directional effect of the inner electric field. Therefore, a perfect model is needed to investigate our supposition, in which the dye molecule and the TiO2 surface are ordered. The direction of the electric field is defined as the vector pointing from the counter electrode to the TiO2 surface according to the electronic moving direction of the inner DSSC system, namely, the directional of the electric field is parallel to the x-axis in this work.
3.2 Absorption spectra of isolated dyes
Electronic structures are fundamental for understanding electronic absorption spectra. The schematic representation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps and orbital energies of selected frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of dyes A, B and C under different electric field strengths is given in Fig. 2. To illuminate the effect of the electric field on FMOs, the LUMO and HOMO compositions of the dye A system in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution are compiled and are given in Table 1. Besides, the important FMOs of dyes A, B and C in THF solution are displayed in ESI,† Fig. S1.

For the studied dye A, the occupied molecular orbitals of these systems can be labeled as π(Zn-por) orbitals in character, but substantially mixed with the π(PH) character. And the unoccupied molecular orbitals of dye A under different electric field strengths can be labeled as π* orbitals of Zn-porphyrin and π-bridges in character. Taking into account the different electric field strengths, the change in energy levels for the HOMO is not obvious while for the LUMO it is gradually decreased. Therefore, the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of dye A under different electric fields are smaller than that of the dye without an electric field. In general, the number of occupied MOs and unoccupied MOs involved in the absorption transition process is qualitatively similar. However, when an electric field is applied on the dye of this type, it will significantly affect the energy of occupied molecular orbitals whereas the influence on the energy of unoccupied molecular orbitals is slight.
There are eight frontier molecular orbitals (four occupied MOs and four unoccupied MOs) for the dye A system as shown in Fig. 2. The distribution of energy levels and the changing trend of the frontier molecular orbitals can be clearly observed from this figure. Considering the changing trend, the HOMO, H−1 and L+1 are not influenced by the energy that remained unchanged basically under the applied electric fields. For LUMO, L+2 and L+3, the orbital energy is gradually reduced along with the increasing electric field strength. As for H−2 and H−3, the overall trend is that their energies gradually increase along with the increasing electric field strength.
Based on the above results, the frontier molecular orbitals of dye A are obviously influenced by the inner electric field. There are some similar varying tendencies in dye A under different electric field strengths. Firstly, the variation tendency of part of LUMOs under different electric fields is from π*(Zn-por) and π*(PH) to π*(π-bridge) and π*(COOH), respectively. Namely, the component of the π-bridge is gradually increased while the components of Zn-porphyrin and phenyl groups are gradually decreased with the increase of the electric field intensity. Meanwhile, the six LUMOs of dye A under different electric field strengths are composed of π* orbitals localized on the Zn-porphyrin and partly on the π-bridge. In particular, it is found that more orbital contribution is derived from the carboxylic groups with the increase of an electric field. This is advantageous for larger charge collection efficiency. The transferred electron can reach the conduction band of the semi-conductor via photo (sunlight) excitation since the sensitizer can interact with the semi-conductor via the carboxyl group. Secondly, the energies and ingredients of HOMOs under different electric fields are almost constant. In other words, the HOMOs of dye A with or without the inner electric field are quite stable. Furthermore, the inner electric field effect on the HOMO–LUMO energy gap was also investigated by using different electric field intensities. Obviously, the HOMO–LUMO gaps of dye A under an electric field are smaller than those of the one without applying an electric field. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of all dye A systems decrease in the order of 2.422 eV (field = 0) > 2.401 eV (field = 5) > 2.367 eV (field = 10) > 2.314 eV (field = 15) > 2.242 eV (field = 20) > 2.152 eV (field = 25). The result demonstrates that the absorption spectra are systematically red-shifted with the increasing electric field. These properties could be in favor of abundant absorption in the long-wavelength region.
In comparison to dye A, the variation tendency of dye B systems (see ESI,† Table S1) is similar but with some difference to that of the HOMO energy. The varying tendency of the energy of HOMOs under different electric fields is gradually increased, while the components of HOMOs have changed little. Therefore, the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of all dye B systems decrease in the order of the system, 2.609 eV (field = 0) > 2.552 eV (field = 5) > 2.473 eV (field = 10) > 2.367 eV (field = 15) > 2.233 eV (field = 20) > 2.078 eV (field = 25).
Interestingly, unlike dye A and B systems, there are four degenerate orbitals in FMOs of the dye C system (see ESI,† Table S2). It is obvious that the LUMO+1 and the LUMO+2 of dye C are mainly delocalized on the Zn-porphyrin ring and phenyl groups. The energies of LUMO+1 and the LUMO+2 nearly degenerate with a difference of 0.001–0.007 eV under different electric fields, and the ingredients are the same. Besides, for occupied MOs, the HOMO−2 and HOMO−3 also degenerate. Overall, the all occupied molecular orbitals and L+1 and LUMO+2 are not influenced by the energy that remained unchanged basically under the applied electric fields.
For LUMO and L+3, the orbital energies decrease progressively with increasing electric field strength. Finally, the energy gaps of the HOMO–LUMO for all dye C systems decrease in the order of 2.587 eV (field = 0) > 2.474 eV (field = 5) > 2.358 eV (field = 10) > 2.239 eV (field = 15) > 2.119 eV (field = 20) > 1.999 eV (field = 25).
The absorption spectra of dyes A, B and C in the THF solution were also obtained by employing the TD-B3LYP method to reveal the solvent effect on the optical properties. The absorption results of dye A systems associated with its oscillator strengths and main excitation are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The fitted Gaussian-type absorption curves between 350 and 750 nm based on the calculated absorption data are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Simulated absorption spectra of dye A, B and C systems under different field strengths in THF solution. 
Taking dye A as an example, two strong absorption bands were obtained with the absorption peaks at 599 and 441 nm without inducing an electric field. It can be clearly seen that the absorption spectra can be divided into two main regions with the first intense peak in the 400–500 nm region and the second peak in the range of 550–650 nm. The excitation of H−1 → L+1 and HOMO → L+2 contributed to the strongest absorption at 441 nm while the second strong absorption at 599 nm mainly proceeds through the HOMO–LUMO. These main electron transitions can be assigned to the intra Zn-porphyrin charge transfer.
The absorption spectra of dye A with different electric fields were simulated for the insight into the optical properties and electronic transition. The simulated absorption spectra of dye A under different electric fields reveal that the lowest-energy absorption (λmax) bands red shift from 599 to 651 with the enhancement of the electric field strengths from 0 to 25 × 10−4 a.u. The results indicate that the electron transitions for the lowest-energy absorption bands mainly originate from the HOMO → LUMO transition. Meanwhile, the oscillator strengths of the lowest-energy absorption peaks of dyes with different electric field strengths are higher than that without an electric field. The reason is that the distribution of an electron cloud involved in the orbital could be affected by the electric field, which contributes to a higher overlap during electron transitions. Clearly, the changes in these spectra could be ascribed to the inner electric field. Therefore, these absorptions are beneficial to the light harvesting efficiency, thus affecting the performance of DSSCs.
For all the dye B systems (see ESI,† Table S4), there are three absorption bands in dye B without an electric field. The strongest absorption at 453 nm is contributed by excitation HOMO → L+1 and H−1 → LUMO. This excitation can be assigned as intra Zn-porphyrin charge transfer. In addition, the excitations responsible for the other strong absorption at 367 nm originate from H−1 to L+2. This excitation can be ascribed as π(Zn-phy) and π(π-bridge) to π*(Zn-phy) and π*(π-bridge) transition character and the COOH groups taking part in the transition process. The excitations of HOMO → LUMO and H−1 → L+1 excitation leads to the lowest energy absorption at 570 nm, which can also be assigned as intra Zn-porphyrin charge transfer. Moreover, the lowest-energy absorption (λmax) bands of dye B red shift from 570 to 706 nm with the enhancement of electric field strengths from 0 to 25 × 10−4 a.u. On the whole, the changing trend of the absorption is the same as that of the dye A system, so we think that the effect of the inner electric field is the same as that of the dye A system.
Moreover, different from the dye A and B systems, the dye C system (see ESI,† Table S5) has simple absorption properties without an electric field. The strongest peak at 404 nm is attributed to excitation H−1 → L+1 and HOMO → L+2. This absorption peak could be assigned as the electron transfer from the contribution of π orbitals of Zn-porphyrin to π* orbitals of Zn-porphyrin itself. For the other absorption peak at 451 nm, the excitation of HOMO → L+2 and H−1 → L+1 are in charge of it and can also be assigned as intra Zn-porphyrin. The calculated lowest energy absorption with very weak oscillator strength (0.0058, the weakest among the calculated absorptions) at 595 nm is contributed by HOMO → LUMO excitation. This electron transitions can be assigned to the charge transfer from the Zn-porphyrin to the π-conjugation bridge and the COOH group. The changes in the electric field have little effect on the absorption spectrum of dye C systems. Although the lowest-energy absorption bands red shift from 595 to 826 nm along with the increasing electric field strength, their oscillator strengths are so weak that they can be ignored. For other two strong absorption peaks, the oscillator strength and the position are the same, and no change has occurred.
To summarize, the calculated UV-Visible absorptions of all three types of dyes are influenced by the inner electric field except for dye C systems. The absorption spectra of dye A and B systems are gradually broadened and red-shifted while the increase of electric field strength. Therefore, these absorptions are helpful for charge transfer in DSSCs.
3.3 Absorption spectra of three types of sensitizers on the TiO2 surface
As a matter of fact, dye sensitizers are mainly connected onto the surface of nanometer-size TiO2 in a DSSC. The adsorption model of the dye attached on TiO2 is important to the electron injection process. Hence, it is worth pointing out the calculations for the properties of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 systems.
The choice of the TiO2 model in our simulation is vital for the rationality and accuracy. In general, anatase nano-TiO2 form is more photo-catalytic than that the rutile, and the nanoscale rutile less photo-reactive than anatase. Moreover, titanium dioxide (101) surfaces, most thermodynamically stable in nano-crystals, dominated the majority of the external surface of TiO2 (more than 94% percent).39 Actually, the large models of TiO2 are likely to represent the real TiO2 surface while the advisable approximation of the adopted model is necessary. The effect of orbital coupling is considered before designing the final ideal model. Those Ti atoms connected directly with the carboxyl group should make an overwhelming contribution to the charge-transfer process, which affords primary transition-related orbitals in the absorption process. And it could be concluded that the distance between Ti atoms and the anchoring group become key factors. Taking into account the computational cost and size, finally, the anatase Ti5O20H22(101) model from crystal structures was adopted as the surface of the TiO2 film in the current work.17,40 This model is cut out from the relaxed surface slab. These Ti atoms can be divided into two types: one is five-coordinated and the other is six-coordinated. The five-coordinated Ti atoms are located at the anatase (101) surface, which is used as the adsorption site. In addition, the six-coordinated Ti atoms are cut out from the TiO2 crystal bulk. Hydrogen saturators were used on oxygen atoms, and this method not only maintains bond-orientation in crystals, but also avoids the chaos of charge and multiplicity in the whole system.
Besides, the electronic structure of the TiO2 model was analyzed. The density of states (DOS) is presented in ESI† Fig. S2. Moreover, to illustrate the electronic structure, the frontier molecular orbital compositions are listed in Table S6 (ESI†). These characteristics are in accordance with that of the understanding of the TiO2 semiconductor material.
Compared with the conduction band edge position of −4.3 eV for anatase, the LUMO energy level of the single-crystal anatase (TiO2)5 model (location at −4.281 eV) has provided the more appropriate and corresponding result. Therefore, the electronic structure and related results of the single-crystal anatase (TiO2)5 model are reasonable and accurate for describing the conduction band properties of the semiconductor.
In the DSSC device, besides the neutral forms, the dye sensitizers will dissociate and adsorb on the semiconductor surface. Following this, we investigate the connection type between dye molecules and the TiO2 film. Essentially, the carboxylic acid groups act as linkers, ensuring efficient adsorption of the dye on the surface and also promoting electronic coupling between the donor of the excited dye sensitizer and the favorable acceptor levels of the TiO2 semiconductor. The type of anchor functionality and the linker between the sensitizer and the semiconductor surface can enhance electronic coupling and/or alter the surface state energetic activity, so that electron injection is faster and more efficient. Consequentially, the connection type between dye molecules and the TiO2 film is a crucial factor for the electron injection process.41 At last the bidentate bridging type is appropriate in this work. The bidentate bridging type is firm, which is the most important connection type causing the interaction strength and absorption efficiency in our systems. According to the calculation, the bond lengths between two carboxylate oxygens and connected titanium atoms on the TiO2 model of the dye A, B and C systems are 2.053/2.130 Å, 2.061/2.133 Å and 2.085/2.180 Å, respectively. Compared to the bond length data of the TiO2 film (1.930 and 1.973 Å) and calculated data, our data have provided more appropriate results. In this contribution, the bidentate bridging type is considered throughout for a reasonable connection mode and for suitable distance within the binding.
In the same way, the appropriate dye–TiO2 structure was employed to calculate the electronic structures and optical properties with and without an applied electric field. The frontier molecular orbitals, which are responsible for the absorption wavelength (λ) longer than 350 nm (see Fig. 4), are plotted according to their energies. Furthermore, orbital compositions of A-TiO2 systems are summarized in Table 2. In this work, orbital-coupling is an effective method of orbital overlap to reduce the orbital energy, which is done by combining the p orbital of the carboxyl group with the d orbital of the TiO2 semiconductor to extend the π-conjugate degree and increase the charge injection ability. The interaction between the dye sensitizer and the TiO2 semiconductor is present in the dye–TiO2 system and it is hard to analyze separately the character of the dye and the TiO2 semiconductor as the dye and TiO2 semiconductor are considered completely a unitary system. Although the orbital couple cannot be expressed with a clear numerical form, it can determine the strength of the orbital couple by the energy and the contribution ratio of the main component. So, we think that it is still significant to study the dye–TiO2 system in this way. Molecular orbital profiles of frontier molecular orbitals, involved in lowest-energy absorption, are shown in ESI† Fig. S3, illustrating the charge injection from dye molecules into the conduction band of the TiO2 film.

For A-TiO2 systems, similar to the isolated dye A, the change of HOMO energy levels is not obvious, but the LUMO energy levels are gradually decreased with increasing electric field strength. Herein, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the A-TiO2 systems without an electric field (2.422 eV) is larger than that of A-TiO2 systems with an electric field (2.401 eV). Due to the similar properties of the occupied molecular orbital for A-TiO2 systems with and without electric field strength, for which the HOMO entirely lies on dye A, we only need to pay attention to the unoccupied molecular orbital. Under the without an electric field condition, orbital-coupling is good between the dye and the TiO2 semiconductor so that it can reduce the orbital energy level. The LUMO is mainly composed of the TiO2 film with compositions up to 91%. The high photo-voltaic conversion efficiency of DSSCs requires rapid and efficient electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction bond of the TiO2 film. Thus, when absorption occurs, we believe that the electrons were stimulated and they entered into the TiO2 film directly.
However, it is surprising that the situation has changed as the inner electric field is applied. The energies of the LUMOs decline obviously leading to the main components of the LUMOs from the dye molecule into the TiO2 film. In other words, because of the change in field strength, the proportion of the TiO2 film increases and the proportion of dye A decreases in the LUMO composition. Similar to the field = 0 condition, ultrafast excited-state electron injection is the primary method of charge transfer from dye A to the TiO2 film. Moreover, it would result in long-time scale and high utilization of solar energy.
When dye B and C molecules (see ESI,† Tables S7 and S8) are connected to the TiO2 film at the (101) surface, the effects of the applied electric field on them are the same as those of the A-TiO2 system. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of dyes B and C on TiO2 surface systems both decrease in the order of 2.367 eV (off-field) > 2.314 eV (on-field) and 2.242 eV (off-field) > 2.152 eV (on-field). Meanwhile, the main components of the LUMOs are from the dye molecule into the TiO2 film for B-TiO2 and C-TiO2 systems. Generally, the inner electric field could deeply affect the distribution of energy levels and components of the frontier molecular orbitals, and the influence on the spectrum needs further analysis.
In addition, the fitted Gaussian-type absorption curves based on the calculated absorption data are shown in Fig. 5. For the A-TiO2 system, all dominant excitations in the absorption process are listed in Table S9 (ESI†). We seek to understand the effect of the inner electric field on the absorption behavior of different type sensitizers, and its impact on the efficiency of different type sensitizers is demonstrated in this paper. Five strong absorption bands were calculated with the absorption peaks at 405, 486, 630, 715 and 830 nm for the A-TiO2 system without an electric field. The strongest absorption is at 405 nm, and the excitation responsible for it originates from the same occupied orbital H−1 but terminates different virtual orbitals L+13 and L+14. Although the number of absorption bands is very large and the orbitals involved in the transition process are very complex, the nature of the transition can be divided into two categories. One category is assigned as the electron transfer completely from the contribution of the π orbitals of dye molecules to the d orbitals of TiO2, such as absorption bands at 830 nm. The other is assigned as the electron transfer from the contribution of the π orbitals of dye molecules to the d orbitals of TiO2 and the π orbitals of dye molecules partially taking part in the transition process, such as absorption bands at 405, 486, 630 and 715 nm. These facts showed a satisfactory electronic coupling between dye molecules and the semiconductor surface which enforced the direct electron transfer mechanism.
 Fig. 5  Simulated absorption spectra of dyes A, B and C on the TiO2 model with and without electric field strengths in THF solution. 
The absorption of the dye A-TiO2 system under an electric field is quite different from that from the off-field system, especially for the oscillator strength and absorption range. The absorption spectra of the A-TiO2 system with an electric field present the lowest energy absorption peak at 1033 nm, which is clearly shifted to longer wavelengths relative to that of the off-field condition. Moreover, the strongest absorption wavelength of the A-TiO2 with the electric field system is at 410 nm, and the electric field has little effect on the strongest absorption position but has an enhanced effect obviously on the oscillator strength. This transition composition of the dye molecule itself is increased for the strongest absorption composition, but the proportion of this contribution is not large (29%). The main transition process is still the charge transfer from the dye molecule to the semiconductor, and thus this transition is conducive to electron injection.
There are three strong absorption peaks in the B-TiO2 system. The strongest absorption at 401 nm is contributed by excitation H−1 → L+11 and HOMO → L+13 (see ESI,† Table S10). The calculated lowest energy absorption at 802 nm cannot be distinguished in the absorption spectrum, and this may be due to its weak oscillator strength (0.0160, the weakest among the calculated absorptions). The characteristics of the transition are essentially the same as that of the A-TiO2 system, and thus it has a similar electron injection mechanism.
For the dye B-TiO2 system under an electric field, the absorption becomes red-shifted due to the existence of the electric field. In addition, the oscillator strengths of absorption peaks become smaller than that of the off-field condition. The lowest energy absorption peak is shifted to longer wavelengths at 1025 nm. More importantly, the strongest absorption is at 406 nm, the biggest difference lies with the increase of the transition contribution of the dye molecule itself. It is contributed by H−1 → L+15 and HOMO → L+14 excitation, and this excitation can be ascribed to the charge transfer of dye molecules themselves. This kind of charge-transfer would lead to emission or relaxation of oscillation electron injection, namely, dye B is excited from the ground states and then the excited electron is injected into the CB of the semiconductor, which would result in long-time scale and low utilization of solar energy.
As for the C-TiO2 system, its absorption curve is very simple (see ESI,† Table S11). As can be seen that there are only two absorption peaks for this system, in which the strongest absorption at 311 nm is contributed by excitation H−1 → L+14 and HOMO → L+15, whereas the excitations of HOMO → L+15 and H−1 → L+14 lead to the lowest energy absorption at 560 nm. All excitations can be ascribed to the charge transfer of dye molecules itself.
While the C-TiO2 system with an electric field, the absorption spectrum is almost the same as that of the C-TiO2 system without an electric field, but the oscillator strength is low. From the nature of the transition point of view, the properties are similar to the C-TiO2 system without an electric field. The biggest difference is that there is a transition from dye C to the TiO2 model charge transfer. However, the proportion of this contribution is not large, and the charge transfer of the dye molecule itself is still the main transition. Hence, the inner electric field has no obvious effect on the absorption of the C system.
To summarize, the transition from the HOMO with dye orbital character to the LUMO with prominent TiO2 will shift to a lower energy side in the presence of an inner electric field. Then, we can easily understand the new peaks and intensity changes of absorptions. Moreover, it is found that the inner electric field has different effects on the absorption spectra of different Zn-porphyrin sensitizers. Therefore, the inner electric field is an important influencing factor for the best performance of the dye sensitizers.
3.4 Intramolecular charge transfer
Effective electron–hole separation of the dye sensitizer is a crucial factor to obtain high photocurrent conversion efficiency. It originated from the intramolecular electronic excitation to a charge transfer state upon photo-excitation. In particular for the structure of push–pull zinc porphyrin sensitizers, scientific workers have done in-depth research recently.42–44 These studies have pointed out that the insertion of an electron donating group at the appropriate position is a useful method to improve the efficiency of the DSSCs. Meanwhile, we believe that the model of all three types of sensitizer also has the push–pull function. In this work, the Zn-porphyrin is considered to be a donor. Generally, the Zn-porphyrin is connected to one more electron donor group for the real sensitizers, in order to achieve the purpose of enhancing the electron-donating ability. Secondly, the anchoring carboxyl group of the sensitizers is used as an acceptor. Finally, the structure between the porphyrin and the carboxyl group is also the π-bridge. In our view, the results of the type A sensitizer are also applicable to the push–pull type molecules. Therefore, an understanding of the processes of different type push–pull zinc porphyrin sensitizers involved in the intramolecular electron transfer under different inner electric fields is very important for DSSCs.
Ciofini et al. put forward a simple and effective dipolar approach to quantify charge transfer phenomena.45 And, this method was successfully used to study every electron transition of various types of dye molecules, such as Ru-based complexes, organic sensitizers and Zn-porphyrin sensitizers.46–48 The electronic densities derived from the ground and excited states for their vertical electronic excitation (ρGS(r) and ρEX(r), respectively) were defined. Subsequently, two functions ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be given to define the increase and decrease of the density owing to the electron transition. The barycenters of the spatial regions defined by ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be written as:  The distance of charge transfer (DCT) can be defined as:DCT = |R+ − R−|Integrating over all the space ρ+(r) (or ρ−(r)), the transferred charge (qCT) can be defined. Analogously, the dipole moment variation between the ground and the excited states (μCT) can be computed by the following relations:  For visualization purposes, two intuitive anisotropic Gaussian distributions of charge associated with the positive and negative density regions are defined as follows. The root-mean-square deviations which represent the distributions of density variation along the three axes (σa,j, j = x, y, z; a = + or −) are computed as:  Then, two anisotropic Gaussian distributions (Ca, a = + or −) are simply defined as:  where Aa (a = + or −) are the normalization factors. The index H, the half of the sum of the Gaussian distribution axis along the D–A direction, has been computed. For example, if the inner electric field direction is along the x axis, H is defined as:  The t represents the difference between DCT and H:t = Dct − Hwhere t is a tool that can be used to define the degree of through space character of an electronic transition.
Finally, the overlapping extent between C+(r) and C−(r) is used to evaluate the charge separation degree. It is defined as:  The value near to 1 means that the two functions are completely overlapped, and it approaches 0 indicating that they are completely separated.
In order to analyze the nature of the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption spectrum of three type Zn-porphyrin sensitizers, the key parameters and the associated indexes of dye A systems are calculated and the results are presented in Table 3. The electron density difference plots gave a clear vision of electron movement after photo-excitation. The relevant difference density plots of dye A systems are collected in Fig. 6. Our purpose is to illustrate how the inner electric field affects the charge separation and the electron transfer process of three type Zn-porphyrin sensitizers, which is important for understanding the different photo-to-electric efficiency of different types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers. In the first instance, the porphyrin ring has generally a donor behavior for dye A without an electric field system except in the case of the 1st transition. They show the donor character towards the ethynylbenzoic acid carrying the anchoring group and thus expected to be particularly efficient for charge injection. The Zn-porphyrin actually plays the role of a primary donor group and it is found to be involved in the 3rd, 4th, and 9th transitions of all the charge transfer characteristics.

 Fig. 6  Computed electronic density variation Δρ for selected transitions of the dye A system with different electric field strengths. The blue and orange lobes represent a density increase and depletion upon excitation, respectively. 
This analysis is numerically quantified by the inspection of the computed associated DCT values which are of 3.629, 3.389 and 4.030 Å for the 3rd, 4th and 9th, respectively, and only of 0.610 Å for the first transition. Fortunately, this transition is also relatively weak so the light is expected to be mainly absorbed by efficient transitions for charge injection that is those that bring the electron density closer to the COOH group. Moreover, the qCT values of the 3rd, 4th and 9th are 0.353, 0.316 and 0.519 e, respectively, which are much larger than that of the 1st (0.213 e). That is, the most efficient transitions for charge injection seem to be the 3rd, 4th and 9th transitions since they combine important qCT values to a strong increase in the electronic density of the anchoring group that could lead to quick electron injection by enhancing the electronic coupling between the sensitizer and the semiconductor surface.
Different from dye A without an electric field system, the transitions of dye B with electric field systems (see ESI,† Fig. S4 and Table S12) are not only in the number of major transitions but also in nature. With the enhancement of the electric field strength, the number of the main transition increases. Meanwhile, DCT and qCT values gradually become larger with the increase of the electric field strength. The OverlapC+–C− values for dye B with electric field systems generally become smaller which indicates that the degree of electron–hole separation becomes larger as the electric field strength increases. All transitions show similar properties, namely, the charge transfers from Zn-porphyrin to the anchoring group. Thus, the inner electric field has a positive effect on the dye A system.
For the sake of simplicity and clarity only changing trends of the dye B system with and without an electric field will be discussed. The porphyrin ring has both donor and acceptor behaviors for dye B without an electric field system. This shows that a β-substituted porphyrin sensitizer may not be as good as a meso-substituted porphyrin sensitizer. However, the situation is changed when the inner electric field is present. DCT and qCT values gradually become larger with the increase of the electric field strength. In addition, due to the OverlapC+–C− values for dye B with electric field systems generally become smaller, electron–hole separation becomes larger. Importantly, the nature of all transitions has changed; the porphyrin ring has completely donor properties so that the charge transfers are from Zn-porphyrin and phenyl groups to the anchoring group. In the same way, the inner electric field has a positive effect on the dye B system.
Interestingly, and in contrast to what has been discussed in the cases of dye A and B under different electric field systems, the transitions of dye C systems (see ESI,† Fig. S5 and Table S13) under different electric field systems are essentially the same. That is, the inner electric field has little effect on the dye C system. On the whole, no matter how the electric field strength is changed, the porphyrin ring always behaves as both a donor and an acceptor for the dye C system. Therefore, compared to the two systems above, electron injection of the dye C system will slow down, which may also be a factor for the low efficiency of the C type Zn-porphyrin sensitizer.
3.5 Electrostatic potentials and natural bond orbital analysis
We focused on the relationship between the inner electric field and the charge distribution properties. The electrostatic potential (EPS) map can be considered as an indicator of charge distribution. As can be seen from Fig. 7, for the off-field condition, the negative charges are located on the tetrapyrrole macrocycle and the O atom of the carboxyl group for the dye A and B systems. Meanwhile, the positive charges are mainly located on the Zn2+ cation, phenyl groups and the H atom of the carboxyl group. It is well known that an efficient sensitizer used in DSSCs is normally featured with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure. Herein, the Zn-porphyrin core is considered as a donor group, and the electron-donating group such as phenyl groups attached to the Zn-porphyrin can enhance the donating electron capability of the donor group, increasing the possibility of accepting electrons by the π-bridge and the anchoring group. This also has a positive effect on the performance of the obtained DSSCs.
 Fig. 7  Maps of electrostatic potential for dyes A, B and C with different electric field strengths. (Blue and red represents positive and negative, respectively.) 
Conversely, we can find obvious differences among the distributions of ESP for dye A and B systems under different electric field strengths. Under the electric field, the negative charge region is still partly located on the tetrapyrrole macrocycle of dye A and B sensitizers, but the negative charge region becomes smaller with the increasing field strength. Moreover, the positive charge region for the phenyl groups gradually increases with the increase of electric field strength. This phenomenon suggests that the electric field can strengthen the electron-donating capability of the Zn-porphyrin and phenyl groups, and thus enhance the performance of DSSCs.
Unfortunately, for the dye C system, the EPS has no change for the dye C system under different electric field strengths. The negative charges are also located on the tetrapyrrole macrocycle and the O atom of the carboxyl group for all dye C systems, and the positive charges are mainly located on phenyl groups and the H atom of the carboxyl group. Interestingly, different from the above two systems, there are no obvious positive charges on the Zn2+ cation. Overall, the inner electric field still has little effect on the dye C system.
The natural bond orbital (NBO) charges on the six atoms lie in the x-axis, parallel to the electric direction in dye A systems under different electric field strengths, which are listed in Table 4. From Table 4, the NBO charges on atom C1 have no obvious change adjusting the electric field strength. As for other atoms, the charges on C3 and C5 atoms increase, while the charges on C2, C4 and C6 atoms decrease along with increasing electric field strength. The dye A and B systems (see ESI,† Table S14) showed the same changing trend. While, no matter how much the field strength is, the NBO charges almost have no change for the dye C system (see ESI,† Table S15). It indicates that the charge distribution is not affected by the internal electric field. The x-axis components of the inherent dipole moment of dye A, B and C systems without an electric field are −5.1421, −4.4161 and 4.1342 D, respectively. When the inner electric field is applied, the electron density distribution is broken and leads to a change in the dipole moment. The direction of the induced dipole moment is immobile and the value of the dipole moment is increased with an increasing electric field for dye A and B systems in the field range used. As for dye C systems, the value of the dipole moment is decreased with the increasing electric field and the direction of the induced dipole moment is immobile. But, we think that when the inner electric field strength continues to increase, the dipole direction may be reversed.

3.6 Theoretical understanding of the efficiency of three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers with an inner electric field in DSSCs
Now we assess the performance of the three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers with and without an inner electric field in solar cells from a theoretical point of view. We have provided some reasonable explanation on the influence of the inner electric field on the efficiency of the DSSCs. To gain insight into the efficiency of different types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers under different electric fields, the properties of photo-current and photo-voltage were simulated in this work. In order to evaluate the photo-current and photo-voltage performance of different types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers, the next two criteria are used to set up an effective ranking: (1) the key parameters (ΔGinject, ΔGreg and LHE) of the dye should have to be as large as possible so as to enlarge Jsc; (2) increasing the TiO2 conduction band edge to increase the Voc.
A key factor related to the efficiency of DSSCs is the performance of the sensitizer without an inner electric field with respect to the incident light. Based on the LHE of the dye, the value has to be as high as possible to maximize the photocurrent response. In this work, the peak area calculation method that we used is more precise and accurate than the maximum absorption method because it covers all excited state transitions, even low-intensity transitions, and a quantitative study would be possible. Moreover, this method has been successfully used in previous work.18,19 The peak area for all systems has been calculated and listed in Table 5. For all systems, the peak area is calculated through the following equation: (9)Taking into account the actual operation conditions of the DSSCs, the peak area for the dye–TiO2 system without an inner electric field in THF solution is selected to serve as an A-reference (Aref) for different types of sensitizers. As it is observable from the data in Table 5, the peak area is increased with the increasing electric field strength, which is a result of peak broadening and red-shifted for the dye A system. It indicates that the dye A sensitizer under an inner electric field has more efficient LHE as compared to the off-field condition. Thus, we can conclude that the electric field can lead to a high photon to current response compared to the off-field condition. However, in contrast to the A system, the peak area of dye B and C systems is decreased with the increasing electric field strength. Hence, these phenomena lead to a low LHE value.

(The A is the absorption peak area of dye A, B and C systems with and without different local electric strengths. The Aref is the absorption peak area for the dye A, B and C systems without an inner electric field. The ΔA is the difference in the absorption peak area between A and Aref. Moreover, the A% is the ratio of ΔA to Aref)

In addition, the driving force of the electron injection (ΔGinject) is an important property that could help increase the Jsc values. Thus, the electronic injection free enthalpy ΔGinject, ground (Edye) and excited state (Edye*) oxidation potentials computed for the A sensitizer under different electric fields are summarized in Table 6 and Fig. 8.

 Fig. 8  Theoretical oxidation potentials (eV) of dyes A, B and C with different electric field strengths. The band gap was based on the E0–0 transition in THF solution. 
The ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) is related to the total electron attachment energy in solution. The rigorous way to obtain the GSOP (ΔGox) is to compute free energy difference between the neutral and the oxidized ground-state species, (G0–G+)GS.49 The Gibbs free energy in solution of a species i (Gisolv) is defined as: Gisolv = Givac + ΔGisolv(10)where Givac is the Gibbs free energy in the gas phase and ΔGisolv is the free energy of solution. This method requires the inclusion of the translational, rotational, and vibrational contribution to the total partition function, which is computationally more accurate. As can be seen from the data in Fig. 8, the energies of Edye, E0–0 and Edye* are decreased for dye A and B systems (see ESI,† Table S16) with the increasing electric field strength, which is a result of small ΔGinject and large ΔGreg. We think that the inner electric field has a moderating effect on sensitizer energies, and this effect is mutual; on the one hand, the electric field can affect the values of ΔGinject and ΔGreg, thereby affecting the Jsc; on the other hand, the intensity of Jsc can influence the electric field strength. In general, the value of ΔGinject should be at least ∼0.5 eV higher than the ECB that has been recommended by Grätzel for efficient solar energy-to-current conversion.50 And, in order to have an efficient dye regeneration process, the ΔGreg should be about 0.2 eV.51,52 Although the value of ΔGinject decreases, it can still guarantee the efficient electron injection process and reduce unnecessary waste of excited energy. At the same time, the increase of the ΔGreg value can guarantee the successful completion of the sensitizer regeneration process. Also, we believe that this interaction will reach the equilibrium state; this would be a time of the best performance of the sensitizer. Moreover, for the dye C system (see ESI,† Table S17), the energies of E0–0 and Edye* are decreased, and the energies of Edye have no change. This situation has led to the gradual decreases of ΔGreg constant and ΔGinject. Hence, the effect of the internal electric field on the C system is disadvantageous to the efficiency of DSSCs.
As discussed in this section, we know that besides the short-circuit current density Jsc the overall power conversion efficiency also could be influenced by the open-circuit voltage Voc. The shift in the conduction band of the semiconductor could lead to an increase in the Voc. This shift can be assessed based on the increase in the μnormal of the adsorbed molecules pointing outward from the semiconductor surface. In this work, we utilized μx-ads symbol instead of μnormal to distinguish it from the dipole moment of bare dyes (μx-bare). As shown in Table 5, the variation trend of the μx-ads for the three types of Zn-porphyrin sensitizers are the same, namely, the dipole moment along the direction of the x-axis gradually decreases with increasing electric field strength. All systems have larger μ values under the electric field condition compared to the off-field condition. This infers that all the Zn-porphyrin sensitizers with an electric field would likely shift the CB of the semiconductor toward the vacuum energy level, thus producing qualitatively higher Voc values. As a consequence, we could draw a conclusion that the appropriate ΔGinject and ΔGreg with large LHE and Voc have high efficiency. Thus, the performance of DSSCs sensitized by dye A with an inner electric field might be superior to that of dye B under the on-field condition, due to its favorable performances of the above factors based on our computed results. Moreover, according to our calculation results, the C system have the worst performance parameters, which may be the reason why the low efficiency of this kind of dye.
4. Conclusion
In this work, theoretical calculations have been performed on the three Zn-porphyrin sensitizer systems under the different electric fields to reveal the electronic structures, and optical properties, focusing on the theoretical understanding of their performance as sensitizers in DSSCs. The calculation results indicate that the inner electric field is a crucial factor which affects the electron density distribution, electron transition nature, and the electron transport activity in DSSCs. Meanwhile, the effects of the inner electric field on the different structures of sensitizer molecules are also different. Although the inner electric field has a great influence on its photoelectric properties, some key parameters are not as good as the dye A system. In the end, the inner electric field has little effect on the dye C system, even though there is also a disadvantage. This may become a factor in their general efficiency.
Among all systems, the meso-substituted Zn-porphyrin sensitizer (dye A system) under the on-field condition would perform more efficiently than under any off-field condition according to the calculated key parameters (ΔGinject, ΔGreg, LHE and ΔECB). Inspection of the frontier MOs of the dye A system absorbed onto the TiO2 film also indicates larger orbital-coupling strength in the on-field condition, which will facilitate electron injection from dye to the CB of TiO2. Therefore, we believe that the dye A system has self-promoting properties. Namely, when the A dye is used in DSSCs, the inner electric field generated will increase the dye properties, which in turn will produce stronger electric field strength, and finally reach equilibrium. This may be one of the reasons that the meso-substituted Zn-porphyrin sensitizers have the highest efficiency.
Overall, our calculated results demonstrate that it is the key for the molecular engineering aspect of molecular design, which can adjust the inner electric field strength and raise the performance of the dye molecule and DSSCs. These results should be helpful for establishing the relationships of the molecular structure and efficiency, and to deepen the understanding of the operation mechanism of DSSCs in detail.
