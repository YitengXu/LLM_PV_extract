    , Accepted 29th August 2016First published on 22nd September 2016AbstractSolution processing of a layer-by-layer structure is possible with a precursor approach, in which the soluble precursors of the insoluble or low-solubility target materials are spin-coated on the substrate and converted to insoluble semiconducting films by heating. We attempted to construct a p–i–n structure (p: p-layer; i: interlayer, a mixture of p- and n-materials; n: n-layer) using a solution process. To increase the donor–acceptor interface area, we synthesized covalently linked donor–acceptor compounds, tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP)–fullerene (C60) dyad. To investigate the effect of the covalent connection of the donor and acceptor units on the film morphology and on the OPV performances, the BP and fullerene units were connected by a flexible or rigid linker (f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60). To synthesize these dyads, new synthetic routes with mono-meso-substituted BPs using [2 + 2] and [2 + 1 + 1] condensation reactions were performed. The intramolecular fluorescence quenching efficiency of BP by the C60 unit of f-BP–C60 was higher than that of r-BP–C60 in CH2Cl2 because of the flexibility of the linker and the close location of the C60 unit to the BP unit. The carrier mobility in the r-BP–C60 film measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique was better than that of the f-BP–C60 film, and the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type OPV performance of the r-BP–C60 film was better than that of the f-BP–C60 film. In spite of the superior OPV performance of the r-BP–C60 device compared to the f-BP–C60, the short circuit current density (JSC) and FF of the p–i–n device with BP, f-BP–C60, and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) for p-, i- and n-layers was better than the device with r-BP–C60 as the i-layer. AFM images of the layers and OPV performances suggested that the flexible f-BP–C60 is suitable for the i-layer on the highly crystalline BP film because the roughness of the BP film is leveled by the f-BP–C60, and the electric properties of the device are improved by the smooth interface.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have attracted attention as the next-generation solar cells, which will be thin, light, and flexible power conversion devices.1–6 To achieve devices with photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%, many kinds of polymer and small-molecular materials have been reported for solution-processed OPVs.7–15 Because of the good solubility of these materials in solvents, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure is dominant for solution processed OPVs. The supremacy of the p–i–n layered structure, in which “i” means the interlayer between the p- and n-layers, has been reported for vacuum deposited OPVs.16–23 However, a solution-processed layer-by-layer structure is difficult to attain because the lower layer is washed away upon the coating of the upper layer.
Recently, thermal and photoprecursor approaches have been reported for the construction of solution processed layer-by-layer structures.24–30 The precursor approach is a way to make an insoluble organic semiconductor film by spin-coating soluble precursors, and this is followed by a quantitative change of the precursors to the insoluble target materials by heating or photoirradiation in situ. Tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) and its metal complexes are some of the best p-type organic semiconducting materials.31–33 Their films can be prepared by the thermal precursor approach using bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene (BCOD)-fused porphyrins (CP)34 or dimethylbicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene (MeBCOD) fused porphyrins (MeCP)35 as the soluble precursors. The thin films of CP and MeCP can be converted to BP films by heating at 180–200 °C. Because of the high crystallinity of BP, the BP films prepared by this method are polycrystalline with grain sizes of 100 nm, which is larger than the average exciton diffusion length in organic materials.24,36
Recently, we reported fullerene-linked 5-butyl-BP (Bu-BP–C60) for the bulk-heterojunction layer to improve the miscibility of p- and n-materials by connecting BP and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with a flexible linker.37 A BHJ device of Bu-BP–C60 showed a better OPV performance (PCE = 0.15%) than a mixed-layer of BP and PCBM (PCE = 0.02%). Furthermore, the performance of a p–i–n device composed of BP(p)-, Bu-BP–C60(i)- and PCBM(n)-layers (PCE = 1.98%) was better than that of the p–i–n device using a mixture of BP and PCBM for the i-layer because of a better fill factor (FF = 0.60) in the former device than the latter (FF = 0.46). However, the performance was still not satisfactory. We hypothesized that the flexible spacer between BP and C60 might accelerate the electron recombination as well as the charge separation between BP and C60. To verify the hypothesis, we designed a mono-substituted BP–C60 connected by a flexible linker (f-BP–C60) and rigid linker (r-BP–C60) (Chart 1). The butyl group of the Bu-BP–C60 was removed to exclude the effect of the insulating alkyl group on BP, if any. The carrier mobility and OPV performance of BHJ and p–i–n devices with these materials will be discussed.

For the preparation of f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60, an effective synthetic procedure for unsymmetrical meso-substituted porphyrins is necessary, but it is still limited. Only a few synthetic routes for mono-meso-substituted porphyrins have been reported so far: [2 + 1 + 1] condensation reaction,38–40 [2 + 2] condensation reaction,38,41–44 the reaction of tripyrranes with mono-substituted pyrroles,38,45 and the oxidation of pentapyrrane.46 The yields of the mono-substituted porphyrins were low to moderate. The meso-substitution of porphyrin with RLi,38,47,48 the Vilsmeier formylation of copper porphyrin,49 and chlorination of octaethylporphyrin by N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS)50 also gave mono-meso-substituted porphyrins, but the synthesis of the 5-substituted porphyrin is still limited. The mono-substituted BPs have hardly been reported as far as we know, except a selective halogenation of the precursor CP followed by a thermal conversion to BP.50
Here, we will report on the synthesis of a mono-substituted CPs by [2 + 2] and [2 + 1 + 1] condensation reactions in 30–50% yields. The mono-substituted porphyrins lead to f-CP–C60 and r-CP–C60, the precursors of f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60, as the materials for the interlayers of the solution-processed, three-layered organic photovoltaics.
Results and discussion
A flexible precursor (f-CP–C60) of mono-substituted free-base BP–C60 was prepared as shown in Scheme 1a. The synthetic details are described in the ESI.† 5-Substituted ZnCP4a was obtained via a [2 + 2] condensation reaction of BCOD-fused dipyrromethane 151 with paraformaldehyde (2) and 4-formylbutyric acid methyl ester (3),52 followed by oxidation with chloranil and then zinc insertion. The 5-Substituted-ZnCP4a, 5,15-disubstituted-ZnCP4b, and non-substituted-ZnCP (ZnCP) were obtained in 28, 6, and 11% yields, respectively. They were purified by silica-gel column chromatography. The porphyrins 4a, 4b and ZnCP were obtained as mixtures of stereo-isomers at the BCOD moieties. The porphyrin 4a was converted to the flexible free-base CP–C60 (f-CP–C60) following a previously reported procedure: reduction of the ester group to give porphyrin 5, coupling with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA)53 to give f-ZnCP–C60, and demetalation by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). As a reference compound, 5-butyl-CP (Bu-CP) was prepared using pentanal (6) instead of aldehyde 3, followed by demetalation as shown in Scheme 1b.

Next, rigidly-linked CP–C60 (r-CP–C60) was prepared. Since the [2 + 2] condensation reaction mentioned above was not successful, a [2 + 1 + 1] condensation reaction was tried for an aryl-type aldehyde, as shown in Scheme 1c. Because of the low solubility of the alkynyl-CP derivatives, a MeBCOD-fused pyrrole was used instead of the BCOD-pyrrole. By acid condensation of α-hydroxymethylpyrrole 8,35 dipyrromethane 9, and 4-bromoalkynyl-benzaldehyde 10,54 5-substituted-MeCP 11a was obtained in a 32% yield. The yields of 5,15-disubstituted porphyrin 11b and non-substituted MeCP (ZnMeCP) were only 5% and trace, respectively. 5-Substituted MeCP11a was a mixture of stereoisomers, but it was used for the following reactions without further purification. MeCP11a reacted with fullerene 12, which was prepared from 4-(trimethylsilylethynyl)acetophenone 1755 in 3 steps (See ESI†), to give the rigid dyad r-ZnCP–C60 in 46% yield. The zinc ion of r-ZnCP–C60 was removed by treatment with TFA to give r-CP–C60 in 88% yield. In a similar manner, a precursor (TMS-MeCP) of the reference compound (TMS-BP) was prepared using p-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzaldehyde 1355 instead of benzaldehyde 10, as shown in Scheme 1d. The characterization of the compounds was done by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization (HR-ESI) mass spectroscopy or HR MALDI spiral-TOF mass spectroscopy.
The results of the thermogravimetric analysis of f-CP–C60 and r-CP–C60 are shown in Fig. S1-1 and S1-3, ESI.† The retro-Diels–Alder reaction of f-CP–C60 started at 120 °C and finished around 160 °C, while that of r-CP–C60 started around 140 °C and finished around 200 °C. The observed weight loss of f-CP–C60 and r-CP–C60 were 7.19 and 13.25%, which coincided with the calculated weight losses of 7.13 and 13.34%, respectively. The zinc complex of r-BP–C60 (r-ZnBP–C60) was also prepared as single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography. The thermogravimetric analysis of r-ZnCP–C60 is shown in Fig. S1-9, ESI.† The observed weight loss (13.70%) in the MALDI spiral-TOF mass spectra of the obtained f-BP–C60, r-BP–C60 and r-ZnBP–C60 were in good agreement with the simulated values (Fig. S1-2, 4, 10, ESI†). The retro-Diels–Alder reaction of the f-CP–C60 occurred at a lower temperature than the rigid ones. After the retro-Diels–Alder reaction, the BP compounds were thermally stable. The solubility of the BP–C60 compounds was not enough for NMR measurement.
The single crystal structure of r-ZnBP–C60 was determined with synchrotron X-ray radiation (Fig. 1, S2, and Table S2, ESI†).56,57 Since the tiny crystals contained many severely disordered solvent molecules, they gave only weak diffractions, especially in the high θ range. The molecule is extended straight and the porphyrin and meso-phenyl planes are perpendicular to each other. The porphyrin plane is slightly ruffled. The intramolecular center-to-center distance (dcc) between the porphyrin and C60 units is about 22 Å and the edge-to-edge distance (dee) is about 14 Å. In a unit cell, two molecules are alternately placed, and the intermolecular distance between the porphyrin and C60 units is less than the van der Waals distance. This structure is suitable for effective charge separation but charge recombination is also expected to be fast. The packing structure is shown in Fig. S2, ESI.† The top and side views suggest that the fullerenes are arranged in line with an edge-to-edge distance of 3.5 Å, which is suitable for electron transport, while the porphyrins only overlap at the edge of the benzene rings.

The absorption and fluorescence spectra of f-BP–C60, r-BP–C60 and their reference compounds (Bu-BP and TMS-BP) are shown in Fig. 2a–d, and the related data are summarized in Table 1. Flexible f-BP–C60 has a Soret band at 436 nm with a shoulder at 428 nm, Q bands at 568, 609, and 667 nm, and a broad absorption from fullerene at 310–350 nm. The absorption peaks are similar to those of the reference Bu-BP except for the peaks of fullerene. The solubility of r-BP–C60 was not enough to obtain the absorption coefficients. Rigid R-BP–C60 has Soret bands at 419 and 434 nm, Q bands at 568, 601, 608 and 664 nm with a shoulder at 615 nm and a broad absorption from fullerene at 310–350 nm. The absorption of the porphyrin moiety is similar to the reference TMS-BP: Soret bands at 418 and 433 nm and Q bands at 567, 603, 608, and 664 nm with a shoulder at 615 nm. Due to the lower symmetry of the electronic structure of the porphyrin moiety with a mono-substituent at the 5-position, the Soret and Q bands of the porphyrins show splitting. The absorption band of f-BP–C60 shows the broadening of porphyrin and fullerene peaks compared to the peaks of r-BP–C60. The broadening of f-BP–C60 might come from the intramolecular interaction between BP and C60.

The fluorescence spectra of Bu-BP and TMS-BP, the reference BPs, showed a relatively high fluorescence intensity at 665–666 nm with fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) of 18.5 and 26.6%, respectively. The Φf values of the dyads, f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60, in CH2Cl2 were 1.0 and 2.5%, respectively. This result suggested that the fullerene moieties effectively intramolecularly quench the fluorescence of porphyrins, even though the dee of r-BP–C60 is 14 Å. The fluorescence lifetimes (τf) of f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 were analyzed in two components: 0.61 ns (96.2%) and 9.38 ns (3.8%) for f-BP–C60 and 1.16 ns (99.4%) and 11.97 ns (0.6%) for r-BP–C60. Those of the reference compounds, Bu-BP and TMS-BP, were analyzed as a single component, 8.74 and 9.91 ns, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S3-1, ESI†). The short lifetimes of f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 are characterized by the intramolecular electron transfer from BP to C60. The fluorescence lifetimes of f-BP–C60 were analyzed in two components on average, although f-BP–C60 could take multiple conformations in solution with a flexible linkage. Intramolecular fluorescence quenching of r-BP–C60 (τf = 1.16 ns) is not so effective as f-BP–C60 (0.61 ns) because of the rigid spacer with dcc = 22 Å.
The absorption spectra of the f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 films are shown in Fig. 2e and S3-2, ESI.† The films of BP–C60 were prepared by spin-coating CP–C60 followed by heating on a hotplate at 200 °C for 20 min. The details of the film preparation are described in the experimental section. The film of f-BP–C60 shows absorption peaks at 427, 628, and 677 nm, while r-BP–C60 shows peaks at 436, 628, and 677 nm. The spectra of the BP–C60 films are broader compared to the spectra in CH2Cl2 because of the π–π stacking of the porphyrins. The Q band peaks of the films are similarly red-shifted for f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 from those in solution, while the Soret band of r-BP–C60 is 9 nm red-shifted compared to the f-BP–C60 film.
The optical band gap (Egap) obtained from the absorption edge is summarized in Table 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies of f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 were estimated by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) of the film in air. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies were estimated from the onset of the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) according to the known empirical equation HOMO = −Eoxonset − 4.8 eV, where Eoxonset is referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium standard. The estimated values are summarized in Table S4, ESI† with the values of the BP and PCBM films. The HOMO and LUMO energies of the f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 films are the same although the structures of the linkages between the porphyrin and fullerene are different.

To evaluate the electrical properties of the dyads, the charge-carrier mobilities of the f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 films were measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique (Fig. S5-1 and Table S5, ESI†). Hole-only devices with the structure of [ITO/MoO3/f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60/MoO3/Al] and electron-only devices with [ITO/ZnO/f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60/LiF/Al] were fabricated. As shown in Table 2, the hole and electron mobilities of the f-BP–C60 film were 2.3 × 10−5 and 4.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while those of the r-BP–C60 film were 6.8 × 10−5 and 5.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole and electron mobilities in the f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 films were roughly balanced, respectively, and seemed to be suitable for the BHJ layer. The hole mobility of r-BP–C60 is three times larger than that of the f-BP–C60 film, while their electron mobilities are almost the same.
To evaluate the OPV performances of the BHJ-type devices with a [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60/Ca/Al] structure, the f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60 active layer was prepared by spin-coating a f-CP–C60 or r-CP–C60 solution followed by heating at 200 °C for 20 min. The details of the device performance are summarized in Fig. S6, ESI† and Experimental. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in Fig. 3, and the OPV performances are summarized in Table 3. The performance of the previously reported Bu-BP–C60 was also studied to investigate the influence of additional butyl groups at the meso-position.35 With the removal of the butyl group from Bu-BP–C60 to f-BP–C60, the JSC of the BHJ device was improved from JSC = 1.60 mA cm−2 to 1.82 mA cm−2 with an improvement in the series resistance (RS), while VOC and FF did not change (Table 3 and S6, ESI†). The PCE was almost the same for f-BP–C60 and Bu-BP–C60 at 0.23 and 0.26%, respectively. This result suggests the butyl group at the meso-position has little influence on the OPV performance. With the rigid linker, r-BP–C60 showed a better JSC and VOC, which improved the PCE to 0.38%. These results are in good agreement with the SCLC performance, where the r-BP–C60 film has a better carrier mobility than the f-BP–C60 film.

The microscopic surface morphology of the films was investigated by tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4a and b. Both of the f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60 films showed relatively smooth surfaces with root-mean square (RMS) roughnesses of 0.41 and 0.81 nm. The crystallinity of the films was examined by out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, but no signal peaks were observed (Fig. S5-2, ESI†), which suggested that the films are amorphous. The annealing temperature changed from 160 to 220 °C, but the results were the same. Although the r-BP–C60 film has a better carrier mobility than the f-BP–C60 film, we could not find the apparent difference in the film morphology of these films.

Layered film of (c) f-BP–C60 and (d) r-BP–C60 on BP-layer. RMS values are 0.41, 0.81, 4.48 and 7.75 nm, respectively. The scale bars correspond to 1 μm. 
Next the p–i–n devices were prepared by sequential fabrication of the BP-, BP–C60- and PCBM-layers as the p-, i-, and n-layers, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†). The J–V curves and EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 3, and the data are summarized in Table 3 with those of the p–n device using BP and PCBM as a reference. The optimization of the film thickness of i-layers is summarized in Tables 4 and 5, while the p-layer and n-layer were fixed to 23 and 45 nm, respectively.37 With f-BP–C60 for the i-layer, the film thickness of the i-layer changed from 46 to 30 nm, and the best PCE performance of the p–i–n device was obtained as JSC = 5.27 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 V, FF = 0.63 and PCE = 2.00% at a 35 nm thickness. The performance is comparable to that of Bu-BP–C60, and the removal of the butyl group on the meso-position of the BP did not affect the PCE performance of the p–i–n device. For the p–i–n device using r-BP–C60, JSC and FF did not improve from the BHJ device, and the best PCE was only 0.67% at a 46 nm i-layer thickness. It is interesting that the PCE performance of the BHJ device for r-BP–C60 is better, while that of the p–i–n device was worse than f-BP–C60. The OPV performance of p–i–n with f-BP–C60 for the i-layer was only slightly improved from the p–n device of BP and PCBM.

To investigate the morphology of the i-layer, AFM images of i-layers on the p-layer (BP film) were measured. The AFM of BP film is shown in Fig. S5-3, ESI.†37 The RMS roughness is relatively high at 12.4 nm because of the high crystallinity of BP. The RMS roughness of the f-BP–C60 films on a BP layer is 4.88 nm, while the RMS of r-BP–C60 on BP layer is 7.75 nm (Fig. 4c and d). The flexible f-BP–C60 can level and smooth the rough p-layer surface, but the rigid r-BP–C60 could not offset the roughness of the lower layer. The surface of the n-layers on the i-layers shows similar AFM images for the three devices, and the RMS roughness of the PCBM layers on the f-BP–C60, and r-BP–C60 layers are 1.73 and 1.08 nm, respectively (Fig. S5-3, ESI†). The similarity of the roughness of the two systems seems to come from the amorphous property of PCBM. Thus, the rigid r-BP–C60 layer on the BP layer does not have a good interface morphology, and the f-BP–C60 can even out the surface of the p-layer because of the flexibility. Since the r-BP–C60 is rigid and could not smooth the roughness of the p-layer, as shown in the AFM image, the rigid structure might have a worse effect on carrier injection between the p-layer and i-layer. Since the mobility of the r-BP–C60 film is higher than that of the f-BP–C60, the combination with a smooth p-layer might improve the performance. The p–n device of BP and PCBM showed a relatively high performance, which was almost comparable to the p–i–n structure with f-BP–C60. This is because the rough surface of BP was covered with amorphous PCBM, and a pseudo-p–i–n structure was constructed in a p–n device.24
Conclusions
We established a synthetic method for 5-subsituted BPs in moderate yields and prepared mono-substituted BP–C60 compounds connected by flexible and rigid linkers: f-BP–C60 and r-BP–C60. The fluorescence of BP was quenched more efficiently in f-BP–C60 than in r-BP–C60 in CH2Cl2 because of the intramolecular through-space approach of C60 to BP by the flexible spacer. In the film, r-BP–C60 showed higher hole and electron carrier mobilities than f-BP–C60. The well-balanced carrier mobility of the r-BP–C60 film resulted in a twice better performance of the BHJ-type OPV than the f-BP–C60. However, when the molecules were used for i-layers in p–i–n devices, the trend was reversed. The OPV performance of the p–i–n device with f-BP–C60 in the i-layer was 2.0%, while that with r-BP–C60 was 0.67%. The flexible structure of the f-BP–C60 smoothed the rough surface of the p-layer and kept the good FF of the p–n device even in the p–i–n device. On the other hand, the FF of the p–i–n with r-BP–C60 was depressed to 0.32. The rigid and long molecule might not be suitable to smooth the surface of a high-roughness p-layer.
As mentioned above, the interface of the p–n device with BP and PCBM is rough, and it will be an intrinsically pseudo p–i–n structure with a crystalline BP-layer and amorphous PCBM-layer. To improve the p–n device of BP and PCBM by p–i–n structure using the BP–C60 dyad for the i-layer, p- and n-materials in the i-layer should be well-mixed, and the interface area of the p- and n-materials has to be spread for the effective charge separation. This result suggests that the proper crystallinity gives better carrier mobilities, but at the same time, a smooth interface between each layer is required. For better charge separation, a short face-to-edge distance between BP and C60 is necessary while for better charge transport, an appropriate rigidity, but not expanded shape, might be desirable. Considering these points, the linkers to keep C60 on the BP plane might be suitable. Synthesis of the next-generation donor–acceptor compounds is ongoing.
Experimental
Synthesis and structural characterization of the compounds

General. 
Anhydrous THF (Super Plus grade, stabilizer free) and CH2Cl2 (Super grade) were obtained from Kanto Chemical and used as received. All other solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade, were obtained commercially and were used without further purification. Room temperature, or r.t., means 20–25 °C. Material purifications were performed by column chromatography on Silica Gel 60N (Kanto Chemical Co.), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was conducted with a JAI LC-9225NEXT (JAIGEL-2H-40/JAIGEL-1H-40) at room temperature using CHCl3 as an eluent. 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a JNM-ECX400 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane or solvent as an internal standard. ESI and MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured on a JEOL JMS-T100LC AccuTOF spectrometer and JEOL spiral TOF JMS-S3000 spectrometer, respectively.


Thermal reaction profiles. 
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Seiko Exstar 6000 TG/DTA 6200 instrument under a nitrogen gas flow with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Materials converted by heating (200 °C, 10 min) were investigated by MALDI-TOF mass spectra measured on a JEOL spiral TOF JMS-S3000 spectrometer.


X-ray crystal structure. 
Single-crystal diffraction analysis data collection was carried out at a low temperature (90 K) on a Rigaku Saturn 724 diffractometer using synchrotron radiation and a large cylindrical imaging plate camera at the SPring-8 beam line BL40XU (Hyogo, Japan), (proposal No. 2015A1388).


Optical properties. 
UV-vis spectra were obtained on a JASCO UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer V-570. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-6600 in the range of 300–800 nm. For spectral measurements in solution, spectral grade CH2Cl2 was purchased from Nacalai tesque Inc.
Fluorescence quantum yields were measured on an Absolute PL Quantum Yield Measurement System C9920-02. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured on a C4780 picosecond fluorescence lifetime measurement device (Hamamatsu Photonics). A Mira Model 900-F & Pulse Switch femtosecond pulse laser was used, and the excitation light wavelength was 405 nm from a coherent Verdi V-5 Nd:YVO4 laser.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). 
CV measurements were conducted in a solution of 0.1 M TBAPF6 in dry benzonitrile with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature in an argon-filled cell. A glassy carbon electrode and a Pt wire were used as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. An Ag/Ag+ electrode was used as a reference electrode, which was normalized to the half-wave potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium+ (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The DPV measurements were performed under the same conditions as the CV measurements. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were determined from the onset oxidation potential (HOMO = −(4.8 + Eonsetox)) and reduction potential (LUMO = −(4.8 + Eredonset)), where the reference electrode (vs. Fc/Fc+) relative to the vacuum was 4.8 eV.

Characterization of film properties

Film preparation. 
The typical films of f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60 were prepared on clean ITO/glass substrates. The spin coating of a 10 mg mL−1 solution of f-CP–C60 or r-CP–C60 in chloroform at 1000 rpm for 30 s followed by heating at 200 °C for 20 min gave f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60 films. The spin coating and heating were done in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The absorption spectra of f-CP–C60 and r-CP–C60 are summarized in Fig. S3-2.†


Film thickness. 
Film thickness was measured by a Surface Profiler ET200 (Kosaka Laboratory Ltd). The value was obtained as an average of 10 measurement points.


Estimation of energy level. 
The ionization potential of the films was measured by a Riken photoelectron spectroscopy instrument, AC-3. The obtained ionization energies (Fig. S4-1†) were used to approximate the HOMO levels of the materials in the thin-film state.


Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement. 
The surface morphology of organic films was observed by a SPA400, SPI3800N AFM (Seiko instruments Inc.) in tapping mode using silicon probes with a resonant frequency of ∼138 kHz and a force constant of 16 N m−1.


X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. 
The bulk structure of the thin-films was evaluated by out-of-plane XRD measurements using a RINT-TTRIII/NM diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). The sample films were prepared as described above on clean ITO glass without PEDOT:PSS.


Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurement. 
Charge-carrier mobilities in f-BP–C60, r-BP–C60 and Bu-BP–C60 films were evaluated by the SCLC method using an Agilent HP4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The SCLC device structures for hole-only and electron-only measurements were ITO/MoO3/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al, respectively. Each active layer was prepared by spin coating of f-CP–C60, r-CP–C60 and Bu-CP–C60 in chloroform (14 mg mL−1) at 800 rpm for 30 seconds on ITO/MoO3 (15 nm) or ITO/ZnO (28 nm), respectively. After spin coating, these films were heated in the same condition for the OPV device fabrication to convert to f-BP–C60, r-BP–C60 and Bu-BP–C60 in the nitrogen-filled glove box. After preparation of the organic layers, MoO3 (15 nm)/Al (50 nm) and LiF (1 nm)/Al (50 nm) were vapor deposited at high vacuum (<5.0 × 10−4 Pa).

OPV device fabrication and photovoltaic performance

Device fabrication. 
Indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-patterned glass substrates (20.0 × 25.0 mm, 15 Ω per square) were washed with running water and were ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, pure-water and isopropanol for 10 min each. After the substrates were dried, (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP AI4083) was spin coated (3000 rpm, 30 s) in air followed by a thermal annealing treatment at 130 °C for 10 min in air. The thickness of the resulting PEDOT:PSS layer was about 30 nm. The substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box (<10.0 ppm O2 and H2O). The deposition process of the organic active layers is illustrated in Fig. S1.† The active layers for the BHJ device were deposited by spin coating a chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1, 1500 rpm, 30 s) of f-CP–C60 or r-CP–C60 followed by heating (180 °C, 20 min) for in situ conversion to f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60. To fabricate the p–i–n device, the p-layer was prepared by spin coating a chloroform solution (7 mg mL−1, 2500 rpm, 30 s) of CP followed by heating (200 °C, 20 min) to effect the in situ conversion of CP to BP. The film thickness was about 23 nm. The most effective i-layers were deposited by spin coating (1500 rpm, 30 s) a chloroform solution of f-CP–C60 (7 mg mL−1) or r-CP–C60 (10 mg mL−1) followed by heating (200 °C, 20 min) to effect the in situ conversion to f-BP–C60 or r-BP–C60, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. The n-layer was prepared by spin coating a chloroform solution of PC61BM (7 mg mL−1, 1500 rpm, 30 s), which was then annealed (195 °C, 20 min). The film thickness was about 45 nm. After preparation of the organic layers, the buffer layer (Ca, 5 nm) and counter electrode (Al, 50 nm) were vapor deposited at a high vacuum (<5.0 × 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask with a defined active area of 4 mm2.


OPV performances. 
Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2611B SYSTEM Source Mater unit under AM1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using a solar simulator (Bunko-keiki, CEP-2000RP). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained under illumination of monochromatic light using the same system.
