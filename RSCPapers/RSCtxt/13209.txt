    , Accepted 6th April 2016First published on 11th April 2016AbstractWe report the electron transport and hole-blocking properties of ytterbium, which make it suitable for use as the cathode interlayer for the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction in organic photodetectors (OPDs). The final device structure consisting of ITO/NiOx/P3HT:PC60BM/Yb/Al is compared to devices with Ca as the cathode interlayer and without a cathode interlayer. The performance of OPDs is analyzed, and effective carrier extraction and hole blocking are confirmed through the dynamic characteristics of the devices. The use of a Yb layer in the OPDs improves the resistance, thereby improving the carrier extraction and decreasing the leakage current significantly. A figure of merit for the dynamic characteristics, namely the bandwidth of Yb, is improved owing to the fast response time. The bandwidth exceeds 100 kHz at a relatively low light intensity. Optical–electrical measurements are performed, and J–V characteristics, impedance, and dynamic characteristics are analyzed. We investigate the effects of the Yb layer on the performance of the OPDs, focusing on its carrier extraction, leakage current, and resistance components.
Introduction
Photodetectors are used in a wide variety of applications for converting light into electrical signals.1 Inorganic silicon-based photodetectors have several advantages such as a high photoelectric conversion efficiency and high detectivity. However, in general, the low visible-wavelength sensitivity of inorganic photodetectors makes them susceptible to noise due to the absorption of infrared wavelengths.2,3 Many studies have been conducted on polymer-based photodetectors. Given their advantages such as flexibility, a high sensitivity, and low-cost fabrication, these devices are promising alternatives to inorganic photodetectors. Currently, organic photodetectors are used in polymer-fullerene blend systems such as poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices because of their relatively good photoelectric conversion properties. Although BHJ devices exhibit good properties for photoelectric conversion, the devices perform poorly owing to the low mobility of the charge carriers, the high leakage current, and the low stability in air.4,5 In order to improve the performance of the devices, a hole/electron transport layer is inserted between the active layer and the electrodes. Additionally, transport layers improve the parallel and series resistances, which also influence the device performance.6–10
In organic electronic devices, metal oxides (or fluorides), organic materials, and metals have been used as the anode/cathode interlayers.11–18 In particular, the leakage current in organic photodetectors (OPDs) is improved by transporting holes and blocking electrons using an anode interlayer with a high work function and by transporting electrons and blocking holes using a cathode interlayer with a low work function.19,20 Some materials with a low work function have been used as effective cathode interlayers. To date, studies have been conducted to improve the performance of organic electronic devices using low-work-function materials such as Ca, Mg, and Li.21–23 Such low-work-function metals are used to form an ohmic contact between the active layer and the electrode, thereby improving the extraction of carriers.19,24 Although most metals used as cathode interlayers of organic electronic devices are not stable under ambient conditions, Yb exhibits outstanding stability and carrier mobility.25 Yb has been used in organic light-emitting diodes to form the electron injection layer, resulting in effective electron injection.25,26 Additionally, in a previous work, the properties of the Yb layer were demonstrated in organic photovoltaic cells with an inverted structure and can be expected to improve the detectivity, leakage current, and responsivity in OPDs.27
In this work, we demonstrate the performance of OPDs developed with a Yb cathode interlayer. The OPDs are based on a P3HT:PCBM BHJ, in which a Yb layer capped by Al is inserted. The performance of the OPDs is compared with devices with a Ca (2 nm)/Al cathode interlayer and without a cathode interlayer. To measure the response speed of our devices, we used light from a pulsed laser diode and measured the rise and fall times of the photocurrent using an oscilloscope. Moreover, the resistance components were closely measured by impedance spectroscopy under dark and light conditions. The insertion of the Yb layer improved the resistance components, resulting in a reduced leakage current and fast responsivity. Other performance factors such as the detectivity and bandwidth also indicated that the OPD with the Yb layer compares well with Si and InGaAs photodetectors. The performance of OPDs with a Yb layer is discussed herein, with a particular focus on the dynamic range, detectivity, and leakage current.
Experiment
Reagents and materials
Regioregular P3HT and PC60BM were purchased from Nano-C Co., Ltd. Ni, Yb, and Ca were purchased from iTASCO Co., Ltd. The other chemicals used were of reagent grade.
Fabrication of photodetectors
Photodetectors were fabricated with the following structure: ITO/NiO/P3HT:PCBM/cathode interlayer/Al. Three types of sample devices were fabricated: OPDs with a Ca cathode interlayer, those with a Yb cathode interlayer, and those without a cathode interlayer. The HTL is chosen from the J–V characteristics of devices with different HTL materials: PEDOT:PSS, NiOX, and no HTL (see Fig. S1 & Table S1, ESI†).
OPD cells consisting of ITO/NiOx/P3HT:PCBM/cathode interlayer/Al were fabricated with an active surface area of 0.04 cm2. Before the deposition of each layer, a patterned ITO (≤ 20 Ω □−1) glass substrate was immersed in an ultrasonic bath of deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for a duration of 15 min for each solvent. The cleaned ITO glass substrate was dried at 80 °C for 60 min in a vacuum oven. After a UV-ozone treatment for 15 min, Ni layers were thermally evaporated in high vacuum at 10−6 Torr onto ITO films on glass substrates. For oxidation of the Ni layers, these samples were oxidized by heat treatment at 400 °C for 3 h.28 The samples were transferred into a glove box, where a solution of P3HT and PCBM (1:1 ratio) in dichlorobenzene was spin-cast onto the NiOx layer. Finally, Ca or Yb (2 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited by using a thermal evaporation technique at 10−6 Torr.
Device characterization
Current–voltage measurements were performed under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination (at 100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Newport 69920, Newport Co., Ltd, USA) with a color filter (450 nm, 525 nm, 625 nm). Impedance spectra were obtained using IVUMSTATE (Spectra Pro 300i, Acton Research Co., Ltd, USA). The work function was measured using an ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd, USA). Dynamic-range characteristics were obtained using a photoresponse measurement system (TNE Tech Co., Ltd).
Results and discussion
OPD structure and material properties

Fig. 1(a) shows the structure of the OPD consisting of a P3HT:PC60BM layer sandwiched between the NiOX anode layer and the Yb cathode interlayer. The energy band diagram for the OPD is shown in Fig. 1(b). NiOX, which has a wide band gap, is commonly used to enhance carrier transport and electron blocking.4,29 In this structure, we found the effective work function of Yb through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (see Fig. S2 & Fig. S3(a) and (b), ESI†), which indicated that Yb formed lower than Ca. The use of the Yb layer ensures that charge carrier injection from the electrodes is effectively prevented.30,31

The current–voltage characteristics shown in Fig. 1(a) are in accordance with the transport properties of the three types of samples under dark conditions. The dark current density (Jdark) of the device with the Yb layer was 1.13 × 10−7 A cm−2 at −3 V and decreased to 1.25 × 10−9 A cm−2 at 0 V. In terms of the operating voltage of the OPD, the use of the Yb layer resulted in a mostly stable device that operates under a reverse applied field. At a low reverse voltage, the dark current density of the OPD with the Yb layer is also reduced by approximately an order of magnitude compared to that of the Ca layer (see Table S2, ESI†). This result suggests that the use of Yb with a low work function significantly prevents the injection of holes because the energy barrier is higher than that of the Ca/Al interface.30–32 For the device without any cathode interlayer, the higher dark current than that of the devices with cathode interlayers can be attributed to the leakage current because of the formation of defect centers by the deposition of Al onto the organic surface.4 These defect centers are indicated in the organic surface as damage, causing a high series resistance and/or low shunt resistance.20,27Fig. 2(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE), i.e., the spectral response of each device under illuminated conditions. The device with the Yb layer exhibited an EQE of 53.39%, whereas the device with Ca exhibited an EQE of 51.68% at 525 nm. With regard to the OPDs, the deviation is less than the difference between the EQE values at 525 nm, as summarized in Table 1. Additionally, we measured the J–V characteristics in the red (625 nm), green (525 nm), and blue (450 nm) regions to observe the photocurrents, resulting in a corresponding tendency of the EQE value (see Fig. S4(a)–(d), ESI†).

As shown in the UPS analysis, we found that the energy level in the OPD is effectively formed by the Yb layer, implying that Yb exhibited better hole blocking and electron transporting properties with P3HT:PC60BM than the Ca layer.33,34 With respect to cathode interlayer properties, we supposed that Yb was suitable for forming a thin layer between P3HT:PC60BM and Al because of the lower optimum thickness compared to the Ca layer.27,34,35
The EQE and the responsivity (R) are used to determine the sensitivity of a photodetector. The responsivity is defined as the rate of conversion from photons to electrons/holes [see Fig. S5, ESI†]. Herein, R is calculated using the ratio of the photocurrent to the intensity of the incident light: (1)where q is the electron charge, λ is the wavelength, ℏ is the Planck constant, c is the light velocity, Iph is the photocurrent, and Llight is the incident light intensity. The responsivity corresponds to the tendency of the EQE, and the device with the Yb layer has a responsivity of 0.253 A W−1 at 525 nm. The broad spectral responsivity of these photodetectors makes them useful in multispectral applications.36 As a figure of merit, the responsivity is related to the noise equivalent power (NEP, in W/Hz1/2) and detectivity. The NEP is defined as the incident optical power, in which the signal and noise are quantified equally. It means that the photodetector can detect the minimum level of the optical power. The NEP was calculated using the following expression: (2)where Jdark is the dark current density, Δf is the bandwidth (Hz), and IN is the total noise current. The reciprocal of the NEP is referred to as the detectivity of the device. The specific detectivity (D*) is an area-independent figure of merit that indicates the ability of an OPD to detect lower levels of incident power. D* was calculated using the following expression: (3)where A is the effective area of the detector, and IN is the total noise current also expressed as the shot noise (2qJdark, the shot noise power spectral density). In this equation, the dark currents are assumed to significantly contribute to the noise current of the photodetector. Thus, the dark current density is closely related to the detectivity, which plays a key role in determining the overall performance of OPDs. Table 1 summarizes the higher detectivity of the OPD with the Yb layer due to the reduced dark current density, and this can be attributed to the decrease in the series resistance and the increase in the shunt resistance caused by the Yb layer. The details of the resistance components of the device are provided in the section titled “Impedance analysis.”
Dynamic characteristics
To analyze the response time of the dynamic characteristics, we measured their temporal response. The rise time is dependent on the incident light intensity and indicates that the response speed of the photodetector is limited owing to the carrier transport in the device stack. To measure the speeds of our devices, we used a pulsed laser diode as the light source and measured the rise and fall times of the photocurrent on an oscilloscope.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), we show the response time for a few microseconds, which is defined as the characteristic time constant. The response time can be expressed from the rise time versus resistance characteristics13,37 as follows: Δtr = τ = CR(4)where τ is the total delay time of the element, R is the resistance component, and C is the capacitance of the device. We measured the time taken to reach the highest point (90%) from the lowest point (10%) and calculated the rise time (Δtr). The response time for the device with the Yb layer is 1.57 μs, which is higher than that of the device with the Ca layer (1.95 μs) and the device without the layer (2.25 μs) at −1 V. The shape of the response time is based on the resistances and capacitance, which influence the rise time. In other words, the use of the cathode interlayer results in a greater resistance and capacitance than those for the device without the cathode interlayer. Additionally, the cathode interlayer improves the surface uniformity on P3HT:PC60BM BHJ, which is attributed to the low contact resistance.20,35,36 We showed that the resistance and capacitance of the OPDs can be analyzed through an impedance measurement, as discussed later in the “Impedance analysis” section.

To evaluate the figure of merit for the dynamic characteristics, we show the cut-off frequency in Fig. 3(b). Typically, the bandwidth required for a commercial level is 100 kHz, and the minimum required bandwidth for video applications is 30 kHz.37,38 This bandwidth characteristic is calculated using the time constants, which are related to the response time. The bandwidth was calculated using Δf = 1/(2πτ),(5)where Δf is the bandwidth in hertz and τ is the characteristic time constant of the device. The bandwidth at −1 V of the device with the Yb layer has a frequency response at 173.15 kHz, which is higher than those of devices with the Ca layer (135.04 kHz) and without the layer (82.19 kHz). This result implies that photo-generated carriers effectively reach each electrode without accumulation or recombination, resulting in a faster photoresponse and a sharp increase in the bandwidth compared to other OPDs. In particular, in terms of performance, the difference in the bandwidth is verified through an impedance analysis.
Impedance analysis
To analyze the resistance components and capacitance, the impedance characteristics of OPDs were measured through impedance spectroscopy under dark and illuminated conditions. In the impedance analysis, the OPDs with Ca and Yb cathode layers exhibited similar results because the deviation is less than the difference in performance. Therefore, we show two devices under dark and illuminated conditions in Fig. 4(a) and (b).
 Fig. 4  Impedance spectra measured (a) in the dark and (b) under illuminated conditions using a monochromator at 525 nm of 1 mW cm−2 at −1 V. The inset shows the equivalent circuit used to model the impedance. 
From the fitted values of each element in the equivalent model, Table 2 lists the parameters of resistance and capacitance. In Fig. 4(a), this resistance indicates the parallel resistance of the device, which is related to the dynamic characteristics of the device. The maximum resistance of the device under dark conditions is 1.26 × 106 Ω for the device with the Yb layer and is greater than 9.57 × 105 Ω for the device with the Ca layer. These results imply that the properties of Yb and Ca cathode interlayers are different with regard to the carrier mobility and leakage current.13,36 The use of the Yb layer means that the OPD is attributed to the reduction in the leakage current by the reverse saturation current. Additionally, the dark current was mainly reduced by the blocking effect of Yb as a cathode layer, and it accounts for the effective prevention of carrier injection, as shown by the J–V characteristics under dark conditions (see Fig. 2(a)). The OPD with optoelectronics conversion is also affected by the resistance under illuminated conditions. In Fig. 4(b), the devices indicate that the maximum resistance under illuminated conditions is 8.24 × 104 Ω for the Yb layer, which is lower than 1.46 × 105 Ω for the Ca layer. Under illuminated conditions, this device resistance is related to the series resistance, and it changes depending on the active material and interfacial barrier. From this result, the difference in the resistance can be attributed to the fact that the use of Yb improves the surface uniformity on the organic surface as well as the low contact resistance between the active layer and the electrode.37

The capacitance (C) is an important property regarding the bandwidth and response of the OPD. In terms of an RC circuit, the capacitance affected the function of time through the final point in response to the incident light from the initial point. Eqn (4) implies that a low capacitance results in a wider bandwidth and faster response in the device. In terms of the dynamic characteristics of the OPDs, it is important that the capacitance under dark or illumination conditions remained unchanged. This characteristic means that photo-generated carriers reach each electrode without accumulation or recombination, meaning that the performance of the OPD with the Yb layer is improved owing to its lower capacitance than the OPD with the Ca layer37–39 (see Table 2). In other words, the different capacitances between the two devices can be inferred, which causes the electrical contacts and energy levels of the trap states in the interfaces between the active layers and the cathode interlayers.
The figure of merit for the dynamic characteristics in the OPD is affected by improved resistance and low capacitance. In particular, the low capacitance is an important property that can have a profound effect on the bandwidth and response time of the photodetector. The resistances and capacitances of the OPDs are listed Table 2.
Linear dynamic range
To closely observe the response properties, we measured the OPDs with a variety of light intensities, as shown in Fig. 5(a). From the linear dynamic range (LDR) measurements shown in Fig. 5(a), it is clear that the use of Yb results in an improvement in the electron transport properties. The deviation in the slope for the OPD with the Yb layer was 0.991 ± 0.002 and implies effective electron transport properties such as a low density of electron traps and considerable free electron generation.8,29,40 The LDR for the OPD with the Yb layer was 68.70 dB, which is comparable to the LDR of an InGaAs photodetector (66 dB).

Stability under ambient conditions
OPDs with Ca and Yb cathode interlayers were tested to verify their stability in air after 7 days. In order to observe the rapid change, the devices were fabricated without encapsulation. Over 7 days, the devices were stored in the laboratory under ambient conditions at room temperature.
After the first day, the photocurrent densities of the devices immediately decreased owing to the readily oxidized electrodes, and the dark current density increased, as shown in Fig. 5(b).27 However, the use of Yb as the cathode interlayer of the OPD results in a relatively stable current density from 2 to 7 days, which is an improvement compared to the OPD with the Ca layer. Organic electronic devices with a Ca layer as the cathode interlayer have been reported to be relatively stable, but the use of Yb indicates an improved stability in air. In the two materials, the difference in the air stability is due to the inherent characteristics for oxidization and a well covering organic surface. An analysis of the reasons for this improvement in stability is still being carried out.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated the properties of Yb as the cathode interlayer of an OPD based on P3HT:PC60BM. The use of the Yb layer reduces the dark current density by more than one order of magnitude and increases the EQE by improving carrier extraction. The EQE of the devices with Yb is 53.39% at 525 nm and is higher than that of the device with the Ca layer over the entire visible wavelength range. This is due to the effective ohmic characteristics of the Yb layer, which influence the responsivity. The detectivity increased by more than one order of magnitude compared to those of the OPDs with the Ca layer and no layer. The performance of the devices with the Yb layer in terms of the detectivity is 2.15 × 1012. The device has an impressive cut-off frequency of 173.15 kHz at −1 V despite a relatively lower light intensity. The bandwidth greater than 100 kHz is comparable with the bandwidth of inorganic photodetectors based on Si2 and Ge,41,42 implying that the OPD can be effectively applied to devices such as image sensors and video applications. Yb as the cathode interlayer in the OPD is a potential material that easily approaches a similar mechanism of metallic materials with a low work function, suggesting that this type of organic electronic device is improved with respect to the leakage current, resistance components, and performance.
