    , Accepted 17th August 2014First published on 18th August 2014AbstractThree double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers (D1, D2, and D3) with octyloxy bridge linked at different positions of the π-bridge in the D–π–A branch have been designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were further investigated. Compared with the reference dye isomers containing single D–π–A branches, the double D–π–A branched dye isomers consisting of two separated light-harvesting moieties in one molecule are beneficial to photocurrent generation. Moreover, the cross structure of the double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers is superior to the rod structure of the dye isomers with single D–π–A branches in the suppression of intermolecular interactions, which results in reduced charge recombination rates in the DSSCs based on double branched organic dye isomers. Therefore, in comparison to the DSSCs based on isomeric dyes with single D–π–A branches, the DSSCs based on double branched organic dye isomers display both improved short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage. Furthermore, similar to the single D–π–A branched organic dye isomers, those isomeric dyes with double D–π–A branches exhibit slightly different photophysical properties, which result in the varied photovoltaic performance. The highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% and 6.9%, respectively, is achieved for isomer D1 based DSSC with liquid and quasi-solid-state electrolyte under simulated AM1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention in the last two decades since the breakthrough by Grätzel and co-workers.1 The key component of this solar cell is a photoanode which consists of a mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 film covered by a monolayer of photosensitizing dye. Absorption of sunlight by the sensitizer creates a high energy state that can inject the photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. The oxidized dye is subsequently reduced back to the ground state by a redox system. Up to date, DSSC devices employing the zinc-porphyrin dye system have shown an efficiency record of 12.3% under the standard global air mass 1.5.2 However, in view of the cost and limited availability, alternative metal-free organic sensitizers3 have also attracted considerable attention for practical applications owing to their unique advantages, such as facile structure tuning, high molar extinction coefficients, a variety of optoelectronic properties, and environmental friendliness. Recently, the performance of organic dye based DSSCs has been remarkably improved and impressive efficiencies over 11% have been achieved.4
Most of the efficient organic sensitizers have donor-π bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) structures. Despite the promising results obtained so far, many metal-free organic dyes with a rod-like configuration may cause undesirable dye aggregation and charge recombination. The close π–π stacking of dye molecules can lead to self-quenching of excited states and hence insufficient electron injection. Therefore, the suppression of dye aggregation is of vital importance for minimizing the charge recombination and achieving photovoltage improvements. To control the π-stacked aggregation of organic dye molecules and related charge recombination processes, several kinds of additives, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA),5 have been physically introduced to coadsorb onto the semiconductor surface to prevent the intermolecular interactions. An alternative strategy to solve this problem is the chemical incorporation of long alkyl chains into the organic dye skeleton, which may suppress the molecular aggregation and thus improve the DSSC performance.6 Recently, the construction of double D–π–A branched organic dyes has been proven as an effective strategy to reduce intermolecular interactions, retard the charge recombination rate, and therefore enhance the Voc parameter.7 Recently, Fungo et al. have developed a double D–π–A branched sensitizer bridged by a spirofluorene with two anchoring groups separated by a distance of 10.05 Å.8 Wang et al. have investigated a series of organic sensitizers containing symmetric and asymmetric double D–π–A branches connected by flexible chains of different lengths.9 We have also reported on organic sensitizers conjugated with a spacer bridging double D–π–A or D–π–A–π–A branches.10
In this study, three simple double D–π–A branched sensitizer isomers (D1, D2 and D3, Fig. 1) with a bridge substituted at different positions are designed and synthesized. According to a previously reported research work, octyl group was sufficient to weaken the intermolecular interactions among the organic dye molecules. Therefore, an octyloxy bridge is utilized to link the two D–π–A branches. To verify the isomeric structures and fully compare the different behavior between single and double D–π–A branched organic dyes, the corresponding single D–π–A branched organic dyes (S1 and S2, Fig. 1) are also synthesized. According to our previous study,11 when alkyl groups were substituted at different positions of the π-conjugated spacer for the organic dye isomers, the related photophysical and photovoltaic properties were significantly varied. Herein, for both single and double D–π–A branched organic dyes, slightly different photophysical properties can be observed for the related dye isomers, which result in their varied photovoltaic performance. Most importantly, in comparison with the single D–π–A branched organic dye isomers with rod-shape, the double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers possess a crossed chemical structure, which is favorable for minimizing the intermolecular interaction and reducing the charge recombination in the DSSC. Therefore, the DSSCs based on the double D–π–A branched dye isomers exhibit both higher Voc and short-circuit current (Jsc) compared to the DSSCs based on organic dyes with single D–π–A branches. The highest power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.1% and 6.9%, respectively, is achieved for isomer D1 based DSSC with liquid and quasi-solid-state electrolyte.

Experimental section
Materials and reagents
1,8-Dibromooctane and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) were purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd, China. Organic solvents used in this work were purified using the standard process. Other chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. Transparent conductive glass (F-doped SnO2, FTO, 15 Ω smittance of 80%, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) was used as the substrate for the fabrication of TiO2 thin film electrode.
Synthesis of 1,8-bis((2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methoxy)octane (2)
Under argon atmosphere, sodium hydride (0.59 g, 14.7 mmol) and THF (20 mL) were placed in a 100 mL three-necked flask. Then 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b]-l,4-dioxin-2-yl methanol (2.53 g, 14.7 mmol) in 20 mL THF solution was added dropwise to the reaction at 0 °C. After stirring for 1 h, 1.99 g (7.3 mmol) of 1,8-dibromooctane was injected via a syringe into the flask. The mixture was heated to reflux and stirred overnight. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, the mixture was extracted twice with dichloromethane (DCM) and the combined organic phase was washed with brine and then concentrated to obtain crude compound 2. Further purification was carried out by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/DCM (v/v = 2/1) as the eluent to obtain pure compound 2 as a white solid, yield 72% (2.39 g). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 6.33 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H, thiophene-2), 6.32 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H, thiophene-5), 4.38–4.18 (m, 4H), 4.05 (dd, J = 11.6, 7.5 Hz, 2H), 3.64 (m, 4H), 3.48 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 4H), 3.40 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 4H), 1.91–1.78 (m, 4H), 1.60–1.55 (m, 4H), 1.41 (m, 4H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 141.79, 99.91, 99.79, 72.86, 72.23, 69.33, 66.46, 34.29, 33.00, 29.70, 29.45, 28.92, 28.32, 26.15.

Under argon atmosphere, compound 2 (0.40 g, 0.88 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.128 g, 1.76 mmol) and DCM (40 mL) were placed in a 100 mL three-necked flask and cooled to 0 °C. After adding POCl3 (0.27 g, 1.76 mmol) via a syringe, the mixture was heated to reflux for 24 h. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched with 10% NaOAc aqueous solution (30 mL). The mixture was extracted twice with DCM and the combined organic phase was washed with brine and then concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with hexane/DCM (v/v = 1/1) as the eluent to remove other by-products. The obtained isomer mixture of compounds 3a, 3b and 3c was directly used for the next step.
Synthesis of compounds 4a, 4b and 4c
The isomer mixture of compounds 3a, 3b and 3c (306 mg, 0.60 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (2.8 mg, 2 mol%, 0.012 mmol), PCy3HBF4 (8.8 mg, 4 mol%, 0.024 mmol), pivalic acid (18.4 mg, 30 mol%, 0.18 mmol) and K2CO3 (209 mg, 1.5 mmol) were placed in a Schlenk tube. The tube was purged with argon and then 4-bromo-N,N-diphenylaniline (505 mg, 2.6 equiv., 1.56 mmol) in 2 mL toluene solution was added. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at 110 °C for 24 h. Then the solution was cooled to room temperature, diluted with DCM, and washed with brine. The organic phases were combined, dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/DCM (v/v = 1/1) as the eluent to produce pure compounds 4a (126 mg), 4b (115 mg) and 4c (96 mg).

Characterizations
UV-vis absorption spectra of dye solutions and dye-loaded films were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2550PC spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. Dye adsorbed TiO2 on conductive glass was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated with ferrocene, and all potentials mentioned in this work are against normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The film thickness was measured by using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150, USA).
DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
TiO2 nanoparticle (20 nm) films (12 μm) in direct contact with the FTO substrate were fabricated using a screen printing method and used in this study. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 2 h to achieve good necking of neighboring TiO2 particles. The sintered films were then treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by calcinations at 450 °C for 30 min. When TiO2 electrodes were cooled down to around 120 °C, the electrodes were dipped in dye solutions (0.3 mM in toluene) for 24 h at room temperature for complete dye adsorption. The dye-loaded TiO2 film as working electrode and the Pt-coated FTO as counter electrode were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and sealed together by pressing them under heat. Redox electrolyte (0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile) was introduced through a hole in the counter electrode via suction through another drilled hole. Finally, the two holes were sealed using an additional hot-melt Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide. Quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.5 M TBP and 0.6 M DMPImI in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heat until all solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell through the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes, and then the holes were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat. A black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was used during measurement to avoid stray light. The working performance of DSSC was tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Oriel) under illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-94043A equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of sensitizers
The straightforward synthetic approaches to the isomeric dyes are depicted in Scheme 1. The synthetic procedure for isomers D1, D2 and D3 started from 2-hydroxymethyl subsituted 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), which was prepared according to a previously reported method.12 Dissolution of sodium hydride in the solution of 2-hydroxymethyl subsituted EDOT in tetrahydrofuran and followed by addition of 1,8-dibromooctane produced the EDOT bisfunctionalized bridge compound 2 (72%). It should be noted that the resulting compound 2 contains four reactive sites with similar reactivity at the 2,5-positions on the two thiophene rings in the EDOT moieties. Therefore, after refluxing with 2 equiv. of Vilsmeier reagents,13 three isomers (3a, 3b and 3c) containing two aldehyde groups on different thiophene rings were obtained at a ratio of around 1:1:1. The absence of the product with two aldehyde groups on the same thiophene ring is probably due to passivated thiophene ring after introduction of one aldehyde, an electron-withdrawing group. However, since the resulting isomers do not show remarkably different polarity, it is not straightforward to separate the mixture of the three isomers. Interestingly, the incorporation of two triphenylamino groups on the other two reactive sites has brought a significant difference among the product polarities. Herein, the electron donor, 4-bromo-N,N-diphenylaniline, was attached via C–H bond activation reaction14 which has shortened the synthetic procedure by two steps. Otherwise, related bromide and boronic acid reagents have to be prepared before a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction. The separated isomeric compounds 4a, 4b and 4c were verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The 1H NMR spectra of D1 and D3 display only one singlet peak at δ = 9.82 ppm and 9.81 ppm, respectively, assigned to the protons in the two aldehyde groups, which suggests a symmetric chemical structure for the organic dye molecules. While in the 1H NMR spectrum of D2, two singlet peaks at δ = 9.83 and 9.82 ppm indicate that the chemical structure is asymmetric and therefore the signals for the two protons in the aldehyde groups are different. To further specify the two isomers D1 and D3, single branched isomers S1 and S2 are synthesized similar to those of double branched dye isomers (Scheme 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the precursors 7a and 7b exhibit different proton signals in the δ region from 4.7 to 4.0 ppm, which are assigned to the three protons on the dioxane ring of an EDOT unit. The chemical shift of Ha for compound 7a moves to the lower field as compared with that for compound 7b, since Ha is closer to the cyanoacrylic acid, an electron-withdrawing group. Similar phenomena can be also observed for double branched precursors 4a and 4c (Fig. 2). In the last step, the obtained precursors were converted to the corresponding dye isomers by Knoevenagel condensation15 in the presence of cyanoacetic acid and piperidine. All the target compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy, and were found to be consistent with the proposed structures.

Photophysical properties
The photophysical characteristics of the resulting dye isomers were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectra in dilute chloroform solutions and on TiO2 films at room temperature. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three isomeric dyes are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. In chloroform solutions, all the dyes exhibit two distinct absorption bands (Fig. 3a). The absorption band in the high-energy region (<400 nm) corresponds to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated backbone, and the other relatively stronger absorption band in the low-energy region (>400 nm) can be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron donating unit to the electron-withdrawing group. Such an intense ICT band is unlike that exhibited by our previously reported double D–π–A system,10a where the ICT band was much weaker than the other band for π–π* transitions. This is probably due to different bridges linking the two D–π–A branches. In our previously reported dye FNE92, the crossed two branches were linked by a conjugated thiophene bridge. A twisted conjugation structure may affect effective conjugation and ICT interactions. Herein, the two D–π–A branches are connected by a flexible octyloxy chain which has little influence on the electronic structures of the dye molecules. Under the same condition, the three isomers (D1, D2 and D3) exhibit the absorption maximum at 501, 494 and 488 nm, respectively. To explain the absorption difference among these dye isomers, the absorption spectra of the single D–π–A branched dye isomers S1 and S2 were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3a, isomer S1 displays the maximum absorption wavelength at 496 nm, while isomer S2 demonstrates the maximum absorption wavelength at 491 nm with a slight hypsochromic shift of 5 nm. Since the only structural difference between the two isomers is the substituted position of the methoxymethyl group on the EDOT unit, the slight absorption difference has stemmed from the substituted methoxymethyl group at 3- or 4-position of the EDOT unit. As the substituted methoxymethyl group is far away from the conjugation backbone of the dye molecule, the absorption shift is probably due to the changed electron density on the two oxygen atoms in the EDOT unit which is indirectly affected by the introduced methoxymethyl group. Therefore, the hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum from D1 to D2, and further to D3, can be similarly explained and originates from the bridged octyloxy groups attached at different positions on EDOT units, which affect the lone pair electrons of the two oxygen atoms and thus the π-conjugation structure. This speculation is further proved by theoretical calculation as discussed below. To further investigate the different intermolecular interactions, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye solutions at different concentrations were recorded. As shown in Fig. S1–S5,† when the concentration increases from 10−6 M to 10−4 M, no obvious difference can be found for the absorption maxima of double branched dye isomers D1, D2 and D3, while a bathochromic shift of 9 and 6 nm can be observed for the absorption maximum of single branched dye isomers S1 and S2, respectively. These results indicate that the double branched structure has effectively inhibited the interactions among the D–π–A branches.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the organic dye isomers anchored on transparent mesoporous TiO2 films were also measured, as shown in Fig. 3b. Similarly, a slight hypsochromic shift can be observed for double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers from D1 to D2, and further to D3. This is consistent with the absorption spectra in chloroform solutions and originates from their different chemical structures. Moreover, upon adsorption of the organic dye isomers on the surface of the TiO2 films, a significant hypsochromic shift of 74–81 nm with respect to those in solutions can be observed, which is due to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid. Such a hypsochromic shift of the absorption spectra for organic dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films has also been observed in other metal-free organic dyes.16
Dye adsorption
The anchoring properties of the isomeric dyes on the TiO2 films were characterized by measuring the IR spectra of the dye powders and dye-loaded TiO2 films. A stretching band at around 2216 cm−1, assigned to the stretching vibration of CN group,17 can be observed for all the double D–π–A branched dye powders and dye-loaded TiO2 films (Fig. 4). However, the carbonyl peaks at 1681, 1695, and 1683 cm−1 for isomers D1, D2, and D3, respectively, disappeared after anchoring on TiO2 films, while other peaks appeared in the IR spectra (Fig. 4) for the asymmetric (1616, 1614, and 1618 cm−1) and symmetric (1370, 1368, and 1373 cm−1) carboxylate groups.18 These results suggest that all the double D–π–A branched dye isomers were chemically adsorbed onto the TiO2 film via double-anchoring modes. Therefore, according to the Deacon Philips rule19 and a previous similar report,18,20 the dye molecules most likely adsorb onto the TiO2 surface via bidentate bridging binding mode.

Electrochemical properties
To study the possibility of photo-generated electron injection and sensitizer regeneration, CV (Fig. 5) was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell on TiO2 films stained with sensitizer as the working electrode in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of dyes D1, D2, and D3, taken from the first oxidation half-wave potential, are determined to be 1.13, 1.14, and 1.17 V (vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE, the same as below), respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V), indicating that the reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible.21 Correspondingly, calculated from HOMO levels and the optical band gap derived from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film,22 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of dyes D1, D2, and D3 are −1.16, −1.16, and −1.14 V, respectively, indicating the sufficient driving force of electron injection from their excited states to TiO2 films.21 The energy levels of the resulting organic dyes are summarized in Table 1. The similar HOMO/LUMO values of D1, D2, and D3 are not difficult to understand since all the dye isomers have identical electron donors and acceptors except for the octyloxy bridge substituted at different positions on the EDOT unit.

Theoretical approach
To investigate the geometrical structures and electronic properties of the organic dye isomers, density functional calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program by the B3LYP method and 6-31G* basis set.23 To explain the different absorption properties of the related dye isomers, the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) population analysis24 is utilized to compare the charge distribution on the EDOT unit. As shown in Fig. 6, the NBO charge for the two oxygen atoms on the EDOT unit in isomeric dye S1 is −0.540 and −0.492, respectively. However, when the substituted methoxymethyl group is removed from left to right, the NBO charge for the two related oxygen atoms in isomeric dye S2 is calculated to be −0.530 and −0.504, respectively, which is the most significant change for the atom charge when the dye isomer shifts from S1 to S2. These results suggest that when the substituted position of the alkyl group on the EDOT unit changes, the charge distribution on the two oxygen atoms are different, which results in the varied π-conjugation and ICT interactions. Similar effect can be also observed for the double branched dye isomers D1, D2 and D3. This well explains their slightly different absorption behavior (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 6  Calculated atomic charges of references S1 and S2 and frontier molecular orbitals for the dye isomers. 
For the reference dyes S1 and S2 with rigid single branches, the HOMO distributes along the whole conjugated system and the LUMO delocalizes over the cyanoacrylic acid group through the conjugated bridge, facilitating electron transfer from the electron-donating moiety to the electron-withdrawing moiety and further to the CB of TiO2via the carboxylate anchoring group.25 For double branched dye isomers D1, D2 and D3, the two rod-type branches cross perpendicularly, which not only interrupts the interactions between the two intramolecular D–π–A branches but also weakens the intermolecular interactions among the organic dye isomers, which is beneficial to the DSSC performance. Moreover, it can be found that for all the double branched dye isomers, the HOMO and the LUMO delocalize over the same D–π–A branch, while the HOMO−1 and the LUMO+1 delocalize over the other D–π–A branch. Upon excitation by the sunlight, the excited electrons can easily transfer on the two separated branches from the donor to the acceptor and further to TiO2.
Solar cell performance
The DSSCs based on the dye isomers were fabricated using a liquid electrolyte (0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile). Action spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for DSSCs based on the organic dye isomers are shown in Fig. 7. The highest IPCE values are over 80% for all the DSSCs based on double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers, and around 70% for the DSSCs based on single D–π–A branched organic dye isomers. According to the formula, IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × Φinj × Φc,26 where LHE(λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the electron injection efficiency, and Φc is the charge collection efficiency, since all the dye isomers have similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels, the different IPCE values for the two types of organic dyes may have resulted from their different charge injection efficiencies. For single branched dye isomers S1 and S2, the rod-like D–π–A branches tend to pack with each other and therefore self-quench their excited states, which results in the reduced electron injection efficiencies and lower IPCE values as compared with those for double branched dye isomers. Moreover, the IPCE spectrum becomes broader when the dye isomer shifts from D3 to D2 and further to D1, which is in good agreement with their absorption spectra on TiO2 films.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra for the DSSCs based on the dye isomers with liquid electrolyte. 
The photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs based on the dye isomers with liquid electrolyte were evaluated under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G solar light. Fig. 8 demonstrates the J–V curves for the DSSCs and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The DSSC based on isomer S1 produces a η of 5.3% (Jsc = 10.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 705 mV, FF = 0.73), while the isomer S2 based DSSC provides a slightly decreased η of 4.9% (Jsc = 9.69 mA cm−2, Voc = 694 mV, FF = 0.73). However, when the two rigid D–π–A branches are connected, the DSSC device incorporating a double branched dye isomer gives a dramatically improved η of 8.1% for D1 (Jsc = 14.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 755 mV, FF = 0.72), 7.5% for D2 (Jsc = 13.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 756 mV, FF = 0.75), and 6.6% for D3 (Jsc = 12.00 mA cm−2, Voc = 752 mV, FF = 0.73). It can be found that for the DSSCs based on the double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers, both Jsc and Voc values significantly increase as compared with those for the DSSCs based on the dye isomers with single D–π–A branches. Since both single and double branched dye isomer loaded TiO2 films have similar absorbance and energy levels, the different Jsc values are due to their different charge injection efficiencies. The stronger intermolecular interactions among the single branched dye molecules facilitate self-quenching of the excited electrons. While the separated double branches in isomers D1, D2, and D3 have weakened the intermolecular interactions and minimized the current loss from self-quenching. Moreover, the slightly different Jsc values among DSSCs based on dye isomers D1, D2, and D3 have stemmed from their different absorption properties, which is consistent with the IPCE trend as shown in Fig. 7. For the other performance parameter, the higher Voc values for the DSSCs based on the double branched dye isomers can be explained by their different charge recombination rates.

To explain the Voc difference among the DSSCs based on the dye isomers, the electron lifetime27 against charge density28 for the DSSCs was investigated. The electron lifetime was measured by controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)29 and obtained from the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) by the relation τ = (2πfmin)−1. As shown in Fig. 9, the electron lifetime for all the DSSCs decreases with charge density following a power law relation with the same slope, suggesting the same charge recombination mechanism in the DSSCs. Additionally, at a fixed charge density, the electron lifetimes for the DSSC based on isomers D1, D2 and D3 are very similar, while the electron lifetimes for the DSSC based on isomers S1 and S2 are also almost identical. This is not difficult to understand since the two series of dye isomers have very close chemical structures, which result in similar intermolecular interactions and charge recombination rates. However, the electron lifetime for the DSSC based on a double D–π–A branched dye isomer is around 3-fold longer than that for the DSSC based on a single D–π–A branched dye isomer. The cross structures of the double branched dye isomers not only weaken the intermolecular interactions and thus reduce the self-quenching of the excited state, but also block the triiodides approaching the TiO2 surface, resulting in the enhanced electron lifetime at the same charge density. Therefore, a decreased charge recombination rate reduces the electron loss at an open circuit. When more charge is accumulated in TiO2, the Fermi level moves upwards and Voc gets larger, which explains the different Voc values in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 9  Electron lifetime as a function of charge density at an open circuit for the isomeric dye based DSSCs. 
Compared to liquid electrolyte based DSSCs, quasi-solid-state DSSCs30 have also attracted great attention since there is less or no possibility for leakage of the electrolyte and thus they have shown greatly improved long-term stability. Therefore, quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the organic dye isomers were fabricated using a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, 0.6 M DMPImI, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN). The J–V curves for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs are shown in Fig. 10 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. It can be found that the photovoltaic performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the organic dye isomers is consistent with the trend for the DSSCs with liquid electrolyte discussed above. The highest efficiency of 6.9% is also achieved for the isomer D1 based quasi-solid-state DSSC under simulated AM1.5G solar irradiation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized three double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers with octyloxy bridge linked at different positions. Compared to the reference dye isomers with single D–π–A branches, the double D–π–A branched dye isomers consisting of two separated light-harvesting moieties in one molecule are favorable for photocurrent generation. Most importantly, the double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers exhibit a cross structure, which not only interrupts the interactions between the two intramolecular D–π–A branches but also weakens the intermolecular interactions among the organic dye isomers. Consequently, the charge recombination is minimized in the DSSCs based on double branched dye isomers, which results in improved Jsc and Voc values. Interestingly, due to the different substituted positions of the octyloxy bridge, the three double D–π–A branched organic dye isomers display slightly different photophysical and photovoltaic properties. The highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% and 6.9% is achieved for the isomer D1 based DSSC with liquid and quasi-solid-state electrolyte, respectively.
