    , Accepted 21st August 2020First published on 22nd August 2020AbstractThe high-pressure behavior of three-dimensional (3D) metal halide perovskites (MHPs) has been extensively studied. Prior to the means of high-pressure fever, most experimental efforts to study the structure and optical behavior of 3D MHPs focused on dopants and dimensional reduction. The structure and properties of 3D MHPs can be regulated in situ and continuously controlled by applying high pressure, which cannot be achieved with traditional chemical methods. In this review, recent progress on studies on the response to pressure of the structure, optical properties, and carrier dynamics of 3D MHPs was summarized. The underlying mechanism of the high-pressure behavior of 3D MHPs was discussed comprehensively. Future research directions on 3D MHPs were also outlined to guide further investigations. This review aimed to provide a basis for facilitating the understanding of timely developments in emerging high-pressure perovskite-related research fields.
1 Introduction
Hybrid inorganic–organic and inorganic metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have remarkable characteristics for a wide range of optoelectronic applications and solar cells. Previous studies on perovskites were based on 3D perovskites with a general formula ABX3, which has been widely studied in many fields.1–3 The evolution of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been remarkable in the field of photovoltaics (PV) since the first publication in 2009.4 The power conversion efficiencies of MHP solar cells have increased to above ∼25%.5 It is an important field of PSCs because of the high performance and low-cost solution-based processes used in equipment manufacturing.6–10 Furthermore, 3D nanocrystals (NCs) and 3D bulk crystals have been extensively investigated because of their intriguing properties, including strong optical absorption, a low exciton binding energy, high carrier mobility, and facile preparation.11,12 The MHPs have shown great potential for optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors. Despite their unique properties and impressive achievements, challenges should be addressed by further understanding the mechanisms of their outstanding functionalities.
Pressure, as an independent parameter, seems efficient in generating new structures and properties of materials.13–17 In recent years, science and technology requiring the application of high pressure have developed from a small niche field to an increasingly attractive topic in physics, chemistry, and materials sciences.18–21 The loading of pressure by using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) can lead to close packing and reduce interatomic distances. Consequently, homogeneous lattice contraction and bonding patterns can be modified. Moreover, changes in lattice parameters are accompanied by an increased electron density and an enhanced repulsive potential within materials, resulting in other unexpected phenomena.12,15,22–28 Materials that exhibit no photoluminescence (PL) response under ambient conditions demonstrate intriguing pressure-induced emissions.29–31
Perovskites have been widely used for high-pressure applications because of their adjustable structures, band gaps, and optical properties. With the development of high-pressure optical techniques, the band structures and phase stabilities of 3D MHPs, including CsPbBr3, CsPbI3, MAPbX3, and FAPbX3, have been widely explored. In this review, an overall description of recent studies on 3D MHPs under pressure was presented in two parts: the structural evolution of 3D MHPs under pressure and the optical behavior of 3D MHPs under pressure. Although some breakthroughs have been made in photovoltaic applications using 3D MHPs, comprehensive explorations remain to be further achieved. This review aimed to provide insights into the current challenges and future potential of 3D MHPs for multiple applications by briefly summarizing recent results.
2 Structural evolution of 3D MHPs under pressure
Traditional 3D perovskites have a general formula ABX3 in which the A-site is commonly occupied by monovalent inorganic cations of cesium (Cs+) and organic cations of methyl ammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+) and formamidinium (CH(NH2)2+, FA+). In typical 3D structures of MHPs, B cations are divalent metal cations (B = Pb, Sn, or Ge) localized at the body center of a BX64+ octahedron (X = Cl, Br, I, or a mixture of them).32 B2+ can be substituted with one monovalent M+ and one trivalent M′3+ to form 3D double perovskites A2MM′X6.33–35 In comparison with traditional 3D Pb-based MHPs, double MHPs exhibit high air and thermal stability to satisfy the requirements of modern research.
The application of pressure allows the continuous pressurization of a material, revealing in situ structural changes during compression. The in situ high-pressure angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) pattern can directly reflect structural changes in 3D MHPs under pressure and definitely reveal structural evolution upon compression.36,37
2.1 Structural evolution of all-inorganic halide perovskites under pressure
Traditional 3D perovskite structures with the chemical formula ABX3 are the prototypes of MHP systems. Among these materials, lead halide perovskites (B = Pb) are one of the most typical compounds and they have been widely investigated under both ambient and high-pressure conditions. In this review, we will take this system as the starting material to review the structural responses of 3D MHPs, especially to compare the individual contributions of A- and X-site ions to the structural evolution at high pressure.
The most typical 3D MHP-based cesium lead nanocrystals (CsPbX3 NCs) have been studied for many years.38 Kovalenko et al. reported a facile colloidal synthesis of monodisperse 4–15 nm CsPbX3 NCs with a cubic shaped perovskite crystal structure.39 Zou et al. introduced high pressure to tailor the structural properties of CsPbBr3 NCs, which exhibit excellent abilities to adapt to extreme conditions.40 The ADXRD patterns recorded under different pressures indicated the pressure-dependent structure of CsPbBr3 nanocubes that experienced an isostructural phase transition between 1.0 GPa and 1.3 GPa (Fig. 1a). The refinement of the ADXRD pattern at 1.54 GPa matched the experimental data points very well, which unambiguously determined the high-pressure phase to be orthorhombic with the Pbnm space group, being the same crystallographic system as that possessed at 1 atm. CsPbBr3 NCs follow the transition sequence of orthorhombic phase I → phase II → amorphous. It should be noted that the high-pressure phase II is very difficult to compress compared to its ambient phase I (Fig. 1b). As the pressure increased, all of the bond lengths and angles were shortened, but above 2 GPa, the decreasing rate with pressure for all the Pb–Br bond lengths became slow, even presenting an apparent rising tendency for the length of one of the bonds. Under pressure, the PbBr6 octahedral framework for the CsPbBr3 crystal constantly distorted and ultimately became amorphous (Fig. 1c).

The morphology effect refers to the different responses of the corresponding bulk counterparts, nanosized materials and different morphologies of nanosized materials to pressure. The morphology effect of CsPbBr3 (nanocube, nanowire and bulk crystal) under pressure was investigated by Zou et al. and Wang et al.40,41 The unique geometrical shape of nanowires with anisotropic dimensions should be responsible for different phenomena, owing to the nanosized diameter and the length up to micrometers analogous to the bulk size. The phase change interval of 0.58 GPa ranging from 1.22 to 1.80 GPa of CsPbBr3 nanowires is larger than that (0.26 GPa) of CsPbBr3 NCs, but smaller than that (0.82 GPa) of the bulk material. Earlier reports by Nagaoka et al. mainly focused on the pressure-sintered, large, two dimensional nanoplatelets obtained from the initial CsPbBr3 superlattices under nonhydrostatic pressure.12 After pressurization, the individual CsPbBr3 NCs fuse into 2D nanoplatelets with a uniform thickness (Fig. 1e–g).
When the X-site Br− ions in CsPbBr3 are replaced by I−, the ambient structure of CsPbBr3 deviates from the orthorhombic perovskite structure to accommodate the increased radius of the iodide ions. It has been reported that CsPbI3 perovskite normally exists in the orthorhombic (δ) phase at room temperature, whereas the cubic (α) phase of CsPbI3 is unstable.42–45 Cao et al. performed a systematic study to explore the behavior of α-CsPbI3 NCs under high-pressure conditions.46 Unlike CsPbBr3 NCs, the α-CsPbI3 NCs underwent a phase transition from cubic (α) to orthorhombic phase and subsequent amorphization upon further compression. In in situ high-pressure ADXRD experiments, as the pressure reached 0.39 GPa, a new notable peak appeared, which manifested the occurrence of a phase transition (Fig. 1d). Similar to CsPbBr3 NCs, as compared with the original phase, the higher value of B0(II) relative to that in the original phase indicates that the high-pressure phase cannot be easily compressed after phase transition. However, the response under pressure is different, such as the pressure point of structural transition. In the same year, Zhang et al. reported the structural changes of orthogonal phase CsPbCl3 (space group: Pbnm) upon compression. With the increase of pressure, the peaks in the ADXRD patterns were continuously shifted to larger 2θ values, while no new peaks emerged and the original peaks disappeared before 1.7 GPa.47 The Rietveld refinement exhibited the change of space and lattice upon compression, and indicated an isostructural phase transition caused by lattice distortion and PbCl6 octahedral tilting.
2.2 Structural evolution of organic and inorganic hybrid halide perovskites under pressure
The A-site cations do not play a dominant role in the phase transitions of 3D MHPs. However, the octahedra can be responsible for the rigidity of perovskites and are constituted by the B-site and the X-site. The A-site cations will affect the degree of structural distortion, the pressure point of the phase transition, and the final amorphous phase.
As early as 2007, the study of powder neutron diffraction of MAPbBr3 initiated the structural study of the pressure effect in organic–inorganic HPVs.48 In 2015, Wang et al. reported the structural evolution of MAPbBr3 under high pressure with no pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) applied (non-hydrostatic).23 It was shown that MAPbBr3 underwent two phase transitions from cubic Pmm to cubic Im at 0.4 GPa, and then to orthorhombic Pnma at 1.8 GPa. Under non-hydrostatic pressure conditions, MAPbBr3 with the orthorhombic phase shows anisotropic compressibility. This structural transition sequence and the critical pressures of MAPbBr3 have been further confirmed by other groups through high pressure experiments with different PTMs. Zhang et al. studied MAPbBr3 using He as a PTM; the ambient-condition cubic phase I (Pmm) (Fig. 2a) of MAPbBr3 persists up to 0.85 GPa and then undergoes a discontinuous phase transition to phase II (Im) (Fig. 2b).49

In addition to the I → II phase transition, another distinct isostructural phase transition to phase III (isostructural to phase II) (Fig. 2c) was observed at 2.7 GPa. When argon was used as a PTM, the structural phase diagram was different again. Under these conditions, the cubic phase I is stable up to ∼1.0 GPa, and then at 1.1 GPa, a structural transformation to a mixture of phase II and phase IV (space group Pnma) (Fig. 2d) takes place. That mixed phase persists at least up to 11.9 GPa. The other observation of no PTM was consistent with the studies of Wang et al. under similar conditions. Taken from the experimental findings of Jaffe et al., the phase diagram and cell parameter evolution of MAPbBr3 as a function of pressure are summarized in Fig. 2f. Finally, compared to the result of Wang et al.50 (Fig. 2e), the anisotropic compression of MAPbBr3 occurred under non-hydrostatic pressure, while only two cubic phase transitions occurred under hydrostatic pressure in the article of Jaffe et al.
The distinct difference between the pressure induced phase transitions of MAPbBr3 in various environments demonstrates that the inhomogeneous strain has a strong effect on its structural stability.51 Amorphization, on the other hand, is the consequence of severe nonhydrostatic conditions caused by uniaxial stress components. Whatever the pressure conditions, tilting and distortion of octahedra have been proven to cause the successive phase transitions of MAPbBr3 to lower symmetry phases (see Table 1 shown below). Furthermore, the presence of deviatoric stress within the DAC can promote the distortion of MAPbBr3, with lower transition pressures and lower symmetry structures exhibited at high pressure.52

The Pb–I analogue has been reported to crystallize under ambient conditions in several tetragonal space groups such as I4/mcm,53I4cm,54 or I4/m,55 where twinning has complicated space-group assignment.56 The pressure-induced structural transition of MAPbI3 was much more intricate than that of MAPbBr3 and several groups have studied this topic. Interestingly, the pressure points of phase transition in different studies were in good agreement. With the first high pressure phase transition at ∼0.3 GPa, the ambient structure of MAPbI3 undergoes octahedral tilting in all lattice axis directions and then transforms into an orthorhombic Imm257 or cubic Im structure.58,59 In the paper of Wang et al., the phase transition: tetragonal I4cm (1 atm) → orthorhombic Imm2 (0.3 GPa), and structural amorphization occurred at 4 GPa via the process of continuous pressurization.57 Kong et al. observed a phase transition from I4/mcm to Imm2 at 0.4 GPa.60 However, in other reports, the next pressure point of phase transition (orthorhombic Immm) was 2.7 GPa, as reported by Jiang et al.59 According to Szafranski et al., MAPbI3 underwent a phase transition process from the tetragonal (I4/mcm) phase stable in the pressure range up to 0.35 GPa, to the cubic phase stable between 0.35 and 2.5 GPa, and to the isostructural cubic phase observed above 2.5 GPa, which undergoes gradual amorphization.61 As with other MHPs, no matter how different the process is, the increase of pressure will lead to final amorphization.
The X-site halide ions are capable of influencing material compressibility at high pressure.52 Jaffe et al. compared the bulk modulus (K0) between MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 to obtain the accurate structural contribution of X-site halide ions (Fig. 2g–j).62
The structural transition sequence of MAPbCl3 under high pressure is as follows: Pmm → Pmm → Pnma, respectively, at 0.8 and 2.4 GPa.63 The first transition is the cubic to cubic isostructural transition, relying mainly on the rotation of the MA cation. And when the pressure increased to 5.6 GPa, amorphization gradually occurred.
Compared to methylammonium organic–inorganic perovskites, including MAPbI3, MAPbCl3, and MAPbBr3, a lower bulk modulus K0 was observed in trigonal α-FAPbI3 (P3m1), being on the order of 11.0(2) GPa. Liu et al. reported that such soft lattice evolution under pressure led to all XRD peaks continuously shifting to a larger 2 theta (smaller d-spacing) range, while no new peak was observed up to 7 GPa.64 Surprisingly, the XRD patterns after decompression compared to before compression for the same FAPbI3 sample were shifted to a larger 2 theta range, indicating a partial retainable behavior. And then Wang et al. reported that the structure of α-FAPbI3 (Pmm) changed under pressure.65 α-FAPbI3 (Pmm) experienced two phase transitions: Pmm → Imm2 → Immm, respectively, at 0.34 and 1.67 GPa. Upon compression to 4 GPa, the XRD patterns display a broad profile, indicating lattice amorphization, similar to other perovskite materials. The difference, however, was that the recovered phase at near-ambient pressure upon decompression exhibits a pattern similar to phase II instead of the ambient phase I.
The effect of cation size and the different intermolecular interactions between organic cations and inorganic octahedra result in the fact that FAPbBr3 is less compressible than the reported MAPbBr3.66 The structural changes of Pmm → Im → Pnma and amorphization of the FAPbBr3 crystal under compression, respectively, at 0.53, 2.2, and 4.0 GPa occurred. The XRD data showed that FAPbBr3 required higher pressures for phase transitions compared with the reported MAPbBr3, which indicated that FAPbBr3 is less compressible under external pressure.
The high toxicity of Pb and intrinsic instability of the pristine perovskite materials have become great obstacles to their industrial application and commercialization. To address these serious issues, it is imperative to explore low-toxicity metal halide perovskites or their derivatives to substitute Pb-based materials for better future development.67
The replacement of lead with nontoxic alternatives, such as tin, has attracted increasing interest. Lee et al. reported conducting tin(II)-iodide-based 3D hybrid cubic perovskites, (MAxFA1−x)SnI3, that were chosen for their initial investigations.68 They not only investigated the transformation of the structure under high pressure but also elaborated the influence of organic cations on the change of the structure under high pressure. For MASnI3, the ambient pressure primitive cubic unit cell transforms to a body-centered cubic one, with supercell reflections appearing after 0.5 GPa, and an orthorhombic distortion of MASnI3 occurs after 2.2 GPa. In the case of FASnI3, the lowering from cubic to tetragonal symmetry begins near 1.9 GPa. With the pressure evolution of the mixed cation sample MA0.5FA0.5SnI3, the tetragonal distortion occurs as early as 0.8 GPa and increases as the pressure increases up to 4.0 GPa. This demonstrates the ‘‘soft’’ nature of the organic cations under pressure. In order to understand the instinctual properties of Sn-based perovskites, Wang et al. studied the pressure response of MASnCl3.69 The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experimental results showed that the sample transforms from the monoclinic to the triclinic phase at 1.0 GPa and then amorphizes at 4.1 GPa. The tilting and distortion of [SnCl6]4− octahedra are mainly responsible for the phase transition.
2.3 Structural engineering of double perovskites under pressure
Double perovskites with long carrier recombination lifetimes and excellent stability are regarded as star favorites for state-of-the-art hybrid lead halide 3D perovskites in photovoltaic devices. Among the main group elements, only trivalent Bi3+ cations possess the same electronic configuration as Pb2+, and Bi-based Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized.70 Fu et al. reported the structural evolution of nontoxic double halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs under high pressure.71 Under ambient conditions, the initial crystal structure is in the pure cubic phase I with the space group Fmm, in which [AgBr6]5− and [BiBr6]3− octahedra are alternately ordered (Fig. 3b). As pressure increased, the octahedra got tilted and the structure underwent a pressure-induced phase transition at 2.3 GPa. And at 3.9 GPa, it could be clearly observed that a new diffraction peak appeared. The Rietveld refinement of ADXRD patterns matches very well with the experimental data points at 4.8 GPa. The results show that the high-pressure phase is tetragonal with the I4/m space group. Similarly, this is consistent with the previous report about the bulk Cs2AgBiBr6 crystal by Li et al.72 For the bulk Cs2AgBiBr6 crystal, the ADXRD spectral splitting of two diffraction peaks at 3.1 GPa was observed, confirming the occurrence of a phase transition. At 4.5 GPa, cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 gets transformed to the tetragonal phase with the I4/m space group. Recently, Zhang et al. reported the bulk Cs2AgBiCl6 crystal, in which the pressure-dependent XRD patterns showed the subtle splitting of two diffraction peaks located at around 6.8 and 13.7°, indicating a pressure induced phase transition.73 Rietveld refinement was conducted to determine the transition from the cubic structure with the space group Fmm (1 atm) to a tetragonal structure with the space group I4/m (5.6 GPa).

3 Optical behaviors of MHPs under pressure
Many applications and potential uses of perovskites depend on their optical and electronic properties. Some of these applications are in solar cells, light-emitting devices, sensors, transistors, and bioimaging and therapeutic tools. For MHP absorbers, their electronic structures determine the spectral width of solar absorption and photoexcitation efficiency, whereas the transport of charge carriers is significantly affected by the electrical properties of MHPs, such as resistance and ion migration.52 The electrical and optical properties of perovskites strongly depend on band structures originating from the allowed quantum mechanical wave functions in a perovskite crystal.74 Therefore, bandgap engineering plays an important role in the development of highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs).75 In general, the pressure-induced shortening of a bond length narrows the corresponding band gap, whereas the bending of the B–X–B angle widens the band gap.76
3.1 Band gap engineering upon compression
According to Shockley–Queisser theory, the optimal Eg of absorbers is 1.34 eV, which offers the best solar absorption width and the 33.7% power conversion limit of single junction semiconductor-based solar cells.77 The band gaps of MHPs directly translate to their optical properties and therefore are commonly measured via optical absorption spectroscopy. The position of the absorption peak or edge corresponds to the energy of the band gap in the material. The band gap of MHPs was assessed by extrapolating the linear portion of the (αhν)2 or (αhν)1/2versus hν curve, where α is the absorption coefficient, and hν is the photon energy.78,79 When the pressure is increased, the structure of a perovskite undergoes a series of transformations, including elastic shrinkage and phase transformation, as described in the previous part of this review.
As the pressure increased, the absorption edge of CsPbBr3 NCs underwent a red shift until 1.19 GPa and then a blue shift was observed, as reported by Zou et al. (Fig. 4a).40 This paper demonstrated that high pressure band gap narrowing and broadening are related to bond length and structural titling. Upon further compression, the compound eventually evolved into an indirect band-gap structure as a result of the considerable distortion of the more compact octahedral skeleton to accommodate the Jahn–Teller effect (Fig. 4b). The detailed evolution of the band-gap energy for CsPbBr3 NCs with increasing pressure is displayed in Fig. 4c. When the X-site was replaced with I−,46 the variation trend of the band gap was consistent with that of the CsPbBr3 NCs. However, the pressure point of the minimum value of energy at 0.3 GPa was smaller than at 1.19 GPa (Fig. 4d). The band gap of α-CsPbI3 perovskites was mainly determined by the changes in the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). The phase transition leads to an increased degree of Pb–I electron cloud overlap. Hence, the VBM energy increases as a result of the enhanced coupling between the Pb 6s and the I 5p orbitals, thereby ultimately causing a red shift of the band gap with pressure.

For the Imm2 phase, the Pb–I–Pb bond angle became much smaller than 180° and the electron wave function overlapped much less than that in the I4/mcm phase. Adapted with permission from ref. 60.

Wang et al. demonstrated that high pressure band gap narrowing and broadening of MAPbBr3 are associated with Pb–Br bond contraction and the breaking of long-range-ordered structures, respectively.23 Subsequently, the simultaneous interpretation of the structural changes of MAPbBr3 in different PTMs found them to be the cause of the change in the band gap, as reported by Zhang et al.49 And density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the dynamics of the organic molecules and the inorganic lattice, coupled via the N–H⋯Br hydrogen-bonding interactions, affect the Pb–Br distance and the bandgap evolution under pressure.
Kong et al. systematically studied the band gap responses and associated structural mechanisms of MAPbI3 at high pressure.60 At ambient pressure, the band-gap of MAPbI3 was 1.537 eV. As the pressure increased, the band gap of MAPbI3 undergoes a noticeable red-shift to 1.507 eV at 0.32 GPa and a subsequent ‘blue jump’ (Fig. 4e). And this can be reproduced successfully by first-principles calculations (Fig. 4f). As the pressure increases in the low-pressure phase, the predominant Pb–I–Pb bond angle remains at nearly 180°, but the bond length shortens under pressure. Due to the strong hybridization of the Pb s and I p antibonding character in the VBM, the CBM has mostly a nonbonding Pb p character.80 The blue jump can be understood from the fact that the averaged Pb–I–Pb bond angle in Imm2 [i.e. the high-pressure orthorhombic phase] is 154.6°, which is considerably smaller than that (171.8°) in I4/mcm [i.e., the low pressure tetragonal phase] (Fig. 4g and h).81 Therefore, when phase transition occurs, the Pb–I bond is partially broken and the Pb s and I p orbital coupling is reduced, as illustrated in Fig. 5h, leading to a widened band gap.

MAPbI3 perovskites are generally considered direct bandgap semiconductors. However, Wang et al. demonstrated that in fact they present a weakly indirect bandgap 60 meV below the direct bandgap transition.82 Under hydrostatic pressure from ambient pressure to 325 MPa, MAPbI3 undergoes a reversible phase transition resulting in a purely direct bandgap semiconductor. This is a consequence of spin–orbit coupling resulting in Rashba-splitting of the conduction band. Rashba splitting is reduced due to a pressure induced reduction in local electric field around the Pb atom, which gives rise to an indirect-to-direct transition (Fig. 5a and b). The change of band gap type caused by pressure has opened up a way for the development of new and reasonable perovskite semiconductor materials and structures. Does the Rashba effect in bulk MAPbI3 really exist? Frohna et al. ruled out the presence of a large static Rashba effect in bulk MAPbI3, and the measurement identified no evidence of dynamic Rashba effects.83 Understanding carrier dynamics in MAPbI3 requires a close examination of its atomic and electronic structure, which requires further experimental investigation to confirm the results. This will be one of the problems to be solved in the study of 3D perovskites.
Different from MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3, the band gap of MAPbCl3 was 3.06 eV under ambient conditions. The pressure-driven band gap decreased to 3.00 eV at 0.64 GPa, increased from 3.01 eV at 0.83 GPa to 3.13 eV at 1.8 GPa, and abruptly increased to 3.15 eV at 1.9 GPa, followed by a continuous increase.63 The pressure-driven band gap of MAPbCl3 can be fine-tuned to the UV region, associated with the appearance of two turning points originating from the structural changes in the crystal. Similarly, the band gap of MAPbCl3 was mainly determined by changes in the VBM. The CBM is less sensitive to the contraction of the Pb–Cl bond because of its nonbonding characteristic. The VBM is characterized as an antibonding hybrid state of the Pb-s and the Cl-p orbitals in the [PbCl6]4− octahedral network, and the CBM is characterized as a nonbonding hybrid state of the Pb-p orbitals.
By modulating the valence electron wavefunction with modest pressure up to 2.1 GPa, the optimized bandgap in lead-based perovskites, for the first time, was achieved by narrowing the bandgap of FAPbI3 from 1.489 to 1.337 eV.64 Strikingly, such bandgap narrowing was partially retained after the release of pressure to ambient for the first time in ABX3 perovskites (Fig. 5c). In the report of Wang et al., α-FAPbI3 was found to have a calculated band gap energy of 1.35 eV at ambient pressure.65 As the pressure is increased, the band structures do not undergo fundamental changes, but the band gap energy decreases. The reduction of the band gap is related to a greater level of orbital overlap in the PbI6 octahedra, which is naturally induced by the Pb–I bond contraction at high pressure. For FAPbBr3, the absorbance spectrum under ambient conditions possesses a band gap of 2.27 eV.66 The rate of change in the bandgap upon pressure presented two distinct turning points at 0.6 and 2.2 GPa in line with the points of phase transition (as detailed in Section 2).
The non-toxic and stable double perovskite of Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibits attractive optical and electronic features. However, its practical performance is hampered by its large band gap. Li et al. reported remarkable band gap narrowing from ∼2.2 eV at ambient pressure to 1.7 eV at 15 GPa, for the first time, achieved on inorganic photovoltaic double perovskites of Cs2AgBiBr6 through high pressure treatments.72 Surprisingly, the narrowed band gap is partially retainable after releasing pressure due to the incomplete recrystallization (Fig. 5d and e). The pressure-induced band gap evolution is correlated with the structural evolution (as detailed in part 2). Then, Fu et al. reported Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs; the quenched absorption peak of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs was slightly blue-shifted compared with that of the initial one under ambient conditions (Fig. 5f), which is in stark contrast to that of the corresponding bulk counterparts.71 What makes the difference is that the structure of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs was not yet recovered and maintained a certain degree of distortion after fully releasing the pressure. What's more, the NCs after decompression are a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases, which leads to a larger quenched band gap than that of the initial value. Likewise, the changes in the Cs2AgBiCl6 bandgap with compression were noted through in situ high-pressure UV-vis absorption measurements up to ca. 31 GPa by Zhang et al.73 As pressure increases, the band gap of Cs2AgBiCl6 gradually red shifts below 5 GPa, followed by a sharp increase from 5 GPa to 7 GPa, and then a red shift in the band gap is observed. The difference is, after 14 GPa up to ca. 31 GPa, the band gap is nearly unchanged. Detailed band gap changes are shown in Table 2.

3.2 Modulation of emission and carrier dynamics by pressure
Research on the optical and electronic characteristics of MHPs under pressure directly benefits the development of applications involving elevated pressure such as pressure sensors, switches, etc. Compression changes the structures of 3D MHPs, and the optical properties are inevitably affected.

3.2.1 PL spectra and carrier lifetimes. 
As the pressure increased, the PL of 3D MHPs shifted and quenched in the end. However, the good optical properties of polychromatic materials are also shown during the pressure change process, such as for Cs2AgBiCl6 and FAPbBr3 (Fig. 6). Due to the difference of initial structures and the distortion under pressure increased were all characteristic, the PL intensity and wavelength change also had its own characteristics. The shift in the PL spectra, as well as bandgap widening, is induced by the tilting distortion of the [XB6]4− octahedra during the structural changes.
 Fig. 6  PL spectra and photographs of partial 3D MHPs under high pressures. 
To investigate the optical properties of 3D MHPs, research on the high-pressure PL behavior of 3D MHPs has achieved unprecedented rapid development (Fig. 6). For CsPbBr3 NCs, as reported by Zou et al., the PL peak displayed a red-shift in wavelength and gradually became broad with an increase in pressure. Additionally, the PL intensity decreased sharply upon compression to 1.21 GPa, after which the fluorescence was abruptly quenched, which may be governed by a structure-related change.40 The lead-free double halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibited no PL response to external pressure.71,72 Whereas, the analogous Cs2AgBiCl6 double halide perovskite showed an interesting piezochromic behavior under high pressure.73 This polychromatic variation is rare in 3D samples, which provides a good design idea for 3D LED devices.
In addition, the effect of pressure-induced defects on lifetime should not be ignored. Surprisingly, pressure was found to make an outstanding contribution to the prolongation of carrier recombination lifetime of 3D MHPs. For the first time, Kong et al. carried out in situ high-pressure time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements on MAPbI3 to study the pressure influence on the carrier lifetime τ.60 According to previous reports, the dominant trap states are located in the shallow energy region near the CBM and VBM, which protects the electron–hole pair against recombination.80 Thus, the band edges approaching (as detailed in part 3.1) under pressure should play a critical role in carrier properties. With the pressure being increased, the trap states that are already present in the subgap close to the VBM become even shallower. As reported by Kong et al., the pressure of MAPbI3 at which the peak value of carrier lifetime is obtained is at 0.3 GPa, where there is the narrowest band gap (Fig. 7a–c).60 Wang et al. reported five times faster charge carrier recombination in a MAPbI3 film (Fig. 7d) and correlated it with the indirect–direct bandgap transition (as detailed in part 3.1).82 Using the same measurement, Liu et al. demonstrated the carrier lifetime of FAPbI3 with the bandgap narrowing under pressure being double-prolonged (Fig. 7e).64 Simultaneous band-gap narrowing and carrier-lifetime prolongation of CsPbBr3 NCs were also achieved as expected by Zou et al. (Fig. 7f and g).40 The prolonged lifetime of CsPbBr3 NCs is closely involved in surface-related trap states, implying a pressure-driven decrease in oscillator strength that agrees well with the changes of PL intensity (shown above).

3.2.2 Electrical conductivity and photocurrent. 
Last but not least, the electrical conductivity and photocurrent of MHPs under pressure are briefly reviewed. High pressure studies on the electrical conductivity and photocurrent of MHPs are critical for applications in optoelectronic devices. Wang et al. carried out in situ resistance measurement on MAPbBr3 using four-point-probe and quasi-four-point-probe methods within DAC devices.23 When pressure increased above 2 GPa, MAPbBr3 showed gradually and rapidly increased resistance until a plateau was reached around 25 GPa, and the maximum resistance reached a 5 orders of magnitude higher value compared to the starting value (Fig. 8a). The pressure-induced amorphization may be responsible for the increased resistance.

The in situ photocurrent experiment of MAPbBr3 showed an obvious on–off switch response to visible light over the entire measured pressure range (Fig. 8b). In addition, the mixed conduction of ions and electrons in polycrystalline MAPbBr3 was observed through impedance measurement (Fig. 8c).84
The inflection points found in the pressure dependence of ionic and electronic resistances can be attributed to the pressure-induced structural phase transitions. Different from MAPbBr3, Jaffe et al. performed dc conductivity measurements on compressed MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 8d.62 With compression to ca. 5 GPa, conductivity increases to approximately 6 × 10−3 S cm−1 from ca. 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at the lowest pressure, reaches a plateau, and then decreases upon further compression to ca. 30 GPa. As the pressure increased further, a dramatic increase in conductivity was noticed, leading to a maximum of 1.5 S cm−1 at 51 GPa. In situ alternating current impedance spectroscopy measurements on FAPbBr3 were carried out up to 4.8 GPa (Fig. 8e).85In situ resistance measurements performed by Lü et al. showed that the conductivity of MASnI3 after high-pressure treatments was three-fold higher than the initial value.86 Ambient pressure photocurrent measurements also disclosed a significant enhancement in visible light responsiveness of MASnI3 after high-pressure treatment. Recently, Lin et al. reported In-based, charge-ordered (In+/In3+) inorganic halide perovskites with the composition of Cs2In(I)In(III)Cl6 in which a pressure-driven semiconductor-to-metal phase transition occurs.87 The absorbance spectrum of Cs2In(I)In(III)Cl6 red shifts with pressure up to 13.9 GPa, above which absorption increases abruptly with a broadband metallic feature (Fig. 8f). As shown in Fig. 8g, the bandgap starts at about 2.9 eV under ambient pressure, and then it gradually decreases to about 2.0 to 2.1 eV until 13.9 GPa and closes completely under higher pressures.

4 Summary and outlook
This review focuses on research on the effect of high-pressure on 3D MHPs and systematically discusses variations in structural, optical, and optoelectronic properties. Although the properties of 3D MHPs under compression have remarkably improved, some problems have yet to be solved.
First, changes in properties under high pressure should be further explored. Many studies on 3D halide perovskites under pressure have been conducted. In Table 1, different pressure points of phase transition in CsPbBr3 are observed because of the effect of morphological characteristics. Various studies have shown that the same initial structure of MAPbBr3 undergoes different phase transition routines. This usual behavior also occurs in MAPbI3 under high pressure. However, further studies should verify whether different PTMs are the main cause for this behavior when other experimental conditions are the same. Different experimental conditions may result in a certain deviation. Therefore, experiments on different PTMs in the same experimental environment should be carried out. Angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) patterns provide the most direct evidence used to characterize phase transition pressure points and high-pressure structures. Structural information can be detected through a combination of experimental methods of single crystal diffraction (SCXRD), neutron scattering, and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements. High-pressure fluorescence experiments, high-pressure UV-visible absorption experiments, Raman vibrational spectroscopy, infrared vibrational spectroscopy, and other techniques can be used to accurately describe the change in optical properties. In addition to optical properties, electrical properties, such as conductivity and photocurrent, should be characterized to understand how materials change at high pressure and elucidate the corresponding relationship between material structures and properties under high-pressure conditions. Therefore, further studies will help provide a solid theoretical foundation for the wide application of materials under extreme conditions.
Second, theoretical and experimental findings have a slight relationship because of insufficient theoretical evidence. The lack of reasonable theoretical calculations to support experimental data may be one of the reasons for contradictory results of different studies on the same material. Under high pressure, halide perovskites produce new physical and chemical phenomena, which may be due to the formation of a high-pressure phase and the continuous distortion of structures. Therefore, a reasonable calculation should be introduced to elucidate the relationship of structures and properties. Structural entropy should be calculated before and after phase transition to ensure the stability of structures and prove the rationality of a high-pressure phase. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the electronic structures of model materials are conducted to help understand their properties. Such calculations will have a better auxiliary effect on the certainty of studies. The theoretical prediction of high-pressure structures and high-pressure phenomena will be an important basis for conducting high-pressure experiments. High-pressure phenomena are the most direct evidence to show the properties of materials under extreme conditions. Therefore, theoretical calculations and experiments should complement each other.
Third, achievements related to 3D halide perovskites under compression have been presented; however, high-pressure properties upon decompression can be retained in few systems. The band gap and novel properties of compressed 3D MHPs should also be determined for practical applications. Reasonably designed A-site molecules can enrich the different types of hybrid perovskites. A-site cations affect the degree of structural distortion, the pressure point of phase transition, and the final amorphization. Organic functional groups should be introduced to enrich the physical and chemical properties of halide perovskites under high pressure. The effect of organic functional groups under pressure on perovskite properties has been demonstrated in low-dimensional perovskites. For example, organic C4N2H142+ in the hybrid MHP C4N2H14SnBr4 may offer large steric hindrance and serve as a buffer layer to accommodate pressure in a wide pressure range.30 Moreover, the hydrostatic compression of the hybrid perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is dimensionally reduced to be quasi-uniaxial because interlayer organic parts deform more easily than inorganic layers do.88 Organic layers with a self-adaptive configuration are similar to buffer layers composed of springs, which are inserted between octahedral [PbI6]4− layers. A [PbI6]4− octahedral structure is protected against distortion and rotation during either compression or decompression.
Fourth, high-pressure compression represents a physical process, so it is environmentally friendly. It does not involve the use of organic solvents. In contrast to chemical synthesis, high-pressure compression no longer requires further purification to remove byproducts. Therefore, the pressure-induced control of the size of perovskites will be a good future research direction. QD materials are characterized by a favorable combination of quantum-size effects, thereby enhancing their optical properties with respect to their bulk counterparts. The size and dimension of materials can be further changed through high-pressure experiments to control the physical and chemical properties of materials. Such a study was performed by Nagaoka, as reported in part 1. And the special means of high pressure may lead to the formation of new metastable structures or new phases that are not stable at ambient pressure.89
Lastly, in studies on perovskites under high pressure, pressure is mostly generated by using a symmetric DAC apparatus. Although a DAC can produce sufficiently high pressure, it is not conducive to practical applications because of the small sample quantity used in experiments. Large-volume press (LVP) technology can be applied to produce more high-pressure samples. With DAC application, fundamental properties under much higher pressure, e.g., changes in structures and optoelectronic properties, can be explored because of the advantages of diamonds. Relevant DAC data can provide related information of targeted materials using LVP technology to obtain more samples for further practical applications. Another important thermodynamic parameter, temperature, also has a great influence on the structural stability of perovskites. Therefore, in order to further enrich the research, it is necessary to add the temperature dimensionality to deeply understand the structural stability and property changes of MHPs under high pressure.
In summary, high pressure application offers new MHP structures with superior and novel structural, optical, and electrical properties. MHPs are yet to be fully explored, and many limitations and challenges exist in studies on MHPs. Research on high-pressure MHPs will facilitate further exploration of the MHP environment, leading to the significant development of their structures and other physicochemical properties.
