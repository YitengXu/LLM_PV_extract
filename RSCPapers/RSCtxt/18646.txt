    , Accepted 14th May 2019First published on 15th May 2019AbstractTo develop efficient nonfullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSCs), it is important to utilize the absorption of each material component for realizing broad and strong absorption. Developing ternary blend structures is an effective strategy that employs three different materials to achieve complementary absorption spectra. Herein, for the first time, we used D–A1–D–A2-type random terpolymers to enhance the absorption of the ternary blend NF-OSCs. Combined with the merits of the ternary blend structure, efficient NF-OSCs containing one terpolymer donor and two different molecular acceptors were investigated in detail. The weak points of the optical absorption spectra depended largely on the DPP/BT molar ratio. The terpolymer with 0.3/0.7 molar ratio (DPP/BT) was the best candidate for filling those weak points and generating a strong and broad absorption peak. The best devices exhibited good stability with a PCE of 13.63%, which remained at 80% of the original even after 400 hours of storage. A high PCE of 11.43% could also be realized even in the large area device (1.0 cm−2). Our study provides a useful concept to improve the absorption ability and elevate the efficiency of NF-OSCs by integrating a terpolymer donors and a ternary blend structure.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), with features of low-cost, large-scale manufacturing capability and compatibility with flexible substrates, have attracted considerable attention recently.1,2 With the continuous innovation in materials and devices, rapid progress has been made, especially in case of the promising nonfullerene OSCs (NF-OSCs) in the past few years.2 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 14% have been reported by many research groups,3–9 showing their huge potential for commercial applications.
In terms of realizing high-performance OSCs, strong and broad absorption is a prerequisite parameter for photoelectron generation. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of new materials and new device technologies that maximize optical absorption. Among these, the donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating scaffold has been proven to be a well-established and successful strategy; thus, remarkable progress has been realized recently.3,10–14 Nevertheless, achieving panchromatic absorption with just a D–A donor polymer is still a great challenge because of the narrow absorption bandwidth.15 To overcome the absorption limitation, developing ternary blends has been put forward as an efficient strategy.6–8,16–19 By introducing a second donor (forming a D1:D2:A structure) or acceptor (forming a D:A1:A2 structure) material, the ternary blend not only affords an expanded absorption bandwidth, but also maintains processing simplicity.6–8,16–19 Furthermore, the multiple energy and/or charge transfer pathways would contribute to more efficient energy conversion, exciton dissociation and charge collection.19 Nevertheless, incorporating the third component makes the morphology more complicated to control.15,20,21 A large physico-chemical difference would result in unfavorable interactions in the active blends, which increase the morphological defects and charge recombination centers, leading to photovoltaic performance reduction; all these issues further aggravated at high blend ratios.21 For these reasons, only small amounts (less than 20 wt%) of the third component were added in many cases, which further limited the elevation of the device performance.17,22–24
In addition to the ternary blends, random terpolymer donors have also attracted considerable attention.25 Such triblock copolymers deploy three different monomer species in a conjugated backbone by inserting one more donor block (forming D1–A–D2–A structure) or acceptor block (forming D–A1–D–A2 structure), which will integrate the complementary advantage of each chromophore. By just tuning the monomer ratio (D1/D2 or A1/A2), the optical absorption of the corresponding terpolymers could be modulated feasibly from short wavelength to long wavelength, thus realizing enhanced light harvesting ability. Furthermore, the frontier orbital level, charge transport and morphological compatibility could also be optimized efficiently using this strategy.26 Regardless of the above merits, the development of high performance random terpolymers still lacks progress, and most studies are based on terpolymer:fullerene blends, with only very few reports being presented employing terpolymer:nonfullerene systems.26–33 Furthermore, most of the reported random terpolymers are based on identical or very similar backbones. Therefore, minimal changes on the side chains or the bridge units show limited effects on modulating the overall properties.28–33
In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate an improvement in the photovoltaic performance of NF-OSCs by adopting a strategy that involves the combining random terpolymer donors with the ternary blends. Three D–A1–D–A2 type terpolymers, namely PT1, PT3 and PT5, were selected as the donor materials, which contained benzodithiophene (BDT) as the donor block as well as benzothiadiazole (BT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor segments (Fig. 1a).15 The optical absorption of these random terpolymers depended strongly on the molar ratio of diketopyrrolopyrrole and benzothiadiazole (DPP/BT, n/m). Upon increasing the DPP/BT ratio, the main absorption band shifted from 500–700 nm to 500–850 nm. On the other hand, the low bandgap small molecule ITCPTC (main absorption range: 550–800 nm) and the wide bandgap small molecule meta-TrBRCN (main absorption range: 300–600 nm) were chosen as the nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) as they have complimentary absorption (Fig. 1b).17,34 The optimal ternary blend ratio (terpolymer:ITCPTCx:meta-TrBRCN(1−x)) in the best devices was determined to be 1:0.7:0.3 using any of the above three terpolymers as the donor material. In each of the optimized ternary blend NF-OSCs, the weak points of absorption were connected with the DPP/BT molar ratio. PT1:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 had weak absorption in the long wavelength area, while PT5:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 had weak absorption in the short wavelength region. However, PT3 (n/m = 0.3/0.7) was the best donor candidate for achieving strong and broad absorption. Thus, PT3-based devices yielded the highest short circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.16 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 76.3% and PCE of 13.63%. It could retain 80% of the original performance after 400 hours of storage in a glove box, showing good device stability. Furthermore, when PT3-based large-area devices (1.0 cm−2) were fabricated, a high PCE of 11.43% could also be realized.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Optical properties and energy levels
The normalized UV-vis absorption profiles of the random terpolymers (PT1, PT3 and PT5) and the small molecular acceptors (ITCPTC and meta-TrBRCN) in the film state are shown in Fig. 1b. The main absorption bands of ITCPTC and meta-TrBRCN were located in the ranges of 550–800 nm and 300–600 nm, respectively. On increasing the DPP/BT molar ratio, the main absorption range of the terpolymers red-shifted gradually from 500–700 nm to 500–850 nm, which led to broad absorption profiles when blended with the above two acceptors (Fig. S1–S3†). The enhanced absorption induced by the random terpolymer and the ternary blend would enable greater light harvesting ability to produce higher Jsc and PCE values.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the donor and acceptor were estimated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S4†), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were calculated from the offset between HOMO and Eoptg. As shown in Fig. 1c, the HOMO/LUMO levels were −4.90/−3.33 eV, −4.88/−3.35 eV and −4.86/−3.35 eV for the PT1, PT3 and PT5 donors, and −5.50/−3.92 eV and −5.95/−3.87 eV for the ITCPTC and meta-TrBRCN acceptors, respectively. The HOMO level upshifted slightly with an increase in the DPP/BT molar ratio (n/m). Therefore, slightly reduced open-circuit voltages (Voc) were observed in the resulting devices. However, an improved Voc could be obtained in the devices containing higher meta-TrBRCN acceptor content because of its higher LUMO level.
2.2. Photovoltaic properties
The effects of combining the terpolymer and ternary blend on the photovoltaic properties were studied with an inverted device structure (Fig. 1d). The J–V curves with different D/A ratios were plotted and shown in Fig. S5–S7,† and the resulting photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1–S3.† Their dependence on the D/A ratio variation using the ITCPTC content is also presented in Fig. 2. The best device performances are extracted and shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1.

Using meta-TrBRCN alone as the acceptor in binary blends, PT5:meta-TrBRCN devices showed the highest PCE of 9.61% (8.75% for PT1:meta-TrBRCN devices and 9.47% for PT3:meta-TrBRCN devices). For ITCPTC acceptor-only devices, PT1:ITCPTC devices achieved the best PCE of 11.01%, which was higher than 10.69% for PT3:ITCPTC and 10.15% for PT5:ITCPTC. Clearly, the absorption of random terpolymers with lower DPP/BT molar ratio (PT1, 0.1/0.9) matched better with the low bandgap of ITCPTC, while those of higher DPP/BT molar ratio (PT5, 0.5/0.5) matched better with the large bandgap of meta-TrBRCN to realize better complementary absorption. On changing the acceptor weight ratio in the ternary blends, a linear dependence of the Vocs for all the random terpolymer-based ternary devices on the weight fraction of ITCPTC was observed. In contrast, the Jsc and FF values improved first and then decreased. The highest Jsc values were obtained for PT1, PT3 and PT5 devices with 80 wt%, 70 wt% and 60 wt% of ITCPTC, respectively. PT1 with a low DPP/BT molar ratio (0.1/0.9) had a blue-shifted absorption; therefore, higher ITCPTC content was needed to make up for the insufficient absorption at longer wavelengths. PT5 with a high DPP/BT molar ratio (0.5/0.5) had red-shifted absorption; therefore, higher meta-TrBRCN content was required to compensate for the insufficient absorption at shorter wavelengths. An optimized ITCPTC weight ratio (70 wt%) in the PT3-based ternary blends was beneficial for maximizing the light harvesting ability over the whole absorption range, thus improving the Jsc to 20.16 mA cm−2. However, the highest Jsc values were obtained as 19.32 mA cm−2 for PT1 (80 wt% ITCPTC)-based and 19.69 mA cm−2 for PT5 (60 wt% ITCPTC)-based ternary devices. Their FF values displayed the same variation trend. The highest FF values were achieved when 70 wt% of ITCPTC was added in all the above three ternary blend devices, which were 70.9%, 76.3% and 74.4% for PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based OSCs, respectively. Accordingly, both the highest Jsc and FF for PT3-based devices were obtained at the same fraction of ITCPTC, contributing to the best PCE of 13.62%. In contrast, lower PCEs of 12.27% and 12.72% were achieved for PT1 and PT5 devices, respectively, due to the compromise between Jsc and FF. As shown in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 3b and c), the devices based on PT1:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 showed a high EQE response below 600 nm, but the response was much lower from 650 to 800 nm. The devices based on PT5:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBTCN0.3 displayed the highest EQE response from 650 to 800 nm, while their lowest response was obtained from 300 to 650 nm. However, the PT3:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 devices showed an optimized EQE response over the entire absorption range, which was consistent with the optical absorption spectra (Fig. 3d). Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the PT3-based devices exhibited the highest photocurrent in devices. The calculated short current densities (JEQEs) were determined to be 18.90, 19.81 and 19.11 mA cm−2 for PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blend devices, respectively.
2.3. Morphology and charge carrier mobility
To investigate the effect of the random terpolymers on the packing behavior of the ternary blends, two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was performed (Fig. 4). The (100) diffraction peak of ITCPTC was located at 0.34 Å−1,34 while it was at 0.38 Å−1 for meta-TrBRCN (Fig. S8†). Therefore, the (100) peaks at qxy = 0.25, 0.29 and 0.29 Å−1 in the PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blend films belonged to the random terpolymers, corresponding to the lamellar stacking distances (dls) of 25.1, 21.7 and 21.7 Å for PT1, PT3 and PT5, respectively. The longer lamellar stacking distance of PT1 originated from the larger steric hindrance induced by the alkylthiophene bridges that prevented the PT1 polymer chains from interpenetrating into each other. PT3 and PT5 with reduced alkylthiophene bridges thus induced a lower steric hindrance for more compact lamellar stacking (smaller dl values). All the three random terpolymers based ternary blends exhibited a (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.7 Å−1, with the π–π stacking distance (dπ) of 3.69 Å. However, PT3 and PT5 had much stronger (010) diffraction peaks, implying their higher crystallinity than PT1. In addition, one more diffraction peak in the pattern of the PT1 blend, located at qxy = 0.38 Å−1, was ascribed to the lamellar packing of meta-TrBRCN. These results indicated that the PT1-based ternary blends exhibited slightly poor miscibility, leading to more pronounced phase separation and larger domains. This was confirmed further by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements (Fig. 4e). The q values were 0.15, 0.18 and 0.19 nm−1 for PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blends; thus, their domain sizes were estimated to be 21, 18 and 17 nm, respectively.19 Furthermore, the domain purity was estimated to be 1.0, 0.98 and 0.94 for PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blends, respectively. The very close domain sizes and domain purity indicated their very similar phase separation, which was useful to highlight the absorption optimization by using random terpolymer donors in this study.

The phase separation of the optimized ternary blends was also studied by conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. These ternary blends exhibited well-defined nanofibril-like phase separations, as shown in Fig. 5, which were beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation. Gradually, the phase separation lowered slightly from PT1 to PT3 and PT5, which agreed well with the R-SoXS results. The slightly higher aggregation of the PT1 blends resulted in a larger root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 2.32 nm. In contrast, the PT3 and PT5 blends displayed smooth top surfaces with smaller RMS values (1.45 nm for PT3 and 1.35 nm for PT5), which would be beneficial for better interfacial contact and more efficient charge extraction in devices. In addition, the more appropriate domain size with interpenetrating frameworks of the PT3-based blends could provide enough channels and D/A interfaces for more efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation.

The hole and electron mobility (μh/μe) values were estimated by the space charge-limited current method (Fig. S9†), and were found to be 1.7 × 10−4/3.5 × 10−4, 3.6 × 10−4/3.2 × 10−4 and 4.1 × 10−4/2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blend devices, respectively. The μh values improved gradually from PT1 to PT3 and PT5, while the μe values decreased slightly. This was due to the higher crystallinity of the acceptor in the lower order PT1-based blends, as observed from the 2D-GIWXAS results. The slightly reduced μe values could be attributed to the increased polymer networks (higher polymer crystallinity), which restrain the acceptor aggregation (more mixed acceptor phase) required for electron transport. The relatively high and more balanced charge carrier mobilities of the PT3-based blends (μh/μe = 1.13) induced the most efficient charge transport in devices, thus resulting in higher FF values.
2.4. Energy and charge transfer
To get insights into the working mechanism of the above random terpolymer-based ternary blends, the energy and charge transfer behaviors were studied (Fig. 6). Their photoluminescence (PL) was recorded by exciting the studied film with a 500 nm light source. meta-TrBRCN displayed an extremely strong PL peak at around 680 nm, whereas ITCPTC showed a low PL peak at around 850 nm. On blending meta-TrBRCN with ITCPTC, the ITCPTC:meta-TrBRCN blend film showed only one peak at around 850 nm with reduced intensity. The quenched PL of meta-TrBRCN implied an efficient FRET process from meta-TrBRCN to ITCPTC, thus lowering the radiative recombination in the device.19 Compared with meta-TrBRCN and ITCPTC pristine films, the reduced PL intensity of meta-TrBRCN:ITCPTC blend indicated that charge transfer might also occur between meta-TrBRCN and ITCPTC, which was confirmed by the curve of J–V characteristics (Fig. 6b). The higher Jsc of the meta-TrBRCN:ITCPTC-based (0.39 mA cm−2) devices than that of the meta-TrBRCN-based (0.11 mA cm−2) and the ITCPTC-based (0.16 mA cm−2) devices provided solid proof of the charge transfer between the two NFAs.35,36 Because ITCPTC had a much higher HOMO level (−5.50 eV vs. −5.95 eV) than meta-TrBRCN, the holes would transfer from meta-TrBRCN to ITCPTC. Therefore, the electrons would transfer from ITCPTC to meta-TrBRCN to guarantee an efficient charge transfer pathway. This indicated that a small LUMO offset (0.05 eV) did not provide enough charge transfer barrier for blocking the electron transfer from a lower LUMO component (ITCPTC, −3.92 eV) back to a slightly higher LUMO component (meta-TrBRCN, −3.87 eV). Such “electron-back” transfer in D:A1:A2 ternary devices is similar to the “hole-back” transfer observed in D1:D2:A ternary blend systems.19,37 Combining FRET, hole-cascade and electron-back charge transfer processes in our random terpolymer-based ternary systems could improve the energy and charge transfer efficiencies. As a result, the PL was effectively quenched in the above ternary blend films. The quenching efficiencies were estimated to be 97.8%, 98.8% and 98.3% for the PT1, PT3 and PT5-based ternary blends. Emission from the meta-TrBRCN acceptor was observed in the PT1-based devices, which might originate from the poor miscibility of meta-TrBRCN in the PT1-based ternary blend. The poor miscibility of meta-TrBRCN in the PT1-based ternary blend lowered the energy transfer from meta-TrBRCN, resulting in exciton decay to the ground state.38,39 The better miscibility of meta-TrBRCN in the PT3- and PT5-based devices promoted the energy transfer from meta-TrBRCN. The higher PL quenching efficiency of the PT3-based ternary blends indicated the more effectively suppressed charge recombination in the resulting devices than those using PT5.

2.5. Recombination dynamics
To get insights into the effects of random terpolymers and ternary blends on the charge recombination processes, the correlations between Jsc, Voc and solar light intensity (Plight) were studied.40,41 The slopes of Voc against Plight in the semi-logarithmic plots of PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blends were calculated to be 1.33, 1.16, and 1.20 kT/e, respectively, which indicated the lowest trap-assisted recombination in the PT3-based devices. In addition, the α values of the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Pαlight calculated from the logarithmic plots were 0.989, 0.997 and 0.992 for the PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based devices, respectively, implying their relatively low bimolecular recombination. The charge dissociation probability (PE,T) could be evaluated from the logarithmic plots of photocurrent density (Jph) against the internal voltage (Veff) (Fig. 7c).19,42 The PE,T values were determined to be 92.7, 95.4 and 93.1 for the PT1-, PT3- and PT5-based ternary blend devices, respectively. The lowest charge recombination and the largest PE,T of the PT3-based devices implied that they had the most efficient charge dissociation and collection, thus improving the Jsc and FF values and contributing to the best performance.

2.6. Device stability and large area devices
The device stability of OSCs is one of the main challenges for practical applications. The ternary blend strategy has been demonstrated to have a positive effect on improving stability.19 This is mainly due to the formation of a locked morphology due to the interactions of multiple compositions. To explore the stability of the random terpolymer-based ternary blend OSCs, PT3:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 devices stored in a glove box under room temperature and thermally treated at 120 °C were tested (Fig. S10, Tables S4 and S5†). The normalized photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 8a and b. As shown in Fig. 8a and S10a,† the original device performance degraded slightly quickly in the first 50 h, but still retained over 90%. Following this, the degeneration slowed down quickly, and 80% of the device performance was retained after 400 h storage. In the thermal annealing condition (120 °C) (Fig. 8b and S10b†), about 87% of the original device performance was retained after 60 min heating, which decreased to about 70% after 120 min heating, indicating good device stability.

In addition to stability, large area production is also an essential consideration for the technological implantation of OSCs. To investigate the possibility for large area application, PT3:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 ternary blend devices with a large area of 1.0 cm2 were fabricated and evaluated (Fig. 8c and d). Excitingly, a high PCE of 11.43% was realized with Voc = 0.880 V, Jsc = 18.86 mA cm−2 and FF = 68.9%. This is among the highest PCEs for large area OSCs, implying the potential for industrial printable applications.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a series of random terpolymer donors with different optical absorption bands but similar electrochemical properties were successfully used to fabricate the ternary blend NF-OSCs. By changing the molar ratio of DPP/BT (n:m), three random terpolymers, namely PT1 (n:m = 0.1/0.9), PT3 (n:m = 0.3/0.7) and PT5 (n:m = 0.5/0.5), with the main absorption ranging from 500–700 nm to 600–800 nm were systemically investigated. Furthermore, the low bandgap ITCPTC (1.58 eV) and the wide bandgap meta-TrBRCN (2.10 eV) were used as the small molecular acceptor materials in this study. By using such a random terpolymer strategy, the absorption of the ternary blends could be fine-tuned, thus maximizing the light harvesting ability. Owing to the optical variations, the PT1-based devices with low DPP/BT molar ratio exhibited higher device performance than the PT3- and PT5-based devices at higher ITCPTC:meta-TrBRCN weight ratios. However, the PT5-based devices with low DPP/BT molar ratio exhibited higher device performance than the PT1- and PT3-based devices at lower ITCPTC:meta-TrBRCN weight ratios. The PT3 devices with intermediate DPP/BT molar ratios and ITCPTC:meta-TrBRCN weight ratios achieved a more balanced absorption over a broad range. The ternary blend strategy provides more efficient energy and charge transfers via FRET, hole-cascade and electron-back mechanisms in our devices. Moreover, the fine-tuned morphology and high charge mobility of PT3:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 significantly improved the charge dissociation and transport. For the above reasons, the outstandingly enhanced Jsc (20.16 mA cm−2) and FF (76.3%) were obtained for PT3:ITCPTC0.7:meta-TrBRCN0.3 devices, resulting in a high PCE of 13.63%. The devices showed good stability with about 80% of the original PCE being retained after 400 hours storage and about 70% after 120 min heating. Furthermore, a high PCE of 11.43% could also be realized in the large area devices (1.0 cm2). Our study provides a useful approach to optimize the absorption and maximize the efficiency of NF-OSCs by integrating the synergistic effect of random terpolymers and the ternary blend device structure.
