    , Accepted 10th May 2021First published on 19th May 2021AbstractOxidized phenothiazine chromophores have received significant attention in various technological applications including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaic devices, data storage, sensors and bioimaging due to their excellent photoluminescence properties, low toxicity, easy synthetic modification, non-planar structure and environmentally friendly behavior. The oxidized phenothiazine chromophores exhibit high phosphorescence quantum yields, better photochemical and photothermal stabilities, and long-lived emission lifetimes in the solid state. The oxidized phenothiazine derivatives possess room temperature phosphorescence properties which enhance the importance of phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units and provide a new pathway for their multi-purpose applications like digital security, optical recording devices, bioimaging, sensors, organic light-emitting diodes, data storage, low-cost anti-counterfeiting technologies and temperature monitoring. In this review, we have explained the synthesis, photophysical, photoluminescence, electrochemical, theoretical and room temperature phosphorescence properties of phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide derivatives. In the current situation, the outlook of this review provides a better understanding of the significance of phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units for the development of novel materials for optoelectronic and biological applications.

1. Introduction
In the past few years, push–pull chromophores have received tremendous attention owing to their applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, sensors and data storage.1–14 The incorporation of heteroarene units in the push–pull chromophores further helps in tuning the frontier energy levels thereby improving their luminescence properties.15–20 Phenothiazine is a tricyclic heteroarene with a unique butterfly shape and is widely used as a strong electron donor unit (p-type electron donor) due to the presence of electron-rich sulfur and nitrogen atoms.21–25 A significant electron density in the phenothiazine unit is mainly localized over the sulfur atom, which makes the phenothiazine unit highly sensitive towards oxidizing agents.25–30 The sulphur atom in the phenothiazine unit exists in the sulfide state (+2 oxidation) and can be easily oxidized to sulfoxide (+4 oxidation) and sulfone (+6 oxidation) as present in the phenothiazine 5-oxide unit and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide unit, respectively (Chart 1).30–38 The change in oxidation state from sulfide (+2) to sulfoxide (+4) and sulfone (+6) in the phenothiazine unit results in a drastic change in the electronic properties of phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units. The S atom in the sulfide state renders the phenothiazine molecule as a strong electron donor, whereas the S atom in the oxidized sulfoxide (+4) and sulfone (+6) states results in a strong electron-withdrawing behavior.37,38 Due to the increase in the oxidation state from sulfide (+2) to sulfoxide (+4) and sulfone (+6), the polarity of these derivatives was improved compared to that of the phenothiazine unit. When the sulfur atom of the phenothiazine unit was oxidized to sulfoxide and sulfone states, the dihedral angle (the angle between the planes of the annulated benzo groups) slightly decreases but the structural architecture remains the same.29

Over the past few years, oxidized phenothiazine units (phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide) have emerged as an important class of luminophores due to their favorable photoluminescence, phosphorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties.39–41 There are three active sides (3-, 7- and 10-positions) in both phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units (Fig. 1), which can be easily functionalized by synthetic modification and the incorporation of strong push–pull units to extend the π-conjugation and tune the photonic properties.42,43

In 1950, Smith et al. developed a method to synthesize the oxidized phenothiazine derivatives (sulfones) by using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a strong oxidizing agent in the presence of glacial acetic acid.44 Further in 1966, Johnston et al. synthesized the sulfones by a two-step reaction, in which 2-amino-2′-nitrodiphenyl sulfone I was reacted with zinc metal to form 2,2′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone II which was further reacted with sodium hydroxide to produce phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (sulfone) as shown in Scheme 1.45
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (sulfone). 
In the presence of strong oxidizing agents, e.g., m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, sodium perborate and NaOCl, the phenothiazine unit was converted to the phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide (sulfone) as shown in Scheme 2.46–48 The phenothiazine-5-oxide (sulfoxide) was synthesized by using inorganic complexes with heavy transition metals, namely, KMnO4,49 Et3PhN(+)MnO4(−),50 and OsO4/N-methylmorpholine N-oxide,51 as shown in Scheme 3. The sulfoxides were also synthesized by using H2O2 in the presence of oxalic acid as solvent.52 There are few methods in which sulfoxides are isolated in the presence of ozone or by using electrochemical methods or CrO3/pyridine.53–55 However, synthetic procedures have certain drawbacks such as high cost, low yields and require tedious purification.

Irimie et al. introduced four new methods to synthesize the phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units as shown in Scheme 4.56 In the presence of (a) m-CPBA at 0–5 °C, or (b) mixture of fuming nitric acid and glacial acetic acid, phenothiazine gets oxidized to sulfoxide II unit. However, the reaction of phenothiazine (c) with the mixture of KMnO4, and C16H35N(CH3)3(+) Cl(−) in chloroform solution or (d) m-CPBA at room temperature resulted in sulfone III unit.

In recent years, phosphorescent materials have attracted considerable research interest in various applications such as phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes, displays, molecular sensing, anti-counterfeiting and bio-imaging due to their flexible structure, light weight and low-cost production.57–60 The phosphorescence properties were first identified in inorganic materials and some specific metal complexes; however, these inorganic materials are toxic in nature, insoluble in aqueous solutions and are costly.61–64 In comparison to these inorganic materials, organic materials with phosphorescence properties are safer to the environment and inexpensive.65–75 Phenothiazine oxide is used as an active material for organic phosphorescent materials, due to its high luminescence properties. Phenothiazine oxide derivatives also exhibit ultra-long organic phosphorescence (UOP) and persistent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties.39–43 This review provides a detailed analysis of the structural modification of phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide luminogens by using various donor and acceptor units to modulate the photonic and photoluminescence properties. This review also explains the challenging research field, room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) shown by phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units, and their applications as hole transporting materials, OLEDs and biological materials.
2. Properties
2.1. Luminescence properties
The organic luminogens having high fluorescence and phosphorescence properties are considered as best emitter materials for OLEDs owing to the following properties: low-cost fabrication, less toxicity, high quantum yields, long excited-state lifetimes up to milliseconds and easy synthetic modification as compared to inorganic materials. Hetero atoms (B, N, S, P, etc.) as well as halo atoms (Cl, Br, I) based luminogens have been utilized as emitting materials for LEDs. These luminogens are used in optoelectronic devices, biosensors and many other applications. The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide substituted chromophores are considered as efficient materials for OLEDs due to their high quantum yields and long excited-state lifetimes. The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide derivatives linked with donor–acceptor units are shown in Chart 2.

Ma and co-workers have synthesized a novel push–pull organic luminogen 1 by the oxidation reaction followed by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 5) and explored its electroluminescence properties.76 The luminogen 1 showed four absorption bands wherein the first two absorption bands at 266 nm and 288 nm are due to the carbazole unit, while the absorption band at 349 nm corresponds to the fluorene unit and the band at 374 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition. The luminogen 1 exhibited a sharp emission peak at 406 nm and 418 nm in solution and solid state, respectively. The luminogen 1 showed good thermal stability in the range of 393–434 °C. The phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-substituted derivative 1 exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of around 1.2% with CIE coordinates of (0.21, 0.19) in the electroluminescence studies, which may be due to the better extended π-conjugation in the push–pull chromophores.

Taraphde et al. further developed a series of phenothiazine 5-oxide functionalized derivatives (2–13) in which electron donor and acceptor were used as end-capping units to enhance the π-conjugation and tune the photophysical properties.77 The chromophores 2–13 were synthesized by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of 3,7-dibromo-10-alkyl/aryl-10H-phenothiazine-5-oxides with arylboronic acids (donor- and acceptor-based boronic acids) as shown in Scheme 6. The chromophores 2–10 exhibit yellow or greenish yellow color in the solid state. The absorption spectra of 2–13 showed a shoulder peak at 303 nm and the major peak with absorption maxima (λmax) at 326–357 nm, in which chromophores 8 and 11 exhibited intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions with a red-shift compared to others due to the presence of electron-withdrawing units at the terminal position.
 Scheme 6  Synthetic routes of phenothiazine 5-oxide-based push–pull chromophores 2–13. 
The derivatives 2–13 exhibited blue and blue-green emission with a large Stokes’ shift in solution; however, the chromophore 8 was non-emissive in nature due to the presence of nitro group which acts as a fluorescence quencher. The naphthyl unit-substituted chromophore 13 showed a blue-shift compared to others due to the twisted structure confirmed from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All the chromophores 2–13 are emissive in nature in the solid state. The emission maxima of all derivatives in the solid state showed a bathochromic shift as compared to the solution state, which may be due to the intermolecular interactions in the solid state confirmed by single-crystal X-ray studies. In the solid state 2–7, 9, 10, 12 and 13 show blue emission, whereas 8 and 11 show blue-green emission. By using the m-nitrophenyl/p-cyanophenyl as electron-withdrawing units, the derivatives 8 and 11 showed push–pull behavior with strong ICT properties.
Thermal gravimetric analysis at 5% weight loss demonstrated that chromophores 2–13 showed better thermal stability in the range of 194–306 °C. DFT calculations showed that the derivatives 8 and 11 showed a low HOMO–LUMO gap compared to others due to the presence of electron-withdrawing units which may be suitable for optoelectronic applications.
Taking into account the effective pull–push properties of the m-nitrophenyl/p-cyanophenyl-substituted derivatives, Taraphde et al. further designed and synthesized a series of acceptor-substituted sulfoxide derivatives with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structural configuration by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, in which the phenothiazine-5-oxide was used as a central building block and different acceptors were used as end-capping units as shown in Scheme 7.78 The luminogens 14–21 exhibited two different absorption bands around 305–308 nm and 328–355 nm, in which the absorption band in the lower wavelength region corresponds to the π–π* transition and the absorption band in the higher wavelength region is attributed to the ICT transition. In chloroform solution (at 1 × 10−5 M concentration), luminogens 14–21 exhibited yellow color fluorescence in the range of 403–429 nm with a large Stokes’ shift in the range of 4459–6016 cm−1. However, the benzonitrile- and thiazoline ring-substituted luminogens 17 and 21 showed emission bands with higher intensity at 426 and 423 nm, whereas the fluorine-substituted luminogen 15 showed a blue-shifted emission at 403 nm with low intensity, which may be due to the non-planar structure as compared to other derivatives. In the presence of –COCH3 unit, the luminogen 14 exhibited the highest quantum yield of around 0.31 in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) as compared to other derivatives (15. 0.02, 16. 0.18 17. 0.25 18. 0.12 19. 0.20 20. 0.17 and 21. 0.22). All the chromophores 14–21 exhibited strong emission spectra in the solid state and showed a bathochromic shift as compared to the solution state. The chromophore 14 exhibited three emission peaks in the violet-blue-orange region at 419, 467 and 622 nm, whereas chromophore 19 showed spectra in the violet-green-orange region at 402, 522 and 610 nm.

On the other hand, chromophores 15 and 20 exhibited dual fluorescence in the blue-green region. The theoretical calculations and crystal studies revealed that the N-aryl-substituted push–pull derivatives (19, 20) exhibited planar geometries compared to the N-alkyl unit in the A–D–A molecules due to better orbital overlap and stabilization through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions.
Chitta and co-workers have designed and synthesized two phenothiazine (PTZ)–borondipyrromethene (BODIPY)-substituted push–pull derivatives for the detection of hypochlorite unit as shown in Scheme 8.79 In the presence of hypochlorite, the oxidation state of the sulfur atom in the phenothiazine unit gets converted to sulfoxide(IV) and sulfone(VI) states, which is further explained in detail by the photophysical studies and ESI-MS analysis. The phenothiazine (PTZ)–borondipyrromethene (BODIPY)-substituted push–pull derivative I showed three absorption bands around 204 nm, 262 nm, and 316 nm corresponding to the phenothiazine unit and two more absorption bands at 234 nm and 516 nm attributed to the BODIPY unit. The addition of NaOCl to the solution resulted in a new absorption band, which showed a bathochromic shift of 8 nm with a hypochromic shift of 50%, indicating the formation of a new oxidized product. The emission spectra explained that when NaOCl was added to the solution, the oxidized product exhibited intense emission spectra at 510 nm.
 Scheme 8  Synthetic routes of BODIPY-based phenothiazine 5-oxide- and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-based push–pull chromophores 22 and 23. 
In the mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS analysis), upon the addition of 1 eq. of NaOCl in the push–pull derivative I, it showed a peak at m/z 537.0312, which corresponds to the molecular ion peak of [i + O = 22]+ as the sulfoxide product, whereas the addition of an excess amount of (3 eq.) NaOCl showed peaks at m/z 553.0314 and 576.1591, which were attributed to the sulfone [i + 2O = 23]+ and a sodium adduct of sulfone [i + 2O + Na]+, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. The theoretical studies explained that the HOMO energy levels of sulfoxide 22 (−5.87 eV) and sulfone 23 (−6.16 eV) are lowered compared to those of sulfides which resulted in a decreased photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process leading to the restoration of the fluorescence of the BODIPY moiety.

Wei and co-workers have explored two blue phosphorescent host materials in which the phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide moiety was used as a central core, carbazole as an end-capping unit and two different alkyl units were used to improve the film-forming properties.80 The luminogens 24 and 25 were synthesized by a four-step reaction, in which the intermediate II was synthesized by an alkylation reaction. The alkylated intermediate II in the reaction with NBS solution forms the intermediate III, which was oxidized to intermediate IV in the presence of an oxidizing agent H2O2 and the final derivatives 24 and 25 were synthesized by the C–N coupling reaction as shown in Scheme 9. The photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties of the chromophores 24 and 25 were systematically investigated. The photophysical studies explained that both the luminogens 24 and 25 showed two absorption bands in the UV-vis region, in which the absorption band in the lower wavelength region around 236 nm corresponds to the π → π* transition and the band in the higher wavelength region at 295 nm is attributed to the n → π* transition. The chromophores 24 and 25 showed emission bands in the blue fluorescence region at 408 nm which may be due to the identical structural configuration. Similarly, the fluorescence quantum efficiency (Φ) values of 24 (62.5%) and 25 (59.7%) were close to each other due to the similar structure. The phosphorescence studies explained that 24 and 25 exhibited strong emission bands at 440 nm and 439 nm, due to the strong push–pull interactions in the π-conjugated system. Both 24 and 25 showed high thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) at 409 °C and 396 °C having HOMO (−5.63 and −5.64 eV) and LUMO (−2.31 eV and −2.32 eV) energy levels, respectively. The luminophores 24 and 25 are better bipolar host materials for the phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) due to their excellent photoluminescence and thermal properties.

2.2. Ultralong organic phosphorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties
In recent years, luminescent materials with efficient solid-state emissions are considered as active building blocks for the development of advanced materials for optoelectronic applications.81 The phosphorescence properties were normally identified in the solution state under inert conditions and cryogenic temperatures. However, in the last few years, room temperature phosphorescence properties have been identified in limited organic materials in the solid state. In 1978, Bilen et al. reported pure organic materials for the first time, which showed RTP properties.82 In the literature, few organic chromophores with features like hydrogen bonding, halo atom interactions and intermolecular π–π stacking interactions showed phosphorescence properties to a greater extent.70 The inorganic materials and transition-metal complexes showed strong phosphorescence behavior with long lifetimes up to milliseconds due to the presence of the d–pπ bond; however, it would be a real challenge to incorporate the d–pπ bond in organic chromophores to explore the phosphorescence properties.83 To confirm this postulate, the organic chromophores with phenothiazine units (shown in Fig. 3) were preferred as ideal models to develop several luminogen materials.

The chromophores 26 and 27 were synthesized by a two-step reaction, in which phenothiazine was reacted with benzoyl chloride and acetyl chloride, respectively, resulting in intermediate chromophores II and III (Scheme 10), which underwent oxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide to give final products 26 and 27 in good yields of 77% and 86%, respectively.84 The chromophore 26 showed two absorption bands in which the absorption band in the lower wavelength region around 230 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition and the absorption band in the higher wavelength region around 303 nm corresponds to the n–π* transition, whereas the chromophore 27 showed two major absorption bands, in which the absorption peak at 230 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition and the absorption peak around 290–300 nm corresponds to the n–π* transition. The chromophore 27 exhibited an additional shoulder peak around 240–260 nm.
 Scheme 10  Synthetic routes of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-based push–pull chromophores 26 and 27. 
The chromophores 26 and 27 showed a blue-shift compared to the starting materials II and III due to the greater impact of the sulfonyl group on the excited states of luminogens. The chromophore 26 showed intense fluorescence emission spectra around 353 nm and a relatively low-intensity phosphorescence peak around 400–510 nm due to the low quantum yield of 3.6%. The chromophore 26 showed phosphorescence bands at 435 and 490 nm with different lifetimes (234 ms and 455 ms, respectively), suggesting that they are likely to be produced by different excited states, whereas chromophore 27 showed dual emissions in-between 460 and 600 nm with almost equal intensity. The phosphorescence studies clarified that the lifetime of 26 (455 ms, quantum yield = 3.6%) showed a huge enhancement of up to 19 times compared to that of the starting material II (24 ms, quantum yield = 7.1%), as shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, the acetyl-functionalized chromophore 27 showed a long lifetime of up to 876 ms and a better quantum yield of 8.2% in the phosphorescence studies. The phosphorescence result of chromophores 26 and 27 showed a new pathway to enhance the phosphorescence lifetimes and presented a valuable scope for the design and synthesis of new phosphorescent materials.

Li and co-workers have designed and synthesized a series of phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide-based luminogens which showed room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties.85 They investigated in detail the molecular structures of these luminogens and explained the persistent RTP properties through strong π–π interactions in the solid state. The phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide-based luminogens 28–34 were synthesized by the C–N coupling reaction followed by the oxidation reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide which is shown in Scheme 11. The photophysical and PL studies explained that the luminogens 28–34 showed three absorption bands around 275 nm, 300 nm, and 330 nm and two emission peaks at 390 nm and 405 nm, respectively. In the luminogens 28–34, the substitution of strong electron-withdrawing substituents (Br, Cl, and F atoms) at the 10-position in the phenyl ring would reduce the electron density of the phenyl ring via inductive effects and stabilize the T1* state by enhancing the π–π interactions in-between the neighboring units while other luminogens (28, 29 and 30) with electron-donating substituents (CH3, H and CH3O) exhibited more π–π repulsion. The RTP effect of luminogens 28–34 reveals that the luminogens of 31, 32 and 33 showed longest RTP lifetimes of 268 ms, 256 ms and 410 ms, whereas luminogens 28 and 29 with electron-donating substituents exhibited the shortest RTP lifetimes of 88 ms and 96 ms, as shown in Fig. 5. The luminogen 34 showed no RTP effect in the single crystal, although it contains the trifluoromethyl unit as the stronger electron-withdrawing unit attached to the 10-phenyl ring.

However, the RTP effect was observed for the same chromophore 34 (the trifluoromethyl unit attached to the 10-phenyl ring) under the UV irradiation for 5 min, in which the RTP lifetime was increased up to 299 ms and it came back to its initial stage after several hours. For the first time, they have developed this new phenomenon and termed it as photoinduced room temperature phosphorescence.
Li and co-workers have also reported five organic luminogens 35–40 and explored their RTP properties.86 The luminogens 35–40 (Chart 3) were synthesized by the C–N coupling reaction, followed by the oxidation reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as shown in Scheme 12. The RTP studies of all these derivatives explained that the odd alkyl substituent derivatives 35 (245 ms), 37 (327 ms) and 39 (205 ms) exhibited longer RTP lifetimes compared to those of even alkyl substituent derivatives 36 (92 ms) and 38 (181 ms) shown in Fig. 6. Their photophysical studies demonstrated that each luminogen exhibited similar absorption spectra in THF solution with three major bands at 270 nm, 295 nm and 335 nm due to the similar electronic structure. Furthermore, there were two major emission peaks observed around 390 nm and 405 nm for each luminogen in the phosphorescence studies. The RTP studies explained that each luminogen showed a small variation, in the range of 246–273 ms, in the solution state. However, in the case of solid state, the RTP emission bands and the corresponding lifetimes were completely different from each other. The experimental results explained that the molecular packing in the solid state is a key factor to alter the RTP properties and excluded the role of various substituent effects on electronic properties. The single-crystal analysis provided more details about the importance of alkyl substituents on molecular packing and how it alters the RTP behavior through the odd–even effect. In the single-crystal analysis, it was revealed that the π–π interactions, π–π distances and π–π overlapping are the major factors in molecular packing. The odd alkyl-substituted chromophores 35 and 37 showed better molecular arrangements with strong π–π interactions between the two neighboring phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide groups and the π–π distances between the neighboring units were as short as 3.59 Å and 3.70 Å, which confirmed their longest RTP lifetimes of 245 ms and 327 ms. Due to this close molecular packing in 35 and 37, their triplet exciton may be stabilized in the ultralong RTP effect. In the case of even alkyl substituents 36 (92 ms) and 38 (181 ms), disordered molecular arrangements were observed compared to odd alkyl substituents 35 and 37. The π–π interactions are the important factor to tune the ultralong RTP properties. Luminogen 37 was used in in vitro and in vivo studies due to its stronger RTP emission compared to others and clearly visible in living mice with a low background noise, which is a great plus point of organic luminogens used in in vivo imaging due to their higher ultralong lifetimes. These RTP properties explained that without introducing any donor and acceptor units in the π-conjugated system of luminophores, the RTP lifetimes can be easily altered by varying the alkyl units on the N-position.

In the literature, RTP was recognized in some selective molecules in which the molecular dimer packing plays a crucial role in the crystal state.87,88 However, the relationship between the molecular dimer packing in the crystal state and the RTP emission was unclear. Li and co-workers have explained more clearly the role of molecular dimer behavior in the room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) study by considering an active luminogen derivative 41.43 The investigation on the singlet excimer emission and the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) studies give clear information about the whole RTP process. The luminogen 41 was synthesized by the C–N coupling reaction followed by the oxidation reaction as shown in Scheme 13. In Fig. 7A, the fluorescence spectra of 41 showed two different emission spectra around 405 nm and 505 nm in the crystal state, whereas in the ground state (dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF)), and doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), showed single emission spectra around 420 nm due to the elimination of intermolecular interactions in both the ground state and the doped state. Similarly, in the RTP studies, luminogen 41 showed a single peak at 430 nm with two shoulder peaks at 460 nm and 490 nm in the solid state (Fig. 7C), whereas in the case of ground and doped states, there was no phosphorescence peak observed in the range of 400–600 nm. The intensities of both bands in the ground and doped states were completely negligible compared to the crystal state emission spectra due to the elimination of intermolecular interactions in both states which confirmed that the intermolecular interactions played a major role in phosphorescence emission. The emission spectra at the long wavelength around 505 nm should be the major factor for the visual blue-shifted afterglow of luminogen 41. In the case of TADF studies, the authors observed two emissions in which the first emission at the short wavelength of around 405–420 nm with an average lifetime (τFs) of about 1 μs corresponds to the monomer-dominated emission (F1) and the second emission at 505 nm with a longer average lifetime of around 10.6 μs was attributed to the singlet excimer emission (F2), as shown in Fig. 7B. The singlet excimer emission and TADF studies on luminogen 41 demonstrated that the room temperature phosphorescence was dominated by the monomer emission, instead of the triplet excimer (Fig. 8).

2.3. Perovskite solar cells
The organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have evolved as renewable and alternative energy sources. In the past few years, perovskite solar cells have gained major attention due to the increase in power conversion efficiencies from 3.8% to 24.2%.89 The power conversion efficiencies were enhanced by introducing new hole transporting materials in the perovskite solar cells. Recently, in the perovskite solar cells, Spiro-OMeTAD and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) are most commonly used as active materials due to their high hole transporting properties.90,91 However, the large-scale production of both derivatives, Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, is not cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to develop a new derivative which is highly efficient compared to Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA and is of low cost. More recently, phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide was used as an n-type building block in the donor–acceptor systems due to its electron-withdrawing properties. Phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide unit is an electron-deficient tricyclic heteroarene with a non-planar structure due to the presence of powerful sulfone heteroatom. In the literature, 3-,7- and N-positions of the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide can be easily functionalized by substituting the various donor and acceptor units to tune the chemical and photophysical properties and the HOMO–LUMO energy levels. Phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide can be easily synthesized by the one-step oxidation of phenothiazine (PTZ) (6$ per kg) with hydrogen peroxide.
Cheng et al. have developed two low-cost hole transporting materials, 42 and 43, for perovskite solar cells in which phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide was used as a central core, anisole and 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine were substituted at N-positions and 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine was used as the end group (Chart 4).39 The chromophores 42 and 43 were synthesized through a four-step reaction, in which the intermediates II and VI were synthesized by the C–N coupling reaction (Buchwald–Hartwig reaction). In the presence of NBS, the intermediates II and VI underwent radical substitution reactions to form brominated derivatives III and VII. In the presence of H2O2, intermediates IV and VIII were synthesized. In the last step, the products 42 and 43 were synthesized by the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction as shown in Scheme 14. The cost calculated for both HTMs (42 = 62.1791$ per g and 43 = 61.2761$ per g) were much lower compared to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (170–475$). The chromophores 42 and 43 showed two major absorption bands in the range of 250–450 nm in which the ICT band was observed at around 350 nm. The electrochemical studies demonstrated that the HOMO energy levels (−5.25 and −5.24 eV vs. vacuum) for both derivatives were quite similar and showed good agreement with the valence band (perovskite solar cells) for hole transport. The above result explained that the N-substitution has a negligible impact on HOMO energy levels.

 Scheme 14  Synthetic routes of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-based push–pull chromophores 42 and 43. 
They roughly estimated the LUMO energy levels (−2.67 and −2.35 eV vs. vacuum) for the chromophores 42 and 43 by considering both the electrochemical and the photophysical data, which are high enough for electron blocking. The phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide moiety was found as a twisted butterfly and planar conformation with the monoclinic space groups C2/c and I2/a in 42 and 43, respectively.
The optimized molecular structures for both derivatives are in good agreement with the crystal structure. The density functional theory calculations explained that the substitution of anisole and 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine at the N-position has no effect on charge distribution. For both derivatives 42 and 43, the electron density of the HOMO energy level was delocalized on the whole molecule, while the electron density of the LUMO energy level was mainly localized on the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide unit shown in Fig. 10. The device based on 42 and 43 as the HTMs showed a PCE of 16.7% and 20.2%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 9).

2.4. OLEDs and TADF OLEDs
In 1987, Tang et al. reported the organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) by utilizing the metal complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3) as a fluorescent material.92 Due to the presence of fluorescent emission properties in Alq3 materials, 75% of the triplet excitons could not be utilized for organic light-emitting diodes and only 25% of the singlet excitons can be used for fluorescent OLEDs which means that the theoretically calculated maximum internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of a fluorescent OLED is 25%. To overcome these drawbacks, phosphorescent metal complexes have been introduced as novel luminescent materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) which is four times better than that of fluorescent materials (25%). Phosphorescent heavy metal complexes Ru(II), Ir(III), Os(II), and Pt(II) were used as promising materials in PhOLEDs due to their highly emissive properties, better stability, excellent electroluminescence efficiency and a good phosphorescence quantum yield (Φp).93 However, these heavy metals have the lowest abundance on earth and are expensive and toxic. Therefore, in recent years, pure organic phosphorescent materials are introduced as new alternatives for OLEDs and TADF OLEDs due to their important benefits compared to fluorescent materials.94
Important benefits of RTP materials:
(1) Easy synthetic modification.
(2) Higher phosphorescence quantum yields.
(3) Easy tuning of the photonic and electronic properties by using the push–pull systems in the π-conjugated system.
(4) RTP materials show a longer decay lifetime up to milliseconds to seconds compared to fluorescent materials (micro or nanoseconds).
(5) Phosphorescence spectra show a red-shift compared to fluorescence spectra because T1 showed a lower energy level compared to S1.
(6) RTP materials show a broad Stokes’ shift in phosphorescence spectra as compared to fluorescence spectra due to the intersystem crossing between two different spin states (S1 and T1).
(7) RTP materials showed excellent phosphorescence properties with a longer decay lifetime in the solid state at room temperature, while no phosphorescence was observed in the solution state.
The phenothiazine oxides (sulfoxides and sulfones) are recently used as active luminescent materials in OLEDs due to their high quantum yields, reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and better singlet–triplet exciton annihilation (STA) and triplet–triplet exciton annihilation (TTA). Su and co-workers have designed and synthesized two bipolar isomeric chromophores 44 and 45, in which phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole was used as the electron-withdrawing unit and phenothiazine dioxide was used as the electron-donating unit (Chart 5). The chromophores 44 and 45 were synthesized by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 15).40 The photophysical studies explained that both derivatives 44 and 45 exhibited three absorption peaks at 262 nm, 341 nm, 365 nm and 264 nm, 335 nm, 363 nm in chloroform solution, respectively. In the solid state, 44 and 45 exhibited three absorption bands in the UV-vis region at 270 nm, 353 nm, 370 nm and 259 nm, 339 nm, 368 nm, respectively. The PL spectra of both derivatives 44 and 45 exhibited single emission at 510 nm and 508 nm in the solution state, respectively. The isomeric chromophores show quite similar emission spectra. The optical band gaps estimated for 44 and 45 are 2.98 eV and 2.93 eV, respectively.
 Scheme 15  Synthetic routes of 44 and 45. 
In dilute dichloromethane (DCM) solution (10−5 mol L−1), the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 44 and 45 were 0.9 and 0.86, respectively, whereas in the solid state, the PLQYs (calculated by using an integrating sphere under air conditions) of 44 and 45 were found to be up to 0.71 and 0.68, respectively. In the solid state, the PLQY was slightly reduced, which maybe due to the twisted structure, which reduces the intermolecular π–π stacking efficiently. Both 44 and 45 showed solvatochromic properties with a bathochromic shift of 121 nm and 90 nm, respectively, from nonpolar solvent hexane to high polar solvent DMF. In the electrochemical studies, the HOMO energy levels calculated for 44 and 45 were −5.62 eV and −5.67 eV, respectively, and the LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −2.72 eV and −2.67 eV, respectively. The chromophores 44 and 45 were used as a blue emitter and the host for a yellow phosphorescent emitter to formulate white organic light-emitting diodes with power efficiencies of 49.5 and 53.4 lm W−1, current efficiencies of 44.2 and 47.6 cd A−1 and external quantum efficiencies of 14.4% and 15.6%, respectively.
 Chart 5  Chemical structure of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-based push–pull derivatives 44–54. 
Lee et al. further explored the phenothiazine dioxide-based three push–pull derivatives 46, 47 and 48 and used them as host materials for blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes due to high triplet energy.41 The chromophore 46 was synthesized by the direct coupling reaction of the phenothiazine dioxide unit and dicarbazolylphenyl unit I, whereas the other two derivatives 47 and 48 were synthesized by the coupling reaction of the two units via a phenyl linker unit through the meta and para positions (Scheme 16). The photophysical studies of 46, 47 and 48 explained that all these derivatives showed four absorption bands in the UV-vis region. The luminogen 46 showed absorption bands at 219 nm, 230 nm, 289 nm and 323 nm, whereas the other two derivatives 47 and 48 showed quite similar spectra at 216 nm, 233 nm, 289 nm and 334 nm. In the solid-state PL studies, the derivatives 46, 47 and 48 showed single emission spectra at 348 nm, 372 nm, and 370 nm, respectively, in which 47 and 48 showed emission peaks at the longer wavelength compared to 46 due to the presence of the aromatic phenyl linker. The phosphorescence studies explained that the derivatives 46, 47 and 48 showed emission bands at 416 (2.98 eV), 416 (2.98 eV) and 455 nm (2.72 eV), respectively.
 Scheme 16  Synthetic routes of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-based push–pull chromophores 46, 47 and 48. 
The theoretical calculations explained that the HOMO energy levels of 46, 47 and 48 were localized on the electron-rich dicarbazolylphenyl moiety, whereas the LUMO energy levels were localized on the phenothiazine dioxide unit for 46 and the phenyl spacer unit for 47 and 48. The theoretical results demonstrated that the phenyl spacer has a greater influence on the LUMO energy levels for 47 and 48. The electrochemical studies explained that the HOMO–LUMO gap of 47 (3.29 eV) and 48 (3.29 eV) was decreased compared to that of 46 (3.49 eV) due to the presence of the phenyl spacer unit which improves the π-conjugation. The thermal studies explained that the presence of the phenothiazine dioxide unit and rigid dicarbazole phenyl unit enhances the thermal stability and fulfills their requirement for host materials.
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies explained that the host materials showed Tg values of 161 °C, 170 °C, and 186 °C for 46, 47 and 48 derivatives, respectively. In the device fabrication, 46, 47 and 48 were used as host materials in blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The results of the device performance explained that the chromophore 47 exhibited higher values for both hole and electron current densities compared to those of derivatives 46 and 48. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) explained that the host material 47-based device exhibited 24.3% of the maximum EQE, whereas the other two host materials showed a lower value of 16.9% for 46 and 9.4% for 48. A higher EQE value was achieved for 47 due to the high triplet energy and balanced carrier density.
Wang et al. designed and synthesized a chromophore 49 in which 10-phenyl-10H-phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide was used as an electron acceptor and phenoxazine as an electron donor for the TADF studies.95 The chromophore 49 was synthesized by a three-step reaction in which the intermediate II was synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. In the presence of H2O2, intermediate II was further oxidized to intermediate III. In the final step, the chromophore 49 was synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig reaction in a good yield of 90.2%, as shown in Scheme 17. The photophysical studies explained that the push–pull derivative 49 showed three absorption bands in which the absorption bands around 304 nm and 324 nm correspond to the phenothiazine oxide moiety and π–π* transition on the phenoxazine moieties, whereas the absorption band at 380 nm corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer transition. In the solid state, a stronger intramolecular charge transfer transition was observed and the optical band gap value for the push–pull derivative 49 was 2.78 eV. The chromophore 49 exhibited an emission band at 486 nm in toluene and in the neat film at 512 nm.
 Scheme 17  Synthesis routes of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-based chromophore 49. 
The chromophore 49 showed excellent thermal stability due to a high decomposition temperature (Td) of 373 °C. The electron density of HOMO was mainly localized on the phenoxazine unit (as donor) and the LUMO on the phenothiazine oxide moiety (as acceptor). The TD-DFT calculations indicate that the energy gap (ΔEST) between S1 and T1 is around 0.03, which supports the effective reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from T1 to S1. The chromophore showed π–π stacking in-between the phenoxazine units and showed multiple C–H⋯π and C–H⋯O interactions in the single-crystal studies, which could lock intramolecular motions, and significantly depress nonradiative decay and improve the emission efficiency for non-doped devices. The non-doped TADF OLED devices based on 49 showed a high maximum EQE, CE and PE of 16.4%, 44.9 cd A−1 and 32.0 lm W−1, respectively, whereas the doped devices based on 49 showed a maximum EQE, CE and PE of 16.3%, 43.8 cd A−1 and 35.2 lm W−1, respectively (Table 2). The outstanding performance of non-doped devices indicates that the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide moiety can be used as a novel material for TADF and aggregation-induced delayed fluorescent (AIDF) materials.

Wang et al. reported three more derivatives 50, 51 and 52 with the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide unit after obtaining good results for chromophore 49 in TADF and AIDF devices. They designed and synthesized the chromophores 50, 51 and 52 in which the 10-position of the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide unit was functionalized with 9-phenyl-9H-carbazole (PhCz) and 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DMAc) to be explored as host materials with blue, green and yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs.96 The push–pull chromophores 50 and 51 were synthesized by three- and four-step reactions in which the intermediates II and V were synthesized by the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. The intermediates III and V were reacted with the phenothiazine unit through the C–N coupling to produce intermediates IV and VI which were oxidized in the presence of H2O2 to form the final products 50 and 51 (shown in Scheme 18). The chromophore 52 was synthesized by a three-step reaction in which intermediate IX was synthesized by the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. In the second step, oxidation reaction took place and in the final step, intermediate X was reacted with the phenothiazine unit by the C–N coupling reaction to form 52. The HOMO energy levels for derivatives 50, 51 and 52 are −5.72 eV, −5.78 eV and −5.40 eV and the LUMO energy levels are −2.37 eV, −2.32 eV and −1.91 eV, respectively. Due to the presence of a better donor (dimethylacridine) unit in the push–pull chromophore 52, its HOMO energy level is much higher than that of others which helps reducing the carrier injection barrier. The photophysical studies explained that the push–pull chromophores 50 and 51 exhibited similar absorption bands in the UV region in which the absorption bands with higher intensity at 290 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition, whereas the absorption band at 330 nm corresponds to the n–π* transition. The push–pull chromophore 52 showed the π–π* transition at 316 nm and the n–π* transition at 331 nm which was red-shifted as compared to the other derivatives 50 and 51. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra in toluene solution explained that the push–pull chromophores 50 and 51 exhibited three emission spectra at 355 nm, 371 nm, 486 nm and 344 nm, 359 nm, 443 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the chromophore 52 showed single emission around 382 nm. The TD-DFT calculations for 50, 51 and 52 showed theoretical singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) of 0.69 eV, 0.73 eV and 0.13 eV, respectively. Compared to 50 and 51, the chromophore 52 exhibited a small ΔEST value of 0.13 eV, which enhanced the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process for TADF and boosted the energy transfer from the host to the dopant. The chromophores 50 and 51 have no TADF characteristics due to the large ΔEST value, whereas chromophore 52 performed better as a host material for TADF dopants due to the low ΔEST value. Due to the presence of bipolar properties, chromophore 52 was used as a host material for TADF emitters. In the blue-emitting diodes, chromophore 52 showed a maximum EQE, CE and PE of 18.3%, 33.3 cd A−1 and 37.4 lm W−1, respectively. Similarly, in the case of green-emitting diodes, chromophore 52 showed a maximum EQE, CE and PE of 18.6%, 49.1 cd A−1 and 47.2 lm W−1, respectively. However, in the case of yellow-emitting diodes, chromophore 52 showed a high maximum EQE, CE and PE of 19.1%, 59.2 cd A−1 and 66.0 lm W−1, respectively (Table 2). These results from device fabrication explained the potential of phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as a new pathway for host materials in a sequence of color TADF-OLEDs.

Bochmann and co-workers have synthesized a series of copper- and gold-functionalized “carbene–metal–amide” (CMA) complexes, to explore the emission behavior through the conformational changes in which heterocyclic amide units were used as ligands.97 The phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-substituted copper- and gold-functionalized complexes 53 and 54 were synthesized by a mixture of adamantyl-substituted cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands of CuCl and AuCl with 10H-phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide and NaOtBu in dry tetrahydrofuran as a solution under argon atmosphere as shown in Scheme 19. The photophysical studies explained that the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-substituted copper and gold complexes 53 and 54 showed two absorption bands in THF solution in which the absorption band in the lower wavelength region corresponds to the π–π* transition, which is related to an intra-ligand (IL) transition of the CAAC carbene, and the absorption band in the higher wavelength region corresponds to the ligand-to-ligand charge transfer with a minor contribution of the metal orbitals according to the DFT calculations. The emission spectra of the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-substituted copper- and gold-functionalized complexes 53 and 54 were examined in toluene solution which explained that the gold complex of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (54) showed high emissive nature compared to the copper complex 53. The theoretical calculations described that due to the lower coefficient value of oscillator strength for the S1 → S0 transition, and a small involvement of the metal orbitals in the LUMO orbital, the copper complex exhibited low emission than the gold complex. Due to this reason, the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-substituted gold complex 54 exhibited the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 89.6% in toluene compared to the copper complex 53 (49.5% in toluene). The gold complex 54 exhibited mechanochromic properties due to the presence of two different types of crystals, in which the monoclinic system exhibited a sky-blue emission at 475 nm, whereas the orthorhombic system emitted a warm-white light (30% photoluminescence quantum yields) with two emission peaks in which the emission maxima (λem) was observed at 540 nm and a low-intensity peak was observed at 475 nm, as shown in Fig. 11. These two crystal systems were slightly different due to their folding angles of the amide ligand. The phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide-substituted gold complex 54 with the orthorhombic crystal system showed very fragile behavior and emitted a sky-blue light if broken. After grinding the orthorhombic crystals, it showed a blue-shift of 0.32 eV and the major emission spectra in the lower wavelength region disappeared and new emission spectra appeared which were similar to the emission spectra of the monoclinic form. The theoretical calculations, and the PL and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies provided more details about the importance of heterocyclic ligands. The results explained that the gold-substituted phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide complex 54 exhibited mechanochromic behavior from sky-blue to warm-white and was also used as the first example of CMA complexes for white light-emitting OLEDs.

The electroluminescence properties of the gold-substituted phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide complex 54 showed an unstable behavior in the thermal vapor deposition method but the fabrication of the solution-processed OLEDs was quite stable with the device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/TFB (10 nm)/PVK or CBP with 20%wt 54 (40 nm)/TPBi (70 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/54 (100 nm showed sky-blue color), but in the presence of the poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) host material, the chromophore 54 exhibited emission spectra, which were quickly (<1 s) broadened and changed to warm-white EL. In these device systems, the authors achieved external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 5.8% and 4.6% for 54 in PVK and CBP hosts, respectively.
2.5. Biosensors
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are present in mitochondria, which play a crucial role in the elimination of unwanted xenobiotics. However, excess amount of ROS is hazardous to mitochondria due to the undesirable oxidation of biomolecules. In the ROS, the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) and hypochlorite ion ClO− behave as highly reactive species.98,99 They cause serious damage to many biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids due to their strong oxidant properties. The excessive amount of ˙OH and ClO− can damage the cell and lead to various diseases. Due to this reason, reactive oxygen species are considered a serious concern owing to their high reactivity. Thus, the detection of ˙OH and ClO− species is highly essential to avoid the serious damage of cells. Many organic derivatives are used to identify the ˙OH and ClO− species through sensitive and selective methods. Phenothiazine-substituted chromophores are mostly used for the identification of ˙OH and ClO− species because phenothiazine is a heteroatom-based donor unit which contains sulfur and nitrogen atoms, which are electron-rich in nature. Due to this reason, the maximum electron cloud density of the phenothiazine unit is mainly concentrated over the sulfur atom. The sulphur atom in the thiazine ring is highly sensitive towards the ˙OH and ClO− species. Xu and coworkers have synthesized a phenothiazine-substituted cyanine chromophore 55,100 which was used for the detection of the mitochondrial ˙OH in live cells. Cyanine derivative 55 was used as a ratiometric absorbant as well as a fluorescent “turn-on” sensor for the identification of ˙OH species (Scheme 20). The photophysical studies explained that the cyanine derivative 55 exhibited two absorption bands at 380 and 550 nm in water.

On the addition of ˙OH species, the absorption band of the cyanine chromophore 55 was gradually decreased and new absorption bands were generated at 350 nm and 470 nm due to the formation of a new emissive sulfoxide chromophore 56 (Chart 6) as shown in Fig. 12. The oxidation of the cyanine chromophore 55 was confirmed by NMR, MS and HPLC analyses. The oxidized derivative 56 showed two emission peaks excited at 350 nm and one emission peak excited at 450 nm. The derivative 55 showed a positive response towards the ˙OH species in both biological studies (in vitro and in vivo) and gave a new pathway to overcome the issues of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

3. Conclusion and outlook
The phenothiazine oxide derivatives, namely, phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide derivatives, have emerged as an important class of luminogens in organic electronics due to their vast array of structural modifications. The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide derivatives have major reactive sites of 3-, 7- and N-positions which allow several synthetic modifications to develop phenothiazine oxide-based push–pull systems which can be employed in a wide range of optoelectronic devices. The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide derivatives serve as suitable candidates for various optoelectronic applications due to their desirable optical properties such as broad absorption with high molar extinction coefficients, high phosphorescence quantum yields with long lifetimes up to milliseconds, and better photochemical and photothermal stabilities. In this review, we have successfully addressed the advancements in the design, synthesis, luminescence properties and applications of phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide chromophores from 2010 to date. The achievements of oxidized phenothiazine derivatives in various applications are as follows:
• The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units exhibit high quantum yields in the solution and solid states and long excited-state lifetimes which make them suitable candidates for OLEDs.
• The excellent phosphorescence properties of phenothiazine dioxide chromophores enable further development of PhOLEDs, which is beneficial in increasing the IQE above 25%. The phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide derivatives show better electroluminescence in terms of lifetime, brightness and efficiency for blue, green and yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) OLEDs, due to their outstanding electron transporting ability and high phosphorescence quantum yields in the solid state.
• The unique non-planar shape of the phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide can lock the intramolecular motions thereby suppressing the non-radiative decay and render the materials with AIDF properties which can further improve the external quantum efficiency of OLEDs.
• The electron-deficient nature of the sulfone unit in phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide exhibits efficient charge carrier mobility and its nonplanar structure makes it an excellent hole transporting material for perovskite solar cells.
• The electron-rich hetero atom in the π-conjugated backbone of the thiazine ring possesses a unique character which allows the detection of ˙OH and ClO− species thereby protecting the body cells from serious damages and various diseases.
• The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) which allows the researchers to develop novel derivatives for the new generation-based advanced technological applications including digital security, optical recording devices, bioimaging, sensors, organic light-emitting diodes, data storage, low-cost anti-counterfeiting technologies and temperature monitoring. The π–π interactions, molecular packing in the solid state and odd–even effect of alkyl substituents are important factors to tune the ultralong RTP properties.
• The phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units also exhibit some unique properties such as photoinduced room temperature phosphorescence and mechanochromic behavior observed in copper metal amide complexes.
Despite several progress in various applications, the phenothiazine 5-oxide and phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide units face various challenges, which could be addressed by continuous research by the scientific community. Oxidized phenothiazine derivatives show excellent performance as OLEDs, NLOs, sensors, HTMs, and PSCs; however, only limited derivatives have been reported to date. The N-positions of oxidized phenothiazine derivatives have been mainly functionalized by mild acceptor units like haloarenes and carbonyl-substituted derivatives; however 3-, 7- and N-positions have not been much explored. The incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing units like benzothiadiazole (BTD), 1,8-napthalimide (NPI), perylene diimide (PDI), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and benzothiazole at the 3-, 7- and N-positions of oxidized phenothiazine derivatives may further enhance the RTP properties and provide a new pathway for the design and synthesis of materials for NLOs, sensors, PSCs, as well as chromophores for ultrafast charge transfer. The oxidized phenothiazine derivatives reported in the literature are highly polar in nature and mostly soluble in high polar solvents such as ethyl acetate or DMSO which makes their purification a tedious process.24 The solubility of oxidized phenothiazine derivatives can be improved by using long or branched alkyl chains at N-positions. The incorporation of different alkyl chains further affects the molecular packing which can help in modulating the solid-state emission properties. The easy synthetic modification, excellent electron-withdrawing properties, high quantum yields and RTP properties of phenothiazine oxide make it a potential core for the development of various push–pull systems and open up new avenues for the development of various optoelectronic devices. In summary, the excellent performances in various applications will offer a great platform for the development of new derivatives.
