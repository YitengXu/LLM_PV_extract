    , Accepted 12th September 2019First published on 14th September 2019AbstractMetal halide perovskites (MHPs) with highly sensitive photoelectric response and ultrahigh absorption coefficient in the visible range exhibit huge potential as building blocks for optoelectronic devices. However, these perovskites suffer from poor absorption efficiency in the infrared range due to the weak coupling of infrared light. In this work, we report a new class of MHP-based heterostructures by the integration of two-dimensional Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n perovskites with GaN nanosheets for the realization of highly efficient carrier separation and broadband absorption. We find that the formation of the Cs/GaN(0001) interface in Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures can induce the shift of the vacuum level below the conduction band minimum, resulting in negative electron affinity (NEA). Moreover, the NEA of the heterostructures is not sensitive to the thickness of perovskite and GaN layers. Owing to the type-II band alignment and NEA of these heterostructures, they exhibit highly efficient carrier separation and enhanced optical absorption from the infrared to ultraviolet light region, which result in maximum power conversion efficiency as high as 28.5%. The findings suggest the large potential of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures for optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells, photodetectors, and field emission devices.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years due to their superior electronic and optoelectronic properties, which endow them with great potential for the fabrication of high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.1–6 Recently, two-dimensional (2D) MHPs emerged as a new class of optoelectronic materials and they have been successfully synthesized with the thickness range from one nanometer to several nanometers.7,8 The 2D MHPs exhibit many intriguing properties, including tunable band gaps,9 long charge carrier lifetimes,10 high luminescence quantum efficiency,10 and great defect tolerance,11 which make them promising candidates for a variety of optoelectronic applications, such as photovoltaics,12 light emitting diodes,13 and photodetectors.14
The use of 2D MHPs in optoelectronic applications depends on the light harvesting and charge transport/collection efficiency. However, the relatively larger band gaps of 2D MHPs15 result in weak light absorption in the range of visible and infrared (IR) regions, which limits their application in optoelectronic devices. Hence, great efforts have been devoted to the band structure engineering of 2D MHPs for the enhancement of light harvesting efficiency.16–18 The preparation of MHP-based heterostructures is an effective and conventional way to tune their band structures. The formation of heterostructures can not only tune the band gap but also create the spatial confinement of carriers, which contributes to the improvement of device performance. However, there are large lattice mismatches between MHP materials and commonly used substrates and metal oxides (e.g., SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, and transparent conducting glass),19 which easily produce a large number of defects at the heterointerfaces. The rapid emergence of 2D materials provides a chance to overcome the constraints of lattice mismatch by the integration of these 2D materials with MHPs via van der Waals (vdW) interaction. This scheme was successfully implemented in CsPbBr3/MoS2, CsPbBr3/WSe2, H3NH3PbI3/MoS2, and CH3NH3PbI3/graphene heterostructures in recent reports.20–23 On the other hand, the production of negative electron affinity (NEA) is an effective method to enhance electron emitting and carrier extraction efficiency, and it has been widely used in wide bandgap semiconductors, such as GaN, ZnO, and diamond.24–27 Generally, NEA can be achieved by the adsorption of Cs and Cs–O species on the surface of semiconductor materials.28–31 This makes us think that the integration of Cs-based MHPs on GaN surfaces may induce NEA through the interface coupling between 2D MHPs and GaN, consequently bringing a large change in electronic and optical properties compared to those of conventional MHP-based heterostructures. Despite the importance of this issue, there are no related studies on Cs-based MHPs/GaN heterostructures.
In this work, we report for the first time the electronic and optical properties of a new class of MHP-based heterostructures by integrating Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n perovskites on GaN nanosheets based on hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations. 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures exhibit a broad spectral response ranging from IR to UV light. The increase of light absorption originates from NEA induced by the formation of the Cs/GaN(0001) interface in the heterostructures. Owing to the NEA effect, the vacuum level of the heterostructures drops down below the conduction band minimum and the work function correspondingly shifts from ∼3.0 eV down to ∼1.0 eV, resulting in an extra absorption peak in the IR region. The broadband absorption coupled with the type-II band alignment in Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures leads to the maximum power conversion efficiency as high as 28.5%.
2. Computational details
All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).32 The interactions between valence electrons and core electrons were treated by the projector augmented wave (PAW)33 method. A kinetic cutoff energy of 500 eV was used for the plane-wave expansion based on a systematic test of energy convergence (Section S1†), and it can ensure sufficient computational accuracy. The electronic exchange-correlation energy was treated using the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)34 of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.35 The interfacial interactions of vdW heterostructures were described using the PBE functional with the vdW correction (DFT-D2).36 The dipole correction was considered in all the calculations for slabs with a net dipole moment. The k-point sampling in the first Brillouin zone was implemented using the Gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a grid of 10 × 10 × 1 for both 2D MHPs and vdW heterostructures. A vacuum layer of ∼20 Å along the z-direction was introduced to avoid spurious interactions between the neighboring slabs. For the geometry optimization, the convergence criteria of energy and force acting on each atom were set to be 10−8 eV and 10−6 eV Å−1, respectively.
Owing to the well-known fact that the GGA-PBE functional underestimates the band gap of semiconductors, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof screen hybrid functional (HSE06)37 was used to predict electronic and optical properties. Meanwhile, the electronic structures of Pb-based MHPs are sensitive to the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect,38 and thus the SOC has also been considered in the calculations. Table S2† lists the calculated band gaps (Eg) of CsPbI3 and GaN using different methods. It can be seen that the band gaps of CsPbI3 and GaN calculated by the HSE06+SOC method are in accordance with experimental and theoretical reports.39–42 In contrast, the PBE and PBE+SOC lead to obvious band gap underestimation of CsPbI3 and GaN. Hence, the HSE06+SOC method was used to predict the electronic and optical properties of 2D MPHs, GaN nanosheets and their heterostructures.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometries and electronic properties of independent Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n and GaN nanosheets
We first address the structural stability and electronic properties of independent Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n and GaN nanosheets, which is crucial for understanding the geometries and electronic properties of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures. Fig. 1a shows the atomic structure of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n (n = 1), and it is obtained by cleaving the nanosheet from a cubic CsPbI3 along the (111) direction. However, 2D CsPbI3 (111) nanosheets are unstable due to high surface energies induced by the surface dangling bonds. The replacement of the divalent Pb2+ cations by trivalent cations, such as Sb3+, In3+ and Bi3+, was regarded as one of the most efficient methods to improve the stability of 2D CsPbI3 nanosheets.43,44 For example, the substitution of Pb2+ ions with Sb3+ at the surface layer of CsPbI3 nanosheets leads to a large drop of surface energy from 44.39 to −20.84 meV Å−2, suggesting the high stability of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets (see Section S3 in the ESI for details†). Similarly, the surface energies of Cs3+nPbnIn2I9+3n and Cs3+nPbnBi2I9+3n nanosheets are also far lower than that of CsPbI3 nanosheets (Table S3†), which is in good agreement with previous reports.45–47

(e) Side view of the atomic structure of the bilayer GaN nanosheet and the band structure of GaN in the (f) monolayer, (g) bilayer and (h) bulk phase. Cs, I, Ga, N, H, Sb, and Pb atoms are displayed as cyan, purple, green, blue, white, orange and black spheres, respectively. 
The stability of 2D perovskites can be further verified from the result of electronic structures. We find that the band structure of a pristine CsPbI3 nanosheet contains a deep defect level located at the band gap (Fig. S2a†), which originates from unpaired electrons of surfaces. The substitution of Pb2+ cations with trivalent ions at the surface layer leads to the elimination of surface states, which can be revealed by band structures of intrinsic semiconductors (Fig. S2b–d†). For example, 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets are obtained by the replacement of Pb2+ with Sb3+ at the surface layer of CsPbI3 nanosheets. The calculated band structures in Fig. 1b–d indicate that Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets (n = 1, 2) are indirect bandgap semiconductors, which are different from the CsPbI3 bulk with a direct bandgap. This result implies a weak optical absorption efficiency of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets with respect to the cubic CsPbI3 bulk. With the reduction of thickness from the bulk to 2D nanosheets, the band gap of perovskites increases from 1.68 to 2.39 eV due to the quantum size effect. The partial charge-density (PCD) distributions show that the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets are mainly contributed by the Pb-6p, Sb-5p, I-5p orbitals and I-5p orbitals (Fig. S3†), respectively. For 2D GaN nanosheets, their surfaces are treated by hydrogen passivation for the elimination of surface dangling bonds, and their band structures are shown in Fig. 1f–h. All considered GaN structures present direct band gaps with both the CBM and VBM at the Γ point. The quantum size effect induces the increase of the band gap of GaN from 3.76 to 6.13 eV with the reduction of thickness from the bulk to monolayer, which agrees well with previous reports.48–50 It can be seen that both ultrathin Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n and GaN nanosheets possess larger band gaps (>2.0 eV), which results in weak light absorption in the visible and IR regions.
3.2 Electronic structures of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN van der Waals heterostructures
In order to enhance the light absorption and photoelectrical conversion efficiency, the formation of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures was carried out, which is an efficient method to achieve this goal. There is a small lattice mismatch (∼0.98%) between the (1 × 1) Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n and  GaN nanosheets. The formation of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures leads to three different interfacial configurations, including hollow, Ga-top and N-top configurations based on the relative position between GaN and Cs–I termination at the interface (Fig. S4–S6†). Before the calculations, the layer distance d of the heterostructures was first optimized by the energy test, and the corresponding data are listed in Table S4.† Then, the most stable interfacial configurations were evaluated using elastic stiffness constants Cij (see Section S7 in the ESI for details†). We find that the Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures with a hollow configuration are the most stable ones according to the mechanical stability criteria. Owing to the surface polarity of GaN nanosheets, the Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures include two different interfaces: Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN(0001) (denoted as PGA-x, x is the layer number of GaN nanosheets) and Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN(000) (denoted as PGB-x).

Fig. 2 shows the projected band structures of the Cs4PbSb2I12/GaN heterostructures. All four considered heterostructures exhibit a type-II band alignment, which can be confirmed using the calculated projected density of states shown in Fig. S7.† The PCD distributions indicate that the VBM and CBM states are completely separated in the two different layers of heterostructures, which contributes to highly efficient separation of electrons and holes. Moreover, these heterostructures exhibit smaller band gaps relative to the freestanding Cs4PbSb2I12 and GaN nanosheets, which are responsible for the enhancement of light absorption in the visible region. In Fig. 2, it can be identified that there is a large difference between the band structures of PGA-x and PGB-x (x = 1, 2). First, the band gap of PGA-x is far less than that of PGB-x. For example, the band gap of PGA-2 is 1.45 eV and it is lower than that of PGB-2 by 1.02 eV (Fig. 2a and c). Similarly, the band gap of PGA-1 is 0.86 eV lower than that of PGB-1 (Fig. 2b and d). Second, PGA-x exhibits indirect bandgap characteristics but PGB-x is a type of direct bandgap semiconductor. Third, the type-II band alignment of PGA-x is different from that of PGB-x. The partial charge-density distributions show that the CBM and VBM of both PGA-1 and PGA-2 are contributed by the electronic states of GaN and Cs4PbSb2I12 layers, respectively. However, PGB-x (x = 1, 2) shows a reverse trend for the distribution of band-edge states, which is responsible for their direct band gap. Interestingly, the CBM state of PGA-1 and PGA-2 includes not only the contribution of GaN nanosheets but also that of the vacuum layer (Fig. 2a and b), implying the possibility of electron excitation directly from the valence band to the vacuum level. However, such a phenomenon does not appear in PGB-x. Therefore, the interfacial interaction of Cs4PbSb2I12/GaN heterostructures plays an important role in the determination of their intriguing electronic structures.

The Fermi energy is shifted to the VBM as the energy zero point. The blue and red lines in the band structures denote the contribution from GaN and Cs4PbSb2I12, respectively. The charge-density distributions contributed by GaN and Cs4PbSb2I12 are colored purple and red, respectively. 
3.3 Negative electron affinity in 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures
To ascertain the interfacial effect on the electronic structures of 2D Cs4PbSb2I12/GaN heterostructures, the electrostatic potential distributions of the heterostructures with different interfacial structures were calculated. Based on the computed electrostatic potential distributions, work function Φ and electron affinity χ of the heterostructures can be achieved using the following relations:51 Φ = Evac − EF(1) χ = Evac − ECBM(2)where ECBM, EF, and Evac are the energies of the CBM, Fermi level, and vacuum level, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the schematic band alignments and electrostatic potential distributions of the Cs4PbSb2I12/GaN heterostructures. Based on the electrostatic potential distributions, the work function Φ of PGA-2 and PGA-1 is 0.97 eV and 1.67 eV, respectively. Moreover, the vacuum level of both PGA-2 and PGA-1 is lower than their CBM position, leading to the negative electron affinity (NEA) (Fig. 3a–c). The result implies that electrons of the heterostructures can be excited directly from the valence band into the vacuum level. In contrast, PGB-x (x = 1, 2) present large Φ values and their vacuum levels are far higher than their CBM positions (Fig. 3d–f), showing positive electron affinity (PEA). Unlike PGA-x, the electron excitation from the valence band to the vacuum level in PGB-x needs to overcome a very large energy barrier (>4.58 eV).

(c) Electrostatic potential of PGA-1. (d) Band alignment and (e) electrostatic potential of PGB-2. (f) Electrostatic potential of PGB-1. The vacuum level, Fermi level, and CBM are indicated using red, blue, and green lines in electrostatic potential distributions, respectively. 
The large difference of electronic structures between PGA-x and PGB-x (x = 1, 2) arises from their different interfacial structures. The interface of PGA-x is the Cs–I termination of the perovskite layer coupled with the Ga-polar face (GaN(0001)) of the GaN layer. From a large number of previous studies, the formation of the Cs/GaN(0001) interface was widely confirmed as the origin of the NEA.52–56 Such a result can be checked using electronic structures of Cs-adsorbed GaN(0001) systems. The electrostatic potential distributions indicate that the adsorption of Cs atoms induces the transition from PEA to NEA on the surface of GaN(0001) nanosheets and bulk (Fig. S8 and S9†). In contrast, the vacuum level is still higher than the CBM position of Cs-adsorbed GaN(000) nanosheets irrespective of the nanosheet thickness (Fig. S10†), suggesting that the NEA cannot be induced by the formation of the Cs/GaN(000) interface. Furthermore, we also investigated the electronic structures of Cs-adsorbed GaN(110) nanosheets. Similar to the case of the Cs-adsorbed GaN(000) system, the Cs-adsorbed GaN(110) nanosheets show PEA (see Fig. S11†). In addition, NEA can be also achieved in 2D Cs4PbBi2I12/GaN(0001) and Cs4PbIn2I12/GaN(0001) vdW heterostructures. As listed in Table S6,† the calculated χ is −0.18 and −0.35 eV for Cs4PbBi2I12 and Cs4PbIn2I12 on bilayer GaN nanosheets, respectively. Hence, NEA is fundamental for the Cs-based MHPs/GaN(0001) heterostructures.
In order to further examine the validity of NEA in 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN vdW heterostructures, the thickness dependent NEA in the heterostructures was investigated. These heterostructures consist of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n with different layer numbers n and a bilayer GaN(0001) nanosheet, and a schematic structure with n = 3 is displayed in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b presents the band-edge and vacuum level positions of heterostructures with the layer number n ranging from 0 to 6, and the corresponding data of the freestanding Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets are also listed for comparison. It can be found that the CBM of all considered heterostructures is higher than the vacuum level, suggesting that the formation of NEA in the heterostructures is not sensitive to the thickness of the perovskite layer (see Fig. S12 and S13†). In contrast, the CBM positions of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets are far lower than the vacuum level, resulting in positive electron affinities. It confirms that the NEA of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures originates from the formation of the Cs/GaN(0001) interface. In addition, we can identify that the band gaps of heterostructures and freestanding Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n decrease with increasing layer number n due to the quantum size effect. Nevertheless, the relatively smaller band gaps (0.92–1.58 eV) of heterostructures contribute to the enhancement of absorption in the visible region.

3.4 Optical properties and power conversion efficiencies of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures
The bandgap reduction and NEA in 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN(0001) heterostructures increase their absorption energy range and make them more suitable to absorb IR and visible light. The improvement of optical absorption efficiency can be measured by examining the optical absorption coefficient of the heterostructures (see Section S12 in the ESI for details†). Fig. 5a shows the optical absorption spectra of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures (n = 0–2) as a function of photon energy, and the absorption spectra of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets have also been calculated for comparison (Fig. 5b). Overall, the absorption spectra of the heterostructures indicate an obvious red shift compared to those of freestanding Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets, which shows the enhancement of the optical absorption of the heterostructures in the visible region. Meanwhile, additional absorption peaks can be clearly identified in the energy range of 0.5–1.5 eV, which corresponds to the absorption range from IR to visible light. This abnormality stems from the transition of photoexcited electrons from the valence band to the vacuum level due to the NEA of the heterostructures. Therefore, the formation of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures results in a wider absorption range and stronger optical absorption, especially in the IR and visible regions.

The inset shows the optical absorption spectra of the heterostructures in the energy range from 0 to 2 eV. (c) The computed PCE of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN vdW heterostructures and freestanding Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets as a function of layer number n. 
Owing to the highly efficient carrier separation and broadband absorption, it is expected that a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures could be obtained. The maximum PCE (η) was estimated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) method,57 (3)where Isun is the photon flux, e is the elementary charge, Ibb is the black-body spectrum, k is the Boltzmann constant, and V is the open circuit voltage. a(E) is the photon absorptivity and it can be expressed as a(E) = 1 − e−2α(E)L, where α(E) is the calculated absorption coefficient and L is the thickness of the structure. fr is the fraction of radiative recombination current, written as , where Edag is the electric-dipole-allowed direct optical transition and Eg is the band gap. Fig. 5c shows the computed PCE of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN(0001) heterostructures and freestanding Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets as a function of layer number n. It can be found that the PCE of the heterostructures increases from 5.1% to 15.9% with the change of layer number n from 0 to 6. Moreover, the PCE of the heterostructures is still higher than that of freestanding Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n nanosheets due to the type-II band alignment and enhanced optical absorption. Furthermore, due to the thickest heterostructure (n = 6) being only 2.52 nm, it can be predicted that when the thickness of the two-dimensional perovskite increases, the heterojunction should have higher conversion efficiency. Herein, the efficiency limit is as high as 28.5% obtained by simulating a heterostructure thick enough (Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN superlattice). The PCE values of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN structures can be compared with the SLME of existing devices based on 2D materials (Table S7†), such as the AsP/CdSe heterostructure (13%), Cu-V-VI films (23–27%), Zn1−xMgxO/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD (16.5%) and other 2D material-based systems (2.25–6.9%). Moreover, 2D MHPs and GaN nanosheets have been successfully fabricated in experiments, which paves the way for the application of 2D Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN vdW heterostructures in optoelectronic devices.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported the electronic and optical properties of a new kind of 2D MHP/GaN vdW heterostructure by the integration of Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n perovskites with GaN nanosheets. We have demonstrated the presence of NEA in Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures due to the formation of the Cs/GaN(0001) interface. The NEA effect leads to an extra and strong IR absorption induced by the electron excitation from the valence band to the vacuum level. Owing to the broadband light absorption and type-II band alignment, Cs3+nPbnSb2I9+3n/GaN heterostructures exhibit an ultrahigh PCE up to ∼28.5%. This work opens a new pathway to engineer the electronic and optical properties of MHPs for optoelectronic applications.
