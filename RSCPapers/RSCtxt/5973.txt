    , Accepted 23rd March 2016First published on 23rd March 2016AbstractDue to its abundance, silicon is the preferred solar-cell material despite the fact that many silicon allotropes have indirect band gaps. Elemental silicon has a large impact on the economy of the modern world and is of fundamental importance in the technological field, particularly in the solar cell industry. Looking for direct band gap silicon is still an important field in material science. Based on density function theory with the ultrasoft pseudopotential scheme in the frame of the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation, we have systematically studied the structural stability, absorption spectra, electronic, optical and mechanical properties and minimum thermal conductivity of two novel silicon phases, Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon. These are both thermally, dynamically and mechanically stable. The absorption spectra of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon exhibit significant overlap with the solar spectrum and thus, excellent photovoltaic efficiency with great improvements over Fdm Si. These two novel Si structures with direct band gaps could be applied in single p–n junction thin-film solar cells or tandem photovoltaic devices.
I. Introduction
Due to the limited supply of fossil fuels and their adverse effect on the environment, to find clean and sustainable energy sources is one of the most arduous and significant challenges of the 21st century. Of all the renewable energy sources available, solar energy is the best solution,1 but development of efficient photovoltaic materials to convert solar energy into electricity is essential. Silicon, because of its high abundance and stability, has been widely used as a photovoltaic material for solar cell devices. However, Fdm silicon does not absorb sunlight as efficiently as some other materials do. Its indirect band gap of 1.12 eV significantly limits the efficiency of solar cells, and its direct band gap of 3.4 eV is too large2 and only allows high energy photons to be absorbed. Metastable silicon allotropes, such as R8, T12, C2/m-16, C2/m-20, Amm2, I, P2221 and lonsdaleite structures also exhibit indirect band gaps,3–8 and BC8 phases show semimetal features.3,9 None of these materials are suitable for solar absorption. These limitations have led to a constant search for novel silicon structures with appropriate direct band gaps and desired optical properties.
Recently, Botti et al.10 presented first-principles calculations of the electronic and optical properties of silicon allotropes with quasidirect and dipole-allowed band gaps in the range of 0.8–1.5 eV for applications in thin-film solar cells. They all consist of distorted sp3 silicon networks and have a lower formation energy. By combining the new method with first principles calculations, Xiang et al.11 predicted a new metastable Si20-T structure (space group: P213) with good optical properties and a quasidirect gap of 1.55 eV. By combining the conformational space annealing (CSA) method12,13 for global optimization and first-principles density functional calculations, Lee et al.14 predicted some crystalline silicon phases with direct gaps and quasidirect gap structures. D135 silicon (space group: Cc) is a direct band gap semiconductor and Q135 silicon (space group: C2/c) is an indirect band gap semiconductor, the band gap of D135 silicon and Q135 silicon is 1.05 and 1.31 eV with G0W0 calculations,15,16 respectively. D135 silicon exhibits a significant overlap with the solar spectrum and thus, excellent photovoltaic efficiency with great improvements over amorphous Si, polycrystalline Si, and Fdm Si. The D262 phase was also first predicted in ref. 14, namely P21/m silicon in this paper. Wang et al., utilizing ab initio calculations at ambient pressure, found six metastable allotropes of silicon with direct or quasidirect band gaps of 0.39–1.25 eV.17 They not only have a direct band gap or quasidirect band gap, but also have better optical properties than the Fdm silicon. Mujica et al.18 found that the Pbam structure in carbon, silicon and germanium has a low-energy, low-density metastable polymorph, and Pbam silicon is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap of 1.4 eV. P41212 silicon is a likely candidate for the structure of the unknown phase XIII of silicon, P42/ncm silicon and P41212 silicon are both indirect band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 1.34 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively. The 44 metastable phases of silicon are calculated by Amsler et al.19 using density functional theory, of which 11 exhibit direct or quasidirect band gaps in the range of about 1.0–1.8 eV, close to the optimal Shockley–Queisser limit of about 1.4 eV, with a stronger overlap of the absorption spectra with the solar spectrum compared to conventional Fdm silicon. In the study of Guo et al.,20 they found a missing structure, the h-Si6 (space group: P63/mmc) phase of silicon, by using silicon triangles as the building block. Using first-principles calculations, they confirmed that it has thermal, dynamical, and mechanical stability. h-Si6 silicon is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.61 eV and remarkable optical properties. Oh et al.21 have discovered low-energy pure-Si superlattice structures with dipole-allowed direct band gaps, as well as indirect band gaps, which can be applied to the solar cell industry and pure Si-based optoelectronic devices.
In the present work, we predict two novel silicon allotropes, Cm-32 and P21/m silicon, whose structure is based on Cm-32 and P21/m carbon,22 with silicon atoms substituting the carbon atoms. P21/m silicon, in ref. 14 and 23, is based on the conformational space annealing method, while it is based on the transmutation approach in the present manuscript. Cm-32 and P21/m carbon both have direct band gaps, and better optical properties than Fdm silicon. In addition, the stability, structure, elasticity, elastic anisotropy and minimum thermal conductivity are also systematically investigated.
II. Computational details
A density functional theory (DFT)24,25 calculation within Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials26 was performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code.27 For the exchange and correlation functionals, we use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)28 and local density approximation (LDA).29,30 The equilibrium crystal structures were achieved utilizing geometry optimization in the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS)31 minimization scheme. For Cm-32 silicon, P21/m silicon and Fdm silicon, the energy cutoff of 360 eV was used for the wave function expansions. The high density k-point32 sampling with the grid spacing less than 2π × 0.025 Å−1 (9 × 3 × 5 for Cm-32 silicon, 5 × 11 × 7 for P21/m silicon, 8 × 8 × 8 for Fdm silicon) in the Brillouin zone was used. The self-consistent convergence of the total energy is 5 × 10−6 eV per atom; the maximum force on the atom is 0.01 eV Å−1, the maximum ionic displacement was within 5 × 10−4 Å and the maximum stress was within 0.02 GPa. Both HSE06 hybrid functional33 and GGA-PBE methods were used for the calculation of electronic structures.
III. Results and discussion
Structures
The crystal structures of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are shown in Fig. 1. Cm-32 silicon has 32 atoms in a conventional cell with the Cm (No. 8) structure in monoclinic symmetry and P21/m silicon belongs to the P21/m (No. 11) space group containing only 10 silicon atoms per conventional cell in monoclinic symmetry. For Cm-32 silicon, within this structure, ten inequivalent atoms occupy the crystallographic 4b and 2a sites in the conventional cell, which are 4b (0.3492 0.1037 0.1458), 4b (0.3552 0.3441 0.9311), 4b (0.3488 0.1501 0.9820), 4b (0.8084 0.1539 0.4815), 4b (0.5108 0.1564 0.6035), 4b (0.8358 0.1004 0.6575), 2a (0.6702 0.0 0.0930), 2a (0.1163 0.0 0.5850), 2a (0.6557 0.0 0.9164) and 2a (0.1603 0.0 0.4405). For P21/m silicon, five inequivalent atoms occupy the crystallographic 2e site in the conventional cell, which are (0.9397 0.750 0.0877), (0.2975 0.750 0.1926), (0.0361 0.750 0.3963), (0.6907 0.750 0.0428) and (0.5053 0.250 0.61341). At zero pressure, for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon, their equilibrium lattice constants calculated from GGA (LDA) are a = 8.857 (8.714) Å, b = 11.516 (11.328) Å, c = 14.008 (13.782) Å, β = 151.012° (151.027°) and a = 9.119 (8.960) Å, b = 3.865 (3.797) Å, c = 6.160 (6.066) Å, β = 75.066° (74.853°), respectively. There are 15 bond lengths and 8 bond lengths in the conventional cell of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon (see Fig. 1(a) and (c)), respectively. The average bond length is 2.371 Å and 2.369 Å for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon, respectively, they are both slightly larger than that of Fdm silicon (2.352 Å). So we can expect the hardness of Fdm silicon to be larger than that of P21/m silicon, and Cm-32 silicon to have the smallest hardness of them all. Five-, six- and eight-membered silicon rings are normal to have in the structure of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon has five-, six- and seven-membered silicon rings (see Fig. 1(b) and (d)). The candidate structures with good porous properties are obtained by stacking different silicon multiple ring units.

Stabilities of novel phases
There are two new phases of Si at ambient pressure which have not been reported yet. To investigate the possible phase transition sequence at ambient pressure, we first calculated the enthalpies of the Cm-32 and P21/m phases and other silicon phases relative to the Fdm phase. The enthalpies of the Cm-32 and P21/m phases, together with previously reported new silicon phases, as a function of pressure are shown in Fig. 2. The relative enthalpies are calculated by the formula: ΔH = Hnovelphase/n1-HFdmphase/n2, where n1 is the number of atoms in a conventional cell of the two silicon phases and n2 is the number of atoms in a conventional cell of Fdm phase. The calculated lattice parameters of Cm-32 silicon, P21/m silicon and Fdm silicon are listed in Table 1. From Table 1, the Fdm phase is the most stable phase at ambient pressure. Among them, the most unfavorable P21/m phase is higher in energy than the Fdm phase by 0.084 eV per atom at ambient pressure, while the more stable Cm-32 phase is 0.072 eV per atom higher than the Fdm phase. In ref. 17 and in this work, the most unfavorable tP16-Si is higher in energy than Fdm silicon by 0.269 eV per atom and by 0.277 eV per atom at zero pressure, but tP16-Si is still mechanically and dynamically stable. Then, the dynamical and mechanical stability of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon was checked. The calculated phonon spectra of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are shown in Fig. 3. No imaginary frequencies are observed throughout the whole Brillouin zone, signaling dynamical and structural stability of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon. The mechanical stabilities are checked using the elastic constants of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon. Utilizing the strain–stress relationship, we calculated the elastic constants of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon. Due to the monoclinic symmetry of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon there are thirteen independent elastic constants Cij, namely C11, C12, C13, C15, C22, C23, C25, C33, C35, C44, C46, C55, and C66. For a stable monoclinic structure, its thirteen independent elastic constants should obey the following generalized Born's mechanical stability criteria:34,35 Cii > 0, i = 1–6,(1) [C11 + C22 + C33 + 2(C12 + C13 + C23)] > 0,(2) (C33C55 − C352) > 0,(3) (C44C66 − C462) > 0,(4) (C22 + C33 − 2C23) > 0,(5) [C22(C33C55 − C352) + 2C23C25C35 − C232C55 − C252C33] > 0,(6) Ω = 2[C15C25(C33C12 − C13C23) + C15C35(C22C13 − C12C33) + C25C35(C11C23 − C12C13)] − [C152(C22C33 − C232) + C252(C11C33 − C132) + C352(C11C22 − C122)] + C55g > 0(7) g = C11C22C33 − C11C232 − C22C132 − C33C122 + 2C12C13C23(8)

Mechanical properties
The elastic modulus is defined as the slope of its stress–strain curve in the elastic deformation region:36λ = stress/strain, where λ is the elastic modulus. The bulk modulus (B) describes volumetric elasticity. The shear modulus (G) describes a material's tendency to shear when acted upon by opposing forces, and Young's modulus (E) describes tensile elasticity. It is a measure of the stiffness of an elastic isotropic material and is a quantity used to characterize materials. Bulk modulus B and shear modulus G are calculated by the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximation.37–39 The Voigt and Reuss approximation of monoclinic symmetry is calculated using the following equations:34 (9) BR = Ω(a + b + c + d + e + f)−1,(10) a = (C33C55 − C352)(C11 + C22 − 2C12),(11) b = (C23C55 − C25C35)(2C12 − 2C11 − C23),(12) c = (C13C35 − C15C33)(C15 − 2C25),(13) d = (C13C55 − C15C35)(2C12 + 2C23 − C13 − 2C22),(14) e = 2(C13C25 − C15C23)(C25 − C15),(15) f = C11(C22C55 − C252) − C12(C12C55 − C15C25) + C15(C12C25 − C15C22) + C25(C23C35 − C25C33),(16) (17) (18) h = (C33C55 − C352)(C11 + C22 + C12),(19) i = (C23C55 − C25C35)(C11 − C12 − C23),(20) j = (C13C35 − C15C33)(C15 + C25),(21) k = (C13C55 − C15C35)(C22 − C23 − C12 − C13),(22) l = (C13C25 − C15C23)(C15 − C25),(23)
The calculated elastic moduli of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are listed in Table 3. The bulk moduli B of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are both 79 GPa, which is slightly smaller than that of Fdm silicon (88 GPa), and some new phases of our previous forecast of silicon, C2/m-16 silicon (82 GPa), C2/m-20 silicon (83 GPa), I silicon (80 GPa)6 and P2221 silicon (83 GPa),7 while slightly larger than Amm2 silicon (78 GPa)6 and P42/mnm silicon (74 GPa,40 75 GPa41). The shear modulus G of Cm-32 silicon is the smallest among the new silicon phases and our previous forecast of silicon (C2/m-16 silicon: 51 GPa; C2/m-20 silicon: 55 GPa; I silicon: 48 GPa; Amm2 silicon: 51 GPa; P2221 silicon: 54 GPa; P42/mnm silicon: 48 GPa), while P21/m silicon is only slightly smaller than C2/m-20 silicon. The bulk modulus B and shear modulus G of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are both smaller than that of Fdm silicon. Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio v can be expressed by the following equations: E = 9BG/(3B + G), and v = (3B − 2G)/(6B + 2G). The Young's modulus E of Cm-32 silicon is 118 GPa, and that of P21/m silicon is 132 GPa, these values are both slightly smaller than that of Fdm silicon, while the Poisson's ratios v of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are slightly larger than that of Fdm silicon. In addition, the new allotropes in the silicon system are brittle with their values of B/G and v smaller than 1.75 and 0.26 (a larger B/G value (more than 1.75) for a solid represents ductility while a smaller B/G value (less than 1.75)42 usually means that it is brittle. Like B/G value, Poisson's ratio v is consistent with B/G, but refers to ductile compounds, usually with a large v (more than 0.26)43). Meanwhile, Fdm silicon is the most brittle, Cm-32 silicon is the least brittle.

Interest in the calculation of the Debye temperature ΘD has been increasing in both semiempirical and theoretical phase diagram calculation areas since the Debye model offers a simple but high efficiency method to describe the phonon contribution to the Gibbs energy of crystalline phases. Debye temperature ΘD is used to distinguish between high and low temperature regions for a solid. If T > ΘD, one expects all modes to have the energy of kBT, but if T < ΘD, one expects the high-frequency modes to be frozen. The average sound velocity vm and Debye temperature ΘD can be approximately calculated using the following relations:44,45 (24) (25)where ℏ is Planck's constant, kB is Boltzmann's constant, NA is Avogadro's number, n is the number of atoms in the molecule, M is molecular weight, and ρ is the density, (θ, φ) are angular coordinates and dΩ = sinθdθdφ. If the elastic constants of the crystal are known, vi(θ, φ) can be obtained by solving a secular equation, and vm and ΘD can then be calculated by numerical integration over θ and φ.46,47vl and vt are the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities, respectively, which can be obtained from Navier's equation:48 (26)where B and G are bulk modulus and shear modulus, respectively. The calculated sound velocities and Debye temperatures of Cm-32 silicon, P21/m silicon and Fdm silicon are listed in Table 4. The longitudinal and transverse sound velocities of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are smaller than those of Fdm silicon, because Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon have the smaller elastic moduli. The Debye temperature of Cm-32 silicon is 555 K and P21/m silicon is 590 K at ambient pressure, and it is also smaller than that of Fdm silicon (ΘD = 639 K). For materials, usually, if its Debye temperature is higher than other materials, its hardness will be greater than other materials. So we calculated the hardness of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon using the Lyakhov and Oganov's model.49 The calculated results are listed in Table 3. Consistent with previous predictions, the calculated hardness of Cm-32 silicon is 7.00 GPa, which is almost half that of Fdm silicon (13.90 GPa). The calculated hardness of P21/m silicon is 12.45 GPa, it is 43.78% greater than that of Cm-32 silicon, and 10.43% smaller than that of Fdm silicon.

Electronic structures
The band structures of Cm-32 silicon, P21/m silicon and Fdm silicon are calculated by GGA-PBE. It is known that the calculated band gap with DFT is usually underestimated by 30–50%, the true band gap must be larger than the calculated results. In consideration of this problem, Heyd et al. proposed a more tractable hybrid functional method, giving rise to the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional. The hybrid functional HSE06 is used in the form:50,51 EHSExc = μEHF,SRx(ω) + (1 − μ)EPW91,SRx(ω) + EPW91,LRx(ω) + EPW91c,(27)where the HF mixing parameter μ is 0.25 and the screening parameter providing good accuracy for the band gaps is ω = 0.207 Å−1.33,51 The calculated results of Cm-32 silicon, P21/m silicon and Fdm silicon are listed in Table 3. The results of HSE06 are much larger than that of PBE. The band gap of Fdm silicon using the HSE06 is 1.28 eV in this work and ref. 52 with HSE03, which is very close to the experimental value (1.12 eV).53 The band structures of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are shown in Fig. 4. Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are both direct semiconductors with band gaps of 1.85 and 0.83 eV, respectively. At the GGA-PBE level of density functional theory, the P21/m silicon is predicted to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a small band gap of 0.26 eV, as both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the Γ point. This value of 0.26 eV is less than one third of the band gap (0.83 eV) of the HSE06 hybrid functional for P21/m silicon. For Cm-32 silicon, the value of 1.19 eV is almost close to half of the band gap (1.85 eV) of the HSE06 hybrid functional. In addition, for P21/m silicon, the energy at the B point is −0.33 eV and 1.02 eV near the Fermi level, so the direct band gap at the B point is 1.35 eV. Emphasis has obviously been given to direct band-gap materials, with gaps between 1.0 and 1.5 eV and with absorption spectra that strongly overlap with the solar spectrum.54–56 These Si structures with different band gaps could be applied in single p–n junction thin-film solar cells or tandem photovoltaic devices.

Elastic anisotropy
The anisotropy of the crystal lattice along different directions, the atomic arrangement of the periodicity and the degree of density are not the same. This leads to the different physical and chemical properties of crystals in different directions, which are represented as the crystal anisotropy. The dependence of Young's modulus on the direction of load can be used as an example. Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior. It is well known that the anisotropy of elasticity is an important implication in engineering science and crystal physics. In this paper, we mainly discuss the anisotropy of elastic modulus of materials. The directional dependence of the anisotropy is calculated by the Elastic Anisotropy Measures (ELAM)57,58 code. The 3D figures of the Young's modulus for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), and the 2D representation of the Young's modulus for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). From the 3D figures of the Young's modulus for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon, all of them show different degrees of anisotropy. From Fig. 5(a) and (c), the maximum values and the minimum values of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are 141 GPa, 101 GPa and 161 GPa, 100 GPa, respectively. The ratio Emax/Emin (Cm-32 silicon) = 1.40, and the ratio Emax/Emin (P21/m silicon) = 1.61, in contrast, the ratio Emax/Emin (Fdm silicon) = 183/124 = 1.48. The elastic anisotropy of Fdm silicon is larger than that of Cm-32 silicon, while smaller than that of P21/m silicon. More details of the anisotropy for Young's modulus are shown in two-dimensional figures (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). For Cm-32 silicon, the minimum values and the maximum values of the (001) plane, the (010) plane, the (100) plane and the (111) plane are 104 GPa, 141 GPa; 113 GPa, 136 GPa; 107 GPa, 141 GPa and 105 GPa, 123 GPa, respectively. It is obvious that the (100) plane has the most anisotropy, and the (111) plane has the least anisotropy. While for P21/m silicon, the minimum values and the maximum values of the (001) plane, the (010) plane, the (100) plane and the (111) plane are 100 GPa, 148 GPa; 115 GPa, 157 GPa; 129 GPa, 160 GPa and 101 GPa, 158 GPa, respectively. It is obviously that for P21/m silicon, the (111) plane has the most anisotropy, and the (100) plane has the least anisotropy. For Fdm silicon, the Emax/Emin = 162/124 = 1.31 in the (001), (010) and (100) planes, while the Emax/Emin = 162/162 = 1.0 for the (111) plane, which shows that Fdm silicon is isotropic in the (111) plane. From the above discussion, we note that the anisotropy of all the special planes for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon is smaller than that of the material itself. The anisotropy in Young's modulus of Cm-32 silicon for the (001) and (100) planes and P21/m silicon for the (001) and (010) planes is slightly larger than that of Fdm silicon, and the anisotropy in Young's modulus of Cm-32 silicon for the (010) plane and P21/m silicon for the (100) plane is slightly smaller than that of Fdm silicon. But the anisotropy of the (111) special plane for Fdm silicon is smaller than that of the same plane for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon.

Optical properties
We then turn our interest on the absorption abilities of these two novel silicon allotropes. Absorption spectra of these allotropes are also calculated based on the HSE06 hybrid functional. The results are shown in Fig. 6 in comparison with that of the Fdm silicon. According to the spectra range, we divided the spectrum into three parts, namely the infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions. We can see that both Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon possess stronger absorption coefficients than Fdm silicon in the photon energy range between 1.5 to 3.2 eV. For Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon, the absorption of low-energy photons starts from about 1.2 eV and 0.6 eV, which is close to its direct band gap at the Γ point for P21/m silicon. Moreover, Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon exhibit higher optical absorption coefficients than Fdm silicon when the photon energy is below 3.2 eV. This implies that Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon can be the ideal candidates for photovoltaic materials. Our results suggest that Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are suitable for thin-film solar cell applications in view of their direct band gap characteristics and strong absorption abilities, if they can be synthesized in future experiments successfully.

Minimum thermal conductivity
The conduction of heat in semiconductors has been the subject of intensive study during the past 60 years. From the practical point of view, thermal conductivity is an important parameter in determining the maximum power under which a semiconductor device may be operated. Moreover, thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters determining the efficiency of those semiconductors used in thermoelectric energy conversion. The minimum thermal conductivity κmin can be calculated using theoretical methods, namely, Cahill's model,59 expressed as follows: (28) In Cahill's model, N represents the number of atoms in a conventional volume and vl and vt represent the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities, respectively. Cahill et al. deduced the κmin as a function of temperature, which can be expressed by the following form: (29) The sum is obtained from the three acoustic mode (two transverse and one longitudinal) speeds of vi. Θi is the cutoff frequency for each polarization expressed in K, Θi = vi[h/(2πkB)](6π2n)1/3, and n is the number density of atoms. Utilizing eqn (28) and (29), the κminversus temperature for Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon is plotted in Fig. 7. The thermal conductivities increase with temperature and eventually reach corresponding stable values. At low temperature (about 0–200 K), their κmin are similar to each other. At high temperature (T > 1200 K), minimum thermal conductivity is almost constant, it increases linearly with temperature at high temperatures. Among two novel silicon allotropes and Fdm silicon, Fdm silicon owns the highest value and is slightly higher than that of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon, while Cm-32 silicon owns the lowest value. At T = 300 K, the minimum thermal conductivity κmin of Fdm silicon is 1.13 W cm−1 K−1, the value is slightly smaller than the available theoretical value (1.56 W cm−1 K−1).60 In addition, the minimum thermal conductivity κmin of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are very close to the minimum thermal conductivity of Fdm silicon, these two novel silicon allotropes also have good thermal conductivity.

IV. Summary
The stability, structural, elastic, elastic anisotropic, optical and electronic properties and minimum thermal conductivity of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are systematically investigated in this paper. Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are thermodynamically, mechanicallly and dynamically stable. The most striking feature of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon is their direct band gaps, with values of 1.85 and 0.83 eV, respectively. Both the VBM and CBM of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are located at the Γ point, while for P21/m silicon, there is another direct band gap with a value of 1.35 eV at the B point. The elastic anisotropy calculations of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon shows that P21/m silicon exhibits larger anisotropy than Fdm silicon, while Cm-32 silicon exhibits smaller anisotropy than Fdm silicon. For the absorption abilities of these two novel silicon allotropes, they both possess stronger absorption coefficients than Fdm silicon in the visible region. Our results suggest that Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon are suitable for thin-film solar cell applications in view of their direct band gap characteristics and strong absorption abilities. At T = 300 K, the minimum thermal conductivity κmin of Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon is as good as that of Fdm silicon. Cm-32 silicon and P21/m silicon can be expected to be multifunctional materials with direct band gaps and good hydrogen storage abilities.
