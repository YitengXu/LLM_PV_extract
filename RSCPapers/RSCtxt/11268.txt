, Accepted 10th July 2013First published on 11th July 2013Abstract3D inverse opal ZnO photonic crystals (ZnO-PCs) with designed photonic bandgap (PBG) were prepared to study the pore size and slow photon effect on photocatalytic dye degradation. The PBGs of these ZnO-PC films were tuned experimentally by variation of the polystyrene sphere size of the opal templates. It was found that there is competition between the surface area and mass transport with increasing pore size during photocatalysis. ZnO-PCs exhibited higher photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation, when the probe molecules were absorbed and well matched with the PBG. The enhancement could be attributed to intensified dye photosensitization as a result of the slow photon effect at the PBG edges, thus leading to a remarkable improvement in the light trapping. The present results provide useful information for developing high performance photocatalysts and photoanodes based on artificial photonic crystal design.
1. Introduction
Photonic crystals with an inverse opal structure, have spurred immense attention as promising materials for applications in energetics,1,2 solar cells,3–6 catalysis7–11 and various electromagnetic and optic realms,12,13 owing to their unique structure and photonic effect.14–17 To be specific, 3D inverse opal, a replicated shell structure of a face-centered-cubic (fcc) opal, offers a 3D interconnected nano-framework and a spherical pore (74% void volume), which facilitates mass transport and light harvesting.18,19 Besides, the periodical 3D inverse opal can provide an additional photonic effect to enhance the light-matter interactions by controlling, confining and manipulating the propagation of light via Bragg diffraction, multiple scattering and the slow photon (SP) effect.20–23 The light at the frequency edges of a photonic bandgap (PBG) will propagate with strongly reduced group velocity and can be described as a standing wave.2,24,25 In particular, the SP is primarily localized in the low dielectric part (generally the medium filled in the void) of the PC at the blue edge of the PBG, which is denoted as BSP; whereas the SP is localized in the high dielectric part (generally nano-framework) of the PC at the red edge of the PBG, which is denoted as RSP.2,26,27
These effects make inverse opal films desirable for photocatalysis, and recently they have stimulated intense interest in fabricating inverse opal photocatalysts for enhancement of light harvesting and photocatalytic performance.28–34 For example, Chen et al. fabricated the PBG of i-SnO2 to overlap with the electronic absorption overlayer of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), so the light reflected due to Bragg diffraction was utilized by TiO2 NPs and lead to enhancement of MO photodegradation.29 Liu et al. optimized the RSP of i-Ti–Si PC to match the absorption region of TiO2, which showed 15.6 factor enhancement in comparison to TiO2 NPs film for rhodamine B photodegradation.30 Lu et al. regulated the BSP of i-TiO2 to overlap with the surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs, which intensified the plasmonic absorption and enhanced the kinetic constant 2.3 fold with respect to TiO2 NPs/Au NPs,31 because the TiO2 nano-framework is the high dielectric part of the PC. The RSP interacts with TiO2, whereas the BSP works on Au NPs in the void. The same mechanism was also reported on other inverse opal materials for enhancement of incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, such as WO3, TiO2 and TiO2-CdS.2,35,36 The results of these experiments are consistent with PC theory. It has been demonstrated that 3D PCs were superior to nanoparticle samples in photocatalysis.10,11,28–34 However, the effect of the PC in photocatalysis is not fully understood yet. In the previous reports, the rate constant increased with increasing pore size, when their PBGs were out of the electronic absorption region of the photocatalyst,31,32 while the conflicting phenomenon was also observed in the photodegradation of MB over i-TiO2-PC spheres (the rate constant decreased and then increased with increasing pore size ).33 There was no explanation for the effect of pore size within the scope of inverse opals in the photocatalysis and to our knowledge, there has not yet been a study about the influence of position relationship between SP (RSP or BSP) and dye absorption on the photocatalytic activities.
Recently, we have also found that both photocatalytic activity and photostability of ZnO can be enhanced dramatically by fabricating the ZnO structure into a photonic crystal.34 The introduced photonic crystal increases the ability of ZnO to be used for photocatalytic decomposition of environmental pollutants, as compared with disordered porous and commercial nanoparticle ZnO. In addition, no deactivation was observed during the cyclic test due to the synergistic effect of the inverse opal structure and the PC effect. These surprising findings thus prompted us to study the effect of pore size and SPs within the scope of ZnO-PCs in photocatalysis, and to explore the universality of pore size and the SP effect by extending the probe molecule from MO to other organic pollutants.
Herein, to clarify pore size and the SP effect on the photocatalytic degradation of dyes, four classic environmental pollutants methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), which possess different properties (Table S1, ESI†), were selected as probe molecules. Three ZnO-PCs with expected PBG were designed to match the probe molecules, and their photocatalytic activities were investigated in detail under UV and visible light irradiation.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of ZnO-PCs
Monodisperse polystyrene (PS) latex spheres with diameters of 270, 300 and 350 nm were synthesized by a modified emulsifier-free emulsion copolymerization method.37 The PS opal templates were fabricated by means of vertical deposition.38 Typically, the glass slide (25.4 mm × 76.2 mm × 1.1 mm) was treated in Piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2, 3:1) for 12 h, following cleaning with ethanol and deionized water to make its surface hydrophilic, and dried with nitrogen gas to keep its surface pure. The clean substrate was submerged vertically into the monodisperse PS latex solution (ca. 0.2 wt%) at a temperature of 45 °C for growth of a PS opal template film.
The opal templates were annealed at 90 °C for 30 min to promote their mechanical strength. Then the templates were immersed into ZnNO3 (3 g) water-ethanol solution (v/v = 12/8) at room temperature. After about 2 min, the templates were taken out and placed horizontally on an experimental bench. As the templates were dried at room temperature, the resultant samples were heated to 400 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1 and kept at the temperature for 4 h. Finally, ZnO-PCs with designed PBG were obtained. Moreover, ZnO-PCs fabricated from the opal templates with 270 nm, 300 nm and 350 nm diameter PS spheres were denoted as ZnO-510, ZnO-600 and ZnO-720, respectively (510, 600 and 720 nm were their corresponding PBG). To elucidate the photonic crystal effect, the reference porous ZnO film (ZnO-P) was prepared by the same procedure except for using the inhomogenous PS template, which consists of different diameter PS spheres. For comparison, another reference nanoparticle ZnO film (ZnO-N) was also prepared as follows: the commercial ZnO powder was dispersed completely in deionized water by ultrasonication, then the same amount of ZnO as the porous ZnO film was coated on a substrate and followed by calcination at 90 °C for 30 min to remove water and enhance adhesion between the substrate and ZnO film.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample was collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA using Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation. Transmittance spectra were characterized on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500) and glass slide was used as a reference sample. The ZnO samples (ZnO-PCs, ZnO-P and ZnO-N) were dipped in dye (RhB or MB) solution for a few minutes and then its absorption spectra detected in the presence of a dye solution. The sample's morphology and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were investigated on field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (America, FEI Nova NanoSEM 230), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were determined on a JEOL model JEM 2010 Ex instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the active species (superoxide radical ˙O2− and hydroxyl radical ˙OH) spin-trapped by 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) were detected using a Bruker model A300 spectrometer with normal incidence of light irradiation, which is the same light source as for the photoactivity test. In detail, for measuring hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical, the sample (ca. 1 mg) was dispersed in 0.5 mL purified ultrapure water and rarefied methanol into which 20 μL DMPO/water or DMPO/methanol solution was added, respectively. The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: center field, 3512 G; microwave frequency, 9.86 GHz; power, 6.34 mW.
The photoelectrochemical experiment was measured on an electrochemical station (CHI-660D, China) using a three-electrode system. The ZnO-PC film (5 mm × 5 mm) on the FTO substrate (sheet resistance is ca. 14 Ω/cm2. Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl served as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was utilized as the electrolyte. In the photocurrent measurement, the ZnO photoanodes were illuminated at normal incidence of visible light through a quartz window, and the light was chopped manually at regular intervals.
2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
A 500 W Xe-arc lamp equipped with different filters was used as a light source. The spectra of the light sources (Fig. S1, ESI†) were detected by an ILT 950 spectroradiometer (International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA, USA). The photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants (methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP)) in the liquid phase was implemented in a quartz cell (3.2 × 1.2 × 4.5 cm3). The ZnO-PC film was immersed vertically into the quartz cell containing 10 mL 5 ppm MO (or 2.4 ppm RhB, 4 ppm 4-CP, 2 ppm MB) solution. Prior to irradiation, the above solution was stirred in the dark to ensure the equilibrium of adsorption and desorption. Then, a 3 mL solution was taken out at given intervals, and analyzed on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-50, Varian Co.). The rate of photocatalytic degradation was assumed to obey pseudo-first-order kinetics. The photocatalytic degradation rate constant (denoted as k) was obtained via least square fitting according to the equation, A = A0e−kt, where A was the intensity of characteristic absorption peak of dye at given time t, A0 was the initial intensity.39,40
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Fabrication and characterization of ZnO-PCs
In order to make PBG match these absorption peaks of the selected probe molecules, ZnO-PCs with desirable PBG were fabricated by tuning the PS spheres diameter according to the modified Bragg's law.41 
λmax = (8/3)1/2 D [ns2 f + nf2 (1 − f) − sin2θ]1/2
(1)Where λmax is the maximum wavelength derived from the photonic bandgap, D is the diameter of the PS sphere, ns and nf are the refractive index of the spheres and their surrounding medium, respectively, while f is the volume of fraction of the spheres which is generally taken as 0.74, and θ is the incident angle of light. According to eqn (1) and considering 10% shrinkage in the pore size of the inverse opal during the removal of the PS opal template, three kinds of PS opal templates self-assembled from 270, 300, and 350 nm PS spheres respectively, were selected to prepare ZnO-PCs. The PBG was estimated to either overlap with or be out of the absorption region of probe molecule.
ZnO-PCs were prepared using monodisperse polystyrene (PS) spheres self-assembled into the opal template with zinc nitrate solution used as the infiltration precursor. The experimental procedure for the fabrication of ZnO-PC is illustrated in Fig. 1. The opal templates, composed of the PS spheres with diameters of 270, 300, and 350 nm, were prepared using a vertical deposition method.38 Fig. 2a–c show scan electron microscopy (SEM) images of these three opal templates, the PS spheres are hexagonally close-packed in an ordered array. From the cross-section view of the opal template (Fig. S2, ESI†), it is found that the PS spheres are also closely-packed with hexagonal structure, demonstrating that the PS spheres formed a three-dimensional fcc lattice.24 These high quality 3D opal templates are further confirmed by the sharp transmittance dips (correspondingly 630, 680, and 820 nm) caused by Bragg diffraction (Fig. 2d).42 Fabrication of the well ordered opal template is the foundation to prepare inverse opal, infiltration of the precursor is the support. In order to penetrate the precursor in the interior interstices in the opal template, an auto-forced impregnation method was used for the ZnO precursor infiltration.34 The preparation details are given in the experimental section. After calcination of these opal templates infiltrated with ZnO precursor, ZnO-PCs were obtained. ZnO-510, ZnO-600 and ZnO-720 represent ZnO-PCs fabricated from 270, 300 and 350 nm PS spheres, respectively, and 510, 600 and 720 nm are their corresponding PBG positions which will be discussed later.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram displays the fabrication process of the ZnO-PCs. The as-prepared ZnO-PC shows high light trapping efficiency caused by SPs which were tuned to interact with the dye and intensified dye photosensitization.

Fig. 3 shows images of the as-prepared ZnO-PCs, all ZnO-PCs exhibit highly ordered periodicity and spherical pore interconnectivity (Fig. 3a–c). The corresponding average pore sizes are ca. 260, 280 and 320 nm, approximately 9% shrinkage in comparison with their original PS spheres, which is attributed to the decomposition and vaporization of the PS template during the calcination process.42,43 The thicknesses of the framework walls of the ZnO-PCs are about 20–30 nm. Moreover, the film thicknesses are adjusted to similar roughness of ca. 2.7 μm to permit a worthy comparison (Fig. 3i–l). The hexagonal closely-packed structure of the ZnO-PCs is also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3d–f). The samples were fragmentized into small flakes because of ultrasonication during the TEM sample preparation. The SEM and TEM images show that 3D ZnO inverse opal structures were formed. The clear and continuous ordered lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3g–i) and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns reveal the highly single-crystalline characteristic of the ZnO-PCs. The d spacings of 0.140, 0.260, and 0.138 nm correspond to the (200), (002) and (112) planes of the ZnO crystalline structure, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 4a) of the sample also shows high crystallinity, and all diffraction peaks match well with the standard XRD pattern of monoclinic ZnO (JPCDS No. 36-1451). To affirm the pure phase of ZnO, the composition of the obtained sample is also detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. 4b). No extra peaks (C or N come from PS or zinc nitrate) belonging to any impurities are observed except for the elements of Si, Mg and Ca from the glass substrate, and Zn from the sample. That is to say the PS template and ZnO precursor are eliminated completely in the heat treatment. This is important for evaluating the photocatalytic activities of the samples and getting rid of the effect of the doping.

Fig. 5 displays the matching relationship between SPs and absorption of the probe molecule. Considering that the peak position of PBG is sensitive to the medium surrounding the material and the application of ZnO-PCs in the following environmental pollutant remediation in water,41,44,45 the transmittance spectra were characterized by filling inverse opal structure with water. It is clearly observed that the PBG maximum of ZnO-PCs are centered at 510, 600, and 720 nm, respectively, and its transmittance peak becomes broader as pore size increases. Furthermore, the PBGs of the as-designed ZnO-PCs match well with the probe molecule absorption, their blue and red edges of PBG overlap with or are far away from the probe molecule absorption. In particular, the blue edge of ZnO-510 PBG overlaps with the MO absorption, while ZnO-600 and ZnO-720 PBGs do not; for RhB, the absorption overlaps with the blue edge of ZnO-600, the red edge of ZnO-510 but is far away from ZnO-720; for MB, the absorption overlaps with the blue edge of ZnO-720, the red edge of ZnO-600 but is far away from ZnO-510. The well matched relationship establishes a worthy foundation for the next SP effect evaluation. To further test the effect of matching between the SPs and absorption of dye on the photocatalytic performance, 4-CP, a colorless probe molecule, which absorbs out of the range of all the BPGs of the ZnO-PCs, was also selected as reference.
 Fig. 5  The position relationship between the absorption peaks of the probe molecules and SPs of ZnO-PCs. 
To confirm that the SP has an enhancement effect on the light harvesting, the absorption spectra of ZnO-PCs adsorbed dye (denoted as ZnO-PCs/dye, dye is RhB or MB) as well as ZnO-P and ZnO-N are shown in Fig. 6. It is clearly observed that there is absorption enhancement in the specific region corresponding to the location of the SP at the blue-edge or red-edge of the PBG in each ZnO-PC. For example, the enhanced absorption of the ZnO-720 film is in the vicinity of 730 nm. To highlight that there is a specific spectral region in which the absorption is enhanced for ZnO-PCs/dye compared to ZnO-N/dye and ZnO-P/dye, the absorption spectra of ZnO-PCs/dye are normalized to that of the ZnO-N/dye film. The resultant absorbance enhancement spectra are shown in Fig. 6b and d. It is apparent that ZnO-PCs/dye show an enhanced absorption in a certain specific region that depends on the location of their respective SPs. These regions show a good match with the absorption of the dye (RhB 554 nm or MB 664 nm). For ZnO-PC/RhB, ZnO-600/RhB, the BSP overlaps with the RhB absorption, exhibiting the highest absorption enhancement in the vicinity of 554 nm. For ZnO-510/RhB, the RSP coincides with the RhB absorption, showing higher absorption enhancement than ZnO-700/RhB, for which the SP is far away from the RhB absorption. This demonstrates that the RhB absorption was enhanced by matching the SP well with its absorption. However, as the SP is far away from the dye absorption, the SP would have no effect on the enhancement of light harvesting (the frequency of this light corresponds to the dye absorption). To further investigate this enhancement effect, the absorption spectra of ZnO/MB was also measured and presented in Fig. 6c and d, because the RSP of ZnO-600/MB and the BSP of ZnO-720/MB show a good match with the MB absorption (Fig. 5), their light absorption was enhanced more at the MB absorption (664 nm) than the other ZnO/MB samples. Thus ZnO-600 was expected to display highly dye-sensitized photocatalytic efficiency.

(b) and (d) are the corresponding absorption enhancement spectra as a function of the wavelength (absorption enhancement = absorbance of ZnO samples/absorbance of the ZnO-N film). 
3.2 Photocatalytic performance and mechanism
To understand the original relationship between photoactivity, pore size and the SP effect in the environmental pollutants remediation, the performance of ZnO-PCs for photocatalytic degradation of various probe molecules were examined carefully under UV and visible light irradiation (Fig. S3, ESI†). The rate of photocatalytic degradation followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. The corresponding kinetic constant (k) and regression coefficients (R2) were calculated and given in Table S2, ESI.† As ZnO is UV-light sensitive, and their PBGs are located in the visible region, the photoactivity (kUV) of ZnO-PCs under UV light irradiation is the direct semiconductor ZnO photoexcited degradation.30 While under visible light irradiation, the photoactivity (kVis) is the indirect dye photoexcited degradation (its large band-gap 3.2 eV could not be excited under visible light irradiation).46
Fig. 7 (left) shows the photocatalytic abilities of ZnO-PCs to degrade probe molecules under UV light irradiation. It is clearly observed that k increases with the pore size of the inverse opal during photocatalytic degradation of MO and 4-CP. However, for photodegradation of RhB and MB, it is interestingly found that k decreases first then increases with increasing pore size. These are seemingly conflicting, but are in line with previous reports.31,33 In fact, the as-prepared ZnO-PCs have the same crystalline phase and optical structure, and the SP effect is not working in the UV-light-driven photocatalysis due to the SPs located at the visible region. Consequently, there are two main factors that influence their photocatalytic efficiency: the total surface area of the porous structure and the pore size. As the pore size increases, pore volume remains constant while the surface area decreases.4,34 The smaller surface area provides less reaction sites, which reduces photocatalytic efficiency.47 However, the big pore size facilitates mass transport, which promotes the dynamic reaction rate.18,19,48 So there is competition between the surface area and mass transport in the photocatalytic process. For MO and 4-CP, there is almost no adsorption on the ZnO-PC samples (Fig. 8 and S4, ESI†). MO and 4-CP are both anionic probe molecules, while the zeta potential of the as-prepared ZnO-PCs are about −20–−30 eV, which were measured under the photocatalytic test conditions. So it is observed that MO and 4-CP are not absorbed on the ZnO samples owing to a repulsion between charges. Under the circumstances, mass transport is the key factor resulting in the increase in k with increasing pore size. For RhB and MB, which are cationic dye molecules, there is some adsorption on the surface of the ZnO samples (Fig. 8). Further more, adsorption capacity decreases with increasing pore size, which is caused by decreasing surface area as pore size increases. In this case, the surface area and pore size have a synchronous impact on the photocatalytic reaction. While, ZnO-510 has a smaller pore size, it also has a bigger surface area, but the bigger pores of ZnO-720 facilitate mass transport. Therefore, the k firstly decreases and then increases with increasing pore size.

 Fig. 8  Adsorption capacity of the probe molecule over ZnO-PC in the dark after equilibrium of adsorption and desorption. 
To investigate directly the SP effect on the dye-sensitized photocatalytic efficiency, the photocatalytic activities of these three ZnO-PCs were examined for indirect dye photoexcited degeneration under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7 (right), ZnO-PCs exhibit almost no activity for MO photodegradation. This is because the adsorption of the dye on the photocatalyst surface is a prerequisite for dye photoexcited sensitization.49 MO is not absorbed on the surface of the ZnO samples, so the electrons photogenerated from dye excited states are unable to inject into the conduction band (CB) of ZnO samples.50–52 The dye-sensitized system will not be formed. MO was degraded over ZnO samples under UV light irradiation, this is because ZnO could be photoexcited by UV light, as shown in Fig. S5, ESI,† the photogenerated carriers captured by H2O and O2 to form hydroxyl radical (˙OH) and superoxide radical (˙O2−), which can direct react with MO. A similar situation is also observed for 4-CP photocatalytic degradation, for the reason that 4-CP has no absorption in the visible light region. This control experiment provides evidence that the degradation of RhB and MB is not due to the photoexcited semiconductor ZnO but the excitation of dyes.
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of RhB and MB can couple well with CB of the ZnO semiconductor.46,49,53–58 In this case, electrons can be transferred easily from the excited RhB or MB to the CB of ZnO and subsequently generate reactive oxidation species.50,51 As shown in Fig. S6, ESI,† ˙OH and ˙O2− were detected over ZnO adsorbed RhB or MB samples under visible light irradiation, whereas no such signals were observed for all ZnO samples without adsorption dyes under visible light irradiation and ZnO/dyes in dark. RhB or MB, being both a photosensitizer and a pollutant, are decomposed (Fig. 9).50–52 The dye-sensitized photoactivity is clearly observed for photoexcited degradation of RhB and MB. For photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation, ZnO-600 shows the best activity among ZnO-PCs, while the UV-light-driven photocatalytic k (denoted as kUV) of ZnO-600 is the lowest. It is demonstrating that the high kVis (the k under visible light irradiation) of ZnO-600 is not caused by the pore size but by the interaction of induced visible light and ZnO matrix. Particularly, this could be attributed to the blue edge of the PBG of ZnO-600 overlapping with the characteristic absorption band of RhB. SPs generated at the blue edge of the PBG increase light harvesting (Fig. 6) and are localized in the voids (here was the RhB solution),26,27 thereby BSPs reinforce the interaction between photons and RhB arising from the slow group velocity of light, and leading to a larger number of RhB excited states, which are able to inject electrons into the CB of the ZnO-600 sample for enhancement of dye photosensitized efficiency. So ZnO-600 displayed the highest k among ZnO-PCs for dye sensitized photocatalysis. Furthermore, ZnO-510 exhibits higher kVis than ZnO-720. This may be caused by active RSP (RSP interaction with the margins of the nano-framework is due to RhB adsorption on its surface)33,59 or larger surface area of ZnO-510 (ZnO-510 also showed higher kUV than ZnO-720 under UV light irradiation).
 Fig. 9  The mechanisms of the direct semiconductor photoexcited process (left) and dye (RhB or MB) photosensitization (right) over ZnO-PC under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively. 
To further verify the SP effect on the enhancement of dye sensitized photocatalysis, MB, for which the absorption overlapped with the blue edge of ZnO-720 PBG, the red edge of ZnO-600 PBG and far away from ZnO-510 PBG, the reaction was conducted in visible-light-driven photocatalysis. It is interesting to observe that the kVis follows the order: ZnO-600 > ZnO-720 > ZnO-510, which is diametrical with the result of photocatalytic degradation of MB under UV light irradiation. No matter whether the blue or red edge of the PBG overlaps with the MB absorption, their kVis are both higher than that for ZnO-510, for which the PBG is far away from the MB absorption. These results confirm the above analysis: the SP effect could improve dye photosensitized degradation when the SPs are matched well with their object molecules.
However, the k of ZnO-600 is the highest one, implying that the RSP is more active than the BSP, which is different than with RhB photodegradation (for RhB degradation, ZnO-PC exhibited the highest k when BSP overlapped with the RhB absorption). This is attributed to the fact that ZnO has stronger absorption capacity for MB (15%) than for RhB (5%). In the photocatalytic experiment, it was found that the ZnO samples showed blue after adsorption equilibrium in the MB solution in the dark. RSP shows higher light harvesting efficiency in the region of the MB absorption (Fig. 6) than BSP, the more incident light is trapped, the more MB will be excited. Furthermore, the RSP is localized on the nano-framework walls of ZnO-PCs, while the walls are covered by MB molecules, the RSP interacts with the walls and simultaneously with MB.2 The MB molecules absorbed onto the walls facilitate electron transfer from the excited MB to the CB of ZnO and then increases photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, from the above analysis, it could be concluded that the visible light trapped in the ZnO matrix by the SP effect could induce much stronger interaction of light with dye improving the dye sensitization efficiency.
To confirm that the SP has the enhancement effect on the dye photosensitization under visible light irradiation, the transient photocurrent responses of the samples were detected at zero applied bias voltage (Fig. S7, ESI†). The photocurrent intensity demonstrates the electron generation capacity and electron transfer effectiveness.60,61 Interestingly, the higher photocurrent intensities under different test conditions are consistent with the corresponding higher photocatalytic activities. The difference of photocurrent intensities among ZnO-PCs is small, which may be due to dye absorbed on the surface of the ZnO that was degraded under light irradiation. Nevertheless, the photocurrent intensity of dye sensitized ZnO is improved with respect to non dye sensitized ZnO. In particular, the RhB sensitized photocurrent is enhanced about ten times, which may represent a prospective and potential application of this matching effect in the photoelectric related fields.
4. Conclusions
In summary, ZnO-PCs with expected PBGs were successfully prepared to match various probe molecules, and we carefully investigated the pore size and the SP effect on the liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation of pollutants within the scope of inverse opals. It was found that bigger pore size facilitates mass transport while providing fewer reaction sites, and there is competition between surface area and mass transport in the photocatalytic process. Therefore, the rate constant decreases and then increases with increasing pore size for photocatalytic degradation of RhB and MB. However, as probe molecules were not adsorbed on the surface of the ZnO-PCs, mass transport is the key factor that results in the rate constant increasing with increasing pore size for photocatalytic degradation of MO and 4-CP.
The SP effect on the dye photosensitized degradation was demonstrated: the SP effect does not work for photosensitization when probe molecules were not adsorbed on the samples; whereas both the BSP and RSP were active on the enhancement of dye photosensitization when the probe molecules were absorbed and well matched with the SP. In particular, the RSP is more effective than the BSP as the adsorption capacity intensified. The improvement in photocatalytic efficiency was attributed to the synergistic effect of localization of the RSP on the ZnO/dye part of the PC structure and facilitation of electrons transferred from the excited molecules absorbed on the ZnO to the CB of ZnO. These results could help deepen the understanding of photoreactivity of photonic crystals and might open up a route for fabrication of various functional materials with advanced properties in diverse fields.
