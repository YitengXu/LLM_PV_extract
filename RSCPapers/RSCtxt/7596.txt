    , Accepted 16th August 2015First published on 26th August 2015AbstractIn this study, AgInZnS–reduced graphene (AIZS–rGO) nanocomposites with tunable band gap absorption and large specific surface area were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route, which showed highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation. The relationships between their crystal structures, morphology, surface chemical states and photocatalytic activity have been explored in detail. Importantly, the AIZS–rGO nanocomposites with 0.02 wt% of graphene exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate of 1.871 mmol h−1 g−1, which was nearly 2 times the hydrogen production rate when using pure AIZS nanoparticles as the photocatalyst. This high photocatalytic H2-production activity was attributed predominantly to the incorporation of graphene sheets, which demonstrated an obvious influence on the structure and optical properties of the AIZS nanoparticles. In the AIZS–rGO nanocomposites, graphene could not only serve as an effective supporting layer but also is a recombination center for conduction band electrons and valence band holes. It is believed that this kind of graphene-based material would attract much attention as a promising photocatalyst with a high efficiency and a low cost for photocatalytic H2 evolution and facilitates their application in the environmental protection field.
Introduction
In order to moderate the reliance on exhaustible natural resources and the environmental contamination which is caused by combustion of fossil fuels, a large number of scientists are searching for low cost renewable energy conversion materials.1–4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts has been considered as one of the most important methods to solve the energy crisis, since Honda's group reported that hydrogen could be produced through the photoelectron chemical splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes.4–7 In the past several years, large numbers of photocatalyst materials have been reported to have high photocatalytic activity for water splitting under UV light. However, UV light only accounts for 4% of the incoming solar energy, whereas visible light is 43%.4,7 Therefore, lots of research groups are searching for semiconductor materials which could be prepared as photocatalysts for water splitting to hydrogen under visible-light irradiation. In recent years, a large number of photocatalysts have been synthesized; however, only a few effective photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation have been reported. Kudo and Chen's group studied sulfide-based solid solutions respectively, such as ZnS–AgInS2,8,9 ZnS–CuInS210,11 and ZnS–AgInS2–CuInS2,12 which have been extensively studied because of their controllable band structures and excellent performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. However, high-temperature heat treatment or toxic solvents are needed for preparing these solid solutions respectively.9,10,13 Thus, developing a facile and environmentally friendly method to synthesize semiconductor materials for achieving highly efficient hydrogen production is still a challenge.
Graphene, a two dimensional carbonaceous material, can be used in many applications such as catalytic, optical, and battery applications, because of its unique properties of high conductivity, excellent mobility of charge carriers and large specific surface area. So far, lots of methods have been reported for the synthesis of graphene, including micromechanical cleavage, thermal exfoliation, and electrochemical reduction of graphite oxide. Among these methods, the reduction of exfoliated graphene oxide has been proven to be an effective approach to achieve graphene nanosheets.14–18 Recently, it has been reported that graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based semiconductors could be efficient co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production due to their good electron conductivity, large specific surface area and high adsorption.19,20 Cui et al. evaluated the photocatalytic performance of graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites, and their study demonstrated that the hydrogen production rate of graphene based nanocomposites could increase to 8.6 μmol h−1, and the productivity is nearly twice compared to the pure commercial TiO2 catalyst.21 However, most of the hydrogen production rates of the graphene based composites are not outstanding under visible light; moreover, some of them contain toxic elements such as Pb or Cd, which would lead to environmental pollution. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop an environmentally friendly method for synthesizing graphene based nanocomposites for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light.
Herein, AIZS–rGO nanocomposites with a high efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen production rate under visible-light were obtained using a hydrothermal method. The as-obtained AIZS–rGO nanocomposites reached a high hydrogen production rate of 1.871 mmol h−1 g−1 which is about 2 times that of pure AIZS nanospheres (0.951 h−1 g−1). This high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate arises from the presence of graphene, which could serve as an electron collector and transporter to efficiently lengthen the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers from AIZS nanospheres and could also effectively inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the AIZS–rGO composites. Furthermore, the successfully prepared AIZS–rGO nanocomposites provide an effective approach to synthesize graphene-based composites in the field of energy conversion.
Experimental section
Preparation of photocatalysts
AIZS photocatalysts were prepared via a hydrothermal method. In a typical experiment synthesizing the sample, Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (395 mg), InCl3·4H2O (87.9 mg), AgNO3 (19.3 mg), and an excess of thioacetamide (200 mg) were dissolved in 15 mL of distilled water using a magnetic stirrer to form a clear solution. The reaction mixture was immediately transferred into an autoclave (Teflon cups with 50 mL inner volume). The autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 18 h and then air-cooled to room temperature. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with absolute ethanol and finally air dried. Samples with different Ag, In, and Zn ratios in the starting materials were prepared under identical conditions (Ag0.01In0.23ZnS1.35, Ag0.02In0.23ZnS1.355, Ag0.04In0.23ZnS1.365 and Ag0.05In0.23ZnS1.37) in order to investigate the effect of composition on photocatalytic activities.
Preparation of GO
GO was prepared by oxidation of natural flake graphite powder using a modified Hummers’ method.22 In a typical synthesis, 1 g graphite powder and 1 g NaNO3 were mixed and then put into 46 mL concentrated H2SO4 (98%) with an ice bath. After magnetically stirring for one hour, 6 g KMnO4 was gradually added into the mixture under stirring. The mixture was then transferred to a water bath of 35 °C for one day. Successively, 40 mL H2O was slowly added into the mixture, during which the temperature of the mixture rose to approximately 80 °C. Finally, 100 mL H2O followed by 20 mL 20% H2O2 solution was added into the mixture, and the mixture was further stirred for 30 minutes. The final product (GO) was collected by centrifugation, and was repeatedly rinsed with 4% HCl solution followed by de-ionized water. Finally, the oxidized graphite was dried in an oven at 70 °C for four days.
Preparation of AIZS–rGO nanocomposites
In a typical synthesis of AIZS–rGO (AG) nanocomposites, the as-prepared GO and the precursors including Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (395 mg), InCl3·4H2O (87.9 mg), AgNO3 (19.3 mg), and an excess of thioacetamide (200 mg) were dissolved in 15 mL distilled water. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min. Next, the mixture solution was immediately transferred into an autoclave (Teflon cups with 50 mL inner volume). The autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 18 h and then air-cooled to room temperature. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with absolute ethanol and finally dried in air.
Characterization of photocatalysts
The crystal structures of products were investigated by using an Advanced Diffractometer System (D8 Advanced Diffractometer System, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). All transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 3010 microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a Phoibos 100 electron analyzer equipped with 5 channeltrons, using an unmonochromated Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The structures of hybrid nanofibers were investigated using an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover) with Cu Kα radiation. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-1601 Spectrophotometer. BET specific surface areas and pore volumes were calculated from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms determined at 77 K using an AUTO-SORB-1-MP surface analyser (the sample was outgassed under vacuum at 200 °C).
Photocatalytic reactions
The photocatalytic reaction was performed in a closed gas-circulation system. The reaction cell was made up of Pyrex glass with a quartz window suitable for vertical illumination. A 300 W high pressure Xe lamp (Oriole Instruments, USA) was used as a light source. A 420 nm cut-off filter was employed to screen the UV light. The IR component in the radiation was removed by circulating the water filter. The air in the reaction cell was removed by purging the argon gas. In all tests, 100 mg of catalyst was suspended in 100 mL of 1.2 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S solution by magnetic stirring. The reaction was carried out for different hours and the amount of hydrogen evolved was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014; molecular sieves 5A, TCD detector, Ar carrier gas).
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of the synthesized AIZS nanospheres were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1A, the main diffraction peak positions of the obtained products are 28.6°, 47.6° and 56.5°, corresponding to the diffractions of the (111), (220) and (311) planes which can be indexed to ZnS (JCPDS no. 65-0309), confirming the cubic zinc blende structure of the AIZS nanoparticles.10 It could be observed that the major peaks of the XRD patterns did not change obviously with increasing ratio of the graphene; this was due to the low ratio of graphene and the low diffraction intensity of graphene. The morphologies of AIZS nanoparticles and AIZS–rGO nanocomposites were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A low magnification TEM image of the AIZS nanospheres (Ag0.04In0.23ZnS1.365) is shown in Fig. 1B; it can be seen that big AIZS clusters with the size of 100 nm were composed of small AIZS nanocrystals. Different ratios of AIZS nanoparticles (Ag0.01In0.23ZnS1.35, Ag0.02In0.23ZnS1.355, Ag0.05In0.23ZnS1.37) were prepared, and the shape of AIZS nanoparticles did not change much (S_ Fig. 1 and 2A†). Fig. 1C shows that nearly all the AIZS nanoparticles grown on the graphene nanosheets form nanocomposites successfully, which may be because the introduced rGO could provide an ideal platform for its nucleation of AIZS nanoparticles and improve the crystallinity of AIZS nanoparticles.23 Moreover, as the size of the AIZS clusters was about 100 nm, it allowed photogenerated charge carriers moving rapidly to the surface to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. The lattice fringes of the composites were clearly observed by high resolution TEM (HRTEM); as shown in Fig. 1D, it suggested that the AIZS nanoparticles were well crystallized. High-resolution TEM further revealed the crystalline characteristics of the AIZS–rGO composites, showing that the lattice fringes of individual AIZS clusters were 0.31 nm (111) and layered graphene (Fig. 1D inset, S_Fig. 2B†).

The band edge absorption of AIZS nanoparticles played a crucial role in affecting the photocatalytic performances of photocatalysts. The UV-visible absorption spectra of AIZS nanoparticles with different rGO contents are shown in Fig. 2. The samples prepared with different weight ratios of rGO to AIZS, i.e. 0.01%, 0.02% and 0.05%, were labelled AG1, AG2 and AG5, respectively. The presence of different amounts of rGO would affect the optical properties of light absorption for the AIZS–rGO composites significantly. The pure AIZS nanoparticle sample (red line) has an intense absorption edge at 460 nm. Compared with pure AIZS nanoparticles, the band absorptions of AG1, AG2 and AG5 were systematically red shifted with increased amounts of rGO. At the same time, the color of the as-prepared AIZS nanoparticles and AIZS–rGO composites changed to olive from yellow, and the color became deeper with increasing rGO. This phenomenon could be attributed to the chemical bonding between AIZS nanoparticles and the specific sites of carbon.24 It could have a higher photocatalytic activity because the light absorption intensity of the AIZS–rGO composites was stronger than that of bare AIZS nanoparticles.25–27

To explore the specific surface area and pore-size distribution of the as-prepared AIZS–rGO nanocomposites, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) gas-sorption measurement was employed to analyse those two factors, which would improve the catalytic performance greatly. Fig. 3 shows nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves of AIZS–rGO nanocomposites. From Fig. 3A, it was observed that the hysteresis loop of the N2 sorption isotherm for AIZS–rGO could be classified as type IV (according to IUPAC classification) in a relative pressure range between 0.5 and 0.9,28 which indicated the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm). Furthermore, the isotherm showed highly absorption at relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.9) that revealing the formation of mesopores and micropores,29 which probably due to the irregular assembly of nanoparticles in the nanocomposites.25 In addition, the mean pore-size of AIZS–rGO nanocomposites was approximately 2–6 nm with a narrow pore size distribution as revealed in Fig. 3B, further confirming the presence of mesopores and macropores,29 which were caused by both porous AIZS nanospheres and rGO sheets. It was shown that the BET surface area of the as-prepared AIZS–rGO samples gradually expanded with increasing the graphene content; the corresponding value of the samples increases up to 11.5056 m2 g−1 (from 70.3424 to 81.8480 m2 g−1), which was mainly because the graphene-doping density was much lower than AIZS nanospheres. As the result of the large surface area of the AIZS–rGO nanocomposites, it could provide more activity sites for reaction and facilitate more effective charge carrier transportation and thus achieve a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation.30

In order to analyse the surface chemical states and the valence of AIZS nanospheres, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyse AIZS nanospheres in the AG2 nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 4A, the binding energies for Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 were 367.0 eV and 373.5 eV. It was observed that the In 3d core split into 3d5/2 (444.5 eV) and 3d3/2 (373.5 eV) peaks (Fig. 4B). The XPS spectrum of Zn 2p from AG2 is shown in Fig. 4C, and the peaks for Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are located at 1022 eV and 1044 eV. From Fig. 4D, it could be realized that the S 2p peaks are located at 161.3 and 162.2 eV. All of the above measurement results showed that the valencies of the elements Ag, In, Zn and S were 1+, 3+, 2+ and 2−, respectively, which were in agreement with the reported data in the literature.31,32

Based on the above analyses, it was reasonable to expect that the as-obtained AIZS–rGO composites would be ideal photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation. In order to measure and compare the photocatalytic hydrogen production activities of the aforementioned samples, 1.2 mol L−1 Na2SO3 and 0.7 mol L−1 Na2S as sacrificial agents were used in aqueous solution, and the reaction system was evacuated after each run. The comparison of the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of pure AIZS including Ag0.01In0.23ZnS1.35, Ag0.02In0.23ZnS1.355, Ag0.04In0.23ZnS1.365 and Ag0.05In0.23ZnS1.37 nanoparticles was carried out, and the best one of these Ag0.04In0.23ZnS1.365 nanoparticles was employed to prepare AIZS–rGO composites (S_ Fig. 3†). The further hydrogen evolution study of the rGO, pure AIZS, AG1, AG2 and AG5 samples is shown in Fig. 5. The H2-production activities of rGO and the pure AIZS nanospheres were measured for reference; it was observed that hydrogen was not detected when pure rGO was used alone as the photocatalyst, while pure AIZS nanospheres showed low photocatalytic H2 production activities (0.951 mmol h−1 g−1), which is mainly because the nanoparticles introduced many recombination sites for conduction band (CB) electrons and valence band (VB) holes. Interestingly, when a small amount of graphene (0.01 wt%) was present, the H2 evolution rate of the sample of AG1 was slightly enhanced to 1.755 mmol h−1 g−1, and when the amount of graphene further increased to 0.02 wt%, the rate of H2 evolution reached 1.871 mmol h−1 g−1, which was about 2 times that when using pure AIZS nanoparticles as photocatalysts. Normally, the photocatalytic reaction of AIZS nanoparticles was low because these charge carriers recombined quickly and only a fraction of the electrons and holes participated. However, for the composite structure of AIZS–rGO nanocomposites, it could provide great numbers of photocatalytic active sites and adsorb more photons and reactants, which is the reason for the superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of pure AIZS nanoparticles. On the contrary, an obvious degradation of the activity of hydrogen evolution was observed when graphene-doping further increased to 0.05 wt%; it was demonstrated that there was an optimal loading amount of graphene on the hydrogen production efficiency. This can be explained as due to the fact that the excessive loading of graphene may increase the opacity and block the visible light through the reaction solution, and a similar phenomenon has been observed in other systems.33–35
 Fig. 5  Comparison of H2 evolution rates of different samples under visible light irradiation in the mixed aqueous solution containing 1.2 mol L−1 Na2SO3 and 0.7 mol L−1 Na2S as sacrificial agents. An 800 W Xe–Hg lamp was used as the light source. 
During the process of the reaction (Scheme 1), the electrons (e−) of AIZS nanoparticles were excited from the VB to the CB, thereby under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), creating holes in the VB and forming electron–hole pairs. The CB electrons of AIZS can reduce H+ to produce H2 and the holes accumulating at the VB of AIZS can react with the S2−/SO32− solution.36 On one side, some electrons in the VB were used to reduce H+ that existed at the surface of AIZS nanospheres to H2 directly. And on the other side, with the formation of a chemical bond between AIZS nanoparticles and graphene, some photogenerated electrons could be transferred to the carbon atoms on the graphene nanosheets, thus facilitating the separation of photogenerated carriers and lengthening the lifetime of charge carriers, and reaction with H+ to produce H2. The main reactions during the hydrogen evolution production using AIZS–rGO composites as photocatalysts can be represented using the following eqn (1)–(6):37 (1) rGO(2e−) + 2H+ → rGO + H2(2) AIZS(h+) + H2O + SO32− → AIZS + SO42− + H+(3) AIZS(2h+) + 2S2− → S22− + AIZS(4) S22− + SO32− → S2O32− + S2−(5) AIZS(h+) + SO32− + S2− → S2O32− + AIZS(6)

The Na2SO3 and Na2S solutions in this process play a key role in improving the photocatalytic H2 production activity of AIZS–rGO nanocomposites; it has been proved that no H2 can be detected when the solution is replaced by the frequently used sacrificial agent methanol.38 In summary, the AIZS–rGO composites have several advantages, including an increase in the number of active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers, an improvement of interfacial charge transfer and the suppression of charge recombination; all of these strongly suggest that the graphene doped in AIZS can enhance the hydrogen photocatalytic activity.
Conclusions
In summary, nanocomposites of AIZS–rGO have been synthesized successfully by a simple, convenient and low-cost hydrothermal method and can be used for visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It also has been proven as a new pathway to synthesize novel graphene-based photocatalytic materials. The result showed that the optimal graphene loading content was measured to be about 0.02 wt% and the corresponding H2-production rate was 1.871 mmol h−1 g−1. This highly efficient photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production of AIZS–rGO composites is mainly attributed to two factors: the presence of mesoporous structures with large specific surface area and the doping with graphene which enhances the charge separation and transfer. Moreover, this work also showed that graphene-based materials have tremendous potential applications in solar energy conversion.
