    , Accepted 27th January 2012First published on 9th February 2012AbstractBinder-free electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and mechanical compression were employed to fabricate TiO2 photoanodes for use in all-plastic substrate flexible dye-sensitized solar cells having a gel electrolyte. The photoanodes were composed of commercial 20 nm TiO2 powders with and without the addition of 160 nm TiO2 powders. The EPD was performed under different DC powers and deposition times to obtain photoanodes having different thicknesses. Depending on the thickness, various electron diffusion times, ranging from 8.08 to 12.40 ms, and electron lifetimes, ranging from 16.79 to 32.05 ms, were obtained for the photoanodes consisting of only commercial 20 nm TiO2. The electron diffusion time was reduced and the electron lifetime remained the same as a result of the addition of another commercial 160 nm TiO2 powder. The added 160 nm TiO2 powders enhanced the light absorptance by serving as light scattering centers. All-plastic flexible dye-sensitized solar cells were made and evaluated. Compared to the 20 nm TiO2 only cells, the cells containing mixed powders exhibit enhanced efficiencies and the enhancement can be as much as 22%.
Introduction
In recent years, both academia and industry have paid great attention to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) due to their low cost production, simple processing, and relatively high efficiency up to 11%.1–3 The electrodes in typical DSCs are supported on indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, making the cells rigid. However, considering the weight reduction and the growing number of flexible electronic devices, DSCs having plastic substrates such as ITO-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)4 and ITO-coated poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN)5,6 are receiving increasing interest. An added advantage is that the use of these substrates allows the fabrication of flexible DSCs (FDSCs) based on large scale roll-to-roll processes. Due to the use of plastics, typical photoanode synthesis temperatures cannot exceed 150 °C. As a result, one of the challenges facing the development of such FDSCs is to obtain photoanodes having well-connected TiO2 nanoparticles and good adhesion to the substrates. In conventional rigid DSCs, the photoanodes are synthesized at high temperatures near 450 °C. At these temperatures, not only organic additives can be effectively removed but also the desired necking among TiO2 nanoparticles is achieved. On the other hand, for plastic substrate FDSCs, the necking cannot occur and organic additives are likely to remain in the photoanodes. Many low temperature synthesis processes have therefore been investigated to enhance the contacts among TiO2 nanoparticles and the adhesion between photoanode and substrate. Yamaguchi et al. pioneered a mechanical compression method for the fabrication of plastic substrate FDSCs.7 In another approach, glass substrates were pre-treated using a TiCl4 aqueous solution to enhance the adhesion between the TiO2 layer and the glass substrate, and the deposited TiO2 layer was also treated using the same solution to improve the binding among TiO2 nanoparticles.8,9 Both treatments were performed at 70 °C. Such TiCl4 treatment, however, can only be used for glass substrates not plastic substrates due to the vulnerable chemical resistance of the plastic to TiCl4 solution. A chemical sintering process was studied to allow chemical bonding among the TiO2 nanoparticles due to the addition of an acid or a base agent.10 This study also used glass as the substrate.
The approach used here involves electrophoretic deposition (EPD). However, so far there are very few reports investigating the use of EPD to fabricate TiO2 photoanodes on different rigid or flexible substrates. Miyasaka et al. used an EPD technique followed by 150 °C annealing for the fabrication of photoanodes on ITO–PET substrates.11 However, the counter electrode was made on a SnO2 glass substrate, making the cell rigid. The TiO2 used was a mixture of commercial F-5 (average particle size = 20 nm) and G-2 (average particle size = 500 nm) powders, and the weight ratio of F-5:G-2 was 3. In order to obtain a high current density (9.0 mA cm−2) and therefore a high cell efficiency (4.1%), repeated cycles of EPD and wet chemical binding treatments were used. Without the cycles, the current density and cell efficiency were low and poor. The cycled processes, giving a photoanode thickness of 10 μm, were also found to give the needed adhesion between the photoanode and the ITO–PET substrate. It is noted that a very high electrical field of 1200 V cm−1 was used. Another work also involved the use of rigid glass substrates. Photoanodes consisting of either commercial P-25 (average particle size 22 nm) or P-90 (average particle size 14 nm) TiO2 powders were fabricated on FTO glass substrates using an EPD technique followed by compression and/or annealing at 150 or 500 °C.12 The focus was on improving the high temperature sintered photoanodes for use in rigid cells. However, an extra step of applying non-polar volatile organic liquids to fill the pores of EPD TiO2 coatings was used before the compression. Also, multiple EPD coatings were needed to obtain a final thickness near 25 μm.

        TiO2 photoanodes were prepared on flexible Ti-metal sheets using EPD, at a high electric field of 48 V cm−1, followed by chemical treatment with tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT) and sintering at 450 °C.13 The photoanode consists of a transparent layer (P-25 powders) and a light-scattering layer (100 nm TiO2 powders), with the weight ratio of the transparent to the light-scattering layer being 12.5. A conversion efficiency of 6.33% was obtained as a result of the extra TBT treatment (photoanode thickness = 11 μm). Such a treatment is needed for the formation of secondary anatase TiO2, interconnecting the primary TiO2 particles and improving the adhesion of the photoanode to the substrate. A recent study reports the preparation of TiO2 photoanodes (P-25) on an ITO–PEN substrate using EPD followed by mechanical compression.14 A very high electric field of 300 V cm−1 was used and the effect of compression pressure was addressed. The resulting cell exhibited a conversion efficiency up to 4.37% at a photoanode thickness of 10.9 μm.
In this study, we have investigated the use of EPD for the fabrication of photoanodes of all-plastic FDSCs. Low voltage (≦25 V) or electric field (≦25 V cm−1) was used. Also, no chemical treatment was applied during the fabrication of the photoanodes. Either P-25 or a mixture of P-25 and ST-41 (commercial 160 nm TiO2 powders) was used. Furthermore, a gel-electrolyte was used in the resulting cells. The effects on the photoanode characteristic of the performance of the resulting cells are addressed and discussed.
Experimental
A suspension fluid containing P-25 (20 nm in diameter, 80% anatase:20% rutile, Degussa, Germany) and ST-41 (160 nm in diameter, 100% anatase, Ishihara Sangyo, Japan) TiO2 powders, absolute anhydrous ethanol, and acetylacetone were first prepared. The solid to liquid ratio was 3g L−1. The volume ratio of acetylacetone to anhydrous ethanol is less than 0.2%. The weight ratio of P-25 to ST-41 was 3:1. The suspension fluid was stirred for one day to ensure homogeneity. A solution containing iodine, ketone, and deionized water was used as the charge solution15 and mixed with the suspension fluid to become the electrophoresis suspension. The EPD bath consists of an ITO–PEN cathode, an ITO glass anode, and the electrophoretic suspension. The distance between the two electrodes was fixed at 1 cm and the applied voltage ranged from 5 to 25 V. The EPD time was either 2 or 4 min. After EPD, the TiO2 deposited on ITO–PEN was subjected to heat treatment at 140 °C to remove excess residuals and then mechanically compressed at 50 MPa. The resulting samples were then used as the photoanodes in FDSCs. cis-bis-(Isothiocyanato)-bis-(2,2′bipyridyl-4,4′dicarboxylato) ruthenium (II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719) was used as the dye. A redox gel consisting of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), and polyacrylonitrile-co-vinyl acetate polymer (PAN-VA) was used as the electrolyte. Pt-coated ITO–PEN was used as the counter electrode.
The resulting photoanodes and cells were subjected to various characterizations. The photoanodes were analyzed using α-step and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method for determining the thickness and surface area, respectively. The photoanodes were also examined for the morphologies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The amount of dye adsorbed on the photoanode was determined by first desorbing the dye from the photoanode using a 0.1 M NaOH solution. The dye-containing NaOH solution was then inspected using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The UV–Vis spectrophotometer was also used to determine the light absorptance of the dye-loaded photoanode. The J–V characteristics of the resulting cells were determined using a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, the equivalent of one sun at AM1.5G). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the cells was also determined. The electron transport properties were investigated using intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) under a light intensity of 15 mW cm−2 at a wavelength of 455 nm.
Results and discussion
Depending on the EPD voltage and time, photoanodes having different thicknesses were obtained. The photoanode thickness was found to be thicker at a longer EPD time and increased linearly with the EPD voltage as shown in Fig. 1. The linearity follows the Hamaker law which depicts that the deposition yield is proportional to the electric field.16 The photoanodes were dye-loaded and the dye loading capability was examined. Fig. 2A shows the relation between dye loading per working surface area and the photoanode thickness. Although in general the dye loading per working surface area seems to be proportional to the thickness, a closer examination including both the BET surface area and the dye loading per volume reveals further information. This is shown in Fig. 2B where two vertical dashed lines divide the plot into three different regions. Samples in the left region show very close values of dye loading per volume and so do those in the middle region. In these two regions, the respective average dye loading per volume increases with the BET surface area. In the right region, the relation between the dye loading per volume and the BET surface area is somewhat different. This, and the consequences will be discussed later.

The results given in Fig. 1 and 2 show that EPD is a facile way for fabricating photoanodes having not only controlled thicknesses but also controlled porosities and dye loading. The obtained P25-only photoanodes on plastic substrates were then used for the fabrication of all-plastic FDSCs. The measured J–V curves for selected cells are shown in Fig. 3. These P25-only cells have the photoanodes shown in the right region in Fig. 2B. Therefore, they bear the same IDs. The resulting short circuit current density Jsc (mA cm−2), open circuit voltage Voc (V), fill factor FF, and conversion efficiency η (%), together with the photoanode thickness and the dye loading are listed in Table 1. The conversion efficiency ranges from 1.54 to 4.34%. The FFs are basically the same, averaging 0.66 ± 0.023%, so are the open circuit voltages, which average 0.68 ± 0.012 V. The Voc is less than that of typical cells having a liquid electrolyte dye due to the higher electrical resistance of the gel electrolyte used. The presence of PAN promotes the dissociation of LiI, leading to a high Li+ ion concentration in the gel electrolyte.17 This therefore results in a positive shift of the TiO2 bandgap.18 The major difference is the short circuit current density. The short circuit current density dominates the conversion efficiency. The efficiency increases linearly with the current density (please see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Materials.†). Meanwhile, the short circuit current density was found to be linearly proportional to the amount of total dye loading, as shown in Fig. 4. In this Figure, dye loading per working surface area represents the total dye loading as all the photoanodes have the same working surface area. A discussion based on further analysis of selected cells (cells F, G, H, and I) using UV–Vis spectroscopy, IMPS/IMVS, and IPCE is given below. These cells in general have higher efficiencies than the rest.

The optical absorbances of dye-sensitized photoanodes F, G, H, and I are shown in Fig. 5, from which the total absorbances were determined and are given in Table 1. The optical absorbance increases with the photoanode thickness (please see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Materials.†). The electron diffusion time τd was obtained from the IMPS measurements and is shown in Table 1. The value ranges from 8.08 to 12.40 ms. Since the photoanodes have different thicknesses, the diffusion time per thickness, τd/t, was determined. The values of τd/t are 1.05, 1.01, 0.73, and 0.73 for cells F, G, H, and I, respectively. The former two have similar values of τd/t and so do the latter two. In other words, the electron diffusion times per unit length in the latter two photoanodes are faster than those of the former two. A photoanode having better light absorbance and a larger electron injection efficiency, ηinj, would have more photoelectrons generated. As the surface states in the P-25 photoanodes are the same, more traps can be occupied in a photoanode having more photoelectrons. This leads to a faster diffusion time per unit length. Therefore the product of light absorbance, dye loading, and ηinj is used as a figure of merit (FOM), i.e., FOM = light absorbance × dye loading × ηinj. The values of FOMs are 18, 13, 34, and 33 for cells F, G, H, and I, respectively. It is seen that the FOMs of cells F and G are less than those of cells H and I. Therefore the values of τd/t of cells F and G are longer than those of cells H and I. From the IMVS measurements the values of electron lifetime τn, ranging from 16.79 to 32.05 ms, were obtained and are also given in Table 1. It is seen that in general the electron lifetime is proportional to the photoanode thickness. This can be explained by considering the electron density, and the recombination of the redox couple and photoelectron. After the incident light enters into a cell from the current collector side, the photon flux reduces with the light path, i.e., the photoanode thickness, due to light absorption. Since a higher photon flux generates more photoelectrons, the electron density is always higher near the current collector.19 For a thicker photoanode, it is more difficult for a redox couple in the electrolyte to diffuse near to the current collector; therefore less recombination occurs near the current collector.20 As a result, a longer electron lifetime is obtained. On the other hand, for the region near the electrolyte side, the electron density in the photoanode is smaller due to the lower photon flux.19 Although a redox couple readily presents in this region, less recombination occurs due to the lower electron density.21–23 The thicker a photoanode is, the lower the electron density or the lower the recombination. From this viewpoint, again, the electron lifetime increases with the photoanode thickness.

The above cells have photoelectrodes consisting of exclusively P-25 powders. It is known that another TiO2 powder, i.e., ST-41, is often used for the fabrication of scattering layers in photoanodes. In such a typical cell assembly, the photoanode consists of a P-25 and a ST-41 layer, and the latter serves as the scattering layer. However, in this study, we have fabricated photoanodes consisting of a mixture of both types of powders, anticipating that the ST-41 powders would serve as scattering centers. The resulting cells having such photoanodes are cells O and Q shown in Table 1. Cells O and Q have similar photoanode thicknesses as those of cells G and I, respectively. Therefore comparisons will be made between cells G and O, and between cells I and Q. Due to the addition of larger ST-41 powders, the specific surface areas are reduced. The dye loadings thereby reduce by 38%, comparing cells O to G and 36%, comparing cells Q to I. However, the Jsc and the conversion efficiency of the P-25/ST-41 containing cells, i.e., cells O and Q, are better than cells G and I, respectively. The J–V curves for cells O and Q are shown in Fig. 3. Comparing cells O to G, an 11% increase in the Jsc was obtained, leading to a 22% increase in the conversion efficiency. Comparing cells Q to I, a 24% increase in the Jsc was obtained, leading to an 18% increase in the conversion efficiency. The lesser improvement in the cell efficiency for cell Q is due to its lower FF than that of cell I. The enhancement in Jsc can be understood by considering the fact that the ST-41 powders serve as scattering centers. Fig. 6A and 6B show SEM images of P-25 only and P-25/ST-41 containing photoanodes, respectively. Fig. 6A shows that the P-25 powders are well-connected. The addition of ST-41 powders does not affect the connection among P-25 powders that are in contact, as shown in Fig. 6B. More importantly, due to their appropriate sizes, ST-41 powders serve to scatter light24,25 such that light harvesting is enhanced. This therefore leads to improved IPCE performance. The IPCEs of cells O and Q are shown in Fig. 7A. Both cells O and Q apparently have better IPCE performances than the rest of the cells. For a further comparison, normalized IPCE spectra of cells G, I, O, and Q are shown in Fig. 7B. Significant enhancement of the IPCE performance is seen. It is obvious that light scattering occurs due to the addition of ST-41 powders into P-25 powders. In other words, the result indicates that the larger ST-41 powders serve as the light scattering centers as expected.

 Fig. 7  (A) IPCE spectra of selected cells and (B) normalized IPCE spectra of cells G, I, O, and Q. 
Due to the better IPCE performance or higher Jsc, there are more electrons in photoanodes O and Q. Also, the ST-41 powders are pure anatase TiO2, giving less resistance for electron transport than the rutile-containing P-25 powders.26 As a result, the electron diffusion times of photoanodes O and Q are faster, as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, the electron lifetimes appear to be the same, regardless of the addition of ST-41 powders. Photoanode I has a lower current density than photoanode Q which would have resulted in a lower recombination rate and therefore a longer lifetime in cell I. However, the pore volumes of photoanode I (0.28 cm3 g−1) are 40% higher than those of photoanode Q (0.20 cm3 g−1). This indicates that the electrolyte penetrates into the pores more easily in cell I than in cell Q. Thus the electrons in photoanode I have a higher probability of recombining with the holes in the electrolyte, leading to a reduced electron lifetime. For the same reason, cells G and O exhibit similar electron lifetimes. Finally, from the τd and τn values, the charge collection efficiency ηcc was determined.27Cell O has a slightly higher ηcc (58.5%) than G (51.9%) due to the slightly faster τd (7.05 vs. 8.08 ms). For the same reason, cell Q has a higher ηcc (88.8%) than I (59.6%). The τd for cell I and Q are respectively 9.3 and 2.58 ms.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated a binder-free EPD process for the fabrication of TiO2 photoanodes on ITO–PEN plastic substrates. The photoanodes consist of commercial P-25 with and without the addition of ST-41 TiO2 powders. The EPD process allows the control of not only the thickness but also the porosities and dye loading of the photoanode. Depending on the thickness, photoanodes exhibiting different light absorbances, dye loadings, and electron injection efficiencies were obtained. These characteristics in turn dominate the electron diffusion time and electron lifetime. The electron diffusion time was reduced and the electron lifetimes remained the same as a result of the addition of ST-41 powders. The addition of ST-41 powders leads to enhanced light absorptance as they serve as light scattering centers. Compared to the P-25 only cells, the P-25/ST-41 containing cells exhibit enhanced efficiencies and the enhancement can be as much as 22%.
