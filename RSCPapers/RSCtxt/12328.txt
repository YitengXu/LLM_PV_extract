Although typical approaches to the chemical deposition of chalcogenide films have some advantages such as large-area coverage and high thickness controllability, these processes require highly toxic and expensive hydrogenated materials. Here, we demonstrate an enhanced sulfur reaction with an environmentally safe and cost-competitive method using a thermal sulfur cracker cell. The elevated cracking-zone temperature enhanced the reactivity of sulfur by cracking evaporated sulfur molecules into smaller molecules, and resulted in the formation of a high-quality ZnS phase maintaining a low substrate temperature. The fabricated ultra-thin ZnS film played an excellent role as a buffer layer of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cell, as the film showed high photovoltaic performances.
Introduction
Interest in metal chalcogenide materials has been continuously growing for various optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaics,1–3 display devices,4 and batteries5 due to their good electrical and optical properties. The metal chalcogenide compound contains one or more chalcogen elements such as sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, exhibiting semiconducting properties by bonding with transition metal elements. Recently, among metal chalcogenide materials, sulfur-based compounds such as ZnS, MoS2, CuS, CdS, SnS, SnS2−xSex, Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2, and Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4 are being extensively studied because of their high carrier mobility, large band-gap, and good photovoltaic properties.6–13 Conventionally, among various techniques of fabricating sulfur-based films, atomic layer deposition (ALD), ion-layer gas reaction (ILGAR), chemical bath deposition (CBD), and spin-coating are promising due to their high step-coverage, thickness controllability, and large-area uniformity.11,14 However, these techniques have some drawbacks. The H2S gas or hydrazine (N2H4) solution, widely used in the ALD, ILGAR, and spin coating methods, are highly toxic and extremely expensive.15,16 Furthermore, the metal precursor, including a metal element bonded to atomic or molecular ligands, is more expensive than pure metals. On the other hand, the wet processes, such as CBD and spin-coating, rule out vacuum compatibility. In order to overcome these environmental, cost, and vacuum compatibility issues, we need to use safe, cheap, and solid-state non-ionized materials for the fabrication of sulfur-based chalcogenide films. However, the metal and sulfur sources are more stable than the ionized forms, which require a high vapor pressure and a great deal of energy (e.g. high-temperature substrate heating) for the reaction between metal and sulfur. The high substrate temperature can raise the manufacturing cost and induce performance degradation when the underlying device is vulnerable to heat.
In this study, we suggest a novel method of enhancing the reactivity of sulfur by applying a great deal of thermal energy into evaporated sulfur molecules with a thermal cracker cell using non-toxic and low-cost materials. Shin et al. utilized the sulfur cracker for fabrication of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 light absorber layers.17,18 We have observed the effect of the thermal sulfur cracker cell on the formation of chalcogenide ZnS thin films and investigated its feasibility for the application for a photovoltaic device. This study offers various advantages of cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and vacuum-compatibility in the manufacturing process of sulfur-based chalcogenide films for optoelectronic devices.
Experimental
ZnS unit layer
The 50 nm-thick Zn film was firstly deposited on the soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate by using DC-sputtering with a power of 40 W and an Ar working pressure of 90 mTorr at room temperature. A commercial Zn sputter target (TASCO, 99.999% purity) was used. The Zn-deposited sample was successively moved into another vacuum chamber for a sulfur reaction by using the cracker cell. In the sulfur reaction process, TR-zone, base pressure, and working pressure were 150 °C, <1.0 × 10−6 Torr, and ∼5.0 × 10−5 Torr, respectively. Tsub and TC-zone were varied at R.T.–550 °C and 400–1000 °C, respectively. The sulfur source (Cerac) was solid granules with a purity of 99.9%.
The optical transmittance of the ZnS film was observed using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4001). The phase behavior of the sulfur-reacted Zn film was analyzed by a grazing-incident 2θ–ω scan using a multi-purpose X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, X'pert PRO-MPD). We observed the film morphology using an SEM (FEI, Magellan 400). The XPS (ULVAC-PHI, PHI-5000) measurement revealed the chemical states of the ZnS films prepared on the SLG substrates. The XPS spectra of the ZnS films were obtained with an Mg Kα source (1253.6 eV) and a pass energy of 20 eV and were repeatedly taken at different time intervals by Ne ion sputtering with an energy of 2 keV.
Application to CIGS thin-film solar cell device
For an application of ZnS to a buffer layer, we fabricated the CIGS thin-film solar cell with a typical Al/Ni/ITO/ZnO/ZnS/CIGS/Mo/SLG structure without an anti-reflection coating using the DC-magnetron sputtered Mo back contact, co-evaporated CIGS, RF-sputtered ITO/ZnO window layer, and e-beam evaporated Al/Ni grid. A 2.3 μm-thick CIGS film was deposited via a well-known multi-stage process. A detailed description of the solar cell fabrication can be found elsewhere.19–21
The morphology of the very thin ZnS film (∼8 nm) was observed using an SEM and a TEM (FEI, Tencai g20). The REELS (VG ESCALAB 210) measurement revealed the energy band-gap of the thin ZnS films prepared on the CIGS film. The REELS spectra were excited with the primary electron energy of 500 and 1780 eV. A secondary ion-mass spectrometer (SIMS, CAMECA IMS 6f) analysis of the 8 nm-ZnS/CIGS sample was carried out using O2+ primary ion bombardment including a 200 nA primary current rastered over a 200 μm × 200 μm area with 15 keV impact energy. The XPS spectra of the 8 nm-ZnS/CIGS sample were acquired at different time intervals by Ar ion sputtering with an energy of 1 keV. The I–V characteristics of the CIGS solar cells were measured using an I–V source meter (Keithley 2400) under a global Air Mass 1.5 spectrum for 1000 W m−2 irradiance at room temperature. Each solar cell was mechanically isolated and the effective area was 0.47 cm2. The external quantum efficiency was acquired using spectrally resolved monochromatic light with a 12 W halogen lamp (PV measurement).
Results and discussion
We used a cracker cell (JMON, SCS-500D) for the sulfur reaction, as shown in Fig. 1a.22–24 The sulfur cracker cell is a layout design of down-pouring sources consisting of a reservoir zone (R-zone, typical Knudsen cell) annexing a thermal cracking zone (C-zone) in series. The vapor phase of sulfur, evaporated from solid-phase granule sources in the R-zone (fixed at 150 °C), goes through the C-zone (varied from 400 to 1000 °C). At 150 °C the S8 molecule is known to dominantly exist in sulfur vapor because the formation enthalpy of S8 (=24.32 kcalth mol−1) is smaller than those of S2, S3, and S4 (=31.20, 33.81, and 34.84 kcalth mol−1, respectively).25 When sulfur vapor passes through the C-zone, the number of species, such as S2, S3, and S4, rapidly increases above 500 °C.25 This is because a portion of S8 is cracked into smaller molecules at high temperatures. Thus, the cracked sulfur vapor during high-temperature treatment at C-zone is believed to greatly enhance the chemical reactivity compared to that of non-cracked sulfur molecular vapor.

In order to experimentally observe the effect of the C-zone on the sulfur reaction, we used Zn metal deposited on the SLG as a reactant precursor and varied the cracking-zone temperature (TC-zone) for the sulfur reaction process. Moreover, we varied the substrate temperature (Tsub) from R.T. to 550 °C at each TC-zone. An as-grown 50 nm-Zn film showed a relatively low transmittance of ∼30%, whereas, the transmittance of Zn film increased after the sulfur reaction. The enhancement of transmittance after the sulfur reaction implies the formation of the ZnS phase since the semiconducting ZnS film has a bandgap energy at a short wavelength of ∼360 nm. Fig. 1b shows the difference of the average transmittances (ΔTavg.) of ZnS films as a function of TC-zone and Tsub. The ΔTavg. values were obtained by comparing the average transmittances of the film before and after sulfur reactions in the wavelength range of 400–1500 nm. The ΔTavg. increased at each TC-zone with increasing Tsub. At a TC-zone of 1000 °C, the ΔTavg. rapidly increased in proportion to Tsub and saturated at lower Tsub (over 340 °C). The observation indicates that ZnS compound formation begins at Tsub ≥ 340 °C and rapidly develops with the cracking temperature of 1000 °C. The Tsub of 340 °C that resulted in ZnS formation was much lower than the reported heating temperature over 500 °C in sulfurization processes for ZnS films.26,27 We closely investigated the physical properties of ZnS films grown at Tsub = 350 °C, indicating remarkable change of the ΔTavg. as a function of TC-zone, as expressed by A, B, and C in Fig. 1b.

Fig. 2a shows the planar and cross-sectional SEM images of the ZnS film formed at a Tsub of 350 °C with different TC-zones of 400 °C, 700 °C, and 1000 °C. Additionally, the morphological characteristics of the sputter-deposited Zn film prior to the sulfur reaction were investigated. The pure Zn film consisted of very small island-shaped grains with diameter sizes of 20–40 nm containing a number of voids. This is resulted from the larger surface energy of the Zn film (∼0.99 J m−2)28 than that of a glass substrate (amorphous SiO2, ∼0.34 J m−2);29i.e., Zn grows in an island shape on glass.30 At TC-zone of 400 °C, the grain size increased and the void size also became larger. The grains came to agglomerate with the adjacent small grains, enlarging the voids, yet the grain size is still too small to fill up the voids because of the low reactivity of sulfur. At higher TC-zone of 700 °C and 1000 °C, the enhanced reactivity of sulfur expanded the grain size and the voids disappeared. Consequently, as TC-zone increased, the grain size of ZnS expanded both laterally and vertically and filled up the voids although the final film seemed to be slightly porous. For a better understanding, the schematic images of the ZnS film growth at each TC-zone condition are illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2a. The sulfur reaction at the elevated TC-zone is an effective void-filling process converting the void-containing island-shaped grains into a void-free dense film.

(a) SEM top-view and cross-section images, (b) optical transmission spectra, and (c) GIXRD spectra of the Zn films after a sulfur reaction with different TC-zones of 400 °C, 700 °C, and 1000 °C. The X-ray diffraction patterns were identified as Zn (solid circle) and ZnS (star) by JCPDF 87-0713 and JCPDF 36-1450, respectively. 
The optical, structural, and chemical properties of the sulfur-reacted Zn films were investigated. The optical transmittance of ZnS films increased with increasing TC-zone in the whole range of wavelength (300–2000 nm) as shown in Fig. 2b. The ZnS film formed above a TC-zone of 700 °C exhibited a sharp kink of the spectra near the band-gap energy (<400 nm). The optical band-gap energy of the ZnS film with TC-zone = 1000 °C was estimated to be 3.40 eV from a Tauc plot.
The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) result is shown in Fig. 2c. On increasing TC-zone, the diffraction peak of the ZnS (002) phase emerged while both the peaks of Zn (101) and Zn (002) phases decreased. The ZnS film with TC-zone = 1000 °C (C) showed only the ZnS phases with the strong (002)-orientated texture, which is consistent with the transmittance result of Fig. 2b.

Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of Zn 2p3/2 peaks at different depths of the film with sputtering times of 3 min and 60 min, with varying TC-zones. The spectra obtained at 3 min-sputter time indicate the chemical states near the surface of the film with removal of the carbon contamination, while the spectra acquired at 60 min-sputter time indicate the information near the interface between the film and the substrate. At both the sputtering times of 3 min and 60 min, the Zn 2p3/2 peaks shifted from binding energies assigned to Zn (∼1021.5 eV)31 to higher energies for ZnS (∼1022.0 eV)32,33 at TC-zone of 1000 °C. This result suggests that the ZnS film was completely formed at the high TC-zone of 1000 °C while the unreacted Zn phase remained up to TC-zone of 700 °C. The intensity and position of the S 2p peak showed little change as a function of both the TC-zone and sputtering time as shown in Fig. S1.†

We fabricated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin-film solar cells with a structure of Al/Ni/ITO/ZnO/ZnS/CIGS/Mo/SLG, as shown in Fig. 5a, to verify the feasibility of the cracker-ZnS buffer layer for a photovoltaic application. The thickness of the ZnS layer (tZnS) was varied from 0 to 30 nm using different Zn thicknesses. Table 1 shows photovoltaic performance parameters including the power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of one of the best PCEs at each tZnS. A PCE of 7.97% was achieved at a tZnS of 8 nm, which was largely improved compared with the solar cell without a buffer (3.99%). The 8 nm-ZnS successfully formed a p–n junction with the CIGS. However, as tZnS increased, the PCE rapidly decreased, mainly due to the JSC drop. The calculated series resistances (RS) of the solar cells dramatically increased with an increase in the thickness because the RS increased monotonically from 1.09 to 4.90 Ω cm2 with the thickness of 8 to 30 nm. The large RS hinders the electron transport through the cell.34 The RS was obtained by fitting I–V curves in a two-diode model.35 The statistical performance data with error bars are shown in Fig. 4.

The J–V curve and EQE spectrum of the best cell are plotted in Fig. 5b and c. The best PCE of 12.6% with VOC = 0.504 V, JSC = 37.40 mA cm−2, and FF = 66.80% was obtained using both the 8 nm-ZnS and the optimized ZnO/ITO window layer. The experimental detail for optimization of ZnO and ITO processes is described in the ESI.† The EQE spectrum exhibited a relatively high intensity in the short-wavelength region (300–500 nm), which yielded high JSC compared with that of the CdS-buffered solar cells.36,37
We measured the energy band-gap (Eg) of the 8 nm-thick ZnS film grown on the CIGS. The Eg of the thin ZnS film prepared on the CIGS was obtained by an extrapolation method from the reflection electron-energy-loss spectra (REELS), as shown in Fig. 6a. The incident primary electron beam energy (E0) is proportional to the penetration depth of the ZnS film, which means that the lower E0 yields the data from shallower depths. The Eg at the near-surface of the ZnS film (Eg = 3.40 eV) was slightly lower than that inside the film (Eg = 3.56 eV). Both the measured Egs are much higher than the typically used buffers.38 The high Eg of 3.40–3.56 eV in the ZnS film was allowed to avoid light absorption at high energy irradiation as shown in the EQE spectrum (Fig. 5c).
 Fig. 6  (a) Energy band-gaps obtained by REELS spectra at different incident energies. (b) SEM cross-section and top-view images of ZnS/CIGS and CIGS. (c) TEM cross-section image of ZnO/ZnS/CIGS. 
We observed SEM and TEM images to characterize the structural properties of the ultra-thin ZnS film, as shown in Fig. 6b and c. The CIGS film has a rough surface morphology because the grains were very large (∼1 μm), which forms deep grain boundaries. We, however, found that the thin ZnS film uniformly covered the CIGS surface. Fig. 6c illustrates the TEM image at the ZnO/ZnS/CIGS interfaces. The ZnS appeared to show an amorphous phase without a distinctive crystalline structure, although the ZnO and the CIGS exhibited a columnar structure and a polycrystalline structure, respectively.
The elemental diffusion of the buffer materials into the CIGS layer is an important issue. The excessive diffusion of Zn or sulfur is known to change the quality of the p–n junction and the device performances. In SIMS analysis of the ZnS buffer/CIGS sample, however, the secondary ion intensities of Zn and sulfur rapidly decreased as shown in Fig. S2.† The Zn intensity decreased to three orders of magnitude at a depth of 130 nm which was shorter than other reported values about 150 nm.20,39,40 On the other hand, the sulfur intensity also drastically decreased to two orders of magnitude at a depth of 50 nm. The sulfur diffusion into the CIGS layer and formation of the Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 phase seemed to be negligible. Therefore, the interface between the ZnS and the CIGS can be clearly defined.
Conclusions
In summary, we proposed a novel method to enhance the sulfur reaction using a thermal cracker cell that enables non-toxic and cost-competitive production of chalcogenide films with a low thermal budget of substrate heating. The high TC-zone reduced the substrate temperature, maintaining high quality of the sulfur-based chalcogenide thin film. As TC-zone increased, the ZnS phase became dominant with evident grain growth, implying that the thermal energy enhanced the reactivity of sulfur. An ultra-thin ZnS film (∼8 nm) prepared on the uneven CIGS surface showed conformal coverage with an amorphous phase exhibiting an Eg of 3.40–3.56 eV. The fabricated ZnS film prepared by the thermal cracker was applied to the CIGS thin-film solar cell as a buffer, and the PCE of 12.6% was obtained. This proposed method of sulfur reaction can contribute to the industry of optoelectronic devices, offering a low-cost and environmentally friendly manufacturing method.
