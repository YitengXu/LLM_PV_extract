    , Accepted 13th July 2012First published on 16th July 2012AbstractWireless nanobiodevices (such as nanorobots) have great potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and therapeutic system for human health, but their applications have been limited by difficulties in fabricating such nanobiodevices, and one of the difficulties is to obtain an in vivo energy source as their biopower component. To address this problem, we have developed a kind of 980 nm laser-driven photovoltaic cell (980LD-PVC) by introducing a NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphor layer in conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, and its performance has been optimized by improving the up-conversion luminescence intensity of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors and adopting a succinonitrile-based gel electrolyte. Under the direct irradiation of a 980 nm laser with an illumination area of 2 × 8 mm2 and a safe intensity of 720 mW cm−2 that is slightly lower than the conservative limit (726 mW cm−2) for human skin exposure, 980LD-PVC without a liquid component exhibits a maximum output power of 44.5 μW and an overall 980 nm laser-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 0.039%. In particular, after being covered with chicken skin (thickness: 1 mm) as a model of biological tissue, 980LD-PVC still possesses a maximum output power of 22.2 μW and an overall conversion efficiency of 0.019%, which is still excellent enough to satisfy the power requirements of in vivo nanorobots (at least 1 μW) and cardiac pacemakers (about 10 μW). This research paves the way for the development of novel electrical sources to power wireless nanobiodevices and many other biodevices implanted under the human skin.
1. Introduction
Many scientists have a dream that someday in the future, wireless nanobiodevices (such as nanorobots) can be used for in situ and real-time diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for specific targets, such as the treatment of cancers and the repair of tissue/organ defects.1–4 Currently, much of the research in this area remains highly theoretical,4 primarily because of the difficulties in fabricating such wireless nanobiodevices. One of the difficulties is to obtain an in vivo energy source as a biopower component in these self-powered nanobiodevices. In fact, for the efficient operation (such as monitoring, driving and communication) of these nanobiodevices, the most effective biopower component will be an electrical source that should be continuously available in the operational biological environment, such as inside the human body, for long periods.5,6 Therefore, it remains a primary objective to design and develop an in vivo electrical source with superior performances for fabricating self-powered wireless nanobiodevices.
Up to now, three kinds of electrical source have been chiefly developed as potential biopower components in in vivo nanobiodevices. The first kind is based on the conversion from mechanical energy to electrical energy. Prof. Wang's group has invented a series of nanogenerators which can be driven by various kinds of mechanical sources (such as ultrasonic waves,7,8 random mechanical actions,9 strain,10,11 and muscle-movement12,13) to produce electricity. These nanogenerators can be used to drive many kinds of nanobiodevices, but most output powers need to be further improved to meet the in vivo power requirements of biodevices, such as in vivo nanorobots (at least 1 μW (ref. 4)) and cardiac pacemakers (about 10 μW (ref. 14)). The second kind involves the conversion from chemical energy to electrical energy by biofuel cells, and various biofuel cells have been developed with great potential as in vivo electrical sources.15–20 It should be noted that the performances of biofuel cells will be limited by the types and concentrations of biological molecules in practical in vivo applications. The last kind of in vivo electrical source is based on the conversion from near-infrared (NIR) light energy to electrical energy by photovoltaic cells, since NIR light in the wavelength range from 700 to 1000 nm has a high penetration depth in biological tissue (for example, the typical penetration depth of 980 nm light can be several centimeters5,21). For the first time, in 2009 we have constructed a 980 nm laser driven photovoltaic cell (hereafter abbreviated as 980LD-PVC) by coating Na(Y1.5Na0.5)F6:Yb,Er nanorod films on a dye-sensitized TiO2 film in a conventional dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a liquid electrolyte, and the 980LD-PVC exhibits a maximum output power of 470 μW under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser with a power of 1 W.5 Very recently, all-solid-state 980LD-PVC based on a blend of P3HT and PCBM has also been developed by Prof. Chen’s group, and it has a maximum output power of 2.61 μW under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser with a power of 21.63 mW.22 Both 980LD-PVCs covered by biological tissues can still work well under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser, and their output powers are efficient enough to drive many kinds of biodevices. Therefore, 980LD-PVCs exhibit great superiority as in vivo biopower for biological applications.5,22
It should be noted that our 980LD-PVC based on DSSCs has a relatively high 980 nm laser-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (0.047%) compared with that (0.012%) of 980LD-PVC based on the blend of P3HT and PCBM.5,22 However, in our 980LD-PVC based on DSSCs, there are still chiefly three problems. The first problem is the relatively low up-conversion luminescence efficiency (∼0.45%) of the rare-earth nanophosphors,5 which were prepared by a two-step method: hydrothermal synthesis of hydrophobic Na(Y1.5Na0.5)F6:Yb,Er nanorod capped with oleic acid and the subsequent ligand (oleic acid) oxidation method according to our previous report.23 This two-step method is relatively complicated and the up-conversion luminescence capability of the nanorods has not been well optimized. The second problem should be the presence of some biologically non-compatible components (such as a liquid electrolyte which has caused some problems such as leakage and evaporation) in 980LD-PVCs.5 The last problem is the high power intensity (∼10 W cm−2) of the 980 nm laser which greatly exceeds the conservative limit (726 mW cm−2) of the 980 nm laser intensity set for human skin exposure.5,24 For better application of 980LD-PVCs as biopower in future nanobiodevices, it is still necessary to further optimize 980LD-PVCs based on DSSCs.
In the present work, we have improved greatly the up-conversion luminescence properties of hydrophilic rare-earth nanophosphors prepared via one-step hydrothermal synthesis, by tuning the solvent composition (the ratio of ethylene glycol (EG) to water) and prolonging the reaction time. Furthermore, for enhancing the biological compatibility, a stable gel electrolyte instead of a liquid electrolyte has been used to construct 980LD-PVCs. Under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser with a safe intensity of 720 mW cm−2, the present 980LD-PVC with an effective area of 0.16 cm2 exhibits a maximum output power of 44.5 μW. In particular, after being covered with one layer of chicken skin (thickness: ca. 1 mm) as a model of biological tissue, 980LD-PVC still has a maximum output power of 22.2 μW, which is efficient enough to power many kinds of in vivo devices, such as nanorobots and cardiac pacemakers under the skin.
2. Experimental
2.1 Hydrothermal synthesis of hydrophilic rare-earth nanophosphors
NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors were prepared by a hydrothermal route with a mixture of ethylene glycol (EG) and water as the solvent. In a typical synthesis, the solvent mixture (24 mL) was prepared by mixing EG and water with different volume ratios (from 0/24 to 24/0), and then the solvent mixture was divided in half. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP K30, 0.5 g) and LnCl3 (Ln = 78 mol% Y + 20 mol% Yb + 2 mol% Er, 1 mmol) was added to one half of the solvent mixture, and the solution was magnetically stirring until a homogeneous solution was formed. Subsequently, the other half of the solvent mixture (12 mL) containing NaF (7.2 mmol, 0.3023 g) was injected rapidly into the above solution. The resulting solution was agitated for about 10 min, then transferred to a 30 mL autoclave, sealed, and hydrothermally/solvothermally treated at 180 °C for 5–24 h. The system was cooled to room temperature naturally, and white precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm, and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times to remove impurities. Finally, the precipitates were dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h.
2.2 Construction of 980LD-PVCs
8 μm-thick TiO2 nanocrystalline films on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass were prepared and sensitized with cis-bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) (well known as N3 dye).25–27 An ethanol dispersion of 1 mg mL−1 NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods was cast on the N3 dye-sensitized TiO2 film, followed by heating at 40 °C in air for 30 min to remove the ethanol. This casting process was repeated until a 4 μm thick NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film was prepared. This TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er was used as the working electrode of the 980LD-PVCs. A thermostable succinonitrile-based gel electrolyte was prepared according to our previous report.28 In brief, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMI·BF4, 1 mL) was mixed with succinonitrile (3.0 g) to give a clear liquid (succinonitrile–BMI·BF4 system). Then a liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M I2 and 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium iodide in the liquid succinonitrile–BMI·BF4 system was prepared. A stable gel electrolyte was obtained by mixing fumed silica nanoparticles (7 wt%) with the above liquid electrolyte by stirring and subsequently sonicating. Subsequently, the gel electrolyte was spin-coated onto TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er, and kept in a vacuum oven for 2 h. The counter electrode was transparent conducting optical glass on which a 200 nm thick layer of Pt was deposited by sputtering. Finally, the cells were sealed with thermal adhesive films (Surlyn 1702, DuPont) for the measurements.
2.3 Characterization and photoelectrochemical measurements
The sizes and microstructures of the NaYF4:Yb,Er samples were determined by a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; JEM-2010F). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were made with a Bruker D4 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured using an IRPRESTIGE-21 spectrometer (Shimadzu) using KBr pressed pellets. The surface morphologies of the films were studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The average thickness of the film was determined by using a Talysurf CCI 3000 surface profiler. Up-conversion luminescence spectra were measured using a JASCO FP-6600 spectrometer, but the excitation source was an external 0 to 1 W adjustable 980 nm semiconductor laser device including an optic fiber accessory with a diameter of 800 μm (Beijing Hi-Tech Optoelectronic Co., China) instead of the xenon source in the spectrometer.
The photocurrent–voltage curves of the 980LD-PVC were measured by using a computerized Keithley Model 2400 SourceMeter unit. A 300 W xenon lamp (Thermo Oriel, USA) or an adjustable 980 nm semiconductor laser device with an output area of 2 × 8 mm2 was used as the light source. Fresh skin from a dead chicken was washed with water, fixed on a plastic support and then used as both a model of biological tissue and as a barrier layer in the 980 nm laser pathway (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optimization of up-conversion luminescence of hydrophilic NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors
Rare-earth up-converting nano-phosphors (RUNPs) have attracted increasing attention because of their wide applications in solar cells,29–33 flat-panel displays,34 optical-fiber-based telecommunications,35 biolabels,36–39etc. Most of these applications require hydrophilic RUNPs with high NIR-to-visible up-conversion luminescence efficiency. To obtain such RUNPs, some effective ways have been adopted, for example, by tuning the host material, crystal phase, size, structure, dopant and surface ligand.36–42 Until now, NaYF4 has been reported to be one of the most efficient host materials for RUNPs, and particularly hexagonal phase NaYF4 exhibits about an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the up-conversion luminescence efficiency relative to its cubic phase counterpart.36,43 However, the luminescence efficiencies of these NaYF4 nano-phosphors are still unsatisfied, as revealed in our previous studies.5,23 Therefore, it is still necessary to develop simple methods for the preparation of hydrophilic NaYF4 with a higher up-conversion luminescence efficiency. In the present work, hydrophilic NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal route with an ethylene glycol (EG)/water mixture as the solvent and PVP as the surfactant. The effects of the solvent composition and hydrothermal time on the crystal phase, the shape, and the up-conversion luminescence of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors were investigated.
At first, the effects of solvent composition were studied, and the NaYF4:Yb,Er samples were prepared in an EG/water solvent mixture (24 mL) with different water content (0–24 mL) via a hydrothermal/solvothermal process at 180 °C for 10 h. The phase of these NaYF4:Yb,Er samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1). The XRD pattern of the NaYF4:Yb,Er sample prepared in the absence of water can be indexed to the pure cubic (JCPDS file no. 77-2042) phase of NaYF4. When 4 mL water was added into the solvent mixture, the NaYF4:Yb,Er sample is related to a mixture of the cubic and hexagonal phases of NaYF4. With the further increase of the water volume from 4 to 24 mL, the relative intensity of the cubic phase NaYF4 goes down while that of the hexagonal phase NaYF4 goes up, indicating the enhancement of the relative amount of the hexagonal phase.37 Thus, the transformation from the cubic to hexagonal phase in these NaYF4:Yb,Er samples is evident with the addition of water, which should be attributed to the fact that a higher water content in the solvent mixture results in a faster “Ostwald ripening” process and favors the formation of hexagonal phase NaYF4.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of NaYF4:Yb,Er samples prepared in the EG/water mixture (24 mL) with different water content (0–24 mL) by a hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 10 h. For comparison, the standard patterns of cubic (JCPDS file no. 77-2042) and hexagonal (JCPDS file no. 16-0334) NaYF4 are also supplied. 
As a result of the presence of ethylene glycol and PVP ligands on their surface (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), the NaYF4:Yb,Er samples could be readily dispersed in water and in some polar organic solvents such as ethanol, DMF, or DMSO. Fig. 2 presents the up-conversion luminescence spectra of colloidal aqueous solutions containing 0.2 mg mL−1 NaYF4:Yb,Er samples prepared in the EG/water mixture (24 mL) with different water contents (0–24 mL). All these spectra are similar to those that have been reported previously for these materials,5,23 and they exhibit three distinct Er3+ emission bands. The dominant green emissions between 514 and 534 nm and between 534 and 560 nm are attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → to 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. A red emission is observed between 635 and 680 nm due to the transition from 4F9/2 to 4I15/2. More importantly, the water content (0–24 mL) has a strong effect on the luminescence intensity of the NaYF4:Yb,Er samples (Fig. 2). As shown in the inset of Fig. 2, the luminescence peak at 542 nm goes up dramatically with the increase of water volume from 0 to 12 mL, and then exhibits a fast decrease upon the further increase of the water volume from 12 to 24 mL. The initial increase of the luminescence efficiency should be attributed to the enhancement of the relative amount of hexagonal phase NaYF4, as revealed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1).37 The subsequent reduction of the luminescence efficiency can be attributed to the content decrease of EG as both solvent and ligands from 12 to 0 mL in the EG/water mixture. It is well known that the presence of a surface coating (such as a siloxane bound coating,44 a NaYF4 shell45) protects the luminescent ions that may be located at or near the surface of the nanophosphor from non-radiative decay caused by surface defects, as well as from vibrational deactivation from solvents such as water. Thus, it can be deduced that the decrease and/or the absence of EG ligands on the surface of the NaYF4:Yb,Er samples will result in an increase of the surface defects and therefore luminescence quenching.

The inset shows the relationship between the luminescence intensity at 542 nm and the water volume. 
Obviously, the NaYF4:Yb,Er sample prepared in the presence of 12 mL of water exhibits a high up-conversion luminescence intensity among these samples prepared in the EG/water mixture (24 mL) with different water contents at 180 °C for 10 h. To further improve the luminescence efficiency, the EG/water mixture (24 mL) containing 12 mL water was adopted as the reaction solvent, and the NaYF4:Yb,Er samples were fabricated at 180 °C for different hydrothermal times (5–24 h). As shown in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3), the NaYF4:Yb,Er sample prepared for 5 h exhibits a dominant cubic phase (JCPDS file no. 77-2042) accompanied by small amounts of the hexagonal phase (JCPDS file no. 16-0334). With the increase of the reaction time from 5 to 20 h, the relative intensity of cubic phase NaYF4 goes down while that of hexagonal phase NaYF4 goes up, indicating the enhancement of the relative amount of the hexagonal phase. Finally, the pure hexagonal phase NaYF4 is obtained as the reaction time reaches 24 h (Fig. 3). Subsequently, the morphologies of the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb,Er samples were studied by TEM and SEM images (Fig. 4). Obviously, the increase of the reaction time from 5 to 24 h results in the morphological transformation from nanoparticles with a size of about 100 nm to nanorods with a diameter of about 400 nm and a length of 0.8–2 μm (Fig. 4), which usually facilitates the reduction of surface defects and therefore improves the luminescence efficiency.37

Similarly, all these NaYF4:Yb,Er samples prepared for different reaction times could be readily dispersed in water due to the presence of ethylene glycol and PVP ligands on their surfaces. Fig. 5 shows the up-conversion luminescence spectra of colloidal aqueous solutions containing 0.2 mg mL−1 NaYF4:Yb,Er samples under 980 nm laser excitation. All these spectra exhibit three distinct Er3+ emission bands similar to those in the above spectra. Interestingly, both the green and red emission intensities go up rapidly with the increase of reaction time from 5 to 24 h, which may be attributed to the continuous transformation from the cubic to hexagonal phase of NaYF4:Yb,Er (Fig. 3) and the morphological transformation from small nanoparticles to larger nanorods (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 5  Up-conversion luminescence spectra of an ethanol dispersion containing 0.2 mg mL−1 NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals prepared in the EG/water solvent mixture (24 mL) with water volume (12 mL) by a hydrothermal process at 180 °C for different times (5–24 h), and the inset shows the photos of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals prepared for 24 h; (I) the solution showing its transparency; (II) total up-conversion under the excitation of a 980 nm laser; (III and IV) up-conversion viewed through red and green filters, respectively. 
It is clear that the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods prepared for 24 h exhibit the highest up-conversion luminescence intensity among all these samples (Fig. 5), which is almost 8 times as strong as that of the ones prepared for 5 h and almost 2 times as strong as that of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods prepared in our previous report (Fig. S3†).5 The total luminescence (the inset (II) of Fig. 5) of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods prepared for 24 h appears bright yellow-green in color due to a combination of red and green emissions from the Er3+ ions. This is confirmed by the inset (III) and (IV) of Fig. 5, where the solution under the same excitation conditions is viewed through red and green filters, respectively.
3.2. Characterization of dye-sensitized TiO2 film coated with NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors
To prepare the working electrode of 980LD-PVC, 8 μm-thick TiO2 nanocrystalline films on TCO glass were prepared according to the previous reports (Fig. 6a).25–27 Such a TiO2 film is composed of a three-dimensional network of interconnected particles with a grain size of about 30 nm (Fig. 6b), and then it was sensitized with N3 dye and became red-brown (Fig. 6e and f). Subsequently, an ethanol dispersion containing 1 mg mL−1 NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods (prepared in EG/water mixture (24 mL) containing 12 mL water at 180 °C for 24 h), which exhibits very strong up-conversion luminescence like a lamp under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser (Fig. 6c and d), was cast on the N3 dye-sensitized TiO2 film to obtain a 4 μm-thick NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film (Fig. 6h and i). This NaYF4:Yb,Er film composed of nanorods is porous, as revealed by the SEM image (Fig. 6g). Importantly, the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film also exhibits a very strong up-conversion luminescence, as shown in the photo (Fig. 6j), under the irradiation of a 980 nm semiconductor laser device with an illumination area of 2 × 8 mm2.

(a and b) The illustration and SEM image of TCO glass/TiO2 film. (c and d) The photos of an ethanol dispersion of 1 mg mL−1 NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods, showing its transparency and total up-conversion luminescence. (e and f) The illustration and photo of TCO glass/dye-sensitized TiO2 film. (g and h) The SEM image and illustration of TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film. (i and j) The photos of TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film, showing its morphology and total up-conversion luminescence. 
The up-conversion luminescence spectra of TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film were compared when collected along different directions, as shown in Fig. 7a. If the luminescence spectrum was collected directly and a 980 nm laser irradiates the NaYF4:Yb,Er layer at a 45° angle (inset A in Fig. 7a), the NaYF4:Yb,Er film exhibits strong up-conversion luminescence (line A in Fig. 7a) which is similar to that of the aqueous solution containing NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods. On the contrary, the luminescence of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod films collected through N3-sensitized TiO2 films is much weaker (inset B and line B in Fig. 7a). The intensity of the green-light emission is reduced by 93% and that of the red-light emission by 81%, which results from the strong photoabsorption of the up-conversion luminescence in the visible region by the N3 dyes in the composite film. It is evident that this strong photoabsorption favors electron injection from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 for the potential generation of direct-current electricity in the 980LD-PVCs.5
 Fig. 7  (a) Up-conversion luminescence spectra of TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film. The inset A indicates that a 980 nm laser irradiates the NaYF4:Yb,Er layer at a 45° angle and the luminescence spectrum (line A) was collected directly. The inset B indicates that the luminescence spectrum (line B) was collected through N3-sensitized TiO2 films. The inset C indicates that the luminescence spectrum (line C) was collected when there is skin as a barrier layer to the 980 nm laser with other identical conditions to inset A. (b and c) Photos of TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4::Yb,Er film on the skin with the support, when 980 nm laser turns off and on. 
It is well known that 980 nm light has a high penetration depth of several centimeters in biological tissue.5,21 Herein, to study the effect of the skin on the up-conversion luminescence of the film, chicken skin (thickness: about 1 mm) was selected as a model skin, and it was fixed on a plastic support (Fig. S1† and Fig. 7b and c). When the 980 nm laser penetrates through the skin and then irradiates the TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film, the NaYF4:Yb,Er film still exhibits strong up-conversion luminescence (Fig. 7c), which confirms the fact that the 980 nm laser that penetrates the skin still has a high light intensity to excite the NaYF4:Yb,Er film. Furthermore, when the composite film was covered by the skin, the up-conversion luminescence spectrum was recorded under the irradiation of the 980 nm laser (inset C and line C in Fig. 7a). Obviously, the up-conversion luminescence intensity goes down in the presence of skin as a barrier layer, and it retains about 52% of its initial value (line C in Fig. 7). Thus, one can expect that the up-conversion visible luminescence under the skin can be used as a light source to irradiate traditional dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells to produce electricity.
3.3 Fabrication and performances of 980LD-PVC
The present TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film was used as the photoanode of 980LD-PVCs. If a liquid electrolyte, which was the same as that used by us previously (3-methoxypropionitrile containing 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M I2, and 0.5 M N-methylbenzimidazole),5 was used to construct 980LD-PVCs, the resulting 980LD-PVC exhibits an overall 980 nm laser-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of about 0.090% (Fig. S4†), under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser with a constant power of 1 W.5 This efficiency is almost 2 times that (0.047%) of the previous 980LD-PVC based on NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods prepared via a two-step process (hydrothermal-oxidization process),5 confirming the fact that the present NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods prepared via a one-step hydrothermal process are indeed better than those prepared via the two-step process.
Unfortunately, the presence of organic liquid electrolytes in 980LD-PVC and DSSCs causes some problems, such as leakage and the evaporation of solvent, therefore resulting in practical limitations to sealing and long-term operation.5,27,28,46–48 Replacing the organic liquid electrolytes by quasi-solid-state electrolytes or solid state electrolytes seems to be a solution to these problems.27,28,47,48 In the present work, a succinonitrile-based gel electrolyte was prepared according to our previous report,28 and it is highly thermostable and still remains in the gel state at high temperature (80 °C) (Fig. 8a). Subsequently, the gel electrolyte was spin-coated onto TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er to construct 980LD-PVCs. The 980LD-PVC has a structure and working principle similar to those of typical dye-sensitized solar cells except for the presence of a NaYF4:Yb,Er layer acting as the light source for dyes (Fig. 8b).28

Since the succinonitrile-based gel electrolyte has very poor fluidity (as shown in Fig. 8a) compared with traditional liquid electrolytes, the presence of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film may deteriorate the interfacial contact between the gel electrolyte and the N3-sensitized TiO2 film although the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film is porous (Fig. 6g). To investigate the effect of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film on 980LD-PVCs, photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the PVC were measured under standard AM 1.5 solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 9). The PVC with an effective area of 0.16 cm2 has an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.604 V, Isc of 1.61 mA, a fill factor (FF) of 0.541, with an overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (defined by η = Voc × Isc × FF/Pexc) of 3.29% (Fig. 9). Its efficiency is relatively low compared with that (∼5.0%) of the previous DSSC with the gel electrolyte,28 confirming the mildly adverse effects of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod film.

I–V characteristics of the PVC containing gel electrolyte and the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod layer under the irradiation of simulated solar light (AM 1.5) at 100 mW cm−2. Effective area: 2 × 8 mm2. 
When 980LD-PVC was directly irradiated by a 980 nm laser with an illumination area of 2 × 8 mm2 and a power intensity of 720 mW cm−2 that is slightly lower than the conservative limit (726 mW cm−2) for human skin exposure (Fig. 10a),5,24 980LD-PVC exhibits a Voc of 0.60 V, an Isc of 0.14 mA, FF of 0.53, and a maximal output power (Pout) of 44.5 μW, yielding an overall 980 nm laser-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 0.039% (black line in Fig. 10c). This conversion efficiency (0.039%) is higher than that (0.012%) of the all solid-state 980LD-PVC based on a blend of P3HT and PCBM.5,22 It is also equivalent to 83% of the reported value (0.047%) of the previous 980LD-PVC,5 although the present NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorods exhibit as high as 2 times the up-conversion luminescence intensity of the previous nanorods. This should be attributed to the fact that the present 980LD-PVC with a gel electrolyte has a relatively low photoelectric conversion efficiency (3.29%, as shown in Fig. 9), which is only equivalent to about 1/3 of the efficiencies (∼10%) of traditional DSSCs with liquid electrolytes. However, more importantly, the present 980LD-PVC has no liquid component and its Poutput is still high enough to drive many kinds of devices. Furthermore, its conversion efficiency remains almost invariant when the present 980LD-PVC is continuously irradiated by a 980 nm laser for 60 min (Fig. S5a†) and/or stored at 60 °C for 120 h (Fig. S5b†),28 indicating the excellent stability.
 Fig. 10  (a and b) Photos showing the photoelectric measurements of 980LD-PVC covered without and with chicken skin under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser. (c) Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of 980LD-PVC covered without and with chicken skin under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser with an intensity of 720 mW cm−2 (illumination area: 2 × 8 mm2, power: 115.2 mW). 
Finally, when chicken skin as the model skin was coated on 980LD-PVC (Fig. 10b), its Voc shows little change, at 0.595 V (red line in Fig. 10c), while its Isc, Pout and η are respectively 0.072 mA, 22.2 μW and 0.019%, which are reduced by ∼50% compared with those obtained in the absence of a skin coating (black line in Fig. 10c). This output power (22.2 μW) is still excellent enough to satisfy the power requirements of many biological devices, such as in vivo nanorobots (at least 1 μW (ref. 4)) and cardiac pacemakers (about 10 μW (ref. 14)). Furthermore, it has been revealed that the power used to operate a device fabricated with one nanowire or nanotube is ∼10 nW,5 thus the present 980LD-PVC under the skin could operate ∼103 of such nanodevices. We also believe that the performance of the present 980LD-PVC can be further improved by device optimization, such as optimization of the up-conversion luminescence efficiency of the rare earth nanophosphors. In addition, although there are still some biologically non-compatible components (such as the glass electrode) in the present 980LD-PVCs, they can be potentially replaced by other biocompatible components (such as a flexible plastic electrode). Therefore, this 980LD-PVC without liquid components has great superiority as a novel energy system for cardiac pacemakers, biological nanorobots and other nanobiodevices under the human skin.
4. Conclusions
In summary, hydrophilic NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors have been prepared by a one-step hydrothermal route with an EG/water mixture as the solvent and PVP as the surfactant. The solvent composition and reaction time have strong effects on the crystal phase, the shape, and the up-conversion luminescence of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanophosphors. The hexagonal phase NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod sample, which was prepared in the EG/water solvent with 12 mL water by a hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 24 h, has the highest up-conversion luminescence intensity. A NaYF4:Yb,Er nanorod layer on N3-sensitized TiO2 film exhibits strong up-conversion luminescence, even when covered by chicken skin as the model biological tissue, due to the rather high transparency of the tissue to 980 nm light. By using TCO glass/N3-sensitized TiO2 film/NaYF4:Yb,Er film and a succinonitrile-based gel electrolyte, 980LD-PVC without a liquid component has been successfully constructed. It exhibits a maximal output power of 44.5 μW and an overall 980 nm laser-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 0.039%, under the direct irradiation of a 980 nm laser with an illumination area of 2 × 8 mm2 and a safe intensity of 720 mW cm−2. Importantly, when the chicken skin is coated on 980LD-PVC, 980LD-PVC still has a maximal output power of 22.2 μW and an overall conversion efficiency of 0.019%, which is still excellent enough to satisfy the power requirements of in vivo nanorobots and cardiac pacemakers. This 980LD-PVC without liquid component has great potential to revolutionize the energy system of biodevices implanted under the human skin.
