    , Accepted 3rd March 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractThe introduction of alkoxy chains in the molecular architecture of meso push–pull porphyrins is of paramount importance aiming at high performing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on these specific sensitizers. Recently, we have demonstrated that the same approach is fruitful even if it is applied to tetraarylporphyrins with an acceptor/anchoring substituent in the β-pyrrolic position. In particular, among the ortho–ortho, the ortho–para and the ortho-functionalization of the aryl rings with an octyloxy chain, we identified the latter as the most performing in the series, showing a good balance between the dye loading and the reduction of π–π aggregation. Herein, focusing our attention on the mono-ortho-functionalized molecular structure, we have investigated the effect of the alkoxy chain length and nature on the reduction of dye-to-dye aggregation as well as on the enhancement of light harvesting capabilities, finding an almost linear relationship between the device photon conversion efficiency (PCE) and the alkoxy chain length both in the presence and in the absence of a co-disaggregating agent.
Introduction
Nanocrystalline semiconductor-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention in the past two decades as low-cost alternatives to conventional solid-state photovoltaic devices.1,2 In DSSCs, the sensitizer is one of the key components, exerting a significant influence on the device power conversion and stability. With ruthenium complexes high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 8–12% have been achieved.3–6
However, the choice of the sensitizer heavily influences not only the device efficiency but also most of the environmental impacts and costs related to the technology production.7 Therefore, with peculiar reference to the sensitizer, while it is admissible that basic research on DSSCs should strive towards the achievement of higher and higher efficiencies, part of these efforts should also be directed towards the minimization of the environmental impact associated with the DSSC production. High cost of ruthenium and its relatively low molar absorption coefficients pose difficulties for a straightforward scalability of the technology, hence the increase in interest in research on a large variety of alternative organic dyes.2,8
Porphyrins represent a promising class of organic sensitizers as a result of their large absorption coefficients in the visible region of sunlight. In addition to this, the possibility of fine tuning their spectral properties and energy levels by chemical functionalization allowed the design of innovative porphyrinic dyes specifically tailored for DSSCs.8,9
In particular, porphyrinic dyes embodying an ethyne-linked donor group and an ethynyl–carboxyphenyl acceptor/anchoring group at the opposite meso positions present a strong charge-transfer from the push- to the pull-moiety through the ZnII-diarylporphyrinate ring acting as a π bridge.10 Such a strong charge-transfer has been demonstrated to provide considerable high values of PCE in DSSCs.11
Nevertheless, these porphyrinic systems are generally characterized by a strong tendency to form π–π stacking aggregates,8 which significantly reduces the electron injection efficiency in the TiO2 electrode limiting the photovoltaic performances of the device.2,8,9 Moreover, the ZnII ion coordinated inside of the porphyrinic core can interact with the I3− species of the electrolyte promoting a faster recombination reaction with the injected electron and leading to a detrimental effect on the PCE.12,13 Since the presence of bulky t-butyl groups on the aryl rings of meso push–pull ZnII diarylporphyrinates is not enough to overcome these inconveniences, several authors have shown that the introduction of long alkoxy chains at the ortho-positions of the two opposite phenyl rings can fit these problems in this kind of molecular architecture by an enveloping effect on the porphyrinic ring, thus reducing π–π aggregation and hindering a facile interaction between the ZnII centre and I3−.11,14,15
This approach on a meso push–pull porphyrin with an ethyne-linked donor group gave as a result an appreciable PCE enhancement reaching a value over 10%, with dodecoxyl chains (–OC12H25).11
The same strategy applied to meso-disubstituted push–pull ZnII diarylporphyrinates with an amino-linked donor group led to exceed, for the first time, the efficiencies of ruthenium dyes in combination with a second organic co-sensitizer and a Co-based redox electrolyte.16
Nowadays by using well-engineered donor and acceptor groups the latter kind of porphyrins show enhanced performances in DSSCs with efficiencies of over 13% in the absence of a second co-sensitizer, but still working coupled with a Co-based electrolyte.17,18
However, long multistep syntheses are required to obtain such a kind of meso-disubstituted push–pull ZnII diarylporphyrinate resulting in very low overall yields.10,11,15–21 On the other hand, tetraarylporphyrins present a straightforward synthesis, which can be scaled up to multi-gram quantities,22 moreover they can be quite easily functionalized in the β-pyrrolic position reaching light-conversion efficiencies of up to 7.1%.23
Some of us recently developed a synthetic strategy to introduce a cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor/anchoring group, with an ethynyl–phenyl spacer in the β-pyrrolic position by relatively few synthetic steps, obtaining still a push–pull system, although with a less pronounced charge-transfer character. These tetraarylporphyrinic dyes have been shown to provide fairly better light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies if compared to those of some correlated meso-disubstituted push–pull ZnII diarylporphyrinates under the same DSSC fabrication conditions.24
Starting from these remarks, we have attempted to investigate the most relevant photochemical properties of tetraarylporphyrinate dyes wrapped with several different alkoxy chains. We have been focused indeed on the synthesis of three different β-substituted ZnII-tetraarylporphyrinate dyes, bearing octyloxy chains (–OC8H17) at the ortho, ortho-, ortho, para- or ortho-positions of the four phenyl groups, respectively. Our previously reported experimental evidence indicates that the position of the alkoxy group strongly influences the optoelectronic features of the compounds, but a conspicuous improvement in the overall PCE of the DSSC was detected when the octyloxy chain was placed in the ortho-position of each aryl ring. The presence of relatively extended alkoxy chains allowed in fact preventing π–π aggregation phenomena and hence reducing self-quenching of the dye excited states. However it may also induce the formation of a lipophilic sphere around the porphyrinic core making dye-loading more difficult.25
Herein the impact of the length and complexity of alkoxy chains has been systematically screened by a homogeneous series of sensitizers possessing both differently long chains and branched or cyclic chains, Chart 1, focussing our investigation on the reduction of dye-to-dye aggregation as well as on the enhancement of light harvesting prerogatives of the photoelectrode (PE).
 Chart 1  Chemical structure of the dyes investigated. 
In particular, compounds 1–4 are featured by a linear chain with different lengths from a C4 to a C12 alkyl group; compound 3 is the dye investigated in our previous paper25 and now taken as a reference. For the sake of a more deep investigation of the chain effect, in compound 5 a branched chain has been introduced, whereas in compound 6 a cyclic substituent characterized by a quite rigid structure.
Experimental
General
All reagents and solvents used in the synthesis were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received, except Et3N (freshly distilled over KOH) and THF (freshly distilled from Na/benzophenone). Silica gel for gravimetric chromatography (Geduran Si 60, 63–200 μm) and for flash chromatography (Geduran Si 60, 40–63 μm) was purchased from Merck. Glassware has been flame-dried under vacuum before use when necessary.
Microwave assisted reactions were performed using a Milestone MicroSYNTH instrument.
Details of the syntheses of compounds 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are reported in the ESI,† whereas compounds 325 and 724 (see below) were synthesized as previuosly reported in the literature.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 with CDCl3 or THF-d8 as the solvent (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.).
Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer CHN 2400 instrument in the Analytical Laboratories of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Milan.
Mass spectra were collected using a VG Autospec M246 magnetic mass spectrometer with a LSIMS ionic source (FAB) or with a Bruker-Daltonics ICR-FTMS APEX II with an electrospray ionization source (ESI).
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-530 spectrometer.
Photoluminescence experiments were carried out at room temperature, in THF solution after N2 bubbling for 60 s.
Photoluminescence quantum yields were measured using a C11347 Quantaurus – QY Absolute Photoluminescence Quantum Yield Spectrometer (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K), equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp, an integrating sphere and a multi-channel detector.
Steady state emission and excitation spectra and photoluminescence lifetimes were obtained using a FLS 980 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburg Instrument Ltd). Continuous excitation for the steady state measurements was provided by a 450 W Xenon arc lamp. Photoluminescence lifetime measurements were performed using an Edinburgh Picosecond Pulsed Diode Laser EPL-445 (Edinburg Instrument Ltd), with a central wavelength of 442.2 nm and a repetition rate of 20 MHz, by the time-correlated single-photon counting method.
Electrochemical measurements
The voltammetric studies have been performed in a 4 cm3 cell, in 5 × 10−4–10−3 M solutions in dimethylformamide (Aldrich, 99.8%) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, Fluka) as the supporting electrolyte. The solutions were de-aerated by N2 bubbling. The ohmic drop has been compensated by the positive feedback technique.26
The experiments were carried out using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT potentiostat (EcoChemie, The Netherlands) run by a PC using GPES software. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) investigations were carried out at scan rates typically ranging from 0.05 to 2 V s−1, with ohmic drop compensation.
The working electrode was a glassy carbon one (AMEL, diameter = 1.5 mm) cleaned by synthetic diamond powder (Aldrich, diameter = 1 μm) on a wet cloth (STRUERS DP-NAP); the counter electrode was a platinum disk or wire. The operating reference electrode was an aqueous saturated calomel electrode, but the potentials were ultimately referred to as the Fc+/Fc (ferrocenium/ferrocene) couple (the intersolvental redox potential reference currently recommended by IUPAC27,28 by both external and internal standardization). To prevent water and chloride leakage into the working solution a compartment filled with the operating medium and ending with a porous frit was interposed between the reference electrode and the cell.
Dye solar cell fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (15 Ω sq−1, purchased from XIN YAN TECHNOLOGY LTD) was cleaned in a detergent solution for 15 min and in ethanol for 30 min using an ultrasonic bath. Mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were prepared by doctor blading by using two different commercial pastes, namely Dyesol 18NR-T, which gave transparent nanostructured TiO2 films, and Dyesol 18NR-AO, which was used as an active opaque overlayer. All the samples were dried at 125 °C for 5 min, after each layer deposition, and then sintered at 450 °C for 40 min. They were then treated with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and then rinsed again with water and ethanol. All the samples were sintered at 500 °C. The thickness and the active area (0.16 cm2) of the films were measured using a DEKTAK 150™ profilometer. After cooling to 80 °C the mesoporous films were immersed into the dye solution for 8 h. Pt counter electrodes were realized by depositing an H2PtCl6-containing paste (Dyesol PT1) and sintering them at 430 °C for 30 min. A 1.1 mm hole had been previously made on the FTO-coated substrate through a diamond drill. Two electrodes were then assembled together in a sandwich configuration and sealed upon heating a thermoplastic gasket made of a hot-melt ionomer-class resin (Surlyn 50 μm thickness). A solution containing 0.6 M of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M of lithium iodide, 0.05 M of I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was used as an electrolyte and introduced into the cell by vacuum backfilling.
Optical and electrical characterization of devices
Photocurrent–voltage I–V measurements were performed using a Keithley unit (Model 2400 Source Meter), while a Newport Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator (Model 94063A equipped with a 1000 W xenon arc lamp) served as a light source. The light intensity (or radiant power) was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using as reference a Silicon standard solar cell. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using a computerized setup consisting of a xenon arc lamp (140 W, Newport, 67005) coupled to a monochromator (Cornerstore 260 Oriel 74125). Light intensity was measured using a calibrated UV silicon photodetector (Oriel 71675) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured by using an optical power/energy meter, dual channel (Newport 2936-C).
Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were carried out using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) apparatus, namely a Edinburgh FLS980 spectrometer using a laser diode as an excitation source (1 MHz, λexc = 405, 515, or 635 nm, 20–100 ps time resolution after deconvolution) and a MCP as a detector.29
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Dyes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 have been prepared following the same synthetic route reported for dye 325 (see Scheme 1) and the details of the synthetic steps are fully described in the ESI.†
 Scheme 1  Synthetic pathway of the investigated dyes. 
The porphyrinic cores were obtained under the same Lindsey's mild conditions with CF3COOH as a catalyst.22 Interestingly, we observed an increase of yield with the increase in the solubilizing capability of the alkyl group employed. In fact we obtained a 30% yield for the porphyrinic core of 1, a 35% yield for 2 and a 40% yield for 4, taking into account that we had registered a 37% yield for 3.25 As a confirmation of this trend the porphyrinic core of 5 was obtained with a yield of over 50% as a result of a good solubilizing capability of the 2-ethylhexyl group, whereas the cyclohexyl alkoxy group led to the lower reaction yield (about 10%).
It must be noticed that the porphyrin cores of 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are actually obtained as an atropisomeric mixture, due to the random arrangement of the mono-ortho-substituted phenyl groups, which are perpendicular to the porphyrinic ring and therefore the alkoxy chains can be above or below the plane of the macrocycle. As already observed for 3,25 the single isomers are difficult to separate and identify and, because of the rotation of the phenyl group upon heating, they tend to be converted again in the atropisomeric mixture both as free porphyrins and as ZnII porphyrinates. Thus we profitably proceeded to work directly on the atropisomeric mixture as in the case of 3.
The reaction conditions for the mono-bromination in the β-pyrrolic position of the porphyrinic ring were carefully optimized in order to obtain the mono-bromo derivative as the principal product, thus to proceed in the following steps without any purification.
The ethynylbenzaldehyde moiety was introduced into the brominated ZnII porphyrinates by microwave-enhanced Sonogashira coupling,24,30 obtaining the expected intermediate products (37–54% yield) and the final dyes were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid (69%-quantitative yield), Scheme 1.
Investigation of absorption and emission properties
All the new dyes were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy in THF solution and, as expected, they showed the typical pattern of the absorption B and Q bands of ZnII-porphyrinate systems. The normalized spectra are reported in Fig. 1 and compared to the spectrum of dye 3 in the same solvent, while the relative data are collected in Table 1.

All the spectra are very similar also in terms of molar absorption, and in particular we can observe just small differences for the spectrum of 2, which appears sharper, with a smaller Q-band intensity and the typical shoulder at about 460 nm, due to the presence of the strong cyanoacrylic acceptor group, seems to be hardly marked.31
Beside the absorption spectroscopy features, we also investigated the emission properties of these dyes in order to shed light on the effect of alkoxy chains on the aggregation dynamics in solution.
Normalized emission spectra recorded for each dye at 10−6 M concentration in THF are reported in Fig. 2 and the relative data are summarized in Table 1.
 Fig. 2  Fluorescence emission spectra of dyes 1–6 in de-aerated THF solution, λexc, as reported in Table 1. 
All dyes present a double band emission at room temperature, in particular we can observe that for dyes 3, 4 and 6 the band at higher energy is less intense, and this feature is used in terms of self-absorption due to high concentration, but here we are investigating dilute solutions on a μM scale. Thus we registered for compound 1 the emission spectra at different concentrations finding a decrease of the band at 618 nm only for really higher concentrations (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
The excitation wavelengths were chosen for each dye after registration of their excitation spectra (see Fig. S2–S7, ESI†), which do not display any difference with the relative UV-vis spectra, indicating that both B and Q bands contribute to populating the lower excited state.
The lifetime was measured in solution by the single photon counting technique using a pulse laser source at about 450 nm (see Experimental) and a τ value in the range of 2.00–2.42 ns for each dye was registered (see Table 1). The observed small differences are reflected on the values of absolute quantum yield (QY) obtained for the same diluted solution in THF of each dye. The latter feature can confirm the similarity of the compounds in solution, thus we thought to measure the variations of the QY value increasing the concentration of each dye in solution, in order to assess the aggregation of the dyes by the quenching of the fluorescence.
In Fig. 3 the plot of QY values at different concentrations for each dye is reported. As expected upon increasing the concentration, the QY value decreases. Since the QY values are very similar at low concentration for each dye, it is possible to observe that the decrease of fluorescence is less marked for the dye with linear alkoxy chains, with respect to dye 6 featured by cyclohexyloxy moieties, which are shorter and quite rigid. To confirm if this behaviour can be attributed to the presence of a bulky group, we measured the QY values of an analogous dye with t-butyl groups at the meta positions of the phenyl rings (7), previously investigated by us and used as a reference (see Chart 2).24,25 For the latter dye we observed a similar trend compared to 6, thus these results may confirm that in solution linear alkoxy chains prevent aggregation phenomena better than rigid bulky groups.
 Fig. 3  Variation of the QY (%) value as a function of the dye concentration in solution. 
 Chart 2  Chemical structure of compound 7. 
However, due to the low values of QY (and thus to the intrinsic error in the measurement) a clear trend between dyes 1 and 5 is not observable to discriminate the effect produced by the different chain length in solution, this effect may be better estimated in the film state, where the dyes are anchored onto the TiO2 surface and the enveloping and shielding effect of the chains around the porphyrins can be easier highlighted.
Electrochemical investigation
The electronic properties of the dyes 1, 2 and 4–6 have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and compared to the values of 3 previously determined under the same experimental conditions.25 CV patterns obtained at 0.2 V s−1 on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode in DMF + 0.1 M TBAP (tetrabutylammonium perchlorate) are reported in the ESI† (Fig. S8–S12), and their key features are summarized in Table 2.

In all cases more than one oxidation and reduction peak is observed in the potential window investigated, the first of which is reversible or quasi-reversible from both the electrochemical and chemical point of view, affording the calculation of formal potentials of first oxidation (anodic)  and first reduction (cathodic)  processes in the operating solvent (formal potentials E0′ and approximate standard potentials E0 under the assumption of neglecting activity coefficients). The experimental E0′ values also allow the evaluation of the electrochemical HOMO and LUMO energy levels32 and the HOMO–LUMO energy gap Eg (Table 2), employing the ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple as a reference for intersolvental comparison of electrode potentials.27,28
As shown in the table above, the electrochemical data are quite similar, however small but a significant difference of 0.02 eV was detected in the Eg values between dye 1 featured by the shorter linear chain, and dyes 2–4 having the longer chains.
The same difference of about 0.02 eV is observed between dyes 2–4 and dyes 5 and 6, which are featured by substituents with a bulkier nature compared to the simply linear chains.
This trend may be explained in terms of the different environments created by the type of chain, but since the electrochemical differences are small, we can conclude that all the dyes have nearly the same capacity of electron transfer on the electrodic surface.
Finally, dyes 1–6 present the electrochemical parameters such as an electrochemical LUMO level at higher energy than that of the TiO2 conduction band and an electrochemical HOMO level at lower energy than that of the I−/I3− redox couple, so that they may act as dyes in DSSCs (see Fig. S13, ESI†).
Photoelectrochemical investigation
We firstly examined the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, Chart 3) and scrutinized several dye up-taking conditions in order to maximize the light-to-electricity conversion prerogatives of the here investigated compounds. The case of dye 4 is reported below: four different dye solutions, containing, respectively, 0 M, 0.2 mM, 0.4 mM and 1 M of CDCA, have been tested on 8 μm thick TiO2 electrodes (see Table 3). The absorbance spectra of these photoanodes and the J–V curves of the resulting DSSCs are reported in Fig. 4.

As observable, despite a not negligible worsening of the light absorption features, PEs prepared with dye solutions containing a higher amount of CDCA (the molar ratio CDCA/dye was increased to 5) exhibit an improvement of the photovoltaic (PV) performances. This is due to a systematic reduction of the intermolecular recombination phenomena33,34 as further attested here by the Time Correlated Single Photon counting (TCSPC) analysis reported in Fig. 4c (see also Fig. S14, ESI†). Measuring the time evolution of the PhotoLuminescence (PL) signal is in fact a powerful tool to investigate detrimental deactivation channels associated with dye-to-dye self-quenching.35 To this aim the photophysical behaviour of dye molecules anchored onto a mesoporous film where charge injection is forbidden is monitored. Herein Al2O3 was chosen as an inert substrate to isolate the sensitizer excited state quenching in the absence of the charge injection, thus relating the behaviour to the dye structure. A batch of high quality mesoporous Al2O3 films was thus prepared in such a way to present an overall surface area comparable with the one provided by TiO2 electrodes. The longest decay time of the excited state is observed for the dye solution containing 1 mM of CDCA confirming the beneficial effect of the co-absorbant agent in preventing dye self-quenching.
Thus we opted to hold the same CDCA molar concentration also in the preparation of other batches of dye-sensitized electrodes. So, in all the below reported data dye-sensitized electrodes have been prepared by immersing TiO2 mesoporous in 2 × 10−4 M dye solution containing 1 × 10−3 M of CDCA films for 8 hours. Absorption spectra of the here referred films 1–6 are reported in Fig. 5.

Dyes 2, 3 and 4 revealed slightly better light harvesting prerogatives both in the B- and Q-bands, thus attesting the relatively low impact of aggregation phenomena in long-chain-functionalized compounds.
PV performances were then maximized by employing 16 μm-thick-TiO2 electrodes (12 μm 18NRT + 4 μm opaque layer). J–V curves of six batches of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6a (under 1 Sun illumination and an AM 1.5 filter) and the resulting PV data are listed in Table 4. The addition of CDCA led to a consistent improvement of the PCE values, but the same trend among the performances of the six alkoxyl chains was detected for the cases dye up-taking in the absence of CDCA (see data reported in Table S2, ESI†). The corresponding IPCE spectra are plotted in Fig. 6b.

It is possible to appreciate how the PCE arises linearly with the alkoxy chain length changing from C4 to C12: dye 4 reveals in fact the highest PCE value. Both photocurrent density and photovoltage show a remarkable increment passing from dye 1 (12 mA cm−2, 645 mV) to dye 4 (13.2 mA cm−2, 705 mV), following an overall incremental trend with respect to the chain length.
These data seem to confirm the above claimed fundamental finding: longer alkoxy linear chains provide a better enveloping effect which reflects on the DSSC performances. The increase of photocurrent density derives from a more efficient electron injection from the excited state of the dye to the TiO2,11 as also attested from the IPCE spectra provided in Fig. 6b. In addition, VOC values are detrimentally affected, as well known, by charge recombination between the conduction band electrons of the semiconductor and I3− species of the electrolyte. The presence of long chains thus induces a positive shielding of the TiO2 surface and allows reducing the undesired back electron transfer rate.36 So, although the here investigated five molecules exhibit almost identical absorption features in solution as well as comparable light harvesting capabilities, once they get chemically anchored on the TiO2 surface their charge injection prerogatives are strongly influenced by the molecular architecture of the alkoxy substituent. The same trend was also confirmed by TCSPC analysis. Direct comparison of PL time-resolve features of dye-sensitized Al2O3 films obtained from CDCA-free solutions (see Fig. 6c and also Fig. S15, ESI†) allows us to state that the longer alkyl chain may increase the charge injection properties, in fact the dye excited state deactivation followed this hierarchy: 4, 2, 5, 6 nicely reflecting the increment of the length of the alkyl chain. This can be reasonably associated with a reduction of the self-quenching phenomena driven by the protective effect of the long alkoxy chain. Along with this, the length of the alkoxy chain also induces a considerable screening effect which leads to diminishing back electron transfer rate from TiO2 to the electrolyte and contributes to the increase in the cell's photovoltage (see Table 4), as already claimed by other authors.21
Conclusions
We synthesized five new ZnII-tetraarylporphyrinate dyes (1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) featured by different alkoxy chains at the ortho-positions of the four phenyl groups and by an acceptor cyanoacrylic group linked at the β-pyrrolic position through an ethynylphenyl bridge, and tested them as dye-sensitizers in TiO2-mesostructured photoelectrochemical solar cells.
We investigated the effect of the alkoxy chains on the photochemical and electrochemical properties of these molecules in solution. We found that when the QY value decreases due to the molar concentration increase, a generalized lower slope was even detected in the case of dyes embodying longer linear alkoxy chains, thus suggesting a significant reduction of the undesired aggregation effects.
Photovoltaic characterization in DSSCs attested that longer alkoxy chains provide better performances: the highest PCE was detected in the case of dye 4, which embodies a C12-based chain, either with or without the presence of CDCA as a co-disaggregating agent. The concomitant increment of the open circuit photovoltage also indicates that chain elongation produces an additional positive shielding effect limiting detrimental charge-recombination phenomena at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. TCSPC measurements carried out on an inert Al2O3 film also supported this finding and demonstrated that the length of the alkoxy substituents seriously impacts the intermolecular charge-transfer mechanisms due to dye-to-dye interaction.
