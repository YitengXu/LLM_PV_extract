    , Accepted 25th January 2013First published on 8th February 2013AbstractFive metal-free organic dyes (DIA1–DIA5) based on rigid triarylamine donors have been synthesized and their photophysical/electrochemical properties, theoretical calculations and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performances have been investigated. All the five dyes showed a high molar extinction coefficient (5.0 × 104–8.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1). Electrochemical measurement data indicates that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be conveniently tuned by alternating the π-spacer moiety. Among the five dyes, DIA3 showed the best photovoltaic performance, which was greatly increased to 8.09% by an optimized condition under standard global AM 1.5 solar light condition. The results show that the dyes based on this rigid donor are promising candidates for the improvement of the performance of DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a promising candidate for a new renewable energy source, have attracted considerable scientific attention due to their low cost and high performance.1–5 It has been observed that the dye sensitizer plays a decisive role in the device performance. Ru complexes dyes have many advantages and have achieved maximal power conversion efficiencies over 11%,2,6–8 however, they have the noble metal with high cost and difficult preparation and purification process.9 Recently, much effort has been focused on the pure organic sensitizers due to facile molecular design, easy synthesis process, low cost, and no concern with the noble metal resource.10,11 A wide variety of organic dyes have been reported in the literature including coumarin,12–15 hemicyanine,16 merocyanine,17 triphenyl amine,18–21 indoline,22 phenothiazine,23–25 and fluorenyl amine dyes.26–28
Most sensitizers are composed of a D–π–A dipolar structure which is favourable for effective charge separation.29 In our previous works, we have developed a series of dyes by semi-rigid triarylamine-based donors.30 Of these new triarylamine-based donors, the two phenyl rings were locked by alkyl and ethylene chains to decrease the rotation to some extent, thus significantly decreasing the energy loss caused by rotation of the phenyl rings, as a result, obviously enhanced efficiencies were obtained for DSSCs based on these dyes employing the semi-rigid triarylamine donors. Recently, Prof. Ko and coworkers reported a new class of organic sensitizers based on a planar triphenylamine electron donor where all of the three phenyl rings were bridged by a methine unit and the DSSCs based on these dyes achieved power conversion efficiencies close to 9.0%.31 In this work, we report a novel class of organic sensitizers based on a rigid amine electron donor with a two-locking structure. Specifically, the dyes with this new rigid triarylamine donor have the following characteristics: (i) two of the three phenyl rings are incorporated with each other, constructing a carbazole unit, thus increasing the effective conjugation; (ii) by unlocking two of the three phenyl rings, some vibration and tiny rotation are allowed to decrease dye aggregation and emission; (iii) two of the three phenyl rings are bridged by a methine unit connected with two ethyl units. The two ethyl units help to inhibit dye aggregation and interfacial charge recombination.14b Combining these three characteristics, the donor unit has good planarity, which was expected to not only increase the life of the charge-separated state by delocalizing the generated cation over a large triarylamine π-plane, but also favour electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. Moreover, the good planarity of the donor unit will contribute to a high molar extinction coefficient. By single-bond connecting instead of bridging the new donor with a π-spacer, such as a thiophene unit, which allows the rotation of the donor and π-spacer, a controlled aggregation is anticipated. For the π-spacer, the introduction of a thiophene moiety was expected to allow red-shift of the spectrum,31–37 and broaden the spectral region of absorption. Based on the above considerations, five dyes as shown in Scheme 1 were designed and synthesized. In order to investigate whether the good planarity of the triarylamine based donor is good for the DSSCs performance or not, reference dye TPS employing a donor without planarity (shown in Scheme 1) was also synthesized. Improved performances for the new donor based DSSCs were expected.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Five dyes DIA1–DIA5 based on the new donor have been synthesized according to the synthetic routes of Scheme 2. The key intermediate-compound 5 was prepared from the starting materials of carbazole and methyl 2-iodobenzoate via Ullmann condensation, bromination, Grignard reaction and ring closure reaction sequentially. Oligothiophene moieties were constructed by repeated Suzuki coupling and bromination according to the previous report.32 The final products DIA1–DIA5 were obtained via two-step processes that involved first the Suzuki coupling of 5 with 6a–6e, followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine in THF, as shown in Scheme 2. Compound TPS was synthesized by using a literature procedure.33 The purification of intermediates was performed by flash column chromatography and subsequent HPLC. The molecular structures of the compounds were fully confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS.

Optical properties

Fig. 1(a) shows the absorption spectra of DIA1–DIA5 and TPS sensitizers measured in THF at ambient temperature. All of the dyes (DIA1–DIA5 and TPS) have a relatively broad and strong absorption in the UV and blue regions with maxima at 367, 440, 464, 474, 483 and 443 nm, respectively. For DIA2–DIA5 and TPS, the absorption bands at around 350 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition and the bands at around 410–550 nm to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and the acceptor, while for DIA1 only one absorption band appeared at around 350–500 nm which was assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer.34,35 Compared with DIA1, DIA2 was observed to be largely red shifted to a longer wavelength due to the presence of the thiophene instead of the benzene in the π-conjugated linker part. Such an outcome may be ascribed to the smaller resonance energy of thiophene than the benzene ring, which facilitates the charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor.36c With the increase of the chain length of the oligothiophene moiety, the onset values of DIA2, DIA3 and DIA4 exhibit red-shift sequentially at around 410–550 nm owing to the expansion of the conjugation systems. Under similar conditions, the DIA5 sensitizer exhibits the maximum absorption peak at 483 nm that is red shifted by 19 nm as compared to the DIA3 sensitizer because DIA5 has a benzothiadiazole moiety – a withdrawing group which could lead to a stronger internal charge transfer interaction.38 It is noteworthy that in comparison with TPS (2.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1), DIA2 based on the new donor was observed to have almost the same maximum absorption peak position, however, the molar extinction coefficient of DIA2 (6.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1) was much larger, indicating that the dye of DIA2 has good light harvesting ability. In addition, the molar extinction coefficients of the DIA3 and DIA4 were also quite high exceeding 6 × 104 M−1 cm−1, while DIA5 possessing electron withdrawing groups, displayed slightly lower values. The greater maximum absorption coefficients of the organic dyes allows for a correspondingly thinner nanocrystalline film so as to avoid the decrease in the film's mechanical strength. This also benefits the electrolyte diffusion in the film and reduces the recombination possibility of the light induced charges during transportation.33,39

The absorption spectra of the dyes on the surface of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 1(b). The absorption peaks of DIA2–DIA5 and TPS were observed to be blue-shifted by about 22, 16, 27, 6 and 21 nm with respect to those in the solution, respectively, except that DIA1 seemed to be red-shifted. The red-shift on the TiO2 films can be ascribed to the J-aggregation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface which can occur readily because of the presence of carboxyl groups.38 The blue-shift on TiO2 is due to the H-aggregation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. Because of the deprotonation of carboxylic acid upon adsorption onto the TiO2 surface the resulting carboxylate–TiO2 unit is a weaker electron acceptor compared to the carboxylic acid.37b It is noteworthy that DIA4 displayed a large blue-shift, indicating that DIA4 easily forms aggregates on the TiO2 surface.
The emission spectra of these dyes in a diluted solution of THF are recorded in Fig. 1(c). It is obvious that DIA1 was highly emissive, suggesting more energy loss will occur upon photo-excitation. However, compared with DIA1, the emission bands of DIA2–DIA5 and TPS were low, suggesting that energy losses caused by the emission for DIA2–DIA5 and TPS would be controllable.
Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, cyclic voltammograms of dyes attached to a nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on conducting FTO glass were performed in CH3CN solution using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte, Pt as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The SCE reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard. As shown in Fig. S2,† the DIA1, DIA3, DIA4 and TPS dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films show single oxidations at 2.1, 1.66, 1.65 and 1.55 V, respectively, which can be assigned to the oxidation of the donor group. For the DIA2 and DIA5 dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films, they display double oxidations at 2.08, 2.75 and 1.95, 2.20 V respectively. The first oxidation at low potential of the two dyes can be ascribed to the oxidation of the donor group, while the second oxidation at high potential may be resulted from the oxidation of the π-conjugated linker part and phenyl substituents. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of DIA1–DIA5 and TPS corresponding to their first redox potential are 1.39, 1.36, 1.28, 1.26, 1.35 and 1.04 V vs. NHE, respectively. It is noteworthy that the increase of thiophene unit on the π-conjugated linker part elevated the HOMO level, thus decreasing the oxidation potential, such as for DIA2, DIA3 and DIA4. The band gap energies (E(0–0)) of the dyes were 2.82, 2.48, 2.29, 2.20, 2.23 and 2.36 eV for DIA1–DIA5 and TPS, respectively, which was measured at the onset of absorption spectra in Fig. 1(b). The estimated excited state potentials corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, calculated from EHOMO − E(0–0), are −1.43, −1.12, −1.01, −0.94, −0.88 and −1.32 eV, respectively. The examined HOMO and LUMO levels are collected in Table 1. The HOMO levels of all the dyes are sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V), thus ensuring a smooth electron flow from the electrolyte to the dyes. The LUMO levels of these dyes were much more negative than the conduction-band-edge energy level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode (0.5 V vs. NHE), which implies that electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is energetically permitted.40,41

Computational analysis
To gain deeper insight into the geometrical configuration and the nature of luminescence displayed by these dyes, we carried out molecular orbital calculations for the seven compounds in the gas phase using the Gaussian 03 package. The geometry optimizations in the ground state were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional and a 3-21G* basis set. The molecular orbitals were obtained at the DFT level with the B3LYP/3-21G* method based on the optimized geometry of each compound.42Fig. 2 shows the ground-state geometries of the dyes with dihedral angles between the two neighbour conjugated segments indicated. As expected, for DIA1–DIA5, the three phenyl rings on the donor part are highly coplanar with each other with very small dihedral angles (0.1–0.3°), while there is significant twist of the three phenyl rings for TPS. The dihedral angles between the thienyl entity and the phenyl entity on the donor part (DIA2) is 10.7° (33.5° for DIA1, 22.8° for DIA2) smaller than that between the phenyl ring linked to the acceptor and the phenyl ring on the donor part (DIA1), indicating the better conjugation of the DIA2 than that of DIA1, which is in good agreement with the red shift of the UV-vis absorption spectra of DIA2. For DIA5, there is significant twist of the benzo[2,1,3] thiadiazole entities from co-planarity with the phenyl entity on the donor part, which is similar to the situation reported before.43 It is noteworthy that compared with that of TPS, although the donor of DIA2 displays much better planarity, the dihedral angle between the thienyl ring and phenyl ring linked to the nitrogen is larger, which may be the main reason for almost the same UV-vis absorption spectral. Table 1 summarizes the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of these dyes. The trend of the calculated HOMO energies, DIA1 (0.96 eV) > DIA2 (0.94 eV)> DIA5 (0.86 eV) > DIA3 (0.82 eV) > TPS (0.77 eV) > DIA4 (0.69 eV), is roughly consistent with that obtained from the electrochemical studies. The slight inconformity may stem from the gas-phase calculations which exclude the possible influence of the electron correlation and solvent.

DSSC performance

Fig. 3 shows the action spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs with these dyes. The dye coated TiO2 film was used as the working electrode, platinized FTO glass as the counter electrode and 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, 0.10 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile as the redox electrolyte. The losses of light reflection and absorption by the conducting glass were not corrected. As shown in Fig. 3(a), when THF was used as the solvent for the dye baths, all five dyes could efficiently convert visible light to photocurrent in the region from 400 nm to 600 nm except the DIA1 dye. The IPCE exceeds 70% in the spectral range 400–560 nm for DIA3, which reaches its maximum of 87.4% at 470 nm. The IPCE of DIA1, DIA2, DIA4, DIA5 and TPS reached a maximum 71.0% at 430 nm, 81.3% at 480 nm, 54.6% at 450 nm, 59.6% at 470 nm and 63.1% at 420 nm respectively. The difference of the maximum IPCE arises from three factors, i.e., the difference between the LUMO and the conduction band edge, the absorption capacity (Fig. 1 and Table 1), and the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film.44 The IPCE performance of the DSSCs with DIA2 is higher than that with DIA1 due to its broader photocurrent action spectrum. On the other hand, the IPCE values of DIA2 are obviously higher than that of TPS which may be as a result of the high molar extinction coefficient. The IPCE performance of the DSSCs with DIA3 is much better than that of DIA2 due to its broader photocurrent action spectrum and relatively higher molar extinction coefficient. On the other hand, though DIA4 and DIA5 has almost the same IPCE spectra as DIA3, due to their much lower IPCE values in the region of 300 nm to 700 nm, the IPCE performance of the DIA3 device is much higher than that of the DIA4 and DIA5 devices, indicating that the DIA3 sensitized TiO2 electrode would generate the highest conversion yield among the five dyes.
 Fig. 3  (a) IPCE action spectra for DSSCs based on DIA1–DIA5 and TPS with dye baths in THF; and (b) I–V curves for the DIA1-DIA5 and TPS devices with dye loading in THF under light (100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 solar light) and dark. 
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) plots of the DSSCs fabricated with these dyes, along with that of TPS for comparison, are shown in Fig. 3(b). The detailed parameters, i.e., short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) measured under AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2) are summarized in Table 2. When THF was used as the solvent for dye loading, we obtained a solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 2.96–6.50% with DSSCs based on DIA1–DIA5 and TPS. For the dyes, a high molar extinction coefficient, as well as broad absorption spectrum, helps to reinforce the light harvesting ability and thus could help to increase the Jsc of the DSSCs. The low Jsc for DIA1 can be mainly correlated with the narrow absorption spectra and low IPCE values. The DSSCs based on DIA2 exhibit a 25% higher value of η than that based on TPS, which could be as a result of a striking higher molar extinction coefficient and much higher Voc. The DSSCs based on DIA4 displayed very poor performance with low Jsc and low Voc. We speculate that the high lying HOMO of DIA4 results in less efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye after electron injection due to the diminished gap between the HOMO and the energy level of the redox couple. Moreover, the low Voc may be indicative of significant charge recombination. The DSSCs based on DIA5 displayed a lower η compared with that based on DIA3. The smaller Jsc should be mainly responsible for it, which may be ascribed to the lower molar extinction coefficient of DIA5. Among these dyes, the DSSCs based on DIA3 displayed the best performance with high Voc, large Jsc and relatively low FF corresponding to an overall efficiency of 6.50%. The large Jsc for the DSSCS based on DIA3 can be mainly ascribed to a high molar extinction coefficient, broad absorption spectra and appropriate HOMO and LUMO. This result agrees well with the corresponding IPCE spectra.

In different solvents, the dyes exhibit diversified interactions with the solvents, which could cause changes of the physical and chemical properties between the dyes and semiconductor surface.45 On the other hand, the thickness of the TiO2 films can pose an influence on the photovoltaic performance. Since DIA2 and DIA3 exhibited the better performances among the six dyes in this work, and DIA4 appeared to have enough room for improving the low efficiency due to the broad absorption spectra, we focus on the optimization of DSSCs based on these three dyes and the DSSCs based on TPS was also optimized for comparison. The final results are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2 and S1.† With thicker films of TiO2 and 40 h dye baths in the solvent mixture CHCl3–EtOH (v/v 3:7), we obtained the best optimized condition. All the DSSCs based on these dyes exhibited improved efficiency under this optimized condition and the order of the performances of these dyes devices remained the same as the order before optimization. The Jsc of DIA2, DIA3, DLA4 and TPS based DSSCs increased, respectively. One explanation for the increase of Jsc is that the amount of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 films was increased due to a combination of reasons including thicker films of TiO2, longer dip time and the solvent effect on TiO2 sensitization (more explanation regarding this point is in the ESI†). The Voc of the DIA3, DLA4 and TPS based DSSCs increased slightly under the optimized condition which may be ascribed to the less severe dye aggregation and slower charge recombination. As shown in Table 2, the best performance could be obtained under the final optimized condition, in which DIA3 achieved an overall efficiency of 8.09% (Jsc = 14.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.75 V, FF = 0.766).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further study the correlation between the charge transfer processes and photovoltaic properties in the DSSC devices with different sensitizers from DIA1–DIA5 and TPS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in the dark under a forward bias of −0.70 V with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Fig. 5(a) shows the EIS Nyquist plots (i.e. the minus imaginary part of the impedance Z′′ vs. the real part of the impedance Z′ when sweeping the frequency) for DSSCs based on DIA1–DIA5 and TPS dyes. Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots. The larger semicircle at lower frequencies corresponds to the charge transfer processes at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, while the smaller semicircle at higher frequencies corresponds to the charge transfer processes at the Pt–electrolyte interface. The charge recombination resistance at the TiO2 surface (Rrec), can be deduced by fitting curves from a range of intermediate frequencies using Z′-view software. It is related to the charge recombination rate, e.g., a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and therefore a larger dark current (Fig. 3(b)). The radius of the biggest semicircle increases in the order DIA4 ≈ DIA5 < TPS < DIA3 < DIA1 < DIA2. This trend roughly appears to be consistent with both the lower Voc values of DIA4 (0.57 V), DIA5 (0.64 V) and TPS (0.65 V), as well as the higher values of DIA1 (0.73 V), DIA2 (0.74 V), and DIA3 (0.69 V). The peak frequency in the Bode phase plots (Fig. 5(b)) of the middle-frequency peak is related to the charge recombination rate, and its reciprocal is regarded as the electron lifetime. The value of the middle-frequency peak decreases in the order DIA4 > DIA5 > TPS > DIA3 > DIA1 > DIA2 indicating that the order of the corresponding electron lifetimes is DIA4 < DIA5 < TPS < DIA3 < DIA1 < DIA2 which further supports the order of the Voc of DSSCs based on these dyes. From this data, it appears that fast charge recombination and low electron lifetimes exist for the DSSCs based on the DIA4 and DIA5 dyes, contributing to their very low efficiency although the two dyes have very broad absorption spectra and high molar extinction coefficients. Moreover, compared with the DSSCs based on the TPS, the DSSCs based on the dye of DIA2 with the new donor showed slower charge recombination and longer electron lifetime which contributed to a much higher Voc thus leading to higher energy efficiency.

Five new metal-free organic dyes (DIA1–DIA5) based on novel rigid triarylamine donors have been successfully synthesized and utilized in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These dyes exhibited much higher molar extinction coefficients (5.0 × 104–8.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1) than the dye based on a simple triphenylamine donor (TPS). Thus the DSSCs based dyes (DIA2, DIA3 and DIA5) exhibited high Jsc (10.0–13.7 mA cm−2). The good planarity of the donor, as well as the two ethyl units which were linked to a methine unit to bridge the two phenyl rings of the donor, was capable of stabilizing the oxidized dyes by distributing the positive charge to a more extended region which can increase the electron lifetime. Moreover, the two ethyl moieties of the donor can inhibit dye aggregation to some extent. As a result of the combination of the above factors, the rate of charge recombination was reduced and this could be evidenced by the high Voc of DIA2 and DIA3. With high Jsc, high Voc and high FF, the dyes of DIA3 exhibited the performance with an η value 6.50%, which was greatly increased to 8.09% by optimized conditions under standard global AM 1.5 solar light condition. Introducing long alkyl chain to the π-spacer would be useful to improve their device performance.
Experimental
Materials
Materials for the fabrication of the photovoltaic devices including FTO conducting glass (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide overlayer, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 15 Ω per square), Titania pastes of Ti-Nanoxide T/SP and Ti-Nanoxide 300 were purchased from Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd of China. The components of the electrolyte including lithium iodide, iodine with purity as high as up to 99.999% and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium (DMPII) were obtained from Fluka, Alfa Aesar and J&K Chemical, respectively. 4-tert-Butylpyridine and acetonitrile with HPLC purity were from SK Chemicals.
THF was pre-dried over sodium for 24 h and then redistilled under an argon atmosphere sodium benzophenone ketyl prior to use. Starting materials (4-formylphenyl)boronic acid and (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid were purchased from J&K Chemical. BuLi solution in hexane was from Aldrich. 5′-Bromo-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde, 5′′-bromo-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5-carbaldehyde and 5-(7-bromobenzo[c] [1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl) thiophene-2-carbaldehyde were prepared according to the previous published procedures. All other chemicals were obtained from Shanghai D&R Fine Chem. Co. Ltd and used without further purification.
Fabrication of the DSSC
The photoelectrode was prepared as the following procedure: to a piece of FTO conducting glass substrate washed with redistilled water, ethanol, chloroform, acetone and anhydrous ethanol sequentially, a film was firstly printed on using Titania pastes of Ti-Nanoxide (T/SP). After being dried in the oven at 125 °C for 10 min, a second layer of the TiO2 film with T/SP was coated and dried in the oven at 125 °C for 10 min. The total thickness of the film was 7 μm and a 4 μm thick third layer of 400 nm light-scattering anatase particles (Ti-Nanoxide 300) was further printed and dried by the previous condition. The obtained films were calcinated at 500 °C for 30 min and then cooled down. After immersing in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washing with redistilled water and ethanol, the films were put into calcination again at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to ambient temperature. Then, the films were allowed to be dipped into the 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye in THF for 24 h at room temperature. To prepare the counter electrode, 4 drops of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) were coated on the cleaned FTO glass followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min and a thin Pt film was deposited on the FTO glass during this procedure. Two holes (0.8 mm diameter) were drilled on this obtained counter electrode using a drill-press. The photoelectrode with a size of 0.25 cm2 (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) and the counter electrode were assembled into a cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 mm thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (DuPont). A drop of electrolyte was injected into the cell through the holes of the counter electrode. The assembled cell was sealed by a hot-melt inomer film and a cover glass. For the electrolytes, it was composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium (DMPII) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) acetonitrile (ACN) as a liquid electrolyte.
DSSC performance measurements
Photovoltaic measurements were carried out by an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (model no. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 MW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150V). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and the generated photocurrent was measured by a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The cell active area was tested with a mask of 0.25 cm−2. The IPCE test system consisted of a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier and a Model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp and power supply, and a 7ISW301Spectrometer. Impedance spectra were recorded using a CHI-660c electrochemical station.
Spectroscopic measurements

1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Brücker AM 400 spectrometer (relative to TMS). Mass spectra were recorded with a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The absorption spectra of the dyes in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer.
