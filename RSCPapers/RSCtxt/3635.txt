    , Accepted 28th November 2014First published on 28th November 2014AbstractThree low bandgap conjugated polymers based on 7-fluorinated isoindigo (IID1F) and dithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole (DTC), i.e., poly[N-dodecyldithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole-alt-7-fluoro-N,N-di(2-octyldodecyl)isoindigo] (P1), poly[N-dodecyldithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole-alt-7-fluoro-N,N-di(3-octyltridecyl)isoindigo] (P2) and poly[N-dodecyldithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole-alt-7-fluoro-N,N-di(4-octyltetradecyl)isoindigo] (P3), were synthesized. All three polymers are soluble in non-chlorinated solvent o-xylene owing to regio-random distribution of F-atoms along the conjugated backbone. The position of the alkyl-branching point has a negligible influence on energy levels and absorption spectra of the polymers, but has a small effect on their charge transport properties. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) of the polymers were fabricated with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron acceptor. When o-xylene was used as a solvent, all three polymers delivered power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 7%. P2 exhibited the best device performance with a PCE of 7.5%. The devices processed with o-xylene showed higher device efficiency than those fabricated with o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) since the films of polymer:PC61BM blends prepared with o-xylene exhibited better morphology and higher and more balanced charge-carrier mobilities, leading to less recombination loss and higher fill factor (FF).

Broader context
Extensive research efforts have been focused on BHJ PSCs in the last decade, and the PCEs of the state-of-the-art devices have surpassed 10%. However, these devices were processed using chlorinated solvents, which have an adverse impact on human health and the environment. From the viewpoint of large area production, the chlorinated solvents must be replaced by more environmentally friendly solvents, while maintaining the high PCEs of the devices. Although great efforts have been made in this aspect, only limited success has been achieved due to the low solubility of most of the high performance low bandgap conjugated polymers in non-chlorinated solvents. In the current paper, we propose a new design concept for low bandgap conjugated polymers soluble in non-chlorinated solvents. With PC61BM as an electron acceptor and o-xylene as a processing solvent, BHJ PSCs with PCE up to 7.5% have been demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is one of the highest values for BHJ PSCs processed with non-chlorinated solvents, and is also among the highest for BHJ PSCs with PC61BM as an electron acceptor.

1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising renewable energy resources due to their low cost, light weight and ease of large-area fabrication on flexible substrates.1–7 Over the past decade, great progress has been made in this field owing to the development of new donor or acceptor materials, the optimization of processing conditions and the amelioration of device structures.8–22 To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction and tandem BHJ PSCs have surpassed 9% and 10%, respectively.22,23 However, the most common and successful solvents for making high performance BHJ PSCs are chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). These chlorinated solvents have an adverse impact on human health and the environment.24 From the viewpoint of practical applications and sustainable development of BHJ PSCs, chlorinated solvents have to be replaced by non-chlorinated ones, while maintaining the high efficiency of the devices.
To fabricate BHJ PSCs using non-chlorinated solvents, the first requirement is that the conjugated polymer should have a good solubility in such solvents. However, most of the conjugated polymers with high mobility and low bandgaps, which are necessary properties for the fabrication of high performance PSCs, usually have a poor solubility in non-chlorinated solvents due to their incompatible physical properties such as the Hansen solubility parameter.25 Actually, to date several low bandgap polymers can be used to fabricate efficient BHJ PSCs with non-chlorinated solvents.25–34 For example, Jen et al. demonstrated BHJ PSCs with PCE up to 7.15% using a ladder-type conjugated polymer as a donor, phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor, and o-xylene/1,2-dimethylnaphthalene as a solvent.30 Hou et al. synthesized a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based conjugated polymer carrying triethylene glycol monoether (TEG) side chains. This polymer is soluble in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF). BHJ PSCs fabricated with PC71BM and NMP as an acceptor and solvent, respectively, exhibited a PCE up to 5.23% when 5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as an additive.31
The solubility of conjugated polymers can be improved by the modulation of the conjugated backbone or the engineering of solubilising groups. The polymers comprising a conjugated backbone with a large curvature generally exhibit high solubility.35,36 The introduction of side groups with large bulkiness or via sp3 hybrid atoms (such as C or Si) can also endow conjugated polymers with higher solubility.28,30,37 However, these characteristics usually prohibit the close or ordered packing between polymer chains and therefore are detrimental to the charge transporting properties of the resulting conjugated polymers. On the other hand, the regioregularity strongly influences the solubility of conjugated polymers.9,38,39 It is possible to enhance the solubility of conjugated polymers via slightly lowering the regioregularity while maintaining the charge carrier mobility without any noticeable decrease in it. For instance, Ong et al. found that the introduction of 10 mol% 3′-methyl-3,3′′′-dialkylquaterthiophene units into poly(3,3′′′-dialkyl quaterthiophene) (PQT) could significantly improve the solubility of the polymer in o-xylene. Organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with a hole mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to that of PQT, were successfully fabricated with o-xylene as a solvent.38 Low bandgap conjugated polymers that comprise alternatively arranged dithienocarbazole (DTC) and isoindigo (IID) units are promising donor materials for BHJ PSCs when o-DCB was used as a solvent.15 In the current paper, we report that the solubility of this type of polymer in non-chlorinated aromatic solvents, such as o-xylene, can be improved by simply introducing one fluorine (F) atom into the IID unit to lower the regioregularity, allowing the fabrication of BHJ PSCs with this solvent. A PCE of 7.5% has been demonstrated with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is one of the highest values for BHJ PSCs fabricated with non-chlorinated solvents.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The chemical structures of polymers P1, P2 and P3 are depicted in Chart 1, and their synthesis and characterization are included in the ESI.† All three polymers are soluble in o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethyl-benzene, with a solubility of >5 mg mL−1 in o-xylene no matter where the branching points of the side alkyl chains are. In contrast, the polymers without or with two F atoms at 7,7′-positions of the IID unit are insoluble in non-chlorinated solvents, but only in hot CB and o-DCB.15 We attribute the improved solubility to the low regioregularity of the polymers due to the introduction of one F atom into the IID unit. Because 1H NMR spectra exhibited low resolution due to the strong aggregation tendency of the polymers, it was difficult to obtain the information on their regioregularity. In order to verify the above point, a model coupling reaction of 6,6′-dibromo-7-fluoro-isoindigo (1, 2 equiv.) and benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl-trimethyl-stannane (2, 1 equiv.) was carried out, and the products were analysed by 1H NMR (Fig. S1 and S2†). In the mono-coupling products as shown in Scheme 1, the ratio of 3:4 was about 1:2. The low selectivity of the two C–Br bonds (with and without neighbouring F atoms) implies that F atoms must distribute in a regio-random feature along the conjugated backbone in P1, P2 and P3, leading to a low regioregularity. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) are 60.8 kDa and 2.7 for P1, 44.2 kDa and 2.6 for P2 and 49.5 kDa and 1.9 for P3, as evaluated by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent at 150 °C (Table 1).

All three polymers exhibited high thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures above 370 °C, as revealed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S3†). No thermal transitions were observed in their differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) scans in the range of 25–320 °C (Fig. S4†). Meanwhile, no diffraction peaks were observed in X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. S5†). All these indicate that the polymers are amorphous.
2.2. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the polymers
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymers were recorded both in o-xylene solution and in thin film (Fig. 1 and S6 in the ESI†), and data are summarized in Table 1. All three polymers show dual-band absorption with absorption maxima at ∼410 and ∼685 nm, respectively. From solution to film, the absorption bands become broader, but no obvious shift in the absorption maxima was observed for all three polymers. In both solution and film states, three polymers have the almost same long-wavelength absorption maxima and onsets, which are ∼685 and ∼800 nm, respectively. The film optical bandgap (Eoptg) extracted from the absorption onsets is in the range of 1.57–1.60 eV. This is very different from that of the conjugated polymers based on IID and 2,2′-bithophene units,40 which exhibited distinctly red-shifted absorption maxima and absorption onsets when the alkyl-chain branching point was away from the polymer backbone. The authors attributed the phenomenon to the effect of the alkyl-chain branching point on the intermolecular interaction. The polymers with the alkyl-chain branching point away from the polymer backbone had a shorter π–π packing distance, enforcing polymer chains to adopt more planar structures, thereby exhibiting red-shifted absorption spectra. However, polymers P1, P2 and P3 are amorphous, and the polymer chains packed in a relatively disordered fashion in the solid state. Therefore, the position of the branching point of the alkyl chains has a negligible effect on their absorption spectra.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties and estimate the energy levels of the polymers. CV curves are shown in Fig. 1, and the data are outlined in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers are −5.30 and −3.67 eV for P1, −5.28 and −3.64 eV for P2, and −5.27 and −3.67 eV for P3.
2.3. Charge transport properties of the polymers
OTFT and space charge limited current (SCLC) techniques were employed to investigate the hole-transport properties of the polymers. The data are summarized in Table 2. For field-effect mobility measurements, bottom gate and top contact OTFT devices were fabricated with either o-DCB or o-xylene as a spin-casting solvent. For the devices made with o-DCB, the hole mobilities were 3.2 × 10−3, 6.1 × 10−3 and 8.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. The devices prepared with o-xylene as the solvent exhibited higher mobilities, which were 9.2 × 10−3, 1.6 × 10−2 and 1.9 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. We attribute this improvement of mobilities to the better self-assembly properties of the polymers in o-xylene. In fact, gelation was observed when polymer solutions in o-xylene with a concentration above 3.5 mg mL−1 were stored at room temperature. Compared to P1, P2 and P3 exhibited higher mobilities. Recent studies on the polymers based on IID and 2,2′-bithophene units showed that mobilities of the polymers increased with the alkyl-chain branching point away from the conjugated backbone due to shortened π–π stacking distances.40 Although the current polymers are amorphous, we speculate that the alkyl branching point still has an impact on the intermolecular interaction, thereby affecting charge transporting properties.

For SCLC mobility measurements, hole-only devices were fabricated with a device structure of glass/ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer (180 nm)/MoO3/Al, and the hole mobility was calculated according to the Mott–Gurney equation:41–43 J = 9ε0εrμhV2/8L3(1)where ε0, εr, μh and L are the permittivity of free space, the relative permittivity of the material, the hole mobility and the thickness of the polymer film, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the SCLC hole mobilities were in the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The devices with different thicknesses of polymer layers (120–260 nm) were also fabricated and measured for proving the applicability of the method (Fig. S10–12 in the ESI†). Similar to the phenomenon in OTFT measurements, higher mobilities were also observed when o-xylene was used as the solvent.
2.4. Photovoltaic properties of the polymers
The photovoltaic (PV) properties of the polymers were investigated with a conventional device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The details of device fabrication and testing conditions are described in the ESI.†o-Xylene was chosen as a non-chlorinated solvent because it possesses an appropriate boiling point and viscosity as well as a high solubility for PCBM.30,44 To attain the best device performance, the weight ratio of polymer:PC61BM was optimized. For all three polymers, the devices with a polymer:PC61BM weight ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w) delivered the best device performance (Fig. S13 and Table S1 in the ESI†). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured from the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig. 2a, and the key parameters for the device performance are outlined in Table 3. The device based on all these polymers exhibited a similar open circuit voltage (VOC) in a range of 0.82–0.84 V, which is in good agreement with their similar HOMO energy levels. PCEs of 6.8, 7.1 and 7.0% were achieved for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Slightly higher efficiencies for P2 and P3 are ascribed to a higher short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), which is consistent with their higher hole-mobility. For comparison, the devices were also prepared with normally used chlorinated solvent o-DCB. PCEs of the devices were 5.7%, 6.0% and 6.0% for P1, P2 and P3, respectively (Table 3). This efficiency decrease (∼20%) is mainly due to lower FF and JSC.

Heeger et al. reported that the device performance of BHJ PSCs could be improved by treating the deposited polymer:PCBM film with polar solvents, such as methanol.45 In this case, PCBM will be relatively enriched in the top surface of the blend film, which is favourable for the formation of ohmic contact, accelerating charge extraction and reducing charge recombination.46–48 To further improve the device performance, we treated the active layer with methanol for 2 min before the cathode deposition. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2c, for all these polymers, both JSC and FF were improved. With P2 as an example, JSC and FF were enhanced from 12.5 mA cm−2 and 0.69 to 12.8 mA cm−2 and 0.71, respectively. As a result, PCEs were increased to 7.3, 7.5 and 7.4% for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. It is worthwhile noting that a PCE of 7.5% was realized with P2 as a donor material, which is one of the highest values for BHJ PSCs fabricated with non-chlorinated solvents,30 and is also among the highest for BHJ PSCs with PC61BM as an electron acceptor.49–52 Inverted devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Al have also been prepared following the procedure reported previously.15 However, PCEs of the devices are comparable to those of the conventional devices (Table S2 in the ESI†).
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded and the curves are shown in Fig. 3b and d. All the devices had a response in the range of 300–750 nm, with the highest EQE value of ∼60%. After methanol treatment, the photo-conversion efficiencies in the long wavelength region (contribution of the polymer) were slightly increased. JSC values were calculated by integrating the EQE data with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. The PCEs calculated from these JSC values are listed in Table 3, which are largely consistent with the values obtained by J–V measurements with an error less than 5%.

BHJ PSCs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor material usually exhibit higher device performance relative to those based on PC61BM due to the enhancement of JSC.53–55 Then we also fabricated PSCs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor material. As shown in Fig. S14 in the ESI,†JSC values of the devices were enhanced ∼10% due to the increased response at 490–500 nm. However, PCEs were almost identical to those with PC61BM as the electron acceptor material due to the relatively low FF. A similar phenomenon was observed for other IID-based polymers.50
2.5. Recombination kinetics
The performance of BHJ PSCs is closely related to charge recombination kinetics, which can be elucidated by analysing the light intensity dependence of J–V characteristics.56,57 Therefore, the J–V characteristics of the PSCs were measured at different light intensities (from 100 to 10 mW cm−2) in order to understand why the devices processed with o-xylene delivered better performance. The data for the devices based on P1 are displayed in Fig. 3 and those for P2 and P3 are depicted in the ESI (Fig. S15 and S16†). For the devices prepared with o-xylene, photocurrent quickly saturated at low reversed biases. However, for those prepared from o-DCB, the photocurrent saturation was slower, especially at high illumination density, implying the presence of more pronounced recombination under the conditions near the VOC.

Fig. 3c, S12c and S13c† show the double-logarithmic plots of photocurrent density under short-circuit conditions as a function of the incident light intensity for the devices based on P1, P2 and P3, respectively, and the solid lines represent the fitting according to the power law JSC ∝ Iα (I is the incident light intensity). All devices prepared with o-xylene exhibited α values closer to 1 than those prepared with o-DCB. With P1 as an example, α-values were 0.998 and 0.971 for the devices prepared with o-xylene and o-DCB, respectively. This means less bimolecular recombination for the device prepared with o-xylene.
The slope of VOCversus ln(I) reflects the nature of the recombination (monomolecular versus bimolecular) involved in BHJ PSCs.56 Monomolecular recombination is dominant when the slope is equal to 2kT/e. In the case of bimolecular recombination, a slope of kT/e should be observed. As shown in Fig. 3d, S12d and S13d,† compared with the devices prepared with o-xylene, those prepared with o-DCB exhibited a stronger dependence of VOC on light intensity as indicated by a larger slope. For example, the slope-values for the devices based on P1 were 1.34kT/e and 1.14kT/e, respectively, when o-DCB and o-xylene were used as solvents (Fig. 3d). This indicates that less monomolecular recombination was involved for the devices prepared with o-xylene. According to the above results, both monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination were reduced when the solvent was switched from o-DCB to o-xylene.
2.6. Film morphology and charge transport properties of polymer:PC61BM blends
To understand the origin of the above results, the film morphology and charge transport properties of the polymer:PC61BM blends were studied. Fig. 4 shows the bright-field TEM images of the films cast with both o-xylene and o-DCB as solvents. All the films presented the fibril-like morphology and exhibited a phase separation on a nanometer-scale. The fibrils in the films cast with o-xylene were more obvious. This is consistent with the fact that the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiencies of the blend films prepared with o-xylene and o-DCB are very close (Fig. S17–19 in the ESI†). For example, 82 and 78% PL was quenched for P2:PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w) films when o-xylene and o-DCB were used, respectively. The effect of processing solvents on the charge transport properties of the blend films was investigated by the SCLC method. The structures of hole-only and electron-only devices are glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Al and glass/Al/polymer:PC61BM/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4, when o-xylene was used, hole mobilities were 3.92 × 10−4, 5.71 × 10−4 and 5.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1:PC61BM, P2:PC61BM and P3:PC61BM, respectively, which are 2.6, 1.8 and 2.5 times of those of the devices processed from o-DCB. A similar trend was also observed for electron mobility. Moreover, the films cast with o-xylene exhibited more balanced hole and electron mobilities (me/mh = 2.5–2.9 and 3.3–5.0 for the films prepared with o-xylene and o-DCB, respectively). Combining all the above results, the blend films processed using o-xylene as the solvent exhibited better morphology and higher and more balanced charge-carrier mobilities, which is helpful to reduce the recombination loss and increase the swept-out rate of free charge carriers in BHJ PSCs. Consequently, BHJ PSCs processed with o-xylene displayed a higher FF and JSC, thereby delivering higher PCEs.

3. Conclusions
Low bandgap conjugated polymers based on monofluorinated IID (IID1F) and DTC units, which are soluble in non-chlorinated solvent o-xylene, have been synthesized and characterized. The improvement of the solubility can be attributed to the regio-random distribution of F-atoms along the conjugated backbone. The position of the alkyl branching point has a negligible influence on the energy levels as well as absorption spectra, but has an impact on charge transport properties. BHJ PSCs based on all these polymers prepared using o-xylene as a solvent and PC61BM as an electron acceptor exhibited PCEs above 7.0%. The devices prepared with o-xylene showed better performance than those processed with o-DCB because the blend films had better morphology and higher and more balanced charge-carrier mobilities, leading to less recombination loss and higher FF. BHJ PSCs with P2 as a donor material displayed the best device performance with a PCE of 7.5%. This efficiency is one of the highest values for BHJ PSCs fabricated with non-chlorinated solvents, and is also among the highest for BHJ PSCs with PC61BM as an electron acceptor. Our study provides a new polymer design concept toward low bandgap conjugated polymers for the fabrication of efficient BHJ PSCs with non-chlorinated solvents.

Broader context
Extensive research efforts have been focused on BHJ PSCs in the last decade, and the PCEs of the state-of-the-art devices have surpassed 10%. However, these devices were processed using chlorinated solvents, which have an adverse impact on human health and the environment. From the viewpoint of large area production, the chlorinated solvents must be replaced by more environmentally friendly solvents, while maintaining the high PCEs of the devices. Although great efforts have been made in this aspect, only limited success has been achieved due to the low solubility of most of the high performance low bandgap conjugated polymers in non-chlorinated solvents. In the current paper, we propose a new design concept for low bandgap conjugated polymers soluble in non-chlorinated solvents. With PC61BM as an electron acceptor and o-xylene as a processing solvent, BHJ PSCs with PCE up to 7.5% have been demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is one of the highest values for BHJ PSCs processed with non-chlorinated solvents, and is also among the highest for BHJ PSCs with PC61BM as an electron acceptor.
