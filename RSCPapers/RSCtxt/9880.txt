    , Accepted 20th May 2019First published on 25th May 2019AbstractTo reduce the toxicity of Pb in perovskite solar cells, the structural stabilities, electronic and optical properties of the mixed perovskites MAPb0.75B0.25I3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) were predicted using density functional theory. The calculated results show that the introduction of alkaline-earth metal components caused the structural stabilities of the mixed perovskites to weaken compared to that of MAPbI3. Moreover, the bandgaps of metal-doped perovskites are larger than that of MAPbI3. The results indicate that the bandgaps of the mixed perovskites are mainly determined by the Pb–I–B bond angles in the ab plane. The optical absorption coefficients of all of the metal-doped perovskites significantly decrease due to the use of alkaline-earth metals. These results provide a deep insight into a new kind of lead-free perovskite.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have received great attention for photovoltaic applications because of their low solution-processing cost, suitable band gap, and good-harvesting ability.1–7 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has improved from 3.8%8 to 23.7%9 over recent years. However, several critical issues of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites still need to be overcome, such as the poor stability and toxicity of Pb.
Great efforts have been made to obtain Pb-less or Pb-free light absorbers for perovskite solar cells. Consequently, to reduce the toxicity of Pb, other metal elements must be found to replace or partially substitute Pb in perovskite structures. The chemical formula of perovskite materials is usually described as ABX3, where A and B are inorganic/organic cations (Cs+, MA+ (CH3NH3+), FA+ (CH(NH2)2+)) and divalent metal ions (Pb2+, Sn2+, and Ge2+), respectively. X represents halide ions (Cl−, Br−, and I−). The compounds’ crystal structure is determined by a tolerance factor t and an octahedral factor μ:10,11 (1) (2)where RA, RB, and RX are the radii of the three kinds of ions, respectively. When 0.81 ≤ t ≤ 1.1112 and 0.44 < μ < 0.90,11 the compound will form a 3D perovskite structure.
Sn2+ was first applied in Pb-less or Pb-free organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, because Pb and Sn are in the same group in the periodic table of elements. Moreover, they have similar electronic structures. Despite the narrower band gaps and broad absorption region of visible light of Sn-based perovskites, the materials do not exhibit satisfactory photovoltaic performance.2,13 A series of Ge-based perovskites AGeI3 (A: Cs, MA, and FA) have been synthesized and their band gaps are 1.60, 1.90, and 2.20 eV, respectively.14 Due to very low VOC values of CsGeI3 and MAGeI3, the device exhibited PCEs of only 0.2% and 0.11%, respectively.15 Mg-, Ca-, Sr-, and Ba-based perovskites were theoretically studied to explore the excellent photovoltaic performance of lead-free perovskite materials in recent years.16–19 The results showed that their band gaps were considerably larger than that of MAPbI3,19,20 which makes them unsuitable for application as a light-harvesting layer in solar cells. The synthesis of materials with a mixed perovskite with both lead and alkaline-earth metals has not been reported yet. The same cationic charge and suitable size of alkaline-earth metals compared to those of lead which was theoretically predicted can open up the possibility of partial replacement of lead with alkaline-earth metals to explore stable lead-less perovskite materials.
The present work presents a systematic search for potential candidates for application as lead-less perovskite materials that preserve the photovoltaic performance of Pb-based perovskites. Therefore, an in-depth theoretical study was carried out for perovskites MAPb0.75B0.25I3, in which the Pb element is partially replaced with alkaline-earth metals (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba). For each of the MAPb0.75B0.25I3 compounds, the structural stability, and electronic and optical properties were investigated using first-principles calculations.
2. Methods and calculations
First principles calculations were performed by using the projected augmented wave plane-wave method,21 implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.22 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)23 exchange–correlation functional Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof with optB86b-vdW24 was employed for the geometric optimization. An energy cutoff of 550 eV was used and the atom positions were optimized using the conjugate gradient scheme until the maximum force was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. Brillouin zone sampling was carried out using a 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst–Pack grid for structural relaxation and an 8 × 8 × 8 grid for determination of electronic and optical properties. It is important to include the effect of spin–orbital coupling (SOC) in the calculations of electronic properties. However, the band gap calculated using GGA–SOC is much smaller than the experimental data.25,26 The GGA approximation has been shown to provide better agreement with the experimental results.27,28 Therefore, the GGA functional was used to calculate the band structures of the mixed MAPb0.75B0.25I3 perovskites.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure and stability analysis
MAPbI3 adopts a tetragonal structure with space group I4/mcm at room temperature.29 A tetragonal unit cell of MAPbI3 consists of four units of MAPbI3. One proportion of Pb of MAPbI3 is replaced by alkaline-earth metals. The optimized stable structures of the MAPb0.75B0.25I3 perovskites are shown in Fig. 1. The results of our calculated structural properties such as lattice parameters and volume are listed in Table 1. The relaxed lattice parameters for MAPbI3 are in good agreement with the experimental values.29 The calculated lattice parameters as well as the volume are seen to increase due to the replacement of alkaline-earth metals from Mg to Ba. The incorporation of alkaline-earth metals in MAPbI3 does not have a remarkable impact on the lattice parameters.

To further evaluate of the stabilities of the mixed perovskites, we calculated the formation energies of pure and metal-doped perovskites using the following equation: ΔH = E(MAPb0.75B0.25I3) − [E(MAI) + 0.25E(BI2) + 0.75E(PbI2)](3)where E(MAPb0.75B0.25I3), E(MAI), E(BI2), and E(PbI2) refer to the formation energies of MAPb0.75B0.25I3, MAI, BI2, and PbI2 phases, respectively. The calculated formation energies of the pure and mixed perovskites are shown in Fig. 2. For MAPbI3, our calculated formation energy is well consistent with previous calculated results.30,31 The results indicate that the mixed perovskites are unstable due to their positive formation energies. However, a previous report has indicated that the tetragonal phases of MABI3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) are stable.19,20 The results also show that the differences between the stabilities of MAPbI3, MAPb0.75Ca0.25I3, and MAPb0.75Sr0.25I3 are relatively small. The stabilities of MAPb0.75Mg0.25I3, and MAPb0.75Ba0.25I3 are poor because of their larger positive formation energies. The previous calculated results indicated that the stability of MAPb0.75Ba0.25I3 was less stable than that of MAPbI3.32 Only a small amount of doping using alkaline-earth metals in the perovskite MAPbI3 has been reported experimentally so far.33–36

3.2 Electronic properties
One of the most important properties of hybrid perovskites for photovoltaic applications is electronic properties. The comparison of the calculated band gap for the considered four mixed perovskites MAPb0.75B0.25I3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) is shown in Fig. 3. The calculated results of the electronic band structure show that the considered mixed perovskites are direct band gap semiconductors with a minimum band gap at the G (0, 0, 0) point of the Brillouin zone. We have found that the band gap values of the mixed perovskites increase gradually from Mg to Ba, as shown in Fig. 4. The bandgaps are 1.76, 1.86, 1.94, and 1.97 eV for MAPb0.75Mg0.25I3, MAPb0.75Ca0.25I3, MAPb0.75Sr0.25I3, and MAPb0.75Ba0.25I3, respectively. The band gap of MAPbI3 is 1.49 eV, which is found to be consistent with the experimental37 and theoretical results.38 The results indicate that the bandgaps of the mixed perovskites are larger than those of MAPbI3. A previous study also showed that the band gap of MAPb0.75Ba0.25I3 was 1.98 eV.32 However, the slightly doped-Sr and doped-Ba in the perovskite materials (MAPb1−xMxI3−yCly) can decrease the bandgaps.39 It can be found that the band gaps of the mixed perovskites increase greatly when the proportion of the doped-metal is 25%. The ideal band gap for the single junction solar cell is about 1.3 eV. Therefore, we do not further investigate the larger proportion of doped-metals on the electronic properties of the mixed perovskites.

Evolution of the electronic properties of hybrid perovskites is determined by the changes in their structure, and the main factor is the Pb–I–Pb bond angle.40 The Pb–I–B bond angles of the mixed perovskites are shown in Table 2. The Pb–I–B bond angle from the c axis shows little changes for the mixed perovskites. However, the Pb–I–B bond angle from the ab plane decreases gradually from Mg to Ba. The results indicate that the ab plane distortion may play a greater role in tuning the band gap.

Fig. 5 shows the projected density of states (PDOS) for the MAPb0.75B0.25I3. Analysis of the PDOS near the Fermi level reveals that the p orbital of I contributes mainly to the valence band edges, whereas the p orbital of Pb contributes mainly to the conduction band edges. The organic cation and alkaline-earth cation do not contribute to the band edge states.

3.3 Optical properties
The absorption coefficient is another important factor of a material for application in perovskite solar cells. To evaluate the effect of metal-doping on the optical performance of the mixed perovskites, the optical absorption coefficient of each structure was calculated. The absorption coefficient I(ω) is given as below:41 (4)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function depending on the light frequency ω. The calculated optical absorption coefficients for MAPbI3 and various MAPb0.75B0.25I3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) compounds in the visible region are shown in Fig. 6. It is apparent that the optical absorption coefficients of all of the mixed perovskites are lower than those of MAPbI3 in the whole visible light region. The differences between the optical absorption coefficients of MAPb0.75Ca0.25I3, MAPb0.75Sr0.25I3, and MAPb0.75Ba0.25I3 are much small. Notably, in the 200–300 nm region, the optical absorption coefficients of MAPb0.75Ca0.25I3, MAPb0.75Sr0.25I3, and MAPb0.75Ba0.25I3 are higher than those of MAPbI3 and MAPb0.75Mg0.25I3. Bai et al. reported that the photovoltaic performance of MAPb1−xSrxI3 (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) decreased obviously compared with that of MAPbI3.42

4. Conclusions
In summary, in order to reduce the toxicity of lead in photovoltaic materials, a certain proportion of lead in the tetragonal phase MAPbI3 could be replaced by alkaline-earth metals to obtain a new kind of lead-less perovskite. In this study, the structural stabilities, and electronic and optical properties of MAPb0.75B0.25I3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) perovskites were predicted. The results indicate that the introduction of alkaline-earth metals caused the structural stabilities of the mixed perovskites to weaken compared to that of MAPbI3. The band gaps of the mixed perovskites are also larger than that of MAPbI3. The results indicate that the bandgaps of the mixed perovskites are mainly determined by the Pb–I–B bond angles in the ab plane. The optical absorption coefficients of all of the metal-doped perovskites are lower than those of MAPbI3 in the visible light region. We believe that these results will be beneficial for the development of Pb-free perovskite solar cells.
