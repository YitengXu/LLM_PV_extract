    , Accepted 8th July 2019First published on 9th July 2019AbstractLong-chain lead carboxylates, on the one hand, represent compounds for versatile industrial applications in high-tech industries, while on the other hand, they are predominant constituents of secondary products of saponification of paint layers in works of art. Affecting significantly the appearance and stability of painted works of art, saponification is one of the most serious problems of preservation of cultural heritage objects. Despite their versatility as well as hazardousness, there is a paucity of single-crystal X-ray structures of long-chain carboxylates, due to difficulties in preparing single crystals of sufficient quality. We studied the crystal structure of polycrystalline mixed lead carboxylates of the formula Pb(C16)2−x(C18)x (x = 0; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75; 1; 1.5; 2), where C16 and C18 stand for hexadecanoate (palmitate) and octadecanoate (stearate) anions, respectively, by complementary X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and 13C and 207Pb solid state NMR (ssNMR). Mixed lead carboxylates consisting of hexadecanoate and octadecanoate are relevant to the formation of soaps in egg yolk and/or oil-based binders combined with lead-based pigments, which belong to the most common pigments in history. Combining an advanced XRPD analysis with a comparative analysis of ssNMR parameters, we described the structural model of mixed lead carboxylates. We revealed that both hexadecanoate (C16) and octadecanoate (C18) chains are present in one crystal structure, creating the statistical disorder at the ethyl end of the chains. Based on the 207Pb ssNMR spectra, we revealed two distinct local environments of lead atoms, corresponding to the symmetrically (i.e., (C16)–Pb–(C16) and/or (C18)–Pb–(C18) and asymmetrically (i.e., (C16)–Pb–(C18)) substituted lead carboxylates, and we confirmed the formation of a holo-directed structure for both the structural motifs. The structural models were applied to identify the neo-formed crystalline lead soap in a model experiment simulating the simplified historic paint consisting of the pigment lead tin yellow type I and emulsion binder prepared from egg yolk and linseed oil. We identified the secondary product as a mixed lead carboxylate of the composition Pb(C16)(C18).
Introduction
Lead-based white, red and/or yellow pigments represent, on the one hand, the widespread and extensively used pigments in Europe from the Roman period onwards,1 while on the other hand, they bear a risk of undesirable changes of the painted works of art resulting from their reactivity as was evidenced by many case studies. Besides their sensitivity to salt attacks in murals2 or reactions with other pigments in mediaeval manuscripts,3 their interactions with fatty binders in oil and tempera paintings represent one of the most serious problems of preservation of cultural heritage nowadays.
In oil or tempera paint layers, metal +2 cations (usually Pb, Zn or Cu) released from pigment particles react with saturated fatty acids released by the hydrolysis of glycerides from oil or egg containing binders during the formation of metal soaps, i.e., metal carboxylates of corresponding free fatty acids.4–6 The presence of metal soaps in a paint layer results in undesirable secondary changes such as the formation of aggregates, protrusions, efflorescences, colour changes or loss of mechanical integrity of paint layers. Although the general mechanism of saponification seems to be obvious and the symptoms of saponification are easily discernible, e.g., by microscopic methods,7 there are still pieces of knowledge which remain unclear in the saponification process (e.g., promoting or inhibiting factors, mechanisms of aggregation, kinetics of partial stages or precise composition and structure of neo-formed metal carboxylates), which limit effective measures from being taken for arresting these degradation processes as well as for the preservation and safe exhibition, cleaning and restoration of valuable oil and tempera painting.6,8
Besides the recent major concern in conservation science, lead carboxylates are of considerable technical and scientific interest because of their versatile applications in both, the traditional and the innovative high-tech industry as well. They have been used as additives in the paint and coating industry (e.g., as secondary driers, corrosion inhibitors, emulsifiers, grease thickeners or dispersants). Furthermore, lead carboxylates are important precursors for functional materials based on MOFs for gas sorption or for the syntheses of superconducting Pb(0) nanocrystals and clusters of PbSe nanocrystals for high-efficiency solar cells.9 Exhibiting interesting optical properties, lead carboxylates are also studied as promising X-ray phosphors and luminescent materials for light-emitting devices or components of glassy composites for non-linear optics.10
Surprisingly, despite the wide palette of their applications, there is a paucity of single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for Pb(II) carboxylates. Only few of the structures have been reported, notably lead formate,11 lead acetate,11 lead crotonate,12 lead heptanoate,13 lead azelate,14 and lead octanoate and one polymorph of both lead nonanoate and lead decanoate.10 Obviously, the attempts to prepare single crystals of long chain members of lead(II) alkanoate series of sufficient quality for X-ray diffraction studies have not succeeded yet and thus one has to rely on reported powder X-ray diffraction patterns.10,15 Studying the polymorphism and solid and liquid mesophases in Pb(II) alkanoates of the series from octanoate (C8) to octadecanoate (C18), Martínez-Casado et al.10 reported structural models for lead(II) alkanoates based on high resolution X-ray powder diffraction, contributing to the knowledge significantly but not yet still fully sufficient.
Lead hexadecanoate (palmitate), lead octadecanoate (stearate) and, in some cases small quantities of lead azelate, have been reported as components of soap inclusions in oil and tempera paintings,6,16–18 however, the composition and structure of lead carboxylates in saponified paint layers can be more complicated, involving multiple metals or a mixture of anions arranged in different levels of ordering from amorphous to crystalline.19,20 Complementary FTIR and XRPD analyses of some works of art and model paint films showed the coincident occurrence of lead hexadecanoate and octadecanoate in metal soaps and proved that both lead carboxylates are present in one crystalline phase.14,20,21 Because of missing structural data, these mixed lead carboxylates might be misinterpreted, e.g., as lead heptadecanoate, since both occupy very close positions of the diffraction maxima in the XRPD pattern, however, being very improbable because of the rare occurrence of heptadecanoic acid in natural fats.22 The lack of crystal structure data limits both the study of saponification mechanisms in model systems and the appropriate identification of lead carboxylates in painted works of art by XRD-based techniques including macroscopic XRPD scanning which represents a novel powerful tool for non-invasive mapping of the distribution of crystalline components in paintings and which potentially could detect the initial stages of saponification even before this is manifested by the abovementioned undesirable symptoms of degradation.23
Despite the absence of single crystals, it is feasible to determine the crystal structure of mixed lead carboxylates based on powder XRD data. Traditionally, structural descriptions of polycrystalline systems have been conducted using XRPD. However, in the case of complex crystal structures containing large organic moieties, the resolution of laboratory XRPD techniques is usually not sufficient to precisely locate atomic positions.24 In such cases, experimental ssNMR approaches provide more detailed information about the investigated structure, as these techniques offer unique and valuable insight into the local electronic environment of the material. For organic systems, the detailed structures and behaviors of their polymorphic, disordered and amorphous phases can be revealed.25–27 Recently, an advanced approach of ssNMR spectroscopy has been successfully used to elucidate lead carboxylates.9
Within this paper, we applied ssNMR spectroscopy complementing the traditional structural description of polycrystalline solids based on Rietveld refinement of XRPD data28 in order to characterize the crystal structure of mixed lead carboxylates consisting of both hexadecanoate (C16) and octadecanoate (C18) anions in one structure. In addition, we demonstrate the formation of mixed lead soap in a model experiment simulating a historic paint layer.
Experimental section
Synthesis of lead carboxylates
All lead carboxylates of the theoretical composition given in Table 1 were prepared in powder form. We used two different synthesis procedures adapted from those reported by Plater et al.14 and Hermans et al.19 and described in detail by Švarcová et al.20 While the synthesis based on the precipitation of reactants in water–ethanol–methanol solvents was sufficient for the preparation of simple lead carboxylates (i.e., x = 0; 2)14 it was not successful for the preparation of phase pure mixed lead carboxylates, providing co-precipitated mixed and simple lead carboxylates in one batch. Mixed lead carboxylates were thus prepared via the conversion of both carboxylic acids into soluble trimethylamine salts, allowing the precipitation of phase pure products. All the procedures were carried out under argon stream to avoid the co-precipitation of lead carbonates from CO2 reacting with Pb2+ in solutions. Because of the saponaceous and slimy consistency of precipitated products causing the incorporation of a significant amount of the supernatant in droplets immersed by the precipitate mass, thorough purification based on repeated decantation and re-dispersion was necessary.

Analysis of lead carboxylates
Elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen was performed with a Thermo Scientific FlashSmart™ 2000 Elemental analyzer (United States). Lead octadecanoate was used as the standard compound for the calibration of the instrument. Details of analysis are given in the ESI.† The calorimetric experiments were performed on a differential scanning calorimeter PerkinElmer DSC 8000 in the temperature range 50 °C–120 °C. The sample was hermetically closed in a 30 μl aluminum pan, the heating/cooling rate was 2 K min−1, and the sample holder was purged by nitrogen. Pyris Software (Version 13.1.1, PerkinElmer Instruments, 2015) was used for control and evaluation.
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and crystal structure refinement
Synthesised lead carboxylates were characterised by XRPD in the transmission mode. Powders were gently dispersed between two mylar foils in a transmission sample holder. Diffraction patterns were collected using the PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a conventional X-ray tube (CuKα 40 kV, 30 mA, line focus). An elliptic focusing mirror, 0.5° divergence slit, 0.5° anti-scatter slit and 0.02 rad Soller slit were used in the primary beam. A fast linear position sensitive detector PIXcel with an anti-scatter shield and a Soller slit of 0.02 rad were used in the diffracted beam. All patterns were collected in the range of 1 to 80° 2Θ with a step of 0.013° and 500 s per step. Qualitative analysis was performed with HighScorePlus software package (PANalytical, The Netherlands, version 4.8.0), and JCPDS PDF-4 database.29 Rietveld refinement of lead carboxylates was performed in JANA2006 software.30 For all the crystal structures of the prepared mixed lead-carboxylates the initial model was taken from the crystal structure of Pb(C18)2 (CSD's ref. code PAXPIQ)10 and the refinement procedure was identical for all samples and it is described in detail in the ESI.† The sample of model tempera paint was measured using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a conventional X-ray tube (CoKα 40 kV, 30 mA, line focus). The details of the measurement are given in the ESI.†
Solid state NMR spectroscopy (ssNMR)
Solid-state NMR spectra were recorded at 11.7 T using a Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 WB/US NMR spectrometer. The 4 mm cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) probe was used for 13C and 207Pb experiments at Larmor frequencies of ν(13C) = 125.783 MHz and ν(207Pb) = 104.609 MHz, respectively. The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 10 kHz spinning speed and 207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR (using direct excitation) under static conditions. The 13C NMR isotropic chemical shift was calibrated using α-glycine (176.03 ppm; carbonyl signal) as the external standard. The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a recycle delay of 5 s. The number of scans was 1024 at 1 ms spin lock. The 207Pb NMR spectra were recorded using the 207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR experiments31 as a one-piece spectrum. The offset was 104.463 MHz (O1 = −178 kHz) and the recycle delay was 7 s for all 207Pb NMR spectra. The 50 μs CT-selective WURST pulse32,33 using a 500 kHz sweep width with 75 loops was used. The number of scans was set to 6144 for each spectrum. The applied experimental parameters were adapted from literature data and tested on lead hexadecanoate.9 High-power 1H decoupling (SPINAL64 for MAS experiments and CW for static experiments) was used to eliminate heteronuclear dipolar couplings in all measurements. The 207Pb NMR spectra were referenced to the external standard Pb(NO3)2 (−3474 ppm).34 The NMR experiments were performed at a temperature of 303 K, and temperature calibration was performed to compensate for the frictional heating of the samples.35 The all NMR spectra were processed and simulated using the Top Spin 3.5 pl7 software package.
Model tempera paint
The sample of model tempera paint was prepared by mixing lead–tin yellow type I pigment (Pb2SnO4; Kremer Pigmente) with the emulsion binder in the 3:1 weight ratio. The emulsion binder was prepared according the formula reported by Robert Massey36 (p. 69) by mixing 1 part of egg yolk with 1 part of linseed oil (Kremer Pigmente) and 1 part of distilled water. The mixture was put into a plastic vial, closed and placed in a laboratory shaker and left to react under constant shaking (shaking speed 150 per minute) for 6 months. The mixture was stirred and a few drops were applied on a microscope slide in a thin layer.
The prepared film was measured by XRPD. Details of the measurement are given in the ESI.† XRPD patterns were corrected for sample displacement error. Qualitative analysis was performed using HighScorePlus software package (4.8.0) and JCPDS PDF-4 database.29 Positions of the maxima of diffraction lines were determined by the “Profile Fitting” procedure. The observed background was determined manually. A pseudo Voigt approximation function was used for the description of all the profiles with the “split width and shape” option that are highly asymmetric due to axial divergence, Lorentz and polarization factors at very low 2Θ angles.
Results and discussion
Phase composition of mixed lead carboxylates
The purity of the reported synthesized compounds was verified by a combination of elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results of elemental analysis are in a good agreement with the nominal theoretical composition of the prepared mixed lead carboxylates (Table 2). Results of XRPD (Fig. 1 and Fig. S7–S13 in the ESI†) as well as DSC confirmed the phase purity of the synthesized mixed lead carboxylates.

From the XRPD patterns of investigated lead carboxylates shown in Fig. 1, it is apparent that mixed lead carboxylates are distinguishable by the inspection of positions of basal diffraction lines indexed as h00. In comparison with Raman spectroscopy, XRPD enables the unambiguous differentiation of mixed lead carboxylates from the physical mixture of the corresponding composition (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI†). Unfortunately, we found that Raman spectra of lead carboxylates are almost identical with just two slight differences in the bands attributed to CH2 bending (in the region 1500–1400 cm−1) and C–C stretching vibrations (around 1100 cm−1), however, both these signals are very weak and their use for distinguishing of the particular carboxylates is rather questionable especially in complicated mixtures consisting of other components such as pigments and binders which are typical of paint layers (Fig. S1†).

Fig. 2 illustrates the different thermal properties of the mixed lead carboxylate of the composition Pb(C16)(C18) and the physical mixture of Pb(C16)2 and Pb(C18)2 mixed in the corresponding ratio 1:1. Obviously, the DSC curves differ for the mixed crystal and the physical mixture of both individual carboxylates. The DSC curve of Pb(C16)(C18) demonstrates similar thermal behavior as was reported by Martínez-Casado10 for simple long-chain carboxylates, exhibiting two peaks for heating and other two for cooling. According to the reported data,10 the peaks during heating can be attributed to the transition from crystalline solid phase (SII) to intermediate solid phase (SI) and from SI to isotropic liquid phase (IL), respectively, while during cooling the peaks correspond to reverse transitions. For Pb(C16)(C18), we found the temperatures of SII-SI and SI-IL transitions to be 98.5 °C and 107.1 °C, respectively, which are lower than those reported for simple Pb(C16)2 and also the temperature range of the existence of the SI rotator phase is slightly broader than that for simple lead hexadecanoate or octadecanoate which could be interesting with regard to the significant increase in the electrical conductivity observed in rotator SI phases of long-chain carboxylates.10
 Fig. 2  DSC curves of the mixed lead carboxylate Pb(C16)(C18) (top) and the mixture of Pb(C16)2 and Pb(C18)2 in the ratio 1:1 (bottom). 
The DSC curve for the two phase mixture consisting of Pb(C16)2 and Pb(C18)2 is rather different. Instead of 2 sets of 2 peaks related to the aforementioned transitions for both particular compounds, only two peaks were detected for heating. While the first peak can be clearly attributed to the SII–SI transition of Pb(16)2, the more intense second one can be assigned to the coincident SI–IL transition of Pb(C16)2 and SII–SI transition of Pb(C18)2 since the reported temperatures of both transitions are very close (111.9 and 110.5 °C, resp.).10 The absence of the peak corresponding to SI–IL transition of Pb(C18)2 is probably caused by the dissolution of Pb(C18)2 in melted heaxadecanoate. During cooling we detected three peaks (one of them doubled) instead of two, indicating some additional rearrangement of the crystal phase resulting from the reaction of both carboxylates. XRPD proved that after heating and subsequent cooling, both the mixed crystal as well as the physical mixture resulted in mixed crystals of corresponding compositions. For a more detailed description of the transitions, temperature-depending XRD measurement would be beneficial, however, such a study is beyond the scope of the present paper.
Crystal structure and structural disorder

Interpretation of the Rietveld refinement. 
Rietveld refinement of mixed lead carboxylates confirmed the continuous change of the unit cell's volume with the changing ratio between hexadecanoate and octadecanoate in the crystal structure. The most affected parameter is the unit cell parameter a, which increases with an increasing amount of octadecanoate and its value lies in the range aPb(C16)2 < a < aPb(C18)2 (Table 3). In all cases the crystal structures of mixed lead carboxylates are derived from the crystal structures of Pb(C16)2 and Pb(C18)210 that crystallize in P2/c and are highly similar to each other and differ mostly in the length of the aliphatic chains. The asymmetric unit in all mixed lead carboxylates Pb(C16)2−x(C18)x consists of one lead atom and two independent carboxylate molecules. The lead atom is coordinated by oxygen atoms in a slightly distorted octahedron forming the holo-directed coordination as illustrated by the asymmetric part of the unit cell of the representative Pb(C16)0.5(C18)1.5 in Fig. 3. The arrangement of aliphatic chains shows a lamellar structure that forms a 2D coordination polymer perpendicular to the a axis.
 Fig. 3  Asymmetric part of the unit cell of the representative mixed lead carboxylate Pb(C16)0.5(C18)1.5 contains one lead atom and two molecules of octadecanoates. Some of the oxygen atoms coordinating the lead atom are symmetrically equivalent; their symmetrical keys are i: x, 1 + y, z; ii: x, 1 − y, −1/2 + z; iii: x, 2 − y, −1/2 + z. The ethyl ends of both octadecanoates were refined as disorders (atoms C17 and C18 belong to the disordered site A and atoms C35 and C36 belong to the disordered site B) and their occupancy in this case is 0.993(9) and 0.568(9) for site A and site B, respectively.

The harmonic ADP parameter of lead is extremely elongated in the a direction. In some cases, it even resulted in unrealistic ellipsoids. The molecular arrangement of hexadecanoate and octadecanoate is identical with the respect to the unit cell expansion and precision of the powder diffraction technique. Since we did not observe additional diffraction of the superstructure, the reasonable explanation for the structural arrangements of hexadecanoate and octadecanoate chains together in one crystal structure is the presence of disorder. The only case where we have observed the additional diffraction peaks was the sample Pb(C16)1.5(C18)0.5. However, these reflections are lying at odd h 0 0 positions (h = 2n + 1) and their integrated intensities were sufficiently explained by the refined crystal structure.
For the refinement of the disorder we decided to use two models: In the first model (i) site occupancies of both disordered ends (disordered sites A and B, Fig. 3) were kept equal. This simulates the situation, where symmetrically substituted lead carboxylates are preferred. In the second model (ii) site occupancies of both disordered ends (disordered sites A and B) were independent. It allows modelling of the possible highly asymmetrically substituted lead carboxylates. Results of both models are summarized in Table 4. Taking into account the estimated errors, both models led to the same values of the overall refined amount of the octadecanoate chains and to the comparable agreement factors.

13C and 207Pb ssNMR spectroscopy of lead carboxylates. 
The 207Pb and 13C solid state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy was used for the investigation of simple and mixed lead carboxylates. The ssNMR spectra of simple lead hexadecanoate (C16), octadecanoate (C18) and their mixed carboxylates with different molar ratios of individual fatty acids were recorded (Table 5). The presence of lead hexadecanoate and/or octadecanoate was confirmed in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 4). The whole set of investigated samples provide almost identical 13C ssNMR spectra. Previously, the differences in the 13C NMR chemical shift (0.5–2 ppm) were detected in the case of simple lead carboxylates at α-carbon (δisoca. 34 ppm). However, these carbon atoms are negligibly affected in our 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra. On the other hand, significant signal broadening and appearance of new signals were observed for carbon atoms corresponding to both methylene bridges (–CH2–) and methyl groups (–CH3) at δiso 25 ppm and 14 ppm, respectively (Fig. 4). Broadening of these signals was observed only in the case of the mixed lead carboxylates. This indicates that some small fraction of the disordered phase is formed at the aliphatic end of the longer fatty acid chains. All the other signals in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the investigated samples have more or less the same NMR parameters (chemical shifts and signal broadenings). This indicates the formation of a compact, probably highly crystalline, structure. Furthermore, the systems Pb(C16)0.5(C18)1.5 and Pb(C16)1.5(C18)0.5 are basically identical. This suggests that comparable structural motifs are formed in both cases. Although 13C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy revealed information on the existence of a disordered phase in the mixed lead carboxylates, additional useful information was extracted from the 207Pb ssNMR spectra.

207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR spectroscopy was used for the investigation of the local environments of lead atoms in simple and mixed lead carboxylates. Using the WURST-CPMG approach under static conditions is necessary in this case, because the combinations of the value of the isotropic chemical shift, span (describing the maximum width of the powder pattern)37 and skew might be able to aid in differentiating between different holo- and hemi-coordination environments. The 207Pb chemical shifts of all signals were defined approximately to be −2100 ± 8 ppm with a relatively small span – Ω = 730 ± 20 ppm and skew – κ = 0.47 ± 0.1. These parameters clearly confirm the holo-directed coordination.9 Interestingly, the simulation of the signal shape has revealed yet another resonance with NMR parameters corresponding to the holo-directed coordination in all cases of the mixed carboxylates. A previous investigation,38 as well as our observations, confirms only one peak for simple lead carboxylates Pb(C16)2 and Pb(C18)2 (Fig. 5) with almost identical NMR parameters (Table 5). On the other hand, the simulation of the signal shape for the mixed lead carboxylates using only one spectral line provides insufficient results (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). It is expected that the formation of mixed lead carboxylates will produce some random distribution of fatty acids connected to the lead atoms. In other words, three different fractions are formed – two with symmetric chains, i.e., lead hexadecanoate and lead octadecanoate, as well as one asymmetrically substituted lead hexadecanoate–octadecanoate fraction. Based on this assumption, a simulation of the investigated 207Pb WURST-CPMG spectra was conducted. NMR parameters corresponding to the simple lead hexadecanoate/octadecanoate line were kept the same (symmetrical substitution, Table 5) while the final line shape was improved by the addition of a second signal. This signal is attributed to the fraction of the asymmetrically substituted lead carboxylate (asymmetrical substitution, Table 5). Furthermore, the presence of two 207Pb NMR resonances in the mixed lead carboxylates was confirmed by deconvolution of the 207Pb MAS NMR spectra conducted for one selected sample (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). The NMR parameters obtained from simulations of the whole series are summarized in Table 5. As in the case of 13C CP/MAS NMR, the systems Pb(C16)0.5(C18)1.5 and Pb(C16)1.5(C18)0.5 provide almost identical 207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR spectra. This indicates that a similar amount of asymmetrically substituted lead carboxylates is formed and, in both cases, the dominant fraction is comprised of symmetrical lead carboxylates. Generally speaking, the presence of the second spectral line (asymmetrical substitution) with similar NMR parameters in the 207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR spectra of mixed lead carboxylates indicates the slightly changed (in bond angles or in bond distances) local structure around lead atoms.

Model tempera paints
The determined crystal structures of mixed lead carboxylates were successfully applied to identify the composition of neo-formed soaps in the model samples simulating the composition of paintings executed by the so-called mixed painting technique in which an egg-oil emulsion binder was used. Emulsion-type binders prefigured the gradual shift from the egg-based tempera technique to the use of drying oils during the 15th century in Europe.40 In the model paint consisting of lead tin yellow and the emulsion of egg yolk and linseed oil, well crystalline neo-formed lead soap corresponding to Pb(C16)(C18) was identified by XRPD (Fig. 6). For the identification of the neo-formed soap we have converted CIF files (obtained from the crystal structure determination of the synthesized phase pure lead carboxylates of interest as described aforetime) into a user database which has been incorporated into the HighScorePlus program, enabling the standard search-match procedure.
 Fig. 6  XRPD pattern of the model paint film prepared from the suspension of Pb2SnO4 (lead tin yellow type I) and emulsion of egg yolk and linseed oil after 6 months of reaction. 
Considering the reported composition of egg yolk41,42 and determined composition of linseed oil by GC-FID (Table S1 in the ESI†), we calculated that the relative ratio of C16:C18 in the used emulsion binder is approximately 2.1:1 (see eqn (1) and (2) in the ESI†). This finding is in good agreement with the previously reported observation of neo-formed mixed lead carboxylates in pure egg yolk tempera and the emulsion of egg yolk and poppy-seed oil mixed with the lead tin yellow pigment.20 Comparing all three egg yolk-based systems (Table 6), obviously, the proportion of stearate anions in mixed lead carboxylates increases with increasing content of stearic acid in the binder, indicating that mixed lead carboxylates are formed from both binders’ fatty components, egg yolk and oil, in the case of emulsions.

Conclusions
A series of seven long chain lead carboxylates of the general formula Pb(C16)2−x(C18)x was prepared in the form of pure polycrystalline powders and structurally investigated. It has been demonstrated that a combination of XRPD and ssNMR spectroscopy (combining UW and MAS NMR experiments) is a robust tool for studying a variety of simple and mixed lead-carboxylates. By Rietveld refinement of the XRPD we have confirmed the continuous change of the unit cell's volume with the changing value of x in the Pb(C16)2−x(C18)x formula. The most affected parameter of the unit cell is parameter a, which is dependent on the amount of C18 in the crystal structure and its value lies in the range aPb(C16)2 < a < aPb(C18)2.
In the case of mixed lead carboxylates, the experimental 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra revealed significant signal broadening and appearance of new signals for carbon atoms corresponding to both methylene bridges (–CH2–) and methyl groups (–CH3) at δiso 25 ppm and 14 ppm, respectively. This indicates that some fraction of the disordered phase is formed at the aliphatic end of the longer fatty acid chains. Furthermore, the presence of the disorder was also simulated by the Rietveld refinement of the XRPD. Two models for the disordered ends were tested – (i) where site occupancies of both disordered ends were kept equal and (ii) where site occupancies of both disordered ends were independent. Both models led to the approximately same results and agreement factors of profile fits. The occupancies of disordered ends are comparable with the original mixing ratios of the mixed lead carboxylates.
Additional structural information was extracted from the 207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR spectra of investigated samples. Two distinct local environments of lead atoms were revealed, corresponding to the symmetrically (hexadecanoate-Pb-hexadecanoate and/or octadecanoate-Pb-octadecanoate) and asymmetrically (hexadecanoate-Pb-octadecanoate) substituted lead carboxylates. Moreover, the 207Pb NMR parameters extracted from the 207Pb WURST-CPMG NMR spectra confirm the formation of the holo-directed structure for both structural motifs.
Combining an advanced analysis of the XRPD with a comparative analysis of NMR parameters the structural models of the mixed lead-carboxylates were described. According to the XRPD and NMR results we concluded that in mixed lead carboxylates Pb(C16)2−x(C18)x both hexadecanoate and octadecanoate chains are present together in one crystal structure. The octadecanoate chain creates statistical disorder at the ethyl end and the lead atom is in the crystal structure coordinated by symmetrical and/or by asymmetrical units with different ratios, reflecting the different mixing ratios of hexadecanoate and octadecanoate fractions.
Using the described structural models, neo-formed crystalline lead soap detected by XRPD in model tempera paint consisting of the lead tin yellow pigment and emulsion binder was identified as a mixed lead carboxylate of the composition Pb(C16)(C18).
