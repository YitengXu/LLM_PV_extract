    , Accepted 3rd September 2021First published on 7th September 2021AbstractAqueous organic redox flow batteries are a promising technology for large-scale energy storage. The stability of the redox active organic molecules is increasingly being recognized as one of the major hurdles. Upon extended flow battery cycling, 7,8-dihydroxyphenazine-2 sulfonic acid (DHPS) undergoes desulfonation and reduction of a phenolic C–O bond to yield a mixture of 7/8-hydroxyphenazine-2-sulfonic acid, as well as hydrogenation of the aromatic ring system. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis of the charged DHPS, its ring-hydrogenated products, and variably substituted hydroxy phenazines has led to the development of a series of dihydroxylated phenazine isomers which provide insight into the effects of substitution pattern on solubility and stability. Seven dihydroxyphenazine (DHP) isomers were synthesized and their solubilities, electrochemical properties, flow battery cycling performance, and degradation pathways have been investigated. Based on theoretical and experimental results, hydroxyl substitution at the 1, 4, 6 and 9 positions yields highly stable derivatives, while substitution at the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions results in unstable derivatives. Flow cells of 1,4- and 1,6-DHPs coupled with ferro/ferricyanide achieved high stabilities, with temporal capacity loss of 0.029 and 0.031% per day, respectively. Decomposition of 1,8- and 2,7-DHPs were found to arise from irreversible hydrogen rearrangement (tautomerization), yielding redox-inactive species. These results provide a detailed understanding of decomposition pathways and mitigation strategies for phenazine-based anolytes, and can provide general design guidelines for the development of stable redox-active organics.
Introduction
Redox Flow Batteries (RFBs) have emerged as a promising energy storage solution that can mitigate the intermittency associated with wind and solar generation, as well as address demand fluctuations within the electrical grid.1 The intrinsic safety of aqueous RFBs, independent tuning of power and energy, and modular scale-up design make them great candidates for grid energy storage.2–4 Among many inorganic3 and non-aqueous RFBs,5,6 aqueous organic RFBs7–9 (AORFBs) possess multiple advantageous features, including earth-abundant resources, versatile functionalization routes, and potential low-cost.
However, considering the long service life required for the RFBs, the chemical and electrochemical stability of the organic active materials have emerged as one of the key challenges associated with AORFBs. In the past several years, various organic molecules have been developed as promising candidates for AORFBs and their capacity decay mechanisms have been studied. For instance, 1,2-benzoquinone-3,5-disulfonic acid (BQDS) catholyte undergoes Michael reaction with water to form 1,2,4,6-tetrahydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid.10–12 Anthraquinones (AQ) are more resistant to Michael reaction and their larger molecular size disfavours crossover through the membrane, though some derivatives are prone to de-oxygenation which results in the formation of redox-inactive dianthrone species.13–15 An isomeric mixture of alloxazine 7/8-carboxylic acid (ACA) pairing with ferro/ferricyanide produces a high-performance RFB. However, the carbonyl carbon in the amide group in ACA is susceptible to hydrolysis, converting the ACA core to redox inactive species.16 Viologen based anolytes, advantageous for working in pH neutral solutions, tend to dimerize and disproportionate at high concentration, though the addition of two quaternary ammonium group helps to suppress these reactions.17,18
Phenazine-based derivatives have recently been reported as promising candidates with high solubility and low capacity decay.19–22 Particularly, 7,8-dihydroxyphenazine-2-sulfonic acid (DHPS) has been utilized as an anolyte with relatively low capacity decay of 0.0195% per cycle and 0.68% per day in 1.4 M DHPS flow battery.19 It is crucial to have a better understanding of the capacity decay mechanism of DHPS in order to further improve its stability through molecular modification. Herein we describe decomposition studies on DHPS under extended cycling and identify its decomposition pathways. A series of dihydroxyphenazine isomers are studied with a combined experimental and theoretical approach that yields a clearer understanding of the decomposition pathways of hydroxylated phenazines and ultimately produces new, highly-stable derivatives which demonstrate 23× improved cycling stability versus DHPS.
Experimental section
General information
All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. Unless otherwise noted, all the reagents and solvents needed for the synthesis of dihydroxyphenazines were used as received from commercial suppliers: 2,5-dimethoxyaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 4-methoxyaniline, nitrobenzene, 1-methoxy-2-nitrobenzene, 1-methoxy-4-nitrobenzene and HBr were obtained from Alfa Aesar, phloroglucinol dihydrate, KOH, glacier acetic acid, sodium methanesulfonate from Acros Organics, NaOH, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone, 1,2-phenylenediamine from Sigma-Aldrich, benzofuroxan, Na2S2O4, toluene, ethanol, methanol, acetone, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, DMSO from commercial vendors available in VWR international and DMSO-d6 and D2O from Cambridge Isotopes. Toluene was purged with nitrogen prior to use. Deionized water was used to prepare the electrolytes and was purged with nitrogen prior to use.

1H and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Oxford 500 MHz spectrometer or Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C and referenced to the residual proteo impurities of the solvent. MS analysis was performed using a 15T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR-MS) (Bruker Solarix) outfitted with a standard electrospray ionization (ESI) interface.
All the electrolyte preparations, electrochemical tests and flow cell tests were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box (PLAS-LABS).
1,6-22 and 2,3-DHP19 have been synthesized using the literature procedures.
Synthesis of 1,3-dihydroxyphenazine
Phloroglucinol dihydrate (16.48 g, 101.6 mmol) was slurried in 100 mL of water, which was then degassed and maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere for the duration of the reaction. Solid KOH (90%, 6.35 g, 101.8 mmol) was added to the slurry which dissolved upon addition of the base. Solid benzofuroxan (13.80 g, 101.4 mmol) was added to the solution of phloroglucinol, which turned dark teal. After 1 ½ hours, 24 mL of THF was added to aid in dissolving the benzofuroxan. After another 2 hours, 14 mL of acetic acid was added to the mixture. This mixture was diluted to a total volume of 250 mL by addition of water and the corresponding precipitate was filtered off and washed with water, yielding 20 grams of crude solids. The crude solid was stirred in 200 mL of acetone and then recollected by filtration. The remaining purple solids were stirred in 85 mL of DMSO for a ca. 15 minute period and then slowly diluted to a final volume of 500 mL by addition of acetone. The precipitate was collected to yield a 1st crop (11.6 g), while the filtrate was concentrated to the DMSO portion and then precipitated by addition of 400 mL of water to yield a 2nd crop of solids that were filtered and washed with water (6.32 g). Both portions still contained an unknown impurity, though the purity of crop 2 was slightly higher. Each crop was carried through the next step as: crop 1 (11.6 g) was slurried in 250 mL of water, then degassed and kept under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solid KOH (90%, 10.6 g, 170.0 mmol) was added and a homogenous solution resulted. Solid Na2S2O4 (85%, 19 g, 92.78 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction. After 4 hours, 16 mL of acetic acid was added, and the mixture was allowed to stir overnight open to air. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with water. The crude solid (10 g) was stirred in 60 mL of DMSO and then slowly diluted with 200 mL of acetone. The precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated to the DMSO portion. This solution was slowly diluted with ∼450 mL of water to precipitate the desired product, which was filtered and washed with water (5.68 g). Final purification was performed by Soxhlet extraction of the solid with 250 mL of acetone for 36 hours which yielded 1.90 g of crystalline material. The remaining acetone solution was dried and the resulting solids stirred in 30 mL of acetone. The slurry was filtered and the solid washed with acetone to yield an additional 0.74 g of material. This entire process was repeated with the crop 2 fraction with a similar ratio of KOH (7.3 g, 117 mmol), Na2S2O4 (10.46 g, 51.08 mmol), and acetic acid (10 mL), and the final Soxhlet step yielded no crystals. The product obtained from this fraction all resulted from drying of the acetone Soxhlet extract, stirring in a small amount of acetone, and collecting the resulting solid by filtration (0.967 g). Total yield from all crops and fractions: 3.61 g, 16.8%. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz): δ 10.65 (s, OH, 1H), 10.62 (s, OH, 1H), 8.18 (dd, JH–H = 10.7 Hz, JH–H = 1.0 Hz, ArH, 1H), 8.07 (dd, JH–H = 10.7 Hz, JH–H = 0.8 Hz, ArH, 1H), 7.85 (td, JH–H = 9.6 Hz, JH–H = 2.0 Hz, ArH, 1H), 7.77 (td, JH–H = 9.5 Hz, JH–H = 1.9 Hz, ArH, 1H), 6.86 (d, JH–H = 2.4 Hz, ArH, 1H), 6.83 (d, JH–H = 2.4 Hz, ArH, 1H). 13C{1H} NMR (DMSO-d6, 125 MHz): δ 160.98, 154.51, 145.32, 145.24, 139.23, 132.96, 130.76, 129.42, 128.31, 105.03, 98.55.

General procedure for the synthesis of 1,4-, 1,8- and 2,7-dihydroxyphenazine
A 250 mL round bottom flask was filled with potassium hydroxide (250 mmol), corresponding aniline derivative (50 mmol), corresponding nitrobenzene derivative (90 mmol) and 40 mL of degassed toluene and the mixture was heated at 90 °C for 16 h. The resulting black color suspension was allowed to cool down to room temperature and the precipitate was collected by decanting the top solution. The precipitate was suspended in 100 mL of distilled water and collected by vacuum filtration. Corresponding dimethoxyphenazine was isolated after washing with water, ethanol and acetone extensively. Dimethoxyphenazine was dried under vacuum and used for the demethylation reaction without further purification. Dimethoxyphenazine was suspended in a mixture of hydrobromic acid (27 equivalents, 48% wt) and glacial acetic acid (113 equivalents) and the suspension was heated at 140 °C for 72 h. After that, the mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature and pH was adjusted to 5 using 0.5 or 5 M NaOH solution. The precipitated dihydroxyphenazine isomer was collected by vacuum filtration and rinsed with plenty of water. The crude dihydroxyphenazine isomer was further purified by column chromatography.

1,4-Dihydroxyphenazine. 
2,5-Dimethoxyaniline (7.6 g, 50 mmol) and nitrobenzene (9.3 mL, 90 mmol) were used for the synthesis of 1,4-dimethoxyphenazine (1.3 g, 12% yield). Hydrobromic acid (17 mL, 0.15 mol, 48% wt) and glacial acetic acid (36 mL, 0.62 mol) were used for the demethylation reaction. The analytically pure 1,4-dihydroxyphenazine was isolated as wine red solid using 5% methanol in ether as the eluent (537 mg, 46% yield). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz): δ 9.68 (s, OH, 2H), 8.27 (m, ArH, 2H), 7.94 (m, ArH, 2H), 7.06 (s, ArH, 2H). 13C{1H} NMR (DMSO-d6, 125 MHz): δ 145.24, 141.15, 135.75, 130.67, 129.29, 110.88. MS (ESI−) m/z: 211.05 (M–H)−.


1,8-Dihydroxyphenazine. 
4-Methoxyaniline (6.2 g, 50 mmol) and 1-methoxy-2-nitrobenzene (11 mL, 90 mmol) were used for the synthesis of 1,8-dimethoxyphenazine (2.2 g, 18% yield). Hydrobromic acid (28 mL, 0.25 mol, 48% wt) and glacial acetic acid (58 mL, 1.0 mol) were used for the demethylation reaction. The analytically pure 1,8-dihydroxyphenazine was isolated as a yellow solid using 2% methanol in ether as the eluent (780 mg, 39% yield). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz): δ 10.85 (s, broad, OH, 1H), 10.25 (s, OH, 1H), 8.08 (d, JH–H = 9.4 Hz, ArH, 1H), 7.66–7.56 (m, ArH, 3H), 7.41 (d, JH–H = 2.7 Hz, ArH, 1H), 7.13 (dd, JH–H = 7.0 Hz, JH–H = 1.6 Hz, ArH, 1H). 13C{1H} NMR (DMSO-d6, 125 MHz): δ 159.19, 152.84, 143.03, 141.82, 139.50, 130.61, 129.64, 126.44, 119.19, 110.39, 107.32. MS (ESI−) m/z: 211.05 (M–H)−.


2,7-Dihydroxyphenazine. 
4-Methoxyaniline (6.2 g, 50 mmol) and 1-methoxy-4-nitrobenzene (13.8 mL, 90 mmol) were used as the reactants for the synthesis of 2,7-dimethoxyphenazine. The crude product was purified by column chromatography and ethyl acetate was used as the eluent. The product was yielded as a yellow solid upon removal of the solvent (2.2 g, 10% yield). Hydrobromic acid (28 mL, 0.25 mol, 48% wt) and glacial acetic acid (58 mL, 1.0 mol) were used for the demethylation reaction. The analytically pure 2,7-dihydroxyphenazine was isolated as a brown solid by rinsing extensively with 5–10% methanol in ether (640 mg, 32% yield). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz): δ 10.56 (s, OH, 2H), 7.98 (d, JH–H = 9.4 Hz, ArH, 2H), 7.50 (dd, JH–H = 9.3 Hz, JH–H = 2.6 Hz, ArH, 2H), 7.28 (d, JH–H = 2.6 Hz, ArH, 2H). 13C{1H} NMR (DMSO-d6, 101 MHz): δ 157.87, 142.70, 139.29, 129.89, 125.74, 107.47. MS (ESI−) m/z: 211.05 (M–H)−.

Synthesis of 1,9-dihydroxyphenazine
The previously reported method was followed for the synthesis of 1,9-dihydroxyphenazine with a slight modification.23 Hydrogen gas was substituted by hydrazine for the conversion of 1,9-dinitrophenazine to 1,9-diaminophenazine.
Determination of solubility
Solubility measurements were performed by adding 1 or 2 M aqueous base in increments to combined DHP isomer with 2 equivalents of base in a sealable plastic tube and vigorously shaking the mixture until only a small amount of suspended solids remained. An aliquot was filtered through a small cotton plug and 50 μL of filtrate was mixed with 50 μL of 1 M sodium methanesulfonate (internal standard) in D2O. 1H NMR was recorded by diluting with D2O and solubility was calculated with respect to internal standard.
DFT calculations
The DFT calculations were performed at hybrid functional (B3LYP) and triple-zeta double polarization function basis set (TZ2P) inbuilt of ADF2020 software package.24 The implicit dielectric continuum (COSMO) model with water as solvent was used for solvation energy calculations. The charge density distribution is based on the coulombic potential derived from the SCF cycle. It should be noted that in the COSMO model, an implicit solvation model considers the solvent as a continuous isotropic medium with an underlying assumption that it can sufficiently represent equivalent properties of the realistic solvation effect.25 Because of the lack of published values for the dielectric properties of 1 M NaOH or 2 M KOH, we adopted the traditional water-based COSMO model. Nevertheless, as the same assumption was made for all molecules that were tested, the trend in predicted tautomerization energy and redox potential should hold. The redox potential was calculated based on change in Gibbs free energy of the respective redox reaction (see ESI Table S3† for full details of the calculation).
Electrochemical tests
CV measurements were performed using a three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon electrode (3 mm diameter), a glassy carbon counter electrode (rod) and a Hg/HgO reference electrode. The electrolytes of 5 mM DHP isomer in 1.0 M NaOH were used. CV data were collected under nitrogen atmosphere using a CH1760D potentiostat (CH Instruments) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
Flow cell test
The flow cell used an interdigitated design with an active area of 10 cm2 with stacked layers of ELAT (Nuvant) and CP-ESA (SGL) or ELAT (Nuvant) and Freudenberg H23 (two layers) electrodes on each side sandwiching a Nafion membrane (NR212). Heat treated (400 °C, 4 h) ELAT and Freudenberg (H23) were used for 0.50 M 1,3-DHP, 0.36 M 1,6-DHP and 0.60 and 1.40 M 1,8-DHP, 0.20 M 1,9- and 0.10 M 2,7-DHP batteries. The NR212 membrane was soaked in 1 M base overnight at room temperature. A Masterflex L/S peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer) was used to circulate the electrolytes through the electrodes at a flow rate of 40 mL min−1. The flow cell was galvanostatically charged/discharged at 20 mA cm−2 at room temperature on an Arbin BT-2000 battery tester (Arbin Instruments) at room temperature between specific voltage limits. To prepare the anolyte, DHP isomer was combined with 2 equivalents of base in either a 1 or 2 M solution of base.

Results and discussion
As reported previously, long-term cycling tests of the phenazine derivative DHPS show gradual capacity loss, equivalent to ∼0.68% per day. Ex situ analysis of charged and discharged forms of DHPS by 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the discharged form was stable indefinitely while the charged form generated new, unidentified decomposition products (Scheme S1 and Fig. S1–S3†).19 We have recently subjected a 1 M DHPS anolyte solution to extended cycling and post-cycling analysis. The results reveal that the charged form of DHPS (H2DHPS) slowly undergoes desulfonation which is, nominally, affected by the basic conditions used in the electrolytes and in a manner similarly described by acid induced desulfonation of quinone derivatives.11 This process is confirmed by the clear formation of 2,3-dihydroxyphenazine (2,3-DHP) observed by 1H NMR analysis and confirmed by NMR comparison of independently synthesized 2,3-DHP.19 More significantly, H2DHPS undergoes deoxygenation and tautomerization (ring hydrogenation) reactions which eventually yield hydrogenated derivatives which are electrochemically inactive, resulting in long-term capacity fade. Deoxygenation can be observed by 1H NMR, wherein new resonances are clearly observed slightly downfield of the original C–H bonds located ortho to the C–O group (Fig. S2†) and hydrogenation is evident from the appearance of a significant number of signals in the 1.5–3.7 ppm region of the spectrum, indicating aliphatic C–H bonds (Fig. S3†). Nominally, the desulfonated product will also form similar deoxygenated/hydrogenated species over time. In an attempt to utilize lower pH to improve stability, DHPS was cycled against ferrocyanide in a buffered Na2HPO4/Na3PO4 electrolyte. While this effectively mitigated desulfonation side-reactions (no 2,3-dihydroxyphenazine was observed), deoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions still occurred (Fig. S4–S6†). The presence of deoxygenated and hydrogenated species was further supported by mass spectrometry, with peaks at 275.01 (7/8-monohydroxyphenazine-2-sulfonic acid, MHPS) and 279.04 (hydrogenated MHPS–H4) with remaining DHPS appearing at 291.01 (Fig. S7†).
To gain insight into the observed reactivity patterns, DFT analysis of the reduced phenazine species and their ring-hydrogenation isomers (tautomers) was performed (see Table S1† for full results). Initial analysis of charged DHPS was performed on H2DHPS2− (Fig. 1), in light of the recent analysis of DHPS which found 3H+/2e− reactivity upon electrochemical reduction.26 Relative to H2DHPS2−, tautomerization to the ring-hydrogenated species DHPS–H22− was found to be thermodynamically downhill by 2.42 kcal mol−1, with subsequent elimination of water to generate MHPS2− being downhill by an additional 2.19 kcal mol−1, providing a clear thermodynamic rationale for the conversion of DHPS to deoxygenated MHPS during cycling. The energetics were found to change slightly depending on which hydroxyl group was protonated, with the other isomer being uphill by 1.04 kcal mol−1 for the initial tautomerization step, but then being downhill by 9.51 kcal mol−1 for the subsequent water elimination step. Notably, tautomers that place the hydrogen atoms on the sulfonated side of the DHPS ring system are also calculated to be thermodynamically favoured (Table S1†), potentially contributing to the observed desulfonation of DHPS and adding additional complexity to the possible decomposition pathways.
 Fig. 1  Calculated free energies for charged DHPS (blue lines), MHPS (orange lines), and MHPS–H2 (green lines) and their thermodynamically favoured tautomers. The initial, charged 5,10-dihydro species is referenced to 0 on the relative free energy scale for H2DHPS2−, H2MHPS2−, and H2–MHPS–H22− and their corresponding tautomers are reported relative to the 5,10-dihydrophenazine species. 
With MHPS retaining redox activity, the thermodynamics of H2MHPS2− tautomerization was probed and as with the tautomerization process observed in H2DHPS2−, tautomerization of H2MHPS2− to yield the analogous ring hydrogenated MHPS–H22− was found to be thermodynamically favored by 5.82 kcal mol−1. With the quinoxaline core retained, MHPS–H22− could still retain redox activity within the DHPS/ferrocyanide flow batteries charging voltage.27,28 The charged H2MHPS–H22− species was again found to be thermodynamically favored to tautomerize to MHPS–H42− by 13.99 kcal mol−1 (with another isomer favored by 1.44 kcal mol−1). The species MHPS–H42− was experimentally confirmed by mass spectrometry. Taken together, these results indicate that this family of charged hydroxylated phenazine derivatives are thermodynamically unstable towards self-hydrogenation, which eventually yields non-cyclable materials. This reactivity is consistent with previous reports on the reactivity of quinoxalines and their proclivity to undergo tautomerization and C–O bond reduction reactions in their reduced forms, and also similar to reactivity reported for amino acid-substituted phenazines.21,29–32
To probe the generality of the self-hydrogenation of hydroxylated phenazines, we next applied the same analysis to dihydroxylated phenazines with the hydroxy groups repositioned in multiple positions of the aromatic ring (Fig. 2b). In contrast to the results observed in DHPS, tautomerization of charged DHP derivatives 1,4-DHP, 1,6-DHP, 1,9-DHP, and 1,3-DHP to yield ring-hydrogenated 1,2- or 3,4-dihydro tautomers was thermodynamically unfavourable by 20.43, 8.61, 8.13, and 7.15 kcal mol−1, respectively (Fig. 3a, see Table S1† for full results). While 1,4-, 1,6-, and 1,9-DHPs had no thermodynamically favoured tautomers, 1,3-DHP was calculated to have 3 tautomers which were thermodynamically favoured by <1 kcal mol−1. Alternatively, DHP derivatives 2,7-DHP, 2,3-DHP, and 1,8-DHP were found to be thermodynamically disposed to tautomerize into the 1,2- or 3,4-dihydro (6,7-dihydro for 1,8-DHP) species by 9.98, 4.71, and 6.32 kcal mol−1, respectively, indicating that the propensity of hydroxylated dihydrophenazines to tautomerize is highly dependent on the location of the hydroxy groups. Generally, repositioning of the hydroxy functional groups from a position para to a central nitrogen to ortho to a central nitrogen could produce phenazine derivatives with improved stability. The promising DFT results of the DHP derivatives motivated a systematic study to explore experimentally how the position of hydroxy functional groups affect their stability and solubility, which are key parameters of an efficient electrolyte. Furthermore, these DHP derivatives which are free of sulfonate groups can simplify post-cycling analysis by minimizing the number of potential decomposition routes and reducing the number of potential isomers formed on decomposition. We also note that our choice of DHP isomers to investigate by DFT analysis was bound to those which we could access synthetically and provide corroborating experimental data.

Solubility was determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy with respect to an internal standard (1 M sodium methanesulfonate). Relative free energies of ring hydrogenated isomers (3,4-dihydro) are reported relative to 5,10-dihydro isomer. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of DHP isomers (individual cyclic voltammograms are given in Fig. S15a†). 
Seven DHP isomers have been investigated experimentally (Fig. 2b) and their detailed preparation methods are given in the experimental section. All DHP isomers have poor solubility in neutral water but demonstrate improved solubility in alkaline water. The solubilities of deprotonated DHPs have been studied in excess NaOH and KOH (Fig. 3a), with 1,6-, 1,9- and 2,7-DHPs demonstrating low solubilities of 0.07, 0.10 and 0.07 M, respectively, in 1 M NaOH. Improved solubility of 0.28 and 0.36 M were observed for 1,3- and 1,4-DHP, whereas impressive solubilities of 1.84 and 1.60 M were obtained with 1,8- and 2,3-DHPs, respectively. Significant improvements in solubility could be realized by changing the base from NaOH to KOH, with 1,3- and 1,6-DHP showing drastic improvements from 0.28 to 1.61 M and 0.07 to 0.60 M, respectively (Fig. 3a and Table S2†). Therefore, solubilities of deprotonated forms of all the DHPs were studied in 2 M KOH. Overall, 1,8- and 2,3-DHPs have outstanding solubilities in both 1 M NaOH and 2 M KOH.
The electrochemical behaviour of the DHP isomers was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3b) to identify the reduction potential for their 2H+/2e− reduction (Fig. S16†). Redox potentials for 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,6-, 1,8-, 1,9-, 2,3- and 2,7-DHP were measured as −0.88, −0.80, −0.98, −1.09, −0.88, −1.14 and −1.04 V, respectively, versus Hg/HgO (determined by the average of their cathodic and anodic peaks). While redox potentials are generally more negative with hydroxy substitution at the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions, this trend does not hold true throughout the series. The ranking of redox potentials for the set of derivatives is generally well predicted by DFT calculation, though the experimental values are slightly more positive than the calculated values (see Table S3† for all electrochemical data). The DHP isomers have large peak to peak separation ranging from 348–673 mV, indicating sluggish kinetics at the glassy carbon electrode with the exception of 2,3-DHP (66 mV peak separation). Analysis of the DHP isomers was performed with RDE and yielded diffusion coefficients and electron transfer rates similar to other reported phenazines (Table S3 and Fig. S17†). Coupled with the ferrocyanide catholyte, the DHP isomers yield theoretical cell voltages of 1.16–1.50 V in a full cell (Table S3†).
Flow battery testing of the DHP anolytes was performed using the well-known ferrocyanide catholyte. Since ferro/ferricyanide has diminished stability in alkaline solutions, excess catholyte was used to reduce its effect on capacity decay and focus on the stability of the DHP isomers.33 The detailed flow cell test methods are given in the experimental section. Initially, RFBs of 1,4-, 1,6- and 2,3-DHPs were performed at 0.065 M in 1 M NaOH (Fig. S18a–c†). At lower concentration, both 1,4- and 1,6-DHP showed 97% and 92% material utilization whereas 86% material utilization for 2,3-DHP (Table S4†), respectively. All three DHP isomers had >99% average coulombic efficiency at 20 mA cm−2. The 1,4- and 2,3-DHPs exhibit >85% average voltage and energy efficiencies while 1,6-DHP cycles at 66% average voltage and energy efficiency. Moderate cycling stability was observed for 1,4- and 1,6-DHP, with 1.6% (capacity decay of 0.00064% per cycle and 0.0432% per day) and 3.8% (capacity decay of 0.00152% per cycle and 0.115% per day) capacity decay over 2500 cycles, respectively.
Compared to the original reported DHPS (which demonstrated decomposition rates of 0.68% per day at 1.4 M and 0.93% per day at 0.1 M in a full cell), the cycling stabilities of the 1,4- and 1,6-DHP improve 16 and 6 times, respectively. Based on post-cycling 1H NMR analysis of the anolytes, material degradation was not evident in either 1,4- or 1,6-DHP (Fig. S19 and S20†). High capacity decay of 13.5% (capacity decay of 0.0054% per cycle and 0.435% per day) was observed with 2,3-DHP and precipitation of material was observed during each charging step (Fig. S18c†). However, the precipitate typically re-dissolved during the discharging step. This process is expected to arise from protonation of one of the oxygens upon phenazine reduction, yielding a poorly-soluble, singly-charged species.26 There is a gradual capacity increase at the beginning of cycling until cycle 307, after which gradual capacity loss was observed. New resonances were observed between 6.59–6.88 and 4.22–1.64 ppm in the 1H NMR of cycled 2,3-DHP (Fig. S21†). A freshly charged sample of 2,3-DHP was monitored ex situ in an NMR tube, and new sets of peaks appeared between 6.95–7.35 and 4.4–1.5 ppm along with the regeneration of discharged 2,3-DHP (Fig. S22–S24†). The presence of aliphatic C–H resonances indicates the hydrogenation of the aromatic rings of 2,3-DHP during flow battery cycling as well as under ex situ thermolytic conditions, indicating chemical reactivity (not electrochemical) as the pathway for material decomposition. The aliphatic region of the 1H NMR of cycled 2,3-DHP shows some of the same resonances observed in cycled DHPS (which are produced after desulfonation) and is consistent with the presence of ring-hydrogenated tautomers analogous to those proposed for DHPS (Fig. S24†). Mass spectrometry indicates the same deoxygenation reactivity in 2,3-DHP as observed in DHPS (Fig. S25†).
The promising cyclability of 1,4- and 1,6-DHPs at low concentration prompted us to study their cyclability at higher concentrations. Flow batteries utilizing 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,6-, 1,8-, 1,9-, and 2,7-DHPs were run at 0.50, 0.42, 0.36, 0.60, 0.20, and 0.10 M in 2 M KOH (given their higher solubilities in KOH relative to NaOH, Fig. 3a) and subjected to simple galvanostatic cycling protocols (Fig. S26†). Their galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profiles from selected cycles at 20 mA cm−2 are given in the Fig. 4. All six isomers have >99% coulombic efficiency even though some isomers undergo significant material decomposition. Average voltage and energy efficiencies of 1,3, 1,4-, 1,6-, 1,8-, and 1,9-DHP isomers are varied around 55–70%, while 2,7-DHP is around 46% (Table S5†). The Nafion N212 membrane used in these cells was only soaked in KOH at room temperature, and alternative pre-treatment methods could improve the voltage efficiency.34 Among the six isomers, 1,3-, 1,4-, and 1,6-DHP have the lowest long-term capacity loss of 3.0% (0.0109% per cycle and 0.176% per day), 3.1% (0.0031% per cycle and 0.029% per day), and 2.6% (0.0106% per cycle and 0.163% per day), respectively, at high concentration (compared to ∼0.68% per day with 1.4 M DHPS and 0.93% per day with 0.1 M DHPS19) (Fig. 5, S26, and Table S5†). Post-cycling analysis of the material revealed only minor decomposition products of both 1,4- and 1,6-DHPs even at high concentrations (Fig. S28 and S29†), in agreement with the DFT data. The observed capacity decay could also be due, in part, to the various sources of increased resistance in the system, which will result in a reduction in electrolyte utilization.35,36 To eliminate these effects on material utilization, galvanostatic cycling followed by a potentiostatic hold (1.5 V after charge and 0.9 V after discharge) was performed until the current density dropped to 2 mA cm−2 after every 50th galvanostatic cycle. This cycling protocol was applied to 0.50 M 1,3- and 1,6-DHP flow batteries, which demonstrated 1.3% overall capacity decay (0.00634% per cycle and 0.10% per day) and 1.1% overall capacity decay (0.00158% per cycle and 0.031% per day), respectively (Fig. S30, S31, Tables S6 and S7†). The low temporal capacity fade of 1,4- and 1,6-DHP is a 23× improvement over the previously reported DHPS. This is within a factor of 16 of the most stable anthraquinone-based anolyte (DPivOHAQ)37 reported to date and is among the most stable phenazine-based anolytes reported to date21,38 (to our knowledge) (see Table S8† for comparison). It is challenging to perform a similar galvanostatic/potentiostatic hold protocol for the 1,4-DHP isomer due to the presence of a quasi-irreversible oxidation of the 1,4-hydroxyl moiety that is relatively close to the phenazine reoxidation potential (Fig. S32†). Similar to 1,4- and 1,6-DHP, 1,9-DHP demonstrated modest capacity decay of 20.2% (0.0063% per cycle and 0.404% per day) but did not yield major decomposition products by 1H NMR (Fig. S26e, S33 and Table S5†). Thermolysis of charged 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,6-DHP and 1,9-DHP anolytes was also carried out ex situ in a sealed NMR tube, with the temperature being periodically raised from 50 to 75 to 95 °C (Fig. S34–S37†). Precipitation began at 75 °C and persisted through the 95 °C test with 1,4-, 1,6-, and 1,9-DHPs, though the NMR spectra of the remaining solutions were the same as the charged anolyte at room temperature and 50 °C. Unfortunately, this precipitation precludes the determination of a chemical decomposition rate from ex situ NMR thermolysis studies. Although ex situ results indicated promising stability of 1,9-DHP, its poor solubility did not motivate further investigation. During 1,3-DHP thermolysis at 75 °C and higher, formation of trace amounts of ring-hydrogenated tautomers were observed (new resonances between 7.23–6.95 and 2.84–2.25 ppm) which is in agreement with DFT calculations (Fig. S34 and Table S1†).
 Fig. 4  Galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profiles from selected cycles at 20 mA cm−2. (a) 0.50 M 1,3-DHP, (b) 0.42 M 1,4-DHP, (c) 0.36 M 1,6-DHP, (d) 0.60 M 1,8-DHP, (e) 0.20 M 1,9-DHP, (f) 0.10 M 2,7-DHP. 
Considering the results from DFT, we expected poorer stability in derivatives that incorporate hydroxyl groups at the 2, 3, 7, or 8 positions of the phenazine ring system. Indeed, significant capacity decay of 37.3% and 89.2% was observed in 1,8- and 2,7-DHP, respectively, with most of this capacity loss occurring in the first few cycles (Fig. 5, S26d, f, and Table S5†). With 1,8-DHP, 33.4% of the capacity was lost during the first 18 cycles (within ∼34 h, zoomed in view of first 50 cycles of 0.60 M 1,8-DHP is provided in Fig. S38†), while with 2,7-DHP 77.3% of capacity was lost during the first 225 cycles (within ∼18 h). 1H NMR analysis of cycled anolyte of both 1,8- and 2,7-DHPs revealed the formation of new species with hydrogenated C–C bonds (indicated by the presence of aliphatic C–H resonances). The decomposition product from 2,7-DHP was readily identified as 3,4-dihydro-2,7-dihydroxyphenazine (3,4-DH-2,7-DHP), with the newly hydrogenated bond showing tell-tale triplets by 1H NMR (Fig. S39 and S40†). Similar decomposition products were reported with 1,8- and 2,7-substituted amino acid functionalized phenazines.21
Degradation rates of dihydroxyphenazine isomers are compared in Fig. 5. High and similar capacity retention was observed for 1,3-, 1,4- and 1,6-DHPs, though 1,4-DHP is notable for its long cycling duration. While 1,4-DHP showed similar capacity loss to 1,3- and 1,6-DHP over the first 15 days, the capacity stabilized for much of the remaining cycling period, suggesting some of the initial capacity loss could be due to other factors which diminished material utilization. We note that tests were not performed at identical concentrations, which should be considered when directly comparing derivatives. Tests were run predominately at near-saturation concentrations to observe decomposition rates at the most realistic condition each derivative could achieve.
 Fig. 5  Capacity retention of dihydroxyphenazine isomers. Capacity retention rates were calculated based on charge capacity of high concentration flow batteries of DHPs. Number of data points in 1,3-, 1,4-, and 1,6-DHP traces were reduced to avoid overlapping. 
In contrast to the decomposition observed with 2,7-DHP and the reported amino acid functionalized phenazines, 1,8-DHP showed stable cycling after rapid, initial capacity loss of 33.4% over the first 18 cycles (34 hours). Between cycles 100 and 1200 (a 78.5 day period), the cell experienced additional capacity loss of only 0.043% per day, prompting further study of its decomposition pathways. Another battery was set up with 0.60 M 1,8-DHP and aliquots of anolyte were collected in discharged and charged form after cycle 1, 3, 12, 15 and 34, and analyzed by 1H NMR (Fig. 6, S41 and S42†). As seen in Fig. 6, it is evident that decomposition starts from cycle 1 and the amount of the product increases with cycling. Based on 1H NMR, the anolyte consists of about 40% of partially hydrogenated 1,8-DHP along with 60% charged 1,8-DHP after charging at cycle 34 and similar ratios between hydrogenated 1,8-DHP and discharged 1,8-DHP were obtained during discharging steps as well (Tables S9 and S10†). According to RFB data, only 55% of 1,8-DHP charged during cycle 34, consistent with the 1H NMR data. 1H NMR analysis identified redox-inactive 6,7-dihydro-1,8-dihydroxyphenazine (DHDHP) (Fig. S43†) as the decomposition product. Two triplets at 2.51 and 3.05 ppm correspond to the methylene protons at the 6 and 7 positions, two doublets at 6.67 and 6.86 ppm arise from the protons at the 2 and 4 positions, and a triplet at 7.19 ppm arises from the proton at the 3 position. The resonance of the hydrogen at the 9 position doesn't appear in 1H NMR in D2O, likely due to deuterium exchange with D2O resulting from keto–enol tautomerization.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of 1H NMR spectra of anolyte from 0.60 M 1,8-DHP RFB. Uncycled anolyte is compared with charged anolyte of cycle 1, 3, 12, 15 and 34 in D2O. Tautomerized product is labelled with red asterisks. 
The formation of 6,7-dihydro-1,8-dihydroxyphenazine (DHDHP) from charged 1,8-DHP was also supported by DFT analysis, with DHDHP showing the lowest energy among other possible tautomers and calculated to be more stable than 5,10-dihydro-1,8-dihydroxyphenazine (charged 1,8-DHP) by 6.32 kcal mol−1 (Table S1†).
Further NMR studies were carried out to determine if the decomposition was occurring chemically or as an electrochemical side reaction at the electrode surface. A freshly charged electrolyte sample of 0.6 M 1,8-DHP was placed in a sealed NMR tube and monitored over the course of 25 days, with a focus on data collection over the first 3 days of the reaction. Plotting the consumption of charged 1,8-DHP generated a nearly identical trace as the plot of capacity retention in a flow cell (Fig. S44†), indicating the conversion of charged 1,8-DHP to DHDHP via a chemical reaction (vs. electrochemical) (Scheme 1).29 Given the nearly 1:1 ratio reached at equilibrium, the observed free energy of the tautomerization reaction would be quite close to zero. The disparity with the DFT predicted tautomerization energy could be due to the more complex electrolyte in the cell (high pH, other ions, altered solvent dielectric, etc.) relative to the simpler implicit solvation model used by the ADF program.
 Scheme 1  Proposed degradation pathways for 1,8-DHP. 
Post-cycling analysis of discharged anolyte from a RFB run at high concentration (1.4 M 1,8-DHP) revealed the presence of more than one decomposed product (Fig. S45 and S46†). Additional DFT analysis of extensively hydrogenated by-products suggested that the second product could be 5,5a,6,7-tetrahydro-1,8-dihydroxyphenazine (THDHP). Clean and nearly full conversion of 1,8-DHP to THDHP was observed while attempting to synthesize DHDHP electrochemically (subjecting a 1,8-DHP/ferrocyanide flow cell to a 1.8 V potentiostatic hold, Fig. S47†). The assigned structure for THDHP was consistent with the obtained 1H NMR of the electrochemically synthesized material (Fig. S48†) and further confirmed by mass spectrometry. Based on DFT calculations, the disproportionation of 2 equivalents of charged 1,8-DHP to yield discharged 1,8-DHP and THDHP is downhill by 33.97 kcal mol−1 (Scheme 1). This reaction may actually proceed through any number of avenues, including the disproportionation of 2 equivalents of DHDHP (−21.33 kcal mol−1) or via the reaction of charged 1,8-DHP with DHDHP (−27.65 kcal mol−1, though the net reaction free energy is, of course, equivalent in all cases after considering the −6.32 kcal mol−1 tautomerization energy). The generation of a higher concentration of DHDHP in the 1.4 M flow battery compared to the 0.6 M flow battery may facilitate the bimolecular reaction between charged 1,8-DHP and/or DHDHP (Scheme 1). Moreover, the rapid and complete formation of THDHP under a high voltage potentiostatic hold in a 0.6 M flow cell indicates the added possibility of an electrochemical contribution at high applied voltage.
Conclusions
We have identified that desulfonation, deoxygenation and hydrogenation of the phenazine core as possible pathways for the decomposition of DHPS under flow battery conditions. Self-hydrogenation of the charged phenazine core (tautomerization) was identified as the primary driver for hydroxyphenazines decomposition under flow cycling conditions. Degradation mechanisms observed experimentally for both DHPS and DHPs were further supported by DFT calculations. A series of dihydroxyphenazines were synthesized and we have also shown that location of hydroxyl groups on the phenazine core has significant influence on their physical, chemical and electrochemical behaviours. When at least one hydroxyl group locates at the 2, 3, 7 or 8 positions, they tend to have impressive solubilities (except in the case of 2,7-DHP, where the molecular symmetry may lead to low solubility). For example, 1,3-, 1,8- and 2,3-DHPs have solubilities of 1.61, 1.90 and 1.94 M in 2 M KOH respectively. Among all the DHPs, isomers with hydroxyl groups at the 1, 4, 6 or 9 positions show notable cycling stability with minimal material decomposition. At high concentration, 1,6-, 1,3- and 1,4-DHP demonstrate low capacity decay of 1.1% (0.00158% per cycle and 0.031% per day), 1.3% (0.00634% per cycle and 0.10% per day) and 3.1% (0.0031% per cycle and 0.029% per day), respectively. DHP isomers with at least one hydroxyl group at the 2, 3, 7 or 8 positions suffer from material decomposition. A mixture of these general substitution criteria in 1,3-DHP and 1,8-DHP results in intermediate stabilities. For instance, 1,3-DHP shows drastically improved stability vs. 2,7- or 2,3-DHP, and 1,8-DHP demonstrates less decomposition than 2,7-DHP under battery cycling. These outcomes suggest that the inclusion of hydroxyl groups at the 2, 3, 7, or 8 positions may not be completely impractical, since the incorporation of hydroxyl groups elsewhere in the molecule can modulate the free energy difference between the desired 5,10-dihydro derivatives and their redox-inactive tautomers. Detailed investigation of 1,8-DHP degradation revealed that charged 1,8-DHP undergoes tautomerization to form an approximately 1:1 equilibrium mixture with redox inactive 6,7-dihydro-1,8-dihydroxyphenazine (DHDHP). At high concentration, formation of 5,5a,6,7-tetrahydro-1,8-dihydroxyphenazine (THDHP) was also evident along with DHDHP. Overall, this systematic study helps us to identify stability and solubility outcomes from varied hydroxy substitution patterns on the phenazine core and can guide further improvement of phenazine-based anolytes.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Calculated free energies for charged DHPS (blue lines), MHPS (orange lines), and MHPS–H2 (green lines) and their thermodynamically favoured tautomers. The initial, charged 5,10-dihydro species is referenced to 0 on the relative free energy scale for H2DHPS2−, H2MHPS2−, and H2–MHPS–H22− and their corresponding tautomers are reported relative to the 5,10-dihydrophenazine species.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Generic electrochemistry and tautomerization of hydroxyphenazine. (b) DHP isomers and numbering scheme of phenazine core.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Solubility data for DHP isomers in both 1 M NaOH and 2 M KOH, and tautomerization energy of 3,4-dihydro isomer (1,2-dihydro for 1,3-DHP and 6,7-dihydro for 1,8-DHP). Solubility was determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy with respect to an internal standard (1 M sodium methanesulfonate). Relative free energies of ring hydrogenated isomers (3,4-dihydro) are reported relative to 5,10-dihydro isomer. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of DHP isomers (individual cyclic voltammograms are given in Fig. S15a†).	 

 	Fig. 4  Galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profiles from selected cycles at 20 mA cm−2. (a) 0.50 M 1,3-DHP, (b) 0.42 M 1,4-DHP, (c) 0.36 M 1,6-DHP, (d) 0.60 M 1,8-DHP, (e) 0.20 M 1,9-DHP, (f) 0.10 M 2,7-DHP.	 

 	Fig. 5  Capacity retention of dihydroxyphenazine isomers. Capacity retention rates were calculated based on charge capacity of high concentration flow batteries of DHPs. Number of data points in 1,3-, 1,4-, and 1,6-DHP traces were reduced to avoid overlapping.	 

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of 1H NMR spectra of anolyte from 0.60 M 1,8-DHP RFB. Uncycled anolyte is compared with charged anolyte of cycle 1, 3, 12, 15 and 34 in D2O. Tautomerized product is labelled with red asterisks.	 

 	Scheme 1  Proposed degradation pathways for 1,8-DHP.
