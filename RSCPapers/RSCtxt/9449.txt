    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 18th April 2017AbstractPhotovoltaic devices made of ferroelectric films are being widely studied, due to their efficient charge separation driven by the internal polarization as well as above-bandgap generated photovoltages. These features may enable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit, which characterizes conventional semiconductor-based solar cells. However, improving the PCE of such devices is still a challenge, mainly due to the weak charge transport and collection induced by the recombination of photocarriers. Here, we fabricated p–i–n heterojunction devices based on double-perovskite multiferroic Bi2FeCrO6 thin films. The latter act as intrinsic absorbers, sandwiched between hole- and electron-transporting layers, a p-type NiO and an n-type Nb-doped SrTiO3 semiconductor, respectively. Under 1 sun illumination, the optimized p–i–n device yields an open-circuit voltage of 0.53 V and a short-circuit current density of 8.0 mA cm−2, leading to a PCE of ca. 2.0%, a four-fold enhancement compared to that of the i–n device architecture.
Introduction
Ferroelectric (FE) systems have been recently explored as alternative materials for use in photovoltaic (PV) devices.1–5 In these non-centrosymmetric systems, the low inversion symmetry state with spontaneous electric polarization induced by FE dipoles5 enhances the separation of photo-excited carriers and allows the generation of photovoltages larger than the bandgap. This enables power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit, a well-established concept in conventional semiconductor p–n junction solar cells.3,6–8 Since the discovery of the bulk PV effect in these materials,9 FE solar cells (FESCs) have been studied intensively due to several unique advantages including their distinct photoelectric conversion capability, large photo-generated voltage, and the regulation of the electric field.4,10 This technology involves a simplified device architecture and low cost fabrication methods as well as chemically stable and earth-abundant starting materials.11
In FESCs, the FE polarization plays a dominant role in charge carrier separation and transport. This mechanism is different from that underlying charge separation in p–n diode or Schottky diode PV devices, which is heavily determined by the intrinsic built-in electric fields.11–13 FESCs provide reversible directions for the photocurrent and photovoltage by switching the polarization direction and may also generate photovoltages which can exceed the material's bandgap.14
While for a long time such devices exhibited performances, recent advances led to significant breakthroughs by using multiferroic materials as opposed to FEs.5,11,12,15–19 Multiferroics combine two ferroic functionalities (specifically FE, ferromagnetic or ferroelastic), and typically possess a magnetic order parameter in addition to the FE one. In these materials, the electron–electron interaction regulating the magnetic ordering induces a smaller gap15 (e.g. 2.6–2.7 eV for BiFeO3 (BFO)20 and 1.4–2.4 eV for Bi2FeCrO6 (BFCO)18) compared to other FEs (e.g., 3.2–3.6 eV for La-doped Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PLZT)21). Among these multiferroics, double-perovskite BFCO is highly promising for spintronics and PV applications15,22 due to its relatively narrow band gap,18 large remnant polarization (ca. 55 μC cm−2 along the [001] pseudocubic direction),23 and a magnetization of ca.160 emu cm−3 (2μB per formula unit).24
Recently, Nechache et al.18 reported BFCO single-layer based PV devices exhibiting both a small bandgap (1.2–1.6 eV) and large photocurrent density (11.7 mA cm−2) with a PCE of up to 3.3% from single layer films and a record PCE of 8.1% from multilayer films under 1.5 AM illumination. This study also suggested that the optimal combination of optical and ferroelectric properties is a promising strategy to obtain highly efficient multiferroic PV devices. For this material, a low bandgap and a large FE polarization promote effective charge carrier generation and separation. BFCO with a high degree of Fe/Cr cation ordering showed a low band gap (1.2–1.6 eV) accompanied by a weak ferroelectric polarization (ca.15 μC cm−2), exhibiting therefore an intrinsic semiconducting behavior.18 Despite a large absorption of visible light by these films, their weak FE polarization induces an internal electric field resulting in a low separation power of photogenerated carriers and high recombination losses, thus being detrimental for device performance. These results suggest a relationship between the optical properties, ferroelectricity and crystal structure in BFCO films.1
On the other hand, it is known that the photo-generated voltages in FE materials can exceed their band gaps, due to the summation of series voltages across each nanometer-scale FE domain separated by domain walls.7 However, in photodiodes and PV devices, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is typically 0.3–0.5 V less than their band gaps.19,25 The hypothesized reason for the loss in VOC in these devices, aside from the driven-force nature of separation of hole–electron pairs, is the presence of a dark current and Schottky barriers formed at interfaces.26
A potential approach to improve PV performance would then be to reduce these photovoltage losses. An effective electron-blocking layer (EBL)/hole-transporting layer (HTL) could achieve this goal by hindering current leakage and the consequent counter diode formation.27 This involves the design of a new type of structure, specifically a p–i–n heterojunction, together with a suitable device architecture. In this p–i–n junction, the multiferroic BFCO film acting as an intrinsic absorber layer is sandwiched between two p- and n-type semiconductor oxides acting as an EBL/HTL and electron-transporting layer (ETL) respectively. The device is designed such that the p–i and i–n depletion regions are connected, resulting in the formation of an internal electric field across the entire BFCO layer. When this p–i–n structure is illuminated, a VOC and a short-circuit current (ISC) are generated due to the separation of photogenerated charge carriers by the internal electric field.
In this work, we report the successful fabrication of a photovoltaic p–i–n heterostructure device as described above. We used multiferroic BFCO as an intrinsic absorber and NiO, a cubic wide band-gap semiconductor (ca. 3.6 eV),28 as a HTL. The latter, which is essentially transparent in the form of very thin layers (e.g. ca. 70% of transmittance in the visible range with ca. 10 nm of thickness28), has a p-type conduction.29,30 We show that its band structure is well fitted to that of BFCO, i.e. NiO has an adequately high conduction band minimum to function as an EBL. As an ETL we used Nb-doped SrTiO3 (NSTO), which is a perovskite with a typical n-type semiconductor behavior, has a large band gap of ca. 3.2 eV, a low electrical resistivity (e.g. ca. 10−4 Ω cm)31 and a small lattice mismatch (ca. 0.64%) with a double-perovskite BFCO film, to promote epitaxial growth.15
Results and discussion
Characterization of films

Structural characterization of BFCO films. 
The epitaxial growth of BFCO films on perovskite NSTO substrates is expected to result in high crystalline quality with smooth interfaces. We characterized and compared the crystallographic structure and phase of BFCO films grown on NSTO under different growth conditions. As shown in Fig. 1a, only the 00l (l = 1, 2, 3) pseudocubic reflections of the BFCO film and (001)-oriented NSTO substrate are visible, confirming the c-axis orientation of the oxide heterostructure and a good crystallization of BFCO phases, yielding a BFCO c-axis lattice parameter of ca. 3.976 Å for BFCO #1 and ca. 3.970 Å for BFCO #2. The Fe/Cr cationic ordering in the BFCO films was evidenced by performing asymmetrical θ–2θ scans around the (111) NSTO reflections,24 as depicted in Fig. 1b. In addition to the main single perovskite (111) reflection (ca. 39.7°), periodic peaks at 2θ = ca. 19.5 and ca. 61.2° were observed indicating the doubling of the BFCO unit cell due to Fe/Cr cationic ordering along this crystal direction, as predicted by theoretical calculations.32 To quantify the degree of Fe/Cr cationic ordering (R), we carried out a detailed analysis of the normalized intensity of the superstructure peaks. R (in %) was estimated from the normalized ratio of the superlattice peak intensity to the main (111) reflection intensity of BFCO in the pseudocubic indexing (Table 1).24 XRD reciprocal space mappings (RSM) of BFCO thin films around the NSTO (204) reflection are illustrated in Fig. 1c and d. The small condensed reciprocal area observed in all figures suggests high quality epitaxial growth of the BFCO thin films on NSTO substrates (i.e. very small mosaicity in crystal plane orientations). The presence of extra spots indicates the presence of two BFCO phases in the films, which we denote as ordered (o-BFCO) and disordered (d-BFCO) phases (cf. Fig. S1†). The positions of the BFCO peaks are located close to that of NSTO along the in-plane reciprocal Qx axis, suggesting that the film and substrate have a similar in-plane lattice parameter. The calculated in-plane lattice parameters of the BFCO films are listed in Table S2,† indicating that the films are under a compressive strain, with a lattice mismatch of 0.2–0.3%. However, since we expect that the BFCO films are fully or at least partially relaxed, the possible presence of multi-state valences for Fe and Cr, in particular the 2+ and 4+ states in the films (demonstrated by XPS analysis cf. Fig. S4a–d†), suggests that the strain is relieved by the Jahn–Teller distortion of oxygen octahedra surrounding these atoms.19 AFM measurements performed on 120 nm-thick BFCO films show that they exhibit a root mean square roughness of ca. 6 nm over an area of 2 × 2 μm2, indicating a relatively smooth surface throughout the film (cf. Fig. S2†). Hence, the high crystallinity and atomically smooth surfaces are both critical for the fabrication of a heteroepitaxial structure with low-density charged defects, which generally behave as recombination sites for electrons and holes resulting in a decline of performance in PV devices.33

Ferroelectric properties of BFCO films. 
In contrast to conventional p–n junction devices, the driving force for the separation of photo-generated carriers in multiferroic-based devices depends on the magnitude of the FE polarization. The FE properties of BFCO films were investigated both at the nano- and macro-scale. PFM experiments showed that the FE domains of both BFCO #1 and BFCO #2 samples can be individually or partially switched by applying ±8 V voltage pulses, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The resulting contrast is clear proof that ferroelectricity in BFCO exists and can be switched upon application of an external voltage. Further evidence of ferroelectric behavior is the presence of hysteresis loops (Fig. 2c and d). BFCO film #1 exhibits a stronger PFM response compared to that of the BFCO #2 film. The FE behavior of our BFCO films was further confirmed by macroscopic measurements (cf.Fig. 2e). The polarization of film #1 (ca. 44 μC cm−2) is observed to be much higher than that of film #2 (ca. 14 μC cm−2). The BFCO #2 film with high R (ca. 0.65%, Table 1) shows a weaker FE polarization than the film BFCO #1 with low R (ca. 0.31%, shown in Table 1). Consequently, the FE polarization driven force for charge carrier separation in film BFCO #1 is considered to be more significant than that in film BFCO #2, resulting in an enhancement of PCE.18

Optical properties of BFCO and NiO films. 
To understand the optical transition mechanism in double-perovskite BFCO films, the optical absorption properties were characterized by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements using a VASE ellipsometer. A multilayer model consisting of air, the BFCO film and the NSTO bottom electrode substrate was used to describe the optical response, including the extinction coefficient k. Fig. 3a displays the absorption coefficient α of different BFCO films. The oscillation of the absorption spectra, which implies two absorption areas from the ordered and disordered domains, is observed in all BFCO samples. The oscillation is more pronounced in BFCO #2 due to the combined effect of a relatively high value of R (∼0.65%) and the large ordered domain size of ∼24 nm. A similar finding was reported in our previous work.18 The optical transition peaks appear mainly between 500 and 700 nm in the absorption spectra for all BFCO films. The coefficient α varies between 0.5 × 105 and 2.0 × 105 cm−1 at 520 nm. In addition, we observed a strong dependence (a factor of ca. 4) of the absorption peak area on the ratio R (Fig. S3†), confirming that Fe/Cr cationic ordering is a crucial parameter that can be used to tune the amount of absorbed light in double perovskite BFCO films. This result is in agreement with previous work.18 Following electronic structure calculations and the experimental absorption spectrum of similar materials with Fe/Cr in B-sites,34,35 we designate the peaks at ca. 1.8 eV and 2.3 eV to charge transfer excitations between Cr and/or O to Fe mixed d orbital Hubbard transitions that occur in locally ordered regions of the sample. The first threshold gap observed in the range of 2.2–2.8 eV is attributed to the disordered BFCO phase (d-BFCO).18 As for the second optical transition region, a linear extrapolation of (αE)2versus energy to zero yields bandgaps of 2.3, 1.8, 2.4 and 1.7 eV for films of BFCO #1, #2, #3 and #4, respectively (cf.Table 1). These bandgaps are thought to originate from the o-BFCO phase.18 The bandgap of BFCO is theoretically defined by the difference between the Cr 3d–O 2p hybrids in the valence band and the empty Fe 3d conduction band.32,36 Tuning the bandgap requires the modification of the transition metal–oxygen (TM–O) bond lengths and their interaction energies including the hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion.37,38 Considering the inverse dependence of the bandgap with respect to the lattice parameter (i.e. a smaller lattice parameter implies a larger bandgap), we conclude that tuning the bandgap involves altering the lattice parameters, as confirmed in epitaxial BFO films.39,40 In our case, the reduction in the bandgap due to the compressive misfit strain is ca. 0.5 eV, close to both theoretical and experimental values reported for BFO (ca. 0.5 eV).39,40 On the other hand, the bandgap tunability is also related to the oxidation states in perovskite structures.35,41 The XPS analysis shows that 3+ states are dominant for both Fe and Cr elements (Fig. S4†). According to previous studies, the oxygen octahedra surrounding the TM cations in the (Fe3+) d5–(Cr3+) d3 system are rigid and will be less sensitive to strain due to the homogeneous distribution of the spins in Fe and Cr degenerate d-orbitals.35,41

To further confirm the optical energy gap status (e.g. the difference of exciton energy between two different energy levels and/or defects levels33) in the obtained BFCO films, the difference of exciton energy was demonstrated in photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The PL peaks at ca. 520 and ca. 720 nm (Fig. 3c) in the PL spectra of the i–n (BFCO/NSTO) and p–i–n (NiO/BFCO/NSTO) heterojunctions qualitatively confirmed the two band gap thresholds of BFCO at ca. 2.4 eV (ca. 517 nm) and ca. 1.7 eV (ca. 729 nm) calculated previously in Fig. 3b. The PL intensity signal of the p–i–n heterojunction is much weaker than that of the i–n device configuration. The pronounced PL quenching observed in our p–i–n device highlights the crucial role played by the p-type NiO layer as a charge-carrier separator and extractor, which induces a reduction of charge carrier recombination and thus improves the device performance.
To understand the role of NiO in the devices, we also assessed the optical properties and chemical composition status of p-type NiO films. The optical absorbance spectrum is shown in Fig. 3d, together with the Tauc plots of (αhν)2versus hν (shown as the inset). The calculated direct band gap of NiO is derived as ca. 3.6 eV, a value close to that previously reported for PLD-deposited NiO thin films.28 The XPS analysis (Fig. S4e and f†) reveals peaks at 854 and 861 eV representing Ni2+ in the NiO octahedral bonding configuration in the rock-salt NiO structure and a peak at ca. 857 eV associated with the Ni3+ state, which implies the occurrence of Ni2+ vacancies (metal deficiency) or excess oxygen. These results are in agreement with the previously reported study on PLD-deposited p-type NiO thin films employed in p–i–n heterojunction devices.42

PV performance and analysis
A series of PV devices with BFCO #1, #2, #3 and #4 as absorbers (labelled device #1, #2, #3 and #4 respectively) were fabricated by PLD, implementing n-type NSTO conducting perovskite substrates as an ETL and bottom electrode; p-type NiO conducting films as an EBL/HTL and two-dimensional arrays of ITO transparent conducting electrodes on top. In Fig. 4, the PV performance of the two device architectures, the i–n (BFCO/NSTO) and p–i–n (NiO/BFCO/NSTO) devices are characterized and compared. As shown in Fig. 4a, the dark J–V curve measured from the i–n junction (device #1) shows a rectifier characteristic, while under the simulated AM1.5 irradiation, the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) extracted are 2.77 mA cm−2, 0.44 V and 42%, respectively. This results in a PCE of only 0.5%. This device is based on a BFCO absorber layer with a bandgap (ordered) of ca. 2.3 eV and a FE polarization of ca. 44 μC cm−2. For device #2, based on a BFCO film with a narrower bandgap of ca. 1.8 eV and a FE polarization of ca. 14 μC cm−2, the PV performance is improved: JSC and FF are enhanced by 20% and 33%, respectively, yielding a PCE of 0.8%, which represents a 60% enhancement compared to device #1. We attribute the increased JSC and FF to enhanced light absorption and to the excited state of photo-generated carriers promoted by the lower bandgap of the BFCO layer (e.g. Eg (BFCO #2) = 1.8 eV), which is more significant than the FE polarization controlled driven force for the devices #1 and #2. The related schematic for i–n devices illustrates the mechanism of FE polarization controlled charge carrier separation, as shown in Fig. 4c.

FE polarization is crucially important for the tunability of the internal depolarization electric field and the optimal surface band structures which could enhance the PV performance.18 Thus, we aim to apply electric poling on electrodes to understand the FE polarization controlled PV performance and charge transfer behavior in BFCO films. During J–V measurements, the samples have undergone poling pretreatments in two different directions (±8 V). The positive voltage was applied to the NSTO electrode, resulting in an electric field in the opposite direction to the bottom barrier field and in the same direction as the top one. All the PV parameters of the tested devices are summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 4b shows the J–V curve measured on p–i–n heterojunction devices (i.e., NiO/BFCO/NSTO, as shown in Fig. 4d). For device #3, the dark J–V curve behaves like a diode with good current rectification with a dark current density of about 0.15 mA cm−2 at +0.3 V, while under illumination, the device shows a JSC of 7.17 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.51 V, and a FF of 33% yielding a PCE of 1.2%; device #4 shows improved PV parameters compared to device #3, with a JSC of 7.97 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.53 V, a FF of 48% and a PCE of 2.0%. However, when comparing with the i–n configuration device (e.g. device #1), the VOC, JSC and PCE of the p–i–n device (e.g. device #4) increased by a factor of 1.2, 3.0 and 4.0, respectively. The photocurrent is significantly increased, confirming that the main contribution to the PV output in the device originates from excited photocarriers generated inside the BFCO layer and possibly the increase of driving force provided by the electric field, both promoted by the depletion regions formed at the p–i and i–n interfaces in the p–i–n heterojunction. The main factors which affect the fill factor are the series resistance and the parallel (shunt) resistance of the recombination current in the space charge region of the PV device. The increased VOC and JSC are thought to originate from the increased shunt resistance (from 269 to 323 Ω cm2) and decreased series resistance (from 57 to 25 Ω cm2) of the device under illumination. The FF reduction is attributed to the charge carrier recombination due to the presence of charged defects (such as Ni2+ vacancies or excess oxygen) in the NiO thin film and related interfaces, which was partly confirmed by XPS in the previous paragraph (cf. Fig. S4e and f†).
These results hence imply that two depletion regions in p–i–n heterostructures (operative at the p–i and i–n interfaces) together have contributed favorable PV properties. Although photo-generated carriers can also be excited in the NSTO and NiO layers by the UV component of solar light, their contribution was proven to be negligible.43 Switching the FE polarization by applying a pulse of −8 V to the bottom electrode reverses the sign of both VOC and JSC of the device (cf.Fig. 4b).
To understand the PV performance of BFCO-based devices and the effective transport of photo-generated carriers, we analyzed their electronic structure using UPS. The energy-level diagrams of each component material used in the BFCO devices are illustrated in Fig. 4e and f. The determination method of the electron affinity Ec, work function Ef and ionization potential Ev is described in Fig. S5.† Qualitative analyses were performed only for ordered domain BFCO based on the UPS results because of the complex nature of the ordered/disordered phases coexisting in the BFCO films, making the construction of the energy band diagrams extremely challenging. As illustrated in Fig. 4e and f, the band edge positions of the BFCO, NSTO and NiO are well aligned, favoring the effective transport of photo-generated carriers.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 5) of device #1 (i–n junction) and device #4 (p–i–n heterojunction) were carried out after orienting the spontaneous polarization towards the surface (by applying +8 V bias to the NSTO) at RT. Device #1 exhibits a continuous photoresponse from 400 to 850 nm, with a maximum EQE of ca. 12% at 560 nm (ca. 2.2 eV), which is close to the value of the absorption edge (ca. 2.3 eV in the ordered domain) of the intrinsic absorber BFCO #1. When decreasing the wavelength of incident light, the EQE of device #4 starts to increase at 850 nm, and then shows a shoulder at 760 nm and a peak at 650 nm (ca. 1.9 eV), reaching the maximum EQE value of 32%, which is comparable to the quantum efficiency achieved within a single ferroelectric domain or domain walls.44,45 The maximum EQE of the p–i–n heterojunction is much higher than that of the i–n junction. These results clearly demonstrate that the PV response is mainly given by the photocarriers excited inside the BFCO and that the NiO layer in the p–i–n device induces a more efficient photocarrier extraction.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
We applied Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to better understand the role of the NiO layer in the p–i–n device. The analysis was carried out in the dark and with no dc bias applied during the measurement. In Fig. 6a the complex impedance for a representative p–i–n (device #4) and i–n (device #1) sample is impedance. It is possible to distinguish two semicircles, one at high frequency (left-most) and one bigger semicircle at medium-low frequency. The latter can be related to the bulk material. For dark conditions, the p–i–n sample exhibits the highest bulk resistance and capacitance, similarly to previous work.16 Another feature that can be extracted from the EIS is the general behavior of the overall capacitance processes. Fig. 6b shows the trend of the real part of the capacitance and the phase as a function of the frequency obtained under short-circuit conditions in the dark. Clearly the two samples have different complex impedance behavior. At high frequency, the p–i–n device presents a plateau (indicated as a peak around 100 kHz in the phase plot) that is usually related to the bulk capacitance and which we associate, in this case, to the capacitance of the p–i junction. The i–n device shows a plateau at medium frequency (around 1 kHz) while the p–i–n junction shows a similar feature one order of magnitude below, around 100 Hz, confirming the presence of the i–n junction in both the devices. A static dielectric capacitance at low frequency can be identified for both cells. Therefore, from the EIS, it is inferred that two depletion regions (interfacial regions at p–i and i–n) were formed in the p–i–n heterostructures.

This behaviour indicates that the two depletion regions formed at the p–i and i–n and an internal field add across the entire layer of BFCO, providing the necessary force to drive the photo-generated carrier's separation, yielding an efficient PV performance.
Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, we report the fabrication of multiferroic BFCO-based p–i–n heterojunction devices using PLD. A p-type NiO semiconductor thin film acting as an EBL/HTL and a typical n-type NSTO acting as an ETL were used to form the double-interfaced heterojunction based on all-inorganic oxide, multiferroic and perovskite materials.
Ellipsometry and FE measurements demonstrate adequate optical absorption properties and FE polarization in BFCO films at RT. UPS analysis showed that the energy levels, with band alignment at the two junctions, favor carrier separation at the p–i and i–n interfaces of the p–i–n heterojunction. Current–voltage characteristics recorded under dark and white light illuminated conditions showed that the PV properties improved due to two depletion regions formed at the p–i and i–n interfaces in the p–i–n heterojunctions. These results are also confirmed by EIS measurements.
We systematically investigated the mechanism of charge carrier separation, transport and collection in multiferroic oxide based single-layered devices with a p–i–n heterojunction, and demonstrated the complex relationships between the structural, optical, electrical and ferroelectric properties of BFCO films sandwiched between p- and n-type oxides, and how they affect the PV performance of devices.
Overall, we present a promising approach for fabricating tunable and efficient all-inorganic oxide PV devices based on double-perovskite multiferroic films.
Methods
Epitaxial growth of BFCO films
BFCO films ca. 120 nm in thickness were epitaxially grown on (100)-oriented single-crystalline 0.5 wt% Nb-doped SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). A stoichiometric BFCO target was ablated using a KrF excimer laser (wavelength of 248 nm and pulse duration of 25 ns) with an energy density of about 2.0 J cm−2 at a repetition rate in the range of 4–8 Hz. The average deposition rate was between 0.04 and 0.06 Å per pulse. The deposition temperature and oxygen partial pressure were 610–680 °C and 8 mTorr, respectively. All the deposition parameters of BFCO films are listed in Table S1.†
Growth of NiO thin films
NiO films ca. 10 nm in thickness were grown on top of the BFCO/NSTO junction by PLD. The stoichiometric NiO target was ablated afterwards, without breaking the vacuum, using the same laser set at the same energy density, at a repetition rate of 5 Hz. The deposition temperature and oxygen partial pressure were 200 °C and 10 mTorr, respectively, resulting in an average deposition rate of about 0.02 Å per pulse.
Characterization of thin films
The crystal quality and growth orientation of the films were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X'pert pro diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation) by performing θ–2θ scans.
Asymmetrical θ–2θ measurements around (111) NSTO reflections were performed to qualitatively estimate the cationic ordering of Fe and Cr ions within the BFCO films.
The thickness of the films was measured by X-ray reflectometry (XRR) using the same XRD system.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Enviroscope) imaging was used to characterize the surface morphology and roughness of the grown films.
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) implemented on the same AFM instrument was used to study the ferroelectric properties of BFCO films.
Chemical analysis performed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS, VG Escalab 220i XL) revealed the formation of valence states 2+ and 4+ for Fe and Cr, respectively, in addition to the 3+ oxidation state.
The Fermi energies and valence band edges of the materials involved in the heteroepitaxial structures were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).
The FE properties of BFCO films were measured using a thin-film analyser system (TFA 2000) at 2 kHz.
Nanoscale measurements of ferroelectric properties were performed by PFM using a Veeco Enviroscope AFM. We applied an AC voltage of 0.5 V at 26 kHz between the conductive probe (type MESP from Bruker) and the NSTO substrate and detected the BFCO film surface induced piezoelectric vibrations using a lock-in amplifier from Signal Recovery (model 7265).
To investigate the optical properties of the obtained heterostructures, room temperature ellipsometry measurements were performed in the 1.25 to 3.35 eV range at three angles of incidence (i.e. 55, 65, and 75°) using a VASE ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam Company). The absorption coefficient α of the films was obtained from k by using the following formula: α = 4πk/λ, where λ is the wavelength of the incident light. The bandgap Eg of the films was calculated according to Tauc's relation using the following equation: αE = A(E − Eg)n, where E is the photon energy, A is a constant, and n is equal to 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect gap materials, respectively.18 In our data, the lack of the characteristic shape of the (αE)1/2versus E plot and the linear dependence of (αE)2versus E reveals that the bandgap of the films is direct. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using 405 nm wavelength light as an excitation source (a homemade setup). All measurements were carried out at room temperature (RT).
Device fabrication
Two-dimensional arrays of transparent 100 nm-thick ITO top electrodes were deposited by PLD through a shadow mask with circular apertures (100–200 μm in diameter). Four tested samples labelled devices #1–#4 involved in the intrinsic absorbers BFCO #1–#4, respectively. Devices #1 and #2 were fabricated as i–n heterojunctions compared with devices #3 and #4 as p–i–n heterojunctions (cf. Table S1†).
Device characterization
For PV measurements, the current–voltage characteristics of the devices were recorded using a Keithley source meter. 1 sun illumination was obtained using an AAA class Sun simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 filter having an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The capacitive component of the complex impedance in the depletion region of i–n and p–i–n devices was recorded by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which was conducted in the dark using a SOLARTRON 1260 A Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer. The applied AC signal was 10 mV in amplitude, in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 1 MHz. All the samples were measured inside a Faraday cage. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using an EQE 200 Oriel integrated system by employing a monochromator combined with an optical chopper and a lock-in amplifier. The measurement step was 10 nm.
