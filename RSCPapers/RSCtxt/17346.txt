    , Accepted 9th October 2015First published on 13th October 2015AbstractRedox-flow batteries that employ redox-active polymers (pRFB) represent a novel energy storage technology requiring innovative materials. Polymers bearing a viologen unit (N,N′-dialkyl-4,4′-bipyridines) or a TEMPO radical are synthesized. Acrylamide, poly(ethyleneglycol) methyl acrylates, di(ethylene glycol) methacrylate and 2-(methacryloyloxy)-N,N,N-trimethylethane ammonium chloride are studied as water-solubility-enhancing comonomers. The rheological and electrochemical properties of these polymers in aqueous solutions are evaluated, revealing poly(1-methyl-1′-(4-vinylbenzyl)-[4,4′-bipyridine]-1,1′-diium dichloride) (P2a) and poly(4-methacryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-co-2-(methacryloyloxy)-N,N,N-trimethylethane ammonium chloride) (P4e) to be most suited as anode and cathode materials, respectively, for a pRFB.
Introduction
A growing environmental awareness has stimulated the vast extension of renewable electricity generation. Since the output of wind and solar farms fluctuates significantly over the course of a day, new batteries that are inexpensive, safe and long-lasting need to be developed for the purpose of stationary large-scale energy storage.1,2 Redox-flow batteries (RFBs) are considered to fulfill these requirements. The RFB employs redox-active materials dissolved in aqueous or organic solutions, in contrast with conventional lead-acid or Li-ion batteries, which use solid-state electrodes. By varying the size of the electrolyte reservoir, the storage capacity of a RFB can be adjusted easily, while the power rating can be tailored through the number of electrochemical cells, where the actual redox reactions take place. In consequence, RFBs permit the independent scalability of capacity and power, standing out from conventional battery concepts.3,4
Among the redox-active electrolyte solutions used for RFBs, vanadium salts in sulfuric acid is the most thoroughly studied system.3,5 Numerous other highly corrosive and/or toxic metal salt combinations have been investigated, including iron/chromium, vanadium/bromine and manganese/vanadium.6,7 However, these systems challenge the chemical stability of installed battery components, impose a safety risk and, hence, spark interest in organic, carbon-based active materials that are well-performing as well as easy-to-handle.8–12 In particular organic polymers promise to fulfill the needs of an inherently safe and affordable RFB-system.13,14 By additionally employing aqueous solutions, several problems of conventional RFBs can be overcome:15
(I) The absence of strong acids or organic solvents in the electrolyte solution leads to low corrosivity. Simple aqueous sodium chloride solutions at neutral pH values around pH 7 can be used as the supporting electrolyte.
(II) Expensive ion-exchange membranes (e.g., Nafion™), which separate the cathode and the anode, can be substituted with affordable size-exclusion membranes. They are permeable to small ions, while retaining the active polymers and, thus, preventing self-discharge and internal short circuits.
(III) High system safety can be achieved by the non-flammability of the aqueous electrolyte.
Here we present the screening of two series of redox-active polymers that are potentially active materials for water-based polymer redox-flow batteries (pRFBs). The study further expands the research on two single materials discussed in a previous report15 and presents new synthetic strategies in detail. Both components were chosen because of their expected redox potentials, which lie within the electrochemical operational voltage window, predetermined by the electrochemical water splitting.
2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl oxyl (TEMPO) is applied as a redox-active core structure for the cathode, since it shows fast one-electron redox reactions, reveals a high stability of all redox states and is therefore widely used in solid-state batteries (organic radical batteries, ORBs), spin probes and polymerization mediators.16,17 For the battery's anode, an N,N′-disubstituted 4,4′-bipyridine (viologen) is used. The ionic viologen species shows two stable redox states, promises good solubility in aqueous systems, and is commonly employed in biology, electrochromic windows, batteries etc.18,19 Both targeted polymers require high water-solubility, good electrochemical stability as well as low viscosity in aqueous solution and need to be easy-to-prepare. For this reason, a special focus is placed on electrochemically inert additives and comonomers as well as on free radical polymerization methods and molar-mass regulation by using thiol-based modifiers (chain-transfer agents). In contrast to molar-mass regulation by controlled radical polymerization techniques, this approach is more economical and enables future up-scaling for industrial, cost-effective production.
Experimental
Instruments and reagents
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar and TCI and were used as received without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Fourier 300 from Bruker. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) relative to the residual signal of the deuterated solvent. ATR-IR spectra were acquired on an IRAffinity-1 from Shimadzu. Elemental analysis was carried out using an Euro EA3000 from Heka Tech. X-band EPR spectra were recorded on an EMXmicro CW-EPR spectrometer from Bruker using powdered samples. ESI-Q-TOF MS measurements (positive ion mode) were performed using a micrOTOF mass spectrometer from Bruker Daltonics equipped with an automatic syringe pump by KD Scientific for sample injection. The standard electrospray ion (ESI) source was used to generate the ions and the instrument was calibrated in the m/z range 50 to 3000 using an internal calibration standard (Tunemix solution) from Agilent. Samples with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg mL−1 were injected using a constant flow (3 mL min−1) of sample solution. Data and HRMS calculations were processed via the Bruker Data Analysis software version 4.0. For size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), an Agilent 1200 series system (degasser: Polymer Standard Service Mainz, pump: G1310A, auto sampler: G1329A, oven: Techlab, diode array detector: G1315D, RI detector: G1362A) using a PSS GRAM guard 1000/30 Å column and N,N-dimethylacetamide (+0.21% lithium chloride) as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 (40 °C) was employed.
Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) was measured on a Postnova system (Postnova Analytics, Germany): degasser: PN7520; solvent organizer: PN7140; FOCUS pump: PN1130; TIP pump: PN1130; CROSS flow pump: AF2000 MT-Field Flow; fractionation autosampler: PN5300; channel oven: PN4020; RID: PN3150; MALS: PN3070, λ = 635 nm; UV/VisD: PN3211 (SPD-20A, Shimadzu); FRC: PN8030 (FRC-10A + communication module CBM-20A, Shimadzu); Postnova AF2000 MT membrane with 10 kDa cut-off, reg. cellulose; buffer solution: 25 mmol L−1 acidic acid, 20 mmol L−1 sodium chloride, pH = 3.5.
The flow behavior of the polymer solutions was studied on a MCR301 rotational rheometer from Anton Paar at 20 °C under continuous shear employing a plate–plate (49.952 mm diameter) measuring system (PP50).
Cloud points (CP) were determined using a Crystal 16 from Avantium Technologies connected to a chiller (Julabo FP 40) at a wavelength of 500 nm and a heating ramp of 1 K min−1 during two heating–cooling cycles. The CP temperatures (Tcp) are reported from 50% transmittance at a polymer concentration of 1 mg mL−1 and salt concentrations of 0.1 mol L−1.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on an SP-50 from BioLogic Science Instruments with a three-electrode setup using a platinum wire as the counter electrode, a glassy carbon disc electrode as the working electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference. Aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1) was used as the supporting electrolyte.

1-Methyl-[4,4′-bipyridine]-1-ium chloride (1a). 
Procedure 1: 4,4′-Bipyridine (77.3 g, 0.495 mol) was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile (165 mL) and toluene (165 mL). The solution was transferred to a Büchi ecoclave pressure reactor and chloromethane (25 g, 0.495 mol) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 48 h. After the removal of the solvent, the precipitate was washed with toluene (2 × 150 mL) and dried (40 °C, 10 mbar). The title compound 1a was obtained as off-white powder (94.9 g, yield: 93%).
Procedure 2: N-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide 1b was synthesized according to literature procedures.20 Ion exchange to chloride was performed by flushing an aqueous solution of 1b over an ion-exchange column filled with Dowex Marathon A2 (chloride form) ion exchange resin and subsequently removing the water by lyophilization. Full conversion was ensured by testing the filtrate for the absence of iodide ions via cyclic voltammetry.

In a representative example P2a, with 2 mol% modifier, 1-methyl-1′-(4-vinylbenzyl)-[4,4′-bipyridine]-1,1′-diium dichloride 2 (0.5 g; 1.4 mmol) was dissolved in water (0.7 mL) and potassium peroxodisulfate (22.6 mg; 0.084 mmol) and modifier thioacetic acid (2 μL; 0.028 mmol) were added. The mixture was deaerated by flushing with argon for 20 min and subsequently stirred at 85 °C for 1 h after which full monomer conversion was achieved. Subsequently, the solvent was removed by lyophilization (0.47 g; 94%). For the other polymers, the amount of modifier was adjusted according to the data given in Table 1.

The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 21 h, during which the polymer precipitated. The solid was separated by centrifugation and no further purification was performed due to the poor solubility of the polymer.

General procedure for preparation of P4
To the reaction mixtures of P3, three equivalents of hydrogen peroxide (30%) and 0.03 equivalents of sodium tungstate dihydrate were added. The mixtures were stirred for 24 h at room temperature and subsequently dialyzed against water. The solvent was removed by lyophilization to yield the polymer as orange powder.
Results and discussion
Viologen-polymer
For the preparation of a polymeric viologen, three different routes are considered in the literature: (I) chain-growth polymerization of a viologen-bearing monomer,21 (II) step-growth polymerization of bipyridine and a dihalogen alkane22 and (III) post-polymerization functionalization.23 As method II generally yields oligomers of low molar mass and method III suffers from incomplete functionalization, a direct polymerization approach was chosen to synthesize polymers P2a and P2b.
In order to ensure stable electrochemistry, the anion of monomer 2, and, hence, of the bipyridinium salt 1, need to have a redox potential above 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Otherwise, the ions would be oxidized within the operational window of the pRFB and would therefore interfere with the cathode polymer. Chloride ions are suitable for this application since they promise not only the required electrochemical stability (E° = 1.36 V),24 but also good solubility in aqueous solutions.
While the preparation of dimethyl-viologens is well described in the literature,25–27 a straightforward method for the preparation of the mono-substituted chloride salt is a rarely touched subject. The chloroacetic-acid approach suggested by Yang et al. resulted in yields of only 45%, being too low for practical application.28 Double substitution of the bipyridine cannot be prevented and a portion of 20 to 30% of dimethyl-viologen chloride is generally formed. Alternatively, the chloride salt can be prepared by reaction with methyl iodide in good yield and subsequent ion exchange from iodide (1b) to chloride. This approach was accomplished with an ion-exchange resin (DOWEX Marathon). A more promising approach is the direct methylation with chloromethane gas. In order to prevent double-substitution, chloromethane gas has to be dosed carefully and the solvent system must be optimized to ensure precipitation of the product, removing it from the reaction solution. While 1a is slightly soluble in acetonitrile, resulting in 10% dimethyl-viologen, a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile/toluene lowered the generation of the side product to <2% at an overall yield of 93% (Scheme 1, for 1H and 13C NMR spectra see ESI Fig. 1 and 2†).
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the synthesis of methyl-viologen 1, of the styrene-based monomer 2 and of the viologen-polymer P2. The polymer was prepared employing K2S2O8 or 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ABCVA) as initiator using different comonomer ratios. Thioacetic acid was evaluated as suitable modifier (chain-transfer agent). 
Subsequently, monomer 2 was prepared from N-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium chloride 1a and p-chloromethyl styrene in good yield of 89% (for 1H and 13C NMR spectra see ESI Fig. 3 and 4†) and further processed via a free radical polymerization approach.
Two different viologen-polymers were synthesized, the homopolymer P2a and an acrylamide-containing copolymer P2b. Besides 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ABCVA), the radical initiator potassium peroxodisulfate (K2S2O8) was tested, with the latter revealing a better performance. For ABCVA, only a high comonomer content (mole fraction) of xacrylamide = 0.5 allows full conversion within 17 h as determined by 1H NMR. For the homopolymer as well as the copolymer with xacrylamide = 0.13, only conversions of 60 to 70% are achieved for both monomers. Switching from ABCVA to K2S2O8 enables full monomer conversion for the preparation of the homopolymer and the copolymer at various mole fractions within one hour (1H NMR, ESI Fig. 5 to 7†).
In their pristine redox state, all polymers were well soluble in water and aqueous electrolyte solutions containing sodium chloride. The solubility of the reduced species, formed upon charging of the redox-flow batteries, was studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV, vide infra). P2a revealed no formation of precipitates or films on the electrode in its reduced state indicating sufficient solubility in all utilized redox states. Hence, the usage of a solubilizing comonomer is not necessary and the influence of a modifier, i.e., a simple, low-cost, thiol-based chain-transfer agent, on the molar mass was studied only for the homopolymer P2a (Table 1). In the absence of a modifier, a high dispersity of Đ = 7.2 was obtained. In order to decrease the molar mass and the resulting viscosity, which is disadvantageous to the battery performance, by decreasing the ion mobility and the efficiency, thioacetic acid was chosen as a water-soluble modifier. The addition of 8 mol% thioacetic acid lowers the molar mass (Mn) and dispersity to 10 kg mol−1 and Đ = 2.4, respectively. This decrease is accompanied by a strong decrease of the apparent viscosity from 30 to 7 mPa s (41 wt% aqueous solution). The rheogram (Fig. 1) presents a Newtonian behavior over a wide range of shear rates, which are generally associated with pipe flow being important for a RFB.

TEMPO-polymer
The polyradical poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA), commonly employed as electrode material in organic radical batteries (ORBs), is usually used with organic solvents and is insoluble in water.16 Since excellent solubility of the active material is crucial for a RFB electrolyte, the effect of solubilizing moieties was studied. Two poly(ethyleneglycol) methyl ethers (P3a and P3b), a di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (P3c), an amide (P3d) and a choline moiety (P3e) were introduced by copolymerization of their corresponding methacrylate monomers. The polymers were subsequently oxidized with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Na2WO4 to form the redox-active polymer (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the synthesis of precursor polymer P3 and the subsequent oxidation to TEMPO-polymer P4. The polymer was prepared using ABCVA or K2S2O8 as initiator at different comonomers and modifier ratios. RAFT and free radical polymerization approaches were investigated. 
Poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate
Poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs), widely found in battery gel electrolytes and as solubilizing agents in pharmaceuticals, are inert within a large electrochemical potential window and promise good water solubility.29–32 Copolymers were prepared from 3 and two different poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) macromonomers 4a and 4b with a molar mass of 450 and 950 g mol−1, respectively, via reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization employing 2-cyano-2-butyl dithiobenzoate (CBDB) as the chain-transfer agent (Table 2, 1H NMR, ESI Fig. 8†). Although free amines are generally considered to be incompatible with thiocarbonylthio chain-transfer agents due to aminolysis, the sterically hindered amine 3 can be polymerized by the RAFT technique.33 Full monomer conversion was achieved for both comonomers as well as for 3 (1H NMR).
Different mole fractions x of the comonomer, from 0.14 to 0.5, were applied. In the case of 4a, values of x4a ≥ 0.2 allow good water solubility, while 4b is already soluble at x4b = 0.14, which is attributed to an increased hydrophilicity caused by significantly larger PEG side chains. Polymers P3a revealed molar masses (Mn) ranging from 46 to 51 kg mol−1, while polymers P3b showed slightly higher values due to the increased molar mass of the macromonomer. No significant change in the molar mass was observed upon oxidation of the polymers to P4a and P4b. The values measured by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) correspond well to the theoretical molar masses.
Aqueous solutions of PEGMA polymers are known for their lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior.34–37 As the active material of a RFB needs to be soluble within a wide temperature window, the solubility of polymers P4a and P4b in aqueous medium was tested at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1. The temperature was increased at a heating rate of 1 K min−1 and the transmittance was monitored. The resulting cloud-point temperatures (Tcp) are summarized in Table 3. Because RFB electrolytes require the addition of supporting salts for charge balance, the influence of salt solutions on the thermoresponsivity was studied. Sodium sulfate, chloride and perchlorate were chosen as representative examples from the Hofmeister series on the basis of their ability to destabilize colloidal solutions (SO42− > Cl− > ClO4−) and their electrochemical stability in the operational voltage window of the pRFB.24,38 The anions revealed a strong influence on the solubility of the investigated polymers. According to the Hofmeister series, sulfate ions lead to a strong salting out effect and, therefore, low Tcp values. In contrast, the addition of chloride or perchlorate salts displays a weaker effect on the LCST behavior of the polymer solutions. Apart from sulfate ions, all solutions showed an increase in Tcp at higher PEGMA contents, further enhanced by an increased length of the PEG side chain in the macromonomer 4b in comparison with 4a. These observations are consistent with previous findings and the general effect of hydrophilic groups on Tcp.34,36
Only for highly hydrophilic polymers with a high content of macromonomer 4b, a reversible LCST behavior is apparent. Polymer P4a precipitates irreversibly in salt solutions at temperatures as low as 41 °C. The aqueous solution of P4b shows reversible LCST behavior in pure water. However, only polymers with a high PEGMA content redissolve upon cooling in aqueous solutions containing sodium chloride or perchlorate (Tcp > 80 °C).
The rheological behavior of P4a and P4b in aqueous sodium chloride solutions (0.5 mol L−1), which is the cheapest electrolyte salt, was investigated in detail (Fig. 2). Both copolymers show pseudoplastic, shear-thinning behavior under continuous shear. A peak between 1 s−1 and 10 s−1 indicates shear-induced association. Decreasing the PEGMA content leads to a more distinct peak, being indicative of strengthening of the association effect. In particular, comparison of the polymers with x4a; 4b = 0.33 reveals a higher apparent viscosity at low shear rates and stronger association for P4a due to higher hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, the apparent viscosity of the solutions of P4b does not decay to the same low values as for the solutions of P4a at high shear rates, since the longer PEG-chains hinder the orientation of the macromolecules in the flow field.
 Fig. 2  Rheological behavior of selected TEMPO-polymers containing the comonomer PEGMA-450 P4a and PEGMA-950 P4b under continuous shear in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1). Inset: thixotropy test of 5.6 wt% of polymer P4a at x4a = 0.22 in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1). 
Upon the addition of salt to the polymer solutions, a decrease of the viscosity and damped shear thickening were revealed. The most hydrophobic sample of the test, P4a at x4a = 0.22, which is soluble in pure water, forms a soft solid upon the addition of sodium chloride, attributed to strong interactions within the formed gel network. This gel displayed a thixotropic behavior (Fig. 2, inset). After an initial rest interval, the gel structure is destroyed by applying a load (shear rate 100 s−1). Subsequently, the gel structure was recovered fast (90% after 190 s).
In conclusion, an acceptable solution behavior of PEGMA copolymers is only obtained for highly hydrophilic polymers using long PEG side chains and a high content of the comonomer. Decreasing the length of the hydrophilic side chain, e.g., by using di(ethylene glycol) methacrylate 4c, leads to insoluble polymers even at x4c = 0.85. Nevertheless, the large amount of redox-inactive comonomers as well as the disadvantageous association of the comb-like copolymers P4a and P4b motivated the search for polymers that are better suited in practical RFB applications.
Methacrylamide
Besides ether-based moieties, methacrylamide 4d is a low-cost and often used solubility-enhancing monomer of low molar mass. Simple free radical polymerization was used in order to synthesize the copolymers P3d in a straightforward manner omitting expensive RAFT agents (1H NMR, ESI Fig. 9†). To study the influence of a decrease in the molar mass, the polymers were prepared in the presence of 8 mol% of the modifier 2-mercaptoethanol and the reactions were driven up to full monomer conversion. While the free radical polymerization yielded polymers with a molar mass of 67 kg mol−1, the modifier lowered the molar mass to 9 kg mol−1. Solubility tests revealed a minimal necessary amount of x4d = 0.67 (Table 4).
2-(Methacryloyloxy)-N,N,N-trimethylethane ammonium chloride
In addition to ether-based comonomers, special focus was on the cationic monomer 2-(methacryloyloxy)-N,N,N-trimethylethane ammonium chloride 4e, which can be used to introduce strong hydrophilicity. Polymers P3e were prepared by free radical polymerization being a low-cost synthetic procedure suitable for future up-scaling. The optimum comonomer amount was found to be x4e = 0.5.

1H NMR analysis of the reaction mixtures revealed partial hydrolysis of the ester group in 4e, which is catalyzed by the amine base of monomer 3. If a mixture of water and methanol is used as the solvent, the transesterification product is found as well (1H NMR, ESI Fig. 10†). While alkaline solutions facilitate the hydrolysis, the ester is stable in neutral media.39 By neutralization of the reaction mixture with hydrochloric acid before the polymerization reaction and subsequent pH-adjustment, the hydrolysis effect was diminished.
Since polymers prepared by free radical polymerization revealed high molar masses (Table 5) and, therefore, a high solution viscosity and pseudoplastic behavior, a molar-mass control strategy was evaluated. In contrast to molar-mass regulation by the RAFT approach, the more economical thiol-based modifier 2-mercaptoethanol was employed. The influence of up to 14 mol% modifier on the preparation of P3e was studied. Using up to 6 mol% of 2-mercaptoethanol reduced the molar mass (Mn) from 134 kg mol−1 to 32 kg mol−1. An optimum value was found at 8 mol%, resulting in Mn = 14 kg mol−1; further addition did not significantly alter the results. In order to improve the space–time yield, the influence of monomer concentration was studied. Increasing the initial concentration to 4 mol L−1 resulted generally in lower molar masses, still featuring full monomer conversions (1H NMR) as reached for lower concentrations.
Polymer P4e without a modifier, prepared from its corresponding precursor P3e by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (1H NMR, ESI Fig. 11†), revealed a pseudoplastic behavior under continuous shear (Fig. 3, top). A shear-induced association, typical for the comb-like polymers P4a and P4b, was not observed for this, linear, polymer. Upon salt addition, an increase in the apparent viscosity was observed. A comparison of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate reveals the anion as critical. Exchanging chloride for sulfate ions mitigate the effect significantly. Nevertheless, chloride ions are preferred for practical RFB applications due to the low solubility of sodium sulfate in water. A strong decrease of the apparent viscosity to 29 mPa s is achieved by employing 8 mol% of 2-mercaptoethanol as a modifier, which leads to a lower molar mass (Fig. 3, bottom). Raising the sodium chloride content leads to a higher viscosity, attributed to polyelectrolyte complex formation. In contrast to polymers prepared without a modifier, the low-molar-mass polymers show Newtonian behavior over a wide range of shear rates even at high polymer concentrations.
 Fig. 3  Top: Rheological behavior of TEMPO-polymer P4e prepared without modifier (14 wt% polymer in water, Mn = 152 kg mol−1; Mw = 796 kg mol−1; x4e = 0.53). Sodium and potassium chloride (33 mmol L−1) as well as sodium sulfate (16 mmol L−1) were added to the polymer solution. Bottom: Rheological behavior of TEMPO-polymer P4e prepared with 8 mol% modifier in water or aqueous sodium chloride solution (14 wt% polymer in water, Mn = 15 kg mol−1; Mw = 37 kg mol−1; x4e = 0.50). 
Due to the generally low viscosity, the good solubility and the simple preparation route, polymer P4e is superior in particular with regard to RFB applications in comparison with P4a to P4d.
Electrochemical investigation
The electrochemical behavior of the two most promising viologen- and TEMPO-polymers was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1), which is an appropriate supporting electrolyte for CV analysis as well as practical RFB applications. Two polymers of different molar masses of both P2a and P4e were chosen as they demonstrate the best rheological performance and no thermoresponsive behavior.
In general, the viologen-polymers P2a exhibit a reduction reaction of the divalent viologen cation (Viol++) towards a monovalent radical cation (Viol+˙) at −0.4 V and a second reduction, forming a neutral viologen (Viol0) at −0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Although the first step is chemically fully reversible, the second reduction leads to a fast degradation of the molecule (ESI Fig. 12†). Hence, only the stable Viol++/Viol+˙ redox couple can be used for RFB electrolytes. A detailed investigation of the CV (Fig. 4) discloses a linear relationship between the peak currents and the square root of the scan rate, indicating a diffusion-controlled behavior and the absence of precipitates. The slope of the current functions of the forward and the reverse scan differs significantly, with the latter being higher. Upon reoxidation, a sharp and narrow peak is visible.

This effect is presumably caused by the change in polarity of the polymer upon reduction. The reduced, monovalent Viol+˙ is less polar than the divalent cation Viol++, resulting in a poorer interaction of the polymer with the aqueous solvent and, hence, an accumulation of Viol+˙ at the hydrophobic electrode and, thereby, an enhancement of the backward peak current (“weak adsorption”). As the product is neither strongly adsorbed, in which case a peak splitting would be observed, nor precipitates as a film, which would be indicated by a non-linear relationship between the peak current and the square root of the scan rate (Fig. 4, inset), the polymer can be employed in RFBs.40,41
Comparison of the concentration-corrected peak currents for high-molar-mass polymers (Mw = 230 kg mol−1) and polymers of lower molar mass (Mw = 17 kg mol−1), which were prepared with a modifier, reveals a higher peak current ip for the latter (ESI Fig. 12 and 13†). With the diffusion coefficient being inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic radius R of a polymer according to the Stokes–Einstein equation (k, Boltzmann's constant; T, temperature; η, dynamic viscosity),  and with the peak current ip growing linearly with the square root of the diffusion coefficient D, according to the Randles–Sevcik equation (n, number of electrons; A, electrode surface; v, scan rate; c, bulk concentration),  a decrease in the polymer chain length results in a higher diffusion coefficient, subsequently leading to a higher peak current in the CV of the polymer P2a.
The oxidation of the TEMPO˙ free radical to its corresponding oxoammonium salt TEMPO+ occurs at 0.72 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The cyclic voltammogram shows a quasi-reversible behavior, typical for TEMPO polymers,14,42,43 with the rereduction which appears being broadened and less defined in comparison with the oxidation reaction. The peak currents grow linearly with the square root of the scan rate for the polymer P4e prepared with 1 mol% modifier (Fig. 5) as well as for the polymer of a slightly lower molar mass, which was prepared with 8 mol% modifier. As the molar masses of both investigated polymers differ only to a relatively small degree (Mw = 34 kg mol−1vs. 103 kg mol−1), the peak currents displayed in both voltammograms are in the same range, indicating similar diffusion coefficients (ESI Fig. 14 and 15†).

Conclusions
Aqueous, polymer-based redox-flow batteries (pRFB) require easy-to-prepare, well soluble, redox-active polymers. The viologen moiety and the TEMPO free radical were incorporated into polymers and their behavior in solution as well as their electrochemical properties were studied. It was found that the viologen-homopolymer poly(1-methyl-1′-(4-vinylbenzyl)-[4,4′-bipyridine]-1,1′-diium dichloride) P2a is well soluble in water, even in the reduced state (i.e., monocation). The polymer has a redox potential at −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), rendering it as a suitable anode material for pRFBs. When prepared with potassium peroxodisulfate as an initiator and 8 mol% thioacetic acid as a modifier (chain-transfer agent), a low apparent solution viscosity of only 7 mPa s (41 wt% polymer) is revealed in the range of shear rates associated with pipe flow.
While the viologen-homopolymer is well soluble in water, the TEMPO-polymer required a solubilizing comonomer. Unfortunately, poly(ethyleneglycol)-based comonomers cause an unfavorable LCST behavior and methacrylamide requires too high mole fractions of the comonomer. In contrast, poly(4-methacryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-co-2-(methacryloyloxy)-N,N,N-trimethylethane ammonium chloride) P4e, using a choline moiety as the solubility-enhancing unit, demonstrates good solution properties when prepared using a mole fraction of x4e = 0.5 and 8 mol% modifier. An apparent solution viscosity of 29 mPa s (14 wt% polymer) was obtained and, with a redox potential of 0.72 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the polymer proves to be a suitable cathode material for pRFBs. The theoretical cell voltage of a viologen/TEMPO battery is estimated to be 1.1 V.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the synthesis of methyl-viologen 1, of the styrene-based monomer 2 and of the viologen-polymer P2. The polymer was prepared employing K2S2O8 or 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ABCVA) as initiator using different comonomer ratios. Thioacetic acid was evaluated as suitable modifier (chain-transfer agent).	 

 	Fig. 1  Rheological behavior of selected viologen-homopolymers P2a with 0% and 8% modifier under continuous shear in aqueous solution (polymer concentration 41 wt%).	 

 	Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the synthesis of precursor polymer P3 and the subsequent oxidation to TEMPO-polymer P4. The polymer was prepared using ABCVA or K2S2O8 as initiator at different comonomers and modifier ratios. RAFT and free radical polymerization approaches were investigated.	 

 	Fig. 2  Rheological behavior of selected TEMPO-polymers containing the comonomer PEGMA-450 P4a and PEGMA-950 P4b under continuous shear in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1). Inset: thixotropy test of 5.6 wt% of polymer P4a at x4a = 0.22 in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1).	 

 	Fig. 3  Top: Rheological behavior of TEMPO-polymer P4e prepared without modifier (14 wt% polymer in water, Mn = 152 kg mol−1; Mw = 796 kg mol−1; x4e = 0.53). Sodium and potassium chloride (33 mmol L−1) as well as sodium sulfate (16 mmol L−1) were added to the polymer solution. Bottom: Rheological behavior of TEMPO-polymer P4e prepared with 8 mol% modifier in water or aqueous sodium chloride solution (14 wt% polymer in water, Mn = 15 kg mol−1; Mw = 37 kg mol−1; x4e = 0.50).	 

 	Fig. 4  Background-corrected cyclic voltammogram of viologen-polymer P2a (1 mg mL−1) prepared with 7 mol% modifier in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1). Inset: plot of the reduction and reoxidation peak current vs. the square root of the scan rate.	 

 		 

 		 

 	Fig. 5  Background-corrected cyclic voltammogram of TEMPO-polymer P4e (2 mg mL−1) prepared with 1 mol% modifier in aqueous sodium chloride solution (0.5 mol L−1). Inset: plot of the oxidation and rereduction peak current vs. the square root of the scan rate.
