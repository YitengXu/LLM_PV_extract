    , Accepted 19th March 2009First published on 6th April 2009AbstractA novel oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)(OPV)-fullerene dyad, with strong intermolecular π–π interactions between the donor groups, led to improvements in the fill factor and power conversion efficiency of dyad-based solar cells of up to 0.44 and 1.28%, respectively, which are the highest values reported for dyad-based solar cells to date.
Organic solar cells based on solution-processable materials such as π-conjugated oligomers, polymers, and fullerene derivatives have recently drawn much attention as an alternative energy source with low fabrication cost, light weight, and high flexibility.1,2 In state-of-the-art solution-processed organic solar cells, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures provide a large interface between donor and acceptor materials by forming nanometre-scale domains and interpenetrating networks of components (i.e. mutually percolating carrier pathways throughout the film). As a result, efficient charge separation and transport are achieved in the films, leading to high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 4–5% with the combination of π-conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives.3–5 However, the formation of such nanostructures is not well controlled in the mixture films since it is achieved by optimizing the fabrication conditions of the devices including the donor/acceptor ratio,6,7evaporation speed of the solution3,8 and thermal annealing conditions.4,5,9 Therefore, mixture BHJ systems often have low reproducibility of the appropriate nanostructure formation, and sometimes suffer from undesired structural change such as phase separation when produced on a large scale,10–13 resulting in significant reductions in performance.
Recently, much work has been done to construct appropriate nanostructures of donors and acceptors using sophisticated methods such as the introduction of inorganic nanostructures14–19 or molecular design.20–28 Covalent attachment of donor and acceptor molecules as in dyads is a promising molecular design for preventing phase separation and thus realizing efficient charge separation. In fact, the close proximity of the donor and acceptor in dyads ensures efficient charge separation, and as a result, higher photocurrents have been achieved in dyad-based solar cells compared to the corresponding mixture BHJ system.21 However, the low fill factor (FF) of dyad-based devices has limited the PCEs, probably due to insufficient charge transport under operating conditions with low internal electric fields and the resulting recombination of the charges. We have recently found that the addition of the donor component to the dyad increases the crystallinity of the films, resulting in an improvement in the FF of the devices.22 This result suggests that the introduction of a highly crystalline donor group with strong π–π interactions into the dyad would enhance intermolecular hopping of the charges and thus reduce the charge recombination.
Herein we report the synthesis of an oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)(OPV)-fullerene dyad for efficient dyad-based solar cells. The chemical structure of the dyad (1) is shown in Fig. 1a. OPV is introduced as a highly crystalline donor group and a fullerene derivative as a well-known excellent electron acceptor and transporter.29–31 A long, flexible spacer of oligo(ethylene oxide) connects the lateral position of the OPV group to the fullerene group in such a way that both groups are effectively positioned so as to enhance their interaction and thus to construct efficient charge transport pathways.
 Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of dyad 1 and OPV 2. (b) Powder XRD pattern of OPV 2. 
The dyad 1 was synthesized via the esterification reaction of OPV (2 in Fig. 1a) and a fullerene derivative with a carboxylic chloride functional group. After purification by column chromatography and HPLC, the product was identified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF-MS. The details of the synthetic schemes are available in the ESI.†
The crystallinity of the donor group was investigated prior to the introduction of the fullerene group. The powder XRD pattern of 2 in Fig. 1b shows three strong diffraction peaks with values of 2θ of 19.72°, 21.32°, and 23.45°(d-spacing of 4.5, 4.2, and 3.8 Å, respectively), which could be derived from π–π stacking of OPV groups and may suggest an ordered molecular packing such as the herringbone arrangement observed in the thin film 32 or the single crystal33 of unsubstituted OPVs. This result indicates the crystalline nature and strong π–π interactions of the OPV groups. The crystallinity of the fullerene-linked dyad 1 was also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Endothermic and exothermic peaks were observed at 192 °C (ΔH=−43.5 kJ mol−1) and 152 °C (ΔH= 36.0 kJ mol−1) in the heating and cooling processes, respectively (see ESI† ). Optical microscope observation of the sample under crossed Nicols revealed that the molecules melted at 192 °C and recrystallized at 152 °C, indicating the crystalline nature of the dyad 1. This enthalpy change is comparable with that of OPV 2(ΔH=−33.7 kJ mol−1) during its phase transition from the crystal to isotropic liquid phase, suggesting that the strong π–π interactions of the OPV groups remain in the dyad despite the introduction of the bulky fullerene groups.
The photophysical properties of dyad 1 were investigated both in CHCl3 solution and the thin film . As shown in Fig. 2a, the normalized absorption spectrum of 1 in solution revealed two distinctive peaks at 330 and 423 nm, which are due to the absorption of the fullerene groups and OPV groups, respectively. In the thin film , these peaks were red-shifted to 336 and 439 nm, respectively. The red-shift of the absorption peak from the fullerene group could be due to the Coulombic interactions of the fullerene groups and/or to structural disorder.34 The red-shift of the peak from the OPV groups could be attributed to the formation of J-aggregation of the OPV groups. This observation also supports the existence of strong π–π interactions between the OPV groups in the film as seen in the aforementioned results.

The results above suggest that efficient charge transport could possibly be obtained by applying the dyad 1 to solar cells. To investigate this notion, solar cell devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid)(PEDOT:PSS)/1/poly(dimethyl siloxane-b-methyl methacrylate)(PDMS-b-PMMA)/Al, where PDMS-b-PMMA was introduced as a buffer layer35(see ESI† ). The devices were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 1 minute under an N2 atmosphere after the deposition of the electrode. The performance of the cell was evaluated under the irradiation of simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) through a photo mask that defined an active area of 0.06 cm2. As expected, the device with dyad 1 showed an improved fill factor of 0.44, compared to our previous result of 0.23 obtained with the oligothiophene-fullerene dyad21 and the reported values of 0.2–0.3 in dyad-based solar cells evaluated under similar conditions (white light, 80 mW cm−2).24,36 With a high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V and a short circuit current (ISC) of 3.3 mA cm−2, PCE reached 1.28% as shown in Fig. 2b. This is higher than the best efficiency of 0.37% previously reported for dyad-based solar cells.37 The external quantum efficiency (see ESI† ) reached 40% at 440 nm and the calculated ISC with the EQE spectra and the solar spectrum was 3.0 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the observed ISC value.
The observed improvements in FF and PCE for the solar cell with dyad 1 can be attributed to enhanced carrier transport through the carrier pathways formed by the strong π–π interactions of the OPV groups. Although the observed FF is still lower than that of state-of-the-art polymer/fullerene BHJ devices, probably due to the insufficient percolation of the donor and acceptor network and/or improper orientation of the molecules in the film, this study clearly demonstrates the importance of the crystallinity of the donor groups for improving carrier transport in dyad-based solar cells.
In summary, the introduction of a highly crystalline OPV donor into the dyad molecule improved the efficiency of the solar cell to 1.28%, which is the highest reported value for dyad-based solar cells to date. This result demonstrates the high potential of donor–acceptor dyads as a photovoltaic material. Further optimization of the molecular design such as introduction of a low band gap donor or self-organization ability38 are promising strategies for realizing highly efficient solar cells with a single component.
