During the past few decades, many studies have demonstrated that metal complexes can act as efficient photoactive materials for photocatalytic H2 production. Here, we review the recent progress in the application of metal-complex chromophores to solar-to-H2 conversion, including metal-complex photosensitizers and supramolecular photocatalysts. A brief overview of the fundamental principles of photocatalytic H2 production is given. Then, different metal-complex photosensitizers and supramolecular photocatalysts are introduced in detail, and the most important factors that strictly determine their photocatalytic performance are also discussed. Finally, we illustrate some challenges and opportunities for future research in this promising area.

1. Introduction and historical development
The development of renewable green power sources is one of the most important scientific and technological challenges facing society today.1–4 Carbon-free hydrogen is an environmentally clean and renewable fuel and is considered an ideal candidate for an economically and socially sustainable future.5–7 Most hydrogen gas used in industry is derived from natural gas, coal, petroleum or water electrolysis. However, these conventional preparation methods are limited either by the emission of CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a by-product or by the consumption of increased electric power. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop carbon-free and low-cost preparation methods for robust and efficient hydrogen generation to support the emerging hydrogen economy.
The sun provides ca. 3 × 1024 J of usable energy per year, approximately 10000 times the current energy demand. Solar energy is therefore a viable energy resource for future economic and social development. Direct conversion of solar energy to hydrogen fuel from water via artificial photosynthesis has been considered an ideal H2 preparation pathway to mitigate the energy crisis and address the worsening environmental problems.8–10 Research on solar H2 generation is expanding very rapidly and attracting scientists from different disciplines, including (1) chemists to design and synthesize molecular chromophores and catalysts and study their structure–property relationships;11–15 (2) physicists to build semiconductor photocatalysts with novel electronic structures;16–20 and (3) materials scientists to construct unique photocatalytic materials with novel architectures and morphologies.21–25 Despite tremendous effort devoted to developing an efficient solar-to-H2 conversion system, the photocatalysis of overall water splitting to evolve H2 and O2 in a reaction system under solar radiation remains a huge challenge. Only a few photocatalytic materials reported in the literature can decompose water into H2 and O2 (eqn (1)).26–30 Photocatalytic water-splitting reactions are divided into two half-reactions: water oxidation to evolve O2 (eqn (2)) and water reduction to produce H2 (eqn (3)): 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 ΔE0 = 1.23 V(1) 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2 E0 = +1.23 V vs. NHE, pH 0(2) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2 E0 = 0 V vs. NHE, pH 0(3)
To investigate the reaction mechanism of H2 production, researchers generally develop solar H2-generation systems by replacing the water-oxidation half-reaction with an appropriate sacrificial reductant. Photosynthetic methods for solar H2 generation from water have been successfully accomplished in different forms, including using semiconductor-based devices31–35 and photoactive molecular dyes in homogeneous and multi-component systems.36–40 Homogeneous and multi-component photocatalytic H2-generation systems have attracted great interest since Lehn and Sauvage observed that light irradiation can drive H2 production in a system with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) as the chromophore, [Rh(bpy)3]3+ as the electron relay, colloidal Pt as the catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reductant.41,42 Three different photocatalytic systems, including three-, two- and single-component systems, that successfully produce H2 have been constructed. The key components of these photocatalytic H2-generating systems are shown in Fig. 1. The three-component solar H2-generation system illustrated in Fig. 1(a) was a research hotspot in the late 1970s and 1980s.41–45 In this system, an electron relay is used to accept electrons from the excited chromophore and transfer them to the catalyst, which functions as an electron mediator. In contrast to the three-component system, the two-component photocatalytic system evolves hydrogen in the absence of an electron relay species.46–50 The interest in this type of system has been rapidly increasing. The typical composition of a two-component system is shown in Fig. 1(b), in which electrons can be transferred to the catalyst from the excited chromophore for H2-evolution reaction, thereby simplifying the H2-evolution system. However, in these three- and two-component systems, the electron-transfer processes depend on many factors that are difficult to control. With the aim of controlling the electron-transfer processes, supramolecular photocatalysts in which the light-harvesting unit is coupled with a catalytic center have been designed in recent years (Fig. 1(c)). In such a supramolecular photocatalyst, intramolecular electron transfer from the photoactivated unit to the catalytic center can potentially be controlled, resulting in more efficient charge transfer for solar H2 generation. Interestingly, the chromophore component in both three- and two-component photocatalytic H2 systems was used as the photosensitizer (PS) to capture light. In addition, the supramolecular metal complex in the single-component system is obviously used as the photocatalyst, which not only absorbs light for the photocatalytic reaction but also reduces protons to evolve H2.

In these H2-evolution systems, the first step is photon capture by a light-harvesting chromophore, that is, a chromophore analogous to the photosynthetic pigments.38–42 The chromophore should efficiently absorb and convert the incident photon into an excited state that can transfer/accept an electron to/from an acceptor/donor for the creation of a charge-separated state, which generates the required thermodynamic driving force for the proton reduction reaction. The chromophore is essential for efficient light harvesting and excited electron generation and transfer, which is one of the most important factors in determining the overall efficiency of a photocatalytic H2 generation system. Many different types of chromophores, including metal-free organic dyes,36 metal complexes,41,51,52 and functionalized metal–organic-framework materials,53 have been constructed and applied to solar H2 generation in the past four decades. Among them, metal-free organic dyes and metal complexes have been widely investigated as chromophores for photocatalytic H2 production. However, these photocatalytic H2-evolution systems that use metal-free organic dyes as chromophores typically suffer from short lifetimes due to photodegradation of the organic dyes. Compared to organic dyes, metal complexes have much higher stability due to the strong coupling effects between metals and their ligands.54 Therefore, the development of highly efficient metal-complex chromophores is a popular research subject in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.
Great progress has been made in the field of artificial photosynthesis, and review papers have reported advances in semiconductor photocatalysts,55,56 inorganic co-catalysts,57 and metal-complex hydrogen-evolution catalysts58,59 in heterogeneous or homogeneous systems for photocatalytic H2 production. Recent review papers have also addressed metal-complex photosensitizers for solar cells,60,61 dye-sensitized H2 production,62 photocatalytic organic synthesis,63 photoelectrochemical water splitting,64 and photocatalytic water oxidation.65 However, no comprehensive review has discussed the recent development of metal-complex chromophores for solar H2 generation applications, and we believe that an in-depth review on this subject is timely to promote further developments in the field of photocatalysis. In this report, we systematically review the recent and significant scientific progress in the field of solar H2 generation relevant to metal-complex chromophores. The relationship between photocatalytic performance and the molecular structure of the metal complexes is emphasized. In contrast to previous reviews,55–59 in which semiconductor photocatalytic materials and molecular H2-evolution catalysts were reviewed in detail, the present review provides a summary and review of the progress toward metal-complex chromophores for solar H2 generation. We summarize different metal-complex chromophores, including metal-complex photosensitizers (PSs, such as Ru(II), Ir(III), Pt(II), Au(III), Re(I), and Cu(I) complexes, as well as zinc porphyrin complexes) and supramolecular photocatalysts (such as Ru(II)–Pt(II), Ru(II)–Pd(II), Ru(II)–Rh(III), Ru(II)–Co(II), Os(II)–Rh(III), Ir(III)–Co(II) and Zn(II)–Co(II) complexes), which have been intensively investigated for solar H2 generation. A discussion of the design and optimization of metal-complex chromophores is sequentially presented in the subsequent section. In the final section, future challenges and perspectives in research on photoactive metal complexes are also presented. The aim of this review is to provide promising design principles for the future development of novel metal-complex chromophores for solar H2 generation.
2. Fundamental mechanistic aspects
2.1 Photophysical properties of metal-complex chromophores
During photocatalytic H2 production reaction processes, solar energy is absorbed by the chromophore component. Therefore, the role of the chromophore is to harvest light and trigger a cascade of electron-transfer reactions. For metal-complex chromophores, light absorption is associated with three main types of electronic transitions: metal-centered (MC), ligand centered (LC), and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). The MLCT state of the metal complex plays a key role in photocatalytic reactions. For example, in the commonly used octahedral d6 metal polypyridine complex, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) corresponds to the metal-localized t2g-orbitals, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is the antibonding π*-orbital localized on the ligands. Under visible-light irradiation, an electron in one of the metal-centered t2g orbitals is promoted to a ligand-centered π* orbital, resulting in the MLCT state illustrated in Fig. 2.54 As a result, the redox potentials of the metal complexes can be dramatically altered. As illustrated in eqn (4) and (5), the excited-state oxidation and reduction potentials are generally estimated by subtracting and adding, respectively, the energy of the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) from and to the ground-state potentials.63 Thus, the excited metal complexes are better oxidants and better reductants than their electronic ground states and can carry more thermodynamic driving force for the charge-transfer reactions. Based on the photoinduced redox-potential changes and the long-lived lifetime of the excited state, metal complexes have been intensively investigated as chromophores for photocatalytic H2 production. E(S+/S*) = E(S+/S) − E0–0(4) E(S*/S−) = E(S/S−) + E0–0(5)

2.2 Catalytic cycle of the chromophore
An essential feature of any photocatalytic H2-production system is the absorption of light by the chromophore to create an electronically excited state. The excited chromophore can be quenched by either an electron donor or an electron acceptor through a reductive or oxidative reaction pathway to generate a ground state. The typical reaction mechanisms in a photocatalytic system composed of a chromophore, a catalyst and a sacrificial reagent are shown in Fig. 3. The reductive quenching of the excited chromophore involves electron transfer from the sacrificial reagent, which generates the reduced form of the chromophore (S−). This form is then able to transfer an electron to the hydrogen-evolution catalyst (Cat) and return to its ground state (S). In the oxidative quenching pathway, the excited chromophore is oxidized by the hydrogen-evolution catalyst to form the oxidized species (S+), which is then reduced by the sacrificial reagent to return to its original state before repeating the cycle. Through these processes, the catalyst can drive the reduction of protons to yield hydrogen molecules.

2.3 General requirements for metal-complex chromophores
Many factors can affect the photocatalytic performance of chromophores for H2 production. Some general requirements for the design and construction of efficient metal-complex chromophores for solar H2 generation are as follows. (1) Because visible light is more than 47% of the solar spectrum, metal-complex chromophores should display a very broad absorption range with a high molar extinction coefficient (ε), particularly in the visible light region. (2) The excited chromophores should exhibit suitable redox potentials for electron transfer from the sacrificial reductant to the catalyst. For the reductive quenching process, the redox potentials of the chromophore, catalyst, and sacrificial reagent should adhere to the following trends: E(S/S−) < E(Cat/Cat−) < E(H+/H2) and E(S*/S−) > E(SR+/SR). If the excited chromophore is quenched by an oxidation process, the redox potentials of the same key components should exhibit the following trends: E(S+/S*) < E(Cat/Cat−) < E(H+/H2) and E(SR+/SR) < E(S+/S). (3) The length of the excited state lifetime of the chromophore should be sufficient for the charge transfer reaction. (4) The photostability of the chromophore should be sufficiently high to ensure a long-term operation in the solar H2 generation system. (5) The chromophore should have good solubility in water and/or commonly used organic solvents to ensure that photocatalytic H2 generation occurs at the molecular level.
3. Metal-complex photosensitizers for photocatalytic H2 production
3.1 Ruthenium complex photosensitizers
[Ru(bpy)3]2+ has been the most well-studied metal-complex PS for electron transfer reactions since the ability of its excited state to transfer electrons to an electron acceptor was discovered in the early 1970s.66–71 This finding opened new avenues of research, and the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex has received significant attention in the field of photosynthesis. The [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex appears to be a suitable PS for electron transfer reactions, mainly due to the following factors illustrated in Fig. 4. (1) It exhibits an intense absorption spectrum continuously extended throughout the range of visible light (λmax = 452 nm in aqueous solution). (2) The lifetime of photoexcited [Ru(bpy)3]2+* is sufficiently long (τ = 1.1 μs), a crucial factor in determining its reactivity for the electron transfer reaction. (3) The photoexcited [Ru(bpy)3]2+* species has the remarkable property of being both more reducing and more oxidizing than the ground state species [E(Ru3+/Ru2+*) = −0.81 V vs. SCE, E(Ru2+*/Ru+) = 0.77 V vs. SCE] (SCE: saturated calomel electrode).63
 Fig. 4  Chemical structure and basic properties of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The absorption spectrum and excited lifetime of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ were measured in acetonitrile solution at room temperature;66 the redox potentials of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ were determined in acetonitrile by using a calomel electrode as the reference electrode at room temperature.67 
In 1977, the first application of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to photocatalytic H2 production was reported by Sauvage's group in a [Ru(bpy)3]2+–[Rh(bpy)3]3+–Pt–TEOA system.41 As shown in Fig. 5, the H2 evolution processes contain two catalytic cycles: a Ru(II) cycle and a Rh(III) cycle. During the Ru(II) cycle, [Ru(bpy)3]2+* is oxidatively quenched by [Rh(bpy)3]3+ to form the [Ru(bpy)3]3+ species, which is converted back to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ by oxidization of TEOA. The Rh(III) cycle first involves the formation of [Rh(bpy)2]+ from [Rh(bpy)3]3+, followed by two-electron reduction and ligand dissociation. In this cycle, the Rh(I) bis-bipyridyl species may be the key active species for forming hydrogen.42 In such a catalytic system, the electron relay, the [Rh(bpy)3]3+ complex, is used to shuttle electrons from the PS to the catalyst. In addition to [Rh(bpy)3]3+, the metal-free methylviologen (MV2+) was also found to act as an active relay species.44 More importantly, Sauvage's group determined that [Rh(bpy)3]3+ can act as both the electron relay and the catalyst in a [Ru(bpy)3]2+–[Rh(bpy)3]3+–TEOA system with a maximum turnover number (TON = 2n(H2)/n(PS)) of 500, which was obtained under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm, 150 W halogen lamp).42 Importantly, this observation simplifies the photocatalytic H2 production system to a photocatalytic system consisting of only a photosensitizer, catalyst and sacrificial reductant.
 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+–[Rh(bpy)3]3+–Pt–TEOA system for photocatalytic H2 production. 
In the aforementioned [Ru(bpy)3]2+–[Rh(bpy)3]3+–Pt–TEOA and [Ru(bpy)3]2+–MV2+–Pt–TEOA photocatalytic systems, [Rh(bpy)3]3+ and MV2+ were used as the electron relay to transfer photoexcited electrons from [Ru(bpy)3]2+* to the Pt catalyst for the water reduction reaction.41,44 However, most photocatalytic H2 production systems suffer from low catalytic performance. To improve the photocatalytic activity, acceptor-linked PS systems in which the ruthenium complex moiety was bound to the MV2+ acceptor were developed. Unfortunately, intramolecular electron transfer from the photoexcited ruthenium complex moiety to the MV2+ acceptor competes with rapid electron transfer from the acceptor back to the ruthenium complex moiety, leading to a short-lived charge-separated state.72–74 The suppression of the back electron transfer from the MV2+ acceptor to the ruthenium complex moiety is the most crucial factor in achieving a long-lived charge-separated state, and the charge separation can be stabilized using a multistep electron transfer in a series of acceptors arranged in a manner analogous to that of the electron transfer chain. Okura et al. designed a series of bisviologen-linked Ru(II) complexes (2–5, in Fig. 6), [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)CmVACnVB]6+ [dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine; 2 (m = 2, n = 3); 3 (m = 3, n = 4)], [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)CmVACn]4+ [4 (m = 2, n = 3); 5 (m = 3, n = 4)], for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a reductant and hydrogenase as the catalyst.75 PS 2 and 3, in which two viologens with different redox potentials are connected covalently to the ruthenium complex moiety, are suitable compounds for effective photocatalytic production of H2. Luminescence lifetime measurements demonstrated that the electron transfer from the photoexcited state of the ruthenium complex moiety is more rapid to the bound bisviologen in 2 and 3 than to the monoviologen-linked ruthenium complexes (4 and 5), indicating that the two-step electron transfer from the photoexcited ruthenium complex moiety to the acceptor efficiently suppresses the back electron transfer. Unfortunately, the results revealed that PS 2 and 3 exhibit low activities, with H2 evolution rates of 0.216 and 0.424 μmol L−1 s−1, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Molecular structures of covalently linked [Ru(bpy)32+–MV2+] complexes for photoinduced H2 generation. 
Recent reports by Sakai et al. have shown that the charge-separated state of such systems is substantially raised by the electromigration effect. [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivatives, in which each bpy of a single [Ru(bpy)3]2+ fragment attaches with four dicationic viologen acceptors (6 and 7, in Fig. 6), were designed and investigated as photo-charge-separators.76 These complexes show outstanding performance in single-pigment-driven multi-electron transfer and storage. The multiple electrons are collected over these pendant viologen moieties. The stored electrons interact with protons, leading to H2 production from water in the presence of a colloidal Pt catalyst and EDTA (EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt) as an electron donor. The results show that the initial rate of H2 formation promoted by 6 (turnover frequency (TOF) = 157 H2 h−1) and 7 (TOF = 47.8 H2 h−1) is clearly higher than that of 8 which has a single 5,5′-MV48+ chelate (TOF = 1.7 H2 h−1). The results reveal that the molecular architecture has an important effect on the multi-electron transfer and storage as well as on the performance of photocatalytic H2 evolution. To further explore the relationship between the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate and the concentration of the acceptor site, another three [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivatives (9–11) were prepared.77 The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate proves to be strongly dependent on the concentration of the acceptor site.
In most of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based photocatalytic H2 evolution systems, the excited state of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is oxidatively quenched by an electron relay.41,42 There are two different quenching pathways: reductive quenching by a sacrificial reductant and oxidative quenching by an electron relay or catalyst. Wu's group constructed a [Ru(bpy)3]2+–[FeFe]H2ase–H2A ([FeFe]H2ase = [FeFe] hydrogenase; H2A = ascorbic acid) photocatalytic H2 evolution system in which the photoexcited [Ru(bpy)3]2+* is reductively quenched by H2A.78 The free energy change (ΔG) of the oxidative quenching process is 0.47 eV, and thus electron transfer from the excited [Ru(bpy)3]2+* to [FeFe]H2ase is thermodynamically unfeasible. However, the photoexcited [Ru(bpy)3]2+* can be reductively quenched by H2A because the thermodynamic driving force for the electron transfer from H2A to [Ru(bpy)3]2+* is strong (ΔG = −0.23 eV). Eisenberg and coworkers described a H2 evolution system that is stable when irradiated with visible light in aqueous mixtures using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the PS, [Ni(P2PhN2Ph)2](BF4)2 as the catalyst and H2A as the sacrificial reductant. This H2 evolution system produces a TON of 945 with respect to the PS over 150 h of visible light irradiation.79 Unfortunately, the PS decomposes rapidly by a presumed unimolecular path due to the poor photostability of the PS. That is, when the PS is in the reduced state (PS−), the ligand dissociates from the complex because the electrons populate the antibonding LUMO. Douglas et al. developed an artificial hydrogenase of Pt–Hsp protein cage composites using a biomimetic approach for visible-light-driven H2 production coupled with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the PS, MV2+ as the electron transfer mediator, and EDTA as the sacrificial reductant. The H2 evolution rates of the system exceed the production rates of other reported Pt-based nanoparticle catalysts.80 Numerous other successful H2 evolution systems have been constructed utilizing [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the PS in combination with different catalysts, such as [Co(bdt)2]− (bdt = 1,2-benzenedithiolate),81 {(μ-SCH2)2X}[Fe(CO)3]2 (X = CH2 or NCH2C6H5),82 colloidal MoS2,83 and so on, but the performance and stability of these systems are still low.
3.2 Iridium complex photosensitizers
Although [Ru(bpy)3]2+ has strong absorption in the visible region, most [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based photocatalytic H2 production systems suffer from poor durability probably due to the consumption of [Ru(bpy)3]2+.79,83 The poor photostability of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is attributable to the low-lying triplet metal centered (3MC) excited state. Further compounding the detrimental effect of the short-lived and accessible 3MC excited state, its populated anti-bonding molecular orbital weakens the metal–ligand bond, resulting in PS degradation via ligand dissociation.84 Therefore, novel PSs with high stability for robust and efficient photocatalytic H2 production systems are highly desirable. In an effort to alleviate the limitation of the 3MC state, third-row transition metals such as iridium and platinum have been studied as potentially more tunable photosensitizers because their greater ligand field splitting allows for a broader range of populated/unpopulated molecular orbital gap energies. As a consequence of the greater ligand-field stabilization energy (LFSE), the use of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes can avoid the thermal population of the dissociative 3MC state observed with tris-diimine Ru(II) complexes.85 Additionally, the cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes exhibit improved luminescence properties, i.e., high intensities, long excited-state lifetimes in the μs time range, and tunable emission wavelengths, compared to [Ru(bpy)3]2+. Due to these unique photophysical properties, Ir(III) complexes have been widely investigated in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),86,87 light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs),88,89 oxygen sensors,90 and bioimaging.91,92 Some of the recently developed iridium complexes as PSs for photocatalytic H2 generation are listed in Table 1.

Bernhard and coworkers reported an efficient photocatalytic H2-production system utilizing an Ir(III) complex as the PS, [Co(bpy)3]2+ as the electron relay and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant in 2005.93,94 The excellent results show that all Ir(III) complexes (12–17, shown in Fig. 7) act as much more efficient PSs than the commonly utilized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ (dmphen = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) PSs. As shown in Fig. 8, PS 15 has a relative quantum efficiency of H2 production up to 37 times greater than that of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. In addition, these Ir(III) complexes have large molar extinction coefficients (to efficiently collect radiant energy) and relatively long excited-state lifetimes (to allow electron-transfer quenching to occur), which are desirable for photocatalytic H2 production. In the Ir(III)–[Co(bpy)3]2+–TEOA system, the [Co(bpy)3]2+ component is used as both an electron relay and the H2-evolution catalyst. The choice of the electron relay is crucial to the success of a photocatalytic system; an excellent relay can quench the excited PS and create charge separation at the cost of reducing the system. In 2007, the same group developed a photocatalytic H2 production system using [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine; 12) as the PS, colloid Pt nanoparticles as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant in the absence of an electron mediator. Such a system that does not include an electron mediator is inherently simpler and thus easier to study the chemical kinetics of the reaction.95

To develop highly efficient Ir(III) PSs for photocatalytic H2-generation systems, the relationship between the structure and properties of these complicated systems must be elucidated. Bernhard et al. synthesized the library of structural derivatives of [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (12, 15, 18–30) illustrated in Fig. 9 and investigated the correlation between structure and catalytic performance in the presence of colloidal Pd as a catalyst and triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial reductant.96 The Pd catalyst was selected instead of the previously used Pt catalyst because its activity is sustained over the course of illumination, whereas the Pt catalyst undergoes degradation. The consistent activity of the Pd catalyst facilitates a more direct study of the correlation between Ir(III) PS durability and observed H2 production. The excellent results illustrated in Fig. 10 demonstrated that the deliberate steric and electronic variations of the ppy and bpy moieties result in a dramatic decrease in the degradation rates, and the inclusion of steric bulk and electropositive N∧N ligand substituents into the PS structures is thus an efficient method to improve the durability of the Ir(III) PS in photocatalytic H2-production systems.

Recently, the introduction of vinyl moieties into the Ir(III) PSs (31–42, in Fig. 11) was found to be an effective method to improve the interaction between the photosensitizer and the colloidal Pt catalyst, thus resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance.97 Although the emission quantum yields and the lifetimes of the Ir(III) complexes with vinyl moieties (31–38) are lower than those of the non-vinyl derivatives (39–42), these vinyl-modified Ir(III) PSs exhibit superior activities for photocatalytic H2 production.
 Fig. 11  Molecular structures of Ir(III) complex PSs incorporated with one or two polymerizable vinyl moieties (31–38) and references (39–42). 
The most robust vinyl system was obtained when using the [Ir(fmppy)2(mVbpy)]+ (fmppy = 5-methyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine; mVbpy = 4-vinyl-4′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine) complex (31) as the PS, colloidal Pt as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant, and the TON with respect to the Ir(III) PS is up to 8500. The higher stability and activity of the Ir(III) complexes with vinyl moieties are attributable to the interaction of the vinyl moieties with the colloidal Pt formed in situ, which dramatically accelerates the H2 evolution rate and enhances the longevity of the photocatalytic system. Bernhard et al. prepared a series of novel Ir(III) PSs with pendant pyridyl moieties (43–52, in Fig. 12), which allow these Ir(III) PSs to assemble onto the colloidal Pt catalyst during H2-production reactions.98 These new Ir(III) PSs significantly outperform the control PSs without adsorbing moieties (53–60) for H2 production. As shown in Fig. 13, the [Ir(tolppy)2(dethqpy)]+ (tolppy = 2-p-tolylpyridine; dethqpy = 4,4′-bis(2-(pyridin-4-yl)ethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine) PS (48) exhibits the highest TON of 8800 in the presence of K2PtCl4 as the catalyst and TEA as the sacrificial reductant under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The superior performance of Ir(III) PSs with pendant pyridine moieties is attributable to the spatial linkage of the Ir(III) PS to the colloidal Pt surface. Consequently, the Ir(III) PS with pendant pyridine moieties is more likely to transfer its reducing electrons to the colloidal Pt catalyst, thus efficiently preventing the decomposition of the reduced Ir(III) PS through ligand dissociation. Fang et al. reported that the –CHO group on the bipyridyl ligand of Ir(III) PSs (61 and 62, in Fig. 14) can also improve the interaction between the Ir(III) PS and the Pt catalyst.99 A high TON of 6364 for the Ir(III) PS is obtained in a three-component photocatalytic H2 system containing PS 61, the TEA reductant and a colloidal Pt catalyst, much higher than that of non-formyl bipyridyl Ir(III) PS (18).

In these photocatalytic H2-evolution systems, the solvent environment often plays a critical role in determining performance and stability. The electrostatic properties of the solvent can influence electron transfer between the PS and catalyst. More importantly, the ligation ability of the solvent can affect the reaction by stabilizing or destabilizing key redox intermediates. Most photocatalytic H2-evolution reactions have been conducted in mixed solutions of water and organic solvents, with the volume fraction of the organic solvent typically higher than 50%.93–95 This composition represents a compromise between the benefit of the lower dielectric constant at high organic solvent concentrations and the need for water as a proton source for H2 generation. In addition, most Ir(III) PSs are insoluble in water but are soluble in commonly used organic solvents, such as acetonitrile (ACN), acetone (ACE), dimethyl formamide (DMF), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), further promoting the use of high concentrations of organic solvents in photocatalytic systems. The utilization of organic solvents in photocatalytic H2-generation reactions increases the complexity of these systems. In an effort to develop organic-solvent-free photocatalytic H2-generation systems, our group designed a new series of zwitterionic Ir(III) complexes [Ir(phenylbenzothiazole)2(4-carboxy-2,2′-bipyridine-4′-carboxylate) and its derivatives] (63–67, in Fig. 15) as PSs for visible-light-driven H2 production in water in the presence of colloidal Pt as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.100,101 These Ir(III) PSs are water soluble due to the N∧N ligand with a carboxyl substituent group. Photocatalytic H2-production systems that use only water as the reaction medium are successfully constructed, and the highest TON of 1501 is obtained with PS 63 in a neutral aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).

Cationic Ir(III) complexes can act as highly efficient PSs for photocatalytic H2 production, particularly derivatives of [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+.93–95 Unfortunately, these cationic Ir(III) PSs are limited by their poor photostability resulting from degradation. That is, the bipyridyl ligand can dissociate from the reduced Ir(III) PS (PS−) due to electrons populating the antibonding LUMO.98 The free sites on the iridium metal are then occupied by coordinating solvent molecules, forming an ineffective PS. A related study has suggested that the use of weakly coordinating solvents to replace strong-coordinating solvents is an efficient method to improve the photostability of Ir(III) PSs.98,102 Furthermore, there has been increasing interest in the development of other novel techniques for preventing the deactivation of Ir(III) PSs. Bernhard et al. reported a more rigid and substitution-inert complex of bis-tridentate Ir(III) complex [Ir(phbpy)2]+ (phbpy = 6-phenyl-2,2′-bipyridine; 68, in Fig. 16) as a novel PS for photocatalytic H2 production. This [Ir(C∧N∧N)2]+-type (C∧N∧N = cyclometalating diimine ligand) PS exhibits much higher activity and stability than the commonly used [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ PS for photocatalytic H2 evolution.102 The improved stability of [Ir(C∧N∧N)2]+-type PS may be attributable to the enhanced octahedral geometry. That is, the incorporated ligand architectures may efficiently prevent dissociative deactivation. The results indicate that ligand modification is also a successful strategy for tuning the photostability of Ir(III) PS.

In another study, Park et al. synthesized a series of [IrIII(C∧N)2(N∧N)]+-type (C∧N = monoanionic cyclometalating ligand and N∧N = neutral diimine ligand) PSs with bulky triphenylsilyl (TPS) substituent groups (69–72, in Fig. 17) as highly stable PSs for photocatalytic H2 production.103 As shown in Fig. 18, highly efficient systems for hydrogen production were constructed using these TPS-modified Ir(III) complexes as the PSs, Pt colloid as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant. IrTPS (69) and FIrTPS (70) exhibit total TON values of 17000 and 10000, respectively, which are much higher than those of [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (12) and [Ir(dfppy)2(bpy)]+ (dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-pyridine) PSs. The highly improved stability of the PSs with TPS moieties is attributable to their bulkier substituent groups, which presumably minimize the accessibility of the iridium center to the solvent and thus prevent undesired photodecomposition of PS. More importantly, IrTPS (69) exhibits the highest TON for water-reduction catalysis with Ir(III) PSs reported to date. These results also provide important new strategies for the design of more durable systems in various areas of photochemistry.

Although Bernhard and Park have recently made some progress in improving the stability of Ir(III) PSs by introducing vinyl,97 pendant pyridyl,98 or bulky TPS groups,103 these molecular platforms do not provide a long-term and effective solution for the design of stable Ir(III) PSs. For most recently reported cationic Ir(III) PSs, the excited PS (PS*) is reductively quenched, leading to unstable radical anions that undergo decomposition. Therefore, the development of new Ir(III) PSs with excited states that can be quenched via an oxidative pathway would be of great value for obtaining long-lived solar H2-generation systems. Our group described two new charge-neutral Ir(III) complexes (73 and 74, in Fig. 19) for H2 production, and this new class of Ir(III) PSs enables the photocatalytic generation of H2 from mixed aqueous solutions via an oxidative quenching pathway in the presence of a [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ (dtbbpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl) catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.104 More importantly, these systems display long-term photostability under constant illumination over 72 h with a total TON of 1880 for PS 73.
 Fig. 19  Cyclometalated Ir(III) PSs (73–82) for photocatalytic H2 production designed by Yu's group. 
For cationic Ir(III) PSs, the rapid decrease in photocatalytic H2 activity within a few hours can be attributed to the deactivation of the reduced PS (PS−). During the reaction processes, the Ir–N coordination bonds between the metal center and the ancillary diimine N∧N ligand of the PS− are broken, leading to dissociation of the ancillary diimine ligand from the PS and a loss of H2-generation activity. Recently, our group reported a new series of neutral tricyclometalated Ir(III) PSs, [Ir(thpy)2(bt)] (thpy = 2,2′-thienylpyridine, bt = 2-phenylbenzothiazole and its derivatives, 75–78, in Fig. 19). These PSs undergo a visible-light-induced process leading to H2 production in a homogeneous system using [Co(bpy)3]2+ as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.105 The excellent results demonstrate that the replacement of an Ir–N dative bond with an Ir–C sigma bond in these neutral Ir(III) PSs is an effective way to prevent ligand dissociation from the iridium center.
As shown in Fig. 20, a long-running test for photocatalytic H2 production demonstrates that the neutral Ir(III) PSs exhibit superior durability during the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction, and H2 gas is still observed upon irradiation for up to 500 h. The higher stability of neutral cyclometalated Ir(III) PSs compared to cationic Ir(III) PSs can be assigned to the stronger ligand field of the C∧N ligands compared to the N∧N coordinating ligand. Unfortunately, these neutral Ir(III) PSs exhibit poor performance for photocatalytic H2 generation in PS–[Co(bpy)3]2+–TEOA systems, and PS 77 achieves the highest TON of 602 after 72 h of visible-light irradiation in these experiments. Additional neutral Ir(III) PSs for solar H2 generation have also been sought. To further optimize the efficiency of the photocatalytic H2-generation system based on neutral tricyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, our group developed a series of simple, homoleptic tris-cyclometalated Ir(III) PSs Ir(C∧N)3 (HC∧N = 2-phenylpyridine and its derivatives; 80–82 shown in Fig. 19) for photocatalytic H2 production in the presence of [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.106 The PS–[Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+–TEOA system displays a long lifetime of greater than 72 h, and the highest H2 TON based on the neutral Ir(III) PS (80) is up to 3040. The highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 2.59% for H2 evolution is obtained at 380 nm with Ir(ppy)3 (80) and is approximately twice that obtained using the photocatalytic system based on PS 77. Compared to the commonly used cationic Ir(III) PS of [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+, all neutral Ir(III) complexes exhibit much higher activities and longer lifetimes, which can be attributed to the increased number of Ir–C bonds and the oxidative quenching process. As shown in Fig. 21, for the cationic [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ PS, the excited PS is quenched by TEOA via a reductive quenching pathway. However, for neutral Ir(III) PS, the excited PS is quenched by the Rh(III) catalyst via an oxidative quenching pathway, which effectively avoids the unstable radical anions of the reduced PS. This research progress may contribute greatly to the development of novel PSs with long lifetimes and high activity for solar H2 generation.

 Fig. 21  Reaction mechanisms of the PS–Rh(III)–TEOA systems for neutral and cationic Ir(III) PSs. For neutral Ir(III) PSs (80–82), the PS* was quenched by [Rh(dtbbpy)3](PF6)3 through an oxidative quenching pathway; for cationic Ir(III) complex [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (12), the PS* was quenched by TEOA through a reductive quenching pathway. 
Clearly, the exploration of Ir(III) PSs with new structural modifications aimed at improving the efficiency of solar H2-generation systems is worth pursuing to further our understanding of structure–property relationships. Our group developed an efficient photocatalytic H2-evolution system based on new dinuclear Ir(III) PSs (83 and 84, in Fig. 22).107 The TON is up to 3780 for the dinuclear Ir(III) PS 83 together with [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant in a mixed-solvent solution of 9:1 acetone–water. The observed activity is superior to that of mononuclear Ir(III) PSs (85–87, in Fig. 22). The excellent results indicate that the photocatalytic activity is enhanced by using dinuclear Ir(III) complexes as PSs with intense absorption in the visible region.
 Fig. 22  Dinuclear Ir(III) PSs contained the bibenzimidazole ligand (83–84) and references (85–87) for photocatalytic H2 production. 
In photocatalytic H2-production systems, the PS and catalyst are the two most important components determining the overall efficiency of the reaction systems. For example, in the [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+–[Co(bpy)3]2+–TEOA system,93,94 the Co(II) catalyst is the weak component due to its poor activity and instability, leading to the rapid deterioration and limited overall efficiency of the system. Therefore, the development of more efficient catalysts is very important to improve the stability and efficiency of H2-evolution systems. Bernhard et al. reported an efficient homogeneous photocatalytic system for visible-light-driven H2 production utilizing cationic Ir(III) complexes (88–90, in Fig. 23) as the PSs and [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ as the catalyst.108 As shown in Fig. 24, the excellent results indicate that [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ is an ideal candidate for the catalyst component in homogeneous photocatalytic H2-evolution systems because it accumulates two electrons at a suitable potential for water reduction. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the Ir(III)–Rh(III)–TEOA photocatalytic system achieves a TON of 5000 with respect to the Ir(III) PS, and the quantum yield is up to 34%. Beweries et al. reported new visible-light-driven H2-production systems containing an Ir(III) as the PS, a Pd complex catalyst and TEA as the sacrificial reductant.109 A high AQY of 12.3% is obtained under 440 nm using [Ir(fmppy)2(bpy)]+ (24) as the PS and [Pd(PPh3)Cl2]2 as the catalyst. More importantly, no degradation of the PS occurs within the first 25 h in water–acetonitrile mixtures.

In Ir(III)-based photocatalytic H2-production systems, the most efficient catalysts are noble metal colloids and noble metal complexes.96,98,103 Clearly, with respect to applicability and cost, there is a general and strong demand for the substitution of noble metals by earth-abundant catalysts based on, for example, iron and nickel. Recently, Beller's group demonstrated that cheap and readily available iron carbonyl [Fe3(CO)12] can act as an efficient catalyst for H2 generation in combination with [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (12) as the PS and TEA as the sacrificial reductant.110,111 The system displays high H2-evolution activity under visible-light irradiation, and the TONs are up to 400 and 3035 for the [Fe3(CO)12] catalyst and Ir(III) PS, respectively. After optimizing the structure of both the iron carbonyl catalyst and the Ir(III) PSs (91–102, in Fig. 25), a maximum AQY value of 16.4% at 440 nm is obtained in the 91–[HNEt3][HFe3(CO)11]/PR3–TEA (PR3 = P[C6H3-(CF3)2]3) system.112,113 In another study, Wang et al. reported a photocatalytic system composed of [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (12) as the PS, a bioinspired diiron complex [{(μ-SCH2)2NCH2C6H5}{Fe(CO)3}{Fe(CO)2P(Pyr)3}] (Pyr = tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine) as the catalyst, and TEA as the sacrificial reductant, which proves to be catalytically active for visible-light-driven H2 production.114 After optimizing the reaction conditions, the total TONs are up to 660 based on the Ir(III) PS and 132 based on the diiron catalyst over 8 h of irradiation. Another study demonstrated that the combination of cobalt diimine–dioxime complexes with a cyclometalated Ir(III) PS 12 produces efficient systems for H2 production under visible-light irradiation using TEA as the sacrificial reductant.115 Unfortunately, this system demonstrates poor performance for H2 evolution with a lifetime of less than 4 h and a low TON of 696 for the Ir(III) PS.

In recent years, the utilization of nickel complexes in the field of photocatalytic H2 production has attracted intense interest.116–121 Bernhard et al. reported the use of a noble-metal-free nickel thiolate cluster, Ni6(SCH2CH2Ph)12, as the catalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation. The water reduction property of the Ni6(SCH2CH2Ph)12 catalyst is evaluated by using [Ir(fmppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ (24) as the PS and TEA as the sacrificial reductant.122 The H2 evolution system performs optimally at 300 μM PS and 25 μM catalyst, with a maximum TON and turnover frequency (TOF) of 3750 and 970 TON h−1, respectively. Hill et al. developed dinickel-containing sandwich-type [Ni2(P2W15O56)2]20− and trinickel-containing [Ni3(OH)3(H2O)3P2W16O59]9− catalysts for photocatalytic H2 production with [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ (20) as the PS and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant, but the system exhibits low activity, with a TON of 29 for the PS.123 A tris-(2,2′-bipyridine) nickel complex ([Ni(bpy)3]2+) and neutral nickel(II) phthalocyanine (NiPc) have also been identified as active catalysts for H2 generation in the presence of [Ir(dfppy)2(Hdcbpy)] (103) as the PS and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.124,125 Unfortunately, the Ir(III)–[Ni(bpy)3]2+–TEOA and Ir(III)–NiPc–TEOA systems exhibit low activities for H2 production, with TON of 12 and 23 for Ir(III) PS, respectively.
Molecular catalysts for homogeneous photocatalytic H2-production systems are limited by their poor stability, increasing the significance of exploiting earth-abundant and stable catalysts. Few reports have demonstrated that noble-metal-free inorganic catalysts can match Ir(III) PSs for photocatalytic H2 generation. In 2014, Yu et al. reported the utilization of a “water-soluble” MoS2 catalyst for photocatalytic water reduction systems in the presence of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes as the PSs (104–109, in Fig. 26) and H2A/TEA as the sacrificial reductant in a methanol–water mixed solution (Fig. 27).126 The MoS2 catalyst exhibits much higher catalytic activity than other commonly used catalysts such as K2PtCl4, [Co(bpy)3]Cl2, [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+, and [Co(dmgH)2(H2O)Cl] (dmgH2 = dimethylglyoxime) under the same reaction conditions. The Ir(III)–MoS2–H2A system exhibits a high AQY of 12.4% for H2 evolution using monochromatized light of λ = 400 nm. MoS2 has been reported as an excellent proton-reduction catalyst in semiconductor-based photocatalytic reactions due to the existence of several exposed sulfur edges from which the active sites stemmed.127–134 These studies advocate further exploration of stable catalysts by introducing “water-soluble” inorganic compounds for photocatalytic H2 production.

3.3 Platinum complex photosensitizers
Colloidal Pt has been widely used as a catalyst in both Ru(II)- and Ir(III)-based systems.44,103 In addition, Pt(II) complexes can act as efficient PSs for H2 production. In 2006, Eisenberg's group reported the use of a [Pt(terpy)(arylacetylide)]+ (terpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) complex (110, in Fig. 28) as the chromophore for visible-light-driven H2 production from aqueous protons in the presence of MV2+ as the electron relay, colloidal Pt as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.135 In this photocatalytic system, the absence of any one of the components yields unobservable to insignificant amounts of H2, indicating that all components are essential for H2 generation. The reaction mechanism for light-driven reduction of aqueous protons by the Pt(II)–MV2+–Pt–TEOA system is similar to that of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+–MV2+–Pt–TEOA system. The results reveal that the PS–MV2+–Pt–TEOA system produces a TON of 84 for H2 with respect to the Pt(II) PS after 10 h of visible-light irradiation (λ > 410 nm). This study was the first to use a platinum terpyridyl complex in this capacity. In an effort to develop highly efficient light-driven H2 generation systems based on Pt(II) PSs, metal complexes that function as catalysts for proton reduction at low overpotentials have been introduced into the Pt(II)-based H2-generation systems. Eisenberg et al. constructed a photocatalytic H2-production system in which a series of luminescent Pt(II) terpyridyl acetylide complexes (110–113, in Fig. 28), 4,4′-dimethyl-1,1′-trimethylene-2,2′-bipyridinium, Pt colloid and TEOA are used as the chromophore, electron relay, catalyst and sacrificial reductant, respectively.136 The rate of H2 evolution depends on the concentration of the electron relay. The most effective system is obtained in a 2:3 acetonitrile–water solution, which produces a TON of 800 for H2 after 20 h of visible light irradiation (λ > 410 nm). Eisenberg's group constructed a photocatalytic system consisting of PS 110, [Co(dmgH)2pyCl]3+ (dmgH = dimethylglyoximate, py = pyridine) catalyst and TEOA. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the maximum TONs are achieved numbering 1000 and 34 with respect to the catalyst and the Pt(II) PS, respectively.137

It is clear that Pt(II) complex PSs exhibit lower activities for photocatalytic H2 production than those of the Ir(III) complex PSs. In an effort to improve the photon-to-fuel efficiency of the H2 generation systems, Castellano et al. optimized the structure of Pt(II) chromophores by synthesizing π-conjugated platinum(II) arylacetylide complex PSs (114–116, in Fig. 28), but the highest TON with respect to the Pt(II) Ps is only 120 in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).138 Eisenberg's group synthesized a cobaloxime catalyst for a Pt(II)-based photocatalytic H2-production system. The Pt(II)–cobaloxime–TEOA system produces 2150 TON of H2 after only 10 h of visible-light irradiation (λ > 410 nm) in the presence of PS 110 and TEOA in aqueous acetonitrile.139
In 2009, Sakai and coworkers reported a bifunctional molecular photocatalyst of [Pt(tpy)Cl]+ (tpy = terpyridine) (117) that can act as both a light-harvesting photosensitizer and a catalyst for photocatalytic H2 production. It is found that the rate of H2 evolution is quadratic to the concentration of 117, indicating that a bimolecular process determines the overall H2 evolution rate. The [Pt(tpy)Cl]+ molecules are situated in close proximity so that they form dinuclear Pt(II) intermediates, which seem to act as a catalytically active site for the hydrogen evolution.140 A mercury test is carried out to rule out the involvement of colloidal Pt. For developing a recyclable photocatalyst, the [Pt(tpy)Cl]+ complex was fully intercalated into the interlayer space of K4Nb6O17, constructing an inorganic–organic hybrid compound with unique photocatalytic H2 evolution activity.141 At room temperature, the free [Pt(tpy)Cl]+ complex is non-emissive in solution, while the intercalated material exhibits photoluminescence emission due to the metal–metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) transitions. Such intercalated Pt complexes serve as a single-component bifunctional catalyst, enabling both visible light sensitization and H2 production in aqueous media. Also, mesoporous silica, when sensitized with [Pt(tpy)Cl]+, catalyze the photoproduction of hydrogen.142 To determine if the active platinum species were in a monomeric or colloidal form, Yamashita and coworkers performed in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS) during the photocatalytic H2-production reaction.143 This approach provides direct evidence about the nature and coordination chemistry of the active platinum species that is useful to understand the catalytic mechanisms that govern the overall H2-evolution reactions. The states of the Pt(II) complex during photocatalytic production of H2 with EDTA as the sacrificial reductant were determined by in situ XAFS spectroscopy. The XAFS analysis ruled out the formation of colloidal platinum during the photochemical H2-evolution reaction, suggesting that the metallic Pt(0) was not the main contributor to photocatalytic activity. The investigation demonstrated that the Pt(II) monomeric species was in fact the active catalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation and that Pt(0) is a by-product of the reductive reaction of Pt(II) ions with H2. Although the Pt(II) species was occasionally spontaneously reduced to Pt(0) in the presence of H2 without requiring an additional external influence, the Pt(II) monomeric species was identified as the active catalyst for H2 generation based on the XAFS results. In addition, the long-lived emissive 3MLCT excited state of the Pt(II) species was more likely to be the efficient photosensitizer to drive the subsequent proton and electron transfer processes. These results demonstrate that the Pt(II)-based species is in fact the active molecular catalyst for H2 generation. Additionally, the spectrophotometric characterization reveals that the [Pt(tpy)Cl]+ complex is highly stable upon exposure to H2, which is critically important for practical application.144
Toward a better understanding and development of [Pt(tpy)Cl]+-based catalysts, Sakai and coworkers observed that the PV2+ (118, in Fig. 28) exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution activity in the presence of EDTA in comparison with 117.145 The mechanism responsible is thought to involve the formation of doubly reduced species PV0, which can thermally drive H2 evolution from water. This system, which is defined as “Z-scheme photosynthesis” as illustrated in Fig. 29, evolves H2 in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (EDTA) by way of consecutive photodriven electron transfer steps (PV2+ + EDTA + hν → PV+˙ + EDTA+; PV+˙ + EDTA + hν → PV0 + EDTA+; PV0 + 2H+ → PV2+ + H2).

The [Pt(tpy)Cl]+-based and PV2+ complexes are important examples of photo-hydrogen-evolving molecular photocatalysts; however, the TONs of these photocatalysts are rather low probably owing to their low absorptivity. To improve the performance of the photochemical H2 production, Sakai et al. prepared three [Pt(bpy)Cl2] derivatives (119–121, in Fig. 30). These complexes show better photocatalytic activity than [Pt(bpy)Cl2] derivatives without multiviologen units (122–124, in Fig. 30).146 The enhancement is attributed to the introduction of multiviologen moieties into a [Pt(bpy)Cl2]-based moiety serving as a light-harvesting and H2-evolving center. The same group also found that a larger π-conjugation in dpbpy can afford higher absorptivity at the 1MLCT band of 125 (Fig. 30) relative to that of 120, resulting in a higher photocatalytic H2 production activity.147 In this work, picosecond transient absorption (TA) studies have been carried out to gain insights into the initial rapid photoinduced processes. For those multiviologen moieties-modified [Pt(bpy)Cl2] derivatives, an obvious feature is that the one-electron reduced species cannot thermally catalyze hydrogen generation from water.148 Thus, H2 is photochemically produced via the one-electron-reduced species. Another related study found that a new [Pt(bpy)Cl2] derivative tethered to two pendant viologen units (126, in Fig. 30) can catalyze H2 generation, which involves the formation of a three-electron-reduced species in the presence of EDTA as a sacrificial electron donor under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the complex does not consume the initially collected one electron for photocatalytic H2 evolution.148

3.4 Gold and ruthenium complex photosensitizers
The application of noble-metal complexes other than Ru(II), Ir(III) and Pt(II) PSs is also a topic of considerable interest in modern chemistry. For example, there have been significant efforts to develop Au(III) photochemistry since the 1990s.149 However, cyclometalated Au(III) complexes with long-lived, triplet excited states that are highly emissive in fluid solutions remain scarce.150,151 The poor luminescence properties of Au(III) complexes are attributable to the high electrophilicity of the Au(III) ion, which results in low energy of the unoccupied dδ*(dx2−y2) orbital; thus, the ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited state is a low-energy state and is close to the emissive intraligand excited states, resulting in effective luminescence quenching.152 The luminescence efficiency of Au(III) complexes can be increased by incorporating strong-field ligands to push the dδ*(dx2−y2) orbital to a higher-lying energy level.153 The Che group recently reported two novel Au(III) complexes (127 and 128, in Fig. 31) bearing an extended π-conjugated bis-cyclometalated ligand with a long-lived and highly emissive triplet state in solution.154 These Au(III) complexes can be harnessed as PSs for H2 production from water in the presence of a [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] catalyst and TEOA, and a maximum TON of 350 is observed for the Au(III) PS (127). In another study, Alberto and coworkers presented a homogeneous photocatalytic H2 production system using [ReBr(CO)3(bpy)] (129, in Fig. 31) as the PS, [Co(dmgH)2] as the catalyst, and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.155 The Re(I) PS exhibits a much higher activity than the commonly used [Ru(bpy)3]2+ under the same reaction conditions.51

3.5 Noble-metal-free complex photosensitizers
In recent years, the interest in transition metal complexes as substitutes for noble metal complexes has increased. In natural photosynthesis, light-harvesting and exciton migration primarily occurs in porphyrin-based pigments. Due to the extensive system of delocalized π electrons, porphyrin and its metal complexes have strong absorption in the visible light region due to the strong Soret bands (400–450 nm) and moderate Q bands (500–600 nm) as well as outstanding stability.156,157 Porphyrin-based dyes have been widely investigated as efficient PSs for dye-sensitized solar cells,158,159 and the highest photon-to-current conversion efficiency exceeded 13%.160–162 In fact, metal porphyrin complexes have also been investigated as efficient PSs for solar-to-H2 conversion. In 1980, Grätzel et al. investigated the ability of ZnTPPS (130, in Fig. 32) and ZnTMPyP4+ (131, in Fig. 32) to produce H2 in a photocatalytic system containing a Pt catalyst, MV2+ and EDTA.163 The system containing 50 μM ZnTMPyP4+ (131), 20 mM EDTA, 8 μM Pt and 1 mM MV2+ in pH 5.0 buffer solution produces a maximum H2 generation rate of ca. 1.5 mL h−1 under visible-light irradiation (λ > 500 nm). Harriman and coworkers optimized the colloidal Pt catalyst using the polymers as the support. A maximum quantum yield of 7% for H2 production is obtained in the ZnTOPyP4+ (132)–MV2+–Pt–EDTA system when using stabilized Pt nanoparticles with an average radius of ca. 3–4 nm as the catalyst.164
 Fig. 32  Chemical structures of zinc and aluminium porphyrin PSs (130–134) for photocatalytic H2 production. 
In a photochemical H2-production system, the charge separation efficiency between the photoexcited PS and the catalyst is an important determinant of the overall quantum yield. Okura et al. reported effective charge separation in the photocatalytic H2-generation system consisting of ZnTPPS (130, in Fig. 32), MV2+, hydrogenase and TEOA via the addition of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).165,166 However, little H2 is observed in this SDS micellar system because of the denaturation of hydrogenase by SDS. Amao et al. also observed that the charge separation is efficiently improved in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant.167 A maximum H2 evolution rate of 0.64 μmol h−1 is observed under the optimized reaction conditions, which is approximately 50 times faster compared to that under the conventional conditions in the absence of CTAB. In another study, Willner et al. revealed a novel approach for retardation of the recombination rate for photoexcited ZnTPSPyP (133, in Fig. 32) using cyclodextrins to control the process. The cyclodextrins efficiently stabilize the intermediate of excited ZnTPSPyP against back electron-transfer reactions, leading to enhanced photocatalysis.168
The great challenges that remain in these photocatalytic H2-evolution systems include the development of systems that employ earth-abundant catalysts and the improvement of the activity of the systems. Coutsolelos et al. reported a noble-metal-free photocatalytic H2-production system that used a tetracationic water-soluble zinc porphyrin complex, [ZnTMPyP]4+ (131), as the PS, [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] as the catalyst and TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.169 This report was the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of a combination of a water-soluble metal porphyrin PS and a cobaloxime catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The maximum performance is observed in a neutral 1:1 CH3CN–H2O solution with a TON of 300 for H2 after 25 h of visible-light irradiation (λ > 440 nm). In addition to zinc porphyrin PSs, an aluminum porphyrin complex (134, in Fig. 32) is identified as an active PS for photocatalytic H2 production in the presence of [Co(dmgH)2(H2O)Cl] as the catalyst and H2A as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction mechanism of this noble-metal-free system was investigated by nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments, which revealed that the excited aluminum porphyrin complex is quenched by H2A. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum TON with respect to the aluminum porphyrin PS is up to 352.170
The application of noble-metal-free PSs to reduce cost and environmental impact is a topic of considerable interest in the field of photocatalytic H2 production. Notably, Cu(I) complexes possess interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties and have been considered as active components in organic light-emitting diodes,171–173 light-emitting electrochemical cells,174 luminescence-based sensors,175,176 and dye-sensitized solar cells.177–181 Beller and coworkers synthesized a series of cationic [Cu(N∧N)(P∧P)]+-type Cu(I) complexes (135–149, in Fig. 33) as active PSs for photocatalytic H2 production in the presence of [Fe3(CO)12] as the catalyst and TEA as the sacrificial reductant.182 This report was the first to describe a noble-metal-free photocatalytic H2 generation system based on relatively inexpensive copper-based PSs. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the maximum TON with respect to PS 149 was 804, which is much higher than the maximum TONs of commonly used [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (12) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ of 576 and 58, respectively. The excellent performance of Cu(I) PSs makes them attractive alternatives to the widely used noble-metal-based PSs (such as Ru(II), Ir(III) and Pt(II) complexes). In another study, new Cu(I) PSs (150–159, in Fig. 34) with considerably long excited-state lifetimes were synthesized by Beller and coworkers for photocatalytic H2 evolution, and the resultant improved H2-production system achieves a maximum TON of 1330 with respect to PS 151.183 To accelerate electron transfer from the excited Cu(I) PS to the iron-based catalyst, Beller et al. developed a photocatalytic H2-production system using TiO2 as the electron transfer medium, inspired by dye-sensitized solar cells. A series of novel heteroleptic Cu(I) PSs (160–163, in Fig. 34) bearing sulfonate anchor groups were synthesized and anchored to TiO2 to form Cu(I)/TiO2 compounds for H2 production.184 Photocatalytic experiments demonstrated that all Cu(I)/TiO2 compounds exhibit significant H2 production with a maximum TON of 2452 for PS 162. Detailed mechanistic insights into H2 production using an abundant copper–iron system were obtained by Ludwig et al.185 The Cu(I) PSs are both oxidized by a catalyst and reduced by a sacrificial reductant after photoexcitation, as revealed by ultraviolet, visible and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The reductive pathway is reversible with respect to the Cu(I) PSs. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that a homoleptic phenanthroline complex is formed during the H2 production reaction. The uncoordinated phosphine ligand liberated from copper metal can react with the [Fe3(CO)12] catalyst to form [Fe2(μ-PPh2)(μ-CO)(CO)6]−, which was also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).

Although some progress has been made in noble-metal-free solar H2-generation systems using Cu(I) PSs, these Cu(I)PS-based systems suffer from short lifetimes due to the decomposition of the Cu(I) PSs. With the goal of long-term sustainability, Castellano et al. prepared a homoleptic Cu(I) complex, [Cu(dsbtmp)2]+ (dsbtmp = 2,9-di(sec-butyl)-3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) (164, in Fig. 35(a)), for photocatalytic H2 production.186 As shown in Fig. 35(b), this homoleptic Cu(I) PS exhibits superior stability in a homogeneous photocatalytic H2 production system in the presence of a [Co(dmgH)2(py)]Cl catalyst and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMT) as the sacrificial reductant in a 1:1 CH3CN–H2O solution. This PS is still active even after 120 h of visible-light-induced (λex = 452 ± 10 nm) H2 production catalysis. These desirable results are important findings supporting the development of stable noble-metal-free PSs for homogeneous photocatalytic H2-generation systems.

At intervals of 20 h, the Cu(I) PS was precipitated by the addition of water, isolated by vacuum filtration, and then dissolved in fresh 1:1 CH3CN:H2O containing DMT and [Co(dmgH)2(py)]Cl catalyst at their initial concentrations, and the photocatalysis was resumed.

4. Supramolecular photocatalysts for solar H2 generation
Most multi-component photocatalytic H2-production systems suffer from short lifetimes due to photodecomposition of the reduced PSs. For long-term use, it is important to develop highly efficient solar H2 generation systems with long lifetimes and high durability. In the most recent decade, solar H2-evolution systems based on supramolecular photocatalysts have attracted much interest (summarized in Table 2).187–190 In these systems, the supramolecular complexes used as photocatalysts typically consist of the following three components (illustrated in Fig. 36): (1) a photoactive metal-complex fragment acting as a light absorber; (2) a metal unit coordinated at the opposite end of the assembly acting as a catalytic center; and (3) a bridging unit connecting the two metal centers. Importantly, the supramolecular photocatalyst can act as both light absorber and catalytic center, in contrast to the PS component in the multi-component system. In such a supramolecular photocatalyst, electron transfer from the photoactivated center to the catalytic center can be controlled by tuning the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the supramolecular complex. It may also be possible to slow the charge-recombination processes to construct efficient photocatalytic H2-production systems. In 2003, the first model of a supramolecular compound (165, in Fig. 37) as a potential photocatalyst was proposed and synthesized by Sun's group by linking the iron hydrogenase (Fe2S2) active site with [Ru(terpy)3]2+.191–193

4.1 Ruthenium–platinum supramolecular photocatalysts
The first example of a supramolecular photocatalyst for H2 production (167, in Fig. 38) was a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative and a Pt(II)-based catalyst constructed by Sakai's group. A relatively low TON of 4.8 with respect to PS 167 is observed after 10 h of visible-light irradiation in the presence of EDTA as the sacrificial reductant.194 Control experiments demonstrate that [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and K2PtCl4 in place of the Ru(II)–Pt(II) complex (167) do not lead to H2 formation, indicating that the covalent bond connecting the Ru(II) sensitizer and the Pt(II) catalyst is essential for the observed photocatalytic H2 production of the Ru(II)–Pt(II) photocatalyst. Furthermore, other Ru(II)–Pt(II) (168–170, in Fig. 38) complexes are used as photocatalysts to investigate the effect of the photoinduced electron transfer rate on photocatalytic performance. The results show that the CN-group modified Ru(II)–Pt(II) complex (170) exhibits higher photocatalytic performance relative to the COOH-group modified Ru(II)–Pt(II) complex (167). This is because of a larger driving force for photoinduced electron transfer associated with a stronger electron-withdrawing effect of the CN group. More importantly, in situ dynamic light scattering measurements clearly show that the formation of a colloidal platinum dispersion can be ruled out during the H2-production reactions photocatalyzed by these Ru(II)–Pt(II) photocatalysts.195 Besides, among Ru(II)–Pt(II) complexes (167, 171–173), only complex 167 is an active photocatalyst for H2 generation (Fig. 39), indicating that the intramolecular electron transfer from the 3MLCT excited state of the [Ru(bpy)2(phen)]2+ unit to the [Pt(bpy)]Cl2 moiety in these Ru(II)–Pt(II) complexes is the key process leading to H2 generation from water.196 That is, the excited Ru(II)–Pt(II) supramolecular complex is reduced to the one-electron-reduced species as an initial photoproduct, followed by a photoinduced process leading to H2 generation.145,196,197

4.2 Ruthenium–rhodium supramolecular photocatalysts
Brewer's group reported that the supramolecular complex [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2]5+ (174, in Fig. 40; dpp = 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine) is an active photocatalyst for H2 production when excited with visible-light in the presence of dimethylaniline (DMA) as the electron donor.198 Photoinitiated electron collection by [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2]5+ resulted in the conversion of Rh(III) to Rh(I) to produce [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2Rh]5+.199,200 The newly formed Rh(I) species is the key intermediate capable of interacting with protons to produce H2. The production of H2 by [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2]5+ is impacted by a variety of factors, including the concentrations of the components (the photocatalyst and the sacrificial reductant) and the pH of solution. The amount of H2 produced in this system varies linearly with irradiation time, indicating the excellent stability of the Ru(II)–Rh(III) photocatalyst. Unfortunately, this catalytic system exhibits low H2 evolution performance with a TON of 30 after 4 h of visible-light irradiation.
 Fig. 40  Molecular structure of Ru(II)–Rh(III)–Ru(II) supramolecular photocatalysts (174–176) for photocatalytic H2 generation. 
To improve the photocatalytic activity of Ru(II)–Rh(III)–Ru(II)-type trimetallic supramolecular photocatalysts, Brewer and coworkers synthesized two new supramolecular complexes of [{(Ph2phen)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2](PF6)5 (175) and [{(Ph2phen)2Ru(dpp)}2RhBr2](PF6)5 (176) (Ph2phen = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) for solar H2 production by replacing the bpy ligand with a Ph2phen terminal ligand.201 The photophysical properties indicate that photoexcitation populates the emissive 3MLCT excited states, which are then efficiently quenched by intramolecular electron transfer mechanisms to populate the non-emissive 3MMCT excited states. The unexpected Ru(II)–Rh(III) charge-transfer nature of the lowest-lying and photoactive excited state favors the H2-production reaction, resulting in a significant enhancement of efficiency. Photocatalytic H2-production systems containing 176 and DMA in a DMF–H2O mixed solution reveal that the supramolecular photocatalyst has an unusually high AQY (7.3%) and TON (1300), which are substantially enhanced relative to the analogous photocatalytic H2 evolution system based on 174.198 The excellent results indicate that the steric demands of the Ph2phen ligand provide protection for the photogenerated Rh(I) center, prohibiting undesirable side reactions that might deactivate the photocatalytic H2-production system.
4.3 Ruthenium–palladium supramolecular photocatalysts
Rau's group synthesized novel heterodinuclear Ru(II)–Pd(II) photocatalysts (in Fig. 41) that are able to achieve photochemical H2 production.202 The results demonstrate that the heterodinuclear Ru(II)–Pd(II) complex (177) is the only effective photocatalyst for H2 production, and a TON of 56 with respect to 177 is achieved in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant. The replacement of the tetrapyridophenazine bridging ligand by bipyrimidine in complex 178 also results in a loss of photocatalytic activity. By contrast, the Pd-free complex 179 and the binuclear Ru(II) complex 180 exhibit poor photocatalytic performance, with only very small amounts of H2 (TON = 0.56). These results indicate that the presence of all three components is essential for the H2-evolution processes. The photoinduced electron-transfer processes within the Ru(II)–Pd(II) photocatalyst (181) for H2 production were studied by resonance Raman and ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy.203 The subsequent excited-state relaxation of Ru(II)–Pd(II) on the picosecond timescale involves formation of the phenazine-centered intraligand charge-transfer state, which in Ru(II)–Pd(II) precedes formation of the Pd-reduced state. Ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy results demonstrate that the photoreaction in the heterodinuclear supramolecular complex is completed on a subnanosecond timescale.
 Fig. 41  Molecular structures of Ru(II)–Pd(II) supramolecular photocatalysts (177–181) for photocatalytic H2 generation. 
The details of the catalytic mechanism for H2 evolution over these Ru(II)–Pd(II) complexes remain unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that Pd colloids are active water-reduction catalysts that can be formed in situ from Pd(II) complexes.204 To determine the potential formation of a Pd colloid by photodegradation of the Ru(II)–Pd(II) complex and its possible role in photocatalytic H2 production, Johansson's group analyzed the reaction mixture at different stages of the photocatalytic H2-generation reaction by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).204 As evidenced by the TEM analysis illustrated in Fig. 42, the Pd colloid is released from the Ru(II)–Pd(II) complex upon illumination, and the appearance of the Pd colloid strongly correlates with the timing of the formation of H2. XPS analysis reveals a new spin–orbit split peak with a 3.2 eV shift in the Pd 3d spectra consistent with the reduction of Pd2+ to Pd0. Although the XPS and TEM data could not exclude the formation of H2 by homogeneous catalysis on the Ru(II)–Pd(II) dinuclear complex, these data strongly suggest that heterogeneous catalysis on the Pd colloids contributes significantly to H2 production. These results indicate that the reaction mechanisms of H2 evolution based on supramolecular photocatalysts generally require careful consideration of alternative mechanisms.

4.4 Ruthenium–cobalt supramolecular photocatalysts
Artero et al. coupled cobaloximes with ruthenium tris(diimine) moieties to generate supramolecular photocatalysts (182–185, in Fig. 43) for photochemical H2 production.205 H2 is produced in acetone solutions of these supramolecular photocatalysts in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant and [Et3NH][BF4] as the proton source when irradiated by a CdI-doped Hg light source. The maximum TON and TOF in an eight-hour experiment in the case of 182 are 85 and 8 h−1, respectively. In these supramolecular photocatalysts (182–185), the photoactivated center and catalytic center are typically linked with a fully conjugated bridge, and the presence of this conjugated bridge facilitates electron transfer either through conjugated bonds or by an outer-sphere electron transfer pathway. To investigate the role of the conjugated bridge in the photocatalytic performance of the supramolecular photocatalysts, Sun et al. prepared two heterobinuclear complexes, 186 and 187, in which the photoactivated center and the catalytic center are connected either by a conjugated bridge (186) or by an unconjugated bridge (187).206 The TON for H2 evolution is 38 for 186 and 48 for 187 in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant and [Et3NH][BF4] as the proton source in acetone solution after irradiation for 8 h with visible light. These results indicate that the supramolecular complex with an unconjugated bridge is a more efficient photocatalyst than the supramolecular complex with a conjugated bridge. This efficiency occurs because the unconjugated bridge between the photoactivated center and the catalytic center prevents the unwanted back electron-transfer reaction.

4.5 Osmium–rhodium supramolecular photocatalysts
To develop highly efficient solar H2-generation systems based on supramolecular photocatalysts, Nishibayashi's group successfully designed and synthesized Os(II)–Rh(III) supramolecular complexes (188 and 189, in Fig. 44) as effective photocatalysts for H2 production.207 These complexes are the first successful example of the utilization of the [Os(tpy)2]2+ moiety for photocatalytic H2 production. The Os(II)–Rh(III) photocatalyst exhibits high activity and stability during the photoinduced H2-generation processes, and the maximum TON with respect to the Os(II)–Rh(III) photocatalyst (188) is 594 after 240 h of visible-light irradiation in a 1:1 CH3CN–H2O solution consisting of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as the proton source and sodium ascorbate as the sacrificial reductant.

4.6 Iridium–palladium/platinum/cobalt supramolecular photocatalysts
The multi-component system based on cationic Ir(III) PSs and colloidal Pt/Pd catalysts yields robust and stable H2 production.95–99 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop efficient supramolecular photocatalysts based on an iridium light absorber and a platinum/palladium fragment catalytic center for photoinduced H2 evolution. Vos and coworkers reported that the novel cyclometallated Ir(III)–Pt(II)/Pd(II) dinuclear complexes (190 and 191, in Fig. 45) containing the bridging ligand 2,2′:5,2′′-terpyridine and a peripheral phenylpyridine ligand can be used as photocatalysts for H2 production in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant under both visible (470 nm) and UV (350 nm) irradiation.208 The highest TONs of 308 and 254 are obtained for heteronuclear 190 and 191, respectively, under 470 nm light irradiation. Decreasing the excitation wavelength to 350 nm dramatically reduces the TONs for H2 production to 65 for PS 190 and 16 for PS 191. Our group designed a new heterometallic supramolecular complex (192, in Fig. 45) consisting of an iridium carbene unit and a platinum terpyridine acetylide unit, representing a new and active supramolecular photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution from water.209 The results demonstrate that H2 production increases continuously and approximately linearly with time in the presence of TEA as the sacrificial reductant. The TON with respect to the Ir(III)–Pt(II) photocatalyst is 1672 after 60 h of visible-light irradiation. More importantly, quantitative poisoning experiments using the carbon disulfide method confirmed that H2 is produced in the homogeneous photocatalytic system. However, the reaction mechanism for H2 production is unclear even though possible contamination of the system by colloidal Pt is ruled out. There was no direct proof that H2 production occurred on colloidal Pt or in the molecular Pt(II) complex, and evidence of the local structure and electronic transition of the Pt species during the photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions is ambiguous. In this field, the active component of Pt(II)-based photocatalysts is somewhat controversial because of the formation of colloidal Pt nanoparticles during photocatalysis, as indicated by EDAX and TEM.52 More comprehensive and systematic studies are needed to reveal the chemical integrity of Pt(II)-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production. Otsuki et al. have demonstrated that the self-assembled Ir(III)–Co(II) complexes (193–196, in Fig. 46) can act as efficient photocatalysts for H2 generation in a CH3CN–H2O solution in the presence of TEOA as the sacrificial reductant.210 These results demonstrate that the self-assembled supramolecular system based on 194 exhibits higher H2-generation efficiency (TON = 20) than the corresponding multi-component counterpart with identical component concentrations. This study advocates further exploration of self-assembled supramolecular photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production.

4.7 Noble-metal-free supramolecular photocatalysts
With the aim of developing highly efficient supramolecular photocatalysts, many dinuclear complexes were constructed by covalently linking a photoactivated unit and a water-reduction catalyst. For most reported supramolecular photocatalysts, the photoactivated center and the catalytic center are usually based on noble metals. The practical application of these supramolecular photocatalysts is limited by the high cost of noble metals. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop photoactive supramolecular photocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals. Song et al. developed a completely noble-metal-free supramolecular photocatalyst (197, in Fig. 47) by covalently linking a Zn-porphyrin (ZnPor) and a [FeFe]-Hases (FeFe) catalyst as an effective photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation.211 However, the ZnPor–FeFe photocatalyst exhibits poor photocatalytic activity for H2 production (TON < 1). Although some progress has been made by Sun and Reek's groups by optimizing the structure of the ZnPor–FeFe supramolecular photocatalyst, these ZnPor–FeFe photocatalysts still display relatively low efficiency (TON = 0.2–4) for photocatalytic H2 evolution.212,213 The poor activity of these ZnPor–FeFe supramolecular photocatalysts is due predominantly to the following factors: (1) the high reduction potentials of the diiron carbonyl complex; (2) the poor photostability resulting from the weak coordination bond between the zinc porphyrin unit and pyridyl-functionalized diiron catalyst; and (3) the slow electron transfer rate from the sacrificial reductant to the excited photoactivated unit, which is not compatible with the fast charge recombination of the ZnPor+˙–FeFe−˙.
 Fig. 47  Noble-metal-free supramolecular photocatalysts (197–200) for photocatalytic H2 generation. 
To improve the stability of the linkage between the photoactivated center and the catalytic center, Sun's group designed and prepared three noble-metal-free supramolecular photocatalysts using pyridyl-functionalized porphyrin moieties and a cobalt cobaloxime as building blocks (198–200, in Fig. 47).214 In these supramolecular photocatalysts, the photoactivated center and the catalytic center are coordinately linked by a pyridyl group, thus ensuring intramolecular electron transfer from the excited state of the porphyrin moiety to the cobalt cobaloxime unit. More importantly, the axial coordination position remains vacant on the metal center of the porphyrin in these supramolecular photocatalysts, thus enabling coordination of TEA. In this scenario, intramolecular electron transfer from the sacrificial reductant to the excited supramolecular complex can be expected. The TON of H2 production is 22 and 3 for 198 and 199, respectively, under identical reaction conditions, whereas 200, which has a free-base porphyrin, was inactive for H2 generation. The higher photocatalytic efficiency of 198 compared to 199 and previously reported supramolecular photocatalysts, which are composed of a Ru(II)-based photoactivated center and the same cobalt cobaloxime with a similar pyridyl coordination linkage, is attributed to intramolecular electron transfer via the weak coordinate interaction of TEA with the zinc porphyrin chromophore.
5. Conclusions and future prospects
In this review, we have summarized the recent advances in developing efficient metal-complex chromophores for solar H2 generation. Many studies have demonstrated that metal complexes can act as efficient chromophores for photocatalytic H2 production due to their unique photophysical and electrochemical properties. Although much progress has been made in the development of metal-complex chromophores for photoinduced H2 evolution, further optimization of their photophysical and electrochemical properties is needed to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic systems. Some major issues are the following:
(1) How to scientifically evaluate the photocatalytic performance of H2 generation systems? Currently, in many works of this field, the TON value is used to describe the performance of the catalytic system. TON reflects a catalytic system's stability under the working conditions. Comparison of TON among photocatalytic materials with similar-type structures or similarly constructed structures under similar reaction conditions may give some useful information about the reaction. This parameter is related to the irradiation time, that is, a higher TON usually implies a longer reaction time. The higher TON represents the better durability of the photocatalytic H2 generation system. Actually, for the catalytic reaction, another parameter reflecting catalytic efficiency should be considered, that is the TOF, which is based on the number of active sites. It is important to find the prime factors that govern the high TOF. Besides TON and TOF, quantum yield should also be determined to evaluate the activities of photocatalytic H2 production systems.
(2) Further exploration of the structure–property correlations of metal-complex chromophores. One of the difficulties involved in the development of a highly efficient solar H2-generation system is identifying structure–property correlations for the metal-complex chromophores. Many factors can influence the photocatalytic activity of metal-complex chromophores, such as the excited-state lifetime, molar absorptivity, redox potentials and luminescence properties. Although some researchers have focused attention on the relationship between these factors and photocatalytic performance, further investigations are still worth pursuing because the molecular structure–property relationship is far from clear. Clearly, a better understanding of the structure–function correlations of the metal complexes contributes to build novel metal-complex chromophores as light-harvesting materials and catalysts for highly efficient solar-hydrogen generation.
(3) Design and fabrication of noble-metal-free metal-complex chromophores. Most efficient homogeneous/multi-component photocatalytic H2-production systems have been constructed utilizing noble metal complexes as chromophores. For example, derivatives of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and [Pt(terpy)]+ have been extensively investigated as efficient chromophores for photocatalytic H2 evolution.40–50,90–100,140–145 Among them, the Ir(III) complexes are the most effective chromophores due to their excellent excited-state properties, and a maximum TON of 17000 with respect to the Ir(III) chromophore has been observed by Park's group.103 However, these noble-metal based chromophores are too precious and scarce to be used for large-scale solar H2 generation. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop noble-metal-free metal-complex chromophores. In recent years, many novel metal-complex chromophores based on earth-abundant metal elements have been designed and developed for photocatalytic H2 production from water. For example, aluminum protoporphyrin and Cu(I) complexes were utilized for the first time as efficient chromophores for solar H2 evolution.170,182–186 Unfortunately, these photocatalytic systems suffer from low activities and short lifetimes. In the future, smarter designs and syntheses of additional noble-metal-free complex chromophores for photocatalytic H2 production can be expected. For example, novel zinc porphyrin complexes, which are highly efficient photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells,215–218 would be appropriate alternatives to noble metal-complexes for solar H2 generation.
(4) Construction of photocatalytic overall water-splitting systems based on metal-complex chromophores. Most work in the field of homogeneous/multi-component photocatalytic H2-production systems has focused on the water-reduction half-reaction system, which requires an extra sacrificial reductant (such as TEOA, TEA, or H2A). For practical applications, a study of photocatalytic H2 production from the water reduction half-reaction system is meaningless because it requires a high-cost sacrificial reductant. The model of homogeneous overall photocatalytic solar water splitting illustrated in Fig. 48 was proposed by Balzani and co-workers in 1997,219,220 but no system capable of catalyzing water splitting into H2 and O2 has been developed. In principle, photocatalytic overall water splitting is possible under both visible- and near-infrared-light irradiation because the difference between the potentials of the H2/H2O and H2O/O2 half reactions is only 1.23 V. However, photocatalytic overall water splitting remains challenging in both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalytic systems, and the greatest bottleneck for the successful development of a photocatalytic overall water-splitting system is the water oxidation half-reaction, which is thermodynamically very demanding. Some homogeneous photocatalytic water-oxidation systems with low quantum yields have been constructed.221–226 In the future, more programs will combine research on water oxidation with studies on the construction of photocatalysts for overall water-splitting systems.
 Fig. 48  Proposed concept for photocatalytic overall water splitting. The light-harvesting antenna collects solar energy and then funnels that energy to the photosensitizer where initial charge separation takes place. A water reduction catalyst (WRC) and a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) drive the splitting of water into H2 and O2. 
(5) Development of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell based on metal-complex chromophores for water splitting. The high quantum yield obtained in the half-reaction system implies that the essential components (chromophores and catalysts) are already in hand for photocatalytic overall water splitting, at least at the proof-of-concept level. Photocatalytic water splitting would become similarly efficient if the charge-recombination reactions were sufficiently slow. The charge recombination of metal-complex chromophores is efficiently suppressed in a sensitized semiconductor system.227 Therefore, the combination of metal-complex chromophores and semiconductors is very important to develop efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting. Recently, Sun's and Mallouk's groups reported a promising strategy to split water and produce hydrogen using a PEC cell, which is one of the most promising strategies for overall water splitting.228–235 A representative PEC device has been successfully assembled using a Ru(II) complex molecular chromophore and a molecular Ru(II) water oxidation catalyst co-adsorbed to TiO2 as the photoanode, and a Pt wire was used as a passive counter electrode. Vigorous evolution of both O2 and H2 gases from the respective anode and cathode was observed in a three-electrode system with an applied 0.2 V vs. NHE external bias under visible-light illumination, thereby showing highly efficient visible-light-driven water splitting.229 In order to avoid the use of precious metal Pt, a tandem molecular PEC cell was also developed by the same group. In such a cell, the photoanode is made of an organic or Ru(II) photosensitizer and a molecular Ru-complex water oxidation catalyst on mesoporous TiO2, while the photocathode consists of the same photo-absorber as used for the photoanode and a molecular Co-complex hydrogen generation catalyst on nanostructured NiO.236,237 For the PEC water splitting cell, [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type complexes and metal-free organic dyes were frequently investigated as potential photosensitizers, in which [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based PSs showed better performance for light-driven water splitting in the PEC cell.237,238 However, the high cost and poor durability of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based PSs limit their long-term application in a PEC cell. Inspired by the great success of zinc porphyrin PSs in the application of dye-sensitized solar cells,161,162 the zinc porphyrin PSs would be more realistic in practical PEC devices due to their superior efficiencies and low cost. However, there is still a very long way ahead. Parallel to the development of metal complexes described above, efforts have also been devoted toward inorganic semiconductors acting as active inorganic dyes in a PEC cell, such as Cu2O,239,240 CuO,241 CaFe2O4,242 CdTe,243 PbS,244 Ag2S,245,246 ZnFe2O4247 and copper sulfides or selenides (CuInS2, Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu(In, Ga)Se2, etc.).248–250 Among them, Cu2O is an attractive p-type oxide for a PEC water splitting cell because of its narrow bandgap of 2 eV and a high light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 18%, but the insufficient photoelectrochemical stability of Cu2O limits its application.239 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a new strategy to improve the photoelectrochemical performance of inorganic light absorbers for a PEC water splitting cell. Currently, this research field is very promising, and much attention should be paid to the design and development of novel photoactive PSs for the practical application of a PEC cell.
