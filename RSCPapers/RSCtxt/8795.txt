    , Accepted 25th February 2019First published on 26th February 2019Abstract2D metal chalcogenide materials have received enormous attention due to their extraordinary bio-chemical, electronic, magnetic, thermal and optical properties. Compared with the typical two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and topological insulators, cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) has very different two-dimensional lattice structures, along with excellent electro-catalysis and high conductivity. However, the nonlinear optical properties of Cu2S have never been studied until now. Here, the nonlinear photonics characteristics of Cu2S and its application in ultrafast lasers have been systematically studied for the first time. Through optical deposition of Cu2S nanosheets on a tapered fiber, the nonlinear optical properties of Cu2S nanosheets are measured through the interaction with the evanescent field. The results indicate that superior nonlinear saturable absorption properties with a modulation depth of 0.51% are achieved. An erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser is constructed to verify the performance of the Cu2S saturable absorber (SA). The results show that an output pulse with 8.06 MHz repetition rate, 1.04 ps pulse duration, 1530.4 nm central wavelength and 3.1 nm spectral width without an obvious Kelly sideband is obtained. Considering the diversity of the metal chalcogenide family, various engineering applications may be developed from the nonlinear saturable absorption characteristics of Cu2S, including optical fiber communication/sensing, precision optical metrology, material processing and nonlinear optics.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, two-dimensional materials have attracted increasing attention due to their energy band structure, splendid crystals, and wide applications in nonlinear optics, ultrafast photonics and other fields.1–5 One of the most important optical properties is their nonlinear absorption, which is attractive especially when using two-dimensional materials as various optical elements in the optical modulation, photo-detection and all-optical signal processing fields.6 Graphene and other 2D layered materials (for example, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), topological insulators and black phosphorus) have gained intensive research interest for their extensive applications in biological sensing, electrochemistry, material processing and optical fiber communication due to their unusual chemical, mechanical, thermal, electrical and optical properties.7 So far, a considerable number of experiments have proved that the optical nonlinearity of two-dimensional nanomaterials is enhanced without sacrificing the ultrafast response.8 In particular, various mode-locking fiber lasers with different output powers, central wavelengths, and pulse durations have been demonstrated by using saturable absorbers (SAs) consisting of graphene, TMDs, topological insulators and black phosphorus. They have their own advantages and drawbacks in terms of cost and performance.9 As a result, from the viewpoint of engineering applications, the development of a new type of nonlinear optical material with characteristics such as a wide operation wavelength range, large modulation depth, high damage threshold, ultrafast response time, long-term durability/reliability and low cost suitable for practical applications such as all-optical switches, polarized rotations, frequency conversion and optical modulators, is still highly desirable.10
Recently, cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) has been drawing more and more scientific attention because of its relatively high photoelectric conversion efficiency and acknowledged structural complexity. Despite its simple composition of two Cu atoms and one sulfur atom in a primitive cell, it is a complex material that can exist in different forms.11 As a metal sulfide with a layered structure, Cu2S is very different from common TMDs (MX2, where M is a transition metal atom and X is a chalcogen atom)12 and topological insulators (such as Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3, etc.). Generally speaking, Cu2S is a typical promising p-type semiconductor due to the stoichiometric deficiency of copper in the lattice, which has broad applications in diverse fields, including photocatalysis, solar cells, chemical sensing, medical treatment and nanoscale switches.13,14 Among them, the most important application of Cu2S is in the solar industry because of its efficient power conversion efficiency. Various Cu2S nano-crystals have been reported because of their excellent property of localizing surface plasmon resonances.15–17 Thin films and nanodisks of Cu2S have been extensively studied in order to investigate the growth mechanism of materials with different morphologies and the corresponding chemical and physical properties.18,19 For example, Riha investigated the photoexcited carrier dynamics of Cu2S thin films based on transient absorption spectroscopy,18 and Bryks revealed that the liquid crystalline mesophase plays a key role in templating the disk morphology of the solid-state Cu2S product.19 Michael reported the solventless synthesis of monodisperse Cu2S nanorods, nanodisks, and nanoplatelets.20 In 2008, the synthesis of colloidal copper sulfide nanocrystals and their application as an active light absorbing component to make a solar cell with 1.6% power conversion efficiency were achieved.21 In 2015, solution-processed CdS–Cu2S core–shell nanorod array solar cells were fabricated and characterized by a power conversion efficiency of 3.8%.22 In 2016, the Cu2S NRs@Cu foam was reported to work as an electrocatalyst for the detection of glucose and H2O2 with high sensitivity.23 In 2018, the in situ hydrothermal sulfidization preparation of Co-doped worm-like Cu2S directly grown on copper foam (Co–Cu2S/CF) was reported and it was further applied as an efficient, stable electrocatalyst for alkaline water oxidation.24 Thereafter, a core–shell structure Y2O3:Nd3+/Yb3+@SiO2@Cu2S (YRSC) was designed, and the shell Cu2S showed bioimaging and photothermal conversion function.25 In 2018, Zhang monitored the pseudoelectroelasticity process of Cu2S nanowires at the atomic scale and successfully applied this mechanism to nanoelectromechanical systems.26 Nevertheless, all these studies mainly dealt with photothermal conversion, solar cells, biophysics, micro/nano-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), etc. The ultrafast nonlinear saturable absorption properties of Cu2S haven't been investigated until now.
In this work, in order to explore whether Cu2S nanosheets can be used for ultrashort pulse generation in the near-infrared region, we fabricate a novel Cu2S SA by depositing Cu2S nanosheets on a tapered fiber. The deposited Cu2S nanosheet film was covered tightly over the tapered fiber with a length of 0.7 centimeters. The nonlinear optical properties of Cu2S nanosheets are determined through the double-balanced detection method using a home-made fiber amplifier. The results show that the saturation intensity and modulation depth are 421.92 MW cm−2 and 0.51%, respectively. Furthermore, by inserting the SA into an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) cavity, an ultrashort pulse train with 1530.4 nm center wavelength, 1.04 ps pulse duration, 3.1 nm spectral width and 4.4 mW average power has been obtained successfully. It is noteworthy that the optical spectra show no obvious Kelly sideband, which indicates that the performance of the proposed fiber laser is quite different from that of the previous short pulse laser in abnormal dispersion regimes.
2. Preparation and characterization
At present, the preparation of Cu2S nanosheets is mainly based on a gas-solid reaction,27,28 which is generally performed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with copper. Some modified methods, such as anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template techniques29,30 and surfactant-assisted gas-solid reactions,31 are also reported. Here, bulk Cu2S is obtained based on the surfactant-assisted gas-solid reaction technique. The liquid exfoliation method is used to obtain Cu2S nanosheets. The preparation process of the Cu2S nanosheet solution can be divided into five steps as shown in Fig. 1(a). Firstly, Cu2S powder is obtained from bulk Cu2S by grinding. Secondly, the Cu2S powder is mixed with an alcohol with a ratio of 1:2 for dispersion. So, a stable suspension liquid is formed. Thirdly, the Cu2S dispersible liquid is oscillated for about 40 min in order to make the Cu2S solution sufficiently dispersed. The photograph of the suspension of Cu2S packed in a small bottle is shown in Fig. 1(a). The suspension is quite stable and without precipitation after being stored for several hours under ambient conditions. Finally, after separating the solution by centrifugation and taking the supernatant, we obtain the Cu2S nanosheets. Due to the reducibility, Cu2S will be oxidized when it is exposed to air for a long time. So, we kept Cu2S in air for 12 hours to test the elemental ratio of the sample, and the ratio of elements did not change. It proves that this nanomaterial will not react with air in a short time. It is also indicated that Cu2S can remain stable for quite a long time during the experiments. Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Cu2S nanosheets in different scales, where the layered structure can be identified at the edge. A high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image with a scale of 50 nm is given in Fig. 1(d), which shows that the inter-distance of the lattice fringes is 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (102) lattice distance. Fig. 1(e) shows the STEM image scale of 2 nm.

The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) spectrum of Cu2S is given in Fig. 2(a). The space group is confirmed to be P63/mmc with characteristic peaks between 30° and 80°. The strong diffraction peaks are located at (102), (110), (103), and (112), which is consistent with the Cu2S hexagonal crystal spectrum in the standard spectrum library. The ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV/Vis/NIR) absorption spectrum of Cu2S nanosheet dispersion is shown in Fig. 2(b), which indicates that the Cu2S nanosheet dispersion is absorbed between 250 nm and 2000 nm. The absorption intensity at the wavelength of 1530.4 nm is around 22%. In order to discuss the reproducibility of Cu2S, a superimposed absorbance spectrum has been given. We measured the UV/Vis/NIR spectra of samples 1 and 2 at different times. It is shown that absorbance peak positions and trends over time are nearly identical. This proves the high reproducibility of Cu2S. The morphology of the samples is observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The EDS spectrum has revealed that such materials mainly contain the elements Cu and S with an atomic ratio of ∼2:1, consistent with Cu2S, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). Beyond that, Si and Al are sample placement stations. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the structure of the Cu2S crystal cell is a parallel hexahedron. Each sulfur atom covalently combines with 4 adjacent copper-2 atoms and 2 adjacent copper-1 atoms. In the adjacent two layers of Cu2S, there is no gap stacking structure.

Some common ways to fabricate 2D nanomaterial SA devices, in which the light wave interacts with two-dimensional nanomaterials through evanescent fields, are achieved by tapered fibers, D-shaped fibers, optical fiber connectors, etc.32 In this work, we make tapered fibers and the Cu2S nanosheets are deposited in the cone so that they can sufficiently come into contact with it. We cut off a single-mode fiber, peel off the center of the fiber with about 3 cm coating and heat it with an alcohol lamp. At the same time, a force is applied at both ends of the fiber. Because of high temperature and tension, a tapered fiber with a length of 1 cm, a diameter of 15 μm and a loss value of 30% is fabricated. Subsequently, the tapered fiber is transferred to the glass and immobilized, and then connected to the cavity. Fig. 3(a) shows the experimental device for fabricating the tapered fiber. Fig. 3(b) illustrates Cu2S with the tapered fiber, the green cone means the tapered fiber and the black pot refers to Cu2S deposition. In the laser cavity, an alcohol dispersion of Cu2S is dripped to the tapered fiber with 100 mW pump power. Compared with the non-deposited tapered fiber, about 20% of the energy is absorbed by Cu2S, which proves that the material is completely in contact with the tapered fiber. Through an optical microscope, the image of black granular materials on the surface of the fiber can be obtained as shown in Fig. 3(c).

In order to characterize the nonlinear optical absorbance of the fabricated tapered fiber based on Cu2S, we built a double-balanced detection system which contains a mode-locked fiber laser (1563.3 nm wavelength, pulse duration ∼ 644 fs, 27.9 MHz repetition rate) and a home-made erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as shown in Fig. 4(e). The typical pulse train and the optical spectrum are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The repetition rate and the autocorrelation trace are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), respectively. The nonlinear transmission curve is shown in Fig. 4(f), which is a function of pulse-power density.33 The SA is a device whose transmittance is related to the intensity of light passing through it. The absorption of the material decreases with the increase of light intensity and eventually becomes saturated at a certain power threshold. It can be seen that the modulation depth and the saturation intensity are about 0.51% and 421.96 MW cm−2, respectively.

3. Experimental setup

Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of a mode-locked fiber laser. The Cu2S SA on a glass slide is inserted into the laser cavity as a mode locker. The pump source is a laser diode (LD) with 976 nm central wavelength and 437.6 mW maximum output power. A 980 nm/1550 nm wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) is utilized to couple light into the cavity. A section of a 750 mm erbium-doped fiber (EDF) (dispersion parameter D is –42.5 ps nm−1 km−1) works as a gain medium. A single mode fiber (SMF-28) (dispersion parameter D is 20 ps nm−1 km−1) with a length of 15 m is used to accumulate more nonlinear phase shifts in the cavity with 25.7 m total length. The laser cavity polarization can be adjusted using polarization controllers (PCs) to further optimize the output laser soliton pulse. A polarization-independent isolator (PI-ISO) guarantees that the laser provides unidirectional transmission. An optical coupler (OC) can split the laser light into two arms with 40% output for analysis and another 60% is connected back to the 1550 nm end of the WDM. The net dispersion of the Er-doped fiber laser is calculated to be −0.27 ps2. The optical spectra are monitored and recorded using an optical spectrum analyzer with a resolution of 0.02 nm (Anritsu MS9710C), and the temporal mode-locked pulse train is measured using a 2 GHz photodetector (PD). This PD is connected to a digital oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 1 GHz (Rigol DS6104).

4. Experimental results and discussion
First, we obtain the results of the cavity without the Cu2S SA.34 By changing the pump power or rotating the PCs, no mode-locked pulses have been observed. After plugging the Cu2S SA, mode-locked pulses can be obtained by changing the pump power and adjusting the position of PCs. The low pump power and the suitable PC position are the keys to achieving traditional soliton mode-locking.35,36 This proves that the Cu2S SA can be used in mode-locked fiber lasers and the mode-locking operation is caused by the interaction between Cu2S nanosheets and light waves. The role of Cu2S in mode locking in our work is crucial, which relies on the high nonlinear optical properties of Cu2S.37
The typical optical characteristics of the Cu2S EDF laser are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) shows the output spectra of the mode-locked EDF laser centered at 1530.4 nm with a 3 dB bandwidth of 3.1 nm, which is obtained at a pump power of 304.4 mW. It is a traditional soliton pulse without distinct Kelly sidebands. In addition, continuous light can be observed at the top edge in the spectrum, which is the result of the interaction between the birefringence effect of the fiber and the nonlinear optical effect of Cu2S.38Fig. 6(b) shows the oscilloscope trace of the output signal from the mode-locked EDF laser. It exhibits that the span of the output pulse train is 1400 ns, and the pulse train is quite stable with a pulse period of 125 ns. The radio frequency (RF) spectrum of the signal is shown in Fig. 6(c). The fundamental repetition rate of the pulse is approximately 8.064 MHz, which corresponds to the 25.7 m long cavity, taking into account the length of the different fibers that make up the laser cavity. The fundamental peak locates at the cavity repetition rate with a signal-to-noise ratio of 24.77 dB. Fig. 6(d) shows the typical output auto-correlation trace of the mode-locked pulse, which illustrates that the real pulse duration is approximately 1.04 ps. The data point obtained by hyperbolic secant simulation is 1.60 ps at the full width half-maximum (FWHM).

In order to discuss the evolution of pulse sequences and optical spectra under different pump powers, we record the corresponding optical spectra and pulse sequences at different powers before pulse splitting. Fig. 7(a) shows the optical spectrum of the soliton pulse with increasing pump power from 282.2 to 311.8 mW. When further increasing the pump power, there is no significant change in the optical spectra and waveform. Fig. 7(b) shows pulse trains with the changing pump power. It can be concluded that the pump power increases within a certain range, and the impulse train is always stable. As shown in Fig. 7(c), with the changing pump power, the output power and the pulse energy are also increasing linearly with the pump power. In order to verify the time stability of the proposed mode-locked fiber laser, we obtained the optical spectrum at intervals of 20 minutes. Fig. 7(d) shows the optical spectra versus time. It can be seen that the Kelly sideband of the spectrum does not change with time. Meanwhile, the center wavelength of the optical spectra does not shift, which proves that it has certain time stability. Due to the limitation of the oscilloscope resolution, the number of recorded data is not enough, so the pulse sequence is not accurate enough. The pulse sequences are shown on the oscilloscope at 100 ns per div and 200 ns per div in Fig. 7(e) and (f), respectively. From the picture, it is observed that the pulse train is relatively stable.

Table 1 indicates the output performance comparison of the implemented Cu2S-based mode-locked laser and the previously reported mode-locked lasers based on MoTe2, WTe2, WS2, MoSe2, ReS2, Sb2Te3, and Bi2Te3 SA. It is demonstrated that the central wavelength is 1530.4 nm, which is shorter than previously reported mode-locked lasers. Meanwhile, the optical spectral width is 3.1 nm, which is wider than that in other studies. A wider spectral width means that more channels with different central wavelengths can be accommodated for dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM) systems. The wider spectral width will improve the capacity of the current DWDM systems and the performance of wavelength routing photonics networks. On the other hand, the output average power is 4.4 mW, which is significantly higher than that of other mode-locked lasers. As a matter of fact, it is of great significance since it can extend the transmission distance of the existing commercial optical fiber communication system with a non-negligible transmission loss of the single mode optical fiber (0.2 dB km−1). Furthermore, higher output power could provide more sufficient power security for other versatile applications such as optical sensing/imaging and micromachining.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that some emerging materials such as ITO (indium tin oxide) and MoO3 can also be applied in photonics aspects with different applications. The ITO nanocrystals exhibit a sub-picosecond response time (corresponding to frequencies over 2 THz) and a modulation depth up to 160%.39 Degenerately doped oxide nanoparticles have also been used in all-optical switching in the mid-infrared region, which features a sub-picosecond response speed (with a recovery time constant of <400 fs).40 An SA based on ZnO3 is prepared and applied in a Yb-doped fiber laser. A pulse with a duration of 130 ps and a central wavelength of 1067 nm has been generated.41 More recently, the carrier dynamics of copper antimony sulfide semiconductor nanocrystals were investigated and the excellent ultrafast response properties were demonstrated.42
Then, from the comparison of parameters in the table, it can be revealed that Cu2S has excellent ultrafast nonlinear photonics characteristics compared with the common transition metal sulfides and topological insulators. It will find potential applications in various advanced optoelectronic devices.
5. Conclusion
In summary, a novel two-dimensional Cu2S nanosheet SA is fabricated and further applied to a mode-locked EDF fiber laser for the first time. The results show that the Cu2S nanosheets exhibit superior ultrafast nonlinear saturable absorption properties and a high optical damage threshold. The saturation intensity and modulation depth of Cu2S nanosheets are 421.92 MW cm−2 and 0.51%, respectively. At a pump power of 304.4 mW, stable mode-lock laser pulse trains with a center wavelength of 1530.4 nm, a pulse duration of 1.04 ps, a spectral width of 3.1 nm and the fundamental repetition of 8.064 MHz are obtained successfully. The dynamics mechanism of mode-locking in the fiber laser is investigated. All these reveal that Cu2S nanosheets are promising ultrafast nonlinear optical materials for application in many fields including mid-IR fiber sensor/communication, medical diagnosis, material processing, precision optical metrology and nonlinear optics.
