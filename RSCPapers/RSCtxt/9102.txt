    , Accepted 11th August 2018First published on 18th September 2018AbstractThere has been growing interest in the effectual strategy of constructing non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells that may overcome the defect of traditional fullerene-based acceptors. Herein, two novel push–pull (acceptor–donor–acceptor) type small-molecule acceptors, that is, TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3, with triphenylamine (TPA) as the core unit and pyran-annulated perylene diimides (Py-PDIs) as peripheral groups are designed and synthesized for non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). After device optimization, OSCs based on TPA-PDI3 demonstrate good device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 5.84%, surpassing the TPA-PDI2-based counterparts fabricated under identical conditions (1.314% PCE). The high efficiency for TPA-PDI3 can be attributed to the complementary absorption spectra with the donor material (PBDB-T), balanced carrier transport and favorable morphologies. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE of 5.84% is among the highest values based on ethynyl-functionalized TPA-shaped non-fullerene acceptors so far.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely investigated with great effort to convert solar energy into electrical energy with advantages of semi-transparency, lightweight, flexibility and large-area fabrication through low-cost solution-coating methods.1 In general, OSCs adopt a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer consisting of a blend of donors and acceptors (fullerene derivatives).2 However, the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, such as weak absorption in the visible region, high retail costs, inferior ambient stability and poor morphology stability, make it a problematic material for future practical application in OSCs. Therefore, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) used in OSCs have drawn vigorous attention from both academia and industry due to the advantages of tunable energy levels, strong absorption in the visible and even near-infrared region (vis-NIR), and easy purification compared to their fullerene counterparts.3
To date, a series of high performance NFAs has been exploited,4,5 especially for the systems of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) and perylene diimides (PDIs). The PCEs of organic solar cells based on the ITIC acceptors have exceeded 12%,5h,6 while the record PCE of the PDI-based OSCs is 10.58%.4f,5gPDIs exhibit several excellent properties, such as easy functionalization, strong electron-acceptor character, finely tunable solubility, intense light absorption capability, energy level tunability, and self-assembling properties.7 However, despite these favorable advantages, the strong tendency for π–π stacking between PDI molecules tends to form excessively large crystalline domains, which may result in large phase separation in active layers, thereby limiting the OSC performance.8
Therefore, many strategies have been adopted to suppress the aggregation tendency to enhance the processability of the materials and to form favorable BHJ domain structures. Several groups worked on the construction of twisted PDI dimers and three-dimensional structured oligomers, connected by cores such as spirobifluorene,9 tetraphenylethylene,8b benzodithiophene8a and porphyrin.10 Furthermore, S, Se and N heteroatoms have been incorporated at the bay positions of PDI units to obtain more twisted structures and higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, which are favorable for achieving good device performances.11 Therefore, the further development of novel PDIs is worthy of being studied.
Recently, our group developed novel pyran-annulated PDIs (Py-PDIs), which exhibited extended UV-vis absorption and relatively high LUMO energy levels.12 These properties demonstrated that Py-PDIs are a promising electron-deficient unit for high-performance n-type semiconductors for OSCs. However, the usage of Py-PDIs in non-fullerene organic solar cells has never been reported.
Herein, we report two novel propeller-shaped small molecule acceptors named TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 based on 3D-structured triphenylamine as the core, which is flanked with an acetylene unit and end-capped with Py-PDIs. By using TPA-PDI3 as the acceptor and the high performance polymer of PBDB-T (Fig. S17, ESI†) as the donor, the highest PCE of 5.84% with an impressively high Voc of 0.91 V, a JSC of 10.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.4% was achieved, which is 4.5 times higher than that of TPA-PDI2 (1.314% PCE). The results demonstrated that Py-PDIs have good potential for the construction of high-performance non-fullerene acceptors.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the two compounds are shown in Scheme 1 and 2. Py-PDI-Br was synthesized by the bromination of compound Py-PDI using chloroform and potassium carbonate under reflux conditions (Scheme 2). The acetylene substituted TPA cores were synthesized according to the literature methods.13 The targeted products of TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 were obtained in moderate yields by the palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction. The as-synthesized molecules were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows very sharp, well resolved peaks for the dimer, but the trimer (Fig. S10, ESI†) shows very broad signals. We think that the 3D molecular geometry enhanced the structural rigidity and conformational uniformity of the TPA-PDI3 molecule, which suppressed the free rotation of the TPA and PDIs leading to a 3D interlocking structure. A similar interlocking conformation has been reported recently in a 3D PDI-based small molecule acceptor.9 To verify the structure of the target product (TPA-PDI3), we performed the MALDI-TOF measurements (Fig. S13, ESI†) and elemental analysis. Moreover, they exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), at room temperature. These conjugated molecules also exhibit excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 402 °C for TPA-PDI2 and 428 °C for TPA-PDI3 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Obviously, the thermal stability of the two small molecules is adequate for their application in OSCs.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two compounds in dichloromethane (DCM) solution (10−5 M) and as the solid film are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The two compounds exhibited similar absorption profiles. Compound TPA-PDI3 showed a strong visible absorption band in the wavelength range of 450–670 nm with a maximum molar extinction coefficient of 9.08 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 553 nm, which is higher than that of TPA-PDI2 (6.21 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 557 nm) most likely due to the synergistic effect of π–π interactions.14 Neat TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 films display similar absorption spectra to their solution ones, indicating weak intermolecular aggregation in the solid state. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of the two compounds was estimated to be 1.69 and 1.77 eV from the absorption onset of their films. In addition, the absorption spectra of TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 with PBDB-T were well complemented to ensure a full harvest of light in the visible spectrum (Fig. 1b).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to investigate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels in CH3CN solutions using Ag/Ag+ as a reference and Fc/Fc+ (0.432 V) as a standard (Fig. 2 and Table S1, ESI†). The LUMO energy levels were calculated to be the onset of reduction potential, −3.83 and −3.78 eV, respectively, according to the equation ELUMO = −[q(Ered − EFc/Fc+) + 4.8] eV.15 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels for TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 were calculated to be −5.52 and −5.55 eV, respectively, according to the equation EHOMO = −(ELUMO + Eoptg) eV.15 As shown in Fig. 3b, the relatively high energy offsets of 1.5 eV (LUMO–LUMO) for TPA-PDI3 and PBDB-T compared with the counterpart of TPA-PDI2 and PBDB-T (1.45 eV) can produce a high Voc for TPA-PDI3-based PSCs.

2.3. Theoretical analysis
In order to gain a deeper insight into the geometric and electronic properties of the two acceptor molecules, density functional theory calculations were performed using the Gaussian package B3LYP/6-31G(d).16 In order to facilitate the calculation, the long alkyl chains were replaced with an isopropyl group. The LUMO and HOMO orbitals are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In TPA-PDI2, the LUMO orbital localizes on the PDI unit, while the HOMO electron density localizes on the TPA core along with the PDI unit. However, in TPA-PDI3, the HOMO orbital concentrates on the core of TPA, implying obvious charge polarization in the excited state. The optimized molecular geometries of the two compounds are presented in Fig. 4. The dihedral angles between PDI and benzene in TPA-PDI2 are 15.7° and 6.7°, respectively (Fig. 4a and c). On the other hand, the dihedral angles between PDI and benzene in TPA-PDI3 are 15.1°, 12.4° and 0.2°, respectively (Fig. 4b and d). These results suggest that the introduction of the third PDI unit results in an obviously more twisted molecular configuration, which is expected to suppress aggregation to form favorable morphologies and nanoscale phase separation. The LUMO/HOMO energy levels of TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 are −3.33/−5.27 eV and −3.39/−5.34 eV through DFT calculations (Table S2, ESI†), respectively. The calculated values are consistent with the values obtained by the CV measurements.

2.4. Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 as acceptors were investigated in devices prepared with a configuration of ITO glass/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene):poly(styrene sulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layers/ZrAcAc/Al. PBDB-T was chosen as the electron donor material because of the complementary absorption with that of the two acceptors (see Fig. S17, ESI†). The optimal conditions for preparing the devices were obtained by choosing the spin-coating speed and annealing temperatures carefully. The active layers were spin-coated from a solution of o-dichlorobenzene. The optimized weight ratio of D/A was 1:1, and the optimized thickness of the active layer was about 95 nm. The active layer was deposited at a spin-coating rate of 1600 rpm from their concentrated solutions (concentration, 20 mg mL−1). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs with optimized devices under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are given in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, of the devices are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). Notably, the most efficient photovoltaic cells were obtained from the BHJ systems using TPA-PDI3 with PBDB-T, which showed a peak PCE of up to 5.84% with a Jsc of 10.27 mA cm−2, and a Voc of 0.91 V and FF of 0.624. In contrast, the TPA-PDI2-based OPVs exhibited PCEmax = 1.314% with Jsc = 3.837 ± 0.201 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.865 ± 0.005 V, and FF = 0.368 ± 0.004. We infer that the obvious enhancement in the PCE values probably results from the improved charge transfer and superior morphology of the active layer, which decreases energy loss from charge recombination.

Fig. 5(right) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 based optimized OSCs. The Jsc values obtained by integrating the EQE curves with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum are in accord with those obtained from the J–V measurements (within 5% mismatch). The optimized device showed a broad photo-to-current response from 350 to 680 nm with a maximum value of 67% and over 50% across the range of 500–650 nm, indicating a relatively efficient photoelectron conversion process.
2.5. Charge carrier mobility
To understand the differences of Jsc and FF of the different acceptor devices, the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the blend films in space-charge-limited current (SCLC) devices were measured. The device structures of the electron only and hole only devices are ITO/ZnO/active layers/ZrAcAc/Al and ITO/V2O5/active layers/V2O5/Al, respectively. The corresponding SCLC devices are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the corresponding electron/hole mobility data are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). The hole/electron mobilities for the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI2 and PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 blends are 5.65 × 10−4/2.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 2.53) and 7.84 × 10−4/3.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 2.03), respectively. For the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 devices with a better PCE, higher and more balanced mobilities are good for effective charge transport and thus contribute to the excellent JSC and FF.
The unbalanced charge transport may be responsible for the low EQE and FF observed for TPA-PDI2.
2.6. Morphology characterization
The morphology of BHJ films is known to closely correlate to mobility, Jsc, and finally PCE. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode was utilized to obtain the surface morphology of the blend films. As illustrated from the height and phase images in Fig. 6, the root mean square (RMS) values of blend films of PDBT-T:TPA-PDI2 and PDBT-T:TPA-PDI3 were measured to be 1.07 and 0.92 nm, respectively. The lower RMS values for the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI2 and PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 blend films indicate that the acceptor materials TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 exhibit a good miscibility with the PBDB-T molecule in the blend films and may form a finer interpenetrating network, which facilitates both exciton separation and charge transport.4g

2.7. Photocurrent density and effective voltage study
The exciton dissociation and charge extraction of the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI2 and PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 based OSCs were studied by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff). As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S5 (ESI†), the Jphs of the two OSCs reached saturation (Jsat) at voltages approaching 3 V, and the Jsats after annealing were 4.732 mA cm−2 and 10.875 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI2 and PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 based OSCs, respectively. After annealing treatment, the probabilities of exciton dissociation calculated from Jph/Jsat under the short circuit conditions and probabilities of charge collection calculated from Jph/Jsat under the maximal power output conditions were 85.8% and 53.4% for the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI2 based OSCs, and 94.4% and 80.0% for the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 based OSCs, respectively. Obviously, the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 based OSCs showed apparently higher exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities than those of the PBDB-T:TPA-PDI2 based OSCs, which is beneficial for realizing a large JSC and FF.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, two novel small molecule acceptors, TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3, consisting of a triphenylamine core and pyran-annulated perylene diimides (Py-PDIs) were designed and synthesized. Owing to the presence of the unique TPA core, TPA-PDI2 and TPA-PDI3 not only feature a rigid 3D conformation, but also exhibit suitable absorption properties and high electron mobility. The fabricated BHJ OSCs on the basis of PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 exhibit good performance with a high PCE of up to 5.84%, which is the first report of Py-PDIs-based non-fullerene acceptors. The result demonstrates that Py-PDIs are a promising building block for the construction of structurally non-planar PDI derivatives as non-fullerene electron acceptors for highly efficient OSCs.

4.2.3. Synthesis of TPA-PDI3. 

Py-PDI-Br (550 mg, 0.534 mmol), TPA-3EY (50 mg, 0.157 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (100 mg) and CuI (60 mg) were added to a round bottom flask with the protection of Ar2 gas, then dry toluene (20 mL) and dry diisopropylamine (5 mL) were injected into it. The reaction was stirred at 80 °C overnight. The cooled mixture was extracted with dichloromethane and water. The residue was purified by column chromatography (eluent, hexane/DCM, 20:1, 1:1), which yielded TPA-PDI3 as a purple solid (160 mg, 31% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 10.22 (s, 1H), 8.46–8.24 (m, 3H), 7.77–7.75 (m, 3H), 7.38 (d, 2H), 4.10–4.07 (m, 4H), 1.93–1.80 (m, 8H), 1.26–1.11 (m, 64H), 0.83–0.73 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 163.33, 163.11, 162.73, 162.36, 151.59, 146.98, 134.18, 133.38, 132.79, 132.29, 126.60, 125.30, 125.02, 124.54, 123.45, 122.98, 122.38, 120.55, 119.52, 115.35, 101.48, 92.21, 80.19, 31.92, 31.84, 31.69, 30.14, 30.10, 29.74, 29.72, 29.68, 29.66, 29.60, 29.58, 29.38, 29.30, 26.65, 26.48, 22.68, 22.60, 14.11, 14.09, 14.03.

Analytical calculation for C225H291N7O15: C, 81.06; H, 8.80; N, 2.94; experimental result: C, 80.88; H, 8.79; N, 2.95.

4.3. Computational method
The geometry was optimized by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP hybrid functional with the basis set 6-31G(d).16 Quantum chemical calculation was performed using the Gaussian 09 package. The long alkyl chains were replaced with an isopropyl group for simplification.
4.4. Device fabrication and characterization
Solar cells were fabricated in a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Zracac/Al. The ITO substrates were first scrubbed by detergent and then sonicated with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol subsequently, and dried overnight in an oven. The glass substrates were treated by UV-Ozone for 20 min before use. The PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP A 4083) layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and then dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The donor:acceptor blends with a 1:1 ratio were dissolved in O-dichlorobenzene (the concentration of the blend solutions are 20 mg mL−1 for all blend films) and stirred overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The blend solution was spin-cast at 1600 rpm for 40 s on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the residual solvent. A thin Zracac layer (10 nm) and Al layer (100 nm) were sequentially evaporated through a shadow mask under a vacuum of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area was 4.50 mm2. The area of each device was 3.14 mm2 defined by a shadow mask. The optimal blend thickness was about 95 nm, measured on a Bruker Dektak XT stylus profilometer. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. Photocurrent was measured using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured by a calibrated silicon solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). EQE spectra were measured by using a QEX10 Solar Cell EQE measurement system (PV measurements, Inc.).
