    , Accepted 4th December 2015First published on 7th December 2015AbstractFlexible organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a blend of low-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH and non-fullerene small molecule acceptor IEIC were fabricated via a roll-coating process under ambient atmosphere. Both an indium tin oxide (ITO)-free substrate and a flexible ITO substrate were employed in these inverted OSCs. OSCs with flexible ITO and ITO-free substrates exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 2.26% and 1.79%, respectively, which were comparable to those of the reference devices based on fullerene acceptors under the same conditions. This is the first example for all roll-coating fabrication procedures for flexible OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors with the PCE exceeding 2%. The fullerene-free OSCs exhibited better dark storage stability than the fullerene-based control devices.
Introduction
In the past two decades, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), which are based on a blend of bicontinuous and interpenetrating electron donors and acceptors in a bulk volume, have been attracting much attention in both academic and industrial fields since they present some advantages, such as low cost, light weight, solution process and capability to fabricate flexible large area devices.1–10 Extensive efforts have been focused on the design and synthesis of novel high-mobility and narrow-bandgap donor materials,11–16 and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction OSCs have been 10%,17–19 and nearly 12% for tandem OSCs.20,21
On the other hand, electron acceptors also play an important role in OSCs. Unfortunately, the development of acceptor materials has lagged behind that of donor materials.22,23 As the most commonly used electron acceptors, fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its C70-based homologue (PC71BM), exhibit high electron affinity, high electron mobility, isotropic charge transport, and excellent ability to form a nanoscale network with electron donors.24–26 However, they have some shortcomings, such as weak absorption in the visible region, restricted energy level tuning, relatively high cost27 and easy diffusion and aggregation which affect morphology stability and long-term device stability.28 In order to address these issues, novel alternative electron acceptors were developed.29–37 The PCEs of solution processed BHJ OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors have reached 4–8%.38–52
As the most common fabrication process for solution processed OSCs in lab, spin coating of active layers and vacuum evaporation of counter electrodes on a rigid glass substrate are unfavorable for their transformation from lab-scale to industry-scale production. Recently, a roll-to-roll (R2R) based fabrication technique has been demonstrated as a promising method for mass production of OSCs and has attracted increasing attention due to its advantages of high speed, high throughput, large area, compatibility with a flexible substrate, without expensive transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxide (ITO), without vacuum evaporated electrodes, and fabrication under ambient atmosphere.53–60 However, most of these studies were based on fullerene acceptors, and a few were based on non-fullerene acceptors, which exhibited low PCEs (generally <1%).61–63 There has been no comparative study on fullerene and non-fullerene-based roll-coated devices.
We recently reported a non-fullerene acceptor based on a indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene core end-capped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, IEIC (Fig. 1a).45 IEIC exhibited strong and broad absorption in the region from 500 to 750 nm, and a relatively high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The HOMO (−5.42 eV) and LUMO (−3.82 eV) energy levels can match with typical narrow-bandgap polymer donors. The spin coated devices based on a blend of a narrow-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH16 and IEIC acceptor showed a highest PCE of 5.24% and 6.31% without and with a cathode interlayer, respectively.

In this work, we demonstrated fully roll-coating fabrication of flexible, fullerene-free OSCs based on a blend of PTB7-TH:IEIC with ITO-free and flexible ITO substrates (Fig. 1b and c) which were compared with fullerene-based control devices. Our devices were fabricated on a mini roll-coater which was constructed to mimic the coating conditions of full scale roll-to-roll production.64 All the fabrication procedures were carried out in ambient atmosphere with the silver grids (bottom and top) printed by flexographic printing whereas the remaining layers were fabricated by slot-die coating. These flexible fullerene-free OSCs based on ITO-free and ITO substrates showed highest PCEs of 1.79% and 2.26%, respectively, which were comparable to those of PC61BM-based devices under the same conditions. This is the first example reported for fully roll-coating fabrication of flexible, non-fullerene OSCs with the PCE exceeding 2%. The fullerene-free OSCs exhibited better dark storage stability than the fullerene-based control devices.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless stated otherwise, solvents and chemicals were obtained commercially and used without further purification. PTB7-TH was purchased from 1-Material Inc. PC61BM was purchased from Nano-C Inc. Dichlorobenzene (DCB), chlorobenzene (CB), and isopropanol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. IEIC was synthesized according to our previous report.45 Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (25 nm) in IPA with a concentration of 56 mg ml−1 were self-synthesized.
We employed two types of flexible substrates. For the ITO-free substrate, a Flextrode was employed, consisting of the poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) substrate of Melinex ST506 obtained from Dupont-Teijin, which was then further prepared by subsequent R2R processing of a bottom Ag grid, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer and a ZnO layer according to the literature.64,65 The bottom Ag grid electrode was printed using a flexographic printing silver paste of PFI-722 purchased from PChem Associates. Two types of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS were employed. PEDOT:PSS Clevios PH1000 from Heraeus was diluted with IPA in a ratio of 10:3 (w/w) and used as the bottom PEDOT:PSS layer. PEDOT:PSS Orgacon EL-P5010 was diluted with IPA in a ratio of 2:1 (w/w) and used as the top PEDOT:PSS layer. The top Ag electrodes were printed using a flexographic printing silver paste of 5025 purchased from Dupont. The PET/Ag substrate had a sheet resistivity of 10 Ω sq−1, and the bottom PEDOT:PSS layer had a sheet resistivity of 60–90 Ω sq−1. The sheet resistivity of the top PEDOT:PSS layer was 60 Ω sq−1, and that of the top Ag electrode was 0.1 Ω sq−1. For the flexible ITO substrate, the stripe-patterned PET/ITO foil was obtained from CP-films Inc, with a sheet resistance of 45 Ω sq−1.
Fabrication of roll-coated OSCs
Roll-coated OSCs with an inverted structure were fabricated on both ITO-free and flexible ITO substrates, with the structure PET/Ag/PEDOT:PSS PH1000/ZnO/PTB7-TH:IEIC or PTB7-TH:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010/Ag and PET/ITO/ZnO/PTB7-TH:IEIC or PTB7-TH:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010/Ag, respectively. For the devices based on the ITO-free substrate, they were fabricated by the following procedure. The ITO-free Flextrode, consisting of PET-foil with a flexographically printed bottom Ag grid, a rotary screen printed highly conductive PEDOT:PSS PH1000 layer and a slot-die coated ZnO electron transporting layer (ETL), was used as pre-prepared by fixing 1 meter of foil to the drum of the roll-coater using 3M heat stable tape (Fig. 2a). After that, the solution of the active layer, including a blended film of PTB7-TH:IEIC with various ratios (1:1.25, 1:1.5, and 1:1.75) in a total concentration of 22.5, 25, and 27.5 mg ml−1, respectively, in DCB or CB solvent, or PTB7-TH:PC61BM (1:1.5, 25 mg ml−1 in DCB), was transferred from a syringe via the pump to the slot-die head, and roll-coated on the top of Flextrode with a further offset of 1 mm (to prevent shorting of the device), under the conditions of 70 °C roll temperature, 1 m min−1 web speed and 0.2 cm3 min−1 solution delivery speed affording a wet thickness of 20 μm. Subsequently, the top PEDOT:PSS layer, employed as the hole transporting layer (HTL), was slot-die coated on top of the active layer with a further offset of 1 mm, under the conditions of 70 °C roll temperature, 1 m min−1 web speed and 1.3 cm3 min−1 solution delivery speed affording a wet thickness of 130 μm, using a diluted PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010 with IPA in a ratio of 2:1 (w/w) (Fig. 2b). After the top PEDOT:PSS layer was dried, the top Ag electrode was printed using a flexographic printing silver paste. The Ag paste was added to the flexographic roll and transferred on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 2c). Finally, the substrate was transferred into an oven at 100 °C for 3 min in order to dry the Ag paste.

For the devices on the flexible ITO substrate, they were fabricated by the following procedure. Firstly, the stripe-patterned PET/ITO substrate (Fig. 3a) was fixed to the drum of the roll coater with 3M heat stable tape, and subsequently pre-wetted by IPA in order to clean the dust and ensure a good contact with the ZnO layer. The ZnO layer was then slot-die coated on top of stripe-patterned ITO under the conditions of 40 °C roll temperature, 1 m min−1 web speed and 0.04 cm3 min−1 solution delivery speed affording a wet thickness of 4 μm, employed as the ETL. After that, the deposit of the active layer, top PEDOT:PSS layer and top Ag electrodes were fabricated in the same way as the devices based on the ITO-free substrate (Fig. 3b and c). Long stripes of PET/Ag/PEDOT:PSS PH1000/ZnO/PTB7-TH:IEIC or PTB7-TH:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010/Ag (Fig. 2d) and PET/ITO/ZnO/PTB7-TH:IEIC or PTB7-TH:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010/Ag (Fig. 3d) could be divided into hundreds of individual cells with an active area of 0.95–1.05 cm2 for those on the ITO-free substrate and 0.65–0.7 cm2 on the flexible ITO substrate (measured accurately by light beam induced current, LBIC).66 The whole fabrication process was carried out in ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C and 40 ± 10% relative humidity), and could be finished in less than 2 h.

Characterization
The photovoltaic performance of roll-coated OSCs was measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under a KHS 575 solar simulator with an AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 intensity. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a solar cell spectral response measurement system QEX10. The surface morphology of the roll-coated film of PTB7-TH:IEIC and PTB-TH:PC61BM was investigated using a Veeco Nanoscopy V atomic force microscope (AFM). The LBIC measurement was carried out using a custom made setup with a 405 nm laser diode (5 mW output power, 100 μm spot size ≈ 65 W cm−2, ThorLabs)66 mounted on a computer controlled XY-stage and focused to a spot size of <100 μm. The short circuit current from the device under study was measured using a computer controlled source measure unit (SMU, a Keithley 2400 instrument). A custom written computer program was used to scan the solar cell devices in a raster pattern in 200 μm steps in the X and the Y directions, logging the coordinates and measured current. The results were then converted to yellow/black colored bitmaps in 255 different tones with another custom written program. Bright yellow represented the highest absolute current extracted while blue represented the lowest current. Current profiles along selected directions were taken from these maps to visualize the relative differences in different regions. The dark storage stability tests of roll-coated OSCs based on IEIC and PC61BM were carried out under the illumination of a KHS 575 solar simulator with an AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 intensity in the ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C and 40 ± 10% relative humidity). The ITO-based devices for the photovoltaic performance measurement, EQE measurement, LBIC measurement and stability test were unencapsulated, and the ITO-free devices for measurements were encapsulated by two glass slides with a UV curable epoxy resin.
Results and discussion
Photovoltaic performance
In order to evaluate the potential of IEIC as an non-fullerene acceptor in roll-coated, flexible and scalable OSCs based on both flexible ITO and ITO-free substrates, several parameters, such as the solvent and donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of the active layer, were investigated. For the ITO-free OSCs with 1:1.25, 1:1.5 and 1:1.75 of D/A weight ratios in CB and DCB solvents, the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and 4a. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the average and best data of the ITO-free devices under different conditions. Relative to those with a CB solvent, the devices processed with a DCB solvent generated higher short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC), and the D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 led to the highest JSC and fill factor (FF). The ITO-free OSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 and DCB solvent exhibited the highest PCE of 1.79%, with a VOC of 0.903 V, a JSC of 5.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 36.71%, which was comparable to the champion of the reference devices based on a PC61BM acceptor under the same conditions (Table 1 and Fig. S2a†). For the flexible ITO-based OSCs with 1:1.25, 1:1.5 and 1:1.75 of D/A weight ratios in DCB solvent, the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4b. The D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 yielded the highest PCE of 2.26%, with a VOC of 0.938 V, a JSC of 6.86 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35.17%, which was also similar to the champion of the PC61BM-based reference devices under the same conditions (Table 1 and Fig. S2b†).

The roll-coated non-fullerene OSCs based on flexible ITO and ITO-free substrates exhibited a relatively high VOC, which was 0.1–0.15 V higher than that of the PC61BM-based reference devices. This coincided with the difference in the LUMO levels of these two acceptors (−3.82 eV for IEIC and −3.9 eV for PC61BM24). However, the JSC of the non-fullerene devices was lower than that of the PC61BM-based devices, which was likely due to the lower electron mobility of IEIC than that of PC61BM. The JSC of the ITO-based OSCs was higher than that of ITO-free OSCs, owing to the lower optical transmittance of the ITO-free Flextrode than that of the flexible ITO substrate.67 Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the normal distribution of PCEs of 30 flexible ITO-based devices with blended films of PTB7-TH:IEIC and PTB7-TH:PC61BM under the same conditions. The non-fullerene OSCs exhibited an average PCE of 2.05%, with a more narrow distribution compared with the fullerene devices.
The insets of Fig. 4a and b show the LBIC images of roll-coated non-fullerene OSCs based on ITO-free and flexible ITO substrates, respectively. LBIC is a well-established 2D mapping technique for the characterization of solar cells and calculation of device areas.66 The measured current response for each point could be transferred into a scale of colour tone. The brighter colour represented a stronger current response, while the darker colour represented a weaker current response. These two images showed a uniform current response over the whole active area. The device areas were measured to be 0.98 and 0.66 cm2 for ITO-free and ITO substrates, respectively. All the devices could be controlled in the range of 0.95–1.05 cm2 for the ITO-free substrate and 0.65–0.70 cm2 for the ITO substrate. The ITO-based OSCs exhibited a brighter colour and stronger current response than the ITO-free OSCs, resembling the JSC measurement.

Fig. 4c shows the EQE spectra of the roll-coated non-fullerene OSCs based on ITO-free and flexible ITO substrates under the optimized conditions. These two devices exhibited broad and strong EQE spectra in the region from 500 nm to 800 nm, with a maximum EQE of 27% and 34% for ITO-free and ITO-based devices, respectively. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the measurement of photovoltaic performance, the JSC values were calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra. The calculated JSC was 5.15 and 6.63 mA cm−2 for the ITO-free and ITO-based devices, respectively, which had a 4.5% and 3.4% mismatch with those measured under a AM 1.5G solar simulator.
Morphology
In order to compare the difference of the surface morphology between the blended films of PTB7:IEIC (1:1.5 w/w) and PTB7:PC61BM (1:1.5 w/w) fabricated by slot-die coating, AFM was carried out. These two films exhibited a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains. The film of PTB7-TH:PC61BM showed a smoother surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.98 nm compared with the film of PTB7-TH:IEIC with a roughness of 2.1 nm (Fig. 5a and c). In addition, the film of PTB7-TH:PC61BM exhibited a smaller phase separation compared with the film of PTB7-TH:IEIC, which led to a larger area of the D/A interface and coincided with the higher JSC.
 Fig. 5  AFM height images of the blended films of PTB7:IEIC (1:1.5, w/w, DCB solvent) (a and b) and PTB7-TH:PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w, DCB solvent) (c and d) as cast (a and c) and exposed at 80 °C for 24 h (b and d). The scan sizes for all images are 3 μm × 3 μm. 
The morphological stability of non-fullerene and PC61BM-based devices was characterized by AFM before and after exposure at an elevated temperature of 80 °C (comparable to maximum solar cell operation temperature) for 24 h in an inert atmosphere. After exposure at 80 °C for 24 h, RMS roughness of the PTB7-TH:IEIC thin film slightly changed from 2.1 to 2.6 nm, while that of the PTB7-TH:PCBM thin film significantly increased from 0.98 to 2.1 nm (Fig. 5b and d), indicating that PTB7-TH:IEIC showed better morphological stability.
Stability test
The dark storage stability of the unencapsulated roll-coated OSCs with the flexible ITO substrate based on blended films of PTB7-TH:IEIC and PTB7-TH:PC61BM (both processed by DCB solvent and 1:1.5 D/A weight ratio) in ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C, 40 ± 10% relative humidity) was measured. As shown in Fig. S4,† the devices based on blended films of PTB7-TH:IEIC exhibited slightly better dark storage stability (retained 70% after 150 h) than those based on blended films of PTB7:PC61BM (retained 60% after 150 h). Fig. S5† shows the LBIC images of the flexible ITO-based devices based on blended films of PTB7-TH:IEIC and PTB7-TH:PC61BM before and after dark storage in the ambient atmosphere. The decay of PCEs was mainly due to the loss of photocurrent, and the LBIC image of the device based on PTB7-TH:IEIC after 180 h was slightly brighter than that of the device based on PTB7-TH:PC61BM, which was consistent with the stability test.
The continuous illumination stability test of unencapsulated and encapsulated IEIC- and PC61BM-based devices (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, 80 ± 5 °C, and in ambient atmosphere) was also carried out (Fig. S6†). For unencapsulated devices, IEIC-based devices exhibited better stability than PCBM-based devices, which coincides with the dark storage stability. For encapsulated devices, both IEIC and PC61BM based devices showed good continuous illumination stability, indicating that with proper encapsulation, long operational stability can be expected.
Conclusions
We fabricated ITO-free and ITO-based OSCs based on blends of polymer donor PTB7-TH and non-fullerene acceptor IEIC by a roll-coating process which were compared with fullerene-based control devices. All devices had a relatively large device area (0.95–1.05 cm2 for the ITO-free substrate and 0.65–0.7 cm2 for the flexible ITO substrate), and were fabricated in ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C, 40 ± 10% relative humidity). The non-fullerene devices based on ITO-free and flexible ITO substrates exhibited the highest PCEs of 1.79% and 2.26%, respectively, which were comparable to those of the PC61BM-based reference devices under the same conditions. The fullerene-free OSCs exhibited better dark storage stability than the fullerene-based control devices. These results demonstrated that non-fullerene acceptors have potential for large scale production of high-performance OSCs.
