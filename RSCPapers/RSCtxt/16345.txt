In situ
        diffuse reflectance UV-visible, Raman scattering and EPR experiments, carried out as a function of time after phenothiazine (PTZ) direct exposure to thermally activated acid HnZSM-5 zeolite without any solvent, provide evidence of phenothiazine sorption and simultaneous spontaneous ionization. For comparison, phenothiazine behavior was investigated within non acidic zeolite and showed that most of the phenothiazine molecules were occluded as intact molecules and that ionization was very weak. The multivariate curve resolution analysis of the diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra set recorded during the sorption process resolve the absorption spectra and respective concentrations of individual species involved in the sorption course. When PTZ entered through the acidic zeolite channels, PTZ˙+@HnZSM-5˙− radical pair is generated by the polarization energy. Subsequent PTZ2+ formation was fast but only partial. After months, equilibrium including PTZ˙+, PTZ2+ and occluded PTZ was reached within acid HnZSM-5 but depends on the Si/Al ratio: the higher the Al content, the easier the spontaneous ionization. The close match between PTZ and the pore size of zeolites combined with efficient polarizing effect of proton and aluminium electron trapping sites appear to be the most important factors responsible for the stabilization of PTZ˙+ and PTZ2+ and hinder efficiently the charge recombination. No evidence of Brønsted acid sites of HnZSM-5 was found during the sorption of phenothiazine through generation of protonated species.
Introduction

Phenothiazine and its derivatives have been investigated first for their interesting pharmacological activity. Due to their ease of oxidation, phenothiazine and parent molecules might act as charge or electron transfer donors at drug receptor sites. The high electron donor ability is due to electron rich sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms. Particularly, stable radical cations formed by phenothiazines are assumed to be of some importance in their biological activity.1 More recently, the phenothiazine derivatives have been a subject of wide interest because of their exceptional electro-optical properties and their utilization in potential solar energy conversion applications. In particular, molecular systems of the type donor–bridge–acceptor in which the phenothiazine derivatives stand for the electron donor were investigated to simulate efficient electron transfer in the photosynthetic reaction centers.2,3 However, the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer is generally hampered by rapid back electron transfers. In contrast, long-lived charge separation is generally achieved at room temperature by the use of heterogeneous environments where the molecular mobility is restricted. Heterogeneous host systems provide much better environment than homogeneous solution systems and the photoinduced radicals are typically more stable in solid systems. Photoionization of phenothiazine and derivatives was carried out in numerous media like micelles,4vesicles, silica gel,5fullerene,6 microporous7 as well as mesoporous8–13 molecular sieves. To date, N-alkylphenothiazines proved to be excellent photoactive electron donor molecules and were extensively studied as a function of the alkyl chain length and of pore size. Nevertheless, most of these studies were carried out at the mesoporous scale and did not give information on the fate of the transient species on very long time scale. However, the entrapment of molecules within medium-pore zeolites is known to limit the tendency of free radicals to dimerize and to prevent access of reagents that would typically cause their rapid decay in solution. The close match between molecular size and the ZSM-5 channel was reported to be a major feature for trapping the long-lived radical pairs in the porous void space.14,15 Moreover, so far it is well known that typical environment with high polarization and high confinement effect such as zeolites can induce spontaneous ionization of low ionization potential molecules.15–20 The capacity of zeolites to give rise to radical cation is generally associated with the presence of acid sites even if ionization occurred spontaneously in non Brønsted zeolite.21

Phenothiazine (PTZ) is a molecule with a low ionization potential value (Ig = 6.73 eV) and has the appropriate dimensions to enter through the 10-ring oxygen window of the ZSM-5 channels and to diffuse in the pore networks, Fig. 1. In the present work, we employ diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption (DRUVv), FT and resonance Raman scattering and X-band continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectroscopy to monitor the course of phenothiazine sorption in Brønsted acidic medium pore zeolites HnZSM-5 (n = 0.17, 3.4, 6.6) with Hn(AlO2)n(SiO2)96−n unit cell formulae, under dry and inert atmosphere without any solvent. The phenothiazine incorporation in non Brønsted acidic silicalite-1 was also investigated for comparison. The multivariate chemometric methods were essential to resolve the UV-visible absorption spectra and the molecular concentrations of individual species involved in the sorption course. Applying pulsed X-band EPR techniques, we were able to reveal the structural surrounding of the unpaired electrons of charge separated states through the proper assignment of electron couplings using the two-dimensional hyperfine-sublevel correlation experiment, termed 2D-HYSCORE.

Experimental
Materials
The as-synthesized purely siliceous silicalite-1 sample (SiO2)96 was a gift from Dr Patarin (Laboratoire des Matériaux à Porosité Contrôlée, UMR-CNRS 7016 Mulhouse, France). The starting highly siliceous MFI material (Si/Al ≈ 5000) has been synthesized in fluoride medium in the presence of an organic template. As-synthesized ZSM-5 samples (Si/Al = 0.17, 13.5, 27, average particle size 1 μm) were obtained according to the template procedure in alkaline medium from VAW aluminum (Schwandorf, Germany) and Zeolyst International (USA).
The ZSM-5 zeolites were calcined under air to evacuate the template. The extra framework cations were completely exchanged by NH4+. All the zeolite samples were obtained by a calcination procedure up to 723 K under argon.22,23 The unit cell composition of the calcined HnZSM-5 samples were H6.6(AlO2)6.6(SiO2)89.4 (Si/Al = 13.5), H3.4(AlO2)3.4(SiO2)92.6 (Si/Al = 27) and H0.17(AlO2)0.17(SiO2)95.8 (Si/Al = 560) from elemental analysis. The chemical analyses, powder XRD patterns, 29Si, 27Al MAS-NMR, IR, Raman, DRUVv, and EPR spectra of bare ZSM-5 zeolites were characteristic of well-crystallized diamagnetic porous compounds with the above formulae. However, the 27Al NMR spectra of hydrated H6.6ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 13.5) sample provide evidence of small amounts of extraframework hexacoordinated Al species.24 The EPR spectroscopic investigations indicate iron impurities at trace levels in the zeolite samples of commercial sources. These impurities are not detected by conventional elemental analyses. The phenothiazine (C12H9NS, Fluka) was purified by sublimation and stored over molecular sieves. Pure and dry Ar gas was used.
PTZ Sorption in MnZSM-5
Weighed amounts (∼1.4 g) of powdered hydrated zeolite Hn(AlO2)n(SiO2)96−n (n = 0, 0.17, 3.4, 6.6) were introduced into an evacuable heatable silica cell. The samples were heated up to 723 K under dry argon. Then, the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature under dry argon. Weighed amounts of PTZ corresponding to 1 PTZ/UC were introduced into the cell under dry argon and the powder mixture was shaken. The powders were transferred under dry argon in a quartz glass Suprasil cell for Raman and DRUVv experiments or in cylindrical EPR quartz tube and sealed. The powder mixtures were left at 313 K. The Brønsted and Lewis acidities of the calcined Hn(AlO2)n(SiO2)96−n samples were characterized by FTIR measurements using pyridine as probe molecule.25
Molecular modeling
The molecular modeling of the PTZ preferred sorption sites in (SiO2)96 and H4(AlO2)4(SiO2)92 zeolites were performed using the Material Studio Modeling package (version 4.0) from Accelrys International. The zeolite structural parameters and partial atomic charges of M4(AlO2)4(SiO2)92 were taken from previous works.26,27 The structural parameters and set of partial atomic charges of PTZ were derived from previous structural and theoretical works.28–30 The non-bonding Lennard-Jones (L-J) force field values were taken from previous works.26,31 The simulation box of ZSM-5 was a supercell that consisted of 2 × 2 × 4 orthorhombic cells. In the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the Si, Al, O and H positions were fixed in the simulation box. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. The geometry of PTZ has been established previously and the crystal structure shows that the molecule is folded about the N–S axis with the two planes containing the phenyl rings having a dihedral angle of 158.5°.32 In molecular simulation, the PTZ structure was taken to be rigid. The MC simulations at 1 PTZ/UC loading were carried out at 300 K using the conventional Metropolis algorithm taking into account the non-bonding interactions (EZS) between the O and H+ atoms of zeolite and the C and H atoms of PTZ as well as the non-bonding interactions (ESS) between PTZ. The interactions inside the zeolite were modeled by L-J and coulombic forces. (1)A cut-off radius of 0.9 nm was applied to the L-J interactions. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Ewald summation technique.33
The simulation takes a number of steps to equilibrate from its original random position. For accurate statistical results, the steps made prior to equilibration have been excluded from the analysis. One typical MC run took 1500000 steps. From each sorption trajectory, a histogram of the energy distribution for each sorbate was generated. In a so-called mass-cloud analysis the centre of mass of each sorbate in each configuration was displayed as a dot in the model space. In the molecular mechanics (MM) simulations the time consuming Ewald summation has not been performed. The zeolite framework was taken to be rigid and rigid PTZ were taken to be mobile. (2)The electrostatic and (L-J) interaction cut-offs are defined by two parameters: the spline-on and the spline-off distances. Within these ranges the nonbonded interaction energy is attenuated by a spline function. Beyond the spline-off distance non-bonded interactions were ignored. The spline-on and spline-off distances were taken to be 1.5 and 3 nm for both the electrostatic and (L-J) interactions. The energy minimization of non-bonding sorbate–zeolite energy was performed using the conjugate gradient minimization procedure.
Instrumentation


            Diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption. 
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the samples were recorded between 200 and 900 nm using a Cary 3 spectrometer. The instrument was equipped with an integrating sphere to study the powdered zeolite samples through diffuse reflectance; the corresponding bare zeolite was used as the reference. The DRUVv spectra were plotted as the Kubelka-Munk function: F(R) = (1 −R)2/2R = K/S(3)where R represents the ratio of the diffuse reflectance of the loaded zeolite to that of the dehydrated neat zeolite, K designates an absorption coefficient proportional to the concentration C of chromophore and S the scattering coefficient of the powder. F(λ,t) were registered as a function of λ (wavelength) at several t (time).



Raman scattering spectroscopy
          . 
A Bruker RFS 100/S instrument was used as a near-IR FT-Raman spectrometer with a CW Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm as excitation source. A laser power of 100–200 mW was used. The spectra (3500–150 cm−1) were recorded with a resolution of 2 cm−1 using 600 scans.
Resonance Raman scattering spectra were collected on a LabRAM spectrometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba Gr.) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled charge-coupled device detector. The excitation wavelengths used were 514.5 and 632.8 nm with low laser power to avoid irreversible laser effects on the sample. The laser radiations were supplied by an argon ion laser and a helium-neon laser. 50 × Ultra Long Work Distance (Olympus ULWD) objective was used to excite and collect the Raman scattering of the sample within the cell. Laser power delivered was 8 mW and could be monitored via a filters’ wheel with optical densities 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The spectrometer calibration was verified using the Raman lines of silicon. This resulted in an accuracy of less than ±1 cm−1.



X-Band EPR spectroscopy
          . 
The CW X-band EPR spectra (dχ″/dB) and pulsed EPR experiments were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker ELEXYS 580-FT spectrometer (∼9 GHz). The EPR spectra were double integrated using Bruker software and the spin concentrations were determined relatively to a reference standard. This standard sample was calcined Na6.6(AlO2)6.6(SiO2)89.4zeolite loaded with different nitroxide amounts (3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolin-1-yloxy, free radical, 99%, Aldrich).
The 2D Electron-spin-echo envelope modulation measurements have employed the 2D-four-pulse sequence (HYSCORE) (π/2 −τ−π/2 −t1−π−t2−π/2-echo) with the appropriate phase cycling (t1 = t2). The pulsed length was, respectively, 16 and 32 ns for π/2 and π pulses. The τ values were selected to optimize the modulation from 27Al and 1H nuclei. The 2D-HYSCORE measurements were carried out with the four pulse sequence π/2 −τ−π/2 −t1−π−t2−π/2 −τ echo, and a four-step phase cycle where the echo is measured as a function of t1 and t2; t1 and t2 were incremented in steps of 16 ns from their initial value. The 2D-HYSCORE experiments were recorded with a τ value of 136 ns. Prior to Fourier transformation of the HYSCORE data the background decay was removed by a polynomial fit and apodized with a Hamming function.


Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) data processing. 
The MCR data processing of DRUVv spectral set F(λ,t) was carried out by MCR processing using the SIMPLISMA (SIMPle-to-use Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis) approach. This method was applied to extract pure UVv absorption and respective concentration (C) from huge spectral data recorded as a function of time after powder mixing without any prior information.


F
(λ,t) represents the original data matrix with spectra in rows. Primarily, it is necessary to estimate the global rank of F(λ,t) to estimate the number of pure absorbing species (k) present in the whole data set of the complex mixture. The F(λ,t) matrix is then decomposed into the following form: F(λ,t) = C(t) ×SλT + E(4)C(t) represents the ‘spectral concentration’ matrix.  represents the transpose of  (spectral matrix) and E represents the residual error. The SIMPLISMA approach was applied to resolve both the concentration matrix C(t) (k columns and t rows) and the spectral matrix  of pure compounds (k rows and λ columns).  and C(t) were calculated by standard matrix algebra according to the procedure detailed in the original publication without any prior information.34
The difference between original and reconstructed data set lower than 5% RRSSQ (relative root of sum of square differences) provides a realistic picture of the components. The relative root of sum of square differences (RRSSQ) expresses the difference between the experimental data set F(λ, t) and the calculated data set F(λ,t)calc. In a second step we used the multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) as a refined method. The optimization is carried out using C and ST initial estimates obtained by SIMPLISMA approach. Convergence is achieved when the standard deviation σ of the residuals with respect to experimental data is less than 3%. The molecular concentrations were estimated from the spectral concentration C(t) taking into account the species molecular extinction coefficients previously reported in solution.

Results
PTZ sorption in dehydrated purely siliceous silicalite-1

Molecular modeling. 
The framework structure of bare silicalite-1 zeolites contains two types of intersecting channels.35–37 Both are formed by rings of 10 oxygen atoms, characterizing them as a medium-pore zeolite. One channel type is straight and has a nearly circular opening (0.53 × 0.56 nm), while the other one is sinusoidal and has an elliptical opening (0.51 × 0.55 nm). The energy minimization procedures of the non-bonding interactions between a rigid non planar molecule and fixed zeolite framework provide a reasonable structural picture of the ability of PTZ to pass through the pore openings of silicalite-1. The molecules penetrate into the internal void space of the zeolite and the preferred locations lay in straight channels in the vicinity of the intersection with a zigzag channel (not shown).



            DRUVv absorption spectroscopy. 
Bulk solid PTZ is light yellow. When a calculated quantity of solid PTZ corresponding to 1 PTZ per silicalite-1 unit cell (UC) was exposed in the dark and under argon to dehydrated white silicalite-1 powder, no color change occurs. The inter- and intra-crystalline migrations of PTZ were monitored by conventional diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (DRUVv) as well as continuous wave CW-EPR and Raman spectroscopy (see below). The UV bands observed in the 200–350 nm wavelength regions for PTZ powder dispersed in silicalite-1 evolved slowly to intense absorption with slight wavelength changes (Fig. 2). The DRUVv absorption bands observed at 255 and 322 nm indicate PTZ complete sorption in silicalite-1 after three months at 300 K. The occluded PTZ spectrum displayed marked analogies with the PTZ absorption spectrum in methanol solution.38 Then, combined confinement and electrostatic field effects responsible for the spectral change of occluded PTZ induce only weak band shifts.

              Diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption (DRUVv) spectra recorded for 3 months after the mixing of solid PTZ and silicalite-1 dehydrated at 723 K and under argon (1 PTZ/(SiO2)96 unit cell). 
However, it is worth noting that the spectrum exhibits also weak absorption in the 400–800 nm spectral regions. These bands are tentatively assigned to the characteristic absorption features of radical cation PTZ˙+ and dication PTZ2+ in weak concentration.39–43


Raman scattering. 
The Raman spectrum of dehydrated silicalite-1 is characterized by two bands centered at 381 and 802 cm−1 (spectrum a, Fig. 3). After mixing and shaking under argon of calculated amounts of solid PTZ and dehydrated silicalite-1, the Raman spectra recorded over three months were typical of the sorption course. The kinetic of the sorption process can be estimated through the calculation of the relative intensity ratio of the 345 and 381 cm−1 lines corresponding to PTZ and silicalite-1, respectively. The spectra presented in Fig. 3 show a significant decrease of the 381 cm−1 line intensity with respect to the 345 cm−1 one as a function of time. These data indicate sorption reached equilibrium over three months at room temperature at a loading corresponding to 1 PTZ/UC. The FT-Raman spectrum recorded with the 1064.0 nm exciting line three months after mixing PTZ and silicalite-1 exhibits only the Raman spectral features of the occluded PTZ molecule (Fig. 3spectrum c) while the Raman spectrum recorded just after the mixing exhibits the Raman features of silicalite-1 and PTZ powders.44,45 However, it should be noted that two months after powder mixing, by using the 632.8 nm exciting line within the weak absorption band (400–800 nm) observed by DRUVv, two weak additional bands appear at 470 and 445 cm−1. These bands might correspond to radical cation PTZ˙+ and dication PTZ2+ main lines, respectively (see below).43–46 However, ionization yield was too weak to be detected by Raman spectrometry with off-resonance conditions.

            CW
            EPR spectroscopy
          . 
The EPR spectrum of bare silicalite-1 zeolite does not exhibit any detectable paramagnetic species. No signal was detected immediately after mixing PTZ and silicalite-1 and for the first days. After several weeks, a very weak featureless EPR signal was observed at room temperature and provided evidence of spontaneous ionization. This signal increased progressively as a function of time but remained very weak after three months.

PTZ sorption in dehydrated acidic HnZSM-5 (n = 0.17, 3.4, 6.6) zeolites

Molecular modeling. 
Energy minimization procedures of the non-bonding interactions between a rigid non-planar molecule and a fixed zeolite framework provide a reasonable structural picture of the ability of PTZ to pass through the pore openings of H-ZSM-5. The molecules penetrate into the internal void space of the zeolite (Fig. 4). The corresponding distribution of the positions occupied by the PTZ center of mass indicates that the net potential surface accessible to the molecule is maximum in the vicinity of the H+ cation with PTZ lying in the straight channel along the b direction with the central group facially coordinated to H+ cation. The main structural role of the zeolite framework appears to constrain the molecular orientation of the sorbate because of the close match between the sizes of the rod-shaped guest and the straight channel of the host. The repartition of the energy in van der Waals energy and electrostatic energy indicates the major role of the electrostatic interactions particularly through the H+–phenyl group interactions.

The white and shaded cylinders represent the H and C atoms of the PTZ (C12H9NS) molecule, respectively. Blue and yellow atoms represent N and S atoms of the molecule. The white sphere represents the charge balancing H+ cation. 



            DRUVv absorption spectroscopy. 
Several minutes after the mixing of solid PTZ (1 PTZ per unit cell) with HnZSM-5 (n = 3.4, 6.6) zeolites dehydrated at 723 K, the powder turned green. Several weeks at room temperature after mixing, the green powder turned to greenish brown.

Fig. 5 shows selected DRUVv spectra recorded as a function of time for 5 months after the mixing of solid PTZ with dehydrated Brønsted acidic H3.4ZSM-5 (1 PTZ/UC). After mixing, the UV absorption between 200 and 370 nm for powdered solid PTZ dispersed in the zeolite powder evolves to intense absorption bands in agreement with a slow sorption process. Concomitantly to the bands in the UV region, the spectra exhibit new well defined absorption bands in the visible region between 400 and 550 nm and a very broad band in the 600–850 nm spectral range. After one week, a new broad band is clearly observed between 620 and 680 nm. All these bands kept developing for several months. Five months after mixing the powders, the spectral evolution was complete (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  
              Diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption (DRUVv) spectra recorded for 5 months after the mixing of solid PTZ and H3.4ZSM-5 dehydrated at 723 K and under argon (1 PTZ/H3.4(AlO2)3.4(SiO2)92.6 unit cell). 
In order to unequivocally resolve specific absorption of individual species, data processing of the DRUVv spectra set recorded over a large period (5 months) after powder mixing was carried out using MCR methods (see experimental section). Four absorbing species were expected from the matrix rank analysis. Four pure spectra were resolved by the MCR data processing with residuals between experimental and calculated values less than 3% despite severe spectral overlap of several pure spectra. Due to its corresponding C(t)/C0 relative concentration decay observed as a function of time (Fig. 7a (▼)), the 2 band spectrum in the 200–300 nm range (Fig. 6a) was straightforwardly assigned to bulk solid PTZ. The spectrum presented in Fig. 6b displays 2 prominent maxima centered at 258 and 323 nm (Fig. 6b). These bands are assigned to occluded PTZ in agreement with the spectrum observed for PTZ adsorbed within silicalite-1 and close to that obtained in methanol solution.38 The combined confinement and electrostatic field effects responsible for the spectral change of occluded PTZ induce only weak band shifts. The spectrum with bands at 438, 476, 496, 514, 676, 742 and 817 nm (Fig. 6c) has a close resemblance with the PTZ˙+ spectra obtained both in concentrated sulfuric acid and acetonitrile solutions39–42 and provides evidence of spontaneous PTZ ionization with radical cation formation. The MCR analysis resolves also another spectrum (Fig. 6d) with an intense broad band centered at 650 nm and a weak band around 447 nm. This spectrum is assigned to phenothiazine dication PTZ2+ because of its similarity with the previously reported spectrum produced by photoinduced electron transfer in phenothiazine/semiconductor systems.43 This species was also reported in concentrated H2SO4 solution where dication formation is attributed to the oxidation of the radical cation.39,41 No evidence of the trapped electron absorption was found although the sample was prepared under strictly anhydrous conditions.

The molecular concentrations were estimated from the spectral concentrations C(t), taking into account the molecular extinction coefficients previously reported in solution. 
The molecular concentrations of the four species involved in the PTZ sorption in H3.4ZSM-5 zeolite were estimated from the spectral concentration Ck(t) calculated by the MCR procedure taking into account the corresponding molecular extinction coefficients of PTZ, PTZ˙+ previously reported in solution and assuming analogous values in both media.38,40,47 In the absence of data for PTZ2+ at 650 nm corresponding to the maximum of intensity, molecular extinction coefficient was arbitrarily taken to be analogous to that of a radical cation.

Fig. 7 shows the relative concentration for PTZ˙+, PTZ2+, PTZ and solid PTZ as a function of time obtained after mixing of PTZ with H3.4ZSM-5. It is worth noting that molecular concentrations deduced from UV-visible absorption results are normalized with respect to the spin quantities deduced from CW EPR spectra recorded during a sorption course (see above). Curve c (■) in Fig. 7 (inset) provides evidence of spontaneous ionization through the fast appearance of PTZ˙+ radical cation over 1 d. For the same time, curve d in Fig. 7 (inset) indicates that a smaller amount of PTZ molecules is also occluded as dications. Finally, curve b (inset) demonstrates that an even smaller PTZ proportion penetrates into the zeolite channel as bulk molecules. The PTZ˙+ and PTZ2+ concentrations increase quickly for the first 10 days and then more slowly up until 50 d. Beyond this time, the concentrations appear to be rather constant. The maximum bulk PTZ amount is already obtained after 10 d and did not evolve any more for longer times. Concomitantly, the solid PTZ concentration (curve a) decreases progressively to zero over 100 days (Fig. 7).
Analogous results were found after mixing PTZ with dehydrated HnZSM-5 (n = 0.17 and 6.6) even if kinetics and ionization rates increased with Al content as shown in Fig. 8. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that after 100 d the maximum PTZ˙+ amount is only slightly higher within H6.6ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 13.5) than within H3.4ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 27).

The molecular concentrations were estimated from the spectral concentrations C(t) taking into account the molecular extinction coefficient previously reported in solution. 
Then, species concentrations obtained as a function of time (Fig. 6) are in accurate agreement with the following reaction sequence occurring during the course of PTZ sorption in acidic HnZSM-5 zeolites: PTZ (solid) + HnZSM-5 → PTZ@HnZSM-5(5) PTZ (solid) + HnZSM-5 → PTZ˙+@HnZSM-5˙−(6) PTZ˙+@HnZSM-5˙−→ PTZ2+@HnZSM-52−(7)Eqn (5) relates to the simple PTZ sorption whereas eqns (6) and (7) correspond to the spontaneous ionization process and subsequent dication formation.


Raman scattering. 
The PTZ sorption process in H3.4ZSM-5 zeolite at loading corresponding to 1 PTZ per unit cell was monitored as a function of time using both FT-Raman spectrometry with exciting wavelength at 1064 nm and dispersive Raman technique with excitation wavelengths at 514.5 and 632.8 nm.
The phenothiazine is known to be folded about the S–N axis with a dihedral angle of ca. 158.5° between the two phenylene rings.45,48 PTZ with 23 atoms belongs to Cs symmetry and has 63 fundamental frequencies (33 A′ +30 A″).44,46 PTZ molecule opens up upon formation of its radical cation, and the dihedral angle increases to 172° in PTZ˙+.49Phenothiazine radical cation possesses the same symmetry as its parent molecule and radical cation showed IR and Raman spectra similar to those of its parent molecule.44–47
The FT Raman spectra recorded for 5 months after mixing are shown in Fig. 9. The solid PTZ Raman spectral features presented in Fig. 9a exhibit bands centered at 187 cm−1 (central ring boat deformation), 256 cm−1 (HCCH wagging), 345 cm−1 (central ring chair deformation), 1033 cm−1 (ring breathing), 1249 cm−1 (CNC sym stretching), 1569 cm−1 and 1598 cm−1 (ring CC stretching).44,45 After 1 d (spectrum b), new bands appeared at 358, 470, 645, 1236, 1336, 1357, 1575, and 1612 cm−1. These bands are undoubtedly due to PTZ˙+ radical cation in agreement with the spectra obtained for phenothiazine/semiconductor systems43 and in solution.44,45 In addition, PTZ2+ spectral features are identified mostly through the strong band at 447 cm−1 and the weaker ones at 1440, 1495 and 1504 cm−1.43 The prominent band centered at 1612 cm−1 might include contributions of both PTZ˙+ and PTZ2+.

FT-Raman
spectra recorded as a function of time after the mixing of solid PTZ and dehydrated H3.4ZSM-5 (a) solid PTZ; (b) 1 week after mixing; (c) 1.5 months after mixing; (d) 3 months (e) 5 months after mixing. The Raman lines observed at 187, 345 and 1033 cm−1 are assigned to PTZ; the 470, 1336, 1357 and 1612 cm−1 lines are assigned to PTZ˙+ and the 447 and 1504 cm−1 lines are assigned to PTZ2+. 
For 5 months, the spectral features of PTZ molecule are either very weak or no more visible in agreement with high PTZ˙+ and PTZ2+ concentrations and a low amount of occluded PTZ. Particularly, the intense band at 1033 cm−1 characteristic of neutral PTZ (Fig. 9, spectrum a), decreases continuously from the powder mixing and is very weak after 5 months (spectrum e). Even though solid PTZ and occluded PTZ exhibit the same spectral features as observed in silicalite-1, this band evolution provides evidence of the sorption process and simultaneous ionization. This behaviour is in accurate agreement with the ionization process shown for UV-visible experiments.
Resonance Raman scattering spectra were recorded using the 514.5 nm exciting laser line within the visible absorption bands of PTZ˙+ (514 nm) during the sorption course in H3.4ZSM-5. Only one spectrum type was obtained during this period and is shown in Fig. 10b. This spectrum displays bands at 220 cm−1 (strong), 473 (very strong), 683 (s), 946 (medium), 1030 (s), 1102 (s), 1159 (m), 1262 (s), 1343 (s), 1484 (s) and 1603 (s) cm−1. This spectrum is identical in terms of wavenumbers and relative intensities to the resonance Raman spectrum of pure PTZ˙+ obtained in oxygenated methanol using the 517 nm probe wavelength.50,51 This finding indicates weak effect of the electrostatic field in the straight channel of zeolite upon the vibrational and electronic properties of PTZ˙+. It is worth noting that the ring breathing mode at 1030 cm−1 for PTZ˙+ is not observed in off-resonance conditions by using the FT-Raman technique. As discussed above, the band observed at 1033 cm−1 in Fig. 9 is rather assigned to PTZ molecule.
 Fig. 10  Resonance Raman spectra recorded as a function of time after the mixing of solid PTZ and dehydrated H3.4ZSM-5: (a) solid PTZ; (b) 1 d after mixing; (λex = 514.5 nm) (c) 1 d after mixing (λex = 632.8 nm); (d) 10 d after mixing (λex = 632.8 nm). 
Using the 632.8 nm exciting line within the contour of the transition of PTZ2+, experiments are expected to enhance the PTZ2+ spectral features with respect to the other species through resonance effect. The obtained spectra exhibit the features of both PTZ˙+ and PTZ2+ (Fig. 10c and d). However, the relative intensity of these species depends on contact time. After one day, PTZ˙+ is clearly predominant as shown by the higher intensity of the 473 cm−1 line (PTZ˙+) with respect to the 445 cm−1 one (PTZ2+). After 10 days, the higher 445 cm−1 line intensity provides clear evidence of an increase of PTZ2+ concentration.


CW-EPR spectroscopy. 
Bare HnZSM-5 zeolite activated at 723 K under Ar, gave rise to very weak EPR signals with g = 4.26 at 100 or 300 K. This signal was assigned to Fe(III) impurities at trace levels. No signal was detected for g of 2 range, as previously reported.32 Immediately after exposure of powdered PTZ to dehydrated H3.4ZSM-5 crystals, an isotropic broad signal was detected in the g of 2 range of weak X-band CW-EPR spectra. Comparison of this signal with those of free PTZ˙+ in sulfuric acid solution39 or after PTZ photoionization in micellar solution52 indicates marked differences through the observation of a well resolved hyperfine structure in solution. However, poorly resolved spectra were already obtained for PTZ˙+ formed in faujasite zeolite53 and after photoionization in layered zirconium phosphate.11
The incorporation was followed by CW-EPR spectroscopy. EPR signals increased very quickly in intensity for the first days to reach a plateau after about 50 d until one year. The EPR signal recorded after 96 h consists of a lorentzian line centered at g = 2.0053 with a linewidth of about 20 G whereas after five months and until one year, the X-band EPR spectra display a broadening effect (Fig. 11). Spin quantity and ionization yield were estimated during sorption course by comparing the areas obtained by double integration of the first derivative EPR signals in the g = 2 region for the sample and for the nitroxide radical standard. Under these conditions, the radical cation concentration reached 25% after 3 d and 50% after 100 d at 293 K with respect to the whole PTZ.
 Fig. 11  Continuous-wave EPR spectra recorded at room temperature 96 h (a) and 1 year (b) after the mixing of solid PTZ and dehydrated H3.4ZSM-5. 
After one year the EPR signal consists of two components, a narrow lorentzian line and a broad gaussian line at room temperature. The signal was recorded at various temperatures from 120 to 4 K and the absorption spectrum exhibits clearly that the temperature decrease results in a linewidth increase until 42 G with a pure gaussian line. This spectrum is very different from that recorded at 4 K after 10 d (Fig. 12). This lineshape behaviour (i.e. change from lorentzian to gaussian shape) by exchange dipolar broadening effect is probably due to ejected electron (electron–electron interaction within the zeolite framework). In order to solve the unsolved hyperfine interaction in the CW spectrum, pulsed EPR experiment using HYSCORE sequence was carried out. The spectrum was recorded with a tau value of 136 ns which minimizes the blind spot effects for 1H and 27Al. The 2D-HYSCORE principally shows a proton pattern centred at 14.5 MHz with a cross-peak ridge that coordinates (9.1–20.1, 20.1–9.1 MHz) (Fig. 13). Such proton pattern results from proton distribution of the PTZ˙+. Additionally, we can observe the 27Al nuclear Larmor frequency along the diagonal but no cross-peak can be detected indicating very weak coupling with the ejected electron. The radical cation electronic structure and the hyperfine coupling (Fermi contact term) constant have been computed from the nuclear spin density ρ(rx) using the following equation:54 a(X) = 2μ0/3ℏgeβegxβxρ(rx)(8)Hyperfine coupling constants and principal values of dipolar tensor were calculated using programs of the ORCA suite.55 Optimized geometries were calculated using density functional theory with B3LYP density functional method using triple zeta with valence polarized (TZVP) basis set for geometry optimization. This basis well describes the core region of electron density and allows us to compare directly the experimental and theoretical hyperfine coupling constants. The given results provide evidence of large electron-nuclei coupling in PTZ˙+ (Table 1). The A tensor calculated eigenvalues Axx = −2.16, Ayy = −2.42 and Azz 37.3 MHz for nitrogen and Axx = −0.7, Ayy = −25.2 and Azz−36.32 MHz for the proton indicate that the spin density is preferentially localized on the N–H site.

No such large coupling can be observed on the HYSCORE spectrum. Consequently, the proton pattern measured for maximum splitting Aiso + 2T = 10 MHz can arise from weaker coupling proton of radical species or from the coupling from ejected electron with proton of the zeolite. Simulation of powder CW EPR spectrum with such set of hyperfine tensor values perfectly fits the experimental one assuming lorentzian line of 12 G.
Moreover, as shown above, Raman spectroscopy data provide evidence of PTZ2+ dication formation. Therefore, if the triplet state is stabilized, it could contribute to the EPR spectrum with an S = 1 ground state by spin exchange mechanism. No such feature of intramolecular J coupling due to two electrons coupling with the Hamiltonian Hexch = −2J1–2 S1S2(9)was observed on the spectrum. A broken symmetry calculation was performed. In the case of PTZ2+ species, the calculation does not converge to a broken symmetry state indicating a pure closed shell system. The energy difference between the unrestricted triplet state and the singlet closed shell electronic structure is probably high. These results confirm that the PTZ2+ can not participate in the EPR spectrum as this structure is diamagnetic.

Discussion
Molecular modeling through Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that silicalite-1 and HZSM-5 straight channel openings are sufficiently wide to allow PTZ molecule to pass through them and to slowly diffuse into the porous void space. Experimentally, the PTZ mere exposure to activated acidic HnZSM-5 zeolite without any solvent, under dry and inert atmosphere induces molecule uptake at the zeolite pore openings and simultaneous rapid ionization. It should be noted that a weak spontaneous ionization process is also observed within silicalite-1. The DRUVv, Raman and EPR experiments provide convergent results to evidence the radical cation-electron pair PTZ˙+@HnZSM-5˙− formation and the fate of the system. The spectral data show that equilibrium is reached after several months by slow diffusion of radical cations within the straight channels and partial subsequent electron transfer to generate PTZ dication. Only a low amount of PTZ was occluded as a neutral molecule. Resonance Raman spectroscopy appears to be a sensitive and specific tool for demonstrating the presence of both PTZ radical cation and dication. EPR spectrum simulation through broken symmetry calculation demonstrated that the PTZ2+ does not contribute to the EPR spectrum because this structure is diamagnetic.
The ability of acid zeolites to act as single electron acceptors and to generate spontaneously significant amounts of radical cation upon sorption of organic compounds is well documented and ionization is known to occur through abstraction of an electron by Lewis acid sites in acid zeolites.17,56–58 The electron acceptor site is a prerequisite for the spontaneous ionization. Nevertheless, the role of the internal zeolite composition and structure relating to spontaneous ionization still gives rise to controversies. It is known that the ZSM-5 Lewis acidity increases after thermal treatment under O2 and that molecular oxygen could play a central role through a catalytic process in the spontaneous ionization of polyaromatics with high ionization energies.17,19,24,59
It should be noted that the relative amounts of Brønsted and Lewis acidities of dehydrated HnZSM-5 (n = 3.4, 6.6) were estimated by integration of the IR bands at 1545 and 1465 cm−1 after sorption of pyridine.25
The relative amounts of Lewis aluminium of dehydrated HnZSM-5 were estimated to be about 0.1 per unit cell after dehydration at 723K under argon. These amounts increase slightly after dehydration at higher temperature and under O2. The low amounts of extraframework aluminium species for n = 6.6 did not generate a noticeable effect upon Lewis acid sites amounts.60
Moreover, mass spectrometry-temperature programmed desorption experiments carried out recently provide clear evidence of the dehydrogenation of H-ZSM-5 zeolite Brønsted acid sites at temperatures above 773 K forming hydrogen gas and (AlO4)0 sites. These sites are oxidation sites and are likely the destination of the electrons abstracted from the organic molecules that form radical cations in zeolite pores.61 In the present work, the dehydration temperature never exceeds 723 K whereas dehydrogenation occurs massively during the temperature ramp from 773 to 1023 K. High dehydrogenation is not observed below 773 K and therefore, (AlO4)0oxidation sites are probably not produced in high yield at 723 K. Consequently, the spontaneous ionization process observed for PTZ can not only rely on dehydrogenation. Therefore, because of PTZ low ionization energy (6.73 eV), spontaneous ionization does not require thermal activation as well as O2activation. This reaction appears to be an intrinsic property of the zeolite framework due to the high polarization energy induced by the protons of the inner surface. The role of the internal void space was previously demonstrated by comparing ionization yield of molecules able to penetrate within HnZSM-5 straight channels or blocked at the pore entry due to steric constraints.14
Furthermore, in the case of molecules with low ionization potential like aromatic amines (e.g. N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD, 6.6 eV)) the presence of strong electron acceptor sites is not necessary and so, after gentle dehydration of silicalite-1, ionization of TMPD occurred in high yield.62 The strong electrostatic field in the porous void as well as efficient trapping sites of radical cation and ejected electron was invoked to explain this behavior. In the present study, the phenothiazine ionization potential value (6.73 eV) is close to the TMPD one and can explain the analogous behavior observed in silicalite-1. Nevertheless, the ionization rate is much lower for PTZ than for TMPD. No such spontaneous ionization was observed in silicalite-1 for biphenyl, naphthalene and anthracene molecules with relatively higher ionisation potential values (7.5–8.1 eV).15,59,63,64
The close match between the shape of the occluded species and the pore size of zeolites and the electron trapping ability of the zeolite framework prevents rapid back electron transfer reactions. It is well known that heteroatoms such as aluminium in the framework are a prerequisite for the creation of persistent charge separated states in the porous void of zeolites. Although no evidence was found regarding ejected electrons, it is clear that the bulk chemical content and the local defects of zeolite control the spatial separation between radical cations and electrons.
The Al content played a large role in the kinetics of spontaneous ionization by accelerating the reaction for higher Al content. When equilibrium is reached, no significant difference was observed between a high ionization rate within H6.6ZSM-5 and H3.4ZSM-5 but the ionization remained relatively weak for H0.17ZSM-5 and very weak for silicalite-1.

        No protonation was noticed within acid HnZSM-5 zeolites whatever the Al and proton content. Moreover, due to the low oxidation potentials of PTZ˙+ (PTZ˙+/PTZ, E0 = 0.27 V vs.SCE) and PTZ2+ (PTZ2+/PTZ, E0 = 0.77 V vs.SCE) with respect to the electron donor ability of HnZSM-5 zeolite framework, electron–hole pair formation was not observed through the capture of another electron from the zeolite framework. In contrast, hole transfer was previously reported to occur within HZSM-5 for biphenyl radical cation (E0 = 1.96 V), stilbene radical cation (E0 = 1.75 V) and naphthalene radical cation (E0 = 1.54 V) in HnZSM-5.24,56,65
Such electron and positive hole transfers have been studied in zeolites for various probe molecules.66–70
The fates of the radical cation and dication subsequent formation are in agreement with some results published previously, and hence the assignment of the dication seems the best. It is reported that PTZ˙+ can be oxidized to PTZ2+ in the proper conditions. For instance, in 96% sulfuric acid, it was shown that PTZ˙+ was formed spontaneously and then underwent further oxidation.39 More recently, the study of the mechanisms of the photoinduced electron transfer process in PTZ/glycol/semiconductor were carried out using TiO2 colloids.43 It was found that PTZ˙+ was generated by the photoionization of PTZ as well as PTZ2+ produced by electron transfer from PTZ˙+ to the conduction band of the semi-conductor. Moreover, PTZ behaviour within HnZSM-5 is analogous with previous conclusions about N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) behaviour in acidic HZSM-5 zeolite. The adsorption in the porous void induced thermal ionization and generated the radical cation TMB˙+ in high yield and TMB2+ as minor species. The protonated H2TMB was not detected even as transient species. All the spectroscopic features recorded after TMB sorption were analogous to those exhibited in charge transfer bromide salts.71
Conclusion
PTZ with a relatively low ionisation potential (6.73 eV) and low vapor pressure was slowly but successfully incorporated in the straight channels of non-acidic silicalite-1 zeolite under dry and inert atmosphere and in the absence of solvent. For the most part, PTZ was occluded as intact molecule. Only a very low amount was spontaneously ionized. In contrast, the mere exposure of PTZ powder to Brønsted acidic HnZSM-5 crystallites under dry and inert atmosphere induced a sequence of reactions to reach a stable system. When PTZ vapor adsorbs onto the external surface of crystallites, PTZ˙+@HnZSM-5˙− radical pair is generated by the polarization energy. Subsequent PTZ2+ formation was fast but only partial. Finally, equilibrium including PTZ˙+, PTZ2+ and occluded PTZ was reached without any evidence of protonation. The close match of PTZ in the pores combined with the efficient polarizing effect of proton and aluminium electron trapping sites appear to be the most important factors responsible for the stabilization of PTZ˙+ and PTZ2+ and hinder efficiently the charge recombination. The EPR, UV-visible and Raman spectra recorded during the slow sorption of PTZ in HnZSM-5 zeolite activated at 723 K provide specific evidence of PTZ radical cations and PTZ2+ dication as durable species generated in the void space of acidic HnZSM-5 zeolites after complete adsorption. No direct evidence of trapped electrons within the zeolite framework resulting from the ionization was provided by the EPR and electronic absorption spectra.
