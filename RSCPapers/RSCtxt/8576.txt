    , Accepted 10th February 2014First published on 10th February 2014AbstractA facile microwave assisted aqueous method has been developed to rapidly prepare stable CdSexTe1−x–CdS quantum dots. Based on this material, core–shell type II CdSexTe1−x–CdS quantum dot sensitized solar cells have been assembled and a power conversion efficiency as high as 5.04% has been obtained.
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as light harvesters in low cost nanostructured solar cells have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their various advantages, such as tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, hot electrons extraction as well as multiple exciton generation, which offer the possibility of boosting the solar cell conversion efficiency beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit.1 Up to now, narrow bandgap semiconductor QDs, such as CdS, CdSe, CdTe, PbS, and CuInS2, were widely incorporated in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QSCs), and considerable efforts have been made to optimize materials and device design for expanding the effective light absorption range and facilitating charge separation.2 Searching for suitable panchromatic QD sensitizers for expanding the harvest of solar light, enhancing charge separation, and retarding charge recombination is always an effective way to improve the power conversion efficiency of QSCs.
One possible way to simultaneously achieve a wide absorption range, a fast electron injection, and a low charge-recombination rate is to adopt type-II core–shell-structured QD sensitizers.3 CdTe with a bulk bandgap of 1.5 eV and high absorption coefficient is currently one of the key photovoltaic materials in thin film solar cells. However, CdTe based QSCs show poor performance with power conversion efficiency less than 2.2%, and suffer from poor stability due to photocorrosion in the commonly used polysulfide electrolyte.4 It is well known that wide bandgap CdS can be utilized to form core–shell structure to enhance stability by surface passivation.5 Recently, Kuang's group developed a one-pot linker assisted hydrothermal method to synthesize core–shell CdTe–CdS sensitized TiO2 electrodes with a power conversion efficiency of 3.80%.6 More recently, our group has demonstrated that a facile two step ex situ/in situ approach can be employed to realize highly efficient core–shell type II CuInS2–CdS QSCs by easily controlling the thickness of the CdS shell.3c However, for constructing core–shell type II CdTe–CdS quantum dots using this method, the large lattice mismatch between CdTe and CdS should be overcome to obtain a high quality heterostructured interface.7 Inspired by lattice-mismatch strain tuning theory, the formation of alloyed CdSexTe1−x QDs can be used to tune the interface's strain of core–shell CdTe–CdS. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a suitable method for constructing CdSexTe1−x–CdS heterostructures. Generally, a time-consuming refluxing or hydrothermal method is used to obtain water-soluble CdSexTe1−x QDs using NaHTe and NaHSe.8 This is limited by easily oxidized NaHTe and NaHSe with a time-consuming preparation process under harsh conditions. Compared to the conventional aqueous method, microwave synthesis is an attractive method for synthesizing QDs due to the advantages of the reaction selectivity and time-saving.9 To the best of our knowledge, few attempts concerning microwave assisted aqueous synthesis of CdSexTe1−x–CdS QDs under ambient conditions have been reported for application in QSCs.
In this work, a rapid two-step microwave assisted aqueous method was developed to obtain 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped CdSexTe1−x QDs with a thin CdS shell (CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I). First, small alloyed CdSexTe1−x QDs were synthesized with air-stable Na2TeO3 and Na2SeSO3 as Te and Se sources, and then a thin layer CdS grew over the CdSexTe1−x core to protect it from oxidation (experimental details are described in the ESI.†). For fabrication of core–shell type II CdSexTe1−x–CdS QSCs, the presynthesized CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs were firstly self-assembled onto the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes, and then an additional CdS layer was deposited onto TiO2–CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I by in situ successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) (denoted as TiO2–CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II). Comparing with CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs, the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QD sensitized TiO2 electrode shows significantly broad and enhanced light absorption. Under standard simulated AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination, the QSCs exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.04%, which is one of the best results for CdTe based QSCs.
The absorption spectra and corresponding photograph of the CdSexTe1−x and CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs synthesized using a microwave assisted aqueous method are depicted in Fig. 1(a). It is seen that the color of the QDs changed from yellow to red by introducing a thin CdS-I onto the CdSexTe1−x QDs. Such red-shift in the absorption spectra is an indication of the formation of the expected CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I core–shell structure.8,9 The crystal structures of QDs were identified by X-ray diffraction. As can be seen in Fig. 1(b), all the broad diffraction peaks are located between the standard zinc blend CdTe and CdSe, implying that alloyed CdSexTe1−x QDs are formed. EDX further confirms the incorporation of Se, in which the actual atomic ratio of Te to Se was calculated to be 1.03:0.18 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Compared to original alloyed CdSexTe1−x QDs, the patterns shift slightly toward higher angles after the second stage microwave radiation, suggesting that CdS-I is formed on the surface of CdSexTe1−x QDs. Further evidence on the surface structure of CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs can be obtained from XPS analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the binding energies of the S(2p) peak at 161.8 and 163.0 eV, corresponding to the typical characteristic peaks of S2− and RS−, respectively, indicate the existence of CdS-I.8,9 In addition, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was also carried out for determining the size and internal structure (Fig. 1(d)). The HR-TEM image shows that the as-prepared CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs have a particle size of 3.2 nm diameter. It is worthy of note that well-resolved lattice planes stretched straight across the entire QDs with no evidence of an interface, which is consistent with a coherent epitaxial growth mechanism.8,9

The photograph and UV-vis absorption spectra of CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I, CdS-II and CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QD sensitized TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 2. Different QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes exhibit distinguishable colors. From the spectra, it is seen that the onset of absorption spectra of CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I is 640 nm. With subsequent SILAR growth of CdS-II coating on the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs, the light absorption intensities are greatly enhanced in the visible light region and the onset edges undergo a significant red shift from 640 to 780 nm, which is much longer than those of single CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I or CdS-II QDs. This indicates that the effective bandgap of core–shell CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II becomes narrow and more light at long wavelengths can be harvested.

We compared the photovoltaic performance of the QSCs fabricated using different QDs as sensitizers. A bilayer TiO2 film with a total thickness of 17 μm (11 μm transparent layer and 6 μm scattering layer) was applied as a photoanode (detailed information of TiO2 film in ESI†). The QD sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were treated with two cycles of ZnS coating by alternately dipping into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solutions for 1 min to reduce the charge recombination of electrons on the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Sandwich type solar cells were assembled with Cu2S counter electrodes and an aqueous polysulfide redox electrolyte containing Na2S (2 M), S (2 M) and KCl (0.2 M). Fig. 3(a) shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves of QSCs fabricated using CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I, CdS-II and CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QDs. The photovoltaic parameters for these devices are summarized in Table 1. Because CdSexTe1−x QDs proved to suffer from the problem of chemical stability and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding cell device is quite poor, CdSexTe1−x QD-based cells were not selected for use as the reference.

A CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs based solar cell has been fabricated, and a power conversion efficiency of 2.72% is achieved. For reference, CdS-II sensitized solar cells have also been fabricated, and the efficiency of the CdS sensitized cells is 2.14%. In comparison, the core–shell CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QSCs show a better behavior in terms of increasing short circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The VOC of the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II cell (0.578 V) is slightly greater than those of CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I (0.502 V) and CdS-II (0.515 V), whereas the JSC of the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II cell (14.79 mA cm−2) is significantly greater than those of CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I (10.23 mA cm−2) and CdS-II (7.57 mA cm−2). The higher JSC value of the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II cells in comparison with CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I and CdS-II based cells is mainly ascribed to the extension of the light-absorption range, as shown in the absorption spectra of Fig. 2. The increased VOC of the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II based cells can be ascribed to the higher JSC. As can be seen from Table 1, the optimized power conversion efficiency of 5.04% for the CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II cells was obtained and showed good reproducibility (Table S2, ESI†), indicating that the synergistic effect between CdS-II and CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I plays an important role in increasing the performance of CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QSCs. Photon to current conversion efficiency spectra (IPCE) are measured to investigate the origin of the enhanced JSC in the assembled devices. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the IPCE characteristics of the cells featuring different QDs match well with their absorption spectra. The overall photocurrent response spectra of devices employing CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I and CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QDs have similar shapes except a stronger response between 350 and 650 nm with a value of 60% and a broader absorption is achieved for core–shell CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QSCs. Moreover, to confirm the increased stability of core–shell QDs with CdS-II, the stability of both CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I and CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II based QSCs was examined. It is seen that no obvious decrease of the photocurrent is observed for CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QDs during continuous 30 min irradiation, while for CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs an obvious photocurrent reduction is observed, indicating that CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II based QSCs are primarily stable under the testing conditions (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The above experiments clearly indicate that the core–shell CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QSCs have superior properties in light harvesting and carrier extraction, which is consistent with the well established type II core–shell model.3,10 Given the quantized nature of CdSexTe1−x and CdS QDs, it is difficult to estimate the exact band positions of the two semiconductor nanoparticles in the present experiments. Comparing with the bulk CdSexTe1−x, the conduction band of CdSexTe1−x QDs will be up-shifted, which is higher than the conduction band of the CdS shell. This will favor the formation of the type II CdSexTe1−x–CdS heterojunction, in which the electronic alignment throughout the core–shell structure causes spatial separation of the electrons and holes between the two regimes. The combination of CdSexTe1−x and CdS semiconductor materials allowed for the redistribution of electrons in the CdS shell (Fig. S5, ESI†). Indeed, the observed enhancements in the light absorption and photocurrent support electron transfer from CdS-II to TiO2. Our work also shows that the CdSexTe1−x core-localized holes can be efficiently extracted into the polysulfide electrolyte in CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QSCs.3,10 Moreover, because the coverage of presynthesized CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs on the TiO2 surface by a self-assembly method is usually incomplete, surface states and dangling bonds are significantly removed through the growth of CdS-II shell material, which also retard interfacial recombination losses of electrons. Nonetheless, unambiguous understanding of electron injection and charge recombination kinetics in this type II system requires further systematic studies.
In conclusion, a simple microwave assisted aqueous method is developed to quickly fabricate CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I QDs for QSCs. The QSCs based on type II core–shell CdSexTe1−x–CdS-I–CdS-II QDs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 5.04% under AM1.5 illumination with enhanced photostability. Our work suggests that type II bandgap engineering in the CdSexTe1−x–CdS system provides an effective way to expand the light absorption range and control its interfacial charge transfer properties.
