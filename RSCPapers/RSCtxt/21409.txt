In order to achieve this goal, the efficiency of the cells and even more their stability have to be optimized. Resorting to additives is a simple but effective technique to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells and enhance their stability. Several doping strategies have been tried during the years, involving either the charge transporting layers, the electrodes, or the perovskite layer. Doping has mostly been investigated within the field of hole transporting materials (HTMs), while less research has been focused on electron transporting layers (ETLs). Herein we summarize for the first time the most notable advances in the n-type doping of organic ETLs in PSCs, highlighting bathocuproines, halogen-ammonium salts, electron-donor molecules, N-DMBI and their derivatives, polymer-based dopants, carbon nanoforms, and other structures that cannot be classified in the previously categories.Andrea Cabrera-EspinozaAndrea Cabrera-Espinoza obtained BSc in Chemistry (2015) and MSc in Chemistry (2018) from Universidad del Valle, Colombia. In the last year of her BSc degree, she worked with fullerene derivatives for supramolecular applications under the supervision of Prof. Manuel N. Chaur. During the MSc studies, she performed her thesis in the laboratory of Prof. Alejandro Ortiz where she carried out a research project based on electronic properties of fullerene-BODIPY derivatives. Currently, she is a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Juan Luis Delgado and her research is focused in organic materials for perovskite-based solar cells.Silvia CollaviniSilvia Collavini obtained her PhD in June 2019 with the thesis “Pristine and Novel Fullerene Derivatives as Charge Transporting Materials or Additives in Perovskite Solar Cells” from the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU and POLYMAT, supervised by Prof. J. L. Delgado and Dr R. Tena-Zaera. During her PhD, she spent several months at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) in the group of Prof. M. Grätzel. Previously, she carried out her master thesis project at the University of Trieste (Italy), under the supervision of Dr T. Da Ros, as a part of the Carbon Nanotechnology Group of Prof. M. Prato. She is currently working as a Postdoc in the group of Prof. J. L. Delgado.Juan Luis DelgadoJuan Luis Delgado obtained his PhD in Chemistry at UCLM (Spain) in 2004 supervised by Prof. F. Langa and Prof. P. de la Cruz. His research continues with two postdoctoral stages, first in the group of Prof. J.-F. Nierengarten at the ECPM-CNRS (Strasbourg, France), and then in the group of Prof. N. Martín at UCM (Madrid, Spain, “Juan de la Cierva” research contract). From 2008 to 2014 he was a Senior “Ramón & Cajal” Researcher at IMDEA-Nanoscience (Madrid, Spain). Since 2014, he has been working in POLYMAT (Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain) with an Ikerbasque Research Associate contract, leading the Hybrid Materials for Photovoltaics group.
Introduction
In the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) underwent an astonishingly fast development, with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) improving from 3.8% to the latest registered value of 25.2%.1,2 To obtain this impressive leap, all the components of the perovskite solar cells have been extensively studied in order to be optimized. A great variety of charge transporting materials, both organic and inorganic, have been investigated and incorporated into perovskite solar cells during the last years.3–6 In the search for novel charge transporting materials, a huge effort has been dedicated to the synthesis and study of advanced hole transporting materials (HTMs).7 In contrast, the number of electron transporting materials (ETMs) investigated so far is scarce, despite their high importance to achieve stable and efficient devices. Up to now, the vast majority of studies concerning organic ETMs consider fullerenes and their derivatives, while other organic molecules, such as naphthalene diimides (NDIs), are investigated to a lesser extent.4,8–10 The most famous fullerene derivative used in solar cells is phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).11
One general strategy to improve the performances of charge transporting materials is the use of a suitable dopant. The basic principles of doping in organic semiconductors have been well studied and have allowed increasing the number of scientific contributions with ETLs whose intrinsic electronic properties have been dramatically enhanced.12 Doping is a simple technique with the purpose of tuning the energy levels of the layers, improving the carrier transport properties, enhancing the film conductivity, controlling the film morphology, and increasing the film stability. Utilization of doped charge transporting layers is considered an efficient route to improve efficiency and stability in PSCs.
Due to the higher number of studies regarding HTMs, their doping conditions have also been more widely investigated and, in the case of the reference HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene), they have already been optimized.7,13,14 The most commonly used additives for Spiro-OMeTAD are tert-butylpyridine (tBP), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide lithium salt (LiTFSI), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tri[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (FK209). Even if beneficial for the conductivity of the material, the use of these doping agents presents indeed several drawbacks that affect the photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells. First of all, these dopants are hygroscopic and they might migrate into the perovskite layer during operation, leading to important losses in performance and threaten the stability.15,16 Furthermore, LiTFSI and FK209 are added to the HTM solution dissolved in acetonitrile, which is known to dissolve perovskite, thus it could partially degrade the light-harvesting layer during fabrication. It is thus important to find the right balance between solubility, conductivity, and other properties of the additive in order to obtain the best performing perovskite solar cell.
Being less studied than their hole-transporting counterparts, ETMs have also been less investigated in terms of doping. Most of the reviews on this topic that have been published until now deal with n-doping of inorganic ETMs, such as the most known and commonly used TiO2.12,17,18 In the PSCs field, the study of doping of organic ETMs still remains in the background of techniques for improving the device performance and its stability.
Herein we present the most notable examples of n-doping strategies of organic charge transporting materials in perovskite solar cells that can be found in literature, hoping to help the reader visualize the effects generated by each type of dopant with respect to the efficiency and the stability of PSCs. Therefore, the dopants are divided into sections according to their structure. An explanation about the intrinsic mechanism of doping is introduced in each section in order to ease the understanding of how the doping mechanisms are linked to the structure and the function of the additive. The performances and architectures of the doped devices along with the stability results are summarized in Table 1. Other properties, such as conductivity, mobility, shifts of Fermi energy (ΔEF) of ETMs with respect to the optimized doping concentration are listed in Table 2.

Bathocuproine
One of the most famous molecules used to better the performances of fullerenes as ETMs in perovskite solar cells is bathocuproine (BCP, Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Structures of BCP and its analogue BPhen. 

BCP is mostly known for improving the performances of the aforementioned PC61BM. This has the tendency to create a charge-transporting network thanks to the phenyl moiety, which is inclined to undergo π–π stacking with other PC61BM molecules.19 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PC61BM, which are −5.9 eV and −3.9 eV respectively, make it suitable for extracting electrons and blocking holes coming from methylammonium lead iodide perovskite, whose valence and conduction bands are, respectively, −5.4 eV and −3.9 eV. However, PC61BM is not flawless. Thickness of PC61BM layer is critical: the films made using this molecule are often too thin to completely cover the perovskite, due to the small molecule nature of PC61BM and the low viscosity of the PC61BM solution, which could lead to the generation of small cracks in the films.20,21 These cracks can act as a shunting pass, leading to losses in performance. On the other hand, an excessive thickness confers too high resistivity to the solar cell. Hence, in order to reach the perfect equilibrium between the film morphology and the electron transporting ability, PC61BM layer should be thin enough to ensure an efficient electron transport, together with suppressed charge recombination and low series resistance. Therefore, the morphology and the electrical properties of PC61BM-based electron transporting layer (ETL) need to be tuned in order to obtain high-performance perovskite solar cells.
To act as effective dopants, the additives should of course not undermine the action of the ETL. In the case of BCP, its deep HOMO determines its good hole blocking behaviour, which makes this molecule able to act in synergy with PC61BM. This molecule shows also ability to block metal cathode atoms to migrate into the underlying layers.22

BCP was first used by Guo, Chen, and co-workers as a buffer layer between different fullerenes (C60, PC61BM, ICBA) and the metal cathode.23 Also thanks to its hole blocking ability, in each case it helped improving the performances of the cells.
After this first work, several studies resorted to this molecule as an interface buffer layer or additive in order to improve the performances of inverted fullerene-containing perovskite solar cells.24–28
For example, a composite ETL of BCP-doped PC61BM was constructed by Yin and co-workers.24 The introduction of BCP reduced charge transfer resistance at the interfaces ETL/electrode and perovskite/ETL, facilitated the charge separation at the perovskite/PC61BM interface and suppressed the charge recombination, resulting in an improvement of efficiency of nearly double. In addition to interfacial modification effect, BCP increase the hydrophobicity of the ETL surface, improving the stability in ambient condition.
In a later report, Wang, Liao, and co-workers processed BCP through solution methods (sBCP) in order to achieve large fill factor (FF) bromine–iodine perovskite solar cells.29 The solution-processed BCP demonstrated an excellent smoothing effect on the interface, with huge reduction of the surface roughness (Fig. 2). The improvement of the morphology helped by π–π interactions seemed to be at the root of the astonishing 85% FF. Moreover, the dark current measurements pointed towards a reduction of the leakage current in the BCP-containing devices, which is usually linked to the quality of the interfaces. Furthermore, solution-processed sBCP showed better charge extraction than evaporated one (eBCP), thus leading to higher improvement of the cell performances.

A similar molecule, bathophenanthroline (BPhen, Fig. 1), led to an analogue improvement of FF by filling the voids between perovskite and PC61BM. This resulted in an increased amount of generated fullerene clusters, meaning more pathways for the electrons, and this translated into improved electron injection and conductivity.30,31
Halogen-ammonium salts
The introduction of halogen-ammonium salts in the organic ETL has demonstrated multiple times to be beneficial for the performance of perovskite solar cells.32–35 The chemical structures of halogen-ammonium salts discussed in this section are illustrated in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Structures of the halogen-ammonium salts used as dopants. Even if it is not an halogen-ammonium salt, trichloro(3,3,3 trifluoropropyl)silane is reported in this section as well since it is used in combination with MAI. 
Zwitterionic molecules are often chosen because of their ability to reduce the cathode work function.
The creation of negative dipoles at the interface between the zwitterionic layer and the metal and their electrostatic self-alignment seems to be at the root of this effect.36
As previously stated, fullerenes are great electron acceptors with the ability of activating relatively inert halide anions. The formation of an anion–π interaction initiates the doping process, which facilitates the charge transport and contributes to the suppression of hysteresis. The migration of the halide anions through the ETL results in degradation, hence the importance of the anion–π interaction.37
As an immediate consequence, the halogen anions contribute to transfer electrons to the ETL, increasing its conductivity and therefore the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the cell. Furthermore, the presence of a tertiary amine in most of the doping agents induces self-doping of the layer, thanks to the lone pair electron transfer to the fullerene cage.38
Furthermore, the corrosive iodide ions in the perovskite layer have small migration activation energy. This means they can easily migrate towards and into the metal electrode (Ag or Al) through the PC61BM layer and then contaminate the inner surface of the electrodes by forming an insulating metal halide compound.39 Amine functional groups can capture and stabilize the halide ions and act therefore as corrosion inhibitors. Together with the amine–iodide bonds, Ag–amine bonds are forming at the metal interface, contributing to the reduction of the series resistance.
Starting from these premises, other functional moieties have been introduced in the molecule for the dopant to acquire new properties. Chang and co-workers, for example, resorted to N,N-dimethyl-N-octadecyl(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilyl chloride silane (DMOAP, Fig. 3), which has been introduced into the PC61BM solution to form a blend in the ETL.40 In this dopant, alkoxysilane groups crosslinked to siloxane, giving as a result more uniform film coverage. This film morphology guaranteed an efficient charge transfer and reduced the shunt leakage by preventing undesirable reactions with the Ag electrode. On the other side, an excess of DMOAP resulted in a more rough film maybe due to the presence of aggregates, and the insulating effect of the siloxane groups was obviously stronger at higher concentrations. The increase in charge transfer efficiency was demonstrated through photoluminescence (PL, Fig. 4) measurements, in which it was clear that the quenching of the PL given by the doped PC61BM layer was higher than that given by the undoped. The good film coverage might explain this improvement in charge transfer. Moreover, the work function of the Ag layer was reduced from 4.64 eV to 3.87 eV, therefore it better matched the LUMO of PC61BM (4.1 eV). Normally, the energy mismatch between the two layers makes the charge transport quite hard, due to the Schottky barrier effect. This change in the work function is supposed to be due to favourable interfacial dipoles created by the ammonium cations.

The same group resorted to a simpler molecule, cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB, Fig. 3).41 The improvement of the electron transfer given by the presence of bromide anions was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Fig. 5), which showed a strong signal just in the case of the doped PC61BM, corresponding to the forming fullerene radical anion. The improvement of the uniformity of the layer obtained through the use of this dopant could be explained with the creation of coulombic interactions between these radical anions and the CTAB cation.

The processing solution was therefore more viscous and guaranteed a better coverage. Also in this case, an excess of the dopant led to aggregation and hence to a rougher layer and worse performances. This improved coverage at the optimized doping concentration is responsible for providing ambient stability under continuous light illumination, more than 60% of the initial PCE was preserved over 5 days.
Chang and co-workers explored also the effects of hexamethonium bromide (HMB, showed in Fig. 3).42HMB is a commercially available molecule with good solution processability. HMB-doped PC61BM-containing inverted perovskite solar cells showed good electrical conductivity, and this dopant conferred a fine anion-induced tuning of the Ag work function, leading to efficient electron extraction and therefore to good open-circuit voltage (VOC). Remarkably, in contrast to what normally expected from a PC61BM layer, good efficiencies (15.58%) were obtained with high thicknesses (up to 120 nm) as well. The coulombic interactions between the fullerene radical anions and the ammonium cations seemed to be at the root of this effect, giving an extremely good morphology. In addition, doping with this molecule allowed scaling-up through doctor-blade, giving good efficiencies and stability with larger areas as well. The results were overall reproducible. Moreover, this molecule showed versatility, that means its benefits could be and were successfully applied to other fullerenes as well, like PC71BM.
The same molecule was used by Meng, Yang, and co-workers to dope a pristine C60 layer used as ETL in carbon-based perovskite solar cell, in order to obtain faster charge transport, to enhance the electron mobility, and to decrease the electron trap density.43 It is worth noticing that C60 usually forms better films than PC61BM, thanks to its higher wettability in DMF, with a contact angle of 11.8°, sensibly lower than that of PC61BM (43.9°). Still, the addition of HMB contributed to improve the C60 surface morphology, which became smoother and led to a better interface. As a result, the stability improved as well. This might be due to the low transmittance of C60 in the UV region.44 For this feature, the layer can act as an UV filter and therefore protect the perovskite from these light wavelengths. Similarly to what seen in the PC61BM study, the insertion of this molecule promoted the scaling up of the cells.
Yang and co-workers compared the doping activity of three quaternary ammonium-containing molecules with different counterions (TBAB, TBABF4, and TBAPF6, Fig. 3).45 Each one was blended with PC61BM and in each and every case the electron mobility of the layer improved. The improvement of JSC is a direct consequence, and was observed to be more pronounced with the use of the fluorine-containing salts. Furthermore, improvement of the shunt resistance and decreasing of the series resistance led to higher FF. In contrast to what reported in the previous examples, the introduction of these dopants increased the roughness of the ETL, maybe due to the larger counterions, even though this did not seem to affect the device performances. Moreover, the introduction of these molecules shifted upwards the ETL energy levels, which remained nonetheless deep enough to guarantee the hole blocking from perovskite.
Methylammonium iodide (MAI, depicted in Fig. 3), one of the most known ammonium salts in the perovskite field, was interestingly used by Huang and co-workers as dopant for the C60-self assembled monolayer (C60-SAM) ETL as well, in synergy with trichloro(3,3,3 trifluoropropyl)silane (Fig. 3).46 The latter, vapour deposited onto the C60-SAM, was used as a crosslinking agent to improve the morphology, forming the so called crosslinked C60-SAM (CLCS). The crosslinking was confirmed through infrared spectroscopy (IR) measurements, which reported a shift of the carbonyl signal of the fullerene substituent.
The crosslinked film appeared smoother and more uniform, because of the order induced by the alignment of the silane dopant. A more compact packing of the molecules favoured the electron transport within the layers. After the crosslinking, just one recombination channel was registered through impedance spectroscopy, maybe the one due to the trap-assisted recombination at the grain boundaries. This indicated that one of the two channels registered for the non-crosslinked was suppressed, most likely the one representing the large density of traps in this film. Furthermore, the presence of the fluorine atoms conferred more hydrophobicity and thus water resistance to the perovskite solar cell. As a simple but clear proof, water was drop-casted on the films, either crosslinked or not (Fig. 6). The lack of colour change indicated an improvement of the water resistance of the crystalline structure. The enhanced moisture stability also was demonstrated by stability tests in function of storage time and illumination time under ambient conditions.

As a drawback, the crosslinking increased the contact resistance, affecting the charge transfer. To bypass this issue, MAI was blended into the C60-SAM before the deposition of the silane crosslinking molecules.
Electron-donor molecules
In light with what observed with the use of halogen ions, namely the direct transfer of electrons to the ETL in order to improve the latter's conductivity, organic Lewis bases were tried as dopants to achieve similar results.47
Zhou and co-workers implemented 2,6-dimethoxypyridine (2,6-Py, showed in Fig. 7), a weak Lewis base, into their perovskite devices.48 Pyridines showed ability to form dative covalent bonds with lead defects, thus passivating the surfaces. 2,6-Py was specifically chosen for its less corrosive behaviour with respect to pure pyridine and 4-tert-butylpyridine. This dopant demonstrated ability to dope PC61BM via electron transfer, thus improving conductivity of the fullerenic material. As a consequence of the doping, the electron mobility notably improved, favouring the charge transfer. Furthermore, the charge recombination loss was reduced and the layer quality enhanced. All these benefits resulted in an improved ambient stability under continuous illumination.
 Fig. 7  Structures of the donor molecules used as dopants. 
Nimoth, Bolink, and co-workers compared the effect of a novel dopant in two different cell architectures, both with pristine C60 as ETM.49 The pristine fullerene was selected due to its easy processability by sublimation, which was the chosen device fabrication technique. In order to minimize the transport resistance, the charge transport layers were both co-evaporated with a suitable dopant. For C60, the chosen additive was the electron-donating molecule N1,N4-bis(tri-p-tolylphosphoranylidene)-benzene-1,4-diamine (PhIm, whose structure is showed in Fig. 7), which through reduction of the pristine fullerene layer helped the charge transport.26 In both configurations, the introduction of PhIm proved to be beneficial, despite for example the rather small perovskite crystals reported in the regular configuration. Nonetheless, an undoped charge transporting layer in between perovskite and the doped blend was seen to be necessary in order to prevent charge recombination. Both configurations have similar stability after 7 days of light exposition.
Similarly, Zhou and co-workers resorted to a molecule with strong electron-donating properties in order to improve the performances of their perovskite solar cells (1,5-diazabiciclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene, DBU, showed in Fig. 7).50 The introduction of DBU in blend with PC61BM led to the formation of fullerene radical anions, as could be demonstrated through UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy: PC61BM showed no signals in the near infrared, but consequently to the introduction of DBU a peak at 1015 nm, corresponding to the radical anion, appeared. Furthermore, they found that a small amount of DBU of 0.1% showed increased electrical conductivity and enhanced electron mobility. Zhou and co-workers also demonstrated that DBU-doped PC61BM have an upward shifted Fermi energy comparing with undoped-PC61BM, which facilitate the electron extraction from the ETL to the cathode. Experimental evidence of the consequences of this shifted Fermi level after the DBU doping was provided by the J–V curves (Fig. 8). The control device exhibited an S-shape tendency in the J–V curves, originated by poor charge collection at the interface between the ETL and the electrode. The introduction of DBU eliminated this feature through the improvement of electron injection. In the same article, it is reported also that the positive effects of DBU are not restricted to PC61BM.

DMBI and derivatives
1,3-Dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (N-DMBI, displayed in Fig. 9) has often been reported as an efficient and air-stable n-type dopant for fullerene derivatives through the hydride radical transfer pathway.51,52 This means its doping mechanism requires the formation of a radical in the position 2 of the imidazole. This radical is stabilized by the presence of the two nitrogen atoms and the phenyl ring, therefore the process is made irreversible.53 This mechanism was confirmed by Bao and co-workers, which observed that the conductivity of doped PC61BM film improved by more than 4 orders of magnitude in organic field-effect transistors. The group did not observe the same effect resorting to 1,2,3-trimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (TMBI), the methylated analogue of DMBI.54 The introduction of an electron donating group in the phenyl ring increased the energy of the single occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), located in the ortho and para positions of the ring. Wang, Duan, and co-workers resorted to the three derivatives H1, H2, and H3 (Fig. 9), bearing respectively 1, 2, and 3 methoxy groups on the phenyl ring.17 In this study it is highlighted how the recombination was reduced through the use of these dopants blended with PC61BM, as shown by the high external quantum efficiency (eQE) values in the long wavelength region. This might be linked to the improved morphology of the layers, favoured by the interaction between PC61BM and the dopant.
 Fig. 9  Structure of the DMBI derivatives used as dopants. 
Using these three n-type dopant, a remarkably low doping ratio of 0.05 wt% increased the electron mobility and conductivity with all three n-type dopants. On the contrary, an excess of dopant led to aggregates, made of a less soluble electron transfer product, with a poor morphology as a result, hence a bad interfacial contact. In general, low amounts of these dopants are desirable: apart of the formation of aggregates, they tend to shift downwards the LUMO of the ETL, thus resulting in loss in VOC. A negligible amount is then required in order to minimize this loss; therefore a highly efficient dopant is desirable. In the presented results by Duan and co-workers, it can be noted that the best performances and long-term stability is obtained by H3 as dopant.
PC61BM was not the only fullerene which registered some benefits through the use of N-DMBI. Zhang, Song, and co-workers resorted to the same additive to blend with an oligoethylene glycol fullerene derivative, PTEG-1.55 The main effect of the use of this dopant was an improved alignment between perovskite and ETM, which led to more efficient electron transport and collection, and thus an enhanced JSC. The registered dielectric constant decreased, thus favouring the charge transport. The surface wettability of the ETL in H2O and DMF/DMSO decreased with the concentration of the dopant, which improved the surface tension and favours the formation of larger ETL crystals, which are fundamental for a better crystallization of perovskite (Fig. 10). Also in this case, an overdoping (5%) was detrimental for the cell: vacancies formed within the layer, maybe due to the aggregation, and led to worse performances. Moreover, the presence of the dopant helped decreasing the work function of the ETL, which is desirable in regular solar cells in order to get a better alignment of the energy levels of electrode and ETL: in fact, a reduced work function of the ETL corresponds to an increased driving force of the electron transport. Finally, the presence of the dopant resulted in a reduction of the trap-assisted recombination. Together, all these improvements resulted in a higher long-term thermal stability with respect to undoped ETL, even for unencapsulated devices.

Reprinted from ref. 55 with permission of Elsevier. 
Another fullerene that benefits from the use of DMBI derivatives is the same pristine C60.56 Snaith and co-workers inserted 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (N-DPBI, whose structure is reported in Fig. 9) into the fullerene layer. The amine group of this molecule presented less donating strength with respect to its simpler relative N-DMBI, due to the stabilization of the radical operated by the phenyl moieties. Upon deposition of the perovskite, the C60 layer became inhomogeneous, similarly to what observed in previous studies.57 On the contrary, these defects disappeared upon doping. 1 wt% was observed to be the optimal concentration of the dopant, since higher amounts led to worse crystallinity. This might be due to the excessive hydrophilicity of the overdoped ETL, while the bare C60 layer was, on the contrary, too hydrophobic to guarantee a satisfactory crystallization of the perovskite layer (Fig. 11). In contrast to the previous studies, N-DMBI was used by Yun, Na, and co-workers as a buffer layer on the top of PC61BM and not blended with it.58 Even so, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurement shows how the dopant could partially penetrate PC61BM: in fact, the CN+ peak typical of DMBI is present in the ETL (Fig. 12). The creation of a buffer layer was made possible by the fact that N-DMBI is soluble in polar solvents, like alcohols, and therefore its deposition did not affect the underlying PC61BM layer. Even if used as a buffer layer, N-DMBI reduced the PC61BM work function and therefore improved the performances of the cell.

As a drawback, the hysteresis of the doped cells increased. This can be explained by the fact that in a normal PC61BM/perovskite interface the two molecules penetrate into the nearby layers and the mobile ions can form halide radical anions. On the other hand, when a buffer layer is inserted in-between the two layers, the formation of these radical anions is more difficult and the ions are free to move around depending on the scan direction.
To demonstrate the universality of the DMBI approach, Cheng, Sun, and co-workers resorted to the aforementioned H2 to dope their non-fullerenic ETM.59 The electron mobility of the molecule increased, as well as the conductivity of the layer. The performances and stability of the cell improved, thanks to an enhancement of all the parameters. In fact, the higher electron selection and transport efficiency improved the JSC, while the VOC bettered thanks to the lower recombination at the interface, due to the improved morphology brought by the interactions between dopant and ETL. Nonetheless, the stability of these cells was not optimal, maybe due to the decreased hydrophobicity of the layer. Together with this, other works have highlighted that the use of DMBI should not be limited to fullerenic materials.60,61 In fact, both perylene and naphthalene diimides see their conductivity increased by the insertion of these dopants.
Polymer-based dopants
The main role of polymeric dopants is linked to the improvement of the morphology of the ETL. The choice of the solvent is fundamental, mostly not to corrode perovskite.
Huang, Yip, and co-workers compared the effects of two different fluorene polymers, PFN and PN4N (Fig. 13).62 The water–methanol-soluble PFN was incompatible with the perovskite films because of the small molecular size of the solvents needed for its processing. As a matter of fact, MeOH could decompose the underlying layer, resulting in considerably lower solar cell performances. The introduction of an aliphatic backbone tuned the solubility of PN4N to the extent that its processability became compatible with perovskite device fabrication. PN4N improved the performances of the device through enhancement of the transport properties of the PC61BM layer thanks to reduction of the series resistance. The better coverage of the layer led to reduced recombination of the charges at the cathode interface.

Also Xia and co-workers chose two different fluorene polymers with well-known film-forming properties in order to facilitate the formation of a good ETL.27 Both poly(9,9-dioctyfluorene) (PFO, whose structure is showed in Fig. 13) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT, whose structure is reported in Fig. 13) showed also good electrical conductivity. Using both polymers, the surface roughness was notably reduced, hence the recombination as well. Anyway, PFO possess better hole-than electron mobility, then it demonstrated to be unfavourable for charge transport. On the other hand, the better electron mobility of F8BT made it a good candidate to act as a dopant for PC61BM. However, even though the good film-forming ability of the polymer gave room to a wide range of amounts to be used, the higher LUMO of F8BT with respect to PC61BM was bad for the collection of electrons. This implied that a good balance between film morphology and charge transport properties had to be found in order to better take advantage of this dopant. A similar structure, poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-2′,2′′-diyl] (F8TBT, showed in Fig. 13) was studied by Liu, Priya, and co-workers.63 The molecule was implemented in the PC61BM layer to form a bulk blend. The film formation benefitted from the insertion of the dopant; the blend displayed good phase separation, of about 15 nm. This favoured the charge transfer, since the carrier transport distance in organic materials is less than 10 nm. The Fermi level of the blend showed to be higher than that of pure PC61BM: the better alignment with perovskite energy levels was beneficial for charge transport. The recombination in the blend was notably reduced, and the increased hydrophobicity seemed to be at the root of the improved ambient stability. Yip, Yan, Yang and co-workers implemented another fluorene-based polymer into an inverted perovskite device.64 The polymer poly[9,9-bis(6′-(N,N-diethylamino)propyl)-fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)-hexyl)fluorene] (PFNOX, showed in Fig. 13) was blended into the PC61BM layer, enabling efficient electron transport through electrical doping. PFNOX facilitated the electron injection from the perovskite into the ETL and decreased the recombination rate of the charge carriers.
In this work, the polymer polystyrene (PS, whose structure is reported in Fig. 13) was used in synergy with PFNOX. PS increased the electron mobility as well as the viscosity of the PC61BM solution, thus improving the quality of the PC61BM films and the efficiency of the device.
Pure PS as a dopant was subject of the study of the same group.65 With the insertion of a small amount of PS (1.5 wt%), the morphology of the ETL improved and the roughness decreased. This led to less photocurrent leakage and increase of VOC. Adding PS also helped reduce recombination, improved the charge collection and elongated the electron lifetime, with an improvement of PCE as a result. Since PS is an insulator, higher amounts were detrimental even if beneficial for the morphology. As a matter of fact, with 6 wt% the electron mobility decreased and the series resistance increased, leading to worse device performances.
On the contrary, the introduction of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, depicted in Fig. 13) as a buffer layer between PC61BM and the Ag cathode had no effect on the morphology of the layers.66 Nonetheless, the devices registered an improvement of efficiency, mostly due to an enhancement of the FF. It was demonstrated that, through coordination of the PVP oxygen and the Ag atoms, the formation of a dipole moment in the layer occurred, in which the negative charge end pointed towards PC61BM and the positive one towards oxygen. This dipole moment contributed to the energy alignment of the layers and promoted the electron transport from PC61BM to Ag by lowering the electron injection barrier between these two layers, thus reducing the interfacial resistance.
Polyethylenemine ethoxylated (PEIE, whose structure is reported in Fig. 13) is probably the most well-known polymer used as additive to improve the performances of PC61BM in perovskite solar cells.14,67PEIE demonstrated high tendency not only to improve the morphology of the ETL, but also to passivate the trap states and to prevent recombination. The polymer also contributed to the reduction of the cathode work function, thus lowering the injection barrier with PC61BM. Similar results were then obtained with PEIE's analogue polyethyleneimine (PEI), where an increasing of mobility upon addition of polymer-based dopant was also found.68,82
Carbon nanoforms
The synergetic effect of n-doped graphene as additive for PC61BM and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as buffer layer was studied by Grätzel, Yang, Han, and co-workers.69 In their devices, electron transport was faster thanks to the improved conductivity and the good ohmic contact between the CQDs and the Ag cathode. Most of all, however, the benefits were brought by the hindering of the I− and Ag+ migration between layers. In particular, the graphene crystal lattice could not be penetrated by the iodide ions, therefore their presence in the Ag layer is insignificant, as showed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, reported in Fig. 14) measurements. The hindered migration of ions meant slower formation of vacancies, thus higher stability. The group successfully scaled their CQDs-containing devices up to 1 cm2.

CQDs and graphene quantum dots (GQDs)-doped PC61BM have been employed by other groups with great results as well both in terms of stability at environmental conditions and device performances.70,71
Graphdiyne (GD, showed in Fig. 15) is a carbon nanostructure which possesses both sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and natural holes.83 Its network presents interesting delocalized π systems that are able to undergo π–π stacking. This property was used to achieve a proper doping of the well-know HTM polyhexyl thiophene (P3HT).84 Curiously, Jiu, Fang, Li, and co-workers resorted to the same structure to dope PC61BM, deposited in blend with GD.72 The morphology of the ETL improved, with better device performances as a consequence. GD, with its peculiar structure, helped passivate the grain boundaries, thus reducing recombination and hysteresis of the device. The GD-doped solar cells presented higher JSC, possibly due to the enhanced electrical conductivity, electron mobility, and charge extraction ability. The same carbon nanostructure was used to dope 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD), acting as ETL in a regular structured PSCs.73 This novel ETL is a crosslinkable fullerene, which demonstrated the ability to create a robust film conferring good solvent resistance to the device.85

Moreover, the addition of GD further improved the film orientation through π–π stacking interactions.
Furthermore, the face-on orientation of the layer was favourable for the growth and crystallization of perovskite films. As a result, the electron mobility and charge extraction improved. The better film orientation had also to be considered at the root of the enhanced stability.
Kakavelakis, Kymakis, and co-workers resorted to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to dope their PC61BM ETL.74 The increase of JSC was at the root of the PCE improvement; this was mainly due to the improved conductivity of the ETL and the more effective extraction of photoexcited electrons from the perovskite to the metal contact. Moreover, the improved stability of the rGO-doped devices was due to the stabilization of the interface between perovskite and ETL.
Self-doping ETLs
The self-doping technique is a promising alternative to the use of dopants but considerable as an n-doping strategy itself. The ETL is chemically engineered to contain moieties able to act as dopants, in order to avoid adding new molecules to the layer.86
This should be, in principle, beneficial for the stability, as stated in the introduction. An interesting self-doping approach was followed by Li and co-workers.75 The group implemented the aforementioned benefits of the ammonium halide salts by substituting the fullerene cage with these moieties (Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG, displayed in Fig. 16). The result of this functionalization was an intramolecular transfer of electrons from the Lewis base substituent to the Lewis acid fullerene cage, with an improvement of the conductivity as a consequence. In both cases the current density increased with respect to the reference cell, however the film formation of Bis-FITG was not good enough to obtain overall performance improvements. Both fullerenes were also employed as buffer layers in synergy with PC61BM, giving PCEs higher than 19%.
 Fig. 16  Structures of the self-doping fullerenes. 
Another strategy was employed by Emrick, Russell, and co-workers.76 A mixture of fulleropyrrolidines of C60 and C70, substituted with tertiary amine chains was used by the group as a buffer layer on the top of PC61BM (Fig. 16). The self-doping occurred by intramolecular electron transfer from the tertiary amines to the fullerene cage, improving conductivity. Furthermore, the amines contributed to segregate iodide anions, thus improving stability.
Other structures
Several different structures that cannot be included in the previous categories have been successfully used as n-dopants.
For example, Hu and co-workers incorporated an optically polarisable molecule, ITIC (Fig. 17), into the PC61BM layer.77 Resorting to this molecule they succeeded in inducing dipoles, which led to the decrease of interfacial charge accumulation, as well as the charge recombination and the ionic migration. Normally, upon photoexcitation, the perovskite layer undergoes strong electrical polarization.87,88 The interaction between the internal electrical polarization of the perovskite and the optically induced dipoles in the ETL could provide a strong electrical field at the interface, positively affecting charge transport and recombination. The dipole alignment was strongly affected by the electrical field. At JSC, when this is at its highest, the alignment-induced dipole effects decreased the charge accumulation at the interface, thus improving FF. Moreover, ITIC could passivate lead Lewis acid traps, acting in synergy with PC61BM (which interacts with iodide sites) for the reduction of ion migration.
 Fig. 17  Structures of the dopants discussed in the present section (Other structures). 
Yang, Yin, and co-workers resorted to the same ITIC in synergy with an electron-rich molecule, poly(n-vinylcarbazole) (PVK).78
The blend of the two molecules with PC61BM resulted in an improved film morphology, which led to a better interface and therefore to a higher VOC. Due to its amorphous nature, ITIC is less prone to crystallize, with the consequence of contacting closely with PC61BM and distributing uniformly into the layer. The synergetic effect of the three components led to an efficient passivation of the defects, hence to a reduction of the hysteresis and to an improvement of the long-term stability of the device.
Wang and co-workers resorted to decamethylcobaltocene (DMC, depicted in Fig. 17) to dope Bis-PC61BM in a regular configuration.79 The introduction of this new material caused a downward movement of the LUMO of the ETM, thus facilitating both electron extraction and transport increasing both electronic mobility and conductivity. The smoother morphology of the layer acted as a better substrate for the crystallization of perovskite, with an interface that appeared more table and with less traps, which raised the stability by over 50% compared to the device with undoped ETL.
The amphiphilic surfactant oleamide (Fig. 17) was instead chosen as a dopant by Yang and co-workers.80 The introduction of this molecule into the PC61BM layer caused a lowering of the injection barrier between the fullerene and the cathode, which resulted in an increased electron transport. Doping with oleamide improved the coverage of the PC61BM layer through intermolecular interactions between the aliphatic chains of the dopant and the PC61BM, whose aggregation is hindered by the same chains. This led to a better interfacial contact, hence to better transport and reduced recombination.
Ely, Quevedo-Lopez, and co-authors introduced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a blend in the PC61BM layer, providing an interesting explanation of what might be happening.81 The group explained how photons were confined by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and depending on this they could interact with the NPs, with effects on the electromagnetic field around the latters. The enhancement of the electromagnetic field led to an improvement of the light-harvesting properties of the perovskite film, which displayed stronger absorption. Furthermore, the series resistance of the device was reduced, favouring charge carrier dissociation at the interface, in correspondence of a strong electric field around the nanoparticles. It was observed that in PC61BM films with a low-content of AgNPs (5 wt%) there was a uniform distribution of the nanoparticles in the PC61BM matrix, with a slightly higher concentration at the interface between the perovskite and the ETM. The improvement of the quality of the interface generated by the content of AgNPs allowed the collection of a larger number of photogenerated carriers, thus increasing JSC of the device.
Conclusions and outlook
The most important advances in n-doping of organic ETLs in perovskite solar cells have been extensively reported for the first time. Different dopants, catalogued according to their structures, have been listed and described, together with their action mechanisms and the effects generated by their presence on the device.
The first structures addressed were BCP and its analogue BPhen. BCP is to the date the most common dopant for PC61BM; it has a pivotal role in the improvement of the morphology of the ETL and provides the whole photovoltaic device with a synergic hole-blocking action.
One extended and effective class of dopants consists of halogen-ammonium salts. These additives have two fundamental effects, which combined can improve notably both the performance and the stability of the perovskite solar cells. In fact, the halogen anions directly transfer electrons into the ETL and the ammonium moiety has stabilizing effect by coordinating corrosive iodide anions generating from perovskite. Furthermore, being these molecules zwitterionic, they induce the generation of dipoles at the interface with the cathode, thus beneficially modulating its work function.
The use of neutral electron-donor molecules draws inspiration from the effect observed with halogen anions and their electron-donating effect. The use of organic Lewis bases such as DBU generated a similar effect of improvement of the conductivity.
The improvement of the conductivity is also the main doping effect of N-DMBI and its derivatives, in this case through the formation of radical transfer pathways. These dopants demonstrated high versatility of action; in fact they contributed to the improvement of the performances of different ETMs, both of fullerenic and non-fullerenic nature.
A general property of polymeric dopants is helping the arrangement of the ETL in a more uniform and compact layer, thus improving the quality of the film. The better morphology means more efficient electron-transfer pathways and therefore reduced current leakage. The most commonly used doping polymer, PEIE, showed also ability to passivate the trap states and thus preventing recombination.
The versatility of non-fullerenic carbon nanoforms is clear in this topic as well. Different nanostructures induced different effects, like the improvement of morphology given by GD and the hindering of ion migration given by QDs. In each case, the performances of the cells were notably improved through the use of carbon nanostructures.
The chemical strategy of functionalizing fullerenes with doping moieties generated the so called self-doping ETLs. The chosen moieties usually contain tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium salts, which bring the aforementioned benefits of electron-transfer and free ion passivation. Furthermore, the introduction of a dopant is not necessary in this case, making the preparation of the device a little easier and with benefits on the stability. In fact, experimental evidences obtained through the study of HTM p-doping showed a partial detrimental effect on the performances over time led by dopants. Nevertheless, a balance has to be taken into consideration when determining if a dopant is good or not for the stability of the solar devices.
Last, other structures which cannot be ascribed to the listed categories have been reported, with their different doping mechanisms and various structures. The introduction of ITIC, for example, improved the polarization of the layer, hence increasing the conductivity.
To sum up, in each one of the reported cases the addition of the different dopants was beneficial for the devices, either, for example, through direct injection of electrons into the ETL, lowering the work function of the cathode metal or through modification of the morphology. Although in some cases the mechanisms have yet to be deeply explained, the n-doping strategy can be considered, in general, as an interesting and fundamental technique for the improvement of the performances and stability of perovskite solar cells. However, using an optimal doping ratio and ensuring the stability of the doped electron transport layer with its chemical environment are needed to contribute to the performance and stability enhancements in PSCs. These interactions usually are been possible thanks to the presence of functional groups in the chemical structure of dopants.
Looking further ahead, the hope is for the n-doping strategy of organic ETLs to be given the importance it really has and deserves. In fact, up to now n-doping has always been left aside, while more importance has been given to p-doping, even if both strategies are equally useful.
In addition, all information related to the effects caused for each type of dopant in this review article hopes to serve as a guide at the time of choosing a suitable n-dopant for novel ETLs, and maybe give some hints for the preparation of novel molecules that could serve as n-type dopants for perovskite solar cells.
