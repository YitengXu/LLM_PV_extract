    , Accepted 21st June 2016First published on 22nd June 2016AbstractIn this study, gold quantum clusters with distinct fluorescence properties were developed and their structural and physical behaviour was evaluated. The clusters were prepared by etching gold nanoparticles with glutathione. Three different Au33 clusters with emission profiles in the NIR region and one blue emitting cluster, Au8 were developed by varying the geometrical arrangement of atoms within the cluster. These clusters having sizes in the range of 0.7 to 2 nm were synthesized by choosing different reaction temperatures from 0 °C to 70 °C and pH between 1.5 and 10. In the three cases, formation of self assembled atoms within the cluster and the corresponding changes in optical properties were observed. A detailed evaluation of the number of atoms and the core–ligand ratio using MALDI-MS and a change in the binding energy as seen in the XPS study confirmed this finding. The study demonstrates that the self assembly of atoms and their arrangement is an important factor in determining the characteristics of the cluster. In this communication, we put forward a new concept where the number of atoms and their arrangement within the clusters play a crucial role in tuning their optical properties.
Thiol protected gold nanoclusters have attracted wide attention in various fields of modern science due to their unique optical properties.1 High stability and tunable fluorescence emission of these nanoclusters facilitate their use in various fields like imaging, catalysis and sensing.2,3 The gold–thiol ratio plays an important role in the properties of these materials, as it depends on the degree of polymerization of the gold thiol system. Structural and functional properties of these systems also depend on the number of Au(I) atoms with a d10 closed-shell electronic configuration which tend to form aggregates due to aurophilic interactions.4 The important attraction of these metallic nanoclusters is their unique optical properties which originate due to the quantum confinement of electrons compared to widely studied metallic nanoparticles.5 Even though the higher reactivity, size dependent optical properties, catalytic properties and nontoxicity of gold nanoparticles favor wide applicability in various biomedical fields including disease diagnosis and therapy, their poor fluorescence quantum yield restricts or rather complicates their use in applications like imaging.6,7 As a result, imaging applications using these systems demand either a multiphoton imaging facility8,9 or the role of additional conventional dyes10,11 both having their own limitations.
In contrast to other gold based nanomaterials, gold nanoclusters are unique because of their inherent fluorescence properties which originate due to their extremely small size (<2 nm).12,13 Chen et al., reported the use of thiol protected gold nanoclusters for solar cell applications with a power conversion efficacy of 2.3%.14 Recently, Negishi et al. have reported the efficiency of the catalytic activity of these clusters for water splitting properties of BaLa4Ti4O15 in comparison with nanoparticles.15 They found that the photocatalytic activity for water splitting was 2.6 fold greater than that of gold nanoparticles when a Au25 cluster was used. Gold nanoclusters have also attracted wide acceptance in disease diagnosis and treatment because of their non-toxicity, long term stability and higher quantum yield. Recently, we have reported the use of a gold cluster for the early stage diagnosis of tumors due to its optical imaging potential and treatment using photosensitizers incorporated into it.16
The scope of research focused on the application of these nanoclusters in various fields spans from energy storage to biomedical applications. Variety in the synthesis approach allows the development of nanoclusters with emission ranging from blue to red by changing the reaction conditions and choosing an appropriate precursor (i.e., metal to ligand) ratio.17–19 While the size dependent fluorescence properties of semiconducting nanoparticles have been well studied,20 the actual mechanism behind the emission properties of metallic nanoclusters still remains as a fantasy. It is known that the inter band and intra band transition within the conduction band is responsible for the fluorescence properties in the case of metallic nanoclusters. But the key parameters for tuning these transitions still remain unknown. Efforts are underway to understand these aspects in great detail. In this connection, Negishi et al. have studied the transition from a bulk structure to the cluster-specific structure in n-dodecanethiolate-protected gold.21 Similarly aggregation induced emission phenomena have been studied by Goswami et al., in thiolate protected gold clusters.22 The main aim of the present study is to understand the key factor that is responsible for the unique properties of glutathione protected gold clusters. In this regard, a detailed study was carried out on four different gold nanoclusters developed by varying the reaction conditions like temperature and pH. The rationale for changing the reaction pH is based on the fact that at different pH, the synthesised clusters have different emission. However, the effect of temperature on the cluster is not yet fully established.
Different sized AuC's were synthesized by etching gold nanoparticles (GMSA) with glutathione (GSH) by varying reaction temperature and pH.1–3 For the preparation of the entire sample, a 1:4 (w/w) ratio of GMSA and GSH was used. For the synthesis of gold nanoparticles, gold chloride was reduced with NaBH4 using mercaptosuccinic acid as a ligand. Briefly, 49 mg HAuCl4 and 37 mg MSA were dissolved in 25 mL methanol and allowed to react for 30 minutes. To this system 0.2 M sodium borohydride was added at 0 °C and allowed to react for 1 h. The resulting brown colored solution was precipitated in methanol and centrifuged 4 times to obtain MSA gold nanoparticles (GMSA). For the preparation of AuC1, GSH was mixed with GMSA at room temperature and pH was adjusted to 1.5. The reaction was continued for 12 h at room temperature.
AuC2 was also synthesized similarly as in the case of AuC1, except for the fact that the reaction of 12 h was continued at 70 °C after adding GSH at room temperature. AuC3 was prepared by adding GSH at 0 °C to GMSA and the reaction was continued for 12 h at a temperature of 70 °C. For the preparation of AuC4, GMSA and GSH were added at room temperature and the pH was adjusted to 10 and the etching process was allowed to complete for 12 h at 70 °C.
All the AuC's were purified to remove heavy particles and precipitated in a 1:1 ratio of methanol and isopropanol to obtain crude clusters. These pellets were re-dispersed in water and used for further analysis.
Absorbance spectra of the synthesized nanoparticles (GMSA) showed a broad absorbance, ca. 530 nm (Fig. S1a†) and excitation dependent emission characteristics (Fig. S1b†) in the visible region. GMSA had an average particle diameter of 7 nm (Fig. S1c†). Upon etching GMSA with GSH under different reaction conditions, the emission profiles of each resultant cluster were found to be unique. The observed fluorescence of gold nanoparticles is explained by Mooradian as due to the excitation of a 5d valence electron to the 6sp band, scattering in pico-second time with partial energy transfer and its recombination from the sp band which results in photon emission.23 El-Sayed and co-workers have also explained the same as surface fluorescence in the case of gold nanorods.24,25 When the dimension of the nanoparticle reduces to the order of approximately Fermi wavelength of an electron, it shows discrete energy levels because of the quantum confinement which enhances the fluorescence efficiency of the quantum cluster.
Upon 450 nm excitation, AuC1 and AuC2 (Fig. 1a and b) showed a peculiar emission profile with two prominent emission peaks ca. 530 nm and 750 nm with varied fluorescence intensities. To explain the appearance of the two peaks in AuC1 and AuC2, two possibilities are envisaged. First possibility is that there exists a mixture of gold nanoparticles and nanoclusters in these samples due to incomplete clustering of GMSA by GSH. If this is the case, the 530 nm emission profile can be attributed to the nanoparticle emission and 750 nm as the emission from the nanocluster. The second possibility is that the observed dual emission is from the alignment or assembly of the clusters in such a way that it shows the emission corresponding to both particles and clusters. In the case of AuC3 and AuC4, there is only one prominent emission peak, with a substantial blue shift in the case of AuC4 to 412 nm (Fig. 1c and d). Shifting of excitation and emission peaks from red to blue is in accordance with the reports of GSH clusters synthesised in the acidic to basic pH.17 The ratio of 750 to 530 nm peaks is found to be 1.2, 2.5, and 50.42 respectively for AuC1, AuC2 and AuC3. The quantum yield with respect to Nile blue was found to be 0.85%, 2.5% and 24% respectively for AuC1, AuC2 and AuC3. The observed enhanced photoluminescence of the clusters can be explained based on the core oxidation and aggregation induced emission, a recently observed phenomenon, as explained by Gowsami et al.22 The effect of pH and temperature on photoluminescence of different clusters is shown in Table S1 see the ESI.†

TEM analysis of the samples with the same concentrations was carried out to understand the size and morphology of the clusters. This technique is used to get information on the specific arrangement of clusters and formation of aggregates which may shed light on the specific reason for the unique and varied fluorescence properties of the different clusters.
TEM (Fig. 2) of AuC1 and AuC2 showed a peculiar arrangement of the clusters with a plate-like and helical assembly respectively. Lower magnification images give a clear indication of the more assembled structures in these cases (Fig. S2†). The diameter of AuC1 ranges from 0.7 to 2 nm whereas that of AuC2 ranges from 0.7 to 1.5 nm (Fig. S3†). In AuC3, mono-dispersed and well separated clusters with diameters of the order of 0.7 nm are observed without showing any self assembly. The absence of a prominent emission peak around 530 nm in AuC3 is an indication to assume that the emission of AuC1 and AuC2 may be due to the self assembled structures. AuC4 also shows definite structural assembly in the TEM study.

Based on this observation, we propose that contribution from the combined electronic transitions of the self assembled structure has resulted in the enhancement of the 530 nm emission peak while discrete energy transition within the energy level has resulted in the 750 nm peak. Since the emission profile of this cluster is different from that of others, the explanation for this cluster is given separately.
The self assembly of the cluster cannot be completely confirmed using the TEM image as there is a chance for solvent evaporated assembly in TEM. To check this possibility UV-visible absorbance spectra of the clusters were considered in detail. A broad surface plasmon peak is observed in AuC1, AuC2 and AuC4 around 500 nm to 650 nm. This may be due to the assembly of these nanoclusters in solution. Such a broad peak is absent in the case of AuC3 confirming this and the TEM data of mono-dispersed nature (Fig. S4†). A slight variation in the plasmon peak among the samples and different band origins (1.79, 1.53, 1.87 and 1.69 eV) indicates the formation of different assembled structures. A mechanism similar to that of the absorbance of gold nanorods is envisaged here, where a linear assembly of gold nanoparticles results in longitudinal and transverse plasmon peaks.26,27
To further extend the knowledge on details like cluster ionization and number of atoms and ligands present in the nanocluster, MALDI-MS analysis was performed. The number of core atoms and ligands present in the material plays a crucial role in the optical properties of the cluster. It is reported that the 750 nm emitting cluster consists of 33 core atoms and the 410 nm emitting cluster consists of 8 atoms. Assigning the core atoms accordingly, the number of ligands has been evaluated from the MALDI spectra (Fig. 3). Likewise, the compositions of the clusters were estimated as (Au)33(SG)28, (Au)33(SG)28, (Au)33(SG)11 and (Au)8(SG)2 for AuC1, AuC2, AuC3 and AuC4 respectively. These assignments were further validated theoretically using mMass software (Fig. 3 insets). The fragmentation in the MALDI spectra is attributed to the breakage of the gold–thiol bond of the same atomic cluster on laser irradiation. Incomplete ionization was observed for AuC1 and AuC2 in the MALDI spectra. This can be due to the utilization of partial laser energy to break the assembly to individual clusters in addition to the fragmentation of the Au–thiol bond. Complete fragmentation is observed in AuC3 for the same laser power (160 mW), where self assembly is absent. But conversely, in AuC4, complete ionization was achieved even when there was a well established self assembled structure (Fig. 3d). This is due to the presence of a comparatively lesser number of core atoms and ligands, which enabled the desorption of individual clusters and also the Au thiol-bond for the applied laser power.

The developed nanoclusters were further studied for their geometric and structural evaluation using XPS (Fig. S5†). A chemical shift was observed in the 4f7/2 peak for all the clusters (85.18, 85.25, 84.83, 85.21 eV respectively for AuC1 to AuC4).
Based on the 4f7/2 peak, Negishi et al. and Tanaka and co-workers have explained the mechanism of photoemission by de-convoluting the 4f7/2 peak in the binding energy spectrum of gold.4,28,29 The peak shift has been explained based on the ‘initial state effect’ due to electronic transition from the gold core to thiolates, which applies to the observed shift in the present study also.4 A slightly higher chemical shift observed for self assembled structures (AuC1, AuC2 and AuC4) is attributed to the electronic transition from self assembled electron to the gold core/surface gold atoms. From all these studies it is inferred that assembly of individual clusters within the system plays an important role in tuning the optical properties. In a nutshell, we can tune the cluster properties by suitably modifying the reaction conditions.
Compiling the results of the number of atoms per cluster, size of the cluster and observed self assembly, a plausible mechanism is explained in correlation with the reaction conditions. Accordingly, in the first case of AuC1, where the reaction takes place at room temperature, equilibrium of GSH is between two carboxylic groups, an amine group and one SH group when the pH is 1.5. GSH is observed to have a tendency to form a linear assembly because of the presence of the acid and amine moieties in it.30–32 During this reaction, MSA gets replaced by GSH through the S-moiety forming 33 atoms to form AuC1. Further, COO− will tend to form an assembly with the NH3+ moiety of another AuC1 and the assembly continues. While balancing between the formation of a stable cluster and self assembly at room temperature, uniformity is compromised which resulted in the occurrence of different sized particles in the TEM (Fig. 2a). But when GSH was added at room temperature and reaction is continued at 70 °C (AuC2), etching takes place uniformly. Here, addition of GSH at room temperature results in the assembly between COO− of one cluster and NH3+ of another cluster, exhibiting a helical appearance to the assembly. When GSH was added at 0 °C and the reaction was performed at 70 °C (AuC3), the system overcomes the tendency to self assemble accomplishing the most stable cluster of the study.
In the fourth case, at pH 10 the GSH equilibrium is between four carboxylic oxygen atoms, an amino group and a thiol group. MALDI analysis reveals that eight gold atoms form a cluster with two GSH ligands, but with an increase in the particle size compared to other clusters. This is because the individual eight atoms of gold are slightly separated in AuC4 compared to thirty three atoms in AuC1 and AuC2 imparting a bigger size to AuC4, in the TEM image. The most suitable way to explain the mismatch between the number of atoms and the size leads to the arrangement in such a way that 8 gold atoms interact with the negative charges of four carboxylic groups together with a centralized interaction by the thiol group so that it forms a spherical shape with spacing at the centre (Fig. 2d). Formation of different clusters is depicted schematically in Fig. 4. This mechanism was confirmed with Raman spectral analysis of the samples (Fig. S6 and S6a–d†).

Theoretical representation and geometrical optimization were carried out in order to confirm the above findings. Theoretical calculations were done using Avagadro software (advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling). Geometrical optimization was done using Landl3 basic set using the GAFF force field. For the sake of simplicity in mathematical simulation, the gold atom–ligand ratio of 33:28 of AuC1 and AuC2 was reduced to 1:1, and 33:11 and 8:2 of AuC3 and AuC4 respectively were reduced to 3:1 and 4:1. For the accuracy of mathematical simulation, the same numbers of representative units of the clusters (4 numbers) were used in all the cases (Fig. S7†).
A complete representation of the assembled system is shown in the typical case of AuC4 where the number of atoms and ligands involved are less (Fig. S8†). The prediction of AuC4 exactly mimics the TEM image of circular patterns with a central gap. Theoretical energy calculations for the self assembled structures predicted the highest energy of 1442.58 kJ mol−1 for AuC4. AuC1 and AuC2 have energies of 161.16 and 50.99 kJ mol−1 respectively. The calculated energies of the clusters justify the experimental findings in all the cases. AuC3 has a minimum energy of 9.2593 kJ mol−1 which accounts for its high stability among the clusters. The higher energy in the case of AuC4 is an indication of strong assembly among individual atoms and is reflected in the blue shifted fluorescence emission. The helical assembly is more stable than the non-uniform assembly as is evident from the slightly different energies between AuC1 and AuC2.
The optical properties of the clusters can be used for applications like sensing and imaging. In this connection the AuC3 of this study has been used as a sensor for detecting urea from whole blood and milk.33 Moreover, the materials are found to have good optical and X-ray contrast. The potential of the developed clusters for radiological CT imaging (Fig. S9†) and optical imaging was evaluated (Fig. S10†) using respective imaging modalities. It is clear from the CT images that AuC4 gives the best image contrast with maximum Hounsfield unit (HU) and AuC3, the least. The extremely small size and the monodispersed nature of AuC3 would have caused less CT contrast compared to the self assembled one. For optical imaging AuC3 leads with very good imaging potential as expected from its highest quantum yield originating due to its unique optical properties. To check the in vivo optical imaging efficacy, AuC3 was subcutaneously injected into normal mice and imaged using an optical imaging system (IVIS Spectrum). The signal from AuC3 of subcutaneous tissue was sufficient to consider the cluster for live animal imaging applications (Fig. S11†). Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal ethics committee.
To conclude, we have developed four different gold nanoclusters and studied their properties in detail. Reaction conditions like temperature and pH have a major responsibility in the cluster formation. The contribution of these factors on the size, number of atoms of the cluster, and the fluorescence properties has been explained. It is found that the initial temperature and the reaction temperature play a crucial role in the self assembly of monolayer protected clusters whereas pH of the reaction determines the number of core atoms and ligands. Based on the results of absorbance, emission properties and MALDI, a probable composition was also assigned to all the clusters studied.
