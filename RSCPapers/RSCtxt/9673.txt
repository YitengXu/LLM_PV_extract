    First published on 2nd December 2013AbstractHollow nanoarchitectured materials with straight channels play a crucial role in the fields of renewable energy, environment and biotechnology due to their one-dimensional morphology and extraordinary properties. The current challenge is the difficulty on tailoring hollow nanoarchitectures with well-controlled morphology at a relatively low cost. As a conventional technique, electrochemistry exhibits its unique advantage on machining nanostructures. In this review, we present the progress of electrochemistry as a valuable tool in construction of novel hollow nanoarchitectures through pulse/step anodization, such as surface pre-texturing, modulated, branched and multilayered pore architectures, and free-standing membranes. Basic principles for electrochemical engineering of mono- or multi-ordered nanostructures as well as free-standing membranes are extracted from specific examples (i.e. porous silicon, aluminum and titanium oxide). The potential of such nanoarchitectures are further demonstrated for the applications of photovoltaics, water splitting, organic degradation, nanostructure templates, biosensors and drug release. The electrochemical techniques provide a powerful approach to produce nanostructures with morphological complexity, which could have far-reaching implications in the design of future nanoscale systems.

1. Introduction
We have long accepted that physical and chemical properties of materials can be tuned by downsizing substances to micro/nanometer scale instead of changing their chemical compositions. In recent years, it has been discovered that special micro/nano morphology could also notably influence the performance of materials.1–10 Nanomaterials with a small diameter distribution, straight channels and self-ordered arrangements have attracted remarkable attentions due to their unusual mechanical, electrical and optical properties.1–4 These properties have enabled one-dimensional hollow nanoarchitectures to be viewed as promising materials in the applications of photocatalysis,5 sensing,6 solar energy conversion,7 nanostructure templates8 and biomedicine.9,10 In particular, periodic or multi-layered hollow nanostructures offer advantages over the straight nanochannels with uniform longitudinal morphologies.14,15 The structures render the materials to be of special interest for optoelectronic devices since the confined electrons in ordered/periodic nanostructures exhibit discrete energy levels rather than bands.16–20
The construction of hollow nanostructures has been realized by conventional microfabrication methods derived from microelectronics industry (e.g. photolithography, electron-beam lithography). These methods provide the required structural accuracy, but achieving nanometric structures involves an expensive and complex protocol that is limited to a small sample size.21 Other methods, such as inverse opal templating,22 glancing angle deposition (GLAD),23 layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly,24,25 and sol–gel processing26,27 are potential alternatives that suffer their own drawbacks. The inverse opal template method is prone to structural irregularities; the GLAD method entails expensive instrumentation and complex hardware; the LBL method includes multiple wet procedures which are sensitive to contamination and mix additional composites; the sol–gel method lacks accuracy of engineering nanostructures.
The findings of electrochemistry open up a new chapter for large scale production of self-organized nanoporous materials.11–13 The literature related to electrochemical techniques have been accumulated rapidly during the last decade. Among them, anodic porous silicon (pSi) with well-defined periodic structures show enormous advantages as optical materials.3,6,12,28 Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) can serve as template for functional materials as well as model systems for separation of particles and adsorption of molecules.8,29,30 Anodic TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) with novel structures exhibit multifunctional properties for energy regeneration and environmental remediation.3,28,31 Although their dimensional parameters such as pore diameter, channel length and wall thickness have been well characterized, the ability of precisely tailoring mono- or multi-ordered morphology along the channel is still a challenge.11–13,28 The fundamental exploration of growth mechanism behind the morphological complexities are limited, and the effects of electrochemical parameters on the formation of hollow nanostructures are empirical for the material systems.
Applications of the porous nanostructures have been discussed in several excellent review papers and books.3,11–15,30,32 The technologies and mechanisms of electrochemical anodization are considered with a focus on basic anodic parameters.11–13,30 As a part of continuous effort to exploit the unique features of porous nanostructures, this critical review surveys the progress on engineering nanoarchitectures (i.e. highly ordered,31 layered,33 branched,8,29 mono- or multi-ordered structures34 from AAO, pSi and TNT) that have been explored by pulse/step anodization. The current status of engineering nanoporous materials is addressed and mechanisms behind the morphological complexities are highlighted. The applications of pulse/step techniques to detach the anodic nanoporous films to free-standing membranes are also covered. A special emphasis is placed on extracting original or exploratory approaches in all the material systems, eventually combining with the applications in solar cells, water splitting, organic degradation, nanoengineering templates, biosensors and drug release systems. It is remarkable that the pulse/step technique is not limited to the materials (Al, Si and Ti). A series of transition metals or alloys (e.g. Ta, Zr, Sn, Nb, Hf, W and Fe) are also to form hollow nanopore structures through the electrochemical technique.35,36
2. Anodic mechanisms for structural engineering
2.1. Anodic mechanisms for nanopore formation
Since brown porous oxides were observed on crystalline Si wafers during anodization in HF solution, a number of models/mechanisms have been proposed to understand the pore formation.37–43 In principle, the pore formation is induced from competition of the chemical reactions at the silicon–electrolyte interface, such as oxide formation/dissolution. Beale et al. assume that defects at the silicon–electrolyte interface lead to a localization of current flow at the onset of anodization as well as the pore initiation.38 The semiconductor silicon between the pores is depleted of carriers and reaches a much higher resistivity than that of electrolyte or bulk silicon. The current preferentially flows through the electrolyte in the pores and dissolution occurs at the pore tips. Smith et al. assert that the dissolution process is initiated due to chemical reaction of the holes on the silicon surface diffused from the bulk.39 The pore tips are reaction sites for the hole diffusion process and the pore morphologies depend on dopant concentration and anodic voltage. Small pore dimensions result in a quantum confinement of charge carriers and an increased bandgap energy, which forms a barrier for the hole transportation toward the silicon skeleton.32 The porous structure is passivated by quantum effects and the pore tips become the sites for the holes to accumulate and continue the pore growth.
The relatively new and accepted model is so-called Current Burst Model (CBM), which is still being developed.40–43 The fundamental process is described as direct dissolution of the hydrogen-passivated silicon surface, followed by fast silicon oxide generation, then a very slow dissolution of the generated oxide, and finally hydrogen passivation once again. The time scale of the current burst and correlation length between current bursts defines the dissolution process at the silicon–electrolyte interface. The electrolyte composition influences the pore formation and propagation dynamics. The CBM is successful in describing certain aspects of pSi formation. But, it is not yet practical to, for example, predict final shape or uniformity of the pSi layer.32,40–41
The morphologies of anodic oxides of valve metals (e.g. Al, Ti) could be compact layers, ordered or randomly organized nanochannels, nanotubes and nano-porous sponge structures.11–13,35 Formation of the compact oxides appears to be a natural and simple case according to basic electrochemistry principles. However, the mechanism of pore oxides formation is still not fully resolved,13,44–56 Two relatively popular explanations are electrical-field-assisted oxide dissolution theory and plastic deformation flow of oxide theory for the pore formation, as discussed below.13,44,45
In the electrical field-assisted dissolution/oxidation theory, the initial stage is the formation of a continuous compact oxide layer, and then pitting under the compact oxide layer. The electrical field-assisted oxide dissolution results in the growth of porous structures. The chemical reactions of formation of metal oxide (MOx) and dissolution of the oxides occur at the same time, as shown in Fig. 1a.36,50,57 The competition between chemical dissolution of the oxide at pore tip and the barrier advancing speed define the thickness of the porous layer. The dominant processing parameters are temperature, F− concentration, pH value and applied voltage, which controls attacking/anodic etching rate of the materials.11,13

In the plastic flow model,48,49,58 the driving force of the self-ordering process is attributed to a stress-driven interface caused by the repulsive forces between neighboring pores. The pores are initiated as a result of mass migration of metal ions within the oxide from the pore underneath to the wall. This flow concept was originally brought up for growth of porous alumina and now has been transplanted for TNT growth.45,49 In the case of AAO self-assembly process, the elastic stress caused by volume expansion regulates the degree of uniformity and drives the perfect cylindrical and hexagonal arrangement of pores.45,48,58
All the above theories are classified into those where the dominant role is played by the semiconducting character (i.e. Si), and those focusing on the electrochemical aspects of the dissolution/oxidation. Both kinds of theories are able to make the qualitative prediction of pore formation, but up to now none has been worked out a genuinely quantitative form that would correctly yield numerical figures such as, for example, porosity and characteristic structure sizes.
2.2. Structural engineering
The potential–current is a key parameter to control pore size and thickness of the porous layers. In general, the higher the applied voltage or current density is, the stronger the electric field is applied on the substrate. The self-ordered pattern of pore arrays from common anodization is limited to a short-range spanning several microns.11–13 To precisely control the growth of channel arrays, a variety of strategies have been demonstrated available for long-range hexagonal arrangements.11–13,30 These techniques include stamp imprinting, colloid sphere lithography, electron-beam lithography, focused-ion beam lithography, holographic lithography, Ar plasma etching and direct laser writing lithography etc. The choice of the techniques depends on the scale of required pore arrangement, size and shape. Pre-patterning surfaces to improve the pore arrangement by two/multi-step anodization is of current interest.13 This approach is motivated by the idea that if the development of pore channel is guided by appropriate surface texture at the initial stage of anodization, and the parameters are maintained, long-range-ordered channel arrays are expected to grow spontaneously.
Periodic nanostructures can be grown along the channel wall under ion oscillations, which reflects periodic behavior of an electrochemical quantity in time (see Fig. 1b).59–63 During the pulse/step anodic process, acid anions are periodically transported into convection layer near the top of pores62,63 Periodical compensation of the anions is established from top to the channel bottom, which induces morphological variance on the side wall. Commonly, a low frequency voltage (period τ ∼ minutes) that is pulsed/oscillated permits the growth of bamboo-type nanotubes and 2-D nanolace sheets.64 The formation of nanoporous morphology is carried out in a fast (period τ ∼ seconds) current oscillation under potentiostatic conditions.63
Advanced multi-step anodizations have been explored to design modulated pore channels. The approaches include changing the type of electrolyte or electrolyte concentration after each step, changing electrolyte temperature, varying applied voltage–current during anodization or combining the anodization with chemical etching together.11–13 One special case is the detachment of porous membranes from the substrate, where free-standing (or/and flow-through) membranes are realized as an extension of the approaches.12,13 All these morphological appearances are associated with intrinsic properties of field-aided transport of the ionic species (F−, O2−, OH−, Mn+), local reactions as well as physical and mechanical properties of anodized materials.36,63–69
3. Electrochemical engineering of hollow nanoarchitectures
The technical functions of electrochemical engineering through pulse/step anodization are classified into four topics and discussed in this section: (i) surface pre-texturing;70–75 (ii) uniformity enhancing;76–78 (iii) vertical patterning;14,33,34,79 (iv) free-standing.80–83 These four concepts with corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are sketched in Fig. 2A–D. Progresses of the four processes derived from specific examples are addressed as follows.

3.1. Surface pre-texturing
Surface-patterning/pre-texturing draws an outline of spatial arrangement of nanoarchitecture on substrates at the beginning of electrochemical anodization. Concave dimple patterns are periodically distributed on the substrate surface after removing the oxide layer.31,72,73 These dimples serve as templates for casting periodic hole patterns into metal substrates at the nanoscale.84,85 The electric field is focused at the concave centers acting as nucleation points for the pore growth.86–89 Matching the patterned pitch with the correct applied voltage is crucial in the process since it prevents the holes from nucleating and developing outside of the pre-textured patterns. Comparing with the patterning techniques such as focused ion beam,75,90 mechanical micro-machining91 or nanoindentation,92 the anodic pre-texturing gives a similar patterning effect with a low cost.
Pre-textured Al surface with concave curvature is a desirable nanoarchitecture to capture/collect photon energy due to its high reflectivity of the dimple configuration.6,84,93 A self-organized dimple pattern with honeycomb arrangement is observed at 195 V in 0.2 M phosphoric acid (H3PO4) solution. In the process, pre-textured Al2O3 layer is dissolved by 10 wt% H3PO4 solution (or H2CrO4) and the dimple pattern with a period of ∼450 nm is self-organized on the metallic substrate (Fig. 2A).72 Further treatment with H3PO4 solution makes the dimples smooth and the treatment time influences the concave curvature. An advantage of the protocol is the possibility of accurately machining dimple size and spacing (period) by adjusting applied voltage and the type of electrolyte. Specifically, to have a periodic scale from 50 to over 1000 nm, anodization is performed in oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, and citric acid under applied voltages ranging from 19 to 450 V.11,84,94 The subsequent duration required for the oxide removal depends on thickness of the oxide films, and varies from a few minutes to several hours. To simplify the nanopatterning process, an additional reverse voltage is used to remove the oxide after the pre-texturing on Al substrate (40 V, roughness = 29 nm).95 This procedure leaves the substrate with characteristic of pore geometry on an exposed surface without using additional chemical etchants (e.g. 10% H3PO4). The diameter of the concaves is ∼80 nm, which is in fair agreement with theoretical simulation of voltage vs. pore size relationship of AAO films.11
In addition to the dimple geometry, an oriented line pattern is pre-textured by acetone treatment and subsequent anodization through applying a DC voltage (25 V) on Al substrates (99.999%) for 40 min in 0.15 M H2SO4 electrolyte.96 Average current density (j) of the pre-texturing process is ∼1 mA mm−2. The line separation is approximately 30–40 nm and the depth of the line channel is estimated to be 7 nm. The oriented line-type nanostructure is further modified with chemical reagent (3–20% commercial SEMICLEAN LGL etchant) and ultrasonic agitation to remove the top oxides. Dynamic force microscopy measurements show that a tiled-step/sawtoothed structure is created from the oriented line structure. The nanoscale sawtooth-type structures composed of tiled steps are spanned over 5 μm2 areas and aligned along the originally oriented lines. In the case of single crystal aluminum substrate, the Al(110) surface exhibits a regular striped array, with hexagonally ordered patterns occurring on the Al(111) and (100) surfaces.97 The symmetries of (111), (100) and (110) planes of face-centered cubic Al are hexagonal, face-centered and rectangular, respectively. The strong correlation between the length scale/symmetry of patterns and the applied voltage indicates that an interfacial instability caused by preferential adsorption of alcohol molecules/electrolyte component on surface ridges, might be responsible for the pattern variety.11,86,87,97,98 Chang and co-workers define that the instability is balanced by surface diffusion of the adsorbate to yield a length scale of 4π(Ds/kd)1/2, where Ds is the surface diffusivity and kd is the desorption coefficient of the adsorbate, which correlates well with the measured wavelength. The simulated data are in qualitative and quantitative match with experimental measurements by using atomic force microscopy (AFM).98
Two-step anodization is a modified procedure of a single step protocol which the latter produces uneven surfaces and poor alignment of porous arrays.31,74,86,99 By separating the anodic protocol into two, the process that pre-texturing is sorted as a first step and further anodization as second step lead to a highly self-assembled hexagonal pattern arrangement.87–89 The pre-textured concave patterns are generated on Al surface in 0.3 M oxalic acid solution after removing top oxides in a mixture of H3PO4 (6.0 wt%) and H2CrO4 (1.8 wt%). This pre-textured specimen is further anodized for 5–60 s to achieve a nanodot array master mold with a pitch of about 100 nm and height/depth of 90 nm for photonanoimprinting.85 Increasing the anodization time increases the surface uniformity.11 Combinatorial fabrication is successfully applied to generate a 256 member library of porous aluminum oxide with different pore sizes and pore densities on a wafer.100 The library shows that the process could be repeated even more than three or four times, leading to an increase in the long-range uniformity of pore size and diameter.100,101
The success of pre-texturing on Al substrates encourages researchers to seek comparable routes of patterning titanium substrates with hexagonally packed structure.102–104 Self-organization arrays are observed on Ti substrates (purity: 99.6% or 99.99%) by applying voltage (50 V) as first pre-texturing. An ordered arrangement of the nanotube bottoms is achieved on both substrates after the first anodization step with thickness of approx. 30 μm. The material purity looks to have strong influences on the ordering – i.e. fewer flaws in the arrangement are appeared on high purity material (99.99%). However, the patterns still show a few irregular shapes after the first anodic step. By the second anodic step, the ordering degree of self-organized arrays is increased for both Ti materials; the nanotubes tend to pack themselves in an ordered manner as a result of the pre-textured surface.
Zhang et al. argued that the purity is not the first critical parameter, and that the voltage ramp rate should not be neglected.104 Using Ti foils (99.6%), they were able to reach large size porous TiO2 domains with ideal hexagonal ordering by two-step patterning. In the first patterning, the potential is ramped at a rate of 0.5 V s−1 from open-circuit potential (OCP) to 60 V. For the second, 60 V is applied at the beginning of anodization. Then the substrate is exposed in an ultrasonic bath to clean the oxides for achieving ordered dimple arrangements. As an alternative of the two-step patterning, the first patterning is a electropolishing mode, which smooth Ti surface (i.e. roughness ∼1 nm) causes a uniform electric field distribution over the metal surface during second patterning.88,99,105 By adopting the pre-pattering, the concept of ordered nanostructures has been extended to other valve metals (i.e. Nb2O5, TiO2, WO3 and Ta2O5). The valve metal oxide nanotubes with a long-range order have a great potential application in nanodevices.36
3.2. Uniformity enhancing
AAO is a well-known template for 1-D nanoarchitecture development as well as a model system for investigating separations of particles and adsorption characteristics of molecules.30 Conventional AAO is prepared under potentiostatic condition on high-purity (99.997%) aluminum foils at low temperatures (0–10 °C). Hybrid pulse anodization (HPA: normal-positive and small-negative voltages) pushes the fabrication process temperature up to 20–30 °C with low material requirements (Al purity, 99%).77,106–111 The pore distribution uniformity and shape-circularity of AAO (purity 99.997% foil) are 82.9% and 0.3 in 0.5 M oxalic acid at 5 °C for 1 h DC anodization (or DCA). Both of the uniformity and circularity are increased to 92.6% and 0.7 after the HPA at the same parameters as those in the DCA. When the environment temperature is increased to 15 °C, the distribution uniformity of AAO nanostructures formed by the HPA are ∼88.6%. On the contrary, the characteristics of the nanostructures disappear at 15 °C for the DCA. Although the pore uniformity and circularity are slightly decreased at the elevated temperature in HPA, the growth rate is largely increased from 1.2 μm h−1 at 5 °C to 4.1 μm h−1 at 15 °C. The negative period with nearly zero cathodic current is an effective cooling to optimize AAO uniformity. The positive hydrogen ions attracted to the surface lead to the dissolution of the top AAO. The advantages of the cooling and extra dissolution in HPA are helpful to growing AAO at relatively high temperatures.112,113 Extending both the positive and negative pulse period of the HPA from 1 s to 5 s raises the distribution uniformity from 91% up to ∼95%.110 The HPA not only allows shortening the running time for manufacturing and cost reduction, but also promotes pore distribution uniformity.
DC anodization is a common method to fabricate the pSi, which the reaction products SiFx tend to accumulate at the pore tips. The by-product H2 bubbles are adsorbed at the surface of silicon pillars due to interfacial tension, blocking the silicon pores and reducing the HF diffusion in the pores.114,115 The side-effects deteriorate 1-D hollow nanotube uniformity or microcavity qualities. Then, pulse anodic methods plus additional conditions (i.e. ultrasonic treatment) are developed to solve the difficulty as well as to increase the uniformity.114 The reaction products are diffused from silicon pores to the electrolyte during the pause period of anodic current and the uniformity is superior to that of the DC process. Even so, the speed of natural diffusion of SiFx and H2 bubbles by the pulse anodization is still slow (duty cycle ∼50%). Decreasing the pulse duration increases the diffusion rate of the reaction product away from pSi holes, and is desirable to the recovery of HF concentration at the pore bottom.115 As a result, a duty cycle of 5–10% and pulse duration of 0.1–0.2 microseconds render high uniformity and smoothness for the pSi (Si〈111〉, 0.06 Ω cm, electrolyte:HF (40 wt%):H2O:C2H5OH = 3:3:2, volume ratio).
Relatively low porosity gradients and interface roughness are desirable for high sensitivity of passive pSi-multilayer optical sensors. The study of pulse frequencies from 0.1 to 1000 Hz and duty cycles of 5–50% shows that the combination of low frequency (0.1 Hz, j = 10 mA cm−2) and low duty cycle (5%) leads to pSi films with low interface roughness or porosity gradient.78,115,116 Maintaining same charge amount supplied during the positive square pulse, pSi morphologies are studied at different frequencies (from constant current to 100 Hz), and the anodic etching rate/thickness formed at 10 Hz frequency is found to be maximum. High frequency (∼100 Hz) causes a higher interface roughness as compared to DC anodization equivalents.114,116 However, interface surface roughness exponentially decreases with increasing duty cycle at 1 kHz. The trends of the porosity gradient with respect to duty cycle are similar to that found for the roughness. High frequency gives large porosity gradients at low duty cycle; the low frequency tends to lead to zero porosity gradients. The duty cycle–frequency relationship for both roughness and porosity gradient shows similar relationships, indicating that the inhomogeneity and roughness observed in pSi films might be due to the unstable multistep dissolution kinetics of silicon.116
The pulse anodization in aqueous and organic electrolytes has different impacts on the TNT array uniformity.13,76,117 Mixing organic additive (i.e. ethylene glycol and PEG – polyethylene glycol) with aqueous electrolyte is an innovative approach for tuning the TNT morphology. The organic additive plays a role of suppressing local concentration fluctuations and pH bursts due to its relatively high viscosity. The nanotube array uniformity is enhanced when pulse anodization is combined with organic additives in the electrolyte (or extremely low aqueous content: 3rd generation electrolyte for TNT anodization).13,69 In the 3rd generation electrolyte, the TNTs prepared by pulse anodization mode presents better-defined nanotube morphologies than those at constant voltage.76 It shows that large area arrays with self-organized assembly and much less cloudy precipitation arrays are more likely to form under the pulse process (20 V/0 V) rather than the DCA.
A pulse waveform optimizes nanotube wall morphology as well as protecting the surface through electroadsorption of electrolyte species NH4+.76,117 The pulse waveforms (20 V/0 V in 0.36 M NH4F–ethylene glycol–H2O 90:10) with a short duration (τ = 7 s) yields a clean TNT surface. A shorter pulse duration (τ = 2 s) induces a well-organized TNT array with narrow distribution of pore diameters (∼69–71 nm).76 The negative voltage limit of the pulse (20 V/−4 V) and its duration lead to the adsorption of NH4+ species that in turn inhibits chemical attacks on the oxide nanoarchitecture by F− species. The longer the period of the pulse is at the negative voltage limit, the thicker the nanotube walls and shorter the nanotube length are. At variance, with 0 V as the low voltage limit, the longer the pulse duration, the thinner the oxide nanotube wall is, suggesting that chemical attack by F− ions is not counterbalanced by NH3/NH4+ species adsorption, unlike the interfacial situation prevailing at −4 V. Two factors have to be considered for the observation of short nanotubes with the pulse duration at the lower potential: (i) when the walls grow thicker, they contain more material in the x–y plane and therefore the z-axis (nanotube length) should be shorter than in the case of thinner walls in order to maintain the same amount of TiO2 in both cases. (ii) As the pulse anodization is applied for the same total time as that of the constant voltage, the time for the growth of nanotubes at the positive potential limit is shorter than that of the latter.118 Both nanotube wall thickness and length decrease when the lower pulse limit is set at 0 V. These results demonstrate that, at 0 V, the major effect is from F− ions at the oxide/electrolyte interface, where the TiO2 surface is converted into highly soluble TiF62−.
3.3. Vertical patterning
Periodically reproducing one or two processes is a facile method of vertically tailoring AAO towards single, double and multi-modulated nanoarchitectures.119–125 A representative process for modulated diameter along the axial direction is a mild anodization (MA, 1–2 μm h−1, j = 1–5 mA cm−2) and/or followed by hard anodization (HA, 50–100 μm h−1, j > 50 mA cm−2). The MA produces self-ordered porous structures; the rate is slow and works for a narrow range of process conditions. Although classical HA is faster, it produces films with disordered pore structures even at low temperature (1 °C). The formation of a periodically modulated diameter of nanopores needs to switch the electrolytes in order to meet both MA and HA requirements.63,126
A pulsed HA/MA anodization is a continuously structural engineering approach without the requirement of tedious electrolyte replacement.33,127 One conventional scheme of periodically engineering nanoporous AAO is performed in 0.3 M H2SO4 (or H2C2O4, H3PO4) electrolyte under a potentiostatic condition. Its current–voltage–time relation and structural sketch during pulse anodization are plotted in Fig. 3a.33,124 It can be seen that a pulse current consisting of a low potential pulse followed by a high potential pulse or in the form of periodic waves induces a periodic structure along the growth direction. Two representative cross-section SEM images of AAO prepared by pulse voltage and current anodization (UMA = 25 V, τMA = 120 s, UHA = 35 V, τHA = 0.5 s; jMA = 3.16 mA cm−2 and τMA = 10 s, jHA = 200 mA cm−2 and τHA = 2 s) are shown in Fig. 3b and c.33,127 The images indicate that the pulse current process produces a well-organized axial direction arrangement. A series of potential waves consisting of two or more different pulses with designated periods and amplitudes have verified the unique tailoring capability of the internal pore structure. The periodic AAO nanotubes exhibit a high degree of directional coherency along the pore axis, as shown in Fig. 4a–d.34,128–132 Particularly, by modulating the anodic current in the form of periodic waves with different ramping rates, amplitudes and periods, the current profiles are translated into desired features (Fig. 4e).133,134 This method is able to synthesize optical photonic crystals with large-area and precisely thickness.

Other parameters were fixed at U1 = 80 V, U2 = 140 V, U3 = U4 = 160 V, τi2 = τi4 = 0 s, τi3 = 0.2 s, where i denotes the pulse (i = 1, 2, 3,…). The repeating units of pulses are shown as insets in the respective images. Anodization was conducted using 0.3 M H2C2O4 (1 °C) (adapted from ref. 34, Copyright 2010, IOP Publishing Ltd), (e) illustration of AAO with complex pore architectures using three successive galvanostatic cyclic anodization steps (adapted from ref. 133, copyright 2009, Wiley-VCH). 
Porosity and multi-layered optical thickness are crucial parameters for pSi photonic crystals.135–137 The pore diameter of the crystals is distributed from nano to macropores between 1 nm to a few microns. As a general rule, the size of pore diameter increases with increasing p-type doping concentrations; it decreases with increasing doping concentration for n-type Si.15 The pores with artificially controlled morphology such as double layer, Bragg stack, microcavity and rugate structures have been achieved through tuning the waveforms of pulse current.138–152Fig. 5a–d show cross-section SEM images of p-type pSi prepared by four different kinds of pulse current–voltage waveforms.137,145–147 The strong contrast between the alternate layers indicates the existence of a large porosity layer difference. In the low porosity layers, nanocrystals (light region layers) are densely assembled as a result of their larger crystalline size. Actual refractive index is controlled by pulse current density: the higher the current, the larger the refractive index is.138–140 The refractive index contrast between the layers formed by the current density of 10.0 and 70.0 mA cm−2 is large enough for generating a strong optical characterization. Pore diameter modulation along the axial direction with symmetric sine-wave shape,153 asymmetric saw tooth-like154 as well as sharp-step configuration155 have been created by properly programming the pulse current–voltage profile. Modulating the pore diameter along axial direction extends the pSi morphology to quasi-3D structures based on simple dimension, e.g. square or hexagonal.156,157 The 3-D periodic pSi crystals (so-called dielectric photonic band gap) spark extensive interest in photoelectrical fields.

It is a common phenomenon for potentiostatic anodization that side walls of the nanotubes exhibit irregularities/thickness variations.62,158–161 Pulse voltage–current gives rise to controllable growth of nanotube wall thickness.28 For instance, rocking voltage (sine wave, 20–60 V) tailors the TNTs along the axial direction with periodic length ∼5 μm,162 bamboo-type structures with ridges on the outer-wall is seen under AC voltages between 120 and 40 V (Fig. 6a);14,64 the double-wall with bamboo-type structures are realized at alternating voltage in an NH4F/ethylene glycol electrolyte (Fig. 6b), where the pulse voltages are 120 V/80 V (upper level) and 40 V/20 V (lower level) with the holding time of the two voltages from 1 to 12 minutes.163 To ensure the uniformity of periodic length, current pulses are applied to attain constant growth rate of TNTs during each cycle. The bamboo-type nanotubes with concave waists are shown in Fig. 6c.28 Obviously, the pulsed current provides a good control to form bamboo-shaped morphology as compared to potentiostatic mode.164 The key point of periodic morphologies along the tube length is the interruption of established growth equilibria between pulse steps. The potentiostatic current flow exhibits an exponential drop as a function of time, and growth rate of the oxides in such process decreases with time. Using a pulse voltage it is hard to precisely control the section length due to the decreasing current during the anodization.
 Fig. 6  Patterned wall of TNTs: (a) bamboo-type tubes, grown under alternating voltage conditions, with a sequence of 1 min at 120 V and 5 min at 40 V (adapted from ref. 64, copyright 2008, Wiley-VCH), (b) double-walled structures and bamboo-like morphologies (adapted from ref. 163, copyright 2011, with permission of Elsevier), (c) bamboo-like tubes with the reinforced compact parts at the interface regions engineered under the current-pulse conditions (adapted from ref. 28, copyright 2011, Wiley-VCH), (d) anodic voltage: shifting from 30 V to 10 V (adapted from ref. 166, copyright 2011, with permission of Elsevier), (e) 1 → 2 → 2 → 2 structure by decreasing the voltage from 85, 60, 42.5, 30 V preparation (adapted with permission from ref. 174, copyright 2011, American Chemical Society), (f) four sectional nanotube arrays. The bamboo-shaped nanotube sections were generated under a square-wave anodizing voltage (both the 60 V and 30 V voltages lasted 5 min in one period) (adapted from ref. 176, copyright 2010, with permission of Springer). 
After flat-wall TNTs diverge into multiple branches, further furcation of branched nanotubes produces hierarchically branched nanotubes with complex multilayer structures.158,165–172 The pulse voltage is switched between 10 V and 30 V every 10 min in the first three periods and 20 min is adopted during last period of 30 V. It is seen from cross-section image in Fig. 6d that the thickness of vertically patterned TNT arrays increases with anodization time.166 The growth of second tube layer is either started from bottom of the first tube layer or the gaps between the nanotubes.83,171,173 The diameters of branched nanotubes and the number of branches are difficult to manipulate.64,168,169Fig. 6e shows hierarchically branched TNTs with four layers (1 → 2 → 2 → 2) created by a applied voltage with a factor of  three times, and the white arrows indicate the location of three branching layers.174 Specifically, the applied voltage is maintained at 85 V for 8 minutes, then 60 V at 15 V min−1 for 30 minutes, reduced to 42.5 V at 15 V min−1 for 1 h, and finally 30 V at 8 V min−1 for 1 h. The thickness of each branched layer is dependent on the anodization time. As a result, by reducing the applied voltage in multiple steps with different  factors, various types of branched TNTs are prepared, such as both bamboo-shaped and smooth-walled sections (Fig. 6f).174,175 The bamboo-type layer is prepared under square potential pulses and followed by constant current anodization.176 Two parameters have to be noted in the construction of branched nanostructures: (i) constant concentration F− is favorable to the formation of strong transition joints between layers when the anodic process is switched from one to another step. (ii) To enhance the parity in diameters, the voltage of DC process should be equal to the maximum of square wave voltage.
3.4. Free-standing and flow-through
Free-standing and flow-through membrane is an ideal construction material for high efficiency catalytic reactors or filters in contrast with substrate-based/immobilized ones.83 Free-standing membranes are fabricated by removing a barrier layer from the U-shaped bottom of anodic pores on pristine metal substrates.36,80–83 The methods of cleaning the barrier layers include chemical dissolution, reverse electrochemical anodization or ion beam177,178 and plasma sputtering.179 For porous alumina, Al substrate is dissolved by heavy-metal salts such as HgCl2 (ref. 177 and 180) or CuCl2.181–183 The thin barrier layer is then cleaned by a dilute aqueous H3PO4 solution. The main disadvantage of the process is pore widening as well as contamination from heavy-metal ions. To protect the pores from widening, a mixture of nitrocellulose and polyester resin in organic solvents or nail polish is coated on the membrane surface. Although ion milling is an alternative physical technique to open the protruding U-shaped bottom without the danger of contamination, it is still preferable to take away the remaining Al substrate by HgCl2 solution prior to ion milling due to the high running cost.184
The approach by adjusting pulse/step sequences is introduced to eliminate the barrier layer during the anodic process.185 When the applied voltage is stepped down from 160 to 0.1 V in 5% decrements, the dissolved barrier layer enables the membrane to be peeled off from pristine substrates.80,185 Inspection of electron microscope images reveals that distribution of pore size and arrangement are relatively low for the membranes. A combination of the pre-texturing technique (see Section 3.1) and voltage transition technique is applied to detach ordered pore arrays from the substrate. The detachment process, in which a short-time pulse of 5–10 V higher than the membrane forming potential, dissolves the barrier layer and separates the porous AAO membrane from the underlying substrate.186 Reversing polarity of the electrodes has a similar effect on barrier layer removal at the final stage of anodization.187,188 In the reversing polarity process, the electrolysis is performed in neutral KCl solution with AAO as the cathode. The reversed voltage (−3.5 to −5.0 V) detaches large pieces of AAO membranes from rigid substrates in situ, particularly suitable for integration of thin-film AAO-based nanodevices.187–189
The detachment of free-standing pSi membranes from silicon substrates has been developed by current density transition as far back as 1965.82 Considering the formation of pSi layer with a certain thickness, this layer is released by sharply increasing current density to silicon electropolishing mode (∼500 mA cm−2 for p-type silicon).190–197 A major disadvantage of the method is that the layer is easily broken into small pieces after detaching from substrates. A refined method for the detachment is examined by reducing the HF concentration at the end of the anodic process.82 A positive effect is achieved in a comparatively narrow range of electrolyte compositions and current densities, which hinders the growth of large area membranes with prescribed characteristics and takes a long process time (several hours). A method with constant current density in the electrolyte (j = 5–15 mA cm−2, 48% HF solution and acetic acid in a 4:7 ratio), instead of a mixture of HF solution with ethanol, is discovered to meet the detachment requirements.12,82 The porous layers are anodized on p-type Si substrates (〈100〉 orientation with a resistivity of 1–4 Ω cm) under room illumination. Then, to detach the pSi layer from the substrate, the current density is raised at a constant rate of 2–20 mA cm−2 min−1. At the instant of detaching the layer, the process is terminated. The thickness of detached membrane is in the range between 50 to 200 μm. Generally, porous layers of different porosities are realized by changing the current density in a constant HF concentration. Lower HF concentration results in higher porosity layers and higher HF concentration leads to lower porosity layers. Keeping this in mind a free-standing pSi layer is separated from the substrate by two methods: (i) separation of the low-porosity layer from the high-porosity layer is realized by applying a small mechanical force; (ii) an electropolishing mode is applied in low HF concentration electrolyte with increasing current density at the end of anodization.
Free-standing TNT membranes are considered as quasi 2-D arrays that exhibit large surface-to-volume ratios and unidirectional electrical channels with few grain boundaries.83 The membranes are released from the substrate through ultrasonic splitting,198 solvent evaporation,199 selective dissolution of the metallic Ti substrate,99,200 or dissolution of the amorphous layer between desired crystalline TNT arrays and Ti substrate.201 The bottom ends of free-standing TNT membrane are at a closed state after the detachment. Subsequent steps involving chemical cleaning by HF vapor, dilute HF–H2SO4 solution, ICP (inductively coupled plasma) sputtering or oxalic acid are used to open the bottom ends.83 An alternative method is to fluctuate the voltage at the end of anodization to open the pores.202–207 The process is performed at constant voltage of 100 V for a period of 2–3 h in an electrolyte solution of NH4F/ethylene glycol electrolyte. At the end of the process, the voltage is decreased to 10 V with a time period of 0.5–1 minutes. The TNT layer is then delaminated in a methanol bath by sonication, and flow-through channels are observed on the membrane.205 Our recent report presents a new method, in which the immobilized membranes with ordered TNTs are prepared in an electrolyte of ethylene glycol under 60 V over a time period of 24 h. The samples are then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h, before being exposed to a second anodization step at 20, 60 and 100 V for 60, 30 and 10 minutes, respectively. All of the membranes are released from their substrates by taking advantage of different mechanical stresses between the layers. A schematic of presumed detachment, top-view images of the membranes (a–c) and residual layers on the corresponding substrates (d–f) are shown in Fig. 7.202 Instead of decreasing the voltage at the end of anodization, the membranes are also detached by raising the voltage from 60 V to 80–180 V.203,204,206,207 This method is attributed to local acidification and gas evolution produced by potential transition. Through the voltage transition at the end of anodization, the bottom morphology is tailored by tuning the magnitude and duration of the voltage, which allows the bottom barrier layer to become fragile.

An up-to-date survey on electrochemically engineered AAO, pSi and TNT are summarized in Tables 1–3. Experimental data under various conditions are being accumulated rapidly. Constructive principles deduced from the table are: (i) surface pre-texturing is an effective and facile approach to guide the growth of hexagonally ordered nanopores; (ii) fast pulse anodization (τ ∼ s) merits saves energy as well as improving the uniformity of pore distribution; (iii) vertically patterning by slow pulse (τ ∼ min)/step anodization is an approach to produce nanostructures with advanced morphology; (iv) morphological modulation by current pulses is an accurate technique to create periodic nanoarchitectures; (v) transition voltage–current at the end of anodization is an environmental-friendly method to detach porous membranes from the substrates. Although it would be reasonable to compare the morphological complexity under similar conditions over different material systems, often such data are not readily available.

4. Emerging applications and prospects
4.1. Solar cells
The efficiency of photon-to-electrical conversion of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is related to TiO2 nanostructures, which regulate solar energy absorption/dye loading, charge separation, transportation, recombination etc.7,14,208 A conversion efficiency increase from 1.6% to 1.9% is observed by improving the arrangement of the nanotube arrays since aligned TNTs with high dye coverage area shows high absorption of solar energy.209 The near-zero wall contacts between nanotubes maximize accessibility of dye molecules on the external surface area. By vertically patterning, the bamboo-type structures are capable of loading more dye in DSSCs, and yields photon conversion efficiency 55% higher than that of flat-wall TNTs.14 Periodic TNT photonic crystal (PC) coupling on top of flat-wall TNTs is a reasonable concept to trap solar energy, as shown in Fig. 8A. A conversion efficiency of 7.1% is verified by optimizing the thickness of each layer and axial period number of the PC layer. Various mechanisms are associated with the photovoltaic performance,7 such as photon localization and red light absorption near the edges of photonic bandgap, light reflection within the photonic bandgap at various angles and formation of photon resonance modes within the dye-sensitized layer.

Comparing to the immobilized TNTs, the free-standing one provides a possibility for front-illumination design in DSSCs due to the absence of opaque substrate.201,203,210,211 A front-illuminated type DSSC with inverted (bottom-up) membranes shows a conversion rate of 6.2%, whereas an upright (face-up) structure is about 4.8%. The barrier at the bottom interface might hinder electron transport across the interface TNT/FTO (fluoride tin oxide, electrode).210 Ion-milling the barrier layer to reduce its thickness improves the conversion efficiency from 2.5% to 3.1%.211 Increasing the membrane thickness from 5 to 10 μm, one with 7 μm thick membrane shows the conversion efficiency of 1.9% under AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2. This implies that an optimum thickness exists for free-standing TNT-membrane based DSSCs.203 The optimized conversion efficiency of front-illuminated DSSCs is about 8.8% by stacking multilayer free-standing TNT membranes on nanoparticles.83 The rings or large ripples on the nanotube wall surface from pulse/step anodization are helpful to dye loading and to increase the absorption of solar energy as well.
4.2. Water splitting
Hydrogen/solar fuels generation from water splitting is the ultimate goal for renewable energy development.105,212 Since the pioneering work of water splitting was demonstrated on TiO2 surface in 1972, considerable efforts have been focused on the exploration of suitable photoanode materials. 1-D nanostructured oxide photoelectrodes, such as nanotubes, nanowires or nanorods, have attracted much attention due to their hollow characteristics for light absorption, charge separation and transport.105,212–214Fig. 8B depicts a setup for water photoelectrolysis with a TNTs photoanode. The photocurrent density with an ordered TNT array electrode fabricated by three-step anodization is about 24 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M KOH, which is 2.2 times higher than that of flat-wall TNTs (∼11 mA cm−2) by single-step anodization. The corresponding H2 evolution rate is elevated up to 420 μmol h−1 cm−2 in 2 M Na2CO3 + 0.5 M ethylene glycol.105,212,215
Photocurrent density and photon to current conversion efficiency of a hierarchical TNTs electrode are 1.59 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V in 1.0 M KOH vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and 0.84%, respectively, which the latter value was claimed to be the highest photon-to-current conversion efficiency of pristine TiO2 materials under illumination of AM 1.5G.213 In hierarchical TNTs-type photoelectrolysis, the conversion efficiency of two-step hierarchical TNTs are greater than 0.31%, at least two times higher than that of a one-step sample. The hierarchically branched TiO2 nanorod structures with large contact area for the electrolyte provide excellent light-trapping characteristics and a highly conductive pathway for charge carrier collection. Under xenon lamp illumination (UV spectrum matched to AM 1.5G, 88 mW cm−2), the branched TiO2 nanorod array produces a photocurrent density of 0.83 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency reaches 67% at 380 nm with an applied bias of 0.6 V vs. RHE, nearly two times higher than bare nanorods without branches.212 In comparison with that of immobilized TNTs (0.6%),216 maximum conversion efficiency from light energy to chemical energy is 0.70% for open-ended TNT membrane/FTO, the efficiency for closed-end nanotube/FTO and particle/FTO electrode are 0.22% and 0.36%.214 This significant difference between free-standing and immobilized TNTs comes from the bottom cap blocked H+ diffusion out of the TiO2 layer as well as the number of charges reaching the electrode.
4.3. Organic degradation
A wide range of organic compounds are able to be degraded to nontoxic minerals by photocatalysis.217–221 When anatase TiO2 is illuminated with the light wavelength below 400 nm, electrons are transferred from the valence band to conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. If these electron–hole pairs are separated from each other without recombination, they migrate to the catalyst surface. Chemical radicals with strong oxidizing agents are formed; organic pollutants are subsequently destroyed by the radical attack.222
The TNTs through pulse/step anodization show strong capability for photo-induced methylene blue degradation and bacteria killing function, since the pulse/step mode adds another dimension to the nanotube characteristics for light absorption as well as large contact area with the pollutants. The decomposition rate of nanoporous titania (0.0574 h−1) is higher than that of flat-wall TNTs (0.0412 h−1) evaluated by methyl orange solution (12 mg L−1) under UV illumination.104 Hierarchical top-porous/bottom-tubular TiO2 nanostructures decorated with Pd nanoparticles are introduced for photoelectrocatalytic decomposition of synergistic pollutants.223 The Pd-hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure electrode gives a higher degradation rate of organic dyes than that of conventional TNT electrode.
Free-standing and flow-through membranes allow direct, size-selective, photocatalytic reactions with high efficiency. Each reagent molecule traverses an identical pore and, ideally, each diffusion path is engineered through control over the pore diameter, wall composition and length. This gives more controllable contact times than those with a conventional catalyst. A flow-through TNT membrane is demonstrated in a novel reactor, as shown in Fig. 8C.224 The membrane exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than the one with closed-ended via bleaching methylene blue solution under UV irradiation.224,225 To increase solar energy absorption, visible-light activated photocatalyst is developed by sensitizing the free-standing TNT membranes with CdS nanoparticle.226 This open-end TNT membrane permits entry of photons and the reactants have accesses to the nanotube-array surface as well as superior electron collecting efficiency. An increase of ∼10 times in the first-order rate constant of methylene blue photodegradation is identified as compared with the titania (P25) film. In addition, it was reported that free-standing composite arrays with Ag decoration exhibit higher photocatalytic capability in the degradation of methylene blue dye and pentachlorophenol as compared with bare TNTs.227 The decoration of Ag nanoparticles modifies the interfacial properties and optimize the electron transfer process between the ions of OH−, H+ and molecules of O2, H2, which decreases the evolution potential of oxygen and smooths the hydrogen evolution process.
4.4. Nanoengineering templates
Nanoporous AAO membranes with tailored internal pore structures have been known for decades as templates for synthesis of low dimensional nanostructures.8,29,119,180 In the process, the templates are filled with secondary materials through pressure injection of Sn, vacuum evaporation of Ag, magnetron sputtering of Pt, electroless deposition of Ag, Au and Pd or electrochemical deposition (plating) Ag.180 Among these techniques, electroplating is considered as the most attractive method, which deposits conductive materials into the AAO channels featuring the arrays with dense, continuous and high crystalline nanostructures.
The AAO templates have been shape-tailored into branched, segmented or multilayered structures along the axial direction in addition to the flat internal structures.8,119,228–233 To realize shape-tailored metallic nanowires, metals such as Pt, Cu and Co are electrochemically deposited into the serrated anodic alumina template, which the metal nanowires present an outstanding catalytic activity (Fig. 8D).130 The chronoamperograms measured under 0.66 V at 22 °C indicate less accumulation of poisoning carbonaceous species on Pt surface; that is, more active sites remain on the serrated nanowires (∼53.6%) as compared to flat nanowires (∼37.6%). For free-standing barcode nanowires (e.g. Co/Pt, Au/Ag, Au–Ni, Pt–Ni) released from the AAO templates, ferromagnetism of the barcode nanowires (Co/Pt) is modulated according to the magnetic segments and shape anisotropies. The ferromagnetic properties of Co/Pt barcodes are increased through interfacial alloying processes. The ferromagnetic Ni nanotubes show isotropic magnetic hysteresis loops with multisegmented Au–Ni nanowires exhibiting a preferential magnetic orientation along the axial direction of nanotubes.228,229 Magnetization measurements reveal that Ni–Pt array nanowires with 20 nm diameters has a high coercivity (∼1169 Oe) and remanence ratio (∼0.96).229 Cone- and bone-shaped alloy (Au/Ag) nanowires with longitudinal variation of compositions are generated via deposition from a flowing plating solution.230,231 Even more complicated structures, such as branched carbon nanotubes,8,128,233 silicon nanotubes,234 interconnected nanowire–nanotube heterojunctions,29 3-D interconnected porous carbons128 and metallic nanowires with several hierarchical levels have been reported by using branched AAO nanochannels as templates.232 The template-based “nanomachining” concept is versatile and could be extended to diverse shapes of nanowires with a variety of properties, generating an attractive assortment of nano-devices.
4.5. Biosensors
Biosensor research is an emerging field with an immense market spanning a broad spectrum of applications, such as biomedical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, veterinary and food quality controls.235–240 Biosensors consist of a highly specific recognition element that detects a biological signal and corresponding transducer that converts the biological signal into a physical unit (voltage, current, capacitance, frequency or light).236 Here, we focus on optical interferometric transducers made from inexpensive and optically flat thin-film pSi.6,9,15,236
The sensitivity of biomolecule detection through spectral interference depends on the reflection of white light at the interfaces above (air or solution) and below (crystalline Si) the pSi layer. When small biomolecules penetrate the pores of surface layers, corresponding modification in the refractive index of the films triggers a shift in spectral positions of the Fabry–Perot fringes.6,16 Lin et al. observed a blue shift of fringe pattern (i.e. towards shorter wavelengths of the optical spectrum) upon streptavidin binding, which is attributed to a molecular complexation-induced expulsion of charge carriers from the pSi into the bulk silicon, consistent with a reduction in the refractive index.236 By contrast, an opposite effect is observed as well: a red shift of the fringe pattern (i.e. towards longer wavelengths) and a corresponding effective optical thickness increase.237 The red shift phenomenon is understood through replacement of water (n ∼ 1.33) with protein, which has a higher refractive index (n ∼ 1.42). The reason for these two contradicting effects has never been conclusively established. Even if they have similar oxidation parameters, the effects of uniformity enhancing as well as vertical pattering have to be considered in the two reports. With regard to sensitivity, the blue-shift sensor outperforms the red-shift sensor by a factor of 105 and achieves detection limits in the sub-picomolar range.238–240 To attain the optimum sensing capability, multiple parameters has to be tuned,235 such as the pore size relative to the biomolecules, anodization parameters (current density, etchant composition, wafer type and doping level) and the post-etch treatment (oxidation, KOH soaking and receptor immobilization).
The process of pSi-based biosensors is initiated by oxidation and silane-functionalization that permit a recognition element to be attached for detection of DNA hybridization, antibody cascading or prototypical biotin–streptavidin interaction.236 However, the drift in effective optical thickness and the effect of interfering complex matrices from the processes reduce the biosensor performance. Further, corrosion of the pSi layer induces a profound, irreversible change to porosity, pore size. An interferometric biosensor featuring two stacked pSi layers of different pore size (Fig. 8E) have been used to relieve this problem.6 The inner layer serves as reference layer, and the reflectance spectra from the double-layer sensor contains three superimposed interference patterns that provide independent information of the binding, adsorption or partitioning events that occur in these layers. To further improve sensitivity, the design of Bragg reflectors,241 microcavities235,242 and rugate structures are built up on pSi multilayers. Sailor's group introduced a pSi photonic multilayer hydrophobized by methylation of micropores, which restricts entry of large biomolecules and only allows protease to be detected.243 The photonic crystal takes advantage of the color changes as a sensitive probe of protease activity. Amounts of protease as small as a few picomoles in a 1 μL aliquot are detected. Currently, colorimetric assays require a spectrophotometer, and they must use 100–500 μL aliquots to obtain comparable detection limits (7 pmol or 240 ng for pepsin). However, the chemical stability and reproducibility of pSi materials are still key issues for biosensor applications.
4.6. Drug delivery
The TNTs have excellent biocompatibility, thermal and chemical stability, controllable dimensions, tunable surface chemistry and high surface-to-volume ratio.159,244 These advantages render the material favorable for bone cell growth, cell differentiation, and apatite-forming abilities as well as ideal platforms for drug delivery to assist tissue regeneration.244 A major problem is uncontrolled release of drugs from the porous structure when the drug is filled into porous network or nanotubes (i.e. titanium implant, bone-filling material). Thus, providing a controlled and sustained pattern with uniform drug elution vs. time is an objective of novel drug delivery approaches.244 Although the TNT pore diameters and lengths are reasonable parameters to control the drug release rate, the methods suffer from considerable limitation where a sustained drug release is required.244–250
A series of optical, electrical, thermal and chemical techniques have been applied to regulate drug release pattern in an accurate manner. The underlying principle of TNT-based drug release is that UV light and/or bias voltage,249 X-ray250 excites the electron–hole pairs in the semiconducting TiO2. The charge carriers are then ejected to the surrounding electrolyte and create reactive redox species. Namely, valence band holes transferred to water electrolytes have a sufficient energy to produce OH˙ radicals. These radicals trigger the scission of attached hydrocarbon chains, and thus liberate terminal payloads. This release approach is almost unique to TiO2 because of relative position of the TiO2 valence band and the water redox levels.
The concept of hydrophobic caps on hydrophilic TNTs gives a possibility of controllable drug delivery, as shown in Fig. 8F.159 The hydrophobic cap prevents uncontrolled leaching of hydrophilic drug into an aqueous environment. The TNTs loaded with polymeric micelles (Pluronic F127) are drug nanocarrier and polymer coating of drug loaded TNT is biodegradable (chitosan). A rate of drug delivery is improved from 77% to 39% and extended overall release time from 7 days to more than 28 days.244,251 This release pattern is useful in bone implant therapies that require a large initial dose followed by a prolonged maintenance dose over a few weeks.
Temperature-responsive controlled drug delivery has been studied by introducing composite PNIPAAm–PAAm hydrogel onto titanium nanotubes as a sealing cap for the open nanotubes.252 Drug delivery from the composite hydrogel coated TNT at 25 °C displays the lowest release profile, only around 20% loaded drug released after 8 days immersion in phosphate buffered saline solution, since the composite hydrogel is in a swollen state at this temperature. Upon the temperature increasing around (38 °C), higher than the LCST (lower critical solution temperature, 32–34 °C) of composite hydrogel, the composite hydrogel is in a collapsed state to allow drug release from titanium nanotubes, displaying much higher release profiles than that of composite hydrogel coated one at 25 °C.
With all the nanotube/porous materials, a long-term goal is to harness their optical, electronic, magnetic and chemical properties that can allow the drug carriers to home into diseased tissues such as tumors and then perform various tasks (detecting, identifying, imaging, etc.) in vivo.
5. Summary
We have reviewed the general strategies and recent progress of engineering hollow nanostructures by electrochemical pulse/step techniques. Particularly, we focus our discussions on four essential problems that dictate the performance of this technique: (i) surface pre-texturing, (ii) enhancing uniformity, (iii) vertical patterning and (iv) free-standing membranes. Many valuable experimental results are demonstrated and these results include the involvement of pre-texturing by initial anodization or fast pulse anodization to improve pore uniformity. Various hollow nanostructures such as layered, bamboo-type, branched or multi-ordered nanostructures as well as free-standing membranes are observed. The successful creation of these nanostructures will enable us to better control the local electrochemical environment, and will be helpful to deepen the comprehension of nanostructural formation mechanism. Due to excellent optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties built-in behind these morphological complexities, a special interest focusing on applications in energy, environmental and biological area are described. The current application status and prospects of such nanostructures in solar cells and water splitting, organic degradation and nanoengineering templates, biosensors and drug release are highlighted. The present work will be of interest to those who investigate hollow structured nanomaterials and will spur more inspirations on translation of the nanomaterials into real-world devices.
