    , Accepted 2nd April 2013First published on 3rd April 2013AbstractThe waste ashes from a commercial biomass combustion facility are successfully converted into mesoporous structured silica utilising a biorefinery approach, with potential high value applications in catalysis, adsorption and separation processes. Potassium silicate solutions are formed via a simple hydrothermal extraction of miscanthus bottom ashes, rich in amorphous silica, with a reproducible extraction of 60–70%. The extension and validation of a rapid and facile infrared method for the quantification of the silicate solutions is demonstrated with important industrial applications for continuous online screening and tuning of the silicate solution ratio and concentration. The alkali solutions from the waste ashes are used for the formation of a structured high surface area mesoporous silica, MCM-41 (1043 m2 g−1, 1.12 cm3 g−1). The resulting mesoporous silica was analysed by XRD, N2 adsorption porosimetry and TEM.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade the large-scale combustion of agricultural residues such as straws and grasses has received significant research, commercial and governmental attention, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable power generation utilising indigenous biomass.1,2 Drax Power Station, the largest in the UK, is currently converting to take half of its fuel from biomass whilst it is estimated that across Europe the primary production of heat and power from biomass could double to 2000 TWh by 2020.3 It is predicted that 2/3 of this energy production increase will come from energy crops and agricultural residues, using around 130 million tonnes annually from biomass such as miscanthus and wheat straw.3 Irrigation and fertiliser usage in the growth of these herbaceous plants leads to higher contents of inorganic species, compared to wood or coal, with ash contents of between 3–12 wt%.4,5 The commercial combustion of this biomass will result in the production of significant quantities of new waste: biomass fly ash and bottom ash, which could be in the region of 4–15.6 million tonnes annually from energy crops and agricultural residues in Europe alone. The recovery and reuse of the inorganic species from these ashes would be a valuable addition to a biorefinery, both economically and in the context of elemental sustainability.6,7
Despite bottom ashes being the largest contributor to the deposits in commercial combustion units, the vast majority of research on biomass ashes has studied the use of fly ashes as fertilisers or soil amendments.5,8 The most frequently cited applications for combustion bottom ashes are in construction, by partly replacing cement or as an aggregate in road building. However, landfilling is currently the primary disposal method for biomass combustion residues.9,10 Nevertheless, biomass ashes have been widely used in the past for soap production and glass making.11
The main components of biomass ashes are silicates, carbonates, chlorides, sulfates and phosphates.5 Typically, there is a fractionation of the elements between the fly ash and the bottom ash during the combustion of herbaceous biomass, dependent on the volatility of the elements. Potassium, chlorine, sulfur, sodium and phosphorus are enriched in the fly ash, whilst the bottom ash is predominantly composed of silica.12 This indicates that the bottom ashes could be used for forming silicate solutions by alkaline extraction with the use of these solutions to produce a higher value end-product. Research on rice hulls, rich in silica, has demonstrated the potential for producing silicate solutions by alkaline extraction of the hulls, pyrolysed, combusted or gasified below 800 °C.13 More recently, research has demonstrated the potential for the direct formation of potassium silicate solutions from wheat straw ashes using their inherent alkalinity.14 However, these studies were carried out on ashes produced at the laboratory-scale and were combusted at lower temperatures than typically used in commercial power plants.
Silicate solutions or ‘waterglass’ are a major bulk commodity, conventionally formed via the fusion of sand and alkali carbonate at temperatures above 1100–1200 °C. A large amount of energy is used during this process and there are environmental issues associated with the extraction of sand from mining or dredging, as well as the release of CO2 due to carbonate decomposition further providing interest in the use of combustion ashes. Alkali silicates are used for a wide variety of applications including as a binder, in cements, in detergents and for the manufacture of catalysts and catalyst supports.15 One such catalyst support, MCM-41, is part of a family of mesoporous silica first synthesised in 1992.16,17 This material, with its high surface area, well defined short range ordered hexagonal pore structure, adjustable pore size and high stability, has proven useful in many applications such as shape selective catalysis, adsorption and separation.18–20 Recent research has been interested in introducing eco-design into the field of sol–gel chemistry for materials such as MCMs.21 Researchers have demonstrated the potential for forming MCM-41 from coal fly ash under ambient or high pressure and high temperature conditions,22,23 from gasified rice husk ash for adsorption of chlorinated VOCs and as a support for CO2 adsorption,24,25 or from electronic waste using the waste as a source for both the silica and cationic surfactant.26 However, there is a lack of studies looking at biomass ashes from commercial power stations.
Miscanthus is one of the two main dedicated energy crops growing in the UK.27 It is a perennial C4 herbaceous grass and due to its high yields, hardiness and efficient solar energy conversion and use of water and nitrogen, has been widely touted as a future major bioenergy resource.28 Within England the planting of miscanthus is encouraged through the Energy Crops Scheme resulting in nearly 7500 ha of miscanthus being planted between 2000–2011. Some recent work has studied the effects of inorganic species within the fuel on the lab-scale combustion of miscanthus and the composition of the ash formed,27 however, to the best of our knowledge no previous work has studied the valorisation of ash from a commercial herbaceous biomass grate-fired combustion facility.
Miscanthus generally has an ash content at the lower end of herbaceous biomass resources, particularly when it is harvested following senescence in late winter or early spring which enables the remobilisation of nutrients, including nitrogen and potassium, which are sequestered in the rhizome.29 This results in a fuel with lower quantities of the elements that can cause slagging and fouling problems during combustion and, by returning nutrients into the rhizome, reduces the quantities of fertiliser that needs to be applied.27 Therefore studies of miscanthus combustion residues are of interest due to both their potential as a major bioenergy resource and their unique ash composition differing from the more widely studied coal, wood and cereal straw ashes. Trials at Ely Power Station in the UK, the largest dedicated straw power station in the world, demonstrated the potential for the combustion of miscanthus together with cereal straws.30 In total 7.2 wt% of the initial fuel remained as ash with 86 wt% deposited as bottom ash and 14 wt% as fly ash. However, the composition of the ashes were not analysed and the sole combustion of miscanthus was not studied.
Herein, we study the elemental and mineralogical composition of ashes from the commercial combustion of miscanthus at Ely Power Station. Based on the elemental composition of the bottom ashes formed we demonstrate the direct production of alkali silicate solutions and their use for the formation of structured silicas. In the process of this investigation the need for a simple, accurate method for the quantification of the silica extracted was identified. The application of a quick and simple infrared technique first suggested by Falcone et al. is expanded and validated.31 This work therefore demonstrates the potential to synthesise high value mesoporous silica from low value biomass waste ashes using simple environmentally benign techniques and minimal synthetic reagents.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Ash collection
Samples (2 × 10 L of each) of bottom ash and fly ash were collected following combustion of miscanthus straw bales at Ely Power Station in May 2010 (Fig. 1). At this time the only biomass being combusted was miscanthus. Some minor remnants of the previous combustion of wheat and barley straw may remain. In order to obtain representative samples, before analysis and extraction bottom ash samples were mixed, dried at 105 °C and ground in a Retsch PM400 ball mill until the ash passed through a <125 μm sieve. Fly ash samples were mixed and analysed directly. Potassium silicate (K53, K78 and K120) and three sodium silicate (C501, C503, C75) solutions of various concentrations and molar ratios were obtained from PQ Corporation.

2.2. Ash and elemental analysis
The inorganic content and moisture content of the ground ash were obtained on a Netzsch 409 Simultaneous Thermal Analyser (STA). Samples (150 mg) were accurately weighed into a dry and clean porcelain cup, heated at 10 K min−1 from 20 °C to 550 °C under 150 mL min−1 air and 50 mL min−1 N2 and held until no further mass loss was observed. The moisture content was calculated as the percentage mass loss between 0–120 °C and the remaining organic content as the mass loss between 120–550 °C.
Elemental analyses of the ashes were carried out by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) at Sheffield Hallam University. The ground ashes were fused with lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7) in a 10:1 ratio and the cooled flux was studied for all the major oxides. Evaluation of the mineralogical phases present was carried out using a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) with a Kristalloflex 760 X-ray generator producing monochromatic Kα X-rays from a copper source. The finely ground sample was levelled with scans taken across the range 5–80 2θ over 14 minutes with a 45 kV voltage and 20 mA current.
2.3. Silica extraction
Ground bottom ash was added to a potassium hydroxide solution of the required concentration (1–10 M). A 1:5 wt:vol ratio was used for initial extraction tests with a 3:5 wt:vol ratio used for repeated extractions and kinetic tests. The mixture was heated in a Teflon round-bottomed flask with stirring under reflux for 24 h and then separated by centrifuging for 30 min at 4000 rpm. The clear supernatant was decanted and stored in a sealed propylene bottle for further analysis.
2.4. Analysis of silicate solutions
Infrared absorption spectra were recorded on neat samples using a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a MKII Golden Gate Single Reflection ATR System with a 45° diamond crystal. The resultant spectra were analysed using Bruker OPUS software, with integration of the silicate band area calculated between 1250–650 cm−1.
Silicon concentrations were determined using a Hitachi Z5300 Polarised Zeeman Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) with reference to the 251.6 nm spectral emission generated by a hollow cathode Si lamp in the presence of a high temperature burner and a combined nitrous oxide-acetylene flame under stoichiometric conditions. Flow rates were generally 5.6 L min−1 C2H2, 6.2 L min−1 N2O with a 7.5 mm burner height and 12 mA lamp current. Calibrations were carried out using an Aldrich Si AAS Standard (1000 ppm). Silicate solutions were serially diluted in volumetric flasks to the required concentration with freshly distilled water. Each sample was run in duplicate and the average obtained.
2.5. Formation of MCM-41
Commercial PQ Corporation K120 silicate solution and biosilicate formed from miscanthus bottom ash were both used for the formation MCM-41. The procedure followed the green method of Hui et al. with some modifications based on the silica content of the solutions.23 All steps were carried out at atmospheric pressure. K120 (1.64 ml) or biosilicate solutions (3.91 ml) was mixed with CTAB (1 g) and distilled water (40 ml) at 85 °C. Ethyl acetate (3.1 ml), the hydrolysing agent, was added to this mixture which was rapidly stirred for 10 minutes. The solution was left to cool to room temperature. An aliquot (10 ml) of the reaction mixture was then adjusted to the required pH with concentrated H2SO4 or concentrated NaOH and left to age at room temperature for 24 h. The ensuing precipitate was filtered, washed with water (10 ml), dried (2 h at 100 °C) and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. The resultant sample was stored in a sealed propylene bottle prior to further analysis.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was carried out using a FEI Tecnai 12 BioTWIN G2 transmission electron microscope with a SIS CCD camera. The sample (1 mg) was suspended in ethanol before being placed onto a formvar coated copper grid for analysis.
Evaluation of the short range order of the MCM-41 materials was carried out using XRD as described earlier. Nitrogen adsorption measurements were carried out at 77 K using a Micromeritics Tristar Porosimeter. Prior to analysis, the finely ground sample was outgassed at 180 °C for 8 h under a flow of nitrogen.
3. Results and discussion
Both the fly and bottom ash were analysed to determine their moisture content, remaining organic content and their elemental composition (Table 1, further details in ESI Table S1†). As collected, the bottom ash was wet from direct water quenching. Visual inspection of the ash showed that it consisted of mainly 1–2 cm-sized pieces of fused aggregate. The powder formed following grinding and homogenisation of the bottom ashes was dark grey, whilst the fly ashes were lower in density, finer and darker. Although grinding can be energy intensive, the rate of silica extraction is substantially enhanced on pulverisation of the aggregates. As such, the benefits of grinding the material are expected to considerably outweigh the necessary energy expenditure, although future work should assess this in detail. Some unburnt carbon was present in both types of ash.

Elemental analyses of the ashes show that, as observed for other fuels, a fractionation of the elements between the fly and bottom ash occurs, dependent on the volatility of the elements (Table 1). Potassium, chlorine, sulfur, sodium and phosphorus are enriched in the fly ash, whilst the majority of the silica is captured in the bottom ash, dominating its composition. Calcium is distributed between both ashes. The silica, potassium and chlorine contents found in the ashes are within the range of those found following the combustion of whole miscanthus on a laboratory-scale.27
Mineralogical analysis showed that the fly ash was mainly composed of sylvite (KCl). This has frequently been found to be the major phase in fly ashes from other power plants combusting both woody and herbaceous fuels.32 Meanwhile, the bottom ash is primarily composed of cristobalite. There is a broad halo between 20–45° 2θ which indicates the presence of less structured, more amorphous components. Limited data is available on the mineral composition of the bottom ashes of different biomass materials from commercial power plants.
3.1. Development of analytical methodology
Based on the composition of the miscanthus bottom ashes they were tested for the production of alkali silicate solutions by alkaline extraction with the aim of using these for the formation of structured silicas. In addition, there was future interest in the direct formation of silicate solutions using the inherent alkalinity within the fly ashes, therefore potassium hydroxide was used as the leaching agent. Previous work on wheat straw ash on a laboratory scale had shown that direct formation of alkali silicate solutions from the ashes was feasible at low temperatures.14 However, under the harsh industrial furnace conditions used in this study, alkaline species are likely to be volatilised and concentrated in the fly ashes. This was confirmed by ambient aqueous extraction of both the bottom and fly ashes, which gave solutions with a pH of 11.2 and 13.6 respectively.
Key to an analysis of extraction efficiency is accurate knowledge of the silica concentration in the silicate solutions. However, typical methods for the analysis of alkali silicate solutions are time-consuming and can require a large quantity of solution. Recently Falcone et al. reported the use of ATR-FTIR to determine the silica concentration of pure sodium silicate solutions based on the relative area of the silicate bands (1250–719 cm−1).33 However, Falcone et al. only studied sodium silicate solutions and did not validate their method for solutions with SiO2 concentrations below 9 wt%. This paper, therefore, establishes the validity of ATR-FTIR method for potassium silicate solutions in particular and at low concentrations, and tests its application for the study of silicate solutions derived from various concentrations for three commercial potassium- (K53, K78 and K120) and sodium-silicate (C501, C503, C75) solutions, differing in silica to alkali ratios, which were prepared and analysed by ATR-IR based on the method of Falcone et al.33 The relative area associated with the silicate bands was correlated to the silicon concentration of each solution as analysed by AAS. The resultant comparison reveals a strong linear correlation (R2 0.99) between the Si concentration, as determined by AAS, and the area associated with the silicate bands for each individual potassium- and sodium-silicate solution (latter not shown) over the entire concentration range (Fig. 2a). The linear regression does not pass through the origin as water is not subtracted from the spectra, however, the trend is linear with respect to the integration of distilled water. There are small variations in the slopes of the linear trends for each individual silicate solution, particularly for the K120 solution, which causes a divergence in the silicate band area at higher silica concentrations. However, no correlation could be found between the changing linear relationship and the molar ratio of the solution. Nevertheless, when the data for all of the potassium- and sodium-silicate solutions are combined (Fig. 2b), the area of the peak remains strongly correlated with the solution concentration and is independent of solution ratio and metal cation over the entire concentration range studied.
 Fig. 2  Correlation between the Si concentration of silicate solutions analysed by AAS and the area of the silicate band in their IR spectra for three individual potassium silicate solutions (a) and sodium and potassium silicate solutions combined (b). 
This data indicates that using the IR integral is a valid and rapid method for the analysis of the silicon concentration of both sodium- and potassium-silicate solutions of different molar ratios. The method appears to be best utilised for dilutions of an individual solution with a specific molar ratio. However, the linear relationship still remains robust when samples with a wide range of solids concentrations and molar ratios are used, particularly at lower concentrations. This simple and quick technique could be highly valuable at an industrial scale, enabling the direct online control and analysis of silicate production and enabling the tuning of the extraction without time consuming analytical methodologies.
3.2. Silicate extractions from miscanthus bottom ash
Initial experiments using varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide solution demonstrated the potential for forming alkali silicate solutions from miscanthus bottom ashes (MBA) (Fig. 3). The IR spectra are typical of low ratio alkali silicate solutions (low SiO2:K2O). A broad vibrational band is observed between 1250 and 700 cm−1 comprising of a strong band centred around 1000 cm−1 characteristic of the asymmetric Si–O–Si stretching vibration and lower frequency shoulders which increase in intensity with increasing potassium hydroxide concentration due to the presence of smaller silicate anions or changes in hydrogen bonding.31,34 Analysis of the solutions indicates that 70–80% of the silica in the bottom ashes can be extracted via this method using alkaline solutions above 3 M. Comparison of the extraction by Si AAS analysis and the IR peak integration method show the same extraction trend with increasing alkali concentration (see inset in Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  IR spectra of silicate solutions formed by the extraction of miscanthus-rich bottom ash using different concentrations of KOH. A comparison of the IR peak area and the Si concentration analysed by AAS is shown inset. 
Based on these initial results the required quantities of bottom ash and KOH were calculated for the formation of a solution with an equivalent ratio to the commercial K120 solution, although the maximum total solids content used was lower than that of the K120 solution due to the difficulty of efficient stirring of the solution at higher solid:liquid ratios.
A comparison between the silica concentration of the biosilicate solution by ATR-IR and AAS using the initial extraction tests along with the data from the commercial solutions to obtain the linear correlation equation (R2 = 0.97) were made. This demonstrated that the former method accurately determined the silica concentration, with a difference between the analytical techniques of 1.8% over five extractions, with this error comparable to those present using other methods.33 The results demonstrate a good reproducibility in terms of the silica extraction (64.2 ± 5.1 wt%, 9 extractions). Analysis of the residue, following alkaline extraction of the ashes, further supports the elemental analyses of the solutions with a similar level of silica extraction (63.7 wt%) to that found by ATR-IR and AAS analysis of the solution. The lower levels of silica extracted compared to the initial tests may be due to inefficient stirring as a results of the higher initial solid:liquid ratios used. Observations showed that the ash became hydrated during the reaction with a large amount of black sludge formed as the reaction progressed.
Two of the silicate solutions were analysed by ICP-AES to determine the content of minor elements. The compositions of the solutions were highly reproducible showing the overwhelming predominance of potassium (62.2 ± 0.3 wt%) and silicon (34.4 ± 0.3 wt%). Significant quantities of phosphorus (2.2 wt%) and sulfur (0.69%) were also observed, both of which were also major components in the initial ash. Other elements including calcium, aluminium, magnesium and sodium were only present at levels of a few or tens of ppm. The levels of all potentially toxic elements were below the limit of detection or below the levels required for instance by the Swedish Forestry Agency for the application of biomass ashes to soils (ESI Table S2†).35 The purity of the solutions formed, with respect to the initial composition of the ash, could be vital for its use in a variety of applications, especially for forming catalyst supports.

3.2.1. Effect of time. 
A kinetic study on the extraction of the miscanthus bottom ash was carried out using the same experimental conditions as for experiments MBA 1–8. Due to the high temperature of the extraction, large inaccuracies occurred when samples were taken immediately from the reaction vessel and directly analysed by ATR-IR. Therefore, each measurement corresponds to a separate sample, rapidly cooled before analysis. The results indicate that there is a rapid rise in silica dissolution over the first few hours, with the maximum extraction occurring after 8 h and remaining consistent following this period within experimental error (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  IR spectra of silicate solutions formed during the extraction of miscanthus bottom ash over 24 h. The change in the silicate peak area from ATR-IR with extraction time is shown inset. 
There are clearly differences in the silicate bands and silicate species present as dissolution progresses. At the lowest SiO2:K2O ratio (1 h) the main bands in the IR spectra are found at 986, 927 and 822 cm−1, similar to those present using a 5, 7.5 or 10 M KOH solution (Fig. 3). As the extraction progresses, and the SiO2:K2O ratio increases, the overall silicate band increases in intensity, a high frequency shoulder at 1100 cm−1 develops, the main peak shifts to higher wavenumber (994 cm−1, 24 h), the bands at 927 and 822 cm−1 reduce in intensity, whilst a new band at 880 cm−1 appears. This process appears to be gradual with the spectra of the solution formed after 4 h displaying all of these peaks. With regard to previous studies into the relationship between IR spectra and silicate solutions this suggests that initially monomeric anions with a low dissociation of the K+ counter-ion are extracted into solution.31,34,36 As the extraction progresses increasing dissociation of the anion occurs as the ratio of SiO2:K2O increases, eventually leading to the formation of larger anionic species evidenced by the shoulder around 1100 cm−1.34

3.3. Characterisation of MCM-41 materials
A biosilicate solution from the extraction of miscanthus bottom ash (MBA) was used to test the formation of porous MCM-41 materials. X-Ray Diffraction patterns are shown for samples synthesised from both the commercial K120 and MBA silicate solutions (Fig. 5). Although neither sample showed long range order, they did exhibit short range order, which is consistent with the materials being mesoporous, and is apparent from peaks in the low angle region of the diffraction pattern.17 The materials formed both display peaks at 2θ values characteristic of MCM-41 materials (Fig. 5), indicating that this structured silica had indeed been formed using both sources of silicate solutions.16 However, all of the peaks for the MBA-MCM-41 sample appear to have slightly higher 2θ values indicating a smaller unit cell was formed in comparison to K120-MCM-41.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of K120-MCM-41 and MBA-MCM-41 following calcination. 
Porosimetry results calculated from N2 adsorption (Table 2) show that the MCM-41 synthesised from both silicate solutions possess high surface areas (approximately 1000 m2 g−1), pore volumes of around 1 cm3 g−1 and average pore diameters of around 4 nm, similar to or greater than those found in the literature.16,23

The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms both have a Type IV classification confirming that the silicas display mesoporosity (Fig. 6). Both isotherms show a Type B or H4 hysteresis loop where the desorption branch remains above the adsorbed branch over a wide range of p/po which is associated with narrow mesopores open at both ends.37 TEM images (Fig. 6) provide evidence that the samples both contain hexagonal arrays and uniform pores comparable to MCM-41 synthesised from conventional silicates described in the literature.25 Thus the synthesis of mesoporous MCM-41 proved to be successful and was not affected by a change in the silicate source. The levels of impurities extracted into the solutions were found to be low (ESI Table S2†), with the majority of those present not expected to be incorporated into the silica framework. However, purification of the MCM-41 if necessary could be achieved via acid leaching,13 with future work needed to assess whether the change in the silica source affects the application of the MCM-41.

4. Conclusions
These results demonstrate that it is possible to successfully synthesise a high value mesoporous silica sieve from low value biomass waste ashes using simple environmentally benign techniques and minimal synthetic reagents. These bio-MCM-41 materials are expected to be useful in many different applications including shape selective catalysis, gas and liquid absorption, and separation. There are also emerging possibilities for the benign design of active metal loaded catalysts using ashes from plants which have taken up metals from the ground during their lifetime which then remain present in the extracted silicate solutions and further into the catalyst itself. The direct formation of the alkali silicate solutions using the alkalinity of the fly ashes is also being tested to create an integrated process entirely using waste sources.
