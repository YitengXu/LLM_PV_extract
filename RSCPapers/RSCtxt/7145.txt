    , Accepted 30th July 2020First published on 5th August 2020AbstractOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a topic of significant research interest in the field of renewable energy as well as organic electronics. The crucial issue in OPVs is the improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addressing this issue, one of the most important factors is the photon energy loss (Eloss), which is defined as the difference between the bandgap of the materials and the energy corresponding to the open-circuit voltage. Typically, the Eloss for OPVs is considerably larger than that for inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics, which has prevented OPVs from generating larger photovoltages. In parallel, reducing the Eloss for OPVs causes a loss of driving-force energy for charge generation, which is detrimental to the generation of photocurrent. Thus, OPVs have been facing a trade-off between photocurrent and photovoltage. However, a number of recently developed π-conjugated materials for use as p-type and n-type organic semiconductors have been shown to enable small Eloss values that are close to those for inorganic systems, simultaneously with efficient charge generation. Here, we summarize recent progress in π-conjugated polymers and molecules that enable small Eloss and high PCE at the same time. We hope that this review will be of help to chemists and materials scientists who are involved in the design of materials and blends with an eye toward highly efficient OPVs.Masahiko SaitoMasahiko Saito received his Ph.D from Hiroshima University in 2015.

1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a topic of significant research interest in the field of renewable energy owing to their solution processability, lightweight nature, and flexibility.1,2 The photoactive layer of the OPV cell is composed of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors (electron donor and acceptor materials, respectively) that are blended together to form a bulk heterojunction film.1,3–6 Typically, π-conjugated polymers are employed as the p-type semiconductor in combination with π-conjugated molecules, such as fullerene7 and non-fullerene derivatives,8 or π-conjugated polymers9 as the n-type semiconductor. Owing to the considerable effort in the development of those organic semiconductors,10–19 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for OPVs have made significant advances to more than 17%:20–23 the long-standing milestone of 10% PCE is no longer a rarity.
The PCEs for OPVs, however, remain low relative to those for silicon (∼25%)24,25 and perovskite (∼25%)21,26 photovoltaics (PVs). The foremost reason for this is the significant loss of the voltage, originating in the loss of energy during the photoconversion process, which is called photon energy loss (Eloss) or simply energy loss. The Eloss is defined as the difference between the bandgap (Eg) of the material and the energy corresponding to the open-circuit voltage (VOC) for the photovoltaic cell, Eloss = Eg − qVOC (or eVOC), where both q and e are elementary charge,27,28i.e., the difference between the incident photon (input) energy and the output energy. Note that the Eloss can also be expressed as the voltage loss (Vloss): Vloss = Eg/q − VOC. The Eloss for high-efficiency OPVs, specifically polymer/fullerene systems, had been typically more than 0.7 eV.27,29,30 This is considerably larger than those for silicon (∼0.4 eV)24,28 and perovskite (∼0.4 eV)21,31 PVs. Thus, the large Eloss had been a critical disadvantage in producing a high VOC and a fundamental issue that must be resolved for further PCE improvement in OPVs. Fortunately, however, recent efforts in the development of new organic semiconductor materials and optimization of their blends have brought about remarkable reduction of the Eloss down to ∼0.5 eV (Fig. 1a), which is much smaller than the value of 0.6 eV that was suggested as the minimum Eloss for OPV to exhibit a certain level of performance.27 Moreover, although there has been a trade-off between the Eloss and the external quantum efficiency (EQE), where the EQE significantly decreases when the Eloss is decreased32 as will be described in depth below, the state-of-the-art OPV devices can now give high EQEs of around 80% at Elosss of around 0.5 eV, consequently resulting in high PCEs of >17% (Fig. 1b and c).

In this review, we first describe the origin of Eloss and the issues for the Eloss reduction, and then summarize organic semiconductor systems that enable small Eloss for OPVs. We discuss the topic by classifying into polymer/fullerene and polymer/non-fullerene systems. In the polymer/fullerene section, fullerene derivatives and narrow-bandgap p-type π-conjugated polymers are described, and in the polymer/non-fullerene section, wide-bandgap n-type π-conjugated molecules, narrow-bandgap π-conjugated molecules along with wide-bandgap p-type π-conjugated polymers that match these non-fullerene systems, and n-type π-conjugated polymers are presented. Although the current benchmark for “small Eloss” for OPVs would probably be 0.6 eV, we do not limit the materials systems discussed herein to this value. Rather, we focus on how the research on this topic has advanced from the perspective of materials development and discuss what materials and blends tend to have small Elosss simultaneously with high PCEs. We hope that this review will be of help to chemists and materials scientists in this area in the further design of high-performance π-conjugated materials for OPVs.
2. Origin of photon energy loss (Eloss) and issues for Eloss reduction
The origin of the large Eloss for OPVs can be understood by considering the working principle. Fig. 2a shows the energy level diagrams of pairs of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors.33 It is widely accepted that the OPV cell undergoes efficient charge generation only when there is a certain amount of offset in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) (Fig. 2a, left) or the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) (Fig. 2a, right) between the p-type and n-type organic semiconductors (ΔEL or ΔEH). Note that one would consider the offset energy as ΔEL or ΔEH when the p-type or n-type organic semiconductor is the narrower bandgap material, respectively. The offset energy is thought to be the driving-force energy to overcome the binding energy of an electron–hole pair in the excitons generated by photoexcitation of the p-type and/or n-type organic semiconductors, respectively, and are reported to be typically more than 0.3 eV.34–36 In parallel, the offset energy will be lost in the charge generation process, thereby accounting for one of the factors for the Eloss. In sharp contrast, as inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics directly generate free charge carriers immediately after the photon absorption because excitons can be spontaneously dissociated into free charge carriers even at room temperature owing to the large dielectric constants, they do not require such driving-force energy for charge generation.37 Thus, it is clear that the offset energy is an additional factor for the Eloss that is unique to OPVs. As a result, whereas the VOC for inorganic and perovskite systems is determined on the basis of the Eg of the semiconductor material, the VOC for OPVs is determined on the basis of the energy between the HOMO of the p-type and the LUMO of the n-type (ΔEHL), which is considered as the effective bandgap of the blend and is smaller than the Eg of both organic semiconductors, leading to lower VOCs.
 Fig. 2  (a) Energy level diagrams of pairs of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors and the working principle of OPVs, when the p-type material has a narrower bandgap (Eg) (left) and the n-type material has a narrower Eg (right). (b) Relationship between the input energy (Eg) and the energy of output voltage including the factors of voltage loss and VOC for inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics. Note that VB and CB are valence band and conduction band, respectively, and VSQ is the maximum voltage based on the SQ limit and Vr is the upper limit of the photovoltage when only the loss due to radiative recombination is present.53,54 (c) Relationship between the input energy based on the state energy (Jablonski) diagram of an organic semiconductor blend and output voltage energy for OPV. qVr,CT and qVr are the radiative recombination loss based on ECT and Eg, respectively. (b and c) Note that voltage loss due to current (JSC) loss is typically negligibly small and hence is ignored for simplicity here (see the ESI†). 
The Eloss can also be described by using a state energy diagram (Fig. 2b and c). Eloss can mainly be classified into two categories, which are two recombination losses originating in radiative and non-radiative recombinations (qΔVr and qΔVnr). Note that whereas in the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory,38–40Eloss is assumed to be only due to qΔVr, which can be calculated by using a step-function absorption where absorptance is zero below Eg and unity above Eg, in the real PV devices, Eloss consists of both qΔVr and qΔVnr. It is also noted that there is an additional energy loss factor due to the decrease in the short-circuit current (JSC), which is often ignored since this is generally negligibly small (see the ESI†) and thus is not described in this paper as well. Fig. 2b shows the relationship among the input energy (Eg), output voltage energy (qVOC), and loss energy (Eloss) for inorganic and perovskite PVs, in which Eloss is mainly due to qΔVr and qΔVnr (Eloss = qΔVr + qΔVnr). In addition, qΔVr is further classified into losses above and below Eg (qΔVr1 and qΔVr2) because of additional absorption below Eg.38–40 On the other hand, the relationship among Eg, qVOC, and Eloss for OPVs can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 2c. A striking difference from the inorganic systems is that the charge transfer (CT) state, being formed at the p/n interface,41,42 must be taken into consideration for Eloss.22 The energy of the CT state (ECT) is lower than that of the singlet exciton or singlet excited (S1) state (ES1) of the system, so that the excitons can be efficiently converted into free charge carriers. Therefore, Eloss can be expressed as Eloss = ΔE + qΔVr,CT + qΔVnr, where ΔE is the energy difference between ES1 and ECT, thus being regarded as the loss due to charge transfer, and qΔVr,CT is the loss due to the radiative recombination.43 Note that as the ES1 and ECT are qualitatively equal to the narrower Eg of the two organic semiconductors and the ΔEHL, respectively,44 ΔE is qualitatively equal to ΔEL or ΔEH, i.e., the driving-force energy for charge generation. Consequently, the Eloss for OPV is larger than that for inorganic and perovskite PVs due to ΔE being lost at the CT process. We should also note that radiative recombination losses qΔVr and qΔVr,CT shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively, is different. The qΔVr is the radiative loss based on Eg, which is dependent only on Eg, while the qΔVr,CT is radiative loss based on ECT, which is dependent not only on ECT but also on ΔE: qΔVr,CT decreases with the increase in ΔE (see the ESI†). In addition, as shown in Fig. 2c, the Eloss in OPVs can also be explained without using ΔE in the same way as in inorganic and perovskite PVs, where the radiative loss is considered as the loss based on Eg, thus shown as qΔVr, and is classified into the loss above and below Eg (qΔVr1 and qΔVr2). In this case, the CT absorption is considered as an additional absorption below Eg, which is typically much larger than that of the absorption tail for inorganic and perovskite PVs. Thus, qΔVr2 is larger in OPVs than in inorganic and perovskite solar cells while qΔVr1 is similar, resulting in larger radiative loss and in turn Eloss.
Given the mechanism and the loss factors of OPVs discussed above, it is clear that reducing the offset energy, ΔEL or ΔEH ≈ ΔE, by tuning the energy level of the materials is essential to minimize the Eloss for OPVs. However, reduction of the offset energy implies loss of the driving-force energy for charge generation, which gives rise to low EQEs and thus to low JSCs, which are rather detrimental to the PCE improvement, although results in high VOCs. Thus, there is a clear trade-off between Eloss and efficient charge generation, or more simply, between VOC and JSC. In fact, when data from a range of polymer/fullerene systems were collected, the EQE as well as PCE was found to decrease with the decrease in the Eloss (Fig. 1b and c, blue dots). Note that, however, recent studies have shown that even with the Eloss of less than 0.6 eV that had been suggested for the minimum value, some particular polymer/fullerene systems can undergo efficient charge generation, resulting in relatively high EQEs of >60%.29,30,32 More recently, the use of non-fullerenes as the n-type organic semiconductors was found to provide even higher EQEs of reaching 80% with similarly small Elosss (Fig. 1b, red dots).45,46 In addition, some polymer/polymer (all-polymer) cells were also reported to show high EQEs of ∼80% with Elosss of less than 0.6 eV, though the number is limited (Fig. 1b, green dots).
With respect to the loss factor due to the non-radiative recombination, qΔVnr, it is expressed as −kBT ln(EQEEL), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and EQEEL is EQE of electroluminescence (EL) of the photovoltaic cell. Thus, a photovoltaic cell as a good light-emitting diode shows small qΔVnr.47,48 In general, OPV cells show qΔVnr of ∼0.4 eV, which is larger than ∼0.2 eV for silicon and perovskite photovoltaics, originating in the fact that the active layer is composed of a heterojunction of two different materials and thus CT emission is dominant. However, it is reported that the blend systems with a small ΔE show relatively high EQEEL and thus small qΔVnr values below 0.3 eV.49 This is likely because the contribution of the emission from S1 state become larger when ΔE is small, that is, ES1 and ECT are close. More specifically, the local excitation (LE) and CT states would be hybridized, which results in enhancement of EQEEL as the oscillator strength of the S1 state is generally fairly larger than that of the CT state.49–52 Overall, minimizing ΔE is essential issue for the reduction of all the factors for Eloss.
3. Determination of Eloss and offset energies
The Eloss value is calculated by Eg − qVOC, in which for OPVs Eg is the bandgap of the material with a narrower bandgap in the blend system. Here, it should be noted that how to determine the Eg affects the Eloss value.43,55Fig. 3 shows different methods for determining the Eg extracted from the ref. 55. The most commonly used Eg values are determined from the onset of the UV-vis absorption spectrum, which is referred to as the optical bandgap. This method often includes some errors especially when there is no strict linear region in the absorption edge or when the light scattering is very significant for the absorption tail. Further, absorption onset of the material sometimes significantly shifts when blended with other material. Thus, in such case the absorption spectrum, or EQE spectrum, of the blend film should be used for the extraction of Eg rather than the that of the neat film (Fig. 3a).56 Another method for estimating Eg, which is physically meaningful, is to use the intersection of the normalized absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 3b).57,58 This can be replaced by using the photovoltaic EQE spectrum and the EL spectrum of the neat device.43 The use of the photovoltaic EQE spectrum of the blend system could be even better method because it represents the external property of the complete photovoltaic cell and it is accessible to every researcher who works on OPVs. Eg can be determined by the crossing point of extrapolated line of the EQE edge and horizontal tangent of the local peak (Fig. 3c), or determined by using the inflection point of the EQE curve (Fig. 3d).55,58

For example, we here show variation of Eg in a π-conjugated polymer PNOz4T, which gives small Eloss when paired with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as will be described in Section 4.2, by above-mentioned methods in Table 1. The Eg for PNOz4T was determined to be 1.54 eV from the onset of UV-vis absorption spectrum of the neat film. Whereas the Eg was determined to be 1.52 eV from the onset of the EQE spectrum for the PNOz4T/PC71BM cell (method shown in Fig. 3a), it was determined to be 1.60 eV from the EQE edge (method shown in Fig. 3c). By using the intersection of the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of the neat film (method shown in Fig. 3b), the Eg was determined to be 1.60 eV. Further, the Eg was determined to be 1.55 eV from the inflection point of the EQE spectrum (method shown in Fig. 3d). As such, the Eg varied from 1.52 to 1.60 eV depending on the measuring methods in this case.

Note that however, Eg values shown in this review are optical bandgaps determined from the onset of the film absorption spectrum, unless otherwise noted, although we now know that this method is not the better one in terms of reproducibility and physical meaning. This is because in most of the reported studies, Eg is determined in this method. Thus, we note that the Eloss values shown here would include some experimental errors.
The offset energies ΔEL and ΔEH are often determined on the basis of the LUMO and HOMO energy levels (ELUMO and EHOMO) of the material that are measured separately in the neat film most typically by cyclic voltammetry (CV). In some cases, ELUMO and EHOMO are evaluated by low-energy inverse photoemission spectroscopy59,60 and photoemission spectroscopy, respectively. However, the estimation of the ΔEL and ΔEH values based on the EHOMO and ELUMO evaluated by the measurements of the isolated materials is considered to neglect the influence of exciton binding energy and other interfacial effects.61 Alternatively, the offset energy can be determined by the measurements of the blend film, in which offset energy of ΔE = Eg − ECT is used. ECT can be determined by the intersection of the reduced photovoltaic EQE spectrum and the reduced EL spectrum of the OPV cell (Fig. 4).43,54 Although the use of the blend film to estimate the ECT is a more accurate method to determine the offset energy, the use of the neat film to estimate the energy levels is much more common in literatures, most likely because it is easier and more accessible. Thus, the offset energy values for the blend systems shown in this review are basically determined by the offset of the ELUMO or EHOMO, and the values should include experimental errors.

4. Polymer/fullerene cells
4.1. Fullerene derivatives as n-type materials
Polymer/fullerene blends are the most widely studied systems in OPVs, in which methanofullerenes, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)62 and PC71BM (Fig. 5a),63 are commonly used as the n-type material. When one of the most common polymers, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Fig. 5b), having an Eg of around 1.9 eV, is combined as the p-type semiconductor, the cell typically shows PCEs in the range of 3–4% with VOCs of around 0.6 V,64–67 resulting in the Eloss of ∼1.3 eV. As fullerenes are n-type semiconductors, their LUMO energy levels (ELUMOs) are an important parameter in discussing the Eloss. Thus, we here summarize fullerene derivatives that possess shallower ELUMOs than PC61BM and PC71BM (PCBMs).62 Note that as most of the Eloss values were not discussed in the literature, we calculated the Eloss values shown below, using Eg − qVOC. Fig. 5 displays the chemical structures of the fullerene derivatives introduced here along with p-type semiconducting materials, and Table 2 summarizes the electronic and photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives.

The addition of functional groups to fullerene can reduce the π-conjugated system and thus raise the ELUMO of fullerene.7,68–70 Among “PC61BM multiadducts”, which are C60 derivatives with two, three, or higher number of the same substituent (phenyl butyric acid methyl ester),71–75 PC61BM bisadduct (bis-PC61BM) (Fig. 5a) is the most successful derivative for OPVs. Blom and co-workers reported that bis-PC61BM had an ELUMO of approximately −3.7 eV, which was ∼0.1 eV shallower than that of PC61BM.64 The bis-PC61BM cell thus afforded a VOC that was higher by 0.15 V relative to that for the PC61BM cell when the material was used in combination with P3HT; VOC for the P3HT/bis-PC61BM cell was 0.73 V, whereas that for the P3HT/PC61BM cell was 0.58 V. As a result, Eloss was reduced to 1.15 eV from 1.30 eV by replacing PC61BM with bis-PC61BM. Further, the bis-PC61BM cell exhibited high JSC and FF values, resulting in the PCE of 4.5%, which was approximately a factor of 1.2 larger than that of 3.8% for the PC61BM cell. This suggested that the additional functionalization of the fullerene cage in bis-PC61BM had almost no negative effect on the charge-carrier properties of fullerene.
Indene-adducted fullerene derivatives were also reported to show shallower ELUMOs and thus afford higher VOCs for OPVs than PCBMs. Laird and co-workers demonstrated that C60-indene monoadduct and bisadduct afforded VOCs of 0.63 and 0.84 V, respectively, in the cells combined with P3HT,76 were higher by 0.05 and 0.26 V, respectively, than that for the P3HT/PC61BM cell of 0.58 V. The PCE was 3.9 and 5.1% for the cell with the C60-indene monoadduct and bisadduct, respectively, and, in particular, the latter was markedly enhanced relative to 3.9% for the cell with PC61BM. Li et al. also reported the same C60 derivatives, namely, indene-C60 monoadduct and bisadduct, which were called ICMA and ICBA (Fig. 5a), respectively.65 Interestingly, indene addition to C60 in ICMA resulted in a negative shift of the reduction potential in CV, and the second addition of indene to C60 in ICBA induced a stronger negative shift of the reduction potential. The ELUMO values of ICMA and ICBA are, respectively, 0.05 and 0.17 eV higher than that of PCBM. Further, P3HT/ICMA and P3HT/ICBA cells showed VOC values of 0.63 and 0.84 V, respectively, which were 0.05 and 0.26 V higher, respectively, than that of the P3HT/PC61BM cell of 0.58 V reported in the same literature. As a result, the Eloss values for the ICMA and ICBA cells were calculated to be 1.25 and 1.04 eV, respectively. Although the values were still large, the Eloss for the ICBA cell was significantly smaller than that for the PC61BM cell.
Nakamura and co-workers developed and evaluated bis(dimethylphenylsilylmethyl)[60]fullerene (SIMEF) (Fig. 5a) as an n-type fullerene derivative.77 SIMEF had an ELUMO of −3.70 eV, which was approximately 0.2 eV higher than that of PC61BM. The P3HT/SIMEF cell showed a higher VOC (0.67 V) than the P3HT/PC61BM cell (0.58 V), with the Eloss of the former being 1.23 eV.78 In addition, when SIMEF was combined with tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) (Fig. 5b), which was thermally converted from the corresponding precursor, as the p-type material, the resultant cell showed a VOC of 0.75 V, which was 0.2 V higher than that for the PC61BM cell, along with a PCE of 5.2%. In this case, the Eloss for the BP/SIMEF cell was calculated to be 0.97 eV.77
4.2. π-Conjugated polymers as p-type materials
One of the most highly performing π-conjugated polymers in polymer/fullerene systems is PTB7-Th (Fig. 6), which is also called PBDTTT-EFT or PCE10.79 The PTB7-Th/PC71BM system generally gives PCEs of around 9% with a VOC of 0.78 V.79,80 As the Eg for PTB7-Th is 1.58 eV, the Eloss for the PTB7-Th/PC71BM system is as large as 0.80 eV. This means that there is much room for reducing the Eloss for polymer/fullerene systems. In order to realize this, fine tuning of the energetics of the p-type π-conjugated polymers with respect to those of PCBMs is a promising strategy as tuning of the energetics of fullerenes has limitations and, so far, fullerenes other than PCBMs are not a good pair to the polymers other than P3HT. π-Conjugated polymers enabling a small Eloss should be designed with a strong electron-deficient heteroaromatic ring (acceptor) as the building unit in the backbone, so that the ELUMO can be effectively deepened to reduce the ΔEL. Here, we introduce D–A polymers that incorporate a range of strong acceptor units, affording deep ELUMOs. The chemical structures of the polymers described here are shown in Fig. 6. The electronic and photovoltaic properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 3.

Bazan and co-workers reported a D–A polymer, PIPCP (Fig. 6), which is composed of pyridylthiadiazole (PT) as the strong acceptor unit and cyclopentadithiophene (CDT) and indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the electron-rich donor unit.29 The ELUMO of PIPCP was determined to be −3.74 eV by adding Eg of 1.46 eV to the EHOMO of −5.21 eV estimated by CV. A high VOC of 0.86 V, considering the narrow Eg of the polymer, was observed for the PIPCP/PC61BM cell, which resulted in a small Eloss of 0.60 eV. Further, the PIPCP/PC61BM cell exhibited as high as 6.1% PCE with the EQEmax of 62%, which was higher than that for OPVs with a small Eloss of around 0.6 eV. They further studied the polymer system in depth and found that the Eg of PIPCP in the blend film was determined to be 1.41 eV by photothermal deflection spectroscopy. With the improved VOC of 0.89 V, the Eloss was re-estimated to be 0.52 eV.56 They assumed that the high morphological order and the low energetic disorder in the PIPCP/PC61BM blend film, as proven by the small Urbach energy (EU) of 27 meV, would account for the minimized Eloss.
Janssen et al. designed a series of π-conjugated polymers incorporating thiazole-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor unit with different donor units, such as thiophene (PDPP2TzT), benzodithiophene (PDPP2TzBDT), bithiophene (PDPP2Tz2T), and dithienopyrrole (PDPP2TzDTP) (Fig. 6).32 Introducing the thiazole rings next to the DPP moiety further deepened the ELUMOs compared with those of typical DPP-based polymers in which the thiophene rings are typically attached to the DPP unit. As a result, ΔEL, the offset energy of LUMO between the p-type and n-type materials, was determined to be 0.07–0.22 eV from the difference in reduction potential between the polymer and PC71BM in CV, and this, in turn, resulted in very small Eloss values of 0.48–0.59 eV. It was also found that the EQEmax decreased with the decrease of ΔEL. The PDPP2TzT/PC71BM cell with the smallest Eloss of 0.48 eV showed a low PCE of 1.1% because of its low EQEmax of 5% and thus low JSC of 2.0 mA cm−2, which was ascribable to its very small ΔEL of 0.07 eV. The other polymers showed high PCEs relative to PDPP2TzT due to the increased EQEmax and JSCs; PCEs were 3.2% (Eloss = 0.55 eV, EQEmax = 25%) for PDPP2TzBDT/PC71BM, 5.1% (Eloss = 0.55 eV, EQEmax = 40%) for PDPP2Tz2T/PC71BM, and 5.6% (Eloss = 0.59 eV, EQEmax = 52%) for PDPP2TzDTP/PC71BM cells.
Owing to the high electronegativity, the introduction of a fluorine atom can effectively deepen the ELUMOs of the π-conjugated polymers.81–84 Among a number of fluorinated polymers, a series of polymers based on the emerging strong acceptor unit naphthobisthiadiazole (NTz) are a good example for studies of the Eloss reduction. An NTz-based polymer having a quaterthiophene donor unit (PNTz4T) (Fig. 6),19 which has an Eg of 1.56 eV, exhibited a PCE of 10.1% for the cell combined with PC71BM.85 However, because the VOC was limited to 0.71–0.74 V, the Eloss for the PNTz4T cell was 0.82–0.85 eV, which was the typical range for polymer/fullerene cells. Osaka and co-workers synthesized a series of NTz-based polymers by introducing fluorine atoms on the bithiophene moiety and/or the NTz unit (Fig. 6).86,87 When fluorine atoms were introduced on the bithiophene moiety (F0–F2 and F0–F4), the EHOMOs were downshifted more than the ELUMOs, resulting in large Eg values.86 On the other hand, when fluorine atoms were introduced on the NTz unit (F2–F0), the ELUMO was downshifted more than the EHOMO, resulting in a narrow Eg.87 This could be explained by the geometry of HOMOs and LUMOs, where HOMOs are mainly located on the quaterthiophene unit and LUMOs are mainly located on the NTz moiety. Note that because F2–F2 had fluorine atoms on both the bithiophene unit and the NTz unit, both EHOMO and ELUMO were equally downshifted, which resulted in a similar Eg to PNTz4T. As a consequence, the Eloss was successfully reduced in all cases; 0.78 eV for F0–F2, 0.69 eV for F0–F4, 0.73 eV for F2–F0, and 0.69 eV for F2–F2. The F2–F2 cell showed the best performance with up to 10.8% PCE, along with the smallest Eloss among these polymers.
Yu et al. reported a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based polymer named PBDTT-SF-TT (Fig. 6), in which the alkyl group on the thiophene substituents of PTB7-Th was replaced with an alkylthio group, leading to deeper energy levels.88 In fact, the EHOMO of PBDTT-SF-TT was found to be −5.54 eV, which was deeper by 0.24 eV than that of PTB7-Th, whereas the Eg of 1.59 eV was similar. The VOC for the PBDTT-SF-TT/PC71BM cell was 1.0 V, which was higher by more than 0.2 V than that for the PTB7-Th/PC71BM cell of 0.78 V. Thus, the Eloss was significantly reduced to 0.59 eV from 0.80 eV. Importantly, the PCE remained high at 9.1%, whereas the PTB7-Th cell showed 9.0% PCE.
Naphthobisoxadiazole (NOz), an oxygen analog of NTz, is a very strong acceptor unit due to the high electronegativity of oxygen.89 Osaka and co-workers reported that an NOz-based polymer (PNOz4T) (Fig. 6) had an ELUMO of −3.65 eV, which is deeper than that of PNTz4T by ca. 0.2 eV, resulting in a very small ΔEL of 0.12 eV, which is much smaller than the empirical threshold value of 0.3 eV. This was further confirmed by the EL measurement of the PNOz4T/PC71BM device, which showed a very similar spectrum to the PL spectrum of PNOz4T, suggesting that the ES1 and the ECT are very close and thus the offset energy is nearly 0 eV. As a result, the PNOz4T/PC71BM cells exhibited remarkably high VOCs of up to ∼1 V despite the fact that the polymer had a small Eg of 1.54 eV, leading to significantly small Eloss values of 0.54–0.58 eV.30 Those values were among the smallest for polymer/PCBM-based cells, smaller than the empirical limit of 0.6 eV. Importantly, those cells exhibited EQEmax of 65% and as high as 8.9% PCEs despite the small ΔEL. Further, a transient absorption spectroscopy study revealed that the charge dissociation was almost 100% and the EQE was limited by the exciton diffusion, which implied that the small driving-force energy would not be a limiting factor for the charge generation. A striking feature of PNOz4T is its very high crystallinity in the thin film and the high charge carrier mobility of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the transistor device. In addition, the EU estimated from the EQE spectra of both neat and blend films were 27 meV (Fig. S2†), suggesting that the polymer is highly ordered and that EQE corresponding to the CT absorption is negligible. It is speculated that the high charge transport would facilitate the charge generation and thus prevent the geminate recombination at the p/n interface that could more easily happen when the ΔEL is small. Gao and co-workers reported that the qΔVnr for the PNOz4T/PC71BM cell was 0.24 eV, which was significantly smaller than that for the common PTB7-Th/PC71BM cell and similar to that for polymer/non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) cells with small Eloss values. This was another reason for the small Eloss in this system.49 Such a small qΔVnr is probably because of LE–CT hybridization due to negligibly small ΔEL, as theoretically suggested.47
Wong, Chou, and co-workers also reported the development of an NOz-based polymer (PSiNO) (Fig. 6), in which a silole-based ladder-type fused ring was combined as the donor unit.90 PSiNO had an Eg of 1.56 eV. Although they did not discuss the Eloss issue in their report, the PSiNO/PC71BM cell exhibited a high VOC of 0.90 V, thus the Eloss was calculated to be 0.66 eV, and a relatively high PCE of 8.4%.
Guo, Facchetti, and co-workers synthesized copolymer PisoBBT4T (Fig. 6) based on benzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis[1,2,3]-thiadiazole (isoBBT),91 a regioisomer of the widely studied benzobis[1,2-c;4,5-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT) unit. The isoBBT unit was found to downshift the EHOMO and upshift the ELUMO with respect to the BBT unit. Thus, PisoBBT4T had an Eg of 1.40 eV, which was significantly wider than that of the BBT counterpart, with deep ELUMO and EHOMO of approximately −4.0 eV and −5.4 eV (determined by ELUMO − Eg), respectively. The PisoBBT4T/PC61BM cell gave a VOC of 0.81 V, which resulted in an Eloss of 0.59 eV, and a PCE of 10.3% that is relatively high for fullerene-based cells.
4.3. Summary
In polymer/fullerene-based devices, multifunctionalized fullerene derivatives with a shallower ELUMO have led to a smaller ΔEL, thereby reducing the Eloss when combined with P3HT. However, the Eloss values are still around 1 eV due to the very shallow ELUMO of P3HT and thus the large ΔELs of more than 0.8 eV in all cases. Unfortunately, no good performance has been reported so far for these shallow ELUMO fullerene derivatives with the combination of D–A polymers with narrower Egs, likely due to the increased population of the triplet state in the fullerene derivatives.92,93 On the other hand, the development of new π-conjugated polymers incorporating a very strong acceptor unit has realized the reduction of ΔEL and thus Eloss to below 0.6 eV, the minimum value that had previously been suggested for OPVs. Some systems were found to have an Eloss even close to 0.5 eV, which is comparable to that for inorganic solar cells. Although polymer/fullerene-based devices showed significantly decreased EQEmax when the Eloss was less than 0.6 eV, exceptionally PIPCP and PNOz4T showed relatively high EQEmaxs even with the small Eloss values. This is partly because of LE–CT hybridization due to negligibly small ΔEL. Although the reason is not yet fully understood, a common feature in these polymers is the highly ordered structure in the blend film, which most likely originates in the π-extended large fused-ring systems that are used as the building unit for their polymer backbones. Such structural feature could be a key factor for achieving efficient charge generation under a small driving-force energy.
5. Polymer/non-fullerene cells
5.1. Non-fullerene n-type materials (non-fullerene acceptors: NFAs)
Non-fullerene n-type organic semiconductors, namely, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), are state-of-the-art materials in the OPV area. NFAs can be classified by their bandgaps, i.e., NFAs with wide bandgaps of more than 2 eV and those with narrow bandgaps of less than 1.8 eV. Wide-bandgap NFAs are combined with p-type polymers having narrow bandgaps, and thus the Eloss is correlated to the ΔEL. Narrow-bandgap NFAs, on the other hand, are typically combined with wide-bandgap p-type polymers, and thus the Eloss is correlated to the ΔEH, although in some cases they are combined with narrow-bandgap polymers. In this section, we summarize NFAs with wide and narrow bandgaps (Fig. 7 and 8, respectively). We also present some important wide-bandgap p-type polymers that are typically combined with narrow-bandgap NFAs (Fig. 9). The electronic and photovoltaic properties of the NFAs and the polymers are summarized in Tables 4–6, respectively.

5.1.1. Wide-bandgap NFAs. 
Perylene diimide (PDI), a well-known dye molecule, is the most commonly used building unit for wide-bandgap NFAs due to its absorption property and electron-deficient nature.46,94,95 In early studies of NFAs, simple PDI derivatives with substituents at the N-position were investigated.96–98 However, most likely due to their nearly planar structure, those PDI derivatives form aggregates in the blend film, which results in very poor performances in the OPV cells. On the other hand, recently, PDI-based NFAs in which multiple PDI or related building units are linked in twisted manners have been designed in order to hinder such strong aggregation. Further, the twisted geometries would result in the localization of the π-conjugation at each building unit, which would lead to a wide bandgap and a shallow ELUMO.
Yan and co-workers reported two PDI-based NFAs, diPDI and SF-PDI2 (Fig. 7a). In diPDI, two N,N-dialkyl PDIs are directly linked to be dimerized, whereas in SF-PDI2, the two PDI units are attached to spirobifluorene.99 Although the absorption spectra and the Egs of the two materials were mostly identical, both EHOMO and ELUMO were deeper for SF-PDI2 than for diPDI: ELUMO values, determined on the basis of EHOMO and Eg, were −3.96 eV for diPDI and −3.83 eV for SF-PDI2. These materials were paired with PffBT4T-DT (Fig. 7b) with the Eg of 1.65 eV in the OPV cell. The cells demonstrated VOCs of 0.84 and 0.98 V, respectively, both of which were higher than that for the PffBT4T-DT/PC61BM cell by 0.2 V. As a result, the Eloss values for the diPDI and SF-PDI2 cells were 0.81 and 0.67 eV, respectively. SF-PDI2 was also combined with p-type polymer P3TEA (Fig. 7b) having the Eg of 1.72 eV, which was determined on the basis of the crossing point between the absorption and PL spectra. The P3TEA/SF-PDI2 cell exhibited a very high VOC of 1.11 V, which resulted in a small Eloss of 0.61 eV, and a high PCE of 9.5%.15 Interestingly, despite the small Eloss as well as the small ΔEL of 0.05 eV, the EQEmax was relatively high with 66% and the maximum internal quantum efficiency (IQEmax) was found to be nearly 90%, which originated in the fast charge generation.
Cho and co-workers reported a related material, SF-PDI4 (Fig. 7a), where two more PDI units were attached to the other fluorene moiety.100 Thus, SF-PDI4 has a more twisted 3D conformation than SF-PDI2, which possibly further hinders aggregation in the film. SF-PDI4 has an ELUMO of −3.78 eV as determined by CV. Unfortunately, this value could not be directly compared with that for SF-PDI2 because their measurement methods differed. SF-PDI4 was blended with P4T2FBT (PffBT4T-DT) and PV4T2FBT (Fig. 7b) in OPV cells, which provided VOCs of 0.93 and 0.90 V, giving rise to the Eloss values of 0.71 and 0.70 eV, respectively. These values were slightly larger than those for the SF-PDI2 cell. Several other PDI-based wide-bandgap NFAs with four PDI units attached to a central core unit were also reported: TPC-PDI4 (ref. 101–103) with tetraphenylmethane, TPE-PDI4 (ref. 103) with the tetraphenylethylene core,104 and TPPz-PDI4 with the tetraphenyl pyrazine core (Fig. 7a).103 Those three materials were systematically investigated by blending with PffBT-T3(1,2)-2 (Fig. 7b).103 The ELUMOs for these three materials based on CV were similar at around −3.75 eV, and the ΔELs were less than 0.1 eV. Interestingly, however, the VOCs for the cells appeared different and the materials with a more twisted structure showed higher VOC values: 1.04 V for TPC-PDI4, 1.03 V for TPE-PDI4, and 0.99 V for TPPz-PDI4. As a result, the Eloss values increased as 0.59, 0.60, and 0.64 eV for TPC-PDI4, TPE-PDI4, and TPPz-PDI4, respectively, though the EQEmaxs and the PCEs decreased in this order. The same trend was found when P3HT and PTB7-Th were employed as the p-type polymer.
Yan and co-workers designed and synthesized a PDI-based NFA named FTTB-PDI4 (Fig. 7a) through the ring fusion of the PDI moiety with the thiophene linker on the central benzene core.105 Interestingly, the ring fusion reduced the twisting of the PDI moieties, which led to the highly delocalized HOMO and LUMO densities as well as the highly developed π-conjugation throughout the molecular structure. The ELUMO for FTTB-PDI4 was −3.58 eV, which was 0.1 eV shallower than that for the precursor material before the ring fusion. This would be attributed to the electron-donating nature of the thiophene moiety incorporated by the ring fusion. Further, the ΔEL value for the blend of FTTB-PDI4 with P3TEA was negligibly small at 0.02 eV, which led to a markedly high VOC of 1.13 V and thus a small Eloss of 0.53 eV. Despite the negligible ΔEL, interestingly, the OPV cell based on the blend exhibited a high EQEmax of 68% and thus a PCE of 10.6%.
Apart from the PDI-related wide-bandgap NFAs, McCulloch and co-workers reported a series of rhodanine-end-capped rigid-rod NFAs.18,106 Among them, FBR (Fig. 7a), in which bisbenzothiadiazolylfluorene was used as the core structure, had a wide Eg of around 2 eV, probably arising from the twisted linkage between the benzothiadiazole and fluorene units, and a relatively deep ELUMO of −3.75 eV, being suitable for narrow-bandgap p-type polymers. When PffBT4T-DT with the Eg of 1.61 eV was paired, the blend had a very small ΔEL of 0.05 eV. Consequently, the cell showed a high VOC of 1.12 V, which led to a significantly small Eloss of 0.49 eV. The EQEmax was relatively high as 57% for such a small Eloss and the PCE was reasonably high as 7.8%.


5.1.2. Narrow-bandgap NFAs. 
Narrow-bandgap NFAs typically have chemical structures composed of a rigid-rod π-extended fused ring as the core that is shielded by bulky non-conjugated side chains and is end-capped with polar functional groups often used as the building unit of organic dyes (Fig. 8). The bulky side chains would offer high solubility as well as hinder aggregation that is thought be detrimental to the photovoltaic performance. As can be seen in Table 5, the energy levels for the narrow-bandgap NFAs are deep, which is likely due to the strong electron deficiency of the end-capping groups.
IDTBR (Fig. 8),18,106 one of the rhodanine-end-capped NFAs having IDT as the core, was reported to have a relatively narrow Eg of 1.63 eV and an EHOMO of −5.45 eV. When IDTBR was blended with P3HT, the cell showed a VOC of 0.72 V, giving rise to a large Eloss of ∼0.9 eV, which was due to the large ΔEH of ∼0.5 eV, although the cell showed one of the highest PCEs among the P3HT-based cells, ∼6.3%.18,106 However, when the polymer was switched to PffBT4T-DT having a deeper EHOMO of −5.34 eV than P3HT, the cell exhibited VOC that was as high as 1.07 V and thus a small Eloss of 0.56 eV, and a relatively high PCE of 9.95%.106 A similar polymer, PffBT2T-TT, was also paired with IDTBR. The cell showed a VOC of 1.08 V, which resulted in a small Eloss of 0.55 eV. However, the cell showed a relatively high EQEmax of 67% and an improved PCE of 10.4%.107 Interestingly, both ΔEH and ΔEL were similarly small at <0.1 eV, due to nearly the same Eg for PffBT2T-TT and IDTBR.
ITIC (Fig. 8), in which the indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) core that is further π-extended fused ring compared to IDT, is end-capped with dicyanomethyleneindanone (DCM) groups, is one of the prototypes for emerging NFAs.14 The reported Eg, EHOMO, and ELUMO values for ITIC are typically 1.60, −5.61, and −4.02 eV, respectively. When PTB7-Th having an Eg similar to ITIC was used as the p-type polymer, the ITIC-based cell had a PCE of 6.3% and a VOC of 0.81 V, resulting in an Eloss of 0.79 eV, which was similar to that for the PTB7-Th/PC61BM cell. The relatively large Eloss for the PTB7-Th/ITIC cell is most likely because both ΔEH and ΔEL are relatively large (∼0.3 eV). The use of PBDB-T having a wider Eg and a deeper EHOMO than PTB7-Th led to an increased VOC of 0.90 V and a PCE of 11.2%, and thereby a decreased Eloss of 0.70 eV.108
Derivatives of ITIC were synthesized by introducing substituents on the 3-DCM end-capping groups. Hou and co-workers synthesized fluorinated and chlorinated derivatives IT-4F16 and IT-4Cl (Fig. 8),109 respectively, which had downshifted energy levels relative to ITIC owing to the electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine and chlorine atoms, and had slightly reduced Eg values of 1.55 and 1.48 eV, respectively. IT-4F was combined with PBDB-TSF, which also had downshifted energy levels relative to PBDB-T. The PBDB-TSF/IT-4F cell showed a VOC of 0.88 V and thus an Eloss of 0.66 eV, which was similar to that for the PBDB-T/ITIC cell, but gave a high EQEmax of 83% and a high PCE of 13.0%.16 IT-4Cl was combined with PBDB-TF, which is also called PM6, and the cell exhibited a VOC of 0.79 V, which resulted in an Eloss of 0.69 eV, and a PCE as high as 13.5%.109 The same group also reported IT-M and IT-DM (Fig. 8), in which one methyl group and two methyl groups were introduced on the DCM moiety, respectively. IT-M and IT-DM had upshifted energy levels, in particular ELUMO, relative to ITIC due to the electron-donating nature of the methyl group, whereas they had slightly wide Egs.110 When PBDB-T was used as the p-type polymer, the IT-M and IT-DM cells showed increased VOC values of 0.94 and 0.97 V, respectively, both resulting in the same small Eloss of 0.66 eV.
Chen and colleagues investigated a series of NFAs with a CDT-flanked difluorophenyl moiety as the central core, namely, DF-PCIC, HC-PCIC, and FO-PCIC (Fig. 8), which had deep EHOMOs of around −5.5 eV. They prepared six polymer/NFA blends using three different polymers, such as PBDB-T, PBDB-TF, and PTQ-10 (Fig. 9), and these NFAs, with ΔEH values varying from −0.05 to 0.21 eV.111 Interestingly, despite the fact that the PTQ10/HC-PCIC and PBDB-TF/HC-PCIC cells had ΔEH values of nearly zero and 0.06 eV, respectively, those cells afforded quite high EQEmaxs of around 70%, leading to high PCEs of 10.4 and 11.8%, respectively. Further, the Eloss values for the PTQ10/HC-PCIC and PBDB-TF/HC-PCIC cells were found to be 0.55 and 0.59 eV, respectively.
With the alkoxythiophene groups attached between the IDT core and the DCM end-capping group, IEICO had a shallow EHOMO relative to ITIC but a similar ELUMO and a very small Eg of 1.34 eV.112 When IEICO was combined with PBDTTT-E-T in which the fluorine atom in PTB7-Th was replaced with the hydrogen atom, the ΔEH was as small as 0.23 eV. The PBDTTT-E-T/IEICO cell showed the maximum PCE of 8.4% along with a relatively high VOC of 0.82 eV, giving rise to a small Eloss of 0.52 eV. Similarly to the ITIC system, the fluorinated and chlorinated versions of IEICO, named IEICO-4F113 and IEICO-4Cl,114 were also reported (Fig. 8). IEICO-4F and IEICO-4Cl showed slightly reduced Egs of 1.24 and 1.23 eV, and deep energy levels relative to IEICO, respectively. IEICO-4F and IEICO-4Cl were combined with PTB7-Th, where the ΔEH values were 0.20 eV for PTB7-Th/IEICO-4F and 0.32 eV for PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl blends. As a result, the PTB7-Th/IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl cells exhibited VOC values of 0.74 and 0.73 V, respectively, and consequently very small Elosss of 0.50 eV. Due to the relatively high EQEmax of around 70%, the cell had high JSCs of more than 20 mA cm−2 and PCEs of around 10.0% for both cells. Although the reason is yet unclear, the cells based on these IEICO series showed even smaller Elosss than the cells based on PCIC series as described above despite the larger ΔEH values. This might be due to the determination of Eg as well as ΔEH or possibly the difference in other loss factors.
ITIC-like NFAs having different central cores with small Egs were also investigated. Chen and co-workers designed 6TIC115 and 3TT-FIC (Fig. 8),116 in which three thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units bridged by a carbon atom were employed as the central core along with the DCM end-capping groups. 6TIC and 3TT-FIC showed broad and strong absorptions, exhibiting onset absorption wavelengths of 905 and 995 nm, which corresponded to Egs of 1.37 and 1.25 eV, respectively. The EHOMO values for these materials were around −5.4 eV, resulting in the ΔEH values of 0.22 and 0.18 eV for 6TIC and 3TT-FIC cells, respectively, when blended with PTB7-Th, respectively. The PTB7-Th/6TIC cell exhibited a VOC of 0.83 V and thus a relatively small Eloss of 0.54 eV, along with a PCE of 10.7%, whereas the PTB7-Th/3TT-FIC cell showed a VOC of 0.66 V and thus a slightly larger Eloss of 0.59 eV, but with a higher PCE of 12.2%.
Ding and co-workers reported a narrow-bandgap NFA, COi8DFIC (Fig. 8),117–119 in which the central fused-ring core has three thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units similar to 3TT-FIC, but these thienothiophenes are bridged by a C–O bond, forming 2H-pyran groups. COi8DFIC was reported to have an Eg of 1.18 eV and an EHOMO of −5.50 eV. Among NFAs with the CO-bridged ladder-type central cores,120 COi8DFIC had the narrowest Eg. When PTB7-Th was combined, the ΔEH was found to be about 0.11 eV. The PTB7-Th/COi8DFIC cell showed a VOC of 0.68 V and thus a small Eloss of 0.50 eV, along with 12.2% PCE.121 In addition, a PTB7-Th/COi8DFIC/PC71BM ternary cell exhibited an improved VOC of 0.73 V, perhaps being affected by the relatively shallow ELUMO for PC71BM, which led to a significantly small Eloss of 0.45 eV, but a significantly high EQEmax of 85% and a high PCE of 14.6%.117
Jen and co-workers reported NFAs that were based on a highly π-extended electron-rich dithienopicenocarbazole moiety as the central core, DTPC-IC and DTPC-DFIC (Fig. 8).122 DTPC-IC and DTPC-DFIC had very narrow Egs of 1.24 and 1.21 eV, and EHOMOs of −5.21 and −5.31 eV, resulting in very small ΔEH values of 0.01 and 0.11 eV, respectively, when combined with PTB7-Th. Although the PTB7-Th/DTPC-IC cell showed poor performance with a PCE of 3.1% because of the low EQEmax of 28%, a high VOC of 0.86 V for such a narrow-bandgap system was observed, resulting in an extremely small Eloss of 0.42 eV. In contrast, the PTB7-Th/DTPC-DFIC cell showed a high PCE of 10.2% owing to the significantly enhanced EQEmax of 69% compared to the DTPC-IC cell even though the Eloss was still significantly small at 0.45 eV.
Li and co-workers employed a highly π-extended electron-deficient dithienothienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT) as the central core of DCM-end-capped NFAs, namely, Y5 (ref. 123) and Y6 (Fig. 8).17 Y5 and Y6 exhibited relatively broad and strong absorptions, showing onset absorption wavelengths of 900 and 931 nm, which corresponded to the Egs of 1.38 and 1.33 eV, along with relatively deep EHOMOs of −5.55 and −5.65 eV, respectively. Thus, the ΔEH values of PBDB-T/Y5 and PBDB-TF/Y6 blends were found to be 0.17 and 0.09 eV, respectively. The PBDB-T/Y5 cell exhibited a VOC of 0.88 V, thus an Eloss of 0.50 eV, and a high EQEmax of 75%, which resulted in a high PCE of 14.1%. The PBDB-TF/Y6 cell exhibited a similar Eloss of 0.50 eV with a VOC of 0.83 V, but gave an even higher EQEmax of 83% and an improved PCE of 15.7%. Further, a similar NFA in which fluorine atoms on the DCM moieties were replaced with chlorine atoms, named BTP-4Cl or Y7 (Fig. 8), was reported.124 BTP-4Cl had a similar Eg of 1.40 eV and slightly downshifted energy levels (EHOMO = −5.68 eV, ELUMO = −4.12 eV) relative to Y6. Note that in this report, the Egs for Y6 and BTP-4Cl were determined from the intersection of the absorption and fluorescence spectra, thereby the Eg for Y6 differed from that in the earlier report.17 The PBDB-TF/BTP-4Cl cell showed a slightly improved VOC of 0.87 V, resulting in a small Eloss of 0.53 eV, along with a high PCE of 16.5% relative to the PBDB-TF/Y6 cell. Interestingly, although BTP-4Cl showed a deeper ELUMO than its fluorinated analog Y6, the BTP-4Cl cell exhibited higher VOC than the Y6 cell even when the same p-type polymer was combined. This originated in its reduced energy loss by non-radiative recombination (qΔVnr).
Interestingly, the group of Hou, He, and Meng designed an NFA molecule,125 ANT-4F (Fig. 8), by replacing the IDTT core of IT-4F with anthracene, which is a strongly fluorescent chromophore compared with thiophene-based ones. They expected that the incorporation of a more fluorescent chromophore would lead to higher quantum efficiency even from the CT exciton of the blend system, which would result in a reduced qΔVnr. In fact, ANT-4F showed significantly higher PL intensity than IT-4F in the neat film. Further, the PBDB-TF/ANT-4F blend film exhibited higher efficiency in the EL measurement as well as in the PL measurement. As a result, qΔVnr for the ANT-4F cell was found to be 0.22 eV, which was 0.06 eV smaller than that for the IT-4F cell. Although the overall Eloss was 0.74 eV for the ANT-4F cell and 0.79 eV for the IT-4F cell, which was not significantly small, the main difference in Eloss originated in the difference in qΔVnr. Hou and co-workers reported a series of TPBT-based molecules in which the number of the fluorine atom on the DCM group was 0, 2, 4, and 6 (BTP-0F, BTP-2F, BTP-4F, and BTP-6F), respectively, (Fig. 8).126 They found that the intermolecular interactions between these molecules and PBDB-TF polymer were enhanced by increasing the fluorine number. This facilitated the charge generation and in turn improved the JSC. On the other hand, the intermolecular interactions were decreased by decreasing the fluorine number, which resulted in the enhanced hybridization of LE and CT states. This led to the higher EQEEL and thus the smaller qΔVnr: qΔVnr was 0.23, 0.22, 0.19, and 0.15 eV for the BTP-6F, BTP-4F, BTP-2F, and BTP-0F cells, respectively. Unfortunately, the BTP-0F cell with the smallest qΔVnr showed the lowest PCE of 8.2% among these cells due to the low EQE. The highest PCE was observed for the BTP-4F (PCE = 16.7%, qΔVnr = 0.22 eV) cell due to the balanced JSC, VOC, and FF. In addition, Y11 having the benzotriazole moiety instead of the benzothiadiazole moiety for Y6 showed a smaller qΔVnr of 0.20 eV with a PCE of 16.5% when blended with PBDB-TF (qΔVnr was reported to be as small as 0.17 eV when the PCE was 13.8%), likely due to the negligible ΔE and the low energetic disorder evidenced by a very small EU of 26 meV.22

5.2. Wide-bandgap p-type polymers
The variety of wide-bandgap p-type polymers for efficient polymer/NFA cells is somewhat limited. Most of them consist of an electron-rich BDT fused-ring unit having a thiophene-based side chain and a weak electron-deficient heteroaromatic unit. Specifically, a series of PBDB-T polymers (Fig. 9), namely, BDT-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione polymers, are often used. Hou and co-workers demonstrated that the PBDB-T/ITIC cell exhibited as high as 11.2% PCE whereas the PBDB-T/PC71BM cell showed a PCE of 7.5%, thereby providing the first example of the PCE of NFA-based cells being higher than that of fullerene-based cells.108,127 Thereafter, fluorinated, thioalkylated, and chlorinated PBDB-T polymers, namely, PBDB-TF (PM6),128,129 PBDB-TSF,16 and PBDB-T-2Cl,130 respectively, were synthesized and investigated. All these polymers had deeper EHOMOs than PBDB-T and thus had smaller ΔEH values: for example, ΔEH was more than 0.3 eV for PBDB-T whereas it was 0.19 eV for PBDB-TF, 0.26 eV for PBDB-TSF, and 0.15 eV for PBDB-T-2Cl, with respect to IT-4F. The PCE was improved to 13.2% for PBDB-TF, 13.0% for PBDB-TSF, and 14.4% for PBDB-T-2Cl relative to that for PBDB-T (10.1%). The Eloss values for these cells were around 0.7 eV, which were similar to that for the PBDB-T/ITIC cell.
Peng and colleagues reported PBDT-TDZ and PBDTS-TDZ (Fig. 9),131 which incorporate BDT and 1,3,4-triazole as the fused-ring building units. These copolymers exhibited the same Eg of 2.07 eV and EHOMOs of −5.35 and −5.39 eV, respectively, which led to small ΔEHs of ∼0.13 eV. Their blend systems exhibited good complementary absorption covering the entire visible range of 300 to 800 nm. Whereas the PBDT-TDZ/ITIC cell exhibited a VOC of 1.01 V and an Eloss of 0.56 eV, the PBDTS-TDZ/ITIC cell exhibited a high VOC of 1.10 V and an extremely small Eloss of 0.47 eV. Moreover, the PBDTS-TDZ/ITIC cell gave a high EQEmax of 79%, which was similar to the PBDT-TDS/ITIC cell, and a high PCE of 12.8% despite the fact that the Eloss was extremely small. The same group also synthesized copolymer PBDT-ODZ based on 1,3,4-oxadiazole (Fig. 9).132 With the EHOMO of −5.68 eV, PBDT-ODZ had a ΔEH of 0.1 eV when paired with ITIC-Th. The PBDT-ODZ/ITIC-Th cell exhibited a high VOC of 1.08 V, which resulted in a small Eloss of 0.50 eV, but gave a high EQEmax of 75% and a high PCE of 10.1%.
Ding and co-workers reported several BDT-based polymers with different fusedrings as the co-building unit, such as 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran-5-one (L1 and L2),133 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiopyran-5-one (D16),134 and dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (D18)20 (Fig. 9). L1 and L2 were reported to have EHOMOs of −5.45 and −5.52 eV, resulting in the ΔEH values of 0.20 and 0.13 eV, respectively, when blended with Y6. The VOC was higher for the L2 cell (0.87 V) than the L1 cell (0.80 V), and thus the Eloss was smaller for the L2 cell (0.46 eV) than the L1 cell (0.53 eV). However, the PCE was higher for the L1 cell (14.4%) than the L2 cell (12.6%), owing to the higher EQEmax for the L1 cell (79%) than in the L2 cell (68%), which seems to be as a result of larger ΔEH for the L1 cell. The EHOMOs of D16 and D18 were −5.48 and −5.51 eV, and hence ΔEHs for the D16/Y6 and D18/Y6 blends were 0.17 and 0.14 eV, respectively. The D16 and D18 cells provided VOCs of 0.83 and 0.86 V, resulting in Elosss of 0.50 and 0.47 V, respectively. These cells showed very high EQEmax of around 85%. Whereas the D16 cell exhibited a PCE of 16.0%, the D18 cell exhibited a significantly high PCE of 18.2%.
Apart from BDT-based polymers, Li and co-workers reported a quinoxaline-based polymer, PTQ10 (Fig. 9),135 which was synthesized through a two-step reaction using inexpensive raw materials. The EHOMO and Eg values for PTQ10 were reported to be −5.54 and 1.92 eV, respectively. Thus, when IDIC having an EHOMO of −5.74 eV and an Eg of 1.57 eV was combined, ΔEH was found to be 0.20 eV. The PTQ10/IDIC cell exhibited a VOC of 0.97 V, giving rise to an Eloss of 0.60 eV, and a PCE as high as 12.7%. The same group also reported a derivative of PTQ10, PTQ11, in which the methyl group was introduced in the quinoxaline unit (Fig. 9).136 PTQ11 was combined with TPT10 (Fig. 8), having the bromine atom instead of the fluorine atom of BTP-2F, which showed efficient hole transfer from TPT10 to PTQ11 despite the negligible ΔEH. The PTQ11/TPT10 cell still exhibited a very high EQEmax of 86%. As a result, the PTQ11/TPT10 cell gave a PCE of 16.3% with an Eloss of 0.48 eV. Yan and co-workers reported the wide-bandgap polymer PvBDTTAZ (Fig. 9) having an Eg of 2.05 eV, which incorporated an unsubstituted BDT unit and a weak electron-deficient benzotriazole unit. In this polymer, the unsubstituted BDT unit was linked to the phenyl position unlike other BDT-based polymers, which would give rise to a twisted backbone due to the steric hindrance at the peri-positions. PvBDTTAZ had an EHOMO of −5.47 eV, and thereby ΔEH was 0.04 eV when blended with IDTBR. The PvBDTTAZ/IDTBR cell exhibited a high VOC of 1.08 V, leading to a small Eloss of 0.55 eV, and a relatively high PCE of 11.6%.137
5.3. Summary
Wide and narrow bandgap NFAs, along with wide-bandgap p-type polymers that are employed as a pair to a narrow-bandgap NFA were summarized. In the wide-bandgap NFAs, most of the materials consist of PDI or PDI derivatives, which are long-known organic dye moieties with relatively strong electron deficiency. Further, the PDI moieties are linked to a core building unit in a highly twisted manner, avoiding aggregation. These wide-bandgap NFAs are generally combined with narrow-bandgap p-type polymers. In particular, difluorobenzothiadiazole-based polymers are mostly employed. As the ΔEL is a crucial factor for reducing the Eloss in such cases, these NFAs have relatively shallow ELUMOs.
With respect to the narrow-bandgap NFAs, they consist of rigid rod π-conjugated cores, many of which are highly π-extended ladder-type fused heteroaromatics, which are end-capped with electron-deficient functional groups, such as rhodamine or DCMs. These materials typically have deep EHOMOs, which are similar to that for the combined wide-bandgap polymer. The EHOMO is markedly affected by the core unit, whereas the ELUMO of the narrow-bandgap NFAs is strongly affected by the end-capping group. In order to tune the energy levels, various fused-ring π-conjugated systems are incorporated as the core moiety, whereas such halogens as fluorine and chlorine atoms and methyl groups are typically substituted in the DCM end-capping groups.
It is also noted that some reports have shown that ΔVnr can be reduced by tuning the molecular structure. In both wide- and narrow-bandgap NFAs, a small Eloss of around 0.5 eV has been reported. This is again probably because of LE–CT hybridization as is the case in some narrow-bandgap polymer/PCBM systems. Note that the wide-bandgap polymer/narrow-bandgap NFA systems tended to afford higher EQEs and thereby higher PCEs under small Elosss than narrow-bandgap polymer/wide-bandgap NFA systems as well as narrow-bandgap polymer/PCBM systems. Whereas the cells that use the wide-bandgap NFAs have been shown to give moderately high PCEs of 5–10%, the cells that use the narrow-bandgap NFAs have demonstrated significantly high PCEs of up to 18%. This is partly because narrow-bandgap NFAs are likely to exhibit higher EQE even at the near-IR region than typical narrow-bandgap polymers, and partly because narrow-bandgap NFAs are likely to exhibit smaller qΔVr owing to smaller EU, which is similar to narrow-bandgap polymers as mentioned before.
6. Polymer/polymer cells (all-polymer cells)
Organic solar cells that employ π-conjugated polymers for both p-type and n-type semiconductors, called all-polymer solar cells, are thought to have advantages in blend morphology stability and thus device stability over polymer/small-molecule and all-small-molecule solar cells.139,140 Although the performance of all-polymer cells has lagged far behind that of polymer/fullerene cells, recent effort in materials development, specifically n-type polymers, has resulted in small Eloss and boosted the performance with PCEs that are as high as 11%.140,141 In this section, we summarize wide- and narrow-bandgap n-type polymers that enable small Eloss in all-polymer solar cells (Fig. 10 and 11). The electronic and solar cell properties for wide- and narrow-bandgap n-type polymers are summarized in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.

6.1. Wide-bandgap n-type polymers
PDI had often been used as the building unit of n-type polymers in early studies.142 Bao and co-workers employed a polymer, P(TP) (Fig. 10), consisting of PDI and thiophene, which was combined with a series of isoindigo-based p-type polymers.143 When P(TP) was blended with the isoindigo-bithiophene polymer PiI-2T in which 5% of the side chain was polystyrene instead of a common branched alkyl group, the ΔEL was found to be as small as 0.1 eV. The solar cell composed of PiI-2T and P(TP) showed a high VOC of 1.04 V and thereby a small Eloss of 0.61 eV, although it gave a modest PCE of 4.4%.
Beaujuge and co-workers reported an all-polymer cell that used an n-type polymer consisting of thienopyrrole-dione and difluorothiophene, PTPD[2F]T (Fig. 10), having an Eg of approximately 1.9 eV and an ELUMO of −3.8 eV.144 When PTPD[2F]T was combined with PTB7-Th that possesses an Eg of 1.58 eV, although ΔEL was approximately 0.3 eV according to the reported ELUMO, the cell showed a VOC that was as high as 1.1 V, which resulted in an Eloss of approximately 0.5 eV, with a modest PCE of 4.4%.
As shown above, imide-functionalized heteroaromatics are important building units for n-type polymers.145 Imide-functionalized units that specifically afford wide-bandgap n-type polymers also include bithiopheneimide (BTI)146,147 and dithienothiophenebisimide (TBI or f-BTI2).148,149 Guo and co-workers reported a polymer consisting of f-BTI2 and difluorothiophene, named f-BTI2-FT (Fig. 10), having an Eg of 1.84 eV and an ELUMO of −3.43 eV.150 Although the ΔEL was relatively large at 0.40 eV, the PTB7-Th/f-BTI2-FT cell showed as high as 1.04 V VOC, resulting in the Eloss of as small as 0.54 eV, with a PCE of 6.9%. The same group also reported random copolymers based on f-BTI2, difluorothiophene, and thienopyrrole-dione, BTI2-xTPD, where x = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 (Fig. 10).151 All the polymers had Egs of around 1.87 eV and ELUMOs of around −3.40 eV, which were similar to those of f-BTI2-FT. When x was 0.5 (BTI2-50TPD), the cell that used PTB7-Th as the p-type polymer gave the highest VOC of 1.05 V among these polymers, which resulted in a small Eloss of 0.53 eV. The EQEmax in the absorption range for BTI2-50TPD was approximately 60%, which should be fairly high for small-Eloss cell, leading to a relatively high PCE of 8.3%.
A copolymer based on bipyridine in which two pyridine moieties are bridged with a boron–nitrogen coordination bond, P-BNBP-fBT (Fig. 10), was also reported to show a small Eloss when blended with PTB7-Th.152 P-BNBP-fBT had an Eg and an ELUMO of 1.86 and −3.62 eV, respectively, and thus the ΔEL was found to be 0.18 eV. The PTB7-Th/P-BNBP-fBT cell exhibited a PCE of 6.3% with a high VOC of 1.07 V, and thereby an Eloss of as small as 0.51 eV.
6.2. Narrow-bandgap n-type polymers
Most of the n-type polymers with narrow bandgaps are based on naphthalenediimide (NDI).145 Since early studies of all-polymer solar cells, copolymers consisting of NDI and bithiophene, named P(NDI2OD-2T) or N2200 (Fig. 11a),153,154 have been the common n-type polymers. The Eg, EHOMO, and ELUMO for N2200 were reported to be typically around 1.45 eV, −5.4 to −5.5 eV, and −3.8 to −3.9 eV, respectively. A number of p-type polymers have been blended with N2200. Ito and co-workers showed that a PTB7-Th/N2200 blend gave 5.7% PCE and 0.81 V VOC, resulting in an Eloss of 0.64 eV.155 They also reported that a blend of N2200 with p-type polymer PTQ1 (Fig. 11b) provided a PCE of 4.1% and a VOC of 0.84 V, and thus an Eloss of 0.61 eV.156 Yang and co-workers utilized derivatives of PTQ1 in which the quinoxaline moiety was fluorinated, i.e., TQ-F and TQ-FF (Fig. 11b), in combination with N2200.157 Due to the deep EHOMOs for TQ-F and TQ-FF, the TQ-F/N2200 and TQ-FF/N2200 cells showed improved VOCs of 0.84 and 0.94 V, respectively, relative to the PTQ1/N2200 cell that showed a VOC of 0.82 V in this report. As a result, the TQ-F and TQ-FF cells had Elosss of 0.61 and 0.51 eV, respectively, although the TQ-F cell showed a higher PCE of 7.3% than the TQ-FF cell of 4.14%. Wang and co-workers reported an N2200-based all-polymer cell with a BDT-quinoxaline copolymer, PBDT-DFQX1 (Fig. 11b).158 This system gave a VOC of 0.89 V, and thus an Eloss of 0.56 eV, and a PCE of 6.7%. In addition, Huang and co-workers showed that the use of a copolymer of BDT and the imide-functionalized benzotriazole unit, PTzBI-Si (Fig. 11b), afforded an Eloss of 0.59 eV.141 The cell demonstrated 11% PCE, which is markedly high for all-polymer cells. It is noted that although the EQE was around 70% at the absorption of PTzBI-Si, it was limited to around 50% at the absorption of N2200.
Jenekhe and co-workers synthesized a series of NDI-selenophene copolymers, BSSx (Fig. 11a), by changing the contents of the selenophene and biselenophene co-units.159 Increasing the selenophene content slightly widened Eg from 1.40 eV for BBS0 to 1.45 eV for both BBS10 and BBS20, and to 1.49 eV for BBS50. The cell that used PBDB-T as the p-type polymer showed the highest PCE of 10.1% for BBS10, among these polymers, with a VOC of 0.86 V, resulting in an Eloss of 0.59 eV. As similar to the PTzBI-Si/N2200 cell, although a high EQEmax of more than 80% was observed at around 600 nm, this should correspond to the absorption of PBDB-T, i.e., the hole transfer from PBDB-T to BBS10, where ΔEH was a sufficiently large value of ∼0.6 eV. On the other hand, the EQE around 700 nm, corresponding to the absorption of BBS10, was limited to 50%, although ΔEH was still as large as ∼0.5 eV.
Interestingly, n-type polymers incorporating “NFA” as the building unit were reported to show high PCEs in the all-polymer cells. Li and co-workers reported the synthesis of IDIC-based polymer PZ1 (Fig. 11a),160 which had an Eg of 1.55 eV and an EHOMO of −5.74 eV, and thereby a ΔEH of approximately 0.4 eV when PBDB-T was employed as the p-type polymer. Note that the Eg and the energy levels of PZ1 were shifted only slightly with respect to those of IDIC. This might originate in the fact that the π-conjugation is not fully developed along the backbone, or non-regularly polymerized IDIC units, which results in regio-isomeric components. Nevertheless, the PBDB-T/PZ1 cell showed as high as 9.2% PCE with a VOC of 0.83 V, resulting in an Eloss of 0.72 eV. Yan and co-workers synthesized a copolymer of IDIC by incorporating a BDT moiety as the co-unit, PFBDT-IDTIC (Fig. 11a), which provided an Eg of 1.62 eV and an EHOMO of −5.78 eV.161 When PBDB-TF was employed as the p-type polymer, ΔEH was approximately 0.3 eV. The PBDB-TF/PFBDT-IDTIC cell gave a VOC of 0.97 V, which resulted in an Eloss of 0.66 eV, and a PCE of 10.3%. Zhang and co-workers reported the synthesis of a similar polymer incorporating an IDTT moiety, PN1 (Fig. 11a).162 The Eg and the EHOMO of PN1 were 1.55 eV and −5.71 eV, respectively, resulting in a ΔEH of 0.21 eV with respect to PBDB-TF. The PBDB-TF/PN1 cell showed a VOC of 1.0 V and thus an Eloss of 0.55 eV, and a high PCE of 10.5%. Interestingly, the EQE curve of the cell was mostly flattened at around 60%, indicating that PN1 underwent charge generation similarly to PBDB-TF despite having a significantly smaller ΔEH than ΔEL. Huang and co-workers reported a TPBT-based polymer PJ1 (Fig. 11a), which had an Eg of 1.40 eV.163 When PJ1 was blended with PBDB-T, the ΔEH was around 0.3 eV. The cell showed a very high EQEmax of 80% and a high PCE of 14.4%, which was the highest value for all-polymer cells, with an Eloss of 0.51 eV.
6.3. Summary
In this section, we discussed the Eloss for all-polymer solar cells, in particular, by focusing on the n-type polymers, because it seemed that the reduction of Eloss in the all-polymer solar cells was mainly due to the development of n-type polymers. The molecular structures of the n-type polymers are relatively limited, in which imide-functionalized building units are typically incorporated. In the n-type polymers with both wide and narrow bandgaps, small Eloss values of less than 0.6 eV were achieved in many cases. Further, high efficiencies of more than 10% were reported in particular for all-polymer solar cells with narrow-bandgap n-type polymers based on the NDI moiety. It is noted that, however, high EQE was specifically observed in the absorption range of the p-type polymers, and the EQE at the n-type polymers was limited. This means that the charge generation from the exciton of the narrow-bandgap n-type polymers is still insufficient. One of the reasons may be that N2200 or NDI-based polymers typically have a low absorption coefficient of the order of 104 cm−1.155 Recently, narrow-bandgap n-type polymers, in which DCM-end-capped NFA were used as the building unit, have shown to afford small Eloss values simultaneously with high EQEmax and thus PCE values. This is probably due to the same reason as mentioned in the narrow-bandgap polymers and NFAs sections.
7. Summary and outlook
We reviewed organic semiconductors and p/n blends that have resulted in small Eloss values for OPVs. In all the blend systems, including polymer/fullerene, polymer/non-fullerene, and polymer/polymer systems, Eloss was successfully reduced to below 0.6 eV, which had been considered the minimum value for OPVs, owing to the development of new π-conjugated materials that have led to a small ΔEH or ΔEL. In fact, an even smaller Eloss of around 0.5 eV, which is comparable to that for inorganic PVs, was reported for all the blend systems. This was realized by the fine tuning of frontier orbital energy levels through the design and engineering of the molecular structures of the organic semiconductors, and the optimization of the combination of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors. In fact, efficient charge generation was realized despite the fact that ΔEH or ΔEL was very small. Moreover, high EQE was observed even at nearly zero ΔEH or ΔEL, i.e., negligible driving-force energy. In particular, wide-bandgap polymer/narrow-bandgap NFA systems have higher tendency to give a small Eloss with a high EQE so far, yet the reason is still unclear. Apparently, a common feature in terms of molecular structure for the materials that have enabled efficient charge generation under a small Eloss may be the highly π-extended molecular structure based on large fused heteroaromatic rings and highly ordered structure in the blend film. Thus, such a molecular design might be a key factor for realizing further high performance.
On the other hand, more recently, studies on qΔVnr in OPVs have also been making progress, although reports regarding the design of π-conjugated materials for reducing the qΔVnr are still limited: qΔVnr can now be reduced even below 0.2 eV.22,126 One most possible explanation for such a small qΔVnr is that hybridization of LE and CT states, due to the close LE and CT states in energy, would enhance the CT emission and thus the EQEEL of the OPV cells. This is partly because the PL quantum efficiency is typically high because molecular structures are relatively rigid owing to their fused-ring backbone. We should note that such a small energetic difference between LE and CT states, that is ΔE, might, however, give rise to the reduction of the charge generation efficiency and in turn the photovoltaic EQE. Thus, the LE–CT hybridization also closely relates to the minimization of ΔE. Designing organic semiconductors by incorporating a more fluorescent chromophore and/or a rigid extended fused ring into the molecular structure might realize efficient CT emission simultaneously with efficient charge generation.
Although the Eloss for OPVs has been significantly reduced while showing efficient charge generation, the smallest Eloss values for OPVs are still larger by approximately 0.1 eV compared with those for inorganic and perovskite PVs. Additional strategy for further reducing the Eloss is minimizing the loss from radiative recombination (qΔVr). The qΔVr values for OPVs are typically 0.2–0.6 eV, and are much larger than those for inorganic and perovskite PVs, which have the values of around 0.01 eV or even less.47 Note that we here discuss qΔVr on the basis of Eg, thus ΔE is included in qΔVr. As mentioned in Introduction (Fig. 2c), qΔVr consists of two radiation losses above and below Eg (qΔVr1 and qΔVr2). In fact, the qΔVr2 can be minimized, while the qΔVr1 is inevitable even in the SQ limit. As the qΔVr2 is partly due to the CT absorption in OPVs, it can be reduced with bringing ECT closer to Eg, i.e., with minimizing ΔE. However, even though ΔE is negligible, the qΔVr2 for OPVs still remains larger than that for inorganic and perovskite PVs,15 due to an absorption tail originating from thermal and/or structural disorder in materials, which can be quantified as Urbach energy (EU). Thus, qΔVr2 should be further reduced if a blend of organic semiconductors has a small EU. It is noted that EU values for organic semiconductors are typically more than 40 meV,164 which are significantly larger than those for inorganic semiconductors that are as small as 10 meV.165 As described in the ESI (Fig. S3†), the qΔVr2 would be <0.01 eV when EU is around 10 meV, being consistent with the values for inorganic and perovskite PVs, but it could be more than 0.5 eV when EU is >40 meV, though depending on the Eg. It is thus of particular importance to suppress the EU to less than the thermal energy (∼25 meV) in order to reduce qΔVr2: qΔVr2 would be 0.06–0.07 eV when EU is 25 meV. It is noted that in fact EUs as close as 25 meV have been reported for some high mobility π-conjugated polymers.164,166 Further, some efficient OPV systems with small Elosss have shown to have EU values of 25–27 meV.22,56
As a large number of materials have been developed so far in the area, further optimization of the combination with already available materials could yield even higher performance. Ternary blend cell, by the addition of a material with well-matched energetics with respect to the host binary blend, can also be a good strategy for reducing the Eloss while simultaneously increasing the photocurrent.167,168 Nevertheless, more in-depth exploration of π-conjugated materials based on large π-extended fused rings, specifically those having higher PL efficiency and/or less structural disorder, is warranted. On the other hand, the fundamental mechanisms of the interactions of the p-type and n-type π-conjugated materials at the interface must be studied to facilitate the charge generation under negligible driving-force energy. As the issue for the Eloss is directly related to the issue for the PCE improvement in OPVs, it is imperative to take up additional challenges in materials development. We hope that this review will be of help to chemists and materials scientists who are involved in the design of π-conjugated materials and blends with an eye toward highly efficient OPVs.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Plots of qVOCversus Eg, and (b) plots of maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) versus Eloss (Eg − qVOC), (c) plots of power conversion efficiency versus Eloss (Eg − qVOC) for polymer/fullerene (blue dots), polymer/non-fullerene (red dots), and polymer/polymer cells (green dots).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Energy level diagrams of pairs of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors and the working principle of OPVs, when the p-type material has a narrower bandgap (Eg) (left) and the n-type material has a narrower Eg (right). (b) Relationship between the input energy (Eg) and the energy of output voltage including the factors of voltage loss and VOC for inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics. Note that VB and CB are valence band and conduction band, respectively, and VSQ is the maximum voltage based on the SQ limit and Vr is the upper limit of the photovoltage when only the loss due to radiative recombination is present.53,54 (c) Relationship between the input energy based on the state energy (Jablonski) diagram of an organic semiconductor blend and output voltage energy for OPV. qVr,CT and qVr are the radiative recombination loss based on ECT and Eg, respectively. (b and c) Note that voltage loss due to current (JSC) loss is typically negligibly small and hence is ignored for simplicity here (see the ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 3  Different Eg determination methods. The step-functions (blue dash curves) are used as references for the absorptance or EQE (solid black curves) of real-word OSCs. (a) Eg is determined from the absorptance or EQE onset. (b) Eg is determined at the intersection between absorption (solid blue curve) and emission (solid red curve). (c) Eg is determined from the crossing point of extrapolated line of the EQE edge and horizontal tangent of the local peak. (d) Eg is determined from the inflection point of the EQE curve.
