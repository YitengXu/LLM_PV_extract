    , Accepted 14th September 2015First published on 18th September 2015AbstractThe relentless pursuit of new electrode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) has been conducted for decades. Structures with either porous or nanostructure configurations have been confirmed as advantageous candidates for energy storage/conversion applications. The integration of the two features into one structure can provide another chance to improve the electroactivities. Recently, single-phased mixed metal oxides (MMOs) containing different metal cations, in particular, have confirmed high electrochemical activities because of their complex chemical composition, interfacial effects, and the synergic effects of the multiple metal species. In this review, we will focus on recent research advances of MMOs with porous architectures as anode materials in the matter of structural arrangement and compositional manipulation. Moreover, the application of self-supported MMO-based porous structures as LIB anodes is also explained herein.

1. Introduction
Environment- and energy-related crises have already upset the development and hamper the modernization of society. To this end, the keen pursuit and enthusiastic exploration of green and sustainable energy resources and conversion systems, such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, solar cells and other advanced systems, are engaged in by the research and engineering community.1–5 Amongst them, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are typical representatives of rechargeable batteries, showing diverse, overwhelming superior properties, including a high energy density, low self-discharge, and small memory effect. Until now, they have been widely applied as portable power supplies in a broad range of electronic devices (phones, digital cameras, laptops, etc.). Nevertheless, due to the inherent restrictions of commercial electrode materials with low specific capacities, namely graphite (anode, 372 mA h g−1)6 and LiCoO2 (cathode, 272 mA h g−1), traditional electrode materials are unable to perfectly fulfill the increasing demands of energy power and density required by high-power apparatus and electric vehicles/hybrid electric vehicles.7,8 The operation mechanism, based on which LIBs work, is the movement of lithium ions through the membranes between two electrodes, whose physicochemical properties, to a large extent, determine the behaviour of the final batteries. Therefore, there are urgent targets to identify more promising electrode materials to realize high-performance LIBs.
In total, as per the lithiation/delithiation processes,9 anode materials for LIBs, in the main, can be divided into three distinct groups: intercalation–deintercalation, alloying–dealloying and redox conversion.10 Recently, by comparison with the first two families, transition metal oxides are explored extensively because of their high theoretical capacity, generally higher than 600 mA h g−1 (for example, 890 mA h g−1 for Co3O4,7 1232 mA h g−1 for MnO2,11 978 mA h g−1 for ZnO,12 718 mA h g−1 for NiO,13 906 mA h g−1 for MnCo2O4,14 1007 mA h g−1 for Fe2O315 and 716 mA h g−1 for CoO16). In particular, single-phased mixed metal oxides (MMOs) with different metal cations, stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric, have recently attracted considerable attention as potential anode materials for next-generation LIBs, such as ZnCo2O4,17 NiFe2O4,18 FeCo2O4,19 Co2Mo3O8,20 TiNb2O721 and ZnV2O4.22 In order to make our description more clear, herein, MMOs are identified as a family of single-phased ternary (or higher) metal oxides, also referred to elsewhere,23 while simple metal oxides (SMOs) are defined as a group of metal oxides composed of one kind of metal cation. The superior and special characteristics of a complex chemical composition, interfacial effects, and the synergic effects of multiple metal species make MMOs much more competitive than SMOs and contribute to an improvement in the electrochemical performance of the anodes in half cells. Moreover, MMOs are demonstrated to possess a much better electrical conductivity than their simple oxide counterparts.13,20
However, some stubborn issues still exist on the way to the realistic usage of MMOs as anodes, as discussed below. Firstly, during repeated charge–discharge cycles, large volume deformation persists and leads to fast capacity fading and thus an undesired cycling stability.24 Secondly, sluggish lithium diffusion can't satisfy the demands of conversion reactions and the capacity can't be retained, especially at higher current densities, with the result that the rate capability afforded is always formidably unsatisfactory. Thirdly, most of the studied MMOs are recognized as semiconductors in nature. The relatively low electronic conductivity can't keep pace with energy storage at higher rate environments. Hence, the rational construction and elegant regulation of anode materials direct many efforts in designing and developing multifunctional materials with favourable structural features.
Correspondingly, effective measures have been taken to overcome the above situations. The realization of porous complex micro/nanostructures is considered as one of the proposed strategies, wherein nanosized building blocks organize into micro or nanosized architectures or nanocrystals connect together via crystallite bridges with the formation of interparticle and/or intraparticle voids. High porosity can benefit the relief of structural stress and buffer the volume variation originating from the multiple redox reactions.25–27 The sufficient infiltration of the electrolyte into the electrode materials can also be boosted through the presence of pores.28–30 The primary nanoparticles/crystals endow the architectures with a higher specific surface area to encourage more contact between the electrode and electrolyte, favouring a capacity improvement. What's more, nanoscaled structures can shorten the diffusion path of Li+, which is one of the main factors influencing the capacity retention of anodes at higher rates. A series of porous MMOs with different hierarchies have been reported as potential anode materials for new-generation LIBs, such as mesoporous nanowire arrays,31,32 porous nanorods,33,34 nanobelts,35 3D wall arrays,36 nanosheets,37 nanocubes,38 microspheres,39 nanocages40 and so on. The elegant hybridization of electrode materials with current collectors by directly growing electroactive materials on other conductive substrates can offer a further improvement of the electrochemical properties.36 The acquired preponderant performance is mainly pertinent to the powerful cohesion between them, diminishing the inner resistance and facilitating the conveyance of electrons.
In this review, our topic concentrates on the recent progress in porous micro-/nano-metered hierarchical structures of MMOs and their advanced hybrid anode materials. We mainly overview and discuss the configuration design and the corresponding effect on the enhancement of the electrochemical properties mentioned recently. According to their chemical composition, the MMO materials are summarized in the sequence of metal cobaltites, metal manganates, metal ferrites, metal stannates, metal vanadates and other MMOs. In light of several articles9,23 already referring to the electrochemical behaviour of MMOs, our article will instead introduce the synthetic methodologies and highlight the formation mechanism of the precursors involved and the morphological transformations related to the resultant MMOs. Finally, some challenges and expectations for anode materials will be provided.
2. Porous architecture of MMOs
Excitingly, integration with nanosize-induced effects brought about further developments in MMO-based anodes for LIBs.10 In this regard, various nanostructures have been reported with the aim of tuning the electrochemical properties, involving nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, nanoflakes and nanohedra. The size and morphology-dependent effects of nanomaterials affects the related adjustment of nanostructures for anode materials. The larger contact area with the electrolyte facilitates lithium ions in going through the electrode/electrolyte interfaces at a higher rate. However, one coin has two faces, and the higher surface energy causes the nanoparticles to aggregate, which is unfavourable for the electrolyte penetration and causes a rapid loss of capacity. By comparison, porous micro/nanostructures exhibit their own dominance of firm organization and effectively attenuate the aggregation of the nanobuilding blocks during the lithiation and delithiation reactions. As a result, the hierarchical configuration of MMOs is engineered to modify the electrochemical behaviours and attain materials that are qualified for LIB applications.
Spinel-structured oxides with the general formula of AB2O4, such as LiMn2O4 as the cathode or binary oxide Mn[Mn]2O4 as the anode, exhibit noticeable crystal structure merits as LIB electrode materials.41 Oxygen anions stack in closed cubic patterns, with the A cations located in one-eighth tetrahedral sites and the B cations sitting in half octahedral sites. The interstitial spaces surrounded by the octahedra interconnect into three dimensions, accommodating guest ions, i.e. lithium ions, here. Co3O4, Fe3O4 and Mn3O4 are characteristic spinel oxides, whose derivatives afford good anode materials of cobaltites, ferrites, and manganates, wherein alien ions partially replace the original host metal ions.42,43
2.1 M–Co–O
Comparative research on transition metal oxides suggests that cobalt oxides have the best electrochemical properties as anodes but the shortcomings of Co3O4 are that it is highly toxic and expensive and has a high redox potential (2.2–2.4 V vs. Li+/Li) for Co, restricting their broad application.44 Many attempts have been carried out to find excellent counter-ions of Co aiming at developing eco-friendly and less expensive metals for low cost and green anode materials.45–49 Pioneering research identified ideal candidates to be elements that are electrochemically active against Li metal without the sacrifice of reducing the specific capacity,46,50 such as Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Mn to form MCo2O4 (denoted as M–Co–O). Recently, we have designed a general polyol-assisted prefabrication route combined with calcination treatment to synthesize a series of hierarchical ZnCo2O4, MnCo2O4, Mn1.5Co1.5O4 and NiCo2O4 microstructures.14,45,51–53 Notably, ZnCo2O4 has been chosen as one promising candidate for anode materials for LIBs mainly because it can store Li+ through not only the conversion reaction but also the alloying–dealloying process:50,54,55ZnCo2O4 + 8Li+ + 8e → Zn + 2Co + 4Li2OZn + Li+ + e− ↔ LiZnZn + Li2O ↔ ZnO + 2Li+ + 2e−2Co + 2Li2O ↔ 2CoO + 4Li+ + 4e−2CoO + 2/3Li2O ↔ 2/3Co3O4 + 4/3Li+ + 4/3e−
Porous ZnCo2O4 twin microspheres and microcubes are controllably fabricated by changing the amount of NH4HCO3 in the solvothermal synthesis.45 NH4HCO3 was chosen as the precipitant that could precisely control the morphology of the products, which could be due to the different reaction pressure and reaction dynamics of the present system. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, FESEM images display uniform ZnCo2O4 twin microspheres with a size range of about 2.5–3.0 μm and microcubes with an average diameter of 2.0 μm built from nanosized primary nanoparticles. When evaluated as anodes, they both offer an excellent ultralong cycling stability and rate performance (Fig. 1C and D). Even though the tests last for 2000 cycles, higher than the commercialization standard of 400–1200 cycles, the reversible specific capacity can be retained as 550 mA h g−1 for the twin microspheres and 478 mA h g−1 for the microcubes at a current density of 5 A g−1. Furthermore, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) is around 99%, demonstrating the higher reversibility of the electrochemical reactions. The ample pores among the independent nanoparticles provide channels for the electrolyte to react fully with the active materials, resulting from the acquisition of a high specific capacity. At the same time, the volume expansion/contraction of the materials can be buffered, avoiding the pulverization that would otherwise occur. The observation of a stable capacity during the 2000 cycles affirms the integrity of the microspheres and microcubes. These experimental data imply a much more advantageous configuration for microstructures that are orderly organized by nanoparticles. As displayed in Fig. 1E, yolk–shelled ZnCo2O4 microspheres51 have a better capacity performance with sodium carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC) (331 mA h g−1) than with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (202 mA h g−1) as binder when tested at the rate of 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 1F), due to the stronger stabilization ability of CMC than PVDF.

In related work, 1D porous ZnCo2O4 nanowires,56 whose porous texture can be tuned by the calcination temperature, have been controllably fabricated by the microemulsion method. The results revealed that the ZnCo2O4 nanowires at 500 °C exhibit an improved specific capacity over that at 700 °C, due to the higher specific surface area of 68.86 rather than 35.99 m2 g−1. Furthermore, 3D ZnCo2O4 microspheres with different interior structures have been reported and core–shell microspheres exhibited better electrochemical behaviour than solid and hollow microspheres.57 In addition, ZnxCo3−xO4 (0 < x < 1) with different non-stoichiometric compositions, has been fabricated by Wu and co-workers.58 Porous ZnxCo3−xO4 hollow polyhedra assembled from nanosized building blocks showed an excellent cyclic capacity retention and as high as 990 mA h g−1 can be retained up to 50 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1.
As shown in Fig. 2(A1–A5), our group also studied the structure-dependent electrochemical properties of MnCo2O4 microspheres.14 Attributed to the heterogeneous contraction aroused by the non-equilibrium heat process, various MnCo2O4 with well-defined textures are finalized, including hollow spheres, yolk–shell spheres, shell-in-shell spheres and yolk-in-double-shell spheres. Systematic detections of those structures with respect to the electrochemical properties were done and yolk–shell spheres had the best cycling stability (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the fabrication of multiporous MnCo2O4 (Fig. 2C) and CoMn2O4 (Fig. 2D) quasi-hollow microspheres by topotactic chemical transformations from the corresponding precursors has been achieved.59 Notably, the MnCo2O4 microspheres could deliver a reversible capacity as high as 610 mA h g−1 at a higher current density of 400 mA g−1 with good electrochemical stability after 100 cycles (Fig. 2K). Because MnCo2O4 microspheres possess the appropriate pore size distribution and can effectively alleviate the volume change during the repeated Li+ insertion/extraction. In particular, non-stoichiometric Mn1.5Co1.5O4 has also been investigated with a core–shell microsphere morphology53 (Fig. 2E). When tested as electrode materials, the discharge capacity is 618 mA h g−1 (90% of the theoretical capacity) after 300 cycles at 400 mA g−1 because of the profitable porosity and core–shell architecture (Fig. 2F). Likewise, mesoporous flake-like MnCo2O4 was reported to retain a reversible capacity of 952 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles.60

Other porous MMO structures with complex configurations were fabricated and reported as anode materials. Recently, the Wang group reported mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets with a high specific area and a high reversible capacity of 891 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, which could be attributed to the advantageous porous structure.61 3D NiCo2O4 microflowers assembled from nanoflakes exhibited a 952 mA h g−1 capacity at 100 mA g−1 after 60 cycles and 720 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 100 cycles.62 Chowdari's group63 reported the application of CuCo2O4 for the anode of LIBs for the first time. Following that, different CuCo2O4 microstructures have been designed to exploit the electrochemical properties extensively. Both uncoupled and coupled CuCo2O4 mesoporous crystalline materials48 have been controllably fabricated by the nanocasting strategy with mesoporous silica KIT-6 as the hard template. The former structure, in which a large fraction of micropores connect two kinds of mesopore systems, was observed to have better Li storage behaviour, offering a higher initial discharge capacity of 1564 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 900 mA h g−1 after the 6th cycle, due to its larger pore size, higher surface area and pore volume.
Obviously, the features of morphological texture, chemical composition, pore size distribution and surface area of the micro/nanostructures are important factors that have a significant influence on the electrochemical performance of the MMOs from the above description, and can be controlled deliberately via the adjustment of the synthetic parameters involved during the synthesis processes. As explained above, these porous architectures contribute to the enormous enhancement of the electrochemical performance, which further confirms the feasibility of improving material properties through rational construction.
2.2 M–Mn–O
In comparison to cobalt-based oxides, manganese oxides are non-toxic, abundant on earth and inexpensive. Furthermore, Mn-based anodes have a lower lithium extraction potential (1.3–1.5 V vs. Li+/Li)64 than Co-based materials, which renders metal manganites with excellent competitiveness. Chen’s group synthesized 3D CoMn2O4 microspheres with porous structures which achieved a discharge capacity of 894 mA h g−1 at a current of 200 mA g−1 after 65 cycles (see Fig. 3A–C).65 The reactions during the charge–discharge process of CoMn2O4 (one member of the Mn-based oxides) are as follows:65CoMn2O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → Co + 2Mn + 4Li2OCo + 2Mn + 3Li2O ↔ CoO + 2MnO + 6Li+ + 6e−

Lou’s group have designed hollow MMn2O4 with different hierarchical structures and studied the Li+ storage behaviours.63,65,66 Double-shelled CoMn2O4 hollow microcubes have been prepared via a facile co-precipitation combined with subsequent annealing method.66 The average size is ∼2 μm and the white arrows indicate the inner shells (shown in Fig. 3D and E). When tested as an anode for LIBs, it manifests a reversible capacity of about 624 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, ZnMn2O4 ball-in-ball hollow microspheres with a uniform size distribution were designed via a template-free method (Fig. 3G and H).67 Due to the unique hollow ball-in-ball microsphere structure, the ZnMn2O4-based anode shows excellent electrochemical properties (Fig. 3I) so that after 120 cycles at 400 mA g−1 a discharge capacity of 750 mA h g−1 was displayed. Zn is more ecofriendly and economical than Ni/Co. It has a low oxidation potential (i.e., delithiation potential) of 1.2 V, which eventually enhances the full battery output voltage. More importantly, electrochemically active Zn can store Li+ by alloying–de-alloying. These appealing merits attract the attention of researchers to the design and synthesis of ZnMn2O4 as an electrode material for LIBs.68 Notably, our group successfully prepared ZnMn2O4 and CoMn2O4 twin microspheres by the combined process of triethylene/ethylene glycol-assisted solvothermal calcination.69,70 As shown in Fig. 2J and K, the diameter of the ZnMn2O4 twin microspheres is around 1.0 μm and it is composed of many nanoparticle subunits. Fig. 3L reveals that the reversible capacity of 860 mA h g−1 is kept after cycling 130 times at a current density of 500 mA g−1. In particular, the current density returns to 200 mA g−1 after the higher rate test at 5 A g−1 and the capacity remains stable up to about 1084 mA h g−1 even after 190 cycles.69 Similar CoMn2O4 twin microspheres have a stable cycling performance with a high CE, wherein it still retains a reversible capacity of 890 mA h g−1 and has nearly 100% capacity retention during more than 70 cycles. After a rate test at 2 A g−1, the capacity can recover to as high as 908 mA h g−1, even during 120 cycles, without any loss.70

2.3 M–Fe–O
Similar to cobalt-based oxides and Mn-based oxides, Fe-based oxides, as another outstanding member of the spinel MMO family, have also been considered as a promising anode material for LIBs, because of their cost-effectiveness, and high specific capacity (913 mA h g−1 for CoFe2O471 and 1072 mA h g−1 for ZnFe2O472). Designing Fe-based MMOs with complex architectures is necessary for overcoming drawbacks such as a poor capacity retention and noticeable volume change during Li+ lithiation/delithiation. ZnFe2O4 is superior to other Fe-based oxides in that it has a high capacity due to the alloy–dealloy-induced excess Li+ storage capability of Zn mentioned before. Moreover, ZnFe2O4 can effectively lower the working potential (1.5 V vs. Li+/Li), compared with α-Fe2O3 (∼2.1 V vs. Li+/Li), possibly due to a synergetic effect between the Zn and Fe ions.73–75 In order to further enhance the performance of ZnFe2O4, many efforts have been carried out. ZnFe2O4 yolk–shell structures with core/void/shell configurations have been synthesized via the spray-drying method at 450 °C in the presence of dextrin.76 Yolk–shell ZnFe2O4 is clearly observed from Fig. 4a and b and the elemental mapping images indicate a uniform distribution of Zn, Fe and O (Fig. 4c). The comparative electrochemical properties of different ZnFe2O4 structures obtained at a current density of 500 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. 4d. Yolk–shell ZnFe2O4 exhibited a higher discharge capacity, 862 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, than both the filled ZnFe2O4 and yolk–shell counterparts treated at 350 and 400 °C. In addition, 1D porous ZnFe2O4 nanofibers77 have been synthesized via the electrospinning technique, demonstrating excellent cyclability and retaining a reversible capacity of 733 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 60 mA g−1.
As other members of Fe-based MMOs, MnFe2O4,78–80 NiFe2O4,81,82 CoFe2O4,83–86 MgFe2O487,88 and CuFe2O489,90 have also been researched as anode materials for LIBs. The reactions during the charge and discharge process of NiFe2O4 (one member of Fe-based oxides) are as follows:82NiFe2O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → Ni + 2Fe + 4Li2ONi + Li2O ↔ NiO + 2Li+ + 2e−2Fe + 3Li2O ↔ Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e−
Xu’s group has achieved a series of Fe-based oxides with ball-in-ball hollow spheres (including CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4 and CdFe2O4) by a hydrothermal and subsequent calcination scheme.18 The electrochemical performance of the CoFe2O4 electrodes using CMC as binder is better than that using PVDF as binder, which is consistent with the previous reports.51,91 Furthermore, MnFe2O4 microrods with a surface area of 24.83 m2 g−1 have been successfully prepared by Wang and co-workers,92 revealing a high reversible capacity of 630 mA h g−1 up to 1000 cycles at the current density of 1 A g−1. These results further certify that porous M–Fe–O consisting of nanoscaled primary particles are beneficial for enhancing the performance of anode materials for LIBs.
2.4 M–Sn–O
Sn-based oxides have attracted great interest for a broad range of potential applications originating from their attractive properties, including gas sensing,93 photovoltaic,94 electrical and optical properties.95–97 In particular, MSnO3 and spinel M2SnO4 have been recently thought of as prospective anode materials for LIBs,98,99 which is thanks to their low potential (1.0 V vs. Li/Li+) and high theoretical capacity. The Li+ storage is based on the combined process of conversion and alloying–dealloying reactions. Taking Zn2SnO4 as an example, the reactions during the charge–discharge process are as follows:100,1014Li+ + Zn2SnO4 + 4e− → Sn + 2Li2O + 2ZnO8Li+ + Zn2SnO4 + 8e− → 2Zn + Sn + 4Li2OxLi+ + Sn + xe− ↔ LixSn (0 ≤ 4.4)yLi+ + Zn + ye− ↔ LiyZn (y ≤ 1)
Zn2SnO4 octahedra decorated with nanoplates show a high initial discharge capacity of 1626.9 mA h g−1 and maintain 642.2 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 20 cycles.100 Hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes were fabricated by an alkaline etching method and subsequent calcination process.101 The electrochemical performance of hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes (540 mA h g−1) is better than solid Zn2SnO4 cubes (395 mA h g−1) after 45 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g−1, which can be attributed to a larger specific surface area and porosity, which enhances the penetration of electrolytes, and a hollow interior, which buffers the volume effects during the repeated charge–discharge process. ZnSnO3 is isostructural to LiNbO3, constructed by arrangements of ZnO6 and SnO6 octahedron units. As Li+ insertion/extraction processes are accompanied by volume changes, serious pulverization and aggregation restrict its practical application. Thus, it is a challenge to design and construct a unique structure to defeat this drawback of ZnSnO3. Regular ZnSnO3 nanocubes and nanosheets from smaller nanocrystals102 were fabricated via a dual-hydrolysis-assisted liquid precipitation and subsequent hydrothermal treatment. After 50 cycles, the capacity of the nanosheets had decreased by only 38.4%, in contrast to a decrease of 77.5% for the capacity of the nanocubes, which can pertain to the differences in structural configuration. Similar to Zn–Sn–O, CoSnO3 and Co2SnO4 have been investigated as anode materials for LIBs. Co2SnO4 nanocrystals obtained via hydrothermal treatment103 showed an improved electrochemical activity over their bulky counterparts, demonstrating the benefits of nanostructures over bulk materials originating from the higher surface area, more active sites and the short Li+ transportation distance. But the cyclability is not satisfactory, with a capacity retention of only 50.3% after 50 cycles at a current density of 30 mA g−1. During repeated cycles, nanocrystals are inclined to aggregate and thus the capacity decayed fast.
Ca is inactive to Li, which can't increase the specific capacity of CaSnO3. The reaction process with Li+ proceeds as follows:CaSnO3 + 4Li+ + 4e− → CaO + 2Li2O + Sn4.4Li+ + 4.4e− + Sn ↔ 4Li4.4Sn
However, inactive materials, here CaO, serve as a matrix of uniform distribution not only buffering the volume variation but also inhibiting the conglomeration of active materials during cycling, engendering an enhanced cycling stability. CaSnO3 with different structures, such as a flower-like arrangement104 and porous nanotubes,105 had been prepared and studied as anode materials. Egg-roll-like CaSnO3 nanotubes (denoted as CSO-NTs) have been obtained through a simple electrospinning approach combined with calcination in air.106 Porous CSO-NTs with an average diameter of ∼560 nm and a length over 20 μm are obviously observed from FESEM images (Fig. 5a–c). A TEM image (Fig. 5f) was obtained that displayed a hollow tube-like morphology with a wall thickness of about 109 nm. CaSnO3 nanorods (CSO-NRs) were obtained with an average diameter of 380 nm and a length up to several micrometers, as shown in Fig. 5d, e and g. As displayed in Fig. 5h and i, CSO-NTs as the anode material for LIBs show a better cycling and rate performance than CSO-NRs, which is owing to the hollow interior space exhibited in CSO-NTs.

2.5 M–V–O
V-based oxides, M–V–O, a promising group of MMOs due to their intrinsic characteristics, have been researched in many fields, including as catalysts for water oxidation,107 photocatalysis,108 and oxygen evolution reactions.109 Since Idota110 opened a new research avenue toward Li–vanadate-based negative electrodes, a series of crystalline and amorphous cobalt-based vanadates have been reported by Tarascon’s group, such as RVO4 (R = In, Cr, Fe, Al, Y),111 β-Co(VO3)2·2H2O, Co3(VO4)2·12H2O,112 FeVO4·1.1H2O113 and Co2V2O7·3.3H2O as well as Co2V2O7.114 At the same time, the preliminary analysis and investigation on the mechanism of Li+ uptake/removal were carried out and a mechanism was proposed. In addition, we can observe that the problem of capacity fading is serious during the charge–discharge process and should be addressed. Many efforts have been carried out correspondingly in terms of vanadates with different counter-ions and the synthesis of functional compositions or architectures, including FeVO4 nanosheet arrays,115 ZnV2O6 nanowires,116 MnV2O6 nanobelts,117 Co2V2O7 hexagonal microplatelets,118 NiV3O8/Ni composites,119 and NiV3O8–natural graphite composites.120 Recently, Wang and co-workers have prepared a porous Co3V2O8 multilayered architecture constructed from the self-assembly of ultrathin nanosheets,121 exhibiting a reversible capacity of 1114 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1. Multilayered nanosheets exposed much more surface from the continuous peeling of hexagonal blocks and could greatly facilitate lithium ion diffusion and electronic transportation, thus leading to a superior rate stability. More importantly, the reactivity kinetics toward lithium intercalations and the theoretical capacity were systematically explained by the detection of intermediates during cycles. Co3V2O8 + xLi+ + xe− → 3CoO + LixV2O5(1) CoO + LixV2O5 + (y + 2)Li+ + (y + 2)e− ↔ Co + Li2O + Lix+yV2O5(2)(2)
During the first discharge, the crystal structure of Co3V2O8 was irreversibly destroyed via the redox conversion reactions, followed by the reduction of CoO into metallic Co proceeding in the amorphous Lix+yV2O5 matrix and a later reversible transformation from Co into CoO as well as further lithiation of lithium vanadates in the recharge process. Therefore, in the subsequent cycles, reaction (2) is responsible for the reversible capacity. From the above analysis, vanadium in vanadates has a vital role in storing/releasing lithium ions. Because of the difficulty in determining x and y in theory, the exact theoretical capacity can't be figured out. Actually, with respect to vanadates, the amorphization of pristine anode materials, such as MnV2O6122 and LiNiVO4,123 also happened as represented by analyses using ex situ or in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and others. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the oxidation states of vanadium and coexistent metals are not completely identical during discharge–charge reactions, possibly arising from the distinctive crystal structures of the vanadates, diverse metal species and the cutoff voltage for the discharge–charge cycles.124 The valence state of vanadium in MnV2O6 decreased from +5 to +2, while it decreased from +5 to +3 in α-CuV2O6 nanowires.125 In summary, the enhanced electrochemical performance is likely attributable to the unique structural configuration, such as the hollow structure or porous structure, and the synergistic effect of different metal cations or structures. It should be noted that most complex hollow structures have been prepared via templating strategies with soft surfactants or hard templates and the as-obtained products are mainly spherical. Multishelled Cu2S and Cu2O hollow spheres have been synthesized by the ion exchange method126 and multilamellar-micelle templating method,127 respectively, whereas non-spherical hollow structures with complex geometry solely from in situ selective inhibition of growth in certain planes haven't been reported to date. Our group have successfully prepared new phase Co3V2O8·nH2O with non-spherical structures and a complex geometry via hydrothermal treatment without adding any surfactant.128 As shown in Fig. 6A–L, it is obviously observed that the transformation of Co3V2O8·nH2O hexagonal prismatic pencils from a solid to a hollow structure was readily adjusted by increasing the amount of NaOH applied in the synthetic system. The electrochemical behaviours of the Co3V2O8·nH2O hollow hexagonal prismatic pencils (HHPPs) were investigated and the CV detection shows a homologous trend with Co3V2O8 multilayered nanosheets.121 The charge–discharge profiles of the 1st, 2nd, 60th, 100th, and 120th cycles for Co3V2O8·nH2O HHPPs at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 6M. The initial discharge and charge specific capacities are 1224 and 960 mA h g−1, respectively, and the moderate initial CE of 78% is higher than others reported.66,129 The discharge capacity fades to 815 mA h g−1 at the 60th cycle and then rises to 953 mA h g−1 at the 120th cycle. The corresponding rate capability of Co3V2O8·nH2O is studied at different current densities. As indicated in Fig. 6N, the average discharge capacities of the Co3V2O8·nH2O are 800, 596, 566, 534 and 496 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. After the current density returned to 2 A g−1, a discharge capacity of over 500 mA h g−1 could be recovered. In Fig. 6O, at 0.5 A g−1, the electrode indicates a good cycle performance and delivers a stable reversible capacity even for as many as 270 cycles.

KGaA.) 
2.6 Others
In addition to the above-mentioned ternary metal oxides, some other MMOs have been gradually reported, such as M2Mo3O8 (M = Co,20 Fe,130 Mn131), LiNb3O8,132 Zn2GeO4,133 Co2.85Si0.15O4134 and β-MgMoO4.135 Moreover, the lithiation and delithiation mechanism was examined in detail by both the Huang and Chowdari groups.130–133 LiNb3O8 and TiNb2O7136–138 have to be considered as possible candidates for Li4Ti5O12, as a result of the higher theoretical specific capacity (363, 387 and 175 mA h g−1 for LiNb3O8, TiNb2O7 and Li4Ti5O12,139 respectively) and the voltage plateau of Nb5+/Nb3+ (1.0 V–1.7 V)140,141 can eliminate the possible combustion of the electrolyte and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films during reactions with lithium ions. 3D-porous LiNbO3 has been synthesized through microwave-induced auto-combustion, showing an outstanding rate and cycle performance attributable to the rapid solid-state diffusion of Li+ throughout the hierarchical porous frameworks. Meanwhile, the Li+ diffusion path length and efficient electron transport through the anode/electrolyte interfaces also account for the pronounced lithium storage performance.142
3. Self-supported porous MMOs
As is known, the excellent performance benefits not only from the unique structure but also the intrinsic characteristics of the electrode materials, including the electrochemical activity and kinetics. So, it is very necessary to elegantly design the path of Li+/electrons from the exterior to the interior of electrode materials and the contact surface between the electrode and the electrolyte to improve the electrochemical performance of LIBs. Conventionally, the electrode was prepared by a slurry (active materials/binder/acetylene black with a certain mass ratio) coated on Cu foil (the current collector). Nonetheless, the exothermic reactions between the polymeric binder (e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF) and lithiated graphite or metallic Li can lead to thermal runaway, which is a safety concern for LIBs.143,144 The application of binder results in redundant mass and lowers the capacity of the entire electrode. Besides, the facial connection between the slurry and the Cu foil increases the transportation distance of electrons to the current collectors, which limits the long-term development of electrode materials to meet the demand of more power from less acreage. To address these issues, the route of directly constructing 3D electrode materials without any polymeric binder is effective for the preparation of advanced LIBs. The obtained composites integrate the electroactive materials and current collectors. According to the pattern features, the used substrates can be divided into non-porous and characteristically porous ones. In the former case, the substrates exhibit no porous profile and in most cases, architectural arrays composed of 1D or 2D nanostructures have been orderly grown onto substrates, wherein the voids amongst the building blocks were generated. In the latter case, the contact area between the active materials and current collectors is remarkably enlarged, which is strikingly beneficial for improvement of the electric conductivity of entire electrodes and the reduction of the transportation distance of electrons from the current collectors. Other than voids analogous to the above situation, the intrinsic porous structure of the substrates expedites the permeation of the electrolyte through the entire electrode. 3D porous substrates can provide a high surface area and a higher loading density of MMOs than conventional electrodes, and growing MMOs directly on a 2D substrate avoids the use of the mass of binder and acetylene black. Thus, a higher volume density per unit area was provided by the direct growth of MMOs on carbon paper or other 3D substrates as the anode materials than for the same size of conventional electrode materials. Until now, ample efforts have been concentrated on the development of such novel electrode materials, i.e., the generation of active materials on conductive substrates such as Ni foam, Cu/Ti foil, carbon cloth, and other nanocurrent collectors.
3.1 Macroporous substrates
Metal foams (e.g. Cu and Ni) have been considered as effective conductive collectors, because their features of myriad voids and a rough surface can effectively improve the cohesive bonding with and avoid the falling off of the collectors in the active materials. Lots of uses have been made of the synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) binary oxides for electrode materials on metal foam,32,36,145 which can enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials. Moreover, a viable strategy is also used to design functional electrode materials composed of MMOs formed on macroporous Ni foam for advanced LIBs.146,147 3D porous CoMoO4 and ZnCo2O4 nanostructure networks on nickel foam have been prepared via hydrothermal treatment by Fan and co-workers.148 The excellent performances of both for LIBs could be a benefit of the diverse porosity and more electroactive surface areas of the open-structured networks. Besides, Wang’s group investigated 3D porous NiCo2O4 nanosheet-derived nanowire cluster (NSWC) arrays149 which present a reversible capacity as high as 976 mA h g−1 at the current density of 200 mA g−1, and goose-feather-like ZnCo2O4 nanostructures on Ni foam (3D-ZCO-NSs/Ni),150 which showed a better performance (specific capacity of 932 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 1 A g−1) than a slurry-coated electrode composed of ZCO-NSs peeled off Ni foam. The structural advantages of 3D-ZCO-NSs/Ni are mainly ascribed to the orderly construction of a feather-like 3D hierarchy and immediate growth on the current collector. The branch-like configuration of the 3D hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the surface area and gives more access to Li+ in the electrolyte. Moreover, stalks of structures offer an efficient 1D transportation path for electrons, which facilitates the collection of current collectors. The void space of inter-nanostructures can accommodate the volume variation taking place during the Li+ uptake/removal reactions. On the contrary, the arrangement of nanostructures in the pasted electrode is random, giving rise to increased diffusion distances for electrons and Li+. The compact adhesion of active material to the current collector can't be ensured considering that volume and strain changes of the active material can loosen the contact with the binder along with the conductive additive. A series of advanced electrode materials composed of MMOs and various macroporous substrates including Ni and Cu foam have been fabricated by Zhang’s group.151–153 Prominently, flower-like ZnCo2O4 nanosheets with porous structures on Ni foam153 display a specific capacity of 639 mA h g−1 up to 500 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g−1 which could be thanks to a unique construction of tight adherence in the structure and much more electroactive sites.
Carbon cloth/carbon paper is another favourite porous conductive substrate for flexible LIBs, because of its distinct advantages, including elasticity and light weight, which can well satisfy the portability and convenience characteristics of flexible electronic devices, such as wearable devices and rollup/bendable displays or phones.154,155 Many efforts to design integrated flexible 3D electrode materials formed of active materials and carbon cloth have been reported.156 Shen’s group made lots of achievements in composites of MMOs and carbon cloth.157–160 MnCo2O4 nanosheet arrays have been grown on carbon cloth,157 which can retain the capacity of 3.0 mA h cm−2 over 60 cycles at a current density of 800 μA cm−2. Ca2Ge7O16 nanowire array–carbon textile composites158 exhibit a higher reversible capacity of ∼1100 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 300 mA g−1 than randomly distributed Ca2Ge7O16 nanowires and GeO2 powder coated on copper foil at a current density of 100 mA g−1. ZnCo2O4 urchins with a diameter of around 25 μm composed of nanowires were directly grown on carbon fiber cloth.159 When tested as anode materials, a discharge capacity as high as 900 mA h g−1 at 4.5 A g−1 is obtained. Even at a very high current density of 18 A g−1, the specific capacity of 750 mA h g−1 (2 times the theoretical capacity of graphite of 372 mA h g−1) was maintained after 100 cycles.
3.2 Non-porous substrates
Other than the above porous substrates, metal foils also prove to be wonderful current collectors for hybridizing MTMOs into electrodes,161–164 such as FeVO4 on stainless steel foil,105 Li4Ti5O12 nanosheet arrays165 and CoO–CoTiO3 core–shell nanotube arrays166 on Ti foil, and NiCo2O4 nanorod arrays on Cu foil.161 Hierarchical mesoporous CuxCo3−xO4 nanosheets have been directly grown on Ti foil by a facile hydrothermal method and a subsequent annealing treatment, exhibiting a high rate capability.162 Lou’s group picked stainless steel and Ti foil for the synthesis of hierarchical materials with tunable structures and compositions.167 The procured CoMn2O4 nanowire arrays and MnCo2O4 nanosheets grown on stainless steel foil exhibit excellent specific capacities of 450 and 460 mA h g−1, respectively, after 30 cycles at 800 mA g−1.
3.3 Nanostructure-patterned current collectors
The textured supporting materials including metal foams and carbon cloth mentioned above provide myriad loading sites for the growth of active materials when fabricating advanced composite electrodes. From the standpoint of size, the framework is all on a macrometer scale. The current collectors patterned by nanostructures, e.g. made up of carbon nanofibers,168,169 can have much more surface locations than macroscopic supports. Compared with the above substrates,170 nanostructure-patterned current collectors show a unique superiority due to the much larger surface area and better electrical conductivity as well as a boosted penetration of the electrolyte because of numerous nano-subunits and the more firm bonding of active materials.171,172 Cu nanorods on copper foil as a 3D current collector were applied to prepare composite nanocable arrays, wherein Cu–Si–Al2O3 displays a higher specific capacity than Cu–Si, especially under a high discharge and charge current density. After 100 cycles at a current density of 1.4 A g−1, Cu–Si–Al2O3 nanocables exhibit a specific capacity of ≈1560 mA h g−1, more than four times the theoretical capacity of graphite.173 Braun’s group synthesized NiOOH directly grown on porous nanopatterned nickel foam by electrodeposition,174 enabling the realization of a lithium-ion battery which can be 90% charged in 2 min. Nanostructure-patterned current collectors are superior to macroporous substrates and non-porous substrates for further improving the performance of LIBs, due to their own good conductivity, shortened ion diffusion distance in the nanosized subunits, much larger surface and increased energy density per unit area, which could further improve the performance of LIBs. Nanostructure-patterned current collectors are attracting increasing attention.
4. The synthetic methods and formation mechanism of porous MMOs
The synthesis of MMOs has been extensively studied in order to obtain high-performance electrode materials. Analogous to simple oxides, the one-step method via the hydro/solvothermal avenues to obtain MMOs, such as M3V2O8 (M = Ni or Co) based nanostructures is facile and direct.175–177 Alternatively, stepwise routes involve the synthesis and ensuing post-treatment of precursors, and are preferred in general. The post-treatment is actually a means to improve the quality of the precursors with regard to crystallization and purification and realize their chemical transformation into target materials. In particular, high-temperature calcination is effective and frequently used by researchers. The obtained MMOs can not only have the nature of high-quality crystallinity but also a typical porous structure introduced by the release of small molecules during the decomposition of the precursors. Moreover, the obtained MMOs feature primary building blocks in the nanosize, typical of micro/nanostructures. Here, we mainly introduce combined routes and give some discussion about the formation mechanism of the precursors and resultant MMOs.
4.1 (Co-)precipitation
Co-precipitation is a traditional method for preparing precursors to MMOs with different structures. In theory, the similar ionic radius of the cations and the crystalline nature of the respective deposits establish the basis for precipitation in solution by the same precipitants. Therefore, they have similar solubility product constants, enabling them to precipitate simultaneously,63 such as Zn1/3Co2/3C2O4·2H2O fibre bundles by oxalates,178 Zn0.5Mn0.5CO3 spherulites by carbonates179 and ZnSn(OH)6 cubes by hydroxide ions.101 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as novel nanoporous materials with a three-dimensional arrangement of the secondary building units. As a promising sacrificial template, well-defined porous MMOs can be obtained with the loss of organic linkers.85,180,181 Heterobimetallic Zn–Co–ZIF with a distinct polyhedral conformation was synthesized via the co-precipitation of Zn and Co ions in the presence of 2-methylimidazolate and had a similar topology to ZIF-8.58 Spinel porous hollow ZnxCo3−xO4 polyhedra were formed by annealing Zn–Co–ZIF polyhedra at 400 °C under a nitrogen gas flow. The whole synthetic process is illustrated in Fig. 7a and the morphology of Zn–Co–ZIF is characterized by FESEM to be the regular rhombic dodecahedral crystals shown in Fig. 6b. Uniform ZnxCo3−xO4 polyhedra without any aggregation can be observed (Fig. 7c–e), showing a coarse surface and hollow feature. These hollow micro/nanostructures are composed of numerous ∼10 nm nanoparticles. In testing as a LIB anode, the as-prepared ZnxCo3−xO4 hollow dodecahedra have excellent cyclic stability and a high reversible capacity up to 990 mA h g−1, from the second cycle onward (Fig. 7f). More importantly, after the charge–discharge cycles at a high rate of 10 C, a capacity of 991 mA h g−1 could be restored when the rate went back to 1 C, indicating an excellent reversibility of the electrode material (Fig. 7g).

4.2 Electrospinning method
Electrospinning has been considered as one fascinating and easily controlled method to prepare continuous 1D fibres with sizes from a few nanometers to several microns. This method not only can be used to manufacture polymers, polymer alloys, composites, polymers coupled with nanoparticles, and metals, but also fibres with tunable conformations, including core–shell, hollow and solid ones, as well as fibre assemblages.182 Therefore, diverse 1D precursors of MMOs can be regulated by exactly adjusting the process parameters, such as the viscosity/conductivity of the solution or the melt, humidity or voltage applied and the distance between the spinneret tip and collector.183 The subsequent porous 1D nano- or micro-scaled metal oxides that can be easily obtained by calcination of the as-spun precursors are promising alternative anode materials due to their large specific surface area and the fast diffusion path for the Li ions in the electrode active materials. This method combined with the calcination step has been successfully applied to fabricate 1D porous MMO nanostructures, e.g. porous ZnCo2O4 nanotubes,44 CoMn2O4 hollow nanofibers,184 egg-roll-like CaSnO3 nanotubes,106 and TiNb2O7 nanofibers.138
4.3 Hydrothermal and solvothermal method
The hydro/solvothermal method has proved to be a common and sophisticated route to fabricate various materials, where chemical reactions proceed in aqueous or organic-combined solvents in sealed reactors. Thanks to the unusual environment, lots of materials, such as diamond and cubic GaN,185 can be created whose formation require more harsh conditions otherwise. By full use of the synergetic effect of combined solvent and solvent–surfactant systems, the structure and size of the products can be well modulated. The different properties, such as viscosity, polarity and coordinating ability, of the organic solvents employed always exert an extraordinary effect on the morphology and structural control of the products. Thus, the hydro/solvothermal route plays a significant role in the controlled synthesis of a broad range of MMO precursors. Until now, followed by the step of post-annealing, various MMOs with complex structures have been synthesized, including 1D AMoO4 (A = Ni, Co) nanorods and mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays grown on carbon textiles,186,187 2D porous nanosheets of NixCo3−xO4 by treating its corresponding hydroxide precursor188 and FeCo2O4 nanoflake arrays directly grown on nickel foam substrates,19 as well as 3D MnCo2O413 and MFe2O4 spherical micro/nanostructures.189 Chen’s group reported a solvothermal synthesis–thermal decomposition method to afford hierarchical CoMn2O4 microspheres composed of porous nanosheets.65 During the solvothermal treatment, ethylene glycol (EG) had been chosen as solvent and formed a coordination complex of Co/Mn glycolates as the precursor. To minimize the interfacial energy, nanosheets aggregated into microspheres and reached a stable state. Finally, the porous nanostructures were terminated by annealing the precursor along with the release of gas. The overall synthetic process illustration and SEM image of the CoMn2O4 hierarchical microspheres are shown in Fig. 8A and B.65
 Fig. 8  (A) Formation process and (B) SEM image of CoMn2O4 hierarchical mesoporous microspheres;65 (C) illustration of the process of NiCo2O4 nanowires directly grown on carbon textile composites; (D, E) Ni–Co precursor/carbon textiles; and (F, G) NiCo2O4–carbon textile composites.187 (Reprinted with permission from ref. 65, copyright 2015, Royal Society of Chemistry. Reprinted with permission from ref. 187, copyright 2014, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.) 
It is of note that this method was also successfully applied to obtain advanced LIB materials.187 NiCo2(OH)6 nanowire arrays (NWAs) were grown directly on carbon textile by hydrothermal treatment and annealed to finalize the NiCo2O4–carbon textile composite, whose formation is illustrated in Fig. 8C. The SEM images in Fig. 8D–G display the morphology of NiCo2(OH)6 and NiCo2O4 NWA–carbon textile wherein one single nanowire is about 150 nm in diameter. The whole chemical reaction to produce NiCo2(OH)6 is clarified by the following several equations: 6CO(NH2)2 → C3H6N6 + 6NH3 + 3CO2(1) NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−(2) Ni2+ + 2Co2+ + 6OH− → NiCo2(OH)6(3) NiCo2(OH)6 + 1/2O2 → NiCo2O4 + 3H2O(4)
4.4 Others
Other than the above-discussed methods based on liquid phases, some others have been also employed in manufacturing MMOs with unique architectures. The microwave route is considered as energy-efficient because of the short heating duration and homogeneous thermal transmission and is broadly used for the synthesis of materials. Mixed-metal hydroxide precursors were preformed via microwave aging, and were pyrolyzed into mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets with a high specific surface area.60 A continuous spray pyrolysis was employed to synthesize mixed metal oxides with yolk–shell structures containing seven to ten components.190 Chemical bath deposition (CBD) can effectively enable the formation of films deposited on substrates and has been extensively applied to build self-supported MMO precursors on substrates. For instance, the selective synthesis of binary and ternary oxide precursors, including capsule-like Fe2O3 nanoparticles, NiCo2O4 nanowires and wall-like ZnCo2O4 on 3D macroporous Ni foam, has been realized by a combined process of CBD and calcination.153 Considering the cost of the reactors involved and the operational facility, reflux was the broadly used avenue in either organic or inorganic chemical reactions. Lots of research groups got the expected and functional porous MTMOs, e.g. ZnCo2O490 and ZnMn2O4191 yolk–shell microspheres, via a reflux approach with a thermal treatment process afterward. It should be pointed out that vapor-phase routes are also important for the design and development of pure or complex electroactive materials, besides the above liquid-phased strategies. Furthermore, integrated methods involving stepwise solution and vapor-phase routes are more versatile for obtaining MMO-based structures. 3D mesoporous NiSix nanowires were deposited on nickel foam as the current collector by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and were later combined with NiCo2O4 to form core–shell heterostructures via the CBD method.152
From the above discussion, it is obvious that structural MMOs can be modulated by choosing different approaches and adjusting the reaction conditions in terms of the chemical composition, size, crystallinity and configuration, which affect the electrochemical behaviour of materials.
4.5 Formation mechanism
Studies on the growth process of crystalline materials can furnish lots of information and guidance for designing synthetic systems and detailed experiments. As a result, it's of high importance to examine the formation mechanism of the resulting samples. As we know, classical mesocrystals were defined by Helmut Cölfen,192 where nanocrystals are aligned in order and display single-crystal electron diffraction. Several basic mechanisms were proposed to explain the alignment driven by the organic matrix, physical fields, interparticle forces, mineral bridges and so on.193 During the connection, hydrophobic interactions between surfactant long chains were proposed to induce the self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals to minimize the surface energy. A typical example derived from the formation strategy is the successful synthesis of CaMoO4 mesocrystals by the application of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).194 Hence, for the more efficient attainment of more MMO structures, the formation mechanisms of related intermediates and products must be paid much attention. On the basis of the above investigation of the preparation methodology, the formation mechanism of MMOs can be clarified according to the morphological relationship between them.
From the above research survey, the configuration of the resulting porous MMOs can be tuned by varying the post-annealing process of the precursors. Hence, MMO structures always possess a different structural construction to the precursors. A lot of research endeavors have studied the effect of the annealing parameters on MMO formation, involving the ramping rate and calcination temperature.14,65,66,85 Our group successfully prepared a series of MnCo2O4 submicrospheres with multilevel interiors starting from MnCo–glycol solid spheres by precisely controlling the heating rate,14 as illustrated in Fig. 9A. Solid MnCo2O4 mesoporous spheres (see Fig. 9A(i) and C) could be obtained via the heating treatment of the precursor at 170 °C with a ramping rate of 0.5 °C min−1, where the small temperature gradient (ΔT) along the radical direction results in a homogeneous decomposition process over the surface to the center of the MnCo–glycol solid spheres. When the heating rate was increased, hollow spheres with multiwalls could be formed instead (see Fig. 9D–G). By comparison, in the case of a higher ΔT, the transformation reaction is a nonequilibrium and heterogeneous process, with uneven mass transportation. Contraction (σco) and adhesive forces (σad) along two opposite directions work on the solid spheres. When σad is bigger than σco, the diffusion of inner particles to the outside will be enabled resulting in the formation of hollow spheres (see Fig. 9A(ii) and D). If σco exceeds σad, an inner core will form and detach from the shell during the continuous heating. The relative intensity of σco and σad depend on the ramping rate, which can affect the elegant structure of the resulting hollow spheres (see Fig. 9A(iii–v), yolk–shell spheres (Fig. 9E), shell-in-shell spheres (Fig. 9F) and yolk-in-double-shell structures (Fig. 9G). Among these multilevel interior structures, MnCo2O4 yolk–shell submicrospheres showed the best performance, which can not only afford a high contact area but also maintain the structure at a stable level. Similarly, Lou’s group also performed the formation with exceptional achievements, including ball-in-ball ZnMn2O4 hollow microspheres66 and double-shelled CoMn2O4 hollow microcubes.67

Otherwise, the shape of the parental precursors can be preserved well in the final samples. The advantage is that it is much easier to set up the desired structure of MMOs due to the similarity of the morphology to the precursors. The superior electrochemical behaviour benefits from the unique and favorable structures of the materials. Most researchers mainly focused on the manipulation of parameters throughout the annealing process and ignored the formation of precursors with regard to the composition, crystal phase and crystallization process. As reported before, precursors for MMOs, in general, are coordination complexes obtained via reactions between metal cations and different ligands, such as OH− (hydroxide ions), (OCH2CH2OH)− (deprotonated ethylene glycol), (COO)22− (oxalate), CO32− (carbonate) and so on. By virtue of the XRD technique, the Ni0.33Co0.67CO3 precursor of NiCo2O4 mesoporous microspheres can be indexed as a hexagonal system,62 which has a similar diffraction pattern to CoCO3 (JCPDS card no. 11-0692). Because of the presence of Ni2+, Co2+ ions in the hexagonal lattice have been replaced partially, which makes the diffraction position move to a higher angle. Co[Fe(CN)6]0.667-based MOF nanocubes85 have been determined to be cubic lattice based on XRD results. In addition, metal oxide hydrates, such as vanadate hydrates, are another group of precursors.112 From the TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) trace, we can deduce the number of structural water molecules and then the chemical formula. An example is the formation of porous Co3V2O8 nanosheets templated by Co3V2O8·nH2O nanosheets via calcination in an inert gas flow.121 The process of precursor formation also requires attention to thoroughly optimize the fabrication conditions. The detailed formation process of 3D Zn0.33Co0.67CO3 twin microspheres has been investigated by our group.45 In order to clarify the growth process, intermediates were collected at different reaction stages and monitored in regard to their structure by TEM and phase by XRD. A multistep splitting–in situ-dissolution–recrystallization growth mechanism is proposed from the time-dependent experiments, as shown in Fig. 10. Very interestingly, compared with the formation process of Zn0.33Co0.67CO3 twin microspheres,46 Zn0.33Mn0.67CO3 twin spheres were obtained via a unique oriented attachment together with an Ostwald ripening process69 (see Fig. 11). Although they resemble one another in structure, the growth process involved is different. It's obvious that a study of the formation mechanism of respective systems is of high necessity to understand the role of the reagents involved.

Ostwald ripening is a typical process in the dissolution of small crystals or sol particles and redeposition on larger crystals or sol particles, dominating the synthesis of materials.195,196 The formation of α-CuV2O6 nanowires was also studied by Chen.177 Cu3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O with lamellar microstructures was first formed by an Ostwald ripening process, and then transformed into nanosheets and continuously into nanowires by a gradual splitting process. Meantime, α-CuV2O6 was formed by the chemical decomposition of Cu3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O. Hence, the formation becomes a sequential ripening–splitting mechanism.
In this regard, one special case is the formation of a porous single-crystal, which is used to describe single-crystalline materials with pores inside.197 The lattice is not continuous in the entire structure, which is different to conventional single crystals with the lattice to the edge.
Porous single-crystal SMOs can be derived from pure-phased precursors by calcination to remove the organic template and retain the pores. Relying on the equivalent crystallographic orientation between them, topotactic conversion198 involves a structural variation from one to another kind of crystalline solid, which can make the final materials maintain the shape skeleton of the solid precursors. Tian et al. reported the synthesis of porous single crystals of Co3O4 nanobelts starting from α-Co(OH)2 and looked into the transformation between them from the crystal structure perspective.199 In order to understand the topotactic relation, an intermediate was harvested under conditions where α-Co(OH)2 couldn't completely decompose thermally. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 12B taken from a low-magnification TEM image of Fig. 12A is analyzed to have two sets of diffraction spots, one of which comes from hydrotalcite-like α-Co(OH)2 and the other from spinel Co3O4. It's apparent that the [111] axes of spinel Co3O4 are parallel to the [0001] axis of hexagonal α-Co(OH)2, which underlines the topotactic conversion. The in situ formation of Co3O4 nanocrystals was oriented and crystallized topotactically from hydrotalcite-like structured α-Co(OH)2 with a structural relationship, as illustrated in Fig. 12C.

In fact, topotactic reactions usually give access to porous textured nanostructures with the precursor as a sacrificial template. Carbon-decorated CoO nanowire arrays have been successfully produced by Zeng’s group,31 exhibiting an excellent cyclic performance with nearly 100% capacity retention throughout 70 test cycles. Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O nanowire assemblages have been prepared through a urea-assisted hydrothermal process, as displayed in Fig. 12D. After the stepwise treatment, porous single-crystalline Co3O4 and CoO@C nanowires were formed. As deduced from the HRTEM results in Fig. 12E–G, it can be recognized that (300), (220) and (110) crystal planes of the three samples are all normal to their growth directions and the interplane spacings were 2.93 Å (d300, Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O), 2.85 Å (d220, Co3O4) and 3.01 Å (d110, CoO), respectively. The small lattice mismatch tolerates the in situ topotactic nucleation and crystallization of Co3O4 and CoO, whose crystallographic projections are shown in Fig. 12H and I. Two neighboring oxygen-composed tetrahedra of Co3O4 can combine into an octahedron, which might have an analogous configuration to CoO, as shown in the rhombic framework. The matched lattice constants further ascertain this postulation. The AB length of Co3O4 is 5.703 Å, and the A′B′ distance of CoO is 6.027 Å, which show spatial matching as high as 94.3%. The recombination of tetrahedra of Co3O4 into one octahedron in CoO is naturally favorable via atomic arrangement.
MMOs can also form porous single crystals. However, the difficulty in understanding the crystal structure of the precursors, for example glycolate and carbonate containing mixed metal ions, inhibits an in-depth investigation of the structural relationship. Therefore, the further exploitation of the phase structure of precursors for MMOs must be performed.
5. Conclusions
In this review, we have summarized the recent investigations in the field of the synthesis of porous MMOs with various complex structures and their application as anodes in LIBs. The porous MMOs include M–Co–O, M–Mn–O, M–Fe–O, M–Sn–O, M–V–O and other mixed metal oxides. The drawbacks of present anode materials, e.g. volume expansion, low conductivity, and unsatisfactory ionic/electronic diffusion kinetics, could be ameliorated to a certain degree by rationally designing exquisite architectures and advanced electrode materials with MMOs. Nowadays, a wide application in commercialized production is limited by the lab-scale synthesis of MMOs. Hence, it is necessary to explore and develop facile, large scale and high-efficiency methods for synthesizing various hierarchical MMOs. 3D macroporous substrates supply a large loading area for the hybridization of materials with a strong binding ability. The direct growth of electroactive materials on conductive substrates originates in integrated 3D electrode materials. The unique structural assembly and arrangement facilitate the transportation and reception of electrons by the current collector. In conclusion, the outstanding electrochemical performance of the porous MMOs discussed here is assigned to the synergic effects between their unique structural construction and different metal species.
Protocols to gain MMO structures were also reviewed to shed more light on the development of more effective syntheses based on the methodological and structural study of relevant products. The preparation of precursors proceeds first via typical vapor- and liquid-phased strategies or combined processes. Subsequently, thermal post-treatment initiates the chemical decomposition and is applied to acquire and tune the porous final products. A thorough inspection of the precursors and final MMO formation is essential to understand the theory of reactions and devise accessible routes to get MMOs with engineered structures. In our review, the growth process of precursors from the solution phase is also a main topic. On the basis of time-dependent morphology evolution, basic mechanisms have been proposed and concluded. Additionally, by changing the calcination parameters, unbalanced contraction and cohesion forces in opposite directions work on spherical precursors, resulting in selectivity for hollow spheres with multilevel interiors. Porous single crystals are another kind of material for anodes, and are transformed from precursors based on topotactic reactions. Related to the definite crystallographic orientation, the single crystal nature can be retained from the original single crystal precursors. The transformation mechanism is studied from the aspect of the crystal structure. Owing to the unclear determination of the crystal structure of the precursors, the structural relevance to MMOs can't be explained from the perspective of crystallography. In the future, more efforts should be invested to elucidate the crystal structure of the related precursors.
We point out that porous MMOs containing binder and with no binder are considered as a novel group of anode candidates to enhance the electrochemical behaviour, owing to their intrinsic physiochemical nature and geometric structure. Future work should involve adjustments in the composition and microstructure. We hope these ideas can offer opportunities for researchers to construct innovative architectures of other anode materials and promote the development of LIBs, especially in practical applications.
