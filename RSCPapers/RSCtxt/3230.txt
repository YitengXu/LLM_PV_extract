    , Accepted 27th May 2017First published on 29th May 2017AbstractA heterogeneous Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite was successfully prepared from anodized amorphous TiO2 nanotube arrays in CH3COOLi solution by using a facile hydrothermal method. Morphology transformation from nanotubes into diamond-shaped nanoparticles can be attributed to the water-induced dissolution and recrystallization processes of the nanotube arrays in a weak acid salt solution. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results showed that a large amount of Li2TiO3/TiO2 diamond-shaped nanoparticles were formed on the surface of the TiO2 nanotube arrays. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra indicated improved visible light absorbance. The enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting was demonstrated under UV-vis light illumination, and the photocurrent density of the electrode prepared in 0.1 M CH3COOLi was greater than that of other electrodes. The semiconductor characteristics were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in detail. This work is expected to guide next studies to design and fabricate photocatalysts for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting.
1. Introduction
The efficient utilization of solar energy is one of the major goals of modern society, and it is expected to have a great impact on technological applications.1 The development of photocatalysis, in which the inexhaustible, clean, and safe energy of the Sun is harnessed for sustainable, nonhazardous, and economically viable technologies, is a major advancement in this direction.2 To achieve efficient and durable conversion of solar energy, an appropriate semiconductor should be used as a photocatalyst. Small band gap semiconductors (e.g., silicon and the III and IV groups of composites) can efficiently absorb light and separate charges.3 Their main drawback is that their surface is corroded and passivated when they are involved in redox reactions, leading to a life time on the order of hours.4 As a promising solar-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen generation through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and other applications such as water or air purification and dye-sensitized solar cells, TiO2 has many advantages including excellent functionality, long-term stability, and nontoxicity.5,6 The photoelectrochemical properties of a TiO2 electrode, first demonstrated by Fujishima and Honda,7 have attracted enough attention and various investigations so far.2 However, the low quantum efficiency of TiO2 requires the utilization of ultraviolet (UV) light for electron–hole separation.3,8 These drawbacks practically limit the use of visible light as an irradiation source in photocatalytic reactions on TiO2. Moreover, the high rate of electron–hole recombination on TiO2 was also an important problem, which lowers the efficiency of the photocatalyst, thereby limiting its large-scale practical application.
Over the past few years, various methods have been carried out for maximizing the solar energy utilization efficiency and increasing the yield of the electron–hole pairs via doping,9,10 modification,11,12 or semiconductor coupling with forming heterojunctions.13–15 Coupling TiO2 with semiconductors such as WO3,16 CdS,17 CdSe,18 Cu2O,19 FeTiO3,14 SrTiO3,20 Si quantum dots21 and carbon quantum dots22 has been reported to exhibit good photoelectrochemical activity under visible light irradiation. In particular, heterojunctions of TiO2 and other semiconductors such as metal oxides have been widely developed because of the relatively high stability of metal oxides immersed in aqueous electrolytes, and the positions of the conduction and valence band edges of the metal oxide composites are appropriate for the formation of potential gradients at the interfaces, which lead to increased charge separation and a reduced recombination rate.15 Consequently, the overall photoelectrochemical efficiency of metal oxide composites is greater than that of individual oxides.
Titanates, titanium based perovskite oxides, are a class of photocatalysts that are well known for their high efficiency, durable stability, and low cost.23,24 The heterogeneous structure between TiO2 and titanate effectively inhibits the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes.14,20,25 For example, Han et al. successfully synthesized hierarchical FeTiO3–TiO2 hollow spheres through a two-step sequential solvothermal process, and demonstrated that the hollow spheres showed an approximately two-fold enhancement in photocatalytic oxygen production compared with pure FeTiO3.14 Guo et al. reported that a solar cell based on SrTiO3–TiO2 nanosheet heterostructures exhibited an overall conversion efficiency of 7.42%, which was greater than the conversion efficiency of a solar cell based on TiO2 (5.45%).20 Recently, a study by Yang's group suggested that the photocurrent response of BaTiO3–TiO2 nanowire electrodes synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal process can be increased to 1.30 mA cm−2, which is greater than the value (0.78 mA cm−2) for pure TiO2 nanowires.25 Furthermore, lithium titanate (Li2TiO3) has emerged as a good candidate as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries because it has a cubic structure and can react with Li atoms to form zero-strain insertion materials.26,27 And it can also be applied in photocatalytic hydrogen production and photocatalytic degradation of toxic pollutants due to its excellent safety characteristic and long lifetime. However, only a few studies have described the photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of Li2TiO3.
Herein, a novel nanocomposite, Li2TiO3/TiO2, was prepared through a combination of the anodization of a titanium foil and a hydrothermal reaction. Because of its simplicity and the high level of geometric control that it provides, the anodic growth of TiO2 nanotubes is an effective method for fabricating self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays.21 Furthermore, the Li2TiO3/TiO2 composite can be controllably fabricated from the as-anodized amorphous TiO2 nanotubes through a hydrothermal process involving water-induced dissolution and recrystallization.28 The morphology, structure, optical properties and photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite were investigated. The enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting performance was first demonstrated for the nanocomposite electrode.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Reagents
Titanium foils (0.1 mm thickness, 99.6%), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99.0%), acetone, ethanol and lithium acetate (CH3COOLi) were used as received. Deionized water was used to prepare the solution.
2.2. Preparation of TiO2 nanotube arrays
TiO2 nanotubes were prepared as described elsewhere.21 Briefly, the titanium foils (99.6% purity) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water sequentially, then chemically etched by dipping in a mixed solution of HF (40%), HNO3 (65%) and deionized water (1:4:5 in volume) for 20 s, and rinsed with deionized water. The anodic oxidation was performed with the polished Ti foils as the working electrode and a graphite sheet as the counter electrode in a 0.5 wt% HF solution for 40 min at 20 V using a DC power supply. Finally, the as-prepared samples were rinsed with deionized water, dried with an air stream and cooled to room temperature after being annealed at 200 °C for 2 h under ambient conditions.
2.3. Preparation of heterogeneous Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposites
The obtained TiO2 nanotubes acted not only as a structure-directed template but also as the Ti source for the fabrication of heterogeneous Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposites. In a typical procedure, 60 mL of CH3COOLi solution (0.1 M) was transferred to a Teflon-lined (85 mL) autoclave, and TiO2 nanotubes were added to it. Then the autoclave was sealed and kept at 200 °C for 3 h. The prepared samples were rinsed by sonication in deionized water for 5 min to remove surface deposits and dried in air at room temperature. Finally, the as-prepared samples were annealed at 450 °C for 2 h under ambient conditions. The samples were hydrothermally treated with water, 0.1 M CH3COOLi and 0.2 M CH3COOLi solution.
2.4. Characterization and measurements
The morphology of the nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, XL30FEG, Philips). An RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Al/Mg-K radiation was used to perform X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at a pass energy of 93.9 eV, and the binding energies were calibrated based on the containment carbon (C1s 284.6 eV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-50 scan).
The photocurrent and j–V plots were obtained in a three-electrode cell on a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China). A standard three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt sheet as a counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, and sample electrodes as working electrodes was used for the photoelectrochemical measurements. The working electrode was illuminated with a 500 W Xenon lamp (CHF-XM35, Trusttech Co., Ltd., Beijing), from which infrared wavelengths were removed by a quartz water filter. The UV-vis intensity was measured to be 140 mW cm−2. The j–V plots were measured using a linear sweep voltammetry method at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1 from −0.7 to 0.8 V. The electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz with a PARSTAT 4000 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research). The flat band potential was measured using the Mott–Schottky analysis at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 from −1.0 to 0.8 V at 100 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the TiO2 nanotube arrays and heterogeneous Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite was characterized by SEM as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows that the TiO2 nanotube arrays were successfully prepared by the controlled one-step anodization process. Highly ordered and vertically aligned nanotubes with a single tube inner diameter of approximately 94 nm and a wall thickness of around 18 nm were formed on Ti substrates. Fig. 1B shows the cross section of the TiO2 nanotube arrays, which reveals that the nanotube arrays were about 400 nm in length. The morphological characteristics of TiO2 nanotube arrays can be proved by our previous research.21Fig. 1C shows the transformation of the TiO2 nanotube arrays into nanoparticles, which mostly exhibit a non-uniform morphology. When the amorphous TiO2 nanotube arrays were treated by hydrothermal reaction in water, titanium suboxide and unstable octahedral TiO62− in amorphous TiO2, owing to their high activity, first absorbed H2O molecules through the surface hydroxy groups to form insoluble species of Ti(OH)62− (eqn (1)), which could be further dehydrated and precipitated by bridging together and sharing faces to form TiO2 nanoparticles (eqn (2)).29 The reaction process is described by the following equations: TiOx + 4H2O + (1 − x/2)O2 → Ti(OH)62− + 2H+ (1 < x ≤ 2)(1) Ti(OH)62− + 2H+ → TiO2 + 4H2O(2)The remaining amorphous nanotubes hydrothermally treated with water could be further etched with H2O molecules until the tube wall disappeared, and thus the irregular nanoparticles are finally formed as shown in Fig. 1C.

The SEM image of the nanocomposite prepared in 0.1 M CH3COOLi solution after 4000 s steady-state photocurrent measurement (F). 
The morphology of the sample hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi solution was characterized by SEM as revealed in Fig. 1D and E. Many small diamond-shaped particles with a major axis length of approximately 230 nm and a minor axis length of approximately 100 nm were formed on decomposed TiO2 nanotube arrays. As shown in a low resolution SEM image, the amorphous TiO2 nanotubes hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi solution could experience a weak acid salt-induced dissolution and recrystallization processes24 to give a high yield of Li2TiO3/TiO2 heterogeneous diamond-shaped nanoparticles (Fig. 1E). The mechanism of this process can be expressed as follows: CH3COOLi → Li+ + CH3COO−(3) CH3COO− + H+ → CH3COOH(4) Ti(OH)62− + 2Li+ → Li2TiO3↓ + 3H2O(5) In particular, the CH3COO− produced by ionization could combine with H+, as shown in eqn (4), leading to the removal of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution. This is likely to limit the progress of reaction (2), and Ti(OH)62− formed in eqn (1) reacts with Li+ to form Li2TiO3 and TiO2 nanocomposites (eqn (5)).
The presence of Li2TiO3/TiO2 was confirmed through XPS measurements. Fig. 2A presents the full-scale XPS spectra of the nanocomposite (curve b) and TiO2 (curve a). The existence of the peaks of C 1s, O 1s and Ti 2p can be confirmed in the TiO2 nanoparticles, whereas the signature peaks of Li emerged at 55.4 eV in the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite. This significant change was mainly because of the introduction of Li2TiO3. XPS analysis showed that the Li:Ti:O relative ratio (atomic percent) of the nanocomposite was 29.62%:14.53%:41.05% ≈ 2:1:3. A possible reason for this ratio is that the weak acid salt-induced dissolution and recrystallization of TiO2 nanotube arrays led to the formation of Li2TiO3 on the surface of the nanocomposite. The peak of C 1s (284.6 eV) corresponds to the C–H and C–C bonds of hydrocarbons, caused by the contaminant carbon. The high-resolution spectrum of Ti 2p in Fig. 2B suggests that the characteristic peaks centered at 458.3 (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.1 eV (Ti 2p1/2) indicate a Ti4+ oxidation state in the Li2TiO3/TiO2 composite.20,23 Furthermore, a new Ti 2p peak is observed at 460.1 eV in Fig. 2B, and it may be assigned to the presence of Ti3+.30 The Ti3+ is attributed to the presence of residual titanium suboxide resulting from the incomplete reaction of eqn (1), which would play a crucial role in the facile transfer of an electron or a hole to obtain efficient activity in the visible spectrum.31 Two peaks, located at 529.4 and 531.6 eV, can be observed in the high-resolution O 1s spectrum in Fig. 2C. The peak centered at 529.4 eV should correspond to the O atom bound to the metals such as Ti and Li, whereas the other peak centered at 531.6 eV can be ascribed to the absorbed O by carbonate species and/or hydroxyl oxides.13,32 The XPS spectrum of Li 1s shows a small peak, and the binding energy of Li 1s in the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite is 55.4 eV, which is 0.2 eV greater than the reported binding energy of lithium titanate.32 It is suggested that the electronic cloud distribution of Li 1s is influenced by different atomic ratios.

X-ray diffraction was performed to determine the phase and crystal structure of the samples, as shown in Fig. 3. All the diffraction peaks were ascribed to TiO2, Li2TiO3 and the Ti substrate. The Ti metal phase could be indexed from the corresponding characteristic peaks in Fig. 3 of all the samples.22,28 The strong diffraction peaks indicate that the anodically grown TiO2 nanotube film was thin and that the film was strongly attached to the Ti substrate. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that the as-anodized TiO2 nanotubes have the same amorphous structure before and after calcination in air at 200 °C. The anatase diffraction peaks can be clearly observed for the amorphous TiO2 nanotubes after their hydrothermal treatment with water, which reveal that phase and morphology transformations were successfully achieved.28,29 With the introduction of the weak acid salt CH3COOLi, the XRD diffraction peaks of Li2TiO3 in different samples were in accordance with those observed in other studies.27,33 Meanwhile, the coexistence of TiO2 and Li2TiO3 was observed in the XRD patterns for the Li2TiO3/TiO2 samples (curves d and e), which demonstrate the integration of these two compositions with heterogeneous structures. Moreover, with an increase in the concentration of CH3COOLi solution (0.2 M) in the hydrothermal reaction, the intensity of the XRD peaks of Li2TiO3 obviously decreased, indicating the gradual destruction of the heterogeneous structure of the nanocomposite.

The light absorption range of a semiconductor plays an important role in its application in the utilization of solar energy.21 The UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 4A. Enhanced absorbance can be observed in both ultraviolet and visible light regions for the sample prepared with 0.1 M CH3COOLi solution compared with the other samples. The TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by the hydrothermal reaction (curve a in Fig. 4A) present a typical absorption spectrum over the wavelength range of 200–800 nm, and the absorption spectrum was consistent with a report in the literature.34 The absorption peak below 400 nm is mainly due to the charge transfer from the valence band of oxide anions (formed mainly by 2p orbitals) to the conduction band of Ti4+ cations (formed mainly by 3dt2g orbitals).35 Stronger absorption in the visible light region was observed for the sample obtained with increasing concentration of CH3COOLi solution. The absorption onsets showed an obvious red-shift (curve b in Fig. 4A). The enhanced visible light absorption suggested that the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite may be more photoactive than TiO2. The higher light absorbance and the red-shift of the absorption edge can be attributed to the electronic transition from the valence band to the Ti3+ induced inter-band or from this band level to the conduction band in the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite.36 The formation of heterogeneous structures between TiO2 and titanate could modify the electronic structures of the pristine semiconductors.23,37 Furthermore, the strong light scattering effects and the high surface area-to-volume ratio of the diamond nanoparticles may be conducive to the absorption of light. However, it shows that the absorption capacity was decreased when the concentration of the CH3COOLi solution was too high (curve c in Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows (αhν)1/2versus hν plots and the vertical segment of the spectra is extended to intersect the hν axis (x-axis) to obtain the indirect band gap (Eg) values of the samples. The band gap energies of the samples were estimated using the Kubelka–Munk function.22,36 The band gap slightly decreased to 2.41 and 3.04 eV from the initial 3.15 eV of the TiO2 nanoparticles, with an increase in the concentration of the CH3COOLi solution in the hydrothermal treatment. The presence of Li2TiO3 in the composite contributed to red-shift of the absorption edge and a broad light absorption. The heterogeneous structure narrowed the band gap of the samples,13 compared with TiO2.

To further characterize the electron transfer and charge recombination of Li2TiO3/TiO2, the transient photocurrent (j–t) responses of the different samples were measured under intermittent UV-vis light irradiation. The photocurrent density of an electrode can be considered as its photocatalytic oxidation capacity and reveals photoinduced charge-transfer properties in a photoelectrode/solution interface.23 Notably, the photocurrent responses to illumination were prompt in all the samples, as shown in Fig. 5A, the photocurrent density under chopped light irradiation increased 2.0 times for the sample hydrothermally treated with the 0.1 M CH3COOLi electrode (curve b) compared to the sample hydrothermally treated with the water electrode (curve a). The Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite electrode synthesized in the 0.1 M CH3COOLi hydrothermal system exhibited the highest photocurrent, which is attributed to the fact that the heterogeneous structures of both TiO2 and Li2TiO3 provide surface–interface shallow traps and thus promote the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs.15,23 Furthermore, the energy level structures of TiO2 and Li2TiO3 match well.37 It is well known that a higher photocurrent response indicates a higher efficiency in the separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes, and thus suggests a better photo-catalytic activity.13 When the concentration of CH3COOLi in aqueous solution was increased to 0.2 M, the photocurrent density of the sample decreased (curve c in Fig. 5A) and the results were similar to those derived from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra. A high concentration of CH3COOLi resulted in the excessive etching of TiO2 in the process of the hydrothermal reaction, leading to the destruction of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 heterogeneous structure. The amount of effective generated electron–hole pairs and carrier transmission decreased oppositely, and consequently hindered their transformation and affected the photocurrent response of the sample. Fig. 5B shows the photocurrent density of three electrodes running for 4000 s as the photoanode. It has been found that the photocurrent of the three electrodes remains at a relatively stable level under simulated sunlight illumination. And the stable photocurrent of the sample hydrothermally treated with the 0.1 M CH3COOLi electrode (curve b) is much higher than the other two electrodes (curves a and c), which are similar to those shown in Fig. 5A. The SEM image of the sample is shown in Fig. 1F. No large changes were observed for the sample after the stability measurement, suggesting the continuous photoelectrochemical reaction and the durability of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite. The photocurrent measurement results suggested that the photoelectrochemical water splitting activity of the samples was affected by the hydrothermal solution system and that the highest activity was observed for the sample hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi.

Fig. 6A shows the open-circuit potential–time curves of the samples hydrothermally treated with water and 0.1 M and 0.2 M CH3COOLi. It is noted that the electrode photopotential is related to the concentration of CH3COOLi, and the highest photopotential was also observed for the electrode prepared in the 0.1 M CH3COOLi solution. Thus, it can be suggested that the sample hydrothermally treated with the 0.1 M CH3COOLi photoanode displayed a more sensitive and effective separation of photoinduced charge carriers, which was consistent with the photocurrent properties. The j–V characteristics of the photoanodes in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution are shown in Fig. 6B (j–V characteristics under dark conditions are also shown as the inset of Fig. 6B). The formation of a heterogeneous nanocomposite does increase the photocurrent in this system. This result matches well with Fig. 5. The corresponding efficiency of the conversion of light energy to chemical energy as a function of the applied potential is shown in Fig. 6C, and the efficiency is calculated according to the following formula, which was described previously:38 (6)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input, I0 is the power density of the incident light (mW cm−2), and Eorev is the standard reversible potential (which is 1.23 V vs. NHE). The applied potential is given by Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same electrode at an open circuit under the same conditions. From Fig. 6C, a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.37% was obtained for the sample hydrothermally treated with the 0.1 M CH3COOLi electrode under UV-vis light, whereas the efficiencies were 0.18% and 0.12% for the samples hydrothermally treated with water and 0.2 M CH3COOLi, respectively. The maximum photoconversion efficiency increased about 2.1 and 3.1 times as a result of the appropriate growth of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite, implying that the heterogeneous nanocomposite is not only efficient in improving visible light utilization but can also achieve a higher photocurrent.

The inset in (B) is the magnified j–V plots of dark current for the three samples. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) provides a powerful tool for the study of charge transfer and recombined processes at the semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces.13,21Fig. 7A and B present typical Nyquist and Bode impedance spectra for the electrodes at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. No obvious differences can be observed among the three sample electrodes in the high frequency region of the Nyquist and Bode plots, indicating that the electrolyte resistance was a dominant process at this stage compared to the charge transfer.21 Clearly, as shown in Fig. 7A, the semicircle diameter in the plot was reduced with the sample hydrothermally treated with CH3COOLi, which indicated a decrease in the interface resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the surface. EIS data were also analyzed in terms of an equivalent circuit model. Table 1 shows the results obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit as the inset in Fig. 7A. Here, Rs is the electrolyte resistance; Rct is the charge transfer resistance; and CPE is the capacitance phase element.22 The fitted values of Rct were 1122.80, 783.48 and 1672.15 Ω cm−2 for the samples prepared with water, 0.1 M CH3COOLi and 0.2 M CH3COOLi solution, respectively. The Rct value of the sample hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi is the smallest, indicating that this sample electrode has smaller charge transfer resistance and better photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and mobility.32 And the Rct value of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite is smaller compared with other TiO2 heterostructures, showing that Li2TiO3 has a better modification effect.13 Upon decreasing the value of Rct, the charge transfer across the interface between the semiconductor and solution becomes easy. Therefore, the photocurrent could be increased. It can be found that the charge-transfer resistance of the samples increased for very low (water) or very high (0.2 M) concentrations of CH3COOLi in the hydrothermal reaction, which may be ascribed to the lack or destruction of the heterogeneous structure,13,20 leading to bad separation of photoinduced charge carriers and interfacial transfer of electrons. The Bode plot provides an obvious indication for the differences in the impedance and the lifetime of electrons (τe). As shown in Fig. 7B, the peak of the sample hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi in the medium frequency (ω2) shifted to a lower frequency compared with the other samples. Any shift of the peak from a high frequency to a lower frequency results in a more rapid electron transport, because ω2 is related to the inverse of the recombination lifetime or electron lifetime. τe in the semiconductor can be calculated according to τe = 1/(2πmax), where max is the maximum frequency of ω2.39 As shown in Table 1, the sample hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi reached the maximum lifetime (31.77 ms), and it was higher than other TiO2 heterostructures.20 The Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite has a higher charge carriers' lifetime compared with TiO2. The higher lifetime means the lower recombination rate of electrons and holes during the charge carriers across the materials, which is in agreement with the result of Rct.

The inset in (A) is the equivalent circuit. Rs is the electrolyte resistance; Rct is the charge transfer resistance; and CPE is the capacitance phase element.

Higher electrochemical performance requires that the charge carrier density (ND) and flat band potential (Vfb) be optimized; both these parameters can be measured using Mott–Schottky analysis. Fig. 7C presents the Mott–Schottky plots of 1/C2 as a function of the applied potential under dark conditions, from which the positive slopes of the linear parts of the curves are observed, suggesting n-type semiconductors.36 The value of Vfb is approximately equal to the intersection of the tangent of the Mott–Schottky curves and the potential axis.9 Therefore, the plots were extrapolated to 1/C2 = 0 to estimate the values of Vfb, and values of −0.47, −0.68 and −0.61 V (vs. SCE) were obtained for the samples prepared with water, 0.1 M CH3COOLi and 0.2 M CH3COOLi solution, respectively. Compared with the Vfb value of the TiO2 electrode, the Vfb value of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 electrode was more negative. More negative Vfb reflects a smaller barrier to charge transfer and can induce accumulation of more electrons in the conduction band of the sample, thus suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which is in accordance with previous reports.13,21 Actually, when the semiconductor is under depletion conditions, the charge carrier density (ND) varies with the potential following eqn (7):36 (7) (7′)where E is the applied potential (V), ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (F cm−1), q is the electronic charge (C), and C is the capacitance of the space charge layer. The calculated ND values of the samples hydrothermally treated with water, 0.1 M CH3COOLi and 0.2 M CH3COOLi were 9.62 × 1017, 2.98 × 1018 and 4.11 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. Apparently, the value varied with the hydrothermal system, and the largest ND value was observed for the sample hydrothermally treated with 0.1 M CH3COOLi. One reason for the high performance of this sample is that the charge carrier density directly enhances the photocurrent density, indicating a faster carrier transfer and thus enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite.

Scheme 1 illustrates a possible mechanism for the charge transfer process of Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposites under UV-vis light irradiation. Li2TiO3 is a kind of wide bandgap semiconductor (3.3 eV), and both the conduction band and valence band of Li2TiO3 have appropriate energy levels matching with TiO2.37,40 The good matching of band edges between TiO2 and Li2TiO3 is important to form a heterojunction.20 Under light illumination, electrons photo-excited from the conduction band of Li2TiO3 pass to the lower lying conduction band of TiO2, while the photo-excited holes in the valence band of TiO2 transfer oppositely to that of Li2TiO3. The synchronous transfer of electrons and holes in the Li2TiO3/TiO2 heterogeneous structure could suppress the recombination of photo-excited electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, direct coupling of Li2TiO3 to TiO2 would greatly maximize the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes and enhance the photoconversion efficiency and the photoelectrochemical water splitting performance.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a heterogeneous Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite was successfully prepared by combining the anodization of a titanium foil and a hydrothermal reaction. The possible formation mechanism of the nanocomposite from the as-anodized amorphous TiO2 nanotubes was attributed to a water-induced dissolution and recrystallization. An appropriate concentration of CH3COOLi in the hydrothermal reaction is a key factor in the proper fabrication of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite. Both an enhanced photocurrent and improved photopotential were demonstrated for the sample hydrothermally treated in 0.1 M CH3COOLi. The enhanced performances can be attributed to the strong light absorbing ability of the Li2TiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite, small interface transfer resistance, and the electron transport facilitated by the heterogeneous structures. This work provides a new strategy that can be used to improve the light response and carrier transfer of TiO2 nanomaterial.
