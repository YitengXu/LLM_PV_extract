    , Accepted 1st October 2018First published on 9th October 2018AbstractThe low-cost and stable inorganic p-type semiconductor copper(I) iodide (CuI) is a promising hole-transporting layer (HTL) material for inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted planar PSCs based on CuI HTLs reported so far are not satisfactory and far behind those of their organic counterparts. Herein, we demonstrate a simple but effective approach to improve the performance of inverted planar PSCs based on the CuI HTL through the incorporation of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) into the CuI HTL. As compared to pristine CuI, the introduction of CuSCN significantly improves the quality of the film, resulting in a smooth and uniform film while maintaining relatively high electrical conductivity. As a consequence, the champion device based on the composite CuI/CuSCN HTL affords an impressive PCE of 18.76% under full sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), which is substantially higher than the corresponding values of the respective devices containing pristine CuI (14.53%) and CuSCN (16.66%). This value is one of the highest efficiencies reported thus far for CuI- and CuSCN-based HTLs in PSCs. This work demonstrates the great potential of low-temperature solution-processed CuI/CuSCN composites as hole-selective layers for low-cost and efficient PSCs as well as other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a very promising low-cost next-generation solar cell technology that can rival conventional silicon based solar cells.1–5 Some appealing properties of perovskites, such as direct band gap, a broad light absorption spectrum range, low exciton binding energy, and a long electron–hole diffusion length, have led to remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs exceeding 22% for mesoscopic (n–i–p) device architectures.6,7 Alternatively, inverted planar PSCs (p–i–n), in which the perovskite layer is simply sandwiched between the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and the electron-transporting layer (ETL), have also attracted growing interest due to their ease of fabrication, negligible hysteresis, promising stability in accelerated aging tests, and especially low-temperature processing compatible with flexible substrates and roll-to-roll large-scale manufacture.8,9
In inverted planar PSCs, the HTL and ETL are essential components for effective charge carrier extraction/collection, thus reducing charge recombination losses at the HTL/perovskite/ETL interface and achieving optimal device performance.10–13 As for HTLs, organic p-type semiconductors, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) have been the most commonly used HTLs in inverted planar PSCs and have shown excellent PCEs in the range of 20–21%.14–16 Nevertheless, the high production cost of PTAA and the instability issue of PEDOT:PSS arising from its acidic and hygroscopic characteristics may impede their potential large-scale application. Therefore, the pursuit of low-cost, efficient, and stable HTLs for inverted planar PSCs is highly desirable from commercialization point of view. In this regard, inorganic p-type semiconductors with ease of fabrication, high transparency, high hole mobility, and high chemical stability are suitable alternative HTL materials for inverted planar PSCs, mainly dominated by transition metal oxides including NiOx, CuOx, VOx, CuCrO2, and NiCo2O4.17–26
Another attractive class of HTLs for inverted planar PSCs is copper iodide (CuI).27–30 In addition to the aforementioned merits of inorganic HTLs, CuI also possesses some unique characteristics: first, it is abundantly available with a considerably low production cost; second, it can be used directly without any further purification or treatment; and more importantly, it can be deposited by a room-temperature solution-processing technique, which is compatible with flexible substrates and roll-to-roll production for a wide range of applications.
All these advantageous features make solution-processed CuI well suited as a HTL material for inverted planar PSCs. Deng and co-workers first applied solution-processed CuI as a HTL in inverted planar PSCs and achieved an optimal PCE of 13.6%, together with good air stability arising from the hydrophobic nature of CuI.27 Bian et al. also used solution-processed CuI as the HTL in inverted planar PSCs and improved the PCE to 16.8%, largely due to the high-quality perovskite absorbing layer produced using a one-step fast deposition-crystallization method.28 CuI has a considerably high hole conductivity of 10–100 S m−1,9 which is expected to facilitate effective hole extraction/collection and thus to achieve a high overall efficiency. However, the PCEs of inverted planar PSCs incorporating CuI HTLs reported thus far were not satisfactory. It has been reported that solution-processed CuI films usually consisted of large crystallites. Hence, the CuI films were obtained with high surface roughness and pinholes.27,31 Imperfect coverage of CuI results in leakage paths between the ITO substrate and the perovskite layer, which is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance. It emphasizes that the fabrication of a high-quality CuI thin film (compact and uniform) is of great significance in order to further enhance the overall efficiency.
Specific organic additives, such as 1-methyl-3-ethyl-imidazolium thiocyanate (MEIT) and trimethylamine hydrothiocyanate (THT), were reported to act as CuI crystal growth inhibitors, which had a significant impact on the shape of the CuI grains and thus improved the quality of the CuI films.32–34 It is noticeable that the additives share the same SCN− anion, which could strongly adsorb onto the CuI surface via binding of sulfur atoms to the copper sites on the CuI crystallite. The presence of these SCN− anion based additives can prevent the growth of large crystals of CuI.33,34 Interestingly enough, copper thiocyanate (CuSCN), another well-known inorganic p-type semiconductor that contains the SCN− anion, has also been actively used as a HTL in inverted planar PSCs, showing decent PCEs in the range of 16–17% together with high stability.35–37 CuSCN has a high hole conductivity of 0.1–1 S m−1, although it is lower than that of CuI.38 In this sense, the introduction of CuSCN into the CuI film is likely to improve the quality of the film while maintaining relatively high hole conductivity.
Herein, we demonstrate a simple but effective approach to improve the performance of inverted planar PSCs based on the CuI HTL by incorporating copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) into the CuI HTL. As compared to pristine CuI, the incorporation of CuSCN significantly improves the quality of the film, resulting in a smooth and uniform film while maintaining relatively high electrical conductivity, as evidenced from the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) measurements. As a result, the champion PSCs based on the composite CuI/CuSCN HTL afford an impressive PCE of 18.76%, which is considerably higher than the corresponding values of the respective devices using pristine CuI and CuSCN (14.53% for CuI and 16.66% for CuSCN).
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals and reagents were used as received from chemical companies. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%) and lead dichloride (PbCl2, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd (St Louis, MO, USA). Copper iodide (CuI, 99.998%) and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN, 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 99.5%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (Shaanxi, China). Polyethyleneimine (PEI, MW 70000, 50 wt% aqueous solution), isopropanol (99.8%), chlorobenzene (99.8%) and diethyl sulfide (DES, >98%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagents (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
The perovskite precursor (1.2 M) was obtained by mixing MAI, PbI2 and PbCl2 with a molar ratio of 1.0:0.9:0.1 in anhydrous dimethyl formamide (DMF). The mixture was then stirred overnight at 60 °C under nitrogen. The final solution of the perovskite precursor was stored in a glovebox and filtered using 0.45 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters before use. The total concentration of the HTL precursor solution is 0.08 M with varied molar ratios of CuI and CuSCN. The HTL samples for SEM-EDS measurements were deposited from precursor solutions with a concentration of 0.4 M.
Device fabrication
The PSC devices were fabricated according to a previous report.29 First, the patterned ITO substrates (Dalian Heptachroma Solar Technology Development Co., LTD, China, 6–8 Ω sq−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication in surfactant solution, de-ionized water, and isopropanol, respectively. Then, the ITO substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 30 min. Different HTL solutions in DES were spin-coated onto the ITO substrates with a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 100 °C on a hotplate for 10 min. The resulting transparent HTL samples were immediately transferred into a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox (H2O and O2 < 0.1 ppm) for depositing the perovskite films. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto different HTL/ITO substrates with a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. Anhydrous chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrates after 7–9 s after the spin-coating procedure started. The perovskite films were then heated at 100 °C on a hotplate for 10 min, followed by spin-coating a layer of PC61BM (2 wt% in chlorobenzene, 1500 rpm, 45 s) on top, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the PEI modification layer was spin-coated on top at 5000 rpm for 1 min from isopropanol solution (0.1 wt%). The samples were then transferred into a vacuum evaporation system and 80 nm of silver was evaporated under high vacuum (1 × 10−4 Pa) by thermal evaporation.
Measurements
X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250X using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source. The binding energy was calibrated according to the C 1s neutral carbon peak at 284.8 eV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed with a monochromatic He I light source (21.22 eV) and a VG Scienta R4000 analyser. A sample bias of −5.0 V was applied to observe the secondary electron cutoff (SEC). The optical transmission spectra of different HTLs and the UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite films on different substrates were obtained by using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained by high resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova Nano SEM 450, USA). SEM-EDS analysis was performed at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The surface roughness of different HTLs was examined by AFM (Dimension ICON, Bruker, Germany). C-AFM measurements were conducted by using the Peak Force TUNA mode. The I–V curves of different HTLs were obtained from scanning probe microscope measurements (Nanonavi E-Sweep, Seiko, Japan). The conductivity of different films was measured using a four-point probe (S-2A, 4-Probe Tech, Guangzhou, China).
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under illumination with simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Newport USA, Model: 94023A) with an AM 1.5 filter in ambient air. Light intensity was calibrated with a Newport calibrated standard Si reference cell (SER. no: 506/0358). A black mask with a circular aperture (0.09 cm2) was used for the J–V measurements. For the hysteresis measurements, the J–V curves were obtained by forward scan (0–1.2 V) or reverse scan (1.2–0 V) at a rate of 10 mV S−1. The measurement of the incident photo–to–current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed using a Hypermono-light (SM-25, Jasco Co. Ltd., Japan). Steady-state photoluminescence spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements were conducted with an LP920 laser flash spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). The pump pulse is provided by a nanosecond tunable OPOlett-355II laser. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at a bias potential of 1.0 V under dark conditions using an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (Zahner Model: Zennium, Serial no: 40037, German) electrochemical workstation in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV.
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuI, CuSCN, and the composite CuI/CuSCN films with varied molar ratios (10:1, 5:1, and 1:1) were initially characterized as depicted in Fig. 1a. The pristine CuI film exhibits an intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.46°, corresponding to the (111) reflection of polycrystalline γ-phase CuI.27 The pristine CuSCN film exhibits two distinct peaks at 2θ = 16.14° and 27.17°, which can be assigned to the (003) and (101) planes of the β-phase of CuSCN.35,36 All the diffraction peaks of CuI (111) and CuSCN (003) and (101) are obviously observed for the composite films with molar ratios of 5:1 and 1:1 (CuI:CuSCN). The diffraction peaks of CuSCN cannot be detected for the sample with a molar ratio of 10:1 (CuI:CuSCN), probably due to the lower amount of CuSCN. The elemental composition of the composite samples was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements in comparison to pristine CuI and CuSCN, as shown in Fig. 1b–f. For all the samples, the main Cu 2p core levels appear at a binding energy of 932.6 eV (Fig. 1b), which is attributed to Cu1+ in CuI and CuSCN, in good agreement with previous reports.37,39 The Cu 2p core level spectra also indicate the absence of any other by-product such as CuO. For the samples containing CuI, the I 3d5/2 core levels appear at a binding energy of 619.5 eV (Fig. 1c), which agrees well with the values reported previously.29,39 The C 1s core levels for the samples incorporating CuSCN show a main peak at 286.0 eV (Fig. 1d). Another C 1s peak is observed for all the samples, which originates from the adventitious carbon. The main peaks in the S 2p core level at 163.4 eV and the N 1s core level at 398.5 eV are also observed for the samples containing CuSCN, as shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively. From the XRD and XPS results, we can confirm the presence of CuSCN in the composite films.

The optical transmission spectra of the composite films as well as the pristine CuI and CuSCN films are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† All the samples exhibit a high transmittance of over 80% on average in the range of 400–800 nm, owing to the larger band-gaps of CuI (3.1 eV) and CuSCN (3.8 eV).38 High transmittance is essential for HTLs in inverted planar PSCs, which allows sufficient photoflux to reach the perovskite layer in order to achieve high overall performance.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out to elucidate the effect of the introduction of CuSCN on the surface morphology of the CuI film. The top-view SEM images of the composite films as well as the pristine CuI and CuSCN films are presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a clearly shows that the pristine CuI film does not completely cover the ITO substrate, containing a rough surface with large voids. As shown in Fig. 2b–d, the incorporation of CuSCN into the CuI film remarkably improves the surface morphology. Specifically, the increases of the content ratios of CuSCN (5:1 and 1:1) result in dense and homogeneous films (Fig. 2c and d), which are analogous to that of pristine CuSCN (Fig. 2e). As compared to pure CuI, the markedly improved surface morphology of the composite films is expected to prevent direct contact between the ITO substrate and the perovskite layer and to reduce the charge carrier recombination losses at the ITO/HTL/perovskite interface, thus enhancing the overall solar cell performance. The elemental composition of the different HTLs was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping obtained from the top-view SEM images as presented in Fig. S2.† For all the composite samples, Cu, I, and S are uniformly distributed throughout the film without any distinct phase separation. The atomic ratios of I/S are close to the corresponding values of the precursor solutions of the composite samples. The EDS results further confirm the presence of CuSCN in the composite films.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were further performed for the composite films with respect to pristine CuI and CuSCN as displayed in Fig. 3. The CuI film shows the maximum root mean square (RMS) roughness among all the samples tested with a value of 10.2 nm (Fig. 3a). By stark contrast, the addition of CuSCN into the CuI film (CuI:CuSCN = 10:1) dramatically decreases the RMS roughness to 5.58 nm (Fig. 3b). The increases of the molar ratios of CuSCN further reduce the RMS roughness to 4.67 nm and 3.57 nm for the 5:1 and 1:1 samples, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). The CuSCN film exhibits the minimum RMS roughness of 2.47 nm (Fig. 3e). It has been reported that the film formation of the perovskite is highly dependent on the surface properties of the HTL underneath.24,26,40 In this regard, we characterized the top-view SEM images of the perovskite MAPbI3−xClx (MA = CH3NH3+) films on top of different HTL substrates as shown in Fig. S3.† As compared to pristine CuI, most of the grains of the perovskite film deposited on the composite film (5:1) are much larger. Perovskites with larger grain sizes and less grain boundaries are expected to facilitate charge transport, which ultimately affects the solar cell performance.26,40 Fig. S4† shows that the UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite films grown on different HTL substrates are almost identical.

Conductive AFM (c-AFM) measurements were performed to probe the electrical conductivity of the composite films in comparison with pristine CuI and CuSCN. The c-AFM images, as shown in Fig. 4a–e, display varied current levels and distributions upon addition of CuSCN into the CuI films. The I–V curves obtained from the scanning probe microscope (SPM) measurements (Fig. 4f) show that the electric current values of the composite films (∼1.5–4.5 nA) are two orders of magnitude higher than that of pure CuSCN (∼0.01 nA) at a bias potential of 1.0 V. The observed higher current values indicate higher electrical conductivity of the composite films with respect to pure CuSCN. The pristine CuI film shows an extremely high current value, which most likely originates from the uncovered ITO substrates. We further evaluated the electrical conductivity of the composite films as compared to pristine CuSCN by four-point probe measurements, and the data are summarized in Table S1.† CuSCN shows the lowest electrical conductivity, estimated to be 0.093 S m−1. The electrical conductivity of the composite films is increased as the concentration of CuSCN decreases. The composite with the molar ratio of 10:1 gives the highest electrical conductivity, amounting to 0.23 S m−1, which is more than doubled relative to that of pure CuSCN. Altogether, we can conclude that the incorporation of CuSCN into the CuI film results in high quality of the film morphology while maintaining relatively high electrical conductivity, which are expected to result in high solar cell performance.

(f) I–V curves of CuI, CuSCN, and composite films deposited on ITO substrates, obtained by SPM measurements (inset graph: comparison of I–V curves of bare ITO and the pristine CuI film at a bias potential from −0.1 V to 0.1 V). 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the composite CuI/CuSCN films as HTLs, inverted planar PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/HTL/MAPbI3−xClx/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/polyethylenimine (PEI)/Ag. Fig. 5a shows the energy level diagram of PSCs. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. S5†) were performed to determine the work function (φ) or Fermi level (EF) of various HTLs by subtracting the binding energies of the SECs (in the range of 16–17 eV) from 21.22 eV. The valence band (EVB) edge of CuI/CuSCN films is calculated to be ca. −5.36 eV, which is analogous to the corresponding values of CuI (−5.26 eV) and CuSCN (−5.39 eV). Therefore, the EVB edges of different HTLs studied all match well the EVB edge of the perovskite (−5.4 eV), indicating that they are capable of effectively extracting holes from the perovskite. The conduction band (ECB) edge values of the composite HTLs obtained by adding the optical band gaps (Eg) to EVB are estimated to be −1.45 eV, which is more negative than that of the perovskite (−3.9 eV) to effectively block the electrons. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 5b) displays a sandwich structure, in which a dense and uniform perovskite layer (∼380 nm) is in between the composite CuI/CuSCN HTL (∼30 nm) and the ETL (∼50 nm). A thin buffer layer of PEI (∼10 nm) is introduced atop of the ETL, followed by ∼80 nm Ag as the back contact electrode.

We initially investigated the effect of varied ratios of CuSCN in the composite HTLs on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, and the corresponding photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) results are summarized in Fig. S6 and Table S2.† The optimal molar ratio of CuI/CuSCN is found to be 5:1. For CuI/CuSCN (10:1) based devices, all the photovoltaic parameters are low, in particular the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), resulting in an inferior overall efficiency. This should be mainly ascribed to the low shunt resistance (Rsh) arising from the less efficient electron blocking of the CuI/CuSCN (10:1) film. For CuI/CuSCN (1:1), the resultant device is subject to decreased Jsc and FF, and thus lower overall efficiency as compared to CuI/CuSCN (5:1), largely due to the relatively lower electrical conductivity of the former composition linked to less efficient charge extraction/collection and higher series resistance (Rs). Thus, the composite CuI/CuSCN films (5:1) were chosen for in-depth study if not otherwise stated.
The photovoltaic performances of PSCs with different thicknesses of the CuI/CuSCN composite, CuI, and CuSCN HTLs are presented in Table S3.† The J–V characteristics of the best PSCs based on the CuI/CuSCN composite, CuI, and CuSCN HTLs under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) are displayed in Fig. 5c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The champion device based on the CuI/CuSCN HTL affords an impressive PCE of 18.76%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 22.33 mW cm−2, and a FF of 0.76. In contrast, all the photovoltaic parameters of the CuI-based device are lower (Voc 1.05 V, Jsc 20.05 mW cm−2, and FF 0.69), resulting in a PCE of 14.53%. This can be mainly attributed to the reduced shunt resistance (Rsh) derived from the J–V measurement (Table 1), stemming from the less efficient electron blocking of the CuI HTL. The best PSCs with the CuSCN HTL show a PCE of 16.66%, which is also lower than that of the CuI/CuSCN-based device, because of the decreased Jsc (20.76 mW cm−2) and FF (0.73) linked to the lower electrical conductivity of pristine CuSCN (increased Rs and reduced Rsh, Table 1). The hysteresis of the J–V curves for PSCs with the three HTLs was studied in different scan directions as shown in Fig. S7,† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S4.† Notably, the devices based on the composite material and CuSCN exhibit negligible hysteresis, whereas a small hysteresis effect is observed for the CuI-based device.

To verify the device performance obtained from the J–V characterization, we further examined the steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power point over time under full sun irradiation as shown in Fig. S8.† The corresponding stabilized PCEs of PSCs based on the three different HTLs are given in Fig. 5d. The CuI/CuSCN-based device shows a stabilized PCE of 18.09%, which is substantially higher than the corresponding values for the devices containing CuI (14.27%) and CuSCN (16.55%), in good consistence with the results obtained from the J–V measurements.

Fig. 5e shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs using CuI/CuSCN, CuI, and CuSCN as HTLs. The device containing CuI/CuSCN shows higher IPCE values than CuI and CuSCN based devices over the whole region tested. The integrated current densities for CuI/CuSCN, CuI, and CuSCN based devices are calculated to be 22.25, 19.78, and 21.01 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with the trend of Jsc observed from the J–V curves. The reproducibility of the PSCs employing the three different HTLs was also investigated based on 20 identical devices as given in Fig. 5f. The statistical data show small standard deviations, indicating good device reproducibility. The average PCEs of PSCs based on CuI/CuSCN, CuI, and CuSCN are 18.28 ± 0.27%, 13.82 ± 0.50%, and 15.93 ± 0.51%, respectively.
To gain insights into the hole extraction capability of different HTLs, we conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements of the glass/perovskite and the glass/HTL/perovskite. As shown in Fig. 6a, the perovskite film exhibits an intense PL emission peak centered at 763 nm. The presence of the HTL clearly quenches the PL emission. A stronger quenching effect is observed for the composite film in comparison to the CuI and CuSCN films. Accordingly, the composite sample also shows the fastest PL decay rate as compared to pristine CuI and CuSCN (Fig. 6b). The average PL lifetimes are calculated to be 81.56 ns for glass/perovskite, 4.27 ns for glass/the composite/perovskite, 6.54 ns for glass/CuSCN/perovskite, and 19.43 ns for glass/CuI/perovskite, based on a bi-exponential fitting as reported previously (Table S5†).25 The results from the PL measurements indicate that the composite material could facilitate more effective hole extraction from the perovskite.

The dark J–V characteristics of PSCs with the three different HTLs were further studied as depicted in Fig. 6c. The device containing CuI/CuSCN displays an almost two orders of magnitude lower dark current density than the CuI-based device. This can be ascribed to the improved electron blocking capability of the smooth and uniform composite film, which can effectively prevent direct contact between the ITO substrate and the perovskite. This will reduce the charge carrier recombination losses and thus lead to the higher Voc obtained for the CuI/CuSCN-based device. No significant difference of the dark current density is observed between the composite and CuSCN based devices.
To better understand the charge transfer dynamics in PSCs with different HTLs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under dark conditions at a bias voltage close to Voc (1.0 V) in the frequency range 1 MHz to 10 mHz. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots, which can be fitted by an equivalent circuit model including Rs and charge-carrier-transport resistance (Rtransport) at the interfaces as shown in the inset of Fig. 6d.41 The device based on CuI/CuSCN shows a Rtransport of 310.6 Ω, which is significantly smaller than the corresponding values of CuI (594.4 Ω) and CuSCN (405.2 Ω). The much larger Rtransport observed for the CuI-based device should be most likely attributed to the enlarged contact resistance at the HTL/perovskite interface associated with the inhomogeneous and rough surface of the CuI underlayer, resulting in less efficient hole transport. As for the CuSCN-based device, the larger Rtransport can be interpreted as a consequence of the slower charge-carrier-transport process arising from the relatively lower electrical conductivity of pristine CuSCN with respect to the composite material. Therefore, the more efficient hole extraction and transport of the composite HTL leads to the much enhanced Jsc and FF and thus the higher overall efficiency for the CuI/CuSCN-based device.
Furthermore, the stability of PSC devices (ten cells) incorporating CuI/CuSCN as the HTL was also tested under continuous simulated one sun illumination at a temperature around 25 °C and humidity about 50%. The preliminary results regarding the evolution of the photovoltaic parameters for a representative PSC device are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S6.† The device was fairly stable and maintained ∼90% of its initial PCE after 156 h.
Conclusions
In summary, low-temperature solution-processed CuI/CuSCN composites have been successfully demonstrated to be effective HTLs for inverted planar PSCs. The CuI/CuSCN composites combine the advantageous properties of their parental materials, i.e., high electrical conductivity and good film morphology. As a consequence, the champion PSC device based on the composite CuI/CuSCN HTL yields a PCE of 18.76%, surpassing the corresponding values of the respective devices with pristine CuI (14.53%) and CuSCN (16.66%). This value is among the top efficiencies reported thus far for CuI- and CuSCN-based HTLs in PSCs.
Notably, CuI/CuSCN composite films can be solution-processed at room temperature, which makes them suitable HTL candidates for flexible PSCs and roll-to-roll manufacture. The good electrical properties and film morphology of CuI/CuSCN composite films also render them well suited as hole-selective layers to be further studied in other optoelectronic devices, such as organic solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and thin-film transistors. It is also worth mentioning that the high transparency of CuI/CuSCN composite films originating from the large band-gaps of CuI and CuSCN enables them to be utilized in semi-transparent solar cells for power-generating windows as well as in the top cell of tandem photovoltaic systems. This work not only reveals that solution-processed CuI/CuSCN composite materials are promising HTL candidates for low-cost and efficient PSCs but also demonstrates the enormous potential of CuI/CuSCN composite materials as hole-selective layers for a wide range of optoelectronic applications.
