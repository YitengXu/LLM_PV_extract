    , Accepted 6th August 2012First published on 6th August 2012AbstractA green approach for the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite to graphene is reported. After the exfoliation of graphite, the 9-anthracene carboxylate ion (ACA), which was used as an electrolyte, was adsorbed on the surface of graphene through noncovalent interaction. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the exfoliation of graphite to graphene. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses show the formation of single layer graphene. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirm the noncovalent attachment of ACA on the surface of graphene. The 9-anthracene carboxylic acid modified graphene (ACEG) shows good electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 577 F g−1 in 1 M H2SO4. The ACEG electrode shows 83.4% retention in specific capacitance after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. A high coulombic efficiency of 102% is also observed indicating its suitability as energy storage electrode materials.
1. Introduction
Sustainable and renewable energy sources have become a major topic of research, due to the exponential depletion of fossil fuels and for the reduction of environmental pollution. As a green energy storage device, supercapacitors, also called electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), are one of the unique types of electrical storage devices, which can efficiently store much more energy and offer high power density with excellent cycle life than batteries or conventional capacitors.1–4 The supercapacitor has high specific capacitance because of the high surface areas of its electrode materials and thin electrolytic dielectrics. Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors have multiple potential applications, including backup power sources and storage components, in important electronic devices, vehicles, solar cells and wind power devices, etc. Although supercapacitors are constructed in much the same way as conventional capacitors, the structures and properties of their electrode materials are different. Highly porous electrodes have been used in supercapacitors instead of the metal electrodes, which are used in conventional capacitors.1–4 The energy storage capacity of a supercapacitor depends greatly on the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the proper potential of the faradic oxidation/reduction reaction between the electrode and electrolyte. For the formation of an electrical double layer in the supercapacitor, carbon-based materials are the best because of their high electron transport, good wettability with the electrolyte, high porosity for ion mobility, excellent chemical and electrochemical stability and cost-effectiveness.3,4
A graphene-based electrode shows good electrochemical performance due to its excellent electronic and electrical properties, high surface area, good chemical stability and easy processability, as compared to other carbon allotropes.5,6 However, pristine graphene always agglomerates due to the π–π interaction and hydrophobic nature, preventing its performance as a supercapacitor electrode material. Oxidized graphene, although it does not aggregate and thus shows improved wettability, has major shortcomings of low electrical conductivity and poor electrochemical stability. Therefore, surface modification of graphene using appropriate functional groups may be the best solution to overcome the aforementioned problems.4
Several techniques have been successfully developed to prepare functionalized graphene. In one chemical method, graphene oxide is functionalized and then reduced using chemical reducing agents.7,8 However, this method suffers from limitations, such as the use of hazardous chemicals in the oxidation–reduction processes. It also produces surface defects in the functionalized graphene, which may degrade the electrical and electrochemical properties of the functionalized graphene.9 In contrast, highly crystalline and defect free graphene can be synthesized by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) techniques. But surface modification of CVD grown graphene is not as easy as chemically derived graphene. Moreover, the transfer of CVD grown graphene from metal to a useable substrate is laborious and very often causes damage to the graphene. On the other hand, electrochemical exfoliation is an environmentally friendly method that exfoliates graphite to graphene in the presence of a functionalizing agent.10–12 Moreover, this is a one-step method that does not involve the destructive oxidations of graphite. Therefore, it is more desirable to prepare a single layer graphene sheet directly from graphite, and at the same time to functionalize the surface of a graphene sheet to prevent restacking. The alternative way to prepare functionalized graphene in one step is the sonochemical exfoliation of graphite by the intercalation–exfoliation route.13–15 This method is more advantageous than the other methods because it can produce functionalized graphene of high electrical conductivity and large surface area.13–16 However, the yield is typically less than 2.5% of the total amount of the starting materials. Therefore, the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite to graphene is receiving much attention. In this work, electrochemical exfoliation was performed in an aqueous medium at a constant DC power supply. 9-Anthracene carboxylic (9-ACA) acid was used as the surface functionalizing material to improve the dispersion capacity and specific capacitance of functionalized graphene by the faradic reaction of carboxylic acid groups. 9-ACA is a fluorescent material that has been successfully used in solar cells for its good electron transfer capability after absorbing photon energy.17,18 The electrochemically exfoliated materials were characterized to establish the structure and its electrochemical performances were evaluated to determine its feasibility as a green energy storage material.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
High-purity graphite rods were supplied from Qingdao Xinlei Graphite Produce Co., Ltd., China. The surface modifier, 9-ACA, was purchased from Fluka, Germany. Sodium hydroxide, H2SO4 (99%), and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Samchun Pure Chemical Co. Ltd., Korea. ITO was purchased from Leagis, Korea.
2.2. Preparation of electrochemically functionalized graphene
Graphene sheets were synthesized from a graphite rod (used as cathode and anode) by using a DC power supply with an IT 6721 model potentiostat (I-tec Electronic Co., Korea). The separation between the cathode and anode was maintained as 2 cm. About 0.1 g of 9-ACA was dissolved in 100 ml water containing a few drops of 1 (M) sodium hydroxide solution, and the resulting solution was used as the electrolyte. A constant voltage (∼20 V) from the DC power supply was applied between the two electrodes for 10 h. Finally, black dispersion appeared which was washed with DI water and filtered through a 0.1 μm (pore size) cellulose acetate membrane until the pH of the supernatant reached to 7. The obtained product was dispersed in water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm to remove the heavy particles. The final material was designated as ACEG (9-ACA assisted electrochemically exfoliated graphene) and used for further characterization.
2.3. Preparation of electrode for cyclic voltammetry characterization
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was cleaned before using it to make a working electrode. It was sonicated with a water bath sonicator for 20 min in water, acetone and 2-propanol, respectively. It was then kept in a hydrogen peroxide, water and ammonium hydroxide (1:5:1) mixture at 100 °C for 1 h. The cleaned ITO glass was dried under nitrogen atmosphere before materials were cast on it. A thin uniform ACEG–Nafion composite film (area of 1 cm × 1 cm) was deposited on the ITO glass for electrochemical analysis.
2.4. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of pure graphite and ACEG was performed at room temperature on a D/Max 2500 V/PC (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at a scan rate of 2° (2θ) min−1. The UV-visible spectroscopy of ACEG in water was measured by a Perkin-Elmer λ-900 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements of pure graphite and ACEG were carried out using the Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) over the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1. The chemical characteristics of pure graphite and ACEG were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (AXIS-NOVA, Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK) in KBSI Jeonju Center. The Raman spectra of pure graphite and ACEG were obtained on Nanofinder 30 (Tokyo Instruments Co., Osaka, Japan). Atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope IV, Multimode AFM, Veeco Metrology Group, Santa Barbara, CA) of ACEG was performed with non-contact mode using the V-shaped “ultralever” probe B. The sample for AFM analysis was prepared by depositing ACEG dispersion in water on a cleaned silica substrate and allowing them to dry in air. Transmission electron microscopy images of ACEG were recorded with a JEOL JEM-2200 FS, Japan. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), which would give the charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of ACEG, was performed by the CH660D electrochemical workstation. The electrochemical performances of ACEG were examined by using three electrode systems in 1 M H2SO4 solution: Ag/AgCl is the reference electrode, platinum is the counter electrode, and ITO is the working electrode. Coulombic efficiency was calculated using equation η = Td/Tc × 100%, where η is the coulombic efficiency, and Tc and Td are the charging and discharging time respectively.19
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Electrochemical exfoliation mechanism
The exfoliation of graphite occurred through electrode swelling as in the case of ionic liquids and poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate).20,21 The exact mechanism for graphene formation through electrochemical exfoliation is still unclear. But it is expected that at first the 9-anthracene carboxylate (ACA) ions were adsorbed on the surface of a positive electrode (anode) by electrostatic interaction. Subsequently, the graphite layers along with the ACA were separated from the anode under electrical potential and swelled in the aqueous solution. The free ACA ions again adsorbed on the surface of the anode and the process was continued for a long time until the graphite anode was corroded completely. In contrast, the weight of the graphite cathode remained unchanged after electrochemical exfoliation. However, the migration of dissolved graphene sheets from one electrode to another during the exfoliation process and the probability of unknown reactions cannot be ruled out. The exfoliated graphene layers in aqueous solution are stabilized by ACA through noncovalent interaction.
3.2. TEM and AFM analysis
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were performed to check the morphology of ACEG. Fig. 1a clearly shows the existence of thin ACEG sheets on the Cu-grid. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 1b) indicates the formation of a single layer ACEG. In addition, a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1c) indicates that the plane crystallinity was preserved after exfoliation and formation of a single layer ACEG sheet.15,22 The intensity of the diffraction spots decreased, as compared to pristine graphene or graphite, which may be ascribed to the presence of ACA on the surface of graphene.23,24

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to investigate the topographic height of ACEG. The average thickness of ACEG was 0.79 nm, as shown in Fig. 2. Considering the adsorption of ACA on the surface of a graphene sheet, the observed thickness indicates the formation of single layer ACEG by electrochemical exfoliation.22

3.3. UV-Vis analysis
The dispersion characteristics of ACEG in water were first characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and are shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum of 9-ACA shows three peaks at 330, 346, 360 and 383 nm. In contrast, an ACEG spectrum shows a single absorption peak at 256 nm, which arises due to the sp2-network structure of graphene. However, no significant peaks related to 9-ACA appeared in the ACEG spectrum. This may be due to the delocalization of the π-electron clouds of graphene and 9-ACA by noncovalent interaction. Zhang et al. reported a similar observation for 9-ACA functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes.18 The digital photograph of ACEG dispersion in water is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The dispersion was stable for more than 90 days.

3.4. XRD analysis

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of graphite and ACEG. The interlayer distance of pure graphite was 0.34 nm, as indicated by the (002) reflection peak near 26.0°. It shows an additional peak (004) at 2θ = 54.2°, corresponding to an interlayer distance of 0.17 nm. In contrast, the (002) peak disappears in the XRD pattern of ACEG, suggesting complete exfoliation of graphite to graphene under constant electrical potential.15

3.5. FT-IR analysis

Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra of pure graphite, 9-ACA and ACEG. FT-IR spectra were used to elucidate the interaction between 9-ACA and graphene. A sharp intense band at 3436 cm−1 corresponding to -OH stretching vibrations appeared in the ACEG spectrum because of the oxidation of graphene during 9-ACA assisted electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. The pure graphite spectrum also shows a –OH stretching vibration band near 3436 cm−1, whose intensity is lower than that of ACEG. The peaks at 2928 and 2859 cm−1 indicate the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of CH2 groups. The appearance of a sharp peak at 1685 cm−1 in 9-ACA is attributed to the CO stretching vibration. The peak at 1634 cm−1 is attributed to the existence of a CC bond in pure graphite and graphene.23 The bands at 887 and 732 cm−1 in 9-ACA correspond to aromatic C–H stretching and out-of-plane bending vibration, respectively. Interestingly, all these peaks are shifted to a lower frequency region (811 and 701 cm−1) in the ACEG, which is attributed to the noncovalent interaction of 9-ACA with graphene. A broad peak at ∼1234 cm−1 in the ACEG spectrum is attributed to the presence of phenolic, ketone and epoxy groups in ACEG, which might have been generated by the oxidation of graphene during the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. FT-IR results confirm the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, which may help to increase the water dispersibility and pseudocapacitance of ACEG.

3.6. XPS analysis
XPS of pure graphite and ACEG was used to investigate the chemical information of functionalized graphene and to find clear evidence of its formation. Fig. 6a and b shows the XPS of pure graphite and ACEG. The appearance of a band at 286.4 eV in the pure graphite is due to the presence of –OH functionalities and a sharp peak at 284.6 eV is ascribed to the CC/C–C. In contrast, the positions and intensities of these peaks changed in the XPS of ACEG. Moreover, the new peaks related to CO (287.5 eV), –COOH (288.7 eV) and π–π* (290.5 eV) appeared in the XPS result of ACEG. These oxygen functionalities may have resulted from the oxidation of functionalized graphene during electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. Thus, as is evident from the XPS analyses, the graphite can be exfoliated to graphene and functionalized to ACEG simultaneously. The changes in the peak positions can be explained by the different carbon environments between ACEG and graphite.15,19,22,24 Elemental analysis shows that ACEG contains ∼22.48% of oxygen. The amount of oxygen in ACEG is not only due to the oxidation of graphite but also contributed by the carboxylate functionalities of ACA molecules, which are noncovalently attached to the surface of graphene. The carboxylate functionalities of ACEG facilitate electrode–electrolyte interaction and directly contribute to the specific capacitance of ACEG by faradic reaction in H+ ion rich electrolyte media.

3.7. Raman spectra analysis
Raman spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying the electronic structure and defect concentration in graphene. The presence of ACA and the number of layers in ACEG can be measured by ID/IG ratio analysis and the shift in the positions of the peaks. Fig. 7 shows that the intensity of the G-band (1581 cm−1) in graphite is significantly higher than that of the D-band (1357 cm−1). However, after electrochemical exfoliation, the positions of both the D and G bands changed to 1298 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1, respectively. This change in the D-band position is closely associated with the change in the electronic structure of ACEG, due to the charge transfer between the electron donor (graphene) and acceptor (9-ACA).18,25 Moreover, the ID/IG ratio is dramatically increased to 1.41 in ACEG as compared to pure graphite (ID/IG ratio ∼0.35). This increase in the ID/IG ratio suggests the adsorption of ACA on the surface of graphene. The 2D band of graphene can be used to determine the number of layers in graphene. However, the 2D band is absent in the ACEG due to the adsorption of electron acceptor ions, and ACA by the surface of graphene through π–π interaction. This result is in good agreement with the observation of Voggu et al. for tetracyanoethylene functionalized graphene.26

3.8. Electrochemical performance
The electrochemical performances of pure graphite and ACEG are shown Fig. 8. Pure graphite shows no significant peaks due to Faradic reaction. Moreover, the current response shown by the CV curve is very low, which is not effective for supercapacitor application. However, the CV loop area of the ACEG modified electrode changed dramatically. A pair of redox peaks appeared at −0.053 V and −0.17 V, respectively, which are attributed to the redox reaction of the –COOH functionalities of 9-ACA and also to the presence of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene. The presence of redox peaks and the large rectangle areas under CV curves indicates pseudocapacitance and EDLC behavior, respectively. The 9-ACA mediated redox mechanism is shown schematically in Fig. 9.27 The H+ ion of H2SO4 is involved in the redox reaction and migrated via carboxylic acid groups from the electrolyte to the electrode. Fig. 8 also shows the CV performance of ACEG at different scan rates. The CV curves of ACEG at various scan rates consist of large quasi-rectangular areas suggesting superior capacitive behaviour. The cathodic peaks shift toward the positive direction and the anodic peaks toward the negative direction with increasing scan rate due to the resistive effect of the electrode.19,28 The peak-to-peak separation at 10 mV scan rate was 117 mV due to the fast ion diffusion and quasi-reversible one-ion-transfer reaction between the electrode and electrolyte.29 The cyclic stability of ACEG was analyzed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 8b. The capacitive current response remains unchanged in the 10th cycle, indicating good cyclic stability in H2SO4 medium. However, at a high scan rate (200 mV s−1), the shapes of the CV curves distort severely, implying that the electrode reactions became electrochemically irreversible with increasing scan rate. CV measurements at a higher scan rate provoked either depletion or saturation of H+ ions inside the electrode due to the slow transfer process of H+ ions from the electrolyte to the electrode and vice versa.27 Therefore, ionic resistivity is the main reason for the observed distortion of CV curves at a high scan rate. According to Subramanian et al., specific capacitance depends on the available H+ ions on the electrode–electrolyte interface and thus is much more affected during the reduction process than in the oxidation step.30 In the current study, the redox reaction occurred via the oxygen functional groups, mainly by the carboxylate ion of 9-ACA, and the H+ ions of H2SO4.

The charge–discharge characteristics of pure graphite and ACEG at a current density of 7 A g−1 were analyzed (Fig. 10). The charging–discharging time was very short for pure graphite but much longer for ACEG. The asymmetrical structure of ACEG was due to pseudocapacitance. Interestingly, for ACEG, the charging time is less than discharging time, so it shows good storage behaviour of a supercapacitor. However, the initial portion of the discharge curve shows an IR drop due to the internal resistance of ACEG sheets.31 The specific capacitance of an electrode materials can be determined from the slope of the linear charge–discharge graph using the equation C = IΔt/mΔV, where I is the applied current, ΔV/Δt is the slope of the linear portion of the discharge curve and m is the mass of the deposited materials on the working electrode. The specific capacitance of pure graphite is determined to be 10 F g−1. It is noted from the CV and charge–discharge plot that the specific capacitance of pure graphite is originated by the nonfaradic capacitance. On the other hand, the specific capacitance of ACEG (577 F g−1) is contributed by both the pseudocapacitance and EDLC. The pseudocapacitance aroused due to the reversible redox reactions between the H+ ions of H2SO4 and the oxygen containing functional groups of ACEG. The –COOH and –OH functionalities contributed to the observed specific capacitance of ACEG without affecting the cyclic stability as shown in Fig. 8. The cyclic stability of the ACEG modified electrode was determined from the charge–discharge curve as shown in Fig. 10b. There was ∼1.2% decrease in specific capacitance in the first 100 cycles and ∼16% decrease between 100 and 390 cycles. This significant decrease in specific capacitance may be due to the instability of ITO in aqueous acidic media.32 However, no loss in specific capacitance was observed between 400 and 1000 charge–discharge cycles. This may be due to the reduction of oxygen functionalities of ACEG during electrochemical reaction and stabilization of electrode materials. This is in good agreement with previous reports.33 After 1000 cycles, the retention of specific capacitance was 83.4% as shown in the inset of Fig. 10b. The coulombic efficiency has been found to be 102%, indicating the suitability of ACEG as a storage device.19

EIS analysis was carried out to understand the properties of conductivity and ion diffusion in the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plot of ACEG is depicted in Fig. 11. It shows that in the low frequency region, the curve is mostly straight and parallel to the Z′′-axis (imaginary), confirming low diffusion resistance of ions and ideal capacitor behaviour of the electrode materials. The supercapacitor performance of an electrode increases with increasing the slope of the straight line. In contrast, the semicircle loop in the high frequency region (shown in the inset of Fig. 11) represents the electronic resistance inside the functionalized graphene sheets.22,34 The semicircle observed in the high frequency region indicates that the sheet resistance (∼1.4 Ω) of ACEG sheets is low. However, the observed resistance of ACEG is relatively high compared to the previous reports.35,36 This may be attributed to the adsorption of ACA on the surface of graphene and the presence of 22.48% oxygen functionalities as is evident from XPS elemental analysis. The EIS analysis further demonstrates long-term electrochemical stability. The high electrochemical performance of an ACEG modified electrode is due to the formation of single layer graphene (as shown in AFM analysis) with high electrical conductivity. Moreover, the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of ACEG improves the wettability of the electrode due to the superior electrode–electrolyte interaction.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a technique for functionalizing graphene by one-step electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in the presence of 9-ACA as a stabilizer. The alkaline solution of 9-ACA acts as the electrolyte during graphite exfoliation under constant potential and simultaneously functionalized the exfoliated graphene layers. XRD analysis indicates the exfoliation of graphite to graphene. The adsorption of ACA on the surface of graphene is confirmed by AFM, FT-IR, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The presence of carboxylate and other oxygen functionalities in ACEG is also confirmed. These oxygen functionalities facilitate reversible redox reaction, which results in high pseudocapacitance and high coulombic efficiency. Moreover, the presence of hydrophilic functional groups in ACEG facilitates excellent wettability of the electrode and thus enhances the supercapacitor performance. The specific capacitance of an ACEG-based electrode reaches 577 F g−1 in a 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. After 1000 charge–discharge cycles, the specific capacitance maintains 83.4% of initial specific capacitance. The ACEG electrode also exhibits good cycling stability at a high scan rate, indicating its suitability as a green energy storage material.
