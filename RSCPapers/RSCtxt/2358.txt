    , Accepted 25th November 2014First published on 26th November 2014AbstractThe pressure-dependent interactions between the ionic liquid mixture ([MPI][I1.5]) and nano-TiO2 surfaces have been studied up to 2.5 GPa. The results of infrared spectroscopic profiles of [MPI][I1.5] and [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2 indicated that no appreciable changes in the C–H stretching bands with the addition of nano-TiO2 were observed under ambient pressure. As the pressure was elevated to 0.7 GPa, the C–H stretching absorption of [MPI][I1.5] underwent band-narrowing and red-shifts in frequency. In contrast to the results of [MPI][I1.5], the spectra of [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2 do not show dramatic changes under high pressures. A possible explanation for this observation is the formation of certain pressure-enhanced C–H⋯nano-TiO2 interactions around the imidazolium C–H and alkyl C–H groups. As imidazolium C–H⋯I− is replaced by the weaker imidazolium C–H⋯polyiodide, the splitting of the imidazolium C–H stretching bands was observed. The experimental results indicate that both nano-TiO2 and polyiodides are capable of disturbing the self-assembly of ionic liquids. This study suggests the possibility to tune the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells via a high pressure method.
I. Introduction
In the dye-sensitized solar cells the dyes are absorbed on a nano-TiO2 network and the redox couple I−/I3− serves as the electrolyte.1,2 The use of an iodide (I−) compound and the addition of some amount of free iodine (I2) are required for original design of DSSCs. For this reason, the utility of imidazolium iodide–I2 mixtures for dye-sensitized solar cells has been reported, avoiding evaporation of conventional solvents.3–6 Some pioneering investigations have found that the diffusion of I3− and I− increases in ionic liquids with an increase in the concentration of I3− and I− in the I3−/I− system.7 The Grotthuss-like exchange mechanism was suggested to enhance the conductivity of the I3−/I− system. Compared with the intense investigations into the transport properties, there have been a few reports on local structures and aggregation behaviors of the I3−/I− system for dye-sensitized solar cells. In this study, we use variable pressure as a window into the structural organization of the C–H moiety in 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide–I2 mixtures.
Traditionally, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are immersed in organic solvents such as acetonitrile. Although high power conversion efficiency has been achieved for dye-sensitized solar cells, evaporation of the conventional organic solvents limits the long-term stability of DSSCs for outdoor applications.1,2 One of the simple ways to avoid the volatility of conventional solvents consists of using electrolytes with negligible vapor pressures such as ionic liquids.2–6 Ionic liquids are generally defined as organic salts with melting points below 100 °C and comprised entirely of ions.8–11 The ionic liquid cation often involves a positively charged nitrogen or phosphorus, such as imidazolium and phosphonium. The most extensively studied ionic liquids are the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium salts. Ionic liquids have a melting temperature around room temperature generally achieved by employing a bulky asymmetric organic cation to prevent ions from packing easily. This means a balance between electrostatic forces and geometric factors.10–12 One of the attractive features of the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation is the inherently amphiphilic character as a surfactant. Some researchers suggested that imidazolium-based ionic liquids may be considered as nanostructured with polar and nonpolar regions.13–16 The alkyl side chain length has an influence on the supramolecular assemblies and aggregation effects between alkyl tails may lead to an ordered local environment.9,17 The physical and chemical properties of ionic liquids are tunable through the selection of their cation and anion moieties.8,9 Consequently, ionic liquids are often denoted designer solvents because of the versatility of their properties. For example, Domanska8 and Bogel-Lukasik9 demonstrated that solubility and hydrophobicity of ionic liquids can be tuned as the alkyl chain length of the cation increases.
The ordering of ionic liquids at solid surfaces such as nano-TiO2 is a subject of intense research recently. In DSSCs the light absorption of the dyes is followed by an electron injection into the conduction band of the nano-TiO2 networks. The properties of interfacial ionic liquids are very complex and unusual which have been shown using experimental and theoretical methods. The self-assembly of ionic liquids and the local structures of ionic liquids in ionic liquid–nano-particle mixtures have been studied, and solvation layers are found at the solid–ionic liquid interfaces for various ionic liquids.18–20 Some researchers suggested the interplay between electrostatic forces and steric hindrance at the interfaces.18–20 Among the experimental methods that probe the structures at the solid–ionic liquid interfaces, vibrational spectroscopy has its own specific contribution especially on the local organization of C–H groups. In our previous study, changes to the alkyl C–H chain length of the imidazolium cation can be made to control the order and strength of ionic liquid–nano-TiO2 mixtures under high pressures.19 In this study, we demonstrate that the ionic liquid–nano-TiO2 interactions can be distinguished from cation–anion interactions using high pressure vibrational spectroscopy.
Recently interest in the effects of high pressure on intermolecular interactions has been growing in physicochemical studies. The combination of vibration spectroscopy and a high pressure method allows one to investigate, in a controlled way, how the hydrogen-bonded network responds to pressure variations.18–22 Pressures used to investigate chemical systems typically range from ambient to several GPa; such pressures mainly change intermolecular distances and affect conformations. In fact, pressures in excess of 30 GPa are required to change the electronic structures of a molecule. The changes in local structures of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium halides were monitored using infrared and Raman spectroscopies.23 These results suggested that the butyl chain of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride undergoes conformation changes above a pressure of 0.3 GPa. High pressures strengthen the imidazolium C2–H⋯Cl− interactions and the C2–H⋯Cl− contact is switched to hydrogen-bond like interactions upon compression. To get further information about weak hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids, we probe the CH⋯I− and C–H⋯I3− interactions with pressure in this study.
II. Experimental section
Samples were prepared using 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide ([MPI][I], 98.0%, Aldrich, <0.3% water), iodine (99.8%, Aldrich), and titanium(IV) oxide nanopowder (anatase, 99.7%, Aldrich). A diamond anvil cell (DAC) of Merril–Bassett design, having a diamond culet size of 0.6 mm, was used for generating pressures up to ca. 2 GPa. Two type-IIa diamonds were used for mid-infrared measurements. The sample was contained in a 0.3 mm-diameter hole in a 0.25 mm-thick inconel gasket mounted on the diamond anvil cell. To reduce the absorbance of the samples, CaF2 crystals (prepared from a CaF2 optical window) were placed into the holes and compressed firmly prior to inserting the samples. A droplet of a sample filled the empty space of the entire hole of the gasket in the DAC, which was subsequently sealed when the opposed anvils were pushed toward one another. Infrared spectra of the samples were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Fourier transform spectrophotometer (model Spectrum RXI) equipped with a LITA (lithium tantalite) mid-infrared detector. The infrared beam was condensed through a 5× beam condenser onto the sample in the diamond anvil cell. Typically, we chose a resolution of 4 cm−1 (data point resolution of 2 cm−1). For each spectrum, typically 1000 scans were compiled. To remove the absorption of the diamond anvils, the absorption spectra of DAC were measured first and subtracted from those of the samples. Pressure calibration follows Wong's method.24,25 The spectra of samples measured at ambient pressure were taken by filling samples in a cell having two CaF2 windows without the spacers.
III. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 displays infrared spectra of pure 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide ([MPI][I], Fig. 1a), [MPI][I1.5] (Fig. 1b), [MPI][I2.4] (Fig. 1c), and [MPI][I5.5] (Fig. 1d) obtained under ambient pressure. The infrared spectrum of [MPI][I] (Fig. 1a) exhibits three resolved bands at 2875, 2938, and 2964 cm−1 corresponding to C–H stretching vibration of the alkyl groups, and the absorption peaks at 3074 and 3138 cm−1 can be attributed to coupled imidazolium C–H stretching modes. As iodine was added, no appreciable changes in band frequency of the alkyl C–H bands are observed in Fig. 1. Nevertheless, the blue shifts of the imidazolium C–H bands are obvious as the concentration of iodine increases in Fig. 1. As revealed in Fig. 1b, the imidazolium C–H bands are blue-shifted to 3080 and 3140 cm−1, respectively. We note that the 3074 cm−1 band is more concentration-sensitive than the band at ca. 3138 cm−1. These results are remarkably different from what is revealed for the alkyl groups, and this discrepancy in frequency shift should be related to the mechanism of weak hydrogen bonds.26–29 A possible explanation for blue-shifts of the imidazolium C–H bands is the perturbation of imidazolium C–H⋯ anion interactions upon the addition of iodine. We stress that the aggregation of ionic liquids is a general trend in the literature,30–32 and the I− anion may be bound to the imidazolium cation for pure [MPI][I].4,23 The blueshifts of imidazolium C–H stretches observed in Fig. 1 may be attributed to the replacement of a stronger imidazolium C–H⋯I− hydrogen bonding with an interaction of imidazolium C–H⋯I3−. According to the results in Fig. 1, the imidazolium C–H groups seem to be more favorable sites for C–H⋯I− (or C–H⋯I3−) than the alkyl C–H groups. As the imidazolium C–H⋯I− is replaced by the weaker imidazolium C–H⋯I3− interactions, the structural organization of ionic liquids may be disturbed. As revealed in Fig. 1c, we observe the splitting of the imidazolium C–H bands located at 3088, 3104, and 3141 cm−1, respectively. The spectral features in Fig. 1d show further evolution and splitting as the imidazolium C–H stretching bands were shifted to 3090, 3112, 3137, and 3151 cm−1, respectively. These results in Fig. 1c and d provide the experimental evidence that further addition of iodine may lead to the formation of various polyiodides such as I3− and I5−. Structures of polyiodides have also been investigated by Raman spectroscopic studies.4 The presence of higher polyiodides was explained in terms of aggregation of simpler subunits, i.e., I−, I2, and I3−.

Fig. 2 displays IR spectra of pure 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide ([MPI][I]) obtained under ambient pressure (curve a), and at 0.4 (curve b), 0.7 (curve c), 1.1 (curve d), 1.5 (curve e), 1.8 (curve f), and 2.5 GPa (curve g). As the pressure was elevated to 0.4 GPa, the alkyl C–H absorption bands became separated to four bands at 2879, 2943, 2964, and 2983 cm−1 in Fig. 2b. The pressure-induced blue shift and splitting of the alkyl C–H bands may originate from the combined effect of alkyl C–H⋯I− contacts, overlap repulsion enhanced by hydrostatic pressure, and so forth. The imidazolium C–H bands display frequency shifts and splitting into bands at 3049, 3075, 3088, and 3141 cm−1 in Fig. 2b. In contrast to the blue-shift of alkyl C–H bands in Fig. 2b, the dominant imidazolium C–H band is red shifted from 3080 cm−1 (Fig. 2a) to 3049 cm−1 (Fig. 2b) upon compression. This anomalous pressure-induced red frequency shift may be related to the charge-enhanced acidity of the imidazolium C2–H group. For imidazolium C2–H, the electrostatic component may play a significant role in a imidazolium C2–H⋯I− hydrogen bond, whereas, for weakly polarized alkyl C–H groups, the electrostatic component may be of similar magnitude to the other factors such as polarization, charge transfer, dispersion, and steric repulsion.26 As the pressure was elevated in Fig. 2c–g, the alkyl C–H bands were blue-shifted. Upon further compression, the steric contribution may become more repulsive and result in an increase in frequency in Fig. 2c–g. Our results in Fig. 2 indicate that imidazolium C2–H⋯I− interactions may be conventional hydrogen bond-like due to the charge-enhanced effect. Nevertheless, the alkyl C–H⋯I− shows the characteristics of blue-shifting hydrogen bonding.26–29

Fig. 3 displays IR spectra of a [MPI][I1.5] mixture recorded at ambient pressure (curve a), and at 0.4 (curve b), 0.7 (curve c), 1.1 (curve d), 1.5 (curve e), 1.8 (curve f), and 2.5 GPa (curve g). As the pressure was elevated to 0.4 GPa, the C–H stretching bands were blue-shifted to 2879, 2942, 2976, 3091, and 3142 cm−1, respectively, in Fig. 3b. In contrast to the results of pure [MPI][I] in Fig. 2b, we observed no significant changes in spectral features upon the compression of [MPI][I1.5] to 0.4 GPa in Fig. 3b. This observation suggests that the presence of I3− leads to a significant perturbation in the phase behavior. It is likely that the hydrogen-bonding patterns and packing are determined by the relative hydrogen-bonding acceptor strength of I− and I3−. The C–H stretching modes underwent dramatic changes in their spectral features as the pressure was elevated to 0.7 GPa in Fig. 3c. Weak hydrogen bonds, such as C–H⋯X and C–H⋯O, have received much attention in the literature owing to their many interesting characteristics.26–29 Various studies have showed that the C–H stretching frequency tends to blue-shift as a result of formation of a hydrogen bond with a Lewis base. In the past, several models have been proposed for the theoretical understanding of the blue-shifting hydrogen bonds. Scheiner's group26 and Dannenberg's group27 view conventional hydrogen bonds and C–H weak hydrogen bonds to be very similar in nature. The result in Fig. 3c indicates that the I3− anion perturbs the ionic liquid aggregations in the polar (imidazolium C–H) region under high pressures. When [MPI][I1.5] that is capable of forming a blue-shifting imidazolium C–H hydrogen bond (revealed in Fig. 3a and b) is compressed by increasing the pressure, [MPI][I1.5] displays a red-shifting hydrogen bond (seen in Fig. 3b and c) caused by enhancement of weak hydrogen bonding and changes in the hydrogen bonding network.19–21 As revealed in Fig. 3c, the imidazolium C–H stretching absorptions may be described by four bands (two doublets).32 One doublet locates at lower frequency, i.e., 3049 and 3086 cm−1, and another doublet vibrates at higher frequency, i.e., 3144 and 3160 cm−1. The nearly degenerated imidazolium C–H splitting bands suggest the existence of at least two hydrogen bonding structures (microheterogeneity).32 The hydrogen bonding structures may include larger ion clusters (associated configuration) with weaker hydrogen bonding to the counteranion and smaller ion clusters (isolated configuration) with stronger hydrogen bonding.

Fig. 4 displays IR spectra of a [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2 mixture (10 wt% nano-TiO2) obtained under ambient pressure (curve a), and at 0.4 (curve b), 0.7 (curve c), 1.1 (curve d), 1.5 (curve e), 1.8 (curve f), and 2.5 GPa (curve g). Comparing the spectral features in Fig. 4a with those in Fig. 3a, no appreciable changes in C–H bands in the presence of nano-TiO2 were observed under ambient pressure in Fig. 4a. As the pressure was elevated to 2.5 GPa (Fig. 4g), the blue-shifts of both alkyl and imidazolium C–H bands are obvious. We stress that the spectra do not show band-narrowing and red-shifts in frequency in Fig. 4, and the C–H bands display monotonic blue-shifts in frequency as the sample was compressed in Fig. 4. This result is remarkably different from that revealed for the C–H bands in Fig. 3. Our results in Fig. 4b–g indicate that the presence of nano-TiO2 perturbs the ionic association of [MPI][I1.5]. A possible explanation for this observation is the formation of certain pressure-enhanced C–H⋯nano-TiO2 or C–H⋯O interactions around the imidazolium C–H and alkyl C–H groups, but the details remain unclear. In other words, nano-TiO2 can be added to change the hydrogen-bonded network of [MPI][I1.5] as the pressure is elevated. The surface of nano-TiO2 is usually covered with a certain amount of Ti–OH (titanol) groups. The ionic liquid–titanol interactions may also play a non-negligible role in Fig. 4.

Fig. 5 shows the pressure dependence of the dominant imidazolium C–H stretching frequencies of pure [MPI][I], [MPI][I1.5], and [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2 mixtures. Analysis of the pressure dependence of the dominant imidazolium C–H band of pure [MPI][I] yields a significant red frequency shift in Fig. 5. This behavior is consistent with the general trend observed of a red shift with pressure for O–H and CO stretching modes in strongly hydrogen-bonded O–H⋯O and CO⋯H systems, respectively.33 As revealed in Fig. 5, the imidazolium C–H band of [MPI][I1.5] displays non-monotonic pressure dependence. It blue-shifts initially, then red-shifts as the pressure is elevated. It is known that hydrogen-bonded networks can be modified by varying pressure.18–23 The anomalous frequency shift of [MPI][I1.5] can be attributed to both the cooperative and geometric effects of hydrogen bonds. The pressure dependence of the [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2 mixture shows a blue frequency shift of ca. 3 cm−1 GPa−1, which corresponds to contraction of the C–H bond. This study indicates that a high pressure technique can serve as a useful tool to probe the strength of weak C–H hydrogen bonding, i.e., [MPI][I] > [MPI][I1.5] > [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2, under high pressures.

Fig. 6 displays IR spectra of a [MPI][I2.4] mixture obtained under ambient pressure (curve a), and at 0.4 (curve b), 0.7 (curve c), 1.1 (curve d), 1.5 (curve e), 1.8 (curve f), and 2.5 GPa (curve g). As the sample was compressed in Fig. 6b–g, both alkyl and imidazolium C–H bands display blue-shifts in frequency. Analogous to the spectral features of C–H groups of [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2 in Fig. 4, we observe no red-shifts in frequency and band-narrowing of C–H bands under high pressures for [MPI][I2.4] in Fig. 6. Our results suggest that both polyiodides (Fig. 6) and nano-TiO2 (Fig. 4) can be used to switch the red-shifting imidazolium C–H hydrogen bonding to blue-shifting C–H hydrogen bonding. The surfaces of nano-TiO2 appear to be capable of breaking or weakening the cation–anion interactions as a result of the formation of stable cation–nano-TiO2 and anion–nano-TiO2 interactions under high pressure. The results of this study suggest the potential for tuning the power conversion efficient of dye-sensitized solar cells through changes in pressure.

IV. Conclusion
Pressure-dependent behaviors of [MPI][I]–I2 and [MPI][I]–I2–nano-TiO2 mixtures were studied in this work. The infrared spectral features indicate that both nano-TiO2 and polyiodides are capable of disturbing the self-assembly of ionic liquids under high pressures. The results of this study suggest that a high pressure method may allow one to tune the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells as a result of the formation of pressure-enhanced C–H⋯nano-TiO2 interactions. As iodine was mixed with [MPI][I], the blue shifts of imidazolium C–H bands are obviously caused by the perturbation of imidazolium C–H⋯ anion interactions. Our results also provide the experimental evidence that further addition of iodine may lead to the formation of various polyiodides such as I3− and I5−. The relative strength of C–H hydrogen bonding, i.e., [MPI][I] > [MPI][I1.5] > [MPI][I1.5]–nano-TiO2, was investigated by varying the pressure.
