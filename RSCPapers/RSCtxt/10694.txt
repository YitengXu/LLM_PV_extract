    , Accepted 5th April 2017First published on 5th April 2017AbstractThis study was mainly aimed at designing molecular p–n heterojunctions on the surface of N-doped TiO2 for visible-light hydrogen evolution. A series of NiO/N-TiO2 samples were prepared via NH3-postnitridation of nickel oxide-modified TiO2. H2 production from ethanol/water solution was utilized as a model reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic properties of the catalysts. Compared to N-TiO2, a 90-fold-enhanced H2 evolution rate was achieved over the optimal NiO/N-TiO2 catalyst with a 0.5 wt% Ni content. Detailed characterizations clearly showed that loading NiO via wet impregnation leads to high dispersion of Ni2+ species on the surface oxygen vacancy (Vo) sites of the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, predominantly presenting mononuclear Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters on the surface of TiO2 in the case of low Ni content. These surface heteroatomic clusters can speed up the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers of N-TiO2. It can thus be established that the molecular Ti–O–Ni heterojunctions are the main contributors to the synergistic enhancement of H2 evolution, whereas NiO nanoclusters are not responsible for the photoactivity. Only one of the N species, N–Ti–Vo, was active and effective for this cooperation with the hydrogen-releasing Ni sites, which can induce ca. 20-fold improvement of hydrogen production over NiO/TiO2 under visible light irradiation.
1 Introduction
With the gradual depletion of fossil fuels and the concomitant environmental issues, currently, the requirement for new energy sources is becoming more urgent.1,2 Hydrogen, possessing the energetic power of 285 kJ mol−1, has been considered as an eco-friendly fuel and a promising alternative to fossil energy sources, and it has attracted significant attention from the researchers.3,4 During the past few decades, photocatalytic H2 production from water using solar irradiation and semiconductor materials was universally recognized as an ideal and viable technique for producing renewable and clean energy.5,6 However, most of the developed photocatalytic materials present poor quantum efficiency under visible light due to (1) a wide band gap and limited visible light absorption, (2) low separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and (3) lack of surface active sites for H2 evolution, which limits their practical application.7 Among these, the most important point is how to enhance charge separation and create more active sites for the solar-to-hydrogen conversion.
Among various hydrogen-generating photocatalysts, TiO2 has been regarded as the best photocatalyst due to its low-cost, environmentally friendly nature, and high chemical stability. However, the large band-gap 3.2 eV and high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers have severely restricted its efficiency. Instead of searching for a new type of single visible-response photocatalytic material, simple modification of commonly studied wide-gap semiconductors is a facile and viable strategy to produce applicable photocatalysts.8–13 Currently, several strategies including doping metallic or nonmetallic ions, dye sensitization, loading noble metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu, or supporting metal oxides or sulfides have been developed to expand the light absorption of the UV-responsive photocatalyst to the visible light region, or to improve the charge separation.14–19 Owing to the reuse and recycle limit of an organic dye, as well as the relatively exorbitant price of noble metals, nonmetallic ion (such as N, F, C, and O) doping is widely used as a cheaper strategy to alter the optical and photocatalytic properties of the oxide semiconductor.20–24 Compared to F, C or S elements, N dopant is found to be more beneficial for narrowing the band-gap and expanding the light absorption to the visible-light region. Asahi et al.25 first reported the N doping into substitutional sites of TiO2 for visible light photocatalysis in 2001. After this, Zhang et al.26 identified in detail the visible light photoactive centers of N-doped TiO2 photocatalysts and proposed a local excitation mechanism based on the surface (Ti4+–N3−) unit. Moreover, N doping creates a large amount of oxygen vacancies, acting as carrier recombination centers on the surface and bulk of TiO2 nanoparticles,27 which is highly detrimental to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, a few studies were carried out to improve the visible light photocatalysis ability by the synergy of N and metallic dopant or metal oxides.28–33 For example, Zhang et al.32 prepared Mo and N co-doped TiO2 to enhance the visible-light photodegradation of methylene blue and methyl violet. Li et al.33 synthesized Cr and N co-doped TiO2 to improve the visible-light photocatalytic activities of methyl orange. Marchiori et al.28 reported that N and Nb co-doping showed greatly enhanced photocatalytic activities of TiO2 under visible light irradiation. A number of studies have shown that its conduction band position is higher than hydrogen reduction potential. However, this modified N-TiO2 is still inefficient, even inactive for the photocatalytical hydrogen production from pure water or ethanol/water solution under visible light irradiation.
Our previous studies showed that the single Sn or Ni grafts on the TiO2 surface benefits the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the enhancement of photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production.8,10,34–38 The nature of photocatalytic hydrogen production over the composites NiO/TiO2 and SnO2/TiO2 was well-interpreted at the molecular level with the atomically isolated metal-dependence obtained in terms of the surface organometallic chemistry strategy. Taking NiO/TiO2 as an example, the predominant Ni2+ species in NiO/TiO2 is present in the form of surface Ti–O–Ni molecular linkages, which contribute to the visible light photocatalysis by the metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) of NiII–O–TiIV → NiIII–O–TiIII. Further study showed that the hydrogen evolution can be further improved by chemically constructing the [–O–Ti–O–Sn–O–Ni–O–Ti–] heteroatomic clusters to accelerate the delocalization and dissociation of excitons generated in the Ni moieties.10 The single-atomic Ni species can function as the visible light harvester and the hydrogen-releasing site. These findings inspired us to enhance the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by creating the molecular p–n heterojunctions at the cross-interface between p-type metal oxides and n-type N-TiO2.
In the present study, we attempted to improve the visible-light hydrogen production over N-TiO2 by controlling the NiO loading. A series of visible-responsive NiO/N-TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized by the wet impregnation method, followed by post-nitridation.26 In the case of a low loading, the p-type metal-oxide semiconductor was dispersed on the surface of the host substrate as nanoclusters and single atoms. NiO was used on the basis of the abovementioned facts: (1) it can generate greater amounts of hydrogen-releasing active sites; (2) it gets highly dispersed to form nanoscale p–n junctions at the interface of N-TiO2/NiO by a desired preparation procedure; (3) Ni2+ has an unfilled d orbital and enables the enhancement of visible light absorption by the MMCT.2 All the as-prepared samples were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 physical adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DRS), and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The photoelectrochemical characterizations including Mott–Schottky and photocurrent were used to study the formation of molecular p–n Ni–O–Ti heterojunctions at the NiO/N-TiO2 interface and the transport and transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of these samples were studied under visible light irradiation and compared under the same conditions. The results showed that the molecular p–n heterojunctions formed at the interface of NiO/N-TiO2 enhance the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and consequently the hydrogen evolution.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Anatase TiO2 (99%, 5 nm APS powder) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Other chemicals were purchased in analytical reagent grade from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All these chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water was used for all the experiments.
2.2 Catalysts preparation
The NiO-coupled N-doped TiO2 samples were prepared via wet impregnation and post-nitridation methods (the preparation process is shown in Fig. S1, see the ESI†). First, the NiO-modified TiO2 sample (denoted as NiO/TiO2) was prepared by the wet impregnation method. Typically, 1.0 g anatase TiO2 samples were first impregnated with Ni(CH3COO)2 solutions (10 mg Ni ml−1), followed by ultrasonic treatment for 5 min. Thereafter, the slurry was dried at 393 K for 7 h and the resulting catalysts were obtained by calcination at 500 °C for 8 h in flowing O2. A group of samples denoted as x wt% NiO/TiO2 with different NiO contents, where x wt% represents the percentage content of NiO (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0), were prepared by adding the desired amount of Ni(CH3COO)2 solutions. Finally, the as-prepared x wt% NiO/TiO2 samples were nitrified in pure NH3 gas at 400 °C for 20 h to obtain the N-doped NiO/TiO2 samples (designated as x wt% NiO/N-TiO2). The contents of N and Ni in all the samples were determined via the atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) and ICP, respectively, and the results are listed in Table S1.†
2.3 Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed via a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and element mapping images were obtained by a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The N2 absorption–desorption isotherms were determined at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 500 Scan UV-vis-NIR spectrometer with BaSO4 as the reference sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using a VG ESCALAB 250 XPS System with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (15 kV 200 W, pass energy = 20 eV). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of surface adventitious carbon. The electron spin resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was carried out via a Bruker A-300-EPR X-band spectrometer. Photocurrent was measured using the conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell with a working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The working electrode was immersed in a sodium sulfate electrolyte solution (0.2 M) and irradiated by a visible light. The light/dark short circuit photocurrent response was obtained using a BAS Epsilon workstation. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment and Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis were carried out via a Potentiostat (ZAHNER) using a three-electrode system in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. Photoluminescence emission spectra and photoluminescence lifetimes were measured at room temperature via an FL/FS920 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments).
2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurements
The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was performed using a closed gas-recirculation system equipped with a top-irradiation Pyrex reaction vessel. First, 0.2 g of the photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL of water containing 1.0 g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) as a sacrificial agent under magnetic stirring in a Pyrex reaction vessel. The abovementioned suspension was evacuated for 30 min to remove air prior to irradiation using a 300 W xenon lamp with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). The evolved hydrogen gas was circulated using a gas pump and quantified by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-8A, TCD, Ar carrier).
2.5 Calculation model and methods
According to the literature39 and our experimental results (the existence of N–Ti–O and Ni–O–Ti linkages), a 2 × 2 × 1 (containing 16 Ti atoms and 32 O atoms) anatase supercell was adopted in this study, for which crystal parameters were a = 3.496 Å, b = 8.496 Å, and c = 13.6503 Å. The N-doped structure, formed as a N–Ti–O linkage, was modeled by substituting one N atom for one O atom at −1.888, −1.888, and 2.757 positions (2.1 at%). Then, the Ni–O–Ti linkage was modeled by fixing the N–Ti–O structure to fabricate the –Ni–O–Ti–N– linkages and thus synergistically enhance the transport and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. All the calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The exchange–correlation functional of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and the projector augmented-wave methods (PAW) were used. A Monkhorst–Pack grid of (5 × 5 × 1) k-points was used for the structure optimization and 9 × 9 × 1 for the electronic structure calculation. The cut-off energy of the plane-wave basis sets was 500 eV and the positions of all the active atoms were allowed to relax until the force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV Å−2. The criterion of the electronic structure convergence was set at 10−5 eV. To obtain the accurate band alignment of the interface, a screened hybrid functional (HSE06) was used for the electronic structure calculations.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterizations and optical properties of the NiO/N-TiO2 samples
Prior to determining the structure and optical properties of N atoms doped and Ni species modified in TiO2, all the as-prepared samples were evaluated by XRD, TEM, N2 adsorption, and UV-vis DRS spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 before and after N doping and/or NiO loading. The host TiO2 presents a typical crystalline structure of the anatase phase.2 After loading Ni species on TiO2 (even if Ni content increased up to 5.0 wt%), the diffraction peaks related to NiO are indiscernible due to the low crystalline or high dispersion of Ni species.2,26 Additionally, when N species were doped into TiO2 and NiO/TiO2, no noticeable changes were observed in the XRD peaks for the samples. These results indicate that both N-doping and NiO loading did not alter the crystalline structure of the TiO2 nanoparticles.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of parent TiO2 before and after annealing at 723 K, N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/TiO2, and x% NiO/N-TiO2 with different Ni contents. 
These results can be further confirmed by TEM, as displayed in Fig. 2. The low-resolution TEM images represent the typical morphologies of the 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 and 3.0% NiO/N-TiO2 nanoparticles. The HRTEM images (Fig. 2A-b and B-b) show one lattice fringe with an interplanar space corresponding to the d-spacing of approximately 0.35 nm, which is attributed to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The lattice fringes belonging to the NiO nanoparticles or nanoclusters may not be observed due to the very low concentration and high dispersion of Ni species. However, the EDX pattern (Fig. 2A-c) and elemental mapping (Fig. 2A-c) demonstrate the weak fluorescent signals of Ni and N in the entire TEM images, verifying the high dispersion of Ni species at the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles by wet impregnation and the uniform doping of N into TiO2 by post-nitridation. Moreover, it can be clearly seen from the elemental mapping image (Fig. 2A-c) that for the 3.0% NiO/N-TiO2 sample, some nanoscale particles with a diameter of around 5–10 nm are well-dispersed on the TiO2 surface, whereas a majority of Ni species in the 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 sample is atomically isolated. The results show that in the case of low NiO loading, the Ni species are highly dispersed on the surface of the TiO2 as single atoms and nanoclusters.

N2 adsorption–desorption at 77 K was used to study the microstructural changes of TiO2 before and after modification via N doping and NiO loading. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves are presented in Fig. S2.† The corresponding BET surface area, pore volume, and pore size of all the samples are summarized in Table S1.† Characteristic IUPAC type IV-isotherms patterns with clear H2 hysteresis loops at high relative pressures (P/P0 > 0.5) were observed for all the as-prepared samples (Fig. S2A†), indicating the formation of mesopores in the catalysts. Due to the agglomeration and structure collapses after calcinations at high temperature, N doping enlarges the aperture size (as shown in Fig. S2B†) and decreases the BET surface area (see Table S1†). In the case of low NiO loading, the microstructure of host TiO2 was not obviously altered because of the high dispersion of Ni species as nanoclusters and single atoms, as clearly shown by the similar BET surface area between 0.5% NiO/TiO2 (160.4 m2 g−1) and parent TiO2 (159.0 m2 g−1). After post-nitridation at a high temperature, the BET surface areas were greatly decreased to 111.4 m2 g−1, 107.8 m2 g−1, 105.9 m2 g−1, and 106.6 m2 g−1 for N-TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.35% NiO/N-TiO2, and 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, respectively, which are independent of NiO loading (as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1†). Evidently, the surface of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles can be re-constructed and re-crystallized by N species.
The effect of NiO modification and N doping on the optical properties of TiO2 was studied via UV-vis DRS spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3A. The parent TiO2 represents a sharp absorption edge at around 380 nm. Post-nitridation resulted in a broad absorption shoulder peak centered at 450 nm, whereas NiO loading led to a tail absorption in the visible light region (400–600 nm). After co-modifying host TiO2 with Ni and N species, the spectra of x% NiO/N-TiO2 samples show significantly enhanced absorption in the visible-light region (400–800 nm) and the absorption intensity gradually increases with the increasing Ni contents. To more clearly demonstrate the enhanced optical properties, we plotted the difference spectra between bare TiO2 and N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/TiO2, and x% NiO/N-TiO2 with different Ni contents, as displayed in Fig. 3B. The 0.5% NiO/TiO2 sample shows a main absorption at 386 nm attributed to the MMCT of Ni–O–Ti heteroatomic linkage.40 Moreover, a weak shoulder peak around 440 nm can be seen, which belongs to the concomitant oxygen vacancies (Vo). It can, therefore, be deduced that the Ni species are located at positions accessible to the surface Vo sites of the host TiO2 nanoparticles. There is a main absorption peak centered at 414 nm in N-TiO2, which is assigned to the N–Ti–Vo surface species.21,41–43 The chief absorption peak of 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.35% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, and 1.0% NiO/N-TiO2 slightly shifted to ca. 400 nm with a weak and broad tail in the region of 480–700 nm originating from NiO nanoclusters and single atoms, which significantly enhanced with the increasing Ni content. The red shift may be because the N species is active and effective for the electronic structure of Ni–O–Ti heteroatomic clusters on the surface of TiO2, which was further confirmed via XPS.

3.2 Chemical states of NiO and N dopants
The chemical states of NiO and N dopants in these samples were characterized by XPS. The Ti 2p, O 1s, N 1s, and Ni 2p XPS spectra are displayed in Fig. 4 and 5. The obtained peak positions (eV) for these samples are summarized and listed in Table S2.† The Ni 2p XPS spectra of all the Ni-modified samples display two peaks at 855.7 and 873.2 eV ascribed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core levels of Ni species, respectively, indicating that Ni species in these samples are present in the +2 oxidation state (Fig. 4A). The peaks at around 458.6 eV and 464.3 eV for the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 core levels, respectively, are assigned to Ti4+ in TiO2 (Fig. 4B). The O 1s peak in the high-resolution XPS spectra of all the samples (Fig. 4C) can be fitted into two peaks centered at around 529.9 and 531.9 eV, ascribed to the adsorbed oxygen species and lattice oxygen of TiO2, respectively.
 Fig. 4  The high resolution core XPS spectrum of Ni 2p (A), Ti 2p (B), and O 1s (C) of TiO2, N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/TiO2, and x% NiO/N-TiO2 with different Ni contents. 
Note that the binding energy of Ni in both the NiO/TiO2 and NiO/N-TiO2 samples is higher than that of Ni in bare NiO (see Table S2 and Fig. S3†) and the binding energy of Ni in x% NiO/N-TiO2 slightly shifted towards the higher range along with the increased Ni contents (Fig. 4A). Moreover, NiO modification causes the increase in the electron density of Ti4+ cations, as implied by the synchronous decrease of Ti 2p and O 1s peak of lattice oxygen for NiO/TiO2 and NiO/N-TiO2 compared to that for bare TiO2 (Fig. 4B and C). This is closely related to the formation of electronic structure of Ni–O–Ti heteroatomic clusters by creating the molecular p–n heterojunctions at the cross-interface between NiO and host N-TiO2, which can lead to remarkable electron donation for Ti4+. For NiO/N-TiO2 photocatalysts, the binding energy of lattice oxygen and Ti 2p obviously shifts towards low binding energy, suggesting that N atoms are substitutionally incorporated into the TiO2 lattice.
The N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 5A) of N-TiO2 exhibits a N 1s core level peak at ca. 400 eV, between 397.2 eV (TiN) and 402.7 eV (NO),44 suggesting that the N species should be N–Ti–Vo, which is consistent with our reported work.45 Note that the existence of NiO leads to a shift in the binding energy of N 1s towards high energy when the NiO content is lower than 1.0%, and further increase in the NiO content causes decrease in the binding energy of N 1s for N–Ti–Vo species and the formation of a new weak N 1s peak at around 401.9 eV related to NO species. This is because of the interaction between NiO and N species, which can be confirmed by the following facts: (1) N doping leads to a shift in the binding energy of Ni 2p towards high energy; (2) binding energy of Ti 2p for 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 is lower than that for N-TiO2 (almost the same as that for 0.5% NiO/TiO2), and the O 1s peak of lattice oxygen for 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 is lower than that for both N-TiO2 and 0.5% NiO/TiO2; (3) as NiO content increases, the binding energy of the Ti 2p and O 1s peak of lattice oxygen for x% NiO/N-TiO2 samples gradually decreases, reaches a low value at 0.5 wt%, and then bounces back. Thus, 0.5% NiO/TiO2 with the highest electron density on Ti4+ and Vo can enhance the transport and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This shows that N–Ti–Vo actively and synergistically affects the photocatalytic reaction with the mononuclear Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters.

3.3 XAFS spectroscopy
The geometry and bonding of Ni species were characterized by XAFS spectroscopy. Fig. 6A represents the normalized Ni K-edge XAFS spectra of 0.5% NiO/TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, 2.0% NiO/N-TiO2, and NiO nanoparticles. The NiO particles were used as references to evaluate the relative changes between the samples with NiOx species. The Ni K-edge positions of 0.5% NiO/TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, and 2.0% NiO/N-TiO2 are in line with the reference NiO, suggesting that the local structure around the Ni atoms in the samples is similar to the NiO6 octahedral structure of NiO. Nickel loaded on TiO2 is present in the +2 oxidation state. This is in parallel with the aforementioned XPS results. The Ni K-edge XANES spectra of 0.5% NiO/TiO2 and 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 samples appear to be completely uniform, proving that the doping of nitrogen does not affect the electronic structure of NiOx species. It can, therefore, be expected that the NiO/N-TiO2 photocatalysts possess the same nickel species as their parent NiO/TiO2 without nitridation. Note that no obvious pre-edge peaks attributed to the 1s → 3d transition could be seen, suggesting that the NiO6 local structure in all the samples is not distorted much from the regular octahedron as in the case of NiO. However, we found an oscillation peak at 8365 eV, belonging to the step edge value (E0), which increases the intensity and shifts to a high-energy position with an increase in the nickel concentration.
 Fig. 6  (A) Normalized Ni K-edge XANES spectra; (B) experimental k2-weighted scattering functions; and (C) Fourier transformations of k2-weighted EXAFS spectra. 
The k2-weighted scattering functions of NiO, 0.5% NiO/TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, and 2.0% NiO/N-TiO2 are displayed in Fig. 6B. Herein, two relatively sharp features centered at 5.55 and 7.56 Å−1 in k-space for NiO were assigned to the Ni–Ni scattering, whereas the peaks of other samples corresponding to the Ni–Ni bond could hardly be seen at around 5.55 Å−1, indicating that nickel is in the form of NiO nanoclusters in the samples. The Ni K-edge position of 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 is consistent with that of 0.5% NiO/TiO2 and no visible differences in the position or intensity of the main peaks can be observed, confirming the conclusion that N-doping does not impact on the geometric structure of NiO coupled on TiO2.
In addition, we further verified the conclusions by the Fourier transforms k2-weighted EXAFS of the abovementioned samples, as shown in Fig. 6C. For the NiO sample, two back-scattering features attributable to the presence of the Ni–O and Ni–Ni back-scattering were observed at 1.72 and 2.65 Å, respectively. For 0.5% NiO/TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, and 2.0% NiO/N-TiO2, the intensity of the Ni–O back-scattering peak in the first coordination shell is strongest. However, the intensity of the second peak due to the Ni–Ni back-scattering is significantly lower than that of the NiO, and a weak back-scattering at about 3.35 Å could be seen. This indicates the huge difference in the local structure of Ni species between NiO/TiO2 samples and the reference NiO; this is conclusive evidence that the Ni2+ species are loaded at the surface Vo sites of anatase TiO2.
The Fourier-filtered EXAFS data for NiO, 0.5% NiO/TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, and 2.0% NiO/N-TiO2 were fitted using the model of a single Ni absorber coordinated to several shells of O and Ni atoms, and the curve-fitting results are listed in Table 1. For cubic NiO, each Ni atom is coordinated to six O atoms and three Ni atoms. The neighboring oxygen atom (Ni–O) and nickel atom (Ni–Ni) bond distances for NiO were observed at 2.08 and 2.95 Å, respectively. For all the samples with NiO-modified TiO2, the Ni–Ni coordination number (CN) is far less (∼4 times) than that of reference NiO, further demonstrating that our photocatalysts contain part of the oligo-nuclear NiO clusters, besides the Ni single atoms. Simultaneously, the Ni–O distance is shorter than that of NiO, implying that Ni has bound to the lattice oxygen of TiO2. The CN of both the Ni–Ni and Ni–O (–Ni/–Ti) shells for 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 are less than that of 0.5% NiO/TiO2, which reveals that N–Ti–Vo species is conducive for this cooperation with the Ni sites. In addition, the fit analysis of the Fourier-filtered EXAFS showed that both the Ni–Ni and Ni–O (–Ni/–Ti) shells of NiO/N-TiO2 increased with an increase in the Ni content. Note that the Ni–O distance of 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 (2.02 Å) is the shortest in the 0.5% NiO/TiO2, 0.25% NiO/N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2, and 2.0% NiO/N-TiO2 samples, suggesting the Ni binding of 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 is most robust with the lattice oxygen of TiO2. Together with the abovementioned characterization results, it can be inferred that the high dispersion of Ni2+ species mainly forms mononuclear Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters at the surface Vo sites in the case of low Ni content, which are expected to accelerate photocatalytic reaction as hydrogen-releasing active sites.

3.4 EPR analysis
The EPR spectra of the parent TiO2, N-TiO2, 0.5% NiO/TiO2, and 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 samples before and after visible light irradiation were measured at 77 K, as shown in Fig. 7. Several sets of EPR spectral lines of pure TiO2 sample are located at the g values of 2.017, 2.006, 2.002, 2.000, and 1.980, ascribing to surface oxygen radicals and defects such as Vo and Ti3+ under dark conditions. According to the literature,2,26 a set of g-values at g1 = 2.017, g2 = 2.006, and g3 = 2.004 is ascribed to surface O2− anions, and the strongest and broadest line centered at g = 2.002 arising from Vo and the weakest line appearing at g = 1.980 belongs to surface Ti3+.46 No changes were observed after irradiating the samples with visible light, suggesting that pure TiO2 cannot be excited by visible light (Fig. 7A). For NiO/TiO2 samples prepared by heating Ni(CH3COOH)/TiO2 at 723 K in flowing O2, the EPR lines are lower as compared to those of parent TiO2, indicating the decreased defects on TiO2 (Fig. 7B). Note that the line occurs at the g value around 2.002 and increases upon visible light irradiation, suggesting the NiO/TiO2 can be excited with visible light (confirmed by the UV-vis DRS), and it induces the formation of trapped electrons.47 As shown in Fig. 7C and D, the EPR spectra of N-TiO2 and NiO/N-TiO2 appear as a set of signals with the orthorhombic spectral lines at gx = 2.007, gy = 2.004, and gz = 2.003 under dark conditions, which originate from the N species.19 After visible light irradiation, the N-doped samples show a set of EPR lines at g1 = 2.023, g2 = 2.006, and g3 = 2.002, ascribing to the characteristic of surface-hole-trapped sites of titania (Ti4+O˙−Ti4+ OH−) and two lines appearing at g = 1.991 and g = 1.986 belong to bulk and surface Ti3+. It is interesting to note that the intensity of these EPR lines for NiO/N-TiO2 under visible light irradiation is lower than that for N-TiO2, probably owing to electrons being donated from Ni2+ to N-TiO2. These results illustrate that the photogenerated electrons transfer between NiO and N-TiO2 under irradiation of visible light, providing sufficiently strong evidence to the formation of molecular p–n heterojunctions at the interface of NiO/N-TiO2 by a desired preparation procedure.

3.5 Photocatalytic activity for H2 production under visible light irradiation
The photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of the p–n type NiO/N-TiO2 nanocomposite were evaluated under visible light irradiation and compared under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 8. The parent TiO2 only works under UV light and therefore shows no curve of the visible-light H2 evolution. Both the N-TiO2 and 0.5% NiO/TiO2 catalysts have visible light response and present low visible light photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution (0.19 μmol h−1 g−1 and 0.59 μmol h−1 g−1 for N-TiO2 and 0.5% NiO/TiO2, respectively, see Fig. 8B), which is consistent with the reported works.2,11,48,49 After loading NiO cocatalyst on N-TiO2, H2 evolution rate for the samples (16.5 μmol h−1 g−1 for 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2) dramatically increased (90-fold and 20-fold enhancement) as compared to those of N-TiO2 and 0.5% NiO/TiO2, respectively. This suggests that the mononuclear Ti–O–Ni heterojunctions can speed up the transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers of N-TiO2, which serve as the main contributor to synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity. The N–Ti–Vo species are active and effective for this cooperation with the hydrogen-releasing Ni sites due to the high dispersion of Ni2+ species at the surface Vo sites. Note that the H2 evolution rate rapidly increases with the increasing Ni content and reaches a maximum value at 0.5 wt%, followed by a considerable decrease. The decreasing trend is mainly due to agglomeration of the NiO clusters, as evidenced by BET and TEM results.

3.6 Photoelectrochemical properties of NiO/N-TiO2
To further verify the formation of p–n heterojunctions at the NiO/N-TiO2 interface and investigate the electron transfer promoted by the junctions in the NiO/N-TiO2 photocatalysts, we measured photoelectrochemical characterizations such as Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots and photocurrent for N-TiO2, NiO/TiO2, and NiO/N-TiO2 samples. Fig. 9A displays the M–S plots of TiO2, N-TiO2, 3.0% NiO/TiO2, and NiO/N-TiO2 with different Ni contents. The inverted V-shaped plot for all the NiO-modified samples (NiO/TiO2 and NiO/N-TiO2) can be clearly observed, which represents the existence of a p–n junction. The turning point of inverted V-shaped profile shifts to lower potential with the increasing Ni content, implying that mobile electrons and holes transfer to N-TiO2 and NiO, respectively. NiO/N-TiO2 shows a lower potential as compared to NiO/TiO2, indicating that the N doping could improve the charge transfer.
 Fig. 9  (A) The Mott–Schottky plots of the samples and (B) the periodic on/off photocurrent response of the NiO/N-TiO2 samples under visible light irradiation. 
The periodic on/off photocurrent response of all the samples under visible light irradiation, which is described in Fig. 9B, validates the MMCT occurring in the Ni–O–Ti linkages. The p–n heterojunctions are the main contributor to enhancing the photocurrent and inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which can be proven by the fact that photocurrent response of NiO/N-TiO2 is much larger than that of N-TiO2.37 Note that the change trends of the photocurrent intensity of NiO/N-TiO2 samples are parallel with the abovementioned photocatalytic activity results. Herein, the remarkable decrease trend is also mainly due to agglomeration of the NiO cluster, as evidenced by the BET and TEM results. The NiO cluster was agglomerated into 5–10 nm particles when Ni content was 3.0%, as shown in Fig. 2B-d. This causes the decrease of the contact area between NiO and TiO2 and thus reduces the function of p–n heterojunctions, while the p–n heterojunctions are the main contributor to enhancing the photocurrent and inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Therefore, the photocurrent starts to remarkably decrease for the NiO cluster-decorated N-TiO2 when Ni content is over 0.5%.
Subsequently, the process of charge trapping, carrying, and transfer at the solid surface was studied by fluorescence spectrometry to obtain further insights into the synergetic mechanism at the molecular level. Fig. S4A and B† provide the PL spectra and relative lifetime of the 380 nm emission wavelength, respectively. All samples displayed a significant peak at 450–500 nm, probably caused by deep defect levels or/and surface defects of the catalysts. Compared with the 0.5% NiO/TiO2 sample, 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 shows a synchronous decrease in the intensity and lifetime. Based on literature,19,50 the reasons for the decrease of the PL quenching process after nitridation are as follows: (i) the electrons are trapped by Vo, and the holes are trapped by the doped-N atoms and (ii) the excited electrons transfer from the valence band (VB) to the new levels that exist above the conduction band (CB) introduced by N-doping. Moreover, a slight blue shift of 0.5 wt% NiO/N-TiO2 can be observed in the emission maxima (from 502 nm to 488 nm), indicating that nitrogen influenced the structure of the photocatalysts.51 This result proves the existence of N1 and N2 species as abovementioned XPS results. However, when the NiO content was increased to 3.0 wt%, the peak red shifted, induced by N2 species. The decreasing trend of PL lifetime (τ) follows the order 0.5% NiO/TiO2 (0.7226 ns) > 0.5% NiO/N-TiO2 (0.6999 ns) > 3.0% NiO/N-TiO2 (0.6765 ns) > N-TiO2 (0.5446 ns), revealing the stabilization of the excited state *TiO2 after NiO modification. These results suggest that Ni species play several important roles: (1) they can generate greater amounts of hydrogen-releasing active sites such as excited *TiO2 and (2) they form the p–n junctions at the interface N-TiO2/NiO.
3.7 Theoretical calculations
We also examined the electronic structure of N-TiO2, NiO/TiO2, and NiO/N-TiO2 photocatalysts via density functional theory (DFT) methods, as shown in Fig. 10. The DOS in Fig. 10A suggest that TiO2 is a semiconductor. The electrons migrate into the valence band (VB) of NiO and conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The energy between the Fermi level and VB of anatase is far higher than that between CB and Fermi level, and it is much easier for holes in TiO2 to inject into NiO than electrons.27 Similarly, electrons in NiO transfer into the VB of TiO2 due to the higher energy. In this case, electrons in anatase VB are excited and jump into CB under visible light irradiation, and the overall effect causes holes transfer into NiO, which can be seen in Scheme 1. Fig. 10B was obtained from the band structure shown in Fig. S5.† The calculated band gap of pure anatase (1.92 eV) is much smaller than the experimental value (3.2 eV), due to the limitation of DFT.39,52 It can be observed that the band gap energy decreases in the order NiO/N-TiO2, NiO/TiO2, N-TiO2, and TiO2. Through the wet impregnation and post-nitridation reaction and crystallization, both NiO co-catalyst and N dopants are exposed on the surface of TiO2. Moreover, the local structure of the formed NiO/N-TiO2 can possibly be depicted as shown Fig. 11, in which the linker of N–Ti–Vo and Ni–Ti–O is the shared O atom or O vacancy. Under the visible light absorption, the N–Ti–Vo species is able to cooperate with the hydrogen-releasing Ni sites arising from Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters, which can synergistically speed up the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.

3.8 Nature of visible-light photocatalysis of NiO/N-TiO2 for hydrogen evolution
It is reported that NiO is a p-type semiconductor.53 According to the literature, the results of elemental mapping,54 XPS,8 and Mott–Schottky plots2,10 help to confirm the existence of the p–n junction. In our experiment, the TEM, XPS, EPR, Mott–Schottky, photocurrent results, and DFT calculations indicated that the molecular Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters are formed at the interface between the p-type semiconductor NiO and n-type semiconductor N-TiO2 (Scheme 1). The elemental distribution of Ti, Ni, N, and O (Fig. 2A-d) indicates that in the case of low NiO loading, the Ni species are highly dispersed and well attached on the surface of TiO2 as single atoms and nanoclusters. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S2,† the Ni 2p peaks shifted towards the higher bonding energy (NiO vs. NiO/TiO2), whereas the Ti 2p peaks shifted towards the lower bonding energy (TiO2vs. NiO/TiO2). It was implied that Ni–O–Ti bonds are present at the interface between NiO and TiO2. In Fig. 9A, the inverted V-shaped plot for all the NiO-modified samples (NiO/TiO2 and NiO/N-TiO2) can be clearly observed, which represent the existence of a p–n junction.
It is reported that the Ni–O–Ti heteroatomic linkages can act as visible light chromophores.2,37 Once excited by visible light, for NiO/N-TiO2, electron–hole pairs are created. Surface p–n heterojunctions create an inner electric field at the interface, which allow for the transfer of holes to the negative side and transfer of electrons to the positive side. This promotes the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers and serves as the main contributor to H2 evolution.55 Upon irradiation of TiO2 with visible light, the MMCT of Ti–O–Ni linkages produces energetic electrons, in the presence of which H+ in water can be reduced to H2. In this case, the electrons can be excited from both the N 2p state of N dopant and the Ni 3d state of the loaded NiO co-catalyst to the conduction band of TiO2. The inner electric field can also speed up the transfer of photogenerated holes from the sacrificial electron donor EDTA, which is oxidized by the excited Ni sites. Actually, the reasons for the visible light response of NiO-modified N-TiO2 photocatalyst are concluded as two aspects according to the aforementioned facts: (1) N doping leads to the formation of N 2p impurity level in the TiO2 band gap, cooperating with the hydrogen-releasing Ni sites and causing the visible light absorption of TiO2 and (2) mononuclear Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters cause the excitement of electrons on the surface of the unfilled Ni 3d orbital to the TiO2 conduction band, consequently generating greater amounts of hydrogen-releasing active sites and enhancing the visible light absorption by the MMCT.
4 Conclusions
Molecular p–n heterojunctions on the surface of N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst were designed through the wet impregnation method and the subsequent post-nitridation, which significantly enhances the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Compared to N-TiO2 and NiO/TiO2, a 90-fold and 20-fold-enhanced H2 evolution rate was achieved, respectively, over the optimal NiO/N-TiO2 catalyst with a 0.5 wt% Ni content. The combined characterization results reveal that molecular Ti–O–Ni heteroatomic clusters formed at the NiO/N-TiO2 interface enable and promote the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. This type of molecular Ti–O–Ni heterojunctions can effectively contribute to the H2 evolution by MMCT. One of the N species, the N–Ti–Vo species, efficiently cooperates with the hydrogen-releasing Ni sites and synergistically enhances H2 production. This present study provides a detailed insight into the synergistic effect of molecular p–n heterojunctions and N-doped TiO2 photocatalysts and serves as a design for other heterostructural photocatalysts for enhancing their visible-light hydrogen evolution.
