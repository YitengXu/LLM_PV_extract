When exposed to CH3NH3I vapours, the colourless lead salts turned yellow before the formation of the black perovskite. Investigation of this yellow intermediate suggests that anion exchange (converting lead salts to PbI2) precedes the perovskite formation. PCEs of 7.6% and 8.4% were achieved for the devices formed from Pb(SCN)2 and Pb(NO3)2, respectively.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have gained significant attention over the last few years due to their promising photovoltaic performance.1 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 20% have already been reported with single junction perovskite solar cells and it is expected that perovskites with a tandem geometry can achieve efficiencies reaching 30%.2 Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite has been the frontrunner in these high efficiency solar cells.3 This perovskite is not difficult to access and can be formed by mixing lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI). Perovskites made from a mixture of lead chloride (PbCl2) and MAI have also shown rather high efficiencies.4 Contrary to the initial reports of mixed halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), recent reports suggest that the perovskite formed from PbCl2 is chloride free (CH3NH3PbI3).5
There are recent reports dedicated to understanding this process.6 A yellow intermediate phase can be observed during the formation of the perovskite through which chloride ions are replaced by iodide ions. When such an exchange of anions takes place, the question arises as to whether other lead salts also can form the same perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3). A recent report showed that even lead salts such as lead acetate tend to form the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.7 However, the mechanism through which these non-halide salts form CH3NH3PbI3 still remains unclear. In order to understand the formation of the perovskite, we treated three different non-iodide lead salts (halide salt: PbCl2, pseudo-halide salt: Pb(SCN)2 and non-halide salt: Pb(NO3)2) with methylammonium iodide vapours. Perovskite formation was attempted through a sequential vapour-assisted solution process.8 Through this method, the perovskites were formed slowly in about two to five hours. This slow formation allowed us to monitor the progress of the perovskite formation. Unlike with PbCl2, the perovskites formed from Pb(NO3)2 and Pb(SCN)2 clearly passed through a yellow PbI2 stage before the formation of CH3NH3PbI3.
The perovskite films were formed by spin coating the lead salt from a DMF solution onto a TiO2 coated FTO substrate (solution method). PbCl2 is insoluble in DMF and therefore it was vapour deposited over TiO2.9 The colourless lead salt films were then exposed to MAI vapour at around 180 °C for 5 hours in a closed graphite vessel in a nitrogen filled glove box to form a complete perovskite film. When exposed for a shorter duration or at a lower temperature, a yellow intermediate state was obtained, which on further exposure to the MAI vapour transformed to a black perovskite film (Fig. 1). In order to understand the perovskite formation, thin film XRD was performed on the lead film, yellow intermediate and black perovskite film for all three precursors. Experimental details are given in the ESI.†

Fig. 2(A) shows the XRD patterns of the different lead salts deposited over the TiO2 coated FTO substrate. It is worth highlighting that lead iodide (PbI2) showed an intense (011) peak at the 2θ value of 12.7°, whereas the other lead salts (PbCl2, Pb(SCN)2 and Pb(NO3)2) do not show any peak in that region.1dFig. 2(C) shows the XRD patterns of the black perovskite films. The XRD peaks for the perovskites formed from PbI2 and PbCl2 match perfectly with each other, which is in line with recent reports.10 Interestingly, even the peaks of the perovskites formed from Pb(SCN)2 and Pb(NO3)2 match with the peaks of CH3NH3PbI3. This suggests that irrespective of the lead salt used, the same perovskite is formed in the vapour-assisted sequential deposition process. Fig. 2(B) shows the XRD patterns of the yellow intermediates, where for lead thiocyanate and lead nitrate, along with the original lead salt peaks, a new peak appeared at the 2θ value of 12.7°. This peak matches with the XRD peak of PbI2, suggesting that the SCN− and NO3− ions were exchanged with I− (from MAI) resulting in the conversion of the lead salt (Pb(SCN)2 or Pb(NO3)2) to PbI2. Formation of a yellow intermediate phase during the solution processed perovskite formation from PbCl2 has already been reported and attributed to the yellow phase of the perovskite.11 However, the yellow intermediate observed in the case of Pb(SCN)2 and Pb(NO3)2 does not correspond to the yellow intermediate perovskite phase, rather it corresponds to PbI2. The thiocyanate ion, a pseudohalide, is a polyatomic analogue of halides and it resembles the properties of halogens. The resemblance of their chemical properties allows them to act as a substitute for halogens in several chemical compounds. When lead thiocyanate was exposed to MAI vapours, we did not observe the formation of a perovskite containing thiocyanate. Rather, it undergoes anion exchange forming PbI2 and subsequently CH3NH3PbI3.

Even the yellow intermediate from PbCl2 showed a small peak at the 2θ value of 12.7° (which matches with the PbI2 peak), however peaks were also observed at 21.45°, 24.10° and 29.0°, which do not match with any of the peaks for PbI2, PbCl2, CH3NH3PbI3, TiO2 or FTO. Although for the lead thiocyanate and lead nitrate experiments exchange of anions in the lead salt stage is clearly observed, lead chloride exchange in the lead salt stage is unclear and requires further investigation. For these yellow intermediate thin films, a small peak at the 2θ value of 14.1° was also observed. This peak corresponds to (110) CH3NH3PbI3, which can be attributed to the partial formation of the perovskite by the interaction of PbI2 and MAI.
The elemental compositions of the different lead precursor perovskite films were carried out using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in SEM mode. From Fig. 3 it can be observed that the EDS spectra for the perovskites from all three lead precursors match with each other. For the perovskites formed from the different lead salts, especially lead nitrate and lead thiocyanate, the EDS analyses correspond to lead and iodine signals in an atomic ratio close to 1:3 (Table S1, ESI†). Detailed EDS data is provided in the ESI.† Similar to recent literature reports, we could not detect any signal corresponding to chlorine in the perovskite formed from PbCl2.10 Similarly, no EDS signal for sulphur was observed in the perovskite formed from Pb(SCN)2. All these results suggest that the same perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) was formed in the vapour-assisted sequential deposition method. EDS analyses were also performed on the yellow intermediate state and the black perovskite formed from the exposure of PbCl2 to MAI vapours. EDS analysis of the yellow intermediate state showed the presence of iodine before the formation of the perovskite (Table S2, ESI†), but the stage at which the anions exchanged still remains unclear and needs further investigation.

It is important to note that, in this study, during the formation of the perovskite, the substrate was heated up to a high temperature (>100 °C). This high temperature will favour the diffusion of ions, leading to an exchange of anions. Such an exchange was also observed in the solution state, where the lead salts (PbCl2 or Pb(NO3)2 or Pb(SCN)2) when treated with a colourless aqueous solution of methylammonium iodide resulted in the immediate formation of a golden yellow precipitate of PbI2 (Fig. S3, ESI†). This double displacement reaction is analogous to the well-known reaction of lead salts with KI to form PbI2 (Scheme 1).12 Thus, irrespective of the lead salt used, because of anion exchange we end up with the same CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.

The perovskites formed from all these lead precursors were used to fabricate solar cells with FTO/TiO2/perovskite/P3HT/Au architectures (Fig. S4, ESI†). Undoped P3HT was used as a hole transporting layer as it can also help to passivate the defects formed on the surface of the perovskite.13
The experimental details are described in the ESI.†Fig. 4 depicts the illuminated JV characteristics and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) for the perovskite films formed from the different lead precursors. As reported in Table 1, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells formed from the different lead precursors showed comparable photovoltaic behaviours. The high fill factor in PbCl2 can be attributed to the fabrication conditions, where the PbCl2 perovskite was sequentially vapour deposited, unlike the Pb(NO3)2 and Pb(SCN)2 perovskites, which were formed by a vapour-assisted solution process. The EQE onsets from all three perovskites were at similar energies, which also supports the fact that the perovskites formed from all the lead precursors are the same.

It is important to note that, in our work, the lead nitrate perovskite formed through vapour-assisted sequential deposition showed an impressive photovoltaic performance compared to the lead nitrate perovskite formed by a single solvent approach.14 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.4% and 7.6% for the perovskites formed from the lead nitrate and lead thiocyanate precursors were achieved, respectively, with a photocurrent and open circuit voltage comparable to those of the perovskite formed from PbCl2. The SEM images of the lead precursors and the perovskites are given in the ESI† (Fig. S5 and S6). Although the nitrate and thiocyanate salts of lead form perovskites through a common intermediate (PbI2), the difference in their photovoltaic properties may be due to the differences in morphology and residual ions, which might influence the defect states affecting the device outcome.15 The I–V hysteresis curves were also studied. The hysteresis curves are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). In our hysteresis curves the short circuit current does not change significantly upon hysteresis. The major change in the hysteresis is in the fill factor. The fill factor decreased by ∼10% for all the three perovskites formed from the different lead precursors. All these devices were fabricated with the procedure optimized for PbCl2. More optimization is required for Pb(SCN)2 and Pb(NO3)2 to achieve higher efficiencies and research towards that direction is currently in progress in our lab.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report the formation of perovskites from inexpensive and more soluble lead precursors (lead thiocyanate and lead nitrate). XRD and EDS analyses of these perovskites indicate the formation of the same CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Analysis of the yellow intermediate state suggests that the perovskite formation takes place through the formation of lead iodide by exchange of anions between the lead precursor and methylammonium iodide. Lead chloride also forms a yellow intermediate state, but whether the chloride precursor undergoes such an anion exchange before perovskite formation remains unclear and needs further investigation. A PCE of 8.4% was achieved for the perovskite device formed from lead nitrate, which, to our knowledge, is the highest efficiency to date. We also report the first ever successful perovskite solar cell from lead thiocyanate with a PCE of 7.6%.
