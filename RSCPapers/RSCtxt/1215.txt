, Accepted 4th July 2022First published on 5th July 2022AbstractSolar-powered energy storage using integrated photo-supercapacitor (PSC) systems is drawing significant attention as a potential solution for the current energy problems. This work intends to prepare a facile, efficient, and low-cost two-electrode configuration all-solid-state PSC having zinc oxide nanowire (ZnO NW) composites with graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a remedy for the complexity and high-cost of the present PSC devices. The specific capacitance (Cp) and energy density of the GO/ZnO NW-based PSC increased 3.2 and 1.9 (@56 mA g−1) times under UV illumination, respectively. Furthermore, the GO/ZnO NW-based PSC showed excellent stability for 5000 cycles with 100% capacitance retention and Coulombic efficiency. The superior performance and excellent stability due to the charge trap properties for the GO/ZnO NW-based PSC as compared to rGO/ZnO NW-based PSC have been confirmed using open circuit potential (VOC) and low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy under UV on/off conditions. Hence, it has been concluded that GO/ZnO NW material and the proposed device configuration in this work are very favourable for future electronic applications.
1. Introduction
Meeting the expanding energy demand and the urgent requirement for clean energy sources is driving the scientific world to search for and design alternative energy systems. In particular, the use of solar energy as a renewable energy source has become a growing concern to diminish the dependence on fossil fuels.1–5 Nowadays, several technologies for energy conversion and storage such as photovoltaic (PV) solar cells,6 photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells,7–10 Li-ion batteries,11 PEC redox-flow batteries,12 and supercapacitors (SC)13 have been developed to meet the energy demand. In particular, in the last few years, supercapacitors have attracted significant attention due to their low-cost, safe operation, fast charge–discharge cycles, high power density, and cyclic stability.14
In a supercapacitor, the main components are the electrodes, the electrolyte, and the separator. The electrode materials are crucial for the efficiency of a supercapacitor to achieve the anticipated charge storage activity. Therefore, high-capacitive, and low-cost active materials are preferred for enhanced performance with broad applicability. As active materials, metal oxides and sulphides, carbon-based materials, conducting polymers, and Mxenes, have been reported to have good performance in supercapacitor applications.15–20 Transition metal oxides such as ZnO, MnO2, Co2O3, Fe2O3, etc., are widely studied electrode materials due to their low cost, eco-friendly nature, natural abundance, and ideal capacitive behaviour. Furthermore, these materials have been proved to have the capability to form various nanostructured morphologies.
The combination of solar harvesting and storage in a single device by integrating PV into the SC applications is a relatively new research topic in the energy field.21–30 These devices have the advantages of being light-weight, small-sized, and compact when the solar cell is connected as a back electrode to the supercapacitor as a working electrode. On the other hand, semiconducting materials with simultaneous photosensitive and capacitive behaviour can achieve light-harvesting and charge storage. Consequently, using these materials gives an edge in photo-rechargeable energy storage applications as they have a simple structure with easy manufacturing techniques.31–34 The semiconductor materials for photo-supercapacitor (PSC) applications must possess high separation efficiency of photogenerated holes–electrons, long life of the excited holes, transparency, suitable bandgap, low cost, and eco-friendly nature.31 Zinc oxide (ZnO) has found a place in vast application areas owing to its exceptional properties such as a wide direct bandgap (3.37 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV), high chemical and mechanical stability, and nontoxic nature. Besides, ZnO can be synthesized with defect structures crucial in ionic and electronic transport properties.35
Recently, graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), consisting of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices, have enhanced the ZnO material's properties. The interaction of ZnO and rGO has improved UV sensing properties in UV detector applications, increasing photocurrent and inhibiting the recombination of electron–hole pairs.36 Photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants using rGO and GO–ZnO nanocomposites has been reported to be enhanced due to the increased specific surface area and pore structure after rGO and GO introduction.37,38 Additionally, rGO has been reported to increase the surface area and enhance the PEC water splitting process by diminishing the energy barrier of interfacial electrochemical reactions.39 The hybridization of ZnO with the GO resulted in a decrease of oxygen vacancies while forming a new oxygen interstitial defect (Oi) level.40 A synergy between graphene and ZnO for high separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs that result in enhanced photocurrent has been emphasized.41 In another research, introducing GO during ZnO nanoparticle synthesis could create oxygen vacancies in the lattice of ZnO crystals, while GO turned to rGO.42 In supercapacitor applications, the interaction between rGO and ZnO has improved the charge transfer performance and ion diffusion.43
Encouraged by the excellent optic and photoelectric properties of ZnO, GO, and rGO materials, nanocomposite structures composed of GO or rGO with ZnO nanowires (NWs) have been utilized as solid-state photoelectrode materials for photo-rechargeable energy storage applications. Although these composite materials have shown a good performance in solar energy-related and supercapacitor applications independently, there is a lack of research in solar harvesting and conversion in a single device. Additionally, the synthesized nanocomposite materials have been investigated regarding their defect structure, and crystallographic and optical properties, in order to emphasize the relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Thus, this study aims to achieve a simple design for an all-solid-state PSC device by depositing active material on an FTO glass substrate and assembled with a PVA-LiCl gel electrolyte/filter paper/carbon paper and another bare FTO as the counter electrode. It is noteworthy that PSC devices are a relatively new research topic in the renewable energy research area. Most of the research work relies on solar cell–supercapacitor integrated systems. It is urgently required to develop straightforward designed systems with low-cost materials economically. Consequently, we aim to design PSC devices that are promoted by sunlight for converting and storing solar energy simultaneously, having the advantages of being eco-friendly, stable, lightweight, compact, and adaptable to flexible and wearable electronics of solid-state supercapacitors.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The materials used were zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma Aldrich, 98% reagent grade), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, Sigma Aldrich, 38%), lithium chloride (LiCl, Emsure, ACS, Reagent), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Merck).
2.2. Synthesis of the photoactive hybrid electrode material
Graphene oxide (GO) was obtained by exfoliation of graphite oxide prepared from graphite powder using a previously published modified Hummers' method. Briefly, the graphite powder was first pre-oxidized and then oxidized following the procedure described in the literature.44 The suspension was dialyzed for 5 days and then sonicated for 1 h. The solid graphene oxide was obtained from the suspension by lyophilization. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared by thermal reduction of GO at 400 °C, for 30 min, in a gaseous mixture of H2 + Ar (10 vol% H2). The as-prepared GO contains 9 carbon layers, while rGO has 3 carbon layers. The SEM and TEM images of pristine GO and rGO used for the preparation of GO/ZnO NW, and rGO/ZnO NW composites have been given in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
A ZnO nanowire (ZnO NW) compound has been synthesized based on our previous work.8 GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW composite structures have been prepared using the method described elsewhere.45 Briefly, 5 mg of GO has been dispersed in 15 ml dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent and sonicated for 30 min. 50 mg of ZnO NW has been added to the dispersion and sonicated for 15 min. The reaction container has been placed in an oil bath under continuous stirring for 1 h at 100 °C for self-assembly decoration. Finally, ZnO decorated GO was collected via centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and then dried under vacuum at 90 °C for 2 h. The same procedure has been applied for rGO/ZnO NW composite structure preparation.
2.3. Characterization
Morphology and structural properties of the ZnO nanostructures were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL ARM 200F) using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (200 kV) with an EDX analyzer. The photoluminescence of ZnO NW was generated by a HeCd laser (325 nm) and the emission spectra were recorded in the range 350–1100 nm on an Ocean Optics Spectrometer QE65. A UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 650S) was used to collect transmission (T) and reflectance (R) data using the bare FTO coated glass substrate as a reference. The absorbance spectra of the thin films were obtained from the evaluation of R and T data measurements using the formula A = 1 − (T + R). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with PANalytical/Philips X'Pert MRD system. Raman spectroscopy was measured using a Renishaw Raman spectrometer with a 633 nm laser excitation. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) images were collected on a QUANTA 400F Field Emission SEM. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a dual-band E500 ELEXSYS (Bruker) spectrometer.
2.4. Preparation of the photoelectrodes and (photo)electrochemical measurements
The synthesized GO and rGO/ZnONW powder products (9 wt% GO or rGO, 91 wt% ZnO NW) have been dispersed separately in a methanol/isopropanol/1-butanol mixture in a 0.5/3/1 ratio, respectively. The dispersion of the product has been coated on the commercial fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates via spin coating followed by drop-casting until the desired loaded amount (18 mg of active material) has been achieved. PVA-LiCl electrolyte has been applied as the gel electrolyte. PVA-LiCl electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 6 g of PVA in 60 ml of deionized water and heated to 85 °C to obtain a homogenous solution. 6 g of LiCl was added to the solution and stirred at 85 °C for an additional 1 h. The prepared electrode has been wetted with this solution. A piece of filter paper and carbon paper has been wetted with the gel electrolyte and assembled with the fabricated electrode and bare FTO as a counter electrode. The ESI† gives a schematic illustration of the PSC device preparation (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) experiments of the solar-assisted-chargeable supercapacitor have been performed using a Gamry electrochemical workstation. The UV light source (FEMTO-TERA, 8.8 mW cm−2) has been used for the study of UV-irradiation-dependent electrochemical measurements. Specific capacitance (Cp) has been calculated from the CV curves using eqn (1):46 
(1)where C (F g−1) denotes the specific capacitance, while V (V) corresponds to the potential window, I (A) represents the discharge current, m (g) is the mass of the active material, and k (V s−1) is the scan rate.
The GCD data are used to evaluate Cp employing discharge time from eqn (2).17

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material properties of the photoactive electrodes
TEM images of ZnO NW modified by GO and rGO are presented in Fig. 1A. The average diameter and the length of ZnO NW are around 100 ± 20 nm and 900 ± 200 nm, respectively (Fig. 1A-(a)). High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) demonstrates the lattice distance, d = 0.275 ± 0.05 nm which corresponds to the (002) crystal plane of ZnO wurtzite.47 The modified GO and rGO samples are presented in Fig. 1A-(b) and (c). It is observable that ZnO NW is overlapped with GO flakes that can make electron conduction pathways through the GO and rGO sheets. The EDX mapping (Fig. 1A(d)) confirms the distribution of ZnO NW on GO or rGO flakes. The morphological characteristics of the composite thin films have been investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (Fig. 1B). The SEM images show the formation of randomly oriented ZnO NWs along with GO or rGO flakes that are inhomogeneously distributed between the ZnO NWs. EDS spectra and elemental percentage of the nanocomposite products are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

XRD patterns of rGO/ZnONW and GO/ZnONW composite structures are displayed in Fig. 2A. All the diffraction peaks are well–indexed as the hexagonal phase of ZnO (wurtzite structure, space group P63mc, PDF No. 36-1451).2,48 However, there is no characteristic diffraction peak of either GO or rGO, consistent with the previous reports on rGO/ZnO and GO/ZnO composites.38,42 The absence of the characteristic GO or rGO diffraction peaks is attributed to the disorderly stacked rGO/GO planes in the composites with ZnO NW or due to the low concentration of GO or rGO in the composites.48Fig. 2B presents the Raman spectra for ZnO NW, GO/ZnO NW, and rGO/ZnO NW samples. Typical for the wurtzite phase Raman peaks located at 328 (A1(TO)), 379 (E1(TO)), 442 (E2(high)), 568 (A1(LO)) and 651 (E1(LO)) cm−1 are presented in the spectrum of pristine ZnO NW.48 The Raman spectra of GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW samples indicate four peaks namely the D band (1330 cm−1), the G band (1595 cm−1), and the 2D (2650 cm−1), and D + G bands (2890 cm−1), respectively.49 Raman peaks at 1595 and 2650 cm−1 are assigned to the disordered carbon and to the ordered sp2 bonded carbon, respectively, indicating the presence of GO and rGO.50 Besides, the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) may indicate the degree of disorder of the carbon-based materials. The estimated values of ID/IG were 0.94 and 1.14 for ZnO NW/GO and ZnO NW/rGO, respectively, showing a higher degree of disorder for the rGO-based composite.

The optical properties of the composite and pristine ZnO NW were evaluated via UV-visible and PL spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of GO/ZnO NW, rGO/ZnO NW, and as-synthesized ZnO NW are given in Fig. 2C. It is confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy that the composite and pristine ZnO samples can be band-gap-photoexcited by UV light since the absorption edges are observed at 374 nm for all samples. However, the absorbance of GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW is significantly enhanced in the visible light region (380–800 nm), because the colour of the composite material changes from white to grey as the GO or rGO is introduced into the material.51 The PL spectra of ZnO NW, GO/ZnO NW, and rGO/ZnO NW powder samples excited by a 325 nm laser are shown in Fig. 2D. The spectra of all samples demonstrate two emission PL bands located at 640 (1.94 eV) and 383 nm (3.24 eV), respectively. The broad and intense peak in the visible range corresponds to deep-level emission (DLE).52 The PL peak centred in the UV range relates to the near band exciton emission.52 The modification by rGO and GO of the ZnO NW does not change the shape of the PL curve. The increment in the PL intensity for the GO and rGO modified samples might be explained by the enhanced active surface area of the composites.
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements carried out on the composite materials based on GO/rGO and ZnO NW are summarized in Fig. 2E–I. Fig. 2E shows the X-band EPR spectra of GO, ZnO NW, and GO/ZnO NW, where the GO spectrum presents a very sharp line with a typical carbonaceous material characteristic having a g-value of, gGO = 2.0034,53 which suggests that unpaired electrons, hence electron spins, are carbon-based although located on the carbon atoms in proximity to oxygen atoms. The GO EPR resonance signal is superimposed to an impurity-type wide six-line EPR signal characteristic for Mn2+, originating from KMnO4 used in the synthesis procedure of GO. The ZnO NW spectrum is composed of a single EPR line with an isotropic g-value, gZnONW = 1.959, which is assigned to paramagnetic centres associated with ionized oxygen or zinc vacancies that appear in the ZnO crystal structure.54 The X-band EPR spectrum of the composite material GO/ZnO NW shows both EPR signals of the precursor materials GO and ZnO NW but with a significant decrease in the GO EPR signal and the Mn2+ signal. At the same time, the ZnO EPR signal broadens slightly. The X-band EPR spectra of rGO, ZnO NW, and rGO/ZnO NW are presented in Fig. 2F. The rGO material presents no carbon-related paramagnetic centres at all. The composite material shows the ZnO NW characteristic EPR signal and a tiny proportion of the earlier described GO characteristic EPR signal. For a better understanding of the EPR spectra of the composite materials, Q-band measurements were carried out. Since the Q-band has a higher microwave frequency, accordingly, with higher magnetic field strength, the resolution of the EPR lines is enhanced, which gives a better resolution of anisotropic lines. Q-band results are presented in Fig. 2G. Since the EPR measurements in the Q-band are more sensitive, both samples present an Mn2+ characteristic EPR signal, caused most likely by the earlier mentioned KMnO4 impurities of the precursor materials. The carbon-related paramagnetic centres (gGO = 2.0034) are also observable in both samples, together with the ZnO core characteristic EPR signal with gZnONW = 1.95927. The ahead mentioned broadening of the ZnO-related EPR signal in the GO/ZnO NW composite is caused by two different EPR signals with very close g-values, 1.9592(7) and 1.9572(2), which belong to two different core defects. The defect structures of GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW have also been studied at low temperatures (Fig. 2H and I), which clearly indicate that a complex charge transfer process occurs between the composite materials, especially in the GO/ZnO NWs. Here, the relative ratio of the EPR signal intensity of the GO and ZnO characteristic paramagnetic defects changes drastically with decreasing temperature, indicating that a complex hole/electron interaction occurs between GO and ZnO NW at room temperature, which directly influences the relaxation time of the excited electrons, an effect that was proven in the following sections.
 Fig. 3A and B show the EPR analysis data collected under UV irradiation and dark conditions at two temperatures, 300 and 120 K, respectively. At 120 K, the EPR signal increased with UV, and charge carriers stayed at the excited energy level even after turning off the light. Although this effect was less pronounced at room temperature as evidenced by VOC measurements charge relaxation of GO and rGO/ZnO composites took more than 2.7 hours. This charge-trapping phenomenon of GO-based hybrid structure has been previously used to fabricate brain-inspired neuromorphic architectures.55 Although the nature of the charge trapping mechanism of GO has not been fully understood, it has been proposed that either having a covalently bonded honeycomb lattice structure or defects in GO and rGO can act as the charge trapping sites.56,57 Besides, as a UV-active metal oxide, ZnO NW produces photo-generated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) under UV irradiation. GO nanosheets, on the other hand, can interact with other molecules through hydrogen bonds, π–π stacking interactions, and attractive electrostatic force.58 GO sheets composited with ZnO can promote the separation of the e−–h+ pairs due to their Fermi energy level (−0.08 eV vs. NHE) compared to the conduction band edge position of ZnO (−0.31 eV vs. NHE) and their superior electrical conductivity.59,60 Consequently, GO may diminish the recombination of photogenerated carriers and boosts the electrochemical properties of ZnO. Furthermore, GO easily captures photogenerated electrons (e−) and stores in the large π–π network, enhancing the capacitive behaviour of ZnO. Fig. 3C displays the response of the open circuit potential (VOC) of the composite-based PSC devices against UV irradiation. The VOC of both GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW-based devices leap to higher values. More specifically, the increment in the VOC of the GO/ZnO NW is much higher than that of the rGO/ZnO NW-based device. After the UV light is turned on, the relaxation time of both devices is slow, indicating the slow recombination of charge carriers. Fig. 3D shows the schematic illustration of the photoactive material having exceptional charge trapping ability.

3.2. Electrochemical properties
The comparative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the solid-state PSC devices assembled with pristine ZnONW and rGO/ZnO NW and GO/ZnO NW composite powder and carbon paper at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (in a potential range of −1/1 V) under UV irradiation and dark environment are given in Fig. 4A–C. In addition, the dark and illuminated CV scans at various scan rates are given in Fig. S4 (ESI†). All three electrodes exhibit pseudocapacitive behaviour. In addition, a clear distinction in CV data collected in UV irradiated and dark environments is observed for all PSC devices. The CV scan for GO/ZnONW at 100 mV s−1 under UV light exhibited a distinct shift in positive potential (Fig. 4C). This shift can be explained by the increased open circuit potential (VOC) under UV radiation.61,62 The increase in VOC can be explained by the enhanced electron passage through the electrolyte under UV radiation. As the increment in VOC is larger for GO/ZnONW than for GO/ZnONW (Fig. 3C), this shift to positive potentials in CV is more obvious. Specific capacitance (Cp) values have been determined from eqn (1) for all electrodes under UV irradiation and dark conditions. An increase in the Cp value after UV irradiation has been observed for all electrodes. Especially for the GO/ZnO NW electrode, the Cp value has increased more than 3-fold and reached 536 mF g−1 from 165 (Fig. 4C). Besides the Cp of PSC with the GO/ZnO NW electrode was 5.4-fold higher than the PSC with the bare ZnO NW electrode.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of the CV curves of fabricated PSC containing; (A) pristine ZnO NW, (B) rGO/ZnO NW, (C) GO/ZnO NW in the dark and under UV irradiation, comparison of the CV curves of all three PSCs (D) under UV irradiation, (E) under dark condition, (F) Cp, and energy density values of all PSC devices. 
In Fig. 4D and E, the CV curves obtained under the same conditions (100 mV s−1, in a potential range of −1/1 V, under UV irradiation/in the dark) of all three electrodes are compared, indicating the superior capacitive behaviour of GO/ZnO NW over the other PSC devices. It is also noted that the light response of the GO/ZnO NW-based electrode is higher than that of the rGO/ZnO NW electrode. Additionally, the UV and dark environment effects of the CV curves in terms of Cp and energy density of the PSC devices are given in Fig. 4F. It is noted that rGO and GO sheets enhance the specific capacitance, and hence the energy density of the ZnO NW electrode in the dark and under UV irradiation, acting as an electron conductor. The energy densities of the GO/ZnO NW and pristine ZnO electrodes are almost doubled under UV excitation compared to dark conditions. In the case of the rGO/ZnO NW electrode, a slight increase in Cp and energy density is observed compared to that of the GO/ZnO NW electrode.
The galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) analysis results collected under various current densities for the composite-based PSC devices are displayed in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5A, rGO/ZnO NW composite electrode material exhibits a symmetrical triangle shape, indicating excellent reversibility of the charge–discharge process. In Fig. 5B, the comparison between the Coulombic Efficiency (CE%) and Cp concerning the applied current densities is given. The CE% of the rGO/ZnO-based PSC device increases with increasing current densities, and they exceed 100% at higher current densities under UV irradiation. A similar trend is observed for dark conditions as given in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Additionally, the apparent increase in the discharge time at the lower current densities and under UV irradiation is observed for both composite devices (Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 5C displays the energy density values for rGO/ZnO NW at various current densities and under UV irradiation and dark conditions, indicating the enhancement in energy densities with the UV effect. 2469 mW h g−1 and 1002 mW h g−1 energy density values are obtained for GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW, respectively. Unlike rGO/ZnO NW, GO/ZnO NW-based PSC exhibits a slightly different character in the GCD curves; discharging curves have a small threshold because of the longer discharge time (Fig. 5D). GCD also inferred that the charging–discharging period of GO/ZnO NW-based PSC under UV irradiation is longer compared to that of the rGO/ZnO NW-based PSC for all applied current densities (Fig. 5A and D). Compared to the CE% and Cp values obtained under dark conditions, there is a noticeable enhancement under UV irradiation as summarized in Fig. 5C and F.

Compared with the CV analysis, the GO/ZnO NW composite PSC shows better performance in the GCD analysis for both dark and illuminated conditions, possibly owing to a better synergistic effect between ZnO and GO materials that may come from the faradaic pseudocapacitor and electric double-layer capacitor behaviours. The superior capacitive performance of GO/ZnO NW composite PSC can be explained by the material characteristics, especially their defect structure. The long-term stability data in terms of CE% and Cp retention% collected from 5000 consecutive cycles are given in Fig. 5G and H for GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW composite PSC devices, respectively. GO/ZnO NW-based PSC exhibits superior cycling performance during the 5000 cycles at a 111 mA g−1 current density, in which CE% and Cp retention% are entirely preserved during the process (Fig. 5G). The inset of Fig. 5G depicts the individual charging–discharging process in every 1000th cycle starting from the 1st cycle, indicating that the charge–discharge time remains constant. On the other hand, the cycling analysis collected for the rGO/ZnO NW PSC device at a 56 mA g−1 current density shows that CE% starts from the 1st cycle at 58% and increases to approximately 100%. However, the CE% value drops after the 4000th cycle reaching 82% at the end. The inset of Fig. 5H also confirms the shortening charging–discharging process after the 3000th cycle. CE% and Cp retention (%) are key tools for quantifying the rates of electrochemical side reactions at the electrodes. In general, metal oxide-based SC devices exhibit fading capacity response upon continuous charging–discharging owing to redox reactions between the electrode material and respective electrolyte. In our case, Cp retention (%) was retained for a long time due to the whole discharge time. CE% is the ratio between discharge and charge time and refers to the electrochemical reversibility and stability of the charge and discharge process. An obvious increase after the first cycle (increasing the CE% from ∼58 to ∼100%) refers to activation possible due to a weak repositioning of the potentials of the two electrodes.63 Additionally, a clear fading CE% has been observed as a result of decreasing discharging time, while retaining the charging time.
Consequently, the photo-assisted charge–discharge performances and long-term cycling character of the fabricated PSC devices have been compared with the previously reported research results and tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). The table contains three and two electrode systems in liquid electrolyte and solid-state PSC devices. It is noteworthy that the three-electrode and liquid electrolyte systems have much superior Cp and energy density performances compared to solid-state SC devices. However, leakage problems of liquid electrolytes in such systems are a disadvantage due to environmental concerns. Additionally, despite having lower performances, solid-state electrodes, draw higher attention owing to their adaptability to flexible, wearable, and microelectronic applications. Thus, the present design of asymmetric solid-state PSC devices in two-electrode systems has been chosen in this research work.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to explore the interactions between electrode and electrolyte of the fabricated devices. Fig. 6 depicts the EIS spectra of the composite PSC devices in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 kHz under UV irradiation. The Nyquist plots of each electrode indicate a small semi-circle in the high-frequency region. The equivalent electrical circuit model suggested with the fitting process (inset of Fig. 6A and B) exhibits three parts in the circuit. Here, R1 signifies the electrode's ohmic resistance, including the cell components and LiCl electrolyte. R2 and R3 stand for the charge transfer resistance, while Q is the constant phase element, representing the double-layer capacitance. Here, the element representing the Warburg impedance is present because of the semi-straight part in the EIS spectra in the lowest-frequency region, showing that the electrochemical process associated with the diffusion-controlled manner of the composite materials.64 (R2/Q2 + W) signifies the surface layer of active material in contact with the electrolyte. On the other hand, the connected series (C/R3) is pseudo-capacitance, which accounts for the faradaic reaction. The calculated values with the fitting model are tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†).

The charge transfer resistance (R2) of GO/ZnO NW is obviously higher than that of rGO/ZnO NW showing that the accumulation of electrolyte ions across the electrolyte/electrode interface is more dominant. With the UV effect, for GO/ZnO NW-based devices, the solution resistance decreases to half and the charge transfer resistance increases. On the other hand, the effect of UV on the solution resistance of rGO/ZnO NW-based device is negligible, while charge transfer resistance decreases to its half. Bode plots of PSC devices obtained under UV irradiation (Fig. 6C and D) reveal the dependency of modulus of impedance and phase angle on frequency. From the plots, the impedance of GO/ZnO NW is 4 times higher than that of rGO/ZnO NW at low frequency (100 mHz). The maximum phase angle of −54° at the high-frequency region is observed for GO/ZnO NW indicating better capacitive behaviour. Thus, the phase angles are relatively lower than that of an ideal capacitor (−90°), possibly owing to the pseudocapacitive nature.
4. Conclusions
In the present work, the first all-solid-state configuration of GO/and rGO/ZnO NW-based PSC in a two-electrode system has been demonstrated. The synthesis method of the active materials was solution-based and the design of the PSC device was simple, compact, and easily adaptable to large-area applications. In the design of the PSC device, GO/and rGO/ZnO NW electrodes served as both pseudo-capacitive and photo-active electrodes in which the outstanding properties of ZnO such as high absorption and the long relaxation time of light-generated charges were combined with graphene oxide having unique electrical and electrochemical properties. Although all the PSC devices exhibited better Cp values under UV light, the experimental results confirmed that the GO/ZnO NW- based PSC had superior performance compared to pristine and rGO-composited ZnO NW electrodes. In particularly, the Cp values calculated from the CV data confirmed the obvious increase upon UV illumination. Besides CV scans, GCD plots have also displayed the prolonged discharge time under UV light. Consequently, the maximum Cp and energy density values have been observed for GO/ZnO NW-based PSC as 2200 mF g−1 and 2469 mW h kg−1, respectively at a 28 mA g−1 current density. On the other hand, GO/ZnO NW-based PSC, on the other hand, has Cp and an energy density of 875 mF g−1 and 1002 mW h kg−1, respectively at the same current density. Both PSC devices have been subjected to long-term cycling tests (5000-cycles), in which GO/ZnO NW-based PSC again exhibited superior reversibility and stability, enduring the continuous charging–discharging with ∼100% capacitance retention and CE%. Distinctly, the CE% of the rGO/ZnO NW-based PSC decreased to 70% after the 5000-cycles. This distinctive performance disparity of the two PSC devices has been investigated with EPR and VOC analysis in the dark and under UV illumination, indicating a higher leap in VOC of GO/ZnO NW-based PSCs under UV illumination and under applied bias. Interestingly, after turning off the UV light, it took more than 160 min to relax the sample to its initial VOC. Optical, structural, electrochemical, as well as defect analyses, have revealed some distinct differences between GO/ZnO NW and rGO/ZnO NW, which probably caused the remarkable improvement of the PSC performance. The enhanced PSC performance of the newly proposed GO/ZnO NW composite may be related to the improved optical properties as compared to ZnO NW, as well as to the lower degree of disorder, the presence of carbonaceous based defects, and the larger number of carbon layers, as compared to the rGO/ZnO NW composite.
