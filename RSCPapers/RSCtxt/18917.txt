During the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn much attention due to their easy preparation process and rapidly growing photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 In PSCs, hole transporting materials (HTMs) play a major role in extracting photo-generated holes, preventing internal charge recombination and enhancing stability.4 Various HTMs have been developed for high-performance PSCs. However, most of them could not passivate the defects at the perovskite surface.5–9 Therefore, developing efficient passivators for surface defects has been an important research subject.5–9 Nevertheless, the application of passivators complicates the device fabrication process. Moreover, the optimal amount of passivators is hard to control. Therefore, it would be a promising research direction to introduce passivating groups into the molecular structures to obtain HTMs with dual functions of passivating defects and transporting holes.5–9 Recently, many researchers have introduced an S atom into HTMs and found that their interaction with perovskite is enhanced.10–13 Due to the weak interaction between S and Pb, there are also many opposite conclusions, that is, a HTM with S is not beneficial for device performance.14–17
In previous reports, various ammonium salts have been used as efficient passivators, which possess strong interaction with perovskite.2,18–22 In this work, we introduce ammonium salts on the molecular structure of carbazole–triphenylamine HTMs, termed H-amm. A reference HTM without any ammonium salts, termed H-alk, is also prepared for comparative study. The molecular structures of these two HTMs are illustrated in Fig. 1. The detailed preparation processes of these two compounds are illustrated in the ESI.†
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures and electrostatic surface potential maps of H-alk and H-amm. 
The electrostatic surface potential (ESP) maps, optimized molecular geometries, electronic density distribution of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, and hole reorganization energies for H-alk and H-amm are calculated by time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) using Gaussian 16 at B3LYP under the B3LYP/6-311G* level. As shown in Fig. 1, the ESP map illustrates the obviously electronegative character of Br−, illustrating the dipole structure of H-amm.23–25 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the optimized structures of the investigated molecules. It can be noted that the introduction of ammonium salts has a minor effect on the molecular structure. Therefore, H-alk and H-amm are speculated to have similar intermolecular π–π stacking and conjugation.
The photophysical properties of H-alk and H-amm are investigated by UV-vis absorption and emission measurements, as summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, H-alk and H-amm illustrate an absorption peak at around 373 and 383 nm in toluene, respectively. The slightly bathochromic spectral response of H-amm may result from the electron-withdrawing ability of the ammonium salts. The emission spectra of H-alk and H-amm show a maximum peak of 464 and 481 nm, respectively. The optical band gaps (Eg) of H-alk and H-amm calculated from normalized UV-vis and emission spectra are 2.97 and 2.90 eV, respectively.

The redox potentials of the investigated molecules are determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements.26 As illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the estimated HOMO levels of H-alk and H-amm are −5.32 and −5.33 eV, respectively. The valence band of the conventional (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 perovskite is around −5.91 eV,27 illustrating that the prepared HTMs are favorable for hole extraction. The LUMO levels of H-alk and H-amm estimated from the HOMO and Eg levels are −2.35 and −2.43 eV, respectively. The extremely positive LUMO levels of these two molecules compared to the conduction band of perovskite could prevent undesirable electron transfer back to the Au electrode. The HOMO (LUMO, Eg) levels of H-alk and H-amm from TDDFT calculations are −4.68 (−1.19, 3.49) and −4.76 (−1.50, 3.26) eV, respectively. The experimental data are fully consistent with the TDDFT results.
Hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au are fabricated to investigate the effect of ammonium salts on hole mobility referring to previous reports. The current–voltage (J–V) curves are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The hole mobility values of H-alk and H-amm estimated referred to Mott–Gurney law are 5.24 × 10−5 and 8.96 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The calculated hole reorganization energies (λhole) of H-alk and H-amm are 0.145 and 0.109 eV, respectively. Therefore, the introduction of ammonium salts on the carbazole–triphenylamine HTM is beneficial for improving hole mobility. Fig. S1 (ESI†) displays the LUMO and HOMO orbital densities of H-alk and H-amm. For H-amm, the HOMO electronic density is located throughout the entire Br−, which can result from the strong electron-withdrawing property of Br− though the methyl on the ammonium branch possesses electron-donating properties. The LUMO electronic density is typically delocalized at the carbazole–triphenylamine central conjugation. Therefore, an intramolecular charge transfer could take place in H-amm.28
We perform photoluminescence measurements of perovskite/HTM bilayer to study charge-transfer dynamics, as illustrated in Fig, S4 (ESI†). When H-alk or H-amm is covered on perovskite film, the photoluminescence is significantly quenched, implying efficient hole extraction capability. Moreover, the perovskite/HTM bilayer based on H-amm exhibits blue shift compared with H-alk, illustrating the recovery of the intrinsic bandgap attributed to the passivation effect of ammonium salts in H-amm.29,30 The stronger quenching ability of H-amm indicates its better hole extraction capability and stronger chemical interaction with perovskite than H-alk. From the time-resolved photoluminescence (Fig. S4b, ESI†), the decay times are estimated to be around 12.7 ns for perovskite, 2.7 ns for perovskite/H-alk and 1.9 ns for perovskite/H-amm, respectively, which is consistent with the above photoluminescence results. It was speculated that compared with H-alk, ammonium salts on H-amm could bind with the undercoordinated cation or anion to reduce the trap density of the perovskite surface, and thus suppress the non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface.12,14
To study the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with H-alk and H-amm as the HTM, conventional planar devices with a structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/Au were fabricated,27 as illustrated in the ESI.† The device scheme in this work is also inserted in Fig. 3a. The devices are measured under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 3a illustrates J–V curves for the best-performing devices with different HTMs, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. The best-performing PSCs with H-alk and H-amm exhibit a PCE of 18.01% and 19.02% under reverse scans. It can be found that the H-amm-based devices show relatively high open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared with that of H-alk. This could be ascribed to the reduction of interfacial carrier recombination due to passivation of the perovskite surface by an ammonium salt group on H-amm and a more suitable interfacial HOMO band alignment with perovskite.14 Interestingly, H-alk and H-amm-based devices show similar short-circuit current (Jsc) with each other. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimal PSCs with different HTMs are illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which agrees with the Jsc results obtained from the J–V measurements. Moreover, the PSC employing H-amm has higher fill factor (FF) compared with that of H-alk, which may result from the related higher mobility and stronger interaction with perovskite. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), among around 10 devices measured with each HTM, the average PCE of the H-amm-based PSCs is still relatively higher than that of H-alk-based ones. Fig. 3a shows the hysteresis behavior of the devices with different HTMs, which are measured from different scan directions. The hysteresis index of the devices with H-alk and H-amm calculated from HI = (PCEreverse–PCEforward)/PCEreverse is 0.063 and 0.036, respectively. H-amm shows less hysteresis compared with H-alk, which may result from the decreased surface defects by ammonium salts.31

To prove the potential of practical applications, the long-term stability of the devices with H-alk and H-amm was studied. The devices were stored without encapsulation at room temperature (∼20% relative humidity). As shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S6 (ESI†), the H-amm based PSC shows better stability than that of H-alk regardless of illumination or not, which could result from the presence of the passivating functional groups, ammonium salts, on the HTM structure.18,21,22
To further understand the influence of ammonium salts on device performance, electrochemical analysis was used to study the carrier recombination and transfer at the interface or throughout the device. As shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†), the transient photovoltage decay of an H-amm-based device is much slower than that of an H-alk-based device. As shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†), the electron lifetime (τ) at different photovoltages is further calculated from the photovoltage decay data according to the expression of τ = KBTq−1(dVoc/dt)−1, where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge. It is noted that the H-amm-based device has longer τ compared with the H-alk-based device, which indicates that the carrier recombination rate in the entire device is reduced. The Nyquist plots of both devices at a bias of 0.8 V are shown in Fig. S7c (ESI†). It is known that the low frequency region in the Nyquist plots is generally influenced by the ionic migration in an active layer and the high frequency region by the carrier recombination process.32 The fitted results of recombination resistance (Rrec) according to the equivalent circuit are around 41 Ω for the H-alk-based device and 132 Ω for the H-amm-based device, respectively, which also indicates the suppressed charge recombination. The plots of Voc verse light intensity are also measured as given in Fig. S7d (ESI†), where the slope of the fitted line can represent the charge recombination mechanisms. A slope near KBT/q means that bimolecular recombination is dominant, while a slope greater than KBT/q implies additional trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in the device. Here, the slope is 2.252 KBT/q and 1.085 KBT/q for the H-alk- and H-amm-based devices, respectively, which indicates that the trap-assisted recombination is reduced in the latter device.
In summary, ammonium salts have been successfully introduced into the carbazole–triphenylamine HTM. Compared with the non-ammonium salts counterpart, the HTM containing ammonium salts shows slightly higher PCE and much enhanced stability. The results prove that developing new passivating group-containing HTMs is a promising way to obtain efficient and stable PSCs.
