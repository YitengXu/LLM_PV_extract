    , Accepted 5th April 2016First published on 5th April 2016AbstractThe theoretical maximum of open-circuit voltage (VOC) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has yet to be determined, and its origin remains debated. Here, we demonstrate that VOC of small-molecule OPV devices can be improved by controlling the deposition rate of a donor without changing the interfacial energy gap at the donor/acceptor interface. The measurement of external quantum efficiency and electroluminescence spectra facilitates the observation of the existence of charge transfer (CT) states. A simplified approach by reusing the reciprocity relationship for obtaining the properties of the CT states is proposed without introducing complex techniques. We compare experimental and fitting results and propose that reorganization energy is the primary factor in determining VOC instead of either the CT energy or electronic coupling term in bilayer OPV devices. Atomic force microscopy images indicate a weak molecular aggregation when a higher deposition rate is used. The results of temperature-dependent measurements suggest the importance of molecular stacking for the CT properties.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been extensively developed to be used in next-generation solar-harvesting optoelectronic devices by introducing novel materials and fabrication processes.1 Because of the limited absorption and carrier transport properties,2 the short-circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) have enabled approximating the theoretical maximum.3 To overcome the limitation for achieving a higher device performance, several researchers have employed a tandem structure that consists of single cells in serial connection for obtaining almost double the open-circuit voltage (VOC) at a slight expense of JSC and FF, thus achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%.4 Therefore, an increase in VOC enables a further improvement of the PCE.5VOC is determined by an energetic gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of a donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of an acceptor.6 The control of both HOMO levels of donors and LUMO levels of acceptors enabled tuning of VOC. Substantial progress in the improvement of VOC was achieved by Mutolo et al., who achieved a more than twofold increase in the VOC by replacing a conventional donor, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), with a donor having a low-lying HOMO level, subphthalocyanine.7 Subsequently, a series of new donors were synthesized with low-lying HOMO levels, which proved the relationship of VOC with the HOMO levels of the donors.8 However, the energetic gap between the donor and the acceptor is typically more than 1.5 eV in high-VOC OPV devices with fullerene systems (i.e., a donor with a low-lying HOMO with an acceptor C60 or C70), which have not yet yielded such high values, thus indicating the presence of energetic losses in the donor/acceptor interface. To achieve higher PCE in OPV devices, the origin of VOC should be determined to minimize energetic losses.9
Although the photovoltaic mechanisms between inorganic- and organic-based devices slightly differ,10 a similar diode behavior rendering the characteristics of the organic-based devices can be expressed in eqn (1):11 (1) Here, RS and RSH are the series and shunt resistances in units of Ω, respectively, JS is the dark saturation current, A is the device active area, n is the ideality factor of the diode, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, and JPH is the photocurrent. By setting J = 0 and assuming JPH = JSC ≫ JS, RS = 0, and RSH → ∞, the VOC can be simplified to eqn (2): (2) This equation implies that the lower the saturation current is, the higher the VOC that can be obtained.12 Perez et al. discussed the influence of the saturation current on VOC in more detail in the form of its origin. They suggested that when JS is dominated by recombination currents (n ≈ 2) at the donor/acceptor interface, JS is exponentially proportional to the interfacial energy gap (ΔEDA) as shown in eqn (3):13 (3)JS0 is a prefactor that depends on material properties such as the carrier generation and recombination rates. The factor 2 concerns the thermal generation of both holes and electrons at the donor/acceptor interface, thus accounting for the activation energy of ΔEDA/2 for this process. Substituting eqn (3) into eqn (2) yields eqn (4): (4) Therefore, the role of JS0 becomes a crucial factor influencing VOC in addition to the energetic gap. By comparing two sets of material systems with different π-conjugations, tetracene-to-rubrene and CuPc-to-platinum tetraphenylbenzoporphyrin, they proposed that a strong intermolecular interaction would lead to a higher JS0 and, hence, a lower VOC. Erwin et al. showed that the influence of varying the steric bulk enabled obtaining an identical relationship of the molecular interaction with VOC.14 These results indicate the importance of the molecular interaction at the donor/acceptor interface on the basis of a rough comparison of the experimental data and fitting them to simple equations.
A direct determination of the molecular interaction at the donor/acceptor interface can be achieved by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of charge transfer (CT) states.15 In polymeric systems, specific techniques, such as Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy16 and photothermal deflection spectroscopy,17 are typically used to determine CT states.18 Raw derived a reciprocal relationship between photovoltaic external quantum efficiency (EQE) and electroluminescence (EL) emission of photovoltaic devices.19 Vandewal et al. developed a systematic and comprehensive relationship between VOC and the CT states by applying Raw's derivation and Marcus theory.20 According to the previous studies, VOC is dependent on the properties of the CT states.18d–k By contrast, few studies have discussed CT states in small-molecule OPV devices.21 In our previous studies, we have observed variation in VOC by controlling the deposition rates of donor materials.22 When the deposition rate is changed, the electronic states (i.e., the HOMO and LUMO levels) remained the same. However, VOC exhibited a considerable variation, thus indicating that the effects of the CT states are as crucial in small molecules as they are in polymers. In this study, we used 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane (TAPC)6b,23 as a donor and C60 as an acceptor in fabricating bilayer OPV devices. VOC exhibited a wide variation in relation to the change in the deposition rate of TAPC. The variation in VOC was attributed to the influence of the CT states instead of the electronic states because of the unchanged HOMO and LUMO levels of TAPC that was deposited with various deposition rates. By comparing the reduced EQE and EL spectra of the OPV devices, the properties of the CT states at the TAPC/C60 interface were extracted by applying the theory derived by Vandewal et al.20a The proposed approach simplified the observation of the CT absorption band and emission without necessitating additional complex techniques. At a lower deposition rate of TAPC, the losses in VOC increased because of high reorganization energy (λ) which hindered the CT process. When the deposition rate of TAPC was increased, the EL intensity of the OPV device also increased because of the reduced λ and, hence, a decrease in VOC losses was observed. In contrast to previous study,24 we proposed that the term electronic coupling (f) in an equation describing the CT absorption band is irrelevant for determining VOC. VOC depends more on λ than on the CT energy (ECT) and f. In addition, the influence of morphological changes and molecular stacking on VOC was thoroughly studied. A series of temperature-dependent measurements were conducted to enable the discussion of the relationship between the CT states and VOC.
Results and discussion
The device structure of the OPV devices was indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/TAPC (10 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/bathocuproine (BCP) (10 nm)/Al (120 nm). The corresponding energy-level diagram and the molecular structures of the materials are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1). The surface of an ITO-coated glass substrate was modified using oxygen plasma to facilitate a superior energy-level alignment at the anode interface.25Fig. 1a presents the dark- and photo-current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPV devices with various TAPC deposition rates. The data were acquired from ten devices on two different substrates, and the average value and error bars are provided. The deposition rates were in situ and simultaneously monitored using a deposition controller with a quartz crystal microbalance during the fabrication process (ESI,† Fig. S2). Because the TAPC thin film was only 10 nm, the deposition rate of 0.80 nm s−1 meant that the thin-film formation was completed in approximately 12.5 s. This process may yield an inaccurate thickness of the TAPC thin film. Several studies have reported thickness-dependent VOC in OPV devices.26 To avoid the thickness-dependent issue, device structures of ITO/TAPC (8, 10, 12, and 14 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Al with TAPC deposited at 0.10 nm s−1 were fabricated and tested (ESI,† Fig. S3). The results showed that VOC exhibited thickness-independent properties and, therefore, VOC was unlikely to vary because of the slight inaccuracy of the film thickness. Table 1 provides a summary of the performance of the OPV devices. VOC was considerably altered when the TAPC deposition rate was increased from 0.03 and 0.15 to 0.80 nm s−1. JSC exhibited a slight reduction in response to variation in the deposition rate of TAPC. FF was almost identical when deposition rates of 0.03 and 0.15 nm s−1 were used, whereas it substantially decreased when TAPC was deposited at 0.80 nm s−1. In general, VOC is correlated with the HOMO–LUMO offsets between donors and acceptors.6a,b,8c,27 To determine the influence of the deposition rate of TAPC on the electronic states, low-energy photoelectron and UV-vis spectroscopic measurements were performed. The results showed that both the HOMO and LUMO levels were independent of the TAPC deposition rates (ESI,† Fig. S4). In the device configuration, the energy difference between the HOMO of TAPC (5.5 eV)28 and the LUMO of C60 (4.0 eV)12b is approximately 1.5 eV. Therefore, in the current study, the HOMO–LUMO offset was unlikely to contribute to the variation in VOC. In addition, the unchanged electronic states may indicate that the loss in VOC could result from a decrease in the nonradiative CT recombination rate constant and carrier mobility, which reduces the Langevin-type collision rate. Fig. 1b shows the J–V characteristics of the OPV devices as a semi-logarithmic plot together with the error bars. The dark current decreased when the TAPC deposition rate was increased. The result is consistent with that reported in previous study regarding the improvement of VOC by reducing the dark current.12b,c,14 The poor electrical properties reflected by JSC and FF may be attributable to the reduced transporting properties of TAPC. Under the influence of the deposition rate, the molecular stacking of the thin film according to the thermodynamics may be changed.29 At a lower deposition rate, the molecules have sufficient time to travel toward and reach the lowest energy site to form the thin film. However, when the deposition rate was increased, the molecules were unable to travel a long distance before the deposition of the thin film, thus increasing the site-to-site hopping distance. Therefore, the carrier mobility decreased when a high deposition rate was used; consequently, the electrical property deteriorated, as shown in the forward current in Fig. 1b. Another possible reason for the slightly reduced JSC is that the light absorption of all OPV devices is primarily contributed by the C60 thin film, which remained the same for all devices.

Fig. 2a shows the EQE spectra of the OPV devices with various TAPC deposition rates. For comparison, a single-layer C60 OPV device was fabricated with the structure ITO/C60 (40 nm)/Al. Because JSC is linearly proportional to EQE, EQE slightly decreased when the TAPC deposition rate was increased. The inset in Fig. 2a shows the semi-logarithmic plot of the corresponding EQE spectra. Compared with the single-layer C60 device, which exhibited a substantial drop at low photon energy, the OPV devices with TAPC exhibited a shoulder in photon energy of approximately 1.7 eV. This result was consistent with that of Vandewal et al., indicating the probability of the existence of CT states.30 To investigate the existence of the CT states, the OPV devices were driven by a current of 60 mA to enable the observation of their EL spectra without concerning the different injection conditions. Fig. 2b shows the EL spectra of the OPV devices together with single-layer TAPC and C60 devices with a structure of ITO/TAPC or C60 (40 nm)/Al. The EL intensity was recorded using a spectrometer and the data were not further processed. Because of the considerably low EL intensity of C60 and the limitations of the spectrometer, we cannot observe the EL intensity of the C60-only device. Accordingly, we can ensure that the observed EL is only contributed by the TAPC and TAPC/C60 devices. The single-layer TAPC device presented a similar EL spectrum as reported in previous study,31 whereas the OPV devices exhibited a wide emission in the range of 700 to 1100 nm and peaked at approximately 880 nm. The peak wavelength approximately corresponded to 1.4 eV, similar to the HOMO–LUMO difference between TAPC and C60, which has a value of 1.5 eV. Therefore, the wide-range EL spectra were mainly caused by the emission of the CT states. When the TAPC deposition rate was increased, the EL intensity also increased. Previous reports have shown the relationship between the EL intensity and VOC, proposing that VOC can be improved by increasing the EL intensity.19,20 In the current study, when the deposition rate of TAPC was increased, VOC and EL intensity were considerably enhanced. These results are consistent with those reported in previous studies. Therefore, we inferred that the improvement in VOC is highly correlated with the variation in the properties of the CT states.

The inset shows the corresponding EQE spectra as a semi-logarithmic plot. (b) EL spectra of the OPV devices with various deposition rates of TAPC. The EL spectrum of a single-layer TAPC device is provided (magnified twofold). All the OPV and TAPC single-layer devices were operated at 60 mA. The integration time of the spectrometer is 60 s. 
To determine the relationship of the CT properties with VOC, the CT absorption and emission must be obtained first. The CT absorption band at unit energy can be expressed as in eqn (5):20a (5) The CT emission rate If per unit energy can be expressed as in eqn (6):20a (6) Here, E is the photon energy and fI is a prefactor interpreted by the electronic coupling term in the same manner as f. Eqn (5) and (6) are the so-called reduced EQE and EL spectra. The CT properties, f, ECT, and λ can be extracted by fitting the reduced EQE and EL spectra to eqn (5) and (6), respectively. Because the reduced EQE spectrum was directly obtained from the experiment, the f value was determined first. The experimental results and the corresponding fits are shown in Fig. 3. According to the framework of Marcus theory, the reduced spectra are symmetric at a midpoint ECT value with the line width λ.20a We assumed that fI is equal to f as it did in our previous study,32 thus determining the reduced EL spectrum and, hence, the estimation of ECT and λ. In addition, the spectra of all the devices have the same peak, as observed in Fig. 2b. Therefore, the unchanged peaks of the reduced spectra are not artefacts of the measurement. Few previous studies18d–k have determined the reduced EQE and EL spectra simultaneously,18l which may cause an inaccurate extraction of the CT properties. By contrast, we obtained f, ECT, and λ for the OPV devices with 0.03, 0.15, and 0.80 nm s−1 deposition rates of TAPC as shown in Fig. 3a–c, respectively, without using any specific techniques. In addition, the double-headed arrows in the figures indicate the reorganization energy λ, thus demonstrating the accuracy in determining the CT properties using the proposed approach. Although the sensitivity of EQE was insufficient to predict eqn (5) in the low energy range, the experimental data and the corresponding fits were in good agreement at the CT absorption band. In addition, the EL fits agreed approximately with eqn (6). Because of the disordered density of states, the CT fits may deviate at the center of CT emission. As indicated by the vertical, solid lines, ECT was not influenced by the deposition rate of TAPC. By contrast, the deposition rate of TAPC caused variation in λ, which exhibited a decreasing trend when the deposition rate was increased. As shown in eqn (5), the f value is proportional to EQE, and therefore, the improvement in VOC was mainly caused by the influence of λ instead of f.

The solid lines are the fits according to eqn (5) and (6), corresponding to the CT absorption band and emission. The vertical, solid lines indicate the CT energy ECT. The double-headed arrows indicate the reorganization energy λ. 
The CT process occurs between the molecules of a donor and an acceptor. Therefore, in a bilayer OPV device, this process can be related to the diode characteristic; the dark saturation current, as has been proposed in previous study,18h can be transformed, as expressed in eqn (7): (7) EQEEL is the EL EQE of the OPV devices and ϕTBB(E) is the black-body spectrum at temperature T. Because ϕTBB(E) exponentially decreases when photon energy increases, the integral in eqn (7) is primarily dominated by the low-energy CT states.18h Combined with eqn (5), eqn (7) can be expressed as eqn (8):20a (8) Here, h is the Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The CT properties are now related to the basic diode behavior. Therefore, the general expression of VOC, as shown in eqn (2), can be further expressed as in eqn (9):20a (9) This equation relates VOC to the CT properties and describes the energetic losses of the OPV devices, ΔV, which is the difference between VOC and ECT/q. Without a perturbation of thermal effects (i.e., T equals zero), VOC can reach its theoretical maximum ECT/q. Under normal conditions, the energetic losses can be divided into two parts, radiative (ΔVrad) and nonradiative (ΔVnonrad) losses, as shown in the second and third terms in eqn (9), respectively. By using the CT properties shown in Fig. 3, the energetic losses can be calculated; they are summarized in Table 2 (ESI,† Sections S5 and S6). When the TAPC deposition rate was increased from 0.03 and 0.15 to 0.80 nm s−1, ΔV decreased from 0.82 and 0.76 to 0.63 V. Because of the thermodynamic effects,9b,20a the radiative losses ΔVrad were unavoidable (0.229 eV for all devices). However, the nonradiative losses ΔVnonrad were considerably reduced by increasing the deposition rate of TAPC, thus optimizing VOC at the highest deposition rate of 0.80 nm s−1. As shown in eqn (9), ΔVnonrad is dominated by the emission EQE. The calculated EQEEL suggests that the increased emission intensity positively affected the reduction of ΔVnonrad. This result is consistent with the observation of the EL spectra, as shown in Fig. 2b.

The origin of VOC in OPV devices is conventionally related to the electronic states (i.e., the HOMO–LUMO offset between the donors and the acceptors).6 Further discussion about the influence of the intermolecular interaction between donors and acceptors on VOC was proposed by Perez et al.13 The experimental results and the fits according to the general diode equation facilitated a comprehensive understanding of VOC. In addition, the observation of the CT absorption band encouraged an in-depth development of the model based on Marcus theory for explaining VOC using the CT properties of polymer-based OPV devices.18–20 Graham et al. suggested that CT processes should involve considering the molecular orientation to explain VOC instead of only the intermolecular interaction. They attributed the high VOC of rubrene-based OPV devices to the face-on orientation at the rubrene/C60 interface compared with tetracene-based devices which exhibit an edge-on orientation. Most importantly, they attributed the improvement in VOC to the electronic coupling term f, as shown in eqn (5). We proposed that f is directly related to JSC because of two reasons. First, f is linearly proportional to EQE at unit energy, as shown in eqn (5). Second, the thermodynamically caused energetic losses of VOC, which are represented by the second term in eqn (9), are typically less than 0.3–0.4 eV.20a,32 In addition, thermodynamic losses are primarily dominated by kT instead of the natural-logarithmic term, which is irrelevantly affected by f because of its logarithmic relationship. Fig. 4a shows the relationship between f and JSC. The f value decreased with JSC, thus exhibiting a linear relationship. In the current study, the ΔVrad value was maintained at 0.229 V, independent of the deposition rate of TAPC. Therefore, the observed linear relationship between f and JSC was reasonable. In addition, the term f is the product of the square of the matrix element, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), and the number of CT states. Although the calculation of the matrix element is beyond the scope of the current study, we inferred that the matrix element is lower at a high rate of deposition. Because EQE is the product of IQE and device absorption, the parameter IQE is expected to be low at a high deposition rate of TAPC. Consequently, the term f will be reduced when the TAPC deposition rate increases. Although the reorganization energy λ varied considerably among the OPV devices, the contribution to ΔVrad was irrelevant because of the logarithmic relationship. By contrast, the influence of λ was considerably related to VOC, as shown in Fig. 4b, which exhibited a perfectly symmetric relationship of λ–VOC when the deposition rate of TAPC was increased. Therefore, we propose that VOC is primarily dominated by λ instead of f in OPV devices, providing a re-evaluation of the theory derived by Vandewal for relating VOC to the CT properties. The reorganization energy describes the ease of the CT transfer between donors and acceptors.21f,33 In the studied devices, λ decreased when the TAPC deposition rate was increased. The reduced λ indicates that the CT process required less energy to transfer the charges between TAPC and C60 in devices with a high TAPC deposition rate. The improvement in VOC was mainly attributed to the reduction of ΔVnonrad, which is represented by the third term in eqn (9). This term is correlated with the EL properties of the OPV devices. Therefore, we inferred that the reduction of λ enhanced the CT transfer between TAPC and C60.33b The enhanced CT transfer may increase the possibility of the recombination of the CT states and, hence, the EL intensity, as observed in Fig. 2b. Fig. 4c shows the relationship between EL and EQEEL of the OPV devices at different TAPC deposition rates. Because the contribution of EQEEL to ΔVnonrad is in the natural-logarithmic term, EQEEL was plotted on a logarithmic scale. The trend in EL intensity was consistent with that in EQEEL. Therefore, the improvement in VOC in the current study was strongly correlated with the EL property of the CT states. In eqn (9) the reorganization energy plays a role in the second term which is called radiative recombination in the current study. However, the term (ECT–λ) is almost identical to ECT because of the orders of magnitude. In addition, this term is in natural logarithm. Therefore, the dependence of λ on the second term of eqn (9) has a negligible effect. The EL intensity increased by a factor of four, as observed in Fig. 2b, while EQEEL varied at least thousand times. It was unclear why these were inconsistent. Nevertheless, in Fig. 4c the relationship of EL intensity with log(EQEEL) is in good agreement.

The thin-film morphology is typically affected by deposition conditions such as thermal annealing,34 the templating layer underneath,35 the deposition approach,1b,36 and the deposition rate.22 To investigate the influence of the deposition rate of TAPC on the morphological change, atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurements were conducted. Fig. 5a–c show the morphology (5 × 5 μm) of the 10 nm TAPC thin films deposited at 0.03, 0.15, and 0.80 nm s−1, respectively, on Si wafers with a surface roughness of approximately 0.2 nm. Because TAPC is naturally amorphous, all images show an amorphous morphology. The thin film deposited at 0.03 nm s−1 exhibited a pin-hole-like morphology. The pin-hole-like feature gradually disappeared when the deposition rate of TAPC was increased, especially for the 0.80 nm s−1 thin film, which exhibited a smooth morphology. Fig. 5d–f shows the corresponding thin-film morphology over a small area (2 × 2 μm). The pin holes were clearly observed in the thin film deposited at 0.03 nm s−1, whereas the thin films deposited at 0.15 and 0.80 nm s−1 exhibited considerably smoother surfaces. The surface roughness decreased from 0.50 and 0.42 to 0.37 nm when the deposition rate was increased. As suggested in previous study, the pin-hole-like morphology can be attributed to the aggregation of TAPC molecules.29 The molecules are prone to finding their lowest-energy state during the thin-film formation. At a high deposition rate, the molecules have insufficient time to travel a long distance before the deposition of the following layer. Therefore, the distance between the molecules may be longer when the deposition rate is increased, thus leading to a longer site-to-site hopping distance. The extended hopping distance impedes the carrier transport and reduces the electrical properties, as observed from the decreasing trend of JSC and FF. In addition, the phenomenon of the aggregation occurred not only on a Si wafer but on ITO substrates (ESI,† Fig. S5). Fig. 5g–i illustrates the possibility of the molecular stacking of TAPC thin films. Because of the aggregation of the TAPC molecules, the clusters of the TAPC molecules were far from each other. When the deposition rate was increased, the clusters became close, thus leading to a smooth surface, as observed in the AFM images. Therefore, the decreased electrical properties as observed in the decreasing trend in JSC and FF are attributed to the clusters of the TAPC and not the TAPC molecules. To prove our inference, temperature-dependent measurements based on the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) and a spatially correlated GDM (CGDM) were performed on a hole-only device with a structure of ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/TAPC (100 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (120 nm) to determine the influence of the deposition rate of TAPC (ESI,† Fig. S6 and S7).37 Because the GDM failed in the calculation of the positional disorder, the CGDM was used to investigate the relationship between the deposition rate and the electrical properties. The spatially correlated energetic disorder σd exhibited an increasing trend from 100 and 103 to 110 meV (ESI,† Table S1). Although this small variation cannot constitute a trend, this may possibly imply the reduced carrier-transport properties, as observed from the reduced JSC and FF, when the deposition rate of TAPC was increased. To determine the reason for the reduced electrical properties, a measurement of the temperature-dependent JSC was performed (ESI,† Fig. S8). The estimated trap depth was 2.73, 3.68, and 6.07 meV for the OPV devices with the TAPC deposited at 0.03, 0.15, and 0.80 nm s−1, respectively. Although these values are less than the thermal energy and energetic disorder and thereby they cannot be the actual traps, it can still provide a relationship between the electrical and CT properties. A deeper trap depth indicates a hindered carrier transport and, hence, the electrical properties. Nevertheless, a deeper trap depth may enhance the radiative CT recombination between TAPC and C60 molecules at the interface, thus leading to a higher EL intensity of the CT states. As observed from the CGDM fitting results (ESI,† Table S1), the site-to-site hopping distance between the TAPC clusters decreased from 0.39 and 0.29 to 0.22 nm. This result supports our inference that extended molecular stacking may hinder the CT process, thus resulting in a low efficiency of the radiative CT recombination (Fig. 5g–i).21f The reduced radiative CT recombination, as observed in Fig. 2b, can negatively affect the improvement in VOC. The longer distance necessary for the CT transfer to occur may implicitly reflect the increased reorganization energy λ at the lower deposition rate. In addition, the disordered thin film minimizes the poor orientation of TAPC molecules, thus reducing the electronic coupling between TAPC and C60 molecules. The reorganization energy is a result of the electronic coupling such as molecular orientation, stacking, and interaction. The previous reports have indicated that VOC can be substantially influenced by the surface morphology, which resulted from the variation of the electronic coupling.38 Therefore, we inferred that the deposition rate dependence of reorganization energy is a result of the morphological change.

To determine the improvement in VOC, the barrier height ΦB at the donor/acceptor interface was estimated using eqn (10):12a (10) The JS value was calculated by fitting the experimental dark J–V characteristics to eqn (1) for the temperature range of 260 to 320 K (ESI,† Fig. S9). In the plot of ln(JS) against (1000/T) the slopes of the curves yielded the barrier heights ΦB of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.87 eV for the OPV devices with the TAPC deposited at 0.03, 0.15, and 0.80 nm s−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. Concurrently, we estimated the built-in potential Vbi inside the device using capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics (ESI,† Fig. S10). The Vbi inside the OPV devices was increased from 0.56 and 0.61 to 0.78 V when the deposition rate of TAPC was increased. Although the estimated Vbi was slightly lower than the barrier height ΦB, the trends were similar. A possible reason for this difference is that the Mott–Schottky relation requires an Ohmic contact at the electrodes to prevent the Fermi-level pinning of the metals.39 In general, the organic/metal interface exhibits an imperfect Ohmic contact, thus causing the voltage losses we observed in our experiments. Nevertheless, both the barrier height ΦB and the built-in potential Vbi were consistent with the variation in VOC. The estimations of ΦB and Vbi were less than the experimental VOC values, which may have resulted from the energetic losses as aforementioned. Therefore, the unchanged ECT but with different ΦB and Vbi can also be attributed to the energetic losses that occurred at the TAPC/C60 interface. At a lower deposition rate of TAPC, a lower barrier height was observed. The lower barrier height at the TAPC/C60 interface indicates a smaller band bending compared with the bending in devices with higher rates of deposition. Under a reverse bias, minority carriers, electrons and holes thermally generated in the TAPC and C60 layers recombine more easily if the band bending at the TAPC/C60 interface is small. When the barrier height increases, the band bending increased. The recombination of the minority carriers was impeded because of the larger potential drop at the interface. Therefore, the reverse dark saturation current originating from the carrier recombination was reduced when a higher deposition rate of TAPC was used, as shown in Fig. 1b. These results explain how VOC can be improved by reducing the dark saturation currents, as demonstrated in previous studies.12

Experimental
Materials and device fabrication
Organic materials, TAPC, C60, and BCP, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received without purification. ITO-coated glass substrates were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corporation. The sheet resistance of the ITO was approximately 15 Ω sq−1. The ITO substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in a series of solutions, detergents, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, for ten minutes in each step. The ITO surface was treated with oxygen plasma to achieve an improved energy-level alignment with the adjacent organic layer.25b Thin-film deposition was performed in a high-vacuum chamber with a pressure lower than 8 × 10−6 Torr. The deposition rates of organic layers were monitored and recorded during the thin-film deposition using a deposition controller (Sycon Instruments STM-2XM) with a quartz crystal microbalance. Deposition rates of 0.03, 0.15, and 0.80 nm s−1 were used to deposit TAPC thin films, and the remaining layers were deposited at 0.1 nm s−1. The thickness of each layer was calibrated using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 3) and an ellipsometer (Raditech SE-950). The deposition of the Al electrode through a shadow mask defined an active area of 0.04 cm2 for all devices. The device structure of the OPV devices was ITO/TAPC (10 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Al (120 nm). The device structure of the hole-only device was ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/TAPC (100 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (120 nm). All devices were appropriately encapsulated by using a UV-curable epoxy resin (Everwide EXC345) and a getter-attached glass covering the active area of the devices in a nitrogen-filled glove box (ESI,† Fig. S11). The device layout enabled producing five devices on one substrate to avoid device-to-device variation. A home-made, independently controlled shutter system enabled fabrication of at most four cell parameters without breaking the vacuum to avoid run-to-run variation. Therefore, the OPV devices with various deposition rates of TAPC were simultaneously fabricated in one process, as well as the hole-only devices and TAPC thin films, to minimize the environment-caused variation.
Device characterization
All devices were characterized in an ambient environment. J–V characteristics were determined using a source meter (Keithley 2636A). The photocurrents were measured under illumination using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport 91160A) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A monochromator (Newport 74100) and a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830) chopped at 250 Hz were used to measure the EQE of the OPV devices. An integration of the EQE over the AM 1.5G solar spectrum exhibited an error of less than 3% compared with the experimental JSC. The EL spectra of the devices were recorded using a spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB2000+). AFM images were measured using a Park System XE-70 in a non-contact mode. An NCHR-type non-contact cantilever with a frequency of 320 kHz, a thickness of 4 μm, a length of 125 μm, a width of 30 μm, and a typical tip radius shorter than 10 nm was used. A series of temperature-dependent measurements of the OPV and hole-only devices were performed in a cooled cryostat (Janis VPF-100) equipped with a cryogenic temperature controller (Lake Shore 335). HOMO levels of the organic materials and work functions of the metals were determined using a low-energy photoelectron spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-2). LUMO levels of the organic materials were estimated by subtracting the HOMO levels from the optical band-gap evaluated using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Evolution 220). The C–V characteristics were measured using a precision LCR meter (Agilent 4980A) with a 100 mV ac signal and a frequency of 1 kHz.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a simplified approach for observing the relationship between the CT states and VOC in small-molecule OPV devices. The TAPC/C60 bilayer devices with TAPC deposited at different deposition rates presented a wide variation in VOC, while exhibiting similar JSC and FF. The variation in VOC was determined to be highly related to the CT properties. By directly comparing the experimental EQE and EL spectra, we clearly observed that the CT states changed according to the deposition rates of TAPC. Based on the framework of Marcus theory, the reduced EQE and EL spectra enabled the precise prediction of the CT absorption band and emission without the use of complex techniques and instruments. Controlling the deposition rate of TAPC considerably changed the reorganization energy, whereas the CT energy and the electronic coupling term remained similar. We propose that the electronic coupling term was irrelevant for determining VOC but not JSC. The reorganization energy was the primary factor influencing VOC, which exhibited a higher value when the reorganization energy was reduced. The reduced reorganization energy led to minimal energetic losses in VOC. The improvement in VOC was attributed to the enhanced CT process between TAPC and C60 molecules, which led to a higher EL intensity because of the efficient charge recombination. To determine the change in CT properties, AFM and a series of temperature-dependent measurements were conducted. The AFM images showed a distinct morphology when TAPC was deposited at various deposition rates. This result provides a possible framework of the possibility of molecular stacking in TAPC thin films. When TAPC was deposited at low rates, the TAPC molecules tended to aggregate to form a cluster and increased the distance between each other. The extended distance may hinder the CT process, as suggested by the increased reorganization energy. The temperature-dependent measurements according to SCLC, GDM, and CGDM support our inference regarding the molecular stacking. To relate the improvement in VOC to the diode properties of the OPV devices, the barrier height and built-in potential were calculated in the temperature-dependent experiments and by applying the fits according to a generalized diode equation. The barrier height was increased as the deposition rate of TAPC was increased. A higher barrier may impede the recombination of the minority carriers at the TAPC/C60 interface, thereby reducing the reverse dark saturation current observed in the dark J–V characteristics.
