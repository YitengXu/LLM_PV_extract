    , Accepted 30th June 2015First published on 3rd July 2015AbstractA new D–A conjugated polymer, namely poly[(5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3′,4′′di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (P4TFBT), was designed and synthesized by using mono-fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) as the acceptor and quaterthiophene (4T) as the donor. Two samples of P4TFBT with the same polydispersity index but different molecular weights (low molecular weight: L-P4TFBT; high molecular weight: H-P4TFBT) were obtained. Both L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT showed similar absorption bands from 300 nm to around 800 nm in the visible region, and the close optical band gaps at ca. 1.60 eV. Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the blend of L-P4TFBT or H-P4TFBT with [6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exhibited high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.80% and 7.45%, respectively. H-P4TFBT also revealed a high p-channel organic field-effect transistor mobility of 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1. These encouraging results indicate that P4TFBT is a promising low band gap material with high performance PSCs and OFETs simultaneously.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have been intensively investigated in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, and flexibility.1,2 Currently, donor–acceptor (D–A) alternative copolymerization has been proven to be an efficient strategy to design the copolymers for high performance PSCs and OFETs.3,4
As a strong electron-deficient unit, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) has been extensively used for building high performance copolymers in recent years.5 The introduction of fluorine atoms has been demonstrated to simultaneously lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels as well as suppressing charge recombination.6 Moreover, the size of the fluorine atom is similar to a hydrogen atom, which would not introduce additional steric hindrance, and its strong electronegativity could increase the intra- and inter-molecular interactions through secondary bonds, which would be favorable for the self-assembly and the crystallinity of the polymer.7 In this context, the incorporation of the fluorine atom into the BT unit has become an attractive strategy to modify the properties of the resulting polymers.
Mono-fluorinated BT (5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, FBT) has been successfully incorporated into copolymers for high performance PSCs. Copolymers composed of alternating FBT and various donor units have achieved PCEs over 6%.8 Although FBT-based copolymers have shown promising properties in PSCs, there are few examples that they exhibited high performance in OFETs. Therefore, there is a need for new material systems to exploit the FBT-based copolymers for the PSC and OFET applications.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a new D–A conjugated polymer, namely poly[(5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3′,4′′di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (P4TFBT), by using mono-fluorinated BT (FBT) as the acceptor and quaterthiophene (4T) as the donor. Quaterthiophene-based copolymers usually show high crystallinity with short π-stacking distance that facilitate the hole transporting, and thus the quaterthiophene has been proven to be an efficient donor unit for PSCs and OFETs.9 The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of a conjugated polymer play a key role in achieving high device performance, particularly from the perspective of charge transport and bulk heterojunction microstructures.5b,10,11 To shed light on the influence of molecular weight on the performance of PSCs, we separated and collected two components of the polymer P4TFBT with low and high molecular weights, respectively (denoted as L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT, respectively). We investigated their optical and electrochemical properties, and fabricated their photovoltaic and field-effect transistor devices. L-P4TFBT showed the best PCE of 5.80% with a conventional structure, whereas H-P4TFBT exhibited PCE up to 7.45% under the same conditions. H-P4TFBT also revealed a high field-effect hole mobility of 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1. These encouraging results indicate that P4TFBT is a promising low band gap material with high performance PSCs and OFETs simultaneously.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. The solvents were dried using standard procedures when necessary. 4,4′-Dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene12 and 5-fluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole7a,13 were synthesized according to the literature methods.
Measurements and characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a MERCURY-VX300 spectrometer. Elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen was performed on a Vario EL-III microanalyzer. EI-MS spectra were recorded on a VJ-ZAB-3F-Mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin Elmer Pyris under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The temperature of degradation (Td) was correlated to a 5% weight loss. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2500 recording spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI voltammetric analyzer at room temperature. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. A conventional three-electrode configuration consists of a platinum working electrode with a 2 mm diameter, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl wire reference electrode. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The potentials were determined using ferrocene as the reference. For L-P4TFBT, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out on a Waters 2690 D system using a refractive index detector and THF as the eluent. For H-P4TFBT, GPC was carried out on an Agilent Technologies PL-GPC220 Chromatograph in hot trichlorobenzene solution (150 °C) using an Agilent PL Gel Olexis (300 × 7.5 mm) column with polystyrene calibration standards. The tapping-mode AFM images were obtained by using a scanning probe microscope (Dimension3100V) for OPVs and a Nanoscope V instrument for OFETs.
OFET fabrication and characterization
The OFETs were fabricated in a bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) configuration (gold electrode on Si/SiO2 substrates). The gold source–drain electrodes were prepared by using a photolithography technique to control the channel length (L) and channel width (W = 1400 μm). Before the deposition of polymer semiconductors, octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treatment was performed on the gate dielectrics which were placed in a vacuum oven with OTS to form an OTS self-assembled monolayer. Then the polymer was spin-coated on the OTS modified SiO2/Si substrates from the solutions of hot o-dichlorobenzene (5 mg mL−1) at a speed of 2500 rpm for 60 s. The OFETs were annealed on a hot plate for 5 min in air directly and measured in air by using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System. The mobility of the devices was calculated in the saturation regime. The equation is listed as follows: IDS = (W/2L)Ciμ(VGS − Vth)2, where W/L is the channel width/length, Ci is the insulator capacitance per unit area, μ is the mobility and VGS and Vth are the gate voltage and the threshold voltage, respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried under a nitrogen stream, followed by a UV-ozone treatment. 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO, and then the substrate was baked at 140 °C for 15 min under air. The photoactive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating a solution of the copolymer and PC71BM (w/w) in ODCB on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode at 60 °C. The concentration of the blend solution was 10 mg mL−1. The photoactive layer was then thermally annealed at 140 °C for 15 min. Finally, a layer of 20 nm Ca and 100 nm Al was vacuum evaporated onto the photoactive layer through a shadow mask in a vacuum of ca. 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device is 6 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) measurement of the device was conducted using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter controlled by a computer. And the characterization was carried out in a glove box under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum (100 mW cm−2) with an Oriel So13A solar simulator. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was done by using a Newport quantum efficiency measurement system (ORIEL IQE 200TM) combined with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated by using a standard Si/Ge solar cell. Notably, the IPCE was done under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Hole mobility was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The SCLC is described as  where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential in the device, and L is the active layer thickness. The internal potential V is obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the series resistance of the substrate, from the applied voltage (Vappl), according to V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs.

Magnesium turnings (0.19 g, 8 mmol), a catalytic amount of iodine, and 5 mL of dry THF were mixed in a flame-dried 100 mL flask under argon. A solution of 2-octyldodecyl bromide (3.32 g, 8 mmol) in 15 mL of dry THF was added dropwise into the flask. The solution was refluxed overnight and then cooled down to room temperature.

The mixture was heated to reflux overnight under argon. The mixture was cooled down and then deionized water was added to quench the excess Grignard reagent. The crude product was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a dark oil, which was purified by column chromatography eluting with hexane to give the product as a pale yellow oil (0.42 g, yield: 58%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 6.93 (s, 2H), 6.73 (s 2H), 2.48 (d, J = 2.2 Hz, 4H), 1.59 (m, 2H), 1.25 (m, 64H), 0.87 (t, J = 2.3 Hz 12H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 142.93, 137.46, 125.39, 119.75, 39.01, 35.24, 33.50, 32.20, 30.29, 29.95, 29.64, 26.83, 22.98, 14.42; MS (EI, C48H86S2): calcd, 726.62; found, 726.66.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of the monomer (M1) and copolymer are shown in Scheme 1. Previously, the preparation of M1 involved three steps: the Kumada coupling of 3-bromo-thiophene and 2-decyl-tetradecylmagnesium bromide gave the 3-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophene, then followed a bromination to give 2-bromo-3-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophene, which further underwent a palladium-catalyzed homocoupling to afford M1.14 The synthetic route was tedious and the overall yield was low. Here, we adopted a new synthetic route to prepare M1 with relatively high yield. As shown in Scheme 1, M1 was synthesized in two steps: the Kumada coupling of 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene and 2-decyl-tetradecylmagnesium bromide gave 4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, and then its bromination by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) afforded M1 with overall yield of 52%. M2 was synthesized according to the literature method.7a The copolymer was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling reactions of M1 and M2. The crude polymer was precipitated into methanol and filtered, followed by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene. The two components were collected from the chloroform and chlorobenzene extracts, which correspond to low and high molecular weight copolymers of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT, respectively. The chemical structures of M1, M2, and polymers were verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT are soluble in chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, but not soluble in acetone, hexane or acetonitrile. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and PDI of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The Mn of L-P4TFBT is 10.0 kDa with THF as the eluent, and the Mn of H-P4TFBT is 37.0 kDa with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C. The PDI of both L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT is 1.3. The Mn of H-P4TFBT is close to that of its non-fluorinated counterpart POD2T-DTBT (Mn = 35 kDa, PDI = 1.63) prepared under the same conditions.14a

The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss) of 408 and 431 °C, respectively. The Td of H-P4TFBT is slightly higher than that of the corresponding difluorinated congener (Td = 416 °C).15 The thermal stabilities of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT are good enough for their application in PSCs.

Optical properties

L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT showed similar absorption spectra in both solutions and films with three distinct absorption characteristics (Fig. 2 and Table 2). From solution to film, the absorption spectra of both polymers became broader and red-shifted due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state.16 The two bands in the low energy region of 500–800 nm correspond to the intramolecular charge transfer interaction between the electron-rich and -deficient units, and the bands in the high energy region of 400–500 nm are attributed to the π–π* transition of the polymer backbone. The two well-resolved absorption peaks of the film at the long wavelength implicate a high degree of molecular order within the film.17 The optical band gaps of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT were calculated from the absorption edge of the thin films to be 1.61 and 1.60 eV, respectively, which is close to that of the non-fluorinated analogue (1.59 eV),14a and slightly smaller than that of the di-fluorinated counterpart (1.65 eV).15 The low optical band gap is consistent with those of the other FBT-based polymers.6f,8c,18

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the polymers. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials by assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be −4.8 eV below the vacuum level.19 As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, the HOMO/LUMO levels of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT were determined to be −5.21/−3.42 and −5.23/−3.50 eV, respectively. It was found that P4TFBT with different molecular weights possessed similar values of HOMO levels, but their LUMO levels decreased with increased molecular weight. This observation is in agreement with the results reported by Gong et al.20 The HOMO level of H-P4TFBT is 0.08 eV lower than that of its non-fluorinated counterpart POD2T-DTBT (−5.16 eV).14a

OFET characteristics
To investigate the charge transport properties of H-P4TFBT, the OFETs were fabricated in a bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) configuration (gold electrode on Si/SiO2 substrates). The polymer film was deposited onto octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrates by spin-coating the H-P4TFBT solution in o-dichlorobenzene (5 mg mL−1). The Au drain–source electrodes were subsequently fabricated onto the polymer film by vacuum deposition. Different annealing temperatures and different channel lengths (L) of the OFET devices (L = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μm) were used to optimize the device performance (ESI, Fig. S1†). H-P4TFBT shows typical p-type transport characteristics under ambient conditions. The detailed data are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It was found that the polymer film annealed at 160 °C for 5 min achieved the best device performance. The output and transfer curves of the device are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated saturation hole mobility for H-P4TFBT is 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a high current on/off ratio of 108 and a threshold voltage of around −3 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest hole mobility among the reported mono-fluorinated benzothiadiazole based conjugated polymers. This value of hole mobility is comparable to the electron mobility of PC71BM,21 which is beneficial for the balance of hole and electron transport in BHJ solar cells, and may lead to high fill factor in polymer solar cells.22 In comparison, the hole mobility of H-P4TFBT is a little higher than that of its non-fluorinated counterpart POD2T-DTBT (0.20 cm2 V−1 s−1) and di-fluorinated counterpart PTh4FBT (0.29 cm2 V−1 s−1). Since the morphology plays an important role in device performance, the polymer film of H-P4TFBT was characterized by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Uniform intertwined fiber structures are observed for H-P4TFBT (ESI, Fig. S2†). With film annealing treatments, H-P4TFBT formed interconnected polymer chain networks, which are favorable for the efficient charge transport.23

Photovoltaic performance and film morphology
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the polymers as donor materials, solar cells with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al were fabricated, where the blends of L-P4TFBT or H-P4TFBT and PC71BM (1:1 weight ratio) served as the active layer. The morphology of the active layer was modified by thermal annealing. The typical current density–voltage characteristic of the device is shown in Fig. 5a, and the characterization data are summarized in Table 3. After optimization, the PSCs based on L-P4TFBT:PC71BM showed the best PCE of 5.80% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 12.38 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.62. When high molecular weight H-P4TFBT was used, the photovoltaic performances were significantly improved. The PCE of 7.45% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 15.83 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.65 was achieved. The Voc and FF values of the two polymers are similar. However, a dramatic enhancement in Jsc of H-P4TFBT in comparison with that of L-P4TFBT was observed. Obviously, the higher Jsc of H-P4TFBT over L-P4TFBT should be responsible for the higher PCE of the former over the latter.

To corroborate the measured Jsc results, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured under monochromatic light. The IPCE spectra of the devices are displayed in Fig. 5b. The device with H-P4TFBT showed substantially higher photoresponse than that with L-P4TFBT. Over 50% of IPCE was observed from 400 to 740 nm for H-P4TFBT, which contributed a lot to the high Jsc.
The morphology of the blend films of the polymers and PC71BM was investigated by tapping-mode AFM. As shown in Fig. 6, the two blend films showed similar surface morphologies with small phase separation, and the root-mean-square (RMS) values of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT are 3.61 and 2.29 nm, respectively. However, H-P4TFBT exhibited fine features on the 10–20 nm length scale which would help to facilitate the dissociation of excitons. The RMS roughness of H-P4TFBT indicated good compatibility between H-P4TFBT and PC71BM, which would not cause strong geminate recombination, consequently render a high IPCE and high FF of the device.24

The hole mobilities of the two blend films were measured by the SCLC method with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The hole mobilities of the blend films of L-P4TFBT and H-P4TFBT were 1.87 × 10−4 and 2.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ESI, Fig. S3†), respectively. The higher hole mobility of the H-P4TFBT over L-P4TFBT may be another reason for achieving higher Jsc.
We note that the PCE of 7.45% for H-P4TFBT is higher than that of its non-fluorinated benzothiadiazole counterpart of POD2T-DTBT (6.26%). According to the results from You et al., as fluorine concentration is increased, the bimolecular recombination is likely reduced, leading to improved device performance.6f Interestingly, its difluoro-benzothiadiazole counterpart of PTh4FBT achieved PCEs of 6.41% and 6.82% with conventional and inverted device structures, respectively, which are lower than that of H-P4TFBT. This phenomenon is also seen in other fluorinated benzothiadiazole-based polymers. For example, Yang et al. reported two copolymers of PCDTFBT and PCDT2FBT. The device based on FBT-based polymer of PCDTFBT acquired a PCE of 4.29%, higher than that of the doubly-fluorinated polymer of PCDT2FBT (2.07%).25
We also note that the PCE of 7.45% for H-P4TFBT is one of the highest PCE among the mono-fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) copolymers. For example, Qin et al. reported a structurally tailored copolymer BFS4 through FBT copolymerizing with the BDT unit, and PCE of 7.80% was realized;8a Woo et al. reported a FBT-based copolymer PPDTFBT, achieving a PCE of 6.64%;7a Peng et al. reported a copolymer, PBDT-FBT, which incorporated modified BDT and FBT as donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. The PBDT-FBT-based device achieved a high PCE of 6.21%.8c Neher et al. obtained a high PCE of 6.16% using the FBT-based copolymer F-PCPDTBT.8d
Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a new D–A conjugated polymer by using mono-fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) as the acceptor and quaterthiophene (4T) as the donor, and separated two components with low molecular weight L-P4TFBT and high molecular weight H-P4TFBT. We demonstrated that the molecular weights of the polymers play an important role for PSCs. The PSCs with the L-P4TFBT:PC71BM (1:1) blend film as the active layer showed a best PCE of 5.80%, whereas the H-P4TFBT:PC71BM (1:1) based solar cells exhibited a best PCE of 7.45%. The high OFET mobility of 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1 of H-P4TFBT as well as the good compatibility between H-P4TFBT and PC71BM mainly account for the relatively high Jsc and FF, consequently the high PCE. To the best of our knowledge, the hole mobility and the power conversion efficiency of H-P4TFBT are one of the highest values among the reported mono-fluorinated benzothiadiazole copolymers. These encouraging results indicate that P4TFBT is a promising low band gap material with high performance PSCs and OFETs simultaneously.
