    AbstractHeterogeneous films of ordered CeO2/Ni concentric nanostructures have been fabricated through template-assisted electrodeposition. The free-standing films of Ni metal (8 μm thickness) contain ordered arrays of ceria tubes (200 nm OD, 100 nm ID). Ni/CeO2 coaxial nanotubes were also obtained by tuning experimental conditions. The interfacial contact area within the 3-dimensional oxide nanotube/nickel matrix is ∼100 times greater than 2-dimensional thin films of nickel and ceria of the same area. The use of the film as an anode electrocatalyst/current collector is demonstrated in a solid oxide fuel cell.
1. Introduction
Heterogeneous nanocomposite structures such as coaxial nanowires and nanotubes are of growing interest due to their high energy-conversion efficiencies, fast response times and charge/discharge rates in solar cell,1–3 energy storage4–7 and fuel cell8–11 applications. The superior performance of these heterogeneous composite structures originates from the synergistic combination of multiple functionalities of materials. Such functionalities include very high surface areas, large interfacial contact areas, high electrical conductivities, and short charge diffusion lengths. For example, we recently described a supercapacitor electrode with coaxial nanowires of manganese oxide (MnO2)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) that showed much higher specific capacitance and stronger mechanical strength compared to not only pure MnO2 or PEDOT bulk structures but also the pure nanostructures.12 Similarly, utilizing 3-dimensional nanostructured electrodes in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can theoretically improve the cell performance by dramatically increasing the interfacial contact area between the catalyst, the current collector and the fuel, (i.e. the triple phase boundary TPB). Prinz and coworkers have pioneered the development of 2-dimensional SOFCs with ultrathin electrolytes supported by porous nickel nanohole arrays,13 as well as 3-dimensional micrometre-size SOFC structures9 with up to a 75% increase of current densities compared to flat 2-dimensional SOFCs. We describe here new 3-D composite structures with highly ordered nanotube arrays as free-standing films that were prepared by utilizing template-assisted electrodeposition methods.
Porous anodized aluminium oxide (AAO) membranes have been widely employed to prepare 1- and 3-dimensional nano-architectures. Pioneered by Martin,14 Masuda and Fukuda,15 and others, the investigation of AAO-based template synthesis includes arrays of nanowires/nanotubes,12,16–35 as well as template replicas of various materials such as metals and metal oxides. Specifically, the two-step replication of AAO15,36 advances itself as a generic method to make well-ordered porous membranes of many possible materials, resulting the same high pore density (∼1010 pores cm−2) as the original AAO membranes. With this method, replicated porous films with various materials such as gold,15,37 nickel,13,37–39 titanium oxide,40 tungsten oxide36 and others41 have been fabricated. These porous films have been pursued for use as electrodes/catalysts for photovoltaics, energy storage and fuel cell applications to name a few. While the porous metal oxide membranes are very fragile and not freestanding, (i.e. they are always affixed to a substrate), which limits their direct utilization in fuel cell and solar cell applications, the porous metal films can be strong and freestanding. However, filling the pores of the porous metal films with catalysts requires a separate step, such as sol–gel deposition, which can potentially accumulate catalyst on the metal film surface and block the pores. The use of electrochemical deposition to modify the inner pore walls is also difficult because the electrodeposited materials tend to grow faster on the exposed conductive surface of the porous metal electrode rather than diffusing into the pores.
We describe here a new process involving two sequential steps of electrodeposition to make either highly ordered nanocomposite structures of CeO2 nanotubes embedded in a Ni film or ordered arrays of Ni/CeO2 coaxial nanotubes, depending on the conditions. The nanocomposite films generate relatively robust, free-standing structures containing highly porous, catalytically-active CeO2 nanotubes.
2. Experimental
The ceria cathodic electrodeposition was performed at −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 min. in a solution containing 100 g L−1 cerium nitrate hexahydrate and 10 mL L−1 30% hydrogen peroxide in de-ionized water. The nickel was electroplated at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 40 min. in a solution consisting of 0.65 M nickel sulfamate, 0.12 M nickel chloride and 5.5 M boric acid. Whatman Anodisc AAO templates were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Titanium etchant TFT and gold etchant TFA were purchased from Transene Company, Inc.
The electrodepositions were performed with a 2-channel BiStat from BioLogic Science Instruments. The 700-nm-thick titanium contact layer was sputtered by the AJA sputter system (350 watts, 3 mTorr Ar plasma). The 100-nm-thick gold contact layer was sputtered by Denton Desk sputter system DESK III (50% Setpoint, 50 mTorr Ar plasma, 10 min). Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were taken in a Hitachi SU70 SEM, and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were taken in a JEOL 2100F Field Emission TEM. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis was taken by the INCAx-sight EDS system from Oxford Instruments. Microtomed samples were mounted in Spur epoxy resin and cut with an American Optical ULTRACUT microtome at room temperature.
The two-step electrodeposition method is shown in Fig. 1a. First, a nanoporous AAO membrane (200 nm Whatman anodisc) is coated with a titanium contact layer on one side, which provides electrical contacts and functions as a blocking layer. In the first step, ceria is electrodeposited as nanotubular structures in the pores of AAO from a cerium nitrate/hydrogen peroxide solution at −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The membrane is then soaked in a 1.0 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution to dissolve the alumina template. The radial etching of alumina around the ceria nanotube after deposition in the AAO pore may be due to the somewhat porous nature between grains (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†) of electrodeposited ceria, thus etchant can diffuse through the pores of ceria nanotube wall and dissolve the alumina. As a result, the ceria nanotube arrays remain attached to the titanium contact layer after the complete removal of the AAO. Subsequently, nickel metal is electrodeposited from a nickel sulfamate/nickel chloride/boric acid solution at −1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The growth of nickel replicates the AAO structure and embeds the CeO2 nanotubes (Fig. 1a). The titanium contact layer is then removed using the commercial HF-based etchant TFT (thin film Ti etchant). The resulting film has open-ended CeO2 nanotubes on one side and partially-filled solid CeO2 on the contact layer side. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of the Ni/CeO2 films are shown in Fig. 1b and 1c. The total thickness of the Ni/CeO2 films is ∼8 μm (Fig. 1c), which is defined by the thickness of the Ni matrix. The CeO2 nanotubes are significantly longer than the thickness of the Ni films (Fig. 2) but the excess portions of the ceria nanotubes protruding from the Ni surface are broken during the Ti layer etching process. The CeO2 nanotubes sometimes have irregular shapes, however, the tubes remain open and the irregularities should not significantly affect the functionality or gas diffusion properties.

3. Results and discussion
To investigate the mechanism of CeO2 nanotube/nanowire formation, a brief study of ceria nanotube growth was conducted. For this study, ceria nanotubes were grown in an AAO template with a 100 nm Au contact layer and the same cerium nitrate/hydrogen peroxide precursor solution. For imaging purposes, gold was used as the AAO contact layer in the ceria nanotube study instead of titanium since the titanium etchant dissolves alumina quickly and complicates analysis. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Ce3+ cations are oxidized to cerium dioxide through a hydroxide-mediated process described by the overall electrochemical half-cell reaction:Ce3+ + 2H2O2 + 3e− → CeO2 + 2H2OAfter ceria was deposited, the gold contact layer was removed using a commercial TFA (thin film Au etchant) gold etchant, which exposed the bottom of the ceria nanotubes. As shown in Fig. 2, the CeO2 nanotubes are 200–300 nm in diameter, which are in the same dimensions as the AAO template pores. For reference, the 200 nm Whatman anodisc has ∼200 nm diameter pores on one side of the membrane and ∼400 nm diameter pores on the other side and an average diameter of 300 nm pores in the center. On the Au contact side of the template, the electrodeposition of ceria in the AAO pores initially gives solid CeO2 by filling the pores as shown in Fig. 2b. As the deposition proceeds, ceria deposition forms amorphous CeO2 nanotubes on the AAO walls that becomes polycrystalline after annealing under nitrogen at 500 °C for 1 h. (Fig. 2c and f). Since CeO2 is not electrically conductive at room temperature, more CeO2 is deposited on the bottom of AAO channels closer to the Au electrode, and the wall thickness of the CeO2 nanotubes decreases gradually from bottom to top. The individual tubes are more than 20 μm in length with smooth outer surfaces and rough nanoparticle-packed inner surfaces. The ceria nanoparticles forming the nanotube structures are less than 50 nm in diameter and pack together to form 50 nm thick walls (Fig. 2c). The very top portions of the ceria nanotubes are thin with loosely packed with particles. These thin sections are not structurally sound and break easily during the TEM sample preparation process (sonication in ethanol). As illustrated in Fig. 2d, the individual nanotubes (13 μm) are shorter than the ceria nanotube bundles (23 μm, see the ESI†) that support longer nanotube structures due to added inter-tubular interactions. While the ‘as-prepared’ tubes are essentially amorphous, the annealed tubes are crystalline (see X-Ray diffraction analysis, Fig. S1†). The high-resolution TEM (Fig. 2f) and electron diffraction pattern (see ESI†) show the 3.1 Å lattice spacings associated with the 〈111〉 facet of CeO2.
To obtain CeO2 nanotubes in solid Ni film matrices, it is important to completely remove the AAO in a 21 min NaOH soaking step. Longer soaking times displace the ceria nanotubes and damage the Ti contact layers. With shorter times, residual AAO template structures remain due to partial AAO etching. In this scenario, Ni deposits in the space between the alumina pore wall and ceria nanotube resulting in the formation of coaxial nanotubes of Ni/CeO2 embedded in the residual AAO. Subsequent AAO dissolution gives arrays of alumina-free coaxial Ni/CeO2 nanotubes as shown in Fig. 3a. The thickness of the outer Ni tubes can be controlled by adjusting the time of the AAO dissolution step. Overall, this method allows control over the lateral dimensions of both coaxial components and is a potentially useful approach for preparing multilayer coaxial structures.

Fig. 3a shows the SEM image of Ni/CeO2 coaxial nanotube arrays after removal of the residual AAO support. The microtomed cross-section (Fig. 3b) shows that the coaxial structure persists down the length of the nanotube. The local elemental composition and coaxial architecture are easily distinguished using a 1.5 nm EDS probe in the STEM mode of high resolution TEM. The EDS line-scans and phase maps of the Ni/CeO2 coaxial nanotubes (Fig. 3c and d) show high concentrations of nickel and cerium on the nanotube edges and low concentrations in the center of nanotubes, which are the signatures of a hollow tubular structure. As expected, the nickel tubes grow concentrically on the exterior of the ceria tubes. Due to the partial AAO removal after the CeO2 deposition, the nickel nanotubes are ∼400 nm in diameter whereas the ceria nanotubes retain the ∼300 nm dimensions of AAO template. Occasional defects in the ceria structures allow for Ni deposition inside the ceria nanotubes that results in the formation of short Ni wires (see ESI,† Fig. S3).
The high inner tube surface area coupled with the close proximity of the ceria catalyst and Ni current collector gives rise to large triple phase boundary (TPB) lengths for SOFC applications. Moreover, the ceria nanotubes can perform as both an electrocatalyst and a short-range current collector due to its mixed ionic and electronic conductivity (MIEC). As a proof of principle, we have fabricated an SOFC test cell (Fig. 4) containing the CeO2 nanotube-embedded Ni film as the anode attached to a thick 1.0 mm yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte structural unit. A 50 μm thick lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM)–YSZ porous film cathode was deposited on the opposite side of the YSZ electrolyte (see ESI† for details). Due to the high pore density (∼1010 pores cm−2) of the anode, the TPB area can be up to 30 times larger than that of a two-dimensional anode structure. The total cell current (I) from the SOFC comes both from the porous nickel paste and the nickel–ceria nanocomposite film: I = iNiANi + iNi–ceriaANi–ceria(1)where iNi and iNi–ceria are the current densities from pure nickel paste and pure nickel–ceria nanocomposite portions, respectively, and ANi and ANi–ceria are the areas of nickel paste and nickel-ceria films, respectively. ANi and ANi–ceria were carefully measured before and after running the SOFC. Cell currents (I) were obtained from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. A separate control experiment with a pure nickel paste anode under the exact same conditions gives iNi. Therefore, the only unknown, iNi–ceria, could be extracted from eqn (1). The preliminary LSV displayed in Fig. 4 shows current densities two times higher than those of two-dimensional cells containing Ni pastes or ceria films under the same conditions. While this demonstration shows that the free-standing Ni/CeO2 nanocomposites can be directly incorporated into SOFC structures, the use of thick electrolytes and poor adhesion between the anode and electrolyte give rise to only a small improvement in current density. However, the nanostructured anode not only increases overall TPB length, but also generates a pore structure with a tortuosity of one. Fabrication of micro-SOFCs containing the Ni/CeO2 films with thin (<100 nm) electrolytes are under investigation and will be described elsewhere.

The total cell performance (Ni–CeO2 nanocomposite film + Ni paste anode) is shown in red. The contributions from the Ni paste are shown in green. The contributions from the Ni–CeO2 nanocomposite film are shown in blue. The SOFCs were operated at 785 °C with 67% of dry hydrogen diluted in argon as the fuel and dry air as the oxidant. 
Conclusions
In summary, dense and highly ordered nickel–ceria films were prepared using AAO templating methods. By tuning the AAO template dissolution process, the composite films can be prepared as coaxial nickel–ceria nanotube bundles or as a nickel matrix impregnated with an ordered array of ceria nanotubes. Preliminary linear sweep voltammetry studies showed that the free-standing films can be used in high temperature SOFC applications. Further studies are in progress.
