    , Accepted 5th February 2016First published on 17th February 2016AbstractThe reduction of interface minority carrier recombination is regarded as a key performance indicator in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells. In this study, we chose two kinds of carrier-selective layers to be applied in a hybrid solar cell device. A hole selective transporting layer of N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine (TPD) was added to the interface between Si nanohole structures and PEDOT:PSS, and the electron selective layer cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) was added to the interface between the backside Si wafer and the rear Ti/Ag electrode. The main process used a clean and low-cost solution process, and the annealed temperature was under 140 °C. In addition, after we inserted these two carrier selective layers, the minority carrier lifetime was prolonged from 29.98 μs to 140.81 μs, indicating its significance in reducing the recombination rate. Eventually, we demonstrated that the PCE of Si/organic heterojunction solar cells can be improved to 13.23%.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, the rapid development of modern industries causes environmental pollution, increases the greenhouse effect, and leads to problems due to the scarcity of petroleum on earth. One of the best solutions is using abundant and environmentally friendly solar energy. Presently, a conventional solar cell with an 80% market share rate still uses silicon as its raw material due to its abundant and long-term stability properties. However, since the fabrication process of conventional crystalline-Si p–n junction solar cells needs high-temperature dopant diffusion and annealing steps,1–3 photovoltaics cannot get a leading position in the competitive energy market.
Therefore, a transparent conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) – poly(styrene sulfo-nate) (PEDOT:PSS), which has been used as a hole transporting layer4–7 forming hybrid solar cells simply, has attracted attention gradually, not only because the manufacturing process requires no high temperature and pressure techniques, but also because only low-cost solution processes are needed to form a heterojunction solar cell. As such, many groups have focused on these topics.8–14 Over the past several years, multiple works have mentioned that vertically aligned nanostructures on the Si surface have advantages of low light reflection and high light harvesting,15–18 and can therefore improve the performance of the solar cells. The aforementioned studies show that a nanoscale surface structure is a main catalyst in improving the PCE of organic–inorganic silicon hybrid solar cells.
However, although the rough surface texture increases the absorption of light and the junction area, it also leads to many surface defects and dangling bonds, which will induce the separate exciton recombination. Also, the PCE could only be enhanced to an insufficient 10%. Reducing the carrier recombination rate on the interface is regarded to be another factor in improving the device efficiency. In recent years, several studies have focused on these topics, such as spiro-OMeTAD, TiO2, and Al2O319–22 being used as selective or passivating layers added to the device. L. He et al.19 suggested the addition of an additional hole transporting layer spiro-OMeTAD on the interface between Si nanowires and PEDOT:PSS to improve the PCE to 10.13%. On the other hand, the prevalent rear-side electrode Al or Ti/Ag usually cannot form a perfect Ohmic contact with n-type Si, so Zhang et al.22 offered the idea of inserting an additional layer of 8-hydroxyquinolinolato-lithium (Liq) at the interface of Si and the rear electrode to reduce the Schottky barrier. The PCE of the hybrid solar cell under this structure could reach 12.2%.
Based on these studies, it could be significant to combine two kinds of capable selective layers into one device. Hence, in this work, we inserted a hole selective layer of TPD at the interface between SiNH and PEDOT:PSS. By means of its high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of 2.4 eV, blocking the electrons and highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) close to PEDOT:PSS, holes can be transported to the front electrode favorably. In addition, we added Cs2CO3 to the backside of Si. Because Cs2CO3 possesses good electron injection characteristics, it had been previously widely applied in Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED).23–25 Compared to Liq, which is fabricated by employing thermal evaporation, Cs2CO3 can be deposited using a solution process like the spin coating technique, leading to a more notable significance in the reduction of cost. Ultrathin Cs2CO3 enhanced the conductivity of electrons by forming an effective lower work function with the rear-side electrode.26,27
Both of these two selective layers, TPD and Cs2CO3, were deposited using a solution process. The minority carrier recombination rate can be reduced via interface engineering of an energy offset modification. Eventually, the PCE of the SiNH/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar device after combining the two selective layers reached 13.23% from 10.58%, providing an enhancement ratio of 25%.
2. Experimental
In this paper, we used commercial 6-inch n-type Si wafers purchased from Wafer Works corporation with lattice orientation (100), resistivity 1–10 (Ω cm), and thickness of 675 μm, respectively. First, the wafer was cleaned with deionized (DI) water, acetone, isopropanol (IPA), and piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2) for 10 minutes each. Between each step, the wafer was rinsed with DI water. Afterward, a nitrogen (N2) gun was used to dry it. The main parts of the fabrication are described as follows.
2.1 Si nanohole arrays
Two-step metal-assisted chemical etching was used to fabricate the high-density vertically aligned nanoholes on the Si surface. In this experiment, the backside of the wafers was protected by a spin-coated photoresist. For the fabrication of the nanostructure, firstly, the silicon wafer was dipped in an aqueous solution containing HF (3.71 mol L−1)/AgNO3 (0.004 mol L−1) to deposit silver nanoparticles. Then, the wafer was immersed in another aqueous solution containing HF (6.57 mol L−1) and H2O2 (0.18 mol L−1) for 25 s to form silicon nanoholes by chemical etching.
The reaction formulae for the metal-assisted chemical etching are as follows:282Ag + H2O2 + 2H+ → 2Ag+ + 2H2OAg+ + e−VB → Ag0(s)Si(s) + 2H2O → SiO2 + 4H+ + 4e−VBSiO2(s) + 6HF → H2SiF6 + 2H2O
After etching, acetone, HNO3/DI, and HF/DI were used for the removal of the photoresist, silver ion, and silicon dioxide, respectively.
2.2 Carrier selective layers
For the electron selective layer, Cs2CO3 and polyethylenimine (PEI) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol with concentrations of 0.5 mg mL−1 and 1 mg mL−1, respectively. A solution mixture of Cs2CO3/PEI (v/v = 1:1) was used for the electron selective layer. For the hole selective layer, TPD was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) to prepare solutions with concentrations of 0.3 wt%, 0.6 wt%, and 1.5 wt%, respectively.
2.3 Device fabrication
Device fabrication was divided into two parts. One was accomplished on n-type Si and the other one was done on ITO glass. First, the SiNH structure was fabricated on a cleaned Si wafer. The electron selective layer of Cs2CO3 was spin coated on the backside of Si and annealed in a low-pressure atmosphere for 20 minutes. The annealing was done using an infrared lamp with power 175 W to illuminate our sample through a transparent desiccator, which was connected to a small mechanic pump to evacuate the chamber to 60 torr atmosphere. A practical temperature measurement for the Cs2CO3 layer was 38.6 °C after the illuminating anneal. Subsequently, the rear metal electrode of 50 nm Ti and 250 nm Ag was deposited on the backside of the Cs2CO3 layer by employing E-gun evaporation. The TPD solution was drop cast onto the whole surface of the silicon nanoholes. Before spin coating, we needed to wait 100 s for TPD to infiltrate to the bottom of SiNH, and then TPD was spin coated at a spin rate of 6000 rpm for 60 s. The prepared PEDOT:PSS (PH1000 [Clevios] solution with 5 wt% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) was spin coated onto the top of the TPD layer at a spin rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s, and dried in the shade. For the other part, we chose ITO-coated glass as the front-side electrode. The ITO glass substrates were first cleaned with acetone and isopropanol for 5–10 minutes each and rinsed with DI between those 2 steps. An oxygen plasma treatment was used on the ITO-coated glass to achieve a hydrophilic surface. Later on, another PEDOT:PSS(PHCV4) with a high viscosity of 100–350 mPa s was spin-coated on ITO to form a close contact. A complete solar device was fabricated by the bonding of these two parts, the ITO and the Si wafer, and was annealed under 140 °C for 10 min in an air atmosphere.
2.4 Measurements
The current density–voltage character of the device was determined by a solar simulator, SUN 2000, Abet Technologies, Inc., under 1 sun AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 using Keithley 2400.
The minority carrier lifetime was measured using WTC120 in a quasi-steady-state photoconductance technique, by American Sinton Instruments.
3. Results and discussion
In this study, three methods were proposed for the improvement of solar-device performance. They were the silicon nanohole arrays, and the additions of hole- and electron-selective transporting layers. By two-step metal-assisted chemical etching, we formed a high-density nanohole structure on the Si surface with a depth of 400–500 nm. According to our previous study,12 this high-density array can achieve a light-trapping effect, which is also well adapted for low angle incident light absorption, indicating a significant effect at sunrise or sunset, with low incident-angle light. A hybrid solar device using this array structure can reach a PCE of 10.58%.
Although the nanohole structures reduced the light reflection and increased the heterojunction area of silicon and PEDOT:PSS successfully, the surface area increment, the so-called surface effect, also simultaneously created more dangling bonds, which would induce separate exciton recombination. Based on interface carrier-selective modification reducing recombination, the critical point in this experiment was that we chose TPD and Cs2CO3 as selective layers in the organic–inorganic Si hybrid solar cell.
On the selection of the selective layer materials, besides matching the most important energy level, the practical application of fabrication was another key point that we needed to consider. Many common hole transport layers are p-type conjugated polymers29 such as P3HT (LUMO = 3.2 eV), MEH-PPV (LUMO = 2.9 eV), and PEDOT:PSS. In addition, it is difficult for PEDOT:PSS to penetrate the gaps of the SiNHs. An SEM image of PEDOT:PSS covered on SiNHs is shown in Fig. 1. Here, we added an additional hole-selective transporting layer of TPD, which has a better electron-blocking effect due to its higher LUMO. Its small-molecule properties, with good solubility in chlorobenzene or some other organic solvent, can infiltrate to the bottom of SiNH easily, leading to more advantages in terms of a practical fabrication process, as shown from the TEM image in Fig. 2.

On the other hand, compared to some electron transport layers employing a thermal evaporation method, such as Liq, Alq, or by doping a further heavily doped layer by high-temperature diffusion to enhance conductivity to the anode,22,30,31 the solution-processed Cs2CO3 is a better candidate. In this work, both selective layers were deposited using a spin-coated solution where the layer thickness could be controlled through the spin rate or solution concentration. TPD is a small-molecule material with good hole mobility, and it has a function as an electron-blocking layer because of its higher LUMO with respect to silicon. The band diagram of the solar device with TPD is shown in Fig 3. Here, we set three kinds of conditions, 0.3 wt%, 0.6 wt%, and 1.5 wt%, for the TPD solutions, respectively, to investigate the optimized recipe for device fabrication. A deeper TPD layer thickness would decrease the conductivity, and cause Rs to increase and Voc to decrease. The summarizing table (Table 1) shows that 0.3 wt% TPD could help the PCE improve to 11.39% from 10.58%, which gave it a 7.6% enhancement ratio.

On the other hand, the electron-selective layer Cs2CO3 has been developed widely in the OLED industry due to the strong electron injection. An ultrathin Cs2CO3 layer was added to the interface between the backside of the Si wafer and Ti/Ag. The ultrathin Cs2CO3 layer can form an effective lower-work function with the rear electrode to benefit electron transportation. Also, due to the band bending, it can improve the hole-blocking capability, as shown in Fig. 4.

An annealing step was needed to improve the attachment of Cs2CO3 after spin coating Cs2CO3. Because a native oxide would be formed on the SiNHs if the sample annealed in air, the heterojunction of the SiNH/PEDOT:PSS formed in the latter process would be affected. As shown in Table 2, the device fabricated under these experimental conditions would have a 10 times higher Rs than a normal device, owing to the oxide layer. Also, the following Fig. 5 shows an S-shape illuminated J–V curve, which demonstrated that the character of the diode was deteriorated.

In order to solve this problem, the annealing should be conducted in a low-pressure environment. However, the cost of using conventional vacuum chambers will be high for solar cells, so we adapted a much simpler method for annealing. The experimental conditions and process are provided in detail in the experimental section. After solving the S-shape problem, a PCE of 13.02%, corresponding to Voc = 0.543 V, Jsc = 36.07 mA cm−2, FF = 66.46%, Rs = 2.03 Ω cm2, and Rsh = 1275 Ω cm2 was achieved, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3.

Finally, we combined the two different functional layers into one device. The device structure is shown in Fig. 7. This time, we set the experimental conditions garnered from the best performing device in the previous single selective layer experiment to conduct our new experiment. With the electron-blocking function of TPD and the electron-transporting capability of Cs2CO3, solar devices with better performance were obtained. An excellent PCE of 13.23% was achieved, corresponding to Voc = 0.53 V, Jsc = 37.15 mA cm−2, FF = 67.16%, Rs = 1.37 Ω cm2, and Rsh = 466 Ω cm2. Moreover, after combining two carrier selective layers, the results showed that the PCE can be improved progressively, as shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4.

Furthermore, the minority carrier lifetime played an iconic role in the minority carrier recombination rate analysis. In this paper, the minority-carrier lifetime is defined as a value corresponding to a minority-carrier concentration of 1.00 × 1015 cm−3. In order to prove that adding the selective layer is beneficial for the solar cell, we measured and compared the variation of carrier lifetime under various device structures such as plane-Si, plane-Si/PEDOT:PSS, plane-Si/TPD/PEDOT:PSS, and Cs2CO3/plane Si/TPD/PEDOT:PSS, respectively. Under these various device structures, it is clear that after inserting the selective layer, the lifetime is prolonged, owing to the interface selection modification, as shown in Table 5. We definitely have shown the significance in reduction of the carrier recombination rate at the interface.

Up to now, many important breakthroughs in the development of Si/organic hybrid solar cells have been achieved. Table 6 summarizes the up-to-date reported hybrid solar cells based on a Si substrate and PEDOT:PSS. Compared to other surface structures, the high density silicon nanohole arrays gave a remarkable light-trapping effect. With our solution processable carrier selective layers, not only is the minority carrier recombination reduced, but also a close contact, to decrease resistance, is formed. Moreover, this is expected not to increase the burden in production, giving a competitive PCE of 13.23% and a highest Jsc of 37.15 mA cm−2.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we combined three methods for improving organic–inorganic Si hybrid solar cells. These three methods are the use of silicon nanohole arrays, and the addition of hole- and electron-selective layers into the solar cell. Silicon nanohole arrays perform light-harvesting and possess low-reflection behavior for the hybrid solar cell. The carrier selective layers reduce the minority carrier recombination rate on the interface from 29.98 μs to 140.81 μs via interface engineering of an energy offset modification to further improve the performance. Both selective layers showed assistance in the enhancement of the conversion efficiency. The completed solar device, combining the two selective layers, Cs2CO3 and TPD, with an overall structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TPD/SiNHs-Si/Cs2CO3/Ti/Ag, demonstrated the highest PCE of 13.23%, corresponding to Voc = 0.53 V, Jsc = 37.15 mA cm−2, FF = 67.16%, Rs = 1.37 Ω cm2, and Rsh = 465 Ω cm2, respectively.
