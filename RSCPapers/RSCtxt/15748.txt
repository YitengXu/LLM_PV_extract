    , Accepted 10th June 2019First published on 10th June 2019AbstractA new di(isopropoxy)boryl –B(OiPr)2 tellurophene precursor is described, from which several previously inaccessible phosphorescent borylated tellurophenes are formed via exchange of the –OiPr groups. One such tellurophene Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes, bearing a sterically encumbered mesityl (Mes) substituent at each boron center, exhibits bright yellow-orange phosphorescence in the solid state at room temperature and in the presence of the known quencher O2. Furthermore, Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling between the newly prepared borylated tellurophenes and the test substrate 2-bromothiophene was examined with the pre-catalyst Cl(XPhos)Pd(aminobiphenyl). While more electron deficient boryl groups such as catecholatoboryl (–Bcat) yield significant protodeboronation in place of productive C–C bond formation, efficient formation of the desired thiophene-capped tellurophene thienyl-Te-6-thienyl was noted from tellurophenes bearing the readily accessible pinacolatoboryl (–Bpin) and 1,8-naphthalenediaminatoboryl (–Bdan) functional groups. These findings open the door for the efficient synthesis of aryl tellurophenes and polytellurophenes via the ubiquitous Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of borylated tellurophenes, which was previously hampered by protodeboronation.
Introduction
Borylated compounds represent indispensable building blocks towards a variety of functional materials, ranging from fine chemicals to π-conjugated materials for optoelectronic applications. Most often, these borylated precursors are amenable to Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling, arguably the most popular method for forming C(sp2)–C(sp2) linkages.1 This synthetic method offers many advantages over existing coupling reactions, including high functional group tolerance and water stability.
The electron-accepting ability of the three-coordinate boron centers found within boryl substituents –BR2 also enables their use as colorimetric anion sensors, and as acceptor units within luminescent compounds for OLED and bioimaging applications.2 The introduction of boryl-substituents to thiophenes has also led to an interesting class of fluorescent molecules and polymers, with air- and moisture-stability being a hallmark of these materials.3 A commonly employed route to attach boryl groups onto π-conjugated heterocycles involves iridium-catalyzed C–H functionalization,4–6 while metal-free approaches are now emerging as viable alternatives.7 However, the preparation of borylated congeners of thiophenes, such as the heavy element-containing selenophenes (Se) and tellurophenes (Te), pose additional challenges.8 In particular, the enhanced reactivity of tellurophenes means that pre-existing routes to ring functionalization can lead to competitive oxidation at the electron-rich Te atom or even ring-cleavage in some instances.9–11
Recently, the study of tellurophenes has undergone a renaissance, spurred by their advantageous properties for organic photovoltaics (OPVs),12–20 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),21–25 and in organic field effect transistors (OFETs).15,16,26–31 Of particular note, OPVs featuring a tellurophene-based triplet exciton acceptor unit led to power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.5% (Chart 1), and opens a path to simplified (layered) device architectures.19 Moreover, a few years ago our group uncovered efficient room temperature phosphorescence from a series of 2,5-borylated tellurophenes in the solid state (Chart 1), including the difficult to achieve retention of triplet state-mediated emission in the presence of O2 (a known quencher of phosphorescence).21 Lastly, our group and others have demonstrated the ability of tellurophenes to undergo polymerization via Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, although more often between difficult to prepare halogenated tellurophenes and aryl boronic acids.13,28,32,33 In this regard, stable and synthetically accessible Bpin-functionalized tellurophenes (Bpin = pinacolatoboryl) are promising substrates for cross-coupling, however one potential drawback is their propensity to undergo base-promoted protodeboronation.34
 Chart 1  Tellurophenes developed for photovoltaic (left) and phosphorescence-based (right) applications. 
In this paper we introduce new boryl (–BR2) groups at tellurophenes to yield phosphorescence and reinvestigate ways to suppress protodeboronation during ring functionalization via Suzuki–Miyaura coupling. The new derivatized tellurophenes are obtained via a general boryl group forming protocol starting from reactive –B(OiPr)2 substituents. The resulting products bearing boron-bound catecholato (cat), tert-butyl catecholato (tBucat) and 1,8-napthalenediaminato (dan) groups were previously inaccessible under the same conditions used to synthesize Bpin-functionalized tellurophenes. The products of the successful condensation chemistry were studied by single-crystal X-ray crystallography and where possible, solid state luminescence measurements. Finally, their use in high yielding Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions is also demonstrated.
Results and discussion
Drawing inspiration from prior condensation chemistry involving labile heteroacene-bound boryloxy –B(OR)2 groups and nucleophiles,35–40 we synthesized the reactive precursor (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 using a similar procedure (Scheme 1) as introduced in 2013 for the synthesis of the Bpin analogue pinB-Te-6-Bpin (Chart 1).13,41 Specifically, this procedure involves dilithiatiion of 1,7-octadiyne, followed by addition of B(OiPr)3 and then HCl to yield the moisture-sensitive diyne (iPrO)2BCC(CH2)4CCB(OiPr)2. Zirconocene-mediated diyne cyclization with Negishi's reagent (a source of “ZrCp2” generated in situ from two equivalents of nBuLi and Cp2ZrCl2) in THF,42 followed by Zr/Te element exchange (transmetallation) with the readily available Te(II) source bipy·TeCl2 (bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine) yields the target tellurophene (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 in >80% yield (Scheme 1). While analytically pure product could not be obtained, partially due to the oily nature of this tellurophene, all borylated tellurophenes derived from this precursor were isolated as analytically pure solids. Furthermore, the di(isopropoxy)borylated tellurophene (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 is highly soluble in most organic solvents, making it difficult to isolate from the bipy by-product. Eventually it was found that adding an excess of CuI to the crude mixture leads to insoluble, red-colored CuI–bipy complex(es) that can be effectively removed by filtration in hexanes or pentane.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the di(isopropoxy)lborylated tellurophene precursor (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2. 
Postulating that the absence of a boryl ring chelate in (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 would lead to enhanced reactivity of the –B(OiPr)2 groups, this compound was combined with various potentially chelating nucleophiles, as well as the Grignard reagent MesMgBr. As a benchmarking reaction, (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 was combined with two equivalents of pinacol (Scheme 2), leading to the formation of the well-known phosphorescent tellurophene pinB-Te-6-Bpin13,21,41 which was identified by 1H, 13C{1H}, and 11B{1H} NMR spectroscopy. Addition of the less nucleophilic diol catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) to (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 also led to boryl-substitution to yield the new tellurophene catB-Te-6-Bcat within one hour (Scheme 2). Notably, the pinacolboronate derivative pinB-Te-6-Bpin does not react with catechol under similar conditions, showing a clear increase in reactivity by replacing –Bpin with –B(OiPr)2.
 Scheme 2  Boryl exchange protocol used to access new borylated tellurophenes via the common building block (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2. 
Following a similar convenient procedure, (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 was also reacted with 4-tert-butylcatechol and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene to form tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat and danB-Te-6-Bdan, respectively (Scheme 2); in each case the isolated yield was ca. 50%. It is important to note that these tellurophenes could not be formed via their respective diynes through zirconocene-mediated cyclization/metallacycle transfer.41
Although exchange reactions between (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 and various alcohols and amines proved to be fruitful, we encountered difficulties when extending this methodology to bulky and/or electron-deficient reagents. For example, no reaction was observed between (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 and the common solvent stabilizer 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, nor with the di-imines N,N-dimesityl-1,2-phenylenediamine or N,N-dixylyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, despite allowing the reactions to go at room temperature for 7 days or heating at 50 °C for 36 hours. In the presence of highly Brønsted acidic polyols, such as 2,2′-biphenol, perfluoropinacol [HOC(CF3)2C(CF3)2OH], and 4-tert-butylcalix[4]arene, the only tellurophene containing product isolated was the known protodeboronated species H-Te-6-H (Scheme 2).34 A possible explanation for the observed protodeboronation is that the reaction proceeds as initially expected, however due to the more electron deficient nature of the resulting boryl-groups (e.g. –B(OC(CF3)2)2), protonolysis involving the iPrOH by-product is rendered more facile. We hoped to circumvent iPrOH-mediated decomposition by combining dilithio-2,2′-biphenol with (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2, however no discernible reaction was found.
As alluded to in the introduction, a large number of luminescent thiophenes featuring bulky dimesitylboryl (–BMes2; Mes = 2,4,6-Mes3C6H2) units have been reported with near unity fluorescence quantum yields coupled with moisture-stability and strong electronic communication in the excited state (leading to red-shifting of emission via “push–pull” arrangements).43 In contrast to their fluorescent thiophene counterparts, tellurophenes are known to exhibit long-lifetime phosphorescence due to enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC), and mixing between excited singlet (Sn) and triplet (Tn) states via the heavy atom effect.21,25,44,45 In order to gain access to a new air-stable phosphorescent emitter, we targeted the synthesis of a tellurophene bearing –BMes2 groups at the 2- and 5-positions. Of note, our previous attempts to yield this species via alkyne cyclization/metallacycle transfer from the isolable diyne Mes2BCC(CH2)4CCBMes2 led to no reaction with Negishi's reagent “Cp2Zr”, presumably due to the added combined steric bulk of the two flanking –BMes2 groups.41 While attempted reactions between (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 and MesLi were slow and gave mixtures of products, the addition of two equivalents of MesMgBr gave the new boryl tellurophene Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes in good yield (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, all attempts to form the fully mesityl substituted boryl tellurophene Mes2B-Te-6-BMes2 by adding excess MesMgBr and/or refluxing in THF failed to yield any additional substitution chemistry.
All four newly prepared di(boryl)tellurophenes were also characterized by X-ray crystallography, with the final refined structures presented in Fig. 1–4. The related compounds, catB-Te-6-Bcat and tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat (Fig. 1 and 2) both feature cisoid Te–C–B–O torsion angles of less than 10°, in line with mutually co-planar arrangements of the catecholboronate and tellurophene rings. Prior work with Bpin has shown that when such a coplanar arrangement is present, light absorption (excitation) can involve the vacant p-orbitals at boron.21,25,34 In contrast, danB-Te-6-Bdan (Fig. 3) features planar –B(dan) groups that are rotated by ca. 50° relative to the tellurophene ring. This compound also features hydrogen bonding interactions between the amine protons and oxygen atoms of Et2O solvent molecules (N–H⋯O distances of ca. 2.22 Å and ca. 2.18 Å); removal of the solvent molecules can be accomplished by freeze-drying a sample in benzene for ca. 6 hours under vacuum (0.2 torr). The mesityl-substituted tellurophene Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes (Fig. 4) crystallizes in the highly symmetric Pnna space group. The metrical parameters in this complex are as expected with one notable feature being the nearly orthogonal arrangement of the Mes ring with the plane containing the B–O, B–C(Mes) and B–C(tellurophene) bonds.43

The abovementioned di(boryl)tellurophenes are emissive (green to yellow-orange) when 0.01 to 0.02 M solutions in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran are cooled with liquid nitrogen (77 K) and excited at 365 nm with a hand-held UV lamp (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). In the solid state at room temperature, amorphous samples of catB-Te-6-Bcat and danB-Te-6-Bdan are non-emissive, while tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat shows only very weak yellow emission (λem = 575 nm) with a measured absolute quantum yield (Φ) of 0.2% (Fig. 5). The lifetime of emission (τ) averaged to 22 μs and is in the range typically found for phosphorescent tellurophenes (ca. 1–150 μs).21,25,34 The mesityl-containing tellurophene Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes afforded a much brighter yellow-orange emission in the solid state (λem = 590 nm, Φ = 15.2%, τ(avg.) = 109 μs; Fig. 6). Unlike, tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat, Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes fully retains its emission in the presence of the known triplet quencher, O2.

Previous work has shown that a decrease in phosphorescence quantum yield can occur if close intermolecular Te⋯Te contacts are found in the solid state (i.e. below the sum of the van der Waals radii of 4.2 Å).21,46 The rational is that close contacts facilitate triplet–triplet annihilation, leading to quenching of phosphorescence. Encouragingly, we found that the closest Te⋯Te contact in the solid (crystalline) state was 4.932(1) Å in tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat, while all other tellurophenes show Te⋯Te separations >5.0 Å. Although faint emission was observed for solid state samples of catB-Te-6-Bcat, tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat, and danB-Te-6-Bdan at 77 K (Fig. S3 in the ESI†), only Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes showed bright emission at room temperature. The much brighter emission observed for frozen solutions in MeTHF in place of cold (77 K) pure solid samples for the –Bcat, –BtBucat and –Bdan analogues, suggests that some self quenching might be occurring in the pure bulk phase, where closer contacts in the amorphous solids (vs. in crystals) might enable self-quenching to occur. Nevertheless, the observed luminescence at 77 K (both in solid state and in dilute solution) indicates that the energy requirements for phosphorescence, i.e. close excited state singlet (Sn) and triplet (Tn) energy levels, have been met. The observation of the brightest solid state emission for Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes could be due to favorable solid state packing/morphology effects, since a restriction of molecular motion, a limit of close intermolecular contacts, and a reduction of diffusion of O2 through the solid can all lead to less efficient non-radiative decay (i.e. less quenching of emission). In addition, Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes shows very weak phosphorescence in THF (under N2), which becomes much more intense in the solid state. In line with prior studies,21 this tellurophene shows aggregation-induced (enhanced) emission, wherein restriction of intramolecular motion in the solid/aggregated state suppresses non-radiative decay pathways, leading to enhanced photoluminescence.47
We decided to further explore the excitation process (light absorption) within Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mesvia time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) computations at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ(-PP) level of theory.† As shown in Fig. 7, two intense transitions are predicted with absorption maxima of 315 nm and 362 nm, which are in good agreement with the experimentally derived UV-vis data (λmax = 317 and 378 nm, Fig. 7). The lowest energy transition is attributed to a HOMO to LUMO transition, which is C–C π to C–C π*/B–C π in character with significant contribution from the lone-pair (p-orbital) at the Te center in both the HOMO and LUMO (Fig. 8). The more intense S0 to S4 transition at 317 nm is attributed to a HOMO−1 to LUMO transition, which is also C–C π to C–C π* in character, however only the LUMO has a discernable contribution from the Te atom. It should be stated that one needs substantial orbital participation from the heavy element (Te here) to gain access to enhanced spin–orbit coupling (SOC),25 otherwise phosphorescence becomes less efficient.

In accordance with the observed phosphorescence from Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes, TD-DFT studies also reveal that there are several low-lying singlet excited states (Sn; n < 7) that are energetically close to excited triplet states (ΔEST < 0.10 eV, Fig. 9). Therefore, the observed phosphorescence likely results from photoexcitation to an Sn state, followed by intersystem crossing to a nearby Tn state; finally, non-radiative relaxation to and emission from the T1 state occurs, in line with Kasha's rule.48 Additionally, the phosphorescence energy of Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes was computed by calculating the difference between the zero-point corrected adiabatic energies (E0–0) of the S0 and T1 states at their optimized geometries. The computed value of 2.54 eV (488 nm) is lower in energy than the experimentally observed phosphorescence at 590 nm (2.10 eV) in Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes (Fig. 6).

We also investigated the ability of our new borylated tellurophenes to act as reagents in Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling. Although pinB-Te-6-Bpin has previously been used in Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling to synthesize aryl-functionalized tellurophenes25 as well as low molecular weight copolymers,13 protodeboronation remained a continuous problem, preventing access to high molecular weight polymers. In these prior Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions, common pre-catalysts such as Pd(OAc)2 or Pd2dba3 were used. In 2010, Buchwald and co-workers reported the one-pot synthesis of an active palladium pre-catalyst featuring a 2-aminobiphenyl ligand, Cl(XPhos)Pd(aminobiphenyl), that is activated under mild conditions (40 °C, reaction time ≤2 h, catalyst loading of 2 mol%).49 This pre-catalyst was effective at limiting protodeboronation during the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of furan- and thiophene-containing boronic acids.49 We were curious if this catalytic system was also suitable for electron-rich tellurophene substrates, which are even more prone to protodeboronation.34 We began by examining the coupling of pinB-Te-6-Bpin with two equivalents of 2-bromothiophene using Cl(XPhos)Pd(aminobiphenyl) as the pre-catalyst (Scheme 3). To our delight, the cross-coupling reaction successfully formed the known compound thienyl-Te-6-thienyl, with no detectable amounts of the known protodeboronated tellurophenes H-Te-6-H or pinB-Te-6-H.34 Although slightly elevated temperatures and catalyst loadings were required, this reaction still proceeds under mild conditions (including 7 mol% catalyst loadings at 50 °C for 16 h) giving a very high isolated yield (91%) of thienyl-Te-6-thienyl. In comparison, the use of Pd(OAc)2 or Pd2dba3 as pre-catalysts gave yields lower than 50%.34
 Scheme 3  Improved Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of pinB-Te-6-Bpin with 2-bromothiophene to yield thienyl-Te-6-thienyl. 
Contrary to the coupling results with pinB-Te-6-Bpin, the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with di(boryl)tellurophenes featuring –Bcat or –BtBucat did not produce the di-substituted thienyl product thienyl-Te-6-thienyl in any appreciable quantity when the same cross-coupling procedure as outlined in Scheme 3 was applied. Despite these mild conditions, protodeboronated products were the major tellurium-containing products, along with free catechol or tert-butyl catechol. In addition to the known protodeboronated tellurophene, H-Te-6-H, a new deboronated product was also identified by the presence of a down-field singlet 1H NMR resonance at ca. 8.2 ppm, flanked by diagnostic Te satellites (see Fig. S22†). This peak is tentatively assigned to the mono-substituted by-product thienyl-Te-6-H, which is consistent with accompanying resonances in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum, which show the expected presence of four chemically inequivalent CH2 groups along the cyclohexyl backbone for this product (see Fig. S23†). The presence of the same by-product in the coupling reactions between either catB-Te-6-Bcat and tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat and 2-bromothiophene lends added support for the formation of thienyl-Te-6-H.
Finally, danB-Te-6-Bdan was also reacted with two equivalents of 2-bromothiophene under the conditions outlined in Scheme 3.50 In this case, no protodeboronation was detected and the desired product thienyl-Te-6-thienyl was formed, although not quite as cleanly (ca. 80% in situ yield of the final product) as the coupling reaction with pinB-Te-6-Bpin (see Fig. S22–S25†); after work-up, thienyl-Te-6-thienyl could be isolated in a 43% yield. Overall, the above cross-coupling trials show that Buchwald's reactive Pd pre-catalyst limits protodeboronation within –Bdan and –Bpin capped tellurophenes.
Conclusions
In summary, a new di(isopropoxy)borate-functionalized tellurophene (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 has been synthesized and used to yield new borylated tellurophenes viaiOPr group exchange. This method was employed to synthesize four previously inaccessible tellurophenes: catB-Te-6-Bcat, tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat, danB-Te-6-Bdan and the mesityl-functionalized product Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes. Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes yields bright yellow-orange phosphorescence with a respectable quantum yield of 15% in the solid state and in air, which are both conditions that typically quench phosphorescence. Finally, the performance of borylated tellurophenes in Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling reactions was investigated using the pre-catalyst and Cl(XPhos)Pd(aminobiphenyl), leading to mild reaction conditions and much less protodeboronation when tellurophenes bearing –Bpin and –Bdan groups are used as substrates. Future work will involve using the improved functionalization/cross-coupling strategy described here to gain access to high molecular weight polytellurophenes with small HOMO–LUMO gaps for solar cell applications.
Experimental
General procedures
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all reactions were carried out with standard Schlenk and glovebox (MBraun) techniques using N2 as the inert atmosphere and solvents that were dried using a Grubbs’ type purification system manufactured by Innovative Technology Inc. 1,7-Octadiyne was purchased from GFS Chemicals, Cp2ZrCl2 from Strem Chemicals Inc. and all other commercially available compounds were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; all commercially derived chemicals were used as received. Bipy·TeCl251 and Cl(XPhos)Pd(aminobiphenyl)49 were synthesized according to literature procedures. 1H, 13C{1H}, 11B{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova spectrometer (400, 500, or 700 MHz) and referenced externally to Me4Si (1H and 13C{1H}) or F3B·OEt2 (11B). Melting points were measured with a MelTemp apparatus and are reported without correction. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained on an Agilent 6220 spectrometer and Kratos Analytical MS-50G system. Elemental analyses were performed by the Analytical and Instrumentation Laboratory at the University of Alberta. UV-vis spectroscopic measurements were performed with a Varian Cary 5000 Scan Spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, emission lifetime (τ), and photoluminescence quantum yields (Φ) were obtained using a Horiba PTI QuantaMaster 8075 fluorescence spectrophotometer. For the PL and quantum yield measurements, the spectrophotometer was equipped with a 75 W xenon lamp (and an integrating sphere for the quantum yield measurements). For the recording of emission lifetimes, the spectrophotometer was equipped with a 75 W xenon flash lamp. Solid samples were measured in glass capillaries mounted in a custom-made solids holder. Long-pass and short-pass cut-off filters of λ = 455 nm and λ = 400 nm, respectively, were used in steady-state and quantum yield measurements. All quantum yields are reported as absolute values.

Synthesis of (iPrO)2BCC(CH2)4CCB(OiPr)2. 


n
BuLi (2.5 M solution in hexanes, 14.1 mL, 0.036 mol) was added dropwise to a cold (−78 °C) solution of 1,7-octadiyne (1.872 g, 0.01764 mol) in 350 mL of Et2O. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and then a solution of B(OiPr)3 (6.634 g, 0.03527 mol) in 20 mL of Et2O was added dropwise. The cold bath was then removed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was quenched by cooling to −78 °C and adding a solution of anhydrous HCl (4.0 M solution in dioxane, 13.0 mL, 0.052 mol), followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 h. After allowing the LiCl precipitate to settle, the supernatant was decanted into another Schlenk flask using a filter cannula. The volatiles were then removed from the filtrate under vacuum while heating to 50 °C, to yield (iPrO)2BCC(CH2)4CCB(OiPr)2 as a colorless liquid (5.006 g, 78%) 1H NMR (699.8 MHz, C6D6): δ = 1.18 (d, 3JHH = 6.0 Hz, 12H, OCH(CH3)2), 1.39 (br, 4H, CCCH2CH2), 1.94 (br, 4H, CCCH2CH2), 4.70 (septet, 3JHH = 6.0 Hz, 4H, OCH(CH3)2). 13C{1H} NMR (176.0 MHz, C6D6): δ = 19.1 (CCCH2CH2), 24.7 (OCH(CH3)2), 27.7 (CCCH2CH2), 67.5 (OCH(CH3)2), 103.2 (B–CCCH2CH2). The 13C{1H} resonance for B–CC was not located. 11B{1H} NMR (159.8 MHz, C6D6): δ = 21.5. HR-MS (ESI): m/z calcd for [C20H3611B2O4Na]+: 385.2692; found: 385.2694 (Δ ppm = 0.7).


Synthesis of (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2. 


n
BuLi (2.5 M solution in hexanes, 3.25 mL, 8.1 mmol) was added dropwise to a cold (−78 °C) solution of Cp2ZrCl2 (1.179 g, 4.033 mmol) in 100 mL of THF. The resulting mixture containing “Cp2Zr” (Negishi's reagent)42 was stirred for 1 h and then a solution of (iPrO)2BCC(CH2)4CCB(OiPr)2 (1.391 g, 3.841 mmol) in 20 mL of THF was added. The mixture was stirred for another 30 min at −78 °C and then stirred overnight at room temperature. Bipy·TeCl2 (1.655 g, 4.666 mmol) was added as a solid in one portion under a strong counterflow of N2, and the reaction mixture was left to stir for 1 h. Solid CuI (1.463 g, 7.683 mmol) was then added under a strong counterflow of N2 and the reaction mixture was left to stir for another 1 h. After allowing the insoluble materials to settle, the supernatant was decanted into another Schlenk flask using a filter cannula and the volatiles were removed from the filtrate in vacuo. In order to remove residual Cp2ZrCl2, the crude product was dissolved in 2 mL of pentane and filtered through a 1 cm plug of Celite. Removing the volatiles from the filtrate under vacuum afforded (iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 as a red oil (1.756 g, 93%) in ca. 90% purity according to 1H NMR spectroscopy (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†); this product was used without additional purification for all subsequent reactions. 1H NMR (699.8 MHz, C6D6): δ = 1.17 (d, 3JHH = 6.0 Hz, 12H, OCH(CH3)2), 1.50 (br, 4H, CCCH2CH2), 2.79 (br t, 4H, CCCH2CH2), 4.65 (septet, 3JHH = 6.0 Hz, 4H, OCH(CH3)2). 13C{1H} NMR (176.0 MHz, C6D6): δ = 24.0 (CCCH2CH2), 24.9 (OCH(CH3)2), 33.7 (CCCH2CH2), 66.8 (OCH(CH3)2), 152.6 (Te–CCCH2CH2). The 13C{1H} resonance for B–CC was not located. 11B{1H} NMR (159.8 MHz, C6D6): δ = 29.9. HR-MS (EI): m/z calcd for C20H36O411B2130Te: 492.18619; found: 492.18642 (Δ ppm = 0.5).

(iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 (0.060 g, 0.12 mmol) and pinacol (0.029 g, 0.25 mmol) were combined in 1 mL of THF and stirred for 16 h. After removing the volatiles in vacuo the reaction mixture was dissolved in 0.7 mL of C6D6 and analyzed by 1H, 13C{1H}, and 11B{1H} NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra showed the quantitative conversion to pinB-Te-6-Bpin.13

(iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 (0.507 g, 1.04 mmol), catechol (0.229 g, 2.08 mmol), and 6 mL of Et2O were stirred together in a vial (in a glovebox) for 2 h. Afterward, the mixture was concentrated to volume of ca. 1 mL and the resulting precipitate was allowed to settle. After decanting off the supernatant, the remaining solid was washed 3 more times with 0.3 mL portions of Et2O, each time allowing the precipitate to settle for at least 1 h before decanting off the supernatant. After the residual solvent was removed from the remaining solid under vacuum, catB-Te-6-Bcat was obtained of an off-white solid (0.285 g, 59%).

(iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 (0.233 g, 0.476 mmol), 4-tert-butylcatechol (0.158 g, 0.951 mmol), and 3 mL of Et2O were stirred together in a vial (in a glovebox) for 4 h, after which the mixture was concentrated to final volume of ca. 1 mL. The precipitate was allowed to settle, and then the supernatant was decanted off. The product was washed 3 more times with 0.5 mL portions of Et2O, each time allowing the suspension to settle for at least 1 h before decanting off the supernatant. Further drying of the product under vacuum yielded tBucatB-Te-6-BtBucat as a white solid (143 mg, 52%).

Synthesis of danB-Te-6-Bdan. 

(iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 (0.241 g, 0.493 mmol), 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (0.231 g, 1.46 mmol), and 3 mL of THF were stirred together in a vial (in a glovebox) for 3 h followed by the removal of volatiles under vacuum. The resulting crude product was then exposed to atmospheric conditions, dissolved in ca. 1 mL of a 1:1 solution of CH2Cl2:hexanes, and filtered through a glass frit containing a 10 cm pad of silica. From this filtration, only the yellow fraction was collected, which was then dried over MgSO4, filtered again and evaporated to dryness in vacuo.

Synthesis of Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes. 

(iPrO)2B-Te-6-B(OiPr)2 (0.425 g, 0.898 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of Et2O. MesMgBr (1.74 mL, 1.0 M solution in Et2O, 1.9 mmol) was added and then the reaction mixture was left to stir for 16 h. The volatiles were then removed under vacuum while heating to 50 °C. The remaining product was then dissolved in 15 mL of hexanes and filtered through a 1 cm plug of Celite.

Spectroscopically pure material was obtained by washing the solid with 3 × 0.25 mL portions of pentane to yield Mes(iPrO)B-Te-6-B(OiPr)Mes as a pale yellow solid (105 mg, 19%). Crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were grown by cooling a concentrated pentane solution to −35 °C. 1H NMR (699.8 MHz, C6D6): δ = 1.08 (d, 3JHH = 4.0 Hz, 12H, OCH(CH3)2), 1.48 (br, 4H, CCCH2CH2), 2.17 (s, 6H, MesH), 2.30 (s, 12H, MesH), 2.84 (br, 4H, CCCH2CH2), 4.15 (septet, 3JHH = 6.0 Hz, 2H, OCH(CH3)2), 6.76 (s, 4H, MesH). 13C{1H} NMR (176.0 MHz, C6D6): δ = 21.4 (CH3 Mes), 22.7 (CH3 Mes), 24.1 (CCCH2CH2), 24.7 (OCH(CH3)2), 34.0 (CCCH2CH2), 70.2 (OCH(CH3)2), 127.8 (ArC Mes), 137.6 (ArC Mes), 138.2 (ArC Mes), 160.4 (Te–CCCH2CH2). 13C{1H} resonances for B–C–Te and B–C(Mes) were not located. 11B{1H} NMR (128.3 MHz, C6D6): δ = 44.6.

Improved Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling procedure involving pinB-Te-6-Bpin and 2-bromothiophene to form thienyl-Te-6-thienyl. 

pinB-Te-6-Bpin (50 mg, 0.10 mmol), 2-bromothiophene (35 mg, 0.22 mmol) and the Pd pre-catalyst, Cl(XPhos)Pd(aminobiphenyl) (5.0 mg, 0.0060 mmol) were combined along with 2 mL of THF. To this mixture, 0.30 mL of 2.0 M K3PO4(aq) was added. After stirring at 50 °C for 16 h, the reaction mixture was exposed to air and diluted with 3 mL of CH2Cl2. This crude mixture was dried over MgSO4, gravity filtered and upon removal of volatiles under vacuum and then analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Further purification was performed by running the crude sample through a 5 cm silica plug in 3:1 hexanes:CH2Cl2 which gave thienyl-Te-6-thienyl as a yellow solid (37 mg, 91%) with 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra which matched those found in the literature (see Fig. S24†).21
