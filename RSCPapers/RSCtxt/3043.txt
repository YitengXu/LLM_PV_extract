    , Accepted 30th March 2021First published on 13th April 2021AbstractTransition metal selenides have attracted enormous research attention as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, the low electronic conductivity and dramatic volume variation in electrochemical reaction processes result in rapid capacity fading and poor rate capability. Herein, a metal–organic framework is used as a template to in situ synthesize Sb2Se3 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) grafted on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets. The synergistic effects of N-doped carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets are beneficial for providing good electrical conductivity and maintaining the structural stability of electrode materials, leading to stable cycling performance and superior rate performance. Kinetic analysis suggests that the electrochemical reaction kinetics is dominated by pseudocapacitive contribution. Notably, a high discharge capacity of 451.1 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2.0 A g−1 is delivered after 450 cycles. Even at a high current density of 10.0 A g−1, a discharge capacity of 192.6 mA h g−1 is maintained after 10000 cycles. When coupled with a commercial LiFePO4 cathode, the full batteries show an excellent discharge specific capacity of 534.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing high-performance anodes for Li+ storage.
Introduction
Over the last few years, with the continuous development of industrialization, the consumption of fossil fuels has accelerated, which has caused environmental pollution problems to deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, the production of safe, low-carbon and green renewable clean energy has gradually attracted widespread interest.1–3 However, renewable energy sources, such as biomass energy, solar energy, hydropower and other renewable energy sources, are seriously hindering the energy supply due to low development efficiency and randomness.4,5 The lithium-ion battery (LIB) is one of the most widespread energy storage devices in secondary batteries since it has many benefits, such as high energy density, green environmental protection, light weight, small size and so on.6,7 For LIBs, the anode material is the key factor affecting their performance. However, as a commonly used commercial anode material for LIBs, graphite undergoes a large amount of irreversible capacity loss after the first cycle, and as the theoretical specific capacity of graphite is only 372 mA h g−1, it limits the room for improvement of its electrochemical performance and is unable to fulfill the requirements of future energy storage devices for high energy and high power density. Therefore, exploring high-stability and high-capacity anode materials is of great significance for future development.8,9
To date, many materials have been used as anode materials for LIBs, such as metal oxides, alloy materials, sulfur compounds, carbon-based materials, etc.10–12 Among these materials, metal selenides have been widely studied due to their low chemical reaction potential and high theoretical specific capacity.13 Selenide antimony (Sb2Se3) is one of the major selenium compounds. Since 1 mol of Sb2Se3 can accommodate 12 mol of Li+ during the charging process, it shows a higher theoretical specific capacity (670 mA h g−1).14,15 Nevertheless, due to the insertion and release of Li+ in the charging and discharging cycle, Sb2Se3 electrodes have serious mechanical problems, such as layering and pulverization, leading to a sharp decline in the battery capacity during the cycle, which seriously hinders the practical application of the Sb2Se3 electrode.16 Therefore, in order to overcome the problem of battery capacity attenuation caused by volume expansion, researchers have attempted to design and synthesize Sb2Se3 with different morphologies. For example, Mai et al. synthesized single crystalline Sb2Se3 nanowires through a solvent-mediated microwave synthesis approach. As a result of the unique nanowire structure of the material, the capacity can be maintained at 63.8% after long-term cycling of 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.17 Sun et al. reported a LIB anode material composed of Sb2Se3 nanorods and reduced graphene oxide sheets (Sb2Se3/rGO). Because Sb2Se3/rGO has a good contact interface, it shows a high reversible capacity of 868.30 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1.14 In addition, researchers have explored the construction of novel nanostructures by the assembly of Sb2Se3 with carbon materials. For example, Ma et al. synthesized Sb2Se3@C nanofibers (Sb2Se3@CNFs) by the electrospinning method. The highlight of the material is that the N-doped carbon shell plays a role in reducing the volume expansion and increasing the conductivity of the material. As a result, the corresponding lithium-ion battery shows excellent cycling performance, with a capacity of 625 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1;15 Li et al. successfully synthesized three-dimensional microcubes of Sb2Se3/C which were built with ultrathin nanosheets. Influenced by the unique structural design, it increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte. After 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, its capacity can reach 440.9 mA h g−1.18
Furthermore, because of the high surface energy, metal nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable and easily migrate and coalesce during the reaction process, particularly at high reaction temperatures.19,20 Meanwhile, when metal nanoparticles are exposed to air, the oxidation reaction takes place easily. Thus, we try to encapsulate metal nanoparticles by physical isolation into N-CNTs in order to prevent their migration, agglomeration and oxidation, so as to improve the chemical stability of metal nanoparticles.21,22 For example, Xu et al. succeeded in immobilizing ultrafine Pt nanoparticles in MIL-101 by using a double solvent method in which the Pt nanoparticles were unable to aggregate on the external framework surfaces.23 Other methods, such as the galvanic replacement technique, have also been used to encapsulate nanoparticles (i.e. Sb) into framework structures (i.e. ZIF-67).
Based on the above considerations, the synthesis of a novel nano-composite material (Sb2Se3@NC-rGO) using a metal–organic framework as a template is reported in this study, which is used as an anode material for LIBs. The fabrication strategy mainly consists of self-assembly followed by solvothermal treatment and selenization reaction. The excellent electrochemical properties of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO result from its rational nanostructure design. N-CNTs and rGO nanosheets can prevent agglomeration of Sb2Se3 nanoparticles during cycling leading to stable cycling performance. In addition, N-CNTs grown directly on the surface of rGO nanosheets can improve the transport efficiency of Li+ and electrons, which can enhance the electrochemical reaction kinetics. When Sb2Se3@NC-rGO was used as an anode for LIBs, the high discharge capacity remained at 451.1 mA h g−1 after 450 cycles at 2.0 A g−1. It is worth noting that even after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 10.0 A g−1, the specific discharge capacity can still be maintained at 192.6 mA h g−1. In addition, the material exhibits excellent full cell performance. When LiFePO4 is used as a cathode, a discharge specific capacity of 534.5 mA h g−1 can be obtained at 0.2 A g−1.
Experimental
Synthesis of Ni@NC-rGO
The approach of synthesizing Ni@NC-rGO was adapted from a previous method with modification.24 112.6 mg of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O was dissolved in 20 mL of DIW–ethanol (v/v = 1:1) mixture. Then, 5 mL of cyanamide was added to the above mixture. After stirring at 80 °C for 1 hour, a light blue solution was formed. After cooling to room temperature, 50 mg of graphene oxide was added to the above mixture and stirred for 24 hours. Then, the product was dried in a vacuum and ground into a powder. Lastly, the product was calcined at 450 °C for 2 hours followed by 700 °C for another 2 hours with a temperature programming rate of 5 °C min−1 under argon.
Synthesis of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO
Firstly, 750 mg of SbCl3 was dissolved in 30 mL of ethylene glycol via ultrasonication. Then, 70 mg of Ni@NC-rGO was dispersed in the above mixture and ultrasonicated for 45 min. Subsequently, the above mixture was moved to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated to 200 °C for 12 hours. Then, the product was collected by centrifugation, and washed with a DIW–ethanol mixture and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 hours. Lastly, the dried black product was mixed with selenium powder and calcined at 500 °C for 3 hours with a temperature programming rate of 5 °C min−1 under argon.
Synthesis of Sb2Se3/rGO
Firstly, 197.10 mg of Sb2O3 was dispersed in 30 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication. Then, 200 mg of graphene oxide was added to the above mixture and stirred for 24 hours. Afterwards, the product was dried in a vacuum and ground into a powder. Lastly, the dried product was mixed with selenium powder and calcined at 500 °C for 3 hours with a temperature programming rate of 5 °C min−1 under argon.
Material characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM Hitachi, S-4700), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TecnaiG220, FEI) and high-resolution TEM (Tecani G2 F20 S-TWIN) were used to characterize the morphologies. X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert-Pro MPD diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation of 1.540598 Å) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab250Xi) were used to determine the composition and structure. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M) methods were used to analyse the pore diameter distribution and specific surface area.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of the material was analysed using a coin-type half-cell (CR 2016). Lithium foil was used as the reference electrode, and the active material (Sb2Se3@NC-rGO)–acetylene black–polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (mass ratio: 7:2:1) mixture was used as the working electrode. For the lithium-ion full battery, Sb2Se3@NC-rGO was used as the anode material. LiFePO4 served as the cathode material. The LiPF6 (1 M)–ethylene carbonate (EC, 50 vol%)–diethyl carbonate (DEC, 50 vol%) mixture was used as the electrolyte. A Celgard 2400 membrane was employed as a separator. The cells were assembled in a glove compartment under an argon atmosphere. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was performed with a LAND CT2001 test system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a CS350 electrochemical workstation.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the fabrication steps of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO. In our case, the metal nickel was used as a catalyst for the growth of carbon nanotubes. Firstly, the nickel precursor (i.e. Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) reacted with cyanamide to form the cyanamide–Ni complex. Subsequently, a carbon source (GO solution) was added to obtain the precursor (Ni-MOF/GO) (SEM/TEM images shown in Fig. S1†). Then, Ni-MOF/GO underwent catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) under argon to form Ni@NC-rGO.25 In the CCVD process, nickel ions in Ni-MOF/GO are firstly reduced to metallic nickel particles, and defects in graphene sheets may be the nucleation sites during the formation of metallic nickel particles.26,27 At the same time, the precursor is thermolyzed to form a large number of nitrogen-doped carbon surrounding the metal nickel particles.28,29 Due to the large size of the metal nickel particles (≥5 nm), the metal nickel particles catalyzed the formation of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Ni@NC-rGO) with typical bamboo-like morphology according to the mechanism of “tip-growth”.25,30 The SEM/TEM images and XRD patterns of the resultant Ni@NC-rGO composite are shown in Fig. S2 and S3,† respectively. To embed Sb nanoparticles into N-CNTs, the Sb precursor (i.e. SbCl3) is added into the ethylene glycol solvent together with the Ni@NC-rGO composite via solvothermal treatment. During the reaction, the Ni atom undergoes substitutional replacement by the Sb atom to produce the SbOCl@NC-rGO composite. The SEM/TEM images and XRD (The corresponding standard card is JCPDS No. 01-0693) patterns of SbOCl@NC-rGO composites are shown in Fig. S4 and Fig. S5,† respectively. Lastly, the SbOCl@NC-rGO composite undergoes a selenization process to form Sb2Se3@NC-rGO.

Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the synthesized Sb2Se3@NC-rGO composite. The diffraction pattern shows several signature peaks of Sb2Se3 (JCPDS no. 15-0861) at 15.03°, 16.9°, 21.45°, 23.9°, 27.39°, 28.2°, 31.16°, 32.22°, 34.08°, 35.70°, 38.8°, 41.3°, 44.95°, 45.57°, 51.04°, 51.88°, 57.56°, 58.11° and 59.85°, which correspond to the (0 2 0), (1 2 0), (2 2 0), (1 3 0), (2 3 0), (2 1 1), (2 2 1), (3 0 1), (2 4 0), (3 2 1), (1 4 1), (2 5 0), (4 3 1), (0 0 2), (5 3 1), (0 6 1), (7 2 0), (2 4 2) and (3 7 0) planes, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectra of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO and Sb2Se3/rGO. As is known to all, the G-band illustrates the in-plane tensile vibration of the carbon atoms when evaluating the graphitization degree, while the D-band is closely related to the breathing vibration of the carbon atoms, and describes the defects of carbon-related materials.31,32 The ID/IG ratios of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO and Sb2Se3/rGO are about 1.15 and 1.09, respectively, which indicate the presence of amorphous carbon. At the same time, the ID/IG ratio of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO is higher than that of Sb2Se3/rGO, suggesting that the doping of N in Sb2Se3@NC-rGO is beneficial for increasing the vacancies and defects, which may boost the amount of lithium storage.33 The specific surface area and pore size distributions of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO obtained using BET and BJH methods are shown in Fig. 1c. Sb2Se3@NC-rGO possesses a surface area of 6.13 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 18.76 nm. The larger pore size in Sb2Se3@NC-rGO is favorable for lithium-ion storage as this feature offers multiple active sites for electrochemical reactions.15,30

The structural feature of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO composite was monitored via SEM, TEM and HRTEM. From the SEM images shown in Fig. 2a–c, it is clearly observed that the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO composite retains the pristine N-CNT structure. These images show that the N-CNTs are about one micron in length and they are attached to the surface of the wrinkled rGO nanosheets. The TEM images (Fig. 2d and e) further show that the Sb2Se3 nanoparticles are encapsulated in N-CNTs with a diameter of about 15–25 nm. This implies that due to Sb2Se3 encapsulation in N-CNTs, oxidation and agglomeration can be avoided and the volume expansion of metals can be buffered during the lithiation process. Notably, N-CNTs with bamboo-like architecture can also be seen from these microscopy images and their nanostructure is well aligned with the morphological characteristics of N-doped CNTs, as reported in the previous study.24Fig. 2f shows the HRTEM image of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO. As shown in Fig. 2f, Sb2Se3 particles were successfully encapsulated in N-CNTs. The HRTEM image (Fig. S7†) of the partial enlargement (red circled area in Fig. 2f) reveals fine crystalline lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.316 nm which correspond to the (211) planes of Sb2Se3 and a d-spacing value of 0.34 nm which is attributed to the (002) plane of NC.34,35 The SAED pattern of the material shows several clear rings composed of discrete points (Fig. S8†). These rings can be indexed to Sb2Se3, which is consistent with the XRD results of Fig. 1a. The EDS mapping images (Fig. 2g) show that the C, N, Se and Sb elements are well distributed in the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO composite. The SEM/TEM images and XRD (The corresponding standard card is JCPDS No. 65-1317) patterns of resultant Sb2Se3/rGO composite are shown in Fig. S6.† It can be seen from Fig. S6† that Sb2Se3 has a simple lamellar structure, and lacks N-CNTs compared to Sb2Se3@NC-rGO.

The valence state and surface compositions of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO were analyzed by XPS measurements. In the survey spectrum (Fig. S9†), the five elements C, N, O, Sb and Se were analyzed in the sample, which further confirms the presence of Sb2Se3. Fig. 3a shows the C 1s spectrum of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO. Three characteristic peaks at 284.01 eV, 284.80 eV and 286.62 eV correspond to the CC, C–N and CO bonds, respectively.31,36 The N 1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows two kinds of N: pyridinic N (398.18 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.39 eV).15,37 It is well known that pyridinic N can improve the defect degree of carbon materials and provide more active sites for Li+ adsorption. This result agrees with the Raman results. Fig. 3c shows the Sb 3d XPS spectrum. The two peaks at 528.45 eV and 529.74 eV correspond to Sb 3d5/2 for Sb III and V, respectively. In addition, the two peaks at 537.82 eV and 539.13 eV are attributed to Sb 3d3/2.18,38 The peak at 531.64 eV can be indexed to O 1s, indicating that a small part of Sb attached to the rGO nanosheets was oxidized. As for the Se 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d), the two peaks at 53.74 eV and 55.32 eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 of Sb2Se3, respectively. Furthermore, the peak at 52.8 eV is attributed to the Se–O bond, which may be caused by the partial oxidation of Se.14,18,39

To investigate the storage behaviour of Li+ in Sb2Se3@NC-rGO, galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests and CV were employed. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO at 0.1 mV s−1 in a voltage range of 0.01 V–3.0 V. In the first cathodic sweep, the reduction peaks at about 2.0 V, 1.69 V and 1.52 V are attributed to the gradual embedding of Li+ into Sb2Se3 to form Li6Sb2Se3 (intercalation reaction).14,40,41 A reduction peak at 1.37 V was associated with the conversion reaction of Li6Sb2Se3, along with the formation of Sb and Li2Se (conversion reaction).15,40 The last peak at 0.78 V was ascribed to the alloying reactions between Li+ and Sb (alloying reaction).15,17 Additionally, during the first anodic scan, a sharp oxidation peak at 1.08 V indicated the dealloying reaction from Li3Sb to Sb (dealloying reaction).17 An oxidation peak located at around 1.39 V signified a reversed conversion reaction of Sb and Li2Se into Li6Sb2Se3 (deconversion reaction).40 The three oxidation peaks at about 1.83 V, 1.96 V and 2.2 V were attributed to a deintercalation reaction of the formation of Sb2Se3 from Li6Sb2Se3 (deintercalation reaction).14,15 The electrochemical reactions between Sb2Se3@NC-rGo and lithium can be expressed as follows:
Intercalation reaction: Sb2Se3 + 6Li+ + 6e− → Li6Sb2Se3(1)
Conversion reaction: Li6Sb2Se3 → 2Sb + 3Li2Se(2)
Alloying reaction: 2Sb + 6Li+ + 6e− → 2Li3Sb(3)
Dealloying reaction: 2Li3Sb → 2Sb + 6Li+ + 6e−(4)
Deconversion reaction: 2Sb + 3Li2Se→ Li6Sb2Se3(5)
Deintercalation reaction: Li6Sb2Se3 → Sb2Se3 + 6Li+ + 6e−(6)

In the following cycles, the CV curves can overlap with each other, indicating that the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode has high stability and reversibility.42 The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th cycles of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO anodes at 0.2 mA h g−1 are shown in Fig. 4b. The first discharge and charge capacities are 2028.2 mA h g−1 and 1190.7 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding Coulombic efficiency (CE) is 58.71%. Due to the electrolyte decomposition and the irreversible formation of the SEI film, the specific capacity of the first cycle decreased sharply. It is worth noting that due to the decrease of electrochemical impedance after the stable formation of the SEI film, the CE continued to increase to 93.98% in the 2nd to 5th cycles.43 Meanwhile, in subsequent cycles, the shape of the curve remains constant with relatively good overlapping, indicating that the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode has excellent electrochemical reversibility.44 The electrochemical kinetics of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO was analyzed by EIS in a frequency range of 0.01 mHz to 100 kHz (Fig. 4c). The depressed semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer impedance and capacitance (Rct) in the high frequency region and the inclined straight line stands for the Warburg impedance (Zw) located at the low frequency region.30,45 Obviously, the diameter of the semicircle of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO is smaller than that of Sb2Se3/rGO. This indicates that Sb2Se3@NC-rGO possesses a smaller Rct value, and thereby leads to the faster charge transfer process. Also, the steeper slope of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO indicates a smaller diffusion resistance of Li+ in the electrode materials.46 The superior electrochemical kinetics of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO can be attributed to its highly conductive nature of the N doping CNT–rGO hybrid and interconnected framework, which help to boost the electron transfer rate.47Fig. 4d shows the rate performance of Sb2Se3/rGO and Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrodes. Sb2Se3@NC-rGO displays an outstanding rate performance at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, and the reversible discharge capacities are 1408, 1145, 1017, 877, 676 and 494 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity can still reach approximately 1330 mA h g−1, when the current density switches back to 0.2 A g−1, which suggests its good electrochemical reversibility. As a comparison, the discharge capacity of Sb2Se3/rGO under various current densities is lower than that of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO. In order to confirm the excellent electrochemical properties, the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode was cycled at 2.0 A g−1. After 450 cycles, the capacity was stabilized at about 451.1 mA h g−1, and CE remained at approximately 100% (Fig. 4e). The capacity increases continuously indicating possible activation which is common for various nanostructured metal oxide or metal sulfide electrodes. This phenomenon is due to the reversible formation and decomposition of an organic polymeric gel-like film ascribed to kinetically activated electrolyte degradation, which could provide interfacial storage for excess lithium ions.30,48Fig. 4f shows the long-term cycling properties of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO that was also cycled at 10.0 A g−1. The Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode delivered a high discharge capacity of around 192.6 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles, and the CE was about 100%. These results show that Sb2Se3@NC-rGO has a good application prospect as a LIB anode. The SEM/TEM images of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode after 100 cycles are shown in Fig. S10.† It is obvious that the N-CNTs encapsulated with Sb2Se3 nanoparticles are still attached to the wrinkled rGO nanosheets, and the morphology is nearly unchanged, indicating that the structure of the material is highly stable.

Fig. 5a shows the CV profiles of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode at various scan rates. It is well known that the storage mechanism can be estimated according to the equation i = avb between the current and the scan rate, where i and v are the peak current and the potential scanning rate, respectively. Moreover, a and b are empirical values. In general, b = 0.5 represents the diffusion-controlled charge storage process, while b = 1.0 represents the characteristics of the capacitive charge storage process.49 The b values of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode at peaks 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 0.7356, 0.7308, 0.7585 and 0.6821, respectively (Fig. 5b). In order to explore the pseudocapacitive contribution to total capacity at different scanning rates, the equation i = k1v + k2v0.5 is used for calculation, where k2v0.5 represents the diffusion control contribution, and k1v represents the capacitance effect.50 As shown in Fig. 5c, with the increase of the scan rate, the capacitive contribution of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode increased from 53.30% to 77.34%, while the contribution related to diffusion-limited intercalation decreases. Fig. 5d shows that the pseudocapacitance at 1.0 mV s−1 is 66.83%. Consequently, the reason for the high pseudocapacitive contribution ratio is that the synergistic effect of rGO nanosheets and N-CNTs has a great positive role in improving the electronic/Li+ conductivity and structural stability, which provides superior lithium storage performance.51

(c) Normalized capacity contribution ratio at various scan rates. (d) Pseudocapacitive (orange) contribution of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO at 1.0 mV s−1. 
Moreover, in order to confirm the feasibility of using Sb2Se3@NC-rGO in energy storage devices, we used Sb2Se3@NC-rGO as an anode and LiFePO4 as a cathode to fabricate a lithium ion full battery. The SEM/TEM images of LiFePO4 are shown in Fig. S11.† In addition, Fig. S12† shows the charge–discharge curve and rate properties of the LiFePO4 cathode. Fig. 6a and b show the rate properties of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO//LiFePO4 full batteries. The full batteries display high charge and discharge capacities of 376.2, 317.5, 284.7, 259.5, 242.1 and 226.7 mA h g−1 at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 A g−1, respectively. The Ragone plots show the energy and power densities of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO//LiFePO4 full cell at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 A g−1 (Fig. S13†). As shown in Fig. S13,† the power density of the full cells can deliver a high energy density of 88.89 W h kg−1 at 1142.55 W kg−1. They still maintain 47.26 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 6059.4 W kg−1, which exceeds those of many reported lithium-ion batteries.52–56Fig. 6c shows the charge and discharge curves of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO//LiFePO4 full cell at 0.2 A g−1. Obviously, the good overlap of the charge and discharge curves indicates that the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO//LiFePO4 full cell has good cycling stability. Fig. 6d shows that the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO//LiFePO4 full cell has a good cycling performance and a high discharge capacity of 534.5 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, and an almost ∼100% CE. The cycling process shows that the specific capacity decreases gradually in the first 12 cycles, increases slowly from the 13th to 50th cycle, and then decreases continuously. The obvious capacity fading in the initial cycles is a result of many complicated side-reactions and the irreversible insertion of Li+ into the composites and the irreversible transformation of the material structure as well as the formation of the SEI.57–60 The increase of capacity from the 13th to 50th cycle indicates possible activation, which is common for various nanostructured metal oxide or metal sulfide electrodes. This phenomenon is due to the reversible formation and decomposition of an organic polymeric gel-like film due to kinetically activated electrolyte degradation, which could provide interfacial storage for excess lithium ions.30,48,57 Subsequently, the decrease of specific capacity may be due to the decrease of recyclable lithium because of the deposition of lithium ions in the process of charge and discharge. In addition, it is also possible that the electrochemical impedance increases due to the decomposition of the electrolyte on the electrode surface to produce alkyl lithium carbonate and lithium carbonate, resulting in the loss of capacity of the battery.

The superior electrochemical performances of the Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode are attributed to the following reasons: (1) synergistic effects of N-CNTs and rGO. The porous tubular structure of N-CNTs provides a conductive way for the rapid transport of lithium ions, which greatly shortens the diffusion distance of Li+, while the rGO nanosheets act as a highly conductive material, which greatly improves the transmission speed of electrons. Moreover, the adjustable surface chemical properties of rGO can provide sufficient immobilization sites for chemical interaction with lithium ions, thus improving the capacity and cycling stability of LIBs. (2) N-doping in CNTs. N-Doped carbon, such as pyridinic N, can improve the electronic structure of the materials and also provide numerous active sites for chemical adsorption of Li+. (3) The high flexibility of rGO nanosheets and N-CNTs can provide a buffer for the volume expansion of active materials during the insertion and extraction of Li+. In addition, the Se matrix can also effectively alleviate the volume expansion of the electrode. (4) Sb2Se3 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-CNTs can effectively avoid agglomeration, migration and oxidation of nanoparticles. In view of its excellent performance and unique and simple synthesis method, the material has a broad application prospect in the field of lithium batteries.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have rationally designed a novel anode material that comprises Sb2Se3 nanoparticles embedded in the N-doped CNT/rGO hybrid (denoted as Sb2Se3@NC-rGO) for high-performance LIBs. The Sb2Se3@NC-rGO electrode shows a remarkable electrochemical performance of 451.1 mA h g−1 after 450 cycles at 2.0 A g−1 and 192.6 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at 10.0 A g−1. It also shows excellent performance in lithium-ion full cells. The specific discharge capacity of a full battery of Sb2Se3@NC-rGO//LiFePO4 can reach 534.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. This work will be helpful for providing an effective synthesis strategy for the development of anodes for the next generation of high performance lithium-ion cells.
