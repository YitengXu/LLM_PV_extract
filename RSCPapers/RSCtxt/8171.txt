    , Accepted 13th July 2015First published on 16th July 2015AbstractThree alkyl-thiophene π-bridged polymers, PDTS-hDTFBT (P-hF), PDTS-hDTDFBT (P-hDF) and PDTS-ehDTDFBT (P-ehDF), with different number of F atoms and side chain substituents are synthesized through a palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF show a narrow band gap of 1.56, 1.56 and 1.60 eV with deep lying highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of −5.17, −5.21 and −5.35 eV, respectively. The optimized P-hDF-based photovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage of 0.593 V, a short-circuit current density of 15.98 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 64.8% and a high energy conversion efficiency of 6.14%, which is partially ascribed to the deep HOMO energy level and good coplanarity. The performance is among the highest reported ones in devices based on polymers with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) as the electron-rich unit and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) derivatives as the electron-deficient unit.
Introduction
Harvesting energy directly from sunlight using photovoltaic technology is considered as one of the most important ways to address growing global energy needs using a renewable resource.1 Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable interest from both the academic and industrial communities over the past decade due to advantages such as easy processability over a large-area size via printing or roll-to-roll technologies, low-cost manufacturing, and compatibility with flexible substrates.1–7 Three key parameters that determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell are open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). PCE is equal to the product of these three parameters divided by the input power.2,8,9 Despite the many advantages of PSCs, a low PCE is still a major impediment to real commercialization.10,11 Although remarkable progress has been achieved by optimization of the device architectures and developing ideal photovoltaic polymers over the past decade, which led to a higher than 10% PCE,12–14 further improvements are needed for mass production and practical applications. The most successful strategy to improve the PCE is to develop new low band gap donor materials15,16 to enlarge overlap with the solar spectrum in the infrared region and ensure efficient harvesting of solar photons, which could improve JSC.
A variety of low band gap conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized by scientists during the past few decades. One representative polymer is poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBT). The PSCs based on PCPDTBT:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) showed a moderate PCE of 5.5%,17 which is mainly limited by the low FF and VOC. There are two main strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance of PCPDTBT. The first one is the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atom(s) to the electron-deficient unit of the polymer. F-containing PCPDTBTs (PCPDTFBT and PCPDTDFBT) have been reported by several groups.18–22 Their encouraging results showed that the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels could be lowered by introducing fluorine atom(s) to the electron-deficient unit, as a result, VOC was increased. However, the solubility has been reduced18,20,21 due to the enhanced F–H, F–F interactions and strong stacking23 of polymers; especially for the PCPDTDFBT, the PCE decreased to 3.37%.21 4-Hexylthiophene had been introduced to PCPDTDFBT as a π-bridge to improve the solubility in our previous work, and the PCE increased from 3.37% to 5.85%.24 The other method is the replacement of the carbon atom at the 4-position of cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene by a silicon atom. The properties of Si-PCPDTBT, named poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PDTSBT), have been studied by several groups,25–28 their results showed that the silicon atom fusion enhances solid-state ordering compared to the carbon-fused analogue, resulting in improved charge transport, which is favorable to obtain a higher JSC value.29 Y. Yang indicated that the long Si–C bonds displaced the solubilizing side chains further from the thiophene rings, allowing a stronger π-stacking interaction to occur, which was the possible reason for the improved charge transport.28 However, the solubility of the strong stacking Si-bridged polymers decreased in common organic solvents.27
In this work, in order to obtain a deeper HOMO and a higher JSC, the two strategies were combined, an F atom was introduced to the electron-deficient unit and the carbon bridge was substituted by a silicon atom simultaneously. 4-Hexylthiophene is employed as a π-bridge to improve the solubility similar to our previous work.24 The structures of the resulting polymers, PDTS-hDTFBT (here referred to as P-hF) and PDTS-hDTDFBT (here referred to as P-hDF), are shown in Fig. 1. Previous studies have demonstrated that conformational twisting of the main chain of a polymer is an effective method to lower the HOMO energy level.30–32 Thus, to further improve the VOC, the steric group 2-ethylhexyl was introduced to the thiophene π-bridge, the third polymer was named PDTS-ehDTDFBT (here referred to as P-ehDF). The thermal stability, and photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were carefully investigated. The P-hDF/PC71BM based PSC gave a promising PCE of 6.14% with a JSC of 15.98 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.593 V and an FF of 64.8%. The P-ehDF/PC71BM based PSC showed a higher VOC of 0.805 V as expected.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Three polymers were synthesized in good yield (76–83%) by Stille coupling polymerization, using a Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 catalytic system. The polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and CHCl3 in succession. CHCl3 fractions were collected, concentrated, reprecipitated in methanol, and dried under vacuum overnight to offer the target polymers. All polymers show excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and dichlorobenzene (DCB). The polymers can even partially dissolve in dichloromethane. The good solubility could be attributed to the alkylthiophene π-bridge. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with calibration against polystyrene standards and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF were found to be 15.4, 16.2 and 12.8 kg mol−1, with PDIs of 1.86, 1.74 and 2.19, respectively. The crystallinity of the polymer films was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. S1†). There are no peaks observed for the polymers, indicating their amorphous nature.33 The thermal stability of the polymers was explored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. S2.† The three polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to a 5% weight loss at 431 °C, 424 °C and 432 °C, respectively. DSC plots reveal that there is no obvious glass transition for the polymers before 420 °C. Obviously, the thermal stability of the polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs devices.
Computational study
The conformational analysis as well as calculations of energies and distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of these polymers were performed by density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase.34 The optimized molecular geometries were confirmed to be minimum-energy conformations since there were no imaginary frequencies by vibrational calculation at the same level. In this work, one repeat unit was chosen, and alkyl chains were simplified to reduce the calculation time (2-ethylhexyl on dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) was simplified into methyl, hexyl on the thiophene π-bridge of P-hF and P-hDF was simplified into propyl, and 2-ethylhexyl on the thiophene π-bridge of P-ehDF was simplified into isobutyl). The energies and distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of the polymers are shown in Fig. S3.†Fig. 2 presents the energy minimized conformational structures. The fluorine substituent has a great influence on inter- or intramolecular interactions.35 The noncovalent attractive interaction was demonstrated to be effective for minimizing the torsional angles within the polymer backbones.23,35 Compared with P-hF, the introduction of the second F atom in P-hDF lowers the HOMO energy level (−4.889 eV) and decreases the dihedral angle between 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) and thiophene (θ2, θ3) due to the enhanced F–H, F–F interactions and strong stacking.23,35 The second F atom has little effect on the dihedral angle between dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) and thiophene (θ1). In other words, the coplanarity of P-hDF was better than that of P-hF, and a higher JSC of the P-hDF-based device could be expected.1,35–39 The introduction of 2-ethylhexyl in P-ehDF further lowers the HOMO energy level to −4.985 eV and increases the dihedral angle θ1 to 41.7° due to the large steric hindrance. Therefore, a higher VOC of P-ehDF-based device can be expected.

Optical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute chloroform solution and thin films spin-coated on a glass substrate are shown in Fig. 3. The detailed absorption data are summarized in Table 1. These polymers show similar absorption bands in solution with major absorption peaks at 596, 582 and 569 nm for P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF, respectively. This characteristic peak can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor units and acceptor units.18 The other absorption band near 430 nm was due to the π–π* transition.40 In the solid state, the main absorption peaks become broader and red shift toward a longer wavelength with maximum absorption peaks at 655, 645 and 621 nm for P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF, respectively. This behavior is ascribed to the enhanced intermolecular interactions between the polymer main chains and the planarization effect of the π-conjugated polymer backbone.24 The more red shifts from solution to solid film means a better coplanar structure and stronger interchain π–π stacking in the solid state,28,41 which is favorable to obtain a higher JSC.35–39 The red shifts of P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF were 59, 63 and 52 nm, respectively. It means that P-hF and P-hDF showed a bigger red shift than that of P-ehDF, which may be ascribed to the larger steric hindrance of a 2-ethylhexyl side chain on the π-bridge of P-ehDF thus distorting the backbone (Fig. 2). The optical band gap (Eoptg) of P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF can be calculated to be 1.56, 1.56 and 1.63 eV, respectively, from their onset absorption as thin films. It has been proven that attaching a fluorine atom to the electron deficient subunits of low band gap polymers could simultaneously lower the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level energies, while having no or only a minor effect on the Eoptg.20,42,43 The same Eoptg of P-hF and P-hDF is in agreement with previously reported results. The larger Eoptg of P-ehDF may be ascribed to the tortuous polymer backbone which was caused by the stronger steric hindrance31,32 of the 2-ethylhexyl side chain on the π-bridge.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the polymers. The saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.41 eV in this work. As shown in Fig. 4a, all polymers show reversible oxidation behaviors. The onsets of oxidation potentials (Eoxon) of P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF were observed at 0.76, 0.80 and 0.94 V vs. SCE, corresponding to the HOMO levels at −5.17, −5.21 and −5.35 eV, respectively. The onsets of reduction potentials (Eredon) of P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF were observed at −0.70, −0.67 and −0.60 V vs. SCE, corresponding to the LUMO levels at −3.71, −3.74 and −3.80 eV, respectively. Relevant data are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO of P-hDF is slightly lower than that of P-hF, which is caused by the second electron-withdrawing F atom. Interestingly, P-ehDF exhibited a more deeper HOMO of −5.35 eV, which can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the two F atoms and the distorted polymer backbone caused by the steric hindrance effect of the 2-ethylhexyl side chain on the π-bridge,31,32 and the result was consistent with the calculations. Therefore, a higher VOC in P-ehDF-based PSCs can be expected, since VOC is proportional to the offset between the HOMO of the polymeric donor and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor.43 In order to make a clear comparison, the electronic energy level diagram of these polymers and PC71BM is shown in Fig. 4b. The LUMO differences between the polymers and PC71BM are 0.39, 0.36 and 0.30 eV, respectively, and they are large enough to overcome the exciton binding energy and thus guarantee efficient exciton dissociation and transfer.38,43,44

Photovoltaic performance
In order to examine the photovoltaic properties of these polymers, the bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polmer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and tested under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Several batch devices were prepared to optimize the processing conditions such as the polymer to PC71BM weight ratio and the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) concentration. The current density vs. voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5, and the detailed device parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and S1.† One can observe that the VOC of P-hDF is higher than that of P-hF, which could be ascribed to the low lying HOMO of P-hDF caused by the second F atom. Surprisingly, the VOC of P-ehDF is more than 0.1 V and higher than that of P-hDF, resulting from the lower lying HOMO of P-ehDF due to the two F atoms and twisted polymer backbone caused by the larger steric hindrance30,31 of the 2-ethylhexyl side chain on the π-bridge. The result is in accordance with the energy level obtained from CV and calculations. The VOC of all polymers were decreased after the addition of DIO, which is consistent with previous reports.20,45,46 The addition of DIO to the blend solution is found to increase JSC and FF in P-hF and P-hDF based devices, however, JSC and FF decreased in P-ehDF based devices. The JSC of P-hF and P-hDF based devices was optimized to 15.51 and 15.98 mA cm−2, which was higher than that of their carbon-analogues (10.88 and 13.58 mA cm−2).24 This could be attributed to the stronger π-stacking interaction and enhanced solid state ordering compared to the carbon-fused analogue.27–29 Finally, the highest PCE of 6.14% for P-hDF is obtained with a VOC of 0.593 V, a JSC of 15.98 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.8%, when the device was fabricated at a donor–acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 in DCB with a total concentration of 24 mg mL−1 containing 1% DIO as an additive.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on these polymers prepared with the optimal fabrication processes are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the devices exhibit a broad response over the range 320–780 nm. The EQE value between 350 and 700 nm for the P-hDF device is slightly higher than that of the P-hF device. Although the P-ehDF device exhibits a broad response, yet the EQE peak value is only 39%. The integrated JSC from EQE is 15.19, 15.57 and 7.70 mA cm−2 for P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the measured JSC values. Mobility measurements via a space charge limited current (SCLC) method42,46,47 disclose a hole mobility of 2.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P-hF:PC71BM device and 2.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P-hDF:PC71BM device (Fig. S4†), both three orders of magnitude higher than that of the P-ehDF:PC71BM device (4.77 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). The low hole mobility may be caused by the increased dihedral angle between the donor unit and the flanking thiophene rings (Fig. 2), which decrease the coplanarity of the backbone.35,46 The quite low hole mobility could be due to an intrinsic reason that the P-ehDF:PC71BM device exhibits lower JSC.36

Morphology study
To deeply understand the different photovoltaic properties, atom force microscopy (AFM) images of the active layer surface for the best performance device without or with DIO were collected. Fig. 7 shows the height images of P-hF:PC71BM (1:1), P-hDF:PC71BM (1:1) and P-ehDF:PC71BM (1:2) blend films processed without or with the DIO additive, and the corresponding phase images are shown in Fig. 8. The surface of the P-hF:PC71BM film without DIO was packed with small holes with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 0.80 nm (Fig. 7a). When processed with 0.5% DIO (Fig. 7d), the film formed a pin-hole free and a little rough surface topography (RMS = 1.59 nm). The surfaces of the P-hDF:PC71BM film without (Fig. 7b) or with (Fig. 7e) DIO were both uniform without holes. The RMS was increased from 1.57 nm to 5.41 nm after addition of 1% DIO, indicating appropriately enhanced aggregations (Fig. 8e).48 Using DIO can usually facilitate obtaining appropriate phase-separated domains. If the phase-separated domains are preferable without DIO in some systems of polymer/PC71BM, the additive of DIO would not result in higher PCE.8,46,49,50 For the P-ehDF:PC71BM blending film, the addition of 2% DIO resulted in quite a smooth surface topography (RMS = 0.61 nm, Fig. 7f) but without effective phase separation (Fig. 8f), which may be a main reason that P-ehDF exhibits a smaller JSC. The AFM results revealed that the addition of the DIO additive enabled the formation of interpenetrating and interconnected phase separation morphology of P-hF:PC71BM and P-hDF:PC71BM, however, just the reverse for the P-ehDF:PC71BM case, which were consistent with the photovoltaic performance of these polymers (Table 2).8,46,49,50

Conclusions
Three low band gap polymers based on DTS and BT derivatives with different number of F atoms and side chains were designed and synthesized. All the polymers, P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF, exhibited excellent solubility and good thermal stability until decomposition temperatures around 420 °C. P-hF, P-hDF and P-ehDF showed narrow Eoptg of 1.56, 1.56 and 1.60 eV with deep lying HOMO energy levels of −5.17, −5.21 and −5.35 eV, respectively. The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were carefully optimized with different polymer/PC71BM weight ratios and additive volume ratios. For the optimized blend of P-hF, a VOC of 0.553 V, a JSC of 15.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58.8% were obtained, resulting in a PCE of 5.04%. Contributed by the slightly deeper HOMO energy level and better coplanarity structure, the optimized P-hDF-based device exhibited higher VOC of 0.593 V, JSC of 15.98 mA cm−2, FF of 64.8% and a higher PCE of 6.14%. The HOMO level of P-ehDF was 0.14 eV lower than that of P-hDF due to the bigger dihedral angle between DTS and thiophene which was caused by the increased steric hindrance of 2-ethylhexyl, resulting in a higher VOC of 0.805 V. This was one of the highest VOC values obtained in devices based on polymers with DTS as the electron-rich unit and BT derivatives as the electron-deficient unit. However, the JSC was decreased to 8.01 mA cm−2, which was ascribed to unfavorable surface morphology and low hole mobility caused by the twisted backbone. As a result, the P-ehDF-based device only gave a PCE of 4.03%. Our work shows that the photovoltaic performance of a polymer can be tuned by the electron withdrawing groups and steric hindrance of side chains.
Experimental
Measurements

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance III 600 (600 MHz). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. CV measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation equipped with a three-electrode cell consisting of a platinum disk working electrode (2.0 mm in diameter), a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode. The measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte under a nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Thin films were deposited from chloroform solution onto the platinum working electrodes and dried under nitrogen prior to measurement. The redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) internal reference is 0.39 V vs. SCE. HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined by calculating the empirical formula of HOMO = −(Eoxon + 4.80 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)), LUMO = −(Eredon + 4.80 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)), where Eoxon is the onset oxidation potential and Eredon is the onset reduction potential. TGA and DSC measurements were performed by an STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere. XRD spectra were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance. GPC analysis was made using THF as the eluent. The surface roughness and morphology of thin films were characterized by AFM on an Agilent 5400.
Fabrication of polymer photovoltaic devices
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on 15 mm × 15 mm patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM blend (∼110 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic bath in acetone, methanol and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. The substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 6 min, then spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm, and annealed in an oven for 20 min at 160 °C. The polymer and PC71BM were dissolved in deoxygenated anhydrous DCB in different weight ratios and the total concentration of the polymer/PC71BM blending solution was 24 mg mL−1. The solutions were stirred overnight in a nitrogen filled glovebox. An active layer consisting of the blend of polymer and PC71BM was then spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS. Subsequently Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa on top of the active layer as a cathode. The device area was 0.1 cm2 defined by shadow mask. Photovoltaic performance was characterized under illumination with an AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), and J–V curves were recorded by using a Keithley 2420. EQE of solar cells was analyzed by a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
Materials
All reagents and starting materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. THF and toluene were distilled from sodium, with benzophenone as an indicator. 4,4′-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethylstannanyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS-Sn),25 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthienyl)-5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (hDTFBT-Br),24 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (hDTDFBT-Br)32 and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (ehDTDFBT-Br)32,51 were synthesized according to the previously reported methods.
General synthetic procedure of polymers
The polymers were prepared by the same procedure through the Stille coupling reaction. In a 25 mL round-bottom flask, DTS-Sn (0.19 mmole), hDTFBT-Br (hDTDFBT-Br or ehDTDFBT-Br) (0.19 mmole), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (6 mg) and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (14 mg) were subjected to three cycles of evacuation/nitrogen purging and then 5 mL of anhydrous toluene was added. The oil bath was heated to 110 °C slowly, and the reactant was stirred for 48 h at this temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and precipitated in 150 mL of methanol. The precipitate was filtered then purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and CHCl3 in succession. CHCl3 fractions were collected, concentrated, reprecipitated in methanol, and dried under vacuum overnight to give the target polymers.

P-hF: DTS-Sn (144.1 mg, 0.194 mmol) and hDTFBT-Br (124.7 mg, 0.194 mmol) were used in this polymerization following the above procedure, and the polymer was obtained as a blue solid (143.4 mg, yield 82.2%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.12 (br, 1H), 7.98 (br, 1H), 7.71 (br, 1H), 7.22 (br, 2H), 2.87 (br, 4H), 1.76 (br, 4H), 1.53–1.16 (br, 34H), 0.98–0.82 (br, 18H). Molecular weight: Mn = 15400 g mol−1, PDI = 1.86.

P-hDF: DTS-Sn (145.4 mg, 0.195 mmol) and hDTDFBT-Br (129.4 mg, 0.195 mmol) were used, and the polymer was obtained as a dark blue solid (150.0 mg, yield 83.5%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.10 (br, 2H), 7.20 (br, 2H), 2.88 (br, 4H), 1.76 (br, 4H), 1.50–1.14 (br, 34H), 1.00–0.80 (br, 18H). Molecular weight: Mn = 16200 g mol−1, PDI = 1.74.

P-ehDF: DTS-Sn (142.0 mg, 0.191 mmol) and ehDTDFBT-Br (137.1 mg, 0.191 mmol) were used, and the polymer was obtained as a dark blue solid (133.1 mg, yield 76.2%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.10 (br, 2H), 7.20 (br, 2H), 2.84 (br, 4H), 1.80 (br, 2H), 1.51 (br, 2H), 1.41–1.20 (br, 36H), 0.93–0.83 (br, 24H). Molecular weight: Mn = 12800 g mol−1, PDI = 2.19.
