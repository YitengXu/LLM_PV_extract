1. Introduction
Nanomaterials doped with lanthanide ions have attracted considerable attention since Bhargava et al. reported that doped nanocrystalline phosphors yielded high luminescence efficiencies.1–5 With rapidly shrinking size, nanomaterials usually exhibit novel physical and chemical properties due to their extremely small sizes and relatively large specific surface areas.6–8 Taking advantage of size- and shape-dependent properties, lanthanide-doped nanocrystals with desired morphologies will play outstanding roles in building new optoelectronic devices in the near future.9 Up to now, various techniques have been developed to synthesize desired nanostructures, such as hydrothermal process, microemulsion approach, sol–gel process, and combustion method.10–13 To date, there have been a number of reports for luminescence materials.14–16 Among them, fluorides doped with lanthanide ions have low photon energies and high quantum efficiencies, giving them potential for widespread applications in optical communication, display devices, and solid-state lasers.17,18 Especially, NaYF4 is acknowledged as the most efficient upconversion (UC) host material at present.15,19
Composite materials formed by combining two or more materials could present complementary properties that have shown important technological applications.4,20 Carbon materials, such as graphite, carbon black, carbon nanotube, and graphene have attracted a great deal of interest for fundamental science and potential applications in various new optoelectronic devices.21–26 In recent years, graphene has been predicted to possess unusual properties in extraordinary electronic transport at room temperature.27 A variety of graphene-based materials have been successfully prepared and applied in supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, electrocatalysts, dispersible carriers for catalysts, templates for chemical reactions, and so on.28–34
Herein, we successfully prepared NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites (RGC) by growing NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles in interlayers of expanded graphite (EG), accompanied with the simultaneous exfoliation of EG under polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-assisted hydrothermal conditions. The obtained NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites can emit bright green UC luminescence under 980 nm excitation. In addition, the NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites were chosen to design TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite photoanodes, which have the ability to improve the efficiencies of the solar cells. The electron transport and interfacial recombination kinetics were investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of samples
For the synthesis of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites: (1) the preparation of the composite was started by microwave heating EG leading to the formation of thermal expansion EG structure. (2) A transparent Ln(NO3)3–PVP precursor solution was obtained by continuously stirring (30 min) a mixed solution including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 55 kDa) and Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Y, Yb, and Er). (3) The as-prepared EG (0.04 g) was put into a suction bottle, then the bottle was sealed using a dropping funnel with about 30 mL Ln(NO3)3–PVP precursor solution. After the suction bottle maintained a vacuum for 30 minutes, the precursor solution was added dropwise to the suction bottle to promote the solution to fully infuse into the graphite layers. Subsequently, an aqueous solution of NaF (0.5 M) was added into the above solution. The solution was agitated for 30 min. (4) Then it was poured into a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner of 50 mL capability and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final products were treated by mild ultrasonication, filtration and washing with ethanol and distilled water for several times, and finally dried in vacuum at 80 °C.
Fabrication of photoelectrode and the assembly of DSSCs: several pastes, by homogeneously mixing NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite and TiO2 (Degussa P25) into 3 mL of TiO2 colloid, were prepared with different NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites. The TiO2 colloid was prepared following the previously published synthesis procedure.35 A screen-printed double layer of TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene was used as the photoanode. A layer of TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene was prepared by a doctor-blade method on the FTO substrate and then sintered at 450 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the second layer of TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene was covered on the first TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ film and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min again. The sensitization of the photoelectrodes was achieved by immersing them into 0.5 mM ((C4H9)4N)2[Ru(4-carboxy-4′-carboxylate-2,2′bipyridine)2(NCS)2] dye (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio, 1:1) for 48 h at room temperature. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared following the previous literature.36 The dye-sensitized photoelectrode and Pt counter electrode were adhered together with epoxy resin, respectively. The space between the electrodes was filled with the electrolyte, which comprised 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazodium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (3-MPN), by capillary action.
2.2. Characterization
The size and morphology of the NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2010 with operating voltage of 200 kV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 with operating voltage of 15 kV). UC luminescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an adjustable laser (980 nm) as the excitation source with a fiber-optic accessory. Photocurrent–photovoltage curves were recorded by a BAS100B Electrochemical Analyzer. An Xe lamp with an AM1.5 radiation filter was used as the light source. A mask with an aperture was placed on the cell, giving an effective irradiation area of the working electrode of about 0.12 cm2. The EIS was performed with a computer-controlled IM6 impedance measurement unit (Zahner IM6&Zennium, Germany). EIS were obtained by applying sinusoidal perturbations of −0.8 mV over the Voc in the frequency range from 0.05 Hz to 100 kHz. The obtained spectra were fitted with ZsimpWin software in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits. IMPS under short-circuit conditions and IMVS under open-circuit conditions were carried out using the same electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6&Zennium, Germany) with a frequency response analyzer under an intensity modulated (30–150 W m−2) white light emitting diode driven by a Zahner (XPot) source supply. Illumination was always incident on the working electrode side of the solar cells. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1000 Hz to 0.1 Hz for IMPS and IMVS.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structures and morphologies of samples
Sample numbers and corresponding experimental conditions are given in Table 1. Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD pattern of the samples prepared with 1 mmol of Ln(NO3)3 aqueous solution and 5 mmol of NaF aqueous solution as raw materials. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the pure cubic NaYF4 (JCPDS 06-0342). No other impurity peaks were detected. The corresponding SEM image of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals is shown in Fig. 2(a). Plenty of nanospheres with an average diameter of about 100 nm can be seen in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD pattern of the EG. After the hydrothermal procedure, we obtain the typical NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites, as shown in the Fig. 1(c) and (d). When the Ln(NO3)3 content was 0.125 mmol, 0.25 mmol, or 0.5 mmol, A large amount of cubic phase NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ grew on the surface of graphene sheets. However, when the Ln(NO3)3 content was 1 mmol or 2 mmol, cubic phase and hexagonal phase NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ coexisted on the surface of graphene sheets. The peaks in Fig. 1 marked by an asterisk (*) arise from hexagonal phase NaYF4 (JCPDS 16-0334). The corresponding SEM of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites are shown in Fig. 2(b)–(f). The TEM and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite (RGC-2) are shown in Fig. 2(g) and (h). The measured lattice spacing is about 0.31 nm, corresponding to the distance of the {111} planes of the cubic NaYF4. In addition, our previous results indicated that the thickness of graphene sheets is less than 10 layers.28

In order to investigate the number of particles attached on the graphene layers in different samples, the compositions were measured using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) under SEM (Fig. S1 in ESI†). The oxidation of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites have been studied by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S2 in ESI†). It is noted that the weight loss of pure NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ under an air atmosphere is a bit larger than that under an nitrogen atmosphere, which could be attributed to the oxidation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ under an air atmosphere.
3.2. Luminescence properties of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite
The UC luminescent spectra of the cubic phase NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ and NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite (RGC-5) were measured carefully, as shown in Fig. 3. The emissions centered 379, 409, 520, 539, and 651 nm originated from the 4G11/2 → 4I15/2, 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+ ions, respectively. In comparison with that of cubic phase NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals, the upconversion luminescence of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites are decreased. In addition, the intensity ratio of the 4F7/2/2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 to 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 in NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites was larger than that in NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals. Especially, with increasing the graphene content, no upconversion luminescence could be observed in NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites (such as RGC-1 and RGC-2), which could be attributed to the energy transfer between NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ and graphene. And thus, graphene could present excellent performance in optical limiting.
 Fig. 3  UC luminescence spectra of cubic phase NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ and NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite (RGC-5) under 980 nm excitation. 
To investigate the fundamental UC mechanism of RGC-5, the pumping power dependence of the fluorescent intensity was investigated. Fig. 4 shows the logarithmic plots of the emission intensity as a function of excitation power for the 4G11/2 → 4I15/2, 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 4F7/2/2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emissions. For an unsaturated UC process, the emission intensity is proportional to the nth power of the excitation intensity, and the integer n is the number of the laser photons absorbed per upconverted photon emitted.37

Although it is well known that the population of the 4F9/2 comes from a two-photon process, the value of n for red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) was determined to be 0.79 in the NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite (RGC-5). Pollnau et al.37 attributed this phenomenon to the “saturation” process due to the competition between linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states. According to their report, the value of n for a two-photon process is ∼2 when the linear decay of the intermediate state is dominant, while n is ∼1 when the UC is the dominant mechanism in the Yb3+/Er3+ codoped system. The intermediate level of the red emission is 4I13/2, and therefore, the UC is the dominant depletion mechanism for 4I13/2. The value of n for green emission bands was determined to be 1.92, indicated that two-photon processes populated the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels. The value of n for the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 emission was determined to be 1.47, which resembles a two-photon process for populating the 2H9/2 state. Chen et al. attributed this phenomenon to the larger UC rate than linear decay rate of 4F9/2 together with the small n for the 4F9/2.38 A similar phenomenon was observed for the 4G11/2 → 4I15/2 emission. The energy level diagrams of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions as well as the UC mechanism are presented in Fig. S3 in ESI.†
3.3. Photoelectrochemical properties of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite DSSCs
In order to investigate the effects of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite on the photoelectric properties of DSSCs, the DSSC prototype devices were fabricated by using N719-sensitised TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene (TiO2–RGC-5) composite electrodes. Regarding the fabrication of the cells in a convenient and reproducible way, each value for cell performance was determined as an average of the results from at least 5 samples. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of pure TiO2 and TiO2–RGC-5 cells under simulated solar radiation in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm. During the measurement, the illumination is fixed at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding values of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall conversion efficiency (η), obtained from the curves of solar cells, are shown in Table 2. It was found that the photoelectric conversion efficiencies of the DSSCs were enhanced by the incorporation of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite. It is noted that the photoelectric conversion efficiencies of the DSSCs were also enhanced by the incorporation of other NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites.

EIS is a powerful method to investigate internal resistance that is attributed to the charge-transfer properties of DSSCs. Usually, the impedance at low frequency (0.05 Hz–1 Hz) corresponded to the Nernst diffusion of I3−/I− within the electrolyte. The impedance at high frequency (1 kHz–100 kHz) in the impedance spectra corresponded to the capacitance and charge-transfer resistance at the Pt|I3−/I− electrolyte interface. The medium-frequency response at 1 Hz–100 Hz was associated with the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface, where an accumulation of photoelectrons and redox shuttles are expected. For liquid electrolyte, the fast diffusion of electrolyte can result in low resistance, and thus the semicircle at high frequency often overlaps with that at middle frequency. Fig. 6(a) shows the EIS of pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–RGC-5 cell by applying sinusoidal perturbations of −0.8 mV. It can be clearly seen that the interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface of TiO2–RGC-5 cell is smaller than that of pure TiO2 cell.

Fig. S4 in ESI† shows the equivalent circuit fitting of the impedance spectra, Rs[C1(R1O1)](R2CPE), which was used for all the composite DSSCs. The symbols R, C, O, and CPE represented the resistance, capacitance, finite-length Warburg diffusion (ZDif), and constant phase element, respectively. The impedance of the finite-length Warburg diffusion can be written as (1)where RDif = B/YO1, τ = B,2B is a parameter. The CPE is a non-ideal frequency dependent capacitance, a characteristic that can be associated with a distribution of relaxation times or with a non-uniform distribution of current due to material heterogeneity.
The EIS data obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of composite DSSCs were shown in Table 3. It can be clearly seen that R2, which represented interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface, was 14.94 Ω for pure TiO2 cell and 10.64 Ω for TiO2–RGC-5 cell. It is noted that the lower interfacial resistance can result in higher interfacial electron transfer, which is a beneficial factor for enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency. In addition, the series resistance (Rs) for pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–RGC-5 cell are separately 32.1 Ω and 26.92 Ω, respectively, indicating that the incorporation of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene is benefit for the interfacial electron transfer of FTO|TiO2.

IMPS and IMVS were conventional methods to investigate the electron transfer and recombination process. The IMPS response plot and IMVS response plot of TiO2–RGC-5 cell and pure TiO2 cell were shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c). The electron transport time (τd) and the electron recombination time (τn) can be estimated from the IMPS and IMVS plot. In comparison with pure TiO2 cell, the TiO2–RGC-5 cell has shorter electron transport time and longer electron recombination time. It noted that shorter transport time as well as longer electron recombination time can improve the photoelectric properties of DSSCs.
The charge collection efficiencies (ηcc) of DSSCs are determined by the relation: ηcc = 1 − τd/τn.39 Where, τd is a charge transport time and τn is a charge recombination lifetime. Fig. 6(d) shows the charge collection efficiencies of pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–RGC-5 cell. It was found that the charge collection efficiency of TiO2–RGC-5 cell is a little higher than that of pure TiO2 cell. The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) and diffusion length (Ln) can be determined on the basis of film thickness (x) and τd, as shown in Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI.† All these results indicated that the charge transport and interfacial recombination can be improved by adding NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene.
In comparison with TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell, the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+–graphene cell has shorter electron transport time (Fig. S7 in ESI†). In addition, the interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+–graphene cell is smaller than that of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell, as shown in Fig. S8 in ESI.† Of course, the upconversion function of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ is also benefit for enhancing photoelectric properties.40
4. Conclusions
In summary, NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites successfully synthesized by PVP assisted hydrothermal process. After the hydrothermal process, a large number of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles homogeneously cover the surface of high-quality multi-layered graphene sheets from the exfoliation of expanded graphite. Under 980 nm excitation, the 4G11/2 → 4I15/2, 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emissions were observed. More importantly, the NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composites were chosen to design TiO2–NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene composite photoanodes, which have the ability to improve the efficiencies of the solar cells. The electron transport and interfacial recombination kinetics were investigated by means of EIS, IMPS, and IMVS. The results indicated that the incorporation of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+–graphene benefits the interfacial electron transfer of FTO|TiO2.
