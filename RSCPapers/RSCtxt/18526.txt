    , Accepted 22nd September 2020First published on 22nd September 2020AbstractA set of three new Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes decorated with 5-aryl tetrazolato ligands (R–CN4)−, (D series, namely D1, D3 and D4), is presented herein. Whereas complex D1 represents the pyrazinyl tetrazolato analogue of a previously reported Ru(II) complex (D2) with the general formula cis-[(dcbpy)2Ru(N^N)]+, in which dcbpy is 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid and N^N is the chelating 2-pyridyl tetrazolato anion, the design of the unprecedented Ru(II) species D3 and D4 relied upon a completely different architecture. More specifically, the molecular structure of thiocyanate-based species cis-[(dcbpy)2Ru(NCS)2], that is typically found in benchmark Ru(II) dyes for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs), was modified with the replacement of two of the –NCS ligands in favour of the introduction of 5-aryl tetrazolato anions, such as the deprotonated form of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1H-tetrazole, for complex D3 and 5-(4-cyanophenyl)-1H-tetrazole in the case of complex D4. To streamline the behavior of the D series of Ru(II) complexes as photosensitizers for DSSCs, an in-depth analysis of the excited state properties of D1, D3 and D4 was performed through TDDFT calculations and TDAS (nanosecond transient difference absorption spectroscopy). The obtained results highlight a trend that was confirmed once D1, D3 and D4 were tested as photosensitizers for DSSC under different conditions. Along the series of the Ru(II) complexes, the neutrally charged species D3 and D4 displayed the best photovoltaic performances.
Introduction
Over the past decade, intense research efforts have been devoted to studying the coordination chemistry of tetrazole and tetrazolato based compounds, which have found application as building blocks for metal organic frameworks (MOFs)1 as well as nitrogen rich molecules for energetic materials2 and polytopic ligands for the construction of luminescent metal- and lanthanide-based complexes.3 In very recent times, the applicative scenario of these synthetically versatile nitrogen-rich heterocycles has been extended to the third generation photovoltaic technologies with the incorporation of tetrazolato based chelates, such as the 2-pyridyl tetrazolato anion,4 within the structure of Ru(II) photosensitizers for dye sensitized solar cell application (DSSCs). Aiming at extending our past studies dealing with the preparation of photo and electrochemiluminescent Ru(II)-tetrazolato complexes to the design of new examples of tetrazolato-based DSSCs dyes, we now report the preparation and characterization of new examples of Ru(II)-tetrazolato complexes, which differ both in nature and in the coordinating mode adopted by the tetrazolato ligands (Fig. 1). At first, we have slightly modified the structure of the Ru(II) tetrazolato-based dye reported by Dragonetti et al.,4a (complex D2, Fig. 1), by replacing the 2-pyridyltetrazolato ligand with the 2-pyrazinyl tetrazolato anion (complex D1, Fig. 1). Then, aiming at introducing an unprecedented class of tetrazolato-based Ru(II) dyes, the “traditional” molecular structure of thiocyanate-based Ru(II) dyes, cis-[(dcbpy)2Ru(NCS)2]—where dcbpy denotes 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid—was modified with the replacement of the two of the –NCS ligands in favour of two 5-aryl tetrazolato anions, such as the deprotonated form of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1H-tetrazole for complex D3 and 5-(4-cyanophenyl)-1H-tetrazole in the case of complex D4 (Fig. 1). Further insights into the excited state nature and charge transfer dynamics of D1, D3 and D4 on TiO2 were obtained by combining TDDFT calculations with TDAS (transient difference absorption spectroscopy) in the ns-ms regime and DC/AC photoelectrochemical measurements with two different I−/I3− based electrolytes.

Results and discussion
Synthesis, ESI-MS and NMR spectroscopy
The tetrazole ligands reported in this work have been prepared by following two slightly different methods, both of them involving the 1,3 dipolar cyclization of the azide anion (N3−) onto the appropriate nitrile precursor. More specifically, 2(1H-tetrazol-5yl) pyridine (H-PTZ), 2(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) pyrazine (H-PYTZ) and 5-(4-cyanophenyl)-1H-tetrazole (H-TphCN) were obtained in almost quantitative yields by adopting the procedure reported by Finnegan and co-workers,5 while the preparation of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1H-tetrazole, (H-TphBr) was achieved through the method described by Koguro and co-workers.6
The preparation of the Ru(II) species D1–D4 was accomplished by following a multistep procedure that involved at first halide extraction from cis-[Ru(dcbpy)2Cl2] (dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) with a molar excess of AgBF4 in refluxing methanol. The removal of AgCl afforded a red filtrate that was then combined with the desired tetrazolate anion. After being heated at the reflux temperature overnight, the resulting mixtures were cooled to room temperature. The addition of a copious amount of diethyl ether to the reaction vessels caused the precipitation of the desired Ru(II) complexes, which did not require any further purification step. The identity of all the Ru(II) complexes was at first deduced by ESI-Mass spectrometry and then confirmed by 1H-NMR experiments, whose results confirmed the isolation of the desired products D1–D4, since the corresponding 1H-NMR spectra (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†) displayed a number of resonances congruent with their expected symmetry point group, i.e. Cs for D1 and D2 and C2 for D3 and D4 (Scheme 1).

Redox properties
The redox properties of all the reported Ru(II)-based dyes D1–D4 have been investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments in the corresponding CH3OH/CH3CN 1:1 solutions (Table 1).

All the reported species exhibited single oxidation in the region of positive potentials, which was assigned to the Ru(II)/Ru(III) process (see the ESI, Fig. S14–S17†). In good agreement with the data that were reported previously for similar Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes such as [(bpy)2Ru(PTZ)]+ and [(bpy)2Ru(TPYZ)]+,8 where bpy is 2,2′ bipyridine, the oxidation (vs. SCE) of D1 occurs at more positive potentials (+1.31 V) than that of D2 (+1.02 V), according to the remarkable electron withdrawing character of the pyrazine ring (TPYZ) with respect to the pyridyl tetrazolato (PTZ) moiety used in the design of D2. A similar trend emerged from the CV curves of the neutral dyes D3 and D4. Given the pronounced electron withdrawing character of the cyanide group of TphCN, when compared to that of the bromine substituent of TphBr (complex D4), the oxidation peak of D3 was found at more positive potentials (+1.30 V) with respect to D4 (+1.07 V). With regard to negative potentials, the CV investigation was carried out by exploring the first visible reduction (see the ESI, Fig. S14–S17†). In the case of the positively charged Ru(II), the first process occurs at the same potential (−1.01 V) for both D1 and D2. In the case of the neutral dyes D3 and D4, a displacement of the first reductive processes to more negative potentials was observed (−1.36 V for D3 and −1.56 V for D4), in good agreement with the electronic effects that are brought by the bromine substituent. As a comparison, the Ru(II)/(III) process for N719 falls at ca. +1.07 V, while the dcbpy-based reduction was found at ca. −1.46 V vs. SCE in our experimental conditions. This ca. 200 mV anodic shift of the Ru(II)/Ru(III) compared to the literature values in pure ACN9 could be explained by the lower Lewis basicity of the MeOH/ACN, which makes the NCS ligands stronger electron acceptors via second sphere interactions.
Electronic spectroscopy
The absorption spectra of D1–D4 were obtained at room temperature from the corresponding methanol (CH3OH) (10−4M) solutions, and are depicted in Fig. 2. For all the Ru(II) species, the absorption profile typically displays intense bands in the UV region (200–350 nm) which are assigned to LC (ligand centred) dcbpy-based π–π* transitions. Weaker absorptions are found from 450 to 510 nm (visible region, Fig. 2) and are ascribed to MLCT-type (metal to ligand charge transfer) transitions, involving the Ru(II) metal centre and both the dcbpy and the tetrazolato-based ligands. These assignments have been further circumstantiated with theoretical TDDFT calculations (see later on).

The UV-vis absorption feature of the Ru(II) complexes D1–D4 were compared to those of the standard dye N719,10 which exhibits under our experimental conditions an absorption profile with λmax = 525 nm (ε = 1.26 × 104 M−1 cm−1). At first glance, the comparison between N719 and D1–D4 results in the hypsochromic shift of the MLCT band (Table 1) for all the complexes, enlightening a more pronounced variation for D1 (Δλ = ca. 70 nm), while a less evident albeit significant shift to lower wavelength (Δλ = 20–30 nm) of the 1MLCT maxima was detected for D2, D3 and D4. In this regard, the differences in MLCT-based absorption maximum between D1 and D2 can be attributed to the more electron withdrawing character of the pyrazine ring of D1. No substantial differences were found from the comparison of the spectra of benzonitrile and bromobenzene appended complexes D3 and D4, which both displayed an absorption maximum centred at ca. 500 nm. All the Ru(II) species of the series D1–D4 are spontaneously adsorbed on TiO2 films during a traditional sensitization process, giving rise to sensitized photoanodes capable of absorbing up to ca. 90% of incident photons around 500 nm in the case of D3 and D4 (Fig. 3). The light harvesting ability of D1 is much less satisfactory, owing to its smaller absorptivity (ε) and lower solubility in the chosen solvent medium which may limit the dye uptake. All the D-type complexes retain their spectral characteristics once loaded on the solid thin films, displaying the same spectral shape and nearly unaffected absorption maxima as in solution. Thus, the outcome of the spectroscopic and electrochemical experiments that were performed in fluid solution might be confidently extended to the sensitizer moieties bound to the semiconductor surface. Finally, the absorption profiles obtained from the series of Ru(II) species D1–D4 are substantially blue shifted with respect to the one of the reference compound N719, whose lowest energy MLCT band is centred at ca. 550 nm and tails off beyond 700 nm, i.e. the low energy region in which the harvesting from the species D3 and D4 becomes negligible.

TDDFT calculations
TDDFT calculations of the optimized structures of complexes D1, D3, D4 and N719 were performed for comparison. The frontier orbitals involved in the main visible transitions are reported in Fig. S1, ESI.† We selected the PBE0 functional for being reported as benchmark11 to reproduce accurately the equilibrium geometries of many Ru(II) complexes. The DGDZVP basis set was proved valuable for studying the optical and electronic properties of Ru polypyridine compounds,12 while the bulk solvation properties were described in the framework of the continuum polarization model.13 The calculation qualitatively reproduces the experimental trend in HOMO energy obtained from cyclic voltammetry, following the series D1 >D3 >D4. Also, the D series exhibits a deeper HOMO energy than N719, in agreement with both experimental data and the expected stronger electron withdrawing effect exerted by the tetrazolato ligands. The calculation predicts the LUMOs energy to be quite similar in D3, D4 and N719, being mainly localized on the same dcbpy moieties, while D1's first empty orbitals are ca. 300 meV lower than those of the former. These results are in good agreement with the relative experimental trend found in the reduction potentials (Table 1), although the comparison with the CV values should be taken with some caution, due to the irreversible electrochemical behavior originated by the first reduction processes localized on the dcbpy ligand.14 A comparison between the lowest 25 vertical transitions and the experimental spectrum is reported in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Experimental (black, blue, red and purple) vs. TDDFT/PBE0/DGDZVP computed optical transitions (vertical grey lines surmounted by red circles) in complexes D1–D4 (from left to right) compared to N719 (bottom right). Experimental spectra were normalized to the lowest absorption band, while vertical transitions were normalized to the most intense one. 
The TDDFT/PBE0/DGDZVP calculations reproduce the experimental optical absorption of all the complexes quite accurately, showing transitions clustered around 2.5 and 3.3 eV, coincident with the experimental main absorption band of all compounds. The most intense computed vertical transitions overlap well with the respective maximum of the lowest energy experimental absorption band, found at 2.74 eV in the case of D1 and at ca. 2.5 eV for D3 and D4. Clearly, the low energy tail of the experimental absorption spectra, which also bears spin forbidden excitations to triplet states, is less satisfactorily described by this type of TDDFT calculation, which only includes excitations with the same spin multiplicity as that of the singlet ground state (S0). The matching with the experimental spectrum of N719 is also reasonably good, as groups of transitions centered around 3.25 and 2.2 eV are observed. In the case of N719, the computed transitions appear to be correctly red shifted with respect to those of D1, D3 and D4, showing the lowest transitions at ca. 1.8 eV, in good agreement with the experimental absorption onset of such compound. The main contributions to the optical transitions involve mixed excitations from the frontier orbitals HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 to LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2, whose energy levels and isodensity maps are depicted in Fig. S5 and S6, ESI.† In the case of D4, excitations from HOMO−3 to LUMO+3 are also contributing to visible absorption. In all cases, the lowest virtual orbitals are mainly localized on the dcbpy ligands whose energy is thus nearly the same for the whole series under investigations. The relevant occupied orbitals bear contributions from the atomic orbitals of the Ru(II) metal centre, which may mix with both the σ and π systems of the ancillary ligands. In the case of N719, the expected strong mixing with the π system of the NCS groups is observed,15 and indeed, the sulfur atoms of the NCS contribute the most (up to 45%) to the amplitude of the highest occupied orbital. In the case of D1 and D4, orbital mixing with the ancillary ligands is much less substantial. Thus, while in the case of N719 visible absorption bears the contribution from mixed MLCT and LLCT (ligand to ligand charge transfer) states, in the case of D1–D4 series, we observe more classical MLCT states where the electron is mainly excited from metal centered orbitals to empty orbitals having π character localized on the dcbpy ligands. This is confirmed by the EDDMs (electron density difference maps) of the lowest visible excitation (Fig. 5), which corresponds to the charge distribution in terms of electron and hole density in the lowest excited state (i.e. the S1 state) of each dye, from which charge injection is likely to occur.
 Fig. 5  EDDMs resulting from the lowest energy optical excitation of complexes D1, D3 and D4 compared to N719 (left to right). The green surfaces depict the increased electron density (i.e. electron localization) while the blue surfaces indicate regions of depleted electron density (i.e. hole localization). 
EDDMs clearly reveal that in all cases, in the lowest excited state (S1), the electron is localized on the dcbpy moiety, which shows a substantial involvement of the –COOH anchoring group allowing a favorable coupling for electron transfer to TiO2 (Fig. 5). On the other hand, hole density is principally localized on the Ru(II) core for D1, D3 and D4; however, D3 and D4 also present significant mixing with the orbitals of the 5-aryl-tetrazolato moieties. The shorter transition dipole moment of D1, compared to those of D3 and D4, may explain the relatively low extinction coefficient of the former. When a given dye is attached to TiO2, hole delocalization on the ancillary ligands, which are directed far from the surface (see for example the molecular mechanics models in Fig. S7, ESI†), favours long lived charge separation by spatially decoupling the hole centred on the molecular moiety from the photoinjected electron in the density of acceptor states of TiO2. Unrestricted PBE0/DGDZVP calculations of the oxidized molecular species (formally Ru(III) species) introduce the effect of orbital relaxation due to the formation of a positive charge on the molecular dyes following electron injection. These calculations indicate that the involvement of the tetrazolato ancillary ligand is more substantial than what can be anticipated from the analysis of EDDMs, representing the charge distribution in the lowest singlet excited state. The involvement of the non-chromophoric ligands in the HSOMO (highest singly occupied molecular orbital, Fig. 6), which essentially describes the spatial hole distribution, varies in the order N719 (NCS) > D4 (TPhBr) > D3 (TphCN) > D1 (TPYZ). Table S1† reports the single atom contribution to the HSOMOs of each dye, showing that the amplitude of such wavefunction on the Ru atoms decreases in the order D1 > D3 > D4 > N719, in agreement with the increasing extent of delocalization on the ancillary ligand. Besides retarding back recombination, hole delocalization on the ancillary ligands can be crucial in accelerating the regeneration kinetics by the electrolyte by exposing most of the hole density to diffusing iodide ions acting as electron donors in solution.

Time-resolved spectroscopy
Nanosecond transient difference absorption spectra (TDAS) of the complexes D1, D3 and D4 in solution are reported in Fig. S9, ESI.† With the sole exception of D1, whose poor solubility demanded the addition of a few drops of TBAOH, all spectra were measured in CH3OH. To avoid possible sample degradation upon UV exposure, a 400 nm cut off filter was placed in front of the probe beam, and thus, the spectral analysis was restricted to the 400–800 nm range. Each dye displayed a mono-exponential excited state decay kinetic, with lifetimes, under aerated conditions, that varied according to the sequence D4 (108 ns) > D3 (60 ns) > D1 (33 ns) > N719 (ca. 8 ns). The excited state features were typical of the formation of a triplet MLCT/LLCT state in Ru(II) compounds, which is populated in a sub-nanosecond time scale, showing a broad ground state bleaching which extends from 400 to 600 nm and mirrors almost exactly the main visible bands of the complexes that peak at ca. 450 nm in the case of D1, 500 nm for D3 and ca. 510 nm for D4. The transient spectrum of N719 is short lived and partially convolved within the instrumental response function. Nevertheless, the bleach of the MLCT/LLCT bands is clearly observed, followed by triplet state absorption between 650 and 750 nm and by a bleach caused by spontaneous emission rising up at λ > 750 nm. Triplet absorption is much less evident for the D series compounds, being mostly offset by the stronger spontaneous emission (phosphorescence) causing a broad bleaching band to appear at λ > 600 nm, in agreement with the steady state emission spectra acquired at r.t. in solution (Fig. S8, ESI†). In general, the longer lifetime exhibited by the D series compared to N719 can be qualitatively explained on the basis of the energy gap law16 and by the coordination sphere in N719, which bears two anionic NCS ligands, which, through the establishment of stronger second sphere solvation effects, facilitate vibrational funneling of the electronic energy and collisional relaxation. Electron injection is known to be very efficient for many Ru(II) compounds, like the benchmark compound N719, providing a sufficiently negative excited state oxidation potential (E*ox) and a proper excited state directionality. Injection from the lowest singlet state S1 is confined within a fs time scale, while injection from the lowest triplet state T1 is still fast compared to other deactivation pathways, being reported in the 1–100 ps time frame.17 Injection from the T1 state is actually believed to be the dominant one in a real DSSC, owing to the dynamics caused by the interlacing of several interacting chemical components (semiconductor, dye, electrolyte having a complex formulation).18 In our case, E*ox values of the D series are quite comparable with that reported for N719. Singlet excited state redox potentials (SEox*) range between −1.07 V vs. SCE (D1) and −0.87 V vs. SCE (D3), while triplet potentials TEox* are in the order of 200–300 mV lower. Fig. 7 summarizes the thermodynamic levels relevant to DSSC functioning expressed on the electrochemical potential scale vs. SCE, pictured at open circuit along with the N719 levels, in good agreement with the literature data,10,18 taken under the same experimental conditions as those of the D series. The flat band potential (EF) of TiO2 is represented at ca. −0.7 V vs. SCE, a commonly accepted value of TiO2 in contact with organic DSSC electrolytes19 along with the density of states (DOS) of TiO2, .20E0 is an experimental potential parameter ranging between 50 and 100 mV and E should be taken in absolute value. The TiO2 DOS stretches across the semiconductor conduction band edge and its occupancy is related to the quasi-Fermi energy of the semiconductor. Generally speaking, the singlet excited state potentials of Ds singlet states are quite aligned with that of N719, and the triplet states, with the exception of D3, are comparable or slightly better reductants. As a consequence, with the good excited state directionality observed before, we expect a satisfactory coupling with the acceptor states of TiO2 and efficient injection under the short circuit (sc) condition (TiO2 Fermi level equilibrated with Eredox). We note that the injection kinetics is relatively independent of the increase in photovoltage (forward bias) unless the density of states does not shift as a whole, due to the presence of the TiO2 potential determining ions or other additives (band edge modifiers) in the electrolyte composition.
 Fig. 7  Ground and excited state oxidation potentials of the dyes under consideration (data from Table 1 and Fig. S4†) compared to the TiO2 flat band potential in an organic solvent and to the equilibrium potential of a typical iodide based electrolyte. 
This is due to the fact that the DOS increases exponentially with energy, and despite its partial filling due to electron injection, there is always a sufficient number of available acceptor states in the semiconductor to ensure the efficient quenching of the dye excited states by electron transfer. Clearly, the overlap of the DOS with the T1 states is lower and, in general, injection from the triplet state will be slower. This drawback is however well balanced by the much longer T1 lifetime with respect to S1. Concerning dye regeneration by the iodide based redox couple, (S+ + 2I− → S + I2−˙, for example), the D family displays a stronger driving force than N719, which should guarantee efficient regeneration despite the less favorable HSOMO localization in the D series with respect to N719.21
TDA spectroscopy of thin films in contact with 0.1 M Li+ in CH3CN (Fig. 8), revealed the absence of spontaneous emission and, as main spectral features, the complete bleaching of the ground state absorption owing to MLCT/LLCT transitions and the contemporary appearance of a broad absorption rising for λ > 600 nm, which is more evident in the D3, D4 and N719 species while it is less pronounced for D1. These transient spectra evolve in time, following multiexponential (at least bi exponential) kinetics without changes in their relative spectral shape, up to the ms time scale. All these properties are consistent with the formation of the long lived charge separated state (Ru(III)-e−(TiO2)) whose decay by recombination is still incomplete within the 5 ms time window chosen for these experiments. Formation of this state is always within the instrumental response of the spectrometer even when operated at its maximum resolution (FWHM ca. 7 ns) while the absence of any detectable residual of spontaneous emission indicates that electron transfer is the dominant excited state quenching pathway once these dyes are attached to TiO2.

For the whole D series, Ru(II) regeneration by iodide (0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII and 0.05 M MgI2 in CH3CN) is generally fast compared to recombination (Fig. S10, ESI†), being mostly complete within 10−5–10−4 s time scale, while recombination is at least one order of magnitude longer, extending well into the ms time scale. This agrees with the strong oxidant power of the ground state of the D complexes, making electron donation exergonic by at least 0.6 eV. Regeneration efficiency, ηreg, (ηreg = (kreg/(kreg + krec))), where kreg and krec are pseudo-first order rate constants extracted from the amplitude weighted time constants obtained from the biexponential fits,22 stands at 98% for D3 and D4, while sits around 80% in the case of D1. Regeneration of N719 is also quantitative and mostly occurs within the instrumental time response of the spectrometer (FWHM ca. 1 μs, base 4 μs), when pre-amplified by the 10 kΩ input impedance. The faster Ru(II) regeneration kinetics observed in the case of D3 and D4 may arise from the better delocalization of holes on TphBr and TphCN tetrazolato ligands, which allows a better electronic coupling with I−, an essential requirement in speeding up the electron donation.
Photoelectrochemistry

JV curves, IPCE and APCE spectra were collected with sandwich transparent DSSCs, equipped with PEDOT-coated counter electrodes and based on the CFE electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.05 M MgI2 and 0.1 M I2 in CH3CN, Fig. 9). CFE, a high performance electrolyte enriched with Li+ and Mg2+, is tailored to emphasize photocurrent at the expense of photovoltage, which is useful to probe the sensitization properties of the dyes under conditions similar to those used for transient spectroscopy. Both Li+ and Mg2+ downshift the TiO2 DOS favoring charge injection,23 while the excess of I− (0.7 M) with respect to I2 (0.1 M), together with the low viscosity of the electrolyte, promote an efficient regeneration of Ru(III). Clearly, CFE is not suited for long term stability of the DSSC, owing to CH3CN volatility and relatively low I2 concentration, the latter being a species that is depleted from the electrolyte during prolonged cell operation, in particular when heated and/or polarized under reverse bias.24

J–V curves collected under an AM 1.5G illumination (top left), under dark conditions (top right), IPCE spectra under short circuit (bottom left) and APCE spectra (APCE = IPCE/LHE) (bottom right) computed from data (bottom left) and Fig. 3. The APCE spectra were restricted to the spectral region enclosing the visible band maximum, where the error in the estimation of the LHE is the smallest. 
The performance of the D dyes varies in the order D4 > D3 > D1 (Fig. 9a). D3 produces the best photocurrent (≈8 mA cm−2), but D4 presents the best photovoltage value. Both D3 and D4 exceed N719 in photovoltage, consistent with dark currents varying in the order D3 ≈ D4 < N719 < D1. This trend could be explained by the greater shielding exerted by the TphBr and TphCN pendants on the TiO2 surface, which partially screen the semiconductor surface from the approach of the I3− electron acceptor. In the case of D1, this is less effective, probably due to both the lower steric hindrance of the TPYZ ligand with respect to the formers and lower surface loading caused by solubility issues. The lower photocurrent observed for the D sensitizers with respect to N719 appears to be mainly motivated by light harvesting. Indeed, as clearly shown by the photoaction spectra (IPCE vs. λ, Fig. 9c), N719 extends its photoconversion up to 770 nm, while for D3 and D4 it is restricted at wavelengths <700 nm and, when compared to N719, drops significantly in the 550–700 nm region, consistent with their absorption spectra (Fig. 3). Normalization of the IPCE for the light harvesting efficiency (LHE (λ) = 1 − 10−A(λ), where A is the absorbance of the background corrected transparent sensitized film) affords the APCE or IQE figure (APCE = Φinj × ηreg where Φinj is the injection quantum efficiency and ηreg is the regeneration efficiency measured under short circuit). APCE values ranging between 90% and 80% are in good agreement with the ηreg values estimated from transient spectroscopy and are consistent with good injection yields (80–90%) for D1–D4, expected on the basis of their excited state oxidation potentials.
APCE also corroborates the indication that the low performance of D1 is mostly explained by its poor light harvesting and blue shifted response, together with its lowest ηreg. APCE also shows that the D3 and D4 responses are slightly lower than that of N719; taking into account that ηreg ≈ 1, this could be indicative of a slightly lower injection efficiency from the excited states, which are less sensitive to the solvent environment than N719, which bears NCS groups that are able to establish second sphere interactions with the solvent medium. Indeed, in contact with pure ACN (the solvent of the CFE formulation), the excited states of N719 become significantly better reductants, owing to a cathodic shift of ca. 200 mV of the Ru(II)/(III) potential. This limitation of the D series could be exacerbated when using different electrolyte formulations containing a lower amount of TiO2 potential determining cations like Li+ and Mg2+.
The analysis of the photoelectrochemical performance was thus extended to solar cells built with commercially available materials and filled with a high stability electrolyte with a formulation optimized for N719 (“Iodolyte Z-100”, Solaronix). The details of the electrolyte formulation are not disclosed by the producer but in general it contains basic additives to enhance photovoltage, a greater amount of I2 and ionic liquids with lower volatility as I− sources. The J–V curves of the Ru(II) dyes D1–D4 and N719 obtained under an AM 1.5G solar simulator as well as the IPCE values are reported in Fig. S11–S13,† together with the resulting efficiency figures in Table S1, ESI.† With “Iodolyte Z-100” as the electrolyte, a decrease in photocurrent density and IPCE value was observed for all dyes including N719. In contrast, an increase in photovoltage and fill factor was detected. A comparison between CFE and “Iodolyte Z-100” reveals that the decrease in photocurrent is quite modest for N719 but significant for the D series (by a factor at least ×2). The shift in photovoltage is motivated by the presence of basic additives which shift the flat band potential of TiO2, while the lower photocurrent and higher iodine content are favorable for enhancing the fill factor. The gain in photovoltage with respect to CFE is significant for N719 (ca. 250 mV) but much less evident for the D sensitizers due to the strongly reduced photocurrent density which suggests a less effective injection and regeneration of Ru(III) in such electrolytes. TDA spectroscopy performed in the presence of “Iodolyte Z-100” reveals the formation of Ru(III) but regeneration appears to be slower, being incomplete in the 0.1 ms timescale. Also, under these conditions, we can confirm that D4 is the best sensitizer among the tetrazolato series, owing to the best combination of ground and excited state oxidation potentials and light harvesting, which was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses (EIS, Fig. 10).

In the dark and in the presence of a forward voltage equal to the open circuit voltage (VOC) recorded under illumination, EIS provides the negative of the imaginary part of Z (−Z′′) vs. log(ω) plot from which one can obtain the TiO2 electron lifetime (τ) defined by  (Fig. 10 left),25 where ωmax is the angular frequency at which the –Z′′ peak is observed. This time constant depends on the charge recombination rate that occurs between TiO2 sensitized films and the “Iodolyte Z-100” electrolyte.26
In agreement with the results obtained from the photoelectrochemical characterization, the calculated electron lifetime values (Fig. 10 right) suggest that dyes D3 and D4 are the most suitable Ru(II) complexes for DSSC fabrication in the D series described herein.
Conclusions
A series of four Ru(II) sensitizers containing 5 aryl-tetrazolato-based ligands was investigated with the aim of elucidating their structure-related electronic properties and charge transfer dynamics when employed for n-type spectral sensitization. Synthetic routes for ligand structures bearing the 2-pyridyl substituent (D2) and with stronger electron withdrawing pyrazine ring (D1) were established, followed by the preparation of a further unprecedented class of tetrazolato-based Ru(II) dyes, where decoration of the traditional fragment cis-(bpy-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) with two 5-aryl tetrazolato (D3 and D4) was carried out, leading to new examples of thiocyanate free dyes. TDDFT calculations have shown that all the new dyes possess excited states with a prevailing MLCT character, with a good directionality for n-type sensitization, while the combination of computation, electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses established ground and excited state thermodynamic properties well suited for efficient interfacial charge separation. This was confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy in the ns ms time scale and by the internal and external quantum yields of photon to electron conversions ≥80% in a Li+ and Mg2+ rich electrolyte. Among the D series, best performances were shown by complexes D3 and D4, owing to the combination of broad harvesting, efficient regeneration by iodide (>90%) and nearly unitary quantum yields of electron injection. Compared to the standard N719, the main limitation of this new class of Ru(II) sensitizers arises from their narrower and blue shifted spectral response, originating from the stronger stabilization of the dπ orbitals of Ru(II) induced by the tetrazolato moieties, which limits photoconversion at λ < 700 nm.
Experimental section
General considerations
All the reagents and solvents were obtained commercially (e.g. Alfa-Aesar) and used as received without any further purification unless otherwise specified. All the reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere following Schlenk protocols. ESI-mass spectra were recorded using a Waters ZQ-4000 instrument (ESI-MS, acetonitrile as the solvent). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (consisting of 1H, and 13C experiments) were always recorded using a Varian Mercury Plus 400 instrument (1H, 400.1) at room temperature. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to residual solvent resonances. Absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer. Uncorrected steady-state emission and excitation spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrometer equipped with a 450 W xenon arc lamp, double excitation and single emission monochromators, and a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier tube (185–850 nm). Emission and excitation spectra were corrected for source intensity (lamp and grating) and emission spectral response (detector and grating) by a calibration curve supplied with the instrument. The wavelengths for the emission and excitation spectra were determined using the absorption maxima of the MLCT transition bands (emission spectra) and at the maxima of the emission bands (excitation spectra).
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat using a glassy carbon 492/GC/3 (diameter: 4 mm) or a platinum disk 492/PT/2 (diameter: 2 mm) as the working electrode and an SCE 303/SCG/6 reference electrode (Amel electrochemistry instruments); scan rates of 100 mV s−1 were applied. The experiments were carried out in degassed CH3CN/CH3OH 1:1 (v/v) (spectroscopy grade) solutions containing 0.1 M [Bu4N][PF6]. The recorded potentials have been referred to the redox couple Fc+/Fc (ferricenium|ferrocene), which displayed E1/2 = 0.33 V vs. SCE under the same experimental conditions (at 298 K, from CH3CN/CH3OH 1:1 (v/v) solutions containing 0.1 M [Bu4N][PF6] as the supporting electrolyte).

General procedure for the preparation of the cis-[Ru(N^N)2(L)]+[BF4]−-type complexes

cis-[Ru(dcbpy)2Cl2] (0.066 g, 0.10 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (60 mL) in a 100 mL round-bottom flask protected from light. A slight excess (2.2 equiv.) of AgBF4 was added and the mixture was stirred at reflux for 3 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad and the filtrate was added dropwise to a methanol (5 mL) solution of the appropriate tetrazolato ligand (1.6 equiv.). Once the addition was complete, the deep-red solution was stirred at reflux temperature overnight. The mixture was then cooled to r.t., concentrated to about half of the initial volume and a copious amount of diethyl ether was added, causing the precipitation of a crude product, which was collected by suction filtration.

DSSC assembly and characterization
The TiO2 paste were deposited onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (sheet resistance 7 Ω sq−1, Sigma-Aldrich) using a semi-automatic screen-printer (AUR'EL 900, AUR'EL Automation s.p.a., Italy) and treated at 450 °C for 30 minutes.27 Before this deposition, the substrates were coated with a TiO2 blocking layer (BL), deposited according to a previously reported procedure.28 Briefly, an ethanolic solution of TiCl4 (50 mM) was spin coated onto the FTO substrates to obtain a thin compact TiO2 film, and then treated at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The thickness of the TiO2 film (photoanode) was adjusted to about 8 μm. After sintering, the films were immersed in a 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C and then fired at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The as-obtained photoanodes were then dipped for 16 hours in 0.3 mM absolute ethanol solution of each dye. As a reference, DSSCs sensitized with di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis (isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II), named N719 dye (Sigma-Aldrich) were also prepared. A pre-drilled FTO coated glass covered with either electrodeposited PEDOT or a sputtered platinum layer was used as the counter electrode. After photoanode sensitization, the electrodes were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot melt gasket made of Meltonix (thickness 25 μm, Solaronix, Switzerland). Different electrolytes were used, consisting of either a custom formulated electrolyte (CFE) comprised of 0.1 M LiI (99.999% Sigma Aldrich), 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) (ACS grade ≥98%, Sigma Aldrich), 0.05 M MgI2 (>99% (Fluka)) and 0.1 M I2 (>99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) in CH3CN (>99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) or with a commercial optimized electrolyte for NCS containing dyes (Iodolyte Z100, Solaronix, Switzerland). The electrolyte was introduced in the cell via vacuum back filling through the hole in the counter electrode. The active area of the solar cells was fixed at 0.25 cm2. In order to evaluate the DSSCs performance, current–voltage curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and incident photon-to-electron-conversion efficiency (IPCE) analyses were done. The J–V tests of devices were conducted on a Keithley Model 2400 with an AM 1.5G solar simulator (SUN 2000, Abet Technologies). The system was calibrated against a certified silicon solar cell and a light intensity of 1000 W m−2. IPCE was determined using a PVE300 (Bentham Instrument Ltd, Reading, Berkshire, UK) with a dual xenon/quartz halogen light source, measured in DC mode and with no bias light. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded using an AutoLab PGSTAT302N+FRA32 (Metrohm Autolab, The Nederlands) in the dark at open circuit voltage. An alternating sinusoidal signal of 10 mV and a frequency range of 100 kHz–0.1 Hz were used. The experimental points of impedance spectra were fit with the Z-View software (Scribner Associates Inc.).
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption spectroscopy in the ns–ms time scale was carried out with a previously described time resolved spectrometer.29 Briefly, the samples either consisting of sensitized TiO2 thin films or methanolic dye solutions were excited by the 532 nm harmonic of a nanosecond Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite II) attenuated to ca. 3.3 mJ per pulse per cm2 by using a defocusing lens and neutral filters. Sensitized TiO2 thin films in contact with the selected electrolytes (CFE, Z100 Iodolyte, 0.1 M LiClO4 (≥99%, Acros) in CH3CN) were kept in a quartz cell and oriented at an angle of ca. 45° with respect to the laser beam, in order to reflect scattered laser light away from the detector (an R3896 photomultiplier attached to an Acton triple grating monochromator where the 50 lines per mm grating was selected). A stack of two 532 nm notch filters placed at the entrance of the detector further eliminated residual 532 nm radiation scattered by the sample. The white light probe beam generated by a 150 W Xe lamp was orthogonal with respect to the laser source. Pulsing of the Xe lamp was optional and could be exploited within a time window lower than 400 μs in order to improve the S/N ratio of the transient signals. The probe light was filtered through a 380 nm cut off filter in order to remove most of the high frequency UV radiation before being focused into the sample by means of a cylindrical lens and being collected. Depending on the time frame to be explored, in order to optimize the S/N ratio of the oscillographic traces, various oscilloscope impedances were used, ranging from 50 Ω to 10 kΩ. Usually, 10–30 laser shots at a frequency of 0.2 Hz at each sampled wavelength were averaged. Each trace (ΔA vs. time) was fitted with a multiexponential decay function in order to further reduce stochastic noise and fluctuations and the resulting fitting function was used to build time resolved spectra.
Quantum chemical computations
The geometry optimization of the dye structures was performed with Gaussian 09 A230 at the restricted DFT-pbe0/DGDZVP level in vacuo with tight convergence criteria. TDDFT spectra (lowest 25 singlet transitions) were computed in CH3OH according to the polarizable dielectric continuum model (IEFCPM). Kohn Sham (KS) molecular orbitals were visualized as isodensity surfaces with Gaussview 5. Wavefunction analysis and EDDM of the optical transitions were obtained with Multiwfn 3.3.9.31 The oxidation potential of the lowest singlet excited state, whose SE00 spectroscopic energy is not experimentally accessible from steady state emission spectroscopy, was calculated from the lowest computed vertical excitation energy according to SEox* = Eox − SE00. The triplet excited state potential was calculated in a similar fashion by using the spectroscopic energy TE00 from the onset of the emission spectrum according to the 10% intensity criterion (Fig. S8†).32

 	Fig. 2  Absorption spectra and relevant data of Ru(II) tetrazolato dyes, 10−4 M, CH3OH.	 

 	Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the complexes D1–D4 loaded on transparent TiO2 films (ca. 8 μm thick) and sintered on FTO. The spectra were corrected against a background constituted by an otherwise identical undyed TiO2/FTO film.	 

 	Fig. 4  Experimental (black, blue, red and purple) vs. TDDFT/PBE0/DGDZVP computed optical transitions (vertical grey lines surmounted by red circles) in complexes D1–D4 (from left to right) compared to N719 (bottom right). Experimental spectra were normalized to the lowest absorption band, while vertical transitions were normalized to the most intense one.	 

 	Fig. 5  EDDMs resulting from the lowest energy optical excitation of complexes D1, D3 and D4 compared to N719 (left to right). The green surfaces depict the increased electron density (i.e. electron localization) while the blue surfaces indicate regions of depleted electron density (i.e. hole localization).	 

 	Fig. 6  HSOMO isodensity surfaces for the D1, D3 and D4 in the oxidized form compared with N719 (left to right respectively).	 

 	Fig. 7  Ground and excited state oxidation potentials of the dyes under consideration (data from Table 1 and Fig. S4†) compared to the TiO2 flat band potential in an organic solvent and to the equilibrium potential of a typical iodide based electrolyte.	 

 	Fig. 8  The ns–μs transient absorption difference spectra of the D-dyes loaded on transparent TiO2 thin films (Dyesol-18NRT) in contact with acetonitrile containing 0.1 M LiClO4. N719 is also reported as a comparison. Oscilloscope input impedance 350 Ohm. N719 is included as a comparison.	 

 	Fig. 9  
J–V curves collected under an AM 1.5G illumination (top left), under dark conditions (top right), IPCE spectra under short circuit (bottom left) and APCE spectra (APCE = IPCE/LHE) (bottom right) computed from data (bottom left) and Fig. 3. The APCE spectra were restricted to the spectral region enclosing the visible band maximum, where the error in the estimation of the LHE is the smallest.	 

 	Fig. 10  (left) Imaginary impedance plot of the EIS analyses and (right) calculated electron lifetime.
