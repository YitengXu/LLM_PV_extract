    , Accepted 1st September 2014First published on 2nd September 2014AbstractA new hydrogen evolving cobalt catalyst 1 based on a pentapyridine ligand has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic activity in the presence of a Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer and ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron donor has been screened in purely buffered aqueous solutions showing TONs and TOFs strongly dependent on both catalyst concentration and pH with the best results obtained at 50 μM 1 and at pH 4 (TON = 187, TOF = 8.1 min−1). The photochemical mechanism, as revealed by flash photolysis, involves reaction of the excited sensitizer with ascorbic acid to yield Ru(bpy)3+ as a primary photo-generated reductant, capable of electron transfer to 1 with a remarkable rate (bimolecular rate constant k = 5.7 (±0.7) × 109 M−1 s−1). For hydrogen generation, two one-electron photochemical reduction steps of 1 are needed along with hydride formation and protonation. Under the experimental conditions used, hydrogen evolution is mainly limited by partial decomposition of both the sensitizer and the catalyst. Moreover, accumulation of the oxidation product of the ascorbic acid donor, dehydroascorbic acid, is observed to strongly decrease the hydrogen production yield. As shown by flash photolysis, this species is capable of quenching the reduced ruthenium species (k = 4.4 (±0.5) × 107 M−1 s−1) thus competing with electron transfer to the catalyst.
Introduction
Artificial photosynthesis, i.e. conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels, is one of the most attractive and promising research fields which can potentially provide an alternative and renewable energy supply in order to tackle the global energy issue of the current century.1 Among several possibilities, one of the most challenging reaction schemes is represented by water splitting with formation of hydrogen as a clean and renewable fuel. To this aim, a large amount of effort has been devoted worldwide to the discovery and development of molecular catalysts for photoinduced water oxidation2–8 and reduction9–14 and for their integration into more complex supramolecular assemblies.9,13c,15–17 As far as the hydrogen evolving reaction (HER) is concerned, during the last few years particular attention has been given to cobalt complexes as convenient noble-metal-free catalysts. Among these, macrocyclic cobalt complexes such as porphyrins11a,d and cobaloximes9,18 have been particularly investigated. Although the activity of such compounds in sacrificial cycles was quite remarkable, the stability under turnover conditions, mainly due to catalyst self-hydrogenation,9c was recognized as one of the major drawbacks for this class of compounds. More recently, polypyridine cobalt complexes have emerged as competent catalysts for the HER,19–26 combining both stability under photocatalytic conditions and outstanding activity. One of the first cobalt polypyridine complexes was introduced by Long and Chang19a taking advantage of differently functionalized pentapyridine ligands which were studied in sacrificial photocatalytic cycles using either Ru(bpy)32+ or GaP nanowires as the photosensitizer and ascorbic acid as the reductant. Subsequently, Webster and Zhao reported the use of a pentadentate ligand, namely the DPA-bpy, for the construction of a molecular cobalt catalyst achieving TONs up to 4400 upon continuous visible irradiation in the presence of the standard Ru(bpy)32+/ascorbic acid couple.20 Other cobalt complexes based on different pentadentate ligands were also prepared by Castellano, Long, and Chang,19b Alberto,22 and Lloret-Fillol21 and were studied for photoinduced hydrogen production in the presence of ruthenium-, rhenium-, and iridium-based photosensitizers, respectively, with remarkable results in terms of both turnover numbers (TONs) and frequencies (TOFs). Several cobalt complexes based on the 1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine pentadentate ligand were prepared by Wang by suitably changing the axial ligand and studied in light activated experiments with Ru(bpy)32+ and ascorbic acid as the photosensitizer and the sacrificial electron donor, respectively.24 In this report an enhanced photocatalytic activity was observed in the presence of external added NaCl which was ascribed to an “unexpected role” of one of the pyridines of the ligand capable of dissociating from the cobalt center, thus enabling and stabilizing the formation of the cobalt hydride catalytic intermediate. Tetradentate ligands based on polypyridine/amine moieties were also employed by Castellano, Long, and Chang,19c Lomoth and Ott,25 and Thummel23 for the preparation of cobalt complexes showing remarkable activity in photocatalytic experiments in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer and ascorbic acid as the sacrificial electron donor. Finally, a tetradentate quaterpyridine ligand was used by Lau26 for the preparation of a cobalt catalyst capable of efficient hydrogen production in a mixed acetonitrile/water environment by taking advantage of a cyclometalated iridium complex and triethanolamine as the photosensitizer and the sacrificial electron donor, respectively.
Herein we report on a deep investigation of cobalt(II) complex 1 (Chart 1), based on the 6-(bis(bis-2-pyridyl)-methoxymethane)pyridine pentadentate ligand and a chloride to complete the octahedral coordination of the metal. The related aquo complex was recently reported by Berlinguette27 as an active electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolving reaction (OER). Electrochemical investigations and photocatalytic studies in the presence of the standard Ru(bpy)32+/ascorbic acid couple have been performed. Additional mechanistic studies of the photocatalytic system have been also undertaken to elucidate some key features of the HER mechanism. This is one of the few examples26 of how the same metal–ligand combination can be used to trigger water splitting both at the oxidative and reductive levels.

Results and discussion
Electrochemical investigation
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of 1 (1 mM) in acetonitrile solution (0.1 M LiClO4) in both anodic and cathodic regions shows the presence of two redox processes involving the cobalt center (Fig. 1a). Upon anodic scan, a poorly reversible process (ΔE = ca. 300 mV) with a potential of E1/2 = 0.49 V vs. SCE can be observed and assigned to the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple. Upon cathodic scan a poorly reversible wave can be detected at a potential of E1/2 = −1.31 V vs. SCE which can be ascribed to the metal-centered Co(II)/Co(I) redox pair. Addition of different aliquots of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) triggers the appearance of a catalytic wave due to proton reduction which precedes the Co(II)/Co(I) process and increases in intensity with increasing TFA concentration (Fig. 1). This clearly establishes that hydrogen production catalyzed by 1 requires the reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) and protonation, yielding a Co(III)–H intermediate, occurring as a single, concerted PCET process.28 Protonation of Co(I) is likely to occur either after releasing the apical chloride anion or, as tentatively suggested by Wang,24 after detachment of one of the pyridines of the pentadentate ligand. Analysis of the onset of the catalytic wave as a function of TFA concentration allows shedding more light on the catalytic mechanism of hydrogen production by 1. In particular, when the concentration of the external acid is kept lower than 5 mM (Fig. 1a) the onset of the catalytic wave remains almost constant at ca. −1.00 V vs. SCE, meaning that under these conditions, an additional reduction of the Co(III)–H intermediate is most probably required before hydrogen evolution.28 On the other hand, when the TFA concentration is increased up to 16 mM (Fig. 1b) the onset of the catalytic wave shifts progressively towards less negative potentials. Under these conditions the proton concentration is likely high enough to cause direct protonation of the Co(III)–H and thus catalytic hydrogen evolution by 1 may also take place through a different mechanism.10d,28 The overall set of processes is summarized in Scheme 1.

As a final remark on the electrochemical experiments, a plot of the ic/ip ratio vs. TFA concentration (Fig. 1c) is linear and this may indicate a second-order dependence of the hydrogen evolving reaction on the proton concentration.29,30
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The capability of 1 to foster hydrogen evolution in light-activated experiments was tested by continuous visible irradiation (175 W xenon arc lamp, cut-off at λ > 400 nm) of 1 M acetate buffer solutions at pH 4 (5 mL) containing different concentrations of 1 in the presence of 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)3Cl2 as the photosensitizer and 0.1 M ascorbic acid as the sacrificial electron donor and checking the headspace of the reactor by gas chromatography (see the Experimental section for additional details). The pH value was chosen by literature comparison19c,20,22–25 and experimental evidence (vide infra).
Photocatalytic hydrogen production was indeed observed (Fig. 2): it generally occurs at an almost constant rate, depending on the catalyst concentration, between 0 and 20–30 min (linear behavior), and levels off after approximately 1 hour of continuous irradiation (plateau). Notably, in the hydrogen evolution kinetics a small induction period (a few minutes) is also present, which can be reasonably ascribed to the required lag-time so that an appreciable fraction of the catalytically-active doubly-reduced species of 1 is accumulated in the stationary state before a constant hydrogen production rate is established.10c,11d,15b Going more into details, significant photocatalytic activity is detected when the concentration of 1 is kept higher than 10 μM achieving turnover numbers (TONs) after 3 h irradiation between 100 and 187 and turnover frequencies (TOFs) in the range 3.9–8.1 min−1 (Table S1†) with the highest value (187 and 8.1 min−1, respectively) obtained at 50 μM 1.
 Fig. 2  Hydrogen evolution kinetics obtained upon continuous visible irradiation (λ > 400 nm) of 1 M acetate buffer pH 4 solutions (5 mL) containing 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, 0.1 M ascorbic acid, and 1 at 10 μM (black trace), 25 μM (red trace), 50 μM (green trace), 75 μM (blue trace), and 100 μM (orange trace) concentrations. 
Comparisons between different photocatalytic systems in terms of TON and TOF should always be taken with caution, because of possible differences in the experimental conditions used. Within these limitations, however, a comparison of the hydrogen evolving activities obtained with photocatalytic systems reported in the literature based on cobalt polypyridine catalysts, with Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer and ascorbic acid as the sacrificial electron donor,19–26 shows that 1 is more active than both the pentapyridine cobalt complexes reported by Long and Chang,19a producing ≤20 μmol of H2 at 50 μM concentration, and the pentadentate complexes reported by Wang,24 which under the best conditions give only 12 μmol of H2 at 50 μM concentration, but is less active than the pentadentate cobalt complex reported by Webster and Zhao,20 yielding a TON of 450 at 50 μM concentration. Still higher activity with respect to 1 was also observed for some of the cobalt complexes studied by Castellano, Long, and Chang19b,c for which TONs up to ca. 2000 were measured at 20 μM concentration.
In contrast to what happens for some of the polypyridine catalysts mentioned before, in the present system the TONs are relatively insensitive to catalyst concentration (Fig. 2 and Table S1†). In particular, the sharp increases in TON at low catalyst concentration observed for other systems19b,c,20 are not obtained here. This can be in part explained by considering the different irradiation source (and thus the different power) used in those experiments, usually monochromatic LEDs at 450 nm,19b,c,20 compared to the white light used herein. It is indeed very likely that, at high light intensities and low catalyst concentration, the rate of production of reduced photosensitizer (see below for a mechanistic discussion) is too fast relative to electron scavenging by the catalyst. This may cause the build-up of substantial stationary-state concentrations of reduced sensitizer, with enhancement of unproductive routes involving the chromophore.§
At 50 μM 1, the hydrogen evolving activity is also observed to be strongly dependent on pH (Table S2 and Fig. S1 of the ESI†) with the best values in terms of TON obtained at pH 4 and 5 (187 and 205, respectively), but with a slightly larger TOF achieved at pH 4 (8.1 min−1 at pH 4 and 7.4 min−1 at pH 5). This is likely the result of several factors playing together towards hydrogen generation such as (i) the stability of the sensitizer under continuous irradiation, likely related to protonation of its reduced form,11c decreasing with increasing acidity (Fig. S2 of ESI†), (ii) the thermodynamic driving force for the HER, and (iii) the protonation of the Co(I) species which is more favoured at lower pH.
Concerning the mechanism, two photochemical pathways are in principle available to the excited sensitizer for the reduction of 1 and eventual hydrogen production: (i) an oxidative quenching route,10b,g,13c,15a involving first oxidative quenching of the Ru(bpy)32+ triplet state by the catalyst, followed by hole shift to the ascorbic acid electron donor, or (ii) a reductive quenching route,15b,18–25 where the excited sensitizer is primarily quenched by the donor and the thus-formed Ru(bpy)3+ reductant subsequently transfers the electron to the catalyst. In order to check for such possibilities, Stern–Volmer analyses of the Ru(bpy)32+ triplet state quenching by both 1 and ascorbic acid were performed. It is found that in 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) the emission of the Ru(bpy)32+ excited state is quenched by 1 (Fig. S3 of ESI†) with a bimolecular rate constant k = 3.1 × 108 M−1 s−1,¶ and by the ascorbic acid donor (Fig. S4†) with a bimolecular rate constant k = 1.0 × 107 M−1 s−1, consistent with previous findings.20b However, despite the difference of one order of magnitude in rate constants, under the photocatalytic conditions the concentrations of the sacrificial electron donor and catalyst are such that reductive quenching by the ascorbic acid donor (0.1 M, pseudo-first order rate k = 1.0 × 106 s−1) dominates over oxidative quenching by 1 (10–100 μM, pseudo-first order rate k = 3.1–31 × 103 s−1). The electron transfer process from the reduced sensitizer to the catalyst can be easily followed by laser flash photolysis experiments.11c,15b,19c,20b,25 Upon excitation of 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solutions containing 100 μM Ru(bpy)32+ and 0.1 M ascorbic acid, formation of the reduced Ru(bpy)3+ species, occurring in a few hundred ns after electron transfer from the donor to the triplet excited state, is observed from the build-up of the characteristic absorption at 510 nm (Fig. 3a).31 This species in the absence of any catalyst undergoes slow bimolecular recombination with the oxidized ascorbate (Fig. 3b). When 1 is introduced into solution similar spectroscopic variations are observed; however, the decay of the 510 nm absorption becomes more rapid due to electron transfer from Ru(bpy)3+ to the catalyst and under pseudo-first order kinetic conditions (Fig. 3c) the bimolecular rate constant for this electron transfer can be estimated as k = 5.7 (±0.7) × 109 M−1 s−1.|| This value is considerably high, close to the diffusion limit, and falls within the same order of magnitude of bimolecular electron transfer rates from the reduced Ru(bpy)3+ species to polypyridine cobalt complexes19c,20b,25 and to a cationic cobalt porphyrin.11c It should be pointed out that the electron transfer rate from the reduced sensitizer to 1 is one of the most important parameters affecting the photocatalytic performance. A fast electron scavenging by the catalyst is indeed required in order to minimize alternative decomposition pathways involving the reduced species of the chromophore (one of the major reasons for the ceasing of the hydrogen evolving activity).15b,20

After the first photochemical reduction step, before hydrogen evolution, protonation of the thus-formed reduced species of the catalyst is required yielding a Co(III)–H catalytic intermediate. On the basis of the above discussed electrochemical data (Fig. 1 and Scheme 1) it is likely that at the pH 4 used in the photocatalytic experiments an additional reduction to a Co(II)–hydride species may take place. The first-order dependence of the initial rate of hydrogen production vs. catalyst concentration (Fig. S5 of the ESI†) is as expected for a heterolytic mechanistic pathway of hydrogen evolution.10d,e
As far as the turnover limiting reactions are concerned, decomposition of both the Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer and 1 can be assessed on the basis of the following experimental results. Upon addition of either Ru(bpy)32+ (0.5 mM) or 1 (100 μM) to a photolysed mixture (after 1 h photolysis of a 1 M acetate buffer solution at pH 4 containing 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, 100 μM 1, and 0.1 M ascorbic acid) very low hydrogen evolving activity is recovered, 6% and 12% in terms of TON, respectively (Fig. 4). On the other hand, a larger increase in hydrogen production is obtained if both catalyst and sensitizer are added to the photolysed mixture (Fig. 4), consistent with the partial decomposition of both components before their addition. In the latter case, however, the hydrogen evolving capability of the system is not restored completely, with an improvement of only 23% of the initial activity.
 Fig. 4  Effect of addition of different components after 1 h photolysis on a 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 100 μM 1, 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, and 0.1 M ascorbic acid (orange line): addition of 0.1 M ascorbic acid (black line), 100 μM 1 (red line), 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+ (blue line), and both 100 μM 1 and 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+ (green line). 
Several reasons may in principle account for this result. The consumption of the sacrificial electron donor can be definitely ruled out by experimental evidence (Fig. 4, black trace) and considering the overall hydrogen yield after 1 h irradiation. Another source of inefficiency could be ascribed to the formation of decomposition products of the Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer, likely involving either protonation of the reduced bipyridine or dechelation of a bpy ligand with the insertion of ascorbate19c or acetate,20a competing in the absorption of light with the fresh, undegraded sensitizer.19c
It must also be pointed out that once ascorbic acid is oxidized by photoinduced electron transfer with Ru(bpy)32+ the one-electron oxidized species undergoes disproportionation, producing ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid.32 When substantially high amounts of hydrogen are produced, as under the experimental conditions of Fig. 4, a substantial amount of dehydroascorbic acid is produced as well.** As this oxidized product accumulates in solution, it may behave as a quencher of the reduced Ru(bpy)3+ species, thus inhibiting electron transfer to the catalyst and therefore hydrogen production. As a matter of fact, the hydrogen evolving activity of the photocatalytic mixture based on 100 μM 1, 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, and 0.1 M ascorbic acid in 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) was found to be markedly affected by the addition of external dehydroascorbic acid (Fig. 5a). At 10 mM dehydroascorbic acid concentration (which is roughly the amount of product formed without its external addition under the present experimental conditions) the final TON achieved after 3 h irradiation is ca. 20% of that obtained without external addition, correlating well with the poor recovery in hydrogen evolving activity observed after addition of both Ru(bpy)32+ and 1 after 1 h photolysis (see above, Fig. 4). Additional, direct experimental evidence of this short-circuit by the dehydroascorbic acid side-product is obtained from laser flash photolysis experiments (Fig. 5b) where, in the absence of any catalyst added, the transient absorption at 510 nm of the reduced Ru(bpy)3+ species, produced via photoinduced electron transfer from ascorbic acid to the triplet excited state of the chromophore, is observed to decay more rapidly when external dehydroascorbic acid is added. Under pseudo-first order kinetic conditions, estimation of the bimolecular rate constant of this short-circuiting process can be performed, yielding k = 4.4 (±0.5) × 107 M−1 s−1. This rate constant is considerably lower (by ca. two orders of magnitude) than that observed for the electron transfer from Ru(bpy)3+ to 1, but the process may become important as long as hydrogen is produced and dehydroascorbic acid is stepwise accumulated. The whole set of primary photochemical processes occurring upon excitation of Ru(bpy)32+ within the photocatalytic mixture is summarized in Scheme 2.
 Fig. 5  (a) Effect of added external dehydroascorbic acid (0–10 mM) on the hydrogen evolution kinetics of a 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 100 μM 1, 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, and 0.1 M ascorbic acid; (b) kinetic traces at 510 nm obtained by laser flash photolysis (excitation at 355 nm) on 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 1 mM Ru(bpy)32+ and 0.1 M ascorbic acid, in the absence (black trace) and in the presence of 5 mM (brown trace) or 10 mM (light blue trace) dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The difference in the prompt concentration of Ru(bpy)3+ at different dehydroascorbic acid contents is mainly related to competition in 355 nm excitation light absorption between Ru(bpy)32+ and dehydroascorbic acid. 
 Scheme 2  Summary of the primary photochemical processes occurring upon light irradiation of the photolysis mixture containing Ru(bpy)32+, 1, and ascorbic acid. The following abbreviations have been used: Ru(II) = Ru(bpy)32+, *Ru(II) = *Ru(bpy)32+, Ru(I) = Ru(bpy)3+, AscH− = ascorbic acid, DHA = dehydroascorbic acid, Co(II) = 1, and Co(I) = 1−. 
Altogether, these results suggest that ascorbic acid is less than ideal as a “sacrificial” electron donor and that the use of the standard Ru(bpy)32+/ascorbic acid pair is probably not most suitable to evaluate univocally the hydrogen evolving activity of a molecular catalyst in homogeneous photocatalytic systems, in particular under conditions where copious amounts of hydrogen are produced.†† Similar findings were also pointed out recently by Alberto33 for a system involving a cobalt catalyst, a rhenium(I) polypyridine sensitizer, and ascorbic acid. In that case the shortcut process, by which the photogenerated reduced rhenium species was intercepted by the dehydroascorbic acid, proceeds with a slightly slower rate (bimolecular rate constant k = ca. 107 M−1 s−1),33 most likely as a result of the reduced rhenium species (−1.13 V vs. SCE)34 being a less powerful reductant than the reduced ruthenium species (−1.28 V vs. SCE).35
As a final remark, oxidation of the reduced Co(I) species by both the transiently formed oxidized ascorbate and the accumulated dehydroascorbic acid product are other side-reactions potentially interfering in an efficient hydrogen production. In this respect, the choice of the right pH, affecting the protonation equilibria and rates of the Co(I) species, is a fundamental requirement for achieving a higher photocatalytic efficiency. However, the decrease of the pH to lower values is limited by the decreased stability of the reduced sensitizer under increased acidic conditions (see above and Fig. S2†).11c
Experimental section
Materials
Acetonitrile for electrochemical experiments was of electrochemical grade. Milli-Q Ultrapure water and related buffer solutions were used for the spectroscopic and photolysis experiments. Ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid, and Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and were used as received. All the other chemicals were of reagent grade quality, and were used as received.
Synthesis
The 2,6-(bis(bis-2-pyridyl)-methoxymethane)pyridine (Py5) ligand was synthesized and purified according to literature procedures.36 [Co(II)(Py5)Cl]Cl (1) was obtained by reaction of equimolar amounts of Py5 and CoCl2·6H2O in refluxing methanol under an Ar atmosphere following a slightly adapted literature procedure.37 See also ESI† for additional details.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a PC-interfaced Eco Chemie Autolab/Pgstat 30 potentiostat. Argon-purged sample solutions in acetonitrile, containing 0.1 M LiClO4, were used. A conventional three-electrode cell assembly was adopted: a saturated calomel electrode (SCE Amel) and a platinum electrode, both separated from the test solution by a glass frit, were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively; a glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode.
Steady-state absorption/emission measurements
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-570 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were taken on a Horiba-Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorimeter, equipped with a Hamamatsu R3896 tube.
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis
Nanosecond transient measurements were performed with a custom laser spectrometer comprised of a Continuum Surelite II Nd:YAG laser (FWHM 6–8 ns) with frequency doubled (532 nm, 330 mJ) or tripled (355 nm, 160 mJ) option, an Applied Photophysics xenon light source including a mod. 720 150 W lamp housing, a mod. 620 power controlled lamp supply and a mod. 03–102 arc lamp pulser. Laser excitation was provided at 90° with respect to the white light probe beam. Light transmitted by the sample was focused on the entrance slit of a 300 mm focal length Acton SpectraPro 2300i triple grating, a flat field, double exit monochromator equipped with a photomultiplier detector (Hamamatsu R3896) and a Princeton Instruments PIMAX II gated intensified CCD camera, using a RB Gen II intensifier, a ST133 controller and a PTG pulser. Signals from the photomultiplier (kinetic traces) were processed by means of a LeCroy 9360 (600 MHz, 5 Gs s−1) digital oscilloscope.
Photolysis apparatus
The hydrogen evolution experiments were carried out upon continuous visible light irradiation with a 175 W xenon CERMAX arc-lamp (cut-off filter at 400 nm) of a reactor (a 10 mm pathlength pyrex glass cuvette with headspace obtained from a round-bottom flask) containing the solution. The measuring cell is sealed during the photoreaction: the head to which the cell is attached has indeed four ports, closed with Swagelok® connections; two of them are part of a closed loop involving a GC gas inlet and a sample vent in order to analyze the headspace content without an appreciable gas consumption, and the other two are for the degassing procedure (input and output).
Gas chromatography
The gas phase of the reaction vessel was analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 490 microGC equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column (10 m), a thermal conductivity detector, and using Ar as the carrier gas. 5 mL from the headspace of the reactor are sampled by the internal GC pump and 200 nL are injected into the column maintained at 60 °C for separation and detection of gases. The unused gas sample is then reintroduced into the reactor in order to minimize its consumption along the whole photolysis. The amount of hydrogen was quantified by the external calibration method. This procedure was performed, prior to analysis, through a galvanostatic (typically 1 mA) electrolysis of a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution in an analogous cell (same volume) equipped with two Pt wires sealed in the glass at the bottom of the cell. A 100% Faradaic efficiency was assumed leading to a linear correlation between the amount of H2 evolved at the cathode and the electrolysis time.
Hydrogen evolution experiments
In a typical experiment, samples of 5 mL were prepared in 20 mL scintillation vials starting from a Ru(bpy)32+ mother solution (5 mM), and further adding ascorbic acid (as a solid) and 1 (0.4 mM mother solution). The solution was then put in the reactor, degassed by bubbling Ar for 20 min, and thermostated at 15 °C. The cell was then irradiated and the solution was continually stirred during the photolysis. The gas phase of the reaction was analyzed through GC and the amount of hydrogen was quantified.
Conclusions
A new hydrogen evolving catalyst 1 has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic activity towards the HER in the presence of a Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer and ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron donor has been screened. In purely buffered aqueous solutions TONs and TOFs strongly dependent on both catalyst concentration and pH are observed with the best results at 50 μM 1 and at pH 4 (TON = 187 and TOF = 8.1 min−1). Hydrogen production is triggered by excitation of the Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer which reacts at the excited state level with the ascorbic acid donor yielding a photogenerated reductant capable of electron transfer to 1 with a remarkable rate (bimolecular rate constant k = 5.7 (±0.7) × 109 M−1 s−1). Hydrogen evolution is mainly limited by partial decomposition of both the sensitizer and the catalyst. Moreover, when high amounts of hydrogen are produced, the accumulation of dehydroascorbic acid, i.e., the oxidation product of the ascorbic acid donor, namely, is observed to strongly affect hydrogen production yield. This species quenches the reduced ruthenium species (bimolecular rate constant k = 4.4 (±0.5) × 107 M−1 s−1), thus preventing electron transfer to the catalyst. This evidence points out that a straightforward evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of a molecular catalyst within homogeneous systems involving ascorbic acid can be misleading without a complete knowledge of the overall phenomena occurring within the three-component donor/sensitizer/acceptor system.

 	Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammetry at 298 K of a 1 mM 1 in 0.1 M LiClO4 acetonitrile solution (black trace) upon addition of (a) 0–5 mM and (b) 6–16 mM TFA. Working electrode: glassy carbon (7 mm2 surface area), counter electrode: Pt, reference electrode: SCE, scan rate 100 mV s−1. (c) Plot of ic/ipvs. TFA concentration.	 

 	Scheme 1  Possible catalytic mechanisms of hydrogen production by 1: low TFA concentration (solid lines) and high TFA concentration (dashed lines).	 

 	Fig. 2  Hydrogen evolution kinetics obtained upon continuous visible irradiation (λ > 400 nm) of 1 M acetate buffer pH 4 solutions (5 mL) containing 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, 0.1 M ascorbic acid, and 1 at 10 μM (black trace), 25 μM (red trace), 50 μM (green trace), 75 μM (blue trace), and 100 μM (orange trace) concentrations.	 

 	Fig. 3  Laser flash photolysis experiments (excitation at 355 nm, FWHM 6–8 ns): transient spectra obtained upon excitation of a 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 0.1 mM Ru(bpy)32+ and 0.1 M ascorbic acid at (a) 0.01–0.50 μs and (b) 1–100 μs time delays; (c) kinetic analysis of the Ru(bpy)3+ decay at 510 nm in the absence (black trace) and in the presence of 25 μM (blue trace) and 50 μM 1 (green trace); (inset) plot of the pseudo-first order rate vs. catalyst concentration for the estimation of the bimolecular rate constant (slope).	 

 	Fig. 4  Effect of addition of different components after 1 h photolysis on a 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 100 μM 1, 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, and 0.1 M ascorbic acid (orange line): addition of 0.1 M ascorbic acid (black line), 100 μM 1 (red line), 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+ (blue line), and both 100 μM 1 and 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+ (green line).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Effect of added external dehydroascorbic acid (0–10 mM) on the hydrogen evolution kinetics of a 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 100 μM 1, 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+, and 0.1 M ascorbic acid; (b) kinetic traces at 510 nm obtained by laser flash photolysis (excitation at 355 nm) on 1 M acetate buffer (pH 4) solution containing 1 mM Ru(bpy)32+ and 0.1 M ascorbic acid, in the absence (black trace) and in the presence of 5 mM (brown trace) or 10 mM (light blue trace) dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The difference in the prompt concentration of Ru(bpy)3+ at different dehydroascorbic acid contents is mainly related to competition in 355 nm excitation light absorption between Ru(bpy)32+ and dehydroascorbic acid.	 

 	Scheme 2  Summary of the primary photochemical processes occurring upon light irradiation of the photolysis mixture containing Ru(bpy)32+, 1, and ascorbic acid. The following abbreviations have been used: Ru(II) = Ru(bpy)32+, *Ru(II) = *Ru(bpy)32+, Ru(I) = Ru(bpy)3+, AscH− = ascorbic acid, DHA = dehydroascorbic acid, Co(II) = 1, and Co(I) = 1−.
