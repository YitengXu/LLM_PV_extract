    , Accepted 27th November 2017First published on 28th November 2017AbstractExcitation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by photons possessing energy higher than the band-gap creates a hot electron–hole pair, which releases its excess energy as waste heat or under certain conditions (when hν > 2Eg) produces multiple excitons. Extraction of these hot carriers and multiple excitons is one of the key strategies for enhancing the efficiency of QD-based photovoltaic devices. However, this is a difficult task as competing carrier cooling and relaxation of multiple excitons (through Auger recombination) are ultrafast processes. Herein, we study the potential of all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br) as harvesters of these short-lived species from photo-excited CdTe QDs. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements show CsPbX3 mediated extraction of both hot and thermalized electrons of the QDs (under a low pump power) and (under a high pump fluence) extraction of multiple excitons prior to their Auger assisted recombination. A faster timescale of thermalized electron transfer (∼2 ps) and a higher extraction efficiency of hot electrons (∼60%) are observed in the presence of CsPbBr3. These observations demonstrate the potential of all-inorganic perovskite NCs in the extraction of these short-lived energy rich species implying that complexes of the QDs and perovskite NCs are better suited for improving the efficiency of QD-sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
Photons possessing energy higher than the band-gap of QDs create hot carriers, which cool down to the band-edge by releasing their excess energy as waste heat. When this excess energy is more than the band-gap of QDs, then it can produce one or more additional band-edge excitons. This generation of multiple excitons from the absorption of one high energy photon (hν > 2Eg) is termed as multiexciton generation (MEG).1 These multiexcitons relax to a single-exciton state in a sequential manner (from N number of excitons to N − 1…to 1) through the Auger recombination process in which one exciton recombines by transferring its energy to another charge carrier (residing in the same QD).2 This charge carrier further relaxes to a band-edge state by releasing its excess energy as waste heat.2 Harvesting of these hot carriers and multiple excitons in a useable form can boost the efficiency of QD-solar cells by many fold.3–8 Intense research efforts have been made in the recent past to understand the mechanism, photon energy threshold and the efficiency of the MEG process along with the dynamics of exciton–exciton annihilation in several QDs.2,9–14 The major obstacles to the extraction of hot carriers and multiexcitons are the ultrafast nature of carrier cooling (<1 ps) and Auger recombination (10–100 ps) processes. While the hot carriers of the QDs have been extracted by forming a composite with metal nanoparticles,15–18 the extraction of multiexcitons is mainly limited to few modelled QD–electron acceptor (organic molecular system) complexes.19–22
Lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) nanocrystals (NCs) are currently the focus of attention due to their appealing properties such as, long electron–hole diffusion length and high charge-carrier mobility, tunable band-gap and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (60–80%), which make them suitable efficient light emitting diodes and a low threshold lasing medium.23–26 These halide-based perovskites not only function as a light absorber in solar energy conversion devices, but can also help in electron/hole conduction.27,28 Chung et al. have shown that CsSnX3 can be used as a hole transporting material to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.29 It is also observed that PbS QDs assist in the improvement of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells by extending the absorption range in the near-IR region and also serving as hole transporting materials.30,31 A recent report shows that a thin shell of CH3NH3PbI3 on PbS QDs improves the efficiency of the QD solar cells by passivating the trap states.32 Interestingly, the role of the individual constituents in these composites is not critically assessed by studying the carrier dynamics.
The strategic integration of multiple semiconductor materials with different band-gaps not only helps extending the light absorption range but also improves the flow of charge carriers, which is essential for light induced applications.33–35 Keeping this in mind, we explore whether/how a low band gap material of CdTe interacts with the higher band gap cesium based all-inorganic perovskite NCs by monitoring the ultrafast formation and recovery dynamics of the excitonic bleach of QDs in the absence and presence of CsPbX3 NCs employing the femtosecond transient absorption technique. We show that CsPbX3 NCs extract hot and cold electrons from photoexcited QDs in a timescale of <100 fs and 2–4 ps, respectively. At a higher excitation fluence, it is observed that CsPbX3 can also extract the biexcitons of CdTe QDs before their nonradiative Auger recombination process. These findings reveal for the first time that CsPbX3 can be used as a potential electron acceptor for improvement of the efficiency of QD-sensitized solar cells by extracting hot carriers and multiexcitons.
2. Results and discussion
CdTe QDs were synthesized by injecting a solution of Te in trioctylphosphine into a mixture of CdO and oleic acid maintained at 310 °C, while CsPbX3 NCs were synthesized by injecting Cs-oleate into a mixture of either PbCl2 or PbBr2 and oleylamine, and oleic acid at 185 °C (details in Experimental section).23,36 High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CdTe QDs show monodisperse spherical particles of diameter 4 ± 0.5 nm, whereas CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 show a cubic perovskite structure of a mean edge length of 10–11 nm.
The absorption and PL spectra of the colloidal dispersions of QDs and NCs in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 1. The first excitonic absorption peak position (∼652 nm) of CdTe QDs is found to be consistent with their size obtained from TEM images. CdTe QDs show a characteristic band-edge PL centred at 662 nm. CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 show sharp excitonic absorption peaks at 400 and 500 nm, respectively, and their respective PL peaks are observed at 406 and 510 nm. The small Stokes-shifted PL (6–10 nm) observed for the samples is consistent with the literature.23,36

(F) Change in the PL spectra of CdTe QDs in the presence of CsPbBr3 NCs under selective photoexcitation (λex = 530 nm) of CdTe QDs. 
The absorption spectrum of the CdTe-CsPbBr3 complex shows additive spectral features of the individual components lacking any additional band arising from the ground state electronic interaction. Interestingly, one observes progressive quenching of the PL band centering around 662 nm of CdTe QDs with an increase in the concentration of CsPbBr3 NCs. PL quenching is also observed for CdTe-CsPbCl3, but is less pronounced in this case (Fig. S1, ESI†).
To understand the role of perovskite NCs, we have looked into their valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) potentials, which are available in the literature37 and estimated the excited state oxidation (CdTe*[1Se, 1Sh] → e− + CdTe [1Sh]) and reduction (CdTe*[1Se, 1Sh] → h+ + CdTe [1Se]) potentials of the QDs (−1.54 V (NHE) and 0.32 V (NHE), respectively) following reported procedures.38,39 These potentials are pictorially depicted in Fig. 2 for a qualitative assessment of the charge/energy transfer processes. This energy level diagram (Fig. 2) shows that while energy transfer from photoexcited CdTe to higher band-gap materials is not feasible, the electron transfer (not the hole transfer) to the perovskite NCs is indeed energetically feasible and this process is more favourable for CdTe-CsPbBr3 compared to CdTe-CsPbCl3.

2.1. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy

Single-exciton dissociation. 
To verify the charge transfer process from QDs to perovskites, we have carried out femtosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements on bare CdTe QDs, and the CdTe-CsPbBr3 and CdTe-CsPbCl3 complexes through the selective photoexcitation (at 520 nm) of CdTe QDs (Fig. 3). All these TA measurements were performed under the same experimental conditions with a low pump fluence (average number of excitons per particle, <N> to be ∼0.15) ensuring negligible probability of multiexciton formation. The TA spectra of CdTe QDs are characterized by a broad negative signal (bleach) with a peak at ∼652 nm, which matches the first excitonic band of the QDs. The recovery of this bleach signal is found to be slow; only 26% of it is recovered in 1.5 ns. However, in the presence of CsPbBr3 or CsPbCl3, though the spectral features remain almost the same, the bleach amplitude is found to be substantially lower indicating a reduction of photoexcited carriers, and also the recovery of the bleach signal becomes faster (Fig. 3). Between the two systems, the reduction in bleach amplitude at an early time-scale is more pronounced (60%) for QD-CsPbBr3 compared to QD-CsPbCl3 (25%) (Fig. 3E) under identical experimental conditions.
 Fig. 3  TA spectra at the indicated delay times following 520 nm excitation of the bare CdTe QDs (A), CdTe-CsPbBr3 (B) and CdTe-CsPbCl3 (C) complexes. (D) Excitonic bleach formation dynamics (monitored at 655 nm) with and without CsPbBr3 NCs. The bleach recovery dynamics of CdTe QDs without and with CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 at a shorter time scale along with the absolute bleach amplitude (E) and at a longer delay time with the normalized bleach amplitude (F). 
As excitonic bleach in CdTe QDs is governed mainly by the electron dynamics due to the heavier effective mass of the hole  and the higher degeneracy of the VB (compared to CB),40–42 520 nm excitation (which amounts to 1.25 times the band-gap of QDs) produces electrons well above the band-edge state; it is evident that the sub-picosecond bleach formation time (∼265 fs for bare QDs) represents the cooling time of the hot electrons. The acceleration of this formation time to <100 and 145 fs in the presence of CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3, respectively, (Fig. 3D, Table 1 and Fig. S2, ESI†) and the reduction of the bleach amplitude indicate transfer of the hot electrons (<100 fs timescale) from the QDs to the perovskites prior to their cooling to the band-edge state. It is also evident that CsPbBr3 extracts the hot electrons faster and more efficiently (60% of the photoexcited electrons) compared to 25% in the case of CsPbCl3. It may be noted that this approach of probing the hot electron transfer (ET) process is similar to those found in the literature.16–18

As far as the bleach recovery is concerned, this dynamics is found to be bi-exponential consisting of a short (∼68.5 ps) and a long (>1000 ps) component (Table 1). The short component is assigned to carrier trapping (not to any multiexcitons) as the trapping time constant is comparable to that observed for oleic acid capped CdTe QDs and this time component is not affected by the lowering of the pump fluence.43 The long component clearly represents the kinetics of the electron–hole recombination process. A faster bleach recovery in the presence of CsPbBr3 or CsPbCl3 (with the former more effective) suggests ET from CdTe QDs to perovskite NCs (Fig. 3 and Table 1). A similar bi-exponential bleach recovery kinetics is obtained for the two complexes. Considering ET as the only additional process for these complexes, the apparent rate of this process is estimated from the decrease in the short time-component of the bleach recovery (using eqn (1)).44 (1)
The ET rate is found to be faster by a factor of ∼3 for the QD–CsPbBr3 complexes (5.7 × 1011 S−1) compared to the QD–CsPbCl3 (2.0 × 1011 S−1) complexes. This finding is consistent with our steady state data and the band-gap alignment of the species shown in Fig. 2. The long component of the recovery dynamics is due to back ET from the perovskites to the QDs (recombination process between the electrons in the CB of perovskites and holes lying in the VB of QDs). The fact that no bleach signal of perovskites is observed following the ET process, is mainly due to strong absorption of the QDs in the same spectral region. This kind of situation is quite common for such complexes and it is most often that the ET process is probed by monitoring the bleach recovery of the QDs.44,45
A recent report shows that the performance of PbSe QD-sensitized solar cells can be improved by CsPbBr3 due to the passivation of the surface trap states or better hole transportation.46 To the best of our knowledge this is the first instance when it is observed that these perovskite NCs can serve as electron acceptors from the photoexcited QDs. Coupling of these high band-gap perovskites with low band-gap QDs not only improves the absorption characteristics of these complexes that helps the utilization of a larger portion of the solar radiation, but also facilitates the extraction of both hot and cold electrons efficiently from CdTe QDs.


Multiple exciton generation and dissociation dynamics. 
We further examined the potential of the perovskites in the extraction of the multiexcitons from the QDs. The multiexcitons can be generated in a QD by absorbing a high energy photon or simultaneous absorption of multiple lower energy photons.1,20 Though the multiphoton absorption by a single QD under solar radiation has negligible probability, the relaxation process and dynamics of the multiexcitons are the same regardless of the method of generation.1,20 In the present case, we generate the multiexcitons by varying the pump fluence (22–478 μJ cm−2) and maintaining the excitation wavelength as 520 nm to avoid direct photoexcitation of the perovskite NCs.

Fig. 4 depicts the TA spectra of the bare QDs at the highest pump fluence (478 μJ cm−2) at various delay times and the bleach recovery kinetics at various fluences. The TA spectra of the complexes for the intermediate and highest pump fluence (<N> is >1) are provided in the ESI (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†), but the bleach recovery kinetics is presented in Fig. 5. The TA spectra of the bare QDs at high fluence not only show a higher bleach amplitude, but also spectral broadening and a blue-shift of the peak position. These features indicate the formation of many excitons at higher energy states as well; an observation consistent with the literature.20,47 The results show 80% of exciton bleach recovery in 1.5 ns at the highest fluence, as compared to only 26% recovery at the lowest fluence (22 μJ cm−2). This acceleration of bleach recovery at a higher fluence (Inset of Fig. 4B) is a typical signature of the Auger assisted multiexciton recombination process.2,9

The time scales for the Auger recombination processes, which occur only at higher pump fluences,2,10 are estimated by normalizing the bleach signals for different pump fluences at longer time scales (single-exciton dynamics). In the present case, normalization of the bleach signals (at 1 ns) for various pump fluences reveals an ∼8 ps time-component whose amplitude progressively increases (from 0.10 to 0.34) with the increase in the pump fluence. A corresponding decrease of the amplitude of the single-exciton recombination time component (from 0.55 to 0.40) is also observed (Table S1, ESI†). The 8 ps component is assigned to the biexcitonic Auger recombination process. The time constant for the process is consistent with an earlier report on CdTe QDs.43 As the biexciton lifetime is dependent on the size and surface properties of QDs, some variation in timescales can also be found in the literature.43,48
The bleach recovery dynamics of CdTe-CsPbBr3 and CdTe-CsPbCl3 at different pump fluences are presented in panels (A) and (B) of Fig. 5. Though the same number of excitons are produced for the complexes and the bare QDs (as 520 nm solely excites the QDs), the bleach recovery for both CdTe-CsPbBr3 and CdTe-CsPbCl3 is faster than that of the bare QDs at higher pump fluence indicating the dissociation of these biexcitons prior to Auger recombination.
For the QD–perovskite complexes, the bleach recovery becomes faster with the increase in the pump fluence suggesting the perovskite-induced dissociation of most of the biexcitons. This faster recovery dynamics is mainly due to the increase in the amplitude of the short time-component (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†) which is associated with the ET process and also it is shorter than the biexciton lifetime. In this context, previously reported CdSe-MB+ and CdSe-ZnO composites20,49 also show dissociation of the biexcitons of CdSe QDs by ET. The efficiency of the first electron injection rate for our two complexes, estimated by comparing the rate of electron injection and all other non-radiative (trapping, Auger recombination) and radiative processes, is found to be ∼80% and 60% for QD-CsPbBr3 and QD-CsPbCl3, respectively.49
It is expected that after the first electron injection into the perovskite, the CB properties of the perovskites will be affected due to state filling and also CdTe will be converted into charged QDs (i.e. a positive trion consisting of one electron and two holes). These effects can slow down the second electron injection process, but the process would continue as the trion recombination process is much slower than the biexciton lifetime.49,50 In our case, as the fast bleach recovery component, which is indicative of the ET process, does not depend on the pump fluence, it is evident that the rate of the second ET process remains the same. We note that in earlier studies of multiexciton dissociation dynamics on QD–molecular adsorbate complexes, it was found that the adsorbed species mainly participate in the one-electron reduction process.20,21 Considering the two-fold degeneracy of the band-edge state, one can expect the perovskites to serve as two-electron acceptors (unlike the other cases)51 with very similar electron injection rates for the two electrons. Our observation is indeed in agreement with this expectation. The overall picture that emerges from this study under both the single exciton and biexcitonic conditions is represented in Scheme 1.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we report for the first time that all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbX3) NCs can be used as electron harvesters from photoexcited CdTe QDs. We demonstrate efficient and rapid (in <100 fs) extraction of hot electrons from the QDs before their cooling process. CsPbX3 mediated dissociation of the biexcitons of CdTe QDs occurs by two electron transfer processes in the 2–4 ps timescale prior to their nonradiative Auger recombination (8 ps). Among CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3, the efficiency of the extraction of hot electrons (∼60%) of singly-excited QDs and the first thermalized electron (∼80%) of doubly-excited QDs is superior for CsPbBr3. This finding suggests that the efficiency of the CdTe QD-based solar cells can be improved significantly by harvesting the energy rich species employing the perovskite NCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Chemicals used
CdO (99.5%, trace metal), Te-powder (99.8%, trace metal), Cs2CO3 (99.995%, trace metal), PbCl2 (99.998%, trace metal), PbBr2 (>98%) and technical grade (90%) octadecene (ODE), trioctylphosphine (TOP), oleic acid (OA), and oleylamine (OLA) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. CHCl3 was purchased from Merck and dried before its use in spectroscopic measurements.
4.2. Syntheses of CdTe QDs
CdTe QDs were synthesized by following a reported procedure with slight modifications.36 Briefly, Te-precursor solution was prepared through the ultrasonication of a mixture of 0.0128 g of Te and 0.5 mL of TOP until a greenish yellow color was obtained. The Cd-precursor, a mixture of 0.026 g of CdO and 200 μL OA in 10 mL ODE, was dried for 30 min under vaccum at 100 °C. The Cd-precursor temperature was increased to 310 °C and heating at 310 °C was continued for 30–40 min until the appearance of grey color. Then the TOP-Te solution after dilution with 2 mL of ODE was quickly injected into the Cd-precursor solution at this temperature. The immediate change in the color of the solution to red indicates the formation of CdTe QDs and then the solution was cooled down. The synthesized CdTe QDs in ODE were purified by the addition of an ethanol–acetone mixture (1:3) and the process was repeated several times until the precipitation of QDs occurred. The precipitated QDs were dispersed in CHCl3 for all the spectroscopic measurements.
4.3. Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br) NCs
CsPbX3 NCs were synthesized following a hot-injection method reported by Protesescu et al.23 At first 0.133 g Cs2CO3 and 0.45 mL OA in 5 mL ODE were heated at 120 °C under vaccum for 30 min to produce Cs-oleate. Cs-oleate was heated at 100 °C just to avoid solidification.
Briefly, 0.045 g PbCl2 or 0.069 g PbBr2 was loaded into a double neck round bottom flask containing 5 mL of ODE and 0.55 mL each of OLA and OA and 1 mL TOP (only for CsPbCl3). The solution was kept under vaccum for 30 min at 120 °C until the lead salt fully dissolves. The temperature of the solution was increased to 185 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and 0.45 mL of pre-heated Cs-oleate was quickly injected. The solution was stirred for 1 min for CsPbCl3 followed by quenching in an ice-water bath, while for CsPbBr3 it was quenched immediately. The synthesized NCs were centrifuged to remove all the impurities and excess reagents and then the residue was dissolved in CHCl3 for all the spectroscopic investigations.

 	Fig. 1  HRTEM images of CdTe QDs (A), CsPbBr3 (B) and CsPbCl3 (C) NCs. Scale bar in (A) is 10 nm and in (B) and (C) 5 nm. (D) Normalized absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdTe QDs, and CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 NCs in CHCl3. (E) Change in the absorbance of CdTe QDs (0.13 μM) on the addition of a colloidal dispersion of CsPbBr3 NCs. (F) Change in the PL spectra of CdTe QDs in the presence of CsPbBr3 NCs under selective photoexcitation (λex = 530 nm) of CdTe QDs.	 

 	Fig. 2  Alignment of the VB and CB potentials of CdTe QDs, CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 NCs.	 

 	Fig. 3  TA spectra at the indicated delay times following 520 nm excitation of the bare CdTe QDs (A), CdTe-CsPbBr3 (B) and CdTe-CsPbCl3 (C) complexes. (D) Excitonic bleach formation dynamics (monitored at 655 nm) with and without CsPbBr3 NCs. The bleach recovery dynamics of CdTe QDs without and with CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 at a shorter time scale along with the absolute bleach amplitude (E) and at a longer delay time with the normalized bleach amplitude (F).	 


CdTe QDs	266 ± 20 (100%)	68.5 ± 6.6 (30%)	>1000 (70%)
CdTe-CsPbBr3	<100 (100%)	1.70 ± 0.3 (60%)	29.6 ± 4.5 (40%)
CdTe-CsPbCl3	145 ± 30 (100%)	4.60 ± 0.4 (58%)	95.0 ± 12 (42%)
