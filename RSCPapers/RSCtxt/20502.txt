The results indicate that the preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs with a texture degree f > 0.9 for anatase (004) can be assembled over a wide range of water content in the electrolyte from 1.5 to 6.0 vol%. When the water content is more than 8 vol%, the anatase TiO2 NTA further transforms to a polycrystal type. When compared to the characteristics of DSSCs based on the different oriented TiO2 NTAs, the (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs possesses the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) and electron transport rate owing to its excellent orientation.
1. Introduction
Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs), which can be fabricated by the anodization of a Ti foil, have been widely applied in many fields, including photocatalysis,1 solar energy conversion2–4 and biomedicine.5,6 TiO2 NTAs have uniform nanotubular structures perpendicular to the matrix. In order to optimize the function of TiO2 NTAs in various applications, control over the morphology of the TiO2 NTAs is regarded as one of the most important factors. Many novel TiO2 nanotube structures, such as bamboo-type TiO2 NTAs,7,8 double-wall TiO2 NTAs9,10 and hierarchically branched TiO2 NTAs,11,12 have brought great interest to researchers. Bamboo-type TiO2 NTAs used as a photoanode can substantially increase the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of NT-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).7 These types of TiO2 NTAs grew perpendicularly to the opaque Ti metal substrate. When the TiO2 NTA on opaque Ti foil was directly used as a DSSC, the incidental light must pass through the counter-electrode and light-absorbing electrolyte.13 It was found that back-side illumination caused considerable light loss and was not suitable for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). To overcome this drawback,14,15 TiO2 NTA film prepared on Ti metal can be transferred to a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate16,17 or the TiO2 NTA prepared via the anodization of Ti film sputtered on a TCO substrate.18,19 It can be no the TiO2 NTAs prepared by anodizing from Ti foil or Ti film were amorphous and can be transformed into a polycrystal but not crystallographically oriented phase after an annealing process.3,4,8,19 Despite numerous studies on the amorphous-to-crystalline transformation of TiO2 nanotubes, the mechanism of the phase transformation is not well understood to date20 and there is still little recognization for the formation of oriented TiO2 NTAs and their application in DSSCs.
In the present study, the anatase (004) preferred oriented TiO2 NTAs were fabricated by the anodization of Ti film (with (002) orientation) sputtered on ITO glass. The crystallographical orientation of the TiO2 NTA could be transformed controllably via adjusting the water content in the electrolyte under the same annealing conditions. In addition, the texture degree f of the (004) orientation was introduced to quantitatively estimate the crystal orientation of the TiO2 NTAs. The different oriented TiO2 NTAs with the same thickness were assembled into DSSCs, which showed different PCE values.
2. Experimental section
Ti films were deposited on a commercial ITO glass substrate (10 Ω square−1, Zh-Kv Co., Ltd.) using a radio frequency (RF) sputtering system fitted with a Ti target of 99.99% purity. The sputtering chamber was pumped down to a pressure of 10−3 mTorr before argon gas was introduced. Sputtering was conducted in an argon atmosphere at 10 mTorr with an applied RF power of 150 W and substrate temperature of 400 °C. During the deposition process, the target-substrate distance was kept at 50 mm and the negative dc self-bias voltage was 10 V.
In a two-electrode cell, the TiO2 NTAs were fabricated by anodizing Ti film in an ethylene glycol electrolyte21 containing 0.75 wt% NH4F and 1.5–12 vol% H2O at room temperature. The Ti film deposited on the ITO glass was used as the anode and Pt foil (4 cm × 5 cm) was used as the counter electrode (cathode). In a 500 mL PTFE beaker, the anode and cathode were kept at a distance of 4 cm. The exposed surface area of the anode and cathode to the electrolyte was 2 cm2 and 8 cm2, respectively. Anodized voltages in the range of 40–60 V were employed in the process and the initial current was 0.1 A. After being anodized, the as-prepared samples were rinsed with water and dried under an air atmosphere. Anatase phase TiO2 NTAs were obtained by annealing the anodized samples in a tube furnace with ambient air, which was heated at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 450 °C, maintained at this temperature for 3 h and then cooled down to room temperature. These annealed TiO2 NTAs firstly were soaked in a 0.5 × 10−3 mol L−1 N719 dye solution in ethanol for 24 h and ethanol was used to rinse the unabsorbed dye. The electrolyte and Pt electrode used for the DSSC were purchased from Dalian Heptachroma Solar Tech Co., Ltd., China. The DSSCs were assembled with the dye-sensitized TiO2 NTAs and Pt electrode using a hot-melt film.
The surface morphology and crystalline phase of the TiO2 NTAs were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Quanta 400F), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (Bruker D2) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2010). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Bruker D2 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 30 kV, 10 mA) in the scan range from 10° to 90° with a step size of 0.02° and residence time of 0.5 s. Current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured under one sun condition using a solar light simulator (Newport 91160) operating at AM 1.5. Intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab, PGSTAT302N) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated red light emitting diode (625 nm) driven by a source supply (Autolab dynamic load interface, DYN 7412), which could provide both the dc and ac components of the illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1 kHz to 0.01 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of ITO glass, sputtered Ti film, non-annealed and annealed TiO2 NTAs. The XRD pattern of Ti film sputtered on an ITO glass substrate indicates a (002) preferred orientation and the peak of the Ti film could be indexed to hexagonal titanium (JCPDS no. 44-1294). The non-annealed TiO2 NTA does not have diffraction peaks showing an amorphous characteristic and was prepared in an electrolyte containing 2 vol% H2O. After TiO2 NTA was annealed under ambient air at 450 °C for 3 h, it was converted into its crystalline form. The (101) and (004) peaks of the annealed TiO2 NTAs could be indexed to the TiO2 anatase phase (JCPDS no. 21-1272). In addition, it is important to note that the anatase TiO2 NTA (see Fig. 1) was in the (004) preferred orientation. Fig. 1b shows a schematic of the electrochemical cell used in the anodization of the Ti film.

To review other studies on synthesizing TiO2 NTAs, amorphous TiO2 NTAs have been reported to be transformed into a polycrystal form via a post-annealing process.4,8,19 Hong22 and Lee23 fabricated the anatase (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs by the anodization of opaque Ti foil and the as-prepared TiO2 NTAs were not suitable for achieving high-efficiency DSSCs.13 Herein, we have successfully synthesized the transparent (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs via anodizing a (002) oriented Ti film.
Fig. 2a displays the top-view of the TiO2 NTAs obtained on ITO glass, which are prepared in an ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0.75 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% H2O. The top morphology of the TiO2 NTA is presented in Fig.2a and the average nanotube pore diameters and wall thicknesses are roughly ∼70 nm and ∼10 nm, respectively. From the cross-sectional view of the TiO2 TNAs shown in Fig. 2b and c, we can see that the TiO2 NTAs are perpendicular to the ITO glass with smooth walls. Fig. 2d and e present a cross-sectional TEM image and corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the TiO2 NTA and a HR-TEM image of the TiO2 nanotube wall. In Fig. 2d, the TiO2 NTAs show characteristic tubular structures with uniform diameter. The HR-TEM image of the nanotube wall displayed in Fig. 2e indicates that its lattice fringe was parallel to the mouth of the tube with an interplanar spacing of 0.467 nm referring to the (002) plane of the anatase phase.24 In Fig. 2d, the SAED pattern from the cross-section of the TiO2 NTAs indicates that the [001] orientation was parallel to the longitudinal direction of the tubes. The diffraction pattern with bright intense spots illustrates that the TiO2 nanotube wall possessed an excellent preferred orientation, which is in good agreement with the aforementioned XRD results.

Fig. 3a shows that the XRD patterns of the TiO2 NTAs prepared from a Ti film with (002) preferred orientation via anodizing in an electrolyte with a water content from 1.5 vol% to 12.0 vol%. When water content ranges from 1.5 vol% to 7.0 vol%, anatase TiO2 NTAs with a (004) preferred orientation are formed. When the water content is ∼8 vol%, anatase TiO2 NTAs with both a (101) and (004) texture orientation can be obtained. After 9.0 vol%, the anatase TiO2 NTAs exhibits a polycrystal type. In the abovementioned experiments, the anodized voltage was adjusted from 40 V to 60 V when the water content exceeded 5.0 vol%, which was carried out in order to obtain transparent TiO2 NTAs. This was different to the study by Hong22 who reported that the anatase (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs could only be produced within a limited range of water content of around 2 wt% in the electrolyte. Our experimental results shows that the anatase (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs can be facilely prepared in an electrolyte containing a wider range of water content (approximately 1.5–7.0 vol%). We propose that the precursor used to prepare the TiO2 NTAs caused this difference.

To date, the mechanism of the generation of different orientations found with differing the water content in the electrolyte is not fully understood. However, in previous studies25–28 on anodization, it is accepted that water is usually a source of oxygen in the anodizing solutions. While the exact mechanism by which water contributes oxygen to an anodic oxide film is not well-understood, strong evidence has been found for hydroxyl ion injection from the electrolyte into the anodic oxide film during anodization. When more water is present, hydroxyl ions are injected into the body of the oxide layer. So along with water content increasing in the electrolyte, more hydroxyl ions are injected into the body of the oxide. Therefore, during an annealing process, the increased number of incorporated hydroxyl ions may hinder the direction of the crystallization process into well-oriented nanograins. Further study on the role of hydroxyl groups on the crystallization behavior is on going in our research group.
In previous studies,22,23 the quantitative evaluation of the texture degree for the (004) orientation was not considered. According to our experiments in this study, the texture degree f of the (004) orientation was defined to further evaluate the anatase phase TiO2 NTAs with different preferred orientations found with differing the water content in the electrolyte. The texture degree f was estimated using the Lotgering method:29f = (P(001) − P0)/(1 − P0),where P(001) = ∑I(001)/∑I(hkl) and P0 = ∑I0(001)/∑I0(hkl). ∑I(001) is the summation of the XRD peak intensities of all the (001) peaks (i.e., 001, 002…) in the textured sample pattern. ∑I(hkl) is the summation of the peak intensities of all (hkl) peaks, which appears in the XRD pattern. ∑I0(001) and ∑I0(hkl) are the standard random powder using the published diffraction file JCPDS no. 21-1272. Diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of 10°–90° are considered in the calculation.
f = 0 and f = 1 correspond to the typical polycrystal and complete (001) texture cases, respectively, and 0 < f < 1 for partial texture. Fig. 3b shows the evolution of f versus water content. When the water content ranges from 1.5 vol% to 6.0 vol%, all values of f are greater than 0.9. This illustrates that the anatase TiO2 NTAs possess an excellent (004) preferred orientation. The value of f drops to 0.79 when the water content increases to 7.0 vol%. When the water content increases to 9.0 vol%, the value of f sharply decreases to 0.2, indicating that the anatase (004) preferred orientation of the TiO2 NTAs transformed to a polycrystal type.
The three different orientations of the TiO2 NTAs (lengths up to 5 μm) are assembled into solar cells as described in the Experimental section. Fig. 4a presents the current–voltage curves for the DSSCs based on the three photoanodes. The DSSC based on the (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs shows an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.59 mA cm−2 and a PCE (η) of 2.69%. In contrast, the Voc, Jsc and η of DSSC based on double-texture TiO2 NTA is 0.765 V, 4.89 mA cm−2 and 2.32%, respectively. The Voc, Jsc and η of the DSSC based on polycrystalline TiO2 NTA were 0.72 V, 3.60 mA cm−2 and 1.43%, respectively. It can be noted that the (004) preferred orientation of the TiO2 NTAs yields the highest conversion efficiency and highest Jsc than the other orientations of the TiO2 NTAs studied. In order to evaluate the main factors for the different performance of the different orientations of the TiO2 NTAs, the electron transport characteristics were measured and compared. Fig. 4b shows the IMPS and IMVS results for the three structures. There are a very interesting finding from the IMPS measurements shown in Fig. 4b in which the electron transport time in the (004) preferred orientation of the TiO2 NTAs was shorter (≈3 times) than in the other orientations of the TiO2 NTAs studied. This result may be ascribed to the regular arrangement of the grains along the [001] orientation in the nanotube wall, which was the main reason to remarkably decrease the defect component of the tube wall.30 Due to the highest electron transport rate for the (004) preferred orientation of the TiO2 NTAs, the Jsc of the (004) orientated TiO2 NTAs was the highest of the three different orientations of the TiO2 NTAs studied. A similar lifetime was observed for three different orientations of the TiO2 NTAs, as shown in Fig. 4b and the results indicate that the same potential surface recombination sites exist in the three different samples. Therefore, the DSSCs based on the (004) orientated TiO2 NTAs possesses the highest PCE value.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the anatase (004) preferred orientation of TiO2 NTAs can be fabricated in a controlled manner from a (002) preferred orientated Ti film via anodization over a wide range of water content in the electrolyte of 1.5–7.0 vol%. The HR-TEM and SAED patterns of the TiO2 NTAs indicate that the [001] orientation was parallel to the longitudinal direction of the tubes with their preferred orientation. When the water content was ∼8 vol%, anatase TiO2 NTAs with both (101) and (004) texture orientations can be obtained. After 9.0 vol%, the anatase TiO2 NTAs exhibit a polycrystal type. The three different oriented TiO2 NTAs were assembled to DSSCs and used as photoanodes, in which the (004) preferred orientation of the TiO2 NTAs exhibited the highest PCE, which was attributed to its highest electron transport rate resulting from the regular arrangement of grains along the [001] orientation in the nanotube walls. It is expected that this strategy used for the fabrication of preferred orientations of TiO2 NTAs has great potential for application in highly efficient DSSCs through further interface modification engineering.
