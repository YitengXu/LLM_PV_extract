    , Accepted 1st April 2021First published on 5th April 2021AbstractHerein, we describe the nonlinear processes for the formation of thin films of the PbS–CdS system using chemical bath deposition with a gradual change in the cadmium nitrate content in the reaction mixture. The morphology of films was studied via scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The mechanism for the formation of thin-film compounds can be considered as cluster-particle aggregation (diffusion-limited aggregation). X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of single-phase layers of substitutional B1-type CdxPb1−xS solid solutions (space group Fmm) when the concentration of cadmium nitrate in the reaction bath increased up to [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.08 M. The maximum cadmium content in CdxPb1−xS solid solutions was determined to be x = 0.094. At the concentration of [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.10 M, a two-phase film was formed, where the film consisted of crystallites of cubic CdxPb1−xS with x = 0.071 (lower compared to the film obtained at [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.08 M) and fine-crystalline hexagonal B4-type Cd1−δS (space group P63mc). The texture of grains forming films was observed; where a predominant orientation with the (111) plane along substrate in PbS changed to the (200) plane in CdxPb1−xS films, the portion of (200) oriented grains increased with an increase in cadmium nitrate content up to [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.08 M, and at 0.10 M of cadmium nitrate, a radical change in the type of texture to the (111) type occurred. The concentration [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.10 M is called the critical concentration, where under this condition, the deposition process occurs due to the excess Gibbs energy. The higher cadmium content x in films determined by the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and Auger spectroscopy compared with that estimated from the crystal lattice parameter is associated with the presence of an additional amorphous CdS phase formed as a sublayer distributed in intercrystalline spaces and island formations. Optical studies showed a nonlinear change in the band gap (Eg) of obtained films from 0.53 to 0.76 eV, whereas at the critical cadmium salt concentration (0.10 M), two crystalline phases with Eg equal to 0.73 and 2.47 eV were observed.
1. Introduction
The current state of rapidly developing optoelectronics and nanoelectronics, sensorics, and solar power engineering has aroused great interest in sulfide solid solutions, which have the possibility of modifying their applied properties. Among them, cadmium and lead sulfides are some of the most attractive semiconductors with unique optical characteristics, which allow effective use of the visible (500–700 nm) and near infrared (IR) (up to 3100 nm) spectral region due to the wide variation in their band gaps (Eg = 2.42 eV in CdS1 and 0.41 eV in PbS2). According to the literature data, the unique combination of electrophysical and photoelectric characteristics and the possibility of their variation have caused CdxPb1−xS solid solutions to be considered as materials with great potential for creating IR detectors,3,4 environmental control devices,5,6 heterostructures with emissions in the IR and visible spectral ranges,7–9 and solar cells with an energy conversion efficiency greater than 40%.10
The prospective use of thin-film CdxPb1−xS solid solutions is not only due to their unique functional physical and chemical properties (semiconductor or ionic conductivity, mechanical, thermal, and radiation resistance), which can be controlled by changing the cadmium content or particle size, but also by the relative ease of their synthesis. Chemical bath deposition (CBD) from aqueous solutions is the most efficient method to obtain CdxPb1−xS solid solutions both in the powder and thin-film states on substrates of any nature and configuration, which does not require the use of complex technological equipment.11,12 The authors of previous publications13–16 showed that varying the content of metal salts, complexing agents, sulfidizers, pH of the medium, temperature and duration of chemical deposition, and the use of various substrates17 make it possible to successfully control the morphology, composition, crystal structure, and semiconducting properties of CdxPb1−xS films. Traditionally, the reaction mixture for the CBD of CdxPb1−xS films includes a lead salt (Pb(CH3COO)2 or Pb(NO3)2), a chalcogenizer (usually thiourea), complexing agents (triethanolamine C6H15NO3, ethylenediamine C2H8N2, disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid C10H14N2Na2O8, sodium citrate Na3C6H5O7, and aqueous ammonia solution NH4OH) and an alkaline agent (NaOH, NH4OH, or C2H8N2) to achieve the required pH of the reaction mixture. In the case of the cadmium salt, the most popular salt is acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2),15,16 chloride (CdCl2),3,5,6,18,19 and sulfate (CdSO4).14,20 Previously, the effect of the anionic component of the cadmium salt on the composition and properties of CdxPb1−xS solid solutions obtained by CBD was insufficiently studied. This issue was considered by Maskaeva et al.,19 where, according to their results, it was concluded that the effect of different cadmium salts is associated with a change in the kinetics of the decomposition of thiourea ((NH2)2CS) due to different degrees of its activation. This phenomenon was explained considering the nucleophilic addition of anions to the thiocarbonyl carbon atom of the chalcogenizer, leading to the weakening of the CS bond depending on the degree of their nucleophilicity. To date, no comprehensive studies have been reported on the use of cadmium nitrate in the reaction mixture and the effect of its concentration on the composition and structure of CdxPb1−xS solid solution films. Furthermore, the possibility of the formation of other solid phases in addition to CdxPb1−xS solid solutions has not been considered. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to establish the change in the phase composition, morphology, structural features, and optical properties of films of ternary CdPbS compounds with a variation in the content of cadmium nitrate in the reaction bath upon chemical deposition on quartz substrates.
2. Experiment
Thin-film layers based on lead and cadmium sulfides were synthesized via chemical bath deposition from aqueous solutions containing 0.04 M of lead acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2), 0.3 M of sodium citrate Na3C6H5O7, 4.5 M of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), and 0.58 M of thiourea ((NH2)2CS). The concentration of cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2) was varied in the range of 0.01 to 0.10 M. The main complexing agents controlling the rate of the precipitation of metals were citrate ions for lead and ammonia for cadmium. The film of the binary sulfide (PbS) was obtained by excluding the cadmium salt from the reaction bath.
The deposition of the films was carried out at 353 K for 120 min in sealed reactors made of molybdenum glass, in which pre-degreased quartz glass substrates with the size of 24 × 24 mm were placed in a fluoroplastic holder. The reactors were placed in a TS-TB-10 thermostat, which maintained the reaction temperature with the accuracy of ±0.1°.
The thickness of the deposited films was determined using an MII-4M interference microscope (Linnik Microinterferometer) with a measurement error of 20%. The microstructure and elemental analysis of the three-component CdPbS films were studied using a MIRA 3 LMU scanning electron microscope (at an accelerating electron beam voltage of 10 kV) and JEOL JSM-5900 LV with an EDS Inca Energy 250 energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer. The topography of the surface of the films was studied by atomic force microscopy using an NteGRA Prima scanning probe microscope (NT-MDT). The survey was carried out in contact mode in air at room temperature using a CSG01-A cantilever with a rigidity of 0.003–0.13 N m−1 and the radius of the tip camber was less than 10 nm.
The X-ray study of the deposited films was carried out in the 2θ range of 20° to 100° with a step of 0.02° and a scanning time of 10 s using a PANalytical Empyrean Series 2 diffractometer with CuKα radiation in the geometry of a parallel beam with a PIXel3D position-sensitive detector, providing a resolution on the 2θ scale of not less than 0.0016°. The structural parameters of the CdxPb1−xS films were refined using full-profile Rietveld analysis21,22 and the Fullprof program.23 The conventional Williamson–Hall plot24 was used to separate the contributions of the grain size and deformations in the studied films to the width of the diffraction reflections as follows: β × cosΘ = 0.9λ/L + 4ε × sinΘ,(1)where L is the average size of the coherent scattering regions taken as the average particle size, β is the half-width of the reflection in radians, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation used, ε = Δd/d is the deformation, and d is the interplanar distance.
The Auger spectra of the studied films were obtained on a JEOL Jamp-9510F Auger electron spectrometer with a sample tilt angle relative to the electron beam of 30° at an accelerating voltage of 10 keV before and after ion etching. The diameter of the electron beam during profiling was about 100 μm. To obtain the depth distribution profile, an ion gun with an argon ion energy of 2000 eV was used. The etching rate of the samples under study was in the range of 3 to 12 nm min−1. The method error was ∼20%.
The diffuse reflectance study of the CdxPb1−xS films was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an ISR-3100 integration sphere. The spectra were recorded in the interval of 200–2600 nm (0.5–6.2 eV) with the step of 1 nm. Barium sulfate (99.8%) was used as a reference. Based on the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy data, the optical band gap for the studied films was calculated using the Kubelka–Munk function as follows:25 F(R∞) = (1 − R∞)2/(2R∞) = K/S(2)where R∞ is the diffuse reflection from an infinitely thin sample equal to Rsample/RBaSO4, K is the absorption coefficient of the sample, and S is the scattering coefficient of the sample.
3. Results and discussion
Light gray films of ternary CdPbS compounds with good adhesion to quartz glass were obtained via the combined chemical deposition of lead and cadmium sulfides from a citrate–ammonia reaction mixture with varying concentrations of Cd(NO3)2 salt in the range of 0.01 to 0.10 M. One of the important parameters characterizing the films is their thickness. The concentration dependence of the thickness of the obtained films is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that an increase in the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 in the reactor to 0.08 M led to a monotonic increase in the film thickness to ∼1200 nm. Subsequently, a sharp decrease in the layer thickness to ∼390 nm occurred when the content of the cadmium salt in the reactor was 0.10 M, which can be explained by the redistribution of the formed solid phase of CdPbS in the reactor volume and its rapid sedimentation due to the excess concentration of the (NH2)2CS chalcogenizer (0.58 M). This resulted in a decrease in the concentration of colloidal particles responsible for the film growth due to the adsorption interactions.

Morphology
One of the most important parameters of thin films is the state of their surface (morphology); therefore, we studied the morphology of the films via two methods: (i) a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and (ii) atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Scanning electron microscopy data. 
The evolution of the surface of the deposited CdPbS films with an increase in the cadmium salt content in the reactor is illustrated by the SEM images shown in Fig. 2. The images demonstrate a pronounced change of the microstructure of the CdPbS films with a change in the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 in the reaction mixture (content of the remaining components kept constant). For comparison, the images of the binary PbS and CdS films are also presented in Fig. 2. At [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.01 M, the microstructure of the CdPbS film resembles that of the polycrystalline PbS film with regular cut and tightly packed crystallites (Fig. 2a and c). The introduction of 0.02 M of cadmium salt led to a smoothing of the crystallite faces (Fig. 2d). An increase in the concentration of cadmium salt to 0.04 M radically changed the microstructure, where lamellar crystallites with jagged edges and a size of about 200–500 nm in the plane and thickness of 150–200 nm were seen (Fig. 2e). An increase in the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 in the reactor to 0.06 M resulted in crystallization processes (Fig. 2f), which at 0.08 M of Cd(NO3)2 again led to the formation of faceted crystallites with a size of 200–500 nm (Fig. 2g). It is worth noting that inclusions of another phase were seen on the surface of the crystallites forming the films (Fig. 2c–f). With an increase in the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 to 0.10 M, destruction of the relatively homogeneous polycrystalline structure of the layer was observed, where well-faceted individual pyramidal crystallites of various sizes are located on the fine-crystalline sublayer (Fig. 2h), which is similar to the surface of the CdS film (Fig. 2b).

Considering the rather close values of the solubility products of sulfides PbS (2.5 × 10−27) and CdS (7.9 × 10−27),26 analysis of the results allows us to conclude that the observed morphological features of the films were caused by the occurrence of competing reactions during their formation. Naturally, a change in the concentration of cadmium salt affects the kinetics of the deposition of both PbS and CdS, and therefore becomes apparent in the ratio of these sulfides in the solid phase.27 Moreover, Maskaeva et al.27 noted that the cadmium salt present in the reaction mixture has an inhibitory effect on the rate of PbS formation with simultaneous stimulation of the formation of CdS, which entails a change in the morphology of the films (see Fig. 2).


Atomic force microscopy data. 
To study the surface topography of the synthesized CdPbS films, quantitatively estimate their parameters, and establish their growth mechanism, we applied atomic force microscopy. Earlier studies28,29 showed that the characteristics of the surface of the samples determined by the AFM method have a scale hierarchy. This was evidenced by the three-dimensional topographic images of the films recorded from scanning areas with sizes of 50 × 50 and 5 × 5 μm (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Surface topographic AFM images recorded on areas of 50 × 50 μm (left) and 5 × 5 μm (right) of CdPbS films deposited on quartz substrates from a reaction mixture containing cadmium nitrate with the concentration of 0.01 (a), 0.04 (b), 0.08 (c), and 0.10 M (d). 
The surface images of the films under discussion with a maximum scanning area of 50 × 50 μm differ significantly from the scans of 5 × 5 μm. The AFM images obtained from greater area (Fig. 3, left) show Koch curves in three-dimensional space, the frequency of which depends on the concentration of the cadmium nitrate salt in the reactor. Specifically, in the range 0.01–0.04 M of Cd(NO3)2 there is approximately the same number of curves of different heights, whereas when [Cd(NO3)2] = 0.06 M, the surface of the film is more homogeneous and there are single higher objects. At the maximum concentration of cadmium salt in the reactor, the film surface contains Koch curves with a high density in three-dimensional space. A completely different picture can be seen in the scanning area of 5 × 5 μm (Fig. 3, right). The AFM images of the CdPbS films deposited from the reaction bath with a concentration of 0.01–0.08 M of cadmium nitrate show tightly packed “petals” of different heights with sharp edges perpendicular to the substrate surface. At the maximum cadmium salt content in the bath (0.10 M), a fine-crystalline sublayer can be seen in the AFM image between the “petals”, which is consistent with the SEM image for this film (Fig. 2h).
The AFM images were processed using the Gwyddion 2.31 software package. The average Rt and maximum RZ heights of the surface profile, root-mean-square roughness, Rq, skewness, RSk, and fractal dimension, D, are shown in Fig. 4. The studied films are characterized by rather sharp drops in the relief heights, as evidenced by the significant difference between the maximum RZ and average Rt heights of the surface profile. The RZ/Rt ratio is higher for the scanning area of 50 × 50 μm in comparison with that from the scanning area of 5 × 5 μm, indicating that the large crystallites are single.
 Fig. 4  Dependence of average profile height, Rt, maximum profile height, RZ, root-mean-square roughness, Rq, skewness, RSk and fractal dimension according to the cubic counting method (Dc) or the triangulation method (Dt) on the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 in the reaction bath, calculated from the AFM scanning area of 50 × 50 μm (a) and 5 × 5 μm (b) for the CdPbS films. 
The skewness of the surface roughness, RSk, provides a relative comparison of the cut surface. If the peaks of the measured profile are higher than the depths of its valleys, then the surface has a positive skewness. However, if the valleys are deeper than the height of the peaks, then the skewness is negative. In our case, the RSk coefficients are positive for all the films under consideration, which means that the peaks are dominant on the surface of the films. For a large scanning area, an RSk value significantly higher than unity, which indicates the presence of large grains. This is consistent with SEM images (Fig. 2), showing large agglomerates. For the films deposited from the reaction baths with 0.08 and 0.10 M of cadmium nitrate, agglomerates are absent in the SEM images (Fig. 2g and h, respectively) and also absent according to the AFM data, although the scanning area (50 × 50 μm) is significantly higher than that in SEM.
One of the main features of the CBD process, which occurs under “soft” nonequilibrium conditions, is the acquisition by the system of a high excess Gibbs free energy. The dominant contribution to the excess Gibbs energy is made by the surface component, the growth of which is facilitated by the physicochemical nature of the sulfide phase with a high surface tension of about 0.5–3.0 J m−2.30 In this regard, the system tends to the formation of dissipative structures,31i.e., highly ordered self-organizing formations in systems far from equilibrium. One of the main features of dissipative structures is that an increase in nonequilibrium under certain conditions results in refining of the grains and the formation of a nanostructured material (see Fig. 2h and 3d). The most important characteristic of dissipative structures is the fractal dimension, D. Therefore, for a better understanding of the process of the formation of a compound with structural inhomogeneities, it is necessary to calculate the fractal dimension, which quantitatively estimates the structure of the film surface, the degree of filling the space with matter, the scale invariance and self-similarity of the shape, and is a measure of the randomness of the structure. In the present work, the morphological fractal dimension was determined by the method of counting cubes (Dc) and the method of triangulation (Dt) based on the description of the shape of a three-dimensional surface profile using geometric “constants”. The calculation of the value of Dc was carried out by dividing the surface profile into cubes of various sizes with side face a, and counting the number of cubes occupied by clusters. In the case of the triangulation method (calculation of Dt), a triangular prism was used as a “constant”. The evolution of the fractal dimensions of the CdPbS films with an increase in the concentration of cadmium salt in the reaction bath is presented in Fig. 4. The values of D vary near 2.5, which indicates the developed surface of the films. This is in agreement with the SEM and AFM images. It should be noted that Dc is higher than Dt in the 50 × 50 μm AFM scanning area and almost coincides with that in the 5 × 5 μm area. This can be explained by the fact that the observed Koch curves or “petals” in the AFM images of the CdPbS films resemble triangular prisms more than cubes. According to Smirnov,32 the D values as applied to the film formation mechanism are a result of the process proceeding according to the cluster-particle aggregation mechanism (diffusion-limited aggregation) during Brownian motion with a sticking probability close to 1.
Thus, considering the obtained results, the following mechanism of film formation during the chemical bath deposition of the three-component CdPbS layers can be proposed. The primary clusters formed in the volume of the reaction mixture are fixed on the inhomogeneous surface of the quartz glass substrate and gradually cover its entire surface. Then the process of their enlargement occurs due to the addition of new particles from the solution. When Brownian motion occurs in the reactor volume, the reaction particles contact each other with a certain probability (in this case, close to 1) and then aggregate as cluster formations on the substrate. The particles forming the film may not only be free ions of cadmium, lead, and sulfur, but also intermediate reaction complexes of these metals with thiourea. Consequently, the surface of the substrate is gradually covered with cluster formations with a hierarchy on a higher scale, in particular, in the form of Koch curves in three-dimensional space or “petals” (Fig. 3). Thus, a continuous layer is formed, on which the nucleation of new crystallites is possible due to the deposition (adsorption) of microparticles from the solution. Overall, this process has a pronounced self-organizing character.


EDX data. 
An important issue is the composition of the synthesized CdPbS films. Thus, to establish the elemental composition of the synthesized film samples, EDX microanalysis was carried out over the entire surface of the layers in at least 10 points. The average content of lead, cadmium and sulfur determined by elemental analysis is presented in Table 1, from which it can be concluded that the concentration of the cadmium salt in the reaction mixture is a decisive factor determining the composition of the films. According to the EDX data, in the cadmium salt concentration range of 0.01 to 0.04 M, there was an increase in the fraction of cadmium in the composition of CdPbS film. A further increase in the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 in the reactor to 0.06 and 0.08 M resulted in a decrease in the cadmium content to 7.49 and 4.06 at%, respectively. In the films deposited from the baths with [Cd(NO3)2] ≤ 0.06 M, the sum of metals (Cd + Pb) prevails over the chalcogen. For the film deposited in the presence of 0.08 M of cadmium nitrate, an excess of sulfur (50.75 at%) was found compared to the sum of metals (49.25 at%).

Notably, the CdPbS film deposited from the reaction mixture with 0.10 M of cadmium salt is of particular interest. This film is characterized by the coexistence of particles with very different elemental compositions, and the average content of cadmium, lead, and sulfur was determined to be 16.9, 38.78, and 50.32 at% (Table 1). Together with the three-component crystallites, the film contained a fine-crystalline sublayer consisting exclusively of cadmium (47.82 at%) and sulfur (51.38 at%), and lead ions were not found. Consequently, the cadmium content in this film was higher than that in the other films synthesized in the present work, which reached 16.90 at%. According to the EDX analysis data, the formula composition of the layers synthesized in this work depending on the Cd(NO3)2 content in the reaction bath can be written as follows: Cd0.182Pb0.821S0.997 (0.01 M of Cd(NO3)2), Cd0.261Pb0.741S0.998 (0.02 M), Cd0.297Pb0.713S0.99 (0.04 M), Cd0.15Pb0.856S0.994 (0.06 M), Cd0.092Pb0.893S1.015 (0.8 M), and Cd0.338Pb0.776S1.006 + CdS (0.10 M).


Structural data. 

Fig. 5 shows the experimental and calculated X-ray diffraction patterns of the PbS and CdPbS films synthesized at various concentrations of Cd(NO3)2 in the reactor. The set of peaks in the XRD patterns is typical for a cubic face-centered crystal structure of an NaCl type (B1, Fmm sp.gr.), which is similar to that of individual lead sulfide. The formation of solid solutions is evidenced by the gradual shift in all the diffraction reflections to a region of larger 2θ angles with an increase in the cadmium salt content in the reaction bath (Fig. 5h). The profiles of the XRD patterns were simulated using the Pearson-7 function,23 but a different model was used to describe the profiles of each pattern. The XRD patterns of the CdxPb1−xS solid solution films obtained from the reaction baths with a cadmium salt content ranging from 0.01 to 0.08 M (Fig. 5b–f) were described by comparison with a thin-film PbS layer with a cubic B1 structure33 in a single-phase model. For the film obtained from the reactor containing 0.10 M of cadmium nitrate, the background in the form of diffuse scattering from the amorphous layer and crystallite was considered, i.e., the presence of two phases was modeled. One of the phases was the CdxPb1−xS solid solution with a B1 structure and the other phase was CdS with a hexagonal B4 structure (sp. gr. P63mc). The use of this model increased the accuracy in describing the profiles of the experimental XRD patterns, and consequently the accuracy of the structural parameters of the solid solution films. The refined parameters of the crystal lattice of the films of the CdxPb1−xS solid solutions are given in Table 2. A decrease in the lattice parameters of the films can be seen in comparison with PbS, the unit cell period of which is 0.5934(3) nm,33,34 which is associated with the substitution of Pb2+ ions with a size of 0.119 nm35 by the smaller Cd2+ ions (0.097 nm) and indicates the formation of CdxPb1−xS solid solutions.

To determine chemical composition of the solid solutions in the deposited films, Vegard's rule36 was used, according to which the molar fraction of cadmium was determined as follows: x = (aPbS − aSS)/(aPbS − aCdS),(3)where aPbS, aCdS, and aSS are the lattice parameters for lead sulfide, cadmium sulfide, and substitutional CdxPb1−xS solid solutions, respectively. As is known, Vegard's rule can be applied to calculate the concentrations of substitutional elements in solid solutions only if the lattice type of the individual PbS and CdS phases is the same.34 Therefore, the value of lattice parameter of CdS with cubic B1 structure aCdS = 0.546 nm from ref. 37–40 was used. The content of cadmium in the solid solution of studied films is shown in Table 2, and the formula compositions of the synthesized films depending on the content of Cd(NO3)2 in the reaction bath can be written as Cd0.035Pb0.965S, Cd0.061Pb0.939S, Cd0.079Pb0.921S, Cd0.094Pb0.906S, and Cd0.092Pb0.908S for [Cd(NO)2] = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 M, respectively. For the film deposited from the reactor with 0.10 M of cadmium nitrate, the Cd0.071Pb0.929S solid solution coexists with hexagonal Cd1−δS with the determined lattice parameters of a = 0.4048 nm and c = 0.6658 nm. The smaller values of the lattice parameters of the Cd1−δS phase in comparison with a = 0.4094 nm and c = 0.6709 nm reported by Cruceanu et al.41 can be explained by the mismatch between the crystal lattice parameters of the quartz substrate and the synthesized film, which leads to the compression of the thin-film layer. A similar effect of a decrease in the parameters and volume of the unit cell was found for a single crystal of hexagonal CdS.42 According with the equilibrium phase diagram of the PbS–CdS system,43 the CdS content in galena crystals does not exceed 0.009 mol%, which indicates the significant supersaturation of the lead sulfide lattice with cadmium in our films.
The different ratios of the intensities of the diffraction reflections in the XRD patterns observed in the studied films, which were more pronounced for the (111) and (200) reflections (Fig. 5), were caused by the different predominant crystallographic orientations of the grains. For PbS powder, the intensities of the (111) and (200) reflections are similar. In the PbS film considered in the present work, the intensity of the (111) reflection is almost twice that of the (200) reflection (Fig. 5a). This ratio of reflections of thin-film lead sulfide is possible only in the case of a preferential orientation of grains by the (111) plane with respect to the substrate, where the T111 texture of the individual PbS film is 36.2%. This situation changed when Cd(NO3)2 was added to the reaction solution, where the intensity of the (200) reflection of the film became much higher than that of the (111) reflection, indicating that the type of preferred orientation of the grains changed from (111) to (200). The evolution of the (111) and (200) reflections with the concentration of cadmium nitrate in the bath (Fig. 5b–f) indicates that the rate of grains with the (200) orientation significantly increased. The maximal texture T200 with the rate of 58.4% corresponds to the film deposited in the presence of 0.08 M of cadmium salt (Fig. 5f). At the maximum content of cadmium nitrate in the reactor (0.10 M), the situation changed again (Fig. 5g), where the (111) reflection is higher than the (200) reflection. Besides, a strong diffuse halo was observed from the amorphous material instead of an isotropic background, and additional peaks from hexagonal Cd1−δS were observed near the (111) reflection. The portions of the grains with the predominant (200) orientation along the substrate plane (T200) determined from the comparison of the intensities of the XRD peaks are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the dependence of the value of T200 on the concentration of cadmium nitrate in the reactor is nonlinear.
Therefore, based on the comparison with the data presented in ref. 13, the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 of 0.10 M should be considered the critical concentration, given that in this case, in addition to a change in the intensity of the reflections, a two-phase film is formed due to the precipitation of a fine-crystalline phase of cadmium sulfide. These changes are possible under highly nonequilibrium conditions due to excess surface energy, which acts as an independent thermodynamic potential, making it possible to explain the change in the phase composition of a substance by increasing its dispersion.44 Notably, according to ref. 45, one of the characteristic effects of an increase in the contribution of the surface component to the free energy of the system can be the appearance and stabilization of metastable phases that are not characteristic of a given substance under equilibrium conditions. This can be directly related to the formation of supersaturated substitutional CdxPb1−xS solid solutions in the present work because of the anomalous composition of these solutions compared with the equilibrium phase diagram of the CdS–PbS system.43
It should be noted that the diffraction reflections in the XRD patterns of the synthesized films are broadened in comparison with the instrument reference resolution, and the broadening of the reflections is anisotropic. According to the experimental dependence β(2Θ) × cosΘ = f(sinΘ) (Fig. 6), it can be concluded that the broadening of the reflections is associated with (i) the small size of the coherent scattering regions (CSR), which is determined from the cutoff value on the ordinate at sinΘ = 0 and (ii) the internal microstrains in the grains, the level of which can be estimated from the slope in the obtained dependences. The irregularity in the arrangement of the points on this dependence and their deviation from the mean straight line are associated with the anisotropy of the microstrains, while approximately the same segments cut off on the ordinate by lines drawn through the points corresponding to the (111), (222) and (200), (400) equivalent planes indicate the isotropic shape of the CSR. The size L of the CSR (the average grain size) the in CdxPb1−xS films was estimated from the broadening of the diffraction reflections to be 425–442 nm for x = 0.035–0.079. At the maximum value of x = 0.094, the grain size decreases by about 1.8 times (L = 244 nm), and then further increased to 351 nm (for x = 0.092). The two-phase film contains crystallites of Cd0.071Pb0.929S (B1) with a size of 330 nm, and Cd1−δS (B4), which is formed from nanoparticles with a size of 17 nm.
 Fig. 6  Experimental dependence β (2Θ) × cosΘ versus sinΘ plotted from the XRD patterns of the CdPbS films deposited from the reaction bath containing Cd(NO3)2 with concentrations of 0.01 M (a), 0.02 M (b), 0.04 M (c), 0.06 (d), 0.08 M (e), and 0.10 M (f). 
The effect of a change in the anisotropy of the microstrains can be caused by the dislocation structure, which is realized under nonequilibrium conditions during the chemical deposition of the studied films. Thus, to confirm this assumption, we rearranged the dependence β (2Θ) × cosΘ = f(sinΘ) in the coordinates of wave vector K. Fig. 7a shows, as an example, the dependence of the half-width of the reflections ΔK = 2cosΘ·ΔΘ/λ on the wave vector K = 2sinΘ/λ for the film of the Cd0.079Pb0.921S solid solution deposited from the reaction bath containing 0.04 M of Cd(NO3)2. The slope of the fitting line also indicates the presence of deformations in the particles, and the cutoff on the ordinate axis (ΔK = 0) gives the size of the CSR. Further, we replaced this conventional plot with a modified one using the contrast ratios of dislocations because in ref. 46–48 it was shown that the anisotropy of deformation is precisely associated with the difference in the contrast factors of dislocation. It can be seen in Fig. 7b that after this correction, all the data fell on a straight line, confirming the correctness of the assumption about the presence of dislocations in the film. For all the other films, similar dependences were obtained, which provided additional confidence in the assumption that the broadening is associated with an increase in the dislocation density, the values of which are presented in Table 2.

The study of the CdxPb1−xS solid solution films showed that the cadmium content obtained from the X-ray diffraction data is lower than that established by EDX analysis. The cadmium content in the films synthesized in this work determined by EDX analysis and from the crystal lattice parameters (Tables 1 and 2) differs within a fairly wide range from 0 to ∼0.22. This is because EDX analysis provides information on the total cadmium content in the studied films including crystalline and amorphous phases compared to X-ray diffraction, which provides data only on the crystalline phase. Therefore, it can be assumed that an independent amorphous phase of cadmium sulfide is formed in the system. This was confirmed by visual observation of the deposition process, where only after 10–15 min after the beginning of deposition, when more favorable conditions for the formation of a substitutional solid solution are created, the previously formed yellow nucleus layer of CdS turned the typical gray color of CdxPb1−xS. In addition to the inclusion of cadmium in the composition of the solid solution, it is located in the intercrystalline spaces and in the form of island formations on the CdxPb1−xS crystallite surface,49 forming inclusions (see Fig. 2c–f and h). When 0.08 M of Cd(NO3)2 was introduced in the reaction mixture, the composition of the film determined by EDX analysis and X-ray diffraction was practically the same (Cd0.092Pb0.908S), where the film did not contain an individual cadmium sulfide phase.
It was important to determine the reasons for the excess cadmium in the films, which can be associated with the formation of only an amorphous CdS phase in the initial stage of CBD or with the inclusion of cadmium sulfide in the synthesized films during the entire synthetic process. Auger spectroscopy can answer this question because this method makes it possible to determine the elemental composition of the film both in the near-surface layer and in the bulk at a certain distance from the surface.


Auger spectroscopy. 
The survey Auger spectra recorded from the surface of the studied films showed that only cadmium, sulfur atoms and oxygen and carbon impurities were found in the analysis zone, while lead atoms were not found. The presence of oxygen is associated with its adsorption upon the contact of the freshly deposited film with air and its oxidation, and carbon atoms are caused by natural surface contamination. As an example, Fig. 8a and b show the differentiated Auger spectra of the surface of the Cd0.036Pb0.964S and Cd0.079Pb0.921S solid solution films. To remove the layers containing oxygen and carbon contamination and to study the chemical composition over the thickness of the discussed films, ionic layer-by-layer etching of the surface of the films was carried out, which made it possible to obtain the concentration profiles of the distribution of the main elements (Cd, Pb, and S) (Fig. 8e and f). After 1–1.5 min of ion etching (at a depth of ∼6–8 nm), the peaks associated with carbon and oxygen atoms were absent in the spectra (within a measurement accuracy of about 1 at%) (Fig. 8c and d) and the peaks corresponding to the energy state of sulfur atoms (152 eV), cadmium (376 and 382 eV) and lead (94 and doublet 249 and 267 eV) were clearly observed, which are consistent with the literature.50 The content of Cd, Pb, and S atoms reached a “plateau” after about 4–5 minutes of etching (Fig. 8e and f), i.e., at a depth of 26–30 nm from the surface.
 Fig. 8  Differentiated survey Auger spectra recorded from the film surface before (a and b) and after ion etching (c and d) and profiles of atomic depth distribution (e and f) of the films of Cd0.036Pb0.954S (a, c, and e) and Cd0.079Pb0.921S (b, d, and f) solid solutions. 
The determination of the elemental composition of the synthesized films was carried out using the intensities of the Auger spectra of the binary CdS and PbS films with an identical matrix. This made it possible to determine quite accurately the compositions of the CdPbS films under study considering the possible analysis errors. The determined concentration of cadmium atoms at a depth of ∼30 nm in the Cd0.036Pb0.954S film is 4 at% and that in Cd0.079Pb0.921S is 8 at%; the lead content is 46 and 42 at%, respectively, and the number of sulfur atoms is about 50 at%. Thus, the formula composition of the films under study can be written as Cd0.08Pb0.92S and Cd0.16Pb0.84S. The higher relative content of the cadmium Auger spectroscopy results in comparison with the cadmium content determined from the structural data suggests that the cadmium sulfide phase exists on the surface of the crystallites in the form of inclusions, as observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2).
As shown above, the addition of 0.10 M of cadmium nitrate to the reactor led to the formation of a two-phase composition with a complex surface, i.e., Cd0.071Pb0.929S crystallites with a brighter contrast lying on a darker amorphous CdS layer (Fig. 2h). Therefore, both regions of the film were analyzed. Fig. 9a and b show the Auger spectra of the amorphous layer and crystallites after ion etching at a depth of 30 nm, respectively. To ensure precise recording of the spectra in both regions, the “Probe Tracking” function was used, which corrected the position of the analysis point and the shift from the point did not exceed 20 nm. Consequently, the displacement of the electron beam from the large crystallite to the amorphous layer and vice versa was excluded. It worth noting that there is an obvious difference in the intensities of the Auger signals of cadmium and lead in the large crystallites and the amorphous layer at a similar intensity of the Auger signal of sulfur.
 Fig. 9  Differentiated survey auger spectra recorded from the amorphous sublayer (a) and crystallites of solid state (b) of the two-phase film deposited from the reaction bath with 0.10 M of cadmium nitrate. 
The determination of the elemental composition of the two-phase compositions was carried out using the model of the homogeneous distribution of elements in the analyzed layer and the intensities of the Auger peaks of the CdS and PbS films. At a depth of ∼30 nm from the surface, a relatively large amount of cadmium (48 at%) was found in the amorphous sublayer and the lead content was about 4 at%. In large crystallites, another distribution of elements was observed, where lead ions prevail, and their concentration is about 35 at%, and the content of cadmium ions is about 14 at%. The sulfur content in the sublayer and crystallites is 48 and 51 at%, respectively. Therefore, the formula composition of thin-film compound can be written as Cd0.28Pb0.72S (crystallite) and Cd0.96Pb0.08S0.96 (amorphous sublayer). The SEM image of the two-phase film with selected mapping area and Auger-spectroscopy map of the predominant distribution of cadmium and lead ions are shown in Fig. 10. It can be concluded that the large crystallites with a brighter contrast in the SEM image consist of both lead sulfide and cadmium sulfide, but the content of lead sulfide prevails, and the fine-crystalline sublayer contains mainly cadmium sulfide.
 Fig. 10  SEM image with a selected mapping area (a) and AES map (b) of the distribution of cadmium (orange) and lead (brown) atoms for the two-phase film deposited from the reactor with 0.10 M of Cd(NO3)2. 
Thus, the total cadmium content in the film determined by Auger spectroscopy at a depth of 30 nm is higher than in the composition of the Cd0.071Pb0.921S solid solution estimated from the change in the lattice period. Accordingly, the differences in the compositions determined by Auger spectroscopy and EDX analysis could have been caused by the nonuniform distribution of atoms both over the surface and depth of the layer, which was confirmed by the Auger-spectroscopy map of the distribution of elements over the surface.


Optical properties. 
The diffuse reflectance spectra of the CdPbS films are shown in Fig. 11a. All the films begin to absorb radiation in the near infrared spectral range at λ ∼ 2400–1600 nm. An increase in the content of cadmium nitrate in the reactor resulted in a shift onset of the increase of the absorption towards lower wavelengths (higher energies). All the reflectance spectra contain prominent interference fringes, indicating that as a whole, the studied films have a rather smooth surface morphology, which is in agreement with the AFM data, showing only single large aggregates. In the visible spectral range, almost all the studied films demonstrate maximum absorption (R close to 0%). The exception is the two-phase film consisting of the CdxPb1−xS solid solution with a cubic structure and hexagonal Cd1−δS (the film deposited from the solution with 0.10 M of cadmium salt). An additional decrease in reflectance was detected for this film at 450–550 nm, which is caused by the presence of a wide band gap impurity and will be discussed below. It is also worth noting that R value for this film exceeds the values obtained for the other films in almost the entire spectral range considered. This is associated with the lower absorption of light radiation due to the lower thickness of the film (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 11  Diffuse reflectance spectra (a) and plots for the determination of the band gap energies (b and c) for the CdPbS films synthesized from solutions with 0.01 M (1), 0.02 M (2), 0.04 M (3), 0.06 M (4), 0.08 M (5), and 0.10 M (6) of Cd(NO3)2. 
The determination of the optical band gap energy (Eg) for the studied CdPbS films was carried out using the method proposed by Kubelka and Munk-Aussig25 according to formula (2). Assuming the direct allowed type of interband transitions, the function [F(R∞)hν]2 = f(hν) was plotted in Fig. 11b and c. The values of Eg were determined by fitting the straight regions and extrapolating the resulting lines to [F(R∞)hν]2 = 0. The estimated band gaps are 0.53, 0.60, 0.71, 0.76, 0.73 and 0.73 eV for the films deposited from the solutions with 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.10 M of Cd(NO3)2, respectively (Table 3). A similar procedure was also performed for the film deposited from the reactor with the maximal cadmium nitrate content (0.10 M) in the region of 450–550 nm (2.25–2.75 eV). The band gap calculated in this spectral range is equal to 2.47 eV, which is close to that reported previously for undoped CdS.51,52 As can be seen in Table 3, there is a saturation in the band gap value when the concentration of cadmium salt in the reaction bath reaches 0.06 M. A similar situation was observed in the CdxPb1−xS films deposited with the addition of cadmium acetate.34

Using the results of the optical studies and the band gap values for the individual CdS and PbS compounds, the possible chemical composition of the studied films was determined as follows:53 x = [Eg(SS) − Eg(PbS)]/[Eg(CdS) − Eg(PbS)](4)where Eg(PbS), Eg(CdS), and Eg(SS) are the energy gap for lead sulfide, cadmium sulfide and CdxPb1−xS solid solution, respectively. The value of the energy gap Eg = 0.46 eV for PbS film was taken from ref. 34, where the same conditions for the film deposition were used. Consequently, the x values for the films deposited from the solutions with 0.01 and 0.02 M of cadmium nitrate were determined to be 0.035 and 0.070, respectively. These values are in agreement with the results of XRD analysis (Table 2). However, for other CdPbS films, there was a difference between the cadmium content in the CdxPb1−xS solid solutions determined from the optical and structural data, where the “optical” values of x were higher than the “structural” values. The reason for this may be associated with the influence of size effect, microstrains, and non-stoichiometry on the Eg value of the thin-film compounds based on lead sulfide.54 As can be seen from the SEM images, the architecture of the films changed significantly with a variation in the cadmium salt concentration in the reactor, which can affect the energy gap. Besides, as noted by Bazhenov et al.,55 the dislocation density has a significant effect on the change in the optical spectra of cadmium sulfide. Therefore, it can be assumed that the high dislocation density ρ = (4.05–4.19) × 1014 m−2 for the CdxPb1−xS solid solution films deposited with 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 M of cadmium nitrate could influence the energy gap value.
The nonlinear dependence of the band gap on the concentration of Cd(NO3)2 in the reaction mixture (Table 3) is correlated with the dependence of cadmium content in the CdxPb1−xS solid solution on the concentration of cadmium salt determined from the structural data (Table 2). Fig. 12 demonstrates the nonlinear evolution of the properties for samples produced with different contents of cadmium nitrate in the reaction mixture, including x in CdxPb1−xS solid solution, total Cd content in film, and value of the band gap. The estimated fraction of amorphous CdS phase (Fig. 12c) was calculated by subtracting the XRD-determined Cd content in the film from the EDX-determined Cd content in the CdxPb1−xS solid solutions. The decrease in the fraction of initial CdS sublayer can be caused by the fact that there is a limit in cadmium content in the CdxPb1−xS solid solution obtained from the employed reaction mixture or that part of the introduced cadmium goes into the interstices of the lead sulfide lattice.

At present, there is no rigorous theory that can explain the deviation of dependence of Eg on the concentration of cadmium salt from linearity. Thus, to explain it, two approximations were used, the dielectric model of Van Wechten and Bergstrasser56 and the pseudopotential model by Hill and Richardson.57 The authors of the first model believed that the decisive role in the deviation of Eg = f([Cd(NO3)2]) from linearity in solid solutions is played by fluctuations of the crystal potential caused by the chaotic arrangement of substitutional atoms. The authors of the second model believed that this deviation is a consequence of the nonlinear properties of the crystal field.

4. Conclusions
Herein, we considered the nonlinear evolution of the composition, structure, and optical properties of thin films of the CdS–PbS system obtained by chemical bath deposition with a gradual change in the content of cadmium nitrate in the reaction mixture from 0.01 to 0.10 M. The analysis of the SEM images of the CdPbS films demonstrated a complex evolution of their microstructure, where the polycrystalline structure transformed into crystallites with smooth edges, then into flat crystallites with uneven edges. The scale hierarchy of CdPbS film particles, parameters of the surface microrelief and fractal dimension of the films determined by AFM made it possible to conclude that the films were predominantly formed by the cluster-particle aggregation mechanism (diffusion-limited aggregation).
X-ray diffraction evidenced the formation of supersaturated single-phase CdxPb1−xS solid solutions (x ≤ 0.094) with a face-centered cubic lattice of NaCl type (B1 structure, Fmm sp.gr.) when the cadmium nitrate concentration in the reactor varied in the range of 0.01–0.08 M. When the content of Cd(NO3)2 increased up to 0.10 M, a two-phase film was formed, consisting of crystallites of the CdxPb1−xS solid solution with x = 0.071 and hexagonal Cd1−δS phase (B4 structure, P63mc sp.gr.). The excess cadmium content in the CdPbS films found by EDX analysis in comparison with that determined from the structural data is associated with the formation of an amorphous CdS phase, which was visually observed in the initial stage of the CBD process, and with the presence of CdS inclusions in the intercrystalline spaces. Auger spectroscopy showed an uneven distribution of chemical elements, including cadmium, over the depth of the films (up to ∼30 nm). The optical properties of the CdxPb1−xS thin-film single-phase solid solutions and two-phase film containing CdxPb1−xS and Cd1−δS were used to determine the band gap of the synthesized compounds, revealing its nonlinear dependence on the concentration of cadmium salt in the reaction mixture. The presented results on the formation of supersaturated substitutional solid solutions and changes in the microstructure and phase composition of the films are a consequence of the high excess of Gibbs free energy inherent in dissipative systems during the CBD process under nonequilibrium conditions.
