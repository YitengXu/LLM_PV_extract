    , Accepted 6th May 2013First published on 13th May 2013AbstractThe quantum efficiency and carrier lifetime that decide the photoconduction (PC) efficiencies in the metal oxide semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been investigated. The experimental result surprisingly shows that the SnO2, TiO2, WO3, and ZnO NWs reveal extraordinary quantum efficiencies in common, which are over one to three orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical expectation. The surface depletion region (SDR)-controlled photoconductivity is proposed to explain the anomalous quantum efficiency and its power dependence. The inherent difference between the metal oxide nanostructures such as carrier lifetime, carrier concentration, and dielectric constant leading to the distinct PC performance and behavior are also discussed.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) of metal oxides, such as ZnO, SnO2, TiO2, WO3, Cu2O, Ga2O3, etc, have stimulated new ideas for development of new-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices due to the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) transport path for carrier and size-confined geometry.1–6 Distinct from other semiconductor systems, such as group IV, III–V and II–VI compounds, metal oxides have highly active surfaces for charge transfer with foreign molecules that could dominate the electronic transport properties. The inherent surface characteristic has been widely studied for fundamental interest and for development of highly sensitive photodetector,5–10 chemical sensor,11 dye-sensitized solar cell,4 and photoelectrochemical device12,13 applications.
Although metal oxide NWs have been used as the building blocks in various light-harvesting devices, the photoconductivities that determine the efficiencies of excess carrier transport and energy-conversion efficiency in the optoelectronic devices are still not yet fully understood. The unique oxygen-sensitized photoconduction (PC) mechanism has allowed the photoconductive gain (Γ) of metal oxide NWs to reach an extremely high level (>106),7–9,14 which is several orders of magnitude higher than the conventional thin film detectors. According to the widely adopted PC model, the long carrier lifetime (τ) is proposed to be the origin of the high-gain transport.7,14 The quantum efficiency (η) is frequently simplified to be near unity based on the thin-film assumption. However, the assumption has neglected an important issue of which the photoconductivities of the NWs are dominated by the near surface area.
In this paper, we point out the η values for PC of the semiconductor NWs are far below the theoretical expectation by over one to three orders of magnitude. By taking into account an effective surface depletion region (SDR) for electron–hole separation and light absorption, the theoretical η can roughly approximate to the experimental values for the different NW materials. In addition, the surface-controlled photoconductivity also explains the η with a weak power-dependent behavior.
Experimental
The thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD), metal–organic (MO) CVD, and hydrothermal approach are utilized for the growth of SnO2,15 TiO2,16 and WO3 NWs,17 respectively. The morphologies and the crystalline structure for the as-grown ensembles of rutile-SnO2 and TiO2 NWs and hexagonal WO3 NWs were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD), respectively (not shown here). The common single-crystalline quality of the metal oxide NWs used for this study was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAD) measurements, as shown in Fig. 1. The single-NW devices were fabricated by focused-ion beam (FIB, FEI Quanta 3D FEG) deposition using Pt (200–500 nm) as contact metals. Detailed information of the diameter (d) and the distance between two contact electrodes (l) for these single-NW devices are illustrated in ESI, Table SI.† Electrical characterization was carried out on an ultra-low current leakage cryogenic probe station (LakeShore Cryotronics TTP4) at room temperature. A semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS) was utilized to source DC bias and to measure current. A He–Cd laser with 325 nm wavelength was used as the excitation source for the power-dependent PC measurements. The incident power of the laser was measured by a calibrated power meter (Ophir Nova II) with a silicon photodiode head (Ophir PD300-UV). A UV holographic diffuser was used to broaden the laser beam size (∼20 mm2) to minimize the error of the power density calculation.

Results and discussion
The electrical contacts of the single-wire devices of SnO2, TiO2, and WO3 were characterized by the dark current versus voltage (id–V) measurements as depicted in Fig. 2, respectively. The linear id–V curves indicate the common ohmic contact condition of the fabricated devices. The typical micrographs and photocurrent response curves under 325 nm excitation for the NW devices are also shown in the insets of Fig. 2.

Prior to the η and τ investigations, an important physical parameter named normalized gain (Γn) that determine PC efficiency has to be defined and calculated. Γn, defined as the product of ητμ, is a useful quantity to define intrinsic PC efficiency of a photoconductor.14,18–20 Different from the device-oriented PC gain,7–9,21–23Γn can not be manipulated by the experimental parameters such as applied bias and inter-electrode distance, which provides an objective view to weight the photoconductor performance. Experimentally Γn can be obtained by the measurement of steady-state photocurrent (ip) according to (1)where E is the photon energy, q is the unit electron charge, and P is the incident optical power on the projected area (A = dl) of the measured NWs, and can be calculated as P = Idl, where I is the incident light intensity.14,18–20

Fig. 3 depicts the Γnversus I curves for the SnO2, TiO2, and WO3 NWs. One data point of the ZnO NWs calculated using the Γ or ip values provided by ref. 7 is also plotted for comparison. The corresponding ip–I curves and required parameters of the individual NW devices for the Γn calculation are listed in Fig. S1 and Table SI in ESI.† From the plots, SnO2 NW is shown to have higher Γn (0.016–5.1 cm2 V−1) in the studied I range than the other nanomaterials. Γn of WO3 NW at the lowest level of ∼1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 is less sensitive to the excitation power. Overall, the Γn reveals the trend of  >  >  > . The comparative study of Γn and Γ of these metal oxide NW devices will be elaborated elsewhere.

To understand the dominant factor of Γn, the τ values and their power dependencies were investigated by the time-resolved PC measurements. Fig. 4 depicts the typical normalized photocurrent rise curves under selected I for the SnO2 and TiO2 NWs. The results show the photocurrent response slows down with a decrease of excitation power density. Fig. 5(a) summarizes the fitting rise time (i.e. τ) versus I for the different NWs. Overall, the τ versus I behaviors of either power-sensitive SnO2 and TiO2 NWs or power-insensitive WO3 NWs agree well with the Γn–I observations. The value of τ for the SnO2 NWs is respectively one and two orders of magnitude higher than for the ZnO and TiO2/WO3 NWs for I of ∼0.4 W m−2, although only one data point can be found for the ZnO NWs in the ref. 7. The longest τ of up to several hundred seconds for SnO2 NWs could explain the optimal Γn in comparison to the other NWs. The result also confirms that the PC efficiency or Γn is dominated by the τ in these metal oxide NWs. The only exception is that at relatively high I (51–760 W m−2), τ of WO3 NWs is close to the values of the SnO2 NWs and even higher than for TiO2 NWs. This result is different from the Γn values in Fig. 3, in which WO3 NWs have the lowest Γn among the studied NWs. In addition, the slopes (κ = 0.70–0.73) of the τ–I curves are slightly smaller than that (κ = 0.85) of the Γn–I curves for the SnO2 and TiO2 NWs. The differences imply that other factors could influence the Γn value and its power dependence.

As Γn is a product of τ, μ, and η, the proportionality of τ does not exactly reflect the difference in Γn, which implies the product of μη also plays a certain role in the photoconductivity. To investigate the μη effect, the μ values have to be defined first because the definition of η might be more complicated in the nanostructures. Experimentally, the μ values of 1D nanostructures can be obtained by the field-effect transistor (FET) measurement. Although the estimated μ values show some differences between the different groups, generally the single-crystalline NWs exhibit moderate μ levels in comparison to the bulk crystal or epitaxial film counterparts. Accordingly, the μ values of the NWs or single crystals (see Table 1) obtained from the references were adopted for the calculation of η.24–33 The calculated η values for the studied NWs corresponding to their Γn (Fig. 3) and τ (Fig. 5(a)) in the same I ranges are plotted in Fig. 5(b).

As η in dark or low I excitation conditions more closely approximates the intrinsic value (the reason will be explained later), only the maximal η at the lowest available I in Fig. 5(b) will be compared and discussed, and the values are listed in Table 1. Before looking into the η difference between the different NWs, it is already found that the overall η values at 0.0052–0.33% are much smaller than 1% except the 1.7% of TiO2, which are far below the normal expected level. The theoretical quantum efficiency (ηT) calculated by the equation ηT = (1 − Ro)(1 − e−αd) for the planar films with the same thickness (i.e. d) as the NWs are also listed in Table 1 for comparison, where Ro is the optical reflectivity and α is the optical absorption coefficient. The adopted Ro and α values can be found in Table SII in the ESI.† The calculation shows the ηT values are in the reasonable range of 65–74%. However, the experimental η values for the NWs are over one to four orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding ηT.
As η depends on reflection loss and optical absorption, to specify the origin of the low η, the incident light angle-dependent PC measurement has been performed. Fig. S2 (see ESI†) illustrates the photocurrent versus incident angle (θ) from the normal of a laser beam for a single SnO2 NW at E = 3.82 eV. The result shows that the photocurrent did not exhibit a substantial difference but oscillates within 12% of its center value while changing θ from −75° to 75°. As total reflection could take place, leading to a very small ηex for the prism-like NWs and especially the triangular NWs, the photocurrent without significant angle dependence rules out huge reflection loss in η.
Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that the small η is caused by the low optical absorption efficiency. As α is an intrinsic quantity, its value is independent on the dimension and geometry of the crystals. To explain the extraordinary η, the presence of the “effective” light absorption area is proposed. According to the previous understanding, the metal oxide NWs follow the surface-controlled PC mechanisms.5–7,9,14,15,34–36 The photoconductivities of the unintentionally doped n-type metal-oxide NWs, including ZnO, SnO2, TiO2, and WO3, have been attributed to the oxygen-sensitized PC mechanism.
As the adsorbed oxygen on the surface plays a role as an acceptor-like surface state or a surface electron-trap state, in air the oxygen molecules capture free electrons on the surface leading to the formation of SDR or surface band bending. The SDR that produces a surface electric field plays an important role on the electron–hole pair (ehp) spatial separation under photoexcitation. The excess holes swept to the surface due to the surface electric field recombine (or neutralize) with the charged oxygen ions, resulting in surface oxygen desorption.7,14,35,36 The process generates unpaired excess electrons transport along the NW core which exhibit long τ and thus high Γ. In addition, the photo-induced oxygen desorption could simultaneously result in an increase of dark (or background) current. Experimentally, the value of the dark current offset can be estimated by the different background current level before and after laser illumination and has to be excluded in the photocurrent estimation.
According to the model, the photocurrent is dominated by the unpaired (long-lifetime) excess electrons which are only generated in the SDR. This is confirmed by the measured NWs having a long lifetime on the time-scale of seconds to hundreds of seconds (Fig. 5(a)), which is several orders of magnitude higher than the microsecond or nanosecond scale in their bulk counterparts. As the ehp generated in the neutral region recombine rapidly, which is hardly collected by the electrodes and unable to contribute photocurrent, only the SDR can serve as an effective light absorption region in the NWs. Fig. 6(a) schematically shows the spatial separation and direct recombination of ehp in the SDR and neutral region, respectively.
 Fig. 6  (a) The schematic band diagram shows the spatial separation and direct recombination of ehp in the SDR and neutral region, respectively. (b) The comparison of the linear and exponential spatial distribution of the surface electric field (Es(x)) for the SDR with an assumed width (w) at 100 nm defined by the linear assumption. The weff is the effective surface depletion width. 
To understand the ratio of surface depletion width (w) to NW radius (r), the theoretical w were calculated for the different NWs. As the SDR induced by the surface electron trap state in a n-type semiconductor is similar to the depleted n region in a p++n or Schottky diode, the w and its barrier height (ϕB) can be expressed as37 (2) (3)where εr is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant, εo is the permittivity of free space, n is the carrier concentration at ∼300 K, k is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature set at 300 K. The intrinsic carrier concentration (ni) can be calculated using the equation of ni = [NcNvexp(−Eg/kT)]1/2, where Nc (= 2(2πm*ekT/h2)3/2) and Nv (= 2(2πm*hkT/h2)3/2) are the effective density of states in the conduction band and valence band, respectively, Eg is the bandgap, and m*e and m*h are the effective mass of electron and hole, respectively.37 The n of the NWs was calculated by the measured conductivity (σ) and the reported μ values in the references. All the major parameters and their corresponding w values are listed in Table 1. The other parameters can be found in the Table SII in the ESI.†
The calculation shows that the theoretical w values for the NWs are all below 45 nm, which is much smaller than the r with the value larger than 110 nm. Taking the ratio of w/r into account, the modified ηT or the effective quantum efficiency (ηeff) here will come to 1–26%. Although the small w/r ratio (= 0.015–0.33) could partially explain the low η observed by PC measurement, the experimental η at 0.0052–1.7% are still lower than the calculated values. To further explain the difference, a concept of effective SDR is proposed. As the surface electric field plays a key role in the electron–hole separation, the profile of field magnitude along the radial direction could provide a further clue. Generally, the spatial distribution of the electric field is a linear function under the assumption of uniform space charge density (ρ) in the depletion region with a fixed width, i.e. ρ(x) = constant in the Poisson equation.37 However, the real charge distribution actually is more like an exponential function as the equilibrium of the Fermi level in the junction interface or crystal surface is achieved by the diffusion mechanism. While modifying the Poisson equation by introducing ρ(x) ∝ exp(−x/x0), where x0 is a decay constant, the obtained surface electric field spatial distribution function (Es(x)) will also be an exponential form, i.e. Es(x) ∝ exp(−x/x0).

Fig. 6(b) depicts a comparison of the linear and exponential Es(x) for the SDR with an assumed w of 100 nm defined by the linear assumption. While assuming the same maximal field on the surface, i.e. Es(x = 0), we may notice that the field magnitude of the exponential Es(x) drops much faster than the linear one from its maximum at surface. Since the line shape of the exponential Es(x) depends on x0, x0 was assumed to be 10 nm to roughly estimate the width of the effective SDR which is defined as the depletion region with sufficiently high field magnitude to produce long-lifetime carrier for PC. To simplify the definition, the critical field for effective ehp separation was assumed to be 0.1Es(x = 0), i.e. below the critical field the generated ehp would not have long enough lifetime to contribute photocurrent. Under the assumption, the width of the effective SDR (weff) can be estimated. For the example, in Fig. 6(b), weff for the exponential Es(x) is 23 nm, which is about one-fourth of that (90 nm) for the linear one.
By taking the weff/w (∼0.23) into account, the definition of ηeff should be modified to ηeff = (weff/w)(w/r)ηT = (weff/r)ηT and the calculated ηeff would further decrease to the range of 0.24–6.0% for the studied NWs (Table 1). The experimental η values are still lower than the theoretical ηeff, especially for the WO3 NWs. However, the overall ηeff already approximates to the same order of magnitude as the η values. A few factors could still result in the underestimated η, including (i) the additional reflection loss due to the indefinable cross-sectional shape of the single NWs, (ii) the overestimated mobility, and (iii) the reduced width of SDR due to the band-flattening effect by light illumination.
The TiO2 NW is the only one among the studied NWs with practical η close to theoretical ηeff. According to the morphological observation using TEM (Fig. 1) and FESEM (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†), MOCVD-grown TiO2 NWs have substantial surface roughness in nature which is different from the smooth SnO2 and WO3 NWs. The rough surface could reduce reflection loss and enhance light absorption, making the experimental η higher than the theoretical value. In addition, due to the low PC efficiency in the WO3 NWs, the detectable photocurrent can only be obtained at a relatively high excitation power condition (Fig. 3). This could lead to significant shortening of SDR and explain the η of the WO3 NW being more underestimated in comparison to the other NWs.
Although the estimation of ηeff is based on some assumptions and the adopted parameters, the proposition of the presence of the effective SDR still successfully explains the extraordinary η, which are orders of magnitude lower than the conventionally defined ηT. In addition, the η between the different NWs obtained by the experimental measurement is also in good agreement with the theoretical calculation. Fig. 5(b) indicates the average η values of the different NWs showing the trend of ηTiO2 > ηZnO > ηSnO2 > ηWO3, the experimental trend is consistent with the calculated ηeff results after considering the TiO2 NWs with rough surface and some uncertainties of the adopted parameter from the references of the ZnO NWs. Overall, the TiO2 and ZnO NWs reveal higher η (or ηeff), which can be explained by their relatively high εr and low n (see Table 1), since the w is determined by (εr/n)1/2 according to the eqn (2).
Furthermore, the presence of the effective SDR can also explain the behavior of the power-dependent η in Fig. 5(b). In principle, η depends on α and R, which is constant while the photon energy is fixed. The η–I curves follow a weak inverse power law of η ∝ I−κ, where κ = 0.12–0.15 for the SnO2 and TiO2 NWs, which is somewhat unexpected. However, the abnormal behavior of η actually agrees the aforementioned model in which the light absorption efficiency is controlled by the effective SDR. As the SDR is sensitive to the light intensity due to the photovoltaic effect and photo-induced surface oxygen desorption and the η is now a function of weff, increase of I will reduce the density of space charges (including uncompensated donor ions and charged surface oxygen ions) in the depletion region and thus shortens w (or weff) and lowers η.
Conclusions
Anomalous quantum efficiencies for PC which are far below the theoretical expectation in the different metal oxide NW systems have been demonstrated. The proposition of SDR-dominant photoconductivity for these 1D nanostructures could provide a probable explanation to the anomalous value of quantum efficiency and its power dependence. The intrinsic properties such as carrier lifetime, carrier concentration and dielectric constant that lead to the different PC performance and behavior between the metal oxide NWs have also been addressed. The low quantum efficiency and long carrier lifetime actually reflect the nature of “surface-dominant photoconductivity” in these semiconductor NWs.
