    , Accepted 6th January 2023First published on 12th January 2023AbstractInorganic CsPbI2Br halide perovskites have been widely explored as absorber layers for solar cell applications due to their higher thermal and phase stability. However, the CsPbI2Br solar cells experience several problems, such as (i) a poor CsPbI2Br film morphology, (ii) a large energy offset at the CsPbI2Br/charge transporting layers (CTLs) or CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interfaces, (iii) large tensile strain between the CsPbI2Br and CTLs and (iv) addition of hygroscopic dopants in the commonly used hole transporting layer (HTL) accelerating the device degradation process. This review article is dedicated to providing fundamental knowledge of inorganic CsPbI2Br halide perovskites, as well as an up-to-date review on the development of CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from 2021 to 2022 through optimization of CsPbI2Br films, optimization of CTLs, interface engineering, etc. The authors start by discussing the challenges in CsPbI2Br PSCs, followed by the optimization methodologies to gain highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br PSCs. Finally, conclusions and future outlook are presented for developing CsPbI2Br PSCs with high efficiency and superior stability.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials are unstable under humid and thermal conditions due to the hygroscopic and volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), which seriously affects the performance and stability of the devices. By replacing organic cations with inorganic caesium (Cs+) cations, the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials is significantly improved. Among inorganic perovskite materials such as CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2 and CsPbBr3, CsPbI2Br exhibits excellent phase stability and a suitable energy bandgap for solar cell applications. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made toward the construction of highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in recent years. In this review, a detailed review on CsPbI2Br halide perovskite materials, their recent progress and the remaining challenges in the field of CsPbI2Br PSCs are presented.

1. Introduction
Halide perovskites are ideal absorber layers for solar cell applications because of their long carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, adjustable energy bandgap (Eg), low exciton binding energy, etc. At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has reached >25.0%, comparable to that of commercial photovoltaic technologies.1 However, the organic component of halide perovskites, such as methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+), has impeded their commercialization due to their poor thermal and chemical stability. For instance, the MAPbI3 perovskite (Eg = 1.51 eV) is thermodynamically unstable and undergoes a structural transformation from tetragonal to cubic phases at 57 °C.2 Additionally, it decomposes to lead iodide (PbI2), hydroiodic acid (HI) and methylamine (CH2NH2) gas when the cell operating temperature reaches 85 °C or in contact with humid air.3 As a consequence, MAPbI3 limits the long-term operational stability of the solar cells. By replacing MA+ with FA+, the Eg of the perovskite (FAPbI3) is reduced to 1.48 eV, and the thermal stability of the FAPbI3 film is significantly improved.4 However, at room temperature (RT), the FAPbI3 exists as a non-perovskite hexagonal yellow δ-phase, which seriously deteriorates the performance of solar cells.5 For these reasons, caesium (Cs+) has been proposed to replace MA+ and FA+, attributed to the fact that fully inorganic CsPbX3 (X = I− or Br−) perovskites are stable up to their melting point of >460 °C.6
Generally, CsPbI3 (Eg = 1.73 eV) needs a high sintering temperature of ∼300 °C to achieve a perovskite black cubic α-phase. Upon cooling to RT, it degrades into a non-perovskite orthorhombic yellow δ-phase with a wider Eg (2.82 eV) and does not contribute to light absorption after 550 nm.7 On the other hand, CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 exhibit wider bandgaps of ∼2.32 eV8 and ∼2.05 eV,9 respectively, which are too large and not suitable to be used as absorber layers for solar cell applications. By adjusting the I− and Br− concentrations of CsPbX3, CsPbI2Br perovskites with higher α-phase stability (versus CsPbI3)10 and a suitable Eg of 1.92 eV (vs. CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2) can be obtained.6 Under thermal stress conditions, the CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) also exhibited a higher PCE temperature coefficient when compared with commercial silicon and copper indium gallium selenide solar cells.11 Due to the weak binding energy of CsPbI2Br, the free charge carriers formed inside the perovskite materials after photon absorption can be immediately extracted to the respective carrier transporting layers with a very slow charge carrier recombination loss.1 Therefore, CsPbI2Br has attracted much interest and is considered a promising absorber material for solar cell applications (Fig. 1a–d).

The basic chemical formula of perovskites can be denoted as ABX3, where A, B and X represent Cs+, Pb2+ and (I−/Br−), respectively. To achieve a stable CsPbI2Br cubic structure, the Gold-Schmidt tolerance factor  should be in the range between 0.8 and 1.0 (0.8 < t < 1.0), where RA, RB and RX are the ionic radii for Cs+, Pb2+ and I−/Br−, respectively. By putting Shannon radius (Cs+ = 1.88 Å, Pb2+ = 1.19 Å, I− = 2.20 Å and Br− = 1.96 Å)12 into this equation, an effective t of 0.855 could be obtained for the CsPbI2Br perovskite. If t < 0.8 or t > 1, it will lead to a distortion of the nonperovskite phase, which is not suitable to act as a light absorber layer for solar cell applications.13 Besides, the ratio of RB/RX, or known as the octahedral factor (μ), has also been used to clarify the formability of ABX3 halide perovskites. When μ is in the range between 0.377 and 0.895 (0.377 < μ < 0.895), the ABX3 structure is stable.14
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the CsPbI2Br perovskite is stable in pseudo-cubic and pseudo-tetragonal phases for α-CsPbI2Br (Fig. 1e) and β-CsPbI2Br (Fig. 1f), respectively, attributed to the lattice parameter c, which is always smaller than a and b. As is well known, Br− is shorter than I−. Thus, the bond length of Pb–Br (2.98 Å) is shorter than that of Pb–I (3.21 Å) in the PbI4Br2 octahedron.15 Even though the CsPbI2Br exhibits α- and β-phases, it has similar electronic structures. From the site-projected band structure, it is found that the Br 4p orbital has little contribution to the valence band maximum (VBM) when compared with the I 5p orbital, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) mainly relies on the Pb 6p orbital. The calculated Eg values through DFT for α-CsPbI2Br and β-CsPbI2Br are 1.94 eV and 2.30 eV, respectively. By contrast, partial density of states (PDOS) indicates that the VBM consists of Pb 6s–I 5p states, while the CBM is composed of Pb 6p states. And, Cs+ cations have rarely contributed to the electronic structure.15 Through spatially separated pump–probe microscopy, the diffusion constant ranging between 0.13 and 0.39 cm2 s−1 is obtained for the CsPbI2Br film, which corresponds to the more commonly referenced ambipolar charge carrier mobility of 5 to 15 cm2 V s−1 through the Einstein relationship (, where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature).16 In addition, the absorption edge of the α-CsPbI2Br film is near 650 nm, which corresponds to a bandgap of Eg of ∼1.9 eV (Fig. 1g),6,17 and the Bragg peaks at 2θ = 14.6 and 29.5° are ascribed to the (100) and (200) crystal planes of the α-CsPbI2Br (Fig. 1h).6,17
In this review, we begin with the common challenges of CsPbI2Br PSCs (Section 2). Subsequently, the progress of CsPbI2Br PSCs from 2021 to 2022 is summarized, including the optimization of the CsPbI2Br films via dopant engineering, optimization of the electron transporting layer (ETL) or the hole transporting layer (HTL) by designing new types of functional layers or via dopant engineering, interface engineering, etc. (Section 3). Finally, we provide conclusions and future perspectives to guide the readers in developing highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br PSCs (Section 4).
2. Critical challenges of CsPbI2Br PSCs
In contrast to the DFT calculations, the black cubic α-phase CsPbI2Br in practical applications is unstable and tends to convert into the most stable orthorhombic δ-phase CsPbI2Br under ambient conditions,18 which poses a major hurdle in the path toward commercial viability. The reason for phase instability of CsPbI2Br can be related to the much smaller inorganic Cs+ cation to hold the PbI62− octahedron yielding an unsatisfactory tolerance factor of CsPbI2Br of <0.919 and the moisture penetration to the CsPbI2Br film surface induces vacancies that can lower the free-energy barrier of the phase transformation.20 However, some works show that the preparation of the CsPbI2Br film in optimized air moisture passivates the defects of the CsPbI2Br film21 and forms the Pb–O bond that is beneficial to suppress the α to δ-phase transition of the CsPbI2Br film.22 In addition, the CsPbI2Br film exhibits a halide segregation effect when exposed to sunlight illumination, during which the halide ions can migrate through the halogen vacancies and lead to the formation of Br−rich and I− rich domains.23 Furthermore, huge energy loss (i.e. Eloss = Eg − eVOC, where Eg is the optical energy bandgap of CsPbI2Br, e is the elementary charge of an electron and VOC is open-circuit voltage of the device, respectively) is unavoidable for the CsPbI2Br film, attributed to the (i) inferior film quality derived from solution-processing (i.e. low surface coverage, small grain size and high-density defects of the CsPbI2Br film), (ii) imperfect energy band offsets at the interfaces of CsPbI2Br/charge transporting layers and (iii) large thermal expansion mismatch between the perovskite film (αTE: ∼10−4 K−1) and the carrier transport layer (i.e. TiO2, SnO2, or NiOx with αTE: 0.1 ∼2 × 10−5 K−1) or a large temperature gradient from perovskite formation temperature (i.e., >160 °C for CsPbI2Br) to RT inducing tensile strain at the perovskite/CTL interface, which leads to severe nonradiative charge recombination and VOC reduction.24–29 In addition, the crystallization kinetics of the CsPbI2Br perovskite film is poor at low temperatures.30 The CsPbI2Br film requires a high sintering temperature of >250 °C to maintain the black cubic α-phase with excellent film morphology,31 which is energy consuming and not suitable for flexible-based device application. On the other hand, the commonly employed HTL of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-bis(pmethoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) requires lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) dopants to facilitate the hole transport in the device. However, under working or heating conditions, the hygroscopic and diffusive nature of these dopants can accelerate the CsPbI2Br film degradation process and degrade the device performance, despite the thermostability of CsPbI2Br perovskites.32,33 To overcome this issue, a carbon electrode is typically applied due to its low cost, excellent electrical conductivity and a high hydrophobic surface, which can protect the perovskite film from moisture. Additionally, a carbon electrode can be deposited in a vacuum-free environment, thus\ making it cost-effective when compared with the high vacuum-deposited metallic electrode (Au, Ag and Al).34,35 Thus, the carbon electrode has been used to replace the traditional expensive spiro-OMeTAD HTL and noble metallic electrode.36 However, poor interface contact and large energy offset between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and the work function (WF) (or Fermi-level) of the carbon anode (∼–5.0 eV) increases the energy barrier and restricts the hole transfer from the CsPbI2Br perovskite to the carbon anode, resulting in severe charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/C interface and poor device performance, especially a low photovoltage.37
3. Strategies for boosting the performance and stability of CsPbI2Br PSCs
Each layer in the device architecture plays a non-ignorable role in achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs. In the following subsections, we will discuss the optimization of CsPbI2Br PSCs from 2021 to 2022, namely the optimization of the CsPbI2Br film via the dopant technique, the optimization of the ETL or HTL by designing a new type of functional layer or via the dopant technique, interface engineering, etc.
3.1 Optimization of the CsPbI2Br film via dopant engineering
Recent works have shown that incorporating dopants in the CsPbI2Br precursor has several advantages, such as
(i) Optimize the CsPbI2Br film morphology by modulating the crystal growth process and suppressing the defect state of the CsPbI2Br bulk film;
(ii) Optimize the energy level of CsPbI2Br to match with the ETL or HTL;
(iii) Optimize the phase stability of the CsPbI2Br film;
(iv) Optimize charge extraction from CsPbI2Br to the respective electrodes;
(v) Reduce device hysteresis and improve the stability of CsPbI2Br PSCs;
These advantages are beneficial to produce highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br PSCs. The photovoltaic properties and stability evolutions of CsPbI2Br PSCs after optimization, regardless of the regular or inverted structure, are listed in Table 1.

3.1.1 Molecule-based dopant. 
High electron density of the S atoms in thioacetamide (TAA) can form better coordination with Pb2+, resulting in highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains. As a result, the trap density of the CsPbI2Br film was reduced to 2.85 × 1015 cm−3 from 6.19 × 1015 cm−3, which facilitates charge carrier extraction and suppresses charge recombination in the device. Owing to the increased hydrophobicity film surface after modification, the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film improved. Consequently, the device under investigation with 0.1% TAA achieved a higher PCE of 15.87% (a short-circuit current density, JSC, of 16.47 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V and a fill-factor, FF, of 0.765) and excellent operational stability under ambient conditions.38 On the other hand, 4-guanidinobenzoic-acidhydrochloride (4-GBACl, Fig. 2a) in the CsPbI2Br precursor (i) retarded the perovskite crystallization process and induced the formation of the excellent CsPbI2Br film morphology, which linked to the interaction between 4-GBACl (i.e., GA+, –COOH and Cl− groups) and CsPbI2Br (i.e., undercoordinated halide species, undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, and Pb clusters at the grain boundaries and surface) could passivate the defect states, (ii) improved the phase stability and suppressed ion migration of the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite. No α to δ-phase transition or changes in the PL spectrum were observed for the modified film after exposure to ambient air (30% RH) for a half-day and one sun illumination, respectively, (iii) minimized the energy offset between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD from 0.26 eV to 0.18 eV, which improved hole transport ability and reduced charge recombination in the device and (v) acted as a moisture barrier to prevent the moisture invasion to the CsPbI2Br film. A PCE of 15.59% (a JSC of 15.42 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.790) was obtained for the device under investigation with 4 mg mL−1 4-GBACl, and also higher environmental (i.e. N2 atmosphere and ambient air), light and thermal stability was demonstrated.24 Through DFT calculations, it was found that Na+ of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) could be incorporated into the A-site of the CsPbI2Br lattice (substitution of Cs+), rather than the interstitial site between two A-sites in the CsPbI2Br cell (Fig. 2b), attributed to its lower formation enthalpy. With Na+ addition, the I− diffusion energy barrier of CsPbI2Br was increased to 0.401 eV from 0.229 eV, resulting in low iodide vacancies in the CsPbI2Br film. On the other hand, SCN− enlarged perovskite grains and induced highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with excellent electrical properties. Benefitting from these, a lower defect state density of 9.36 × 1014 cm−3 (versus 1.63 × 1015 cm−3 for the control film) with a longer PL lifetime of 27.27 ns (versus 16.45 ns for the control film) was achieved for the CsPbI2Br film with 0.5% NaSCN. Consequently, the modified HTL-free carbon-based electrode CsPbI2Br (C-CsPbI2Br) PSCs achieved the best PCE of 14.63% (a JSC of 14.31 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.27 V and a FF of 0.807), and exhibited outstanding ambient stability.39

3.1.2 Low dimension-based dopant. 
By mixing PbI2 and terpyridine (Tpy) in hydroiodic acid or the DMSO solvent, low dimension (LD) perovskites were obtained. The as-obtained perovskite crystal from the PbI2-Tpy precursor was then used as a dopant in the CsPbI2Br precursor to form an 1D–2D–3D heterojunction perovskite, where 1D, 2D and 3D were Tpy2Pb3I6, TpyPb3I6 and CsPbI2Br, respectively. Owing to the fact that the organic cation of Tpy could assemble with the [PbI6]2− octahedral framework along the [001] direction at regular intervals and form π–π stacking organic molecules at the A-site, the charge transport, tensile strain and moisture resistance of the 1D–2D–3D heterojunction perovskites were promoted, reduced and improved, respectively. Accordingly, the modified 1D–2D–3D device showed a significant improvement in PCE by a factor of 43% with a PCE of 16.13% (a JSC of 16.03 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.29 V and a FF of 0.780), as well as demonstrated excellent stability with respect to the control device.40 Later, AqPbI3(II) (Aminoquinoline, Aq) was used as a dopant after the isomerization process of the as-synthesized AqPbI3(I) perovskite crystal in the CsPbI2Br precursor through thermal treatment in the DMSO–acetonitrile solvent. The formation of the 1D perovskite not only enhanced π electron delocalization and promoted electron transfer from the 1D AqPbI3(II) chain to 3D CsPbI2Br, but also reduced the energy offset between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the water stability of the 1D–3D heterojunction perovskite was significantly improved, attributed to the smaller layer spacing of the Aq conjugated rings (i.e., 3.9 Å), effectively blocking the invasion of water molecules. Thus, the best PCE of 16.10% (a JSC of 16.40 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.23 V and a FF of 0.800) with excellent ambient and thermal stabilities was achieved for the 1D–3D device with 1.5 mg mL−1 Aq-PbI3(II).41 On the other hand, the incorporation of 2D (Cr(III)TPy2)2Pb5I16 (also known as the Cr-MOF) in the CsPbI2Br precursor enlarged the perovskite grains and minimized the energy barrier at the NiOx/CsPbI2Br interface from 0.74 eV to 0.58 eV. Accordingly, a PCE of 17.02% (a JSC of 16.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.30 V and a FF of 0.790) was obtained for the device under investigation with 1 mg mL−1 2D (Cr(III)TPy2)2Pb5I16. More importantly, 2D (Cr(III)TPy2)2Pb5I16 anchored at the surface of the 3D CsPbI2Br film could prevent the erosion from moisture, thereby improving the device stability.42 Glycine iodide (Gly-I) in the CsPbI2Br precursor decelerated the crystallization process of CsPbI2Br, resulting in a more compact and dense surface film with larger CsPbI2Br grains. Furthermore, the interaction between the large organic molecules of glycine (Gly) and PbI2 induced the formation of the LD 2D Gly4PbI4 perovskite at the perovskite grain boundaries, which (i) inhibited the charge trapping and recombination, (ii) formed a barrier to moisture invasion and (iii) blocked iodine migration to minimize the phase separation. Consequently, the device under investigation with 6% Gly-I achieved the best PCE of 17.26% (a JSC of 16.04 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.33 V and a FF of 0.809), as well as exhibited superior stability under ambient, thermal, and light stress conditions.23


3.1.3 Liquid-based dopant. 
As a high thermal annealing temperature could destroy the perovskite octahedral structure and induce poor CsPbI2Br film morphology, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was introduced into the CsPbI2Br precursor to passivate the Pb2+-related defects of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. With NMP, the damaged perovskite octahedral structure was reconstructed, and the pinholes were passivated through the coordination between NMP and Pb2+ of the perovskite, forming a Lewis base adduct. Accordingly, a highly crystalline CsPbI2Br film with pinhole-free morphology, as well as shallow grain boundaries, was obtained, which facilitates the charge carrier transport rather than counteracting in the CsPbI2Br bulk film. The device under investigation with 2.5% NMP exhibited a higher PCE of 16.77% (a JSC of 16.70 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V and an FF of 0.800), as well as higher device stability in the N2 atmosphere.43 The multifunctional groups (CO and C–OH) of the 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) liquid dopant in the CsPbI2Br precursor not only had a good interaction with uncoordinated ions of CsPbI2Br (i.e., CO interacted with Pb2+ and –OH interacted with halide species), but could also be polymerized to form a compact hydrophobic polymer at the perovskite grain boundaries by breaking the CC bond at 160 °C (Fig. 2c). As a result, HEMA induced the formation of highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains, leading to excellent electrical properties and improved moisture resistance. Consequently, a PCE of 16.13% (a JSC of 15.81 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.23 V and a FF of 0.830) with higher environmental stability (i.e., N2 atmosphere and ambient air) was achieved for the device under investigation with 3 mg mL−1 HEMA (Fig. 2d and e).44 According to the DFT calculations, the ionic liquid dopant of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF6) in the CsPbI2Br precursor reduced the formation energy of the α-CsPbI2Br perovskite, thereby restraining the distortion of [PX6]4− octahedrons and improving α-CsPbI2Br perovskite phase stability. Furthermore, BMIMPF6 also enhanced the dipole moment of the CsPbI2Br film and reduced the Urbach energy and the lattice strain, which were associated with trap states and lattice distortion. As a result, better phase/structural stability of the α-CsPbI2Br perovskite with excellent electrical properties (i.e. more conductive, 13.7 vs. 43.1 μS cm−1 and longer PL lifetime, 2.35 vs. 9.84 ns) was obtained for the device with 0.15wt% BMIMPF6, yielding an optimized PCE of 16.20% (a JSC of 16.40 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.769) along with excellent stability. After storing in ambient at 30% RH for 7 months, the dark brown colour of the modified CsPbI2Br film remained the same.45


3.1.4 Ammonium-based dopant. 
Incorporation of the (chloromethylene)-dimethylammonium chloride (CDCl) dopant in the CsPbI2Br precursor improved the α-CsPbI2Br perovskite phase stability and induced the formation of larger perovskite grains, which helped to suppress the defect states and the charge recombination in CsPbI2Br films. As a result, a PCE of 16.02% (a JSC of 16.95 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V and a FF of 0.750) along with higher ambient stability was achieved for the device under investigation with 0.015 M CDCl.46 On the other hand, tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) reduced pinholes and cracks of the CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 2f and g) and increased the hydrophobicity of the CsPbI2Br film, thereby protecting the perovskite film from heat and moisture. No change in colour or PbI2 elements were observed for the modified film after exposing it to heat at 85 °C in ambient air with 40% RH for 72 hours. Accordingly, a PCE of 14.12% (a JSC of 15.08 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.19 V and a FF of 0.780) with higher stability was obtained for the device under investigation with 3 wt% TMACl, attributed to the high quality of the CsPbI2Br film facilitating the carrier extraction and suppressing the charge recombination in the device.47 With the addition of ethylammonium bromide (EABr) in the CsPbI2Br precursor, the intermediate phase of CsI–EABr–DMSO–PbX2 was facilitated, which induced the formation of the highly crystalline CsPbI2Br film with larger perovskite grains up to micron size (i.e., 1.5 μm) and reduced grain boundary defects. Benefitting from this, the charge recombination was suppressed, and the charge transport was promoted. A PCE of 14.47% (a JSC of 15.49 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.24 V and a FF of 0.755) with outstanding thermal stability was achieved for the device under investigation with 4 mg mL−1 EABr.48


3.1.5 Halide-based dopant. 
With the addition of indium(III) chloride (InCl3) in CsPbI2Br, a thicker single crystalline CsPbI2Br film with better energy level alignment between the CsPbI2Br and CTLs was formed. Furthermore, the well-distributed InCl3 within the perovskite grains passivated the grain defects, which led to the reduction of charge recombination, efficient carrier extraction and suppression of ion-migration for the modified film. As a result, a PCE of 15.27% (a JSC of 15.91 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.749) with negligible hysteresis was obtained for the 0.25% InCl3 modified device, and higher device stability was demonstrated compared to the control device. When InCl3 was replaced with a 5% europium(II) iodide (EuI2) dopant, the modified device exhibited a lower PCE of 13.72% (a JSC of 14.90 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.25 V and a FF of 0.738), but with higher operational stability with respect to the 0.25% InCl3 modified device (Fig. 2h).18 On the other hand, strontium(II) iodide (SrI2) induced the formation of high-compact CsPbI2Br film morphology with limited trap centres and suppressed the δ-phase transition in the CsPbI2Br film. At an optimum doping concentration of 2% SrI2, the trap density of the perovskite film was reduced (i.e., 1.98 versus 2.17 × 1016 cm−3), thereby improving the hole transport ability (i.e., a higher hole mobility of 4.34 versus 3.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) and minimizing the charge recombination process (i.e., a longer PL lifetime of 20.45 versus 13.57 ns) of the CsPb0.98Sr0.02I2Br film. Benefitting from these, a PCE of 16.61% (a JSC of 16.11 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.32 V and a FF of 0.780) with higher ambient and phase stability was achieved for the CsPb0.98Sr0.02I2Br device.49 Thanks to the smaller ionic size of Fe2+ (i.e., 78 pm versus 119 pm for Pb2+) in iron(II) chloride (FeCl2) that could partially substitute Pb2+ in CsPbI2Br, the tolerance factor of the perovskite was increased (i.e., 0.85 for CsPbI2Br and 0.96 for CsPb1−xSrxI2Br). With FeCl2, smaller perovskite grains (i.e., 200–300 versus 500 nm for CsPbI2Br) with good connection between grains were obtained. Additionally, the energy barrier between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD was minimized to 0.13 from 0.21 eV, which improved the hole transport ability and reduced the charge recombination. As a result, the FeCl2 reduced the trap state density (i.e., 7.1 × 1015versus 1.6 × 1016 cm−3), and increased the PL lifetime (37.7 versus 13.6 ns) of the perovskite film after being modified with 0.5% FeCl2. A PCE of 17.10% (a JSC of 15.90 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.31 V and a FF of 0.818) with excellent light stability was achieved for the device under investigation.50 The incorporation of the imidazole halide, IMX (X: I and Br), inhibited the direct formation of 3D CsPbI2Br, which linked to the formation of 2D (IMCs)2PbI4−xBrx (with PbI2/PbBr2 in the precursor) and 3D CsPbI1.5Br1.5 nuclei during the spin-coating process. Under ambient air conditions, the formation of the 2D intermediate phase not only inhibited the perovskite crystallization process, but also stabilized the α-phase of the inorganic perovskite, which then released PbI2/PbBr2 to transform into pure 3D α-CsPbI2Br upon thermal treatment (Fig. 2i). The remaining amorphous IMX materials (i.e., after the annealing process) could strengthen the perovskite grain boundaries and passivate the grain boundary defects, thereby forming larger perovskite grains and a compact surface with thicker perovskite films (i.e., 560 versus 370 nm for the control CsPbI2Br film) and preventing the invasion of air-moisture to the perovskite film. In addition to improving the film morphology, the interface contact between the perovskite and CTLs was also improved after modification. As a result, a PCE of 17.26% (a JSC of 16.56 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.816) with outstanding operational stability was achieved for the device under investigation with 0.5 M IMX (IMX:CsI = 0.5:1).51 Gadolinium(III) chloride (GdCl3) in CsPbI2Br increased the tolerance factor of perovskite to 0.88 (i.e., CsPb1−xGdxI2Br), attributed to the smaller ionic radius of Gd3+ (i.e., 94 pm) partially substituting Pb2+ (i.e., 119 pm) and inserted into the parent lattice of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. With GdCl3 addition, the perovskite crystallization process was facilitated, yielding dense perovskite films with smaller perovskite grains (150 versus 315 nm for CsPbI2Br film), which is beneficial to stabilizing the phase stability of the perovskite. Moreover, the energy band alignment between the CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD was optimized, thereby lowering the energy barrier and suppressing the charge recombination at the interface. As a result, a longer PL lifetime (20.07 versus 8.01 ns for the control film) and a lower trap state density (2.30 versus 4.99 × 1015 cm−3 for the control film) was obtained for the CsPbI2Br film with 0.4% GdCl3. A PCE of 16.24% (a JSC of 16.09 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.22 V and a FF of 0.826) was achieved for the 0.4% GdCl3 modified device. The long-term operational stability of the device under investigation (versus the control device) under ambient air, thermal stress and light stress conditions could be attributed to GdCl3 improving the tolerance factor, hydrophobicity and phase stability of the CsPb1−xGdxI2Br film.52 On the other hand, the incorporation of samarium(II) iodide (SmI2) in CsPbI2Br was found to (i) partially be oxidized to Sm3+, forming a redox couple of Sm3+/Sm2+, which could contribute to promoting the conversion of Pb0 and I0 to Pb2+ and I−, respectively, and repairing in situ defects of the CsPbI2Br film, (ii) decrease the nucleation sites of CsPbI2Br, thereby inducing smaller CsPbI2Br perovskite grains (180 versus 490 nm) with increased surface energy and a better stable α-phase CsPbI2Br and (iii) increase the ion-migration barrier of the CsPbI2Br film, which significantly reduced the I− ion-migration and induced instant photo response of the device. As a result, the device under investigation passivated with 0.5% SmI2 delivered a higher average PCE of 13.00 ± 0.83% (a JSC of 16.29 ± 0.67 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.10 ± 0.01 V and a FF of 0.725 ± 0.300) with improved light illumination stability.53


3.1.6 Inorganic-based dopant. 
On the other hand, Yuan et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of inorganic polysulphides, such as cyclic S8, in the CsPbI2Br precursor retarded the crystallization of the α-CsPbI2Br via a self-formed Pb(S8)x2+ intermediate, which led to a larger perovskite grain size and efficient boundary passivation with reduced trap state density. Benefitting from the improved CsPbI2Br film morphology, charge recombination was effectively suppressed both at the perovskite film surface and in the bulk film. Furthermore, the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film was also improved, attributed to the increased hydrophobic film surface. Finally, a PCE of 14.46% (a JSC of 15.91 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V and a FF of 0.784) along with outstanding device stability under ambient and thermal conditions was achieved for the inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs with 0.2 mg mL−1 S8.54 Later, 2D nanoflakes (Nano-In2S3) with a thickness down to a few unit cells were synthesized via a simple ball-billing method and were used as a dopant in the CsPbI2Br film. Benefitting from the remarkable interaction between the unsaturated In–S dangling bonds of Nano-In2S3 and Pb2+ of CsPbI2Br, uniform, large and highly orientated crystalline CsPbI2Br grains were induced, which effectively passivated the defects of the CsPbI2Br film and minimized the leakage current of the device. Meanwhile, the gradient doping and accumulation of Nano-In2S3 near the bottom film increased the built-in electric field across the CsPbI2Br film, resulting in more efficient carrier separation/transport with reduced charge recombination. A PCE of 15.17% (a JSC of 16.38 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.20 V and a FF of 0.772) along with higher ambient and thermal stabilities was achieved for the device under investigation with 0.2 mg mL−1 of Nano-In2S3 acetone solution.55 The incorporation of carbon nanodots (CNDs) in the CsPbI2Br precursor not only induced highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with a reduced roughness surface, but also formed a cascade energy level alignment. Benefitting from these, the interfacial contact between CsPbI2Br and HTL was optimized, which reduced the interface defects and promoted charge carrier transport with a reduction of charge recombination loss. Furthermore, the incorporation of CNDs also improved the moisture resistance of the perovskite film. Accordingly, the CsPbI2Br PSCs with 1.0 wt% CND achieved a PCE of 14.69% (a JSC of 16.41 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.17 V and a FF of 0.760) along with higher ambient and phase stability.56 Other reports showed that CdSe quantum dots with a water-soluble bifunctional molecule mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) ligand, denoted as MPA-CdSe QDs, in the CsPbI2Br precursor not only induced the seedlike crystal to promote the nucleation process in the initial stage, but also decelerated the perovskite crystal growth process in the final step of the annealing process arising from the MPA ligand. Thus, a highly crystalline CsPbI2Br dense film with larger grain size and reduction of defect states, as well as higher α-phase stability, was constructed under ambient conditions. Benefitting from these, a higher PCE of 14.49% (a JSC of 14.47 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.25 V and a FF of 0.801) was achieved for the optimized C-CsPbI2Br PSCs with 0.06 mg mL−1 MPA-CdSe QDs.57 Wang et al. demonstrated that incorporation of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets dopants in the CsPbI2Br precursor not only increased the crystallinity of the perovskite with reduced defect density, but also formed a Schottky junction between the CsPbI2Br and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. As a result, an enhanced separation/transport of the free charge carrier with reduced charge recombination was achieved for the optimal film with the addition of 0.5 wt% Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. Accordingly, the corresponding device achieved the best PCE of 15.10% (a JSC of 15.92 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.22 V and a FF of 0.780).58

3.2. Optimization of the electron transporting layer (ETL)
An ETL is used to extract and transport free electrons to the cathode, as well as to serve as a hole-blocking layer to inhibit free electrons from recombining with free holes. Therefore, ETL is one of the important layers for CsPbI2Br PSCs. To enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of CsPbI2Br PSCs, researchers not only designed new types of ETLs, but also incorporated dopants in the electron transporting material precursor to serve as the ETL for application in CsPbI2Br PSCs, regardless of the regular or inverted structure. The photovoltaic properties and stability evolutions of CsPbI2Br PSCs after optimization are listed in Table 2.

3.2.1 Designing new functional layers. 
The optimization of the deposition temperature for the atomic layer deposited indium oxide (In2O3) ETL was proposed to enhance the photovoltaic parameter of CsPbI2Br PSCs. At temperature >200 °C, the In2O3 film with a polycrystalline cubic structure achieved higher conductivity, low resistivity and higher carrier concentration, which is in favour of facilitating electron transport and minimizing charge recombination at the In2O3/CsPbI2Br interface. A PCE of 10.97% (a JSC of 13.64 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.13 V and a FF of 0.710) was achieved for the device under investigation derived from the In2O3 ETL deposited at 250 °C.59 To replace the commonly used ETL (i.e. [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM and the derivatives of C60) in the inverted p–i–n CsPbI2Br PSC structure, a low-temperature solution-processed metal sulphide ETL was developed by a simple ligand exchange process in the anhydrous ether solution containing 1, 2-ethanedithiol (EDT). It was found that the as-synthesized cadmium sulphide (CdS) ETL not only exhibited excellent film morphology (dense, uniform and pinhole-free) with favourable conductivity (5.4 × 10−4 S cm−1), but also formed suitable energy level alignment between the CBM of CsPbI2Br with CdS. Benefitting from these, electrons were extracted to CdS more efficiently with minimized charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/CdS interface. As a result, a PCE of 15.04% (a JSC of 15.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.12 V and a FF of 0.790) was attained for the device under investigation. Meanwhile, the device under investigation also exhibited outstanding stability under continuous one sun illumination, attributed to the fact that the CdS could act as a barrier layer to block ion migration originating from the top metal electrode to CsPbI2Br and the vice versa.60


3.2.2 Dopant engineering. 
To improve the electron transporting properties of the SnO2 ETL, potassium fluoride (KF) was introduced into the SnO2 solution. The addition of KF changed the SnO2 solution to white bluish colour from transparent, indicating the formation of larger SnO2 particles. Furthermore, the electron mobility of SnO2 was enhanced (i.e., 0.66 versus 1.60 × 106 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the energy offset between the CBM of SnO2 and CsPbI2Br was reduced, which improved electron extraction with reduced charge recombination at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface. In addition, the migration of F− of KF to the bottom of the CsPbI2Br film could passivate the interface between SnO2 and CsPbI2Br, yielding high-quality CsPbI2Br films with lower trap state density (i.e., 7.17 versus 9.46 × 1015 cm−3). Thus, a PCE of 15.39% (a JSC of 14.79 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.31 V and a FF of 0.792) was obtained for the device under investigation with 6 mg mL−1 KF, as well as demonstrated higher ambient stability.25 By contrast, no colour change was observed after the introduction of tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) in SnO2 solution. Interestingly, TMACl effectively suppressed the oxygen vacancies on the surface and in the bulk of SnO2, reduced the energy offset between the CBM of SnO2 and CsPbI2Br and enhanced the electrical conductivity of the SnO2. Benefitting from these, the device with 3 mol% TMACl showed efficient electron transfer with low charge recombination at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface, delivering a PCE of 13.84% (a JSC of 15.29 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V and a FF of 0.775) along with higher ambient and thermal stabilities. After storing under ambient air conditions for 5 days, the CsPbI2Br film of the device under investigation remained dark brown, whereas the CsPbI2Br film of the control device changed to yellow (Fig. 3a), which pointed to TMACl increasing the hydrophobicity of the SnO2 film surface.61 As shown in Fig. 3b, oxyacid anions in the SnO2 film enhanced the VOC value of CsPbI2Br PSCs. Among these sodium salts with different oxyacid anions (i.e., NO3−, SO42−, CO32−, PO43− and SiO32−), silicate (SiO32−) with a less electronegative central atom gave the strongest chemical bonding between the oxysalt and CsPbI2Br (i.e. O–Pb bond, Fig. 3c), which led to better surface passivation and reduced interface defects. Additionally, the energy band alignment between the CBM of SnO2 and CsPbI2Br was improved. As a result, electron extraction was improved and nonradiative recombination at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface was inhibited effectively by the SiO32− dopant. Eventually, a PCE of 17.26% (a JSC of 15.86 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.36 V and a FF of 0.800) was obtained for the device under investigation with the 0.05 M SiO32− dopant, as well as achieving superior device stability.62 Meanwhile, caesium acetate (CsAc) and lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2) dopants have also been reported to enhance the VOC of the CsPbI2Br PSCs, attributed to CsAc and Pb(Ac)2 in ZnO films minimizing the interfacial energy barrier between the ZnO and CsPbI2Br, thus leading to enhanced ZnO conductivity and improved CsPbI2Br film quality (i.e. high crystallinity, more uniform morphology, fewer grain boundaries and no pinholes). Thus, electrons were extracted from CsPbI2Br to ZnO more readily with low carrier accumulation or charge recombination at the ZnO/CsPbI2Br interface, yielding a higher PCE of 16.36% (a JSC of 15.78 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.809) and 14.96% (a JSC of 15.54 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.23 V and a FF of 0.785) for Pb(Ac)2 and CsAc-treated devices, respectively. However, CsAc and Pb(Ac)2 dopants have no significant effect on improving the device lifetime.63 With the addition of 5% 3-triphenylphosphaniumylpropane-1-sulfonate (TPPPS) in the ZnO precursor solution, the defects in the ZnO film were suppressed, electron mobility was improved and the energy barrier between the CBM of CsPbI2Br and ZnO was minimized. As a result, electron extraction from CsPbI2Br to ZnO was improved with reduced charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/ZnO interface. Benefitting from these, the device under investigation with 5% TPPPS delivered the best PCE of 14.62% (a JSC of 15.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.23 V and a FF of 0.768) with outstanding device stability. The long-term stability of the device under investigation was attributed to the formation of uniform and dense ZnO films with higher hydrophobic surface after modification for protecting the CsPbI2Br film from α to δ-phase transition and preventing the penetration of moisture into the CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 3d).64 Later, Sn2+ was doped into the TiO2 film (i.e. Ti1−xSnxO2) by adding SnCl4 in TiCl4 solution for the inverted CsPbI2Br PSC application. With SnCl4 dopant, the electrical conductivity and the Ti1−xSnxO2 film morphology were optimized, and suitable energy level alignment was induced at the CsPbI2Br/ETL interface. Meanwhile, the Cl− could occupy the oxygen vacancies in metal oxides and passivate the I− defects of the underneath layer of the CsPbI2Br film. As a result, a PCE of 14.00% (a JSC of 15.90 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.15 V and a FF of 0.766) was achieved for the device with the Ti0.9Sn0.1O2 ETL. Moreover, the device under investigation also delivered higher light and thermal stability.65

3.3. Optimization of the hole transporting layer (HTL)
The commonly used spiro-OMeTAD and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) require hygroscopic dopants or additives, such as lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) to improve the hole transporting properties. However, these dopants or additives could accelerate the perovskite film degradation process, resulting in poor device performance and poor stability.66 To overcome these problems, researchers not only designed various types of organic molecules and organic polymers, but also incorporated dopants in the hole transporting material precursor to serve as the HTL for application in CsPbI2Br PSCs, regardless of the regular or inverted structure. The photovoltaic properties and stability evolutions of CsPbI2Br PSCs after optimization are listed in Table 3.

3.3.1 Designing new functional layers: organic molecule HTL. 
Owing to the excellent hole transporting properties of the donor–π–donor (D–π–D) materials in the organic photovoltaic community, the novel D–π–D-based HTLs were synthesized and adapted to replace the spiro-OMeTAD HTL. As the π-bridge of the donor–π–donor (D–π–D) HTL varied from biphenyl (SY1) to phenanthrene (SY2) and then to pyrene (SY3), the hole transporting properties were increased in the order of SY3 (2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > SY2 (1.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > SY1 (1.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), attributed to more extended π-conjugation of the central scaffold. Fig. 4a shows the molecular structure of SY1, SY2 and SY3 HTLs for application in CsPbI2Br PSCs. Compared to SY1 and SY2, SY3 exhibited the deepest VBM of −5.25 eV (versus −5.23 eV for SY1 and −5.22 eV for SY2) and uniform film surface, which enhanced hole extraction from CsPbI2Br to anode. As a result, a PCE of 13.41% (a JSC of 14.93 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.19 V and a FF of 0.755) was obtained for the SY3 device, which was comparable to the PCE of 13.65% of the spiro-OMeTAD device (a JSC of 15.01 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.19 V and a FF of 0.764). Furthermore, the increased hydrophobicity of the SY3 film surface compared with that of the SY1, SY2 and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs could enable it to act as a moisture barrier and improve the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film.32 Later, the ladder-type heteroacene core of the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type dopant free HTLs, namely L2 and L2-T (Fig. 4b) were synthesized for application in CsPbI2Br PSCs. By applying L2 and L2-T as the HTL, a higher hole mobility (1.51, 1.05 and 0.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for L2, L2-T and dopant free spiro-OMeTAD, respectively) and a lower film roughness of the CsPbI2Br surface (2.5, 3.9 and 4.2 nm for L2, L2-T and dopant free spiro-OMeTADs) were obtained. Benefitting from these, L2 and L2-T not only enhanced the hole transport and minimized the carrier recombination, but also formed a good ohmic contact between the CsPbI2Br film and anode, thereby reducing the undesirable current leakage in the resulting CsPbI2Br PSCs. PCEs of 12.41% (a JSC of 13.73 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.21 V and a FF of 0.750) and 11.07% (a JSC of 13.56 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V and a FF of 0.706) were attained for L2 and L2-T devices, respectively, whereas the dopant free spiro-OMeTAD device exhibited a PCE of 9.95% (a JSC of 13.77 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V and a FF of 0.625). The highest performance for the L2 device is attributed to L2 exhibiting a deeper lying VBM of 4.95 eV, which minimized the voltage loss during the hole transfer from CsPbI2Br to the HTL. Furthermore, the improved surface hydrophobicity of L2 and L2-T (92.2, 92.5 and 76.5° for L2, L2-T and dopant free spiro-OMeTADs) could prevent air moisture from ingression into the CsPbI2Br film, resulting in higher ambient air stability of the devices in the order of L2-T > L2 when compared with the dopant free spiro-OMeTAD device.33 Later, YT-2 (4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine as peripheral donor groups) and fluorene terminal-modified HTLs, namely YTMPF and YT-FF, (Fig. 4c), were synthesized and utilized as HTLs. Owing to the polarized structure of YT-MPF (Fig. 4d), the intermolecular interaction and hole hopping transport are promoted, yielding higher mobility (1.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and higher conductivity (5.44 × 10−4 S cm−1) compared with those of YT-2 and YT-FF HTLs. Furthermore, a smooth and low roughness film of YT-MPF (versus YT-2 and YT-FF) on the CsPbI2Br film surface improved the contact at the perovskite/anode interface. Thus, the direct contact between CsPbI2Br and anode and the suppression of charge recombination could be expected for the device with YT-MPF. Benefitting from these, the device based on YT-MPF achieved a superior PCE of 16.00% (a JSC of 15.48 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.29 V and a FF of 0.796), which was higher than that of the device derived from YT-2, with a PCE of 13.30% (a JSC of 15.06 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V and a FF of 0.701), YT-FF, with a PCE of 14.20% (a JSC of 14.87 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.30 V and a FF of 0.735) and the device with the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, with a PCE of 14.70% (a JSC of 15.03 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.27 V and a FF of 0.765), mainly ascribed to the efficient hole extraction of the YT-MPF HTL. Furthermore, the device based on YT-MPF also exhibited excellent ambient air stability compared with the YT-2, YT-FF and spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, owing to its higher hydrophobic surface protecting the CsPbI2Br film from the intrusion of air-moisture.67

3.3.2 Designing new functional layer: organic polymer HTL. 
Predominant ‘face-on’ orientation and well-matched energy band alignment between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and HTL were achieved by replacing P3HT with poly[(4,4'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]siloletieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)-random-(4,4'-di-n-octyldithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]siloletieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)], PDTDT. Even though PDTDT exhibited a bit less efficiency for hole extraction, it passivated the shallow defect of the perovskite surface more remarkably, which reduced the trap-assisted recombination at the CsPbI2Br/PDTDT interface. As a result, the device with PDTDT achieved higher VOC and FF, with a PCE of 17.36% (a JSC of 15.02 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.42 V and a FF of 0.813). Meanwhile, the device with the PDTDT HTL also exhibited higher thermal stability after annealing at 85 °C (10–20% RH) for 80 hours, which along with PDTDT could stabilize the phase transition of CsPbI2Br by minimizing the tensile strain in the CsPbI2Br film induced by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the CsPbI2Br and HTL.68 Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the fluorine-substituted poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophe-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) derivative, PM6 (i) provided more favourable band alignment with CsPbI2Br and thus the voltage loss is minimized during the hole transfer process, (ii) formed a good interface contact between CsPbI2Br and the anode and thus the shunt loss is suppressed in the device and (iii) passivated the surface defect of the CsPbI2Br film through the interaction between sulfur and fluorine atoms in PM6 with the PbI64− perovskite framework. Benefitting from these, the device with dopant-free PM6 achieved a higher PCE of 16.06% (a JSC of 15.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.24 V and a FF of 0.825) with excellent stability, attributed to the improved hole extraction rate and increased hydrophobic film surface of CsPbI2Br blocking the moisture ingression into the perovskite film.69 Dopant free HTL of poly[(9-alkyl-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)-co-(2,4-dimethylaniline-N,Ndiyl)] (PCDA1) was prepared by incorporating a strongly electron donating carbazole moiety instead of a spirobifluorene moiety and then copolymerized it with 2,4-dimethylaniline. The as-synthesized PCDA1 not only reduced the pinhole formation in the HTL film and improved the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film, but also optimized the energy band alignment. As a result, hole transfer and charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/PCDA1 interface were suppressed. Benefitting from these, a PCE of 11.01% (a JSC of 14.55 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.07 V and a FF of 0.690) was obtained for the device with 8 mg mL−1 PCDA1. Moreover, the device under investigation also demonstrated excellent stability in ambient and N2 atmospheres.70 Later, the Ni-based polymer HTL of bis(4-dimethylaminodithiobenzil) nickel (II) (BDMA) (Fig. 4e) was developed. With BDMA, the energy barrier at the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface was minimized, which improves the hole transport with less interfacial recombination. A PCE of 12.32% (a JSC of 15.44 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.12 V and a FF of 0.715) along with outstanding device stability was achieved.71 Owing to poly [(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro- 2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10) exhibiting better energy level matching, excellent electrical properties and better surface passivation induced by the functional groups (N and F atoms) (versus solely of S atom for P3HT) were achieved for PTQ10 when compared with P3HT. A PCE of 17.80% (a JSC of 15.24 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.40 V and a FF of 0.832) along with excellent environmental stability (i.e. N2 atmosphere and ambient air) was obtained for the device with PTQ10 when compared with that of the device with P3HT.72


3.3.3 Dopant engineering. 
Polyvinylcarbazole (PVK) in the PTAA precursor reduced the energy offset between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and PTAA, thereby increasing the hole extraction efficiency and suppressing the charge recombination in the CsPbI2Br bulk film and at the CsPbI2Br/PTAA interface. Eventually, these effects gave higher VOC and FF values for the 7.5%-doped PVK device, with the best PCE of 13.60% (a JSC of 14.50 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.19 V and a FF of 0.790).73 Meanwhile, the addition of donor-type small molecules of SMe-TATPyr (Fig. 4f) in P3HT solution modulated the P3HT molecules (i.e. stacking from the ‘edge-on’ to face-on’ manner, Fig. 4g) and improved the hole transfer ability in vertical structured solar cells. Additionally, SMe-TATPyr also reduced the energy barrier between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and P3HT and suppressed the defect density at the CsPbI2Br/P3HT interface. Benefitting from these, the hole extraction efficiency to P3HT from CsPbI2Br was greatly enhanced and charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/P3HT interface was significantly suppressed. As a result, it delivered a PCE of 16.93% (a JSC of 15.07 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.38 V and a FF of 0.808) with improved VOC and FF when compared with the neat P3HT device. Without encapsulation, the device with SMe-TATPyr also demonstrated superior stability against moisture and heat.74

3.4. Optimization of the interfacial Layer
In addition to optimizing the CsPbI2Br film, ETL and HTL, interface engineering is one of the effective techniques to minimize nonradiative charge recombination of the device without destroying the properties of the underneath or the top buffer layer. Furthermore, interface engineering not only can modulate the perovskite crystal growth, but also alter the energy level alignment and decelerate the degradation process of the devices. The photovoltaic properties and stability evolutions of the CsPbI2Br PSCs after modification, regardless of the regular structure (i.e. ETL/CsPbI2Br, CsPbI2Br/HTL, HTL/Anode and ETL/CsPbI2Br/HTL interfaces), inverted structure (i.e. HTL/CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br/ETL interfaces) and C-CsPbI2Br PSCs (i.e. CsPbI2Br/Carbon and ETL/CsPbI2Br/Carbon interfaces) are listed in Table 4.

3.4.1 ETL/CsPbI2Br interface engineering. 
Ionic liquid of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF6) was introduced at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface for C-CsPbI2Br PSCs. With the addition of BMIMPF6, it not only reduced the energy offset between the CBM of TiO2 and CsPbI2Br, but also induced larger perovskite grains with fewer grain boundary defects. As a result, BMIMPF6 led to faster electron extraction from CsPbI2Br to TiO2 and suppressed the defect-induced charge trapping and charge recombination of the device. A PCE of 13.19% (a JSC of 14.33 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.22 V, and a FF of 0.753) along with outstanding ambient and light illumination stability was achieved for the device under investigation with 10 mg mL−1 BMIMPF6 in the ethanol solvent.75 On the other hand, Wang et al. achieved a higher PCE of 14.46% (a JSC of 14.21 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V, and a FF of 0.794) after introducing an equimolar of TiCl4–TiCl3 at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface, attributed to the TiCl4–TiCl3 interface layer facilitating perovskite crystallization and inducing the formation of highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains. Furthermore, the oxidation–driven nature of Ti(III) hydrolysis resulted in surface Cl doping of TiO2, which improved the electron extraction and minimized the charge recombination at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface.76 On the other hand, methylammonium chloride (MACl) at the ZnO/CsPbI2Br interface passivated the interface defects, facilitated the charge transport and minimized the charge recombination at the ZnO/CsPbI2Br interface, yielding a higher PCE of 14.79% (a JSC of 15.15 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.22 V, and a FF of 0.800) and long-term stability in an N2 atmosphere.77 Compared with the compact TiO2 film ETL, it was found that TiO2 nanopillar arrays (NaPAs) could not only enhance the interfacial contact between CsPbI2Br and TiO2, but also provide a direct pathway for electron injection/extraction to the bottom electrode (Fig. 5a). Benefitting from these, TiO2 NaPAs CsPbI2Br PSCs exhibited a higher PCE of 11.35% (a JSC of 15.18 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.10 V, and a FF of 0.688) and superior long term stability compared to that of the TiO2 planar CsPbI2Br PSCs.78 Meanwhile, quantum dots have also been utilized to modify the ETL/CsPbI2Br interface for CsPbI2Br PSC application.79,80 It was found that borophene quantum dot (BQD) interfacial layer not only improved the contact between TiO2 and CsPbI2Br to reduce interfacial recombination, but also induced a well-matched energy alignment for effective charge transport. The device with 0.01 mg mL−1 BQD treatment achieved a higher PCE of 15.31% (a JSC of 15.18 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V, and a FF of 0.785) along with superior ambient stability, attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination and the decrease in defect density at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface (i.e. 0.647 versus 1.17 × 1016 cm−3).79 On the other hand, Liu et al. showed that cerium-doped CsPbI3 quantum dots (Ce10%:CsPbI3 QDs) on a TiO2 film surface could serve as nucleation sites to induce the formation of a high quality CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 5b). It was found that Ce10%:CsPbI3 could decompose and enter the parent lattice of CsPbI2Br to passivate both Cs+ and halide ion vacancy defects during the spin-coating process. After thermal treatment, highly crystalline and denser CsPbI2Br films were obtained. Due to the improved interface contact and suppressed CsPbI2Br bulk films and TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface defects, electron extraction from CsPbI2Br to TiO2 was facilitated with reduced nonradiative charge recombination, yielding a higher average PCE of 12.14% and better operational stability in an N2 atmosphere.80

3.4.2 CsPbI2Br/HTL interface engineering. 
The interfacial layer of ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4·H2O) on the CsPbI2Br film surface could decompose into NH3 and H2C2O4 to induce the secondary perovskite grain growth during the thermal annealing process (Fig. 5c), which enlarged the perovskite grains to micrometer-scale and improved the carrier dynamics of the device. Benefitting from these, an efficient charge transfer with reduced energy loss (i.e. from 0.80 to 0.64 eV) was obtained for the 2 mg mL−1 ((NH4)2C2O4·H2O) modified device, with a PCE of 16.55% (a JSC of 16.48 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.24 V, and a FF of 0.810). More importantly, the organic layer of H2C2O4 served as a barrier to inhibit the moisture invasion and hinder the ion migration, thereby improving the device stability.26 On the other hand, multicarbazolyl-substituted benzonitrile of 4t-5CzBn at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface (i) reduced the roughness of the CsPbI2Br film surface, which improved the physical contact between CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD, (ii) suppressed the bulk and interface defect density due to the coordination between the cyano group of 4t-5CzBn and Pb2+ in PbI2 and (iii) minimized the energy offset between the VBM of CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, 4t-5CzBn promoted hole transport with reduction of charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface, yielding the best PCE of 17.34% (a JSC of 15.78 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.34 V, and a FF of 0.823) along with higher ambient/thermal stability for the device under investigation. The improved ambient/thermal stability of the devices was linked to the increased hydrophobicity of the film surface and high decomposition temperature of 4t-5CzBn decelerating the degradation process of CsPbI2Br PSCs.81 Incorporation of p-type blue carbon dots (B-CDs) prepared by the solvothermal approach (Fig. 5d) at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface (i) increased the hydrophobicity of the CsPbI2Br film surface and hence improved the moisture resistance of the perovskite film, (ii) induced an internal electric field to promote charge extraction/separation. Furthermore, the VBM of B-CDs (−5.54 eV) lying between the CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD formed a cascade energy level alignment and led to efficient hole extraction and suppressed charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface and (iii) passivated the bulk and surface defects of the CsPbI2Br film, yielding a lower defect density for B-CD modified films (i.e. 0.726 versus 1.21 × 1016 cm−3). Benefitting from these, a PCE of 16.76% (a JSC of 16.01 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.31 V and a FF of 0.800) along with long-term device stability was obtained for the device under investigation with 1 mg mL−1 B-CDs.82 Meanwhile, the addition of π-conjugated molecules of bis(2-ethylhexyl) 3,30((4,8-bis (5-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4-difluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-di yl)bis(3,300-dioctyl[2,20: 50,200-terthiophene]-500,5-diyl))(2E,20E)-bis(2-cyanoacrylate) (BTEC-2F)19 or poly[[5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-benzotriazole-4,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl[4,8-bis[5-(tripropylsilyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl] (J71)83 at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface induced the formation of larger perovskite grains along with improved moisture resistance films, attributed to that BTEC-2F and J71 could assist the secondary growth of the perovskite crystal and increased hydrophobicity of the film surface. More importantly, the interaction between BTEC-2F (S and O atoms) or J71 (S and N atoms) with Pb dangling bonds in CsPbI2Br alleviated the microstrain between the inorganic perovskite grains, resulting in a well-preserved lattice and lower defect density of the CsPbI2Br film. With BTEC-2F and J71 modification, the energy level alignment between the CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD was optimized. The energy loss was suppressed and the hole extraction at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface was facilitated. After modification, a PCE of 16.25% (a JSC of 16.13 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.29 V and a FF of 0.784) and a PCE of 15.80% (a JSC of 15.96 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.773) with higher operational stability were achieved for the device under investigation with 0.5 mg mL−1 BTEC-2F/and1 mg mL−1 J71, respectively.19,83 It was found that guanidinium bromine (GABr) treatment on the CsPbI2Br film formed a Br-rich region of CsPbI(2−x)Br(1+x) (0 < x < 0.5) near to the perovskite surface, which lowered the Fermi energy level and improved the energy level alignment between CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, a PCE of 16.97% (a JSC of 15.90 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.31 V and a FF of 0.815) was attained for the device under investigation with 2.0 mg mL−1 GABr. Furthermore, the corresponding device also exhibited outstanding thermal and ambient stability, which is linked to the increased hydrophobicity and enhanced quality of CsPbI2Br films.84 On treatment with a small amount of 2-thiopheneacetic acid (2-TPAA) in IPA solution on the CsPbI2Br film surface, uniform, dense, and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films with highly crystalline morphologies were obtained through the secondary growth process. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of the organic molecules not only formed a capping layer to block the air-moisture from interacting with the CsPbI2Br film, but also suppressed the defects at the surface and grain boundaries of the CsPbI2Br perovskite via coordination between the carboxyl and thiophene groups of 2-TPAA and Pb2+ in CsPbI2Br. Benefitting from these, excellent electrical properties and higher phase transition resistance of the CsPbI2Br film were obtained, which was beneficial for hole extraction with reduced charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface. After optimization, the device with 70 mg mL−1 2-TPAA exhibited a higher PCE of 15.03% (a JSC of 15.67 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.21 V and a FF of 0.800) and higher stability in a N2 atmosphere.85 Later, surface engineering of the perovskite film was carried out by exposing the CsPbI2Br film to ambient air after spin-coating with Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (NCs). It was found that the decomposition products of Cs4PbBr6 NCs, such as CsBr (or CsI1−yBry) and Br-enriched perovskites (CsPbBr3 and CsPbI2−xBr1+x) after exposing to ambient air and the subsequent halide anion exchange during annealing (i) induced the formation of high quality CsPbI2Br films with a reduction in trap state density, (ii) increased the energy Fermi level of CsPbI2Br and formed better energy level alignment between CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD, thereby strengthening the built-in electric field to separate and extract the charge carrier at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface with reduced charge recombination and (iii) improved the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film. As a result, higher α-phase CsPbI2Br stability films with efficient charge transfer and reduction of trap state density were obtained after modification with Cs4PbBr6 NCs. A higher PCE of 15.52% (a JSC of 15.22 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.30 V and a FF of 0.782) and outstanding stability in ambient air (∼40% RH) for 500 hours was obtained for the device under investigation.86 On the other hand, the passivation layer of (PEABr + CsBr) on the CsPbI2Br film not only shifted the Fermi energy level closer to the VBM and improved the energy level alignment, but also filled the vacancy defects of the CsPbI2Br film. As a result, the charge extraction/separation was facilitated and charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface (a longer charge recombination time of 129.1 versus 78.6 μs) was suppressed. The passivated device showed a PCE of 16.70% (a JSC of 15.64 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.30 V and a FF of 0.820) along with outstanding light, thermal and ambient stability.87 With n-butylammonium bromide (BABr) treatment, the simple cation exchange reaction between BABr
and CsPbI2Br induced the formation of LD quasi-2D perovskite BA2CsPb2I2Br5 on the 3D CsPbI2Br film surface, forming the 2D/3D heterostructure. The formation of the LD perovskite structure not only increased the moisture resistance and passivated the film defects due to improved film morphology, but also induced more compatible energy level alignment for hole extraction with reduced charge accumulation at the interface. Thus, a higher PCE of 16.57% (a JSC of 15.92 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.814) with outstanding stability under thermal and ambient stress was obtained for the device with 0.5 mg mL−1 GABr treatment.88 Meanwhile, ionic liquids of 1-viny-3-propionate ethyl imidazolium chloride ([PEVIM]Cl),89 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMMIMBF4)90 and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM]PF6)91 have also been utilized as passivation layers at the CsPbI2Br/HTL interface to boost the performance and stability of CsPbI2Br PSCs. The interaction between [PEVIM]Cl with the undercoordinated Pb and Cs metal cations of CsPbI2Br induced the formation of highly crystalline and dense CsPbI2Br films with reduction in defect density. Additionally, the energy barrier between CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD was reduced and the built-in voltage of the device was improved, which facilitated the driving force for charge transfer with reduction of charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Benefitting from these, the passivated device with 0.6 mg mL−1 [PEVIM]Cl achieved the best PCE of 14.19% (a JSC of 15.70 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V and a FF of 0.779) and outstanding operational stability.89 On the other hand, BMMIMBF4 treatment (i) had no effect on the CsPbI2Br film morphology but improved the moisture resistance of the resultant film, (ii) formed ionic bonds with uncoordinated Cs+ and Pb2+ cations on the surface and at the grain boundaries of the CsPbI2Br film, which effectively healed/reduced the Cs+/I− vacancies and Pb-related defects, (iii) minimized the energy offset for effective charge extraction/transfer at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Thus, a higher PCE of 17.02% (a JSC of 15.96 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.33 V and a FF of 0.801) with superior stability was obtained for the device under investigation with 0.03 wt% BMMIMBF4.90 Later, [BMIM]PF6 was introduced at the CsPbI2Br/P3HT interface to dissolve and etch the defective CsPbI2Br perovskite surfaces and substantially remove the flawed layer near the perovskite surface via Coulombic interaction. With this passivation strategy, highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with excellent morphology were obtained and Pb-related defects on the CsPbI2Br film surface were passivated, which promoted the charge transfer and minimized the charge recombination. Furthermore, [BMIM]PF6 also suppressed the light-induced ion migration across the entire film. Benefitting from these, the best performing device with 0.3 mmol/mL [BMIM]PF6 achieved a high PCE of 17.51% (a JSC of 16.06 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.37 V and a FF of 0.800) with excellent ambient and thermal stabilities.91


3.4.3 HTL/anode interface engineering. 
It was found that incorporation of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (CBA) at the spiro-OMeTAD/anode interface not only improved the moisture resistance of the perovskite film, but also protected the Ag electrode from transforming to AgI, which was achieved by hindering the I− ions in CsPbI2Br to react with the Ag anode through the tiny holes of the degraded spiro-OMeTAD film (Fig. 5e). Meanwhile, CBA also increased the work function of the Ag electrode from 4.26 eV to 5.1 eV, which was beneficial for facilitating the hole extraction to Ag more efficiently and minimizing the charge recombination at the Ag anode. As a result, a higher PCE of 14.32% (a JSC of 15.17 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.21 V and a FF of 0.780) along with outstanding stability (Fig. 5f) in ambient air was achieved for the device with 4 mg mL−1 CBA.92


3.4.4 HTL/CsPbI2Br interface engineering. 
Han et al. demonstrated that copper phthalocyanine 3,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetrasulfonated acid tetrasodium salt (TS-CuPc) on spiro-the OMeTAD HTL film surface (i) induced the formation of highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains, (ii) minimized the interface defect between the spiro-OMeTAD and CsPbI2Br, (iii) improved the phase stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite and (iv) reduced the tensile strain at the spiro-OMeTAD/CsPbI2Br interface. Benefitting from these, the hole defect density was suppressed (i.e. 4.84 versus 6.95 × 1015 cm−3) and efficient hole extraction was facilitated for inverted structure CsPbI2Br PSCs with bilayer spiro-OMeTAD/6 mg mL−1 TS-CuPc HTLs. A PCE of 14.85% (a JSC of 15.53 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.19 V and a FF of 0.807) along with long-term environmental stability (i.e. ambient air and N2 atmosphere) was achieved for the device under investigation.27


3.4.5 CsPbI2Br/ETL interface engineering. 
1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface increased the hydrophobicity of CsPbI2Br films, thereby improving the moisture resistance of the perovskite film. With BMIMBF4, the conductivity and morphology of the CsPbI2Br film were improved, which led to better electron transfer/extraction and suppression of charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface. As a result, the inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs with 2 mg mL−1 BMIMBF4 achieved a PCE of 13.21% (a JSC of 17.11 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.07 V and a FF of 0.722) along with outstanding environmental stability (i.e. N2 atmosphere and ambient air) compared to that of the control device.93 On the other hand, Li et al. demonstrated that surface treatment of the CsPbI2Br film with benzimidazolium iodine (BIZI) induced the formation of 2D (BIZ)2PbI3Br, which (i) passivated defects at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface, (ii) promoted hole extraction from 3D CsPbI2Br across the 2D phase, (iii) improved moisture resistance and (iv) minimized the leakage current of the device. Benefitting from these, a PCE of 13.93% (a JSC of 15.48 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.15 V and a FF of 0.780) was obtained for the device under investigation with 1 mg mL−1 BIZI.94 Owing to the same solvent (i.e. ethanol) for dissolving ZnO and the passivation layer of bipyrimidine hydroiodide (BP-HI), it was found that BP-HI could (i) diffuse into the CsPbI2Br film and top ZnO layer to passivate the film defects, (ii) enhanced the built-in electric field across the CsPbI2Br film and (iii) improved the electric contact at the CsPbI2Br/ZnO interface. Benefitting from these, the CsPbI2Br/BP-HI/ZnO films exhibited lower defect density, reduced charge accumulation and better electron charge extraction at the CsPbI2Br/ZnO/C60 interface. A PCE of 15.36% (a JSC of 16.31 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.21 V and a FF of 0.782) was achieved for the device under investigation with the BP-HI interface layer, as well as superior long-term stability was achieved. The long-term device stability was attributed to that BP-HI increased the hydrophobicity film surface, released tensile strain of CsPbI2Br films and inhibited I− ion migration along the perovskite grain boundaries from interacting with the Ag electrode.28


3.4.6 CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface engineering. 
Different types of passivation layers have also been introduced at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface to reduce the energy level mismatch and improve the physical contact between CsPbI2Br and the carbon electrode. In this subsection, we solely focus on the optimized C-CsPbI2Br PSCs with more than 13% PCE. The incorporation of N-phenylthiourea (PTU)[114] and BMIMBF495 at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface induced the formation of highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with reduction of defect state density and optimized the energy level alignment. As a result, hole transport was facilitated and the charge recombination was suppressed at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface more effectively. With PTU and BMIMBF4, the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film was improved. Benefitting from these, C-CsPbI2Br PSCs with PTU and BMIMBF4 achieved a PCE of 13.01% (a JSC of 14.83 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.22 V and a FF of 0.720) and a PCE of 14.03% (a JSC of 14.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.27 V and a FF of 0.750) with outstanding thermal and environmental stability (i.e. N2 atmosphere and ambient air), compared with that of the control device without modification.95,96 On the other hand, delta-2:2-bis (1,3-dithiazole) (hereafter termed as the TM) at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface optimized the CsPbI2Br film morphology by filling into the perovskite grain boundaries, forming a smooth film surface. As a result, defect density of the CsPbI2Br film was suppressed, hence improving the charge transfer and suppressing the charge recombination of C-CsPbI2Br PSCs. A higher PCE of 13.78% (a JSC of 14.74 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V and a FF of 0.740) along with long-term stability was obtained for the device under investigation with TM.97 On the other hand, ammonium-based passivation layers of hexyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB),37 methylammonium bromide (MABr),98 phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI),99 and ethylammonium iodide (EAI) + PEAI100 have also been applied at the CsPbI2Br/carbon interface for C-CsPbI2Br PSC application. With 0.001 M HTAB solution treatment on CsPbI2Br films, a higher PCE of 14.30% (a JSC of 14.10 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V and a FF of 0.806) was obtained for the device under investigation. HTAB could minimize the energy level mismatch at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface and enhance the built-in electric field of the device, thus resulting in enhanced driving force for the charge separation/extraction and suppressed defect-induced charge recombination. Furthermore, the enhancement of the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film after modification led to higher ambient and thermal stabilities of the devices.37 By spin-coating MABr/methanol solution onto CsPbI2Br films, followed by thermal annealing, crystalline perovskite seeds were formed atop the CsPbI2Br films. It was found that the perovskite seeds not only served as nuclei to modulate perovskite crystal grain growth to induce the formation of highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with full surface coverage, larger grains and reduction of electronic defects, but also supplied extra Br− anions to generate a thin Br-rich layer atop the perovskite film to induce residual compressive strain along the films and thus markedly boosted the phase stability and humidity tolerance of CsPbI2Br. As a result, at an annealing temperature of 200 °C, the device achieved a PCE of 14.84% (a JSC of 16.62 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.21 V and a FF of 0.740) with excellent ambient air stability.98 On the other hand, Wu et al. reported that PEAI/IPA treatment could reconstruct the film morphology of CsPbI2Br with less defect state density. According to the authors, PEAI/IPA treatment on the CsPbI2Br film surface induced the formation of LD 2D PEA2PbI4 and quasi-2D PEA2PbI4·(CsPbI2+xBr1−x)n−1. During the perovskite film annealing process at 280 °C, the 2D perovskites were sublimated and only the dense 3D film was left behind. Finally, highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with low defect state density were obtained. The device under investigation with PEAI treatment obtained the best PCE of 13.38% (a JSC of 14.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.30 V and a FF of 0.710).99 Meanwhile, an equimolar of EAI:PEAI in IPA has also been used as the passivation layer. Due to the larger ionic radii of EA+ than Cs+, EA+ ions could replace the A-site Cs+ ions, resulting in lattice expansion and distortion and inducing the formation of δ-CsPbI2Br, thus forming the α-/δ-phase CsPbI2Br heterojunction perovskite. On the other hand, PEAI induced the formation of LD 2D perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, which was locally covered on the 3D perovskite and the α-/δ-phase CsPbI2Br heterojunction perovskite. With this synergistic modification, (i) surface defects of the modified perovskite film were passivated with reduction of trap density, (ii) the energy level arrangement between CsPbI2Br and the carbon electrode was improved, which promoted the hole extraction ability and reduced the charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/carbon interface and (iii) moisture resistance of the modified perovskite film was improved. Benefitting from these, a PCE of 13.76% (a JSC of 14.59 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.17 V and a FF of 0.803) with outstanding stability was obtained for the device under investigation.100 In addition to EAI and PEAI, fluorinated derivatives of 4-fluorophenylethylammonium halides (i.e. 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (P-F-PEAI) and 4- fluorophenylethylammonium bromide (P-F-PEABr) have also been used to modify the CsPbI2Br film surface for C-CsPbI2Br PSCs. Owing to the larger P-F-PEA+ compared with that of Cs+, P-F-PEA+ cations were terminated onto the CsPbI2Br film surface to passivate the pinhole/grain boundary defects and acted as air-moisture barrier to enhance the phase stability of CsPbI2Br instead of forming the 2D capping layer. By contrast, I−1/Br−1 anions were gradient-doped into the CsPbI2Br films during the annealing process, resulting in lattice distortion (i.e. lattice expansion for P-F-PEAI and lattice shrinkage for P-F-PEABr) and highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with reduced structural disorder and ionic defects. Furthermore, the incorporation of P-F-PEAI and P-F-PEABr also induced the formation of surface dipoles (i.e. Fermi energy level were upshifted to conduction band after modification for both passivation layers, thereby constructing a p–n junction between the CsPbI2Br and carbon electrode) and enhanced the built-in electric field of the passivated device, thereby improving hole extraction with reduced charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface. Accordingly, higher PCEs of 13.89% and 13.97% along with outstanding ambient and thermal stabilities were achieved for the device under investigation with P-F-PEAI and P-F-PEABr, respectively.101 On the other hand, a gradient energy level alignment at the CsPbI2Br/carbon interface was optimized when 100 nm thick with ∼20 nm average size of Cs2SnI6 nanocrystals in toluene solution was deposited on CsPbI2Br film. As a result, hole extraction was facilitated from CsPbI2Br to the carbon electrode and the nonradiative recombination loss was suppressed at the CsPbI2Br/carbon interface, yielding an optimized PCE of 14.67% (a JSC of 14.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.27 V and a FF of 0.798). More importantly, Cs2SnI6 nanocrystals also improved the moisture resistance of the CsPbI2Br film, thereby improving the ambient stability of the device.102 On the other hand, the incorporation of double 2D perovskite materials of Cs2PtI6 (i) optimized the energy level alignment by reducing the energy offset between the CsPbI2Br and carbon electrode, (ii) reconstructed and passivated the perovskite film by filling into the surface and grain boundaries of CsPbI2Br and (iii) served as a barrier to improve the moisture resistance of the perovskite film. As a result, highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with a reduction of defect density along with higher moisture resistance film surface were obtained, which accelerated the hole extraction and prevented
the moisture invasion, resulting in a higher PCE of 13.69% (a JSC of 14.85 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.28 V and a FF of 0.720) and excellent stability (i.e. ambient and thermal) for the device under investigation with 0.1 v% Cs2PtI6 in IPA solution.103 In addition to improving the energy level alignment, defect passivation and enhancing the moisture resistance/phase stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite, a dipole layer was induced when 4-aminotetrahydropyran bromide (ATHPBr) was inserted at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface. Thus, electrons on the perovskite surface were pushed away from the interface, and minimized the nonradiative recombination at the CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface. In the end, a PCE of 14.50% (a JSC of 14.28 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.30 V and a FF of 0.781) was achieved for the device with 2 mg mL−1 ATHPBr, and higher ambient stability was achieved as well.36


3.4.7 ETL/CsPbI2Br/HTL interface engineering. 
Compared with ZnO, bilayer ZnO/SnO2 ETLs achieved higher conductivity and induced the formation of high quality CsPbI2Br films with reduction of pinholes and grain boundaries, thereby facilitating the electron extraction efficiency more effectively. As a result, a higher PCE of 14.61% (a JSC of 16.33 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.25 V and a FF of 0.717) was achieved for the device with the ZnO/SnO2 bilayer ETL. Further sequential passivation by potassium bromide (KBr) and phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) on the CsPbI2Br film surface promoted the recrystallization of the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite, which led to the suppression of trap defects, larger perovskite grains and the formation of 2D perovskites. Consequently, the optimized device with a ZnO/SnO2 bilayer ETL and (KBr + PEACl) treatment achieved a PCE of 16.90% (a JSC of 16.82 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.29 V and a FF of 0.778), attributed to the enhanced interface contact and suppression of charge accumulation at the ETL/CsPbI2Br/HTL interface (Fig. 6a), which promoted the charge carrier extraction ability with reduced charge recombination. Under a N2 atmosphere, the device under investigation also demonstrated a longer device lifetime.104 On the other hand, ZnO at the ITO/SnO2 interface reduced trap-assisted recombination and improved extraction/separation of the free charge carriers, thereby improving the PCE up to 13.64% (a JSC of 14.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.25 V and a FF of 0.751) for the ITO/ZnO/SnO2 device (versus a PCE of 11.67% for the control device). Further treatment with guanidinium iodide (GAI, 2 mg mL−1) on the CsPbI2Br film surface suppressed the grain boundary-related defects, improved the energy band alignment between the CsPbI2Br and spiro-OMeTAD and stabilized the CsPbI2Br film. As a result, it led to the best PCE of 16.25% (a JSC of 15.58 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.27 V and a FF of 0.822) for the device under investigation with the ZnO/SnO2 ETL along with GAI treatment. Thanks to the GAI passivation inducing higher defect formation energy and ion migration energy, the ambient, thermal and light stability of the device were significantly improved (Fig. 6b–f).105

3.4.8 ETL/CsPbI2Br/carbon electrode interface engineering. 
Zhang et al. utilized potassium trifluoroacetate (KTFA) and 4-trifluorophenyl methylammonium bromide (CF3PMABr) to modify the SnO2 surface and CsPbI2Br films for application in C-CsPbI2Br PSCs. With the KTFA interlayer, the electron accepting ability of SnO2 was improved, attributed to KTFA suppressing the oxygen vacancies of SnO2, as well as improved electron mobility and conductivity of the SnO2. In addition to that, it was found that TFA− of KTFA could chemically link SnO2 and CsPbI2Br and passivated the interfacial defect, whereas K+ ion partially diffused into Cs-site of the perovskite lattice to facilitate uniform nucleation and crystallization of the CsPbI2Br film, resulting in (i) well-matched energy level alignment between the CBM of CsPbI2Br and the ETL, (ii) excellent CsPbI2Br film quality (highly crystalline, homogenous and compact CsPbI2Br films) with reduction of defect density in CsPbI2Br bulk films and at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface and (iii) released the interfacial strain within the system. As a result, electron extraction to the SnO2 ETL was improved and the charge recombination and ion migration at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface were suppressed, yielding a higher PCE of 12.68% (JSC of 14.89 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.23 V and a FF of 0.692). Further treatment on the CsPbI2Br film surface with CF3PMABr allowed the Br− to fill and passivate I/Br vacancies in CsPbI2Br, and formed a 2D (CF3PMA)2PbI4 perovskite capping layer between CsPbI2Br and the carbon electrode to facilitate the hole extraction at the CsPbI2Br/carbon interface (Fig. 6g). After optimization, a PCE of 14.05% (a JSC of 14.98 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.27 V and a FF of 0.737) was achieved for C-CsPbI2Br PSCs with 0.6 mg mL−1 KTFA and 2 mg mL−1 CF3PMABr treatment, and higher ambient, thermal and light stability was achieved. The long-term operational stability of the device was linked to the suppression of phase transition and the formation of the 2D barrier layer against moisture invasion.106

3.5. Other (more than one optimization techniques)
It is well-known that the film quality and optoelectronic properties of all functional layers (i.e. CsPbI2Br, ETL or HTL) are the key factors to determine the overall performance and stability of CsPbI2Br PSCs. In addition to optimizing a single functional layer (i.e. CsPbI2Br, ETL or HTL) of the device, researchers also used a dual-protection strategy to develop highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br PSCs, as will be discussed later. The photovoltaic properties and stability evolutions of CsPbI2Br PSCs after optimization are listed in Table 5.

Han et al. demonstrated that incorporation of 2,2 0-bis(trifluoromethyl)-[1,1 0- biphenyl]-4,4 0-diamine iodine (BFBAI2) in CsPbI2Br and ZnO precursors not only induced the formation of high moisture resistance CsPbI2Br films with reduced defect density (i.e. 1.19 versus 3.41 × 1016 cm−3), but also increased the built-in electric field of the device, which was beneficial for improving the charge separation and extraction at the CsPbI2Br/ZnO interface. As a result, a PCE of 14.38% (a JSC of 16.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.15 V, and a FF of 0.776) along with outstanding ambient and thermal stabilities was achieved for the inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs with 0.8 mol% BFBAI2 in the CsPbI2Br precursor and 0.25 wt% BFBAI2 in the ZnO precursor.107 Wang et al. showed that the hydrophobic film surface of the SnO2 ETL derived from SnCl4.5H2O ethanol solution (versus commercial SnO2 colloidal solution) could inhibit the perovskite heterogeneous nucleation, thus providing fewer nucleation sites and larger nucleus spacing for the growth of highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains. During the perovskite film annealing process, the residual Cl in SnO2 could volatilize from the bottom to top along the CsPbI2Br film, and restrained the formation of Pb–I antisite defects, resulting in a lower defect density in the CsPbI2Br bulk film and at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface. Further treatment with PbCl2 in the CsPbI2Br precursor led to the formation of the CsI–Pb[I/Br/Cl]2–DMSO intermediate phase, which induced rapid and even formation of the perovskite crystal nucleus to compensate for the fewer nucleation sites caused by the non-hydrophilic SnO2 ETL, leading to the quick colour change for the PbCl2-doped CsPbI2Br wet film (Fig. 7a). During the CsPbI2Br film annealing process, the perovskite crystal nucleus underwent a slow crystal growth progress via Ostwald ripening, thus forming high-quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes and reduced defect density (Fig. 7b). Due to the suppression of the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interfacial defects and the defects inside the CsPbI2Br bulk film, the device under investigation of the C-CsPbI2Br PSCs achieved the best PCE of 14.11% (a JSC of 14.70 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.26 V, a FF of 0.762), and long-term environmental stability was also achieved (i.e. N2 atmosphere and ambient air).108 On the other hand, Duan et al. showed that the addition of fullerene-ethylenediamine derivatives of C60-EDA in the SnO2 precursor suppressed the oxygen vacancies of SnO2 and decreased the hydrophobicity of the SnO2 film surface, which allowed the CsPbI2Br precursor to spread more uniformly and induced highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains and reduction of grain boundary defects. With C60-EDA, the energy level alignment between SnO2 and CsPbI2Br was optimized, which helped to facilitate electron extraction/injection. On the other hand, surface modification of CsPbI2Br films with 5-aminovaleric acid hydrobromide (5-AVABr) suppressed the formation of pinholes and the cracks of CsPbI2Br films. Benefitting from these, an efficient balance charge transfer for charge separation/extraction at the n–i–p interface (i.e. electron/hole mobility of 0.0017/0.0019 cm2 V s−1) was obtained for the device under investigation with 1 mg mL−1 C60-EDA and 3 mg mL−1 5-AVABr modification, with a PCE of 16.58% (a JSC of 15.41 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.34 V, and a FF of 0.803). Without encapsulation, the device under investigation retained >93% (>80%) after storage in dry air (aged at 85 °C) for 65 days (for 12 days).109 Li et al. demonstrated that the bilayer ETL of ZnO/Mg0.1Zn0.9O and the dopant free poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PM6) HTL possessed more compatible energy level alignment with CsPbI2Br than ZnO and spiro-OMeTAD. With ZnO/Mg0.1Zn0.9O films, the formation of high quality CsPbI2Br film morphology with reduced defect density occurred. Thus, the photo-generated free electrons/holes could be facilitated across the CsPbI2Br/ETL interface or the HTL interface more effectively with a low carrier recombination rate. The device under investigation achieved the best PCE of 16.04% (a JSC of 15.80 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.31 V, and a FF of 0.780), and excellent ambient stability was achieved as well.29 Later, the polymer donor material (PDM) of PBDB-T was used to treat the CsPbI2Br film surface via anti-solvent engineering and to replace the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD HTL. It was found that PBDB-T acted as a soft template to trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the CsPbI2Br precursor film. As a result, the defect density of the resultant CsPbI2Br-PT perovskite film was suppressed and larger perovskite grains were obtained, which led to higher carrier extraction efficiency. By replacing spiro-OMeTAD with PBDB-T, the fingerprint-like texture HTL was formed on the CsPbI2Br-PT film, which further enhanced the film conductivity and the interface contact for better hole extraction and transportation (Fig. 7c). A PCE of 16.40% (a JSC of 16.16 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.24 V, and a FF of 0.821) was obtained for the device with the PBDB-T passivation layer and the PBDB-T HTL. Furthermore, the device under investigation also exhibited longer device lifetime, attributed to the PBDB-T improving the moisture resistance and highly stable microstructure of PBDB-T preventing the ion migration in the device.110 Song et al. demonstrated that highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br PSCs could be realized with the addition of thienylmethylamine acetate (ThMAAc, Th) additive in the CsPbI2Br precursor, followed by a passivation layer of 2-((Z)-5,6-dichloro-2-((6-(7-(6-(((Z)-5,6-dichloro-1-(dicyanomethylene)-3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-inden-2-ylidene)methyl)-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-4-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-(2-ethylpentyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophen-2-yl)methylene)-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (BTCIC-4Cl) at the CsPbI2Br/P3HT interface. The authors found that the addition of the ThMAAc additive suppressed the α- to δ-phase formation, mitigated the formation of PbI2 and formed compact, highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains. On the other hand, BTCIC-4Cl formed a 3D skeleton-net and distributed evenly at the perovskite grain boundaries, which (i) passivated the surface and grain boundaries of the CsPbI2Br perovskite, (ii) bridged the CsPbI2Br and P3HT together to facilitate the hole transfer and (iii) released the compressive stress of the CsPbI2Br perovskite. A PCE of 16.30% (a JSC of 16.30 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.31 V, and a FF of 0.760) was achieved for the device under investigation with 2% ThMAAc and 2% BTCIC-4Cl. Under thermal stress in a N2 atmosphere, the device under investigation exhibited a negligible loss in PCE after 530 hours.111 The addition of 5% TbCl3 to the CsPbI2Br film deteriorated the film morphology but greatly improved the ambient phase stability of the resultant film (γ-CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br film). To repair the perovskite bulk film morphology, CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br quantum dots (QDs) in octane solution were then spin-coated on top of the γ-CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br film surface, followed by thermal treatment at 280 °C to obtain γ-CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br (BP) films. After modifying with QDs, a dense, uniform and smooth CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br (BP) film surface was obtained. Further treatment of the CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br QD on γ-CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br (BP) film surface filled the remaining pinholes in the γ-CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br films or at the perovskite grain boundaries, resulting in better passivation of the surface defect for the final perovskite film, which was denoted as CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br (SP). In addition to that, the as-proposed method also improved the perovskite phase stability. Benefitting from these, efficient charge extraction and reduction of charge accumulation at the perovskite interface were achieved for the device with CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2Br (SP) films. A PCE of 17.51% (a JSC of 16.34 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.32 V, and a FF of 0.815) was obtained for the device under investigation, and long term stability was demonstrated as well.112 Li et al. showed that the addition of the formamidinothiourea (FATU) dopant in the CsPbI2Br precursor could modulate the perovskite crystallization process and passivate both shallow-/deep-level defects at the grain boundaries, thereby inducing highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with reduced lattice micro-strains, low defect density (i.e. 3.4 versus 9.3 × 1014 cm−3) and enlarged perovskite grains up to micron-meter size (i.e. 2 μm) (Fig. 7d). Further treatment with formamidinium bromine (FABr) healed the defective surface (i.e. FA+ and Br− filled in the vacancies of Cs+ and I−/Br−) and realized cationic exchange with the CsPbI2Br underneath layer, forming a gradient band alignment at the CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD interface (Fig. 7e). Benefitting from these, the separation/extraction of the free electrons and holes were facilitated, which greatly enhanced the VOC and FF of CsPbI2Br PSCs. A PCE of 16.74% (a JSC of 15.58 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.34 V, and a FF of 0.802) along with outstanding ambient and light illumination stability was achieved for the device under investigation derived from this dual-passivation strategy.113 On the other hand, neodymium triiodide (NdI3) in the CsPbI2Br precursor induced highly crystalline CsPbI2Br films with larger perovskite grains (∼300 nm versus ∼150 nm) and reduction of trap defect density, as well as enhanced carrier mobility of the modified CsPbI2Br film. Further treatment with the 4-lithium styrenesulfonic acid/styrene copolymer (LiSPS) interface layer between the CsPbI2Br and spiro-oMeTAD passivated the bulk/interfacial defects of CsPbI2Br, which facilitated the charge extraction (a shorter extraction lifetime of 100 versus 132 ns) and suppressed the charge recombination within the device. A PCE of 17.05% (a JSC of 16.98 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.25 V, and a FF of 0.810) along with outstanding device stability in a N2 atmosphere was achieved for the optimized device with 2 mol% NdI3 and 15 nm LiSPS.114

4. Conclusions and future outlook
We have systematically reviewed inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs, from the fundamentals to the device optimization. It should be noted that among the family of inorganic caesium halide perovskites (CsPbX2, X = I or Br or mixed halides), CsPbI2Br is an ideal absorber layer for solar cell applications due to its higher α-phase stability (versus CsPbI3) and suitable Eg of 1.92 eV (vs. CsPbBr3). To date, CsPbI2Br PSCs have been optimized with the best PCE of 17.8%,72 but it is still far away from the theoretical efficiency limit, as shown by the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit.115 Furthermore, the inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs lifetime is still far behind mature photovoltaic technologies with a lifetime of >20 years.116 To promote the development of highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br PSCs with PCE >20% in the future,117 some suggestions are proposed and listed below:

(i) Optimization of CsPbI

2

Br films. As the core part of PSCs, high-quality CsPbI2Br films are important to improve the charge carrier diffusion length of the perovskite over 1 μm by minimizing the electronic trap state density of the perovskite film. The best way to achieve this goal is through interface engineering and dopant engineering. For interface engineering, the energy level of the interface layer must be suitable with the CsPbI2Br perovskite and the charge transporting layer to minimize the energy barrier that can induce the charge accumulation or charge recombination between the perovskite and charge transporting layer. For dopant engineering, the dopant concentration should not be too high to deteriorate the perovskite film morphology or distort the perovskite lattice. It is suggested to make sure the dopants are completely dissolved in the solvent through a stirring process, followed by adding it into the precursor solution according to the volume ratio.

(ii) Design of a new charge transporting layer. For regular CsPbI2Br PSCs, the commonly used ETL and HTL are ZnO, SnO2, TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, respectively. By contrast, for inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs, the commonly used ETL and HTL are PCBM, fullerene derivatives and NiOx, respectively. However, CsPbI2Br PSCs derived from these charge-transporting layers exhibit a low PCE. Thus, it is important to design new types of charge-transporting layers with excellent electrical and optical properties and suitable energy level alignment with the CsPbI2Br perovskite. Furthermore, theoretical calculations are necessary to understand the physical/chemical properties of the newly designed charge-transporting layer. Therefore, research collaboration across multidisciplinary research fields (chemistry, materials sciences and physics) is urgently needed. The optimal choice can increase the photovoltaic parameters such as JSC, VOC and FF. Herein, 2D materials such as graphene-based materials, transition metal dichalcogenides, carbon nitrides, etc. are proposed to be used as new charge-transporting layers. The 2D material-based charge transporting layer not only exhibits excellent electrical properties, but can also act as a barrier to isolate the air-moisture from surrounding and improve the device stability.

(iii) Addition of plasmonic nanoparticles or geometric design. To enhance light absorption without increasing the thickness of the CsPbI2Br absorber layer, metallic plasmonic nanoparticles (Au and Ag) are proposed to incorporate either into the (i) charge transporting layer, (ii) CsPbI2Br absorber layer or (iii) between the charge transporting layer and CsPbI2Br. It is known that light scattering induced by the plasmonic nanoparticles can increase the optical path length and improve the photon absorption efficiency, thereby increasing the JSC of the devices. Other than plasmonic nanoparticles, geometric design of the device should also be considered to maximize the light absorption of the CsPbI2Br absorber layer. More details can be referred to from these papers, as discussed by Ai et al.118 and Berry et al.119

(iv) Multi-junction solar cells. According to the S–Q limit,115 the theoretical PCE of the single junction CsPbI2Br PSC is ∼25% (i.e., with an Eg of ∼1.9 eV, depending on the CsPbI2Br film preparation process). To obtain a PCE beyond the S–Q limit, monolithic tandem CsPbI2Br PSCs are needed. In this case, the CsPbI2Br PSC is suitable for the front cell of CsPbI2Br/bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. By optimizing the CsPbI2Br front cell, as discussed above, we believe that monolithic tandem CsPbI2Br PSCs can provide higher device performance with superior stability. In 2021 and 2022, the bottom cell derived from low Eg organic semiconductors of PM6:Y6-BO,120 PM6:Y6,121,122 and D18:Y6122 blend films have delivered a PCE of >20%. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the idea of a ‘tandem cell’ is an important direction to further enhance all types of solar cell performance to surpass the S–Q limit of 31–33% for single-junction solar cells.

(v) Encapsulation. Although inorganic CsPbI2Br exhibits higher thermal stability, the phase stability can easily be affected by the ambient environment. Thus, the development of advanced encapsulation techniques and the fundamental understanding of materials chemistry and device physics are needed to stabilize inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskites. Suitable encapsulations can guarantee superior device performance with outstanding stability, as well as reduce the lead leakage from the devices.123 Different types of encapsulation methods have been summarized in detail, such as (i) single layer/muti-layer hydrophobic thin film encapsulation, (ii) curable adhesive encapsulation and (iii) glass–glass vacuum lamination encapsulation.123,124

(vi) Upscaling CsPbI

2

Br films. It is known that the homogeneity of CsPbI2Br films is hard to control when increasing the substrate area. To upscale the CsPbI2Br film, the nucleation and crystallization of the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite on a large area substrate must be well understood. In addition, the optimum deposition parameters of the types of equipment (doctor-blade coater, slot-die coater, inkjet printing machine, etc.) should be thoroughly investigated to obtain high-quality CsPbI2Br films.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials are unstable under humid and thermal conditions due to the hygroscopic and volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), which seriously affects the performance and stability of the devices. By replacing organic cations with inorganic caesium (Cs+) cations, the intrinsic stability of perovskite materials is significantly improved. Among inorganic perovskite materials such as CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2 and CsPbBr3, CsPbI2Br exhibits excellent phase stability and a suitable energy bandgap for solar cell applications. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made toward the construction of highly efficient and stable CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in recent years. In this review, a detailed review on CsPbI2Br halide perovskite materials, their recent progress and the remaining challenges in the field of CsPbI2Br PSCs are presented.
