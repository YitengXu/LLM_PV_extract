    , Accepted 7th October 2013First published on 9th October 2013AbstractHybrid solar cells, based on organic and inorganic semiconductors, are a promising way to enhance the efficiency of solar cells because they make better use of the solar spectrum and are straightforward to fabricate. We report on a new hybrid solar cell comprised of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([71]PCBM), and poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene poly styrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The properties of these PEDOT:PSS/a-Si:H/[71]PCBM devices were studied as a function of the thickness of the a-Si:H layer. It was observed that the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current density of the device depended on the thickness of the a-Si:H layer. Under simulated one sun AM 1.5 global illumination (100 mW cm−2), a power conversion efficiency of 2.84% was achieved in a device comprised of a 274 nm-thick layer of a-Si:H; this is the best performance achieved to date for a hybrid solar cell made of amorphous Si and organic materials.
Introduction
Solar energy has been regarded as one of the best sources of green energy since sunlight is clean, abundant, and limitless. Solar cells can continue to operate reliably for many years with very low-maintenance costs. Conventional solar cells are mostly based on crystalline silicon (Si) which usually require high purity Si materials and complicated processes to fabricate p–n junctions; thus, they are not cost-effective for widespread utilization.1 Recently, organic solar cells composed of polymers and fullerene derivatives have been studied extensively, and have achieved power conversion efficiencies exceeding 8%.2–4 Advantages of solar cells made of organic materials include straightforward fabrication, lightweight devices, and device flexibility.5
Beyond solar cells made solely of organic materials, organic and inorganic semiconductor hybrid systems have recently attracted considerable attention6–9 and aim to combine the advantages of organic and inorganic materials.10 Various promising hybrid solar cells have been studied, including devices which utilize conjugated polymers with Si, cadmium selenide (CdSe), lead sulfide (PbS), and lead selenide (PbSe).3,11–13 Among these hybrid systems, Si-based hybrid cells are particularly attractive. Previous efforts to fabricate Si-based hybrid systems were made by pairing Si nanoparticles, nanorods, or hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with conjugated polymers like poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV).14–18 Of Si-based devices, those fabricated using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) are attractive because thin films of a-Si:H can be fabricated at low temperatures, are low cost, and they are compatible with flexible substrates. However, previous studies have reported relatively poor performances using a-Si:H. More specifically16,19 the McGehee group has fabricated hybrid bilayer solar cells consisting of P3HT or MEH-PPV with a-Si:H which resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 0.16% and 0.21%.17,18
In this work, we increase the area of hybrid solar cells by fabricating a novel hybrid solar cell comprised of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([71]PCBM), and poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Our cell mimicks a p–i–n stack type of solar cell in which the PEDOT:PSS, [71]PCBM, and a-Si:H serve as the p-type layer, n-type layer, and i-layer, respectively. In the course of our study to determine the optimal configuration of our novel hybrid solar cell, we controlled the thickness of the a-Si:H layer by varying the deposition time (from 10 to 50 min) in plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). It was observed that an optimal thickness for a-Si:H was 274 nm which was achieved by deposition by PECVD for 30 min. At this thickness, the hybrid solar cell demonstrated a short circuit density (JSC) of 9.77 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.58 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.50 and PCE of 2.84%. This is the first demonstrated architecture of a hybrid solar cell with PEDOT:PSS, [71]PCBM, and a-Si:H. Furthermore, the efficiency of our hybrid solar cell is the best performance reported to date.
Experimental
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, then sonicated in distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried overnight in an oven. Next, an aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS was spun-cast to form a film with a thickness of approximately 40 nm. The films were annealed for 10 min at 140 °C in air. The PEDOT:PSS coated ITO films were loaded into a PECVD chamber and heated to 200 °C prior to the thin film Si deposition. Pure silane SiH4 with a flow rate of 42.3 sccm, H2 155 sccm and 450 mTorr were used for the a-Si:H layer deposition, and five sets of devices were prepared and then transferred into a nitrogen filled glove-box; the deposition conditions are given in Table 1. Next, [71]PCBM was deposited from solution dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene on top of the a-Si:H layer. The concentration used for most samples was 12 g ml−1, which resulted in thicknesses ranging from 10 to 15 nm. Devices were completed by thermal evaporation of Al cathodes (∼100 nm thick) at a base pressure of 10−6 Torr. Measurements were carried out with the solar cells inside the glove box by using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. The solar cell devices were illuminated at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and AM 1.5G using a high quality optical fiber coupled to a Xenon arc lamp. The UV-vis absorption was measured using Varian 500E. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured as a function of the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm using a Model QEX7 system (PV Measurements Inc.), and spectroscopic ellipsometry (J.A. Woollam Co. M2000V) for the optical simulation was performed using Matlab. The refractive index (n) and absorption coefficient (k) were inserted to calculate the formula using Matlab.

Results and discussion
A novel hybrid solar cell structure, consisting of a p–i–n stack that is commonly used in conventional inorganic solar cells, has been investigated. In this work, the PEDOT:PSS, [71]PCBM, and a-Si:H served as the p-type layer, n-type layer, and i-layer, respectively.20,21 The structure of the PEDOT:PSS/a-Si:H/[71]PCBM hybrid solar cell and a cross-sectional image taken by high resolution transmittance electron microscopy (HR-TEM) are depicted in Fig. 1a and b, respectively.

Fig. 1b shows that the individual layers of our device were formed successfully and that each layer was clearly defined. As shown in Fig. 1c, the energy band diagram of PEDOT:PSS, a-Si:H, and [71]PCBM allows exciton dissociation at the interface energetically. Under the short circuit conditions, the energy band alignment of the components is illustrated in Fig. 1d. Typically, in hybrid solar cells, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the polymer must be above the conduction band of the inorganic material in the devices to flow the generated current. However, the structure of our device is unique in that the Fermi level of PEDOT:PSS is above the valence band edge of a-Si:H and the LUMO level of [71]PCBM, which is placed below the a-Si:H conduction band edge. Therefore, the generated electrons and holes can flow to Al and ITO, respectively, without inherent hindrance.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the a-Si:H, [71]PCBM, and a-Si:H/[71]PCBM layers is presented in Fig. 2. The absorption of a-Si:H/[71]PCBM bilayer film is attributed to strong absorption of a-Si:H. The thickness of a-Si:H was controlled by the deposition time, from 10 to 50 min, using PECVD and the detailed conditions are described in the Experimental section and in Table 1. The a-Si:H thickness was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry, and the error range was less than 10%.

Fig. 3 shows the current density as a function of voltage (J–V) for our hybrid solar cells. To improve the performance of our a-Si:H/[71]PCBM hybrid solar cells, we introduced thermal annealing treatment at 150 °C after the device fabrication. The data before the thermal treatment are presented in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI†), and we observed that the performance was enhanced after thermal treatment. Many researchers have demonstrated improvement in organic and hybrid solar cell efficiency following thermal annealing, primarily in the form of increasing JSC and FF.17 It is believed that thermal treatment increases the bonding strength and contact area between the electrode and the active layer thereby improving the device performance.21,22 In addition, in this work we assume that the thermal annealing induces the diffusion of Al atoms into the [71]PCBM layer to form a thin interlayer between them. This Al diffusion reduces the contact resistance between the Al electrode and the active layer.23 The results of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE are summarized in Table 2. Normally it is known that 100–200 nm is a good thickness for the intrinsic layer in a conventional a-Si solar cell. In this study, increasing the thickness of the a-Si:H layer had a positive effect on the performance up to 274 nm, including a significant improvement of the JSC and VOC. On the other hand, devices with an a-Si:H layer thickness of above 274 nm diminished the performance, including a diminished JSC and VOC.

In most polymer bilayer solar cells, a 20–35 nm-thick layer of a fullerene derivative layer is fabricated; this thickness is less than the donor polymer layer because the traveling distance of the holes to extract is farther than that of the electrons.24,25 In other words, it is the conduction and/or extraction of electrons that ultimately limits the performance of the device. For our hybrid solar cells, 10 nm of [71]PCBM thickness is an optimal condition. However, increasing the thickness of the [71]PCBM layer to around 20 nm is not found to increase the performance as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI†). We have also compared the performance with different p-type materials as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). Under one sun AM 1.5G illumination, devices with a 274 nm thickness of a-Si:H and 10 nm [71]PCBM showed a PCE of 2.84% with the JSC, VOC, and FF of 9.87 mA cm−2, 0.58 V, and 0.50, respectively. In fact, devices with a 274 nm layer of a-Si:H showed a 30% enhancement in PCE compared to devices with an 81 nm thickness of a-Si:H. Furthermore, the value of JSC was also significantly improved even though a flat ITO substrate was utilized. Moreover, we have checked the stability of the hybrid solar cells with light exposure for 100 hours, and significant decreases of JSC and efficiency are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which are attributed to the Staebler–Wronski effect.26
To estimate the JSC of our hybrid solar cell devices, the EQE was measured (Fig. 4). The highest JSC was obtained in devices that had a 274 nm-thick layer of a-Si:H. In addition, these devices reached a 74% EQE at a wavelength of 470 nm. In our EQE spectra, because we utilized the flat ITO substrates, interference patterns were observed which originated from optical interference between the incident light and light that back-reflected from the metal electrode. We also measured the reflectance spectra of the solar cells to confirm the interference effect (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  EQE spectra of a-Si:H/[71]PCBM solar cells with different thicknesses of a-Si:H layers. 
Good agreement between the interference patterns, the reflectance, and the EQE spectra permits a quantitative estimate of the fraction of the incident light absorbed by the photoactive layers at each wavelength. In general, light absorption in a thin film solar cell can be greatly affected by optical interference when the device is optically thin and has a highly reflective back electrode. Moreover, the JSC is related to the optical properties and the active layer thickness.27,28 Our a-Si:H/[71]PCBM hybrid solar cells have thin layers of only around 100–500 nm and an Al electrode which has a high reflectivity. If we use textured transparent conductive oxide substrates for the electrode of our a-Si:H/[71]PCBM solar cells, we would not observe the interference effect by scattering and could achieve a higher current density.
To determine the change of the intensity of the electromagnetic field in the active layer, we compared the profile of the square modulus of the electromagnetic field amplitude versus the thickness of a-Si:H at wavelengths of 400 to 800 nm in the mesh image (see Fig. 5a). The inputs to the model include the index of refraction n (λ), the extinction coefficient k (λ), the thickness of each layer, the spectral irradiance, angle of incidence, and polarization of the illumination. The calculation of the light field distribution was performed according to the literature.29–31 Optical constants (n, k) of each layer (ITO, PEDOT:PSS, a-Si:H, and [71]PCBM) have been determined by ellipsometric measurements and were used as input parameters by our software model (MATLAB). Ellipsometry consisted of fitting the dielectric functions obtained from the reflection spectrum. Fig. 5 shows the modulation of the electromagnetic field of the mesh image and the profiles of the electric field at 480, 580, and 680 nm in a device with a-Si:H of 274 nm in thickness. Modulation results for devices with different thicknesses of a-Si:H are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The intensity of the electromagnetic field is high in the PEDOT:PSS, ITO, and a-Si:H layer and the electromagnetic field continuously decreases in the [71]PCBM layer to finally decay to zero in the aluminum electrode layer. For devices with a 274 nm-thick a-Si:H layer, the relative intensity of the optical field distribution across the active layer was higher than the other configurations (see and compare with Fig. S4, ESI†). This is consistent with the JSC results of J–V characteristics and the EQE in Fig. 3 and 4.

Fig. 6 shows the J–V characteristics of the solar cells with different thicknesses of a-Si:H in the dark. The VOC depends on the saturation current density (J0) and JSC can be calculated from eqn (1).32,33 (1)where q is the charge of an electron, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. While JSC typically has a small variation, the saturation current plays a key role in the VOC since it is varied by orders of magnitude. To attain a high VOC, the J0 needs to be very low because leakage current leads to a reduced VOC. We measured the J–V curves in the dark to characterize the relation between the J0 and the VOC at different thicknesses of a-Si:H layer (81–475 nm). The diode saturation current density, extracted from the intercept on the vertical axis from the log current–voltage graph (Fig. 6), falls from a high of 100 to 10−2 mA cm−2. The result allows us to further conclude that the shift in the curves is related to the thickness of a-Si:H layer. The device with a-Si:H layer of 274 nm had the lowest J0 value, leading to the highest VOC value; the other devices also followed this trend.

To understand the role of the thickness of the a-Si:H layer in our solar cells, device performance was studied as a function of the layer thickness (Fig. 7). Fig. 7a indicates that the VOC is related to the thickness and the highest VOC value of the diode was obtained with a layer thickness of 274 nm. Moreover, the JSC also increased with the thickness of a-Si:H up to 274 nm (Fig. 7b). A corresponding increase in the JSC was not observed in devices thicker than 274 nm of a-Si:H. Therefore, using our flat substrate, a thickness of 274 nm was optimal in our device system. The measured fill factor was nearly independent of the thickness of a-Si:H (Fig. 7a). As a result, the PCE of the devices follows the trends observed in VOC and JSC as shown in Fig. 7b.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated a new type of hybrid PEDOT:PSS/a-Si:H/[71]PCBM solar cell and have investigated the device performance with different thickness of a-Si:H. Devices containing an a-Si:H layer of 274 nm in thickness resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 2.84%, the best of all configurations. In comparison to previous work in the field, an efficiency of 2.84% is a significant improvement. Furthermore, this work is the first study to use [71]PCBM and a-Si:H in an organic–inorganic hybrid solar cell. Although the efficiency of our a-Si:H/[71]PCBM solar cell needs to be further improved for high-end applications, this study offers a supportive guideline for further research into hybrid solar cells. Therefore, our device indicates that a-Si:H and [71]PCBM are promising candidates for a new category of organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells.
