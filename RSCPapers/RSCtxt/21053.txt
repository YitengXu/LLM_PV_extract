    , Accepted 8th November 2019First published on 19th November 2019AbstractRandom copolymerization has been successful in synthesizing conjugated polymers for application in polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, fine energy level modulation without negatively affecting other properties such as optical, electrical, and morphological properties is challenging for random copolymers. In this work, a set of random conjugated copolymers (named P2TBT-BT, P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX) with minor structural changes have been synthesized by replacing the difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT) unit with its difluorobenzoxadiazole (BX) analog. The four random conjugated copolymers show desirable similarities in optical, charge transport, and morphological properties, but gradually down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (P2TBT-BT > P2TBX-BT > P2TBT-BX > P2TBX-BX). When blended with a fullerene-based acceptor ([70]PCBM), a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.8% was achieved by P2TBT-BT benefitting from the well matched energy level alignment between the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor. This work provides a strategy for energy level modulation of random conjugated copolymers without negatively affecting other properties. Besides, we found that high energetic order can be obtained for random conjugated polymers. These results will provide inspiration for the rational design of new random conjugated copolymers for high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
In the past two decades bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their promising prospect as a practical renewable energy technology.1–4 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have increased from ≈5% to 16–17% owing to significant progress in the past ten years.5–7 These achievements were greatly driven by the development of new materials, especially state-of-the-art photoactive donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated polymers based on a few prominent building blocks such as benzodithiophene (BDT),8,9 difluorobenzothiadiazole (ffBT),10,11 naphthobisthiadiazole (NT),11,12 benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),9,13–15 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),16,17etc. The device parameters including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE can be improved by fine-tuning the chemical structures of these D–A alternating conjugated polymers.2,9,18–20 Moreover, the random copolymer design offers further opportunities to achieve high-performance PSCs by finely modulating the optoelectronic and morphological properties which are challenging for regular D–A alternating conjugated polymers.21 So far, random copolymerization has been proved to be a facile and reliable method in polymer synthesis for realizing high-performance PSCs.21–27,29–35 For example, we have demonstrated multiple advantages of random copolymers for PSC application, such as no batch-to-batch variation in device application, and desirable processability from non-halogenated solvents under mild conditions.22 More recently, by utilizing a new non-fullerene electron acceptor Y6,28 a few research groups such as Peng,29 Ge and Hou,30 and Guo and Yan31 all demonstrated over 16% device efficiency for random copolymer-based PSCs benefitting from the favorable crystallinity and processability of random copolymers. Moreover, we and a few groups have demonstrated the potential of random copolymer design for n-type conjugated polymers, which have afforded highly efficient and stable all-polymer solar cells.32–35 For example, by introducing a fraction of amphilic oligoethylene oxide (OE) chains on a naphthalenediimide-based polymer acceptor, the morphology and nanostructures of the resulting polymer:polymer BHJ blends can be finely optimized.32
Like regular D–A alternating conjugated polymers, modulating the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is highly critical to random D–A alternating conjugated polymers for realizing high device performance.36 An appropriate energy level alignment between the donor and acceptor in BHJ blends is desirable to achieve high-performance PSCs via maximizing Jsc and Voc.37,38 Generally, Jsc is related to the LUMO–LUMO offset and HOMO–HOMO offset between the donor and acceptor, which are regarded as the driving forces for electron transfer and hole transfer, respectively.37,38 While Voc is proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor.38 However, additional effects on the optical, electrical, and morphological properties usually accompanied the energy level modulation of random conjugated copolymers, which makes the correlation of the energy level with device performance very difficult.39–43 For example, Jo et al. have reported random conjugated copolymers composed of DPP and isoindigo chromophores in different ratios with varied energy levels, but the absorption spectra and morphologies changed greatly at the same time.39 Kim et al. also demonstrated such complexity in BDT, DPP, and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione based random conjugated copolymers.40 Moreover, the random distribution of the building blocks causes the formation of separate chromophores along the polymer backbone, which makes the energy level modulation of random copolymers much more complicated than that of regular D–A alternating conjugated polymers.40,41,45 It was also concerned that random copolymers will create energetic disorder due to irregular band fluctuations along the conjugated chains, thus deteriorating charge transport.46–48 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a strategy for energy level modulation of random conjugated copolymers without negatively affecting the optical, electrical, and morphological properties.
Previously, we have reported a high-performance random conjugated copolymer P2TBT-BT (denoted previously as Th35) based on a thienyl-substituted BDT donor unit and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-dithienobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (2TBT) and 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT) acceptor units, which offered a PCE of ≈8% in PSCs when blended with a fullerene-based acceptor ([70]PCBM).22 Starting from this polymer, we herein report an effective strategy to modulate the energy levels of random D–A alternating conjugated copolymers without negatively affecting other properties for achieving high-performance PSCs. By replacing the BT unit with its more electron-negative difluorobenzoxadiazole (BX) analog48,49 in the backbone of P2TBT-BT, three new random copolymers P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX (Fig. 1) were formed. The four random copolymers show similar optical, charge transport, and morphological properties, but gradually down-shifted LUMO/HOMO levels upon replacing BT units by BX units or replacing 2TBT units by 5,6-difluoro-4,7-dithienobenzo[2,1,3]xadiazole (2TBX) units. These desirable characteristics render the polymers very favorable for investigating the relationship of the chemical structure, energy level, and device performance of random copolymers without other affecting factors. When blended with [70]PCBM, a high PCE of 8.8% has been achieved by P2TBT-BT due to the matched energy level alignment between P2TBT-BT and [70]PCBM. Moreover, an unambiguous relationship between the energy levels and device performance has been established for random conjugated copolymers based on this set of polymers. Overall, we demonstrate a strategy for energy level modulation of random conjugated copolymers without negatively affecting the optical, charge transport, and morphological properties. Besides, we found that high energetic order can be obtained for random conjugated polymers, suggesting that energetic disorder should not be a limitation for random copolymers with respect to regular D–A alternating conjugated polymers. Although the results are acquired from fullerene-based devices, they should afford broader inspiration, and will facilitate the development of high-performance PSCs based on random copolymer designs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Design and synthesis of random copolymers
The chemical structures of the random copolymers (P2TBT-BT, P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX) are shown in Fig. 1. Each polymer is copolymerized from a BDT donor unit and two acceptor units (2TBT/2TBX and BT/BX). The molar percentage of the 2TBT/2TBX monomer and BT/BX monomer is set to be 35% and 65% in the polymerization, respectively. The structures of the four random copolymers are differed by changing the BT unit with the BX unit or by changing the 2TBT unit with the 2TBX unit from the parent polymer P2TBT-BT. Since an oxygen atom is more electron negative than a sulfur atom, the energy levels of the polymers will be changed by replacing 2TBT/BT with 2TBX/BX. Moreover, previous reports have shown that changing from BT to BX will not change the optical bandgap and microstructure of the resulting polymers.44,49–51 Therefore, these polymers are ideal models for rigorous investigation of random copolymers on how the device performance is influenced by energy levels.
The synthetic route (Fig. S1, ESI†) and detailed procedures for the preparation of the random copolymers are shown in the ESI.† The four random copolymers were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization with reasonable yields. The resulting copolymers can be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at room temperature. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 150 °C showed that the copolymers have similar number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 60–70 kDa and molar-mass dispersities (ĐM = Mw/Mn) of 2.0–3.0 (Table 1). The similar solubilities and molecular weights ensure a fair and rigorous comparison for the device performance of these random copolymers in PSCs. The thermal stability of the copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the results are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). P2TBT-BT, P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX showed good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss at temperatures of 373, 388, 378, and 372 °C, respectively. The copolymers exhibited similar DSC curves without melting and crystallization characteristic peaks.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical absorption of the four random copolymers in o-DCB solution and in thin films was recorded by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1a, respectively. In thin films, all the copolymers show absorption maxima at 658–662 nm, with onsets at 730–734 nm, affording a similar optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.69–1.70 eV (Table 1). In o-DCB solution, the absorption spectra of the copolymers show similar characteristics to those in the thin films. These results suggest that the sulfur and oxygen atoms transforming between BT and BX units in the copolymer backbones have little influence on the light absorption of the random copolymers.
The energy levels of the four random copolymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments (Fig. S4, ESI†). Relevant data are listed in Table 1, and the energy level diagram of the four random polymers and [70]PCBM is shown in Fig. 2b. The LUMO levels of the random copolymers exhibit a gradual down-shift going from P2TBT-BT to P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX due to the more electron negative nature of BX with respect to BT.44,49–51 The main difference originates from P2TBT-BT to P2TBX-BT, while the difference among the three BX-containing polymers P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX is relatively smaller, suggesting that the BX-containing chromophores dominate the reduction processes due to the higher electron-affinity of BX than BT. The HOMO levels of the four random copolymers are also down-shifted going from P2TBT-BT to P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX, but the changes are less significant because they all have the same donor unit (BDT) that is susceptible to oxidation. Thus, an apparent discrepancy between the electrochemical bandgap and optical bandgap emerged, suggesting the complexity of energy level modulation of random copolymers. Furthermore, the energy level modulation was illustrated by density functional theory calculations (Fig. S5, ESI†), which show that introducing more BX units into the polymer backbone can result in gradually down-shifted LUMO/HOMO levels. Overall, the LUMO/HOMO levels of the random copolymers are successfully modulated by replacing the BT unit with the BX unit. The HOMO–HOMO offsets (ΔEHOMO) and LUMO–LUMO offsets (ΔELUMO) between the copolymers and [70]PCBM decrease gradually going from P2TBT-BT to P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX. Generally, a higher offset is beneficial for efficient charge transfer in donor:acceptor BHJ blends.36 Thus, it is expectable that P2TBT-BT and P2TBX-BX will afford most efficient and poorest charge generation, respectively.

2.3. Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were evaluated in PSCs with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/copolymers:[70]PCBM/poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Ag under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best devices for each copolymer are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The device metrics for the champion devices are listed in Table 2. The photovoltaic properties of the PSCs under different fabrication conditions are shown in Table S1 in the ESI.† The P2TBT-BT:[70]PCBM solar cell shows a PCE of 8.8% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 13.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.73, even higher than our previous results because of the different device structure.22 Compared to P2TBT-BT, the device performance of the BX-containing copolymers decreased gradually, and the PCEs are 7.9%, 7.0%, and 6.7% for P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX, respectively. The Voc increases slightly upon replacing BT units by BX units in the polymer backbones, but the Voc enhancement is within 0.05 V for the four random copolymers. This is consistent with the change in the HOMO energy levels of the copolymers (Fig. 2b and Table 1). However, the Jsc and FF show a distinct decrease upon introducing BX units into the copolymers. The difference is manifested by P2TBT-BT and P2TBX-BX. The Jsc is decreased from 13.8 to 11.7 mA cm−2, while the FF is decreased from 0.73 to 0.61.

The EQE spectra of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 3b. The PSCs show a broad EQE response over the spectral region from 300 to 750 nm, which is consistent with the absorption of the copolymers. The EQE values of the PSCs based on the four random copolymers all exceed 50% in the range from 450 to 700 nm. Particularly, P2TBT-BT yields >60% EQE in this range. The broad and high EQE response (EQEmax = 69%) of P2TBT-BT based devices indicates efficient charge transfer in the BHJ film, which is consistent with the highest Jsc value of the PSCs. Meanwhile, the EQE responses at 670–680 nm show a decreasing tendency upon introducing BX units into the copolymers, which suggests less efficient electron transfer from the polymer donor to fullerene acceptor and is consistent with the LUMO–LUMO offset between the random copolymers and [70]PCBM.
2.4. Microstructures and morphologies
The structure orders of neat copolymer films and BHJ blend films were investigated using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The two-dimensional diffraction patterns and line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 4. These studies show that all the four copolymers take a preferred face-on orientation relative to the substrate. Moreover, they all show a similar lamellar peak in the in-plane direction (q = 0.266–0.270 Å−1, d = 23.3–23.6 Å, Table S4 in the ESI†) and a similar π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction (q = 1.71–1.72 Å−1, d = 3.64–3.67 Å, Table S4 in the ESI†). In the blend films, the crystallinities of the polymers are decreased, which are evidenced by the weaker diffraction peaks. But the polymers still exhibit a face-on orientation, with a similar lamellar peak in the in-plane direction (q = 0.281–0.283 Å−1, d = 22.2–22.3 Å, Table S4 in the ESI†) and a π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction (q = 1.74–1.79 Å−1, d = 3.51–3.62 Å, Table S4 in the ESI†). These results suggest that the polymers show similar packing modes and crystallinities in both neat films and polymer:[70]PCBM blend films. The morphology of the blend films was further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, all the blend films exhibit similar fibrillar structures with the formation of nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating networks. A similar morphology evidenced by GIWAXS and TEM suggests that the morphology is not the main factor for the different device performance of the polymer:[70]PCBM solar cells among the four random conjugated copolymers.

2.5. Charge generation, transport, and recombination
The reasons for the difference in Jsc and FF of the four random copolymers can be ascribed to several parts, including charge generation, transport, and recombination in the BHJ films. First, single photon counting time-resolved fluorescence and photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were conducted to estimate the exciton lifetime of the neat copolymers and to investigate photoinduced charge transfer processes at the donor/acceptor interfaces. As shown in Fig. 6a and Table 3, the transient fluorescence traces of all copolymers exhibit monoexponential decay, the exciton lifetimes of P2TBT-BT, P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX are 760, 820, 1000, and 1100 ps, respectively. However, the PL quenching efficiencies of P2TBT-BT, P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX in polymer:[70]PCBM blend films are 94%, 88%, 88%, and 82%, respectively (Fig. 6b). Therefore, although the exciton lifetimes show an increasing tendency upon replacing BT by BX in the random copolymers, the charge transfer efficiencies from the copolymers to [70]PCBM exhibit an opposite trend. The reason should be ascribed to the ΔELUMO values between the copolymers and [70]PCBM. The decreased ΔELUMO causes less sufficient driving force for electron transfer from the polymer to [70]PCBM.

The charge carrier mobilities in neat polymer films and polymer:[70]PCBM blend films were measured from single-carrier devices by fitting the J–V data to a space-charge-limited current model. The results are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). In neat polymer films, the four random copolymers exhibit similar hole mobilities (μh) of 1–3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. After blending with [70]PCBM, the four blend films also exhibit similar μh (1–3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Since the charge transport properties are influenced by the degree of energetic disorder, Urbach energies (EU) of the polymer:[70]PCBM blends were calculated from the external quantum efficiencies of the corresponding electroluminescent devices. The Urbach tail originates from structural disorder and thermal vibration and can be characterized quantitatively through evaluating the exponential EQE tail of their electroluminescent devices according to the form EQE(E) ∝ exp{(E − Eg)/EU} (E < Eg), where E is the photon energy, Eg is the optical band gap and EU is the Urbach energy.52 As shown in Fig. 6c, the photovoltaic devices based on the four random copolymers exhibit similar EU of ≈30 meV, indicating similar charge transport properties for the four random copolymers. Thus, the charge transport properties were not influenced by replacing BT units with BX units in these random copolymers and are not the main cause for the different device performance. Moreover, the absolute EU values of these random copolymers is small and even comparable to the benchmark regular D–A alternating conjugated polymers,47,53 which suggest that energetic disorder should not be a limitation for random copolymers.
Charge recombination of the PSCs was examined through the measurements of the light intensity dependence of the Jsc and Voc. The correlation of the Jsc and the light intensity (Plight) obeys the power law Jsc ∝ Pαlight, where α is an exponential factor that should be equal to 1 when all charge carriers are swept out before recombination.54 As shown in Fig. 6d, the α values of the PSCs from the fitting line are all close to unity for the four random copolymers, indicating that all charge carriers are swept out before recombination in these PSCs. The similar recombination characteristics are consistent with the charge carrier mobilities of the polymers and blends demonstrated above. Therefore, the different device performance of the four polymers can be mainly ascribed to the different LUMO–LUMO offsets and HOMO–HOMO offsets between the polymer donor and [70]PCBM acceptor.

oc loss analysis
Detailed Voc loss analysis is performed for the in-depth understanding of the different Voc of the solar cells made from the four random copolymers. The Voc of PSCs depends on the balance between photo-induced carrier generation and recombination. According to Kirchhoff's law, the gap-dependent radiative energy loss qΔVoc,SQ originating from the band-to-band absorption is inevitable.55 The existence of tail states in disorder semiconductors, resulting in redshifted absorption, gives rise to the additional radiative energy loss qΔVoc,abs. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 7, the difference of energy loss for these photovoltaic devices mainly originate from the qΔVoc,abs, indicating that the degree of energetic disorder strongly affects the recombination via tail states upon replacing BT units by BT units in these random copolymers.56 In addition, the energy loss ΔVnon-rad occurring through the non-radiative recombination pathway is related to the natural logarithm of electroluminescence (EL) external quantum efficiency EQELED, described by qΔVnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL) (Fig. S8, ESI†). According to Fermi statistics,52 the emission of semiconductors in equilibrium is directly influenced by the shape of density of states (DOS). A similar EL spectrum (Fig. S10, ESI†) and EQEEL suggest that the DOS of electrons in these semiconductors are almost identical. Overall, the EQEEL and ΔVnon-rad of the solar cells based on the four random copolymers are at the same level, which suggests the negligible influence of replacing BT units by BX units on the ΔVnon-rad of the solar cells.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a set of random D–A alternating conjugated copolymers (P2TBT-BT, P2TBX-BT, P2TBT-BX, and P2TBX-BX) with minor structural changes were synthesized for application in PSCs. The random copolymers were formed by replacing the BT unit with its BX analog starting from the parent polymer P2TBT-BT. The four random copolymers show similar optical, charge transport, and morphological properties, but gradually down-shifted LUMO and HOMO levels upon introducing BX units to replace BT units. Benefitting from these desirable features, the solar cell performance has been successfully optimized by fine-tuning the energy levels of the random copolymers without causing additional negative effects. As a result, a high PCE of 8.8% was achieved for P2TBT-BT due to the most favorable energy level alignment with [70]PCBM. Overall, this paper demonstrates a strategy for energy level modulation of random D–A alternating conjugated copolymers without negatively affecting the optical, charge transport, and morphological properties. Moreover, we found that small Urbach energy can be obtained for random conjugated polymers, which suggest that energetic disorder should not be a limitation for random copolymers with respect to regular D–A alternating conjugated polymers. Although the results are obtained from fullerene-based devices, they should afford broader inspiration for the development of new random copolymers with higher performance for efficient photovoltaic devices.
