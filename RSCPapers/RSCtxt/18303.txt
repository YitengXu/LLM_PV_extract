1. Introduction
The energy crisis and environmental pollution currently represent a substantial impediment. It is highly desirable to develop effective energy conversion and wastewater treatment technologies. Recently, Zn–air batteries, as advanced energy conversion devices, have attracted substantial attention due to their high energy density, eco-friendliness and low cost.1,2 Simultaneously, the electro-Fenton technology has gradually been a research focus in wastewater treatment, and it produces hydroxyl radicals via reacting H2O2 with Fe2+. The hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential, further effectively degrading the pollutants.3,4 As is known, the key point of this technology lies in the highly efficient and in situ preparation of H2O2.5–7
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the core reaction of the two above-mentioned technologies.8–12 Based on the dissociation barrier of oxygen adsorbed on the electrode surface, ORR includes 2e and 4e pathways, which can be utilized for the in situ synthesis of H2O2via an electrochemical method and the cathode of Zn–air batteries, respectively. Therefore, by choosing suitable catalysts, the 2e ORR process can occur on the cathode of the Zn–air batteries, and H2O2 can be in situ prepared at the same time, resulting in the cogeneration of electricity and H2O2.13 Furthermore, H2O2 can be decomposed to produce superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in several ways such as through a self-disproportionation reaction, H2O2 + e → OH− + ˙OH (photo-generated electrons), and reduction by the negative potential of the cathode;14–16 this can further degrade the pollutants by the strong oxidative ability of these radicals, as demonstrated in the succeeding sections. Finally, the electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system can be designed and constructed. To the best of our knowledge, up till now, no report on this integrated system has appeared. This integrated system can not only achieve the complementation and integration between energy conversion and water treatment technology, but also provide new concepts and feasible solutions for the practical applications of efficient, clean, sustainable energy and environments. It is worth emphasizing that developing highly efficient 2e ORR catalysts is very essential for the realization of this integrated system. Gratifyingly, abundant research on exploring 2e ORR electrocatalysts has been done and significant achievements have been obtained.17–25 Unfortunately, the electrocatalytic performance of all previously reported 2e ORR electrocatalysts is still poor. New ideas and methods are still needed to enhance the catalytic performance of 2e ORR.
Although solar energy is the most abundant renewable resource available on earth, the utilization efficiency is less than 1% by the activities on earth such as natural photosynthesis.26–29 Therefore, it is highly imperative to combine photochemical and electrochemical methods to obtain a photoelectrocatalyst with a higher performance in the catalytic 2e ORR, further improving the efficiency of the above-mentioned integrated system.
Inspired by this viewpoint, we rationally designed and synthesized a photo-enhanced 2e ORR electrocatalyst based on a novel p-type semiconductor polyterthiophene (pTTh) with a visible light response through a simple electropolymerization technology. First, pTTh was in situ electropolymerized onto the rotation ring disk electrode (RRDE) (abbreviated as RRDE@pTTh). The electrochemical characterization results manifested that the ORR activity was significantly improved upon illumination of the pTTh electrode. The onset potential positively shifted from 0.63 to 1.25 V (vs. RHE, all potentials mentioned in this research are relative to RHE unless declared otherwise), and the current was simultaneously enhanced by a factor of 30 at 0.6 V. It should be noted that the transferred electron numbers for the pTTh electrode ranged from 2.0 to 2.3 over the whole working potential range with or without illumination. Due to its excellent 2e ORR performance, pTTh was further in situ constructed onto a carbon paper (CP) as an individual electrode (abbreviated as CP@pTTh) and applied for H2O2 accumulation. As investigated, the H2O2 yield of CP@pTTh within 1 h of light irradiation apparently outperformed that in the dark, with 20-fold, 28-fold and 11-fold enhancements at 0.75, 0.85 and 1.0 V, respectively.
More noteworthy and importantly, the electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system was first designed and successfully in situ constructed based on this versatile photo-enhanced CP@pTTh as the air electrode of Zn–air batteries. The electricity output and H2O2 yield of this integrated system exhibited a low peak power density (60.5 μW cm−2 at 130.0 μA cm−2) and a low production of H2O2 within 1 h (13.7 mg L−1); upon light irradiation, it showed an extremely high peak power density (253.5 μW cm−2 at 195.0 μA cm−2) and a high yield of H2O2 (34.8 mg L−1). With the intention of making better use of the in situ generated H2O2 in wastewater treatment, by using RhB (16.0 mg L−1) as a simulated pollutant, the removal rate of RhB reached almost 100% in the discharging process of this integrated system for 1 h. This work provides a proof-of-concept electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system, showing promising potentials for applications that combine energy conversion with wastewater treatment technologies.
2. Experimental section
Electrode preparation
The pTTh electrode was prepared using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) polymerization of 2,2′,5′,2′′-terthiophene (TTh) on RRDE or CP in an acetonitrile solution including 10 mM TTh and 0.1 M LiClO4. The scanning potential range and scanning rate were 0–1.2 V and 50 mV s−1, respectively. The CV deposition cycles of RRDE and CP were controlled at 5 and 20 cycles, respectively.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using Quanta 400FEG. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were acquired on JEM-2010 (HR) operating at 200 kV. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves were obtained using Micromeritics ASAP2460. The pore size distribution was determined according to the BJH desorption model and faas correction. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were achieved on Dimension Fastscan. The light source was a xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300UV) and the light intensity of the pTTh surface was 300 mW cm−2. The reactive species in wastewater treatment were investigated by the electron spin resonance test with ESR-DMPO using the X-band (9.45 GHZ) with 5.00 G modulation amplitude and a magnetic field modulation of 100 kHz.
ORR measurements
Electrochemical measurements were obtained on a CHI760E instrument in a home-made three-electrode cell with either light irradiation or in the dark. RRDE@pTTh served as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) and Pt foil were adopted as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. For the conversion of the potential in this work, the formula E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.05916 × pH + 0.197 was used. The catalytic activity for ORR was evaluated in N2 or O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions with a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1.
The ring current (IR) was measured with a Pt ring electrode in a 0.1 M KOH solution. The Pt ring electrode was polarized at 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The electron selectivity of ORR at pTTh was calculated using eqn (1). The H2O2 yield was determined with eqn (2). (1) (2)Here, ID is the disk current density, IR is the ring current density, and N is the H2O2 collection efficiency of the Pt ring with a value of 0.37.30–32
The long-term stability of the as-prepared pTTh was tested by the chronoamperometry method. The applied potential and rotation speed of the pTTh electrode were controlled at 0.5 V and 800 rpm for 12 h, respectively.
H2O2 accumulation and wastewater treatment
The H2O2 accumulation was evaluated on the self-designed H-model cell. To prevent in situ generated H2O2 at the cathode from flowing to the anode and being further oxidized by the positive potential, an N211 membrane (Nafion®, Du Pont Company) was used for separating them. O2 was bubbled using a glass tube into the solution at a constant flow rate close to the cathode to keep the electrolyte in an O2-saturated situation. For three-electrode H2O2 accumulation, CP@pTTh was employed as the working electrode. The Ag/AgCl electrode (filled with the saturated KCl solution) and graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Different constant potentials were applied to the CP@pTTh electrode for H2O2 accumulation in a 0.1 M KOH solution. For the integrated system, only two electrodes (namely, the Zn foil and CP@pTTh) were adopted. When the Zn–air batteries outputted electricity, H2O2 could be in situ generated on the cathode.
Utilizing the chromogenic reaction of the produced H2O2 with potassium titaniumoxalate in acidic media, the H2O2 yield was indirectly calculated by measuring the intensity of the absorption peak of the reaction products with an UV-Vis spectrophotometer.7
A UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to evaluate the concentration of residual RhB with 553 nm absorbance for RhB.
Construction of the electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system
A proof-of-concept electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system was assembled using a CP@pTTh cathode and Zn foil anode, which were placed in a dual chamber and separated by an N211 membrane. O2 was bubbled using a glass tube into the solution at a constant flow rate of 200 mL min−1 close to the cathode to keep the electrolyte in an O2-saturated situation. The cathode chamber had a transparent quartz window on the side to let the light irradiate the surface of pTTh. For the characterizations of the outputting electricity and H2O2 cogeneration system, a 6.0 M KOH aqueous solution was adopted as the electrolyte for each chamber. For the characterizations of the pollutant degradation, a 6.0 M KOH + 16.0 mg L−1 RhB aqueous solution was used to replace 6.0 M KOH as the cathode electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology and pore structure characterizations of the as-prepared materials
As shown in Fig. 1a, pTTh is successfully fabricated using a facile electropolymerization method. In previous reports,33–35 CV technologies have been proven to be effective for preparing highly active photo-electrodes and conductive thin films. During the polymerization process, TTh monomers underwent electrochemical oxidation, and the free radicals from monomer oxidation were mutually coupled, leading to the chain growth; they were further deposited onto the surface of the electrode (please see Fig. S3† for the polymerization curves). Fig. 1b displays an SEM image with low magnification of the CP@pTTh electrode. It can be found that pTTh is uniformly deposited onto the framework of the carbon paper. Additionally, the SEM images with high magnification in Fig. 1c and d and the TEM image in Fig. S6† show the porous and flower-like morphology of pTTh with the assembly of ultra-thin nanosheets. This significantly helped the photo-generated charge carriers to arrive at the electrode–electrolyte interface rapidly and simultaneously suppressed the combination of charge carriers, thus resulting in a high photoelectrocatalytic performance of pTTh. In addition, the corresponding EDS mappings (Fig. 1f and g) demonstrate the presence and homogeneous distribution of C and S elements in pTTh. Due to the sheet-like structure of the as-prepared pTTh, the thickness and morphology of pTTh were studied via AFM. The AFM images (the inset of Fig. S1†) of the fragment prove the high-quality of the as-prepared pTTh. The cross-sectional analyses, corresponding to the blue line in the inset of Fig. S1,† demonstrate thickness of 2.0 nm for pTTh. To further investigate the pore structure of pTTh, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution are shown in Fig. S2a and b.† Fig. S2a† manifests an H3-type hysteresis loop, indicating the disordered and slit pore structure of pTTh, which results from the accumulation of the sheet-like structures. Also, the corresponding size distribution (Fig. S2b†) shows that large mesopores mainly exist in the as-prepared pTTh. This was advantageous for the rapid transport of the reactants and the accessibility of the active sites, further improving the ORR catalytic activity.

The characterizations of the band structure
The UV/Vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 2a shows that pTTh has a wide absorption range. The bandgap was estimated using the relationship proposed by Tauc et al.36 between the absorption coefficient, α, and the photo energy, hν, using the following formula: (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg)1/2(3)Here, α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency, A is a constant and Eg is the energy gap for the semiconductor. Fig. 2b shows that the bandgap of pTTh is 1.91 eV. Next, Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements were obtained to determine the flat-band potential. As exemplified in Fig. 2c, the negative slope indicates that pTTh is a p-type semiconductor. Moreover, the flat-band potential of pTTh was found to be 1.0 V, which could be approximately considered as the electrochemical potential of the VB top of pTTh.37 Combined with the UV-Vis results, it can be concluded that the energy levels of pTTh corresponding to the electrochemical potentials for CB and VB were −0.91 and 1.0 V, respectively (Fig. 2d). Gratifyingly, this energy level was propitious for the catalysis of 2e ORR, as demonstrated in the succeeding sections.

The characterizations of photoelectrocatalytic 2e ORR
To investigate the intrinsic photoelectrocatlytic ORR performance of the as-prepared pTTh, pTTh was in situ constructed onto the surface of RRDE as the working electrode to be further evaluated in a home-made three-electrode photoelectrocatalytic testing system (Fig. 3a and b); it was innovatively coupled to the traditional RRDE system and a light source. During the testing procedure, the light beam was irradiated onto the pTTh surface through the bottom of the self-designed electrochemical cells. Then, the as-synthesized pTTh on RRDE was excited by a light beam. CV curves in N2 and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH in the dark and light were recorded (Fig. 3c). Obviously, there was a distinct and sharp oxygen reduction peak for the O2-saturated solution compared with the featureless CV curves from the N2-saturated solution in the dark or under illumination. It is worth pointing out that the potential of the oxygen reduction peak of pTTh in the light positively shifted with respect to that in the dark, demonstrating that the catalytic ORR performance was considerably enhanced by photoinduction. Of note, Fig. 3d manifests that the onset potential of electrocatalyzing ORR on pTTh is approximately 0.63 V in the dark. Upon light irradiation, the onset potential significantly shifted to 1.25 V, which was much higher than the thermodynamic potential (E0 = 1.23 V) of the electrocatalytic ORR.38 Moreover, the current was enhanced by a factor of 30 at 0.6 V, which was consistent with the above-mentioned CV results. To prove the electron selectivity of the as-prepared pTTh, we monitored the ring current resulting from the oxidation of the intermediate H2O2 (Fig. 3d). Based on eqn (1) and (2), the transferred electron number and H2O2 yield were quantified with respect to the potential (Fig. 3e). The transferred electron number was in the range from 2.0 to 2.4 and the H2O2 yield was in the range from 80% to 100% over the whole working potential range, thus demonstrating that ORR on pTTh proceeded along a 2e transfer pathway in the dark or under illumination. To investigate the stability of pTTh, the chronoamperometric method was employed. Fig. 3f shows almost no decay for the pTTh catalyst after a 12 h chronamperometric test at 0.5 V with a continuous O2 flow in 0.1 M KOH and a rotation speed of 800 rpm,39,40 especially under light irradiation. This indicated the outstanding stability of pTTh for catalyzing ORR. In addition, there was almost no change in the morphology before and after the above-mentioned aging test (please see the SEM images in Fig. S7†).

The characterizations of H2O2 accumulation
Due to the promising 2e ORR performance of the as-prepared pTTh, the carbon paper (2.0 cm × 2.5 cm) (Fig. S4†) supported with pTTh (∼1.3 mg pTTh per cm2) (Fig. S5†) as the cathode was utilized for H2O2 accumulation using a self-designed H-model electrolytic cell. The device schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 4a. CP@pTTh and the carbon rod were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. The Ag/AgCl electrode (filled with a saturated KCl solution) was adopted as the reference electrode. For the sake of preventing the in situ prepared H2O2 at the cathode from flowing to the anode and being further oxidized by the positive potential, an N211 membrane (Nafion®, Du Pont Company) was used for separating them. As exhibited in Fig. 4b, the catalytic ORR performance of CP@pTTh under illumination is apparently better than that in the dark and that of the blank carbon paper. It should be noted that the H2O2 yields of CP@pTTh within 1 h upon light irradiation at 0.75, 0.85 and 1.0 V were 14.5, 9.5 and 3.9 mg L−1, respectively, with 20-fold, 28-fold and 11-fold enhancements compared with that in the dark (Fig. 4c). These results strongly suggest that the 2e ORR kinetics of pTTh can be significantly enhanced by photo-induction. To further prove the stability of the CC@pTTh electrode for H2O2 accumulation under light irradiation, the same electrode was used 7 times for H2O2 production in 1 h at a constant potential of 0.7 V. As clearly seen from Fig. 4d, the H2O2 yield is almost the same, thereby demonstrating its long-term durability.

The construction and characterization of the electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system
More interestingly and importantly, in this innovative research, a photo-enhanced Zn–air battery with simultaneous highly efficient in situ H2O2 generation and wastewater treatment was first designed and successfully assembled with the CP@pTTh cathode and a Zn foil anode. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows that the outputting peak power density of this integrated system is 60.5 μW cm−2 in the dark, and it increases to 253.5 μW cm−2 upon illumination, further confirming the photoenhancement effect; the corresponding mass current density and power density are exhibited in Fig. S8.† Furthermore, no obvious potential drop for the CP@pTTh electrode is observed under galvanostatic discharge for 3 h at 20 mA g−1 (Fig. 5c) in the dark or in light. For H2O2 accumulation, a 6.0 M KOH aqueous solution was adopted as the anodic and cathodic electrolyte. Fig. 5d shows the H2O2 content as a function of the discharging time for this integrated time. It can be seen that the H2O2 yield reached 13.7 mg L−1 within 1 h; upon light irradiation, a high yield of H2O2 (34.8 mg L−1) was obtained. To utilize the in situ H2O2 production to degrade the simulated pollutant RhB, the cathodic electrolyte was changed to 6.0 M KOH + 16 mg L−1 RhB and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5f. Fig. 5f shows that the intensity of the UV absorption peaks considerably decreases after discharging for 1 h, thus demonstrating that this integrated system exhibits a good performance for the degradation of pollutants. To further validate the reactive species and the mechanism accounting for the degradation of RhB, the spin-trapping ESR technique was carried out. Fig. 5e shows the results of the CP@pTTh electrode in the dark and in light. It is seen that the special spectrum with relative intensities of a 1:1:1:1 quartet signal can be considered to be characteristic of the DMPO-˙O2− adduct in the dark after discharging for 5 min. This was attributed to the weak spontaneous decomposition of the in situ generated H2O2. However, upon illumination, except for the above-mentioned quartet signal, a four-line ESR signal with relative intensities of 1:2:2:1 was additionally obtained, corresponding to the DMPO-˙OH adduct. The ESR results indicated that both ˙O2- and ˙OH radicals were produced in the light for RhB degradation. This was because photo-induction improved the decomposition of the in situ generated H2O2. This novel design provides a proof-of-concept electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system, showing promising potentials for applications that combine energy conversion with wastewater treatment technologies.

4. Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we constructed an electricity and H2O2 cogeneration-pollutant degradation integrated system based on a Zn–air battery with a p-type semiconductor pTTh as a photoelectrocatalyst for the highly efficient catalysis of 2e ORR. The outputting peak power density of this integrated system was 60.5 μW cm−2 in the dark and increased to 253.5 μW cm−2 upon illumination. The system simultaneously generated a high yield of H2O2 (34.8 mg L−1) and efficient pollutant degradation (almost 100% removal rate of 16 mg L−1 RhB) within discharging for 1 h. This work demonstrates that the photo-responsive pTTh 2e ORR catalyst can be efficiently used for photoelectrochemical energy conversion and wastewater treatment in a single unit.
