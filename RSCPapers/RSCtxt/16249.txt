    , Accepted 6th September 2021First published on 6th September 2021AbstractCdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core/shell quantum dots (QDs) are widely studied in quantum dot solar cells (QDSSCs). However, to date, there have been no detailed comparative investigations into the cell performance between CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core/shell structures prepared with the same preparation process. In this work, the performances of CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core/shell QDSSCs, which are prepared with the same SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reactions) process, are investigated in detail. By simply tuning the layer numbers and arrangement sequence of the CdS and CdSe layers, a series of QDs, including CdSSe alloy structures, CdS/CdSe multilayer structures, and CdS/CdSe core/shell structures, are successfully prepared with a layer-by-layer technique, while maintaining a similar morphology. Based on these QD sensitized TiO2 photoanodes, QDSSCs are assembled. The CdS/CdSe core/shell QDSSCs yield a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.08% under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is increased by 77% in comparison with that of CdSSe alloy QDSSCs (2.87%). The significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs with core/shell architectures is mainly attributed to their high short-circuit current density, which arises from the enhanced absorption intensity. In addition, the CdS/CdSe core–shell contributes to the attenuation of the interfacial charge recombination rate and prolongs the electron lifetime, resulting in more efficient charge collection in QDSSCs.
1. Introduction
The urgent demand of high-performance and cost-effective photovoltaic devices increases the emergence of new-generation solar cells. As promising photovoltaic devices, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have been extensively investigated due to the attractive characteristics of QDs, such as size tunable bandgaps, good chemical stability, high molar extinction coefficients and possible multiple exciton generation effects.1 Owing to these advantages, the theoretical value of QD solar cells reaches a high value of 44%.2 The record power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased to nearly 15% during the past few years.3–6 However, the PCE of chalcogenide QD based QDSSCs still lags behind their theoretical value and that of perovskite solar cells currently.7 As the core part of QDSSCs, QD sensitizers are important and must be developed.
Among the different kinds of QDs, CdS and CdSe have been intensively investigated due to their appropriate matching of energy levels, good chemical stability and compatibility with an electrolyte solution. CdS QDs have high electron injection into ZnO or TiO2. However, its visible light absorption capability is confined to 550 nm. The absorption spectrum of CdSe can reach 720 nm, but the driving force of electron injection from CdSe to ZnO or TiO2 is below that of CdS.8 One promising strategy to improve the performance of CdS or CdSe QDSSCs is to construct the CdS–CdSe composite so as to combine their both advantages. The composite QDs based on CdS and CdSe mainly have the core–shell and the alloy structures, which have been the hotspots in the field of QD cells. The use of alloyed QDs has been emerging as a promising approach to tailor the optical and electronic properties of sensitizers. The optical band gap and the associated band edge position can be feasibly tuned by changing the composition of alloyed QDs. The band-gap (Eg) of the CdSxSe1−x alloy can be tuned over a wide range of 1.75 < Eg < 2.45 eV. In a study by Song et al., colloidal CdSxSe1−x QDs were assembled within mesoporous TiO2 films by a one-step hydrothermal method. The composition and Eg of the CdSxSe1−x QDs were controlled by tuning the precursor ratio (Se/Na2S), while maintaining the similar particle size.9 Andrés et al. prepared CdS1−xSex sensitized TiO2 nanotubes by SILAR. They discussed how excessive Cd addition caused the structural disorder and the defect level that had a great impact on the PCE of QDSSCs, and how Cd–Cd defect energy levels acting as recombination centers limited the electron flow at the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface.10 Similarly, a series of CdS1−xSex QD-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 films were synthesized using a hydrothermal anion exchange reaction method by Deng.11 The composition stoichiometry was controlled by simply tuning the temperature and time duration, while maintaining a similar morphology and crystal structure. Likewise, the introduction of a Mn-doped CdSe (CdMnSe) layer as an outer QD on the ternary CdSe0.2S0.8 QD surface can enhance the PCE of the CdSexS1−x alloy QDSSCs. A cascade band structure and midgap states are favorable for electron injection and hole transport.12
In addition, CdS/CdSe core–shell QDs exhibit a wide light absorption band and a strong absorption intensity, and their special photo-electronic feature favors the separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons and the improvement of charge carrier lifetime. In TiO2/CdS/CdSe core–shell electrodes, the CdS layer facilitates the electron injection from CdSe to TiO2 by the reorganization of band levels between CdS and CdSe. In order to further clarify and get a deep understanding of the effect of the CdS buffer layer on the performance of QDSSCs, the optimization of the CdS/CdSe core–shell structure has been investigated extensively. Palomares et al. reported that the best cell efficiency for the CdS/CdSe core–shell sensitized TiO2 electrode consisted of 6 SILAR cycles of CdS and 8 SILAR cycles of CdSe.13 Similarly, Lee et al. found that 3 SILAR cycles of CdS plus 4 SILAR cycles of CdSe exhibited the best efficiency.14 Dai et al. discovered that the increase of CdS cycles enhanced the short circuit current density.15 Electrons could not be efficiently transferred when the cycles of CdS were less than 4. However, if the CdS cycle number was higher than 4 it could induce a suitable energy level alignment between CdS and CdSe.16 It was discovered by Li et al. that the optimal numbers of SILAR cycles were 9 layers for CdS and 6 layers for CdSe in CdS/CdSe/TiO2 QDSSCs prepared with SILAR.17 All these experimental findings imply that the TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode is more efficient in terms of reducing the electron recombination, and that the optimization of the cycle number of the CdS buffer layer is vital to the performances of cells. In addition, there are many research studies on further improvement of the cell performance by inserting interlayers. For example, a CdSxSe1−x interlayer was introduced into TiO2/CdS/CdSe heterostructures, forming a TiO2/CdS/CdS0.5Se0.5/CdSe ladder band structure. The band-alignment matching at the CdS/CdS0.5Se0.5/CdSe interfaces facilitated the seperation of electron–hole pairs and also extended the absorption range.18 Zhou et al. also reported the CdS/CdSxSe1−x/CdSe structure, and the same result was obtained.19 In another study, a ZnS/SiO2 coating served as the passivation layer for ZnTiO/CdS/CdSe QDSSCs, which caused the suppression of charge recombination and superior surface quality.20 A Mn-doped ZnSe passivated TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode enhanced the light adsorption, strongly inhibited the interfacial recombination, and increased the charge collection efficiency.21 The effective electron lifetime of the device through passivation led to more efficient electron–hole separation and slower electron recombination.
At present, some comparisons of the performances between the single phase QD (CdS or CdSe) QDSSCs and the composite QD (CdS/CdSe core/shell or CdSSe alloy) QDSSCs have been made in the above-mentioned literature. However, as far as we know, there is limited comparative investigation between the CdSSe alloy QDSSCs and the CdS/CdSe core–shell QDSSCs. Sisman et al. prepared cascade CdS/CdSe and CdS1−xSex alloy QDSSCs based on bundle-like ZnO nanorod arrays by SILAR.22 The spectral results showed that the absorption edge for CdS1−xSex was shorter than that of CdS/CdSe when their SILAR cycle numbers were the same. The test results showed that the performance of CdS1−xSex alloy QDSSCs was superior to that of CdS/CdSe core–shell QDSSCs. However, the difference in performance was not very significant. Hossain et al. prepared a homogeneous mixture of CdSxSe1−x and cascaded CdS/CdSe on TiO2 electrodes by SILAR, and found that the PCEs of CdS/CdSe and Cd0.9S0.42Se0.58 QDSSCs reached 4.12% and 4.05%, respectively, which were based on different SILAR cycle numbers.23
In this work, we focus on the performance investigation of CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core–shell QDSSCs prepared with the same preparation process. Using a modified SILAR method, the CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core/shell structure, along with a transition-state structure (here, we called it the CdS/CdSe multilayer structure), were prepared by simply changing the cycle numbers and arrangement sequence of CdS and CdSe. The results show that the CdS/CdSe core/shell QDSSCs are obviously superior to CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe multilayer QDSSCs. The QDSSCs based on the CdS/CdSe core/shell exhibited a PCE of 5.08% (Jsc = 21.31 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.464 mV), which is higher than that based on the CdSSe alloy structure (Jsc = 13.41 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.424 mV, PCE = 2.87%). The significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance of the CdS/CdSe core/shell QDSSCs mainly arises from the enhanced absorption intensity, the attenuation of the interfacial charge recombination rate, and the long electron lifetime.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Design of CdS–CdSe composite QDs
The in situ deposition of CdS–CdSe composite QDs on TiO2 films was achieved by the SILAR method. To deposit CdS QDs, TiO2 films were respectively immersed in 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 solution and 0.1 M Na2S solution for 1 minute, followed by sequential rinsing with deionized-water/methanol and drying by using an air gun. To deposit CdSe QDs, the same SILAR method was used. A 0.1 M Na2S solution in the deposition of CdS was replaced with a 0.1 M Na2SeSO3 solution as the Se2− source. The Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was prepared by refluxing the Se powder (0.1 M) in Na2SO3 aqueous solution (0.25 M) at 98 °C for 10 h in air. The deposition of CdS and CdSe was carried out at 25 °C and 50 °C, respectively.

Fig. 1 schematically shows the deposition process of the CdS–CdSe composite QDs. The deposition is realized by SILAR, which is a layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. One LbL cycle consists of the successive deposition of CdS and CdSe. In this paper, four samples were designed, including CdS(1)/CdSe(1)-16, CdS(4)/CdSe(4)-4, CdS(8)/CdSe(8)-2 and CdS(16)/CdSe(16)-1. For CdS(x)/CdSe(x)-n, x represents the continuous SILAR cycle number of CdS or CdSe, and n is the LbL cycle number. The total SILAR cycle number of CdS and CdSe is 32, and every sample has the same total SILAR cycle number. The procedure for depositing CdS and CdSe was alternately repeated to get a homogeneous CdSSe alloy according to the literature.10,22,23 As will be disclosed later, when n = 16, CdS(1)/CdSe(1)-16 is actually the CdSSe alloy; when n = 1, CdS(16)/CdSe(16)-1 forms a CdS/CdSe core–shell structure; when n = 4 or 2, CdS(4)/CdSe(4)-4 or CdS(8)/CdSe(8)-2 is a transition-state structure (or CdS/CdSe multilayer structure). Thus, by tuning the LbL number and SILAR cycle number (x increases from 1 to 16, and n decreases from 16 to 1), the QD structure evolves from the CdSSe alloy structure to a CdS/CdSe multilayer structure, and to the final CdS/CdSe core–shell structure. Thus, for convenience, the CdS(x)/CdSe(x)-n (n = 16, 4, 2, 1) is abbreviated as CdS/CdSe-n (n = 16, 4, 2, 1).

2.2 Preparation of the Co2NiS4 counter electrode and solar cell
The NiCo2S4 counter electrode (CE) was prepared according to the literature.24 Briefly, 4 mmol CoCl2, 2 mmol NiCl2 and 12 mmol urea were dissolved in 35 mL deionized water and stirred to form a homogeneous pink solution. Afterwards, porous Ti sheets were immersed in the solution and kept at 120 °C for 10 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the porous Ti sheets with a pink product were washed with deionized water. In the next step, the pink product, namely, the (Ni,Co)2(CO3)(OH)2 nanorodes, was transformed into NiCo2S4 nanotubes by a hydrothermal process in 0.1 M Na2S solution at 120 °C for 10 h. The QDSSCs were assembled using a 90 μm-thick scotch tape spacer by sandwiching the photoanodes (0.25 cm2 active areas) and CE. A redox electrolyte was composed of 1 M Na2S, 1 M S and 0.2 M KCl in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (5/5, v/v).
2.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffraction spectrometer (Cu Kα radiation), which was operated at a scan rate of 2° min−1 and a step of 0.02°. The morphologies and structures of the samples were analyzed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800) with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-ARM200F, JEOL) coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The composition and chemical state of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo K-alpha). The optical absorption spectra were measured with a Jasco V-570 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using the 375 nm line from a Xe lamp as the excitation source. The current–voltage (I–V) curves were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under an AM 1.5G solar simulator. For open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements, the QDSSCs were illuminated until a steady voltage was achieved, and then the OCVD measurement was carried out in the dark. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured using a lock-in amplifier (SolarCellScan 100, Zolix, China) with a light source (150 W, Xe lamp). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was realized using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua, Shanghai) under dark conditions with a forward bias of −0.45 V. The frequency range was set from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a 10 mV AC signal.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure characteristics of the photoanodes
To observe the morphology of the samples, the FE-SEM of the as-prepared TiO2 and TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n films was performed, as shown in Fig. 2. It is observed that the TiO2 film has a thickness of about 18.5 μm (Fig. 2a) and a highly porous nanostructure (Fig. 2b). Such a mesoporous structure is favorable for the penetration of the CdS and CdSe precursor solutions. Deposition of CdS–CdSe composite QDs makes the pores be partially filled. Moreover, the TiO2 particles with a uniform size in TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n films become larger in comparison with the ones in the pure TiO2 film. In addition to these, no significant differences in the internal morphology are observed among four types of TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n films. This implies that when the SILAR cycle numbers of CdS and CdSe are respectively not changed, the deposition modes of QDs with multilayer structures do not significantly change the morphology of the QDs. The crystallite size for CdS/CdSe-n was calculated by using the Scherrer formula according to the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4b. Furthermore, during the experiments we found that it was difficult to directly deposit CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2 by SILAR with a Na2SeSO3 solution, so the first layer of CdS would be the inducing layer of CdSe. In addition, EDX analysis was employed to test the element distribution of the cross-section of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n film. The EDX spectrum in Fig. 3a shows that Zn, Cd, S, Se, O and Ti elements are detected. The corresponding EDX mappings in Fig. 3b–e reveal that Zn, Cd, S and Se elements are distributed homogeneously throughout the TiO2/CdS/CdSe-1 film.

To analyze the structural formation of the CdS/CdSe-n QDs, the phase composition of the QDs needs to be investigated. Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n films deposited on the FTO substrates. XRD peaks of SnO2 phases and rutile and anatase TiO2 phases are observed. Generally, the diffraction peaks located at around 43.96° and 42.01° are the (220) plane of cubic CdS (JCPDS no. 10-0454) and cubic CdSe (JCPDS no. 19-0191). From Fig. 4b, it can be seen that a wide diffraction peak is located between 43.96° and 42.01° for CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4. This indicates that the composite QDs formed with CdS and CdSe deposited for the 1–4 SILAR cycles are the CdSSe alloy or solid solution other than the CdS/CdSe core–shell. When the consecutive SILAR cycles of CdS and CdSe increase to 8 times, the wide diffraction peak between 43.96° and 42.01° splits into two separate peaks, which correspond to the peak of the (220) plane of cubic CdSe at 42.01° and the (220) plane of cubic CdS at 43.96°, respectively. When the consecutive SILAR cycles are repeated 16 times, the CdS/CdSe core/shell structure forms. For CdS/CdSe-1 films, the diffraction peaks of CdSe at 42.01° and CdS at 43.96° are more distinct. In addition, a weak diffraction peak is observed at 54.58° for CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4 in Fig. 4c, and is attributed to the (222) plane of cubic CdS (JCPDS no. 10-0454). Moreover, the peak intensity increases with the consecutive SILAR cycle number. The diffraction peak (222) of CdS at 54.58° is observed in both samples, indicating the significant CdS component in the CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4 samples. This is consistent with the result disclosed by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (FHTEM) of CdS/CdSe-16 (Fig. 5c), in which the lattice distances of CdS/CdSe-16 are close to the lattice distances of CdS. The main reason is that the formation rate of the CdS synthesized using a Na2S solution is faster than that when the Na2SeSO3 solution is used. Therefore, the amount of CdS deposited by a SILAR cycle is larger than that of CdSe. When the consecutive SILAR cycles of CdS or CdSe are less than 4 times, the composition of the CdSSe alloy tends to be CdS. In addition, when the consecutive SILAR cycles increase to 8 and 16 times, the significant enhancement of the peak intensity is due to the increased thickness of CdS. These results further confirm the development of composite QDs from the CdSSe alloy to CdS/CdSe core/shell by this modified SILAR. In addition, the size of the crystallite of CdS/CdSe-n is determined by using the Scherrer formula. D = (0.9 × λ)/(β × cosθ)(1)where λ is the X-ray wavelength (λ = 0.15418 nm), β is the full-width at a half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, and θ is Bragg's angle (here, θ = 21.19° is chosen). According to the Scherrer formula, based on the same λ and β parameters, the crystallite size (D) is inversely proportional to FWHM (β). It can be calculated according to Fig. 4b that the CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4 samples have the same FWHM values and the FWHM of the CdS/CdSe-1 sample is the largest one. Therefore, the D value for CdS/CdSe-n follows the order of CdS/CdSe-16 ≈ CdS/CdSe-4 > CdS/CdSe-2 > CdS/CdSe-1.

The detailed structure and morphology of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n nanostructure were further investigated by TEM. The low magnification TEM images (Fig. 5a and b) show the distribution of the CdS/CdSe-n shell on the TiO2 core. It can be found that the surface of the TiO2 particles is covered fully by fine QD crystallites, demonstrating a high coverage of the surface of the TiO2 film synthesized by SILAR. As displayed in the inset of Fig. 5b, the SAED pattern shows several clear diffraction rings, demonstrating the polycrystalline characteristics of the as-prepared CdS/CdSe-n QDs. The detailed information of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe-16 and TiO2/CdS/CdSe-1 nanostructures is revealed by the HRTEM images, as shown in Fig. 5c–e. We carefully measured the lattice parameters and made a comparison with the JCPD data (CdS: 10-0454, CdSe: 19-0191). In Fig. 5c, the lattice spacing of the CdS/CdSe-16 crystallites was found to be 0.34 nm, which is between the lattice distances of the CdSe (111) plane (0.351 nm) and CdS (111) plane (0.336 nm). Meanwhile, the lattice spacings of 0.206 nm and 0.31 nm are observed in Fig. 5c. The spacing of 0.206 nm is between the lattice parameters of the CdS (220) plane (0.2058 nm) and CdSe (220) plane (0.2149 nm). Similarly, the spacing of 0.31 nm is close to the lattice distance of the CdS (200) plane (0.29 nm). Therefore, it is reasonably deduced that the alloy structure of the as-prepared CdS/CdSe-16 is more close to that of CdS.
In theory, the TiO2/CdS/CdSe-1 sample should be a CdS/CdSe double shell coated on TiO2. Due to the polycrystalline structure and poor crystallinity of the QDs deposited by the SILAR method, it is difficult to find the interface of CdS/CdSe and distinguish the CdS/CdSe core–shell structure from HRTEM. However, it is an effective strategy to use the TiO2/CdS interface (Fig. 5d) and sample surface (CdSe/vacuum interface in Fig. 5e) to indirectly confirm the formation of the CdS/CdSe core–shell structure. Fig. 5d shows that the lattice spacings of the crystallite adjacent to the TiO2 are about 0.336, 0.31 and 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of cubic CdS (JCPDS no. 10-0454), respectively. Besides, the dark yellow appearance of the samples prepared by depositing CdS for 16 cycles indicates the formation of CdS. Fig. 5e shows that the lattice spacings of the sample surface are about 0.353, 0.354 and 0.35 nm, which are close to 0.351 nm corresponding to the (111) crystal planes of cubic CdSe (JCPDS no. 19-0191). These results indirectly suggest the CdS/CdSe core–shell structure, but it is difficult to test the actual thickness of CdS and CdSe, respectively.
The surface valence states of the as-synthesized CdS–CdSe composite QDs were further determined by XPS analysis. As expected, the typical survey XPS spectrum confirms the presence of O, Cd, Se, S and Zn elements in the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode, as shown in Fig. 6a. Because the composite QDs tightly cover the TiO2 nanoparticles and the analysis depth of the XPS technique is less than 5 nm, there is a much weak Ti signal. To further determine the chemical states of the Cd, S, Se and Zn elements, the high-resolution XPS spectra were recorded, as shown in Fig. 6b, c, d and e, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 6b, two peaks corresponding to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 respectively at the binding energies (BE) of 404.95 eV and 411.7 eV are observed, indicating a doublet structure due to the spin orbit splitting.25,26 This indicates the presence of Cd2+ species in the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6c, the S 2p peak can be fitted into four peaks. The spin–orbit doublet of the S 2p level splits into 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. The BE of the S 2p3/2 peak can be divided into two peaks centered at 160.1 eV and 161.3 eV, and the BE of the S 2p1/2 peak is centered at 162.5 eV,27,28 indicating the presence of CdS. Another peak centered at a BE of 165.8 eV corresponds to sulfur in S–O bonding from the adsorbed SO32−. As shown in Fig. 6d, the Se 3d peak can be fitted into two peaks. The spin–orbit doublet of the Se 3d level splits into 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. The BE of the Se 3d5/2 peak can be divided into two peaks centered at 53.6 eV and 54.5 eV for Cd–Se bonding. The Zn 2p spectrum exhibits the peaks of 2p1/2 at 1044.8 eV and 2p3/2 at 1021.8 eV (Fig. 6e), indicating the presence of covalent zinc in the present ZnS products.

3.2 Optical characteristics and photovoltaic performance of cells
To evaluate the influence of the structure of the CdS–CdSe composite QDs on the optical properties of the QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes, the UV-vis absorption spectra of different photoelectrodes were measured, and are shown in Fig. 7a. Apparently, the absorption spectra show a strong dependence on the structure of the CdS–CdSe composite QDs. The absorption intensity follows the order of CdS/CdSe-16 < CdS/CdSe-4 < CdS/CdSe-2 < CdS/CdSe-1 in the wavelength range from 400 to 625 nm. That is to say, as the structure of QDs develops from the CdSSe alloy (CdS/CdSe-16) to a CdS/CdSe multilayer structure (CdS/CdSe-4, -2), and to the final CdS/CdSe core–shell structure (CdS/CdSe-1), the absorption intensity of light injected into the photoanodes steadily increases. This implies that the QDs with a core–shell structure have stronger light absorption than those with a alloy structure. Generally, the Eg value of the CdSSe alloy QDs is between the CdS and CdSe QDs when their deposition process or their QD sizes are the same, and the absorption edge follows the order of CdSe > CdSSe > CdS. The absorption edge of the CdS/CdSe core–shell QDs depends on the CdSe QDs with a narrower band gap. XRD results also prove that the CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4 QDs tend to be alloy structures, and the CdS/CdSe-2 and CdS/CdSe-1 QDs tend to be core–shell structures. Therefore, compared with CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4, the absorption spectra of CdS/CdSe-2 and CdS/CdSe-1 show an obvious red-shift. When CdS and CdSe are respectively deposited by 16 SILAR cycles (x = 16), the thickness of the CdSe layer in CdS/CdSe-1 is larger than that in CdS/CdSe-2, so CdS/CdSe-1 also has a slight red-shift compared with CdS/CdSe-2. For the same reason, CdS/CdSe-4 also has a slight red-shift compared with CdS/CdSe-16. In addition, the absorption spectrum of each sample shows a wide peak at about 410 nm. This is due to the interference effect of the compact TiO2 layer. For the CdS/CdSe-16 and CdS/CdSe-4 samples, the emergence of one broad absorption shoulder at 500 nm is observed, owing to the formation of a ternary alloy CdS1−xSex QD compound.29
 Fig. 7  (a) and (b) show the UV-Vis absorption spectra and steady-state PL spectra of TiO2/CdS/CdSe-n, respectively. (c) and (d) show the J–V and IPCE curves of the corresponding solar cells, respectively. 
In general, steady-state PL signals result from the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers, which is closely related to the charge transfer process of excited electrons and the photovoltaic activity of cells. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded to study the photoexcited electron–hole recombination rates of the as-synthesized QDs and the charge transfer process of excited electrons from the QDs to TiO2, as shown in Fig. 7b. The excitation wavelength is 375 nm. Two emission peaks are found at about 540 and 700 nm. The emission peak at around 540 nm is due to the band edge emission of the CdS–CdSe composite QDs. With the development of the composite QDs from the CdSSe alloy to CdS/CdSe core–shell (with the decrease of n from 16 to 1), this peak intensity strengthens, but its position does not obviously shift. The high PL emission value is favorable for the generation of more excitons (electrons and holes), thus increasing the recombination rate of the electrons and holes and leading to the emission of a larger number of photons. However, in the QDSSCs, the electrons are mainly transferred to electrodes instead of recombination with holes. So the high PL intensity would improve the high charge density in the QDSSCs.21,30 The variation trend of the intensity indicates that the CdS/CdSe core–shell QDs can generate more photogenerated electrons in the conduction band, which is due to their stronger light absorption. In addition, all the samples exhibit a strong broad band emission centered around 700 nm, which may originate from the deep level defects of the F:SnO2/SiO2 substrate, because a significant peak is also observed in the FTO/TiO2 film.11 However, in some literature studies, this peak is defined as the emissions peak of CdS1−xSex or CdSe, so we believe that the weak emission peak of CdS1−xSex or CdSe is probably overlapped by the emission peak of the F:SnO2/SiO2 substrate due to its close peak position at about 700 nm in our test results.
To estimate the effect of the QD structure on the photovoltaic performance, QDSSCs based on various CdS/CdSe-n composite QDs were fabricated using the same CEs of NiCo2S4. Fig. 7c shows the J–V curves of the champion QDSSCs based on CdS/CdSe-n QDs, and their corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The changing trends of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are clearly observed in Table 1. It shows that the four types of cells have very similar FF values (about 50%). The PCE increases with the development of QDs from the CdSSe alloy (CdS/CdSe-16) to CdS/CdSe core/shell (CdS/CdSe-1) QDs, which mainly originates from the increase of Voc and Jsc. Particularly, the Jsc value significantly increases with the development of QDs from the CdSSe alloy to CdS/CdSe core–shell. The highest Jsc value of 21.31 mA cm−2 is achieved for the CdS/CdSe core/shell QDSSC (n = 1), and is increased by 58.84% in comparison with that of the CdSSe alloy QDSSC (n = 16). As CdSSe alloy QDs develop into CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs, not only the light absorption range of the photoanode is slightly broadened, but also the absorption intensity significantly increases. This directly leads to more excited electrons generated during illumination, thus contributing to the enhancement of photocurrent. Furthermore, the QDSSCs based on the CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs show a Voc value which is slightly higher than that of the CdSSe alloy QDSSCs. A detailed explanation is given as follows: the Voc value in QDSSCs corresponds to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor Efn with respect to the electrolyte redox energy (Eredox). Therefore, it can be written as:31 Voc = (Efn − Eredox)/e = (kBT/e)ln(n/n0)(2)where kB, T, e and n0 are the Boltzmann constant, the thermodynamic temperature, the positive elementary charge and the electron concentration in the dark, respectively. The enhanced light absorption of the CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs helps to produce more photons under the same testing conditions compared with CdSSe alloy QDs, which are transferred to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The improvement of the electron concentration (n) in the CB of TiO2 induces the upshift of the Fermi level, increasing the Voc value. The best solar cell yields a PCE of 5.08% for the CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs, which is increased by 77% in comparison with that of the CdSSe alloy QDSSCs. The average values of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of the five best cells are given in Table 1. The variation trends of the average values are consistent with the champion cells.

In order to get a better understanding of electron collection in the QDSSCs, the IPCEs of the best solar cells with different composite QDs are shown in Fig. 7d. The IPCE is a direct measure of the photocurrent, which represents the percentage of incident photons that are converted to electrons at a certain wavelength and collected at the electrode surface. The IPCE spectra exhibit photoresponses paralleling to the absorption onsets in Fig. 7a. With the decrease of n (LbL cycle number) from 16 to 1, a red-shift is observed in the photocurrent response in the range from 600 to 700 nm. In the wavelength range of 400–600 nm, the change trend of the IPCE is consistent with the results of the absorption spectrum with the structural development of QDs. The CdS/CdSe-1 and CdS/CdSe-16 QDSSCs show the highest IPCE and the lowest IPCE, respectively, which are between 70–80% and 40–60%, respectively. Furthermore, when the QD structure evolves from the CdSSe alloy to CdS/CdSe core/shell structure, it is interesting to see a blue-shift in the photocurrent response at wavelengths below 400 nm. This may be because CdS in the CdS/CdSe-n structure is more conducive to the photoelectric conversion of the ultraviolet spectrum. The larger the size of CdS is, the stronger the conversion of ultraviolet will be. In our previous studies, it can be found that the CdS QDSSCs have a higher IPCE as compared to the CdS1−xSex alloy QDSSCs in the range of 350–400 nm.
3.3 Charge carrier transport characteristics
OCVD is attractive in the measurement of the electron lifetime (τn), which can effectively reflect the charge recombination rate in cells. Fig. 8a shows the representative OCVD curves of the QDSSCs based on different CdS–CdSe composite QDs. Clearly, the Voc value of the cell based on CdS/CdSe-16 QDs decays to 0 V in less than 20 s after the light is turned off. Differently, the Voc values of cells based on CdS/CdSe-4, CdS/CdSe-2 and CdS/CdSe-1 QDs decay to about 0.8, 0.15 and 0.2 V in less than 20 s, respectively. In the next 20 s, the Voc value of the three CdS/CdSe-n (n = 4, 2, 1) cells decays slowly, especially for the CdS/CdSe-1 QDs cell. Obviously, the Voc decay rates of these cells follow the order of CdS/CdSe-1 > CdS/CdSe-2 > CdS/CdSe-4 > CdS/CdSe-16.

There is a direct connection between τn and OCVD, because excess photogenerated electrons in the QDSSCs are removed through recombination under an open circuit. The τn value of QDSSCs at different voltages can be calculated according to the formula (3):32 τn = −(kBT/e)(dV/dt)−1(3)where kB, T and e are the Boltzmann constant, the thermodynamic temperature and the electronic charge, respectively. Fig. 8b illustrates the τn values of the QDSSCs as a function of voltage. The τn value of every cell increases with the decrease of the voltage. But for all the cells, their τn values are almost the same near the initial Voc (dashed box). The τn value follows the order of CdS/CdSe-1 > CdS/CdSe-2 > CdS/CdSe-4 > CdS/CdSe-16. At the same voltage below 0.4 V. short τn is most likely the origin of the Voc deficit due to fast non-radiative recombination pathways.33
To further understand the resistance distribution, charge-transfer kinetics and charge recombination in QDSSCs, and EIS characterization was performed on these QDSSCs, as shown in Fig. 8c. It can be seen that every Nyquist plot shows an evident semicircle. Generally, the semi-circle of the Nyquist plot in the middle-frequency region corresponds to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the photoanode/QDs/electrolyte interface layer. A larger radius corresponds to a higher Rrec, which is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, thus resulting in a higher photovoltage. Therefore, Rrec follows the order of CdS/CdSe-1 > CdS/CdSe-2 > CdS/CdSe-4 > CdS/CdSe-16. The corresponding Bode phase plots for the QDSSCs based on the CdS/CdSe-16, CdS/CdSe-4, CdS/CdSe-2 and CdS/CdSe-1 QDs are shown in Fig. 8d. The mid-frequency peak is due to the process of charge transfer at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces. The τn value for the photoanodes can be calculated by using the formula (4):22 τn = 1/(2fmax)(4)where fmax is the mid-peak frequency (about 1 K to 10 Hz) of the bode phase plots in the impedance spectra. According to the formula, τn is inversely proportional to fmin. In the case of all QDSSCs, the shift of the mid-frequency peaks towards lower frequency when the structure of the QDs evolves from the CdS/CdSe-16 alloy through a CdS/CdSe-2, 4 multilayer to the CdS/CdSe-1 core/shell indicates the increase of the τn value in the devices. This trend of τn is consistent with that from the OCVD curves. The OCVD and EIS results imply that the CdS/CdSe-1 core/shell has better electronic transmission capability than the CdSSe alloy.
4. Conclusions
At present, there are a few comparative investigations of the cell performance between CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core/shell structures. In this work, we performed a detailed investigation on the performance of CdSSe alloy and CdS/CdSe core/shell QDSSCs obtained using the same preparation process. To realize this, a series of QDs were successfully prepared by a modified SILAR method and LbL technique. Four structures of QDs were designed including CdS(1)/CdSe(1)-16, CdS(4)/CdSe(4)-4, CdS(8)/CdSe(8)-2 and CdS(16)/CdSe(16)-1. Material characterization tests show that when the SILAR cycle number decreases from 16 to 1, the QD structure evolves from the CdSSe alloy to a CdS/CdSe multilayer structure, and to a final CdS/CdSe core/shell structure. In addition, the absorption edge experiences a slight red-shift and the absorption intensity is obviously enhanced. That is, the QDs with a core/shell structure have stronger light absorption than alloyed QDs. The assembled QDSSCs based on the CdS/CdSe core/shell yield a maximum PCE of 5.08% under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is increased by 77% in comparison with that of the CdSSe alloy QDSSCs (2.87%). The significantly enhanced PCE was attributed to high Jsc, arising from a strong light harvesting of core/shell architectures. In addition, electrochemical tests show that the CdS/CdSe core–shell contributes to the attenuation of the interfacial charge recombination rate and prolongs the electron lifetime, resulting in more efficient charge collection in QDSSCs.
