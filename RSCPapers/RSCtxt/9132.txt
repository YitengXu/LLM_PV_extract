    , Accepted 24th March 2022First published on 24th March 2022AbstractSeawater electrolysis is an attractive approach for combating climate change without burdening drinking water resources. A robust electrocatalyst is required that can withstand Cl corrosion and provide excellent catalytic activity for the water splitting half-cell reactions. Here, we propose an approach for multiplying the front-line surface-active sites of a multimetallic transition metal sulfide-based electrocatalyst by depositing a monolayer amount of metal oxide. This effectively increases the number of water molecules that can dissociate per given geometrical electrode area, leading to accelerated interface kinetics. Specifically, NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4 hollow cuboids have been prepared through a multistep hydrothermal route and then coated with a monolayer amount of NiO by atomic layer deposition. A symmetrical alkaline seawater electrolyzer consisting of two bifunctional NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO electrodes delivers a current density of 430 mA cm−2 without exceeding the hypochlorite formation threshold of 1.72 V. The in situ transformation of the oxide surface groups to oxyhydroxide groups provides good catalyst durability, requiring an overvoltage increase of only 103 mV at 1000 mA cm−2 after 30 days of continuous electrolysis of seawater under industrially favored conditions.
1. Introduction
Owing to technological and industrial expansion over the last century, the environment has undergone damage to the point of no return.1–4 In the last few decades, several countries have acknowledged that our ecosystem is deteriorating faster than predicted and have agreed to reduce or reverse this damage.5,6 The main strategy is to reduce the use of non-renewable energy resources by adopting clean fuels.7 Hydrogen is one of the clean fuel alternatives as it possesses a high energy density (142 MJ kg−1) with zero carbon emissions.8,9
Hydrogen production via electrolysis has reached benchmark efficiencies through an extensive push for freshwater splitting. Large scale freshwater splitting, however, will burden drinking water resources.10–14 A desirable alternative is to directly electrolyze seawater in view of its abundance, with 151 out of 195 countries having unrestricted access to seawater.15 For a fully renewable process, the electrolyzer should be operated by electricity generated from other renewable sources, such as sunlight. Solar- and wind-driven seawater electrolyzers could be particularly beneficial in arid areas, as sunlight and wind flow are abundant and renewable.16
Seawater splitting has two major engineering challenges: selectivity between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and electrode corrosion in the presence of excess Cl ions.17–19 Alkaline water splitting is generally preferred, since neutral or acidic media have a low ionic conductivity or accelerate corrosion.20 However, the hydroxyl ions in alkaline water react with chloride ions at high potentials (>1.72 V) to form hypochlorite, which limits the operation window of alkaline seawater electrolyzers.21,22 Further, insoluble precipitates of magnesium and calcium hydroxides hinder the electrode activity by masking or poisoning the catalysts.
Attempts have been made to successfully alleviate the aforementioned issues through the use of various catalysts.23–28 Recently, our group has achieved a subtle nano-roughened nanoshell architecture through a combination of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and anion exchange reaction with high electrochemical activity.29 The structures consisting of a NiCo2S4 thiospinel core covered with a NiS nanoshell with pronounced nanoroughness have achieved a durability of more than 10 days in an industrial high temperature seawater electrolyzer. Recently, Yu et al. achieved the alkaline water splitting of seawater at 25 °C temperature for more than 600 h of continuous operation. A mixed transition metal nitride catalyst was used at a higher current density of 100 mA cm−2 before the onset of hypochlorite formation.30 Kuang et al. proposed a metal sulfide (M–S) catalyst with a uniform coating of a nickel–iron hydroxide (NiFe) co-catalyst, which had extremely good corrosion resistance during solar-driven alkaline seawater electrolysis and could be operated at industrially required current densities over 1000 h.31
Transition metal sulfides have excellent electrical conductivity, good performance for water splitting half-cell reactions, and easy synthesizability.12,32–34 In this work, we use a NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4 multiple transition metal sulfide with a hollow cuboid heterostructural architecture to provide abundant nanointerfaces. A monolayer amount of NiO was deposited onto the catalyst surface by ALD to substantially increase the number of electroactive surface sites.35–37 This catalyst system was tested as a bi-functional electrode for seawater splitting. The current density was probed at an overpotential below the critical potential for hypochlorite formation, and the durability of the catalyst was investigated under industrially required harsh conditions. The suitability of the composite electrocatalyst for seawater splitting was tested over a period of 30 days under industrial conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4 (NCMS) electrocatalyst
A schematic representation of the NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO (NCMS/NiO) catalyst preparation process is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of synthesis of NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4 cuboids coated with ALD-NiO. 

2.1.1 Materials. 
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (≥97%, Sigma-Aldrich), urea (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium fluoride (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium molybdate (≥99.3%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfide nanohydrate (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), nickel cyclopentadienyl (≥99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Pt/C (10 wt% on carbon, Sigma Aldrich), RuO2 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), Nafion (5 wt% in mixture of low aliphatic alcohol and water, Sigma Aldrich), potassium hydroxide (>85%, Sigma Aldrich). All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification. Solutions were freshly prepared with deionized water.


2.1.2 Synthesis of NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanoneedles. 
NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanoneedles were synthesized on Ni foam (NF) by a hydrothermal method. A piece of Ni foam was ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and deionized (DI) water for several minutes and dried. The cleaned Ni foam (2 × 5 cm2, MTI Korea) was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave containing a precursor solution. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.388 g of cobalt nitrate, 0.3 g of nickel nitrate, 0.3 g of urea, and 0.062 g of ammonium fluoride in 40 mL of DI water. The hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 120 °C for 6 h. Finally, the obtained NCO on Ni foam was rinsed with DI water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C for further use.


2.1.3 Synthesis of NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 (NCMO) cuboids. 
NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 (NCMO) cuboids were synthesized on NCO by a hydrothermal method. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of ammonium molybdate and 0.465 g of nickel nitrate in 40 mL of DI water. The hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 150 °C for 6 h. Finally, the obtained NCMO on Ni foam was rinsed with DI water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C for further use.


2.1.4 Synthesis of NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4 (NCMS) cuboids. 
A wet sulfurization process was employed to drive the anion exchange reaction for converting NCMO into NCMS. Sodium sulfide was used as the S source. The sulfurization solution was prepared by mixing 2 g of sodium sulfide into 40 mL of DI water, followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 120 °C for 8 h. Finally, the obtained NCMS on Ni foam was rinsed with DI water and ethanol, and then vacuum dried at 60 °C for further use.

2.2 Synthesis of NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO (NCMS/NiO) cuboids
NiO thin films were deposited through a specially designed flow type ALD reactor maintained at 175 °C and 800 mTorr. Argon (99.995%) was used as both the carrier (50 sccm) and purging (250 sccm) gas. Nickel cyclopentadienyl (Ni(Cp)2) and ozone (5% in O2) were used as the nickel precursor and counter reactant, respectively. Each ALD cycle comprised four steps: a 1.5 s precursor pulse, followed by 30 s precursor purge, 3 s ozone pulse, and 60 s ozone purge.38,39 Prior to coating the nanostructures, the aforementioned ALD conditions were optimized using a flat substrate comprising single-crystalline p-type silica (100) (LG Siltron, Korea). The loading amount of surface NiO active sites over the NCMS substrate was controlled by changing the number of ALD cycles (20, 40, 80, 200, or 400).
2.3 Synthesis of RuO2 and Pt/C electrodes
Ten milligrams of Pt/C or RuO2 and 10 μL of Nafion were dispersed in 1 mL of a water/ethanol mixture solution (3:1) using ultra-sonication to prepare an ink. Finally, the catalyst ink was coated on the NF by drop casting followed by drying at 60 °C.
2.4 Characterization
The crystallinity of each sample was analyzed using high-resolution X-ray diffractometry (XRD; PANalytical) using a PIXcel3D detector and equipped with Cu Kα radiation at 60 kV and 55 mA. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Cu Kα radiation and seven Channeltron detectors was employed. The structural and morphological properties of the electrodes were studied using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM; JEOL JSM-7500F) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer (accelerating voltage of 15 kV), as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, TECNAI G2 F20).
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode system, wherein a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt coil were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The catalytic activity was tested in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 to minimize the capacitive current. The measured potentials versus SCE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernst equation: VRHE = VSCE +  + (0.05916 × pH), where VSCE is applied potential,  is 0.247 V and pH is ∼13.5. Electrolytes were not saturated with O2, N2, H2 or Ar gas prior to electrochemical analysis. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted in 1 M KOH at frequencies ranging from 10−2 to 10+6 Hz with AC amplitude of 10 mV. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by calculating the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) in the non-faradaic potential region. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s−1. Plotting the anodic and cathodic current density difference (ΔI = (Ia – Ic)/2) against the scan rate resulted in a slope of Cdl, where Cdl = d(ΔI)/dν. ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs represents the Cdl of ideally flat electrode taken as 0.04 mF cm−2 for alkaline electrolyte.40 Number of surface active sites (NA) were calculated using the integrated area of reduction peak obtained from the CV curves: C = U/v, where, C is charge capacity (A s), U is area of reduction peak (V A) and v is scan rate (V s−1). The reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ is a single electron transfer reaction, therefore the number of electrons transferred (N) is equal to the NA. N = C/q, where q = 1.602 × 10−19 C.29 Chronopotentiometry measurements were conducted in a two-electrode setup at a constant current density with frequent replacement of the electrolyte. The amount of gas evolution during electrolysis was analyzed by gas chromatography (074-594-P1E Micro GC Fusion, INFICON). The iR compensated LSV curves were obtained using the series resistance (Rs) from the impedance measurements: ViR-free = V – (Rs × I), where V and I are the applied potential and the measured current density. The mass loading of each electrode was obtained by subtracting the weight of the bare Ni foam (1 × 1 cm2) from its final weight. For example, mass of NCMS/NiO = weight of NF/NCMS/NiO – weight of NF.
2.6 Seawater electrolysis
For an evaluation of overall seawater splitting, an alkaline electrolyte was prepared using seawater collected at Gamami Beach, Jeollanam-do, South Korea. The electrocatalytic activity measurements were performed in electrolytes prepared with seawater containing 1 M and 5 M KOH, at 25 and 80 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and physical characterizations of NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO (NCMS/NiO) electrode
NCMO cuboids were formed by a hydrothermal method, whereby NiMoO4 cuboids were grown onto NCO nanoneedles that had been hydrothermally synthesized on Ni foam. The NCMO cuboids were then converted to NCMS via anion exchange during a wet sulfurization process. Finally, NiO was deposited onto the surface of the NCMS composite by ALD to produce the NCMS/NiO cuboid electrocatalyst.
XRD analysis was conducted to gain structural insights into the hetero-nanostructures. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the as-prepared NCO, NCMO, and NCMS samples. The XRD pattern of the as-prepared NCO sample contained major characteristic peaks at 2θ angles of 38.53°, 33.06°, and 59.34°, which correspond to the (311), (220), and (440) lattice planes of the NiCo2O4 spinel structure (JCPDS: 73-1702), respectively.41
 Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of NCO, NCMO, and NCMS electrodes. 
Diffraction peaks of the Ni foam substrate appeared in the XRD patterns of all samples (JCPDS: 04-0850). The XRD pattern of the NCMO sample had broad low-intensity peaks of NiMoO4 (JCPDS: 16-0291) and MoO3 (JCPDS: 01-0706) phases due to the lack of crystallinity. The peaks from the Ni foam had a lower intensity owing to the large mass loading of NCMO. The XRD pattern of the sulfurized NCMS sample displayed major peaks at 2θ angles of 31.18°, 37.80°, 49.73°, 55.21°, and 72.98°, which correspond to the (311), (400), (511), (440), and (444) lattice planes of the NiCo2S4 spinel structure (JCPDS: 43-1477), respectively. There were additional peaks at 29.58° and 50.17°, which are characteristic of the NiMo2S4 phase.42 However, the increased intensity of the diffraction peaks corresponding to the Ni foam originated from structural disintegration owing to the wet sulfurization process, which is expected as the smaller O2− ions (diameter ∼126 pm) were replaced with larger S2− ions (diameter ∼170 pm) in a unit cell.43 The XRD pattern of the final NCMS electrode contained an additional peak at 21.81°, corresponding to the (11) lattice plane of the Ni3S2 phase, which originated either from the Ni ions of the hetero-nanostructure or the Ni foam. The XRD pattern of the final NCMS/NiO electrode (not shown) contained no additional NiO peaks due to the amorphous and ultrathin nature of the NiO monolayer.
The electronic states of the elements and the interaction between the ALD-deposited NiO layer and the NCMS composite were examined by XPS. The survey spectra of all the electrodes are shown in Fig. S1.†Fig. 2(a) shows the high-resolution Ni 2p3/2 spectrum of NCMO. There are two main peaks at 855.97 and 857.36 eV, which can be assigned to the 2+ and 3+ states of NiMoO4. The high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 2(b) shows two main peaks at 232.57 and 235.73 eV, which can be assigned to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 spin orbitals, respectively. The Mo 3d5/2 peak was deconvoluted into two peaks at 232.52 and 233.30 eV, corresponding to the 4+ and 6+ states of the surface Mo species, respectively.44

The emergence of S 2s and S 2p peaks in Fig. 2(b) and 2(c), respectively, indicates successful sulfurization. The binding energies at 161.21 and 162.21 eV in Fig. 2(c) correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin orbitals, which can be attributed to the main metal–sulfur (M–S) bond.45 Additionally, the negative shift in the binding energies of the Ni 2p and Mo 3d peaks after sulfurization (of approximately 0.68 and 0.71 eV, respectively), confirms that the lattice oxygen atoms were replaced by sulfur atoms. For the as-prepared NCMS catalyst, the intensity of the S 2p peak became weaker after 40 cycles of ALD, because of the initial conversion of M–S sites to M–O (during exposure to the ozone pulse in the ALD cycle) and the subsequent deposition of the NiO layer. The metal sulfate/sulfite (M–SOx) peaks at 165.37–170.86 eV originate from surface oxidation on account of the air in the atmosphere (Fig. 2(c)). The disappearance of the Co 2p peak in Fig. 2(d) after the growth of NiMoO4, which is prominent in Fig. S2† for NCO, shows that the NCO nanoneedles are fully covered beneath the NiMoO4. Interestingly, the emergence of the Co signal after sulfurization helps to elucidate the sulfurization mechanism. The migration of Co atoms to the surface is due to the inward diffusion of S2− anions and outward diffusion of Mo4+/6+, Ni2+/3+, and Co2+/3+ cations during the sulfurization process.46,47 This forms a dense outer wall while leaving a low density or hollow core. The dual structures of NiCo2O4 and NiMoO4 become a single hollow structure of NCMS, as shown in Scheme S1.† According to the XRD results, the wall mainly comprises NiCo2S4 and NiMo2S4 phases.
There is a possibility that, during ALD-NiO deposition, the highly active ozone vapors react with the surface NCMS particles and convert them to metal oxides. This was indicated by the disappearance of the S 2s peak and reduction of the S 2p peak intensity in the ALD coated samples, suggesting that the deposited NiO layer is in electronic equilibrium with NCMS, which creates several nanointerfaces. The partial oxidation of the surface NCMS particles and the electronic interaction between the NCMS cuboid and NiO shell layer result in a positive shift of the Co 2p (∼0.64 eV) and Mo 3d (∼0.97 eV) binding energies compared to those in the NCMS spectra.38,48 Compared with the NCMO spectra, the Ni 2p spectrum was negatively shifted by 0.33 eV, while the Mo 3d spectrum was positively shifted by 0.26 eV, owing to the electron sharing between the Ni 2p and Mo 3d orbitals at the interface. The overall composition of all samples is given in Table S1.†
The structural changes associated with sulfurization and NiO deposition were analyzed through high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Fig. S3(a–c)† shows that the as-prepared NCO sample has a “sea urchin” structure with a high density of nanoneedles connected to the nucleation site on the Ni foam. The NMO formed over the as-synthesized NCO nanoneedles possesses a cuboid structure with a width greater than that of the NCO nanoneedles (Fig. S3(d–f)†). The formation of NCMS through the wet sulfurization process brings about a major morphological change, whereby a single NCMS cuboid structure is formed from the NCO nanoneedles and NMO cuboids (Fig. 3(a)). The surfaces of these newly formed cuboids are rougher than those of the NCMO precursor, which suggests the enrichment of surface-active sites by sulfurization (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). The difference in unit cell volume between the metal oxide (M–O) and metal sulfide (M–S) structure meant that several randomly oriented crystals were created within the NCMS wall.

(h–k) HR-TEM images of NCMS/NiO (400 cycles). (l–q) Elemental mapping of NCMS/NiO (40 cycles). High magnification images of (r) NCMS and (s) NCMS/NiO (40 cycles). 
The sulfurization duration is crucial in forming the hollow structure, since a lower sulfurization time (<8 h) leads to thicker walls, which restricts electrolyte diffusion; whereas a longer duration leads to the detachment of nanoparticles from the wall surface (Fig. S3(g–i)†).46 The HR-TEM images in Fig. 3(d) and (e) show the hollow nature of the NCMS cuboids, with cuboid and wall thicknesses of 350 nm and ∼15 nm, respectively. The wall was porous with multiple NiCo2S4 and NiMo2S4 crystals with different orientations. This structure should facilitate electrolyte diffusion to the inner side of the cuboids. The higher magnification image of the wall in Fig. 3(f) further indicates NiCo2S4 crystals with a d-spacing of 0.33 and 0.28 nm, which correspond to the (220) and (311) planes.49,50 The presence of the (10) lattice plane of the Ni3S2 phase further validates the XRD results.51
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern observed within the red square in Fig. 3(g) shows the polycrystalline nature of the NiCo2S4 phase, owing to the formation of concentric circles with bright spots. The major planes identified from the XRD analysis, including the (311), (400), and (511) planes, are indexed in the SAED pattern. Fig. 3(h) shows the ultra-thin NiO shell layer and the NiMo2S4 crystal, which has a d-spacing of 0.17 nm.42 The blue square in Fig. 3(i) defines the (111) plane of cubic NiCo2S4 with d-spacing of 0.54 nm, and the atom arrangements are drawn according to the (111) plane structure.52 This confirms the coexistence of NiCo2S4 and NiMo2S4 with close contact in the cuboid wall. Fig. 3(j) and (k) show the conformal coating of the NiO shell layer over the three-dimensional NCMS wall after 400 ALD cycles. The NiO layer has a uniform thickness of 2 nm. Furthermore, the scanning TEM-EDS images, as shown in Fig. 3(l–q), demonstrate that there were homogeneous distributions of S, O, Ni, Mo, and Co. These results confirm the construction of a hollow NCMS/NiO core–shell structure with high crystallinity and excellent interface properties.
As discussed in Section 3.2, the NiO layer formed by 40 cycles of ALD is found to be most effective for seawater splitting. Considering that 400 cycles of ALD yields a NiO overlayer of 2 nm, the thickness reached after 40 cycles of ALD should be 0.2 nm, which is approximately the size of one molecule of NiO. The HR-TEM images of the NCMS and NCMS/NiO samples are shown in Fig. 3(r) and (s), respectively. It is apparent that an amorphous NiO layer is present on NCMS surface with spots of uncovered surface. This overlayer is to be simply referred to as a monolayer amount of NiO hereafter and the NCMS/NiO refers to NCMS coated with 40 cycles of NiO unless mentioned differently.
3.2 Electro-catalytic activity of NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO (NCMS/NiO) as a bi-functional catalyst
The individual half-cell activity of each of the electrocatalysts was tested in a typical three-electrode setup, with 1 M KOH electrolyte, a Pt counter electrode, and a SCE reference electrode. The current density was normalized to the geometric surface area of 1 cm2 throughout this study.
The capacitive current increased during the forward sweep, which disturbs the measurement of the OER overpotential calculation. Therefore, the curves of the reverse sweep of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were analyzed for each catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4(a). From the reverse polarization curves, the NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst with the NiO layer prepared using 40 cycles of ALD (denoted as NCMS/NiO hereafter) had low overpotentials of 186 and 263 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(a). These values are significantly lower than those for the NCMS and NCMO electrocatalysts (315 and 431 mV at 100 mA cm−2, respectively). The overpotentials measured from forward and reverse sweep with and without iR compensation are shown in Fig. 4(b). The iR uncompensated LSV curves are given in Fig. S4† for comparison. The NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst showed greater activity toward the OER half-cell reaction than the RuO2 standard. The mass activity of the NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst (0.0088 g cm−2) was compared with a benchmark RuO2 (0.0055 g cm−2) electrocatalyst loaded on Ni foam, as shown in Fig. 4(c).

(i) EIS measurements in OER half-cell (1.7 VRHE). 
The slope obtained from the linear region of the Tafel plot in Fig. 4(d) was lowest for the NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst, with a value of 42 mV dec−1, followed by that for the NCMS and then the NCMO electrocatalysts, with values of 57 and 74 mV dec−1, respectively. This indicates that the M–S active sites exhibited better water splitting performance than the M–O active sites. The lower Tafel slope obtained for the NCMS/NiO and NCMS electrocatalysts could be attributed to the faster charge transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface, as there were more active sites after the wet sulfurization and ALD processes.
The ECSA is a more appropriate measure of the surface area for a working electrode than the physical area obtained through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis.53 The ECSA was calculated by deriving the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) from the non-faradaic CV curve for each of the electrodes in 1 M KOH electrolyte with different scan rates (Fig. S5†). The NCMS/NiO structure has a larger ECSA (770 cm2) than the NCMS (672 cm2) and NCMO (77 cm2) structures, as shown in Fig. 4(e) and Table S2.† The difference between the NCMO and sulfurized electrodes is due to the significant surface roughness created by the sulfurization process.29 The incorporation of ALD-NiO increases the wettability of the prepared metal-sulfide electrodes as shown in Fig. 4(f).
The number of surface-active species present in the ECSA can be determined from the charge capacity of the electrode. The charge capacities were obtained by integrating the reduction peaks in Fig. 4(g) and S6(a).† The NCMS/NiO, NCMS, and NCMO electrodes had charge capacities of 10.4, 5.8, and 4.1C, respectively, which means that they had 6.5 × 1019, 3.6 × 1019, and 2.6 × 1019 surface-active sites per unit geometric area of electrode, respectively.54 The increase in the number of surface-active sites after ALD-NiO accelerated the OER reaction to deliver high current densities at low potentials. Hence, the loading amount of NiO by ALD should be effectively controlled to derive the maximum efficiency.
The effect of NiO loading on the number of active sites was precisely controlled by the number of ALD cycles (20, 40, 80, 200, and 400), as shown in Fig. 4(h) and S6(b)† along with the corresponding overpotential at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The number of active sites reached its maximum value after 40 ALD cycles, and then decreased as the number of ALD cycles increased further. This effect was also reflected in an increase in the corresponding overpotential and ECSA value. A similar trend was observed for the HER half-cells (Fig. S7†).
The electrocatalytic HER performance of the electrocatalysts was also analyzed in the same three-electrode setup. The NCMS/NiO catalyst exhibited improved HER activity compared to the NCMO and NCMS catalysts, as is apparent in the iR compensated LSV curves in Fig. 5(a) and S8.† For comparison, a Pt/C electrode was also tested, which was found to have an identical mass activity to that of the NCMS/NiO electrode, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The NCMS/NiO electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential of 83 mV at −100 mA cm−2, compared to that of Pt/C (186 mV), NCMS (174 mV), and NCMO (224 mV), as shown in Fig. 5(c). These results reveal the enhancement of the overpotential due to the NiO coating. The reduced Tafel slope achieved by NCMS/NiO (57 mV dec−1), as shown in Fig. 5(d), indicates that the HER follows the Volmer–Heyrovský mechanism. This Tafel slope, which is similar to the slope for Pt/C (54 mV dec−1), is much smaller than that for NCMO (174 mV dec−1) and NCMS (101 mV dec−1). The additional discrete NiO active sites on the NCMS surface should help to increase the number of Hads on the surface and H2 desorption rate. For comparison, a summary of recent reports on the half-cell performance for the OER and HER in 1 M KOH electrolyte with fresh water/deionized water is given in Table S3.†

An important parameter controlling the activity of electrocatalysts is the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots for the three electrodes are shown in Fig. 4(i) and 5(e). They were obtained at +1.70 and −0.25 VRHE for the OER and HER half-cells, respectively, to avoid any disturbance by redox reactions. The plots show that the NCMS/NiO (40 cycles) electrode had a lower RCT value than the NCMO and NCMS electrodes for both the OER and HER, indicating that the ultra-thin NiO layer greatly improves the charge tunneling behavior at the interface. The equivalent circuit used for impedance data fitting and fitted data are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S4,† respectively. The NiO layer thickness had a significant effect, as shown in Fig. 5(f). The NCMS/NiO (40 cycles) electrode had the lowest RCT value of the tested electrodes. The RCT values were higher with 20 and ≥80 cycles of NiO ALD, which can be ascribed to the low front-line active site density and enlarged electron transport paths, and the masking of M–OOH/M–S active sites, respectively. The trend in the overpotential agrees with the Nyquist plots, demonstrating that the overlayer thickness plays a major role in the overall performance (Fig. S7†).
3.3 Identification of real time active sites of the bi-functional NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO (NCMS/NiO) catalyst
The Ni atoms on the surface of the NCMS/NiO samples effectively catalyze the OER and HER, which is believed to increase the overall activity of the catalyst; however, the optimal number of NiO ALD cycles was 40. Therefore, we considered the anatomy of the electrochemical interface during the OER. The surface reconstruction of the M–O and M–S active sites to metal hydroxides and (oxy)hydroxides during the oxidation reaction is unavoidable in transition metal-based catalysts.55–57 To study the surface reconstruction of the NiO and M–S (M = Ni, Co and Mo) active sites, consecutive LSV curves (anodic sweep from 1.0 VRHE to 1.8 VRHE, 5 mV s−1) were obtained for the bare NCMS, NCMS/NiO (40 cycles), and NCMS/NiO (400 cycles) samples (see Fig. 6(a–c)). For all three catalysts, the first LSV curve showed no pre-oxidation/capacitive behavior, but a linear current–potential profile. In the subsequent cycles, the linear shape of the LSV curve became concave, which indicates that there was irreversible surface reconstruction at the electrode surface. Oxidation peaks appeared in the potential window of 1.40 to 1.65 V. The pre-oxidation of the Co2+/Co3+, Ni2+/Ni3+, and Mo4+/Mo6+ sites is irreversible. There was no change in the shape of the LSV curve after 7 consecutive anodic sweeps indicating the completion of the surface reconstruction. It is important to note the decrease in OER current density (>1.65 VRHE) along with the change in surface composition until the surface reconstruction is completed. This is caused by the irreversible conversion of more active M–S active sites into less active metal–oxyhydroxide (M–OOH) sites through the surface reconstruction process. From the classic Pourbaix diagram of Ni–S and Co–S, we can understand that the most stable forms of nickel and cobalt were Ni3+ and Co3+ in the active region of the alkaline OER.58,59 Recent reports on the surface reconstruction of M–O catalysts found that M–OOH had higher activity than M–O toward the OER; therefore, the catalysts showed better OER activity after surface reconstruction.56,60,61 However, in here, the surface reconstructed M–OOH sites have lower activity than pristine M–S sites.

(j) LSV curves of NCMS/NiO (40 ALD cycles) in HER half-cell. HR-XPS profiles of (k) Ni 2p3/2 and (l) O 1s after 50 LSV curves in HER half-cell. 
The impact of surface reconstruction on NCMS/NiO (400 cycles) can be explained analogously to this. Contrary to Fig. 6(a) and (b), the OER activity increased after surface reconstruction for a thicker NiO layer. The dynamic conversion of NiO to NiOOH increased the intrinsic activity of the catalyst (see Fig. 6(c)). The thickness obtained after 400 cycles was 2 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(j) and (k), and the required overpotential was high (405 mV at 100 mA cm−2, reverse sweep LSV without iR compensated), which confirms the masking effect of the NiOOH layer.
The fact that the NCMS/NiO (40 cycles) catalyst had the maximum OER activity indicates that it has both M–OOH (M = Ni, Co, and Mo) from the NCMS core and NiOOH from the NiO monolayer on the accessible surface. Furthermore, the M–S sites are still active even with the NiOOH overlayer covering them, provided the NiO layer is not too thick. Therefore, the positive effect of this is highest with a monolayer amount of NiO. Controlling the thickness to atomic precision is an excellent feature of the ALD technique, providing an opportunity to create monolayer/single-atom like active sites.56
To elucidate this phenomenon further, XPS analyses were performed before and after the seven consecutive LSV cycles for all three catalysts. For prepared catalysts, the M–S peak became weaker after 40 ALD cycles, as discussed in Section 3.1. When the number of cycles was increased to 400, only a faint M–SOx peak was visible, because the M–S sites were completely covered by the thick NiO layer. The presence of both M–O and M–OH peaks (at ∼529.65 and ∼530.61 eV, respectively) in the XPS spectra of the sample prepared by 40 cycles of ALD demonstrates the formation of a thin NiO layer on the NCMS surface. The intensity of these peaks was increased for the sample prepared with 400 ALD cycles. After the LSV curves, the M–OH peak intensities were increased for all three catalysts, which indicates the formation of metal oxyhydroxides on the surface (see Fig. 6(g–i)). In particular, the decrease in the maximum intensity of the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks of the NCMS catalyst after LSV denotes the reconstruction of the M–S surface groups present in the NCMS structure. It also shows the presence of intrinsic M–S sites on the surface near where the electrolyte could access, since most transition metal oxyhydroxides are permeable by the electrolyte.62 Hence, in the bare NCMS catalyst, the OER occurs on the surface reconstructed M–OOH and surface beneath the M–S sites (see Scheme 2(a)).
 Scheme 2  Surface reconstruction of (a) NCMS, (b) NCMS/NiO (40 cycles), and (c) NCMS/NiO (400 cycles) electrocatalysts. 
For the NCMS/NiO (40 cycles) catalyst (Fig. 6(h)), the disappearance of the M–O peak at 529.56 eV and the appearance of the M–OH peak at 530.68 eV indicates the successful surface reconstruction of NiO to NiOOH.63 In addition, the high-resolution Ni 2p3/2 spectrum in Fig. S10(a)† shows the disappearance of Ni0 at 853.83 eV and a 0.21 eV positive shift in the binding energy of the 2+ state peak, indicating that the NiO (ALD deposited) and Ni–S sites (from the NCMS core) are oxidized to form NiOOH.30 In particular, the decrease of the Ni2+/Ni3+ content ratio from 3.25 to 1.14 clearly shows the in situ formation of a thin NiOOH layer over the electrode surface through surface reconstruction.64–66 The high resolution Co 2p3/2 spectrum in Fig. S10(b)† exhibits a pattern similar to that of the Ni 2p3/2 spectra, with a significant positive shift of 0.51 eV in Co 2p3/2 and a reduction in the Co2+/Co3+ ratio from 1.175 to 0.591; this indicates the formation of CoOOH from the NCMS core.67 The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. S10(c)† shows an additional peak at 235.72 eV, apart from the original one at ∼232.9 eV, which could be attributed to the Mo6+ state after the surface reconstruction. Further, the M–S peak at 164.82 eV indicates the presence of M–S close to the surface, since the NiOOH layer is still thin (see Fig. 6(e)). By comparing the spectra of the NCMS and NCMS/NiO catalysts after surface reconstruction, the NCMS/NiO catalyst has additional NiOOH active sites derived from ALD NiO along with the intrinsic M–S/M–OOH (M = Ni, Co, and Mo) sites from the NCMS core, as shown in Scheme 2(b).
For the NCMS/NiO (400 cycles) catalyst (Fig. 6(i)), the intensity of the M–OH peak is greater than that for the other catalysts because the NiOOH layer that forms is thicker owing to the thicker ALD NiO layer. Furthermore, the presence of the M–O peak at 529.76 eV represents the existence of NiO below the reconstructed NiOOH surface (see Scheme 2(c)). The thicker NiOOH/NiO layer limits the electrolyte diffusion to NCMS core, which means that no M–OOH sites form from NCMS. Therefore, only NiOOH sites are available to perform the OER. This is reflected in the decreasing trends in the number of active sites and OER activity. The saturation of the active sites after 200 cycles of ALD can also be attributed to this. It is clear from this discussion that the ALD-deposited monolayer amount of NiO co-catalyst and the mixed M–S catalyst undergo phase changes during the water splitting process, forming multiple active sites of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH and M–OOH/M–S from the ALD NiO and NCMS core, respectively.
Similar experiments were conducted for the HER half-cell with 50 consecutive LSV curves (from 0.3 VRHE to −0.8 VRHE, 5 mV s−1) as shown in Fig. 6(j). The shape of the LSV curve immediately changed after second cycle and became constant throughout the HER experiment. The first curve shows higher HER activity due to the inherent activity of Ni0 active center present on the surface, which gets oxidized during the first cycle. Even though the Ni0 is stable under alkali reduction potential (according to Pourbaix diagram), the oxidation of metal center in aqueous medium is unavoidable. The Ni 2p3/2 spectra shown in Fig. 6(k) show the Ni2+/Ni3+ content ratio as 1.15, which is slightly higher than that of the OER half-cell. Regardless of the reduction potential, surface reconstruction leads to the pre-oxidation of the Ni0 and Ni2+ active sites to a higher oxidation state (Ni3+). The O 1s spectra in Fig. 6(l) show the major M–OH peak identical to the OER half-cell. From previous discussions, the surface reconstruction of the NCMS/NiO bifunctional electrocatalyst is similar for HER and OER half-cells, regardless of the oxidation/reduction environment.
3.4 Durability of NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4/NiO (NCMS/NiO) catalyst in industrial seawater electrolysis
Two-electrode setups were assembled with NCMO, NCMS, and NCMS/NiO electrodes as both the anode and cathode to demonstrate their overall water splitting capabilities. Initially, 1 M KOH in DI water was used as the electrolyte to assess the activity of all three catalysts. As displayed in Fig. S11(a),† the deposition of NiO through 40 ALD cycles greatly improved the activity of the NCMS electrode. The overpotentials before and after iR compensation for the two electrode experiments are displayed in Table S5.† As shown in Fig. S11(b),† the NCMS/NiO cell exhibited extremely small overpotentials (cell voltage minus 1.23 V) of 388 and 517 mV at 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, after iR compensation. This value of 517 mV is significantly lower than that of NCMS (620 mV) and NCMO (990 mV) at 100 mA cm−2.
A long-term durability test involving 14 days of continuous electrolysis of freshwater was conducted in the same setup (Fig. S12†), followed by long-term tests for seawater electrolysis under industrially favored conditions. In the freshwater tests, the electrolyzer was operated at a low current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a daily recharge of fresh electrolyte (1 M KOH) in the first week. In the second week, the measured overpotential was raised from about 360 to about 540 mV to maintain the current density at 100 mA cm−2. The overpotential fluctuations in Fig. S12† were due to the formation of O2 and H2 bubbles on the electrode surfaces.
The structural and compositional changes accompanying the prolonged operation (14 days) were analyzed through HR-SEM and EDS elemental analysis (Fig. S13†). The morphology changes associated with 14 days of continuous operation were not significant at the microscopic scale. Although elemental analysis of NCMS/NiO anode (OER) showed a significant loss of S after 14 days of operation (Table S6†), no significant deviations in the overpotential were observed in the LSV curves for the OER or HER, as shown in Fig. S14.† These results indicate that the NCMS/NiO catalyst is highly durable and suitable for industrial applications where prolonged operation is necessary. The reason for the high corrosion resistance of the electrode during electrolysis is the more stable M–OOH outer layer formed through surface reconstruction.
Next, a long-term seawater electrolysis analysis was conducted under industrially favored conditions of high temperature and high current density, both of which increase hydrogen production. Under these conditions, the electrodes are subjected to severe corrosion owing to the high chlorine concentration (∼3.5% NaCl) and elevated operating temperature. For mass production, a high current density is preferred (>100 mA cm−2), which is destructive to the nanostructures owing to accelerated ion adsorption/desorption processes and intense gas evolution.68 The collected seawater was treated as shown in Fig. S15.† The direct use of seawater (pH ∼8.1) leads to the formation of Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 by reactions with OH− ions generated during electrolysis as follows:69Mg2+ + 2OH− → Mg(OH)2Ca2+ + 2OH− → Ca(OH)2
Furthermore, the HCO3− bicarbonate ions may react with OH− ions and then with Ca2+ ions to form insoluble CaCO3 particles.HCO−3 + OH− → H2O + CO2−3CO2−3 + Ca2+ → CaCO3
These particles could be adsorbed on the electrodes and hinder the electrocatalytic reactions (Fig. S16†). Therefore, it is important to remove these ions before electrolysis using a higher pH electrolyte, whereby the insoluble ions can be precipitated using dissolved OH− ions from KOH. The depletion of OH− ions reduces the pH of the electrolyte from 14 to 8.5. The precipitated Mg/Ca particles are filtered before electrochemical analysis.

Fig. 7(a) shows LSV curves of the NCMS/NiO symmetrical cell for seawater electrolysis at 25 and 80 °C for KOH concentrations of 1 (pH ∼8.5) and 5 M (pH ∼10.5), exhibiting its outstanding catalytic activity even in the presence of large amounts of Mg, Ca, Na, and Cl ions (Fig. 7(d)). At 25 °C, a slight improvement in seawater electrolyte results from the higher conductivity of raw seawater compared to DI water. Under high-temperature operation (at 80 °C), the overpotential for 100 mA cm−2 was reduced from 527 to 377 mV due to the faster interface kinetics, larger driving force of OH− ions in the solution, and faster desorption of gas molecules. Fig. S17† shows the iR compensated LSV curves for comparison. The overpotential further dropped to 252 mV when the KOH concentration was increased to 5 M (Fig. 7(c)). These conditions represent the industrially favored mode of operation with highly alkaline seawater and high temperature. Under high-temperature operation, the maximum current density achieved before the onset of hypochlorite formation was 430 mA cm−2 (<1.72 V without iR compensation).70,71 These cell voltages are given in Table S7† for comparison with the results of recent seawater electrolysis studies.

(c) Comparison of overpotential required for different current densities. (d) Reverse polarization NCMS/NiO catalyst for measurement of HER current density. (e) Comparison LSV curves before and after the 4 h chronopotentiometry test at −100 mA cm−2. 
The catalyst durability was examined by conducting continuous seawater electrolysis in an air tight H-cell setup (Fig. S15(d)†) for 30 days under harsh industrial conditions at a current density of 100 mA cm−2.68 The chronopotentiometry result in Fig. 7(b) shows excellent water splitting performance maintaining an overpotential of 275 ± 21 mV without a noticeable increase over the 30 days. In addition to the structural durability, the electrochemical and phase reversibility of the electrocatalysts were examined by reversing the polarization from anodic to cathodic. During the reverse polarization, the oxygen evolving anode will perform the hydrogen evolving cathode reaction and vice versa. The reverse polarization LSV curve of the NCMS/NiO anode is shown in Fig. 7(d). Under reverse polarization, a very low overpotential of 336 mV was achieved at a current density of −100 mA cm−2. Fig. S18(a) and (b)† show the total overpotentials required by the reverse polarized NCMS/NiO electrode at different current densities and the chronopotentiometry curve recorded at −100 mA cm−2 for 4 h. The reversibility of the NCMS/NiO electrode was verified by performing regular polarization after the 4 h chronopotentiometry test, as shown in Fig. 7(e). The minor differences in the overpotential and LSV curve shape demonstrate the electrochemical and phase reversibility of the NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst under harsh industrial conditions.
To elucidate the reasons for the excellent durability of the catalyst, the surface of the electrode was probed by HR-SEM and XPS after the 30 day seawater electrolysis test. The HR-SEM images of the used OER and HER electrodes are shown in Fig. 8(a–c) and S19,† respectively. The NCMS/NiO cuboids were agglomerated in both the OER and HER electrodes after long-term electrolysis operation. The reason for agglomeration is the long term operation at high temperature (80 °C), as no agglomeration was observed during operation under milder conditions (low current density and low temperature (25 °C)), as shown in Fig. S20(a–c).† The degree of agglomeration was assessed by measuring the ECSA of the used electrodes. The ECSA was reduced by 21.5% and 13.8% for the OER and HER electrodes, respectively (see Fig. 8(d) and S5†). However, the LSV curves obtained with used electrodes in the same industrial cell setup required only a slight increase in total cell voltage of 101 and 103 mV at a current density of 1000 mA cm−2 in regular and reverse polarization sweeps, respectively (Fig. 8(e) and (f)).

The synergistic effect offered by the M–OOH active sites and mixed M–S active sites provides excellent electrochemical sustainability and protection from Cl corrosion. After the initial surface reconstruction, the newly formed oxyhydroxide layers are the reason for increased corrosion resistance. The layered nature of oxyhydroxide helps to withstand the high temperature and current density operation for longer duration. It also resists the deeper penetration of Cl into the Ni foam, which prevents pitting of the Ni foam current collector. The absorption of chloride on large surface area electrodes is common when using a seawater electrolyte. The high-resolution Cl 2p spectrum obtained for the used OER electrode shows two main peaks at 198.67 and 200.08 eV, which can be assigned to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin orbitals, respectively (Fig. 8(g)). This denotes the presence of inorganic chloride (NaCl) on the electrode surface. Furthermore, the absence of peaks at higher binding energies denotes the absence of hypochlorite (ClO−).72 The surface compositions of the used OER and HER electrodes are shown in Table S8.† The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin orbitals at 347.48 and 351.16 eV in the high-resolution Ca 2p profile represent the adsorption of CaCO3 particles on the OER electrode (Fig. 8(h)). No trace of Mg was found on either OER or HER electrode (Fig. 8(i)). The high intensity M–OH (532.52 eV) and Ni3+ (856.48 eV) peaks in the O 1s and Ni 2p3/2 profiles, respectively, show that the predominant M–OOH sites are not masked by adsorbed insoluble particles (Fig. 8(j) and (k)). The presence of the M–SOx peak in Fig. 8(l) verifies that M–OOH sites within the depth of the electrode can be accessed by the electrolyte.
The amount of H2 and O2 yielded was measured by an electrolyzer at 50 mA cm−2 at room temperature in both DI water and seawater with a KOH concentration of 1 M. To accurately measure the actual amounts of H2 and O2 generated, overall water splitting experiments were performed by connecting an air-tight H-Cell directly to a gas chromatography instrument with N2 (20 sccm) purge. The average yields of H2 and O2 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively. The rate of H2 evolution (15.40 μmol min−1) is almost double that of O2 (7.56 μmol min−1) in 1 M KOH DI water electrolyte. The rate of evolution is identical to that of the seawater electrolyte (15.40 and 7.54 μmol min−1 for H2 and O2, respectively).

(c) Comparison of experimental faradaic efficiency of OER and HER and cell voltage. (d) Digital photographs of anode (top) and cathode (bottom) with respect to electrolysis duration. (e) Molar ratio (H2/O2) of gas evolved from seawater electrolyte. (f and g) Comparison of experimental H2 and O2 evolution at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in seawater electrolyte under laboratory conditions (1 M KOH, 25 °C) and industrial conditions (5 M KOH, 80 °C). 

Fig. 9(c) compares the faradaic efficiency of H2 and O2 evolution in DI water and seawater electrolyte. The efficiency was similar in both electrolytes, which indicates the selectivity of the NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst toward the OER in seawater. The faradaic efficiency of H2 reaches 96.8% after 15 min of electrolysis, while that of O2 remains at 72% in the electrolysis of DI water and seawater. This is due to the low cell voltage observed between the anode and cathode in the initial phase of electrolysis due to incomplete surface reconstruction and inadequate wetting of the electrode surface (see Fig. 9(c)). The cell voltage gradually increases and reaches a constant value of 1.88 V after 30 min of continuous electrolysis, although the applied current density (50 mA cm−2) is constant throughout the experiment. The faradaic efficacy of O2 reaches 94.6% once the cell voltage reaches a threshold value of 1.88 V. This shows that the potential difference between the anode and cathode is the actual driving force for water electrolysis, rather than the current density. Further, a higher cell voltage is required due to the slower kinetics of the OER compared to that for the HER. This can be seen from the coherence between the voltage curve and faradaic efficiency in Fig. 9(c).

Fig. 9(d) shows digital photographs of the anode (top) and cathode (bottom) versus electrolysis time. It shows that slow-onset O2 bubbles appear after 10 min, and a steady state is reached after 30 min. In contrast, the evolution of H2 is immediate and reaches a steady state in 10 min. These observations are consistent with the faradaic efficiency shown in Fig. 9(c). Furthermore, the molar ratio of the evolved gas is calculated from the measured gas quantity and is shown in Fig. 9(e). Values greater than 2.0 in the first 30 min of electrolysis also denote the slow rate of O2 evolution; however, the values stabilize after 60 min at 2.0. The evolution of the gases under industrial conditions (100 mA cm−2, 5 M KOH, 80 °C) are shown in Fig. 9(f) and (g). The H2 and O2 evolution rates under industrially favorable conditions were 53.57 and 26.78 μmol min−1, respectively. Notably, this is almost double the rate for seawater electrolysis under laboratory conditions (100 mA cm−2, 1 M KOH, 25 °C).
To demonstrate the scalability of NCMS/NiO electrodes, large area (5 cm x 3 cm) NCMS/NiO electrodes were prepared (Fig. 10(a)). The large area electrode has uniform electrochemical activity for three randomly selected electrode areas (Fig. 10(a)) as shown in Fig. S21.† The negligible difference in morphology and the corresponding elemental analysis indicates a negligible scale effect for the NCMS/NiO electrodes. Obviously, ALD is well known process for its accuracy and scalability in large applications. Industrial seawater electrolysis experiments were conducted and the obtained J–V curve is shown in Fig. 10(b). The large area electrodes reached a current of 1000 mA (upper limit of the laboratory scale potentiostat) with a cell voltage of 1.64 V. The cell voltage was measured at various currents (1000–5000 mA) using a heavy duty power supply as shown in Fig. 10(c). The electrolysis continued for 28 hours with negligible variation in the cell voltage, which shows the durability of large area electrode under harsh high current operation. Considering the advantageous low cost, high electrochemical activity and durability, the scalability of our NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst proves to be a practical candidate for industrial hydrogen production.

4. Conclusions
The atomic layer deposition of a monolayer amount of NiO on the surface of a metal sulfide NiCo2S4/NiMo2S4 composite catalyst doubled the electroactive sites per unit area. The bi-functional NCMS/NiO electrocatalyst was found to be highly efficient for both the HER and OER, requiring an overpotential of only 20 and 216 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Continuous seawater splitting for 30 days under industrial conditions revealed that a current density of 100 mA cm−2 can be maintained throughout the period with an overvoltage of 275 ± 21 mV. The catalyst had excellent durability, requiring an overvoltage increase of only 103 mV at 1000 mA cm−2, even after 30 days of continuous use. The NiO co-catalyst and the mixed metal sulfide catalyst underwent an in situ transformation, leading to dual active sites of M–S and metal-oxyhydroxide. These dual active sites display enhanced activity with good chlorine corrosion resistance during high-temperature seawater electrolysis.
