    , Accepted 13th May 2019First published on 15th May 2019AbstractVisible light assisted photocatalytic transformations have been considered as an efficient and sustainable approach for the production of high-value chemicals. The present paper describes the synthesis of plasmonic silver nanoparticle incorporated reduced graphene oxide and its photocatalytic performance for the selective oxidation of various benzylamines to the corresponding imines using molecular oxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature conditions. The developed photocatalyst was found to be highly stable and exhibited excellent photoactivity with a consistent recycling ability for several runs without a loss in activity. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the developed photocatalyst represents the first example of a graphene-based photocatalyst for the oxidative coupling of amines.
Introduction
Imines and their derivatives have found extensive applications as key intermediates for preparation of various nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds mainly in alkaloid synthesis.1,2 Oxidative coupling of amines is a straightforward approach for the synthesis of these valuable intermediates.3–8 Furthermore, the use of abundantly available solar energy and molecular oxygen as an oxidant makes this methodology greener and sustainable.6,9–12 However, limited reports mainly using semiconductor-based photocatalysts are known in the previous literature for the oxidation of benzylamines to imines using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Su and co-workers investigated mesoporous graphite carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols and amines with O2 under visible light.13 Jin et al. demonstrated the selective oxidation of amines using O2 catalyzed by cobalt thioporphyrazine under visible light.14 Raza et al. reported oxidative coupling of amines by photoactive WS2 nanosheets.15 Furukawa et al. demonstrated the use of Nb2O5 as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for the oxidation of various amines into respective imines in the presence of molecular oxygen as an oxidant.16 Sun et al. reported visible-light-assisted photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines over a NH2-MIL-125(Ti) photocatalyst.17 Very recently Kumar et al. reported a hybrid photocatalyst consisting of an iron bipyridine complex immobilized on graphitic carbon nitride under visible light irradiation.18
Graphene, the newest member of the carbon family, possesses a two-dimensional layered structure of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and unique properties that are useful in catalysis and photovoltaic devices.19 Due to the abundance of delocalized electrons from the conjugated sp2 bonded carbon network, graphitic carbon enhances the transport of photo-generated electrons and increases the photo-conversion efficiency of the system.20–25 Although graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) owing to their lower bandgap have been used as visible light active semiconductor photocatalysts, the conversions were found to be poor due to fast recombination of electron–hole pairs on the surface.24–26 In order to enhance the photo-conversion efficiency of GO/rGO based photocatalysts by suppressing the electron–hole recombination, surface modification with noble metal ions, such as platinum, palladium, silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs), has been well established.27–32 Among the most studied noble metals, silver, owing to its low cost, unique optical properties, higher chemical stability and non-toxic nature, has been considered to be promising for the modification of graphene and its analogs for photocatalytic applications.33–35 Further immobilization of silver nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide is known to improve the performance mainly due to the increased reactive surface area, as well as the superior charge separation. The unique electron collecting and transporting properties of graphene through the conjugated system drive the hot electrons to the reactive sites, suppressing the recombination. Owing to these advantages we have chosen the Ag@rGO photocatalyst for the present study.
Accordingly, we herein report the synthesis, characterization and performance evaluation of silver NP decorated reduced graphene oxide, i.e. Ag@rGO, for the oxidative coupling of benzylamines with molecular oxygen under ambient conditions using visible light irradiation (Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge the present study represents the first report on the use of a graphene-based photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of benzylamines.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the photocatalyst
The desired photocatalyst (Ag@rGO) was obtained by in situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) followed by reduction of graphene oxide into rGO in the presence of formic acid at 80 °C as shown in Scheme 2. The loading of Ag NPs in the photocatalyst was found to be 5 wt% as determined by ICP-AES analysis.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of the Ag@rGO photocatalyst. 
The surface morphology of the photocatalyst was determined by HR-TEM analysis. The HR-TEM images shown in Fig. 1a and b revealed a wrinkled nanosheet like morphology with encapsulation of Ag NPs in rGO nanosheets. Fig. 1c and d show a lattice spacing of around 0.235 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of Ag NPs according to JCPDS no. 04-0783.36 The average particle size of the Ag NPs obtained from the HR-TEM image was approximately in the range of 10–12 nm. The SAED pattern showed that the synthesized material was crystalline in nature. The elemental mapping confirmed the homogeneous dispersion of the Ag NPs throughout the material (Fig. S1, ESI†). Furthermore, EDX (Fig. S1, ESI†) confirmed the presence of all the desired elements i.e. C, O and Ag in the hybrid material.

Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of GO, rGO and the Ag@rGO photocatalyst. The FTIR spectrum of GO showed the characteristic bands related to –OH (3000–3500 cm−1), C–H (νC–H at 2923 cm−1), CC (νCC at 1574 cm−1), C–OH (νC–OH at 1383 cm−1), C–O–C (νC–O–C at 1249 cm−1), C–O (νC–O at 1055 cm−1) and CO (νCO at 1725 cm−1) of the oxygen functionalities present on the basal plane of the graphene sheets (Fig. 2a).37,38 The FTIR spectrum of rGO showed the reduced intensity of all the bands related to the oxygen functionalities and exhibited mainly two absorption bands at 1249 cm−1 (νC–O–C) and 1574 cm−1 (νCC), which indicated the successful reduction of the GO to rGO (Fig. 2b). After the intercalation of Ag NPs between the graphitic sheets of rGO or deposition onto the surface of the nanosheets, the FTIR spectrum of the hybrid remains almost similar to rGO with reduced intensity of the bands. The bands at 3411 cm−1 (OH), 1574 cm−1 (CC) and 1249 cm−1 (C–O–C) could be clearly seen in the FTIR spectrum of the photocatalyst with slightly reduced intensity (Fig. 2c).

The crystalline nature and phase structure of the synthesized samples were determined by XRD analysis (Fig. 3). The diffractogram of GO showed a sharp peak at 2θ = 10.27 corresponding to the (001) plane (Fig. 3a).39 In the case of rGO an intense broad peak at 25.4° and a small peak at 43.6° corresponding to the (002) and (111) planes, respectively, appeared (Fig. 3b).40 In the hybrid Ag@rGO photocatalyst, the peaks observed at 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.5° and 77.3° corresponded to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystallographic planes of the Ag NP phase. The average particle size in the photocatalyst was estimated by using the Debye–Scherrer formula D = 0.9λ/βcosθ(1)where “λ” is the wavelength of the X-rays (1.5418 Å), “β” is the FWHM (full width at half maximum), “θ” is the diffraction angle and “D” is the particle diameter size. The average particle size of the Ag NPs was found to be in the range of 12 nm. The peak at 25.4° indexed to (002) planes with a 0.235 nm interlayer distance is attributed to the presence of graphene in the hybrid material (Fig. 3c).41 The average estimated crystallite size of the Ag NPs at the optimum conditions was found to be in the range of 8–10nm, which matches well with the sizes of Ag NPs obtained from HR-TEM analysis.

Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of the reduced graphene oxide and Ag@rGO hybrid material. In the case of rGO two bands, i.e., the D band and the G band at 1335 and 1594 cm−1, respectively, are obtained (Fig. 4a). The intensity ratio of D to G defines the degree of distortion in the graphitic sheets. The integral intensity ratio of the D to the G band (ID/IG) in rGO was found to be 0.97. After intercalation of the Ag NPs, the integral intensity ratio ID/IG was found to be increased, i.e. 1.18, which suggested the presence of a large number of defects in the form of Ag NPs in the hybrid (Fig. 4b).42

UV-vis spectroscopy was used to determine the absorbance of GO, rGO, and the Ag@rGO photocatalyst. In the case of GO, the absorbance in the region between 250 and 280 nm owing to the π–π* transitions of aromatic C–C bonds indicated the restoration of the extensive conjugated framework of sp2 carbons and a shoulder at about 300 nm assigned to the n–π* transition of CO bonds (Fig. 5a). For rGO the absorption peak corresponding to the π–π* transition of the aromatic C–C bond was found to be red shifted to 270 nm, confirming the reduction of GO (Fig. 5b). The UV-vis spectrum of the Ag@rGO hybrid exhibited strong absorption in the visible region 350–370 nm due to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) of the Ag NPs, which further confirmed its application as a visible light active photocatalyst for organic transformations (Fig. 5c).43 Furthermore, the band gap observed for rGO and the Ag@rGO hybrid was 1.72 and 1.5 eV, respectively, as calculated with the help of a Tauc plot with linear extrapolation (Fig. S2, ESI†). The rate of charge recombination was analyzed with the help of photoluminescence spectroscopy. The PL spectra of rGO displayed a peak at 478 nm with high intensity. However, the significant lowering in the peak intensity in the hybrid photocatalyst confirmed the reduced charge recombination (Fig. S3, ESI†).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to determine the surface chemical composition of the photocatalyst. The XPS survey scan shows the binding energies of all desired elements such as C1s (285.0 eV), O1s (531.5 eV), Ag3d (368 eV) and Ag3d (374 eV) in the hybrid material (Fig. 6a). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of C1s shows three peaks at ∼284, 285.3 and 288.2 eV due to C–C and C–O and CO bonds, respectively, confirming the presence of reduced graphene oxide (Fig. 6b).44 For comparison, we added the XPS of graphene oxide, which exhibited C1s peaks at binding energy 285.8 and 287.9 eV due to the C–C and C–O bonds, respectively (Fig. 6b). The XPS high-resolution spectrum of O1s was deconvoluted into two peaks at 532.3 and 530.8 eV, corresponding to O–H and CO, respectively (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6d shows the high-resolution spectrum of Ag3d, in which two peaks appeared at 374 and 368 eV with a spin energy separation of 6 eV, attributed to Ag3d5/2 and Ag3d3/2, respectively (Fig. 6c). These values confirm that silver is present as Ag0 in the hybrid photocatalyst. The reduction of Ag+ to Ag0 occurred on the surface of the rGO sheets during the reduction process.45,46

The thermal stability of the synthesized hybrid was measured by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermogram of the Ag@rGO photocatalyst showed an initial weight loss at temperature 100 °C due to the evaporation of moisture and a gradual weight loss in the range of 300–500 °C owing to the combustion of the carbon skeleton of graphene (Fig. S4, ESI†). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm for Ag@rGO was of type-IV, which confirmed the mesoporous nature of the material. The higher absorption capacity of the photocatalyst could be attributed to the larger surface area of the material. The SBET and pore volume for Ag@rGO were found to be 88.2 m2 g−1 and 0.25 cm3 g−1, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†).
Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of benzylamines
The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized photocatalyst was evaluated in the oxidative coupling of benzylamines to imines with molecular oxygen under visible light at room temperature using acetonitrile as the reaction medium (Scheme 1). At first, the oxidative coupling of benzylamine was chosen as a representative reaction for screening experiments. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 1. To evaluate the effect of the loading of Ag NPs in the hybrid photocatalyst, two more samples using different amounts of Ag NPs (3 and 7 wt%) were prepared and tested under identical conditions. The activity order of these materials was found to be in the order 3%Ag@rGO < 5%Ag@rGO > 7%Ag@rGO (Table 1, entry 1). The poor product yield in 3%Ag@rGO might be due to the lower concentration of the reactive Ag0-sites on the surface; whereas leaching of active Ag0-content from the surface in 7%Ag@rGO was responsible for the poor reactivity. Hence, 5%Ag@rGO was considered to be the optimum photocatalyst for this transformation. Among the different solvents such as DMF, methanol, ethanol, THF and acetonitrile studied, acetonitrile was found to be best for this transformation (Table 1, entry 2). Visible light irradiation was found to be essential and no reaction occurred in the dark under the described conditions (Table 1, entry 3). Similarly, there was no reaction observed in the absence of the photocatalyst under visible irradiation even after a prolonged reaction time (Table 1, entry 3). The use of the individual components, such as rGO and Ag NPs, as photocatalysts under identical conditions afforded only 13 and 17% conversion of benzylamine, respectively (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). Molecular oxygen was found to be vital, and a negligible yield of the desired product was obtained when nitrogen was used in place of oxygen (Table 1, entry 6).

Based on these experiments, it can also be concluded that the main reactive sites for this transformation in the developed photocatalyst were Ag NPs. However supporting them on rGO significantly improved the reactivity and provided a higher conversion and product yield. The presence of the rGO support in the photocatalyst mainly provided an increased surface area, facile collection and transportation of the electrons on the surface to suppress the recombination of electrons and holes, and finally a higher concentration of the substrate in the vicinity of the reactive sites through π–π interactions. Hence, the presence of the rGO support improved the reactivity of the photocatalyst.
The scope of the reaction was extended for various substituted benzylamines under optimized reaction conditions. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, all the reactants containing either electron donating or withdrawing groups were selectively and efficiently converted to the corresponding N-benzylidene benzylamines with excellent yields without any evidence of the formation of any by-product. Among the various substrates, benzylamines substituted with electron-donating groups i.e. OCH3 and CH3 (Table 2, entries 2–4) were found to be more reactive as compared to those having electron withdrawing groups, i.e. Cl, F and Br (Table 2 entries 6–9). The higher reactivity of the electron-rich substrates may be assumed to be due to the facile formation of cation radicals followed by an imine intermediate after donating electrons to the VB of the photocatalyst during the reaction. Substrates like aniline, cyclohexylamine and n-butyl amine did not show any reaction under the described protocol, and the original substrates could be isolated at the end of the reaction (Table 1, entries 10–12).

Further, recyclability experiments were performed by selecting the oxidative coupling of benzylamine as a representative example. After completion of the reaction, the photocatalyst was easily separated by filtration, washed with acetonitrile, dried and reused for the subsequent experiment with fresh substrate. The results of the recycling experiments are depicted in Fig. 7. The conversion and product yield remained almost the same for seven cycles, confirming that the developed catalyst was highly stable and reusable with consistent efficiency. Further, to check the leaching of Ag NPs during the reaction, selected filtrate samples were analyzed by ICP-AES analysis. There was no detectable amount of Ag NPs observed, which eliminated the possibility of leaching of Ag during the photoreactions. Furthermore, the metal loading in the recovered photocatalyst after the 7th run was found to be 4.98 wt%, which was similar to the fresh one (5 wt%). These results indicated that the developed photocatalyst was highly stable, heterogeneous and no leaching occurred during the photocatalytic experiments.
 Fig. 7  Results of recycling experiments. 
The exact mechanism of the reaction is not known at this stage. Based on the existing reports, a plausible mechanism of the reaction is proposed as shown in Scheme 3. Under the light irradiation, charge separation takes place in the photocatalyst and photo-generated electrons are produced in the conduction band (CB) and photo-generated holes remain in the valence band (VB). The presence of rGO owing to its 2D planar conjugated structure facilitated the charge separation and provided mobility of these electrons on the photocatalyst surface.47 These hot electrons react with oxygen molecules adsorbed on the rGO surface and convert them to O2˙− radicals.48 These O2˙− radicals are very powerful oxidizing agents and can oxidize benzylamine to imine under visible-light irradiation. At the same time, reactive holes in the VB of Ag are able to oxidize benzylamine molecules directly due to their strong oxidizing ability. As a result, the separated electrons and holes are fully involved in the photocatalytic reactions and provided improved activity.

Furthermore, in order to verify the suggested mechanism we performed quenching experiments by using NaN3 as a quencher. A comparison between the original photocatalytic experiment and that obtained after the addition of sodium azide (NaN3) at different time intervals followed by analysis by GC-MS (Fig. 8) was made to visualize the quenching effect of azide ions. After adding NaN3 as a quencher the maximum conversion of benzylamine in the presence of the hybrid photocatalyst reached only 13.7% after 12 h. While in the case of the original photocatalytic experiment, the maximum conversion reached 98% under the same reaction conditions. These experimental results confirmed the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in the photocatalytic system under visible light irradiation.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated an efficient, easily synthesized and cost-effective heterogeneous photocatalyst prepared by single step in situ grafting of Ag NPs onto the surface of rGO for the oxidative coupling of benzylamines to imines under visible light at room temperature. The developed photocatalyst exhibited higher efficiency as compared to its individual components such as rGO and Ag NPs and reported photocatalysts in the prior art (Table S1, ESI†). More importantly, the photocatalyst showed consistent recycling for several runs without any remarkable loss of the activity. This study promotes the synthesis of graphene-based heterogeneous materials for visible light assisted organic transformations.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification. Graphite flakes, potassium permanganate (99%), sodium nitrate (99%), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide (30%), acetonitrile, formic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) were procured from Alfa Aesar. The deionized (DI) water used throughout the experiments was of HPLC grade. Graphene oxide was synthesized from graphite powder according to the modified method reported by Hummers and Offeman.49
Synthesis of the in situ Ag@rGO hybrid photocatalyst50
Graphene oxide (1.0 g) was sonicated with 50 mL DI water, and then 2 mL of formic acid was mixed in the reaction mixture. Subsequently, AgNO3 (50 mg) was added as a precursor of Ag NPs in the hybrid material. The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 6 h under continuous stirring. The solid was separated by filtration and washed with deionized water several times followed by a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate to remove the excess formic acid. Finally the solid was washed with deionized water and dried under a vacuum overnight at 60 °C for 6 h. For the comparative study, bare reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared by following a similar procedure without adding silver nitrate. Similarly, other Ag@rGO samples containing different amounts of Ag NPs were prepared for the comparative study.
Characterization techniques
The surface morphology of the samples was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with a JEM 2100, Japan operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV using lanthanum hexaboride as the source of electrons. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement of the photocatalyst was carried out using an ESCA+ (Omicron Nanotechnology, Oxford Instruments, Germany) XPS system having an angle between the analyzer and the source of 90°. All the binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV of surface adventitious carbon. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum RX-1 IR spectrophotometer using a potassium bromide window. The crystalline structure of the samples was determined using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 2θ = 20–80° and a scan rate of 40 min−1. UV-visible spectra of the samples were collected on a PerkinElmer Lambda-19 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer using a 10 mm quartz cell, while the absorption spectra of solid samples were recorded by using a fine powder of BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. Raman spectra of the samples were measured at room temperature using a Raman microprobe (HR-800 Jobin-Yvon) with a 532 nm Nd-YAG excitation source. The specific surface area of the samples was determined using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77 K by using a VP Micromeritics ASAP 2010. The thermal degradation pattern of the materials was calculated by TG-DTA analysis by using a thermal analyzer TA-SDT Q-600 in the temperature range of 40 to 800 °C under nitrogen flow with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. 1H NMR of the reaction products was collected at 500 MHz by using a Bruker Advance-II 500 MHz instrument.
