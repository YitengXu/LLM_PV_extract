Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using pure graphite sheet as the substrate and catalytic material were first fabricated based on a disulfide/thiolate (T2/T−) redox couple. It can present up to 4.79% of the power-conversion efficiency (PCE), compared with the 2.33% of triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple at the same experimental condition under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). In contrast, when FTO/Pt is used as the counter electrode, PCE values are 3.97% and 7.13% based on the T2/T− and I3−/I−redox couples, respectively. With respect to the above dramatic difference, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are applied to study the catalytic behavior at electrolyte (T2/T− and I3−/I−)/counter electrode (graphite sheet and FTO/Pt) interface. In particular, EIS indicated that the charge transfer resistance (RCT) (1.1 Ω cm2) of the graphite sheet for T2/T− is less than one-ninth of its RCT (10.2 Ω cm2) for I3−/I−. However, the RCT of FTO/Pt (7.7 Ω cm2) for T2/T− is more than twice the RCT (3.0 Ω cm2) of I3−/I−. This demonstrates the high catalytic selectivity of graphite and platinum (Pt) for the two redox couples. These results show the great potential of carbon materials to replace Pt by using this novel electron-transfer mediator in DSSCs.
Introduction
Considerable attention has been paid to photovoltaic solar energy with the current energy and environmental crises. In past decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 have attracted significant interest due to the capability for high power-conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost. Recently, the PCE of liquid state DSSCs has been shown to reach 12%.2 In high-performance DSSCs, the most often used electrolyte is the triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple.3,4 However, the redox couple faces many challenges despite its efficiency. First, I2 is corrosive to electrode materials such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), resulting in poor long-term stability and complexity of encapsulation. In particular, when a silver grid is used as a current collector to decrease the sheet resistance of a large-scale device, the I3−/I− will dissolve the metal grid.5 Secondly, I2 has a high vapor pressure, resulting in complex encapsulation. Third, this redox couple can absorb visible light to reduce the utilization of sunlight, particularly in the back-illumination mode. Therefore, the development of new redox couples plays an important role in solving above disadvantages. Moreover, the development is essential for the future of DSSCs. To date, Br−/Br3−,6SCN−/(SCN)2,7SeCN−/(SeCN),3–8organic radicals (TEMPO),9 and organosulfur compounds10,11 have been introduced into DSSCs as efficient redox couples.
Another important component of DSSCs is the counter electrode (CE), the catalytic activity of which vastly affects the performance of cells. In numerous CE materials, the noble metal platinum (Pt) is widely applied due to its superior electrocatalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, and good chemical stability.12 Unfortunately, the high price, limited reserve, and corrosion in the I3−/I− system are serious disadvantages affecting cost-effective fabrication and long-term stability of DSSCs. Thus, the production of Pt-free cathode is important in the practicability of DSSCs. To address this issue, various kinds of CE materials have been developed, including carbon (carbon spherules, activated carbon, mesoporous carbon, single and multi-wall carbon nanotubes),13–17 surface-nitrided nickel,18 and CoS.19 Among them, carbon materials have the best potential because of their abundance and low cost. As early as 1996, Kay et al. found good electrochemical activity from the graphite/carbon black mixture.20 Although the PCE of DSSCs that used carbon as the CE can reach a level similar to that of Pt in the I3−/I− system, these results are mainly because the specific surface area of the former is considerably greater than that of the latter.21 In the case of pure graphite, the low PCE is attributed to the small catalytic surface area.22 At the same time, the thickness of carbon CE (1–150 μm) is greater than that of Pt (10–50 nm). Based on this point, the electrochemical activity of the carbon material for I3−/I− is inferior to Pt.
Recently, Grätzel et al.11 reported an organic redox couple, disulfide/thiolate redox (T2/T−), derived from 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole, which achieved an efficiency of 6.4% with Z907Na-based (Na(Ru(4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate)(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2)) DSSCs under standard illumination conditions (100 mW cm−2). The structural formula is shown in Fig. 1. The redox couple was first used as a solid polymer electrolyte in quantum-dot DSSCs (QDSSCs).23 In QDSSCs, the carbon electrode is better than Pt in catalytic activity in relation to polysulfide electrolyte (Sx2−/S2−).24,25 Considering the similarity of S2−/Sx2− and T2/T−, we speculate that carbon materials may possess good catalytic activity for T2/T−. Here, we report the preparation of DSSCs based on a pure graphite sheet, which serves as substrate and reasonably active CE for the T2/T−redox couple. In contrast to early reports,20,22 we obtained good solar energy conversion efficiency (4.79%) under standard illumination (AM 1.50). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) are applied to study systematically the catalytic behavior at electrolyte (T2/T− and I3−/I−)/CE (graphite sheet and FTO/Pt) interface.

Experiment
Materials
The LiI (99%), LiClO4 (99%), (CH3)4NOH (TMAOH, 99.8%), 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole (TH) and propylene carbonate (PC) were purchased from Aldrich. CH3CN (AN) is from Siyou Inc., Tianjin, China. The I2 (AR) and (CH3)4NI (AR) are purchased from the Beijing Chemical Reagent Company. The FTO, TiO2 paste (DHS-TPP3) and N719 (RuL2(NCS)2:2TBA, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, TBA = tetrabutylammonium) (Solarnix) were purchased from Heptachroma Inc., Dalian, China.
Syntheses of disulfide/disulfide/thiolate
The synthetic routine of T− and T2 was based on the literature.11 The 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole N-tetramethylammonium salt (TMAT) was prepared by neutralizing 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole (1.46 g, 12.6 mmol) (Aldrich, 98%) with a 25 wt% solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide in methanol (1.4 mL, 13.3 mmol) (Aldrich). The solution was added dropwise in a glove box under an argon atmosphere. The solvent was evaporated and the resulting white solid was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h with P2O5 (EMD, ACS). Di-5-(1-methyltetrazole) disulfide (T2) was prepared by oxidizing 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole (4.0 g, 34.4 mmol) by iodine (4.0 g, 15.8 mmol) (Aldrich, 99.8%) in water. The mixture was sonicated for 1 h until I2 disappeared. The white precipitate was collected by filtration under vacuum, was washed thoroughly with cold nanopure water, and was dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 48 h.
Preparation of DSSCs
The TiO2 (DHS-TPP3, diameter: ∼20 nm) photoanode on FTO glass was prepared by screen-printing. After one screen-printing, a TiO2 film with a thickness of approximately 3.5 μm was obtained. The film was heated at 150 °C for 15 min and at 450 °C for 30 min. After three feedback circles, a film with a thickness of approximately 10.5 μm was obtained. When the temperature of final photoanode was reduced to 100 °C, TiO2 films were immersed into a N719 ethanol solution (0.5 mM) at room temperature for 24 h. The DSSCs were prepared by assembling the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode (test area: ca. 0.28 cm2) and the CE into a sealed sandwich-type cell, which was separated by using a 25 μm thick hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn, Dupont) as spacer. The cell was filled with five kinds of electrolytes through a hole in one FTO electrode and was finally closed by a Surlyn seal. Two kinds of CEs were used: (1) an approximately 50 nm Pt film on the FTO prepared by magnetic sputtering and (2) a 0.2 cm thick graphite sheet (Aldrich, 99%).
Methods and measurement
The performance of all solar cells is characterized by AM 1.50. The simulated solar light source was YSS-50A (Yamashita DESO) and the light intensity was 100 mW cm−2. The CV and EIS were conducted on the Shanghai Zhenhua electrochemical station CHI630C and Solartron 1250 frequency analyser (The frequency range is from 60 kHz to 20 mHz), respectively. To investigate the performance of the cathode at conditions that are as close as possible to the actual situation in DSSCs, the symmetrical sandwich cell was used.26 It was fabricated from two identical FTO/Pt or graphite sheets separated by 25 μm thick Surlyn tape serving as a spacer and with 1 × 1 cm2 active area with two edges of the cell being left open for electrolyte soaking.
Results and discussions
In DSSCs, the composition and ratio of electrolyte drastically affect the performance of device. In the classic I3−/I−redox couple, the optimum ratio of LiI/I2 is approximately 10:1 (0.5 M I− and 0.05 M I2), but the optimum ratio of T2/T−redox is 1:1 (0.4 M T2 and 0.4 M T−).11 To compare the different catalytic activity of the CEs for these two electrolytes, we designed a series of control experiments (Table 1). The adopted solvent is AN/PC (volume ratio: 1:1). First, the same concentration should be ensured. In Table 1, the ratio and concentration of electrolytes A and B are the same as those of electrolytes E and F. For A and E, the ratio of Red/Ox is 10:1 (0.5 M: 0.05 M). For B and F, the ratio of Red/Ox is 1:1 (0.5 M: 0.5 M). Second, although the ratio and concentration are equal, the kinds of cations would affect the electron injection efficiency, electrocatalytic activity and electron mobility in the nanostructured TiO2 film as well as the performance of the DSSCs.26–28 In I3−/I−redox couple, the cation is Li+; it is, however, TMA+ in T2/T−. Thus, we designed the other control group: electrolytes C and D. Electrolytes A, C, and E comprise one control group; electrolytes B, D, and F comprise the other group. However, electrolyte C was not dissolved completely in AN/PC solvent, thus further investigation was not carried out (electrolyte C was not listed in Table 1). Using above five electrolytes, we prepared DSSCs. Based on the two kinds of CEs, these devices were termed as G–A, G–B, G–D, G–E, and G–F for graphite sheet electrode and Pt–A, Pt–B, Pt–D, Pt–E, and Pt–F for FTO/Pt electrode.

 Fig. 2  
J–V characteristics of DSSCs using (a) graphite and (b) Pt as CE. (Testing area: 0.28 cm2.) 
The device performance of the T2/T−redox is superior to I3−/I−redox when the graphite sheet was used as CE (Fig. 2a and Table 2). Notably, Device G–E and G–F, which uses the T2/T−redox couple, have lower Voc (632, 634 mV) than device G–A (717 mV). When the DSSCs were under an open circuit illumination, the net injection rate of the electron from the excited dyes to TiO2 was balanced with the recombination of the electron and electrolyte. A previous report11 found that T2/T− electrolyte would result in the downward shift in the energy level of the conduction-band edge of TiO2, which would reduce Voc. However, the Jsc of the device G–F (12.88 mA cm−2) is over twice that of device G–A (6.18 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the FF of G–F (0.59) is higher than that of G–A (0.53). Thus, the PCE of G–F (4.79%) is over twice that of G–A (2.33%). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE we achieved is the highest value for using pure graphite sheet as CE.13,16 In previous reports, the solar conversion efficiency based on the graphite CE is extremely low and can be improved by enlarging catalytic surface area. For G–E and G–A with the same Red/Ox ratio, the performance of the former still exceeded the latter. Compared with G–F, the Jsc and FF of G–E decreased because a fewer T2 results in inefficient charge transport.11 This imply that graphite may display better electrocatalytic activity for T2/T− than I3−/I−.
In contrast, the performance of T2/T−redox is inferior to I3−/I−redox when FTO/Pt is used as the CE (Fig. 2b and Table 2). For device Pt–A, Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE can reach 661 mV, 16.44 mA cm−2, 0.66 and 7.13%. For T2/T−redox couple, device Pt–F is better than Pt–E, which is consistent with recent reports.11 However, the Voc (584 mV), Jsc (12.59 mA cm−2), and FF (0.54) of Pt–F are all lower than these of Pt–A. So, its PCE is just half of Pt–A. These results indicate that the Pt may display better electrocatalytic activity for I3−/I− than for T2/T−.
But, in the other control groups, the performances of G–B, G–D, Pt–B, and Pt–D were very low. In these two electrolytes, the concentration of I3− was very high, which aggravated the recombination in the interface between electrolyte and TiO2 and reduced the lifetime of electron. This decreased device performance.24 Kloo et al.10 achieved approximately 2% PCE under 0.5 M I2 condition. Our results are far below this value. The major reason is the adopted solvent. In our study, sticky PC is mixed with AN, which slowed down the diffusion rate of ion and remarkably diminished the device performance.27
Characterization of CV and EIS
Based on above results, graphite and Pt present reverse catalytic characters for T2/T− and I3−/I−redox couples. These results reflect their different catalytic activities for different redox couples. For this reason, we continued to investigate CV and EIS of two kinds CEs for the two different redox couples.

Fig. 3 shows the CVs of graphite and Pt for T2/T− and I3−/I− in AN/PC (1/1, v/v) solutions. More negative cathodic peaks correspond to the reduction of I3− and T2 and the anodic peaks represent the reverse reaction.25 When the work electrode is graphite (Fig. 3a), the reduction peak current density of T2/T−redox couple is distinctly higher than I3−/I−. In terms of the symmetry of CVs, the reversibility of the former is better than that of the latter. In previous research,13–17 the considerable reduction in the peak current density is attributed to the larger surface area of carbon materials. However, the specific surface area of the work electrode is equal in the present work and graphite catalytic activity for T2/T− is better compared with that of I3−/I−, which is associated with good performance of T2/T− based on graphite CE. The oxidation-reduction potential of I3−/I− is more positive than that of T2/T−. This may explain that G–A possesses higher Voc (717 mV) than G–F (634 mV) because the Voc of DSSCs depends on the difference between EF and the oxidation–reduction potential ERed/ox. However, the contrary is true in the case of Pt. The I3−/I− is superior to T2/T− in catalytic activity in terms of reduction peak current density and reversibility of oxidation–reduction reaction. Specially, the ΔEp (difference of EOx − ERed) of T2/T− is up to 0.7 V, compared to 0.3 V of I3−/I− when the Pt is used as work electrode. These results indicate high catalytic selectivity of graphite and platinum (Pt) for the two redox couples.

I3−/I− electrolyte: 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.05 M LiClO4 mixed solvent. T−/T2 electrolyte: 10 mM TMAT, 1 mM T2, and 0.05M LiClO4. Solvent: AN/PC = 1:1 (v/v). Reference electrode: Ag/AgCl. Scan rate: 10 mV s−1. 
To elucidate the role of CEs on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, EIS analysis was carried out with the sandwich-type electrochemical cells comprising two identical graphite sheet (or Pt) electrode,26 measured in the frequency range of 0.02 Hz to 65 kHz. The results are shown in the form of a Nyquist plot (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a shows the equivalent circuits for the dummy cells,29 which can be fitted to a Randles-type circuit plus serial resistance (RS), charge transfer resistance (RCT), constant phase element (Q), and Nernst diffusion resistance (ZN). The latter is related to the diffusion coefficient of I3− (or T2) in the electrolyte solution, Di:  where A is the electrode area, c is the concentration of I3− (or T2), and L is the distance between electrodes.26 If the reactions at both electrodes are identical, Q is replaced by the capacitance (C). However, more accurate analysis points to a small deviation caused by the roughness of the electrodes. Thus,Q = B(iω)−β where B and β are frequency-independent parameters of CPE. The experimental Qspectrum is shown in the first semicircle (Fig. 4). The basic requirements for electrocatalytic activity of the DSSCs cathode are outlined by the typical current densities on the TiO2 photoanode. Ideally, the exchange current density on the cathode, j0, provides an estimate of the required charge transfer resistance, RCT, of the cathode:

All the parameters are derived from the EIS through fitting the plots with Z-VIEW software (Table 3). In Table 3, the Rs of graphite is slightly lower than that of FTO/Pt. For the same CE, parameter B and β are in the same level. However, a large difference was observed in the two parameters for different CEs. The surface of Pt is smooth, thus the β (0.95) of Pt is higher than graphite sheet (∼0.80). This reflects that Pt/electrolyte/Pt is near the ideal capacitance. However, B of graphite is 2 magnitudes higher than that of Pt, which can be attributed to the large surface area. Although the increased B values suggest larger electrochemically active areas for the graphite electrodes, the difficulty of correlating quantitatively the B values with the electrochemically active areas remains. In contrast, the other two parameters RCT and ZN have been frequently used to evaluate the influence of the electrode material on the performance of the solar cells. However, in the present study, we failed to distinguish ZN in the EIS data obtained.

The exchange–current density mainly depends on two factors: the concentration of the oxidized species and the electrocatalytic performance of the CE. In Table 3, a decrease in the RCT with the increase of the concentration of I2 or T2 is shown. For the Pt, the Rct of Pt–A, Pt–B, and Pt–D is significantly less than that of Pt–E and Pt–F. Specifically, charge-transfer resistance of Pt–A (3.0 Ω cm2) is less than one half of that of Pt–E (7.7 Ω cm2) and Pt–F (8.6 Ω cm2). These results indicate that Pt's catalysis for I3−/I− precedes that for T2/T−. In contrast, the RCT of G–A, G–B, and G–D is 4–9 times the RCT of G–E and G–F. Graphite displays better electrocatalytic activity for T2/T− than I3−/I−. As a result, in the case of electrolyte A, the relative high Jsc (16.44 mA cm−2) and FF (0.66) of Pt–A are associated with the superior catalytic activity of Pt for I3−/I−, compared with G–A. Conversely, G–E and G–F show better performance than Pt–E and Pt–F, respectively, which benefits from the pronounced catalysis of graphite for T2/T−. In particular, when the ratio of T2/T− is 1/10, the remarkable difference between the G–E and Pt–E is that the FF of the former (0.56) is almost 1.6 times of the latter (0.36). When the oxide species is in small amounts, the performance of DSSCs depends on the mass transfer and catalytic activity.11 To some extent, these results are associated with the efficient reduction of T2 on the interface between graphite and electrolyte.
When the same counter electrode and different kinds of redox couple are used in DSSCs, the comparison is still difficult. At first, the same counter electrode displays variant catalytic activity for different redox couples. Secondly, the photoanode shows a discrepancy between dye-regeneration and recombination for different electrolytes.30 In a previous report,11 the rate of dye-regeneration in I3−/I− electrolyte is obviously faster than in the T2/T−. Recently, Pijpers et al.31 found that the injection kinetics of T2/T− was slower than I3−/I−. These researches could give the reason why the PCE of G–F based T2/T− electrolyte and graphite CE is not at the same level as Pt–A, although the graphite demonstrates good electrocatalytic activity toward T2/T−. It is very important to find or design suitable dyes to match the new redox couple.32,33
Conclusions

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using a pure graphite sheet as the substrate and catalytic material were fabricated based on disulfide/thiolate (T2/T−) redox couple. Their PCE can be up to 4.79%, compared with 2.33% of the triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple under the same experimental conditions. In contrast, when FTO/Pt was employed as the counter electrode, their PCEs were 3.97% and 7.13% for T2/T− and I3−/I−redox couples, respectively. The CV and EIS indicate that Pt possesses better catalytic activity for I3−/I− compared with T2/T−. However, graphite shows better electrocatalysis for T2/T− than for I3−/I−. These results seem to indicate a way to overcome the conventional Pt electrode by using carbon material and new sulfur-containing redox couple.
