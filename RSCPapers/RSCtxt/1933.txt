    , Accepted 27th March 2012First published on 28th March 2012AbstractIn the present study, molybdenum phosphide (MoP), nickel phosphide (Ni5P4), and carbon-supported Ni5P4 (Ni5P4/C) were proposed for use as counter electrode (CE) catalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) for the regeneration of both the conventional I3−/I− redox couple and a new organic T2/T− redox couple. For the I3−/I− redox couple, the DSCs using MoP and Ni5P4 CE yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.92 and 5.71%, and the DSC using Ni5P4/C showed a high PCE of 7.54%, which was close to that of the DSC using Pt CE (7.76%). For the T2/T− redox couple, Ni5P4/C performed much better than Pt and the DSC using Ni5P4/C CE showed a PCE of 4.75%, much higher than the photovoltaic performance of the DSC using Pt CE (3.38%).
1. Introduction
With the increasing energy crisis, the optimization of solar energy resources is important and necessary. As a powerful photovoltaic device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have achieved several advancements after two decades of research.1–6 Generally, a DSC possesses three primary components: a photoanode (a dye sensitized oxide semiconductor), an electrolyte containing a redox couple (usually I3−/I−), and a counter electrode (CE).
As a crucial component, the CE is generally conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass deposited with Pt as catalyst, where I3− is reduced to I− by the electrons flowing through the external circuit. However, the high price and dissolution of Pt in corrosive electrolytes restrict the mass production of DSCs. To resolve this issue, several low-cost catalysts have been proposed to replace Pt, such as carbon materials,7,8 conductive polymers,9,10 and composite materials.11,12 Recently, inorganic materials have been introduced into DSCs as CE catalysts. These new catalysts can be divided into four classes: carbides (MoC, WC),13,14 nitrides (Mo2N/MoN, W2N/WN),15,16 oxides (V2O5, WO2),17,18 and sulfides (CoS, NiS, MoS2, and WS2).19–21 Moreover, our group introduced the carbides, nitrides and oxides of Cr, V, Ti, Nb, and Zr into DSCs and obtained ideal results.22 Lin et al. used CZTS as counter electrode for DSCs and received good results.23 Gao et al. introduced a Ni12P5/graphene composite CE in I3−/I− based DSCs, resulting in an efficiency of 5.70%.24 All of these inorganic catalysts have shown decent catalytic activity for the regeneration of the I3−/I− redox couple.
The electrolyte is another key component of DSCs. Recently, two new redox couples have been used to replace I3−/I−; they are T2/T− and Co3+/Co2+.25–28 Interestingly, several low-cost Pt-free catalysts (such as carbon materials, carbides, oxides) are more suitable than Pt for the regeneration of T2/T− and Co3+/Co2+ redox couples.21,22,25,29 Therefore, it is quite significant to develop new catalysts for I3−/I−, T2/T− or Co3+/Co2+ redox couples to enhance the efficiency and to reduce the cost of DSCs. Compared with carbides, nitrides, oxides, and sulfides, phosphides are less known as catalysts.30,31
The aim of the present work is to apply the as-synthesized MoP, Ni5P4, and carbon-supported Ni5P4 (Ni5P4/C) as CE catalysts in the DSC systems. Based on cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel-polarization measurements, MoP and Ni5P4 showed decent catalytic activity for the regeneration of the conventional I3−/I− redox couple. Ni5P4/C performed as well as Pt for the I3−/I− redox couple. In addition, Ni5P4 and Ni5P4/C catalysts have been introduced into the organic redox couple (T2/T−), and the DSC using a Ni5P4 CE achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.87%, which was slightly higher than that of the DSC using a Pt CE (3.38%). By contrast, the DSC using a Ni5P4/C CE showed a high PCE of 4.54%, an improvement of 41% compared with the Pt-DSC. The current work proves the feasibility of replacing the expensive Pt by commercial phosphides, and expands the scope of CE catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Ni5P4, MoP, mesoporous carbon (MC), and Ni5P4/C
(1) Ni5P4 was prepared by adding an aqueous solution of 1.77 g (NH4)2HPO4 in 10 mL of deionized water dropwise to a solution of 3.90 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in 15 mL deionized water under stirring. The resulting precipitate was stirred while the water evaporated to obtain a solid product, which was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and sintered at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the final Ni5P4 catalyst. (2) MoP was prepared by dropwise addition of an aqueous solution of 3.90 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in 15 mL deionized water to a solution of 3.0 g (NH4)2HPO4 in 10 mL deionized water under stirring. The resulting precipitate was stirred while the water was evaporated to obtain a solid product, which was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and sintered at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the final MoP catalyst. (3) Mesoporous carbon (MC) was prepared according to our previous research.32 The Ni5P4/C was prepared as follows. A quantity of 0.8 g of MC wet-impregnated with the prepared Ni5P4 (0.275 g) solution for 0.5 h at room temperature. The mixture was heated to evaporate the water, and then the obtained solid was dried at 120 °C overnight, followed by calcination in N2 at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the final Ni5P4/C catalyst.
2.2 Electrode fabrication and cell assembly
A 5 layer TiO2 (Solaronix D, Switzerland) nanocrystalline film sensitized with N719 (Solaronix, Switzerland) was used as photoanode. In detail, a thin layer of TiO2 was coated on FTO conductive glass with a screen printing technique. Then the TiO2 film was sintered at 200 °C for 15 min. The above-mentioned process was repeated four times and 5 layers of TiO2 film was obtained. After sintering at 500 °C for 10 min, and cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 film was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution, and then washed with distilled water. After sintering at 500 °C for 30 min, the mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 film was completely fabricated. The thickness of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film was around 12 μm. The TiO2 film was pre-heated to 80 °C, and immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 volume ratio) for 20 h and the photoanode was obtained. Two kinds of electrolyte were used in this research. The first is the I3−/I− electrolyte which contains 0.06 M of LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile. The second is 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole N-tetramethylammonium salt (+NMe4T−, T−)/di-5-(1-methyltetrazole) disulfide (T2) electrolyte. The T2/T− electrolyte contains 0.4 M +NMe4T−, 0.4 M T2, 0.05 M LiClO4 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile–ethylene carbonate (6:4, volume ratio). MC, MoP, Ni5P4, and Ni5P4/C counter electrodes were fabricated with the spray-coating technique as follows. 200 mg of MC (MoP, Ni5P4, or Ni5P4/C) powder was dispersed in 4 mL isopropanol. The solution was then ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min and the paste for spraying was obtained. The prepared paste was sprayed onto an FTO glass with an airbrush. Subsequently, the FTO glass coated with various pastes was sintered in an N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min and the CE was prepared. Pt deposited on FTO conductive glass was used as the Pt CE.33 A DSC was assembled with a photoanode and counter electrode sandwiching the electrolyte and sealed by double-sided insulating tape. A symmetrical cell was assembled with two identical counter electrodes.
2.3 Measurements
XRD was carried out with an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, Rigaku). The surface morphologies of the phosphides were checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 450 and FEI Hitachi S-4800). The mesoporous structure of MC was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai, G2 Spirit). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the I3−/I− redox couple was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution which contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI630, Chenhua, Shanghai). Pt served as a counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode. CV for the T2/T− redox couple was carried out in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution containing 100 mM +NMe4T−, 10 mM T2, and 0.2 M LiClO4. The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was carried out under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (I = 100 mW cm−2, PEC–L15, Peccell, Japan) with a digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). EIS experiments were tested with symmetrical cells using a computer-controlled potentiostat (Zennium Zahner, Germany). The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. The amplitude of the alternating current was set at 10 mV. Tafel-polarization measurements were measured with an electrochemical workstation system (CHI630, Chenhua, Shanghai) in a symmetrical dummy cell. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the prepared MoP Ni5P4, mesoporous carbon (MC), and Ni5P4/C by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the MoP (dotted line, 24-0771, PDF-2 database). The diffraction peaks at 27.9, 32.0, 43.0, 57.7, 64.9, 67.6, and 74.1° can be ascribed to the crystal planes of [001], [100], [101], [110], [111], [200], and [201]. In Ni5P4 (dashed line, 65-2075, PDF-2 database), the diffraction peaks at 15.0, 16.1, 22.1, 28.7, 30.4, 30.9, 31.4, 34.6, 36.0, 39.3, 40.7, 41.4, 44.0, 45.1, 46.3, 47.0, 47.8, 49.8, 52.9, 54.1, 76.5, and 86.9° can be ascribed to the crystal planes of [100], [002], [102], [103], [200], [112], [201], [202], [104], [203], [210], [211], [212], [204], [300], [301], [213], [006], [214], [220], [112], and [202]. For the black solid line, the broad diffraction peaks at 24.0° and 43.0° can be attributed to the amorphous carbon (MC). The diffraction peaks of the gray solid line can be considered to be a result of the combination of Ni5P4 and MC and this proved that Ni5P4/C was prepared successfully.

Fig. 2a shows that the MC blocks have a universal size. In Fig. 2b, the MoP particles are stuck together, and their diameter is approximately 50 nm. Fig. 2c shows that Ni5P4 comprises irregular particles with particle sizes from 50 nm to 2 μm. As shown in Fig. 2d, when Ni5P4 is embedded in MC, the MC and Ni5P4 particles are physically mixed and disorderly.

3.2 Catalytic activity of MoP, Ni5P4, MC, Ni5P4/C, and Pt for the I3−/I− redox couple

3.2.1 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of MoP, Ni5P4, MC, Ni5P4/C, and Pt for the I3−/I− redox couple. 
CV was performed using MoP, Ni5P4, MC, Ni5P4/C, or Pt as working electrode to investigate the catalytic activity for the regeneration of I3−/I−. As shown in Fig. 3, two pairs of redox peaks were observed for Pt, with the left pair assigned as eqn (1) and the right pair as eqn (2). However, for MC, MoP, and Ni5P4 electrodes, only one pair of redox peaks was observed, and this phenomenon was observed in previous research.34 The left cathodic peak disappeared for MoP and Ni5P4, whereas the right anodic peak disappeared for MC. Clearly, phosphides and MC have their own defects. A composite (Ni5P4/C) was designed and formed by embedding Ni5P4 into MC, compensating for the defects of the phosphides and MC. As expected, for the Ni5P4/C electrode, two pairs of redox peaks were observed and this may be caused by the synergistic catalytic effect of Ni5P4 and carbon. On the one hand, in addition to the perfect CV profile, the cathodic current density (eqn (1)) of Ni5P4/C at low potential was higher than that of Pt. On the other hand, the ΔEp (peak to peak separation) of the left redox peak for Ni5P4/C was smaller than that of Pt. In theory, ΔEp varies inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks) and the ks value for Ni5P4/C can be considered as higher than that of Pt on the whole.35,36 Based on the CV results, we can deduce that MoP and Ni5P4 have a decent catalytic activity for the I3−/I− redox couple while Ni5P4/C is expected to perform as effectively as Pt. 3I2 + 2e− ⇄ 2I−3(1) I−3 + 2e− ⇄ 3I−(2)

3.2.2 Photovoltaic performance of the DSCs using MoP, Ni5P4, MC, Ni5P4/C, and Pt CEs. 

Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSCs using MoP, Ni5P4, MC, Ni5P4/C, and Pt CEs. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The MoP-DSC and Ni5P4-DSC yielded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.92% and 5.71%, respectively. The open circuit voltage (Voc) values of the two DSCs were 0.76 and 0.77 V, close to that of the Pt-DSC (0.78 V). The short circuit current density (Jsc) values were slightly lower than that of the Pt-DSC. The lower PCE can be ascribed to the low fill factor (FF) of the MoP-DSC and the Ni5P4-DSC, which stems from the low catalytic activities of the phosphides due to the large particle size and particle aggregation. If the two phosphide catalysts can be prepared in nanoscale size without aggregation, the performance of the DSCs may improve significantly. As a comparative experiment, pure MC was used as the CE in a DSC, and a PCE of 7.01% was obtained. When Ni5P4/C was used as the CE, the DSC showed a high PCE of 7.54%, which was close to the performance of the Pt-DSC (7.76%). An improvement of 32% in the photovoltaic performance was achieved for the Ni5P4/C-DSC compared with the Ni5P4-DSC. The high performance of the Ni5P4/C-DSC may be attributed to the synergistic catalytic effect of the composite CE. Similar results have been achieved for Ni12P5/graphene, TiN/CNTs, and CoS/PEDOT composite electrodes as reported in previous studies.24,37,38

3.2.3 Electrochemical process of the MoP, Ni5P4 MC, Ni5P4/C, and Pt by EIS and Tafel-polarization tests. 
As a powerful tool to explore the electrochemical process, EIS has been widely used in testing the catalytic activity for the regeneration of a redox couple. In the present work, EIS was carried out with the symmetrical cells (SCs). Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots of the SCs using various CEs. Typically, the intercept on the real axis (high frequency) can be attributed to the series resistance (Rs). The left semicircle (middle frequency) can be assigned to the resistance capacitance networks of the electrode/electrolyte interface, including the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (Cμ). The right semicircle (low frequency) can be assigned to the diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple (I3−/I−) in the electrolyte. Based on previous research, internal resistance has a negative effect on the performance of DSCs.39

In the current research, the Rct values of MoP and Ni5P4 were 27.4 and 18.9 Ω, respectively. These values were larger than that of the Pt electrode, indicating that the two phosphides were not as efficient as Pt for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. By contrast, the Rct for MC was 5.3 Ω. When Ni5P4 was incorporated into MC, generating a Rct value of 2.2 Ω for Ni5P4/C, which was close to that of Pt (3.0 Ω), indicating a high catalytic activity. While the values of the ZN for the pure phosphide electrodes mentioned above were both larger than that of Pt, which corresponded to a slower diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte according to eqn (3). The disadvantage of Ni5P4/C was the relatively large ZN, the major cause of the slightly lower efficiency of the DSC using the Ni5P4/C CE compared with that of the DSC using the Pt CE, although the ZN value decreased dramatically for Ni5P4/C compared with pure Ni5P4. The Cμ values of the four Pt-free electrodes were much larger than that of the Pt electrode, indicating a large surface area.40 Based on the comprehensive consideration of EIS data, the key issue for the high catalytic activity of Ni5P4/C compared to Ni5P4 is the declination of Rct value from 18.9 to 2.2 Ω. The EIS parameters are summarized in Table 1. (3)where W (Warburg parameter) = ; KN = D/δ2, D is the diffusion constant of I3−; C is the concentration of I3−; n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction; k is the Boltzmann constant; e is the elementary charge; and δ is the thickness of the diffusion layer.
Tafel-polarization measurement was used in the experiment to confirm the catalytic activity of the phosphide CE catalysts. Theoretically, the Tafel curve can be divided into three zones. The curve at low potential (|U| < 120 mV) can be attributed to the polarization zone, the curve at intermediate potential (with a sharp slope) can be attributed to the Tafel zone, and the curve at high potential (horizontal part) can be attributed to the diffusion zone. In the latter two zones, information on the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) was indicated, which was closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalysts.
In Fig. 6, the Tafel curves of the SCs similar to the ones used in the EIS measurements showed the logarithmic of J as a function of U. In the diffusion zone, the Jlim of the MoP, Ni5P4, MC, Ni5P4/C, and Pt electrodes were observed to be of the same magnitude. According to eqn (4), Jlim varies with the diffusion coefficient (D). This finding indicated that similar diffusion properties were available for these catalysts in the electrolyte. In the Tafel zone, the curves of MoP and Ni5P4 exhibited gentler slopes demonstrating a low J0 on the surfaces of the electrodes compared with that on the surfaces of the Pt electrode. This result indicated that MoP and Ni5P4 were not effective for catalyzing the reduction of I3− compared with Pt. For Ni5P4/C, a large J0 close to that of Pt was observed, giving a high catalytic activity. The Tafel-polarization results were consistent with the EIS and J–V results. (4)where D is the diffusion coefficient of I3−, l is the spacer thickness, C is the I3− concentration, NA is Avogadro's constant, and e and n have their usual meanings.

3.3 Catalytic activity of the MC, Ni5P4, Ni5P4/C, and Pt for the organic T2/T− redox couple

3.3.1 Photovoltaic performance of the DSCs using MC, Ni5P4, Ni5P4/C, and Pt CEs. 
I3−/I− is the dominant redox couple in DSCs. However, I3−/I− has disadvantages, such as the absorption of visible light, the sublimation of I2, and corrosive effects with various metals (Ag, Au, among others). Given these disadvantages, several new redox couples have been introduced in DSCs to replace I3−/I−, such as 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole-N-tetramethylammonium salt/di-5-(1-methyltetrazole) disulfide (T2/T−, Fig. S2†).41
In this paper, MC, Ni5P4, and Ni5P4/C were used in the regeneration of the new organic redox couple, T2/T−, and the DSCs using MC, Ni5P4, and Pt CEs showed PCEs of 4.40, 3.87, and 3.38%, respectively (Fig. 7 and Table S1†). Ni5P4 showed a slightly higher catalytic activity for the regeneration of the T2/T− redox couple compared with Pt. By contrast, Ni5P4/C was more effective than Pt, as previously reported.21,25,32 The DSC using the Ni5P4/C CE yielded a high PCE of 4.75%, an improvement of 41% compared with the Pt-based DSC. The advantage of Ni5P4/C for the T2/T− redox couple was more significant than that of the I3−/I− redox couple.

3.3.2 Electrochemical process of MC, Ni5P4, Ni5P4/C, and Pt by EIS for the organic T2/T− redox couple. 

Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots of the Ni5P4, Ni5P4/C, MC, and Pt-SCs using T2/T− as redox couple. The Rct values of the MC, Ni5P4, and Pt were 18.7, 40.3, and 42.5 Ω, respectively, indicating that Ni5P4 had a slightly higher catalytic activity than Pt for T2/T−. By contrast, the Rct value (13.5 Ω) of Ni5P4/C was lower than both MC and Ni5P4. Besides, compared with Ni5P4, Ni5P4/C has a lower ZN. The EIS data indicated that Ni5P4/C performed the best amongst these materials and the EIS parameters are summarized in Table S1.† In this process, compared with Pt, these new catalysts were found to be suitable for the regeneration of the T2/T− redox couple rather than the conventional I3−/I− redox couple, which agreed with the J–V results. Thus, to develop low-cost and highly efficient DSCs, the fitness issue of the CE catalysts and the redox couples should be considered.

3.3.3 CV measurements of MC, Ni5P4, and Ni5P4/C for the organic T2/T− redox couple. 

Fig. 9 shows the cyclic voltammogram of these electrodes for the T2/T− redox couple. One pair of redox peaks was observed for all electrodes. The current density of Ni5P4 was slightly higher than that of Pt, while the invertibility of Ni5P4 was worse than Pt. In the case of MC, the current density was higher than that of Pt, and the invertibility was as good as Pt, resulting in a higher catalytic activity. For Pt, the potentials of the redox peaks were around −0.40 and 0.47 V, and the ΔEp (Pt) was 0.87 V. Compared with Pt, the cathodic peaks for Ni5P4/C shifted towards a more positive value (−0.20 V), whereas the anodic peaks shifted towards a more negative value (0.40 V). Thus, the ΔEp for Ni5P4/C is just 0.60 V. According to the Nernst equation, for the T2/T− reaction, if 55 ≤ ΔEp ≤ 65 mV, the electrode can be considered to be reversible. Moreover, as pointed out above, ΔEp varied inversely with ks.35,36 Ni5P4/C showed a larger ks value than that of Pt, which was favorable for a high catalytic activity. Besides, the current densities of Ni5P4/C are much higher than those of Pt. An overall consideration of the CV results indicates that Ni5P4 has a decent catalytic activity and Ni5P4/C is more effective than Pt for the regeneration of the T2/T− redox couple. The high catalytic activity of Ni5P4/C for T2/T− can be ascribed to the following basic reasons: (1) the intrinsic high catalytic activity of Ni5P4/C, (2) the synergistic catalytic effect of Ni5P4 and mesoporous carbon, (3) the improvement of conductivity of Ni5P4/C by combining Ni5P4 with mesoporous carbon, (4) the large porosity of Ni5P4/C which is beneficial for T2/T− electrolyte diffusion. Finally, Fig. 10 showed that after 10 cycles of CV test of the Ni5P4/C electrode for the T2/T− electrolyte, no current density decline and peak shifts were observed. This finding demonstrates that Ni5P4/C and T2/T− species can coexist in the long run.22

4. Conclusion
MoP, Ni5P4, and Ni5P4/C were introduced into the DSC systems as CE catalysts for the regeneration of the I3−/I− and T2/T− redox couples. MoP and Ni5P4 showed decent catalytic activity for the I3−/I− redox couple. Also, the catalytic activity can be improved significantly when Ni5P4 and mesoporous carbon were combined into one composite (Ni5P4/C). The advantage of Ni5P4/C for the T2/T− redox couple was more significant than that of the I3−/I− redox couple. The T2/T− based DSC using a Ni5P4/C CE yielded a high PCE of 4.75%, which was much higher than that of the DSC using a Pt CE (3.38%). In the process of developing low-cost but highly efficient CE catalysts, the fitness issue of the CE catalysts and redox couples should be considered.
