In this work, we designed and synthesized a new acceptor BCPT-4F, incorporating a CPT fused central backbone. BCPT-4F shows a redshift absorption in the near-infrared region compared with CPT based acceptors with an unfused backbone. Importantly, the photovoltaic device based on PBDB-T:BCPT-4F achieved a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.43% with a high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.96 mA cm−2. Furthermore, based on the above binary device, a ternary device with F-Br as the third component achieved a high PCE of 14.23%, which is presently the highest efficiency for devices with CPT based photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, much enthusiasm has been focused on organic photovoltaics (OPVs) due to their outstanding characteristics such as flexibility, low cost, low weight, etc.1–4 Presently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPV cells have reached over 16% for single junction devices and over 17% for tandem cells.5–15 This impressive progress can be mainly attributed to the rational molecular design and device optimization. In particular, the intensive study on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in recent years has directly pushed forward the progress of OPVs since NFAs have advantages of easy control of absorption and energy levels in contrast with the classic fullerene acceptors. Among various types of NFAs, molecules with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture and fused molecular backbones have been widely studied and demonstrated big success.16–20 To date, many fused backbones composed of different building blocks have been designed for the A–D–A NFA design from the perspective of absorption, energy levels, packing mode, etc.21–23
The cyclopentadithiophene (CPT) unit is a classic unit for constructing organic semiconductors such as donor polymers due to its unique electronic properties and chemical structure.24–26 Firstly, it is an excellent electron rich unit with strong electron donating ability. Secondly, the side-chains attached on its sp3-carbon atoms could provide effective hindrance to prevent molecular excessive self-aggregation.27,28 With this, CPT based acceptors have also been designed and showed promising efficiencies. For example, Chen et al. reported a series of CPT based acceptors with unfused structures, in which a DFPCIC based device achieved a promising PCE of 10.14% with a Jsc of 15.66 mA cm−2.29 Recently, Bo and coworkers have designed and synthesized an acceptor, DOC2C6-2F, incorporating a CPT unit, which showed a similar unfused backbone compared with DFPCIC and exhibited an absorption covering 600–900 nm.30 When blended with PBDB-T, the DOC2C6-2F based device achieved a PCE of 13.24% with a Jsc of 21.35 mA cm−2. Other CPT based acceptors have also been reported with promising device performance around 10%.31 With the absorption edge below 900 nm, those unfused-ring core based acceptors incorporating CPT showed relatively lower Jsc, which limited further improvement of PCEs. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that A–D–A molecules with a fused electron-donating core and strong electron acceptor end groups show strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects, which could lead to red-shifted absorptions and help to improve the Jsc of OPV devices.32 However, the fused backbone strategy has rarely been employed for the design of small molecule acceptors fused with a CPT unit.30,31,33,34
Based on the above analysis, herein, we have designed and synthesized an A–D–A acceptor, BCPT-4F, with a molecular backbone fused with two CPT units with a phenyl core (Fig. 1a and b). The fluorinated 3-(dicyanomethylidene)-indan-1-one was used as the electron-withdrawing end group. BCPT-4F has a low optical band gap of 1.32 eV with a near-infrared region (NIR) film absorption from 600 to 1000 nm. Compared with its analogous CPT base unfused molecules counterparts, BCPT-4F has an extended conjugated length and red shifted absorption.29,30,34 When blended with the wide band gap polymer donor PBDB-T, the BCPT-4F based device exhibited a PCE of 12.43% with a Jsc of 22.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.776 V and an FF of 0.698. Based on the above binary device, a ternary device was fabricated employing a middle band gap acceptor F-Br we reported previously.35 After device optimization, a high PCE of 14.23% with the simultaneously increased Jsc of 24.88 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.806 V, and FF of 0.709 was obtained, which is the highest efficiency to date for devices with CPT based photovoltaic materials (Fig. 2a and Table S3†).

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for BCPT-4F is shown in Scheme 1. Starting from 4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene 1, we synthesized 2-(4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane 3. Note, two methyl groups are used as side chains on the CPT sp3 carbon in order to alleviate the hindrance in the following fused ring reaction from 4 to 5 since it could not succeed if general octyl chains were used in our lab. Finally, the targeted product BCPT-4F was obtained by Knoevenagel condensation between 6 and 2F-IC. BCPT-4F exhibited good solubility in common solvents like chloroform and chlorobenzene. The detailed synthesis steps and characterization methods including 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are showed in the ESI.† The thermal properties of BCPT-4F were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (ESI, Fig. S11†) under a nitrogen atmosphere. This indicates that BCPT-4F exhibits good thermal stability with a weight loss lower than 5% up to 364 °C.

The solid neat film absorption spectrum for BCPT-4F is presented in Fig. 1c. Because of the enhanced ICT effect, BCPT-4F demonstrated strong absorption in the wavelength range from 600 to 1000 nm. It red-shifted by 57 nm in contrast to its solution absorption spectrum (Fig. S12†), suggesting that effective intermolecular interactions occurred in the solid film. Compared with unfused CPT based acceptors, BCPT-4F exhibited manifest redshifted absorption with a peak at 860 nm in the film (Table 1).29,33,36 From the film absorption onset (∼940 nm), the optical band gap of BCPT-4F was calculated to be 1.32 eV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to check the energy levels of the acceptor. As calculated from the onset of oxidative and reductive peaks in CV curves (Fig. S13†), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of BCPT-4F were determined to be −5.36 and −3.91 eV, respectively.

2.2 Device structure and photovoltaic properties
The OSC devices with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PFN-Br/PBDB-T:NFA/MoOx/Ag (Fig. 2b) were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance using BCPT-4F as an acceptor. The wide-band gap polymer PBDB-T was selected as a donor due to its matched energy levels and complementary absorption with BCPT-4F.28 Detailed device fabrication and optimization conditions, such as donor/acceptor weight ratio and thermal annealing temperature are provided in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are displayed in Fig. 2c, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. When blended with PBDB-T, BCPT-4F based devices exhibit the best PCE of 12.43%, with a high Jsc of 22.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.776 V and an FF of 0.698 (Fig. 2c). The high Jsc of the device compared to that of the unfused CPT based molecules is attributed to the redshifted UV-vis absorption.36,37

A ternary device is a feasible and easy method to further improve the performance of the binary device.5,38–40 Recently, our group reported a middle band gap molecule F-Br with an absorption spectrum located in the range of 550–750 nm.35 As shown in Fig. 1c, F-Br shows complementary absorption with that of PBDB-T and BPCT-4F. Meanwhile, the PBDB-T:F-Br device delivered an efficiency over 11% with an outstanding FF of 0.74. In order to further improve the device performance, we fabricated ternary devices using F-Br as the third component. While systematically optimizing the ratio of F-Br and BCPT-4F, a best PCE of 14.23% is achieved with a Jsc of 24.88 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.806 V and an FF of 0.709, when 50 wt% of F-Br was added (PBDB-T:F-Br:BCPT-4F = 1:0.5:0.5 in weight), which is presently the highest efficiency for devices with CPT based photovoltaic materials. Compared to the host binary device, the ternary device exhibited improved Jsc, Voc and FF, simultaneously (Table 2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 2d. The PBDB-T:BCPT-4F based binary device featured broad EQE values covering 300 to 940 nm. In contrast, PBDB-T:BCPT-4F:F-Br based ternary devices exhibited an enhanced EQE response with values over 70% in the region of 500–850 nm, suggesting that the ternary device featured a more efficient charge transfer between the donor and acceptor. The integral current density values calculated from the EQE curves of PBDB-T:BCPT-4F and PBDB-T:BCPT-4F:F-Br (1:0.5:0.5) were 22.30 mA cm−2 and 24.22 mA cm−2, respectively, which are well in agreement with the Jsc from J–V measurements with deviations within 3%.
To probe the exciton/charge dynamics of the binary and ternary devices, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) to study charge generation, dissociation, and extraction properties (Fig. 2e). Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in the dark. Veff = Vo − Va, where Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero.41,42 As depicted in Fig. 2e, Jph increased with a rise in Veff and when Veff arrived at ∼2 V, Jph values for all the devices reached saturation (Jsat), indicating that the charge recombination of the devices is minimized at a higher voltage due to the high internal electric field in the devices. We also adopted the values of Jph/Jsat to estimate the charge dissociation and charge collection probability (P(E, T)) in the devices. Under maximal power output conditions, the P(E, T) were calculated to be 93% for the BCPT-4F based binary device and 94% for the ternary device. The improved value of the ternary device compared to the BCPT-4F based binary device indicated a better charge dissociation and collection of the ternary device.
To study the charge recombination in the devices, the light-intensity dependence (P) of Jsc was measured. According to the equation of Jsc ∝ Pα, the power-law exponent α implies the extent of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 2f, slopes of 0.908 and 0.959 were obtained for the BCPT-4F binary and ternary based devices, respectively. The ternary device showed the highest α values compared to the two binary devices, implying less bimolecular recombination in the ternary devices. It is consistent with the promoted EQE value and high Jsc of the ternary device. As shown in Fig. S16,† the Voc is linearly dependent on the natural logarithm of light intensity with slopes of 1.27kT/q and 1.23kT/q for the binary and ternary devices, respectively, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin and q is the elementary charge. Generally, a deviation of the slope from kT/q reflects defect-assisted recombination in the devices.43 The small slopes implied low trap density and weak trap-assistant recombination in the BCPT-4F based devices, especially in the ternary device. Furthermore, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to study the charge transport properties of electron-only and hole-only devices.44 As shown in Fig. S17,† the calculated electron and hole mobilities for the PBDB-T:BCPT-4F based devices are 2.85 × 10−4 and 4.54 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After adding 50 wt% F-Br, the ternary blend film achieved a higher electron mobility of 3.63 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility of 3.76 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 simultaneously. Despite the hole mobility decreasing, a balanced μh/μe was achieved, which is favourable for the overall charge collection and thus improved the FF, consistent with the device performance.
2.3 Morphology characterization
We employed grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to gain further insight into the molecular stacking and orientation of the binary and ternary blend films (Fig. 3a, b and S18†). As can be seen in Fig. S18,†BCPT-4F exhibits a clear π–π stacking diffraction peak (010) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a lamellar diffraction peak (100) in the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting that the BCPT-4F neat film has a preferred face-on orientation relative to the substrate. Note that neat film of PBDB-T revealed a preferred face-on orientation, which is beneficial to charge transport. Out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cut profiles of GIWAXS for the binary and ternary blend films are presented in Fig. 3c and d. For binary blend films, the PBDB-T:BCPT-4F blend film exhibited two (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP (0.96 and 1.77 Å−1) and one (100) in the IP (0.29 Å−1) direction. All these diffraction peaks for the blend films implied face on orientation and good molecular packing. As for the ternary blend film (PBDB-T:BCPT-4F:F-Br = 1:0.5:0.5), the (100) diffraction peaks were located at 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction and the (010) diffraction peaks were located at 0.93 and 1.79 Å−1 in the OOP direction. And the π–π stacking distances (dπ) were calculated to be 3.55 and 3.51 Å for the BCPT-4F based binary and ternary devices, respectively. From the Scherrer equation,45 the crystal coherence length (CCL) in the (010) diffraction direction was estimated to be 20.49 Å for the BCPT-4F binary blend film, and 23.86 Å for the ternary device. The increased CCL and smaller dπ of the ternary blend film compared to the binary BCPT-4F blend film indicated that the introduction of a strong crystalline component, F-Br leads to more ordered molecular packing and a preferred morphology in the ternary device. The improved morphology with the addition of the third component F-Br has a positive effect on the charge dissociation and transport for the ternary device compared with the binary device, which is consistent with the increase of FF and Jsc, as discussed above.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a new acceptor BCPT-4F with a CPT fused backbone has been successfully designed and synthesized. Compared with non-fused analogous molecules, BCPT-4F possessed redshifted absorption with an onset around 1000 nm and a low band gap of 1.32 eV. The binary device based on PBDB-T:BCPT-4F achieved a PCE of 12.43%. A ternary device with F-Br as the third component was fabricated and achieved a PCE of 14.23% with a simultaneously improved Voc of 0.806 eV, Jsc of 24.88 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.709, and is presently the highest efficiency for devices with CPT based photovoltaic materials. These comprehensively improved parameters can be ascribed to the suppressed bimolecular recombination, improved charge dissociation and collection efficiency, balanced charge transport and the reduction of intermixing domain size. The results offer valuable insight into the new active layer-molecule design for higher performance OPVs.
