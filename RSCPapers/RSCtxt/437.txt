    , Accepted 16th June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractOwing to the sluggish water oxidation process, unearthing an ideal model for disclosing the impact of an architectural approach on the water oxidation activity of photocatalysts becomes a vital issue. Here, we propose an innovative in situ modification strategy for constructing ultrapure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (u-BVG) toward the accelerated photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. Considering the Mott–Schottky heterojunctions at the contact interface in u-BVG, the feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene facilitates the holes to migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation reaction. Compared with the conventional synthesis strategies, our strategy avoids the introduction of Cl impurities. This modification allows for not only a ca. 0.1 eV deeper valence band edge position to generate holes with a stronger oxidation potential but the extraction of the impurity level to suppress the carrier recombination. And density functional theory calculations are in accordance with the above results. Impressively, these merits endow the u-BVG with ca. 16.8 times growth in the amount of ˙OH radicals derived from OH−/H2O oxidation, an over 260% enhancement in O2 yield and a 1.6-fold increase in the apparent quantum efficiency relative to the impure counterpart. This work paves the way for the reconstruction of graphene-based binary systems with high performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
Introduction
For the ever-growing global energy demand, solar-driven water splitting is an intriguing approach for solar-to-chemical energy conversion,1–3i.e., solar-driven catalysis, to produce molecular hydrogen and oxygen.4–6 The bottleneck for overall water splitting is the water oxidation half-reaction, which is especially sluggish due to its high energy barriers and complex process caused by multistep four-electron transfer, in comparison with the water reduction half-reaction.4,5,7 To date, though the most widely studied metal oxides – CoOx, WO3, and Fe2O3 – have been exploited in the water oxidation reaction,8–10 a widely accepted speculation is that the activity of these photocatalysts still falls short of expectations owing to their limited light-harvesting efficiency, and/or poor carrier separation capacity, and/or shallow valence band (VB) positions.11,12 Therefore, it is urgent and imperative to unearth novel water oxidation photocatalysts with sufficient activity to accelerate the water splitting process.
As promising candidates, bismuth nanomaterials have desirable conversion efficiency due to their ability to absorb visible light, the visible-light energy is equal to half of the entire solar energy (i.e., ca. 7% ultraviolet light, ca. 50% visible light and ca. 43% infrared light).13 And their perovskite-type layer structure tends to overcome the reaction barriers. In addition, they exhibit the advantages of possessing a suitable band structure, and being earth-abundant and non-toxic.14–18 Accordingly, various bismuth nanomaterials, particularly ternary metal oxide bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), have sparked tremendous interests. To boost the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4, two negative factors should be specifically addressed – the limited active sites and the weak carrier transfer property.19,20 In this respect, coupling with graphene has been attempted for alleviating these negative factors. As an aromatic macromolecule, graphene with a large specific surface is selected as the matrix material to provide sufficient active sites, besides acting as a “highway” for shuttling carriers owing to the abundance of delocalized electrons from the conjugated sp2-bonded carbon network.21,22 Despite the benefits of a graphene matrix, impurities derived from the hydrolysis of common precursor bismuth salts (e.g., BiCl3, Bi(NO3)3, Bi(CH3COO)3, etc.) always exist in BiVO4 during the in situ growth process of BiVO4 on graphene; hence the intrinsic limitations of BiVO4 as well as the sluggish water oxidation process still could not be essentially resolved.
To date, the challenge of how to further boost the photocatalytic activity of graphene-based BiVO4 binary systems is yet to be overcome; hence two challenging issues are primarily listed below: (i) Maintaining the intimate contacts of systems. Aiming at promoting carrier transfer, the formation of chemical bonds between the BiVO4 surface and the graphene surface is quite difficult.19,23 However, it is more difficult to break the intrinsic limitations of BiVO4 on graphene through an in situ method without compromising their intimate contacts and structural integrity. (ii) Preventing impurity formation. As precursors for BiVO4 preparation, bismuth salts tend to hydrolyze into many insoluble basic salts.22 Consequently, certain anions derived from these basic salts always compete with and partially substitute VO3− anions, forming impurities and disrupting the intrinsic band structure,24 which severely impedes their practical implementation.
Among the various methods explored to accomplish the challenging issues mentioned above, noteworthy is the surfactant-assisted synthesis that has hitherto been explored to offer the following two solutions: (i) Constructing an optimal binary system. The intimate contacts in the binary system are maintained by surfactants to some extent. Meanwhile, the blocking effect of surfactants also leads to a well-controlled morphology.10 (ii) Developing a unique reaction path. Prepared by reactive surfactants with inorganic species under appropriate conditions, the lamellar surfactant/inorganic composite precursors favor the formation of crystalline nanomaterials.25,26 However, even if these studies improved the understanding of the activity of photocatalysts in a specific aspect, their results could still not be applied to graphene-based BiVO4 binary systems. Given the applicability and superiority of surfactant-assisted synthesis, we aim to tackle the intrinsic limitations of BiVO4 on graphene via the deliberate introduction of surfactants, thus, overcoming the sluggishness for the water oxidation reaction. An alternative solution, an in situ modification (ISM) strategy, is hypothesized to fully exploit the advantages of surfactants for the current binary systems.
Herein, we initially considered the graphene-based monoclinic-BiVO4 binary system as a prototype, considering that the monoclinic phase is generally promising for photocatalytic water oxidation over the other two phases.27 Compared with the conventional synthesis strategies, we first developed a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-assisted ISM strategy to obtain ultrapure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (u-BVG) for triggering photocatalytic water oxidation. To disclose the correlation between the effect of the ISM strategy and the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of u-BVG, a systematic investigation into the morphologies, structures, optical and electronic properties, and photocatalytic activity was carried out, supplemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, the ISM strategy endows the u-BVG with a stronger ˙OH radical signal than its impure counterpart in the molecular oxygen activation measurement, an enhancement in O2 yield of over 260% and a 1.6-fold increase in the apparent quantum efficiency, compared with its impure counterpart.
Experimental
Material synthesis
All starting chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. In a typical synthesis of ultrapure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (namely, u-BVG), a sol–gel solution containing 100 mg of graphene oxide (GO) was prepared according to a previous study,28 and the solution was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water under ultrasonic treatment to obtain a brown suspension. Then, 631 mg of BiCl3 and 400 mg of CTAB were dissolved into the suspension by stirring for 4 h. Soon afterwards, 234 mg of NH4VO3 was dissolved into the suspension and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, excess 5 M aqueous ethanolamine was added into this suspension until the pH reached 10, and then the pH was adjusted to 6.2 by adding 2 M hydrochloric acid, to obtain a yellowish-brown colloid solution. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed in a steel tank, and heated in an oven at 160 °C for 12 h. Upon being cooled to room temperature, the product was centrifuged, washed five times with deionized water and ethanol, and collected during the freeze-drying process for further treatment and characterization. In contrast, the counterpart prepared under the same conditions but without the introduction of CTAB was denoted as impure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (namely, i-BVG).
Material characterization
The crystal phase was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max 2550VL/PC system operated at 35 kV and 200 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were recorded by using a LabRAM HR Laser Micro-Raman spectrometer at 514 nm and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Mg Kα (hv = 1253.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source. The binding energies were referred to as the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) from adventitious carbon. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra were obtained on a JEOL JSM-6360LV electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were carried out on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F electron microscope, using a carbon-coated copper grid. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined using nitrogen adsorption apparatus. Room-temperature UV-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 750S UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a 60 mm Hitachi integrating sphere accessory, using BaSO4 as a reference. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer in KBr tablets. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired at room temperature on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Elexsys E580 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer at room temperature by utilizing 5,5-dimethyl-L-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin-trapping reagent.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Transient photocurrent responses and electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in a standard three-electrode cell system on a CHI 600E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China) with a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 7.0) as the electrolyte. In this system, indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate was treated by 1 M NaOH solution and cleaned in ethanol and water, respectively. Subsequently, the cleaned ITO glass substrate deposited with the above samples, platinum wires, and Ag/AgCl electrodes in saturated KCl solution were used as working electrodes, counter electrodes, and reference electrodes, respectively. For preparing a working electrode, 10 mg of sample and 500 μl of 5 wt% Nafion solution were dispersed in 5 mL of water–ethanol solution (Vwater/Vethanol = 1/4) to form a homogeneous slurry, which was then dropped and spin-coated onto a 1.0 cm × 2.5 cm ITO glass substrate and exposed to air for 5 h to dry. Total working electrodes were prepared using the above process with the same concentration, coating time, and coating area, to achieve the same loading for all samples. The transient photocurrent responses of samples as visible light switched on and off were measured at a constant potential of 0.6 V, obtained from a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-filter. EIS measurements were carried out under a constant potential of 0.6 V from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz without light illumination, and the amplitude of the applied sine wave potential in each case was 5 mV. The above measurements were carried out at room temperature.
Activity evaluations
The photocatalytic water oxidation activity of the as-obtained products was tested with a PLS-SXE300 Labsolar-6A closed gas-circulation system (Perfectlight, China) in sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation from a 300 W xenon lamp (Perfectlight, China) coupled with a 420 nm cut-filter (i.e., λ > 420 nm). In a typical process, 30 mg of photocatalyst was poured into 50 mL of 0.15 M Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solution in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel equipped with a quartz lid (Perfectlight, China) at ca. 5 °C as controlled by recirculating cooling water. Subsequently, the entire reaction setup was thoroughly degassed to remove air, and then the reaction system was magnetically stirred and irradiated under visible light. Ultimately the amount of O2 evolved was qualitatively analyzed using a GC7890II gas chromatograph (Techcomp, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (5 Å molecular sieve column, He carrier gas, column temperature at 60 °C, inlet temperature at 110 °C and test temperature at 120 °C). All peaks were examined against the corresponding standards, and each experiment was conducted three times in parallel to obtain an average value.
Apparent quantum efficiency measurements
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions, except for inserting an appropriate band-pass filter (420, 450, 475, 500, 520 nm, λ ± 10 nm at 10% of peak height) in front of a 300 W xenon lamp. For these tests, the photointensity was measured at eight different points to obtain an average intensity using a PL-MW2000 optical power meter (Perfectlight, China). AQE was calculated using the following formula:29  where α = 4 for the O2 evolution reaction, M (μmol) is the amount of O2, NA (mol−1) is the Avogadro constant, h (J s) is the Planck constant, c (m s−1) is the speed of light, S (cm2) is the irradiation area, P (mW cm−2) is the intensity of the irradiation, t (h) is the photoreaction time and λ (nm) is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.
Density functional theory calculations
Density functional theory calculations were carried out using the plane-wave and pseudopotential based Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),30,31 based on GGA+U with the functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).32 The electron-nuclei interactions were described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method of Blöchl33 implemented by Kresse and Joubert.34 A plane wave cutoff energy of 520 eV was adopted, and the partial occupancies were treated using the tetrahedron methodology with Blöchl corrections.35 The BiVO4 (001) slab was constructed from the primitive cell of the monoclinic-BiVO4 structure,36 with 8 layers of cations and a vacuum region of about 10 Å in thickness, leading to 48 atoms in the slab model. The Cl-doped slab was constructed by adding Cl atoms on top of the surficial Bi atoms. For integration within the Brillouin zone, a 5 × 5 × 1 Γ-centered grid was used. The geometry optimization was converged to a residual force of less than 0.01 eV Å−1 on the relaxed atoms.
Results and discussion
Generally, the formation of crystals inevitably involves the precipitation process of a solid phase from the solution, which consists of a nucleation step followed by a growth step.37 Under the conventional synthesis conditions, both the BiO+ cations derived from the hydrolysis of BiCl3, which is denoted as an example of precursor bismuth salts, and the VO3− anions dissolve slightly in water to yield a BiVO4 crystal nucleus due to the electrostatic force, and then they transform into a metastable precipitate assembled on graphene oxide (GO).22,27 Afterwards, these metastable precipitates reconstruct and transform into BiVO4 crystals along with trace amounts of the BiOCl impurity phase on graphene during the hydrothermal process.22,24 In particular during the in situ growth process of BiVO4 on graphene, Cl− anions with a certain concentration would compete with and partially substitute VO3− anions, forming impure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (i-BVG). However, it has been reported that the polar groups ionized from the surfactant could interact with ions of opposite charges due to the electrostatic force and form an active center to accelerate the nucleation of crystals.38 In the self-assembly process of the CTAB-assisted synthesis case, the CTA+ cations ionized from the CTAB can bond with BiCl4− anions rather than forming micelles in aqueous solution,37,39 forming lamellar BiCl4−–CTA+ hybrid precursors on GO. After the addition of NH4VO3 followed by hydrothermal treatment, the VO3− anions would rapidly react with the Bi3+ cations in the lamellar BiCl4−–CTA+ hybrid precursors. Ultimately the BiVO4-based lamellar structures gradually self-exfoliate into the nucleating agent and develop into u-BVG (see the reaction mechanism in the ESI†).
As hypothesized, we highlight an innovative ISM strategy quite different from a conventional synthesis strategy, in which the newly introduced cationic surfactant CTAB modifies the in situ growth process of BiVO4 on graphene for constructing u-BVG. To visually demonstrate the difference between two synthetic strategies, a schematic illustration of the formation mechanism is displayed in Fig. 1. Unlike the conventional synthesis process, the CTA+ cations ionized from the CTAB firstly contribute to forming hybrid precursors BiCl4−–CTA+ on GO in a self-assembly step of the ISM process, and then forming an active center to accelerate the nucleation of the BiVO4 crystal on GO. To investigate the role of CTA+ cations, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) for intermediate products was performed, as shown in Fig. S1.† When KBr instead of CTAB was used as the Br source to attempt the synthesis of u-BVG, no lamellar structures were detected according to the SAXS patterns except for the diffraction peak of the (001) crystal plane of GO. When the cationic surfactant CTAB was involved in the synthesis rather than KBr, the lamellar BiCl4−–CTA+ hybrid precursors obtained during this self-assembly process were confirmed by the SAXS patterns. The peaks in the SAXS patterns can be indexed as the (001) and (002) diffractions of a lamellar mesophase,25 while also including the GO (001) crystal plane diffraction peak. Thus, the above analysis reveals that the CTA+ cations play an irreplaceable role during the ISM process. After the hydrothermal treatment, the VO3− anions react with the Bi3+ cations in the lamellar BiCl4−–CTA+ hybrid precursors, and the BiVO4-based lamellar structures gradually self-exfoliate into the nucleating agent and develop into graphene-based BiVO4 binary systems.

After the adoption of an ISM strategy, the physical structure of final products is totally depicted by the microstructure model and SEM and TEM images, as shown in Fig. 2. Both the SEM and TEM images reveal that the BiVO4 possessing a sheet-shaped morphology is well dispersed on graphene. Here the graphene appears as the wrinkles. Interestingly, the dimension of BiVO4 nanosheets in i-BVG is ca. 460 nm and that in u-BVG is ca. 170 nm (Fig. 2c–f). This difference indicates that the effect of the ISM strategy is intriguing to assist in the growth of the BiVO4 nanosheets with a smaller dimension on graphene. Namely, the dimension of BiVO4 nanosheets in u-BVG was dramatically reduced by the Coulomb repulsion forces and the hydrophobic chains of CTA+ cations.40 Furthermore, the crystal structure of final products is characterized by HRTEM. The inset of Fig. 2e demonstrates a lattice spacing of 2.55 Å for the (002) planes of monoclinic-BiVO4 as well as a lattice spacing of 2.75 Å for the (110) planes of tetragonal-BiOCl, manifesting that the i-BVG is constructed by monoclinic-BiVO4 and tetragonal-BiOCl. Meanwhile, the inset of Fig. 2f reveals that a lattice spacing of 2.55 Å agrees well only with the (002) planes of monoclinic-BiVO4. Regarding the crystal structure information, the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3a are both indexed to the monoclinic-BiVO4 (JCPDS No. 14-0688), except for impurities indexed to the tetragonal-BiOCl (JCPDS No. 06-0249) in i-BVG. This result is consistent with the above HRTEM images, for confirming the effect of the ISM strategy on the crystal structure.

Subsequently, the effect of the ISM strategy on the chemical status of the product surface is also surveyed. For the i-BVG, two Cl 2p peaks at 199.0 eV and 197.5 eV are observed, close to the binding energy of Cl 2p peaks in BiOCl (Fig. S2†), implying that Cl atoms are bonded with Bi atoms.24 This result also shows good agreement with the atomistic models based on DFT calculations (Fig. 5a and b). However, both EDS spectra and XPS spectra shown in Fig. S3b and S5a† confirm that the BiVO4 contains no Cl impurities in u-BVG. In addition, since the H+ cations that are slightly ionized from water substitute the CTA+ cations for maintaining the charge balance of u-BVG during the washing process,40 the CTA+ cations on the u-BVG could be easily removed by washing, further verified by the corresponding IR spectra and XPS spectra in Fig. S4a and b.† To further reveal the effect of the ISM strategy on both the phase structure of final products and the reduction degree of graphene, the Raman spectra have been recorded and are shown in Fig. 3b. For the i-BVG and the u-BVG, their Raman bands at 120, 207, 333, 363, and 818 cm−1 unambiguously observed are of the monoclinic-BiVO4,41,42 but the Raman signal representing Cl impurities is too weak to be detected. Moreover, both D bands (k-point phonons of the A1g symmetry) and G bands (E2g phonons of the C sp2 atoms) originate from the graphene, the lower D/G intensity ratio observed in two products (0.88 for u-BVG, 1.02 for i-BVG) than that in GO (1.10 for GO) indicates the GO with oxygen-containing residues is partially reduced, namely, the higher electric conductivity and charge transfer of the graphene after hydrothermal treatment are achieved.28
After this, XPS measurements were performed to analyze whether the necessary chemical interaction between the BiVO4 surface and the graphene surface was affected by the ISM process. The C 1s spectra of both GO and u-BVG are shown in Fig. 3c. In terms of the GO, its spectra can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.4 eV (CC bond), 286.6 eV (C–O bond), and 288.5 eV (CO bond), respectively.43 Compared with the GO, the u-BVG presents the peak representing the CO bond which remarkably disappears, and the peak at 284.8 eV (C–O bond) decreases, suggesting the removal of most oxygen-containing groups, which is consistent with the Raman results presented earlier. Besides, the above results are in accordance with the phenomenon that the lattice oxygen peak at 529.5 eV is much larger than the bridge oxygen peak at 530.2 eV in the O 1s spectra of u-BVG (Fig. S5d†), which indicates that the GO has an ideal reduction degree to facilitate carrier transfer.44,45 More interestingly, the C 1s spectra of u-BVG are overall shifted to the lower binding energy when compared with that of GO, which indicates the formation of chemical bonds between the C element and particular metal element (Bi or V) after hydrothermal treatment.22 Later the chemical bonds are further confirmed to be the V–C bonds, i.e., the two additional relatively weak peaks at the higher binding energies are observed in Fig. 3d, as reported previously.19,44 Furthermore, the peaks representing the V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 refer to V–O bonds. Hence, it is sure that the chemical bonds between the BiVO4 surface and the graphene surface are formed in both i-BVG and u-BVG. The XPS spectra of other elements in u-BVG are shown in Fig. S5b–d.†
As the distance between the BiVO4 (n-type semiconductor) and graphene (semimetal) in both products becomes short enough to be compared to the V–C bond length, i.e., the interatomic spacing, it proves the fact that the formation of the Mott–Schottky heterojunctions is no doubt based on the principle of solid-state physics.46,47 And thus there is electron transfer from graphene to BiVO4 over the Mott–Schottky heterojunctions at their contact interface due to the higher Fermi level of graphene than that of BiVO4.48,49 The electrons flow through the contact interface due to the Mott–Schottky effect until the Fermi level equilibrium is reached. As shown in Fig. 4d, this process leads to the overall upshift of both the conduction band (CB) (−0.92 eV for i-BVG and −0.93 eV for u-BVG) and the valence band (VB) positions (1.43 eV for i-BVG, 1.52 eV for u-BVG) compared with those of the freestanding monoclinic-BiVO4 reported previously,50 whose CB and VB positions are identified as −0.04 eV and 2.34 eV, respectively. In this case, a high-conductivity region that is referred to as the space charge region appears within the BiVO4. Note that the physical property of the space charge region is different from that inside,51,52 there are the downward bent bands and the internal electric field in this region. Once the BiVO4 absorbs photons to produce electron–hole pairs, the electrons are excited to the CB, leaving the holes in the VB. Then the thermodynamically feasible electron transfer from the CB of BiVO4 to the Fermi level of graphene is also driven by the local electric field at their contact interface, while the holes, in turn, migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation reaction. Accordingly, the ISM process should not affect the electron transfer process over the Mott–Schottky heterojunctions in the current binary systems.

These dashed lines mark the baselines and the tangents, and the intersection value of the tangent with the baseline gives the position of the valence band edge. (d) Experimental energy band structure diagram based on the optical band gap and the position of the valence band edge. 
Motivated by the successful construction of u-BVG, the following study evaluates how this modification acts on the electronic structure. Of note, it has been generally accepted that the energy band structure of photocatalysts greatly affects their activity. Thermodynamically, while the VB edge position moves to more positive energy, the oxidation ability of VB holes increases more, especially for similar photocatalytic systems.4,53,54 The photoresponse range of both u-BVG and i-BVG is revealed by UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4a); their steep shapes indicate that the visible-light absorption band is assigned to the band gap transition.55 The i-BVG has a very slight red-shift relative to the u-BVG, which is in agreement with the corresponding color change from bright green to dark green (inset digital photograph in Fig. 4a). This phenomenon suggests the difference in their energy band structures. The optical band gap of a semiconductor can be estimated from the Tauc plot (i.e., the curve of converted (αhv)rversus hv from the UV-Vis spectra, where α, h, and v are the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, and light frequency, respectively, and r = 2 for a direct band gap semiconductor but r = 1/2 for an indirect band gap semiconductor). Fig. 4b shows a good linear fit when using r = 2, in accord with the previous report claiming BiVO4 to be a direct band gap semiconductor.37 The optical band gap of the u-BVG is calculated to be 2.45 eV and a bit larger than that of i-BVG (2.35 eV) shown in Fig. 4b; hence they are both perfectly suitable for a visible-light-driven photocatalytic reaction. To determine the positions of the band edge, we recorded XPS valence band spectra to measure their VB edge positions as shown in Fig. 4c, here the VB edge position of the u-BVG is +1.52 eV and is deeper than that of the i-BVG (+1.43 eV). On the basis of the optical band gap in Fig. 4b and the measured VB edge position in Fig. 4c, the approximate band edge positions of both u-BVG and i-BVG were drawn versus a normal hydrogen electrode (pH = 7) in Fig. 4d and thus both products possess the ability to oxidize water. In particular, in view of successfully avoiding the introduction of Cl impurities, the u-BVG with the ca. 0.1 eV deeper VB edge position would generate holes with a thermodynamically stronger oxidation potential than that in the i-BVG, namely, the implementation of the ISM strategy makes u-BVG become a potential water oxidation photocatalyst.
To further identify the impact of Cl impurities, the electronic band structures of both the impure monoclinic-BiVO4 and the ultrapure monoclinic-BiVO4 were theoretically examined via DFT calculations (Fig. 5e–f), whereas the atomistic models and the total and partial densities of states (DOS) are shown in Fig. 5a–d. Although DFT calculations are known to generally underestimate the band gap, they provide valuable insights into the physicochemical properties of materials.40 As shown in Fig. 5c and d, it turned out that for the impure monoclinic-BiVO4 in i-BVG, the CB originates dominantly from the V 3d orbital, while the VB is mainly composed of the Bi 6s, O 2p, and Cl 2p orbitals. For the ultrapure monoclinic-BiVO4 in u-BVG, the CB is also dominated by the V 3d orbital, but the VB is dominated by both Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals. Despite their similar conduction band minimum (CBM), the Cl 2p orbital introduces an impurity level right above the intrinsic valence band maximum (VBM) of monoclinic-BiVO4 (Fig. 5e), responding to the shallower VBM of the impure monoclinic-BiVO4 in i-BVG.

(b) The atomistic model, (d) the total and partial DOS and (f) the corresponding electronic band structures of ultrapure monoclinic-BiVO4 in u-BVG. Here the VBM and CBM levels are both indicated by arrows, and E–ECBM indicates that the CBM level is shifted as the zero energy. 
We therefore conducted a string of control experiments to examine the carrier dynamics of both products. PL spectra were acquired to study the pathways of photogenerated carriers. As shown in Fig. 6a, the i-BVG exhibits a much higher fluorescence intensity than the u-BVG in the range of 400–600 nm, even bonding with graphene which is supposed to facilitate the carrier separation and transfer. Considering the only difference between these two binary systems, it is logical to deduce that the shallower impurity level induced by the Cl 2p orbital most likely becomes the recombination center of excitons. Therefore, the ISM process hinders the formation of carrier recombination traps induced by Cl impurities. Furthermore, the carrier dynamics is investigated by transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 6b shows the comparison of photocurrent intensity between u-BVG and i-BVG, and it can be seen that the photocurrent intensity of u-BVG is 3 times more than that of i-BVG, manifesting the ultrafast carrier separation and transfer of u-BVG. As for the decrease of the photocurrent intensity on the u-BVG with irradiation time, this may be due to the weak photocorrosion at the contact area of the u-BVG and the Na2SO4 electrolyte. Meanwhile, EIS is implemented to reveal the interfacial separation efficiency of both products in Fig. 6c. The smaller radius in the Nyquist plots is observed for u-BVG, reflecting the increased interfacial carrier transfer efficiency, which aligns well with the PL spectra and the above transient photocurrent results. Indeed, the results validate the successfully implemented ISM strategy for constructing the u-BVG with the excellent electron transfer properties, providing new opportunities for fabricating graphene-based BiVO4 binary systems.

Based on the promoted carrier separation and transfer property of u-BVG, one may suppose that u-BVG shows better molecular oxygen activation ability. Hence photoinduced molecular oxygen activation measurements were performed under visible light irradiation. DMPO assisted ESR inspects the spin-trapped paramagnetic oxygen species ˙OH radicals and ˙O2− radicals.56 Obviously, six characteristic peaks are observed for u-BVG, which is assigned to the DMPO-˙OH adduct derived from OH−/H2O oxidation in water by holes,57 whereas i-BVG shows faint signals under visible light irradiation, confirming its low visible light activity (Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, both u-BVG and i-BVG have four almost identical peaks with intensities of 1:2:2:1 attributing to the DMPO-˙O2− adduct (Fig. 6e). Here ˙O2− radicals originate from O2 reduction by electrons.57 It is evident that both u-BVG and i-BVG have visible-light-driven molecular oxygen activation ability to generate two powerful oxygen species because they both exhibit similar photoabsorption properties in the visible light range (Fig. 4a). Remarkably, since the amount of free radicals is approximately proportional to the square of the height of the signal,58 the amount of ˙OH radicals for u-BVG is calculated to be ca. 16.8 times that of i-BVG. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the indistinguishable ˙O2− radical signal of i-BVG and u-BVG implies their similar CB edge positions. In contrast, the deeper VB edge position endows the u-BVG with a stronger ˙OH radical signal than i-BVG. And thus this observation clearly states that the u-BVG possesses the more powerful visible-light-driven molecular oxygen activation ability, which may lead to the promoted photocatalytic water oxidation performance.
To directly verify the boosted photocatalytic water oxidation activity trend, O2 evolution experiments were carried out in Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. Control experiments demonstrated that there was no detectable O2 generation in the dark or in the absence of photocatalysts, verifying that the O2 formation is derived from visible light irradiation driven by photocatalysts. Fig. 6f reveals that the u-BVG exhibits the O2 yield of 502.7 μmol g−1 in the first 5 h, over 260% that of the i-BVG. Apparently, the enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation activity of u-BVG strongly verified the crucial role of the ISM strategy. In addition, the similar Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (16.08 m2 g−1 for u-BVG, 16.76 m2 g−1 for i-BVG) implies that the BET specific surface area does not play a leading role for boosting the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. More importantly, the photocatalytic durability has also been investigated by cycling experiments with the periodical evacuation of the generated gas. For both the u-BVG and the i-BVG, Fig. 6f shows their stable increase of O2 with irradiation time in each cycle. Although the photocatalytic activity of u-BVG slightly decreases after a long-term reaction (15 h), nearly 70% of its O2 yield is still retained as well as ca. 2.1 times higher O2 yield than that of i-BVG. Notably, the XRD patterns and SEM image in Fig. S6a and b† strongly demonstrate that the crystal phase and morphology of u-BVG did not show any obvious variation after the 15 h O2 yield test, verifying its favorable reusability and photostability. Also, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction was measured as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic light (Fig. 6g). The AQE of both products decreases with a gradual increasing in wavelength, which suggests that the reaction proceeds via photoabsorption by photocatalysts. More generally, the enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation activity of u-BVG accounts for its higher AQE, reaching a maximum of 19.83% at 420 nm and roughly 1.6-fold higher than that of i-BVG.
Moreover, a comparison of the AQE of u-BVG with the well-known photocatalysts recently reported in the references is provided in Table S1.† In detail, the u-BVG prepared under the ISM strategy contains no Cl impurities. This modification allows for not only ca. 0.1 eV deeper VB edge position to generate holes with a stronger oxidation potential but the extraction of the impurity level to suppress the carrier recombination. On the other hand, our ISM strategy maintained the Mott–Schottky contact in u-BVG, and the thermodynamically feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene facilitates the holes to migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation reaction. Hence these merits explain why the u-BVG possesses superior AQE for water oxidation to those reported photocatalysts. The fact that u-BVG shows the boosted photocatalytic water oxidation activity is a potential sign for the practical implementation of solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
Conclusion
Graphene-based monoclinic-BiVO4 binary systems are conventionally believed to be excellent heterostructure photocatalysts, due to the feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene. However, we found that even bonding with graphene, i-BVG exhibited a much higher fluorescence intensity than u-BVG because of the carrier recombination traps induced by Cl impurities. Hence this binary system was utilized as a research platform, to disclose the correlation between the effect of the ISM strategy and the photocatalytic water oxidation activity. Following this strategy, the u-BVG was successfully constructed via lamellar BiCl4−–CTA+ hybrid precursors. Considering the Mott–Schottky heterojunctions at the contact interface in u-BVG, the feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene facilitates the holes to migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation process. Confirmed by experiments and DFT calculations, our ISM strategy avoids the introduction of Cl impurities. This modification allows for not only ca. 0.1 eV deeper VB edge position to generate holes with a stronger oxidation potential but the extraction of the impurity level to suppress the carrier recombination. Profiting from the merits above, the amount of ˙OH radicals for u-BVG was ca. 16.8 times more than that for i-BVG in the molecular oxygen activation measurement; the u-BVG exhibited the O2 yield up to 502.7 μmol g−1 in the first 5 h and over 260% that of i-BVG, meanwhile the former reached a maximum AQE of 19.83% at 420 nm and ca. 1.6-fold higher than that of the latter. Also, u-BVG showed admirable reusability and photostability. This work not only proposes an ISM strategy for synthesizing ultrapure monoclinic-BiVO4 on graphene but also experimentally and theoretically corroborates its crucial role in the Mott–Schottky heterojunctions of the binary systems for optimizing photocatalytic water oxidation activity, opening a window for achieving highly efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
