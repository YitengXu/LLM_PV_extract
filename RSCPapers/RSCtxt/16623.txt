    , Accepted 15th February 2023First published on 6th March 2023AbstractThe purification of carbon monoxide in H2-rich streams is an urgent problem for the practical application of fuel cells, and requires the development of efficient and economical catalysts for the preferential oxidation of CO (CO-PROX). In the present work, a facile solid phase synthesis method followed by an impregnation method were adopted to prepare a ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide, which shows superior catalytic performance with CO conversion of 90% for photothermal CO-PROX at 250 mW cm−2. The dopant of copper species leads to the incorporation of Cu ions into the CoMnOx spinel lattice forming a ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide. The appropriate calcination temperature (300 °C) contributes to the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies and strong synergetic Cu–Co–Mn interactions, which are conducive to the mobility of oxygen species to participate in CO oxidation reactions. On the other hand, the highest photocurrent response of CuCoMnOx-300 also promotes the photo-oxidation activity of CO due to the high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. In addition, the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that doping copper species could enhance the CO adsorption capacity of the catalyst due to the generation of Cu+ species, which significantly increased the CO oxidation activity of the CuCoMnOx spinel oxide. The present work provides a promising and eco-friendly solution to remove the trace CO in H2-rich gas over CuCoMnOx ternary spinel oxide with solar light as the only energy source.
1. Introduction
CO preferential oxidation (CO-PROX)1–3 is an important purification method to remove the trace CO in a hydrogen-rich gas to meet the application demands of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In the past few decades, various kinds of catalysts such as noble metals Au4,5 and Pt,6,7 and non-noble metal oxides such as CuO/CeO28–12 and Co3O413,14 have been extensively studied in the thermal catalytic reaction of CO-PROX. However, the traditional thermal catalysis process requires inputting external thermal energy to activate the CO oxidation process and consumes a lot of fossil energy, which leads to severe environment problems and huge carbon emissions. In recent years, photothermal catalysis which utilizes solar light as the energy source is expected to be an effective strategy to meet the requirements of both cleanliness and energy saving during catalysis processes. Photothermal catalysis combines the advantages of photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, which renders excellent catalytic performance even under moderate conditions. Three vital design criteria were concluded for photothermal catalysts to meet the demands of high catalytic performance: (1) intense and broad light absorption over the whole solar spectrum, (2) efficient photo-to-thermal conversion, and (3) superior catalytic activity at low reaction temperature. As for the photothermal CO-PROX reaction, the promising candidate should firstly have excellent thermal catalytic CO oxidation activity, such as copper–ceria catalysts and cobalt oxides. In our recent work,15 we synthesized CuCeO2−x nanorod catalysts using a simple coprecipitation method at room temperature, and investigated their photothermal catalytic performance in CO-PROX. The results demonstrated that CuCeO2−x nanorods show quite high CO conversion under UV-Vis-IR light irradiation due to the synergistic interaction between copper and ceria species and the excellent oxygen mobility in the ceria-based catalysts. However, the surface temperature of CuCeO2−x nanorod catalysts under the simulated solar light is rather lower and restricts their catalytic activity. Therefore, photothermal catalysts with a broader light adsorption range and high photo-to-thermal conversion ability are extremely in demand.
Among different kinds of photothermal conversion materials (such as carbon-based and some organic materials,16–19 noble metal nanoparticles,20 and semiconductor metal oxides21–23), spinel-type oxide M3O4 (M = transition metal) is a kind of important photothermal conversion material with excellent light absorption and photothermal conversion capabilities, and is widely applied as a solar absorbing coating material.24–27 Chen28 synthesized ACo2O4 spinel catalysts with strong light absorption in the full solar spectrum (200–2500 nm) and a high solar heating effect. NiCo2O4 exhibits efficient catalytic performance for toluene oxidation and good stability. The irradiation enhanced the mobility of reactive oxygen species, thus improving the photothermal catalytic activity of NiCo2O4. On the other hand, spinel-type oxide consists of multivalent metal cations occupying tetrahedral and octahedral sites respectively with four and six coordination, which benefits the generation of multiple defects in the spinel structure and enhances its catalytic performance in the redox reaction.29–31 Zeng et al.32 synthesized a range of Co3O4/rGO with tuneable oxygen vacancy defect concentrations by alkali etching and applied them for photothermal degradation of methanol. The combination of the thermal effect of rGO and abundant oxygen vacancy defects results in excellent photothermal catalytic performance and excellent persistence under solar irradiation. Jiang et al.33 concluded the content of surface adsorbed oxygen species is essential to the benzene oxidation activity of the spinel MnCo2O4. In addition, Xu et al.34 designed complex nanostructured Co–Mn bimetallic spinel catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation using a simple template-free method. The self-assembled multi-shelled mesoporous spinel nanostructures provide a high surface area and abundant active sites, which facilitate their satisfactory CO oxidation catalytic activity. In view of the integrated advantages of the cobalt spinel oxide of the high ability to activate oxygen and strong light absorption, the cobalt spinel oxide is regarded as a promising candidate for photothermal CO-PROX.
Motivated by the above considerations, we attempt to construct ternary spinel oxide CuCoMnOx catalysts and apply them in photothermal CO-PROX for the first time. The catalysts were prepared using a facile solid phase grinding method followed by an impregnation method. Moreover, the doping effect of copper ions and the influence of thermal treatment conditions on the optical and structure properties and the photothermal catalytic performance of the ternary spinel oxide catalysts were investigated in depth. The ternary CuCoMnOx catalyst calcined at 300 °C exhibits superior photothermal catalytic performance with a CO conversion efficiency of 90% under simulated solar light illumination (2.5 suns). A series of characterization methods were utilized to discover the optical properties, and the structural and textural properties of the catalysts. The present work provides a promising and eco-friendly solution to remove the trace CO in H2-rich gas over CuCoMnOx ternary spinel oxide with solar light as the only energy source.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All reagents used were analytical reagents without further purification. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99.99%), Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (98%), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99%), absolute ethanol and L-ascorbic acid (99%) were all purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., LTD. The solutions were all prepared with deionized water.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
Synthesis of CoMnOx-T: the CoMnOx spinel oxide was prepared using a vitamin C (VC)-assisted solid phase grinding method. 5 mmol Mn(NO3)2·4H2O, 3.3 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 2.5 mmol L-ascorbic acid were placed in a grinding bowl and ground for 5 min to obtain the precursor mixture. Then the mixture was calcined in air at different calcination temperatures for 2 hours in a muffle furnace to obtain the CoMnOx-T catalyst. The calcination temperatures are 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C respectively for CoMnOx-200, CoMnOx-300, CoMnOx-400, and CoMnOx-500 catalysts. The temperature ramping rate was 5 °C min−1 for all samples during the calcination process.
Synthesis of CuCoMnOx-T: the CuCoMnOx spinel oxide was prepared using the above solid phase grinding method followed by an impregnation method. A certain amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O is dissolved in the deionized water and 0.5 g of CoMnOx-T was dispersed in the Cu(NO3)2 solution with stirring for 12 h. The excess water was dried in a water bath at 80 °C and then treated at 120 °C. The dried sample was calcined for 2 h at the same temperature as CoMnOx-T to obtain the corresponding CuCoMnOx-T catalyst. The weight fraction of Cu is fixed at 16 wt% for the CuCoMnOx-T catalysts. The schematic diagram of the material synthesis method of the CuCoMnOx-T catalyst is shown in Fig. 1.

Synthesis of Mn2O3 and Co3O4: 5 mmol Mn(NO3)2·4H2O or Co(NO3)2·6H2O was ground with 1.5 mmol L-ascorbic acid, and subsequently placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 300 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The crystal structure of the catalyst was analyzed using a Rigaku SmartLabSE X-ray diffractometer. The scanning range is 10°–90° with a scanning step of 0.02 and a scanning speed of 5° min−1. The average grain size of the catalysts was calculated using the following Scherrer Formula (K = 0.89, where λ represents the X-ray wavelength of 0.154056 nm, B represents the half-height width of the diffraction peak, and θ represents the diffraction angle):  
The morphology of the sample was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30). The Cu concentration of CuCoMnOx-T was determined using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP-MS, Agilent 7800) instrument. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of the samples were determined using a TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics Inc.) automated physical chemisorption instrument in a liquid nitrogen environment (−196 °C). The surface element distributions of the catalysts were tested using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+). The Raman spectra of the samples were obtaining using a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer. The excitation wavelength is 532 nm and the scanning range is 100–2000 cm−1.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) of the samples was carried out with a U-type quartz microreactor and TCD detector. 100 mg of the CoMnOx-T sample (50 mg of the CuCoMnOx-T sample) with 60–80 meshes was pre-treated with N2 at 150 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 5% H2/Ar with a velocity of 40 mL min−1 was introduced and heated to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1.
UV-Vis-IR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-3600/UV-3600 iplus UV-Vis spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reference at room temperature.
The diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra of the catalyst were obtained by NICOLET 6700 FTIR test. The detector was low-temperature MCT (Merbury-Cadnium-Telluride), and the window plate of the in situ cell was CaF2. A certain amount of catalyst (60–80 mesh) was pre-treated for 0.5 h at 150 °C in a 10% O2 atmosphere. The reaction atmosphere (25% H2 + 0.5% O2 + 0.5% CO, Ar equilibrium, the flow rate of 100 mL min−1) was passed. The scanning temperatures were 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150, 170, 190 and 210 °C. Spectra were collected at the resolution of 32 scans and 4 cm−1.
The transient photocurrent was tested on an electrochemical workstation. The standard three-electrode system (Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum electrode as the counter electrode) and Na2SO4 (0.5 M) solution as the electrolyte were used for the tests. 100 μl of PVDF solution (10 mg ml−1) was added to the sample dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol to obtain the working electrode solution. The fluorine-doped indium tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass was ultrasonically cleaned and dried at 100 °C. The working electrode solution was spin-coated on the FTO glass at 2000 rpm for 30 s on a KW-4A benchtop homogenizer. After repeating 10 times, the glass was placed in a muffle furnace at 100 °C to obtain the working electrode. The light intensity was 250 mW cm−2 with a xenon lamp as the light source. The photocurrent test interval was 20 s.
2.4. Catalytic performance

2.4.1. Catalytic performance evaluation for photothermal CO-PROX. 
The catalytic activity of the catalyst for photothermal CO-PROX was tested in a homebuilt fixed-bed reactor with a quartz window to allow light incident. 100 mg of catalyst was dispersed on the porous silica bed with a diameter of 4 cm, and a thermocouple was embedded in the catalyst to measure the temperature of the catalyst. The reaction atmosphere is composed of 25% H2 + 0.5% O2 + 0.5% CO in equilibrium with Ar (the total flow rate is 100 sccm) with the space velocity of 60000 mL g−1 h−1. The product passed by a TDX-01 column with highly purified Ar as the carrier gas and a FID detector equipped with a methanator to separate and detect the CO and CO2 signal.
The conversion of CO is calculated using the following equation:  


2.4.2. Catalytic performance evaluation for thermal CO-PROX. 
The thermal catalytic performance of the catalyst was determined in a quartz tube (ϕ = 6 mm). 100 mg of 60–80 mesh catalyst diluted with quartz sand in equal volume was placed in the middle of the quartz tube. The other test conditions are all the same with evaluation for photothermal CO-PROX including the temperature thermocouple, the space velocity, gas composition and the determination method of the inlet and outlet gas.
The apparent photoactivation efficiency (PAE) provides the efficiency of the reaction to convert light energy to chemical energy when ΔG < 0. First, the activation energy of the reaction in the absence of light needs to be calculated. Usually there is a relationship between the rate constant k (mol s−1) of a chemical reaction and the absolute temperature T as follows:  
Integrate the above formula to get:  
The k values were obtained at various temperatures by plotting lnk versus 1/T to obtain a straight line. Since the slope of the straight line is −Ea/R, the slope is multiplied by the molar gas constant R (R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1) to obtain Ea.
The apparent light activation efficiency under different lighting conditions:  where Δn is the product increase under photoactivation conditions, mol; Ea is the apparent activation energy calculated by thermocatalysis, J mol−1; Plight is the optical power of the incident light, W; t is the illumination time, s.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and textural properties
The structural and textural properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD and N2-isothermal adsorption and desorption. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), CoMnOx catalysts exhibit the characteristic diffraction peaks of tetragonal Mn3Co2Ox (PDF# 18-0408) with a spinel structure.35 After doping copper species, the crystal structure of the series samples transfers to the cubic face-centered spinel structure of CuCoMnOx (JCPDS# 47-0324). The variation of crystal structure before/after doping copper species is mainly caused by the precipitation of Mn2+ and the incorporation of Cu2+ into the lattice framework of tetragonal Mn3Co2Ox, since that Co3O4 is a cubic face-centered structure and Mn3O4 is a body-centered tetragonal structure and the ratio of Co/Mn in Co–Mn spinel would change the crystal structure.36,37 Specifically, the tetragonal Mn3Co2Ox phase occurs in CoMnOx-T with the stoichiometry in agreement with the amount of metal employed during the same preparation. Actually, as reported in the literature,38 the diffraction peaks of Co–Mn spinel as the mole ratio of Co changed from 0.2 to 1 all correspond to this PDF card (PDF# 18-0408). On the other hand, the cubic face-centered spinel structure of CuCoMnOx (JCPDS# 47-0324) occurs in CuCoMnOx-T. In addition, it is noticed that the characteristic peaks of MnO2 appear in the CuCoMnOx-200 sample, which is mainly derived from the decomposition of manganese nitrate that dissolved out from the lattice of CoMnOx-200 during the impregnation process. Moreover, MnO2 transforms into Mn2O3 at a much higher calcination temperature39 and an obvious diffraction peak attributed to Mn2O3 in the XRD pattern of CuCoMnOx-500. The lattice parameters and cell volumes of the spinel lattice structure in the CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T catalysts were calculated and listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The lattice parameters of the CoMnOx-T series are basically the same as each other with similar cell volumes. However, after introducing copper species in the spinel oxides, the lattice parameters of the CuCoMnOx-T series were remarkably changed, which reduced from 8.169 to 8.160 and then increased to 8.189 as the calcination temperature increases from 200 to 500 °C. The reduced lattice parameter is mainly due to the fact that the incorporation of Cu2+ induced the formation of oxygen vacancy and shrinkage of the lattice parameter in order to maintain the spinel structure.40 However, as the calcination temperature increases, more Cu ions with much larger ionic radius (r(Cu2+): 87 pm, r(Cu+): 96 pm, r(Mn3+): 66 pm, r(Co3+): 68 pm) enter the spinel oxide lattice and lead to the expansion of the lattice parameter and cell volume.41 The broader and weaker diffraction peaks of CoMnOx-200 and CoMnOx-300 indicate the ultra-small grain size and low crystallinity. However, the narrow and sharp diffraction peaks indicate the high crystallinity and large grain size of the CoMnOx-500 catalyst. In addition, for the CuCoMnOx catalysts, no diffraction peaks of CuO indicates the high dispersion of copper species in the CuCoMnOx spinel structure. According to Scheller's formula, the average grain sizes of the catalysts were further calculated in Table S2 (ESI†). CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300 catalysts have relatively smaller grain sizes of 8.0 and 7.4 nm, which are 20.1 and 17.8 nm respectively of CoMnOx-500 and CuCoMnOx-500. N2 isothermal adsorption and desorption curves of the CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T catalysts are presented in Fig. 2i and j and the specific surface area (SBET) and total pore volume (VPore) of the catalyst are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2, all the samples show typical type IV isotherms and Type H4 hysteresis loop. For the undoped CoMnOx-T catalyst, the CoMnOx-300 catalyst exhibits the high SBET of 109 m2 g−1 with a large pore volume of 0.267 cm3 g−1, which is mainly caused by the gas products released by the thermal decomposition of VC and nitrate. The incomplete decomposition of VC at 200 °C35 and the sintering of the grain size at 500 °C respectively leads to the reduced SBET values and pore volumes of CoMnOx-200 and CoMnOx-500, in accordance with the XRD results. For the ternary CuCoMnOx-T catalyst, the SBET of CuCoMnOx-300 catalysts is also the largest although it is much smaller than CoMnOx-300 due to the collapse of the stacked pore structures during the impregnation and recalcination process.

The morphology and element distribution of CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300 catalysts were characterized by HRTEM and EDS mapping images. The TEM images of CuCoMnOx-T catalysts in Fig. S1 (ESI†) demonstrate the enlarged crystal size at higher calcination temperature, confirming the crystal size calculated by XRD patterns in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2e and f, CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300 both behave as a stack of amorphous small nanoparticles with blurred boundaries and the latter is much larger relative to the former, which is consistent with the grain size in Table S2 (ESI†). The CoMnOx-300 catalyst mainly exposes the (400) crystal plane with a spacing of 0.207 nm of the tetragonal spinel structure. The CuCoMnOx-300 catalyst mainly exposes the (311) crystal plane with a spacing of 0.246 nm of the cubic face-centered spinel structure. As shown in Fig. 2h–j, the EDS mapping images of CuCoMnOx-300 showed that Cu, Mn, Co, and O elements were uniformly distributed on the catalyst. The weight fraction of Cu in the CuCoMnOx-T catalyst was also confirmed by ICP-MS which is 17.0%, 17.1%, 18.4%, and 18.1%, respectively for CuCoMnOx-200, CuCoMnOx-300, CuCoMnOx-400 and CuCoMnOx-500 catalysts, basically consistent with their theoretical Cu weight fraction of 16%.
3.2. Catalytic performance of the catalysts
The CO conversions and temperatures of CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T under 250 mW cm−2 in the CO-PROX reaction atmosphere are presented in Fig. 3a and b (the CO conversion curves and temperature curves along with the illumination time are shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). From Fig. 3a, the CO conversion of the binary CoMnOx-T catalyst is remarkably influenced by the calcination temperatures, which dramatically increases from 30% to 72% as the calcination temperature elevated from 200 to 300 °C, whereas it reduces to 55% and 20% for CoMnOx-400 and CoMnOx-500. Compared with the CoMnOx-T catalyst, the formation of the ternary spinel oxide CuCoMnOx-T catalyst greatly boosts the CO conversion, especially for CuCoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-400 catalysts, for which the CO conversion is enhanced to 90% and 87% respectively. The results indicate that doping copper species into the binary CoMnOx catalyst with the appropriate calcination temperature could effectively improve the catalytic activity for photothermal CO-PROX. In addition, the surface temperatures of CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T catalysts (Fig. 3b) are about ∼115 °C and approximate with each other, indicating the photo-to-thermal conversion is basically equal in these samples. The O2 selectivity to CO2 and CO conversion of CuCoMnOx-300 catalyst for photothermal CO-PROX is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It can be seen that as the CO conversion becomes higher, the O2 selectivity gradually decreases along with the illumination time, and is finally maintained at 65% as the CO conversion reaches 90%. This indicates that the competition oxidation between CO and H2 occurs at the CuCoMnOx-300 catalyst, while the CO oxidation is more active than H2 oxidation on the catalyst under stimulated solar light illumination. It was also reported in other literatures that the competition oxidation between CO and H2 exists in the CO-PROX of the cobalt spinel oxides with similar O2 selectivity, which is caused by the surface adsorbed oxygen species that can also lead to H2 oxidation.

Fig. 3c presents the T50% values of CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T in thermal CO-PROX (the CO conversion curves along with the reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). The T50% value of CuCoMnOx-300 is the lowest among the series of CuCoMnOx-T catalysts and is further reduced from 112 to 68 °C for CuCoMnOx-300, which means that the optimum calcination temperature and the formation of ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide both contributes to the superior catalytic performance of CuCoMnOx-300 for thermal CO-PROX. The highly active catalytic ability of ternary CuCoMnOx-300 is reasonable for promoting its photothermal catalytic performance under solar light illumination. The CO conversions of the CoMnOx and CuCoMnOx catalysts for thermal and photothermal CO-PROX at the same temperature are respectively listed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It can be seen that the photothermal CO conversion is remarkably higher than the thermal CO conversion for most of the catalysts, demonstrating that the light contributes to the CO oxidation process to a large extent and the synergistic effect of light and thermal energy significantly proceed the CO oxidation. Nevertheless, the difference of CuCoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-400 for thermal and photothermal CO-PROX are likely to be very slight, which might be due to the CO conversion being quite high and the synergistic effect of light and thermal energy seems to be reduced to a certain degree.
In order to confirm the contribution of the different optical compositions such as UV and visible light in the full spectrum solar light on the photothermal catalytic performance of CuCoMnOx-300, the CO conversions and temperatures under 250 mW cm−2 with different cut-off filters are present in Fig. 3d (the CO conversion and temperature curves along with the illumination time are shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). The visible light plays a significant role in activating the CO oxidation reaction, and the CO conversion of the catalyst reaches 75% with a surface temperature of 85 °C under visible light irradiation. The proportion of visible light is 83% that contributes to the photothermal catalytic activity under the full spectrum of solar light irradiation. Moreover, under UV light, the CO conversion is 28% with the temperature of 55 °C. The results demonstrate that both the visible and UV light contribute to the high CO oxidation activity of CuCoMnOx-300, which benefits from the broad optical absorption region of the catalyst.
In addition, the catalytic performance of the pure Co3O4 and Mn2O3 were also investigated as shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†), in which the CO conversions of pure Mn2O3 are relatively lower than Co3O4 and extremely inferior to the binary CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300 catalysts. This demonstrates that the excellent CO oxidation capacity of CuCoMnOx-300 benefits to the synergy interaction between Cu–Co–Mn species in the ternary spinel oxide. The optimum copper amount in the CuCoMnOx catalyst calcined at 300 °C was also explored as shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†). The CO conversion is elevated from 84% to 90% as the copper amount increases from 7% to 16% whereas it reduces to 85% with a higher Cu content of 19%. Moreover, the operation condition including the optical power density and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) were also investigated over CuCoMnOx-300 in photothermal CO-PROX (Fig. S8a and b, ESI†). The photothermal CO-PROX over CuCoMnOx-T catalysts was tested at the illumination power density of 250 mW cm−2 with WHSV of 60000 mL h−1 cat−1. We calculated the apparent activation efficiency (PAE) under different illumination densities, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The CuCoMnOx-300 catalyst shows the highest apparent activation efficiency (0.47%) at 250 mW cm−2. Therefore, the illumination density for this experiment was fixed at 250 mW cm−2.
3.3. Promotion effect of copper dopant and calcination temperature

3.3.1. Optical properties of catalysts. 
To deeply understand the effect of copper dopant and calcination temperature on the optical property of the catalysts, the transient photocurrent curves of CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T were recorded at the illumination power density of 250 mW cm−2 with dark/light intervals of 20 s. As shown in Fig. 4a, the photocurrent intensity is the largest for CoMnOx-300 compared with the other CoMnOx-T catalysts, indicating the generation and separation efficiency of the photo-induced electron–hole pair is greatly promoted by the appropriate calcination temperature. As shown in Fig. 4b, compared with CoMnOx-T, the photocurrent intensity of CuCoMnOx-T is much higher than the undoped samples. Specifically, CuCoMnOx-300 shows the highest photocurrent response intensity with fast response time, indicating the high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation of CuCoMnOx-300 under the simulated solar light illumination. The efficient photocurrent response might also induce the superior catalytic performance of the CuCoMnOx-300 catalyst for photothermal CO-PROX under solar light illumination. According to the UV-Vis-IR absorption spectrum (Fig. S10a and b, ESI†), all the CoMnOx-T catalyst series show a strong absorbance capability of the full wavelengths from 200–2500 nm, which leads to the high surface temperature of the catalysts cooperated with the excellent photo-to-thermal conversion of spinel oxides. After doping copper species, the light absorption of the CuCoMnOx-T catalyst is slightly increased at the wavelength range from 200 to 760 nm and obviously enhanced at the infrared wavelength for CuCoMnOx-400 and CuCoMnOx-500. The strong UV and visible light adsorption benefit the higher photocurrent response and the increased IR adsorption is in favor of inducing higher surface temperature under the reaction conditions.

3.3.2. Elemental distribution and oxygen vacancies. 
As mentioned above, the essence of photothermal catalysis relies on the synergy effect of photo and thermal catalytic processes, which is very sensitive to the surface element distribution and valence state of the catalysts. Therefore, the surface physical and chemical properties of the CuCoMnOx spinel oxides catalysts were estimated by XPS spectra, and the Mn 2p, Co 2p, Cu 2p, and O 1s XPS spectra of CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-T catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The element distribution and the valence states are presented in Table 1. The atomic ratio of Mn:Co of the CoMnOx-300 catalyst in Table 1 is 1.5:1, which is consistent with the synthesis molar ratio of Mn(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2, indicating the formation of binary Co–Mn spinel oxides. Moreover, it is obvious that the atomic ratios of Cu:Mn:Co of the CuCoMnOx-T catalysts are significantly influenced by the calcination temperature. On one hand, the ratios of Mn:Co of CuCoMnOx-T are increased with higher calcination temperature and much larger than CoMnOx-300. This means that the impregnation of Cu(NO3)2 causes Mn species to precipitate from the framework of Co–Mn spinel oxides, which is further promoted by the increased calcination temperature. On the other hand, the ratios of Cu:Co of CuCoMnOx-T gradually reduced with higher calcination temperature, indicating more copper species incorporated into the spinel lattice framework, instead of agglomerating as CuOx on the surface of spinel oxides. Overall, doping copper species and an increased calcination process simultaneously cause the precipitation of Mn species and the incorporation of Cu species, which is consistent with XRD results.

The composition of the surface oxygen species of the catalyst was analysed based on the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 5A). As reported in the literature,42 the peak at 531 eV can be subdivided into three peaks attributed to Oads (O−/O22−), CO32−/OH− and H2O, respectively. In addition, for the O 1s spectra of CoMnOx-200, the presence of a peak of 532.2 eV is attributed to CO caused by the incomplete decomposition of L-ascorbic acid at 200 °C, as evidenced by the C 1s spectrum in Fig. S11a (ESI†).43 The content of Oads was determined by the peak evolution profile (Fig. 1A), as shown in Table 1. The content of Oads in CuCoMnOx-300 is significantly higher than the binary CoMnOx-300, indicating the formation of oxygen vacancy caused by the incorporation of copper species into the spinel oxide lattice (as demonstrated by XRD). For the CuCoMnOx-T catalyst, the content of Oads increases with increasing calcination temperature up to 39% and then decreases. The higher Oads concentration leads to the higher electron density of OL, thus reduces the binding energy of OL from 529.9 eV to 529.7 eV. The higher Oads concentration and lower binding energy of OL indicate the lower valence states of cobalt and manganese ions in CuCoMnOx-300, leading to the formation of more surface oxygen vacancies to maintain electrical equilibrium. In addition, the presence of hydroxyl groups is conducive to the dispersion of Cu species.44
As shown in the Mn 2p3/2 spectra (Fig. 5B), three peaks of 641.6, 642.7, and 644.2 eV are respectively attributed to Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ species.45,46 As presented in the Co 2p3/2 spectra (Fig. 5C), two peaks around 780.2 eV and 781.8 eV are respectively assigned to Co3+ and Co2+. As shown in Table 1, the highest ratios of (Mn2+ + Mn3+)/(Mn2+ + Mn3+ + Mn4+) and Co2+/(Co2+ + Co3+) in CuCoMnOx-300 indicate the existence of abundant manganese and cobalt species with lower valence states. Moreover, the average oxidation state (AOS)45 of Mn (calculated according to the binding energy of Mn 3s spectra (Fig. S11b, ESI†) are 3.12, 2.62, 2.82, and 3.29 respectively for CuCoMnOx-200, CuCoMnOx-300, CuCoMnOx-400, and CuCoMnOx-500. The smallest AOS further confirmed the existence of low-state manganese species in CuCoMnOx-300.
The Cu 2p XPS spectra are composed of three series of peaks, which are respectively ascribed to the peaks Cu 2p1/2 (948–958 eV) and Cu 2p3/2 (928–938 eV). The two peaks of Cu 2p3/2 at 930.6 eV and 933.6 eV correspond to Cu+ and Cu2+ species, respectively. According to the literature,47 the Cu 2p3/2 peak around 930.6 eV can be attributed to the formation of Cu+ species in the spinel structure. According to the Cu 2p spectra, it can be found that satellite peaks (937–948 eV) are present in all samples, which proves the presence of Cu2+. Meanwhile, the relative value of CuO/Cu2O can be roughly estimated from the intensity ratio of the satellite peak to the main peak. The intensity of the satellite peak decreased significantly with the calcination temperature, indicating that the Cu2+ on the surface of the sample decreased. As shown in Fig. 5D and Table 1, the valence state of Cu species (Cu+/(Cu+ + Cu2+)) on the surface of CuCoMnOx-T is significantly changed by the calcination temperature. For CuCoMnOx-200, almost all the copper species are Cu2+ with bivalent valence, indicating CuO species enriches on the surface of CoMnOx-200, instead of incorporating into the lattice of the Co–Mn spinel structure. As the calcination temperature is elevated from 300 to 500 °C, the ratio of Cu+ in Cu remarkably increased from 12.4% to 72.9%, demonstrating the incorporation of Cu species into the spinel oxide lattice and the formation of the ternary Cu–Co–Mn spinel structure. Moreover, the Cu L3VV Auger spectra of the series catalysts are shown in Fig. 5E to further analyze the valence states of copper species. The values of the CuL3VV signals are respectively at 918.5 eV for Cu, 915.2 eV for Cu2O and 917.4 eV for CuO.48 Moreover, there exists a new peak at around 911.2–914.3 eV, lower than that of Cu+, which is observed and can be attributed to Cuα+ with variable valence caused by a large number of strong metal interactions and oxygen defects.49,50 The ratio of Cu+ and Cu2+ in Cu is calculated and listed in Table 1. The Cu+ content obviously increases with the higher calcination temperature. In the meantime, the Cu2+ content remarkably decreased which is also indicated by reduced Isat/Ipp values. This is attributed to that the increase in temperature promotes the incorporation of Cu species into the spinel lattice and the formation of the ternary Cu–Co–Mn spinel structure. The interaction between Cu and Mn (or Co) stabilized the Cu+ species51 due to the redox reaction of Mn3+ + Cu2+ ↔ Mn4+ + Cu+ or Co2+ + Cu2+ ↔ Co3+ + Cu+. By correlating the valence state of Cu with the surface content of Cu, Mn, and Co, it is concluded that the increased calcination temperature promotes the incorporation of Cu species into the spinel coordinate sites and the dissolution of Mn species from the spinel structure. Moreover, for CuCoMnOx-300, the appropriate calcination temperature enhances the Cu–Mn–Co synergistic interaction in the lattice of the ternary spinel oxide structure, which boosts the photothermal catalytic activity for CO-PROX.
The Raman spectra in Fig. 5 further confirm the insertion of Cu ions in the spinel lattice structure and the formation of Cu–Co–Mn ternary spinel oxides. The remaining bands in the region of 570 to 670 cm−1 are the vibration mode of the MO6 octahedron. From Fig. 5F, it is noteworthy that a blue shift of the strongest band from 639 to 622 cm−1 appears in CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300, which progressively shifts to 611 cm−1 as the calcination temperature further increases to 500 °C. It represents the incremental of metal–oxygen bonds of MO6 polyhedra caused by lattice distortions resulting from Cu2+/Cu+ in octahedral sites (rCu2+ = 87 pm, rCu+ = 96 pm, rMn3+ = 66 pm).52,53
The reduction properties of CoMnOx-T and CuCoMnOx-T were investigated by H2-TPR profiles. As shown in Fig. 6a, there are four peaks in the H2-TPR profiles of CoMnOx-T, in which the two reduction peaks at 100–360 °C correspond to the initial reduction of the spinel structure (α: Mn4+ → Mn3+, β: Co3+ → Co2+), and the two reduction peaks over 360 °C correspond to the further reduction (γ: Mn3+ → Mn2+, δ: Co2+ → Co0).54 The intensity of all four reduction peaks is remarkably enlarged for CoMnOx-300, especially for peaks α and β. Then the reduction peaks shift to a higher temperature range with much lower intensities of peaks α and β for CoMnOx-500. This indicates the synergetic interaction between Mn and Co promotes oxygen mobility and the reducibility of CoMnOx-T catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6b, a new reduction peak near 210 °C occurs in the CuCoMnOx-T catalysts with the other reduction peaks shifting to lower temperature, which indicates that the addition of CuOx significantly improves the low temperature reduction property and the synergy Cu–Co–Mn interaction promotes redox reactions of the catalyst. However, the δ peak moves to a higher temperature beyond 800 °C for CuCoMnOx-T catalysts.55 The total hydrogen consumption listed in Table S4 (ESI†) demonstrates that CuCoMnOx-300 shows the largest total hydrogen consumption (11.64 mmol gcat−1), which is ascribed to the abundant surface oxygen vacancy and the strong Cu–Co–Mn interaction that boosts the reducibility and further enhances the CO oxidation ability.

            In situ DRIFTs. 

Fig. 7 shows DRIFTs spectra of CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300 catalysts under the reaction atmosphere at different temperatures. In the range of 2200–1900 cm−1, the peak at 2098 cm−1 belongs to the vibration absorption peak of Cu+–CO species.56 As shown in Fig. 7a, almost no Cu+–CO absorption peak appears in CoMnOx-300, while it is obviously observed in CuCoMnOx-300 (Fig. 7b). The formation of Cu+–CO species demonstrates that the doping Cu species remarkably enhance the adsorption ability for CO molecules, which further promotes the selective oxidation of CO on CuCoMnOx-300. With the higher reaction temperature, the vibration absorption peak of Cu+–CO species gradually increased and reached the maximum at 90 °C. However, the stretching modes of Co2+–CO (2120–2170 cm−1) and Co3+–CO (2178–2180 cm−1) were absent in the DRIFTs spectra of CoMnOx-300 and CuCoMnOx-300. This is mainly caused by the adsorbed CO on cobalt species quickly reacting with the active oxygen and transforming into carbonate species in the range of 1200–1900 cm−1 (as shown in Fig. S12, ESI†).57 As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the bands in the 3800–3000 cm−1 range correspond to hydroxyl groups. Note that the areas of the hydroxyl band of CuCoMnOx-300 are significantly lower than those of CoMnOx-300, suggesting the hydroxyl groups58 don't accumulate easily on CuCoMnOx-300 and are readily removed for good accessibility of the active centre in the catalytic oxidation reaction.59 As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the bands below 1700 cm−1 are attributed to the carbon intermediates (mainly bicarbonate and carbonates). The bands at 1651 cm−1 are attributed to bidentate carbonate. The bands at 1313 and 1540 cm−1 are ascribed to monodentate carbonate. The bands at 1396 and 1417 cm−1 are attributed to the bicarbonate root.60 It is obvious that the bidentate carbonate transforms to bicarbonate and monodentate as the reaction temperature increases. Moreover, the area of the bidentate carbonate of CuCoMnOx-300 is apparently smaller than that of CoMnOx-300, which means the bidentate carbonate can be easily decomposed by CuCoMnOx-300 due to the abundant adsorbed oxygen species and benefits the faster CO oxidation rates.

4. Conclusions
In the present work, a facile solid phase grinding method followed by an impregnation method were utilized to synthesize ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide with a high surface area. The ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide shows superior catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of CO under simulated solar light irradiation. The photothermal CO conversion reaches 90% for the ternary CuCoMnOx catalysts calcined at 300 °C under a light intensity of 250 mW cm−2. On one hand, the dopant of copper species leads to the incorporation of Cu ions into the CoMnOx spinel lattice and contributes to the formation of cubic ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide. The appropriate calcination temperature (300 °C) contributes to the generation of strong synergetic Cu–Co–Mn interactions and abundant oxygen vacancies, which are conducive to the mobility of oxygen species to participate in the CO oxidation reaction. On the other hand, the highest photocurrent response of CuCoMnOx-300 also promotes the photo-oxidation activity of CO due to the high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. In addition, in situ DRIFTS spectra confirmed that doping copper species could enhance the CO adsorption capacity of the catalyst due to the generation of Cu+ species, which significantly increased the CO oxidation activity of the CuCoMnOx spinel oxide. In conclusion, solar light driven photothermal selective oxidation of CO is achieved using the ternary CuCoMnOx spinel oxide, and provides a promising solution to purify the trace CO in H2-rich gas economically and eco-friendly.
