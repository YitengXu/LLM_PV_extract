    , Accepted 18th February 2022First published on 18th February 2022AbstractThe conversion of the [60]fullerene-fused lactones to ketones with triflic anhydride as an unusual reductant under aerobic conditions has been achieved in excellent yields. The present thermal retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction from lactones to ketones has no precedents. In addition, the unique ring-opened peroxy [60]fullerene derivatives can be obtained by the electrochemical reactions of the synthesized [60]fullerene-fused ketones.
The transformation of ketones into esters or that of cyclic ketones into lactones, namely the Baeyer–Villiger reaction,1 is one of the most important and fundamental reactions in organic synthesis.2 However, retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction is still extremely challenging. Because of their significance in materials science and biological science, a variety of fullerene derivatives have been synthesized over the last 30 years.3 Among them, the carbonyl derivatives of [60]fullerene (C60) have received extensive attention from scientists.4,5 Indeed, once the fullerenes are converted into fullerene derivatives by acylation, these compounds have strong electron-accepting ability4b,i and exhibit a high electron-transport mobility.4i Moreover, the presence of the acyl groups provides a powerful tool for the further transformation of fullerene derivatives. In 2019, we reported the intriguing reaction of the C60-fused lactone dianions with acetic acid (AcOH). It was found that treatment of the C60-fused lactone dianions with AcOH efficiently afforded the C60-fused ketones.5 This was the first report on retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction by electrochemical reduction followed by acid quenching (Scheme 1). Subsequently, we investigated the reaction of the C60-fused lactone dianions with benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br), and ring-opened benzyl adducts were unexpectedly obtained.6 In addition, the ring-opened products could be used as the efficient electron-transport materials (ETMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and a slightly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than that of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was obtained.
 Scheme 1  Previous electrochemical and this thermal retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction. 
Although the electrochemical retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction of the C60-fused lactones to ketones was very efficient, it was still limited by some conditions, such as the requirement for an electrochemical workstation and an inert atmosphere. Therefore, conventional thermal methods for the retro Baeyer–Villiger reactions are highly desirable. Herein, we are delighted to disclose that the C60-fused lactones can be efficiently converted to the corresponding C60-fused ketones with triflic anhydride (Tf2O) as an unusual reductant under heating and aerobic conditions. This is the first time that the retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction has been achieved under thermal reaction conditions (Scheme 1). Furthermore, we also explore the electrochemical functionalization of a representative C60-fused ketone to provide unique ring-opened peroxide products.
Organic acids and anhydrides are often used as effective reagents for the transformations of fullerene derivatives.7 Therefore, we initially treated the C60-fused lactone 1a8 (0.015 mmol) with AcOH (0.090 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-C6H4Cl2) (3 mL) at 120 °C for 10 h under an air atmosphere and no reaction took place (Table 1, entry 1). Other organic acids such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (p-TSA) could not induce the reaction either (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). To our delight, when using triflic acid (TfOH) as the acid, the desired product 2a was obtained in 8% yield (Table 1, entry 4). Subsequently, the corresponding anhydrides, such as acetic anhydride (Ac2O), trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA), p-toluenesulfonic anhydride (p-TSAA) and Tf2O, were also investigated (Table 1, entries 5–8). To our satisfaction, when 3 equiv. of Tf2O was used, the yield was significantly improved to 87% (Table 1, entry 8). When reducing the amount of Tf2O to 2 equiv., 2a was delivered in 62% yield (Table 1, entry 9). Continuing to increase the amount of Tf2O to 4 equiv., a slightly lower yield of 86% was obtained (Table 1, entry 10). Further altering the reaction temperature or time, a better yield could not be obtained (Table 1, entries 11–14). In addition, the reaction under an argon atmosphere was examined, and the yield was equivalent to that under aerobic conditions, indicating that O2 had no effect on the reaction (87% vs. 87%, Table 1, entries 8 vs. 15) and an inert atmosphere was not required in the current reaction. Thus, the optimal reaction conditions were a molar ratio of 1:3 for 1a and Tf2O at 120 °C for 10 h under aerobic conditions.

Until now, the access to fullerene-fused ketone derivatives is still limited.4b,g–i,5 To our satisfaction, the scope of the present reaction could be extended to other C60-fused lactones to obtain the corresponding C60-fused ketones under the optimized conditions. As shown in Table 2, the C60-fused lactones 1a–g with either electron-donating groups (1a–d) or electron-withdrawing groups (1e–g) on the phenyl ring could furnish the retro Baeyer–Villiger products 2a–g in excellent yields of 80–89%. When 1a and 1b with a methyl group attached to the meta and para positions of the phenyl ring were utilized, 2a and 2b were obtained in 87% and 89% yields, respectively. In comparison, the methoxy-substituted lactones 1c and 1d gave 2c and 2d in 88% and 86% yields, respectively. The substrates with electron-withdrawing chloro and ester groups could also be employed and afforded 2e–g in 80–82% yields. Moreover, when the 3,4-dimethoxy-substituted substrate 1h was used, 2h was obtained in 82% yield. Delightfully, the C60-fused lactone 1i without any substituent on the phenyl ring provided 2i in 90% yield.

Since the retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction obtained by a thermal approach has not been reported before, and the reaction intermediates are difficult to obtain, the exact pathway leading to the C60-fused ketone 2 is not currently clear. Based on the previous literature,9–13 we propose a possible reaction mechanism (Scheme 2). Firstly, under the action of Tf2O, the C60-fused lactone 1 is transformed to the trifloxycarbenium cation I,9,10 which exists with its resonance structure, that is, oxonium ion II.10 Similar iminium/imino triflates can also be formed from amides and Tf2O.11 Subsequently, cationic triflic carboxylic anhydride III is produced by ring opening with the C–O heterolytic cleavage. Fullerene cations have been widely proposed as the reaction intermediates in the literature.14 Finally, the cationic species III undergoes an intramolecular cyclization with the aid of TfO− to give the C60-fused ketone 2 along with TfOOTf.12 Similar attack of TfO− on the oxygen atom of a triflate intermediate to generate TfOOTf was previously proposed.12 Because TfOOTf is extremely unstable, all efforts towards its separation and detection failed.12,13 Tf2O has been extensively used in organic synthesis, and has oxidative properties.11a Nevertheless, the deoxygenation of sulfoxides to sulfides by Tf2O has been documented in the literature.12,15 However, thermal deoxygenation of lactones to give ketones by Tf2O or other reagents has never been reported before. The current protocol presents the first example of thermal retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction.
 Scheme 2  Proposed mechanism. 
Additionally, the electrochemical reactions of the C60-fused ketone 2 were investigated. Product 2a was selected as a representative substrate for further electrochemical functionalization (Scheme 3). First, the dianionic 2a2− was obtained under controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) at −1.30 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE). It is worth noting that the solution color of 2a2− was dark-green, which was the typical color for C60 anionic species bonded with only one addend.16 Thus, we surmised that after 2a accepted two electrons, the C60–C bond cleavage occurred to generate ring-opened dianionic 2a2−. The C–C bond was difficult to break, and there were few reports on the electrochemical cleavage of the C–C bond of the fullerene-fused carbocycles.17 Then, we applied 2a2− to the benzylation reaction. Surprisingly, when 2a2− was reacted with 50 equiv. of sodium hydride (NaH) and 75 equiv. of PhCH2Br at 50 °C for 6 h, we obtained two ring-opened bis-benzylated peroxyesters 3a (29% yield) and 4a (25% yield), rather than the expected keto analogues.6,18 The oxygen atoms in the products should come from a trace of O2 in the system,19 and the selectivity for 3a and 4a was comparable to that for 6 and 7 (Fig. 1) obtained from the C60-fused lactone reported earlier by us.6 Due to the similarity of the peroxyester groups in 3a and 4a to the ester groups in 6 and 7, we compared their 13C NMR spectra and found that they were nearly the same except for the chemical shifts for the carbonyl group and a few aryl carbons (see the ESI† Fig. S25 and S26). The addition patterns of 3a and 4a were further confirmed by their UV-vis spectra, which were similar to those of the reported 1,2-adducts and 1,4-adducts, respectively.4a,e,5,6,7a,d,f,8,16 Moreover, the MALDI-TOF MS of 3a and 4a unambiguously showed that an additional oxygen atom was present compared to those of 6 and 7 (see the ESI† Fig. S32 and S33). In addition, when 3 equiv. of TFA was used to protonate 2a2− at 25 °C for 0.5 h, the ring-opened peroxyacid 5a was isolated in 53% yield. It is worth mentioning that the solubility of 5a in CS2 was significantly lower than that of the corresponding fullerene carboxylic acid 8 (Fig. 1),5 displaying very different properties.

 Fig. 1  The structures of compounds 6–8. 
Finally, the electrochemical properties of 3a, 4a and 5a were studied by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and compared with those of 2a, 6–8 and PCBM; the results are summarized in Table 3. The DPV study showed that the first reduction potential (E1) values of 3a, 4a and 5a were −1.206 V, −1.139 V and −1.189 V, respectively, and comparable to the E1 (−1.167 V) of PCBM or even more negative. At the same time, the E1 values of 3a and 4a were more negative than those reported for compounds 6 (−1.181 V) and 7 (−1.114 V), which were used as ETMs in PSCs, and had higher LUMO energy levels. Therefore, products 3a and 4a may have potential for application in PSCs as ETMs.

In summary, we have developed a straightforward thermal retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction and realized the conversion of the C60-fused lactones to ketones with Tf2O as an unusual reductant. This is the first retro Baeyer–Villiger reaction using traditional thermal methods. The reaction performed under aerobic conditions makes the experimental operations much more simple and convenient. In addition, we have studied the electrochemical reactions of the C60-fused ketone 2a and obtained ring-opened peroxyester or peroxyacid compounds, which may be utilized in further functionalizations and solar cell devices.
