    , Accepted 24th September 2022First published on 29th September 2022AbstractSimultaneous direct production of fuels and chemicals via photocatalytic biomass conversion is an effective strategy to achieve the carbon-neutral goal but no studies on the co-production of CO and xylonic acid have been reported. Here, an efficient CIS/GO@3D-OMA photocatalyst of CdIn2S4 (CIS) anchored on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in a three-dimensional ordered mesoporous aerogel was prepared and successfully used in the co-generation of CO and xylonic acid. Experimental results showed that CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has broad light absorption, high charge density, and fast charge space separation. Correspondingly, the CO and xylonic acid yield achieved 1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1 and 76.76% in the xylose system, respectively. Interestingly, the system is also applicable to xylan (CO: 187.20 μmol g−1 h−1; xylonic acid: 0.2 g gxylan−1). All h+, ˙OH, 1O2 and ˙O2− were conductive to CO and xylonic acid production, in which h+ played a primary role. This study provides a fresh perspective for biomass utilization.
Introduction
With the efforts that have been devoted to studying the long-term vision of coping with climate change this century, capping and reducing carbon emissions have attracted attention, especially the effective combination of photocatalysis and biomass utilization. As the only renewable organic carbon source, biomass can be converted to fuels and chemicals.1 For fuels, hydrogen (H2) and CO can be produced via the selective conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks.2–6 Moreover, photocatalytic biomass conversion to generate high valued chemicals has also been gripped in recent years. However, most studies for the synchronous production of chemicals and H2 from the biomass aqueous solution were reported, in which H2 generated from water splitting and biomass served as a sacrificial agent.7–11 However, for the CO, when no additional carbon source was added, CO could be generated via the selective oxidation of biomass only. For example, Wang et al. reported that CO could be generated from glycerol via Cu/TiO2 under the irradiation of LED light (365 nm), giving 0.06 mmol g−1 h−1 of CO evolution.12 To enhance CO evolution, Zhou et al. reported a Z-scheme CdS@g-C3N4 for photo-reforming biopolyols to CO in the O2 atmosphere,4 and the CO evolution rate reached 1.27 mmol g−1 h−1. However, the O2-rich atmosphere and long reaction time limited their popularization. Furthermore, the synchronous generation of chemicals and gaseous fuels (CO) via biomass splitting in one system is of great significance.
Xylose is one of the essential units of xylan hemicellulose, which ranks second in content among the biomass-derived monosaccharides.13 The effective application of xylose is a prerequisite and key parameter to achieve the valuable utilization of xylan hemicellulose. Various value-added products can be obtained via xylose conversion, including xylonic acid, xylitol, and lactic acid.14–20 Amongst these, xylonic acid is an upcoming organic acid identified among the top 30 valuable biomass-derived chemicals by the US DOE,21 which has been used as an acid catalyst and environmental medium in three-component reactions.22 The utilization of xylonic acid in building materials has obvious economic advantages, which is intended to displace gluconic acid or calcium lignosulfonate as the water reducer of modern cement.23 The extensive utilization of xylonic acid has considerable economic and social benefits and also contributes to protecting the environment, consequently attracting more attention in its synthesis. Photocatalysis is a potential method for biorefinery, as the criteria of high efficiency, low cost, and mild reaction condition could be achieved by directly introducing sunlight. In this case, Chen et al. reported a novel photocatalyst composed of TiO2 nano-particles in situ grown on MXenes nanosheets (TiO2/MXenes) for photocatalytic synthesis of xylonic acid in alkali systems, which obtained a yield of 64.2% with outstanding stability.24 To improve the yield of xylonic acid, a series of photocatalysts of ZnS@Bi2S3 and P@CN-SO3H was prepared, which could regulate electron (e−)-hole (h+) separation to promote the production of xylonic acid, obtaining a yield of 74.2% and 88.1%, respectively.21,25 Although those photocatalysts exhibited good photocatalytic performance, the gaseous products were not studied. Therefore, the photo-splitting of biomass to co-produce CO and xylonic acid is novel and attractive, but no reports have been achieved. To achieve this goal, the design and construction of an efficient photocatalyst is essential.
CdIn2S4 (CIS) is a ternary semiconductor photoelectric material and has a narrow bandgap (2.5 eV), wide optical absorption range, and excellent thermal stability as compared with other bimetallic sulfides.26 These outstanding physicochemical properties enable CIS to be successfully used in some advanced areas, such as solar cells, organism conversion, and H2 production. However, photo-corrosion and the suboptimal charge separation of CIS limit its development in photocatalysis.27 For these challenges, some strategies have been developed, such as modulating the morphology, constructing a heterojunction, and anchoring on supporters. Correspondingly, He et al. prepared an ultrathin CIS nanosheet with numerous nanopores via hydrothermal strategy, and the obtained CIS showed an excellent H2 evolution rate (7515 μmol g−1 h−1).28 Wang et al. reported a CdIn2S4/InOx/NiFe-LDH catalyst with an adaptive junction, which displayed excellent stability. As compared with CIS, the H2 release of the CdIn2S4/CNFs/Co4S3 system achieved 25.87 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 16.8-fold that of CIS.29 Furthermore, as is well known, GO has excellent hydrophilic characteristic, rich oxygen-containing functional groups, and strong adsorption capacity, which are the required properties for photocatalysis. In photocatalysis, GO has been used to construct a 3D porous g-C3N4/GO skeleton, and precious metal (Au, Pd, Pt) cocatalysts were then anchored to form g-C3N4/GO-M (Au, Pd, Pt).30 The light absorption and separation of carriers of g-C3N4/GO-Pt were significantly enhanced as compared to g-C3N4/GO, resulting in an achieved H2 release of 2565.81 μmol g−1 h−1 by g-C3N4/GO-Pt.27 Previous - studies have shown that graphene with different oxidation levels have different band gap widths (2.4–4.3 eV), and the corresponding intrinsic absorption wavelength range is 288 nm–516 nm.31 Thus, the combination of GO and CIS can be considered as a practicable pathway to promote the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst.
In this study, we developed an efficient strategy for the photo-splitting of xylose and xylan to co-produce CO and xylonic acid via CIS/GO@3D-OMA. Initially, the CIS/GO@3D-OMA was prepared, and the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has broad light absorption, high charge density, and fast charge space separation, which is beneficial for the synchronous generation of CO and xylonic acid. The CO release and xylonic acid yield achieved 1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1 and 76.76% in the xylose system, respectively. Among the materials, the CO evolution of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 system is ∼9.5 times higher than that of the original CIS, suggesting that the synergism between CIS and GO is beneficial for the CO evolution. Furthermore, the system is applicable to macromolecular xylan (CO: 187.20 μmol g−1 h−1; xylonic acid: 0.2 g gxylan−1). The electron spin-resonance (ESR) characterization results indicated that the h+, ˙OH, ˙O2−, and 1O2 were generated in the photocatalytic system, and their concentrations increased with the irradiation time. Poisoning experiments showed that all active oxidation species facilitated CO and xylonic acid production, in which h+ played a major role. This work opens a new perspective for biomass conversion.
Results and discussion
As displayed in Fig. 1A, the CIS/GO@3D-OMA was prepared via a two-step route, including (i) the preparation of spherical complex formed by the self-assembly of 2D CIS nanosheets, (ii) the forming of CIS/GO@3D-OMA in a mixture of GO, CIS, and sodium alginate (ALG) via ultrasonic mixing-visually guided freeze drying. Firstly, the morphologies of the obtained CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As displayed in Fig. 1B and C, the CIS presented a 2D structure. Fig. 1D–F display the SEM images of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3, which present an orderly layered structure, and the 2D CIS was embedded on GO nanosheets. The EDS results (Fig. S1†) indicated that C, O, S, Cd and In existed in the photocatalyst, and their corresponding contents are 38.96, 34.73, 7.86, 7.93, and 10.53 wt%, respectively. Fig. 1G–K indicate the uniform distribution of S, In, Cd, C and O in CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3. The above results preliminarily prove the successful preparation of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA. As depicted in Fig. 1L, some 2D CIS were embedded on GO nanosheets. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image displays a lattice distance of 0.378 nm (Fig. 1M), showing the (220) crystal plane of CIS (JCPDS No. 27-0060), further evidencing the successful preparation of CIS/GO@3D-OMA.

Fig. 2A illustrates the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3, and their isotherms all display type-IV model and H3 hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of a large amount of mesopores. The pore size distribution curves of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are exhibited in Fig. 2B. As compared with CIS, the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has higher contents of mesopores, and the surface area of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 (9.85 m2 g−1) is higher than that of CIS (6.95 m2 g−1), suggesting that more active sites existed on CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3.

The crystallographic structures of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology. As shown in Fig. 2C, the diffraction peaks at 23.2°, 27.2°, 33.0°, 40.7°, 43.3° and 47.4° are assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystal planes of the CIS (JCPDS No. 27-0060), respectively. The XRD patterns illustrated that the crystallographic structure of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 had no change after the introduction of GO, which corresponds to the TEM results. Significantly, the diffraction peaks of pure CIS are much stronger than those of CIS/GO@3D-OMA, which indicates the high crystallinity of CIS. Moreover, the signals of all diffraction peaks are weakened by the introduction of GO, resulting in decreasing crystallinity of CIS/GO@3D-OMA. To further investigate the effect of GO on the crystallinity, CIS/GO@3D-OMA containing different contents of GO were analyzed by XRD (Fig. 2D). For the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystal planes, a higher GO content of the composite sample corresponded to lower crystallinity.28 The above results indicated the successful synthesis of these photocatalysts.
To study the chemical state of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done. Fig. 3A shows that CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 consists of Cd, In, S, C, O, and Na, which is consistent with the EDS results. For the Cd 3d spectra (Fig. 3B), the spectra observed at 405.9 and 411.8 eV are identified as Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively, and attributed to the +2 state of the Cd cation.32,33 Two peaks (443.8 eV and 451.4 eV) were observed in the In 3d spectra (Fig. 3C), which are In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, indicating the appearance of In3+ in CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3.34Fig. 3D displays the S 2p spectra. The peaks at 162.9 and 161.4 eV conform to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, indicating the existence of S2− in CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3.35 Moreover, three peaks at 168.4, 166.0, and 164.8 eV correspond to SO42−, SO32−, and S–O,36 respectively, which may be due to the combination of the CIS with GO or ALG. The C 1s spectra of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and GO are shown in Fig. 3E. CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 can be divided into three peaks of CO (288.4 eV), C–O (286.7 eV), and C–C (284.8 eV).37 GO presents two peaks for the C 1s. The 287.05 eV belongs to the C–O/CO bond and the 284.8 eV corresponds to the C–C bond.38 It is noteworthy that the C–O/CO region accounts for 87.0% of the whole, indicating that abundant oxygen-containing groups existed in GO, which can wreck the ordered structure of graphene and produce a mass of defects in GO.39 The above results confirmed that the obtained GO has high defect density. For the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3F), the C–O/CO (533.1 eV) and O–H (531.6 eV) peaks were observed.40 With regards to GO, the C–O/CO peak can be observed at 532.79 eV.38,41 The XPS results further evidence the successful preparation of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and the interaction between CIS and GO.

Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was then applied to study the visible light absorption of the photocatalysts (Fig. 4A). Obviously, as compared with the CIS, the absorption edge of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was extended, indicating that anchoring of CIS on GO significantly improved the visible light absorption.42–44 Meanwhile, with the increase of GO addition, the visible light absorption region was broadened (Fig. S2†). Furthermore, the energy bandgaps (Eg) of the CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 can be computed by (αhν) = A(hν − Eg)n/2 (inset in Fig. 4A).45 As is well known, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 is a semiconductor of indirect bandgap (n = 4).27,46 Therefore, the estimated Eg of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are 2.33 and 2.06 eV, respectively, implying the enhanced photocatalytic performance of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3. This may be derived from the interaction between CIS and GO. Based on the Eg values of CIS (2.33 eV) and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 (2.06 eV) that were calculated via the above formula, the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) positions of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3, consequently, were further investigated via the Mott-Schottky (M–S) plots and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As Fig. 4B and C show, the M–S plots of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 show positive slopes, demonstrating that both are n-type semiconductors. Thus, the CB of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are −0.87 and −0.79 V vs. NHE., respectively. According to the UPS results (Fig. 4D), the work function (Φ) is calculated to obtain VB (Φ = 21.20 − Ecutoff). The Φ values of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are 5.04 eV (21.20–16.16 eV) and 4.90 eV (21.20–16.30 eV), respectively. The values of Φ relate to the electron binding energy of photocatalysts. As a result, the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has weaker electron binding, and its charge separation ability is probably increased. The EVB (vs. vacuum) = Φ + Eedge is used to calculate the VB of the materials. Thus, the EVB (vs. vacuum) of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are 5.90 and 5.91 eV, respectively. The formula discussed in the previous report was used to transform EVB (vs. vacuum) into EVB (vs. NHE.).8,47 In the end, the VB values of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are 1.46 and 1.47 V vs. NHE., respectively. The band energy diagrams of CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 are clearly shown in Fig. S3.† The CB of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 is lower than that of CIS, which is possibly caused by the combination of the CIS with GO. It is noteworthy that CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 possesses a slightly higher VB value, indicating that it has stronger capability to generate h+ and oxidizing ability.48

As depicted in Fig. S4,† the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was observably enhanced as compared to that of CIS, which is possibly ascribed to the abundant defects on GO that can serve as the centers of charge recombination. Subsequently, to validate this conjecture, the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 photocatalyst and GO were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 5A). The characteristic peaks of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and GO were observed at 1342 cm−1 (D band) and 1587 cm−1 (G band),39,49 respectively. The density of defects in the carbon materials is indicated by the ID/IG values, which is relevant to the defect degree.35 The ID/IG values of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and GO are 0.86 and 0.88, respectively, suggesting that the prepared GO has a high defect density, which is consistent with the XPS results. It may promote charge recombination. For the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) diagram, the radius of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 is smaller than that of CIS (Fig. 5B), indicating that the charge transfer rate of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 is significantly enhanced,50 thus boosting the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 shows the minimum radius among the series of CIS/GO@3D-OMA (Fig. S5†), suggesting the optimal charge transfer rate of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3. Fig. 5C shows the photocurrent response of GO, CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3. The photocurrent response of CIS is much higher than that of GO and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3, which may be caused by the poor conductivity of GO.51 However, the anchored CIS on GO significantly improved its surface area, resulting in an enhanced adsorption performance of the reactants. Furthermore, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has better recycling performance when compared with CIS. As for CIS/GO@3D-OMA, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has the best photocurrent response as compared with other CIS/GO@3D-OMA (Fig. S6†), corresponding to the highest photocatalytic activity of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3. To assess the photo-voltage and life-time of the photon-generated carriers, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was carried out. As compared with GO, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 exhibited a stronger photo-voltage (Fig. 5D), reflecting the greater energy of the photo-generated carriers. However, the photo-voltage of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 decayed faster than that of GO, which may originate from more defects in GO that can serve as the recombination centers of the e−–h+ pairs, which is in agreement with the analysis of PL, Raman, and photocurrent response plots.

The photocatalytic performance of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was investigated via synchronous production of CO and xylonic acid from xylose. As is well known, acidic and neutral conditions are unfavorable for xylonic acid production via photocatalysis.14,21,38 Here, the roles of different alkalinity on the co-generation of CO and xylonic acid via CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 were studied. As displayed in Fig. 6A, the production of xylonic acid was firstly enhanced from 38.73% to 76.76% with the KOH concentrations increasing from 0.05 mol L−1 to 0.10 mol L−1, and then began to decrease with increasing alkalinity. This may be caused by the peroxidation of the obtained xylonic acid. During these processes, the conversion of xylose increased monotonically with the enhanced alkalinity, and a certain number of byproducts were generated (Fig. S7†). For the CO evolution rate, it first increased and then decreased with a maximum of 1018.74 μmol g−1 h−1 at 0.15 mol L−1. According to the previous reports,4,12,52 CO was generated from the aldehyde group oxidation in glyceraldehyde. Interestingly, the obtained glyceraldehyde yield also tended to increase first and then decrease, which is in accordance with the CO evolution. This is ascribed to the growth of the oxidation activity with KOH concentration, resulting in the peroxidation of glyceraldehyde, thereby reducing the CO generation.53 Furthermore, as is well known, irradiation time also plays a crucial role in photocatalytic biomass conversion. The reaction system with 5 mg of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and 200 mg of xylose was then performed at ∼50 °C with different irradiation times. As the irradiation time was extended, the xylonic acid yield first increased and then decreased, and the highest yield of 76.76% was achieved at 2 h (Fig. 6B). For xylose conversion, it also increased with irradiation time. However, when the irradiation time exceeded 2 h, the change trend was no longer obvious (Fig. S8†). Similarly, lactic acid, glyceraldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid were also examined (Fig. S8†). Fig. 6B also shows that the CO evolution was enhanced rapidly in the beginning, and finally wavered around a certain value (0.5 h: 785.40 μmol g−1, 1.0 h: 1119.36 μmol g−1, 1.5 h: 1958.01 μmol g−1, 2 h: 2427.76 μmol g−1, 2.5 h: 2523.40 μmol g−1, 3.0 h: 2529.23 μmol g−1). Correspondingly, the yield of glyceraldehyde decreased from 6.40% to 5.29% with the extension of the irradiation time.
 Fig. 6  (A) The effects of the KOH concentration (xylose: 200 mg; CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3: 5 mg; KOH solution: 0.05–0.20 M, 20 mL; irradiation time: 3 h) and (B) reaction time (xylose: 200 mg; CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3: 5 mg; KOH solution: 0.10 M, 20 mL; irradiation time: 0.5–3.0 h) on the CO release and xylose reforming via CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3. (C) The recycling test (xylose: 200 mg; CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3: 5 mg; KOH solution: 0.10 M, 20 mL; irradiation time: 2.0 h) of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 photocatalyst. (D) The effects of GO, CIS, and the GO dosages (xylose: 200 mg; photocatalysts: 5 mg; KOH solution: 0.10 M, 20 mL; irradiation time: 2.0 h) in CIS/GO@3D-OMA on the co-production of CO and xylonic acid from xylose. 
The stability of the photocatalyst plays an essential role in its practical application. Here, a series of cyclic tests was performed. Typically, the reactor with CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 (5 mg), KOH solution (20 mL, 0.1 M), xylose (200 mg), and Ar (110 kPa) was done. As displayed in Fig. 6C, the CO generation rate and xylonic acid yield are 1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1/76.76%, 1151.73 μmol g−1 h−1/77.24%, 1185.57 μmol g−1 h−1/76.38%, 1179.85 μmol g−1 h−1/74.96%, and 1140.09 μmol g−1 h−1/73.97%, respectively. Obviously, these results indicated that CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has excellent recyclability. Furthermore, no obvious change of the fresh CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and reused CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. S9†), indicating that CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has excellent stability.
As is well known, xylose is the main unit of xylan. As discussed above, the synchronous production of CO and xylonic acid from xylose solution via CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 photocatalysis was achieved, however, it is not clear what happens to the macromolecular xylan. Here, two reaction systems with xylose and xylan were performed under the same conditions (Fig. S10†). For xylose, 1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1 of CO and 168.40 mg of xylonic acid were achieved, whereas 187.20 μmol g−1 h−1 of CO and 38.56 mg of xylonic acid were detected in the xylan system. The difference is attributed to the fact that xylan is first converted into xylose. Overall, the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 photocatalytic system has excellent universality on the synchronous production of CO and xylonic acid from xylose and macromolecular xylan.
As discussed above, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has excellent photocatalytic performance, stability, reusability, and universality on the synchronous production of CO and xylonic acid. The effects of different components and their ratios on its photocatalytic activity were then studied. Firstly, the xylonic acid yield and CO yields were 54.64%/176.92 μmol g−1 h−1 and 42.50%/127.35 μmol g−1 h−1 during the pure GO and CIS photocatalytic systems, respectively (Fig. 6D), suggesting that GO and CIS are beneficial for the co-production of CO and xylonic acid. For CIS/GO@3D-OMA, the photocatalytic performances on CO generation (CIS/GO@3D-OMA-1: 827.91 μmol g−1 h−1, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-2: 1120.77 μmol g−1 h−1, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3: 1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-4: 1103.36 μmol g−1 h−1) and xylonic acid yield (CIS/GO@3D-OMA-1: 57.09%, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-2: 69.94%, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3: 76.76%, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-4: 56.05%) increased first and then decreased. The CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 also had excellent activities on the co-production of CO (1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1) and xylonic acid (76.76%). For this phenomenon, the first reason is that the relatively high content of GO in CIS/GO@3D-OMA unavoidably reduces the contact area of CIS with visible light, leading to weakened photocatalytic performance.54 The second is that an appropriate addition of GO can extend the lifetime of charge carriers and accelerate the separation/transmission of e−–h+ pairs. However, when excessive GO was introduced, the excessive defects in CIS/GO@3D-OMA will become the recombination centers of photo-generated carriers to accelerate the reorganization of the e−–h+ pairs, thus reducing the photocatalytic ability.55 Correspondingly, these phenomena are consistent with the analysis of EIS and the photocurrent response (Fig. S5 and S6†). Similarly, the byproducts of lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, and glyceraldehyde were also produced (Fig. S11†).
As is well known, active oxidation species could be generated in the photo-oxidation processes, and ESR characterization was used to identify them. Initially, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) was used as an ESR label to identify e− and h+. TEMPO showed a signal with an intensity of 1:1:1, and when e− was produced, the signal peak weakened (Fig. 7A). For e−, two phenomena were observed. One is that the signal peak weakened with increasing illumination time in the CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 systems. The other is that the signal intensity of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 system is lower than that of CIS under the same conditions. These results indicated that e− was produced in the CIS or CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 system with the assistance of visible light irradiation, and the e− concentration of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 system is higher than that of CIS, suggesting that the anchoring of CIS on GO significantly enhanced its e− concentration. With regard to h+, its production is consistent with e−, leading to the similar change trend (Fig. 7B).

(Control: in the dark conditions or irradiation without spin-labeling, a and b represent CIS and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 with the same irradiation time, respectively). 
Next, ˙O2− and ˙OH were analyzed with the assistance of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). DMPO can combine with short-lived radicals to form the adducts of DMPO/˙O2− and DMPO/˙OH, which were analyzed using ESR. The characteristic peak of DMPO/˙O2− was not observed under the control conditions (Fig. 7C), suggesting that no ˙O2− was generated. The signal intensity of DMPO/˙O2− with 1:1:1:1 appeared after illumination for 5 min, and the peak intensities were further enhanced with increasing irradiation time, which indicated the continuous generation of ˙O2−. Furthermore, the signal intensity of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 system was higher than that of CIS, indicating more ˙O2− generation. For ˙OH, the DMPO/˙OH presents similar results with that of DMPO/˙O2−, in addition to its intensity with 1:2:2:1 (Fig. 7D).
As a special and highly selective active oxidation specie, 1O2 is not directly detected using ESR. Thus, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperldone-1-oxyl (TEMPONE) was employed as the ESR spin-label to detect the 1O2 production. A signal with 1:1:1 intensity was detected after TEMPONE was combined with 1O2. As shown in Fig. 7E, the intensity of the triplet peak increased with increasing irradiation time, demonstrating the continuous production of 1O2 under light irradiation. As compared with CIS, the production of 1O2 with CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was faster, suggesting that CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 can generate more 1O2, which is beneficial for the photo-oxidation of xylose.
To investigate the effects of h+, ˙OH, 1O2, and ˙O2− on the co-production of xylonic acid and CO, poisoning tests were done. In this study, various sacrificial agents (5 mmol) were added into the reaction systems to inhibit different active oxidative species (p-benzoquinone: BQ, p-phthalic acid: PTA, tryptophan: Trp, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid: EDTA). As shown in Fig. 7F, when the sacrificial agents were added to the reaction systems, the xylonic acid yield and CO evolution are lower than that of the ‘no sacrificial agents addition system’, in which no xylonic acid and only a trace amount of CO (153.49 μmol g−1 h−1) were detected during the EDTA addition system, indicating that the effects of h+, ˙OH, 1O2, and ˙O2− in the co-production of CO and xylonic acid were decreased in turn.
According to the previous reports4,21,38,56 and experimental results, a possible conversion pathway of xylose via CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 photocatalysis was proposed. As shown in Fig. 8, when CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was irradiated by visible light, e−–h+ pairs are formed and participate in the generation of oxidation active species. Following, h+ reacted with H2O in the reaction system to form O2 and H+. The excited e− then combined with O2 to generate ˙O2−, whereas the h+ reacted with OH− to give ˙OH. The generated ˙O2− further reacted with h+ to produce 1O2. Furthermore, the poisoning experiments indicated that h+, ˙O2−, ˙OH and 1O2 are all beneficial for the xylose conversion to xylonic acid, in which h+ played the primary role. Here, the aldehyde groups of xylose were directly oxidized to carboxyl groups by the active oxidation species in an alkaline solution with the xylonic acid production. On the other hand, some of the xylose and the obtained xylonic acid underwent peroxidation to generate the intermediate I via α-oxidation and intermediate II via β-oxidation. Oxalic acid was then obtained from intermediate II, and then converted to formic acid. Similarly, intermediate I was also ultimately oxidized into the formic acid. Meanwhile, xylose could be also isomerized to give intermediate III and intermediate IV. On the one hand, the obtained intermediate III was converted to glyceraldehyde and lactic acid through the retro-aldol mechanism. On the other hand, oxalic acid could be also produced from it, and then converted to formic acid. As for intermediate IV, it could be oxidized to intermediate V and acetic acid via α-oxidation. During these processes, CO could be generated via the oxidation of the aldehyde group in glyceraldehyde and the dehydration of formic acid.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed an efficient and novel visible-light-driven photo-splitting of biomass to co-generate CO and xylonic acid. Initially, an efficient CIS/GO@3D-OMA photocatalyst of CIS anchored on GO nanosheets in a three-dimensional ordered mesoporous aerogel was prepared. CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has broad light absorption, high charge density, and fast charge space separation as compared with CIS. The relatively high content of GO in CIS/GO@3D-OMA reduced the contact area of CIS with visible light, and the excessive GO introduction will become the recombination center of photo-generated carriers, thereby reducing the lifetime of the charge carriers and breaking the separation/transmission of the e−–h+ pairs. Correspondingly, the photo-splitting of xylose gave excellent yields of CO (1213.88 μmol g−1 h−1) and xylonic acid (76.76%) using CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 photocatalysis. The CO release of the CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 system is also ∼9.5 times higher than that of the original CIS. For xylan, the system is also applicable, and the CO and xylonic acid yield achieved 187.20 μmol g−1 h−1 and 0.2 g gxylan−1. Meanwhile, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 has wonderful chemical stability. ESR characterization and poisoning experiments revealed that h+, ˙OH, ˙O2−, and 1O2 all facilitated the co-production of CO and xylonic acid, in which h+ took a major role. This work provides a fresh perspective and thought process on biomass conversion.
Experimental section
Preparation of CIS
Typically, a mixture of 0.46 g of Cd(NO3)2·xH2O, 1.92 g of indium chloride (InCl3), and 0.34 g of thioacetamide (TAA) was combined with ultrapure water (50 mL) with constant mixing. The obtained liquid was then treated in an autoclave (100 mL) with a Teflon liner at 180 °C for 20 h. Finally, the yellow powers were flushed repeatedly with ultrapure water and ethanol, and subsequently transferred to an oven at 60 °C for a period to give CIS.
Preparation of CIS/GO@3D-OMA photocatalysts
The GO was prepared according to the previous report.57 For the CIS/GO@3D-OMA preparation, firstly, a mixture of GO and CIS (50 mg) was added into 25 mL of ultrapure water under ultrasound. Subsequently, 50 mg of ALG was gradually dissolved into the above mixture. The obtained mixture was treated via freeze-drying to give CIS/GO@3D-OMA. Amongst the series, the photocatalysts were named as CIS/GO@3D-OMA-1, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-2, CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and CIS/GO@3D-OMA-4 with the GO addition of 11.1%, 20.0%, 33.3%, and 50.0%, respectively.
Photocatalytic synchronous production of CO and xylonic acid via CIS/GO@3D-OMA
Typically, 5 mg of CIS/GO@3D-OMA and 200 mg of xylose were mixed into KOH solution (20 mL) with different alkalinities. The obtained mixture was treated with ultrasound for 1 min to scatter CIS/GO@3D-OMA uniformly, and then transferred to reactors. Those obtained reactors were flushed with Ar (110 kPa) for 5 times to dislodge air, and then reacted for a period of time with continuous stirring under visible light irradiation (300 W). The reaction temperature was maintained at ∼50 °C. After that, the obtained CO and chemicals were detected by gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively.
Poisoning experiments
The influences of the h+, ˙OH, ˙O2−, and 1O2 on the system were explored. Typically, 5 mmol of sacrificial agent, 5 mg of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and 200 mg of xylose were put into KOH solution (20 mL, 0.1 M). The obtained mixture was treated with ultrasonication for 1 min and then transferred to reactors. The reactors were then purged with Ar (110 kPa) for 5 times to eliminate air. Afterwards, the reactors were reacted at ∼50 °C under visible light irradiation (300 W) for 2 h. The obtained products were also separately detected by GC and HPLC.
Recycling tests
The recycling tests were carried out using a similar approach as above. Typically, 5 mg of CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 and 200 mg of xylose were put into KOH solution (20 mL, 0.1 M), and the obtained mixture was treated with ultrasonic for 1 min and transferred into a reactor. The reactors were purged with Ar (110 kPa) for 5 times to eliminate air, and then reacted at ∼50 °C for 2 h under irradiation (300 W). After that, the corresponding products were separately detected by GC and HPLC. The photocatalyst was recovered by vacuum filtration after reaction. The recovered CIS/GO@3D-OMA-3 was flushed and dehydrated at 60 °C for 12 h.
