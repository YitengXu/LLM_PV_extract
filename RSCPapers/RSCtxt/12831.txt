    , Accepted 17th September 2022First published on 19th September 2022AbstractIntroducing suitable interfacial chemical bonds into heterojunctions can increase the charge carrier density, propel the charge separation, and facilitate interfacial charge extraction in photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, tuning chemical bonds at heterojunction interfaces and elucidating their influences on band alignment and the associated evolution of PEC performance remain elusive. Herein, Bi–S bonds were introduced into the interface of a CdIn2S4 (CIS)/Bi2WO6 (BWO) heterojunction. In situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron spin resonance signals confirm that the Bi–S bond transforms the band alignment from type II to the direct Z-scheme, significantly enhancing the carrier separation efficiency. Theoretical calculations show that the Bi–S bond not only acts as an atomic-level charge transfer channel, but also changes the migration pathway and distance within the heterojunction. As a result, the optimized CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits a relatively high PEC performance of 4.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (VRHE) and a low onset potential of 0.30 VRHE. This work presents a new avenue to construct comprehensively improved photoanodes by tuning the interfacial structures at the atomic level.
Introduction
In order to alleviate the current energy crisis and environmental pollution, an attractive approach utilizes PEC water splitting to convert the intermittent solar energy to easily accessible hydrogen directly.1–3 Photoanodes with sluggish four-electron reactions are the bottlenecks of PEC water splitting.4 Ternary metal sulfides, such as CIS,5 ZnIn2S4,6,7 and ZnxCd1−xS,8 are considered as promising photoanode materials due to their advantages of tunable band gap and excellent visible light absorption. Specifically, CIS, with tunable band gap (2.2–2.5 eV), suitable band position, and diverse and adjustable chemical structures, has been considered as a promising candidate for solar water oxidation, whereas the severe bulk carrier recombination significantly hinders the photocatalytic properties of a single CIS in the PEC field.9
Constructing heterojunctions with suitable band alignment is an effective strategy to promote the bulk carrier separation of photoanodes for PEC water splitting.10–12 Recently, constructing Z-scheme heterojunctions, which can separate photo-generated carriers spatially and preserve the redox potential of materials, has emerged as an effective strategy for obtaining highly efficient photoanodes.13,14 The prerequisite for constructing Z-scheme heterojunctions is band structure matching, in which the conduction band (CB) of one semiconductor should be close to the valence band (VB) of the other semiconductor.15–17 According to previous reports, the CB of BWO (+0.62 eV) is much lower than that of CIS (−0.58 eV),18,19 but it is very close to the VB of CIS (+1.51 eV), suggesting that the photo-generated electrons are more likely transferred to the VB of CIS and recombine with photo-generated holes on the VB of CIS, which forms a Z-scheme carrier transfer pathway. However, the interfacial connection between CIS and BWO is generally poor, which prevents the transfer of charge flow. In addition, the gradient band alignment enables the spontaneous formation of a type II heterojunction between CIS and BWO, which makes the energy band of CIS bend downward and the energy band of BWO bend upward. Nevertheless, the construction of type II heterojunctions fixes the charge carrier transfer direction and sacrifices the redox potential of components.20 Therefore, the unfavorable interfacial charge transfer and band bending become obstacles for constructing Z-scheme heterojunctions. Recently, the construction of heterostructures induced by interfacial chemical bonds has motivated the thought of assembling heterostructures with specific atomic-level interfacial contacts.21 Chemical bonds act as atomic-level channels to accelerate the charge transfer between semiconductors.22 Furthermore, the internal electric field within heterojunctions has been considered as an effective strategy to promote the construction of Z-scheme heterojunctions as well. Under the influence of an internal electric field, the photo-generated electrons on the conduction band of semiconductors with a relatively lower Fermi level (EF) can transfer to the valence band of semiconductors with higher EF values, thus modulating the band bending and realizing the Z-scheme charge transfer.23 Furthermore, the existence of interfacial chemical bonds may change the work function of materials forming heterojunctions, which in turn affects the EF and internal electric field of heterojunctions.24 Therefore, an efficient Z-scheme heterojunction can be obtained by reasonably modulating the interfacial chemical bond within the heterojunction. On the one hand, it can promote carrier transport, and on the other hand, it can adjust the internal electric field and band bending to promote the construction of Z-scheme heterojunctions for PEC water oxidation.
Herein, we successfully prepared a composite CIS/BWO heterojunction with a rationally designed Bi–S interfacial chemical bond at the interface. The interfacial Bi–S bond converts the type II heterojunction into a direct Z-scheme heterojunction, which effectively improves the carrier separation efficiency of the photoanode. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Bi–S bonds act as atomic-scale charge-flow highways to promote the interfacial charge transfer. The work function calculations illustrate that an internal electric field is formed when CIS with a high EF and BWO with a low EF are in contact, which results in a Z-scheme charge carrier transfer pathway. As a result, the optimum CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits the highest photocurrent density of 4.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and a low-onset potential of 0.30 VRHE. This work provides a reference for studying the role of chemical bonds inside heterojunction photoanodes.
Experimental section
Materials
Cadmium nitrate hydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O), indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3·xH2O), and sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. Bismuth nitrate hydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), thiourea, and ethylene glycol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Synthesis of the CIS photoanode
The CIS photoanode was prepared using a facile hydrothermal method. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.01 M Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 0.02 M In(NO3)3·xH2O, and 0.04 M thiourea in 50 ml of deionized (DI) water. A piece of clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was placed into a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with the conducting side facing down. Then, 10 ml of precursor solution was slowly injected into the autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction temperature and time were set as 200 °C and 4 h, respectively. The resulting sample was rinsed with DI water and absolute ethanol more than 3 times and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 12 h.
Synthesis of the CIS/BWO photoanode
The CIS/BWO photoanode was prepared using a facile solvothermal method. 1.9402 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 80 ml of ethylene glycol to form solution A. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.6594 g of Na2WO4 and 0.1000 g of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in 40 ml of DI water and 40 ml of ethylene glycol. Then, solutions A and B were mixed and sonicated for 20 min to obtain precursor solution C. The CIS photoanode was placed in a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with the working side facing down. Then, 10 ml of precursor solution C was slowly injected into the autoclave. The solvothermal reaction temperature and time were controlled to regulate the amount of BWO. The composite photoanode was washed with DI water more than three times and dried in air at 80 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of the CIS–BWO photoanode
BWO was prepared using a facile solvothermal method as mentioned above. 1.9402 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 80 ml of ethylene glycol to form solution A. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.6594 g of Na2WO4 and 0.1000 g of CTAB in 40 ml of DI water and 40 ml of ethylene glycol. Precursor solution C was prepared by mixing solutions A and B and sonicating for 20 min. Then, 10 ml of precursor solution C was slowly injected into a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The solvothermal reaction temperature and time were 160 °C and 10 h, respectively. The powder was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried at 80 °C in air. Then, the BWO powder was dissolved in water for spin coating. The BWO dispersion solution was spin-coated onto the as-prepared CIS photoanode at 3000 rpm for 20 s.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010). The microstructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20 200 kV, FEI, USA). The phase and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D8 ADVANCE). The chemical composition and element valence states were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). Raman spectra were recorded using an intelligent Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, XploRA ONE). Room temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with pellets made from dried KBr (Macklin) using a TENSOR II FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker). A UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) was used to investigate the light absorption ability of the samples. TRPL spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments LifeSpec II with a 450 nm laser (FLS1000, laser pulse width 81.9 ps).
PEC measurements
PEC measurement was carried out in a three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab, PGSTAT 302N). The as-prepared photoanodes, saturated Ag/AgCl, and Pt mesh electrodes were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. A neutral solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte (pH = 6.7). A simulated solar light of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) was provided by a sunlight simulator (Newport, 94043A). LSV plots were measured at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded under AM 1.5G illumination in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at the open-circuit potential in the frequency range of 10−1 to 105 Hz with a 5 mV amplitude. Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were obtained in the dark at alternating current (AC) frequencies of 3, 5, 7, and 9 kHz. The measured potential versus Ag/AgCl (EAg/AgCl) was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode potential (ERHE) using the Nernst formula: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.1976(1)
Computational details
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package.25,26 The projector augmented wave method was used for describing electron–ion interactions,27 and the generalized gradient approximation parametrized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional for solids was used.28 The orbitals of 4d105s2, 5s25p1, 3s23p4, 6s26p3, 5d46s2, and 2s22p4 were explicitly treated as valence electrons for Cd, In, S, Bi, W, and O, respectively. A cutoff energy of 500 eV for the plane-wave basis set and a Γ-centered 4 × 4 × 1 k-point mesh were used. For structural optimization, the computational unit cell contains a vacuum space of at least 15 Å in the c direction and atoms in the bottom four layers of the CIS are frozen to mimic a thick substrate, while all other atoms are relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces are less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The convergence threshold of the self-consistent field iteration was set to 10−6 eV.
Results and discussion
The preparation process of the CIS/BWO photoanode is shown in Fig. 1a. First, the CIS photoanode was prepared on an FTO substrate using a facile hydrothermal method. Then, the BWO film was coated on the CIS photoanode via a simple solvothermal reaction with the reaction temperature and time set at 160 °C and 10 h, respectively, and the synthesized composite sample is denoted as CIS/BWO. Interestingly, Bi–S bonds are formed at the interface of CIS and BWO, which may originate from the high temperature and high pressure during the solvothermal reaction. For comparison, the composite CIS–BWO photoanode without Bi–S bonds at the interface was prepared via the spin-coating method and the synthesis details are presented in the Experimental section. The corresponding molecular structure models of the CIS/BWO and CIS–BWO photoanodes are shown in Fig. 1a. The SEM image in Fig. 1b reveals that the as-prepared CIS photoanode possesses a pyramid morphology, and the pure CIS photoanode shows a smoother surface. Upon coating BWO on the surface of the CIS photoanode, the surface of the CIS/BWO photoanode becomes rough, and an ultrathin film appears on the face of the pyramid (Fig. 1c). Notably, gullies appear at the edges of the pyramid, which may expose the Bi–S bond to the surface. As shown in Fig. 1d, the existence of an ultrathin film on the surface of the octahedron indicates the presence of BWO on the CIS–BWO photoanode as well. The cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S1† indicate that there is no obvious difference in the height between CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO photoanodes. The TEM images in Fig. 1e and f were obtained to provide detailed structural information on the synthesized products. The bare CIS photoanode exhibits a smooth surface, while a nanoparticle layer appears on the surface of the composite CIS/BWO photoanode. The lattice arrangement of the CIS/BWO photoanode was investigated by HRTEM imaging, as shown in Fig. 1g. The lattice space of 0.271 nm corresponds to the (400) plane distance of hexagonal CIS, while the lattice space of 0.273 nm corresponds to the (002) plane of BWO.5 The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping in Fig. S2† exhibits the elemental distribution of the CIS/BWO photoanode, which confirms the uniform distribution of BWO on the CIS surface.

XRD patterns were used to characterize the phases of CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO photoanodes.29 As shown in Fig. S3,† the XRD peaks located at 14.21, 23.28, 28.57, and 33.10° correspond to the (111), (220), (222), and (400) planes of CdIn2S4 (JCPDS: 27-0060), respectively.5 The peak located at 28.27° is ascribed to the (131) plane of Bi2WO6 (JCPDS: 73-2020), which is provided in the enlarged XRD patterns in Fig. 2a for easier observation. The XRD patterns of CIS/BWO photoanodes obtained with the solvothermal reaction at different temperatures are also shown in Fig. S4.† As the reaction temperature increases, the peak located at 25.02° gradually becomes stronger, which is ascribed to the (310) plane of Bi2S3 (JCPDS: 17-0320), indicating that the high temperature is beneficial for the formation of Bi–S bonds.30 The FTIR patterns in Fig. S5† were used to further confirm the existence of Bi–S bonds. As shown in Fig. 2b, apart from the peaks of CIS, additional FTIR peaks located at 684.36 and 774.28 cm−1 are observed, which are ascribed to Bi–O and Bi–S bonds, respectively, suggesting the existence of BWO and Bi–S bonds.31–33 The Raman spectra of CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO photoanodes in Fig. 2c clearly confirm the existence of Bi–S bonds in the CIS/BWO photoanode. The peaks of the CIS/BWO photoanode located at 107.61, 172.49, 183.10, and 235.93 cm−1 correspond to Bi–S bonds.34 Meanwhile, the Raman spectrum of CIS–BWO shows no obvious peak corresponding to Bi–S bonds, verifying that the Bi–S bond can only be obtained at a high temperature and high pressure during the solvothermal reaction. Since the BWO film covering the surface has a certain thickness, the molecular vibration signal of CIS in the range of 300–400 cm−1 becomes weaker. In addition, the in situ construction of Bi–S bonds changes the composition of the surface CIS and reduces the detection signal of CIS. The XPS plots in Fig. 2d also confirm the existence of Bi–S bonds. Compared with the XPS peaks of the CIS–BWO photoanode, an additional XPS peak located at 442.14 eV is ascribed to the Bi–S bond. On the basis of the above results, the only difference between CIS/BWO and CIS–BWO is the presence of the Bi–S bond or not. The UV-vis spectra and corresponding Tauc plots were recorded to characterize the light absorption ability of CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO photoanodes (Fig. 2e and f).35 These photoanodes exhibit similar light absorption performance with a corresponding band gap of 2.30 eV.

According to previous reports, the band positions of CIS and BWO are presented in Fig. 3a, and the specific positions are shown in Table S1.†18,19 The heterojunctions formed by CIS and BWO comply with the type II or Z-scheme carrier transport pathway. To analyze the interfacial charge carrier transfer pathway of CIS/BWO and CIS–BWO photoanodes, in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) was used.36 As shown in Fig. 3b, the CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits two peaks located at 34.85 and 37.00 eV without light irradiation, which are attributed to the characteristic peaks of W 3d5/2 and W 3d3/2 of BWO, respectively. Upon light irradiation, the W 3d characteristic peaks positively shift by 0.27 eV, implying the decreased electron density under light irradiation (Fig. 3c). In comparison, the W 3d characteristic peaks of the CIS–BWO photoanode shift negatively by 0.30 eV. This phenomenon provides direct evidence that the introduction of Bi–S bonds at the interface of CIS and BWO can change the interfacial charge transfer direction. The XPS peaks at 405.36 (Cd 3d5/2) and 412.11 eV (Cd 3d3/2) in Fig. 3d are attributed to CIS measured without light irradiation. The characteristic peaks of CIS/BWO under irradiation shift negatively by 0.55 eV, indicating that the electron density increases and the electrons transfer from BWO to CIS. Meanwhile, the Cd 2d peaks of the CIS–BWO photoanode shift positively, suggesting a completely opposite hole transport direction (Fig. 3e). These binding energy shifts of CIS/BWO and CIS–BWO photoanodes make the charge carrier transfer directions at the heterojunction interfaces clear under the same light irradiation conditions. Specifically, with the assistance of the Bi–S bond, the photogenerated electrons migrate from BWO to CIS while the photogenerated holes transfer from CIS to BWO, which corresponds to the carrier transfer pathway of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction. In contrast, the carrier transfer pathway of the CIS–BWO photoanode exhibits the opposite trend, which is consistent with the type II model. In a word, the introduction of Bi–S bonds can alter the direction of carrier transmission, and eventually change the type of the heterojunction.

To further elucidate the critical role of the Bi–S bond, an electron spin resonance (ESR) radical capture experiment was conducted, and the signals of superoxide anion radicals (·O2−) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH) indicated the accumulation of photogenerated carriers.37,38 As shown in Fig. 3f, bare CIS exhibits no obvious ·OH signal under light illumination, indicating that the holes accumulated in the VB (Ev: +1.51 eV vs. NHE) of CIS cannot oxidize OH− to ·OH. This is because the Ev of CIS is lower than E(OH−/·OH) (+1.99 eV vs. NHE at pH ∼6.5). The CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits distinctly improved ·OH signals under light irradiation, implying that the holes will accumulate on the VB of BWO and the Ev of BWO (+3.22 eV vs. NHE) is higher than E(OH−/·OH). Nevertheless, the CIS–BWO photoanode shows no ·OH signal, which is due to the carrier transfer pathway of the type II heterojunction and the holes thus accumulating on the VB of CIS. The ·O2− signals in Fig. 3g show that pure CIS exhibits obvious DMPO·O2− signals after 10 min of light irradiation, which is because the electrons accumulated on the CB (Ec: −0.58 eV vs. NHE) can reduce O2 to ·O2−. This phenomenon originates from the fact that the Ec of CIS is lower than E(O2/·O2−) (−0.33 eV vs. NHE in pH ∼ 6.5). The CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits almost the same intensity of the DMPO·O2− signal as the CIS photoanode. Combined with the band structures of CIS and BWO in Fig. 3a, the electrons will accumulate on the CB of CIS after forming a CIS/BWO heterojunction with Bi–S bonds at the interface. Meanwhile, the CIS–BWO photoanode exhibits no obvious signal of ·O2−. Accordingly, the CIS/BWO photoanode with Bi–S bonds follows the carrier transfer pathway of the Z-scheme heterojunction while the CIS–BWO photoanode without the Bi–S bond complies with the type II band structure. The origin of this difference is the Bi–S bond, which promotes the band structure shift from type II to the Z-scheme.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured to evaluate the PEC performance of photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 4a, the bare CIS photoanode exhibits a relatively lower photocurrent density of 1.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G irradiation. Notably, the CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits a dramatically enhanced photocurrent density of 4.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which originates from the successful construction of the Z-scheme heterojunction and surface modification by introducing the Bi–S bonds. However, the CIS–BWO photoanode without Bi–S bonds at the interface exhibits a relatively lower PEC performance compared with the CIS/BWO photoanode, which may come from the unfavorable photogenerated carrier transfer pathway. Accordingly, the construction of a CIS/BWO heterojunction with the interfacial Bi–S bond promotes the carrier separation of photoanodes, which further enhances the PEC performance of photoanodes. The PEC performances of In-based metal sulfide photoanodes from previously reported works are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†) to give a comprehensive comparative PEC performance. The as-prepared CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits a comparable and even higher PEC performance compared with the state-of-the-art photoanodes reported recently. It should be noted that in this work, the samples were tested in neutral solutions without using hole scavengers. A few photoanodes that exhibited higher photocurrent density than ours were measured with the presence of hole scavengers. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) in Fig. 4b was calculated using the following equation:39,40 ABPE = Jph (1.23 − V)/Ptotal(2)where Jph represents the net photocurrent density calculated by the current density measured under AM 1.5G illumination minus the current density measured in the dark, V is the applied bias, and Ptotal is the incident light power density (100 mW cm−2). After introducing Bi–S bonds, the resultant CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits the highest ABPE value of 0.94% at 0.86 VRHE among the bare CIS (0.17% at 0.92 VRHE) and CIS–BWO (0.28% at 0.88 VRHE) photoanodes.

In order to further investigate the carrier dynamics of CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO photoanodes, the carrier separation efficiency (ηsep) is calculated. ηsep reflects the photogenerated electron–hole recombination in the bulk of photoanodes and is calculated using the following equation:41 ηsep = Jsulfit/Jabs(3)where Jsulfit is the net photocurrent density of photoanodes measured in a hole scavenger (0.5 M Na2SO3/NaH2PO4, pH = 7.5, Fig. S6†) and Jabs is the theoretical photocurrent density calculated from the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 2e and the AM 1.5G standard solar spectrum. As shown in Fig. 4c, the bare CIS photoanode exhibits a relatively low ηsep of 35.65% at 1.23 VRHE, which is due to severe carrier recombination in the bulk of CIS. The CIS/BWO photoanode with interfacial Bi–S bonds exhibits a significantly enhanced ηsep of 88.57% at 1.23 VRHE due to the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction, which separates the photogenerated electron–hole pairs efficiently. Nevertheless, the CIS–BWO photoanode without the interfacial Bi–S bond does not show distinctly enhanced ηsep compared with the bare CIS photoanode. This is because Jsulfit is the net photocurrent density of photoanodes measured in the hole scavenger, and the CIS–BWO photoanode exhibits an inverse carrier transfer pathway that is unfavorable for hole extraction. The surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra in Fig. 4d were measured to probe the intrinsic photoelectric properties of CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO films.15,42 The CIS/BWO photoanode exhibits an obvious SPV signal under light irradiation, indicating that photogenerated electrons migrate to the FTO substrate and the photogenerated carrier separation is effective. Meanwhile, the CIS–BWO photoanode exhibits a relatively weak SPV signal compared with the CIS/BWO photoanode due to the type II band alignment, which allows electrons to migrate to the photoanode surface, while the photogenerated holes are rarely detected on the surface. These phenomena further confirm that the introduction of Bi–S bonds powerfully promotes the charge carrier separation of the CIS/BWO photoanode. The time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra in Fig. S7† were measured to further explore the charge-carrier dynamics. The TRPL curves were fitted to a biexponential decay model, according to the following equation: ΔAdecay = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + ΔA0(4)where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of the fast and slow decay processes. The fitted data of the intensity-average carrier lifetime are calculated according to the following equation: τ=(A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(5)
The specific fitting data are presented in Table S3 (ESI†). According to the fitting data in Table S3 (ESI†), the bare CIS photoanode presents a quick recombination with a carrier lifetime of 1.33 ns, suggesting a relatively poor charge-transfer capability. However, the carrier lifetime for the CIS/BWO photoanode is prolonged to 3.06 ns, indicating the decreased charge recombination and the enhanced charge transfer.
M–S plots were used to measure the electronic properties of CIS, CIS/BWO, and CIS–BWO photoanodes in the dark.43 The positive slope of samples in Fig. 4e suggests the n-type properties of samples, which benefits the construction of photoanodes for PEC water oxidation. The carrier concentration is inversely proportional to the slope of the M–S plot. The CIS photoanode exhibits a relatively positive slope corresponding to a low carrier density. After introducing BWO with interfacial Bi–S bonds, the CIS/BWO photoanode shows a remarkably increased carrier density, which corresponds to a smaller slope in M–S plots. This is due to the introduction of the Bi–S bond that forms a Z-scheme heterojunction, which promotes the inner carrier separation of the photoanode. However, the CIS–BWO photoanode, without Bi–S bonds at the interface, shows a more positive slope than the bare CIS photoanode, indicating lower carrier density and the absence of Bi–S bonds counts against the carrier dynamics of photoanodes. In addition, the specific carrier densities can be calculated from the following equation: (6)where C is the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor, Nd is the electron carrier density, e is the elemental charge value, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, ε is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor, Es is the applied potential, Efb is the flat band potential, T is the temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant.
The carrier density Nd can also be determined using the following equation: (7)where e = 1.6 × 10−19C, ε0 = 8.86 × 10−12 F m−1, and ε = 6.6. The calculated carrier densities of CIS, CIS/BWO and CIS–BWO are 6.79 × 1014, 3.31 × 1015, and 1.57 × 1014 cm−3, respectively. The carrier density of CIS/BWO is about five times higher than that of CIS. The M–S plots measured at different frequencies (3, 5, 7, and 9 kHz) are also presented in Fig. S8,† and the flat band potential can be obtained by extrapolating the x intercept of the linear region.43
The EIS plots in Fig. S9† were measured to clarify the interfacial charge transfer dynamics of CIS and CIS/BWO photoanodes under light irradiation.44 The arc radius of the Nyquist plots represents the charge carrier transfer impedance at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces. The larger the arc radius, the larger the carrier transfer impedance. The bare CIS photoanode shows a larger arc radius, indicating the sluggish surface carrier transfer dynamics of the bare CIS photoanode. The arc radius of CIS/BWO photoanode is smaller due to the surface exposure of Bi–S bonds, which benefits the surface carrier injection for water oxidation. The specific fitting data of the series resistance (Rs) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is an important parameter to evaluate the surface water oxidation kinetics of photoanodes.45 The ECSA is proportional to the slope of the double layer capacitance (Cdl) in Fig. 4f, which is calculated from the cyclic voltammogram curves in Fig. S10† in the non-faradaic region (0.19–0.29 VRHE) with different scan rates (0.01–0.15 V s−1). The larger slope in Fig. 4f implies more surface water oxidation sites. The bare CIS photoanode exhibits a relatively smaller slope, suggesting that the surface water oxidation kinetics is relatively sluggish. After surface coating BWO with interfacial Bi–S bonds, the CIS/BWO photoanode shows more surface-active sites, which is ascribed to the surface exposure of Bi–S bonds. The existence of surface Bi–S bonds benefits the surface carrier injection for water oxidation. The CIS–BWO photoanode displays a smaller Cdl slope than the CIS photoanode, indicating that the surface water oxidation dynamics of CIS–BWO is poor. This is due to the fact that it is difficult for the fully covered film to expose the Bi–S bond on the surface of the CIS–BWO photoanode. According to the above discussions, the surface-exposed Bi–S bond efficiently promotes the surface water oxidation of photoanodes.
First-principles calculations based on DFT were carried out to further understand the interfacial charge transfer mechanism of the CIS/BWO photoanode.21 The CIS/BWO heterojunction model was simulated based on the CIS (100) slab and the BWO (001) slab, and the heterojunction molecular structure model is presented in Fig. 5a. The electron localization function is computed to reveal the bonding interaction of Bi–S bonds and the regions are defined from 0 to 1. The regions close to 1 have strong covalent bonding electrons or lone pair electrons and the regions close to 0 have very low electron density. As shown in Fig. 5b, the large regions between the Bi and S atoms of CIS/BWO suggest the existence of strong interfacial Bi–S covalent bonds (length 2.79 Å) between the Bi atoms of the BWO (001) facet and the S atoms of the CIS (100) facet. The interfacial chemical bonds can act as atomic-scale charge-flow highways, which could facilitate the speeding up and broadening of the charge flow between components. More importantly, a charge density difference image is presented in Fig. 5c to demonstrate the charge distribution. The yellow and cyan regions represent the electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. Obviously, the electrons tend to accumulate on the CIS side and deplete on the BWO side, suggesting that the electrons flow from BWO to CIS. The band alignment and free electron transfer of a heterojunction can be revealed by calculating the work function of components, which is calculated based on the electrostatic potential across the heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 5d and e, the work function of the CIS (100) surface is calculated to be 4.88 eV, apparently smaller than that of the BWO (001) surface (5.64 eV). Therefore, when the CIS (100) facet and the BWO (001) facet are in contact, they form a compact interface. The free electrons in the BWO (001) surface with a high EF (5.64 eV) will diffuse to the CIS (100) surface with a low EF (4.88 eV) spontaneously to achieve an equilibrium of EF through the interfacial Bi–S bond. The free electron drifting enables charge redistribution at the interface of the CIS/BWO heterojunction, which in turn results in an internal electric field pointing from BWO to CIS. Under the assistance of an internal electric field, the photo-generated carrier achieves rapid separation and directed migration. Thus, the Bi–S bond could not only act as the atomic-level charge transfer channel but could also change the migration pathway and distance within the heterojunction. Based on the above discussions, a Z-scheme heterojunction charge transfer mechanism is presented in Fig. 5f. When CIS with a high EF is in contact with BWO with a low EFvia the interfacial Bi–S bond, the free electrons will transfer from CIS to BWO to achieve EF balance. Then, an electron-depleted layer in CIS and an accumulation layer in BWO are formed. Thus, an internal electric field is formed, which points from CIS to BWO. Meanwhile, the band edge of CIS bends upward and the band edge of BWO bends downward. Under the control of the internal electric field and band edge bending, the photo-generated electrons from the CB of BWO recombine with the photo-generated holes from the VB of CIS. Finally, the Z-scheme CIS/BWO heterojunction is formed, which separates the photo-generated carriers spatially and retains the redox potential, thereby promoting the PEC performance of photoanodes.

Conclusions
In summary, we utilize a facile high-temperature solvothermal method to introduce interfacial Bi–S chemical bonds into a CIS/BWO heterojunction. After introducing the Bi–S bonds, the composite photoanode shows an inverted carrier transfer direction and the band structure exhibits Z-scheme alignment. The formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction promotes the charge carrier separation and preserves the water redox potential of materials at the same time. Theoretical calculations confirm that the Bi–S bonds act as atomic-scale charge-flow highways, which help in the carrier transfer between components. As a result, the composite photoanode exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density of 4.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with a low onset potential of 0.30 VRHE. This significant improvement in the PEC performance mainly comes from the Z-scheme band alignment for photogenerated carrier separation and the surface exposure of Bi–S bonds for charge carrier injection. This strategy demonstrates the possibility of achieving comprehensive improvement via facile introduction of interfacial chemical bonds into heterojunctions.
