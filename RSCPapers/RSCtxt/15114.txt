    , Accepted 27th June 2020First published on 9th July 2020AbstractNew exploration in nanomaterial research has been greatly encouraged so as to discover active electrode materials with extraordinary properties and performances. In this report, we demonstrated the synthesis of different transition metal-incorporated MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn) and studied them using various characterization techniques. Subsequently, the proposed bimetallic chalcogenides were successfully applied as the active electrode materials for pseudocapacitor applications. The results of the electrochemical studies showed that CoWSe2 exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 3309.58 F g−1 at a constant applied current density of 1.35 A g−1, which is 1.07, 1.76, 2.04, 8.7, and 12.28-fold higher than that of NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2, respectively. The interconnected nanosheet structure with voids facilitates rich active sites for efficient electrolyte uptake and superior charge transfer during the faradaic redox reaction. In addition, the cycle stability of CoWSe2/NF was studied and the retention capacitance of about 82.1% was recorded, which is higher than that of NiWSe2 (60.4%), CuWSe2 (50.12%), ZnWSe2 (46.44%), MnWSe2 (40.12%), and pristine WSe2 (31.2%). Owing to the higher specific capacitance and cycle stability, CoWSe2 was proposed as a battery-type electrode material for the fabrication of an asymmetric device. The fabricated CoWSe2//AC device provided excellent energy density and power density of 182.54 W h kg−1 and 2810.81 W kg−1, respectively, at 3.51 A g−1. Based on these properties, the proposed research and studies can provide a way for the profound development of 2D-layered metal chalcogenides for energy storage applications.
1. Introduction
Recent research has concentrated on the exploration of new types of methods for supplying energy and satisfying the demands of the world's population. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has predicted that energy usage might increase by nearly 50% in 2050, especially in Asian countries. In the energy cycle, energy resources and technologies for energy conversion/storage play a crucial role.1,2 For decades, fossil fuels have been listed as the world's important energy resources. The energy consumption report of EIA-2019 mentioned that fossil fuels are the foremost energy source, contributing to about 35% of the total energy generation in the U.S. However, the concerns associated with fossil fuels, including their depletion and emission of CO2, are the major reasons for the exploration and use of alternative clean and sustainable energy sources.3,4 With the extensive development of renewable energy sources and zero pollution effects, solar and wind energy technologies have been considered as favourable and alternative options. However, the energy from these intermittent resources must be stored and integrated into the power grid for efficient energy distribution.5 Owing to the elevated power density, superior charge–discharge, storage capacity, and long cycle stability, electrochemical supercapacitors have been focused on widespread applications.6 Supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries have similar components including positive/negative electrodes and separators in the electrolyte. Besides, in terms of development, supercapacitors are considered to be between rechargeable batteries and conventional capacitors with higher power density and energy density, respectively.7,8 Globally, the supercapacitor market was valued at 685 million USD at the end of 2018; it can be expected to be at 2187 million USD after 6 years. Thus, many types of research have been executed for enhancing the performance of supercapacitors so as to replace or use them along with rechargeable batteries.9 According to this perspective, many new types of electrode-active materials with proficient physical and electrochemical properties have been innovated. The major interdisciplinary attention in new research is the synthesis and development of 2D-layered metal chalcogenides because of their tunable physical and electrochemical properties as well as the graphene family of nanomaterials. The layered metal chalcogenides, especially MX2 (M = Mo and W), are considered as ideal electrode materials and are quite suitable to explore the exciting electrochemical performances for supercapacitors owing to their layered crystal nature, tunable bandgap, superior charge transfer mobility, higher stability, high electron density in the d subshell, and their contribution to the high electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity.10,11 For example, M. Pumera et al. synthesized MX2 (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se) and studied the effect of the exfoliation technique on their capacitance, wherein the W-based chalcogenides showed better capacitance than that of Mo-based chalcogenides.12 Also, M. Habib et al. demonstrated the synthesis of WX2 (X = S and Se) and achieved a higher specific capacitance for the WSe2-based electrode with higher cycle stability and 99% capacitance retention owing to the higher metallic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of Se than that of S.13 Although WSe2 exhibits an indistinguishable layered atomic structure and intrinsic electronic properties as good as those of MoSe2, only a few research studies have been reported on WSe2-based energy storage devices. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a suitable method to improve the performance of WSe2 and to develop its application towards energy storage devices. Recently, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of metal chalcogenides have been adjusted and optimized using various engineering methods including heterogeneous metal doping, integration of carbon allotropes, and modification/preparation of mono-metal chalcogenides into bimetallic chalcogenides.14–16 Among these, the preparation of bimetallic chalcogenides is considered as a simple and effective way to improve the electrochemical characteristics of mono-metal chalcogenides, wherein the integrated heterogeneous transition metals combine their individual intrinsic properties together with mono-metal chalcogenides. It facilitates additional redox behavior and enhances the charge transfer conductivity. For example, S. J. Kim et al. reported a supercapacitor based on copper-tungsten sulfide and achieved a high specific capacitance of about 2666.6 F g−1 at 10 mA with high energy/power density.17 W. An et al. prepared nickel-cobalt selenide and compared its performance with mono-metal cobalt selenide, wherein the bimetallic nickel-cobalt selenide showed higher specific capacitance and lower charge transfer resistance than that of the mono-metal cobalt selenide.18 Besides, our previous research works have strongly demonstrated the better performance of Ni and Co-doped MoSe2 towards supercapacitor, biofuel cell, and electrochemical sensor applications and their improvement compared to that of pristine MoSe2.19,20 Thus, the synthesis of bimetallic WSe2 can be an interesting research topic for the development of layered materials in energy storage applications. Inspired by the above-mentioned reports, we synthesized various transition metal-incorporated (Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn) WSe2 (CoWSe2, NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, and MnWSe2) and studied their electrochemical properties towards the realization of an electrochemical supercapacitor. In this work, the proposed bimetallic chalcogenides were directly coated on nickel foam (NF) by following the hydrothermal method. The direct growth of active materials on NF offers several benefits such as the direct/effective binding of active material with NF and prevented the detrimental effect of the polymer binder. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of NF facilitates a large number of active sites to the electrolyte for creating abundant interfaces for electrochemical reaction. The results of the electrochemical studies showed that CoWSe2/NF exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 3309.58 F g−1 at a constant applied current density of 1.35 A g−1, which is comparatively higher than that of NiWSe2 (1598.52 F g−1), CuWSe2 (1196.56 F g−1), ZnWSe2 (1085.99 F g−1), MnWSe2 (339.80 F g−1), and pristine WSe2 (249.14 F g−1). In addition, the cycle stability of CoWSe2/NF was studied and the retention capacitance of about 82.1% was recorded, which is 0.35, 0.63, 0.76, 1.04, and 1.63-fold higher than that of NiWSe2 (60.4%), CuWSe2 (50.12%), ZnWSe2 (46.44%), MnWSe2 (40.12%), and pristine WSe2 (31.2%). The obtained higher specific capacitance of CoWSe2 can be related to various factors as follows: (i) the electrocatalytic promotional effect of Co is comparatively higher than other transition metals, as reported in the literature;21 (ii) the local bond order of Se in WSe2 can change due to the incorporation of Co, which introduces unsaturated Se edges22 and is favourable for higher intrinsic electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity; (iii) the Co atoms replace the W in WSe2 and introduce intermediate bands within the band gap, which contributes to higher conductivity;23,24 (iv) the unpaired electron with low spin state of Co supports its stronger binding with W and Se atoms; which promotes faster electron transfer;25 (v) also, Co shares its individual electronic conductivity and redox properties with WSe2.26 The obtained higher specific capacitance, lower charge transfer resistance, and larger cycle stability are the reasons for the development of the CoWSe2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor, which delivered superior energy density (182.54 W h kg−1) and power density (2810.81 W kg−1) at 3.51 A g−1. Thus, we determined that the incorporation of transition metals into pristine WSe2 provides a new idea and platform to achieve superior layered materials for the development of next-level flexible supercapacitor technology.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
Nickel foam (NF) with 75–98% porosity and ≥98% hole rate, which was used as the substrate, was purchased from Xiamen Technology, Fujian, China. Sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥98.5%), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥98%), copper nitrate hexahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), manganese nitrate hexahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥98%), selenium powder (Se, 99.99%), urea (NH2CONH2, ≥98%), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, C5H9NO, 99.5%), poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (PVDF, (CH2CF2)n, M.W. ∼530000), diazane (NH2NH2·H2O, 78–82%), activated carbon (AC, large surface area of ∼1000 m2 g−1), acetylene black (>99.95%, particle size of 45 ± 5 μm, pore volume of 0.5 cm2 g−1, average pore diameter of 100 Å ± 10 Å), poly(ethanol) (PVA, [–CH2CHOH–]n, M.W. 89000–98000), ethyl hydroxide (EtOH, 99.5%), and pottasium hydrate (KOH, ≥85%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn)
The proposed bimetallic metal chalcogenides were prepared by using a two-step hydrothermal synthetic method. In this method, MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn) were directly coated on the NF substrate. Before the hydrothermal reaction, NF was washed gently with 1 M HCl by using the ultrasonication process. For CoWSe2/NF, 0.01 mol of Na2WO4·2H2O and 0.01 mol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were mixed into 80 mL of H2O/EtOH (1:1 vol ratio) under magnetic stirring for 20 min. Consequently, 0.1 mol of NH2CONH2 was mixed into the above solution and continuously stirred for 30 min. The final mixture solution was poured into a 100 mL autoclave and the washed NFs were kept into the solution. Then, the hydrothermal reaction was carried out at a temperature of 180 °C for 6 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the autoclave was cooled down, and the NFs were washed using H2O/EtOH (1:1 vol ratio) and kept in an oven at 110 °C for 5 h. For the selenization process, the obtained NFs were again mixed into 50 mL of Se (0.02 mol) containing the NH2NH2/EtOH (1:1 vol ratio) solution and the hydrothermal reaction was performed at 140 °C for 12 h. At the end of the reaction, the obtained CoWSe2-coated NFs were washed using H2O/EtOH and kept at 110 °C for 6 h. NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2-coated NFs were obtained by following the similar experimental conditions mentioned above. The hydrothermal reaction followed herein is schematically demonstrated in Scheme 1.

2.3 Characterization techniques
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM230, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 2100F) were performed to analyze the morphology and structural information of MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) and pristine WSe2. X-ray diffraction (XRD, XPERT-3 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (K = 1.54 Å)) was carried out to understand the crystalline nature and the formation of the prepared samples. The electronic state of the elements in the prepared samples was estimated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Theta Probe, East Grinstead, UK) analysis. The surface area and pore size distribution of the prepared samples were estimated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micro metrics ASAP 2020 M instrument, USA) analysis. The electrochemical properties of the prepared MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) and pristine WSe2-coated NF were studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) technique (CHI440 electrochemical analyzer). The interfacial charge transfer resistance between the electroactive material and the electrolyte was analyzed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, IM6ex ZAHNER impedance measurement unit).
2.4 Electrochemical measurements

2.4.1 Fabrication of three- and two-electrode cells. 
The electrochemical properties of bimetallic MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) were studied and compared with those of pristine WSe2 using various electrochemical analyses including CV, GCD, and EIS. For these electrochemical studies, the proposed bimetallic chalcogenides and pristine WSe2-coated NFs were used as the working electrodes; meanwhile, Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH), Pt wire, and aqueous 1.0 M KOH were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode, and electrolyte, respectively. In the CV experiment, the set of working potential was fixed from −0.4 to 0.6 V at varying scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s−1. On the other hand, the GCD experiment was carried out in a potential window from 0 to 0.55 V at various current densities of 1.35, 1.89, 2.43, 2.97, 3.51, and 4.05 A g−1. The EIS study was performed in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with a fixed potential of 10 mV. The quantitative result of Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface was obtained from the resultant Nyquist plot. For the two-electrode asymmetric cells, CoWSe2 and AC electrodes were used as the anodic and cathodic electrodes, respectively. In beginning, the AC electrode was fabricated by preparing a homogeneous slurry containing AC (80 wt%), carbon black (15 wt%), PVDF (5 wt%), and NMP (0.4 mL). Then, the prepared slurry was gently coated on the NF (1 × 1 cm2) and kept overnight in a vacuum oven at 100 °C. Before the fabrication, the PVA/1.0 M KOH gel electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 1.0 g of PVA in 50 mL of water under constant magnetic stirring at 100 °C for 6 h. After stirring, 1.0 M KOH (10 mL) was slowly added into the above polymer solution and the stirring process was continued until the mixture turned into a gel-like substance. After the reaction, the obtained colloidal PVA gel was applied in between the anodic and cathodic electrodes and sandwiched together. Then, the sandwiched two-electrode cell was directly used for the electrochemical studies.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Material characterization of MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn)
The morphology and hierarchical nanostructure of the prepared MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) was well characterized by using SEM and TEM analyses. Fig. 1(A–C) show the vertically interconnected nanosheet structure of CoWSe2, which is densely and uniformly distributed on the NF surface. The interconnected structure formed the interspace voids, which was more favorable for the formation of the abundant active surface for electrolyte uptake and mass ion transfer during the electrochemical reaction. Further, the detailed structure of the CoWSe2 nanosheets was observed using the TEM study. In Fig. 1(D and E), the TEM images of CoWSe2 show the interconnected nanosheets, as reported in the FESEM analysis. Besides, Fig. 1E (inset) and Fig. 1F confirm that the nanosheets were formed by the stacking of thinner layered nanosheets with a corresponding interlayer spacing of 0.64 nm. Fig. 2(A–C) confirm the flower-like structure with interconnected nanoplates of NiWSe2 in the radiating alignment from the center.

 Fig. 2  (A–D) Different magnified FESEM and (E–H) TEM images of the NiWSe2 nanoplates. 
Interestingly, Fig. 2D shows quite a uniform size and thickness of the NiWSe2 nanoplates. It can be seen that the NiWSe2 nanoplates are thin with uniform thickness and rough surface, and also that the nanoplates consist of distinct corners and edges (Fig. 2(E–G) and Fig. 2G (inset)). The high-resolution image of the NiWSe2 nanoplates (Fig. 2H) shows the lattice distortion and defects, which implies the successful integration of the Ni heterogeneous spin state into the layered structure of WSe2. As observed in the FESEM images (Fig. 3(A–C)), CuWSe2 shows a densely-packed curly nanosheet structure, which formed a porous and honeycomb surface on the NF. The vertically arranged curly nanosheets (Fig. 3(D–F)) possess a higher surface area and rich active edge sites for larger electrolyte uptakes, which lead to efficient electrochemical reaction.

The different magnified FESEM images of ZnWSe2 are shown in Fig. 4(A–C); it can be observed that ZnWSe2 possesses a bundle of nanosheets.

Similarly, the TEM images (Fig. 4(D–F)) also clearly confirmed the bulk form of the ZnWSe2 nanosheets. In the bundle-like structures, the outer layer of the sheets are interconnected to each other and form the interspace voids. From the FESEM (Fig. 5(A–C)) and TEM (Fig. 5(D–G)) images, it can be observed that MnWSe2 shows a particle-like structure formed by self-integrated nanosheets, which was confirmed by the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 5H).

Herein, the lattice fringes can be seen with more distortion and defects due to the integration of Mn into the atomic lattice of WSe2. For the comparison studies, WSe2 was prepared and the FESEM and TEM analysis were carried out, as shown in Fig. S1.† The different magnified FESEM images (Fig. S1(A–C))† show a nanocoin-like structure of WSe2, which can also be confirmed from the TEM images (Fig. S1(D–E))† that show the well-defined corners and edges. In addition, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. S1F†) shows the lattice fringes of WSe2 with a hexagonal atomic lattice arrangement, which indicates that WSe2 was successfully prepared by using the proposed synthetic method.
The HRTEM images (Fig. S2†) show interlayer spacing with the corresponding lattice planes, whereas the dotted circles confirm the atomic distortion and defects due to the incorporation of transition metals into the atomic lattice of WSe2. The corresponding SAED patterns (Fig. S3†) with appropriate lattice index further confirmed the hexagonal symmetric atomic arrangement of the prepared samples. The spot in the hexagonal symmetry elongated, which suggests the resultant atomic distortion. In order to further exploit the morphological changes for different metal precursors, previous reports have been referred to. X. Chang et al. reported the transition metal (Co, Zn, and Fe)-doped tungsten oxide and recorded the effect of different metal precursors on the morphology.27 As a result, Co, Zn, and Fe-doped tungsten oxides exhibited ultrathin nanowire, nanorod, and nano flower structure, respectively. Thus, the doping of Co and Zn ions may prohibit the oriented growth of the tungsten oxide nanowires and favor their self-assembly, leading to the formation of bundled nanoblocks and nanorods. The Fe-doped tungsten oxide nanoflowers may result from the ordered arrangement of single nanoplates. The inclusion of different metals not only induces morphological changes but also alter the band gaps of the samples. As discussed above, the inclusion of metal ions has obvious effects on the morphology and crystalline structure of the final products.28,29 Similarly, various transition metal doped WSe2 have been synthesized and their different morphologies have been reported. The elemental distribution were studied by using EDX analysis to confirm the stoichiometric ratio of the elements in each samples. The obtained results are given in Fig. S4.† Each spectrum of the samples shows sharp peaks for the corresponding elements (Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mn, W, and Se) and also the recored quantitative weight% and atomic%, which confirmed the stoichiometric ratio of each sample.
The recorded morphologies of all the prepared materials are schematically represented in Scheme S1.† The formation and crystalline properties of bimetallic MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) and pristine WSe2 were analyzed by using XRD. The corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 6A, whereas pristine WSe2 exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks at 13.71°, 27.38°, 30.55°, 31.50°, 34.54°, 36.71°, 41.36°, 51.97°, 54.07°, 60.03°, 68.64°, and 71.86° for the corresponding lattice planes of (002), (004), (100), (101), (102), (103), (006), (106), (110), (201), (203), and (109), respectively. The obtained diffraction planes matched exactly with the hexagonal phase of WSe2 (JCPDS No. 6-80). For the CoWSe2 sample, additional peaks at 30.40°, 35.44°, 37.27°, 47.88°, 55.83°, 58.16°, and 63.93° corresponding to hkl = (110), (111), (012), (121), (211), (210), and (220), respectively, were assigned to the cubic crystal phase of cobalt-based selenide (JCPDS No: 10-409), which clearly confirmed the mixed phase of CoWSe2 and the successful incorporation of Co into WSe2. CoWSe2 exhibited a nanosheet structure with stacking of the layers, as shown in the FESEM and TEM images (Fig. 1). Based on the previously reported literature, both the layered and transition metal-incorporated MX2 (M = W, Mo and X = S, Se2) showed the XRD peaks with weaker intensity at lower angles.30–35 In the case of NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, and MnWSe2, additional diffraction peaks were observed for nickel selenide (2θ = 30.71°, 33.73°, 35.64, 40.73°, 42.95°, 50.90°, 53.60°, 55.83°, 58.05°, and 63.88°; hkl = (200), (210), (211), (220), (221), (311), (222), (230), (320), and (400); JCPDS No: 8-423), copper selenide (2θ = 18.95°, 23.25°, 24.19°, 27.23°, 31.35°, 35.95°, 36.59°, 38.66°, 41.36°, 45.02°, 46.29°, and 54.55°; hkl = (001), (101), (200), (111), (210), (201), (211), (220), (002), (310), (221), and (212); JCPDS No: 18-453), zinc selenide (2θ = 25.62°, 26.42°, 37.07°, 44.38°, 48.67°, 50.90°, 51.53°, and 57.91°; hkl = (100), (002), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), and (201); JCPDS No: 89-2940), and manganese selenide (2θ = 24.80°, 27.34°, 30.88°, 34.05°, 46.92°, 50.26°, 50.74°, and 52.48°; hkl = (111), (200), (210), (211), (311), (222), (023), and (321); JCPDS No: 89-3709). The above recorded XRD patterns for the mixed phase of metal selenides confirmed the formation of transition metal-incorporated WSe2. The stoichiometry and elemental states of the prepared bimetallic chalcogenides were estimated by using the XPS characterization technique. From the results of the XPS studies, it was observed that the wide scan survey spectra of MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) (Fig. 6B) consists of major characteristic peaks for O 1s (∼538.11 eV), C 1s (∼293.08 eV), Se 3d (∼55.59 eV), and W 4f (∼40.22 eV). Meanwhile, the peaks for Co 2p, Ni 2p, Cu 2p, Zn 2p, and Mn 2p can be observed at ∼790, ∼860, ∼940, ∼1020, and ∼642 eV, respectively. In all the wide scan survey spectra, it can be observed that all the prepared samples exhibit the characteristic peaks for W 4f and Se 3d, which preliminarily confirmed the formation of transition metal-incorporated WSe2 nanomaterials. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of W 4f shows characteristic peaks for the W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2, and W 5p3/2 electronic states at the corresponding binding energy of ∼36.82, ∼40.34, and ∼42.21 eV, respectively (Fig. 6D).36 In addition, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Se 3d shows a peak for the Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 states at the binding energy of ∼55.59 eV and 58.19 eV, respectively (Fig. 6E).37 For all the samples, the high-resolution spectra of both W 4f and Se 3d exhibit a peak shift, which can be related to a number of factors, including the chemical and physical (oxidation state) environment of the elements. The transition metals with higher electronegativity decrease the electron density around the base element; alternatively, they increase the binding energy. It is inversely proportional to the elements with lower electronegativity, whereas the electron density increases with decreasing binding energy. Fig. 6C shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p with peaks at ∼783.39 and ∼796.42 eV for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, whereas the binding energies of ∼790.11 and ∼805.87 eV are related to the two intense satellite peaks.38 Herein, the high resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p (Ni 2p3/2, sat. and Ni 2p1/2; ∼859.06, ∼864.87, and ∼ 876.34 eV),36 Cu 2p (Cu 2p3/2, sat. and Cu 2p1/2; ∼936.26, ∼944.76, and ∼956.23 eV),39 Zn 2p (Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2; ∼1025.55 and ∼1048.80 eV),40 and Mn 2p (Mn 2p3/2; 641.83 eV)41 exhibit major characteristic peaks for the corresponding electronic states at suitable binding energies. The above results confirmed that the prepared MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) consists of major elements such as W, Se, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn without additional impurities.

In general, the diffusion of electrolytic ions during the faradaic redox reaction depends upon the surface area of active electrode materials. Therefore, BET experiments were carried out for the prepared MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and Zn) and pristine WSe2 (Fig. 7A). It can be seen that CoWSe2 shows a specific surface (A) area of 31.56 m2 g−1 under the relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.318. In addition, the specific surface areas of NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2 were calculated to be 27.84, 24.45, 15.84, 17.08, and 4.29 m2 g−1, respectively. The obtained results are clearly demonstrated by using a bar diagram, as shown in Fig. 7B. Comparatively, CoWSe2 exhibits a higher specific surface area than other bimetallic chalcogenides and pristine WSe2, which can be attributed to the layered nanosheet structure with interconnected voids. Owing to the higher surface area, CoWSe2 can provide an abundant reactive surface for efficient ion diffusion process during the faradaic redox reaction.

3.2 Electrochemical properties of different working electrodes

3.2.1 Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies for three-electrode systems. 
The electrochemical properties of MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn), pristine WSe2/NF, and NF were studied and compared by using the CV technique, as shown in Fig. 8A, wherein the electrodes were employed at a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and a fixed potential window in the range from −0.4 to 0.6 V. The redox behavior of the proposed electrodes can be observed from the pair of anodic and cathodic peak current response at ∼0.5 and ∼0.2 V, respectively, which strongly suggests that the corresponding electrodes are favorable for the battery-type faradaic charge storage mechanism. Among them, CoWSe2 shows the largest redox current response (Ipa = 0.1154 A and Ipc = −0.09 A) with an integrated area of 0.0393 AV, which is comparatively 0.553, 1.311, 1.367, 2.63, 2.89, and 42.6-fold higher than that obtained for NiWSe2 (0.0253 AV), CuWSe2 (0.0170 AV), ZnWSe2 (0.0166 AV), MnWSe2 (0.0108 AV), WSe2 (0.0101 AV), and NF (0.0009 AV). The obtained redox current response and the integrated area of the CV curves suggest that CoWSe2/NF is relatively better than other modified electrodes and is able to produce a higher specific capacitance. In metal chalcogenides, the filling of the eg orbital by the 3d electron of Co induces higher density of states in the conduction band and improves both the intrinsic electronic conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity. Besides, the CD technique was carried out for MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn), WSe2, and NF electrodes to understand the charge–discharge behavior of the electrodes. At the beginning of the experiment, the optimized potential was confirmed by varying the potential window in the order of 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, and 0.6 V at 1.35 A g−1. The resultant GCD curves of CoWSe2/NF are shown in Fig. S5A;† the corresponding specific capacitance was measured and is demonstrated in the bar diagram (Fig. S5B†). It can be observed that CoWSe2/NF showed perfect non-symmetrical triangular GCD curves with gradually increasing specific capacitance in the potential window from 0.4 to 0.55 V. In contrast, the GCD curve changed into an imperfect non-symmetrical triangular shape with lower specific capacitance when the potential increased to 0.6 V. Therefore, the potential window of 0–0.55 V was confirmed as the optimum potential window for application in all CD electrochemical studies. Fig. 8B shows the GCD curves for MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn), pristine WSe2, and NF electrodes obtained at a fixed applied current density of 1.35 A g−1. Among these, CoWSe2 showed the largest non-linear GCD curve compared to NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, WSe2, and NF. The calculated specific capacitances of all the electrodes are demonstrated in the bar diagram (Fig. 8C); it can be observed that CoWSe2 exhibited a specific capacitance of 3309.58 F g−1 at a constant applied current density of 1.35 A g−1. The obtained specific capacitance of CoWSe2 is 1.07, 1.76, 2.04, 8.7, and 12.28-fold higher than that of NiWSe2 (1598.52 F g−1), CuWSe2 (1196.56 F g−1), ZnWSe2 (1085.99 F g−1), MnWSe2 (339.80 F g−1), and WSe2 (249.14 F g−1). The higher specific capacitance at CoWSe2 was ascribed to the battery type faradaic charge–discharge reaction at the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple and the active W atom. Also, the interconnected nanosheet structure with voids facilitates rich active sites for efficient electrolyte uptake and superior charge transfer during the charge–discharge redox reaction. For additional comparison studies, the CV and GCD experiments were performed for CoWSe2 (Co/W = 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:1, 4:1), CoSe2, and WSe2, and were compared as shown in Fig. S8(A and B).† It can be observed that Co/W (1:1) shows better redox response, larger integral area, and charge–discharge characteristics. It also confirmed that CoWSe2 is a suitable active material for further electrochemical studies. Herein, eqn (1) was used to calculate the specific capacitance (Csp) of the modified electrodes, which can be written as follows:38 Csp = (IΔt)/(mΔV)(1)where I represents the applied current density, Δt is the discharge time, the mass loading of the electrode material is represented as m, and ΔV is assigned to the potential window applied for the CD analysis. Finally, both the CV and CD results confirm the superior electrochemical property of CoWSe2 towards supercapacitor application. In addition, the faradaic charge storage property of MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn) and pristine WSe2 was evaluated based on important input parameters including applied scan rate and current. For this experiment, the scan rate was varied in the order of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s−1 for CoWSe2; the corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. 8D. It can be observed that the CV curve shows the linearly increasing redox peak current for varying scan rate. The corresponding calibration curve for the square root of scan rate vs. anodic peak current is shown in Fig. S6F,† with a calculated correlation coefficient (R2), which suggests that the charge transfer reaction at the surface of the proposed electrodes followed the diffusion-controlled process. In addition, the CV curves of CoWSe2 show a uniform shape at different scan rates owing to the superior chemical reversibility and mass charge transportability. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed electrode exhibited the battery-type faradaic redox reaction without any physical alteration of the electrode surface. As mentioned above, the scan rate experiment was followed for other modified electrodes including NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2, as shown in Fig. (S6(A–E)).† Similarly, the proposed electrodes NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2 also showed a faradaic redox performance as good as that of CoWSe2.

(D) CV curve of CoWSe2 at different scan rates. (E) CD curve profile of CoWSe2 at 1.35, 1.89, 2.43, 2.97, 3.51, and 4.05 A g−1. (F) Corresponding calibration plot for current density vs. specific capacitance using different electrodes. 
Furthermore, the charge–discharge behavior and specific capacitance of the CoWSe2 electrode were determined by using the CD technique, which was performed by varying the current density in the order of 1.35, 1.89, 2.43, 2.97, 3.51, and 4.05 A g−1 at the CoWSe2 electrode, whereas the optimized potential window was fixed (0–0.55 V). The corresponding GCD curves are shown in Fig. 8E, which exhibit non-symmetrical triangular charge–discharge curves due to the faradaic redox behavior of CoWSe2. From the GCD curves, the values of Csp were calculated to be 3309.58, 3254.05, 3128.99, 3004.86, 2930.91, and 2855.53 F g−1 at 1.35, 1.89, 2.43, 2.97, 3.51, and 4.05 A g−1, respectively. Similarly, the GCD curves of NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2 were recorded by varying the current density, as shown in Fig. S7(A–E).† To understand the capacitance variation at higher current density, the current density was further increased from 4.05 to 11.0 A g−1, as shown in Fig. S8C,† which reveals that the specific capacitance decreases with increasing current density, thus indicating less active material access and reduction in the effective utilization of the materials at a higher scan rate.
The corresponding value of Csp for all the proposed electrodes was calculated and compared in the linear calibration plot (Fig. 8F). It can be seen that CoWSe2 exhibited a higher Csp as compared to the other proposed electrodes. On the other hand, the value of Csp decreases gradually on increasing the current density, which is attributed to the inadequate participation of the electrode materials at higher current density. Based on the faradaic charge–discharge mechanism, the probable reaction mechanism at MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn) can be written as shown below: MWSe2 + 2OH− ↔ MSeOH + WSeOH + 2e−(2) WSeOH + OH− ↔ WSeO + H2O + e−(3) MSe + OH− ↔ MSeOH + e−(4)
According to the basic theory, the energy storage electrode materials follow two kinds of charge storage mechanisms, namely, capacitive and diffusion controlled faradaic reactions. To identify the exact reaction mechanism and its maximum contribution, the current value was measured from the CV curves at different scan rates (Fig. 8D) and applied in the following eqn (5):19 i = k1ν + k2ν1/2(5)where i is known as the current from the CV curve and ν refers to the scan rate, and k1 and k2 are constant that can be measured from the calibration plot of i/ν1/2vs. ν1/2. Fig. S9A† demonstrates the CV curve for the capacitive (shaded area) and diffusion (unshaded area) processes of the CoWSe2 electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Moreover, the capacitance ratio was calculated for different scan rates and is represented in the corresponding bar diagram (Fig. S9B†). It indicates that the proposed CoWSe2 exhibited a maximum ratio for the diffusion-controlled reaction.


3.2.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies for different electrodes. 
In all the followed electrochemical studies, the internal charge transfer resistance plays a major role in the efficient electrochemical reaction at the surface of the electrode. It can be quantitatively studied by using the EIS technique, which provides the quantitative value of charge transfer resistance (Rct). For this, the EIS studies were carried out for MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn), pristine WSe2, and NF with the following experimental conditions: fixed potential of 10 mV, a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, and 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte. Fig. 9(A and B) shows the resultant Nyquist plot of all the proposed electrodes with the corresponding Randle's circuit (Fig. 9A (inset)). The Randle's circuit demonstrates various important factors associated with the interfacial property, including solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), double layer capacitance (Cdl), and Warburg impedance. In addition, the high-frequency and low-frequency region in the Nyquist plot are related to the kinetics of electron transfer and mass transfer due to impedance, respectively. In general, the Rct value is directly proportional to the diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot. From this EIS result, CoWSe2 exhibited a very small semicircle region owing to the lower Rct of 10.83 Ω, which is comparatively lower than that of NiWSe2 (14.20 Ω), CuWSe2 (16.13 Ω), ZnWSe2 (20.11 Ω), MnWSe2 (57.043 Ω), pristine WSe2 (63.073 Ω), and NF (297.24 Ω) electrodes. The obtained results are demonstrated in the bar diagram (Fig. 9C). Finally, the lowest Rct of CoWSe2 reveals the lowest internal charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrode and the electrolyte, which is favorable for an efficient faradaic redox reaction.

3.2.3 Cycle stability of different electrodes. 
For energy storage applications, the stability of the active material is considered as a crucial property. It intensively affects the performance of the whole energy storage device. Thus, the CD experiment was performed by using the charge–discharge method to understand the stability of the proposed active electrode materials, wherein 5000 consecutive cycles were carried out at a constant current density of 8.10 A g−1. Fig. 9D shows the corresponding plot for capacitance retention vs. the number of cycles. It can be observed that CoWSe2 maintained a superior cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 82.10% up to 5000 cycles. At the same time, the capacitance retention was calculated to be 60.40%, 50.12%, 46.44%, 40.12%, and 31.20% for NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2, respectively (Fig. 9E). From this study, it can be concluded that CoWSe2 possesses long-term cycle stability compared to other modified electrodes. In addition, the capacitance retention and stability of CoWSe2 can be understood from the symmetric shape of the GCD curve before and after 5000 cycles (Fig. 9F). Similarly, the shape of the GCD curve before and after 5000 cycles was demonstrated for NiWSe2, CuWSe2, ZnWSe2, MnWSe2, and pristine WSe2 (Fig. S10(A–E)†). Herein, various reasons were proposed in the literature to explain the fluctuation during the cycling stability test, which are as follows: (i) structural break-down induced by the repeated charging and discharging of a large volume of ions;86 (ii) irreversible phase changes of the active material due to the incomplete desorption of the electrolyte cation;87 (iii) more and more sites become activated and contribute to the increasing fluctuation as the electrolyte gradually penetrates into the inner region of the electrodes;88 (iv) more electroactive surface area become available as the electrode is completely infiltrated and activated through the insertion and extraction of ions;89 [v] the slight decrease in the capacitance with increasing cycle number might be attributed to the corrosion of the electrode.90 Generally speaking, the edges are more reactive than the basal planes; however, for catalysts with metallic basal planes, the binding energies can be similar. Regardless, there are more edges that are simultaneously active and stable, whereas the most reactive basal planes also start to become unstable.91 Even though the cycle retention shows a fluctuation, it remained almost 82.10%, which matched well with the previously reported literature.92–97


3.2.4 Electrochemical performances of the CoWSe2//AC asymmetric device. 
Due to the higher specific capacitance and superior cycle stability, the CoWSe2 electrode was applied as an anode in the asymmetric supercapacitor device. In general, the asymmetric supercapacitor device shows higher capacity to store charge and a larger potential window (>1.2 V) due to dissimilar active materials in the anode and the cathode. In view of the above points, CoWSe2 and AC were used as the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively, whereas PVA/1.0 M KOH polymer gel was used as the electrolyte (represented as CoWSe2//AC). At the beginning of asymmetric device fabrication, the charge balancing process was performed by calculating the correct mass ratio on the anode and cathode electrodes. For this, the standard charge balance theory (q+ = q−) was followed to calculate the mass ratio. The charge storage on the anode and cathode depends on the number of factors including the potential window (ΔV), specific capacitance (Csp), and mass loading (m). It can be written as the eqn ((6) and (7)) shown below:23,38 q = ΔVCspm(6)

Eqn (6) can be rewritten as: (7)where Csp+ and Csp− refer to the specific capacitance of the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively, and ΔV− and ΔV+ represent the potential windows applied for the anode and cathode scanning, respectively. For this, the CV curves of CoWSe2 (−0.4 to 0.6 V) and AC (0.1 to −1.0 V) were recorded by using the three-electrode system, which are demonstrated in Fig. 10A. Based on the above charge balance theory, the mass ratio was calculated for CoWSe2 and AC to be 1:2.3. For the ideal performance of the asymmetric CoWSe2//AC, the optimal potential window was identified by using the CV technique. Fig. 10B shows the CV curves for different potential window in the order of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 V. From this result, it can be observed that the proposed CoWSe2//AC asymmetric device can work in an expanded potential window from 0.4 to 1.6 V. The expanded potential window confirmed the mutual influence of both pseudocapacitance and the EDLC behavior of CoWSe2 and AC. In addition, the scan rate experiment was performed by varying the different scan rate in the order of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 10C. As a result, the identical shape of the CV curves for different scan rates indicates the excellent rate performance and feasible reversibility of the proposed CoWSe2//AC asymmetric device. In addition, the CD experiment was performed for CoWSe2//AC by varying the potential window in the order of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 V (Fig. 10(D and E)). For different potential windows, it can be seen that the fabricated CoWSe2//AC exhibited non-symmetric charge–discharge curves with the combined effect of EDLC and pseudocapacitive behavior. Furthermore, the charge–discharge behavior of the CoWSe2//AC asymmetric device was studied by varying the different current density as 1.35, 1.89, 2.43, 2.97, and 3.51 A g−1 in the optimized potential window of 0–1.6 V, as shown in Fig. 10F. The corresponding value of Csp was calculated to be 852.19, 767.39, 740.22, 644.57, and 513.41 F g−1 at a current density of 1.35, 1.89, 2.43, 2.97, and 3.51 A g−1, respectively, which is represented in the calibration plot (Fig. 10G). Also, the bar diagram is shown in Fig. S11† for current density vs. coulombic efficiency, wherein it can be observed that the maximum coulombic efficiency (80.1%) was obtained at 2.97 A g−1. The obtained coulombic efficiency matched with that of the previously reported literature.98 By substituting the value of Csp in eqn (8) and (9), the energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated and are demonstrated in the Ragone plot, as shown in Fig. 10H. E = 1/2CV2(8) P = E/Δt(9)where V and Δt represent the potential range and discharge time, respectively.99 As a result, the maximum value of E and P were calculated to be about 182.54 W h k g−1 and 2810.81 W kg−1, respectively. The obtained E and P of the CoWSe2//AC asymmetric devices are compared with previously reported literature, as shown in Table 1. Finally, it can be observed that the asymmetric CoWSe2//AC device exhibited higher E and P as compared to other Co and W-based nanomaterials. Fig. 10I indicates the flexibility of the prepared asymmetric device, which exhibits an almost similar GCD curve even after bending. Thus, it is favorable for the new flexible supercapacitor technology. In addition, the fabricated asymmetric device is schematically represented in Scheme 2.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the MWSe2 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn)-coated NFs were successfully synthesized by using the hydrothermal method and applied as the battery-type electrode materials for supercapacitor studies. Among these bimetallic chalcogenides, the CoWSe2-coated NF exhibited superior Csp (3309.58 F g−1 at 1.35 A g−1), lower Rct (10.83 Ω), and better cycle stability (82.10% up to 5000 cycles) as compared to other proposed electrode materials. For further development, the asymmetric device containing CoWSe2 (positive electrode) and AC (negative electrode) also exhibited a feasible energy density (E) of 182.54 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 2810.81 W kg−1, which are comparatively higher than those reported in previously reported literature. The higher electrochemical performance of CoWSe2 can be related to the layered nanostructure with interconnected voids, which offers a higher surface area for both electrolyte uptake and ion diffusion during the charge–discharge faradaic redox reaction. In addition, the incorporated transition metals share their intrinsic electronic properties; thus, the proposed bimetallic chalcogenides can exhibit multiple electrochemical properties.
