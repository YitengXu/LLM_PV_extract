    , Accepted 23rd November 2018First published on 26th November 2018AbstractCu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) photovoltaic devices with Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors were prepared by co-electrodeposition. This is a low-cost, environmentally favorable and non-vacuum process with broad industrial prospects. However, due to the relatively narrow range of phase forming conditions and insufficient sulfurization, it is difficult to obtain fine control over the composition of CZTS films with pure phase structures and uniform grain size distributions. In this work, co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors were sulfurized in an atmosphere of sulfur (S) and nitrogen gas (N2). The S contents in the CZTS films were controlled by varying the N2 gas pressure. After optimization, we obtained a maximum efficiency of 8.7%, which is the highest reported for co-electrodeposited CZTS devices to date.
1. Introduction
Kesterite copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) is one of the most promising alternatives to CdTe and CIGS, for use as a sustainable absorber material in terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) devices. This is due to its earth-abundant and non-toxic constituents, copper, zinc, tin, and sulfur. CZTS has a large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) and a direct band gap of about 1.5 eV. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, CZTS devices have the potential to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 32%.1 To date, the highest PCEs attained for pure sulfide CZTS, pure selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and mixed Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) devices are 11.0%, 12.6%, and 11.6%, respectively.2–5 CZTS film is usually fabricated in two stages: (1) deposition of metallic precursors, followed by (2) post-sulfurization.6,7 The fabrication of Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors has been developed using different vacuum- and non-vacuum-based techniques such as magnetron sputtering,8,9 pulsed laser deposition,10,11 thermal evaporation,12,13 spray pyrolysis,14,15 electrodeposition,16,17 solvent-based processes,18,19 and sol–gel20,21 processes. Post-sulfurization is carried out in an atmosphere of S vapor and/or H2S gas, and the maximum sulfurization temperature varies from 500–600 °C. By systematically studying and optimizing sulfurization parameters such as the sulfur source, sulfurization pressure, temperature and time, Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors can be converted into a single-phase CZTS film.22–25
Among the various techniques of fabricating CZTS metallic precursors, electrodeposition is the most attractive due to its simplicity, low-cost, room-temperature growth, environmental friendliness, and non-vacuum process, which give it broad industrial prospects. More importantly, our previous research has shown that the composition of Cu, Zn, Sn and S metal precursor elements can be optimized by changing the prescription of the electrolyte in the co-electrodepositing process. This can significantly improve CZTS film quality and device performance, with the highest PCE yet achieved being 7.1%.26–29 Post-sulfurization can be done in an S + N2 gas atmosphere or an H2S atmosphere. The former is a simple, non-toxic process.30 The S vapor partial pressure can be controlled by varying the amount of S powder and the sulfurization temperature. The total process pressure can be controlled by the variation of N2 partial pressure. The key to the process is the effective control of the penetration, diffusion and reaction of S with the precursors used in the sulfurization process. Because of the relatively narrow range of phase forming conditions, it is difficult to obtain a high-quality CZTS film when the S content in the film/precursor is far from stoichiometric. When the S content is lower than the stoichiometry of the CZTS film, the sulfurization reaction is insufficient. The grain size exhibits a bi-layered morphology with large grains located on the top of the film and dense small grains near the bottom of the film.12 When the S content is higher than the stoichiometry of CZTS film, secondary phase Cu2−xS is formed by the reaction of S and Cu. If excessive S content is caused by a high sulfurization temperature, the pyrolysis of CZTS and the loss of volatile SnS and ZnS phases will occur. Therefore, the process of post-sulfurization is crucial and has been widely investigated.
In this research, CZTS film was prepared by co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors and sulfurized in an S + N2 gas atmosphere. In the post-sulfurization process, the sulfurization pressure was optimized from 10–60 Torr. Both the CZTS film properties and device performance were studied. Furthermore, we prepared a CZTS PV device with a PCE of 8.7% at a sulfurization pressure of 40 Torr, which was the best performing CZTS device with an absorber fabricated by co-electrodeposition.
2. Experimental
The Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors were co-electrodeposited on Mo-coated glass substrates by direct current mode in a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument, USA) equipped with a conventional three-electrode system (an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, an inert Pt anode, and a Mo working electrode). The direct current mode was completed at a constant potential of 1.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 20 min. All raw chemicals were analytical reagent grade (supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China). The prescription of the electrolyte was prepared using non-toxic aqueous solutions and contained 20 mmol L−1 SnSO4·2H2O, 30 mmol L−1 ZnSO4·7H2O, 10 mmol L−1 CuSO4·5H2O, 100 mmol L−1 Na3C6H5O7, and 20 mmol L−1 C4H4O6K2·1/2H2O. The CZTS precursors were post-sulfurized in an S + N2 gas atmosphere using a rapid thermal process (RTP) furnace. The furnace had a tubular quartz chamber and was heated by external halogen lamps. The metal precursors were enclosed in a graphite crucible with a volume of approximately 75 cm3. The S source was 500 mg of S powder placed close to the samples. The graphite crucible was not vacuum-sealed and provided a sulfur vapor pressure of up to 0.95 Torr. For accurate temperature measurement, a thermocouple was installed close to the samples. The process gas was N2 and the pressures used were 10, 20, 40, and 60 Torr. The sulfurization process was carried out by heating the precursors at a rate of 60 °C min−1 up to a dwell temperature of 560 °C, holding that temperature for 20 min, and then allowing unassisted cooling in the furnace. The CZTS device was fabricated in an AZO/ZnO/CdS/CZTS/Mo/glass substrate configuration. After CZTS film sulfurization, an 80 nm-thick CdS buffer layer, a 50 nm-thick i-ZnO layer, and a 250 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer were deposited in sequence by RF magnetron sputtering. No metal grid or anti-reflection coating was deposited. Finally, the samples (2.5 × 2.5 cm2) were mechanically scribed into unitary cells with areas of 0.25 cm2.
The structure of the CZTS films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer), using a Cu-Kα source (λ = 1.5418 Å), in the 2θ range of 10–80°. Raman scattering was measured to study the surface phase structure using a Nanofinder 30 (TII Tokyo Instruments, Inc) at room temperature in a backscattering configuration. Two polarized beams of 532 nm and 325 nm, with a spot size of 3 μm and intensity of 2 W cm−2, were excited by solid-state lasers. The surface and cross-sectional morphology and chemical composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Siren 2001615, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) attached to an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). The performance of the devices was analyzed by light and dark current density–voltage (J–V) measurements using a standard solar simulator (Xe lamp, Newport) under AM1.5 G irradiation (100 W cm−2) and in the dark at 25 °C. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a spectral response measurement system (Crowntech, QTest Station 1000AD). A calibrated Si solar cell was used as a reference for the J(V) and EQE measurements.
3. Results and discussion
The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the CZTS films sulfurized at various process pressures were analyzed by SEM (Fig. 1) and their chemical compositions were analyzed by EDS mapping (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). In order to simultaneously quantitative analysis the elements constituting the top and bottom parts of the CZTS films, two sampling points were selected (near the top and bottom of each CZTS film) in the cross-sectional SEM images of the four samples. All CZTS films exhibited well-faceted equiaxed grains, compact morphology and strong adhesion with no voids or crevices between the film and Mo substrate (Fig. 1a, c, e and g). When sulfurized at 10 Torr, the grain size of the CZTS film exhibited a bi-layered morphology: large grains were located at the top, while fine-grained nano-crystals existed next to the Mo substrate. As the sulfurization pressure increased from 10 to 60 Torr, the grain size of the top layer increased from several hundreds of nanometers to a few micrometers. After sulfurization at 60 Torr, the thickness of the bottom nano-crystal layer decreased to almost zero (Fig. 1b, d, f and h). The characteristics of large grain size and a uniform CZTS absorber means that few carriers were trapped in the grain boundary. This is conducive to the reduction of carrier recombination and the increase of carrier lifetime in the absorber, which can increase the Voc and FF of CZTS devices. The changes in CZTS film morphology may stem from increases in sulfurization pressure. At the initial stage of sulfurization, CZTS is synthesized rapidly in the top layer of the metal precursors and gradually grows at the bottom simultaneously. As the sulfurization pressure increases, the amount of S penetrating the top of the CZTS film increases. According to Fick's law, the amount of S diffused into the bottom of the CZTS film should also increase accordingly, which was confirmed through chemical composition analysis, as shown in ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2) and Table 1.

Table 1 shows that all of the CZTS films exhibited Cu-poor and Zn-rich compositions compared to the standard stoichiometry (i.e. Cu/Zn/Sn/S = 0.25/0.125/0.125/0.5), which is desirable for high-efficiency CZTS devices, as previously reported.3,12 This is because the shallow acceptors of Cu vacancies (VCu) can be enhanced in Cu-poor CZTS films, while the deep acceptors of Cu-occupied Zn sites (CuZn) can be suppressed in Zn-rich CZTS films.31,32 On the other hand, as the sulfurization pressure increased from 10 to 60 Torr, the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratios at the tops and bottoms of the CZTS films increased from 0.82 and 0.81 to 0.92 and 0.85, respectively. The contents of Zn and Sn decreased slightly. Of particular concern is that the decrease in Sn content was significantly greater than that of Zn content. The Zn/Sn ratios at the tops and bottoms of the CZTS films increased from 1.03 and 1.01 to 1.31 and 1.25, respectively. Furthermore, the higher the sulfurization pressure, the larger the Zn/Sn ratio at the top of the CZTS films compared to that at the bottom. As the sulfurization pressure increased, the content of S in the CZTS films increased. The ratios of S/metal at the tops of the CZTS films were all greater than those at the bottoms, which indicate that there was a diffusion gradient of S in the CZTS films. This means that the S at the top of the CZTS films was diffused into the bottom during the sulfurization process. When the sulfurization pressure was 40 Torr, S becomes slightly rich, with a ratio of S/metal greater than 1 at the top of the CZTS film. When the sulfurization pressure was 60 Torr, both of the ratios of S/metal at the tops and bottoms of the CZTS films were greater than 1, indicating that S had been fully incorporated into the CZTS film. These results suggest that sulfurization pressure can influence the chemical composition of CZTS films and the distribution of the elements Cu, Zn, Sn and S.
In the ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2), EDS mapping was used to characterize the distribution of different chemical compositions in the sulfurized CZTS film qualitatively. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the elements of Cu, Sn, Zn, and S were uniformly distributed on the surface of each CZTS film, respectively. Seen from Fig. S2 (ESI†), there were slight differences in the distribution of Cu, Sn, Zn, and S along the cross-section in the EDS mapping diagrams of each CTZS film, respectively, which was consistent with the analysis results of the elements distribution on the tops and bottoms of the CTZS films.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the tops and bottoms of the CZTS films sulfurized at various process pressures. In order to measure XRDs of the bottoms of the CZTS films, we evenly scraped the tops of CZTS films using a knife, and the thickness of the residual CZTS films were about 300 nm. The peaks at approximately 2θ = 18.21°, 28.53°, 32.98°, 37.02°, 47.33° and 56.18° reflect diffraction of the (101), (112), (200), (202), (220) and (312) planes of kesterite CZTS [JCPDS 26-0575], respectively, which indicate a polycrystalline nature with a kesterite structure. The strongly preferred orientation is along the (112) direction, and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (112) peak decreased with the increase of sulfurization pressure, as shown in the inset at the top right of Fig. 2. The results calculated by Debye–Scherrer formula show that the average grain size of CZTS films increased, indicating that the crystallinity of the CZTS film was improved as the sulfurization pressure increased from 10 to 60 Torr. The top and bottom of each CTZS film exhibited the similar XRD spectrum. The main difference was that FWHM of the bottom film was greater than that of the top film, which indicates that the grain size of the bottom films was smaller than that of the top film, which was consistent with the results of SEM analysis. The peak at 2θ = 14.35° reflects the (002) plane of MoS2 [JCPDS 37-1492]. The presence of a MoS2 layer at the CZTS/Mo interface is a current-blocking barrier, which can suppress majority carrier (hole) transport and increase the series resistance of the device. The peaks at 2θ = 40.51° and 73.68° reflect the (110) and (211) planes of the Mo substrates [JCPDS 42–1120], respectively.

Because there is an overlap between the XRD peaks of the kesterite CZTS and the binary and/or ternary impurity phases, e.g. ZnS [JCPDS 05-0566] and Cu2SnS3 [JCPDS 027-0198], the XRD test cannot sufficiently confirm the single phase of the CZTS film. Hence, Raman scattering was utilized to obtain further insight into the phase identification. Raman scattering at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm can deeply penetrate CZTS films and reflect their inner phase construction (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, an excitation wavelength of 325 nm is very close to the resonance condition of ZnS (∼3.7 eV), and its penetration distance is shallow; therefore, it can only determine ZnS phase construction at the top of the CZTS films (Fig. 3b).33,34
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of CZTS films produced at sulfurization pressures of 10, 20, 40 and 60 Torr, measured at excitation wavelengths of 532 nm (a) and 325 nm (b). 
As seen in Fig. 3a, the main peaks located at 287 and 337 cm−1 are attributed to the preferential A1 vibrational modes of CZTS. The other peaks, with relatively weak strengths at 248 and 369 cm−1, are identified as the B/E and B(LO) symmetry modes of CZTS. A second-order CZTS peak was also present at 669 cm−1, which is consistent with reported results.35 A tiny peak was observed at 160 cm−1 that was assigned to SnS secondary phases at the sulfurization pressure of 10 Torr, which came from the SnS vapor during the sulfurization process.36 Raman spectra also exhibited a peak of secondary phase Cu2S at 478 cm−1. It has been reported that the existence of Cu2−xS as a catalyst may facilitate the growth of large CZTS grains and promote the formation of high-quality CZTS films. The presence of a Cu2−xS liquid phase also contributed to the rapid diffusion of Zn and Sn at high temperature.37,38 On the other hand, the presence of SnS and Cu2S secondary phases can enhance carrier recombination due to the large lattice mismatches at the SnS/CZTS and Cu2S/CZTS hetero-interfaces, which may not only reduce the shunt resistance (Rsh) but also increase the carrier recombination of the CZTS absorber layer.39
As seen in Fig. 3b, peaks of secondary-phase ZnS are observed at 348 and 694 cm−1, and are assigned to the R1LO and R2LO vibrational modes of ZnS. The peak at 620 cm−1 of CZTS film sulfurized at 10 Torr is attributed to the 2TO vibrational mode of ZnS.40 This is because the formation enthalpy of ZnS is lower than that of other binary sulfides, the ZnS phase is easily formed during sulfurization.31 In addition, the Sn content at the top of the CZTS films is decreased due to the increase in volatile SnS losses with increasing process pressure. So, the ratio of Zn/Sn is increased slightly, and a more Zn-rich phase exists at the top of the CZTS films, which was confirmed by EDS analysis (Table 1).
CZTS devices with a co-electrodeposited and sulfurized absorber layer were fabricated and characterized. Current density–voltage (J–V) plots were derived under simulated AM1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and in the dark. Fig. 4 shows the measured short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution of twelve devices. For each sulfurization pressure, the performance of the three devices showed good homogeneity. One group of typical parameters of CZTS devices with sulfurization pressures of 10, 20, 40, and 60 Torr were summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 2. Plots of external quantum efficiency (EQE) were constructed for the wavelength range 300–950 nm. The Jsc values obtained by integrating EQE curves are consistent with the corresponding Jsc values from the J–V tests.

Fig. 5a shows that the J–V curves of the CZTS devices with absorber layers sulfurized at 10, 20, 40, and 60 Torr are obviously different. As the sulfurization pressure increased from 10 to 40 Torr, the PCEs of the CZTS devices increased from 5.6% (Voc = 0.583 V, Jsc = 17.9 mA cm−2, FF = 53.4%) to 8.7% (Voc = 0.691 V, Jsc = 20.2 mA cm−2, FF = 62.9%). Correspondingly, the series resistance (Rs) decreased from 6.7 to 3.3 Ω cm2 and the shunt resistance (Rsh) increased from 252.8 to 681.7 Ω cm2 (Table 2). We think that the CZTS devices’ performance improvement is mainly due to the enhancement of the crystallinity of the CZTS absorber layer, where there was an increase in grain size and decrease in SnS secondary phases at higher sulfurization pressures (Fig. 1 and 3a). It is also due to the improvement of CdS/CZTS junctions. The performance parameters of the CdS/CZTS junction, such as diode quality factor (A) and reverse saturation current density (J0), were derived from the plots of ln(J–GV) vs. V–RJ (Fig. 5b and Table 2).41 As the sulfurization pressure increased from 10 to 40 Torr, the A and J0 values of the CZTS devices decreased from 2.3 and 7.5 × 10−5 mA cm−2 to 1.8 and 8.3 × 10−7 mA cm−2, respectively. The smaller A and J0 values indicate lesser carrier recombination at the CdS/CZTS heterojunction, which is beneficial to decreasing the device shunt current and improving the performance of the CZTS devices.42
It was observed that further increasing the sulfurization pressure to 60 Torr caused a decrease in the PCE of the CZTS devices to 7.9% (Voc = 0.672 V, Jsc = 19.3 mA cm−2, FF = 61.7%) with Rs and Rsh values of 3.6 and 570.2 Ω cm2, respectively. We think that this is because there are two competing factors influencing device performance. On one hand, increased sulfurization pressure leads to large, uniform grains and reduces the nano-crystal thickness of the bottom layer, which reduces the photon-generated carrier recombination at the grain boundary, leading to better device performance. On the other hand, the increase of sulfurization pressure leads to more of the ZnS phase, as indicated in Fig. 3b. ZnS has less electron affinity than the CZTS absorber, which causes a “spike-like” band alignment with a value of 1.1 eV at the ZnS/CZTS interface. The large positive conduction band offset (CBO) causes an enhanced energy barrier for the electrons transport at the interface, which can increase the series resistance and decrease the Voc of the CZTS devices.43,44 Considering the above two factors, if the former is dominant, the properties of the CZTS films will be improved by increasing the sulfurization pressure. If the latter is dominant, the properties will degrade with increased sulfurization pressure. Based on our data, we think that the first factor was dominant when the sulfurization pressure was increased from 10 to 40 Torr, hence the PCE of the CZTS devices increased. However, the second factor became dominant when the sulfurization pressure increased from 40 to 60 Torr, so the PCE of the CZTS devices decreased.

Fig. 5c shows that the EQE plots of the CZTS devices with absorber layers sulfurized at different pressures have obviously different characteristics. The EQE losses at wavelengths below 520 nm are significant, as the incident light is absorbed by the CdS buffer with a relatively narrow band gap (Eg ≈ 2.45). The maximum EQEs of the CZTS devices with absorption layers sulfurized at 10, 20, 40, and 60 Torr were 81.5%, 87.1%, 89.1%, and 83.4% at 546 nm, respectively. However, all of the EQEs showed gradual decay after the peak EQE. This is because high recombination losses in the bulk and depletion regions can induce low collection efficiency, which is also the reason for the shorter minority carrier lifetime in the CZTS absorber layer that has been reported previously.45,46
The band gap (Eg) of the CZTS absorber can be derived by fitting a plot of (E·ln(1 − EQE))2vs. E near the band edge (Fig. 5d). The values are 1.50, 1.49, 1.47 and 1.48 eV for the CZTS absorbers sulfurized at pressures of 10, 20, 40 and 60 Torr, respectively.47 Changes in the band gaps may be caused by improvement of the crystallinity of the CZTS absorbers, and the mixture of a narrow bandgap semiconductor Cu2S (1.1–1.2 eV) secondary phase in the CZTS absorbers. The Eg of CZTS absorber sulfurized at 60 Torr was larger than that of sulfurized at 40 Torr. This is because more wide bandgap semiconductor ZnS second phase was distributed in the CZTS absorbing layer, ZnS has a much larger Eg than CZTS.48 This suggests that sulfurization pressure can remarkably affect the band gap of the CZTS absorber by tuning the composition elements during sulfurization.
4. Conclusions
In summary, CZTS films were fabricated by a two-stage process of Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursor co-electrodeposition and post-sulfurization. We found that the penetration and diffusion of S in the CZTS films can be controlled by increasing the sulfurization pressure. As the sulfurization pressure increases from 10 Torr to 60 Torr, the chemical composition of CZTS films gradually deviates from the stoichiometric value with increasing rates of Cu/(Zn + Sn), Zn/Sn and S/metals, which is due to the increase of S content and the decrease of volatile Sn content. The crystallinity of the CZTS absorption layer was better when the grain size of the top layer was large and the thickness of the bottom layer was low. After exploring the post-sulfurization process at pressures of 10–60 Torr, the highest efficiency of 8.7% (Voc = 0.691 V, Jsc = 20.2 mA cm−2, FF = 62.9%) for the co-electrodeposited CZTS solar cells was attained at a pressure of 40 Torr. Our work demonstrates that non-vacuum co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors, post-sulfurization in an S + N2 atmosphere, and a sputtered CdS buffer layer can successfully fabricate CZTS devices at low cost. Therefore, this process has broad industrial prospects.
