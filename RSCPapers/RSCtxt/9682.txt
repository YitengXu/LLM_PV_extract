    , Accepted 7th November 2017First published on 7th November 2017AbstractThe conversion of infrared light to visible-light which allows a larger fraction of sun-light to be used is needed to improve light-harvesting. In this work a tri-functional material composed of an up-converter (NaYF4–Yb–Tm), plasmonic gold nanorods and CdS was made photocatalytically active using 980 nm wavelength light for the reduction of H+ to H2.
The low light flux and weak energy density of sunlight on Earth (ca. 1 kW m−2), half of which is composed of infra-red light, are two limiting factors affecting the progress of solar-driven processes. Although considerable progress has been made in photovoltaic solar cells, their relatively high cost makes them non-competitive, compared to fossil fuels, for energy intensive systems (such as those used in chemical and transport industries). To date photocatalytic materials performance is far less than that of photovoltaics and are thus unsuitable for energy harvesting. There are many limiting factors behind this lack of progress. Most active semiconductor materials are either unstable in water1–3 or do not possess the electronic band edge requirements4 for the redox reaction needed for water splitting. Actually, owing to thermodynamics, most of the stable semiconductors, such as TiO2, SrTiO3 and GaN, have large band gaps (typically > 3 eV), which limits their use to specific small scale applications, which cannot compete with fossil fuel based processes.5 Over the last two decades, considerable efforts were undertaken to address these issues, such as anion doping to decrease the wide band gap of semiconductors,6–8 using multi-phase semiconductors9–12 and plasmonic metals to improve light harvesting13–15 and specific 3D-architecture to increase light harvesting and decrease the recombination rates of charge carriers,16–19 with limited success. A promising alternative to address the issue of wide band gap semiconductors is to change the light frequency rather than changing the materials’ energy gap and thus allow their use, since they are stable in water, in H2 generation. In this regard, up-conversion (UC) luminescence is attractive. However, the very weak efficiency of this system has made this process so far of marginal importance. A second requirement is thus needed and it is light amplification. A possible approach to this is the use of a plasmonic system poised to enhance the local electric field by many orders of magnitudes20 at the interface of the UC material, thus in theory, an efficient ternary (UC-plasmonic-catalyst material) system can be made. UC luminescence is the sequential absorption of two or more photons and can take place through a number of pathways, which have been discussed in various reviews and articles.21–27 Since Auzel and co-workers28 reported their pioneering work on lanthanide-based UC processes most materials studied are based on lanthanide ions, Lnx+, such as erbium (Er3+), holmium (Ho3+), and thulium (Tm3+) in an inorganic host containing ytterbium (Yb3+).
In this work, we have used an inorganic host material, NaYF4, in which Yb cations are dispersed: NaYF4–Yb. This results in light absorption at 980 nm which, when doped with Tm cations an up-converter emission takes place at different wavelengths. The absorbance at 980 nm and the emissions need to be tuned with the semiconductor band gap as well as with the plasmon resonance energy, to fulfil the compositional and structural requirements. We have prepared the up-conversion material (NaYF4–Yb,Tm) with Tm at% = 1.67% (with respect to Y and Yb) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1A, ESI†). The method of preparation is described in the ESI.† Fig. S1B and S1C (ESI†) show the response of the UC material to light frequency. We have prepared a few materials with different Tm%; the one reported here exhibited the best performance.
 Fig. 1  TEM and HRTEM of NaY(Yb)F4:Tm and Au/CdS/NaYF4(Yb):Tm. (A) TEM of NaYF4(Yb):Tm; (B) HRTEM of NaYF4(Yb):Tm; (C) Au/CdS/NaYF4(Yb):Tm; (D) STEM-HAADF of C; (E) HRTEM of the square area of C; (F) HRTEM, STEM and FFT of Au/CdS nanoparticles. 

Fig. 1A presents the TEM images of NaY(Yb)F4:Tm which is composed of individual crystallites of about 150–250 nm in size (details on sample preparation is given in the supplementary information). EDX analyses show the presence of F, Na, Yb and Y (the Cu signal comes from the TEM grid); The crystalline nature of NaY(Yb)F4 is shown in Fig. 1B. Au/CdS/NaY(Yb)F4:Tm is presented in Fig. 1C–F. The large particles correspond to NaY(Yb)F4, whereas the smaller ones are CdS. In addition, Au nanorods are also present in contact with CdS nanoparticles. There exists an intimate contact between all the phases present. Fig. 1C and D correspond to two images recorded in TEM and STEM-HAADF modes, respectively, of the same area of the sample.
A good contact exists between NaY(Yb)F4 and Au–CdS. A HRTEM image corresponding to the square depicted in Fig. 1C is shown in Fig. 1E. The crystallinity and good contact between the different phases is clear. The bottom right inset in Fig. 1F shows another STEM-HAADF image exhibiting CdS particles and Au nanorods. The upper part of the image in the white square is shown in HRTEM mode in Fig. 1F. The bottom left of Fig. 1F presents an FT image with spots at 3.2 Å, corresponding to the (101) crystallographic planes of the CdS support particle, while those at 2.4 and 2.0 Å correspond to the (111) and (200) crystallographic planes of the metallic Au nanorod, which is oriented along the [110] crystallographic direction. To summarize, the Au–CdS–NaY(Yb)F4 sample is composed of NaY(Yb)F4 crystallites of 150–250 nm surrounded by CdS nanoparticles of 40–80 nm. Some of the CdS nanoparticles are decorated with Au metal nanorods. There is a good contact between the different phases present in the sample and no agglomeration or segregation of a single phase occurs.
The system was excited using a femtosecond laser (Libra F-HE, Coherent) which has a maximum power of 4 W cm−2 in the IR region. As seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the up-conversion emissions of light at 800 nm and 477 nm are produced upon excitation with 980 nm light. In order to test this we prepared a CdS semiconductor (that absorbs light at around 500 nm) on top of which we placed Au nanorods (d = 10 nm and L = 41 nm, 0.25 wt%, the remaining is CdS; see the Methodology section). The CdS was prepared and characterized by following a previous work.2 We have measured the Au nanorods due to their particular plasmon resonance response in the IR and visible (Fig. 2) light range. This has resulted in the extension of the Au plasmon energy into the IR region due to both, the transversal and longitudinal plasmons.29,30 This wide spectral range, most likely due to light scattering, was in our favor, as it coincided with the absorbance edge of the up-converter (980 nm); and this is needed to enhance light adsorption which in turn is poised to enhance light emission. Fig. 2 shows that the presence of Au nanorods on top of CdS has resulted in a light absorption of above 800 nm, extending up to 1000 nm, thus covering the absorption edge of the UC material.
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorbance of CdS, 0.25 wt% Au/CdS before the reaction and 0.25 wt% Au/CdS/UC after the reaction (CdS to the upconverter (NaYF4–Yb–Tm) ratio is 1 to 1). Inset: UV-Vis absorbance of colloidal gold nanorods in water. Au NRs: 10 nm (d) and 41 nm (L). 
NaYF4(Yb):Tm crystals have a gagarinite group structure with five bands of 2Ag + 3E2g,31–33Fig. 3. The most enhanced phonon modes were at 253.4, 303.5, 366.2, 495.4 and 632.6 cm−1, these phonon modes are similar to un-doped NaYF4 samples. The contribution of Tm was not observed due to its low concentration.
 Fig. 3  Raman shift spectra of NaYF4(Yb):Tm, Au/CdS/NaYF4(Yb):Tm and Au/CdS. 
The electron–phonon coupling in these lattices takes place at relatively low energy phonon modes. Due to this property, NaYF4 is considered to be the best host for the up-conversion with different rare earth ions.34 The Raman spectrum of Au–CdS shows two phonon vibrational modes, first and second order LO modes at 301.6 and 601.5 cm−1.35 A shift of 5.8 cm−1 in the case of Au–CdS/NaYF4/Yb:Tm is noted when compared to Au–CdS.
The complete UC catalyst was excited with 980 nm light (the absorbance edge of the UC) in the presence of gas phase methanol/air, followed by monitoring the reaction products (see the ESI† for more details on the experimental set up and data acquisition). CdS can only work as a semiconductor upon excitation with visible light and is therefore inactive when excited with 980 nm light. The needed energy is provided by the up-converter material since a fraction of 980 nm light is converted to 802 nm and 477 nm which excite both, the Au nanorods and the CdS, respectively. The results were positive, H2 and CO2 were detected and monitored (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Reaction products of CH3OH under 980 nm excitation over (A) 0.25 wt% Au/CdS-(NaYF4–Yb–Tm) with a 1:1 ratio. (B) 0.25 wt% Au/(NaYF4–Yb–Tm). Ambient-air + gas phase CH3OH. Humidity is ≈50% at 20 °C, 1 atm (≈2 kPa). CH3OH vapor pressure is ≈10 kPa. Rates are indicated inside the figure. 
The photocatalytic methanol reaction in the presence of O2 and/or H2O can be summarized using the following three equations:CH3OHg + 3/2O2 → CO2 + 2H2Ogtotal oxidation ΔfH° = −676 kJ mol−1(1)CH3OHg + 1/2O2 → CO2 + 2H2partial oxidation ΔfH° = −192 kJ mol−1(2)CH3OHg + H2Og → CO2 + 3H2reforming ΔfH° = +49 kJ mol−1(3)
The observed ratio of the reaction rates between H2 and CO2 in Fig. 4A is above the stoichiometric ratio of 2 (eqn (2)) and this is due to the presence of gas phase water. Methanol is an excellent hole-scavenger which allows excited electrons to reduce H+ (of surface −OH) to H2.36 After e injections into the valence band (VB) methanol is converted into formaldehyde which in turn is oxidized (with molecular or dissociated oxygen anion radicals) to give CO2 upon further e injections into the VB.37 In the presence of water, the reaction affords more H2 (eqn (3)) and the energy needed to drive the reaction (endothermic) is obtained from light, in this case. The traces of methane might be due to a further reaction of CO2 with hydrogen atoms.38 As the Au NRs are capped with an organic compound we repeated the experiments in the absence of methanol (blank) to test their possible contribution to the reaction and the results were found to be negative (Fig. S2, ESI†). This indicates that H2 and CO2 do not originate from the ligand capping the NRs. Then we tested the UC material without the semiconductor CdS but with Au nanorods. Previous reports have indicated that Au nanoparticles alone can reduce H+ to H2 once excited with visible light.39–41 Indeed, the visible light and probably the 800nm IR light, both generated by the UC made the reaction possible (with ca. 0.25–0.30 of the activity obtained when CdS was present). This indicates that H2 production may in part originate from the direct catalytic reaction of the Au NRs upon excitation. The ratio of the production rate of H2 to CO2 in the absence of CdS is found to be less than 1. The absence of the semiconductor (the absence of energy levels for e transfer from methanol to the VB of CdS) is probably the reason where in this case only hot e from Au NRs are involved in the reaction which in turn makes oxygen anion radical routes more efficient, generating more CO2 by direct oxidation of methanol. The system does not work in the absence of a metal (since it is needed to trap excited electrons), so one cannot separately test the extent of enhancement due to Au NRs alone without the addition of another metal such as a Pd NP, but this is the subject of a separate study. The quantum yield of the reaction cannot be accurately computed because of laser light scattering and because the amount of the catalyst was not optimized, in spite of knowing the light flux at 980 nm (ca. 1017hν (cm2 s)−1), the reactor volume (6 mL) and the hydrogen rate (ca. 5 × 10−6 mole per 100 min = 3.7 × 10−11 mole s−1; Fig. 3) an estimate of the yield was calculated and found to be ≥4 × 10−2%. However, the mere observation of catalytic H2 production indicates that converting IR light to visible light, needed to excite both a visible light driven semiconductor as well as the two plasmonic resonance of Au nanorods (transverse and longitudinal modes at ca. 500 and 800 nm, respectively), is possible and can reduce H+ to H2.
