The upconversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation processes of molecular dyes is a very versatile approach, but it requires a systematic photophysical characterization of the systems to optimize the upconversion yields and develop materials for technological applications. This paper represents an overview of the work carried out in our laboratories for the study and characterization of a molecular dye pair, 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphyrin platinum(II) (PtOEP) and 1,3,6,8-tetraphenylpyrene (TPPy), suitable as the sensitizer and emitter, respectively, in a triplet–triplet annihilation based upconversion process. The investigation has been carried out in various media with increasing complexity. First, we used the dye pair to characterize the UC-efficiencies in homogeneous solvents of different viscosities and in oil-in-water microemulsions; then we explored the possibility to achieve upconversion in solid materials, like nanostructured silica matrices and liquid filled microcapsules. The possibility to achieve upconversion emission even in confined and rigid media has been confirmed and can inspire further applications of the process.L.

Introduction
Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) based on coordination compounds and organic molecules has been receiving notable attention for the last fifteen years, even though the phenomenon dates back to the sixties.1,2 TTA-UC is usually accomplished by means of coordination compounds such as a metallated porphyrin, which behaves as antenna in the visible region and can sensitize an organic molecule characterized by high quantum yield of fluorescence, like a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which plays the role of a higher-energy emitter. The interest of many researchers has been triggered by the possibility of obtaining TTA-UC upon low-energy, non-coherent excitation3–6 and applying it to various fields.7 These range from solar energy conversion,8–14 such as integration with dye sensitized solar cells, photocatalytic water splitting and production of solar fuels, to biomedical tools,15–18 including realization of UC liposomes, analysis of in vivo biodistributed UC nanocapsules, UC based core–shell quantum dots19 or organic nanofibers.20 The choice of a suitable UC pair21–33 also requires a detailed investigation of the factors driving the process. In particular, the intimate mechanism of TTA,34–49 the optimal tuning of the triplet energies of the sensitizer and the emitter,50,51 the study of possible aggregation phenomena,52,53 and the removal or the protection from oxygen in the environment54–56 need to be considered. However, the realization of UC materials oriented towards the above applications often requires the incorporation of the sensitizer and the emitter in a rigid medium or a solid matrix57–71 where generally a significant decrease of the upconversion quantum yield and intensity has been reported, mainly due to the reduced mobility of the dyes.67,72,73
Our first approach to TTA-UC was motivated by the attempt to minimize the waste of solar visible photons in the study of solid solutions of metal oxides as heterogeneous photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water.74–78
Herein, we report an overview of our research activity in this field, where the 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphyrin platinum(II) (PtOEP) and the 1,3,6,8-tetraphenylpyrene (TPPy) were used as model sensitizer and emitter, respectively, to investigate the TTA-UC in different environments. Therefore we report on our previous studies carried out in homogeneous solutions,79,80 oil-in-water microemulsions,80 silica nanoparticles81 and the preliminary results of unpublished works in liquid-filled microcapsules. Though most of the work was carried out using the PtOEP/TPPy as UC pair, some interesting results were also obtained by using 9,10-diphenyl anthracene (DPA) as emitter. The latest developments and future perspectives are also presented.
Results and discussion
Study in homogeneous solutions: UC pair optimization
The first step was the choice of a suitable pair of compounds which could work as sensitizer and emitter, respectively. As far as the antenna component is concerned, our attention was drawn by porphyrin molecules, which usually exhibit two absorption features: the Soret band, in the near UV region, and the Q band, located above 500 nm. The latter band is particularly interesting since it can be excited by low-frequency visible radiation. We took two porphyrin molecules into consideration, namely PdOEP and PtOEP.79 As for the emitter species, TPPy, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having an almost unitary quantum yield of fluorescence (ϕF = 0.96 ± 0.05)82 was chosen. The lowest triplet excited state of TPPy only lies a few cm−1 above the triplet states of the porphyrin sensitizers and we have shown79 that the collisional Dexter energy transfer between the triplet states of the antenna and the emitter can anyway occur driven by the contribution of the entropy of mixing to the Gibbs free energy, as previously reported in the literature.41 This energy difference is 221 cm−1 and 665 cm−1 in the case of the two couples PtOEP/TPPy and PdOEP/TPPY, respectively. We investigated the energy transfer process between the sensitizer and the emitter in deoxygenated media to lengthen the lifetime of the sensitizer excited state and increase the energy transfer probability, obtaining the Stern–Volmer constant and the quenching kinetic parameters (KSV = 47600 ± 900 dm3 mol−1, kQ = (5.3 ± 0.1) × 108 dm3 mol−1 s−1 and KSV = 15400± 900 dm3 mol−1, kQ = (3.35 ± 0.07) × 107 dm3 mol−1 s−1 for PtOEP and PdOEP, respectively).79 Based on these data the PtOEP–TPPy pair allows for the most efficient energy transfer. Moreover, the presence of the Pt heavy atom enhances the spin–orbit coupling in the system, thereby increasing the kinetic constant for the collisional Dexter energy transfer between the triplet states of the antenna and the emitter. Thus, we selected the PtOEP–TPPy pair (Fig. 1) to continue our investigation.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of PtOEP and TPPy. 
In our experiments, excitation was carried out by the non-coherent emission of a Xe lamp at 536 nm, at a low incident power of a few tens mW cm−2, comparable to the solar irradiance in AM 1.5 conditions integrated across the Q-band of the porphyrin sensitizers (for experimental details, see ref. 79–81). Under these conditions, the kQ can be identified with the kinetic constant which characterizes the energy transfer process:T1(sensitizer) + S0(emitter) → S0(sensitizer) + T1(emitter)
The choice of the PtOEP/TPPy as the sensitizer/emitter pair in the UC experiment also allows a high portion of the emitted light from the TPPy to be collected without any significant re-absorption by the porphyrin sensitizer, whose Q band is red-shifted with respect to TPPy fluorescence, as it can be seen in Fig. 2.

Toluene was chosen as a suitable solvent to solubilise the two compounds and perform the upconversion experiments. The following step was then the optimization of the concentration ratio of the two compounds PtOEP and TPPy. Therefore, we explored the dependence of the upconversion quantum yield, ϕUC, on the concentrations of the sensitizer and the emitter involved in the process. The porphyrin content was fixed at the order of magnitude of 1 × 10−5 mol L−1, while the concentration of the emitter was varied in the range from 6 × 10−5 mol L−1 to 3 × 10−3 mol L−1. The maximum value of green-to-violet upconverted emission, ϕUC = 3.8%, was found for a concentration ratio of 60 between [TPPy] and [PtOEP], under irradiation with an intensity of 13.3 mW cm−2.79
Study in homogeneous solutions: solvent effects
Later on, we investigated the role of the medium; bromobenzene and anisole were used as solvents, instead of toluene. Even though they have similar structure, the viscosity increases from toluene to anisole, passing through bromobenzene; furthermore, in the latter, the presence of the Br heavy atom could influence the spin–orbit coupling in the system. However, we focused our attention on viscosity because that is one of the most important parameters to be taken into account in light of the possible use of these molecules in polymers, solid matrices, rigid media, etc., considering its detrimental effect on the diffusion of the donor–emitter pair. The data in Table 1 show that there is not a simple linear dependence of the upconversion quantum yield with increasing solvent viscosity. Nevertheless, viscosity and spin–orbit coupling are not the only parameters to be considered for a correct and exhaustive description of the UC-process and other factors such as, for instance, the low phosphorescence rate constant value, kP, observed in toluene, may play an important role as well. The measurements were carried out under the same experimental conditions, using an excitation intensity of 19.4 mW cm−2 at 536 nm. For all the three solvents, the highest upconversion quantum yields (Table 1) were obtained at a concentration ratio of 60 between the emitter and the sensitizer, that is [PtOEP] = 1 × 10−5 mol L−1 and [TPPy] = 6 × 10−4 mol L−1, as already found in our previous experiments. The ϕUC value is by far highest in toluene, where the lowest viscosity makes the molecular diffusion easier and therefore enhances the efficiency of both the triplet–triplet energy transfer process from the PtOEP to the TPPy and the TTA. Furthermore, in the same solvent, PtOEP exhibits the lowest ϕP and kP values, thereby indicating that the radiative deactivation of the donor triplet state, which competes with the energy transfer process to the TPPy molecule, gives a minor contribution in toluene than in the other two solvents explored.

PtOEP and TPPy in oil-in-water microemulsions
We explored the possibility to confine the upconverting couple PtOEP–TPPy, thus favouring the encounter of the two species and possibly enhancing the UC quantum yield, by investigating the inclusion of the sensitizer and the emitter molecules in an oil-in-water microemulsion. Based on the aforementioned results and the high ϕUC measured in toluene, we prepared a toluene-based micro-heterogeneous system with TX-100 and 1-pentanol as surfactant and co-surfactant agents, respectively, that allow for the stabilization of oil droplets in which the sensitizer–emitter couple are solubilized. This mixture allowed us to obtain an optically transparent oil-in-water microemulsion.80 However, due to solubility issues of the solutes in the toluene pools, it was impossible to load the microemulsions with sensitizer and emitter contents higher than a ratio [TPPy]/[PtOEP] equal to 10. This fact, along with an increase of the ϕP for PtOEP (from 0.41 in pure toluene to 0.71 in the microemulsion) and a decrease of the ϕF for TPPy (from 1 in toluene to 0.62 in the microemulsion), both detrimental to the upconversion process, brought about a significant decrease of ϕUC in the oil-in water microemulsion compared to the toluene solution. Indeed, upon irradiation at 536 nm with an excitation intensity of 19.4 mW cm−2, the ϕUC dropped from 0.19 in pure toluene down to 0.01 in the heterogeneous system, confirming what had previously been reported in similar upconversion experiments in surfactant aqueous solution83 and in a water environment.84 One of the possible ways to overcome this obstacle might be increasing the toluene cavity inside the oil-in-water microemulsion, but this would require a modification of the microemulsion composition and structure.
Upconverting pairs in silica matrices
Taking into account the possible technological uses of the upconverting systems, such as the integration into photovoltaic devices or their use as bio-imaging tools, we focused our attention on the incorporation of the sensitizer and the emitter in solid matrices. Despite the well-known drawbacks, among which there is the important decrease of UC-emission efficiency (very low QY) under these experimental conditions,67,72 the suitable entrapment of dye pairs in solid matrices would extraordinarily expand the use of TTA-based UC systems in real devices or materials. Furthermore, recent studies have reported the possibility of achieving intense emission signal even in these rigid media, once the dyes are pre-organized85 or adequately arranged into the solid matrix.86 Therefore, we thought to the use of silica materials for their tunable morphology and their sustainability. In particular, we prepared mesoporous microstructured silicate material (SBA), which was loaded with PtOEP/TPPy upconversion pair.81 Due to the sufficiently large pores of the matrix (4–14 nm)87 high amounts of sensitizer and emitter could be loaded into the structure, with the possibility of keeping the concentration ratio [TPPy]/[PtOEP] = 60 to ensure an optimized encounter frequency between the species. Despite the above-mentioned conditions, no upconverted emission could be detected upon excitation of the dye-doped SBA samples at 535 nm with an intensity of 19.0 mW cm−2. The phosphorescence spectra recorded on PtOEP-SBA (see ESI†) system showed that the entrapment in silica matrices did not modify the energy of the sensitizer state. The lack of UC-detection could be due to the reduced mobility of the organic molecules arranged in crystals but also to the formation of aggregates and excimer-like species, with consequent modification of the energy of the excited electronic states. However, even when the dye concentrations were reduced to limit the formation of aggregate species, no UC emission was detected, indicating that the matrices rigidity and the lack of diffusion of the dyes prevented the occurrence of bi-molecular processes necessary to generate up-converted emission.
Upconverting pairs in solid capsules: Perspectives
The results reported above evidence that the matrices must have a reduced stiffness to mimic the solution dynamic and ensure the occurrence of bi-molecular processes. Hence, we decided to employ materials with a core–shell structure, in which the core provides a flexible medium to allow the dye diffusion, while the stiff shell protects and confines the dyes from the environment. Thus, we undertook preliminary investigations to obtain UC emission in solid systems by preparing two different kinds of core–shell structured materials and evaluated their perspective development as solid containers.
At first instance PtOEP and TPPy were encapsulated into silica core–shell nanoparticles; using a template assisted sol–gel procedure, nanoparticles with a mean external and internal diameters of 10 and 2 nm,88,89 respectively, were formed (inset Fig. 3). The hydrophobic tail of the surfactant (Pluronic® Pf-127, which is used as template to grow the silica shell) enables the dissolution of the dyes, although in quite small amounts (1.7 × 10−6 and 8.4 × 10−5 mmol mg−1 for PtOEP and TPPy, respectively). More importantly, these conditions, where the sensitizer and the emitter lay in the amorphous structure and soft environment of the core, enable the dynamics required by the triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. Indeed, after deoxygenation of the dye-loaded silica NPs, both phosphorescence of the sensitizer (λem = 645 nm) and upconversion emission (λem = 430 nm) bands could indeed be detected (Fig. 3) from the sample in its powder form.
 Fig. 3  PtOEP phosphorescence (red) and upconversion emission (blue) spectra of NPs loaded with PtOEP and TPPy under nitrogen atmosphere. Inset: TEM image of the NPs. 
The inclusion of the dye pair in silica core–shell nanoparticles resulted a promising approach, since the core is soft enough to ensure the occurrence of bimolecular processes and the detection of a feeble UC-emission; but the dye loading needs to be optimized in order to increase the concentration of encapsulated dyes enhancing the antenna cross section and the probability of energy transfer processes. This future aim can be achieved acting on the solubility of the dyes in the surfactant solution, but also increasing the core portion compared to the shell. Further work has to be carried out to make the shell less permeable to oxygen, in order to avoid the necessity of deoxygenation once the materials are prepared in oxygen-free atmosphere.
An alternative strategy for increasing the soft portion of the particle consists in the preparation of liquid-filled polymeric capsules.90 In particular, with mononuclear polymeric core–shell microcapsules, payloads as high as 90% can be obtained, which also guarantees a high UC dyes loading. In this case, the liquid core solubilizes the dyes, allowing the dye dynamic to assist the bimolecular processes involved in the TTA-UC and the solid polymeric shell confines and protects the core part. The liquid-filled capsules are then used to achieve liquid-like behaviors although in their powder form.91,92
As proof-of-concept, polyurea (PU) microcapsules were prepared through the interfacial polymerization.93 Polyurea shell, which guarantees high internal liquid retention, is obtained polymerizing a polyisocyanate (i.e. Desmodour®N100) and a polyamine (i.e. diethylentriamine). As core inert oil, Miglyol®812 (a capylic/capric triglyceride oil) was used for dissolving the UC dyes; it was selected for its low volatility, which ensure a better capsules stability over time.91 TPPy and PtOEP were used with a [TPPy]/[PtOEP] ratio of 60. For the capsules preparation, the organic phase (made of the oil, the dyes and the isocyanate) was emulsified (through magnetic stirring) into the water phase, containing a surfactant (polyvinyl alcohol) and the polyamine. After emulsifying for 5 min, upon heating the emulsion at 60 °C, spherical microcapsules of 70–200 μm were obtained. The suspension was then freeze-dried over 2 days to achieve the final capsules powder.94 The de-oxygenated microcapsules powder, irradiated with a nanosecond pulsed laser (532 nm, 30 mW cm−2), showed both phosphorescence (of PtOEP, λem = 645 nm) and UC (of TPPy, λem = 430 nm) emissions (Fig. 4). The observation of high UC emission suggests an efficient encapsulation of the oil solution of the dyes. As expected, the oil medium of the capsule core allows molecular diffusion (as in bulk solutions) and therefore the occurrence of the two bimolecular processes that lead to UC. Though UC was successfully observed from the microcapsules powder, the light scattering provided by the solid material hampers the quantitative determination of the UC efficiency (QY), which is under ongoing studies.

Notably, these preliminary results showed that the capsules strategy allowed to observe UC in solid systems (capsules powder of Fig. 4a), where generally this process is prevented by the lack of molecular diffusion.
The microencapsulation is a quite versatile and general strategy since it allows a straightforward tuning of the oil core, the shell material and the dye pair, as well as the capsules size. For example, UC emission of the PU microcapsules could be easily modified using a hexadecane solution of PtOEP/DPA ([DPA]/[PtOEP] = 30) as the internal core (Fig. 5).

The composition and dimensions of the capsules, together with their further photophysical characterization, are the object of the ongoing research finalized to the optimization of these systems. In this context, the perspective work is focused on reducing the size of the capsules to the nanometer scale to eliminate the light scattering phenomena and then achieve quantitative radiation up-conversion in nanocapsules-containing polymeric matrices which can facilitate the integration of these materials in technological devices. The encapsulation is surely one of the most investigated and promising approach to achieve efficient UC in solid media. Some examples have been already reported57,95–98 in the latest years, showing their use in the fabrication of UC films or as tool for bioimaging. The preparation of nanoparticles with TTA-based UC properties will enable the exploitation of UC with non-coherent radiation sources.
Conclusions
In this brief account, the investigation of a couple of molecular systems acting as the sensitizer (PtOEP) and emitter (TPPy) in a triplet–triplet annihilation based upconversion process has been reported. Our studies have been carried out in various media, such as homogeneous solvents of different viscosities, oil-in-water microemulsions, nanostructured silica matrices and liquid filled micro/nanocapsules. The upconverting molecular systems have great potential developments due to the large variety of organic and organo-metallic dyes whose electronic properties can be tuned to the expected behaviour through chemical functionalization or by controlling their molecular arrangements.
The proof-of-concept that UC properties are preserved also in solid phase in inorganic or organic media, as we have shown in the cases of nanostructured silica matrices and liquid filled microcapsules, opens the possibility to apply these systems in real devices.
Of course, important improvements are still necessary before the knowledge is transferred to devices production. Further measurements are object of the ongoing research in our laboratories, finalized to the optimization of these systems. The main aspects that have to be improved are the intensity of UC emission in solid phase and the optimization of the synthetic procedures to obtain nanocapsules, which would allow us to give a better quantitative definition of the upconversion quantum yields in these media.
