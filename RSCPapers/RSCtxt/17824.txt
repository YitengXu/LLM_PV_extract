, Accepted 5th June 2023First published on 5th June 2023AbstractRecently, copper halide perovskite CsCu2I3 has been reported to be a prospective material for short-wavelength optoelectronic devices due to its superior photophysical properties. In this work, CsCu2I3 thin films are investigated by four different preparation strategies including pulsed laser deposition, vacuum thermal evaporation, laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition and spin coating. The crystal quality and photoelectric properties of CsCu2I3 thin films prepared by different deposition methods have been studied. Heterojunction photodetectors based on p-CsCu2I3/n-GaN are constructed and the photoresponse characteristics of the photodetectors are investigated. The results show that CsCu2I3 thin films with high-quality can be prepared by different deposition methods. In addition, the photodetectors are used as sensing pixels in an ultraviolet imaging system, and the imaging patterns are realized. The photodetectors with good stability exhibiting a sensitive ultraviolet photoresponse and imaging capability might pave the way for developing Cu-based perovskite hybrid photoelectric devices.
Introduction
In recent years, optoelectronic devices (such as light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, solar cells, etc.) based on Pb-based perovskite materials have developed rapidly and shown great potential for practical application due to their advantages of high light absorption, tunable band gap and low cost.1–9 In particular, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells is close to that of the crystalline silicon cells.10 However, the intrinsic toxicity issues of lead have hindered the environment-friendly application and commercialization of these devices.11 In addition, Sn-based perovskites attract much research interest in narrow-bandgap perovskite solar cells, but stability remains an issue.12 Efficiency issues hinder the further application of Ge-based perovskites.13 Alternatively, nontoxic Cu-based perovskite (CsCu2I3) with excellent material stability has a wide band gap that exceeds 3.7 eV. Therefore, CsCu2I3 shows great potential for applications in optoelectronic devices.14
High-quality films and excellent carrier transport characteristics are key factors affecting the photoelectric response performance of perovskite devices.15 Currently, the main method for the preparation of Cu-based perovskite materials is the solution method. Cu-based perovskite films prepared by the solution method exhibit impressive photovoltaic properties.16,17 In addition, high-quality films with excellent photoelectric performance can be obtained by adding additional organic solvent.18,19 Cu-based perovskites prepared by the solution method have the advantages of high quality, simple growth process and low cost, which promote their application and development.20–23 However, the inability to precisely control the film thickness and large area preparation are the disadvantages of the solution method.
Meanwhile, another kind of important preparation technology, vacuum growth methods, has attracted much interest in the preparation of perovskite materials because of their advantages of controllable film thickness and large area growth.24 Furthermore, the vacuum environment can effectively prevent the phase transition, and much higher stability of as-grown films can be realized.25 The vacuum growth methods are usually occurring in the gas-phase process, which is conducive to the composite of perovskite materials and nanostructure substrates, while avoiding the substrate materials being immersed in the solution.26 It has obvious advantages and application prospects for the design and preparation of perovskite devices with complex structures.27
To evaluate the effects of various growth processes on the Cu-based perovskite materials, CsCu2I3 thin films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE), laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LACVD) and spin coating (SC) in this paper. The quality and optoelectronic properties of CsCu2I3 thin films grown under different preparation technologies have been investigated. With n-GaN epitaxial wafers serving as the substrates, p-CsCu2I3/n-GaN heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors were prepared and the photoresponse characteristics were studied. This study not only systematically explored the effects of preparation technology on the quality of CsCu2I3 thin films for the first time but also demonstrated the potential application prospects of Cu-based perovskites in the field of hybrid photoelectric devices.
Experimental
The Si-doped n-GaN epitaxial wafers (prepared by MOCVD) were used as the substrates. In order to obtain the evaporation source of CsCu2I3 films, CsI and CuI powders were mixed in molar ratios of 1:2 and then fully ground in the dark. The CsCu2I3 targets for PLD and LACVD were made from CsI and CuI mixed powders (1:2) and then pressed under 40 MPa with a tablet machine. For the SC preparation, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI and CuI mixed powders (1:2) in DMSO and DMF solution with a volume ratio of 4:1. The experimental details for the growth of CsCu2I3 films can be found in Table S1 (ESI†).
The morphology of the CsCu2I3 films was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8010) and atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco DI nanoscope III). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB Xi) patterns were employed to analyze the information on elemental states and chemical components in the CsCu2I3 films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected by a Bruker D8 Advance Powder X-ray diffractometer. The absorbance and transmittance spectra of the thin films grown on a quartz substrate were measured using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550). The PL spectra were measured using the PL system with a He-Cd laser (Kimmon Koha Co., Ltd, operating at 325 nm). The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were obtained by using an Edinburgh instrument (F900). A thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA-2) was used to analyze the thermal stability of the material.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the schematic diagram for the fabrication of CsCu2I3 films by PLD, VTE, LACVD, and SC. To improve the comparability of the experiments, the grown parameters for CsCu2I3 thin films have been optimized under different methods. Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of CsCu2I3 films prepared by four different preparation methods. As can be seen, all the CsCu2I3 films grown on the GaN substrate exhibit diffraction peaks at 26.15° corresponding to the (221) planes of CsCu2I3 (JCPDS No. 77-0069).28 However, the as-grown sample prepared by SC grew preferentially along the (112) crystal plane. The full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the (221) crystal plane, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), indicated that the CsCu2I3 films prepared by VTE have the smallest value (∼0.159°), which represents the highest crystalline quality. The lattice mismatch can be calculated by the formula (eqn (1)):29

The crystal plane parameters of GaN(002) and CsCu2I3(221) are shown in Fig. 1(b). The lattice mismatches in two directions are 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively. Owing to the small lattice mismatches, high-quality CsCu2I3 films have been obtained on GaN substrates. Furthermore, a diffraction peak of CuI(111) has been found in the CsCu2I3 films prepared by VTE and PLD, and the reason has been explained in the previous study.29 XRD results showed that the CsCu2I3 films were successfully prepared by different methods. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the n-GaN substrates.
Fig. 1(c)–(f) shows SEM images of CsCu2I3 films grown by different methods. The thickness of the prepared films is about 200 nm. The CsCu2I3 films prepared by VTE, LACVD, PLD and SC are relatively dense without obvious pinhole phenomena. The vacuum method has significant advantages over the solution method for the preparation of large-area CsCu2I3 films. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows SEM images of large-area films prepared by VTE, it can be seen that CsCu2I3 films are large and uniform. The EDS spectrum shows that the atomic ratios of Cs, Cu and I are close to 1:2:3, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The element mappings of the CsCu2I3 film, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) verified that Cs, Cu, and I are distributed uniformly in the films. The surface roughness of the CsCu2I3 films has been obtained by AFM, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). As can be seen, the CsCu2I3 film prepared by the VTE exhibits much smaller roughness and uniform particle size.
Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the XPS spectra of the CsCu2I3 film prepared by VTE. XPS spectra of Cs, Cu and I elements were studied after calibration with the standard carbon peak (284.8 eV). The results showed that the core level of Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 is located at the peak of 724.6 eV and 738.5 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the Cu 2p3/2 core level and Cu 2p1/2 core level are located at the peak of 932.5 eV and 952.2 eV. It is indicated that the copper ion is Cu+ rather than Cu2+. Moreover, the core levels of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 are located at the peak of 619.5 eV, and 630.9 eV.30 The results showed that the CsCu2I3 film only contains Cs, Cu and I elements, and the valence states of the corresponding elements do not change.31
Fig. 2(a) shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra of the films, and the average luminescence lifetimes of the samples (PLD, VTE, LACVD and SC) are 1.90 ns, 3.01 ns, 1.44 ns, and 1.09 ns, respectively. Compared with the other three technologies, the CsCu2I3 film prepared by VTE has the longest luminescence lifetime, which means that the film has fewer defects. Fig. 2(b) shows the PL spectra of the CsCu2I3 films. The films prepared by the four technologies show a broad-band emission spectrum centered at 575 nm, which is caused by the strong self-trapped exciton effect, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).32 Furthermore, a weak luminescence at 410 nm can be found in the CsCu2I3 films prepared by SC and VTE, which corresponds to the CuI owing to insufficient precursor reaction. Fig. 2(c) shows the absorption spectrum under the area stacking mode and the corresponding optical band gap of the CsCu2I3 films. The corresponding optical band gap is around 3.7 eV, and the details can be found in Fig. S10 (ESI†).33 Fig. 2(d) shows the transmittance spectrum of the CsCu2I3 films. As can be seen, all the transmittance of the CsCu2I3 films exceeds 80% in the visible light band.

Combined with density functional theory (DFT), the band structure and density of states of CsCu2I3 were calculated. From Fig. 2(e), both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of CsCu2I3 appear at the Γ point, indicating that CsCu2I3 is a direct bandgap semiconductor (the calculated band gap is 3.153 eV).30 As shown in Fig. 2(f), Cu 3d, Cu 4s, and I 5p orbitals contribute mainly to the VBM and CBM, while Cs+ contributes little.31 Theoretical details are detailed in the ESI.†
To investigate the photoelectric characteristics of the CsCu2I3 films, heterojunction UV photodetectors based on CsCu2I3/n-GaN have been prepared by using the Au/Ni and Au/Ti films as ohmic electrodes. A schematic diagram of the photodetectors is shown in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b)–(e) show the I–V characteristics of the photodetectors prepared by VTE, PLD, LACVD and SC in the dark and under 360 nm UV front illumination (19.35 mW cm−2). It is noted that all four devices have good rectification characteristics. By calculating the light-dark current ratio of the different devices, the photodetector prepared by VTE exhibits the largest value (640) at 0 V, while the other three devices are all less than 100.

The spectral responsivity (R), detectivity (D*) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are three key factors for the photodetector and can be calculated using the following equations (eqn (2)–(4)):30,34

(4)where Iph and Id represent the photocurrent and dark current, Plight is the power density of incident light, q is the electronic charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), S represents the illumination area on the photodiode (0.1 cm2), h is the Planck constant (4.136 × 1015 eV s), c is the velocity of light, and λ is the illumination wavelength. Fig. 3(f) and (g) show the responsivity and detectivity curves of different photodetectors. As we can see, all the photodetectors are sensitive to UV in the 330–360 nm band with good spectral selectivity. By comparison, the responsivity (42 mA W−1) and detectivity (1.42 × 1011 Jones) of the photodetector prepared by VTE are larger than those of the other devices. As shown in Fig. 3(h), the EQE of the photodetector reaches 14.5%, 2.2%, 4.3% and 4.9% at 360 nm which is prepared by VTE, PLD, LACVD and SC, respectively. The time-response curves of the devices, as shown in Fig. 3(i), indicate that all the devices have good repeatability and stability. For comparison, the performance of the Cu-based perovskite photodetector has been listed in Table S2 (ESI†).35–46
Due to the compatibility of VTE technology and the silicon-based semiconductor process, we chose the photodetector prepared by VTE to conduct a more detailed study to evaluate the photoelectric performance of the device further. Fig. 4(a) shows the photocurrent and dark current curves of the photodetector prepared by VTE under different light intensities. The I–V curves exhibit obvious rectification behavior, which represents the successful preparation of the CsCu2I3/n-GaN heterojunction. The dependence of photocurrent (I) on light power is plotted in Fig. 4(b) and can be expressed by the following formula (eqn (5)):34 
I = CPθ
(5)where C is a constant for a certain wavelength, and the exponent θ determines the response of the photocurrent to the light intensity. In this work, the value of θ is 0.705, which indicates the existence of continuous localized states in the mobility gap of the structure. Fig. 4(c) shows the responsivity (the light intensities changed from 29.7 μW to 19.35 mW). When the light power is 29.7 μW, the corresponding responsivity of the device is 42 mA W−1; when the light power increases to 19.35 mW, the corresponding responsivity of the device decreases as small as 4.6 mA W−1. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the corresponding detectivity. The responsivity and detectivity decreases with the increase of the light power, which is consistent with previous research results.47 Fig. 4(d) shows the time-dependent photoresponse curves of the photodetector under different light intensities. As can be seen, the photodetector exhibits good response and stability.

(f) Schematic energy band diagram of the CsCu2I3/GaN heterojunction. 
In order to explain the photoresponse mechanism of the CsCu2I3/GaN heterojunction photodetector, the energy band information of the material was studied. Fig. 4(e) shows UPS spectra of CsCu2I3 films, and the energy band position of CsCu2I3 was obtained by calculation. Hall tests were subsequently performed on CsCu2I3 and GaN, and the results show that the CsCu2I3 presents weak p-type conductivity, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The optical band gap of CsCu2I3 is 3.73 eV and that of GaN is 3.4 eV.48 The electron affinities of CsCu2I3 and GaN are 2.96 eV and 4.1 eV, respectively.49 Combined with the Anderson band model, the energy band arrangement diagram of the p-CsCu2I3/n-GaN heterojunction has been proposed, as shown in Fig. 4(f). When UV light irradiates to the side of CsCu2I3, a large number of photogenerated carriers are produced inside CsCu2I3. Under the pull of the built-in electric field, the photogenerated electrons are collected on the side of GaN and the photogenerated holes are collected on the side of CsCu2I3. The photogenerated carriers are collected by the electrodes to generate photocurrent. Due to the proper band alignment and large band offset, the CsCu2I3/GaN heterojunction can achieve self-powered UV detection performance at zero bias.
Furthermore, the long-term storage stability of the CsCu2I3 film has been tested. Fig. S12(a) (ESI†) shows the PL stability of the films under the atmospheric environment after 30 days. A slightly increased (1.31 nm) FWHM can be observed in the PL emission peak without more changes. As shown in Fig. S12(b) (ESI†), significant changes were not observed in the XRD patterns after 30 days, indicating that the CsCu2I3 films show good structural stability. Fig. S12(c) (ESI†) shows the thermal stability of the CsCu2I3 films. Furthermore, Fig. S12(d) (ESI†) shows the long-term storage stability of the CsCu2I3/GaN heterojunction photodetector (30 days).
Fig. 5(a) shows the schematic diagram used for the image sensing system. During the detection imaging, the corresponding images were produced on the masks with “L”, “D” and “U” patterns under 360 nm light illumination, respectively (LDU = Ludong University). The photodetector will move horizontally and vertically to collect the current for each pixel, and send the current corresponding to all positions to the computer for counting (pixel array is 4 × 4). Fig. 5(b) shows the images based on current value. The LDU image can be clearly observed, indicating that the photodetectors are suitable for UV light image sensing applications.

Conclusions
In conclusion, four different growth techniques including PLD, VTE, LACVD and SC were successfully applied to the growth of CsCu2I3 thin films. The results of characterization and analysis show that the CsCu2I3 films prepared by the four methods have high quality and excellent photoelectric properties. Based on this, p-CsCu2I3/n-GaN heterojunction photodetectors were constructed. The photodetector prepared by VTE shows high-responsivity (42 mA W−1) and high-detectivity (1.42 × 1011 Jones). Furthermore, UV imaging applications were presented by utilizing the proposed photodetector as a sensing pixel. This work provides an important reference for Cu-based perovskite materials to prepare high-performance UV photodetectors and image sensors by different growth techniques.
