    , Accepted 27th March 2023First published on 31st March 2023AbstractIn addition to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs), long-term stability is a critical requirement. In this study, a crosslinkable PM6-based polymer donor, PM6-X30, was developed by introducing photocrosslinkable side chains into the PM6 polymer backbone. The new PM6-X30 retained the fundamental properties of the high-performance PM6 backbone. The crosslinking reaction was induced under the mild condition of UV 365 nm irradiation for 10 min, forming a stable polymer network to lock the internal morphology of the active layer. The PSC fabricated with the crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer exhibited a high PCE of 12.33%. Subsequently, this device sustained more than 80% of its original PCE after thermal aging at 80 °C for 180 min, while the non-crosslinked device and the reference device based on PM6-X0 could only retain 27.7 and 42.9% of their PCE, respectively, under the same aging conditions. This work demonstrates a promising strategy for boosting the long-term stability of high-performance PSCs, even at a slight sacrifice of the maximum PCE.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers because of their unique material design and properties, including cost-effectiveness, solution processability, lightweight, and flexibility. Especially, with the recent development of new donor, acceptor and buffer layer materials1–7 as well as device fabrication techniques,8–10 power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 20% have been achieved for PSCs,11–13 demonstrating their great potential as a sustainable and efficient system for harnessing solar energy. However, to truly commercialize PSCs for outdoor and indoor use, long-term stability issues with high PCE must be seriously addressed.14–16
Various studies have been conducted to solve this problem. For example, the penetration of oxygen or moisture from the outside can be easily solved with encapsulation technology.17–21 The inverted structure can also be employed to prevent the chemical degradation of indium tin oxide (ITO) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), or the oxidation process of low-work-function metal electrodes.22–24 However, intrinsic factors such as photo-degradation and thermal deterioration that occur during device operation are related to the material properties of the active layer.25,26 To date, most PSCs have been fabricated with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer consisting of a physical mixture of donor and acceptor materials. This thermodynamically unfavorable mixing is a major cause of phase separation between the two materials, morphological changes in the blend film, and reduction of device efficiency over time.27,28 To overcome this problem, applying crosslinkable materials to “freeze” the morphology of the active layer is an attractive strategy.29,30
Crosslinking preserves the internal morphology of the active layer by stabilizing the initial morphology and limiting the aggregation and phase separation between the physically blended donor and acceptor materials in BHJ systems. After the active layer is treated to achieve the desired morphology by thermal or solvent vapor annealing, photo- or thermal crosslinking reactions are performed to immobilize the microstructure of the BHJ structure and prevent undesirable morphological changes over time. Thus, the long-term stability and durability of the active layer can be preserved even under mechanical or thermal stress.31–33
For PSC fabrication, a wide variety of crosslinkable functional groups have been successfully incorporated into electron donors, acceptors, or small molecule additives, including vinyl, oxetane, bromo, and azide groups, which can be activated either by thermal annealing or UV exposure.34 Compared with thermal crosslinking, the utilization of a photocrosslinkable system is a rather versatile and clean method because these crosslinking reactions can be performed without interfering with the thermal post-treatment step of the active layer. However, the crosslinking reaction of functional groups such as ω-bromo alkyl, azide, coumarin, or uracil typically undergoes under excitation energy in the deep UV range (<350 nm).35–37 Prolonged irradiation under such harsh conditions can induce the crosslinking reaction, accompanied by the degradation and photobleaching of organic materials. Conversely, in the case of oxetane or acrylate, since a photoinitiator is required, the manufacturing process becomes complicated and undesirable charge traps may occur in the active layer.38,39
Considering these problems, penta-1,4-diene could probably be a good option. Similar to other non-conjugated α,ω-dienes, the crosslinking process of this group is very selective, with a mechanism that includes controlled sequential intra-inter-molecular polymerization.40,41 During propagation, the molecule undergoes an intramolecular radical cyclization process, followed by intermolecular copolymerization, resulting in cyclopolymers of varying ring sizes. To improve both the crosslinking reactivity and intramolecular cyclization tendency, electron-withdrawing groups such as esters can be inserted near the unsaturated double-bond.42 The cyclopolymerization of α,ω-dienes can also yield a rigid backbone with low shrinkage-stress,43 which is particularly important to prevent the decrease in free volume after the crosslinking process. In the absence of an initiator, crosslinking of 1,4-diene occurs in a relatively short time under UV 254 nm irradiation.44 However, under low energy (λ > 300 nm) UV irradiation, crosslinking reaction can also be induced at room temperature using a photoinitiator or at high temperatures without an initiator.45,46
Recently, a few studies have successfully employed a crosslinking strategy to prolong the lifetime of PM6:Y6 PSCs. For example, several studies have induced a crosslinking reaction in the PM6:Y6 active layer by adding a crosslinkable component to the blend.47–49 Meanwhile, Wang et al. used another approach by directly introducing a third monomer to the polymer backbone to create a crosslinkable terpolymer.50 However, such changes in the polymer backbone led to a new polymer with large differences in the fundamental properties compared to the PM6 polymer. Therefore, introducing a crosslinking group on the side chain of the same polymer backbone may help retaining the original polymer properties.
Herein, non-conjugated penta-1,4-diene photocrosslinkable groups were incorporated into the side chains of the benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) monomer via a simple Steglich esterification reaction, yielding a new monomer, BDD-diene. A terpolymer donor, PM6-X30, was synthesized using BDD and BDD-diene as acceptor monomers with fluorinated benzodithiophene (BDT-2F) as the donor monomer. With an identical backbone, the crosslinkable polymer PM6-X30 exhibited electrochemical and optical properties similar to the PM6-X0 polymer without crosslinking groups.
After 10 min of exposure to 365 nm UV light, a photocrosslinking reaction between the PM6-X30 polymer chains occurred without the addition of any initiators, resulting in the formation of an insoluble film with a frozen morphology. Using 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′] thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6-BO) as the acceptor, the crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO-based PSCs possess a decent PCE of 12.33%, which is among the best results for PSC devices bearing crosslinked active layer. Notably, the 3D interpenetrating network between the donor polymers firmly anchored by the photocrosslinking reaction can prevent severe aggregation and crystallization of the donor and acceptor phases under thermal stress (Fig. 1). Consequently, PSCs with the crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer exhibited significantly enhanced stability compared with those based on PM6-X0:Y6-BO and non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO, maintaining over 80% of the initial PCE value after 180 min of thermal aging at 80 °C. This work presents a simple but effective strategy to design crosslinkable materials for PSCs to attain both a high PCE and long-term stability for future practical applications.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The design and synthesis of the monomer BDD-diene and photocrosslinkable polymer donor PM6-X30 are shown in Fig. S1 and S2.† The details of the synthesis and structural analysis are provided in the ESI.† Briefly, compound 3 was synthesized from thiophene following the procedure published in previous reports.51 Compound 4 was obtained through esterification of compound 3 in the presence of potassium acetate. The synthesis of compound 7 from compounds 2 and 4 was similar to that of the reported synthesis route of the monomer BDD.52 The deprotection of the acetate group of compound 7 by refluxing with HCl yielded compound 8, which then underwent Steglich esterification with compound 9 to obtain the monomer BDD-diene. The random terpolymer PM6-X30 was synthesized via the Still coupling reaction between the three monomers BDT-2F, BDD, and BDD-diene, using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. After the reaction, the crude product was purified by Soxhlet extraction, the chloroform (CF) fraction was precipitated in methanol, and the pure photocrosslinkable PM6-X30 polymer was collected as the final product.
The structures of intermediate compounds 4–8 and the monomer BDD-diene were confirmed from their nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR and 13C NMR), mass spectra (MS), and elemental analysis (EA) data (Fig. S3–S18†). The synthesized PM6-X30 has good solubility in common halogenated solvents such as CF, chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which enables device fabrication via solution processing. The chemical structures and the presence of diene functional groups in PM6-X30 were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S19 and S20†). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) values of the polymers PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were 44.7 kDa/3.24 and 11.3 kDa/1.74, respectively (Fig. S21 and S22†). The BDD-diene monomer has a bulky side chain moiety; therefore, PM6-X30 is considered to have a lower molecular weight than PM6-X0. EA was used to determine the composition of the crosslinkable monomer units in PM6-X30. According to the obtained data, the value of x is consistent with the initial feeding ratio (x = 0.3).
The thermal behaviors of PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are displayed in Fig. S23.† For PM6-X30, first temperature of minor mass loss occurred from 200 to 420 °C with a mass loss percentage (% mloss) of ∼7.1%. Because the sole structural difference between PM6-X30 and PM6-X0 is the crosslinkable side chains, which theoretically contribute to 8.3% of the total mass of the polymer, this mass loss at approximately 250 °C can be attributed to the thermal decomposition of the ester groups in the side chain of PM6-X30. Above 420 °C, the main decomposition process occurred for both polymers, proving similar thermal behavior of their backbones. Thus, both the polymers PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 are stable under the thermal annealing post-treatment of the active layers of the devices. However, the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the two polymers were not clearly observed in our temperature range, as shown in Fig. S23b.†
2.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The optical/photophysical properties of the two polymer donors (i.e., PM6-X0 and PM6-X30) and the small molecule acceptor, Y6-BO, are shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed pertinent data are outlined in Table 1. As expected, modifications of the side chains did not alter the fundamental properties of the resulting polymer, and PM6-X30 maintained the intrinsic properties of the PM6-X0 backbone. In the solution state, both polymers exhibited strong absorption from 500 to 650 nm (Fig. S24a†) with the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone at around 350 nm.53 While PM6-X0 only exhibited an absorption maximum at 615 nm and a shoulder at 580 nm, two absorption peaks at 611 and 572 nm corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) were observed in the spectra of PM6-X30.54–56

However, in the film state (Fig. 2a), these two polymers exhibited similar absorption spectra, with maximum peaks at 578 and 575 nm for PM6-X0 and PM6-X30, respectively. PM6-X30 has a cut-off wavelength of 673 nm, corresponding to a medium optical bandgap of 1.84 eV. The difference in the shoulder at ∼615 nm between the two polymer donors could be attributed to the difference in the molecular packing due to the side chain modification and molecular weight. Importantly, the absorption spectrum of acceptor Y6-BO showed good complementarity with those of polymer donors PM6-X0 and PM6-X30, which is essential for obtaining a broad absorption active layer for efficient sunlight photon harvesting.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymer donors PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 in the CF solution and film states are shown in Fig. S24b† and 2b, respectively. In the solution state, the emission maxima were at 664 and 659 nm for PM6-X0 and PM6-X30, respectively. The PL spectra of the PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 films demonstrated a slight red-shift behavior compared to the solution state and exhibited emission peaks at 672 and 662 nm, respectively. The PL spectra of the blend films with these polymer donors and Y6-BO were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 575 nm (Fig. 2b). Obvious emission quenching behavior was observed in both samples, with complete disappearance of the emission signals of the polymer donors. This proves the good mixing behavior and strong intermolecular interaction, which is favorable for efficient charge transfer between the donors and acceptor.
The electrochemical properties of the active materials were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S24c†). The polymer donor PM6-X30 with photocrosslinkable side chains did not show significantly different highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels compared with the reference non-crosslinkable polymer PM6-X0. Because the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor is an important factor in determining the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of a PSC, it can be expected that such side-chain engineering would not affect the Voc value of the corresponding device. From the CV results, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 were −5.53/−3.71 and −5.50/−3.66, respectively (Fig. 2c and Table 1).
2.3 Crosslinking behavior of PM6-X0 and PM6-X30
To investigate the crosslinking ability of the polymer PM6-X30, the solubility of the polymer films under different post-treatments was examined. PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 in the CF solution were spin-coated on a glass substrate. UV-Vis absorption spectra of the films before and after rinsing with CF for 60 s were recorded. The degree of crosslinking was evaluated using the maximum absorbance of each polymer.
Previous studies have confirmed that vinyl-group-containing polymers can undergo crosslinking reactions under thermal annealing at 150 °C.50,57 Because the 1,4-diene group has similar structure to the vinyl group, the thermal crosslinking ability at 150 °C was first tested, and the results are shown in Fig. S25a.† Without the addition of the initiator, clear evidence of the crosslinking reaction is observed after 1 h of annealing. Approximately 35% of initial absorbance is retained after rinsing with CF. The maximum degree of crosslinking is obtained after 2 h of thermal annealing with almost unchanged absorbance even after rinsing with CF. Even though those results provide good evidence for the thermal crosslinking ability of the polymer PM6-X30, such high temperature and long annealing time can cause severe degradation and damage to the active layer.
To find a mild condition for effectively triggering the crosslinking reaction of the 1,4-diene group, UV irradiation was employed. Although many studies have reported the crosslinking reaction of dienes under deep UV light (λ = 254 nm)34 following the proposed mechanism in Fig. S26,† such a high photon energy can cause photobleaching of the conjugated moiety placed in conjugated organic materials. Thus, in this work, a mild condition with 365 nm UV light (I = 2.8 mW cm−2) was used for conducting the photocrosslinking reaction (Fig. S25b†). However, the UV irradiation at room temperature (25 °C) has proven unsuccessful, with no residue of the polymer film after rinsing with CF. When the temperature was raised to near the polymer Tg (120–130 °C),58 the crosslinking reactions between pentadienes became feasible, and the insoluble portion increased when the annealing temperature increased. We optimized the temperature by UV irradiation in various temperature ranges to induce an effective crosslinking reaction in the thin-film sample. After 10 min UV irradiation at 120 °C, more than 80% of the initial absorbance was retained after rinsing with CF.
As thermal crosslinking of the PM6-X30 polymer was observed, the effect of UV irradiation was confirmed again using a PM6-X30 polymer film, by covering half of the film with aluminum foil to block the UV light. Under the same conditions, i.e. UV illumination at 120 °C for 10 min, the unexposed-half of the film was completely washed out, while the exposed-half was insoluble and remained on the substrate (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, the PM6-X0 polymer film, after UV-irradiated at 120 °C, remained very soluble and could be removed easily by CF rinsing (Fig. 3a). This also supports the fact that the crosslinking reaction occurs in the internal structure of PM6-X30.

To explore the effect of Y6-BO on the crosslinkability of PM6-X30, a solubility test of the PM6-X30:Y6-BO blend film was performed (Fig. S25c†). Although the density of crosslinkable functional group decreased owing to the addition of the acceptor Y6-BO, the PM6-X30:Y6-BO blend film still maintained 66.8% of the initial absorbance after UV irradiation at 120 °C. This result is a confirmatory proof of the efficient crosslinking ability of the PM6-X30 based blend film, and it is possible to consider introducing an active layer with a network structure into the PSC.
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of the PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 films before and after UV irradiation was performed to examine the photocrosslinking reaction of the 1,4-diene group (Fig. 3c). The FT-IR spectra of penta-1,4-diene-3-ol (Sigma-Aldrich, Fig. S27†) was used as a reference. The characteristic vibrational band of unsaturated carbons is clearly observed in the spectra of penta-1,4-diene-3-ol, with a CC stretching band at 1640 cm−1 and CC–H bending at 1000–900 cm−1. However, in the FT-IR spectra of both PM6-X0 and PM6-X30, the CC stretching band at 1640 cm−1 overlaps with other strong CC signals of the conjugated polymer backbone. Thus, the characteristic band assigned to CC–H bending was selected to investigate the photocrosslinking of PM6-X30. The as-cast PM6-X30 film exhibits a peak at 1000 cm−1, which is absent in the FT-IR spectrum of PM6-X0. After UV irradiation, the disappearance of this characteristic band of the PM6-X30 film undoubtedly proves that a reaction occurred between the 1,4-diene groups.
Although the introduction of crosslinkable side chain moieties did not affect the properties of the conjugated backbone, as demonstrated by the similarities in the absorption spectra and frontier molecular orbitals of PM6-X0 and PM6-X30, the bulkiness of the 1,4-diene functional group can hinder molecular packing. This can alter the crystallinity of the polymers and chain orientation. To gain further insight into the effects of the crosslinking process on the interchain packing behavior of PM6-X30, grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (GIWAXS) was employed (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  GIWAXS data of the as-cast PM6-X30, annealed PM6-X30 and UV-irradiated PM6-X30 films: (a) 2D diffraction pattern, (b) OOP and IP line-cut profiles. 
The diene-functionalized PM6-X30 film exhibits the position of the diffraction peaks, with a (100) peak at qxy = 0.29 Å−1 and a (010) peak at qz = 1.69 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions, respectively, indicating that PM6-X30 also maintains a preferable face-on chain orientation. This phenomenon is similar to the characteristics of PM6-X0 reported in literatures.59,60 After thermal annealing the PM6-X30 film at 120 °C for 10 min, the intensity of the IP (100) and OOP (010) diffraction peaks increased, which indicates the increase in the crystallinity. In particular, when the crosslinking reaction was induced by UV irradiation, the GIWAXS pattern of PM6-X30 did not change in either peak position or intensity. The d-spacing values were also maintained after the crosslinking reaction, with d(010) ≈ 3.63 Å and d(100) ≈ 21.47 Å for both annealed and crosslinked PM6-X30 films. It is expected that the photocrosslinking process does not significantly hamper the film formation and crystalline structure of PM6-X30.
2.4 Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic properties of blend films of the two polymer donors with Y6-BO were investigated under AM 1.5G illumination. The details of the PSC device fabrication are provided in the ESI. PEDOT:PSS was employed as the hole transport layer (HTL) and 2,9-bis(3-((3-(dimethylamino)propyl)amino)propyl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone (PDINN) as the electron transport layer (ETL). PSC devices were constructed using the conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag. All the active layers were spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution (22 mg mL−1) with 0.5% v/v 1-chloronaphthalene as the additive, and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The photocrosslinking process of the PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer was realized by UV (λ = 365 nm, I = 2.8 mW cm−2) irradiated for another 10 min at 120 °C.
To investigate the effect of photocrosslinking on device performance and stability, PSCs were fabricated using non-crosslinked and UV-irradiated films of PM6-X30:Y6-BO as an active layer. In addition, a control device was manufactured using the PM6-X0:Y6-BO blend film to compare device performance. The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are displayed in Fig. 5. The related photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are listed in Table 2.

The PSC devices based on the non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer displayed a Voc of 0.82 V and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.78 mA cm−2. Those results are comparable to the data of the PSCs based on PM6-X0:Y6-BO with Voc and Jsc values of 0.83 V and 22.91 mA cm−2, respectively. This is in good agreement with the aforementioned data on the energy level and absorption spectrum of these polymer donors. The devices based on PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 exhibit similar EQE curves, and comparable photon collection can be observed. In brief, the device with the non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer demonstrated a PCE of 12.83%, slightly lower than the PM6-X0:Y6-BO device having a PCE of 14.26%.
PSC containing PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer exposed to UV light at 120 °C displayed a Voc of 0.82 V, Jsc of 22.87 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.65 and PCE of 12.33%. This is considered to be an excellent device performance that has not been previously reported for PSC containing a crosslinked active layer. The histogram of PCE values is illustrated in Fig. S28.† The calculated Jsc value based on the EQE curve was 22.14 mA cm−2 for the PSC bearing the crosslinked active layer made with PM6-X30:Y6-BO, which is in excellent agreement with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curve.
2.5 Exciton dissociation and charge recombination
Exciton generation and charge recombination in the fabricated PSCs were evaluated by studying the influence of the input light intensity (Plight) on the Jsc and Voc values (Fig. S29a and b†). The dependence of Jsc on Plight can be estimated using the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α = 1 for an ideal device.61,62 The α values calculated by fitting Jsc against Plight on a logarithmic scale for the PM6-X0, PM6-X30, and crosslinked PM6-X30 devices were 0.985, 0.972, and 0.962, respectively. These values are very close to unity, indicating a low degree of bimolecular combination in the PSC devices.
The plot of the dependence of Voc on Plight was analyzed to further evaluate recombination in the PSCs. In general, Voc = εkTln(Plight)/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the unit charge.63 The slope of Voc–Plight semilogarithmic lines were determined to be 1.27, 1.51, and 1.61 kT/q for the PM6-X0, PM6-X30, and crosslinked PM6-X30 based PSCs, respectively. Those values are close to kT/q, suggesting that monomolecular and trap-assisted recombination occurred to a limited extent in the corresponding active layer. The charge extraction efficiency of the PSCs was studied by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. S29c†). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection probability (Pcoll) for the PM6-X0, PM6-X30, and crosslinked PM6-X30 devices were calculated to be 97.3%/89.5%, 96.2%/83.7%, and 97.0%/75.9%, respectively. These high values suggest that charge dissociation and collection are effective for PSCs. These combined results confirm that the introduction of crosslinkable side chains into the new donor polymer structure and crosslinking of the active layer by UV irradiation treatment did not interfere with PSC fabrication and performance, and the desirable properties of the PM6 polymer backbone were well preserved.
2.6 Thermal stability of PSC performance
In addition to the PCE value, increasing the stability of the device performance was the main purpose of designing the functionalized polymer PM6-X30. PSCs were fabricated using PM6-X0:Y6-BO, PM6-X30:Y6-BO, and UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO as an active layer to reveal the crosslinking effect of PM6-X30 on the thermal stability of the device. Without encapsulation, changes in PCE was observed at 80 °C under ambient conditions.
The J–V curves of the PSCs obtained during 180 min of thermal aging and the normalized relevant photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 6.

Normalized photovoltaic parameters (d) PCE, (e) Voc, (f) Jsc, and (g) FF of the PSCs based on PM6-X0:Y6-BO, PM6-X30:Y6-BO, and UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO after thermal aging at 80 °C in ambient conditions for 180 min. 
In particular, the UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO based device demonstrated significantly improved stability compared to the two control devices, retaining 81.2% of the initial PCE after 180 min of thermal aging. Meanwhile, the PCEs of PSCs based on non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO and PM6-X0:Y6-BO dropped sharply to 38.2 and 46.4% of their initial values, respectively (Fig. 6d). The excellent stability of the UV-irradiated PM6-X30-based PSCs was further confirmed by the stable photovoltaic parameters. More than 90% of the initial Voc, Jsc, and FF values were maintained under thermal stress (Fig. 6e–g). However, after thermal aging, a large increase in the series resistance (Rs) and decrease in the shunt resistance (Rsh) (Fig. S31†) of the non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO and PM6-X0:Y6-BO-based devices resulted in a significant drop in their FF compared to that of the PSC based on UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO (Fig. 6g). Because these parameters, that is, FF, Rs, Rsh, are strongly dependent on the active layer morphology and phase formation, the donor–acceptor phase separation and severe aggregation of the Y6-BO small molecules could be the main cause of the morphological degradation in these cases.64 In addition, numerous defects and traps caused by such severe phase separation assisted the recombination of charge carriers and decelerated the charge transport through the active layer, leading to a decrease in Jsc of the corresponding devices. Although changes in donor–acceptor interfaces also impact the Voc values,65,66 this parameter was the least variable in this work because it is also associated with the frontier molecular orbitals of the donor and acceptor materials.
To elucidate the role of crosslinking on the morphological stability of the active layer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to explore the changes in surface morphology under thermal stress. The surface roughness (root mean square roughness, Rq), height mages, and surface line profiles of the active layer films before and after thermal aging at 80 °C for 180 min are shown in Fig. 7. Blend films based on both PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 had uniform surfaces with well-defined nanofibril interpenetrating networks. This internal morphology has a large interfacial area between the donor and acceptor, favoring charge dissociation within the active layer of the PSC and leading to a high PCE. Owing to the higher crystallinity of PM6-X0, the PM6-X0:Y6-BO film exhibited much higher Rq (1.192 nm) than the PM6-X30:Y6-BO blend film (Rq = 0.694 nm). The UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO film maintained a similar morphology with a slight increase in surface roughness compared with the non-crosslinked PM6-X0:Y6-BO film because of the extended annealing time. This result confirms that the crosslinking process did not affect the morphology and domain size of the bulk heterojunction active layer composed of the donor and acceptor.

Significant changes in surface roughness can be observed for the PM6-X0:Y6-BO and non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO blend films after thermal aging, with an increase in Rq value of approximately 30%. A clear phase evolution with large separations can also be observed, especially in the line-cut profile of the PM6-X30:Y6-BO film. Such a morphological change in the active layer may be a major cause of the deterioration in the FF, Jsc, and overall PCE values of the device. In contrast, the surface roughness and morphology of the UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO blend film hardly changed after thermal aging, indicating that it was inert against thermal stress.
The GIWAXS data for the blend films, which are shown in Fig. S32,† also provides good evidence of the stability of the UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO film. Before annealing, the as-cast PM6-X30:Y6-BO film exhibited similar face-on favorable packing behavior as the pristine polymer film, with a clear (100) peak at qxy = 0.29 Å−1, d(100) = 3.63 Å in the IP direction, and a (010) peak at qz = 1.71 Å−1, d(010) ≈ 21.7 Å in the OOP direction. After thermal aging, in addition to the characteristic peaks of PM6-X30, multiple sharp diffraction peaks of Y6-BO were observed, indicating severe crystallization of the small-molecule acceptor. However, the UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO film displayed very low-intensity diffraction peaks of Y6-BO, suggesting that the acceptor molecules were trapped in the crosslinked polymer network and could not aggregate to form large crystals. Moreover, the d-spacing of UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO film were also well maintained, with d(100) = 21.31 Å and d(010) = 3.60 Å.
The effects of thermal aging on the optical absorption and photoluminescence properties of the polymer and blend films were also investigated. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the pristine polymers are shown in Fig. S33.† After thermal aging for 180 min at 80 °C, the spectra of PM6-X0 and PM6-X30 are red-shifted, indicating a rearrangement in the polymer packing. The degree of shift in PM6-X0 is slightly higher than that in non-crosslinked PM6-X30, which may be due to the higher crystallinity of PM6-X0.
Changes in the PL spectra of the PM6-X0 and non-crosslinked PM6-X30 films coincided with the trends of the UV-Vis absorption spectra, and a clear red shift was observed after 180 min of thermal aging (Fig. 8a–c). The broadening and reduced intensity of these spectra suggest that polymer chain aggregates, undesired defects, and charge traps may form.67–69

In addition, the thermal aging process allowed spatial reorganization of the polymer chains, leading to denser packing and enhanced interchain interactions, resulting in a decrease in the PL intensity. In contrast, the UV-irradiated PM6-X30 film showed no significant change in the absorption and PL spectra after thermal aging, indicating superior thermal stability compared to the non-crosslinked neat film.
For better understanding, the UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra of the polymer blend films with Y6-BO before and after aging at 80 °C were recorded (Fig. 8d–f and S34†). After thermal aging, an increase in intensity and an apparent red shift in the spectra of PM6-X0:Y6-BO and non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO blend films were observed at 700–900 nm. These apparent changes in the spectra corresponding to the absorption range of Y6-BO suggest a strong molecular aggregation of the acceptor upon thermal aging. Conversely, the excellent overlap between the absorption spectra and no spectral shift behavior of UV-irradiated PM6-X30:Y6-BO confirmed the stabilization effect of the internal structure by the crosslinking reaction. The PL spectra of the blend films exhibited a similar trend after thermal aging. However, because of the PL quenching, the spectra of the blend films were difficult to compare because of their low emission intensity.
According to the AFM images, GIWAXS, absorption, and PL spectroscopy results, it can be suggested that the main degradation of the active layer in this study is due to the aggregation and crystallization of the donor and acceptor phases. These changes led to the formation of rough surfaces and the accumulation of structural defects, which ultimately contributed to significant losses in Jsc and FF70 of the devices based on PM6-X0 and non-crosslinked PM6-X30. In addition, rearrangement of the conjugated backbone can change the bandgap of the polymer and reduce the difference between the HOMO of the donor polymers and the LUMO of Y6-BO.71,72 This explains the large reduction in the Voc value of the PSCs based on PM6-X0 and non-crosslinked PM6-X30, in contrast to the relatively constant Voc of the PSCs based on UV-irradiated PM6-X30.
3. Conclusions
A new photocrosslinkable polymer donor, PM6-X30, with a 1,4-diene functional group in the side chain, was successfully synthesized. PM6-X30 exhibited photophysical and electrochemical properties similar to those of the well-known reference polymer PM6-X0, with suitable HOMO/LUMO levels for the acceptor Y6-BO. Consequently, a high PCE of 12.33% was achieved with crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO based PSCs. Importantly, the morphology of the PM6-X30:Y6-BO active layer can form a semi-interpenetrating network by crosslinking under UV irradiation, preventing serious donor and acceptor aggregation and phase separation under thermal stress.
In particular, PSC-based devices with crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO preserved more than 80% of their initial PCE values after undergoing thermal aging at 80 °C for 180 min under ambient conditions. The stability of the PCE value was significantly improved compared to that of PSCs based on PM6-X0:Y6-BO and non-crosslinked PM6-X30:Y6-BO. These results suggest an efficient strategy for fabricating high-performance, high-stability PSCs for future practical applications.
