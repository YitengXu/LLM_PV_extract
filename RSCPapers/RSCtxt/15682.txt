    , Accepted 20th March 2017First published on 21st March 2017AbstractLadder-type dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) cores, which possess highly extended π-conjugated backbones and versatile modular structures for derivatization, were widely used to develop high-performance p-type polymeric semiconductors. However, an n-type DTCC-based organic semiconductor has not been reported to date. In this study, the first DTCC-based n-type organic semiconductor (DTCC–IC) with a well-defined A–D–A backbone was designed, synthesized, and characterized, in which a DTCC derivative substituted by four p-octyloxyphenyl groups was used as the electron-donating core and two strongly electron-withdrawing 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one moieties were used as the terminal acceptors. It was found that DTCC–IC has strong light-capturing ability in the range of 500–720 nm and exhibits an impressively high molar absorption coefficient of 2.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 669 nm owing to effective intramolecular charge transfer and a strong D–A effect. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTCC–IC are −5.50 and −3.87 eV, respectively. More importantly, a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined by the space-charge-limited current method; this electron mobility can be comparable to that of fullerene derivative acceptors (μe ∼ 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). To investigate its application potential in non-fullerene solar cells, we fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) by blending a DTCC–IC acceptor with a PTB7-Th donor under various conditions. The results suggest that the optimized device exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6% and a rational high VOC of 0.95 V. These findings demonstrate that the ladder-type DTCC core is a promising building block for the development of high-mobility n-type organic semiconductors for OSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs), as promising candidates for renewable energy conversion devices, have gained significant attention owing to their advantages, which include low cost, mechanical flexibility, and light weight.1–5 Due to great efforts in innovative material design and device optimization, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% have recently been achieved for several single-junction fullerene OSCs.6–12 However, further enhancements in the PCEs of fullerene-based OSCs might represent a great challenge in view of the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene derivative acceptors, including weak light-capturing ability in the visible-light region, difficulties in the synthesis and purification procedures, and a strong tendency to molecular aggregation. To our satisfaction, non-fullerene acceptors have recently been demonstrated to be promising alternatives to fullerene derivative acceptors4,5 because they have great flexibility in synthesis for dealing with the abovementioned disadvantages of fullerene acceptors. Based on the strongly electron-deficient building blocks such as B–N complexes,13–16 perylene diimide,17–19 naphthalene diimide,20–24 and naphthodithiophene diimide moieties,25,26 a great number of n-type polymeric semiconductors were successfully prepared and applied in highly efficient non-fullerene OSCs. In addition, numerous aromatic diimide/imide-based n-type organic semiconductors (n-OSs),27–35 as well as n-OSs with a well-defined A–D–A (acceptor–donor–acceptor) backbone,4,5,36–46 have also been widely investigated as electron acceptors in non-fullerene OSCs.
Among reported non-fullerene acceptors, n-OSs with A–D–A backbone configurations have been demonstrated to be the most successful to date. Since Zhan et al. reported fused-ring-based A–D–A n-OSs (ITIC),36 great interest has been excited in the investigation of ITIC and its A–D–A derivatives as electron acceptors in non-fullerene OSCs because of their great advantages4,5,36–46 such as a tunable HOMO/LUMO energy-level structure, strong light-capturing ability from 500 to 800 nm, and low-cost synthesis and purification, as well as appropriate aggregation and crystallinity, etc. Encouragingly, non-fullerene OSCs fabricated from ITIC derivatives as acceptors and conjugated polymers as donors exhibited impressive PCEs of above 10%,4,36–50 which were even higher than those of their fullerene-based counterparts. As far as molecular design is concerned, current synthesis strategies for ideal n-OSs with A–D–A structures mainly concentrate on the modulation of π-conjugated aromatic cores,46–48 π-bridges,49,50 and terminal groups,37,38,51 as well as solubilizing side-chain substituents.42 Among these, the modulation of π-conjugated aromatic cores is regarded as the most versatile method for developing a large number of fascinating n-OSs with A–D–A structures. Therefore, the further development of novel aromatic cores for n-OSs with A–D–A structures is worthy of study.
Dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC), as a well-known ladder-type conjugated framework, has been utilized to develop p-type polymeric semiconductors for fullerene-based OSCs and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) (Fig. 1)52–55 owing to its strong electron-donating ability, highly coplanar backbone, and versatile modular structure for the facile synthesis of polycyclic ring analogs. It has been widely demonstrated that the use of this ladder-type conjugated framework in organic/polymeric semiconductors can not only facilitate the crystallization and organization of thin films but can also improve intra- or intermolecular interactions, which would be helpful for carrier transport and PCEs.56 On the basis of ladder-type DTCC derivative donors, Wu et al. first reported the design, synthesis, and photovoltaic properties of p-type DTCC-based polymeric semiconductors52 and then developed a set of DTCC-like building blocks for constructing p-type polymeric semiconductors with hole mobilities of 0.001–0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1.54 Traditionally, these have been used as electron donors in fullerene OSCs and afford relatively high photovoltaic performance, with PCEs of 3.7–4.6% (Fig. 1).52,53,55 Nevertheless, no n-type DTCC-based organic semiconductor has been reported to date that can be used in non-fullerene OSCs. In view of their great advantages mentioned above, it is believed that by incorporating two strongly electron-deficient terminal groups into the backbone of the DTCC unit A–D–A-type DTCC-based organic semiconductors might be transformed into electron-accepting n-OSs.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures and device performance of p-type DTCC-based polymeric semiconductors, the p-type polymeric semiconductor PTB7-Th, and DTCC-based n-type OS (DTCC–IC). 
On the basis of the strategy mentioned above, we first reported the design and synthesis of a novel n-OS with an A–D–A structure bearing a ladder-type DTCC core, i.e., DTCC–IC (Fig. 1), in which DTCC was used as an electron-donating building block; two strongly electron-deficient 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one (IC) moieties were used as the terminal acceptors; and four p-octyloxyphenyl side chains were used as solubilizing groups. Furthermore, we systematically studied the thermal and optical properties, energy-level structure, carrier mobility, photovoltaic performance, and film morphology of the DTCC–IC acceptor. It was found that the DTCC–IC acceptor had a strong, broad absorption band and appropriate HOMO/LUMO energy levels, as well as a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, so that it could match other components well to fabricate non-fullerene OSCs. With the use of the reported PTB7-Th as a polymeric donor and DTCC–IC as an acceptor, non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated successfully. The best-performing device achieved the highest PCE value of 6%. It should be mentioned that this result is the best reported to date for OSC devices fabricated from DTCC-based organic/polymeric semiconductors.
Experimental section
Measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of samples were recorded with a Bruker Avance 400 instrument (400 MHz) using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was performed using a Bruker Autoflex III instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra in a chloroform solution and a thin film coated onto quartz glass were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. The energy-level structures of samples were determined by three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660A, Chenhua, Shanghai). The working electrode was a platinum stick coated with a layer of a thin film of the sample. Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (Ag in 0.01 mol L−1 KCl) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as an internal standard. The electrolyte was an anhydrous N2-saturated acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC) was performed using a TA DSCQ10 instrument at heating and cooling rates of 10 °C min−1 under an inert N2 atmosphere. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out with a Bruker Multi-Mode 8 microscope in tapping mode. Detailed space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements can be found in our previous work.27
General procedures for fabrication of non-fullerene OSCs
OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The cleaning of ITO and the preparation of PEDOT:PSS were reported in our previous work.27 The PTB7-Th donor and DTCC–IC acceptor were co-dissolved in chloroform with different weight ratios and CN concentrations. The overall concentration of PTB7-Th was fixed at 6.5 mg mL−1. The blend solution was spin-cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s under a nitrogen atmosphere and were then treated by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, a 20 nm Ca layer and a 100 nm Al layer were sequentially deposited onto the active layer at a vacuum pressure of ∼5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the devices was 4.50 mm−2. The OSCs measurements can also be found in our previous work.27 External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using a QEX10 solar cell IPCE measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc.).

Synthesis of DTCC
To a stirred solution of 1-bromo-4-(octyloxy)benzene (4.85 g, 17 mmol) in dry THF (100 mL) was added dropwise a 2.5 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexane (6 mL, 15 mmol) at −78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. After being stirred at −78 °C for 2 h, the resulting solution was warmed to −40 °C. Then, compound 2 (1.0 g, 1.7 mmol) in dry THF (15 mL) was added to the mixture by syringe. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at −40 °C and then refluxed at 70 °C overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The collected organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, a crude brown product (3) was obtained and then used in the next step without further purification. To a stirred solution of compound 3 in 120 mL acetic acid was added dropwise 1.0 mL concentrated H2SO4. The reaction mixture was stirred at 85 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The collected organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixed solvent as the eluent (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, v/v = 20/1) to give a pale yellow solid (1.59 g, 73%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.80 (s, 2H), 7.37 (s, 2H), 7.27–7.29 (d, 2H), 7.16–7.19 (d, 8H), 6.99–7.01 (d, 2H), 6.73–6.75 (d, 8H), 4.30–4.34 (t, 2H), 3.86–3.89 (t, 8H), 1.90–1.94 (m, 2H), 1.69–1.75 (m, 12H), 1.26–1.47 (m, 46H), 0.85–0.88 (m, 15H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 157.87, 156.93, 145.84, 141.45, 140.67, 137.66, 135.04, 129.04, 127.53, 123.17, 121.28, 117.66, 114.16, 99.43, 67.93, 61.53, 43.43, 31.91, 31.85, 29.47, 29.39, 29.36, 29.26, 27.38, 26.11, 22.68, 14.13; MALDI-TOF-MS m/z: M+, found 1284.368.
Synthesis of DTCC–CHO
To a dry 100 mL three-necked round-bottom flask, DTCC (1.28 g, 1 mmol) and 30 mL N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) were added under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was cooled to 0 °C and stirred while 1.5 mL phosphoryl chloride was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature and then stirred for 12 h at 100 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 20 mL of 1 M NaOH solution and extracted with dichloromethane. The crude product was purified on a silica gel column using a mixed solvent as the eluent (petroleum ether/dichloromethane, v/v = 1/1) to give a light yellow solid (0.91 g, 68%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 9.87 (s, 2H), 7.90 (s, 2H), 7.68 (s, 2H), 7.55 (s, 2H), 7.18–7.20 (d, 8H), 6.78–6.81 (d, 8H), 4.39 (t, 2H), 3.90–3.93 (t, 8H), 1.96 (m, 2H), 1.72–1.77 (m, 8H), 1.29–1.44 (m, 50H), 0.88–0.89 (m, 15H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 182.84, 158.24, 157.34, 151.38, 146.84, 145.91, 141.18, 136.44, 133.99, 132.20, 128.88, 123.14, 118.10, 114.40, 101.32, 68.01, 61.74, 43.51, 31.83, 29.44, 29.37, 29.31, 29.24, 27.32, 26.09, 22.66, 14.11; MALDI-TOF-MS m/z: M+, found 1340.397; FTIR (neat, cm−1): 1656 (–CHO).
Synthesis of DTCC–IC
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a mixed solution of DTCC–CHO (402 mg, 0.30 mmol), 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one (400 mg, 2.10 mmol), pyridine (1.5 mL), and chloroform (30 mL) was added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and then refluxed for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (300 mL) and then filtered. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixed solvent as the eluent (petroleum ether/dichloromethane, v/v = 1:1) to give a dark blue solid (371 mg, 73%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 8.70–8.73 (t, 4H), 7.97 (s, 2H), 7.93 (d, 2H), 7.79–7.81 (m, 4H), 7.69 (s, 2H), 7.29–7.33 (t, 8H), 7.18 (s, 2H), 6.87–6.89 (d, 8H), 3.94–3.97 (t, 8H), 3.72 (t, 2H), 1.74–1.81 (m, 8H), 1.67 (m, 2H), 1.29–1.45 (m, 50H), 0.86–0.91 (m, 15H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 187.88, 160.82, 159.70, 158.46, 158.24, 148.06, 141.41, 141.15, 139.75, 136.79, 136.36, 135.28, 134.63, 134.50, 129.15, 124.06, 123.78, 121.36, 114.52, 101.98, 68.40, 68.10, 61.50, 31.94, 31.82, 29.57, 29.39, 29.34, 29.24, 29.17, 28.85, 27.25, 26.10, 22.65, 14.09; MALDI-TOF-MS m/z: M+, found 1692.369; FTIR (neat, cm−1): 2216 (–CN), 1696 (–CO).
Results and discussion
Synthesis, characterization, and thermal properties
All the intermediate products and the target A–D–A-type n-OS (DTCC–IC) were readily prepared according to the procedures depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis began via a conventional Suzuki coupling reaction by the combination of a 2,7-diboronic ester of carbazole (1) and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate to give compound 2, and a subsequent double nucleophilic addition reaction between freshly prepared 4-(octyloxy)phenyllithium and the ester groups of compound 2 was performed to give a benzylic alcohol (3), which was then directly converted to the fused heptacyclic arene (DTCC) via an acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction. After that, DTCC was subjected to the Vilsmeier reaction to give the key intermediate DTCC–CHO in a moderate yield (68%). Finally, DTCC–IC was obtained by the Knoevenagel reaction between DTCC–CHO and 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one in a high yield (73%). The chemical structures of all novel compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF (Fig. S1–S12†). In order to further confirm the chemical structures of DTCC–CHO and DTCC–IC, the FTIR spectra of both samples were recorded. As shown in Fig. S13,† a strong signal at 1656 cm−1, which corresponded to the stretching band of –CHO groups, was observed for DTCC–CHO. For the DTCC–IC sample, the strong signal that appeared at 1696 cm−1 is attributable to the stretching band of –CO groups, whereas a weak signal assigned to the stretching band of –CN groups can be observed at 2216 cm−1. Owing to the appropriate substitution of solubilizing alkyl chains, DTCC–IC exhibits excellent solubility in most chlorinated solvents and common organic solvents (>20 mg mL−1) at room temperature, which substantially affects processability and film quality in the corresponding non-fullerene OSC devices. Thermal analysis of DTCC–IC was conducted by TGA and DSC at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2a, DTCC–IC exhibited a high decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of up to 372 °C, which was indicative of high thermal stability for the fabrication of OSC devices. Note that DTCC–IC displayed distinct thermal transitions, which featured high melting/crystalline transformation temperatures (Tm/Tc) of 254/228 °C, during the heating/cooling cycles, respectively.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of both DTCC and DTCC–IC were measured in chloroform solution and the thin-film state; the relevant data are provided in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Note that the absorption spectrum of the parent core (DTCC) in chloroform solution is mainly located in the ultraviolet region, together with a weak response in the visible region (Fig. 3a); this feature is consistent with the reported polycyclic fused arenes.60 By the incorporation of two strongly electron-deficient IC terminal groups, the A–D–A-type DTCC-based n-OS (DTCC–IC) was developed, and its absorption spectrum in chloroform solution was significantly broadened in comparison to that of DTCC. Moreover, strong absorption at 500–720 nm with an impressively high molar absorption coefficient (ε = 2.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1, Fig. S14†) at 669 nm was demonstrated, which mainly originated from strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), as well as a strong D–A effect.61 In comparison with the absorption in solution, the DTCC–IC thin film gave rise to an expected sign of J-type aggregation,62 namely, a typical absorption feature with a significantly red-shifted ICT peak approaching 731 nm. The results indicate that DTCC–IC has a large tendency to crystallize and aggregate in solid-state films.61,62 The estimated optical band gap (Eopticalg) of DTCC–IC film is 1.59 eV, as determined from the absorption edge of the thin film (778 nm, Fig. 3a).

 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption spectra of (a) DTCC and DTCC–IC in chloroform solution and the thin-film state and (b) film samples fabricated under different conditions. 
To investigate the absorption spectra of blends, we further studied the absorption features of blends comprising a PTB7-Th donor and a DTCC–IC acceptor under different conditions, including different D/A weight ratios (1:0, 0:1, and 1:1) and the addition of 1% chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive. As shown in Fig. 3b, neat PTB7-Th film displayed stronger absorption at 500–698 nm than that of DTCC–IC, and had a certain overlap in absorption with DTCC–IC. After the addition of 1% CN as an additive, the absorption spectrum of the blend (PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC = 1:1) underwent a red shift of 24 nm in comparison to the equivalent blend without 1% CN as an additive, which was mainly caused by an enhancement in crystallinity and aggregation in the blended films.40 It should be noted that the strong, broad absorption features of DTCC–IC and its blended films are helpful for the enhancement of light-capturing ability, short-circuit current density (JSC), and PCEs in OSC devices.

Fig. 4a shows typical CV curves of DTCC–IC versus an Ag/AgCl electrode, and the relevant electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. Under the same measurement conditions, the oxidation onset potential of the Fc/Fc+ external standard was determined to be 0.38 V. As a result, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTCC–IC can be estimated from the following equations: HOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.42) eV; LUMO = −(Eonsetred + 4.42) eV. As shown in Fig. 4a, the oxidation and reduction onset potentials are 1.08 and −0.55 V, respectively. Therefore, the calculated values of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTCC–IC are −5.50 and −3.87 eV, respectively (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4b, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the well-known polymeric donor PTB7-Th are −5.20 and −3.56 eV, respectively. When non-fullerene OSC devices are fabricated from a PTB7-Th donor and a DTCC–IC acceptor, a well-matched energy-level alignment between the donor and acceptor would be achieved, which ensures sufficient energy offsets of 0.31 eV (LUMO–LUMO) for electron transfer and 0.30 eV (HOMO–HOMO) for hole transfer (Fig. 4b). Therefore, this kind of active blend would provide sufficient driving force for the efficient dissociation of excitons in OSCs.19,63 Note that the LUMO energy level of DTCC–IC is higher than those of PC61BM (−3.91 eV)64 and other well-known non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC-Th (−3.93 eV),40 which should lead to an improvement in VOC.65

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
To investigate the geometric and electronic properties of DTCC–IC, we performed DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. It should be mentioned that the four octyloxy groups in DTCC–IC were replaced by methoxy groups in order to simplify the DFT calculations. As shown in Fig. 5, DTCC–IC exhibits a highly coplanar backbone with very small torsion dihedral angles (<0.2°) along the whole molecular backbone. In general, this highly coplanar feature would facilitate π-electron delocalization along the whole π-conjugated backbone and in turn lead to enhancements in ICT and crystallinity, as well as carrier transport.66 Note that the four aryl side groups are located outside the main backbone of DTCC–IC, which would effectively suppress the strong backbone aggregation caused by the highly coplanar molecular backbone of DTCC–IC.48 In addition, the extensive delocalization of the HOMO/LUMO electron orbitals over the whole fused ring backbone further demonstrates that DTCC–IC has a highly coplanar backbone and thereby features strong ICT between the DTCC donor and the IC acceptor. All the calculated results strongly support the data from the absorption spectra discussed above.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the potential of the DTCC–IC-based electron acceptor for employment in OSCs, non-fullerene OSC devices with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:DTCC–IC/Ca/Al were fabricated, in which the well-known PTB7-Th was used as the electron donor and DTCC–IC was used as the electron acceptor. Fig. 6a shows typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices. The relevant photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. To achieve optimized device performance, active blends with three different D/A weight ratios (1.3:1, 1:1, and 1:1.3, w/w) and with/without 1% CN as an additive were investigated systematically. The optimized ratio was determined to be 1:1; JSC and FF values were highly dependent on the D/A weight ratio and additive, but VOC values were not sensitive. Note that optimized OSCs based on blends with D/A = 1:1 exhibited a JSC of 10.74 mA cm−2, a high VOC of 0.95 V, and an FF of 0.474, which resulted in a moderate PCE value of 4.84%. After the addition of 1% CN as an additive to the blends with D/A = 1:1, VOC remained at 0.95 V, whereas the PCE reached a maximum value of 6.0%, which mainly resulted from increases in JSC (11.23 mA cm−2) and FF (0.562) in comparison to OSCs without additives. On further variations in the D/A ratio from 1:1 to 1.3:1 or 1:1.3, VOC values remained at 0.95–0.96 V, whereas JSC and FF values decreased markedly, which thereby led to a reduced PCE value of <5.04%.

To validate the JSC values measured above, we measured the EQE values of OSCs fabricated under different conditions. The corresponding J–V curves and integral JSC values are provided in Fig. 6b and Table 2, respectively. Note that all the optimized blends displayed broad, strong photoresponse from 400 to 740 nm. Obviously, the strong photoresponse in the longer wavelength range of >700 nm should be mainly ascribed to the contribution of the DTCC–IC acceptor; this EQE result is also highly consistent with the absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC blend, as discussed above. Furthermore, we found that the intensity of photoresponse was markedly influenced by changing the D/A weight ratio, and the solvent additive CN could improve the EQE values. Among all the conditions, OSCs fabricated from blends (D/A = 1:1 or 1.3:1, w/w) with 1% CN achieved higher EQE intensity at 400–740 nm, which thereby led to higher integral JSC values of 11.28 and 11.21 mA cm−2 over the AM 1.5G spectrum, respectively, which closely match the JSC values calculated from the J–V curves above (11.23 and 10.84 mA cm−2). In addition, a polymer donor with a wide band gap, namely, PBT1-EH,67 was employed to match the DTCC–IC acceptor. These exhibit highly complementary absorption that covers nearly the entire wavelength region of 300–800 nm. However, OSCs exhibited a high VOC of 1.1 V, a JSC of 6.8 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.415, and a corresponding PCE value of 3.1% (Fig. S15†), which is lower than that of OSCs fabricated from PTB7-Th:DTCC–IC blends.
Charge transport properties
To better understand the differences in the observed JSC and FF values, we measured the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the blends using the conventional SCLC method. The device structures were ITO/MoOx/PTB7-Th or blend film/MoO3/Al for hole-only devices and ITO/Al/DTCC–IC or blend film/Al for electron-only devices. Typical J–V curves and detailed parameters of carrier mobility are provided in Fig. 7 and Table 3, respectively. The results demonstrated that owing to the incorporation of two strongly electron-deficient IC terminal groups the as-synthesized DTCC-based organic semiconductor (DTCC–IC) was transformed into an electron-accepting n-OS. The observed electron mobility of DTCC–IC was 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to that of fullerene derivative acceptors (μe ∼ 103 cm2 V−1 s−1).46–51 Such a high value of electron mobility indicates that DTCC–IC is an excellent n-type small-molecule acceptor for non-fullerene OSCs. For neat PTB7-Th films, a rational hole mobility of 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was observed, which closely matches the electron mobility of the DTCC–IC acceptor. When PTB7-Th and DTCC–IC were blended in the ratio of 1:1, the observed hole and electron mobilities of the blend remained at a high level (μh = 6.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the μe/μh ratio = 2.2) in comparison to those of the neat films. After the addition of 1% CN as an additive, the average μh and μe values of the PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC (1:1, w/w) blends increased to 1.07 × 10−3 and 1.86 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Therefore, the PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC blend with 1% CN as an additive afforded a better balance between hole and electron transfer (μe/μh ratio = 1.7) than that (μe/μh ratio = 2.2) without CN as an additive. In general, higher μh and μe values, as well as a closer balance between hole and electron mobilities, will facilitate charge extraction and reduce charge recombination, which is helpful for achieving higher JSC and FF values of the corresponding OSC devices (Table 2).68

Film morphology analysis
Because the morphology of a film can be closely connected with its photovoltaic performance,7 we determined the surface morphological structures of neat DTCC–IC and PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC blend (1:1, w/w) films with/without 1% CN as an additive by AFM measurements. As shown in Fig. 8, AFM height and phase images indicate that the neat DTCC–IC film displays large crystalline grains, which demonstrates an interconnected surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 5.0 nm. Such large crystalline grains and interconnected surface morphology, which mainly originate from strong intermolecular interactions, would provide highly efficient pathways for high-mobility electron transport.66,69 Interestingly, the grain size of the PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC (1:1, w/w) blend films was markedly reduced after blending the DTCC–IC acceptor with the PTB7-Th donor or the further addition of 1% CN as an additive. As a result, relatively homogeneous surface morphological structures were formed for the two blend films, which thereby afforded much lower values of RMS roughness of 1.56–2.09 nm in comparison to the neat DTCC–IC films. Judging from the phase images in Fig. 8d and f, clear evidence reveals that on the addition of 1% CN as an additive the scale of phase separation was markedly reduced in comparison to that without CN as an additive. The fact is that a much smaller scale of phase separation between the donor and acceptor will improve the JSC, FF, and PCE values of OSC devices.68

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the well-known ladder-like fused-ring structure DTCC can be used to design and synthesize a high-mobility n-type organic semiconductor (DTCC–IC) by the incorporation of two strongly electron-withdrawing terminal groups. For the first time, a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been demonstrated for the as-synthesized DTCC-based n-OS. Moreover, its good comprehensive properties, such as strong light-capturing ability in the region of 500–720 nm and rational energy level structure (HOMO/LUMO = −5.50/−3.87 eV), make DTCC–IC a promising non-fullerene acceptor for solar cells. By blending PTB7-Th as the donor and DTCC as the acceptor, non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated and optimized under different conditions. We found that the device performance and morphology of blend films could be fine-tuned by changing the PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC weight ratio or adding CN as an additive. An optimized OSC device fabricated from PTB7-Th/DTCC–IC (1:1, w/w) blend films afforded a moderate PCE value of 4.84%. After the addition of 1% CN as an additive to this blend, the hole and electron mobilities were enhanced and the scale of phase separation was further reduced, which thereby led to significant enhancements in JSC (11.23 mA cm−2), FF (0.562), and PCE (6%). This research indicates that DTCC–IC with the A–D–A structure is a promising electron acceptor for high-performance OSCs. Therefore, the further study of novel DTCC-based electron acceptors and the investigation of their structure-performance relationship are highly promising.
