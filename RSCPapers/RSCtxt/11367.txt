    AbstractA series of mixed crystals composed of Cu2ZnSnS4, Ag2ZnSnS4 and ZnS was prepared by co-precipitation of the corresponding metal ions in aqueous sodium sulfide followed by annealing in a sulfur atmosphere. Ideal solid solutions of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Ag2ZnSnS4 with a kesterite structure ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)) were successfully obtained by this procedure, as confirmed by their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and energy-diffuse X-ray (EDX) analyses. On the other hand, the solubility of ZnS in these kesterite compounds was found to be limited: the upper limit of the ratio of ZnS to (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 was less than 0.1, regardless of the Cu–Ag ratio in (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4. Based on the results for dependence of their photoabsorption properties on atomic compositions, a plausible band structure is discussed. Evaluation of the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution of these mixed crystals from an aqueous solution containing S2− and SO32− ions upon loading Ru catalysts under simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5) revealed that active compounds for this reaction should contain both dissolved ZnS and Ag components. The dissolved ZnS in (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 gave upward shifts of their conduction band edges. Moreover, the presence of Ag in the solid solution provided n-type conductivity, leading to efficient migration of photogenerated electrons to the surface to induce water reduction into H2.
Introduction
Chalcogenide semiconductors usually possess relatively negative potentials of valence bands compared to those of oxide semiconductors. Since this specific property leads to sufficiently negative conduction band levels for water reduction into H2 even for materials having narrow band gap energy, these sulfides are good candidates for H2 liberation photocatalysts under visible-light irradiation. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is one of the most typical compounds among a wide variety of chalcogenides and has been extensively studied for a long time.1–5 Upon loading with appropriate promoters for H2 formation such as Pt, the simple binary sulfide efficiently produces H2 from an aqueous solution containing an electron donor under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, due to the easiness of regulating micro and nanostructures, various hybrids based on CdS nanoparticles have been proposed for further functionalization of its photoactivity.6–11 However, a major bottleneck limiting the ability of CdS is its high toxicity. The rather large band gap energy (2.4 eV), which is far from the optimum to harvest solar radiation, is also an inevitable fault for the use of a CdS-based photocatalytic system.
Recently, Kudo and co-workers reported a series of ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 solid solutions as new chalcogenide photocatalysts for H2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing electron donors, such as sulfide (S2−) and sulfite (SO32−) ions, under visible-light irradiation.12–16 It has been proved that the energy band structure of the compound was controllable by change in the composition, i.e., the band gap energy and potentials of conduction bands (CBs) and valence bands (VBs) were regulated by fractions of ZnS, CuInS2, and AgInS2. When the Ru mediator for H2 evolution was loaded on the compound with the optimum composition of Cu0.25Ag0.25In0.5ZnS2 (1.77 eV of band gap energy), this photocatalyst produced H2 at a considerably high rate (ca. 8 dm3 m−2 h−1) even under a simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5). Because of its lower level of toxicity, the series of these solid solutions are promising for practical H2 liberation using H2S, a by-product obtained from an oil refinery, as a sacrificial donor.17–19 Regarding large-scale applications of ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 solid solutions, however, the availability of In is a significant issue of concern.
The kesterite compound, Cu2ZnSnS4, is a direct-transition-type semiconductor having narrow band gap energy of ca. 1.5 eV and a large absorption coefficient in the order of 104 cm−1.20 This semiconductor film can be obtained by replacing half of the In atoms in CuInS2 with Zn, and by replacing the other half with Sn. Since the abundance of Zn and Sn is much larger than that of In, this compound has been studied extensively as one of the most promising alternatives for an absorber of thin film solar cells.21–23 Indeed, the latest conversion efficiency of the Cu2ZnSnS4-based solar cell has reached over 6.7%.24 These facts have motivated us to develop a series of kesterite solid solutions comprised of Cu2ZnSnS4, Ag2ZnSnS4, and ZnS as alternative H2 evolution photocatalysts of ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 solid solutions. For this purpose, we aimed to fabricate these solid solutions with different compositions. Structural properties of these compounds were characterized in detail. By using these composites loaded with Ru catalysts, moreover, we investigated the influence of these properties on their photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from an aqueous solution containing S2− and SO32− electron donors under simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5). Very recently, some of the compounds, i.e., Cu2ZnSnS4, Ag2ZnSnS4, and CuAgZnSnS4, have been reported to some extent.25 However, the present study affords a fundamental understanding of the photocatalytic activity of the series of these Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS solid solutions from different view points, with emphasis on the required components to realize the photocatalytic H2 evolution.
Experimental
Preparation and characterization of samples
To an Erlenmeyer flask of 500 cm3, 100 cm3 of acidic nitrate solution (1.2 mol dm−3) containing Cu(NO3)2, AgNO3, Zn(NO3)2 and SnSO4 was added. The amounts of these metal ions were altered depending on the desired composition of Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS solid solutions. In order to synthesize (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 solid solution in a Cu/Ag combination ratio of 1 (i.e., x = 0.5), for example, 2.06 mmol Cu(NO3)2, 2.81 mmol AgNO3, 3.51 mmol Zn(NO3)2, and 2.85 mmol SnSO4 were dissolved in the solution. After adding 0.45 cm3 aqueous H2O2 (30%) to the solution, the mixture was poured into an aqueous solution (100 cm3) containing Na2S (16 mmol dm−3) and NaOH (0.1 mol dm−3). The brownish precipitate of the Cu–Ag–Zn–Sn sulfide precursor was placed with elemental sulfur in a sealed quartz tube and annealed at 550 °C for 10 min. Atomic compositions of thus-obtained powder products were determined from elemental analyses by using a Hitachi S-2250N energy-diffuse X-ray (EDX) analyzer. The crystallographic structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer (CuKα, Ni filter). Diffuse reflection spectra in ultraviolet, visible-light, and near-infrared regions were measured by using a Hitachi U-4100 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer, and the data were converted to Kubelka–Munk (KM) function. Microscopic features of loaded Ru catalysts on selected samples were observed using a Hitachi H-9000 transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Photocatalytic activity measurement
The powder photocatalyst sample (20 mg) and an aqueous solution (5 cm3) containing 2.5 mmol K2SO3 and 0.99 μmol (NH4)2RuCl6 were placed in a glass tube (18 mm in diameter and 180 mm in length). The suspensions were photoirradiated by using an Eagle Engineering PEC-L10 solar simulator (AM 1.5) under Ar at 298 K with vigorous magnetic stirring (1000 rpm) for 20–30 min, resulting in loading of 0.5 wt% Ru on the sample.15 After adding 0.5 mmol Na2S to the solution, the suspension was photoirradiated again under Ar. A portion of the gas phase was withdrawn with a syringe at appropriate intervals and the components (containing evolved H2) were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with an MS-5A (GL Sciences) column and a TCD detector. For a selected sample, an action spectrum of the H2 evolution was measured by monochromatic-light irradiation, which was obtained by passing light from the 300 W Xe lamp through bandpass and cutoff filters. The number of incident photons was determined by an OPHIR Orion laser power meter equipped with a photodiode.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements on Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS solid solutions were performed in 0.1 mol dm−3 Na2SO4 aqueous solution containing 50 mmol dm−3 triethanolamine (pH adjusted to 13) and in 0.1 mol dm−3 Eu(NO3)3 aqueous solution (pH 6). Working electrodes were prepared by pasting powder samples onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate or by sintering powder samples at 500 °C under Ar followed by loading an Au back contact by vacuum evaporation. A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and a Hokuto Denko HB-151 potentio-galvanostat was employed to obtain voltammograms. Photocurrents were measured under Ar using the lock-in technique. Sample electrodes were irradiated by chopping at 6 Hz of light of wavelengths longer than 440 nm, which was obtained by passing light from a 300 W Xe lamp (Cermax) fitted with a cut-off filter (Hoya L-44) to block light in the ultraviolet (UV) region.
Results and discussion
Structural and optical properties

Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of Cu2ZnSnS4, Ag2ZnSnS4 and their solid solutions with different Cu/Ag ratios (i.e., (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)) obtained by the co-precipitation of desired components followed by annealing in a sulfur atmosphere. The diffraction patterns of Cu2ZnSnS4 (x = 1) and Ag2ZnSnS4 (x = 0) samples gave typical diffraction peaks assignable to the corresponding kesterite crystals.26,27 Compared to these diffraction patterns, appreciable shifts of diffraction patterns were observed on the (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 samples: these XRD patterns were shifted to low 2θ degrees along with increase in the Ag content. From the fact that the ionic radius of Ag+ (1.14 nm) is larger than that of Cu+ (0.74 nm) and the fact that there are no other crystalline phases included in any of the samples, the observed shifts of the XRD patterns are clear indications of the gradual replacement of Cu with Ag to form Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4 solid solutions with various compositions.

Fig. 2 shows typical diffuse reflection spectra of (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 samples. The Cu2ZnSnS4 sample shows absorption onset at 860 nm, corresponding to the band gap energy (1.45 eV) reported previously.28 In the same manner, a theoretically estimated value of band gap energy (i.e., 1.98 eV)29 was obtained from the onset wavelength of the diffuse reflection spectrum of Ag2ZnSnS4. The significant difference in band gap energies between these compounds is due to the difference in their VB potentials, i.e., the Cu 3d and S 3p orbitals mainly contributed to the formation of VB of Cu2ZnSnS4, while the VB of Ag2ZnSnS4 is made up with Ag 4d and S 3p orbitals.30,31 Upon increase in the Cu content in the (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 solid solutions up to ca. 0.2, the absorption edges of these samples were monotonously shifted from those of Ag2ZnSnS4 to longer wavelengths close to those of Cu2ZnSnS4, as expected from the difference in VB potentials between these samples. On the other hand, the (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 solid solutions with relatively high Cu/Ag ratio (>0.2) showed absorption onsets at specifically longer wavelength regions than those of Cu2ZnSnS4: the lowest band gap energy of 1.40 eV was obtained by the solid solution with equimolar amount of Cu to Ag (i.e., CuAgZnSnS4). The unusual red shifts of the spectra are likely to be derived from hybridization of Cu3d and Ag4d orbitals, leading to widening VBs of these compounds, as observed on CuInS2–AgInS2 solid solutions.16

One strategy for enlarging the band gap energy of the CuAgZnSnS4 sample is an induction of an upward shift of its CB potential. According to previous reports on CuInS2 and AgInS2 photocatalysis,12–16 addition of a Zn component is a probable method for such control. Hence, we attempted to add excess amounts of Zn to form CuAgZnSnS4–ZnS solid solutions. Fig. 3 shows typical XRD patterns of thus-obtained powders with different mixture ratios of ZnS to CuAgZnSnS4 (labeled (CuAgZnSnS4)1−y(ZnS)4y (0 ≤ y ≤ 0.5)).
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of (CuAgZnSnS4)1−y(ZnS)4y samples with various ZnS contents. Diamonds denote diffraction peaks of ZnS. 
On the samples with relatively low ZnS contents (y ≤ 0.1), no significant alteration of diffraction patterns was observed in comparison with those of CuAgZnSnS4, owing to the formation of desired CuAgZnSnS4–ZnS solid solutions. On the other hand, additional diffractions assigned to the ZnS phase with a zinc blend structure appeared on the samples of y = 0.3 ((CuAgZnSnS4)0.7(ZnS)1.2), and the diffraction intensities increased with increase in the y value. In regard to these photoabsorption properties, appreciable blue shifts of photoabsorption onsets from those of CuAgZnSnS4 were observed on the (CuAgZnSnS4)1−y(ZnS)4y samples with y values lower than 0.1, as shown in the plot of photoabsorption onsets of these samples versus y (Fig. 4a). However, the plot became a plateau on the samples with y > 0.1, i.e., further expansion of band gap energies could not be achieved. These results indicate the limitation of solubility of ZnS in CuAgZnSnS4, and the upper limit of the y value seems to be ca. 0.1. Similar dependence of band gap energies on ZnS content (y value) was also observed when the same ZnS solubility tests were performed using Ag2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnS4 instead of the CuAgZnSnS4 sample, while the changes in their band gap energy at y < 0.1 were less significant than those observed on CuAgZnSnS4 (Fig. 4b and c). Thus, the observed limitation of ZnS solubility is likely to be the inevitable feature of the Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS system at least in the present fabrication procedure.

For further regulation of the optical properties, Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4 solid solutions with various Cu/Ag ratios ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)) were used as hosts to dissolve 5% and 10% of ZnS to form ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.95(ZnS)0.2 and ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 solid solutions, respectively. In the same manner as that for the (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 solid solutions (see Fig. 1), XRD patterns of these samples were shifted to the high angle side of Cu2ZnSnS4 as the value of x increased, indicating successful formation of the corresponding solid solutions (see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Fig. 5 shows diffuse reflection spectra of these solid solutions. For ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.95(ZnS)0.2 samples, appreciable red shifts of absorption onsets were observed for samples with relatively high Cu content (x > 0.5) and abrupt blue shifts close to the absorption onset of (Ag2ZnSnS4)0.95(ZnS)0.2 were also observed as the x value decreased to less than 0.5. The non-linear behavior was similar to that of the Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4 system (see Fig. 4a), though it was less significant than that system. On the other hand, for the ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 solid solutions, band gap energies widened monotonously as the x value was increased, as shown in Fig. 5b.

The above-described results for photoabsorption properties of the solid solutions represent unique effects of ZnS components on their band structures. One of the significant effects is the induction of upward shifts of CBs to widen their band gap energy. Theoretical studies on Cu2ZnSnS4 have shown that CB of Cu2ZnSnS4 is derived from hybridization of a relatively high-energy Zn4s orbital and a low-energy Sn5s orbital.29–31 When a similar electronic structure of CBs was assumed for the analogous series of (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 solid solutions, the addition of excess Zn to these compounds should induce as-observed upward shifts of CBs due to the increase in contribution of the Zn4s orbital to CB. Another noticeable effect of ZnS dissolution is its contribution to VB potentials. As discussed above, unusual red shifts of absorption onsets, i.e., reduction of band gap energies, occurred on the (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 solid solutions with the x value ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 because of the strong hybridization between Cu3d and Ag4d orbitals. Such red shifts were, however, suppressed on the samples containing ZnS (i.e., the Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS system, see Fig. 5). It is likely that dissolution of ZnS in (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 corresponds to dilution of Cu and Ag concentrations in the solid matrix, resulting in the reduction of specific interactions between them to induce the upward shifts of their VB potentials. When the content of ZnS in the solid solution approaches its limit to be incorporated ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4, hybridization between Cu3d and Ag4d might become moderate. Thus, the sample showed a simple monotonic dependence of band gap energies on the mixture ratio of Cu to Ag, as shown in Fig. 5b.
Photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution
Photoinduced reduction of water to produce H2 from an aqueous solution containing S2− and SO32− electron donors was performed as a test reaction of photoactivity of these solid solutions. In this system, water is reduced to H2 by the electrons photogenerated in CB accompanied by oxidation of these electron donors, as expressed by the following equations:3,13 2H2O + 2e−(CB) = H2 + 2OH−(1) 2S2− + 2h+(VB) = S22−(2) SO32− + H2O + 2h+(VB) = SO42− + 2H+(3) SO32− + S2− + 2h+(VB) = S2O32−,(4)where e−(CB) and h+(VB) denote photogenerated electron in CB and photogenerated hole in VB, respectively. Preliminary experiments revealed the requirement of loading of noble metals to make promoters on their surfaces for H2 production. Therefore, before the evaluation of photoactivity, we aimed to deposit a small amount of ruthenium (Ru) particles on these solid solutions (0.5 wt%) through the in situ photodeposition technique using (NH4)2RuCl6 and K2SO3 as a Ru source and a reductant, respectively (see Experimental). Fig. 6 shows typical time course curves of H2 evolution on the ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 solid solutions with different Cu/Ag compositions under simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5). H2 evolution could be observed from the suspensions of these samples, while appreciably low H2 evolution was observed on the sample without containing the Ag component (x = 1). After 3 h photoirradiation, the total amounts of evolved H2 over relatively active samples (i.e., x ≥ 0.5) reached more than 40 μmol. Since molar amounts of ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 (x ≥ 0.5) solid solutions are estimated to be ca. 40 μmol, total H2 yields exceeded molar amounts of these solid solutions, implying that the reaction proceeds catalytically.
 Fig. 6  Time course curves of H2 evolution over Ru-loaded ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 solid solutions with various x values. 
In accordance with the above eqn (1), apparent quantum efficiency (QEapp) of the present H2 evolution can be written as QEapp = {(number of evolved H2 molecules)/2 × (number of incident photons)} × 100(5)We determined QEapp values for one of the active samples of (CuAgZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 with different photoirradiation wavelengths. These results are shown in Fig. 7. Appreciable QEapp values of 0.18–0.25% were obtained at wavelengths shorter than 700 nm and the QEapp value declined to almost zero at 800 nm-photoirradiation. Since the onset of the spectrum is in approximate agreement with that of the diffuse reflection spectrum of the sample (see Fig. 5b), the observed H2 evolution was confirmed to be induced by band-gap excitation of used sulfides.

As a relative measure of photocatalytic activity of solid solutions fabricated in this study, we defined the rate of H2 evolution (rH2) as the maximal slope of each plot during the initial 3 h of irradiation, though shapes of these time course curves were deviated depending on the samples, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 8 summarizes the thus obtained rH2s over solid solutions with various compositions under the AM 1.5 radiation. A common feature was that rH2 was quite small over the (CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4 samples regardless of their Cu/Ag compositions. Moreover, samples without the presence of the Ag component also showed a low rate of H2 evolution, as mentioned above. Hence, in the series of Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS solid solutions, active compounds for this reaction should include both incorporated ZnS species and Ag components.
 Fig. 8  Rate of H2 liberation (rH2) over Ru-loaded ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)1−y(ZnS)4y solid solutions with various x and y values. 
As suggested from the above-discussed optical characteristics, a relatively high CB potential, which is made by the incorporated ZnS, is required to give the electrons sufficient potential to induce water reduction into H2. A similar idea might be applied to the requirement of large Ag contents, i.e., sufficiently low VB potential is favorable for withdrawing electrons from sacrificial donors, while the effect should not be significant compared to the change in the CB potential. Hence, in regard to the requirement of certain Ag contents for efficient H2 liberation, other important factors should be included.

Fig. 9 shows TEM images of selected samples recovered after the above photoirradiation experiment. On the (CuAgZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 sample, the most active sample for H2 liberation, Ru nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed, as shown in Fig. 9a. The presence of an appreciable amount of Ru nanoparticles was also confirmed on the (Ag2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 sample, which showed moderate photocatalytic activity (Fig. 9b). On the other hand, there were almost no Ru nanoparticles on the (Cu2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 sample, which did not exhibit photoactivity for H2 liberation, despite using the same procedure for loading Ru mediators (Fig. 9c). These results suggest that one of the factors to induce the difference in photoactivity on ZnS-incorporated samples is the difference in surface distribution of Ru mediators for H2 production. For the evaluation of the effect of surface loaded Ru on the photocatalytic activity of the (Cu2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 sample, we prepared the sample loaded with 0.5 wt% Ru by impregnation of a Ru precursor ion followed by reduction of it under H2 (5%) flow at 200 °C, and used for the H2 evolution reaction. As a result, almost no H2 evolution was observed on this sample (data not shown). Thus, the most significant failure of the (Cu2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 to lower the photocatalytic activity is its difficulty for efficient migration of photogenerated electrons to the surface to induce reduction reactions, i.e., photodeposition of Ru mediators and water reduction into H2.

Fig. 10 shows photocurrent-potential characteristics of ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 electrodes in aqueous solutions containing triethanolamine and Eu3+, as a sacrificial electron donor and acceptor, respectively. The (Ag2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 sample showed a well-defined anodic (n-type) photocurrent response under illumination in an aqueous triethanolamine solution, as shown in Fig. 10a. Appreciable anodic photocurrents were also observed on ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 containing the Ag component (i.e., x > 0). On the other hand, the (Cu2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 sample did not give anodic photocurrent: it gave a weak cathodic photocurrent probably due to reduction of the sample itself. When (Cu2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4 was illuminated in contact with Eu3+ instead of triethanolamine, moreover, the sample exhibited a cathodic (p-type) photocurrent response (Fig. 10b). Since Cu2ZnSnS4 is known to exhibit p-type conductivity, the dissolution of ZnS components retains the conductive type of Cu2ZnSnS4. The reversal of conductive type of a series of the present samples from p-type to n-type is, therefore, induced by partial displacement of the Cu site with Ag, implying that one probable reason in change in the dispersibility of Ru nanoparticles shown in Fig. 9 is the difference in conductive type of these solid solutions. In other words, the observed difference in photocatalytic activity can be explained by the difference in their conductive types. The active compound in the present Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2ZnSnS4–ZnS system to induce H2 evolution should have n-type conductivity: in this conductive type, the majority carrier of electron can be migrated efficiently on the surface of particles to induce H2 liberation, whereas the minority carrier of photogenerated hole is also consumed by strong electron acceptors of S2− and SO32− ions on their surface followed by the above-mentioned eqn (2)–(5). On the other hand, probably due to the less efficient migration ability of the minority carrier of photogenerated electrons in the p-type (Cu2ZnSnS4)0.9(ZnS)0.4, these electron-mediated reactions, such as Ru deposition and H2 evolution, might be significantly suppressed by using this sample.

Conclusions
In this study, we examined a series of kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4) derivatives composed of abundant elements for photocatalytic H2 evolution under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5) irradiation. It was proved that active derivatives for efficient H2 evolution include both incorporated ZnS and Ag2ZnSnS4 to some degree to form ((CuxAg1−x)2ZnSnS4)1−y(ZnS)4y (0 < x ≤ 1, 0 < y ≤ 0.1) solid solutions. The incorporation of ZnS samples gave an upward shift of conduction band edges, whereas the presence of Ag2ZnSnS4 in the solid solution might make them having n-type conductivity, leading to successful loadings of highly dispersed Ru catalysts for H2 evolution during the in situ photodeposition process. The results, therefore, indicate that regulation of energy structure and conductive type of Cu2ZnSnS4 by changing its composition is a promising strategy to produce an H2 evolution photocatalyst that efficiently utilizes sunlight radiation. Further optimization of its composition to improve the efficiency is now in progress.
