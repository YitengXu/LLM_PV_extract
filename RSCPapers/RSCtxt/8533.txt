University, Beijing, 100871, P. R. ChinaReceived 22nd May 2000, Accepted 4th September 2000First published on 26th October 2000AbstractTwo series of new multi-chromophoric perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride dyes for solar cell sensitizers have been synthesized. One series
consists of oxadiazole or naphthaldicarboximide that are linked with perylene
units as N,N′-substituted chromophores. The other
series has four substituents in the bay-region of the perylene core in
addition to N,N′-substituents. These novel routes
to highly efficient sensitizers for Grätzel-type solar cells avoid
the complication of doping. A wide spectral photoresponse (from 310 to 700 nm)
was observed with maximum IPCE (incident photon-to-current efficiency)
of 24%. In addition, the sensitization is dependent on the energy match of
the energy bands of the semiconductor and the redox potential of the segments
in such assembled dyes.IntroductionRuthenium(II) complexes [Ru(L)2(NCS)2]-sensitized
nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells (Grätzel-type) with light-to-electrical
power conversion efficiency as high as 10% at AM 1.5 (artificial sun light
spectrum) have been reported,1–3
in which the photoanode was prepared by sintering nanocrystalline TiO2
on a conducting glass support. However, compared to other chromophores, the
ruthenium(II) complexes have quite poor photophysics, relatively
low extinction coefficients for visible light (∼14000 M−1 cm−1),
and luminescence very weakly from a triplet state with a quantum yield of ∼0.40%
(125 K).2 Furthermore, the stability
of complexes such as [Ru(L)2(NCS)2] over long-term
operation in a liquid cell is unknown, which slows down the full realization
of the applications of solar cells. In addition to TiO2 used in
Grätzel-type solar cells, several similar transition metal oxides
(e.g. SnO2)4 with wide
band gaps have also been well studied. The investigation and development of
other dye-semiconductor systems are essential to furthering fundamental
understanding of the electron injection processes, and exploration of specialized
and long-term applications of dye-sensitized solar cell. Dyes based
on perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxydiimides (PTCAs) have received much
attention4 as sensitizers with their outstanding
chemical, thermal and photochemical stability. Perylene derivatives are highly
absorbing in the visible to NIR (ε ∼ 105 M−1 cm−1)
and emit fluorescence with quantum yields near unity.5
On the other hand, perylene derivatives can also be used as near-infrared
(NIR) absorbers or luminescent materials, and nowadays the highly photo-luminescent
and also environmentally stable NIR materials are strongly required. Beside
their conventional uses, perylenes are key chromophores for high-tech
applications, from electronic to biological fields, such as optical switches,6 lasers7 and DNA/RNA
probes8etc. Many types of PTCAs have
been synthesized, but the expected low solubility of these molecules is a
problem for synthesis and purification. Therefore work has shifted towards
more soluble perylenes.5 The solubility of
the perylene dyes may increase with attached bulky aliphatic groups like tert-butylaryl
or long-chain secondary alkyl groups9 (swallow-tail
substituents). However, the longer alkyl and branched alkyl chain in the N-alkyl
compounds appeared to lower the decomposition temperature. This is due to
the initial decomposition of the alkyl substituent.9bThe bare TiO2 or SnO2 films are transparent and colorless,
displaying the fundamental absorption in the UV region, so a solar cell with
high efficiency needs efficient sensitization by a dye. The nanoporous surface
of the transparent electrode is increased so that a large number of dye molecules
can be adsorbed directly on the electrode surface and simultaneously be in
direct contact with the redox electrolyte, which results in an efficient separation
and transport of the photogenerated charge carriers. If the roughness factor
of an electrode is sufficiently large, even a monolayer of dye could absorb
most of the incident photons.1 Consequently
the study of a microporous electrode with a very high specific surface area
and high effective sensitizers is of great interest. However, in contrast
with the massive work focused on the properties of the ruthenium(II)
complexes, less effort has been made so far to explore new types of organic
dye sensitizers. In a new sensitizing dye–semiconductor system comprised
of perylene derivatives on SnO2, perylenes containing carboxylic
acid groups adsorbed to and efficiently photosensitized colloidal SnO2
films.4 It is crucially important for solar
cell sensitizers to control the valence band since most inorganic semiconductors
such as ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 exhibit n-type character.2,4 The excited states of sensitizers must have
a sufficiently long lifetime in order to undergo the photochemical reaction.
The Yokoyama group found a drastic increase in the photocurrent density and
the power conversion efficiency by doping H2 due to a shift of
the Fermi level.10 A simple approach is to
utilize two or more different dyes by a doping method, which shows strong
absorption at a different wavelength and compensatory absorbency.11,12
However, multilayer adsorption does not often help, as the inner layer tends
to act as an insulator with respect to the outer ones.Another possible approach is to incorporate known chromophoric units into
a molecule. Such multi-chromophoric dyes should have a wide absorptive
region, whose photocurrent could cover the whole visible region. The alternatives
leave much scope for a chemist. In this way, it might be possible to avoid
the complication of doping and to find a novel route to design appropriate
solar cell sensitizers. Scandola et al.13
used an appropriate antenna-sensitizer assembly to overcome problems of
light harvesting efficiency in the spectral sensitization of wide-band
gap semiconductors. As electrical and optical function rely on extended conjugated
systems, two ways to enlarge the π system of perylene dyes can be envisaged:5b an arylimidazole introduction and substituents
in the bay-region of the perylene core. The first route generally yields
dyes with fairly poor solubility, and unfortunately the UV/Vis spectrum of
these dyes depends weakly on the substituents.5c
Accordingly we designed and synthesized several novel soluble multi-chromophoric
dyes (perylenetetracarboxydiimide derivatives) as shown in Fig. 1.
One series consists of oxadiazole or naphthaldicarboximide units that are
linked with perylene units as N,N′-substituted
chromophores. The other series has four substituents in the bay-region
of the perylene core besides N,N′-substituents.
They have long-wavelength absorption, surprisingly good solubility in
organic solvents and high thermal stability. These novel routes to design
highly efficient sensitizers for Grätzel-type solar cell can avoid
the complication of doping. Due to the high photostability, broad visible-light
absorption and high extinction coefficiency (ε ∼ 105 M−1 cm−1,
450∼600 nm in solution) of perylenedicarboximide derivatives, they
are potentially interesting compounds for solar cells. The improved solubility
of perylenedicarboximide in common organic solvents provided possible adsorption
onto colloidal SnO2 films. Naphthal-1,8-dicarboximide can
absorb blue, green and yellow colors by adjusting the substituted group at
its 4-position. The LUMO levels14 of the
oxadiazole unit and perylene unit are higher than that of the conduction bond
(CB) of nanoporous TiO2 or SnO2 (shown in Fig. 2).
We expect that these novel multi-chromophoric sensitizers can improve
the electrochemical and photostability of the Grätzel solar cells under
high photocurrent density, which was the key problem limiting the practical
application. Fig. 1  The molecular structures

tetracarboxylic dianhydride T-PTCA1. Compounds T-PTCA2 and T-PTCA4
were easily obtained according to the literature procedure.15
Condensation of T-PTCA2 with the dyes T-PTCA7, T-PTCA8 occurs
cleanly in hot quinoline with zinc acetate as a catalyst, and both the C-shaped
isomers and S-shaped isomers were obtained as deep red compounds. The
clefts were already highly preorganized, not only by restricted rotation about
the C(aryl)–N(imide) bond but also by fixing of the C(acid) or O(-OH)–C(aryl)
bond by an internal hydrogen bond, and they could be identified by the higher
polarity of the C-isomers as evidenced by a lower Rf
on silica gel.16 We have synthesized the compound
R1 = CH2CH2OH, but its solubility
was not satisfactory, and when R1 = H, the solubility
was even worse. Demethylation of T-PTCA5 was achieved in dry methylene
chloride in the presence of BBr3. The best reaction occurred at
room temperature for 12 hours and then reflux for a further 2 h.

shown in Fig. 1 were used as comparisons
in this study.Photoelectrochemical experimentsAs shown in Fig. 3, the liquid junction
solar cell for measuring the photocurrent is composed of the sensitized nanoporous
SnO2 electrode and a counter electrode with a electrolyte solution
containing 0.3 mol l−1 LiI and 0.03 mol l−1
I2 dissolved in 1,2-propylene carbonate solution. The counter
electrode is saturated calomel electrode (SCE). All the potentials measured
in this article are relative to SCE unless otherwise stated. SnO2
colloids were prepared according to the method described previously.18 Colloidal SnO2 solution (ca.
13%) was spread on the OTE (sheet resistance ∼ 8 Ω cm−2).
After it was sintered at 250°C for 30 minutes and the temperature
dropped to about 100°C, it was quickly immersed into saturated
dye solution in DMF, kept for 24 h and then dried in air. The two-electrode
sandwich cells were prepared by placing the counter electrode, a Pt plate,
on top of OTE–SnO2 or OTE–SnO2–Dye
with a thin strip of PTFE as spacer and were used to measure IPCE (Incident
photon-to-current conversion efficiency).2
The illuminated area of working electrode was 0.2 cm2. A
high-pass filter (>350 nm) was used to remove ultraviolet radiation.
A potentiostat (Model 173 EG&G PARC) served to control potential. The
intensities of monochromatic light were measured with a calibrated radiometer/photometer
(Model 550-1, EG&G PARC). The photocurrent spectra were normalized
after subtracting the transmittance of the OTE. With our preparation and measurement
system, the IPCE value for cis-(SCN)2 bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)
ruthenium(II) alone (TiO2 electrode) was 80% in the
wavelength range between 510 and 570 nm. The atomic force microscopy
(AFM, DI Nanoscope III A) image indicated the morphology of the SnO2
film deposited on a conducting glass support. It can be estimated that the
SnO2 particles in the film are spherical with the diameter of about
5 nm, so the characteristics of the SnO2 film are nanocrystalline,
and is composed of interconnected particles and pores. Fig. 3  Scheme of liquid junction
cell based on the SnO2 electrode sensitized by OXZ-PER. Results and discussionAbsorption and fluorescence spectraThe absorption spectra of these multi-chromophoric compounds (PCTA
series and OXZ-PER) in DMF are shown in Fig. 4.
Comparison with the absorption of 1,3,4-oxadiazole and perylenetetracarboxydiimide,
the high absorption coefficient at the wavelength of ultraviolet region (340 nm)
corresponds to the absorption of the oxadiazole unit, and the peaks of 439,
529 nm correspond to the absorption of the perylene unit. That is to
say the absorbency of multi-chromophoric dye OXZ-PER is the exact
sum of the constituent chromophores. This means that there is little or no
interaction between the chromophores connected by saturated covalent bonds
in their ground state, so that their individual absorption characteristics
should be maintained for OXZ-PER. For the PCTA series, the characteristic
absorption of the perylene unit and naphthal-1,8-dicarboximide units
were also observed. Naphthal-1,8-dicarboximide can absorb blue, green
and yellow colors by adjusting the substituted group at its 4-position.19,20 When its 4-position substituent was
a dimethylamino group, i.e. PCTA3, the maximum absorption of the
naphthal-1,8-dicarboximide was at around 430 nm, which overlaps
with some of the absorption of perylene. From this standpoint, it can be shown
that multi-chromophoric dyes, in which the chromophoric units are connected
by saturated bonds, provide an appropriate route to effective sensitizers
for solar cells with a wide spectrum range of absorption. Fig. 4  Absorption spectra
of PCTA1, PCTA2, PCTA3 and OXZ-PER in DMF (10−5 mol l−1). Absorption spectra of the perylene derivatives of the T-PTCA series
are reported in Table 1. The absorption
spectral data of the two isomers each of T-PTCA7 and of T-PTCA8 are
identical, and this is due to their very similar structures. The expected
broadening of their absorption bands compared to T-PTCA4, which could
be measured by the half-height width of the longest absorption band,4b was not displayed. As seen in Fig. 5,
the shapes of the absorption spectra of the T-PTCA series are very similar
to each other. They all have high molar extinction coefficiency. The extension
of the π-system in the bay region induces a dramatic bathochromic shift
compared with RPTCA and PPDCA, non-substituted perylenes in the bay region.
In comparison with T-PTCA5 and T-PTCA6, the maximum absorption wavelengths
of compounds T-PTCA2, T-PTCA4, T-PTCA7 and T-PTCA8 are similar,
a little shorter than the former. This indicated that the linking of two π-systems
through a single bond did not result in much alteration of the UV/Vis spectra.
Only an appreciable overlap of the chromophore induced strong absorption at
longer wavelengths.17 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra

are shown in Table 2. The maximum
absorption wavelengths were longer in chloroform than in acetone for all the
perylene derivatives. This showed that the less polar solvents are beneficial
for the bathochromic shifts for the perylenes, i.e. they produce a larger bathochromic shift.

in solution and on solid film are very similar. However, the spectra of T-PTCA2,
T-PTCA7, T-PTCA8 and T-PTCA6 on solid film show only an unstructured
broad band. It is of interest that the differences of the maximum absorption
wavelength of T-PTCA4, T-PTCA2 and T-PTCA5 between solution and
solid film are small, yet remarkably bathochromic shifts occur for compounds
T-PTCA7, T-PTCA8 and T-PTCA6 in acetone and on solid film: 60,
50 and 40 nm, respectively. This phenomenon could not be explained
only by the π interaction or intermolecular overlap in the solids. Compared
with T-PTCA4 and T-PTCA2, the T-PTCA7, T-PTCA8 have bulky
groups at the nitrogen atoms, which could lower the intermolecular interaction.9b Since –COOH or –OH groups
are present in compounds T-PTCA7, T-PTCA8 and T-PTCA6, we believe
that, at least in part, changes in the structures and maximum absorption of
the absorption spectra indicate greater hydrogen bonding than explained by
the small influence of intermolecular π-conjugation. Because the low
concentrations of the solution and polar solvents both do not favor hydrogen
bond formation,5b,5c
no excimers or oligmers were observed in the UV-Vis absorption. However,
the intermolecular interaction between –OH and –H is very strong
for compounds T-PTCA7, T-PTCA8 and T-PTCA6 on solid film, so large
bathochromic shifts occurred (Fig. 6). Fig. 6  Absorption spectra
of T-PTCA4(1); T-PTCA5(2); T-PTCA7(3); T-PTCA6(4) on solid
film. Except for T-PTCA5 and T-PTCA6, the other T-PTCAs are highly
fluorescent, and high fluorescence quantum yields are obtained for the T-PTCA
series. The results of fluorescence spectra of the T-PTCA series (Table 3) exhibit the typical mirror symmetry
between absorption and emission bands. This indicates that little structural
rearrangement occurs between the ground and the excited state of the compound.
The characteristic Q bands of perylene, i.e. they show a singlet
at around 600 and 610 nm together with a shoulder at around 659 and
660 nm in the Q band region (500–800 nm), were observed
from their emission spectra. For compounds T-PTCA5 and T-PTCA6, their
absorption in the visible region was strong, but the fluorescence emission
was very weak, as seen in Table 3
and Fig. 7. Fig. 7  Fluorescence emission

filmThe absorption spectra of sensitized and unsensitized SnO2 electrodes
were determined (shown in Fig. 8). The
spectra show that the unsensitized electrode (bare SnO2 film) exhibits
the fundamental absorption at 306 nm (band gap energy, 3.8 eV4) in the ultraviolet region. However, the multi-chromophoric
dye sensitized electrode has a strong absorption in the UV and visible region.
It indicates that the OXZ-PER dye has been adsorbed onto the nanoporous
ITO/SnO2 electrode. The nature of the interaction leading to adsorption
of the dye on the surface may be the interaction between the carbonyl group
and SnO2 resulting from either bonding electrostatically or forming
an ester linkage by a hydrolysis reaction with a Sn–OH.4
This is similar with that between a carboxy group and TiO2. The
absorption peaks at 340, 439 and 529 nm indicate that there is little
or no interaction between the oxadiazole and perylene chromophores even in
the adsorbed state. Thus the responding photocurrent of the nanocrystalline
SnO2 sensitization by the novel multi-chromophoric OXZ-PER
dye could cover a wide range of absorption. Fig. 8  Absorption spectra
of SnO2 nanostructured porous film deposited on conducting glass
unsensitized (curve a) and dye-sensitized by OXZ-PER (curve b). Photocurrent–voltage characteristics under white light irradiation
and action spectra of the photocurrent were measured with the two-electrode
system shown in Fig. 9 to characterize
the photoenergy conversion efficiency. Fig. 9
shows the photocurrent action spectra of the sensitized and unsensitized SnO2
electrode. As shown in Fig. 9, the open
circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent
(Jsc) of the sensitized electrode by OXZ-PER dye were
0.17 V and 180 mA (i.e. 900 mA cm−2),
respectively. The fill factor (FF) was 0.34.21
The dye sensitized nano-SnO2 electrode showed relatively large Jsc
although Voc was relatively small. The photoresponse was
drastically broadened to the visible light region, covering a wide range of
spectrum (310 to 700 nm). The photocurrent of the unsensitized electrode
(ITO/SnO2) was very low around the 400 nm region and decreased
to almost zero at 500 nm. A little photocurrent generated by the light
with wavelength over 400 nm may be related to the surface states or
inner localized states of bare SnO2 nanostructured film. These
surface states or inner localized states may absorb a photon of energy smaller
than its energy gap and make a contribution to produce very small photocurrent
in this wavelength region. When sensitized by OXZ-PER, the maximum IPCE
of the cell in the UV region reached 12% (at 370 nm). In the visible
region the maximum IPCE at 540 nm reached 10.5%. The photocurrent was
drastically broadened to a wide visible light region covering 400 to 650 nm.
Since IPCE values are not corrected for the loss owing to incident light scattering
by the glass support, the energy conversion at the maximum IPCE for the dyed
nano-SnO2 should in fact be higher. After one month storage
in dark, the cell sensitized by OXZ-PER still shows short-circuit
photocurrent of 500 mA cm−2. Fig. 9  Photocurrent action
spectra of OXZ-PER dye-sensitized (curve a) and unsensitized SnO2
porous films (curve b). Insert figure: photovoltage–current characteristics
of the cell based on dye-sensitized SnO2 nanostructured electrode. The above special sensitization effect of photoelectrical performance of
the cell can be explained in terms of the band models shown in Fig. 2.
The band bending resulting from the organic–inorganic p–n heterojunction,
facilitates electron injection from the excited state of OXZ-PER into
the conduction band of the SnO2 semiconductor. The band energies
of SnO2,4 oxadiazole unit14,19 and perylene unit5,15
can be taken from the appropriate references. The LUMO level of the oxadiazole
unit and perylene unit in OXZ-PER dye is higher than the conduction band
of SnO2. This means that the excited level (LUMO) of the oxadiazole
unit and perylene unit matches the conduction band position of nanocrystalline
SnO2. When irradiating under white light, the electrons were excited
from the HOMO orbital (−5.9 eV) to the LUMO orbital (−3.9 eV)
of the perylene unit and then injected from the LUMO orbital of the perylene
unit into the conduction band of SnO2 (−4.73 eV).
For the oxadiazole unit, a similar electron transfer exists. However, the
electrons of the LUMO orbital of oxadiazole unit have two possible approaches
to inject into the conduction band of SnO2. One is direct electron
injection from the LUMO orbital of the oxadiazole unit (−2.5 eV)
into the conduction band of SnO2. Another is indirect electron
injection from the LUMO orbital of the oxadiazole unit via the LUMO
orbital (−3.9 eV) of the perylene unit into the conduction band
of SnO2. That is, there exist the energy transfer and/or electron
transfer from the oxadiazole unit to the perylene unit at first. Then, the
electrons inject from the LUMO orbital of the perylene unit into the conduction
band of SnO2. In addition, a redox electrolyte (I3−/I−)
is used to mediate charge transfer between the electrons and to regenerate
the sensitizer. As a consequence, a drastic photoresponse with wide spectral
sensitization (from 310 to 700 nm) is achieved. In fact, the role of
SnO2 in the liquid junction cell based on the OXZ-PER is merely
to conduct the injected electrons.Because of the improved solubility of the T-PTCA series in common organic
solvents, the adsorption of dyes onto the SnO2 film should be improved.
The absorption spectra of the T-PTCA7 dye sensitized SnO2 electrode
were very similar to that of dye film. This means that there is little or
no interaction between chromophores connected with saturated covalent bonds
in their ground state even in the adsorbed state, so that their individual
absorption characteristics should be maintained for T-PTCA7. On the other
hand, because of steric constraints, the carboxylic acid groups on the phenyl
ring are oriented perpendicular to the perylene ring system. The poor photosensitization
(a relative small photocurrent density of ∼100 mA cm−2)
obtained for this kind of dye (T-PTCA series) may be related to its orientation
on the surface of the SnO2 particles. When sensitized by T-PTCA7,
the maximum IPCE of the cell in the visible region reached 24% (at 500 nm).
The photocurrent was drastically broadened to a wide visible light region
covering 400 to 600 nm, as shown in Fig. 10.
As the comparison system, the photocurrent response of the T-PTCA8 dye
sensitized nano-structured TiO2 electrode was determined, which
were shown in Fig. 11. As seen in Fig. 11, the photon-to-current quantum
yields in the visible region for T-PTCA8 sensitized TiO2 film
were very small. This may result from the poor adsorption of the dye on the
surface of the TiO2. The results indicated that only the carboxylic
acid group is effective for the adsorption onto the surface of SnO2
and TiO2 nanoparticles. The other groups such as hydroxy would
influence the adsorption, so consequently result in a poor photosensitization.
In Fig. 10 and 11, the photoresponses
of the cells shown by the thick lines were obtained after two hours exposure
to white light (200 W Hg lamp). The results show relative better photostability
of the perylenes synthesized in the study. Fig. 10  Perylene T-PCTA7
adsorbed on nanoporous SnO2 electrode.  Fig. 11  IPCE spectra of perylene
T-PCTA8 adsorbed on nanoporous TiO2 electrode. In addition, due to the good solubility of the T-PTCA series compounds
in organic solvents, the oxidation potential of these compounds can be obtained
by the measurements of solution electrochemistry. The oxidation potential
of a commercially available N,N′-bis(2,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxydiimide
is +1.66 V vs. SCE in CH2Cl2. The very
positive oxidation potential is thermodynamically capable of driving the water
oxidation reaction at appropriate pH. The oxidation potential of T-PTCA
series synthesized in this study were between +1.00 and +1.60 V (SCE),
which should be a substantial over-potential for water oxidation (+0.63 V vs.
SCE at pH 7).4 The perylene dyes presented
here may be useful in water-splitting dye-sensitized solar cells.In summary, we have found a novel route to design highly efficient sensitizers
for Grätzel-type solar cells, which can avoid the complication of
doping. Two series of new multi-chromophoric perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride dyes for solar cell sensitizer have been synthesized. One series
consists of oxadiazole or naphthaldicarboximides linked by perylene units
as N,N′-substituted chromophores. The other series
has four substituents in the bay-region of the perylene core besides N,N′-substituents.
The latter series of T-PTCA compounds have surprisingly good solubility
in common organic solvents, in addition to good photo- and thermal-stability.
In the dye sensitized SnO2 system, a wide spectral photoresponse
(from 310 to 700 nm) was observed for these novel multi-chromophoric
dyes. In addition, the sensitization is dependent on the energy match of the
energy bands of the semiconductor and the redox potentials of the segments
in such assembled dyes.AcknowledgementsThis project was supported by NSFC/China and
