Introduction
Increased industrial activity has created huge demands on the energy sector. Conventional sources of energy such as coal, radioactive ore and oil, however, are slowly being depleted, and will one day become completely exhausted. Intensive research about materials capable of solving this problem is being carried out, and this research has resulted in non-conventional methods for the production of energy such as silicon solar cells, thermoelectric devices, photovoltaic cells, and dye-sensitized solar cells. The effective utilization of energy produced in these ways, however, will require the adequate storage of such energy. Extensive investigations are being carried out to identify electrode materials with sufficient storage capacity and improved efficiency. Nanosized metal oxides and their composites have been reported to have electronic properties with excellent recyclability due to their extended surface areas and good photocatalytic activity.1 It has also been reported (in a review) that transition metal oxides have the potential to overcome the low energy density limitations of electrochemical capacitors.2 The discovery of graphene, which is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms with a perfect sp2-hybridized two-dimensional structure,3,4 has led researchers to investigate composites of graphene with other nanomaterials such as noble metals, complex oxides and metal oxides.5–9 Among them, graphene-metal oxide composites have attracted particularly considerable attention as a viable way to boost the efficiency of various catalytic and storage reactions in energy conversion applications.10
Ceria (CeO2) is a promising rare earth oxide material widely studied for many technological applications.11–14 In particular, defects such as oxygen vacancies in CeO2 play a crucial role in catalytic properties, as these oxygen vacancies can be easily formed and removed rapidly. The oxygen vacancies in CeO2 determine the ratio of Ce3+ to Ce4+, and an increased level of Ce4+ leads to an enhanced visible photocatalytic activity by narrowing the bandgap of CeO2. Oxygen vacancies in CeO2 are highly reactive with graphene, and such high reactivity promotes the formation of the graphene-CeO2 (CeO2G) nanocomposite. This composite would appear to be an interesting material with improved photocatalytic and electrochemical properties. However, the photocatalytic and electrochemical properties of composites of graphene with rare earth oxides have hardly been investigated.15–17 Jiang et al.15 reported the optical and catalytic properties of CeO2, and G. Wang et al.16 reported the electrochemical properties of CeO2G nanocomposites. However, in both studies, the composites were prepared at a fixed ratio of their components, the electrochemical studies were performed at a single scan rate, and the results were not discussed in detail. To understand the effect of graphene on the electrochemical properties of CeO2, it is essential to vary the graphene content. Therefore, further investigation is needed to understand the enhanced electrochemical properties of CeO2G composites.
In the present work, CeO2G nanocomposites were synthesized with different weight percentages of graphene by using the modified Hummer's method. The nanocomposites were characterized by various analytical techniques for structural, compositional and morphological analysis. The electrochemical performance of the composites was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge studies, and the results are discussed.
Experimental techniques
Synthesis of graphene and graphene-CeO2 nanocomposites
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite powder by the modified Hummer's method as described in our earlier report.18 Then, the GO was reduced using thiourea as a reducing agent to synthesize the graphene. Typically, 100 mg of GO was dispersed in 100 ml of water by applying ultrasonication for 1 h, and 100 mg of thiourea was added to the dispersion. The solution was maintained at 100 °C with constant stirring for 24 h. The brown GO was converted to the black graphene due to the reduction process. Finally the graphene was washed with ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h.
To prepare the CeO2G1 composite, 99 mg of as purchased cerium oxide (CeO2) (99.9%) was dispersed in 100 ml of water by applying ultrasonication, and 1 mg of reduced graphene was added to the dispersion. Then, the solution was maintained at room temperature with constant stirring for 2 h. The final CeO2G1 product was collected and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. Using the same procedure, a CeO2G composite with 3 mg of graphene and 97 mg of CeO2 was prepared and named CeO2G3; another nanocomposite, named CeO2G5, was also prepared using this procedure, but with 5 mg of graphene and 95 mg of CeO2. The influence of graphene on the structural and electrochemical properties of the composites was evaluated using various analytical techniques.
Characterization techniques
The CeO2G nanocomposites were characterized using various analytical techniques. A Rigaku MiniFlexII-C X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.540 nm) radiation at a scanning rate of 1° min−1 was used to collect the powder X-ray diffraction data, which were used to identify the material. To confirm the formation of the composites, Raman and FTIR spectra were recorded using a JASCO Raman spectrophotometer (NRS – 7100) and NICOLET infrared spectrophotometer, respectively. The morphologies of the composites were analyzed using FESEM and HRTEM images obtained by JEOL 7001F and JEOL-JEM 2100F electron microscopes, respectively. The elemental composition was analyzed by elemental mapping and EDS spectra were obtained by using a JEOL JXA-8530F model field emission electron probe micro-analyzer (FE-EPMA) instrument. The electron-binding energies of various elements in the composites were analyzed by using an ESCA 3400 SHIMADZU X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The electrochemical performance of the composites was investigated by using a three-electrode system with a Bio-Logic electrochemical workstation. Glassy carbon, Ag/AgCl and a platinum wire were used as working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. 1 M H2SO4 was used as an electrolyte and the cyclic voltammetric curves were recorded in the range from −0.3 to + 1.0 V at scan rates of 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
The synthesized graphene, pure CeO2, and CeO2G nanocomposites were subjected to powder X-ray diffraction studies, and the recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1a. The diffraction pattern of graphene was observed to contain only two peaks, corresponding to the 002 and 100 diffraction planes at two-theta values of 23.44 and 42.92 degrees, respectively. CeO2 and the CeO2G composites yielded diffraction patterns with many high-intensity peaks, confirming the good crystalline nature of the composites as well as of CeO2. The diffraction patterns were compared with the standard JCPDS #65-5923 for CeO2 and the peaks were indexed accordingly. From the patterns it was observed that the influence of graphene was not significant, as the quantity of graphene was small. Examination of magnifications of the diffraction peaks at various two-theta values showed that these peaks were noticeably shifted in the composites compared to pure CeO2 (see Fig. 1b) which, confirm that the composites were formed. Laser Raman spectra were recorded in the range of 800 to 2000 cm−1 for the graphene and for the CeO2G5 (Fig. 1c) and CeO2G1 (Fig. 1d) composites. The spectrum of pure graphene has two characteristic peaks, so-called D and G bands, at 1343 and 1577 cm−1, respectively as shown in Fig. 1c-2. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands, ID/IG, for graphene was measured to be 1.11, which is higher than that measured for GO (1.03) (Fig. 1e). Hence, the graphene reduced from GO ensured the sp2-bonded carbon. On the other hand, the CeO2G5 composite yielded an additional strong peak at 1161 cm−1 due to the presence of CeO2 in addition to the D and G bands of graphene (Fig. 1c-1). The Raman spectrum of CeO2G1 was also recorded and an intense peak at 1163 cm−1 was observed here due to CeO2, and very weak signals were observed for D and G bands of graphene (Fig. 1d). This spectrum confirms the small amount of graphene in this composite. The observed band shift, increased intensity and additional peaks in Fig. 1c provide evidence for the formation of the CeO2G5 composite.

The morphologies of the prepared composites were studied using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and the images are shown in Fig. 2a–d. CeO2G1 was observed to contain graphene sheets, and CeO2 was observed to be intercalated between the graphene sheets, as shown in Fig. 2a. A high-magnification image (Fig. 2b) confirms the “wrinkled paper”-like structure of graphene with CeO2 attached on the surface. The morphology of the CeO2G5 composite is shown in Fig. 2c. The increase in the weight percent of graphene here apparently caused the aggregation of CeO2 with graphene, and hence the graphene adopted an irregular flake-like morphology as shown in the magnified image (Fig. 2d).

HRTEM images of CeO2G5 at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3a–d. CeO2 crystals with sizes ranging from 100–250 nm were observed to be distributed on the surface of the graphene sheets, as marked in Fig. 3a. At different graphene layer depths, however, the sizes of the particles could be inferred from the higher-magnification image (Fig. 3b) to be around 10–50 nm. Fig. 3c shows the folded graphene sheets at the 50 nm scale, and the marked region is shown at a 5 nm scale in Fig. 3d. Higher-magnification images taken at the 5–10 mm scale of the marked regions of Fig. 3b are shown in Fig. 3e–g. The rectangular mark shows a thick bunch of graphene sheets, which did not yield a lattice fringe pattern, as shown in Fig. 3e. The region marked by the continuous circle has bright lattice fringes as shown in Fig. 3f, which confirms the presence of CeO2 underneath the graphene layer. The region marked by the dotted circle has clearly visible bright fringes (Fig. 3g), confirming that CeO2 became situated on top of the graphene sheet. These images provide effective supporting evidence that the composited formed. Moreover, a 5 nm-thick slab of 15 graphene sheets was observed (Fig. 3h), confirming the effective synthesis of graphene using this method.

The composites were also subjected to field emission electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) and the elemental mapping was recorded. The EPMA mapping and corresponding energy dispersive spectrum for the CeO2G5 composite is shown in Fig. 4. The EPMA and EDX spectrum of the CeO2G1 composite were also recorded and are shown in ESI (Fig. S1†). A systematic increase of the carbon content was observed in the composites from CeO2G1 to CeO2G5. A uniform distribution of carbon, oxygen and cerium elements was observed in the composites. The energy dispersive spectra also confirm the presence of all elements in the composites.

The CeO2G5 composite was analyzed by producing XPS spectra of various elements as shown in Fig. 5a–d. Fig. 5a shows the 3d electron core level spectrum of cerium in the 875–920 eV region. The XPS spectrum consists of three distinct signals corresponding to different ionic states of Ce3+ and Ce4+. The characteristic XPS signals of Ce3+, 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 electron states were observed at 886 and 905 eV, respectively, i.e., with a separation of 9 eV. The additional satellite signal is due to the 3d3/2 electron state of Ce4+ at 919 eV. The core level spectrum of the 4p electron of cerium in the 200–240 eV region is shown in Fig. 5b. The spectrum was observed to contain two peaks, corresponding to the 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 states at 210.3 and 227.6 eV, respectively. The recorded spectra revealed the presence of mixed valence cerium, i.e., of Ce3+ and Ce4+. The main peaks observed at 886 and 919 eV represent the relative amount of Ce3+ and Ce4+ present in the sample. From the area of the respective peaks, it is obvious that the concentration of Ce3+ was relatively higher in the samples analyzed, which confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies in CeO2. The binding energy difference between these two states was measured to be 17.3 eV, which is in good agreement with the standard values.19 The sample yielded a prominent signal at 284.3 eV and a satellite peak at 289.4 eV in the core level XPS spectrum of the C 1s electron, as shown in Fig. 5c. The former is due to sp2-bonded carbon (C–C) and the latter to carboxyls (C–CO), which indicates a reasonable amount of oxygen-containing functional groups attached to the carbon.19 Two different oxygen species could be distinguished in the deconvolution of the core level spectrum of the O1s electron in the range between 525 and 540 eV as shown in Fig. 5d. The binding energies of 530.5 and 531.8 eV were assigned to lattice oxygen and carboxyl groups, respectively.14

Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the capacitance of pure CeO2 and CeO2G with various amounts of graphene at different scan rates. Fig. 6 shows the cyclic voltammogram results of (a) pure CeO2, (b) CeO2G1, (c) CeO2G3 and (d) CeO2G5 in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6a, the pure CeO2 electrode displayed capacitive-like responses in the potential window of the investigation. As compared to other electrodes (Fig. 6b and c), the CeO2G5 electrode demonstrated the highest current response with an obvious double-layer current in the potential range of −0.3 to +1.0 V, as shown in Fig. 6d. The cyclic voltammograms of the nanocomposites at a fixed scan rate are plotted in Fig. 6e, which shows that the double-layer current response has increased for the nanocomposite, when the relative amount of graphene has increased. The specific capacitance values for CeO2 and CeO2G composites were calculated from the areas under the cyclic voltammogram curves for different scan rates by using eqn (1): Cs = ∫IdV/vmV(1)where I is the response current, V is the potential, v is the potential scan rate and m is the mass of the active material of the electrode. The calculated specific capacitance was plotted as a function of scanning rates (Fig. 7a). The specific capacitance was observed to decrease with the increase of scan rates from 10 to 100 mV s−1. The specific capacitance of the CeO2G5 sample was measured to be much higher than that of pure CeO2 and other composites with low graphene content at the same scan rates. The specific capacitance of 109 F g−1 was observed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 for the CeO2G5 composite, compared to 87 F g−1 for the CeO2G1 composite and 75 F g−1 for pure CeO2. The specific capacitance of the CeO2G5 samples were observed to decrease from 109 to 35 F g−1 as the scan rate was increased from 10 to 100 mV s−1, representing only a 68% decrease, whereas an 80% reduction was observed for the pure CeO2. With increasing scan rate, the specific capacitance was observed to decrease gradually (Fig. 7a) and this gradual decrease can be attributed to the facile diffusion and migration of the electrolytic ions into the active materials at the low scan rates. At high scan rates, the diffusion is controlled, limiting the migration of the electrolytic ions, which causes some active surface areas to become inaccessible for charge storage.

Fig. 7b shows the relationship between the oxidation peak current at different scan rates and the square root of the scan rate, which gives the information about the electrochemical kinetics of the reaction. In general, the electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) reaction is a diffusion-controlled process and the corresponding CV curve is rectangular in shape, and therefore the I-vs.-V1/2 graph derived from this capacitive region is linear. For the CeO2-G nanocomposite, the enhanced specific capacitance is attributed to the combination of both EDLC and faradaic reactions. The faradaic reaction (electron transfer across the electrode electrolyte interface) caused by the presence of CeO2 may follow two possible types of process: (1) a kinetically controlled process and (2) a diffusion-controlled process. A linear relationship between I and V1/2 was determined for the corresponding oxidative peak current of the CeO2-G composite (Fig. 7b). The graphene present in the composite might have enhanced the fast electron transport, and hence facilitated the charge transport kinetics of the faradaic reaction. Therefore, it is concluded that the corresponding faradaic reaction is an entirely diffusion-limited process rather than a kinetically controlled process. Furthermore, our experimental results also demonstrate that the composite with high graphene content (CeO2G5) is a better electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were also carried out on the pure CeO2, and the CeO2G1, CeO2G3 and CeO2G5 composite materials, and the results are shown in Fig. 8a. The charging curves were observed to be symmetrical to their corresponding discharge counterparts. This observation indicates the excellent electrochemical reversible charge–discharge properties. Moreover, the duration of charge–discharge increased drastically when the graphene content was increased, indicating the enhanced specific capacitance of the composites. The specific energy and specific power of the electrode material were calculated using the following equations: E = 1/2 × Cs × (ΔV)2(2) P = E/Δt(3)where Cs is the specific capacitance calculated from the CV curves, ΔV is the operating voltage of the cell and Δt is the discharge time.20–22 The calculated values are tabulated (Table 1) for pure CeO2 and the composite materials. The specific energy was observed to increase and specific power was observed to decrease when the graphene content was increased in the composite material. The specific energy of CeO2G5 (92.1 Wh kg−1) was nearly three times higher than that of pure CeO2 (33.13 Wh kg−1).

Furthermore, the capacitive performances of the pure CeO2 and of the CeO2G5 composites were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The measurements were performed at a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 Hz. A linear region with an absence of a semicircle region was observed in each of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 8b), which shows the low charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface.23 The combined resistance, including the ionic resistance of the electrolyte, the intrinsic resistance of the substrate and the contact resistance at the interface of the active material/current collector, can be obtained from the intercept of the linear part of the Nyquist plot. The combined resistances of the pure and composite materials were determined (Fig. 8b) to be almost the same, probably due to low graphene content in the composite material.
Conclusion
Graphene-CeO2 nanocomposites were prepared with different weight percents of graphene using a low-temperature solution process. Structural properties of the nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. Laser Raman spectral analyses were carried out to confirm the formation of nanocomposites. The morphologies of the synthesized compounds were studied by analyzing FESEM and HRTEM images. Systematic variation of the carbon level in the composites was observed by elemental mapping and by using the FE-EPMA technique. The binding states of various elements of the composites were studied by XPS analysis. The electrochemical studies show good capacitance behavior for the CeO2G5 nanocomposite, with its specific capacitance (at 109 F g−1) higher than that of pure CeO2 (at 75 F g−1).
