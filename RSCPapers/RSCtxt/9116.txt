    , Accepted 5th August 2022First published on 8th August 2022AbstractA series of novel sulfone-modified benzosilole and dithienobenzosilole luminogens were synthesized via straightforward chemical oxidation of the corresponding methylthio or thiophene precursors. The intrinsic photophysical properties, photo-stability and thermal stability of these luminogens were systematically studied by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy assisted with theoretical calculations. High thermal stability and remarkable photo-stability have been demonstrated and mainly attributed to the benzosilole core, while the negative inductive effect originating from sulfone groups endows them with strong electron affinity. With significant modulated energy gaps, these compounds exhibit a broad range of fluorescence colors from blue to orange red and high brightness as well as extremely high quantum yields up to 99% in solution and the solid state due to the competition between the localized excited and charge transfer electron transitions. The intriguing photophysical characteristics enabled them to be applied in reversible acid-base chemical vapor detection, latent fingerprints, and live-cell imaging.
Introduction
Organic conjugated molecules possessing high emission efficiency, a wide variety of fluorescence colors and persistent photostability have been sought after for decades due to their widespread applications in the fields of biological imaging,1,2 chemosensors, optoelectronic materials,3 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),4,5 solar cells,6etc. Hitherto, as the last key issue of this research field, the development of blue and deep blue fluorophores with high fluorescence quantum yield and stability has achieved substantial advancements by using heteroatom-bridged π-conjugated systems.7,8 In particular, intensive research on silicon-bridged biaryls, such as benzosiloles,9–12 has demonstrated to be effective because they usually feature high electron transport, improved thermal stability, and outstanding photoluminescence properties.13 Deep insights into benzosiloles revealed that the incorporation of silicon atoms into π-conjugated systems could considerably lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels via the distinctive σ*–π* conjugation.14–18 In addition, benzosilole derivatives have shown superior potential to the conventional fluorescent dyes in bio-imaging and fluorescent imaging technologies.19 A few facile and innovative synthetic strategies for benzosilole derivatives have been established for developing novel structures and functionalities in recent years.17,20–30 However, on the basis of the developed advantages, it still remains a great challenge to further improve the performance of benzosilole derivatives, that is, extending the fluorescence to longer wavelengths with high color purity and brightness, which is of vital importance to the currently widespread applications.31–35
On the other hand, the emission colors and brightness could be significantly tuned by grafting sulfone groups onto the conjugated molecules. Wolf and co-workers revealed that by gradually oxidizing the sulfur bridge from sulfide to sulfoxide and sulfone, the fluorescence quantum yields of sulfur-bridged organic chromophores were dramatically enhanced.36–38 Recently, the introduction of electron-withdrawing sulfone groups was further demonstrated to enable brightness and the electron affinity greatly improved and imparted excellent anti-oxidation properties to the modified molecules.39,40 In addition, it was proven that the negative inductive impact (−I effect) exerted by sulfone groups could enhance the ionization potential (IP) values, leading to the considerably increased quantum yields of various fluorophore families.41,42 Furthermore, controls of the sulfur oxidation states could be readily utilized to regulate the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics, electronic and photophysical properties, inter-chromophoric electron coupling, etc.37,38,43–47 Consequently, numerous sulfur oxidation state-dependent fluorescent materials as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules and ultra-long room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) organic molecules have been synthesized and investigated.48–52 Therefore, the engagement of the sulfone groups with the benzosiloles will make their merits complement mutually to generate highly desirable emissive materials with superior functionalities.
Our research has been focusing on the design and syntheses of highly stable and emissive benzosilole derivatives with extended π-conjugation and functional substituents for versatile applications.53–56 Very recently, a class of rigid rod-like dimethylthio-modified benzosiloles and butterfly-shaped dithienobenzosilole-based luminogens with excellent photoluminescence properties and outstanding thermal, photo, and photo-oxidation stability were developed.57,58 Herein, we report a straightforward chemical oxidation to synthesize various rigid rod-like sulfone substituted and ladder-type sulfone-fused benzosiloles with high electron affinity and photoluminescence brightness. The molecular structures, intrinsic photophysical properties, and thermal- and photo-stabilities have been investigated. The relationship of the molecular structures and the essential photophysical properties has been elucidated by systematical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, the potential applications of these novel fluorescent-labeled materials (FLMs) in chemical vapor detection, latent fingerprints (LFPs) in the forensic sector, and live-cell imaging have been verified as prominent alternatives to typical fluorescent dyes.
Results and discussion
Syntheses and characterizations
The procedure for synthetic sulfone-substituted and fused benzosilole derivatives 3a–3i is shown in Scheme 1. First, rigid rod-like dimethylthio-modified benzosiloles (3a-S–3d-S) and butterfly-shaped dithienobenzosiloles (3e-S–3i-S) were synthesized in multiple steps according to our previously reported methods, i.e., palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira or Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions and iodine-induced intramolecular electrophilic cyclization (IIIEC).57,58 The target luminogens, which are composed of the benzosilole core and various peripheral electron-donating groups, are then readily synthesized by one-step smooth oxidation of the sulfide precursors with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) in good yields (69.1–80.4%) under very mild conditions. Thus, the weak electron-donating sulfide can be in situ converted into strong electron-withdrawing sulfone groups, simultaneously avoiding the potentially reductive radical formation. These luminogens were fully characterized by using multinuclear (1H and 13C) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high resolution mass (HRMS), and infrared (IR) spectroscopies (Experimental section in the ESI†).

Single crystals of 3b, 3c, 3f, and 3i were grown in a mixture solution of dichloromethane (DCM) and ethanol by slow solvent evaporation, and analyzed by X-ray crystallography. Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†) illustrate the crystal structures and packing diagrams, and Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the detailed crystallographic data. Compounds 3b, 3c, and 3i crystallize in a monoclinic lattice with P21/c, P2/n, and P21/n space groups, respectively, while compound 3f crystallizes in an orthorhombic lattice with a Pcca space group. The Si–C(Ar) bonds in 3b, 3c, 3f, and 3i exhibit comparable distances of 1.867–1.885 Å. The angles of the C(Ar)–Si–C(Ar) bonds are 90.41°, 90.16°, 91.16°, and 90.78°, respectively, which are very consistent with the reported analogs, implying that the oxidation reaction has little effect on the parent benzosilole cores.57,58 The torsion angles between the benzosilole core and the peripheral aromatic rings are (10.88°, 10.34°), (12.10°, 12.10°), and (10.45°, 15.38°) for 3b, 3c, and 3f, respectively, demonstrating the potential efficient π-conjugation extension, but they are obviously increased to (44.11°, 49.16°) for 3i. Furthermore, the torsion angles between the benzosilole core and the β-arylacetylene groups are 35.47° and 15.33°, indicating that the introduction of the β-arylacetylene groups results in severe steric congestion (Fig. 1).59 The peripherally rotatable substituents have a great impact on the molecular packing pattern and tightness. It is interesting to find that compounds 3b–3c linked by ethynyl groups self-adapt entirely coplanar skeletons in the crystals leading to very close packing, while oxidation of the sulfur into sulfone groups has little effect on the configuration and stacking modes.57,58 The extended coplanar planes of 3b and 3c are parallel with the very close interplanar distances of 3.539 and 3.620 Å in the crystals, respectively, whereas compounds 3f and 3i feature a bent dithienobenzosilole core indicating that highly condensed cyclization and the polar sulfone groups may be conducive to causing molecular structural warping and thus reducing intermolecular π–π interactions (Fig. S2, ESI†).60

Optical properties
The photophysical properties of these compounds in solution and the solid state were investigated by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†) and the detailed photophysical data are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 3a–3i are variable greatly in different solvents such as DCM and THF. All the compounds exhibit absorption maxima at 381–483 nm with very large extinction coefficients (2.16–10.70 × 104 mol−1 L cm−1) which are attributable to π → π* transition of the central extended π-conjugations, while the intense absorptions in the range of 302–383 nm (1.92–8.40 × 104 mol−1 L cm−1) are characteristic of dibenzosilole absorbance transitions. With the increase of electron donation from p-methoxyphenyl of 3a to aminophenyl substituents of 3d as chromophores, the absorption maxima show evident red shifts up to 52 nm in THF, indicating that the energy gaps have greatly narrowed. The same trend appears in the absorption maxima of 3e–3f. It is notable that there is an obvious but weak n → π* transition of the sulfone groups at ca. 590–630 nm (0.10–0.34 × 104 mol−1 L cm−1) in the spectra depending on various solvents (Fig. S3–S5 and Table S2, ESI†). In addition, the absorption spectra of these compounds exhibit a certain degree of solvent polarity effect, resulting in splendid emissions which also involve the specific n → π* transitions of the sulfone groups at longer wavelengths. In comparison to their precursor showing the absence of an ICT effect, the converted sulfone groups with strong electron-withdrawing capability can effectively reshape the dipole moments of these molecules, endowing them with the desired ICT effect.44,58 Thus, the energy gaps of these benzosilole derivatives can be dramatically modulated by the introduction of the sulfone groups and further fine-tuned by the peripheral electron-donating groups.

The emissions of 3a–3i in the solution state were investigated using photoluminescence spectra in various polar solvents (Fig. 2b–d and Fig. S3–S5, Table 1 and Table S2, ESI†). All new luminogens (3a–3i) exhibit intense emissions with λmax of 423–568 nm, corresponding to blue to orange emission colors (Fig. 2e and f and Fig. S6–S10, ESI†), as well as quantum yields (QYs) in the range of 43–99% under air at room temperature. Notably, as shown in Fig. 2c, d and f, the fluorescence emissions of 3d and 3g are very sensitive to the solvents thanks to the generated sulfone groups, showing great potential for molecular probes of common solvents.
The photoluminescence decay curves of 3a–3i measured in DCM and THF are shown in Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI†). The emission spectra of 3a–3d in DCM feature broad bands with λmax (lifetime, QY) of 458 nm (τ = 0.62 ns, 84%), 447 nm (τ = 0.63 ns, 96%), 531 nm (τ = 2.59 ns, 80%) and 537 nm (τ = 2.80 ns, 87%), respectively. Comparatively, in THF solution, a slight change is obtained, i.e., 423 nm (τ = 0.61 ns, 88%), 442 nm (τ = 0.62 ns, 97%), 541 nm (τ = 2.74 ns, 70%) and 529 nm (τ = 2.66 ns, 77%) for 3a–3d, respectively. Moreover, after fusing the sulfone moieties, the emission spectra of 3e–3g in DCM manifest broad red-shifted bands with λmax (lifetime, QY) of 479–568 nm (τ = 2.37–3.11 ns, 43–91%) whereas in THF slightly blue-shifted emissions with curtailed lifetimes are obtained at 473–558 nm (τ = 2.36–2.84 ns, 43–99%). In particular, compound 3e exhibits the highest quantum yield of 99.2% in THF. The emission spectra of 3h and 3i in DCM show broad bands with λmax (lifetime, QY) of 515 nm (τ = 3.62 ns, 49%) and 526 nm (τ = 4.48 ns, 62%), respectively, and similar features of λmax (lifetime, QY) at 504 nm (τ = 3.51 ns, 56%) and 517 nm (τ = 4.28 ns, 62%) in THF. Compared with 3f, its derivatives 3h and 3i show obvious blue shifts and hypochromic effects in absorption and a considerable decrease in fluorescence, indicating that further anchoring the blades on the periphery is possibly detrimental to the π-conjugation extension and radiative transitions.
The radiative rate constants (kr), non-radiative rate constants (knr), and fluorescence brightness (B) of 3a–3i were calculated by the fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF), lifetime (τ) and molar extinction coefficient (εmax), and the data were summarized in Table 1. The kr of compounds 3a–3f is much greater than the knr while the proportion of knr is a little higher than the kr for compound 3g due to the very strong ICT character. It is rational that 3h and 3i with more vibrational substituents and higher steric hindrance result in increased knr. Additionally, after conversion of the thio groups into sulfone moieties, the fluorescence brightness (B) significantly increases, which is affected jointly by the ΦF and εmax.
The photoluminescence spectra, decay curves and quantum yield (ΦF) in the powder state were tested and the data are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S13–S15 (ESI†), and Table 1. The normalized emission maxima of 3a–3i powders range from 492 to 577 nm irrelevant to the excitation wavelengths. The emission maxima of these luminogens are red-shifted compared to the corresponding emission maxima in solution, whereas the fluorescence ΦF decreases significantly to 2–11% due to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect.57,58 Notably, the Commission Internationale de L′Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates of these luminogens in solution cross over from the deep-blue to orange-yellow emission region, whereas the CIE color coordinates of their powders fall within the green, yellow, and orange emission region with good and stable color purity (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†).

To determine the redox potentials of these luminogens, their electrochemical properties were studied. As illustrated in Fig. S18 (ESI†), luminogens with stronger donating groups of N,N-dimethylamino or TPA possess smaller oxidation potential, i.e., higher HOMO levels than that of the luminogens with p-methoxyphenyl substituents. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO are determined using oxidization onsets (Eox) and optical bandgaps (Eg). As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI†), all luminogens exhibit irreversible oxidation onset peaks at ca. 0.65 V, which could be attributed to the irreversible single-electron oxidation caused by the σ*(Si)–π*(C) interaction in the Si-bridged species.61 The associated electrochemical gaps fall in the range of 2.22–2.95 eV, which is lower than that of the sulfuric precursors 3a-S–3i-S to some extent (Fig. S19, ESI†). The HOMO energy levels of 3a–3i are between −6.02 eV and −6.38 eV, while the LUMO energy levels are in the range of −3.43 to −4.05 eV (Fig. S20, ESI†). One simple step oxidation of the sulfide benzosilole to the corresponding sulfone compounds can modulate both the HOMO and the LUMO considerably. It is notable that 3g compared with its precursor 3g-S shows an increased HOMO and dramatically decreased LUMO, resulting in the narrowest energy gap of 2.22 eV decreasing from 2.76 eV of 3g-S (Fig. S20, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Experimental energy level diagram and optical bandgaps of the frontier orbitals of 3a–3i. 
To elucidate the intrinsic relationships between molecular structure and photophysical properties, the DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD–DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 package with the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) basis set to obtain geometry-optimized structures and frontier molecular orbital information.62 The results of electronic absorption spectroscopy are shown in Fig. S21–S23 (ESI†) and the data are summarized in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†). It is remarkable that the calculated values of the absorption maxima are consistent with the experimental data, with a minimum deviation of only 0.5% between the calculated and experimental values. Given that TD–DFT calculations demonstrate that all of the luminogens 3a–3i have an S0 → S1 excitation with a contribution of 84.9–98.8% from HOMO–LUMO transitions, it is rational to evaluate their absorptions using the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Fig. 5 illustrates the calculated frontier molecular orbital (MO) energy levels for 3a–3i. The contours of MOs are illustrated in Fig. S24 and S25 (ESI†) with the electrostatic potential maps. Thus, the theoretical energy gaps (Eg) of 3a–3i are in the range of 2.50–3.22 eV, which is larger than the experimental values but the variation trends display a good agreement and are also smaller to different extents than that of the sulfuric precursors 3a-S–3i-S (Fig. S26, ESI†). The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies range between −5.88/−5.02 and −2.82/−2.17 eV, with the LUMO energies being substantially lower than those of 3a-S–3i-S (Fig. S27, ESI†). Likewise, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of luminogens 3a–3i are much higher than that of the luminogens 3a-S–3i-S (Fig. S28, ESI†). On the one hand, the HOMOs of 3a–3i appear to be delocalized along their entire π-conjugated molecular backbones. On the other hand, their LUMOs show nearly the same electron distributions on the whole sulfone dibenzosilole or dithienobenzosilole moieties, with the exception of compounds 3c, 3d, 3g, and 3i, suggesting the potential existence of ICT nature (Fig. S24 and 25, ESI†). The charge transfer states are generally more stable than the localized excited (LE) states and exhibit broad photoluminescence spectra due to a great variety of structural configurations. The polar sulfone groups are mainly involved in the LUMOs and the substituents attached to S,S-dioxides dithienobenzosilole have a significant effect on the LUMOs especially for compounds 3e–3i. Thus, the negative inductive effect (−I effect) exerted by electron-withdrawing sulfone groups could dramatically tailor their electronic structures and subsequently as a result, cause the ICT, improving the fluorescence quantum yield and brightness of this benzosilole molecular system.

Thermal stability and photo-stability investigations
It has been well proven that the incorporation of Si atoms into organic molecules could considerably improve the thermal stability, which is important for fluorophores in practical applications.63 The thermal stability of these luminogens was verified by comparing the fluorescence spectra of the 3a–3i powder samples after annealing in the air for 15 hours at 200 °C with the pristine samples. The absence of new emission bands or low-energy green emissions in the normalized fluorescence spectra of the annealed 3a–3i samples indicates that the sulfone substituted benzosilole derivatives possess good thermal stability (Fig. S29, ESI†).
On the other hand, photostability is of vital importance in virtue of various visualization applications involving light radiation. The photostability of 3c, 3d, 3f, 3g, 3h, and 3i was examined by monitoring the changes in absorption and fluorescence intensity as a function of irradiation time in DCM solutions (5.0 × 10−6 M) when exposed to UV light at 365 nm (power density = 86.5 mW cm−2). As the duration of UV irradiation increases, compounds 3c and 3g exhibit a noticeable propensity to decrease absorption and emission intensity, accompanied by conspicuous shifts, while the spectra for 3d, 3f, 3h, and 3i remain almost intact (Fig. 6 and Fig. S30, S31, ESI†). The resulting absorption values correlated to the conversions are found to fit the pseudo-first-order kinetic model very well. The profiles of the irradiation time-dependent absorption and integrated fluorescence intensity are shown in Fig. S32 (ESI†). The half-lives estimated by the kinetic rate constants using the absorption irradiation-time plot for 3c, 3d, 3f, 3g, 3h, and 3i are 36.3, 666.3, 6947.9, 49.6, 3985.0, and 1737.5 min, respectively, implying that the photostability follows the order of 3f > 3h > 3i > 3d > 3g ≈ 3c (Fig. S32a, ESI†). This indicates that the strong electron-withdrawing sulfone substituents are conducive to maintaining the photostability of the benzosilole-based luminogens except for compounds 3c and 3g. The reasons for the poor photo- and photo-oxidization stability are that compounds 3c and 3g with amino groups can be readily excited to the first singlet state and then react with the triplet ground state oxygen molecules via a single electron transfer (ET) or energy transfer pathway, illustrated by the time-dependent 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S33, ESI†).57 Compared with the reported rubrene and multi-acene derivatives, overall the benzosilole sulfone-based luminogens not only exhibit outstanding thermal stability but also possess photo- and photo-oxidization stability.64,65

Fluorescence visualization applications
Based on the prominent photophysical properties, compounds 3b, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, and 3i were selected to investigate their potential bioimaging application. Their biocompatibility and cytotoxicity were determined using the MTT cell viability assay in HeLa cells. Within 24 hours of incubation, the MTT assay revealed very low cytotoxicity, i.e., over 85% cell viability, suggesting good biocompatibility (Fig. S34, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S35 (ESI†), compounds 3b, 3e, and 3f were found to be cell-impermeable due to their low water solubility with essentially little detectable intracellular fluorescence being observed. In contrast, compounds 3d, 3g, and 3i were able to cross the cell membrane and achieve intense green fluorescence in the cytoplasm thanks to the nitrogen containing triphenylamine and multi-methoxy groups. Therefore, by modulation of the introduced substituents the benzosilole-based luminogens can possess improved biocompatibility, and reduced cytotoxicity engaging with advanced photophysical properties, providing superior alternatives as fluorescent probes or biomarker dyes.

In general, the fluorescence spectra of the fluorophores with CT characteristics are extremely sensitive to their surrounding environment, including viscosity, hydrogen bonding, or protonation.66 When HBF4 is added to a solution of 3c, 3d, and 3g, a hypsochromic shift is observed for 3c but no obvious changes are observed for 3d and 3g due to incapable protonation of the triphenylamine (TPA) unit (Fig. S36, ESI†). The visible fluorescence changes can be recovered by titration of an organic base triethylamine (Fig. S37, ESI†). Due to this reversible acid-base reaction, it is promising to develop compound 3c as a visual chemical vapor probe. Exposure to HCl vapor within five seconds turned the color of a silica plate coated with 3c (“TJU” characters) from yellow to pale and the emission from orange to blue due to the amino groups being protonated (Fig. 8). Moreover, the color can be quickly switched back to the original state by exposing the plate to NH3 vapor. Similarly, this transformation is also achievable in an organic volatile acid-base environment (Fig. S38, ESI†).

Organic luminogenic molecules have played an important role as fluorescent vision materials, despite the fact that their photoluminescence is frequently attenuated or completely quenched when they reside in an aggregation state because of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).67,68 In particular, these benzosilole derivatives are highly emissive both in solution and the solid state. Nevertheless, when luminogens are on a solid surface, the fluorescence efficiency is increased by separating the dye from extrinsic perturbations such as SiO2 particles, hydrogels, and diatomite.69,70 Herein, the synthesized luminogens were doped into triglycerol monostearate (TG-18) hydrogel71 (4 wt‰ of doping ratio) (Fig. S39, ESI†) and pre-processed diatomite (0.1 wt‰ of doping ratio). The solid-state emission spectra of the diatomite composite were recorded and shown in Fig. S40 (ESI†). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a foam of non-fibrous precipitates in the loaded hydrogel and various morphologies in pre-processed diatomite (Fig. S41 and S42, ESI†). Subsequently, the fluorescent powders 3f@diatomite and 3i@diatomite were used for the visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) by the powder dusting method on various surfaces including a glass slide, zinc plate, copper plate, white ceramic tile, transparent plastic bag, wooden plank, and leather. The fluorescence images of the developed fingerprints showed luminous blue/blue-green color under UV illumination (365 nm) and demonstrated an excellent contrast between the fluorescent ridges and non-fluorescent furrows after air-blowing treatment of 3f@diatomite and 3i@diatomite (Fig. 9a and b), which were unambiguously visible by the naked eye. Generally, fingerprint characteristics can be classified into three grades.72 As illustrated in Fig. 9c and d, the fluorescence generated by 3f@diatomite and 3i@diatomite in the fingerprint patterns is highly resolved and identified as 1–3 clarity levels. The magnified images reveal a well-defined core and island pattern types (level 1). In addition, they exhibit level 2 characteristics of the patterns, i.e., bifurcation and ridge termination. And level 3 details are defined as all attributes of ridge characteristics including pores and other indestructible minutiae. Thus, as the benzosilole core significantly boosts the lipophilicity of the structures, and the benzosilole-based luminogens have tremendous promise for fingerprint detection as fluorescent labeling agents.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of sulfone-modified benzosilole and dithienobenzosilole luminogens were synthesized via smooth chemical oxidation by m-CPBA. Their molecular structures, intrinsic photophysical properties, and thermal and photo-stability were studied in detail supported by density functional theory. These benzosilole-based luminogens exhibit brilliant blue to reddish orange emissions with extremely high quantum yields of up to 0.99 in solution. The sulfone electron-withdrawing groups enabling a negative inductive effect provide an efficient modulation tool to improve the quantum yields and fluorescence brightness remarkably. The investigations of absorption and emission spectra indicate solvatochromism photoluminescence regulated by the competition between localized excited states and charge transfer states. Due to the benzosilole core, these benzosilole-based luminogens have prominent thermal stability and photo-stability. Moreover, these novel luminogens have been identified as superior fluorescent-labelling materials for use in multifunctional fluorescence visualization applications, such as chemical vapor detection, latent fingerprints (LFPs) in the forensic sector, and live-cell imaging. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the molecular design and synthesis of novel organic fluorescent-labeled materials with prominent properties for multifunctional practical applications.
