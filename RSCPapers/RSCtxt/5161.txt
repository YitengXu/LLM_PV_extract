, Accepted 24th June 2023First published on 27th June 2023AbstractMXenes, a family of superior 2D materials, have been intensively investigated because they have many promising properties, particularly high-performance energy storage and high flexibility. To approach the expected critical benchmarks of such materials, the strain dependence of the atomic structure is widely considered for tuning the related properties. In this work, by means of density functional theory, we demonstrate the potential application of the strained 2H phase of Mo2C-based MXenes (Mo2C and Mo2CO2) as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Adsorption and diffusion of Li on the surfaces of both materials and the impact of biaxial strain (εb) in the range of −4% to 4% are insightfully investigated. The lowest adsorption energy of Mo2C is −0.96 eV, and that of Mo2CO2 is −3.13 eV at εb = 0%. The diffusion of Li ions, considering the pathway between the first two most favorable adsorption sites, reveals that the biaxial strain refinement under compressive strain decreases the energy barrier, but the induction of tensile strain increases it in both MXenes. The ranges of the energy barriers of Li-ion adsorption on the surfaces of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 are 31–57 meV and 177–229 meV, respectively. Interestingly, the storage capacity of Li can reach three layers corresponding to a comparably high theoretical capacity of 788.61 mA h g−1 for Mo2C and 681.64 mA h g−1 for Mo2CO2. The atomic configurations are stable, as verified by the negative adsorption energy as well as the slightly distorted structures, by using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 400 K. Moreover, average open circuit voltages (OCVs) of 0.35 V and 0.63 V (at εb = 0%) are reported for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively. Furthermore, the tensile strain results in an increase in the OCVs, while compression has the opposite effect. These computational results provide some basic information on the behaviors of Li-ion adsorption and diffusion on Mo2C-based MXenes upon tuning biaxial strain. They also give a guideline on what conditions are appropriate for practically implementing these MXenes as electrode materials in LIBs.
1. Introduction
The demand for electrical energy has recently been increasing, particularly for portable and mobile devices. These types of use need electrical power to be stored in energy-storage devices such as batteries. Rechargeable batteries are suitable for meeting this demand, with the advantage of being moveable between locations. However, there are limitations with rechargeable batteries, including size, weight, and restrictive storage capacity, which are challenges for design and optimization. Therefore, a type of battery was invented and designed to be smaller and lightweight, and have a high storage capacity compared to traditional batteries. Among all energy-storage technologies, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) show an increasingly important role because they have a high specific energy (energy per unit weight) and energy density (energy per unit volume).1 Sony designed and invented LIBs for the first time in the early 1990s,2 providing superior performance to Ni–metal hydride, Ni–cadmium, and lead–acid batteries in terms of their light weight, high-capacity storage, and fast charge–discharge.
The important metal-ion battery components are the cathode, anode, and electrolytes.3 Considering the manufacture of metal-ion batteries, the two main methods that have gained the highest commercial interest are the rolling and folding of electrode materials for packing into cylindrical and square cases. The materials, of course, must be warped. Therefore, in manufacturing cathode and anode electrodes, the material's flexibility must be considered. Development of electronic devices with energy-storage capability coupled with flexibility has been applied to many technologies, such as foldable displays, solar cells, smart clothing, and even electrode materials in ion batteries. This is a new challenge for designing and manufacturing highly flexible devices. In addition, highly flexible materials for electrode materials must be lightweight and strong, and have high electrical conductivity, excellent ion mobility, high voltage, and several cycles of reusability. The above-mentioned properties can be found in some two-dimensional (2D) materials.4,5
Recently, 2D materials have been studied for application as anode materials in ion batteries, for example, p-BN2,6 p-BCN,7,8 and graphene.9 Moreover, it has been discovered that some 2D materials of the transition-metal carbide/nitride type with the chemical formula Mn+1Xn (where M is a transition metal, X is C or N, and n = 1, 2, or 3), known as MXenes,10 could be other promising electrode materials, with the outstanding properties of strength, high flexibility, and high conductivity.11–22 Therefore, MXenes have been widely investigated for implementation as electrode materials in ion batteries. Ti3O2, which is an outstanding MXene, has been intensively investigated as an electrode materials for LIBs, both theoretically and experimentally. Saha et al. developed a new experimental technique that enhances the surface of the Ti3O2Tx MXene, leading to a 17 mA h g−1 increase in capacity and improved cycling stability.23 In addition, according to Papadopoulou et al., Ti3O2Cl2 has a significantly low diffusion barrier (0.03 eV) for Li ions based on theoretical analysis.24 To increase the ion storage capacity, the lighter forms of MXenes, including Ti2C, Zr2C, Hf2C, Nb2C, and Mo2C, have also been considered for use as anode materials of LIBs. Cheng et al. investigated the potential of the Nb2CTx MXene as an anode material. By utilizing both experimental and computational approaches, they discovered that when combined with a LiFePO4/C cathode, Nb2CO2 led to improved rate capability and cycling stability in a battery cell.25 Moreover, Alli et al. successfully synthesized a nitrogen-doped Ti2C MXene/TiO2 hybrid that can be utilized as an anode material in Li-ion batteries. After 100 cycles, the electrode demonstrated a specific capacity of 369 mA h g−1, surpassing the performance of Ti2C/C nanocomposites.26
Through modulation of strain, materials can exhibit remarkable mechano–electrochemical coupling due to their adaptable properties, by mechanically altering their atomic structures.27–32 This has the potential to open significant opportunities for achieving exceptional energy-storage capabilities. For instance, according to Yu et al., the presence of local strain at carbon–MoS2 interfaces with different properties can regulate the energetic pathways in LIBs. This can lead to the direct chemical conversion of MoS2 without the need for Li intercalation at a lower voltage, as was previously assumed for pristine MoS2.33 According to the computational study by Zhang et al., applying compressive biaxial strain to M2C MXenes can lower the energy barriers of Li-ion. They also identified Ti2CO2 as a potential candidate for use in LIBs.12 Moreover, Wang et al. utilized the mechanochemistry (MC) method to induce strain in the Ti2C2Tx MXene. As a result, the in-plane biaxial compression significantly reduced the lithium diffusion barrier and enhanced the ion-transfer kinetics.34
The Mo2C-based MXene, which comes from the Mo2Ga2C MAX phase, is created by selectively removing Ga atoms and then immersing the resulting material in hydrofluoric acid.35 It has two different phases, namely the 1T and 2H phases. According to recent studies,35,36 it has been found that the 2H phase is more energetically stable than its counterpart. There is an energy difference of approximately 90 meV per atom between them. Moreover, it has been reported that the 2H phases of the bare and oxygen-functionalized materials possess remarkably high flexibility and strength due to their centrosymmetric layers.22 Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the energetically stable 2H phase of Mo2C-based MXenes (2H-Mo2C)21,22 under biaxial strain for use as anode materials of Li-ion batteries. The adsorption energies, diffusion energy barriers, theoretical capacities, and open circuit voltages (OCVs) of Li-ions on Mo2C and Mo2CO2 at −4%, 0%, and 4% strains are calculated to deeply understand the mechanism and address the possibility of using these materials as anodes of LIBs.
2. Computational details
Herein, ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed using CAstEP.37 For the exchange–correlation function, we used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)38 and ultrasoft pseudopotentials with the following electronic configurations: Mo – 4s2 4p6 4d5 5s1, C – 2s2 2p2, O – 2s2 2p4, and Li – 1s2 2s1.39 The dispersion-corrected DFT (DFT-D) method with Grimme correction40 was adopted to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. The cut-off energy was set at 600 eV. The k-point mesh was 8 × 8 × 1 for geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 5 × 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The vacuum slab model with a vacuum thickness over 20 Å was constructed to eliminate the effect of the electrostatic force between the nearest slabs, generated by a restricted periodic boundary condition. In order to prevent interaction between the two nearest Li ions, the 3 × 3 × 1 supercells of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 MXenes were used to investigate the adsorption sites of Li on their surfaces. The diffusion paths were set by the pathway between the first two lowest adsorption energy sites. Meanwhile, the theoretical adsorption capacitance of Li was evaluated on the MXene surfaces of a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell. To study the effects of biaxial strain on Li adsorption and diffusion, we apply the external biaxial strain (εb), following , where a and a0 are the lattice constants at a given strain and for the free-strain MXene, respectively. In this work, the adsorption and diffusion of Li ions on Mo2C and Mo2CO2 were performed under both compressive strain (−4%) and tensile strain (4%). Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with the NPT ensemble were performed to confirm the stability of adsorbed Li on the MXenes at 400 K. The 2 × 2 × 1 supercells of Mo2CLi6 and Mo2CO2Li6 were used in the simulation because they are sufficient to allow the formation of a Li cluster. The time step was 2 fs, and the total calculation time was 6 ps.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 illustrates the atomic structures of the 2H phases of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 monolayers, in which they exhibit a hexagonal unit cell with three atomic layers (Mo–C–Mo) in Mo2C and five atomic layers (O–Mo–C–Mo–O) in Mo2CO2. The ground state lattice parameters (a) are 2.835 Å and 2.859 Å for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively. These structural configurations are carefully verified as the global structures from the previous study of Kotmool et al.22
 Fig. 1  Side views and top views of the atomic configuration of Mo2C (a and c) and Mo2CO2 (b and d). The adsorption sites (S1–S4) of a Li ion on symmetric positions on Mo2C (e) and Mo2CO2 (f) are magnified. The purple, brown, and red balls represent Mo, C, and O, respectively. 
We first examine the adsorption sites for an isolated Li atom to study Li adsorption on Mo2C and Mo2CO2. Considering the symmetry of Mo2C and Mo2CO2, there are four possible adsorption sites for both structures, denoted by S1–S4, as shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively. Moreover, the top and side views of each configuration are also illustrated in Fig. 1S and 2S of the ESI.† To seek the relaxed structure, we perform a full geometry optimization of the MXenes; meanwhile, the Li adsorbate is constrained in the x- and y-directions, but allowed to move in the z-direction. To quantitatively evaluate the adsorption behaviors, we calculate the adsorption energy (Ead), defined in eqn (1), to order the energetically favorable adsorption sites of Li on Mo2C and Mo2CO2. 
Ead = EMXene+Li − EMXene − ELi
(1)where EMXene+Li and EMXene represent the total energy with and without Li-ion adsorption on the MXenes, respectively. ELi represents the energy per atom of bulk Li. The adsorption energies are listed in Table 1. At εb = 0%, the S3 site is the lowest energy position for both adsorbents (−0.96 eV and −3.13 eV for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively). This position is the center-hollow position of the hexagon. The second preferred adsorption position is at the S1 site (−0.95 eV) for Mo2C, and at the S2 site (−2.99 eV) for Mo2CO2. For the other sites, the Ead slightly increases by 0.01–0.02 eV for Mo2C, and by 0.03–0.06 eV for Mo2CO2. In addition, the adsorption height (H), referring to the shortest distance of the Li atom from the MXene surface, is measured. The H values inversely depend on the magnitude of Ead, reflecting the strong interaction of the Li atom with the MXenes. These findings indicate the features of the energy landscapes of the two calculated materials; that is, Mo2C has a smooth energy landscape for Li ions, and that of the other should be rougher. Therefore, it can clearly be claimed that this difference results from the effect of oxygen termination. Also, it should influence the energy barrier of Li diffusion and the adsorption capacity for Li, which will be discussed in more detail in further calculations. Moreover, we find that most of the Ead values of the calculated sites at −4% and 4% strains do not show any significant difference from the results for 0% strain, as listed in Table 2. The Ead of Mo2C significantly increases from applying compression to tension, corresponding to the increased surface area, while it slightly decreases in Mo2CO2. The trend in the opposite direction is extensively discussed in the ESI,† with reference to the calculated parameters listed in Table S1 (ESI†).

To comprehend the intrinsic properties of Li-ion adsorption at the most stable site (S3), the electron localization functions (ELFs) and partial density of states (PDOS) are illustrated in Fig. 2, unveiling how their electronic properties change when a Li atom decorates the surfaces of Mo2C and Mo2CO2. In the ELF of Mo2C (Fig. 2a), it has smoothly localized electrons throughout its surface, supporting the smooth energetic landscape of this bare MXene. On the other hand, the ELF at the surface of Mo2CO2 (Fig. 2b) possesses periodic wells of delocalized electrons between the O atoms. This appearance advocates the rougher energy landscape with respect to its counterpart. Moreover, it is found that a Li atom at the S3 site of both MXenes does not strongly affect the electronic properties of the host materials, as displayed in the PDOSs of Mo2C (Fig. 2c and e) and Mo2CO2 (Fig. 2d and f). As is well known, the Li atom prefers to donate one electron to the MXenes; the resting electron of the Li ion in the 1s orbital is at the energy levels of −47.6 eV and −45.8 eV for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively. Mo2C + Li retains a metallic character in which the Fermi level is contributed dominantly by the Mo-4d state. Meanwhile, the electron density of Mo2CO2 + Li is significantly concentrated at the Fermi level compared with the the topological insulator Mo2CO2.22

Li diffusion on the Mo2C and Mo2CO2 MXenes at certain biaxial strains is examined based on the energy barrier between the first two most favorable adsorption sites for the Li ion. The reaction paths of the Li ion on Mo2C and Mo2CO2 are displayed in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 3(c) and (d), the changes in the energy barrier with respect to the biaxial strain are presented for both materials. Starting at εb = 0%, it is found that the energy barrier of Mo2C is about 45 meV, which is slightly higher than that in previous work (∼40 meV, without vdW correction).21 In addition, this energy barrier is much lower than those of some other promising 2D electrodes, such as p-BN2 (∼50 meV),6 p-BCN (∼140 meV),7 graphene (∼150 meV),9 and graphite (∼218 meV).41 At the same time, it is a higher energy barrier compared to those of other MXenes consisting of Ti2C (∼16 meV), Zr2C (∼ 29 meV), Hf2C (∼20 meV), and 1T-Mo2C (∼21 meV).12 For Mo2CO2, its energy barrier is about 203 meV, being in the range of other functionalized MXenes, for example Zr2CF2 (∼215 meV), Zr2CO2 (∼310 meV), Nb2CS2 (∼230 meV), Ti2CF2 (∼108 meV), and Ti2CO2 (∼158 meV).12,16 These results suggest that Mo2C and Mo2CO2 have enough merit for application in Li-ion battery anodes.

Modification by biaxial strain is generally a method that has attracted considerable interest in both experimental and theoretical investigations12,13,22,34 because it can tune the electrical properties or other properties of 2D materials. We find that the compressive strain (−4%) induces a lower energy barrier, being 31 meV for Mo2C and 177 meV for Mo2CO2, but the tensile strain (4%) increases it to 57 meV and 229 meV, respectively. Further to this, it is noticed that the adsorption height (H) of Li ions is extended by tensile stress and contracted by compressive stress. This result is analogous with the previous theoretical study on Ti2C by Zhang et al.,12 who proposed that the energy barrier decreases with increasing H of the Li ion from the MXene's surface.
We further examined the storage capacity of Li in the MXenes, because this is a significant value of direct concern in the performance of the anode in ion batteries. In accordance with previous studies,16,21 we use 2 × 2 × 1 supercell MXenes to investigate the storage capacity for Li ions. The Li ions in the first layer occur at the S3 sites, which are the most favorable sites. After verifying the most stable sites for the Li ions in the layers above, it is found that the Li ions energetically prefer to be adsorbed at the S1 and S2 sites for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively, in the second layer. Furthermore, they sit at the S3 site in the third layer. The stacking layers of Li ions on Mo2C and Mo2CO2 are demonstrated in Fig. 5. The calculated average adsorption energy for the nth layer of Li ions (Ead,n) is defined by eqn (2). 
(2)where ELi is the energy per atom in bulk Li. EMXene+Li8n and EMXene+Li8(n−1) represent the total energies of the MXene with an nth and (n − 1)th adsorbed Li layer, respectively. The integer of 8 in the equation is the number of Li adsorbates for each layer. The Ead,n values of Li adsorbed on Mo2C and Mo2CO2 for n = 1, 2, and 3 are listed in Table 3.

Based on the calculated Ead,n, we found that our Ead,n values of the adsorbed Li on Mo2C are significantly more negative than those from the previous calculations,21 indicating that our computational results show stronger adsorption. This difference is because of the effect of vdW interaction, which is confirmed by the reasonable agreement of our reproduction when excluding the vdW effect. The Ead,1 values are about −0.50 eV and −0.95 eV for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively. They decrease when n is increased. The Ead,3 values are −0.19 eV for Mo2C and −0.31 eV for Mo2CO2. Although the Ead,n values are sufficiently high to prevent formation of a Li cluster, it is still necessary to verify whether the MXenes’ atomic structure is maintained via determining the impact of the thermal vibration at practical temperatures. Therefore, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) method is performed at 400 K to verify the thermal stability at n = 3. As a result, it is seen that all the Li atoms vibrate around their equilibrium positions and are slightly distorted from the original positions, confirmed by the energy fluctuation of 0.3 eV f.u.−1 as depicted in Fig. 4. In addition, the Ead,3 for strains of −4% and 4% in both MXenes is also calculated. The Ead,3 values of Mo2C are −0.16 eV (−4%) and −0.23 eV (4%), while those of Mo2CO2 are −0.28 eV (−4%) and −0.33 eV (4%). However, we will not further increase the number of nth layers because of the fact that they show the absorption of a Li-on-Li surface rather than on the MXenes.

To understand the role of O-termination, which yields a significantly higher Ead,n than the bare MXene, electron localization functions (ELFs)42 are obtained and Mulliken population analysis (MPA)43 performed, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a–f). The results of MPA, as incorporated in each of the ELF panels, show that the O in Mo2CO2 has a more negative charge compared with Mo in Mo2C, for all n layers of Li ions. Therefore, the adsorbed Li, which usually has a positive charge, can be more likely to adsorb on the O-terminated surfaces. We also find that the charge of the Mo in Mo2CO2 is positive, reflecting that it donates some electrons to the C and O atoms. Intriguingly, the 2nd Li-layers for both MXenes are induced to be negative, being an electrical bridge to fix the 1st and the 3rd Li layers together. The ELFs also support that the 1st Li layer in Mo2CO2 has less localization with respect to its counterpart, indicating that it possesses more ionic bonds with the O-surface than the Mo-surface. Hence, the strong interaction of an ionic nature for the adsorbed Li on Mo2CO2 plays a vital role in the higher Ead,n. The distributions of localized electrons for n = 2 and 3 form a hexagon around Li for Mo2C. On the other hand, Mo2CO2 has delocalized electrons above the 1st Li layer, and the electrons are much more localized around the 2nd and 3rd Li layers.
 Fig. 5  Electron localization functions (ELFs) of the (110) plane for (a and d) n = 1, (b and e) n = 2 and (c and f) n = 3 of adsorbed Li on Mo2C and Mo2CO2. 
It is important to mention that a maximum of 24 Li atoms can be stored on the Mo2C and Mo2CO2, corresponding to a chemical stoichiometry of Li6Mo2C and Li6Mo2CO2. The theoretical capacity (mA h g−1) is defined by eqn (3). 
(3)where x is the number of adsorbed Li ions, F is the Faraday constant (26801 mA h mol−1), and MMXene is the molecular mass of the MXene. The maximum theoretical capacities corresponding to 3 layers of Li atoms (x = 24) are computed to be 788.61 and 681.64 mA h g−1 for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively. They are higher than those in previous works (see Fig. 3S, ESI†), such as for Nb2CS2 (194.36 mA h g−1),16 Mo2C (525.74 mA h g−1),21 Ti2CS2 (311.86 mA h g−1),19 p-PtN2 (480.53 mA h g−1),44 and MoC (496.40 mA h g−1).45 In contrast to other lightweight monolayers, such as p-graphene (1489.00 mA h g−1),46 p-BN2 (2071.00 mA h g−1),6 and p-BCN (2183.12 mA h g−1),7 the MXenes chosen in this study have considerably lower theoretical capacities. Based on the evidence, it appears that Mo2C and Mo2CO2 MXenes are suitable for use in stationary- or heavy-machinery lithium-ion battery systems.
Finally, we also calculate the open circuit voltage (OCV), which is defined by 
(4)where EMXene and EMXene+Lix are the total energies of the MXene and adsorbed Li on MXene, respectively. ELi is the total energy per atom of the bulk Li. x and e represent the number of adsorbed Li ions and the elementary charge, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4S (ESI†), the OCVs decrease with an increasing number of adsorbed Li layers, as the OCV values are from 0.50 to 0.19 V for Mo2C and 0.95 to 0.31 V for Mo2CO2 at εb = 0%. The OCV of Mo2CO2 is higher than that of Mo2C by about two times, resulting from a higher adsorption energy. Furthermore, we found that the tensile strain results in an increase in the OCVs, while compression has the opposite effect. Interestingly, the average OCVs of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 at εb = 4% are 0.46 and 0.70 V, respectively. This is evidence that incorporating strain engineering can enhance the efficiency of ion battery electrodes. It would be beneficial to compare the OCVs of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 with those of other potential anode materials. It is found that the average OCVs of Mo2C (0.35 V) and Mo2CO2 (0.63 V) at 0% of strain lie between those of some remarkable 2D anode materials, such as p-graphene (0.60 V),46 p-BCN (0.14 V),7 Mo2C (0.14 V),21 p-PtN2 (0.25 V),44 MoC (0.63 V),45 Ti2CS2 (0.89 V)19 and Nb2CS2 (0.92 V).16 Hence, this comparison indicates that Mo2C and Mo2CO2 MXenes might be potential anode materials for LIBs.
Based on our calculations, it is crucial to discuss the pros and cons of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 MXenes for their possible use in LIBs.
(i) Regarding ion diffusion, both MXenes have sufficiently low energy barriers compared to other promising 2D anodes. Moreover, the energy barrier of Mo2C is much lower than that of Mo2CO2. Ideally, it should be noted that Mo2C is more suitable as an anode for LIBs.
(ii) Based on the adsorption energy (Ead), it is clear that Li ions exhibit a stronger interaction with Mo2CO2 compared to Mo2C. This suggests that Mo2CO2 may be more stable than Mo2C under various realistic conditions.
(iii) Although Mo2C has a lower molecular mass than Mo2CO2, it has a higher theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, both MXenes exhibit lower capacities in comparison to certain lightweight anode materials.
(iv) When it comes to synthesizing bare MXenes, it can be difficult due to the available low-cost techniques that tend to result in functionalized atoms on top of the MXenes, specifically oxygen. This ultimately leads to highly stable MXenes. As a result, Mo2CO2 may be a more suitable option for use as an anode material in LIBs.
On comparison, it appears that Mo2CO2 could be a superior choice due to its higher adsorption energy and practical applications. However, it is important to note that these findings are based on theoretical investigations and provide an insight into general directions for the behavior of MXenes under biaxial stresses.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported the possibility of application of the 2H phases of Mo2C and Mo2CO2 under biaxial strain for anode materials in LIBs, employing density functional calculations. The systematic theoretical study starts by finding the stable sites of Li occupation. It is shown that oxygen termination induces a higher adsorption energy compared to bare Mo2C because of the greater attraction between O and Li with respect to that of Mo and Li. We then calculated the energy barrier within the pathway between the two lowest energetic sites. It reveals that the biaxial strain refinement at compressive strain decreases the energy barrier, but it is increased by induction of tensile strain in both MXenes. Li adsorption involving the vdW effect could be stable up for to three layers, with adsorption energies of −0.19 eV and −0.31 eV for Mo2C and Mo2CO2, respectively. The thermal stabilities are also verified by using an AIMD simulation, revealing that there is no formation of Li clusters at 400 K. Moreover, the corresponding maximum theoretical capacity and open circuit voltage (OCV) are evaluated, and are 788.61 mA h g−1 and 0.19 V for Li6Mo2C, and 681.64 mA h g−1 and 0.31 V for Li6Mo2CO2. Our results reveal that Mo2C and Mo2CO2 are potentially excellent, with low energy barriers, structure stability, sufficiently high theoretical capacities, and high open circuit voltages. These properties can also be tuned by biaxial strains. Therefore, Mo2C and Mo2CO2 MXenes should be promising anode materials for implementation in LIBs.
