    , Accepted 31st January 2023First published on 31st January 2023AbstractIn this work, we report an atomistic understanding of the hydrogenation behavior of a highly twinned ZnSe nanorod (T-ZnSe) with a large density of surface atomic steps and the activation of N2 molecules adsorbed on its surface. Theoretical calculations suggest that the atomic steps are essential for the hydrogenation of T-ZnSe, which greatly enhances its catalytic activity. As a result, the T-ZnSe nanorods exhibit a significantly enhanced NH3 production rate of 13.3 μg h−1 mg−1 and faradaic efficiency of 5.83% towards the NRR compared with the pristine ZnSe nanorods. This report offers an important pathway for the development of efficient catalysts for the NRR, and a versatile anion-exchange strategy for efficiently manipulating materials’ functionalities.
Ammonia (NH3) serves as a building block for agricultural fertilizers, carbon-free energy carrier, and industrial feedstock.1–3 At present, industrial-scale NH3 is produced by the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process at high temperature (400–600 °C) and high pressure (200–400 atm).4 However, this process releases significant greenhouse gases and consequently causes serious environmental concerns.5–7 To reduce carbon emissions, it is imperative to promote the Haber–Bosch method to green processes. Powered by renewable energy sources such as solar cells, electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions offers a promising path for sustainable NH3 production.8–12
Although significant process has been achieved, the NRR is currently limited by the low production rate of NH3 and the poor selectivity. This originates from the ultra-stable NN bond and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same potential range as the NRR.13–19 For the NRR, the HER is just like the two sides of each coin. On one side, the HER is a two-electron reaction with its thermodynamics and kinetics superior to those of the NRR. For example, Ghorai et al. demonstrated that the HER plays a key role during the NRR process.19 Therefore, at the same potential, the yield rate and faradaic efficiency of NH3 are much lower than that of H2. On the other side, recent computational and experimental works demonstrated that the hydrogenation effect, forming atomic hydrogen species (H*) on the surface of electrocatalysts, plays a vital role in promoting the NRR.20–24 For example, Feng et al. reported that atomic H* formed on Pd nanocatalysts can effectively activate N2 and lower the free energy barrier of transformation of N2 to N2H*.20 Wang et al. demonstrated that MoOx-Mo2C achieved a higher NH3 yield under proton-rich conditions.24 Despite these great advances, there is still a lack of atomic-level connection between the hydrogenation behavior of electrocatalysts and their NRR performance.
In this work, we report an atomistic understanding of the hydrogenation effect and the activation of N2 molecules on highly twinned ZnSe nanorods (T-ZnSe) grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) with a large density of surface atomic steps, which exhibit significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency and NH3 production rate compared with the pristine ZnSe nanorods. Our theoretical calculations suggest that the twinned structure is essential for the surface hydrogenation of T-ZnSe, which greatly promotes the adsorption and activation of N2. Our work paves a promising way for engineering catalysts for green and sustainable NH3 production.
Ion exchange is a particularly attractive synthetic tool for adjusting the atomic/electronic structure of electrocatalysts.25,26 In this work, T-ZnSe nanorods with atomic steps were prepared via the anion exchange method, using single-crystal ZnO nanorods as sacrificial templates (Fig. 1a). After anion exchange, ZnO nanorods were completely transformed into ZnSe nanorods. As displayed in Fig. 1b and d, the entire surface of the CFP is uniformly covered with NRs. The ZnSe nanorods were grown firmly on CFP, and compared with ZnO nanorods with a smooth surface, the exchanged ZnSe nanorods exhibit a rather rough surface (Fig. 1d–f). The high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1f) shows that the surface of the as-exchanged ZnSe nanorods is full of cavities, which should be caused by the release of crystal stress during the anion exchange process. These cavities can significantly facilitate the mass diffusion during the electrocatalytic reaction.

The XRD patterns (Fig. 2a) and TEM-EDS results (Table S1, ESI†) demonstrate (Fig. 2a) that ZnO was completely converted into ZnSe after cation exchange. TEM characterization was performed to investigate the microstructure of the T-ZnSe nanorods. The low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 2b and d) shows that the ZnSe nanorods become rather rough compared with the smooth surface of the ZnO nanorods. The TEM image viewed from the [110] direction shows that the T-ZnSe nanorods are composed of high density stacking faults (Fig. 2e). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals that these stacking faults are {111} twin boundaries (Fig. 2f), and the thickness of each twin segment along the longitude of the nanorod is less than 5 nm. Importantly, the HRTEM image clearly presents that the surface of the T-ZnSe nanorods is enclosed with dominant {111} nano-facets, and a high density of atomic steps are distributed on these nano-facets (Fig. 2f).

The electrocatalytic N2-reduction ability of T-ZnSe nanorods was measured in N2-saturated 0.10 M KOH solution. For reference purposes, ZnSe nanorods with a smooth surface were fabricated (Fig. S1, ESI,† denoted as R-ZnSe nanorods). Note that T-ZnSe and R-ZnSe nanorods possess very similar electrochemical surface areas (Fig. S2, ESI†). In order to accurately evaluate the production of NH3 over the electrocatalysts investigated, an airtight measurement system, including a gas cleaning cell, an H-type electrolytic cell and a gas collection cell, was specifically designed to avoid possible contamination from the testing environment (Fig. S3, ESI†). In particular, copper-exchanged zeolites were added to the gas cleaning cell to remove possible nitrogen oxide impurities in N2 gas. In addition, multi-step control experiments (Fig. S4a and c, ESI†) and quantitative 15N2 isotope labelling (Fig. S4b, ESI†) were carefully performed to verify that the detected NH3 was indeed derived from the NRR over the electrocatalysts, rather than contamination or test errors. Moreover, the NH3 yields over the electrocatalysts were verified by two independent methods (Fig. S7 and S9, ESI†), i.e., an ammonia-sensitive electrode and ion chromatography method.
The amounts of NH3 generated on the T-ZnSe and R-ZnSe nanorods were detected after chronoamperometry tests for 5C (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 3a and b show the NH3 faradaic efficiencies and yield rates of the T-ZnSe and R-ZnSe nanorods at various potentials. Impressively, the T-ZnSe nanorods achieve the highest NH3 yield rate (13.3 μg h−1 mg−1) at −0.5 V versus RHE, which is 7.8 times higher than that of the R-ZnSe nanorods. Moreover, the highest faradaic efficiency of T-ZnSe (5.83%) is 5.9 times higher than that of the R-ZnSe nanorods. These results demonstrate the high electrocatalytic activity of T-ZnSe towards the NRR.

(a and b) NH3 faradaic efficiencies and yield rates of T-ZnSe and R-ZnSe, respectively (c and d) NH3 yield rates and faradaic efficiencies of T-ZnSe during six consecutive recycling electrolysis experiments in N2-saturated 0.10 M KOH. The experiment data shown here were obtained using the ammonia sensitive electrode method. 
Besides, the cyclic durability of the T-ZnSe nanorods was investigated by six continuous cycles at −0.5 V versus RHE. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, no noticeable changes were observed in the faradaic efficiencies and NH3 yield rates of the T-ZnSe nanorods during six consecutive cycles. This excellent cyclic durability of the T-ZnSe nanorods was further confirmed by XRD characterizations after a long-term stability test (Fig. S10, ESI†). Furthermore, no byproduct N2H4 was detected after the electrochemical reduction (Fig. S11, ESI†), and the NRR was considered through an associative distal pathway with reaction intermediates *NNH, *NNH2, *N, *NH, and *NH2 (Fig. S13, ESI†).
Considering recent progress in the hydrogen-assisted NRR,20–24 we investigated the effect of atomic H* on the NRR activity of T-ZnSe nanorods. First, we compared the formation of atomic H* on the ZnSe (111) surface with and without the atomic step (T-ZnSe (111) and ZnSe (111)) by DFT calculations. As shown in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI†), the energy barrier of water dissociation on ZnSe (111) is 2.11 eV, which is lower than that on T-ZnSe (111), indicating the facilitated formation of atomic H* on the atomic steps of the T-ZnSe nanorods. The DFT calculations demonstrate that the atomic steps on the T-ZnSe nanorods enhance the adsorption/activation of H2O and promote the formation of atomic H* under the cathodic potentials.
It is well acknowledged that the activation of N2 is the most difficult process for the NRR due to the ultra-stable NN triple bond (bond dissociation energy of 9.80 eV per bond at 298 K).27 We compared the activation of N2 on T-ZnSe (111) with and without H*, which were referred to as T-ZnSe (111)-H* and T-ZnSe (111), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the NN bond length (1.121 Å) of N2 adsorbed on T-ZnSe (111)-H* is significantly elongated compared with that on T-ZnSe (111) (1.105 Å). This result indicates the key role of hydrogenated atomic steps of ZnSe in the activation of inert N2 molecules. To support this point, we projected the density of states (DOS) on Zn-3d and N-2p orbitals of T-ZnSe (111)-H* and T-ZnSe (111). As illustrated in Fig. 4c and d, after N2 adsorption, the Zn-3d states are significantly overlapped with the N-2p states near the Fermi level of T-ZnSe (111)-H*, which is not evidently observed on T-ZnSe (111). Obviously, the observed orbital overlapping between Zn-3d and N-2p orbitals can facilitate the electron transfer between T-ZnSe (111)-H* and the adsorbed N2 molecule, thus promoting the activation of N2 molecules. Therefore, these collective results demonstrate that the generation of atomic H* is of crucial importance for the activation of N2 molecules, which is the most energy-costly step in the overall NRR (Fig. S17, ESI†).

In summary, we have synthesized highly twinned T-ZnSe nanorods on CFP, which exhibited remarkable catalytic activity towards the NRR. Our DFT calculations revealed that the twinned structure is essential for the hydrogenation of T-ZnSe, which greatly enhances its catalytic activity. Thus, the adsorption and activation of N2 were remarkably promoted. As a result, the T-ZnSe nanorods achieved significantly enhanced faradaic efficiency and NH3 production rate compared with the pristine ZnSe nanorods. This work establishes an atomistic understanding of the hydrogenation effect and the activation of N2 molecules on electrocatalysts and paves a promising way for engineering electrocatalysts for green and sustainable NH3 production.
