    , Accepted 25th February 2016First published on 25th February 2016AbstractUnderstanding the intrinsic behaviour of perovskite solar cells is as important as breaking a new PCE record. In particular, the essential mechanisms (e.g. the effect of moisture, oxygen or temperature) behind their chemical instability remain controversial. In this work, we unconventionally and specially fabricate a robust CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell device in ∼70% relative humidity (RH) with an un-optimized PCE of 8.76%, because our main aim is to understand the essential mechanisms, not the efficiency, which drastically relies on the device assembling technique. Such a device exhibits excellent chemical and performance stability, with more than 72% of the initial PCE still maintained after 250 days storage under 40 ± 3% RH conditions without any encapsulation. In addition, the mechanism underlying the chemical and device stability is fully understood from the charge carrier dynamics and variation of the perovskite crystal. These high RH conditions may facilitate a slight and rapid decomposition/separation of CH3NH3PbI3 to form a PbI2 passivation layer as a moisture defender, which on the contrary plays a crucial role in stabilizing the PCE of CH3NH3PbI3 mesoporous solar cells. This PbI2 insulation layer made the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO p–n junction a CH3NH3PbI3/PbI2/ZnO p–i–n junction, and maintained good junction quality. Another key factor contributing to the high stability lies in the formation of regular nano-sized ZnO arrays. Consequent transient photovoltaic (TPV) tests revealed that not only fresh CH3NH3PbI3, but also pure PbI2 thin films and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films stored for a long time, all possess a long minority carrier life time. In particular, the stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films still maintain a relatively fast photogenerated carrier transfer stability compared with the fresh CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin film. We demonstrated the relatively positive role of a moderate amount of PbI2 in perovskite solar cells. This robust device fabrication and TPV measurements give a new perspective for understanding the heterojunction quality and PCE variation in perovskite solar cell fabrication.
Introduction
The competition to continuously refresh the power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite based solar cells has recently attracted a significant amount of attention due to their excellent photovoltaic performance and rapidly improving PCEs (3.8–20.3%).1–4 Methylammonium lead halides (MAPbX3, X = halogen) and their mixed-halide crystal analogs are composed of abundant elements and can be easily crystallized at low temperature. Organic–inorganic perovskite materials also have high carrier mobility, large absorption coefficients and suitable band structures for harvesting sunlight.
Methylammonium lead halide perovskites are sensitive to moisture. Decomposition of the perovskite results in performance degeneration in perovskite solar cells.5–7 The instability of perovskites means that the fabrication, measurement and storage of perovskite solar cells requires a glovebox,2,8,9 which limits the development of perovskite solar cells. Fabricating stable perovskite solar cells with high performance in ambient conditions will be more valuable. Recently, several groups have reported relatively stable perovskite solar cell devices to moisture.10,11 Han's group designed and fabricated a novel porous TiO2/ZrO2 scaffold perovskite solar cell, which maintains approximately 10.5% PCE for >1000 hours under ambient conditions and sunlight illumination.12 Dongqin Bi and coworkers13 fabricated a CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized ZnO nanorod array solid-state solar cell without encapsulation and obtained a 5.0% PCE under ambient conditions for over 500 hours. On the other hand, changes in the hole-transport material (HTM) have also led to more stable perovskite solar cells.14–16 Spiro-OMeTAD is generally used as a HTM in perovskite solar cells but is 10 times more expensive than gold. Unfortunately, solar cell devices without HTM have extremely lower PCE values and poor stability. Zheng and coworkers17 reported that replacing Spiro-OMeTAD with DR3TBDTT as a HTM resulted in a more stable perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 8.3%, and could be stored at 20% relative humidity (RH). Liu and colleagues18 demonstrated that the tetrathiafulvalene derivative TTF-1 can also be used as a HTM to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells. These solar cells obtained a PCE of ∼11% when stored at 40% RH for approximately 550 h. In these studies, the construction of porous structure scaffolds has been identified as being effective for fabricating stable perovskite solar cells. Most perovskite solar cells with porous structures8,19,20 have better stability than planar structures2,21 without encapsulation and exposure to high relative humidity.
Despite all the above significant progresses, the intrinsic mechanism of how moisture affects the PCE is still in dispute. Very recently, Chen and colleagues demonstrated that CH3NH3PbI3 is intrinsically and thermally unstable even at room temperature using a first principle calculation.22 At the same time, Bert Conings and coworkers also showed the intrinsic thermal instability of CH3NH3PbI3, but the decomposition temperature was, in contrast, reported to be higher than 85 °C.23 Actually, both of these studies suggest the thermal instability is intrinsic and has no relationship to the atmosphere moisture. The main effect of moisture on the photovoltaic performance lies in the chemical kinetics rather than the chemical thermal dynamics. This chemically unstable trend reduces both the solar cell stability and photovoltaic performance. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the intrinsic mechanisms in thermally unstable CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell devices for both academic necessity and industrial application.
In this work, a CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO solar cell device with a mesoporous structure was fabricated and selected as a model with the goal of understanding the device stability and performances of perovskite solar cells. The cells were fabricated robustly in a 70% RH atmosphere and more than 70% of the initial PCE was maintained after 250 days storage at 40 ± 3% RH without any encapsulation. The three factors affecting the performance of the CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell include charge generation, charge separation and charge transfer. Although CH3NH3PbI3 can photogenerate carriers itself without requiring any interface,24 charge separation and transfer are limited due to the formation of PbI2 in bulk CH3NH3PbI3, which leads to performance variation. In the current design, the kinetics for the photoinduced carriers in fresh and stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films was carefully studied by taking advantage of the transient photovoltaic (TPV) method.25–27 The TPV measurement of these perovskite thin films as well as the corresponding robust devices may provide insight into the performance variation mechanism of such mesoporous perovskite solar cells. It's interesting to note that the increase of PbI2 between the CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO interface may switch the p–n junction into a p–i–n junction during storage. The relatively fast charge separation, long carrier lifetimes, and a relatively stable PCE could be maintained in the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO solar cell devices which were stored for a long time. In addition, PbI2 is proved to be a p-type semiconductor with a rather long charge carrier lifetime comparable with CH3NH3PbI3. In particular, it can protect the surface from moisture to maintain the device stability and photovoltaic performance.
Results and discussion
The porous scaffold structure of perovskite solar cells not only facilitates charge transfer but also serves to protect the perovskite material. Many perovskite solar cells use TiO2 as an electron transport layer (ETL).28 However, the synthesis of a compact/porous TiO2 structure requires multiple steps at high temperatures. Such a spin coated thin film is often difficult to be replicated. In this study, a ZnO nanoarray thin film was employed as the mesoscopic scaffold and ETL to fabricate bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells due to the high electron mobility29 and the easy fabrication of the ZnO compact/porous scaffold. Our method firstly utilizes the conversion of elemental Zn thin film into a uniform ZnO dense layer through magnetron sputtering. Subsequent chemical bath deposition (CBD) treatment results in a highly oriented and transparent ZnO compact/porous thin film. Fig. 1a shows the morphology of the uniform ZnO dense layer which is composed of about 100 nm particles. The corresponding AFM image (Fig. S1†) and XRD diffraction pattern (Fig. S2a) can be found in the ESI.†Fig. 1b shows the porous ZnO thin film, in which the ZnO nanorods are uniformly and highly oriented. The XRD pattern of the thin film demonstrates that the ZnO nanorod arrays are highly (002) oriented on the ZnO dense layer (see ESI† Fig. S2b). The overall thickness of the ZnO nanorods and dense layer is approximately 500 nm and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM images of FTO/ZnO and the assembled device can be found in Fig. 1b. The interspacing between the ZnO nanorods results in a porous scaffold which protects the infiltrated CH3NH3PbI3 crystal (in the nanorods’ gap) against moisture and promises the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray bulk heterojunction solar cells. At the same time, its porous scaffold must be highly transparent to ensure the absorber role of the infiltrated CH3NH3PbI3. The transmittance of the porous ZnO thin films with and without the dense ZnO layer is plotted in Fig. S3.† The highly (002) oriented porous ZnO thin film on top of the dense ZnO layer exhibits high transmittance and can therefore be successfully used to fabricate perovskite solar cells. The corresponding morphology of the porous ZnO thin film on the FTO substrate without the dense ZnO layer can be found in the ESI† (Fig. S4).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the dense ZnO layer (a) and the ZnO nanorod array (b) (inset image shows the cross section of a ZnO nanorod.) 

Fig. 2a and b show the cross-sectional image and a schematic diagram of the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray solar cell device. The top and interspace of the ZnO nanorods were covered or filled with CH3NH3PbI3, which formed bulk heterojunctions. The HTM layer and Au electrode were deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer in sequence (the details are outlined in the Experimental section). Considering that the thermal instability of CH3NH3PbI3 is intrinsic and the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 is inevitable, all the above procedures were performed in a ∼70% relative humidity. In this case, moisture does not affect the perovskite solar cell devices as terribly as generally expected. The J–V characteristic of the current freshly prepared bulk heterojunction CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray solar cell device is illustrated in Fig. 2c. The J–V curve was recorded under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight with 100 mW cm−2 energy density. The best values of the Voc, Jsc, fill factor and PCE for a selective solar cell device were 0.93 V, 18.18 mA cm−2, 51.8% and 8.76%, respectively. The corresponding EQE data are shown in Fig. 2d. We have also fabricated a FTO/dense-TiO2/porous-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTL/Au solar cell device in our lab according to the best report,9 and the champion device has a 4.9% PCE for comparison (Fig. S5† in ESI).

We have recorded the variation in performance of the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray solar cell device over time. Fig. 3a shows the PCE values of the stored solar cell devices. Interestingly, the PCE value initially increases from 7.27% to 8.76%, which is consistent with a previous report.18 However, the mechanism of such a phenomenon remains unclear and requires further study. Fig. 3b reveals similar changes in both the Voc and Jsc values during storage. The highest and lowest Voc values observed are 0.93 V and 0.71 V, respectively, indicating a Voc loss of approximately 23.6%. The initial and decreased Jsc values were 17.38 mA cm−2 and 12.74 mA cm−2, respectively, resulting in a loss of 26.7% during storage. The corresponding J–V curves of the stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray solar cell device are illustrated in Fig. 3d. However, the fill factor (FF) values change little (see Fig. 3c), which is an indicator of the junctions having a series resistance (Rs)30 due to the non-idealities and impurities. The change of the J–V curve slopes corresponds to the Rsh and Rs variation. Fig. 3d shows the Rsh and Rs variation as the perovskite solar cell storage time increases. We note that the Rs increases while Rsh is relatively stable over 90 days. This indicated that the ZnO/perovskite junction keeps its basic quality but the resistance at the perovskite/HTL interface increases due to the formation of PbI2. The unit area (the rectangle surrounded by Jsc and Voc) of the device which was stored for about 250 days is smaller than the initial device, even though the FF value is relatively stable. The Voc loss may be ascribed to the change in band alignment of the ZnO/perovskite p–n junction deteriorating to a ZnO/PbI2/perovskite p–i–n junction.

Transient photovoltaic (TPV) measurements can be used to understand a semiconductor's photoinduced charge carrier dynamics, such as photoinduced charge carrier lifetime and transfer, charge transport direction as well as semiconductor conductivity type. Presently, TPV measurements are widely used to understand the mechanism of photocatalysis processes,31–34 but there are very few reports of TPV applications in thin film solar cells.35–37 In this study, TPV measurements were conducted in order to further clarify the relationship between the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics and the device stability as well as evaluating the photovoltaic performance of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO nano-array thin films and solar cell devices.
The photoinduced charge carrier lifetime of active materials, carrier transfer and the quality of the heterojunction all play crucial roles in solar cell design and fabrication. CH3NH3PbI3 is a thermodynamically unstable semiconductor used in the fabrication of high photoelectric conversion performance solar cells. The thermodynamic instability of CH3NH3PbI3 leads to variation in the solar cell device performance and stability because CH3NH3PbI3 will gradually decompose into PbI2 at both the interface of the heterojunction and in the bulk of CH3NH3PbI3. These two key materials, CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2, in perovskite solar cells were carefully studied using the TPV method (Fig. 4). The TPV curves of CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2 show a negative signal with a 355 nm laser. The constant negative TPV signal was caused by the photoinduced electrons gathering at the light-illuminated side, indicating that CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2 are both P type semiconductors.38 The fact that CH3NH3PbI3 is a P type semiconductor is consistent with other reports on two-step fabricated CH3NH3PbI3.39 The photoinduced charge carrier transfers of pure CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2 were compared, as shown in Fig. 4. For CH3NH3PbI3, the TPV signal rapidly reached its maximum while for PbI2, the signal took a relatively long time to reach its maximum. The difference in TPV signals can be explained by the difference in charge mobilities of CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2. Of these two semiconductors, PbI2 has a slower charge mobility rate than CH3NH3PbI3. In order to evaluate the influence of PbI2 on charge transfer, we used the equation Tt/Tr = L where Tt is the time that the photoinduced carrier concentration reached its maximum, Tr is the time of the complete recombination of the photoinduced carrier, and L is the ratio of Tt and Tr which is always between 0 and 1. A smaller L value means a faster photoinduced carrier transfer, which indicates there is less PbI2. For CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, the Tt and Tr values were approximately 7.5 × 10−8 s and 4.0 × 10−4 s, respectively, and therefore, the corresponding L value (CH3NH3PbI3) was 1.4 × 10−4 (see Table S1 in ESI†). Pure PbI2 thin film was a limited condition when CH3NH3PbI3 completely decomposed into PbI2. In PbI2 thin films, the Tt was about 7.3 × 10−6 s, Tr was about 4.0 × 10−4 s, and the corresponding L (PbI2) was 1.38 × 10−2 (see Table S1 in ESI†). The L value of PbI2 was two orders of magnitude higher than CH3NH3PbI3, and this suggested that the photoinduced carrier transfer in PbI2 was quite slow compared to CH3NH3PbI3. The higher L value also implied that there remained a degree of photoinduced charge carrier transfer ability under this limited condition. More interestingly, the photoinduced charge carrier lifetime, which is important for a high performance photovoltaic device, of PbI2 was almost as long as CH3NH3PbI3. A long carrier lifetime results in a high open circuit voltage.40–42 These results indicated that a moderate amount of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 was not as terrible for solar cell performance as generally imagined.
 Fig. 4  TPV curves of fresh perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) and PbI2 on FTO substrates at 355 nm (FTO side illuminated, ∼70% RH fabrication). 
TPV measurements of freshly prepared CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO, stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO and PbI2/ZnO thin films under UV (355 nm) and visible (532 nm) irradiation are shown in Fig. 5a and b. CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO can absorb 355 nm light, which can be used to understand the influence of the heterojunction quality on the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics. 532 nm light cannot be absorbed by ZnO, but it can excite the two key semiconductors, CH3NH3PbI3 and PbI2, in perovskite solar cell devices to generate electrons. 532 nm light can be used to study the influence of the interface PbI2 on the photoinduced charge carrier transfer.
 Fig. 5  TPV curves of fresh perovskite/ZnO, stored perovskite/ZnO and PbI2/ZnO at 355 nm (a), and 532 nm (b) (ZnO side illuminated), and ZnO/perovskite/HTL at 532 nm (HTL side illuminated) (c). The perovskite/ZnO thin films were stored for about 20 days under ∼40% RH. 
As expected, freshly prepared and stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films showed different TPV signals with 355 nm light illumination (Fig. 5a). These TPV signals indicated that different photoinduced charge carrier dynamic processes occurred in these two thin films. The TPV curve of freshly prepared CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films was constantly negative (about 10−7 s to 10−3 s). The TPV signal of freshly prepared CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films rapidly reached its maximum value and then started to decline (Fig. 5a, red line). In contrast, stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films displayed a positive TPV signal from approximately 10−7 s to 10−6 s. After 10−6 s, a negative TPV signal appeared, and then completely decayed at about 10−3 s. The positive TPV curve in stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films was similar to that of the pure ZnO nano-array thin films (see ESI,† Fig. S6). Additionally, the same trend in the TPV curves was observed for stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films and PbI2/ZnO but with different signal intensities. The above results supported two important conclusions. Firstly, under 355 nm light illumination, photogenerated electrons and holes of CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO can be separated and efficiently transferred by p–n junctions that formed in freshly prepared CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films. Secondly, in stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films, the formation of PbI2 between CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO resulted in a CH3NH3PbI3/PbI2/ZnO p–i–n junction, instead of a CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO p–n junction, and this junction transformation caused the observed variation in the TPV signal.
355 nm light has the ability to raise the TPV response in ZnO, PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3, and therefore, the recorded TPV curve was a result of multiple factors. In order to further understand the influence of PbI2 on the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics, 532 nm light was also used to differentiate the TPV responses of freshly prepared and stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films.
For the freshly prepared CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films, 532 nm light excitation generated electrons that rapidly gathered at the ZnO side (illumination side). This led to the TPV signal reaching its maximum at 6.1 × 10−8 s, followed by a decay curve in the TPV signal intensity until 5.7 × 10−4 s. This trend in the TPV curve was almost the same with 355 nm light (Fig. 4, red line). In contrast, the stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin film had its maximum TPV intensity at 2.2 × 10−6 s which was faster than the 1.2 × 10−5 s in the PbI2/ZnO thin film, and then completely decayed at 8.4 × 10−4 s. These results indicated that (1) the photoinduced charge transfer in stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films was blocked by PbI2, but was still faster than that of pure PbI2/ZnO thin films; (2) stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films still had the ability to quickly separate and transfer photoinduced charge carriers under visible light; and (3) the perovskite crystal surface may be passivated by PbI2, reducing the charge recombination. The TPV curve of ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/HTL thin films is shown in Fig. 5c. The HTL illuminated using a 532 nm beam exhibited a positive signal from the accumulation of photoinduced holes at the HTL surface. Charge transfer in ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/HTL was primarily affected by the HTL due to its low carrier mobility, characteristic of organic semiconductors.
It is important to note that the kinetics of PbI2 generation will determine the perovskite solar cell stability and performance. We found that the L value of stored perovskite/ZnO thin films when excited with either 355 nm or 532 nm light was larger than that of the freshly prepared samples (see Table 1). This result indicated that the process of storing CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO samples led to a slight decrease in the photoinduced charge transfer, which was caused by PbI2 formation. In particular, the total PbI2 content was proportional to the above L value, which connects the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal decomposition kinetics. Considering that both moisture10 and light illumination43 can lead to the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3, this detailed relationship and mechanism requires further study.

The measured TPV curves of the stored CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO and PbI2/ZnO solar cell devices are plotted in Fig. 6 and display very different photogenerated carrier dynamic processes. Both of the TPV signals recorded under 355 nm and 532 nm light of the stored solar cell devices exhibited much longer photoinduced carrier lifetimes than CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films (without HTL and Au electrode, see Fig. 5a and b), which indicated that the solar cell devices possessed more efficient photoinduced carrier separation and transfer and collection abilities than CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. The performances of PbI2/ZnO solar cell devices were also studied in order to further understand the mechanism of stability in the stored perovskite solar cells (Fig. 6). Relatively slow carrier separation and transfer processes were observed under both 355 nm and 532 nm light illumination; however, PbI2 and PbI2/ZnO thin films showed long photoinduced charge carrier lifetimes (Fig. 4 and 5a and b). Based on the above TPV measurements we found that the stored perovskite solar cells still maintained carrier separation and transfer abilities, which are important for the relative stability of the device performance.
 Fig. 6  TPV curves of stored perovskite and PbI2/ZnO solar cell devices with 355 nm (a) and 532 nm light illumination (b) (ZnO side illuminated). The perovskite solar cell was stored for about 270 days under ∼40% RH. 
Combining the above TPV results of the thin films and devices fabricated at high RH condition, we speculate that the robust fabricated method promotes device stability by protecting the CH3NH3PbI3 in the ZnO mesoporous structure against moisture. The CH3NH3PbI3 that deeply infiltrated into the ZnO nanorod mesoporous scaffold can be protected by the PbI2 layer, and shows a relatively fast photoinduced carrier transfer and long carrier lifetime (Fig. 5b). The mechanism has been summarized in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Proposed mechanism for PbI2 formed on the surface and interface of CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO (a); corresponding energy level diagram of the fresh and stored thin films (b). (Fabricated under ∼70% RH, stored under ∼40% RH). 
In the current experiments, the slightly formed PbI2 may act as a moisture defender to enhance the stability of the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO mesoporous solar cell device (Scheme 1a). PbI2 in the fresh CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO solar cell device and thin film were revealed using XRD (Fig. S7†). Although CH3NH3PbI3 is very sensitive to moisture, the robust fabrication process does not lead to much more PbI2 between the CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO interface, and results in a good quality p–n junction. Interestingly, some high performance perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x also have the appearance of PbI2,8,9 which also suggest the positive role of PbI2 crystals in perovskite solar cells. Along with the increase in surface and interface PbI2 during the storage of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films at 40% RH, the band alignment can be changed. The corresponding energy level alignment is illustrated in Scheme 1b. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of CH3NH3PbI3 are generally reported to be 3.92 and 5.42 eV, respectively.28 The CBM and VBM values of PbI2 are 3.45 eV and 5.75 eV,44 while the CBM and VBM of ZnO are 4.19 eV and 7.39 eV,45 respectively. In a fresh CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin film, a small part of the CH3NH3PbI3 decomposed into PbI2 at the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO interface and the band energy alignment can be considered as a CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO p–n junction (Scheme 1b, left). Over time, PbI2 increased at the ZnO and CH3NH3PbI3 interface and it can be considered to have a p–i–n structure (the corresponding energy alignment is shown in Scheme 1b, right). A balanced amount of PbI2 between the ZnO and CH3NH3PbI3 interface improved the quality of the heterojunction, and the performance can be enhanced, and this coincided with the initial PCE increase during the storage stage (see Fig. 3a). In addition, the passivation effect of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells has been reported recently,44 and the surface and interface recombination can be reduced which are important for improving the performance of perovskite solar cells. It should be noted that the chemical kinetics of CH3NH3PbI3 decomposition could be slowed down rather than stop the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals during storage with the protection of the ZnO porous structure and surface PbI2. However, PbI2 crystals are semiconductors with high resistance and a wide band gap, and the continued increase of PbI2 between the CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO interface will result in a high barrier which prevents electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 to the ZnO conduction band, and so performance degeneration occurs.
According to the above TPV results, we believe that the appearance of a moderate amount of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO nano-array thin films did not drastically reduce the solar cell performance as generally imagined for moisture conditions. There were three aspects that affected the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics in CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO nano-array thin films as well as the solar cell devices. Firstly, the porous ZnO nano-array scaffold and the interface/surface PbI2 protected the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, and the decomposition rate of CH3NH3PbI3 decreased. Furthermore, the relatively fast carrier transfer of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO was maintained. Secondly, the photoinduced charge carrier lifetime is very important for solar cell devices. Compared to CH3NH3PbI3, PbI2 possessed a considerable long carrier lifetime, which is an important factor for maintaining the perovskite/ZnO nano-array solar cell performance during storage. Finally, PbI2 crystals at the ZnO and CH3NH3PbI3 interface increased over time, and resulted in variations in the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO p–n junctions. As a result, the CH3NH3PbI3/PbI2/ZnO p–i–n structure may be dominate, instead of the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO p–n junction and therefore this affects the performance of the solar cell device. Fortunately, such a p–i–n structure maintained a relatively fast charge transfer ability, which is good for stabilizing the performances of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO nano-array solar cells. Combined with the PCE and FF values as well as the TPV analysis, it could be deduced that the p–i–n junction characteristic did not change but the junction quality slowly decreased with increasing PbI2 amount/thickness after 250 days storage.
Experimental
FTO substrate treatment
The 20 Ω sq−1 FTO substrate was cut into 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm pieces, and an insulation line was patterned using a diamond scribe. The patterned FTO was cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner filled with detergent solution for 20 min, soaked in an ammonia/hydrogen peroxide/deionized water (volume ratio, NH3·H2O:H2O2:H2O = 1:2:5) solution at 80 °C for 30 min, and finally ultrasonicated in deionized water for 10 min and dried at 80 °C.
High transmittance ZnO scaffold growth
The patterned FTO surface was coated with a 30 nm uniform Zn film using magnetron sputtering, the thickness of which was controlled using a film thickness monitor (FTM). The sputtered Zn thin film was annealed at 350 °C for 3 h to form the dense ZnO layer. A 20 mM ZnO precursor solution was made by mixing 10 mL Zn(NO3)2 (0.1 M), 40 mL H2O, and 1 mL NH3·H2O. The FTO substrate with the pre-synthesized ZnO dense layer was placed in the precursor solution and heated at 70 °C for 30 min, then washed and dried to obtain the mesoporous ZnO scaffold.
Perovskite solar cell device fabrication
CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was infiltrated into the porous ZnO scaffold via a two-step method. Specifically, 4.62 g of PbI2 was dissolved in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Alfa Aesar) and stirred at 70 °C for 3 h to prepare a 1 M PbI2 precursor solution. A 10 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I solution was prepared by dissolving 0.3 g of CH3NH3I in 30 mL of 2-propanol (Alfa Aesar). Both PbI2 and CH3NH3I were synthesized in the lab. The PbI2 solution was dropped onto the ZnO coated FTO substrate which was spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. The PbI2 coated FTO substrate was then immersed in the CH3NH3I solution for 30 s and washed with 2-propanol for 1–2 s, then the sample was transferred to an oven immediately and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. The hole transporting layer was deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer by spin-coating a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, Luminescence Technology Corp.) solution at 3000 rpm for 1 min. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was generated by mixing 80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD with 28.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile), which was then dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, the Au electrode was evaporated on the Spiro-OMeTAD surface. The entire fabrication process was carried out with 70% RH and the device was stored at 40 ± 3% RH without any encapsulation.
Characterization
The structure of the thin films was studied using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA and a scanning step of 0.02° per second. A FEI Quanta 250 FEG recorded the surface and cross-sectional SEM images. The photovoltaic performance (J–V) was measured using AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination with a Newport solar simulator equipped with a 1000 W xenon lamp and a Keithley 2440 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Newport EQE system in AC mode, and the monochromatic light source was a 300 W xenon lamp. TPV measurements were carried out using a method similar to Wang et al.46 Briefly, a sample chamber like a parallel-plate sandwich-like capacitor consisted of a film of the samples on the FTO substrate facing down with a piece of mica placed between the sample and bottom electrode. An ultrafast laser pulse (355 nm and 532 nm with a pulse width of 4 ns) was used as a light source and generated by a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Quantel Brilliant Eazy: BRILEZ/IR-10). A 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (TDS 3054C, Tektronix) recorded the transient surface photovoltage data. TPV singles of the solar cell devices were collected using a digital oscilloscope under the 355 nm and 532 nm laser.
Conclusions
Highly stable CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray bulk heterojunction solar cell devices have been fabricated, which retain more than 70% of their initial PCE after storing at 40 ± 3% RH over 250 days. The variation of Voc, Jsc and FF values were recorded during storage. It shows that the Voc value decreased by 23.6% and the Jsc value decreased by approximately 26.7%. But the FF value changed little compared with the initial measurement. Our study reveals that PbI2 plays a positive role in stabilizing the performance of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO porous structure solar cell devices. The surface PbI2 acts as a moisture defender to protect CH3NH3PbI3. This layer slows down CH3NH3PbI3 decomposition. A PbI2 insulation layer between the CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO interface may change the p–n junction to a good quality p–i–n junction in the ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. As a result, the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO thin films and devices stored for a long time maintain relatively fast photogenerated carrier charge separation and long carrier lifetime. These crucial properties result in a relatively stable performance in CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanoarray solar cell devices. Nevertheless, excessive PbI2 leads to performance degeneration due to both surface and interface PbI2. Our research also suggests that the main effect of moisture on the photovoltaic performance lies in the chemical kinetics rather than the chemical thermal dynamics in CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO porous structure solar cells.
