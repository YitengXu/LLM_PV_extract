    , Accepted 27th May 2015First published on 27th May 2015AbstractSolution-processed hybrid perovskite of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) exhibits an abnormal luminescence behavior at around the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition temperature. The combination of time resolved photoluminescence (PL), variable excitation power PL, and variable-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) allows us to clearly interpret the abnormal luminescence features in the phase transition region of MAPbI3. Both PL and XRD results unambiguously prove the coexistence of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of MAPbI3 in the temperature range of 150 to 130 K. The two luminescence features observed in the orthorhombic phase at T < 130 K originate from free excitons and donor–acceptor-pair (DAP) transitions, respectively. The comprehensive understanding of optical properties upon phase transition in MAPbI3 will benefit the development of new optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Novel light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic solar cells such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X: Cl, Br, I) have attracted much attention, following the pioneering work on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.1–6 Particularly, a breakthrough in the methylammonium (CH3NH3: MA) lead iodide (hereafter denoted as MAPbI3) perovskite was achieved recently, when the energy conversion efficiency of the hybrid perovskite photovoltaic devices was found to reach up to 19.3%.1 Further studies suggest that MAPbI3 crystals can become even promising for lasing applications.7–10 According to previous reports,8,11 tetragonal MAPbI3 exhibits a broad PL band around its band-gap energy of ∼1.6 eV. As temperature (T) decreases, tetragonal MAPbI3 transforms into an orthorhombic phase along with an abnormal emission blue-shift. Such orthorhombic MAPbI3 possesses two emission features. Wehrenfennig et al.12 and Wu et al.13 assigned the two emission features to the phase coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases. However, Fang et al.14 and Xing et al.7 attributed the two features to bound-exciton and free-exciton emissions. No consensus has been reached because of insufficient experimental evidence, especially concerning the underlying physical mechanisms in the phase transition T region. Although the symmetry and electronic structures of MAPbI3 crystals have been widely studied,15–19 these results could hardly be used to interpret the optical properties of the orthorhombic MAPbI3 because of little consideration of the impact of crystal defects involved. Since the optical properties of a semiconductor material are related to both intrinsic and extrinsic properties, PL spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and useful tool to assess both the intrinsic, e.g., band structure, excitons, and defects, and extrinsic features, such as impurities. Indeed, a comprehensive understanding of the optical properties of the orthorhombic MAPbI3 is required in order to expand the application fields of MAPbI3 and to develop new optoelectronic devices based on this material system.14
In this work, time resolved PL (TRPL) and variable-excitation-power PL characterizations are performed to study the luminescence features of MAPbI3 in different T regions. Moreover, the crystalline phase structures of the MAPbI3 crystal are also characterized by variable-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our results clarify the origin of the two PL features of orthorhombic MAPbI3. As T is between 150 and 130 K, these two PL features are attributed to the phase coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases with different band-gap energies. As T falls below 130 K, the two PL features are dominated by the donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombination. We conclude that the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition for the solution-processed MAPbI3 is a gradual process, which is related to the defects in the crystal.
2. Experimental section
2.1 CH3NH3I synthesis
CH3NH3I was synthesized by reacting 30 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 32.3 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitate was recovered by putting the solution on a rotary evaporator and carefully removing the solvents at 50 °C. The yellowish raw product methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was washed with diethyl ether by stirring the solution for 30 min, a step that was repeated three times, and finally recrystallized from a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and ethanol. After filtration, the solid was collected and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
2.2 MAPbI3 synthesis
The film of MAPbI3 on a Si substrate was formed by dropping a 40 wt% precursor solution of equimolar CH3NH3I and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone onto the Si wafer which was first hydrophilic treated by the aqueous solution of H2O2 and NH4OH with a volume ratio of H2O2:NH4OH:H2O = 1:1:5 for 30 min. The film formation was realized by spin-coating at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and then 2500 rpm for 40 min in air. The film coated on the Si wafer led to the change in color upon drying at room temperature, indicating the formation of MAPbI3 in the solid state. The MAPbI3 film was annealed in air for 15 min at 100 °C.
2.3 Characterization
The MAPbI3 film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer (Model EMPYREAN) with a monochromatic Cu Kα1 radiation. The lattice parameters were precisely determined using Si powders as the internal standard reference material. Steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were measured using an Edinburgh FLS920 spectroscopy system, using laser excitation at 405 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was carried out using a Hitachi S4800 operating at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV.
3. Results and discussion
It is known that surface morphology influences the luminescence features and dynamics of crystal materials. Proper control of the crystalline shape and size could be essential for random lasers.20,21Fig. 1 shows the top view SEM of the as-prepared MAPbI3 film with distinct crystal grains. It is seen that the grain sizes of MAPbI3 are between 100–500 nm, similar to the previously reported one.22 The SEM confirms that the film is conformal and spatially homogeneous. This helps one to exclude the random signals during the following PL measurements.

Fig. 2(a and b) present the PL spectra acquired for the MAPbI3 perovskite-crystal film at temperatures between 300 K and 10 K in steps of 10 K (a detailed picture of temperature-dependent PL can be found in Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2(a), the maximum of the PL band (labeled ‘Peak_T’) in tetragonal MAPbI3, which is due to the near-band-edge (NBE) transition,8,11,12 locates at 783 nm (1.58 eV) at room temperature. NBE here is noted as that the PL of MAPbI3 at variable temperatures could come from the free carrier or free exciton recombination, as Yamada and his coworkers23,24 found that the exciton binding energy of MAPbI3 could change from ∼30 meV at 13 K to 6 meV at 300 K, and the excitons could be dissociated by thermal energy at high temperatures. The location of the PL band agrees well with the latest experimental results, which have proved that the band-gap energy of tetragonal MAPbI3 is ∼1.60 eV,8,11–14,23 rather than 1.5 eV as predicted by theoretical computation. It has been widely accepted in the work related to the area of solar cells.25–30 Peak_T exhibits a continuous red-shift as T decreases from 300 K to 140 K, which is in contrast to typical semiconductors and may be due to the change in material parameters. With a further decline in T, Peak_T begins to blue shift, leading to the feature at lower temperatures labeled ‘Peak_OII’ in Fig. 2(b). This fact is in accordance with the observation of variations in the absorption edge of MAPbI3.12,31 In contrast to the tetragonal phase, the orthorhombic MAPbI3 possesses two PL features, marked Peak_OI and Peak_OII, as shown in Fig. 2(b). With the decrease in T, Peak_OI shows a monotonous red shift throughout the whole low temperature range, while Peak_OII initially blue-shifts (140 > T > 80 K) and thereafter red-shifts (T <80 K). This complex variation in Peak_OII was also noted in the literature by other groups.12–14 Here, the strain effect of different substrates on the PL properties of MAPbI3 can be ruled out, since the MAPbI3 grown on different substrates, such as glass,12,14 quartz,13 and Si, features similar PL behavior. The intricate variation of the PL spectra observed in the low temperature range is hence attributed to an inherent characteristic of the orthorhombic MAPbI3.

Since the orthorhombic MAPbI3 is a direct-band-gap crystal,17,18,30 multiple PL peaks indicate that there are multiple radiative recombination centers involved, e.g., intrinsic defect states, extrinsic impurities, and residual tetragonal MAPbI3 crystals. As mentioned in the Introduction, there are two different viewpoints on the origin of Peak_OII: (1) the inclusion of the tetragonal phase11,13 and (2) bound-state excitons in orthorhombic MAPbI3.12 However, the origin of the continuous variations in PL resulting from the phase transition was disregarded. In order to solve this problem, TRPL is performed at three typical temperatures around the phase transition temperature, ranging from 150 to 100 K. Fig. 3(a–c) shows TRPL spectra of the MAPbI3 perovskite at different time delays after the excitation pulse, where the dashed lines denote the shift of the emission peaks. The TRPL spectra of MAPbI3 measured at high temperatures are also provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†) for comparison. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), there are no obvious emission energy shifts with time delay after excitation in tetragonal MAPbI3. This observation is consistent with previous reports on the homogeneously broadened emission line width of tetragonal MAPbI3.8,24 By contrast, at 140 K, Peak_OII slightly red-shifts with time after excitation, indicating a different emission mechanism from that of Peak_T. As T further decreases, a more evident red-shift in Peak_OII is observed. This observation suggests that there is a migration of photo-excited carriers to lower energy sites as a function of time delay after a pulsed excitation. The evident temporal red shift in Peak_OII at 120 K coincides well with a DAP recombination behavior. The photon energy and the recombination rate of the DAP-related emission are determined by the following equations, respectively: ℏω = Eg − EA − ED + e2/(4πε0εR)(1) 1/τDA ∝ exp[−2(R/αD,A)](2)where Eg is the band-gap energy, ε0 is the static dielectric constant and ED and EA are the donor and acceptor binding energies, respectively; R is the distance between ionized donors and acceptors; (τDA)−1 and αD,A are the radiative recombination rate and the larger Bohr-radius equivalent of the donor and acceptor, respectively. Thus, the emission energy (ℏω) from the spatially close pairs is higher than that from the spatially distant pairs because of the larger Coulomb interactions for the former. In addition, the electron–hole recombination probability for close pairs is higher than that for distant pairs because of greater wave function overlap. Therefore, the recombination rate for the high-energy transition is larger than that for the low-energy transition, which results in faster decay times for the photons with shorter wavelengths in the PL band.32 The wavelength-dependent PL lifetimes measured at different T are illustrated in Fig. 3(d). The lifetimes are obtained by fitting tri-exponential decay functions. The difference between the lifetimes on the long and short wavelength sides is gradually increased from <50 ns at 140 K to 270 ns at 120 K. We thus conclude that Peak_OII is due to the DAP recombination at T < 120 K. As T is in the range of 140 to 120 K, MAPbI3 is in a transition state where two phases coexist. The TRPL spectra demonstrate that the transition from Peak_T (NBE recombination) to Peak_OII (DAP recombination) is a gradual process. The gradually increased red shift in Peak_OII with a decrease in T can be interpreted as the decreased content of the tetragonal inclusions in the host orthorhombic MAPbI3. Herein, we propose that Peak_OI is the NBE emission of the orthorhombic MAPbI3, i.e., free exciton recombination due to the large binding energy at low temperature range as discussed above. This can be explained as follows: on the one side, the emission energy of Peak_OI locates at 740–750 nm (as shown in Fig. 2(b)), which is close to the absorption maximum of orthorhombic MAPbI3 (740–760 nm).31 On the other side, after a pulsed excitation, no time-dependent emission-energy shift can be observed, which is similar to the case of Peak_T in tetragonal MAPbI3.

Tetragonal inclusions in the orthorhombic phase of MAPbI3 can potentially trap photo-excited excitons due to the narrower band gap of tetragonal MAPbI3 crystals than orthorhombic.18,33 Thus, a large density of free excitons could agglomerate and eventually recombine within these inclusions.12 This proposal can be supported by the fast quenching (within less than 10 nanoseconds) of Peak_OI at 120 and 130 K as shown in Fig. 3(a and b). It can additionally explain the blue-shift in Peak_OII with a decrease in T beginning from 140 K rather than from 160 K. Particularly, the excitons with a large binding energy trapped in tetragonal MAPbI3 during phase transition provides a potential candidate for optoelectronic device applications, especially for lasers since the exciton confinement can lower down the gain threshold.7Fig. 4 illustrates the physical picture of the carrier transfer and recombination processes in the coexisting phases.
 Fig. 4  Diagrams schematically displaying the band structure for the two phases of the MAPbI3 perovskite at 130–150 K. Excitons are confined in the tetragonal phase due to the narrower band gap of the tetragonal MAPbI3. 
Since Peak_OII begins to red-shift when T is lower than ∼80 K, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the PL properties of the orthorhombic MAPbI3 in the temperature range <80 K are further studied by performing an additional excitation-power-dependent PL measurement at 77 K. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Due to the limited density of defect states in the crystal, the emission intensity of Peak_OII exhibits a clear saturation behavior at high excitation powers, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5, whereas the emission intensity of Peak_OI increases almost linearly with increasing excitation power. This fact manifests the free-exciton nature of the emission labeled Peak_OI, while Peak_OII denotes the emission related to defect states in the crystals, i.e. DAP related transition. Besides, as the excitation power increases from 20 to 160 mW, Peak_OII blue-shifts from 783 to 777 nm. This evidence can help one to safely exclude the possibility that Peak_OII originates from free-exciton recombination of the tetragonal MAPbI3, since the blue shift in emission with the increase of the excitation power is a typical characteristic of DAP recombination.34 At low-power excitation, low density electrons and holes are excited by absorption of the pumping laser beam. The excited carriers can quickly relax to and are trapped by the neutral donors or acceptors, hence primarily distant DAP recombination can occur. While at high-power excitation high density carriers are excited, the relaxation of hot carriers leads to the filling up of the donors and acceptor energy levels, thus close DAP recombination can be seen. The DAP-related emission thus blue shifts with the increase of the excitation power according to eqn (1).

Peak_OI and OII are obtained by Lorentzian deconvolution from the PL spectra of MAPbI3 which are highlighted with pink and blue, respectively. Inset: the evolution of the PL intensity for Peak_OI,II along with increasing excitation power. 
Next, we want to support our findings from PL measurements with a complementary investigation of the crystal structure by XRD measurements. Fig. 6 illustrates the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 crystals obtained at different temperatures. At room temperature (∼300 K), the XRD peaks assigned to the (110), (220) and (330) diffraction at 14.109°, 28.461° and 43.062°, respectively, confirm the formation of a tetragonal perovskite structure with lattice parameters of a = c = 8.866 Å and b = 12.668 Å. At 13 K, strong peaks at 14.359, 28.973, 32.032 and 40.909 Å, corresponding to (101), (202), (301) and (242) diffraction, respectively, confirm the orthorhombic structure of the perovskite with lattice parameters of a = 8.855 Å, b = 12.614 Å and c = 8.571 Å.1,4,5,35,36 The refined lattice parameters of MAPbI3 at different temperatures ranging from 13 to 300 K are tabulated in Table SI (ESI†). From the XRD pattern at 150 K, which is near the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition T,14,16,33 we can clearly observe the orthorhombic phase (highlighted by asterisks). This observation indicates that there is still a residual tetragonal phase (highlighted by exclamatory marks), although tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition has already taken place. When T is lower than 130 K, the typical peaks from the tetragonal phase are not observed. Some factors could result in this phase coexistence, such as unequal thermal expansion and the spontaneous change of the in-plane lattice constants during the phase-transition.12,33 The defects in the MAPbI3 crystal may also induce the phase coexistence.37,38 Our XRD results clearly show the coexistence of the two phases at T from 150 to 130 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is for the first time that the phase coexistence of MAPbI3 around the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition Tt-o is observed through XRD, which has been predicted by previous articles.11–13,21
 Fig. 6  (a) XRD patterns of MAPbI3 at typical temperatures. The exclamatory marks and asterisks are used to identify the existence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, respectively. 
Defects in semiconductors can have an important effect on the optical and electrical properties of the crystals. Without intentional doping, MAPbI3 can perform either as a p or n type conductor, depending on the growth parameters.17,25,30 This fact confirms the existence of intrinsic defects in the MAPbI3 crystals. Unfortunately, a little literature exists on the defect physics of MAPbI3 around the phase transition T.15,18,33 Our work shows that donors and acceptors can simultaneously exist in MAPbI3 and their energy levels in the bandgap are temperature dependent. These characters could be utilized in the development of novel optoelectronic devices, for example, one may tune light emission of the material via precise control of the operation temperature of a lighting source. The phase transition is primarily induced by the angular distortions of the [PbI6] octahedral, i.e., I− anions in the c axis direction transversely displace from the mid-point of the Pb–Pb distance to which they are constrained in the ideal crystallographic description.18,19,33 It is hence expected that if the DAPs are related to I or Pb, the emitting photons by the DAP recombination will give rise to a distinct shift around phase transition Tt-o, according to eqn (1). This may explain the blue shift of Peak_ OII as T decreases from 140 to 80 K. Yin et al. theoretically predicted the formation energies and the locations of the defects acting as donors and acceptors in the band structure in cubic MAPbI3 perovskite.30 According to the prediction, lead and iodine vacancies (denoted by VPb, and VI, respectively) with low formation energies can be easily formed due to the strong Pb lone-pair s-orbital and I p-orbital antibonding coupling. We thus expect that Peak_OII observed in orthorhombic MAPbI3 is related to the intrinsic defects, VPb, and VI, which needs confirmation by precision calculation of theorists.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we deliberately studied the abnormal luminescence properties of MAPbI3 at the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition T ranging from 150 to 120 K. Two luminescence features upon the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition are observed in steady-state PL measurements. TRPL, variable-excitation-power PL, and variable-temperature XRD characterization are performed at low temperatures to support the interpretation of the origin of two luminescence features at the phase-transition region of MAPbI3. In conclusion, our PL and XRD results unambiguously reveal the coexistence of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of MAPbI3 in the temperature range of 150–130 K. When T is lower than 130 K, the two luminescence features observed in the orthorhombic phase originate from free excitons and DAP transitions, respectively. Our results highlight a comprehensive understanding of optical properties upon phase transition in MAPbI3, and we are confident that the findings will benefit the development of new optoelectronic devices based on perovskite materials.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  A top view SEM image showing the surface morphology of the MAPbI3 film. Inset is the enlarged graph for clear observation of the grain size and shape.	 

 	Fig. 2  PL spectra of the MAPbI3 perovskite-crystal film at variable temperatures, the arrows indicate the evolution of the maximum of the PL band: (a) MAPbI3 in the tetragonal phase and (b) MAPbI3 in the orthorhombic phase.	 
ℏω = Eg − EA − ED + e2/(4πε0εR)	(1)
1/τDA ∝ exp[−2(R/αD,A)]	(2)

 	Fig. 3  TRPL spectra of MAPbI3 measured at (a) 140 K, (b) 130 K, and (c) 120 K. (d) Wavelength dependent PL lifetimes of MAPbI3 at different temperatures.	 

 	Fig. 4  Diagrams schematically displaying the band structure for the two phases of the MAPbI3 perovskite at 130–150 K. Excitons are confined in the tetragonal phase due to the narrower band gap of the tetragonal MAPbI3.	 

 	Fig. 5  The excitation power dependent PL spectra of MAPbI3 measured at 77 K. Peak_OI and OII are obtained by Lorentzian deconvolution from the PL spectra of MAPbI3 which are highlighted with pink and blue, respectively. Inset: the evolution of the PL intensity for Peak_OI,II along with increasing excitation power.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) XRD patterns of MAPbI3 at typical temperatures. The exclamatory marks and asterisks are used to identify the existence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, respectively.
