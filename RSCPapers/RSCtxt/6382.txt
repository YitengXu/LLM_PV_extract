    , Accepted 11th October 2012First published on 12th October 2012AbstractCounter electrodes from polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANi) nanostructures were fabricated by chemical and electrochemical approaches for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. It was found that double-layered PANi consisting of a nanoparticle layer and a nanofiber layer was formed by an electrodeposition route, given significantly increased active sites and solar cell performances. The solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the double-layered PANi-based DSSC was 6.58% under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), which was much higher than those of PPy and chemically deposited PANi or Pt-based DSSCs. The enhancement in the conversion efficiency was due to the design of double-layered nanostructures, which resulted in an increased charge transfer kinetics and higher electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are electrochemical devices that convert solar energy to electrical power characterized by a high efficiency, low cost, simple preparation and a low environmental impact.1,2 The main challenge in the improvement of cell performances is focus on developing a core counter electrode (CE) that reduces I−/I3− redox in regenerating the sensitizer after electron injection and serves to transfer electrons from the external circuit back to the redox electrolyte. Therefore, a highly effective CE should offer many advantages including low electrical resistance and high electrocatalytic activity for I−/I3− redox reaction to keep a low overvoltage and decelerated charge recombination. To date, the Pt electrode has been the leading CE due to its high conductivity and excellent catalytic property for I−/I3− redox species.3 However, the dilemma inherent in the widespread use of DSSCs for power generation is the high price of Pt materials. By addressing this issue, it is a prerequisite to seek an alternative CE not only to keep the high efficiency but also to reduce the cost and develop a facile route to synthesis. Conducting polymers,4–7 such as polyaniline (PANi) and polypyrrole (PPy), have attracted increasing attention as promising candidates for Pt CE due to their good electrocatalytic activity, low cost, simple synthesis, versatile processability, high electrical conductivity, and good environmental stability. To meet the commercial application, nanostructured conducting polymers are always employed to provide the high specific surface area for redox reaction.
Here we demonstrate the use of double-layered PANi and PPy nanostructures synthesized by chemical polymerization and electrodeposition approaches, for the first time, as CEs for DSSC applications. The highest solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 6.58% is achieved using electrodeposited PANi as a CE. The focus of this article is on the microstructural characterization and preliminary solar cell performances.
2. Experimental
Synthesis of PANi and PPy nanostructures

Chemical deposition of PPy. 
2 mL of pyrrole was mixed with 300 mL of DI-water. Under vigorous agitation, 300 mL of FeCl3 solution (molar ratio of pyrrole to Fe3+ is 1:1) was added to the above mixture. An ITO conductive glass substrate (12 Ω cm−2) was immersed in the reactant for 24 h at 4 °C. Finally, the ITO substrate was rinsed by ethanol and DI-water, and subsequently dried at 60 °C to get a nanostructured PPy coated ITO counter electrode.


Electrochemical deposition of PPy. 
An ITO substrate was immersed into the aqueous solution containing 1.0 M HClO4 and 0.5 M pyrrole. PPy was grown from the surface of the ITO glass under a voltage of 0.8 V for 120 s. The electrodeposited PPy counter electrode was obtained by rinsing with DI-water and drying in air.


Chemical deposition of PANi. 
The pH of a mixture solution containing 2 mL aniline and 300 mL DI-water was adjusted to 2.5. Potassium persulfate (KPS, molar ratio of aniline to KPS is 1:1) aqueous solution of 300 mL was added into the above mixture for the polymerization of aniline monomers. Chemical deposition of PANi was performed by immersing the ITO substrate into the reactant for 24 h at 0 °C, and the emeraldine PANi electrode was finally rinsed with ethanol and DI-water and air dried.


Electrochemical deposition of PANi. 
A cyclic voltammetric method was employed in a three-electrode setup (CHI 604B, CH Instrument, Austin, TX, USA) comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (CHI 111), a platinum sheet as a counter electrode (CHI 115) and an ITO glass substrate as a working electrode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in a mixture (the pH was around zero) of 1.0 M HClO4 and 0.5 M aniline at room temperature for 71 cycles by scanning the potential from −0.2 to 0.9 V and back to 0.4 V at a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1.

Fabrication of Pt counter electrode
The Pt counter electrode was prepared via the thermal decomposition of a mixed solution of H2PtCl6 and isopropyl alcohol. H2PtCl6 isopropyl alcohol solution with a concentration of 0.4 wt% was dipped onto the surface of the ITO glass, which was subsequently heated at 450 °C for 10 min to obtain the fresh Pt electrode.
Assembly of DSSCs
A layer of the TiO2 nanocrystal anode film with a thickness of 10 μm was prepared according to the report.8 The DSSC was fabricated by combining the dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and ITO supported PANi or PPy counter electrode. A redox electrolyte comprised 0.01 M LiI, 0.001 M I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile.
Characterizations
The photovoltaic tests of the DSSCs were carried out by measuring the current–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves using an Electrochemical Workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) under irradiation of a simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W) in ambient atmosphere.9,10 The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The fill factor (FF) and light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (η) was calculated according to the equations:    where JSC is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), VOC is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, Pmax is the maximum power output, and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of maximum power output in the J–V curves, respectively. The morphologies of the resultant PANi and PPy counter electrodes were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-3500N, Hitachi, Japan). We use a conventional CHI660C setup comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (CHI 111), a platinum wire as a counter electrode (CHI 115), a film working electrode, and a freshly polished and cleaned working electrode for the measurement of CV. The curves were recorded from −0.1 to +0.65 V and back to −0.1 V at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. CV was first performed on the pristine working electrode. The experiment was continued only if the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks of ferrocyanide was lower than 59 mV. All the CV curves were scanned in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 + 0.15 M NaCl solution. Before the measurement, the electrolyte was degassed using nitrogen for 10 min. Also, the cell was kept under flowing nitrogen during the experiments. All the measurements were performed in air and a dark condition. Impedance spectra were recorded after the CV measurement using an A.C. impedance mode.11,12 The frequency range was between 105 and 0.01 Hz using a voltage of 0.2 V for a potential window around the midpeak potential determined from the CVs. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer. The UV-vis spectra were measured with a double beam mc2 spectrophotometer (Safas, Monaco) by dissolving the samples in DI-water. The spectrum of the DI-water was taken as the reference spectrum. All the UV-vis spectra were recorded in the range of 200–1050 nm.
3. Results and discussion
Morphologies and mechanism
The microstructures of the PPy and PANi coated ITO electrodes were observed by SEM. The chemical deposited PPy electrode, as shown in Fig. 1a and b, indicates an unhomogeneous and rough surface with a uniform grain size of around 1 μm. A more detailed image presented in the inset of Fig. 1b further reveals that the grains are disconnected with a large gap between them, indicating an enhanced resistance of charge transfer. Therefore, the chemically deposited PPy electrode is not ideal for efficient DSSCs. Fig. 1c and d show the surface morphology of the electrodeposited PANi film, giving a dense and interconnective surface. This compact microstructure would provide good electrical conduction and low electrical resistance for electron transfer, however, goes against the diffusion of electrolyte into the counter electrode and loading of I−/I3− redox. The weak contact between the electrolyte and the PPy electrode results in a low electrode kinetics and poor DSSC performance. The intricate distribution of large PANi particles from chemical deposition (Fig. 1e and f) increases the transfer path of charges and internal energy barrier. The low specific surface area for electrolyte loading in combination with poor contact between PANi and electrolyte promote chemically deposited PANi not to be an efficient CE material for high-performance DSSC. Fig. 1g and h show SEM images of electrochemical deposited PANi, exhibiting well-defined fibrous morphology with a diameter of 100 nm. The nanofiber network characteristic of PANi can significantly facilitate the redox reaction of the electrolyte into the thus made CE.13

The magnifications in images (a)–(h) are ×2k, ×10k, ×10k, ×50k, ×1k, ×3k, ×5k, and ×20k, respectively. The magnification of the inset is ×100k. 
The morphology of the electrodeposited PANi electrode was further examined under SEM. When viewed from the top surface at a low magnification (Fig. 2a), the electrode appears to contain uniform porous structures all across the surface. At a higher magnification (Fig. 2b), it is revealed that the porous structures are actually formed by uniform nanofibers. The diameter of the nanofibers is around 100 nm. Some thin filament structures, 50 nm or so in diameter, can also be observed at the inclusion of PANi nanofiber film. When the sample is cross-sectionally viewed, the morphology and the multilayer of the PANi electrode are clearly revealed (Fig. 2c and d). Three distinct layers in morphology are shown with the ITO layer at downmost, PANi nanoparticle layer in the middle and PANi nanofiber layer at upmost. However, the PANi layer close to ITO is formed by homogeneously dense nanoparticles (Fig. 2e). The unique multilayer structure is expected to provide enhanced solar cell performances.

The magnifications in images (a)–(e) are ×2k, ×50k, ×2k, ×10k, and ×10k, respectively. 
The dense PANi nanoparticle layer provides excellent contact with the ITO electrode and low interfacial resistance. 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 + 0.15 M NaCl solution was employed as an electrolyte to monitor the electroactivity and characterize the charge transfer behavior between the PANi and ITO electrode by cyclic voltammetry, which are shown in Fig. 3a. As a comparison, the CV curve of a chemically deposited PANi electrode recorded at the same conditions is also plotted. From the figure, it is clearly seen that the oxidation and reduction peak currents of electrodeposited PANi are both much higher than that of chemically deposited PANi, meaning the enhancement of FeIII/FeII electrochemical reaction and a lower hindrance to the interfacial transfer between ITO and PANi layers.14 Impedance measurements can also study the redox reaction resistance and equivalent series resistance. The EIS data were analyzed using Nyquist plots. Nyquist plots show the frequency response of the electrode–electrolyte system and are a plot of the imaginary component (Z′′) of the impedance against the real component (Z′). Each data point is at a different frequency with the lower left portion of the curve corresponding to the higher frequencies. The more vertical the curve corresponds to a cell, the closer to an ideal capacitor. As shown in Fig. 3b, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the PANi electrodes can be obtained from the length of the semi-circle. The electrodeposited PANi electrode shows a decreased ESR, indicating a higher kinetics in electron transport,12,15 which is consistent with the results of CV study. As a reference, the EIS spectrum of the Pt electrode was also recorded. The ESR of the Pt electrode is higher than that of electrodeposited PANi but lower than that of chemically deposited PANi.

The growth process of PANi nanofibers is recorded by observing the SEM morphologies at various cycles. Only a few nanofibers are observed after electrodeposition of 25 cycles (Fig. 4a). More filament structures with a diameter of around 50 nm form at 40 cycles' electropolymerization (Fig. 4b). However, the filament structures become interpenetrated PANi nanofibers with the process extending to 55 cycles (Fig. 4c). The growth mechanism of layered PANi nanostructures is believed to include seed nucleation and elongation processes.16–18 The initial electrodeposition stage is mainly controlled by the PANi seed nucleation where the protonated aniline monomers is oxidized by applied voltage because of the localization of electron pair on nitrogen;17,18 by integrating neutral aniline monomers, the polymerization reaction starts to form dense and coiled PANi nanoparticle films. In the previous studies, Liu et al. have found that dense PANi nanoparticles can be electrodeposited at a high current density;19 however, PANi nanowires are only obtained at a lower current density. Zhang et al. pointed out that the electrical resistance of a dense PANi nanoparticle film increases gradually with the process of electrochemical polymerization.16 Unfortunately, no report has revealed the potential growth mechanism of layered PANi films under the drive of an electrochemical scan. By combining their research, we can make a conclusion that the compact PANi nanoparticle film is formed on the ITO substrate in the first few electrodeposition cycles because of the low electrical resistance (12 Ω cm−2) and therefore the high current density of the applied electrical signal. The dense structure will stop the electrolyte solution through the PANi nanoparticle layer, resulting in the significant enhancement of electrical resistance of a new substrate (i.e. dense PANi layer coated ITO) due to the low conductivity of PANi compared to ITO (Fig. 3b).20–22 Therefore, the actual current density is decreased and the PANi nanofiber layer is grown from the nucleation sites of the first layer.

Molecular structures
Infrared spectrography is a useful technique in characterizing the structures of materials. From the micro-transformations in FTIR spectra, we can detect the changes in structures and analyze the potential mechanism subsequently. To reveal the inherent molecular structure, the assignments for the FTIR bands of chemical and electrochemically deposited PANi and PPy are determined and shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. A long tail at wavenumbers higher than 2000 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of PANi (Fig. 5a) is an indication of a conducting form of PANi (i.e. emeraldine state).24 The bands at 800–900 cm−1 are the characteristic peaks of para-substitution of the aromatic ring, which indicate a head-to-tail polymerization mechanism of PANi.21 The sharp band at 1159 cm−1 for chemically deposited PANi and 1176 cm−1 for electrodeposited PANi has been associated with high electrical conductivity of PANi. However, the shift from 1159 to 1176 cm−1 indicates a high degree of electron delocalization in PANi and therefore better electrical and electrochemical performances.25 The infrared spectrum of chemically deposited PPy also differs from the spectrum of the PPy via the electrochemical route (Fig. 5b). A reduction in the absorption band at wavenumbers higher than 2000 cm−1 is observed in the spectrum of chemically deposited PPy. The appearance is in good correlation with the reduced conductivity. The band assigned to C–N stretching vibration in the pyrrole ring, observed at 1495 cm−1 in the spectrum of chemically synthesized PPy, is blue-shifted to a lower wavenumber, 1487 cm−1 in the spectrum of electrochemically polymerized PPy. This is connected with the influence of doping degree on the skeletal vibrations, involving the delocalized π-electrons.23

The UV-vis spectroscopy was conducted at room temperature to detect the electrical structure of PANi. Fig. 6 exhibits the optical spectra of chemically and electrochemically polymerized PANi in the scan scale of 200–1050 nm. All the absorption bands of PANi can be found in the spectra. The spectra are dominated by three absorption peaks at 242, 380 and 720 nm. The 242 and 380 nm bands are often assigned to a π→π* transition and the polaron band →π* transition in the benzoid structure, respectively.18,26 The band at 720 nm is assigned to the π→localized polaron band. The appearances of these bands indicate the chemically deposited PANi is in the emeraldine salt form of PANi, which is consistent with the study from FTIR. The red shift of the polaron transition band from 720 nm from the chemical route to 897 nm via the electrochemical route can be attributed to the formation of longer conjugation chains because of the polymerization in a lower pH reactant.27 From the red-shift in the UV-vis spectra, H+ attached to the N sites in the molecular chain can be expected to increase the torsional angle appended by the trans-cis-azobenzene photoisomerization between adjacent rings, which causes the extension of orbital overlap between the phenyl π electrons and the N lone pairs and therefore increases the energy level of πq.

DSSC performances
The schematic diagram of the interior of the double-layered PANi CE fabricated DSSC is shown in Fig. 7. The high charge transfer kinetics between PANi double-layers and ITO implies that the reduction of I3− is more facile on the electrodeposited PANi electrode than that of the PANi electrode via a chemical approach. Fig. 8 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs with electrochemically deposited PANi electrode. As a comparison, the curves from other electrodes such as chemically deposited PANi and PPy, and electrodeposited PPy are also plotted. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs: short current density (JSC), open voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 2. Among the four DSSCs, the chemically deposited PPy fabricated DSSC exhibits the highest JSC and VOC but the maximum FF because of poor distribution and the large size of PPy particles, resulting in a low electrocatalytic activity to I−/I3− redox and therefore η. Although the FF from electrodeposited PPy DSSC is higher than that via a chemical route, the VOC is lower because of the contact structure of electrodeposited PPy. The electrolyte cannot diffuse into the PPy CE for a high electrochemical catalysis, suggesting an η of only 4.65%. However, the final η is much higher than that of chemically deposited PANi DSSC and PPy DSSCs. The porous structure, well-penetrated fibers, long conjugation structure, high electrical and electrochemical performances as well as double layers provides a higher specific surface area and capacity to electrolyte loading, more active sites and higher electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. The recorded η is as high as 6.58%, which is much higher than 3.92% in our chemically synthesized PANi-based DSSCs and 5.5% from sulfamic acid-doped PANi-based DSSCs,4 2.64% from in situ oxidative polymerized PANi-based DSSCs,28 5.60% from electrodeposited PANi-based DSSCs29 and 6.0% from Pt-based DSSCs.29,30

4. Conclusions
In summary, double-layered PANi consisting of a layer of compact PANi nanoparticles and a layer of PANi nanofibers was fabricated by an electrochemical deposition approach. The growth mechanism of double-layered PANi is proposed to be the reduction of external current density due to the enhancement of electrical resistance of the substrate. Electrochemical and structural characterizations reveal that electrodeposited PANi has high charge transfer kinetics, and good electrical and electrochemical performances. When used as a CE, an electric energy conversion efficiency of 6.58% is achieved under a simulated solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which is much higher than those with chemically deposited PANi and PPy and electrodeposited PPy CEs.
