    , Accepted 29th March 2019First published on 1st April 2019AbstractThe proposal of pseudocapacitive materials breaks the barriers between batteries and capacitors, allowing for the possible achievement of a balanced energy-power performance. However, the limited reserve of lithium restricts the practical applications of pseudocapacitive materials in lithium-based systems, whereas sodium resources are abundant with the similar properties to lithium, but there is a lack of suitable pseudocapacitive materials for sodium-based systems. The exploitation of pseudocapacitive materials for Na+ storage is urgent. This study, for the first time, reports a sonochemical approach, involving intercalation and ultrasonic exfoliation processes, to prepare composite K2Mo4O13/α-MoO3 (i.e., KMO) nanorods, and the possible applications of the KMO nanorods in Li+/Na+ pseudocapacitance were evaluated. The as-synthesized KMO possessed a uniform rod-like morphology formed by assembling nanoneedles (or nanobelts) with a large apparent aspect ratio of more than 10. Both in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the KMO nanorods exhibited efficient pseudocapacitance, which was not observed in the pristine MoO3–Na system. In SIBs, the as-synthesized KMO delivered a capacity of 895 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1, which was much higher than that of the pristine MoO3–Na system. Moreover, it was found that the b values of KMO (i = avb, current i and scan rate v in the CV curves) were over 0.9 at potentials ranging from 1 V to 2 V in SIBs, indicating an obvious pseudocapacitive process. Benefiting from the layered K2Mo4O13 nanorods built with edge-shared distorted MoO6 octahedra, the Na+ ions with a larger size could be intercalated into the spaces between the double MoO6 plates. This sonochemical approach based on the intercalation and exfoliation chemistry opened a new path to prepare molybdenum-based nanostructures for superior Li+/Na+ pseudocapacitance applications on a large scale in a low-carbon and environment-friendly manner.
Introduction
The rapid development of secondary energy sources, including wind, solar and tide, promotes the application of electrochemical storage devices.1–3 In general, the energy densities of electrochemical devices are determined based on the formula E = 1/2CU2, where C is the specific capacitance and U is the working voltage window.4,5 For the sake of higher energy density, various organic electrolytes are used to increase the working voltages. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with organic electrolytes are applied in numerous fields, including portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs) and other small- or mid-electric stations.6–8 However, traditional LIBs usually exhibit low power densities, which necessitate a long charge time. In addition, the rapid consumption of lithium resources has led to the skyrocketing of Li's prices.9–11 Fortunately, pseudocapacitive materials can effectively enhance the power densities without sacrificing any energy properties owing to their combination of high energy densities of batteries and high power densities of supercapacitors.12–14 To alleviate the tensions caused by the limited lithium resources, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been recently widely investigated. However, the SIBs also face the problem of insufficient power densities.15–17 To the best of our knowledge, investigations on pseudocapacitive materials for SIBs are seldom reported, and further attention is urgently needed.
There have been many types of pseudocapacitive materials reported, including conductive polymers,18,19 doped nano-carbons,20–24 metal–organic frameworks,25 metal oxides,26–28 nitrides,6,29 and sulfides.30–32 Dunn et al. reported that Nb2O5 exhibited a typical pseudocapacitive behavior with an intercalation mechanism for the first time, opening the door for pseudocapacitance studies on oxides.33,34 Because of the resource abundance and better power performance of the sodium ion-based electrochemical devices, investigations on pseudocapacitance in SIBs are of great significance.35–37 MoO3 is a kind of layered oxide that exhibits comparable potentials to Nb2O5 in LIBs.38,39 Low-temperature orthorhombic MoO3 units contain chains of double-layered zigzag MoO6 octahedrons with connected corners, stacking together with a weak van der Waals force in interlayers.40 Due to their low toxicity and cost, MoO3-based pseudocapacitive materials are practical for industrial applications. However, the inadequate lattice spacing of the pristine MoO3 cannot provide enough pseudocapacitance, especially for the ions with a larger radius, such as Na+ and K+.39–41
To realize the pseudocapacitive behaviors in SIBs or potassium ion batteries (PIBs), developing electrode materials with an opened framework is very important. As a derivative of MoO3, the low-temperature orthorhombic K2Mo4O13 phase exhibits a unique opened framework with a layered structure and connected tunnels, having the potential for applications in the Na+/K+-storage. Eda et al.41 synthesized orthorhombic K2Mo4O13 using a hydrothermal method and proposed that the orthorhombic K2Mo4O13 species are composed of infinite double MoO6 chains, built up by corner-sharing linkages of edge-shared MoO6 (Mo(3)/Mo(4)) dimers and edge-shared Mo(1)O5/Mo(2)O6 dimers.41 However, studies on the synthesis and the applications of potassium molybdate in electrochemistry have been rare so far, and the reported synthetic processes usually require high temperature treatments or long reaction times.42,43
Herein, we introduced a novel room-temperature sonochemical method to synthesize composite K2Mo4O13/α-MoO3 nanorods (i.e., KMO) for energy-storage applications in LIBs and SIBs. The KMO nanorods obtained under optimum conditions took on a large apparent aspect ratio of more than 10 with a strong texture orientation along the [100] direction of MoO3. Compared with the pristine MoO3 phase, the as-obtained composite KMO nanorods not only exhibited excellent electrochemical properties in LIBs, but also outperformed in the SIBs due to their macroscopic one-dimensional structures and microscopic open skeletons. The sonochemical approach developed on the basis of intercalation and exfoliation chemistry opened a new efficient path to prepare molybdenum-based nanostructures for superior Li+/Na+ pseudocapacitance applications on a large scale in a low-carbon and environment-friendly manner.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
All chemical reagents used in these experiments were purchased from Sinopharm Group and used without further purification. In a typical process, 4.23 g of molybdic acid was added into a mixture of ethanol (124 mL) and C8H17NH2 (12.4 mL) under magnetic stirring at room temperature for about 72 h. Then, the as-obtained suspension was filtered and washed with deionized water for several times. The sample, named as (C8H17NH3)@MoO4, was collected and dried at room temperature. Then, 4.56 g of (C8H17NH3)@MoO4 was calcined at 500 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 25 °C min−1 in air. There was about 2.76 g of white-gray MoO3 powder (named CMO) obtained after the calcination treatment with a yield of 60.5%.
The K2Mo4O13/α-MoO3 nanorods (KMO) were prepared via a sonication method at room temperature. Typically, 6 g of the above-mentioned MoO3 powder was dispersed into a mixture of 60 mL deionized water and 60 mL ethanol under magnetic stirring. Then, another 9 g of KCl and 1.2 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to the above suspension. An ultrasound probe with a diameter of 10 mm was inserted 1.5 cm below the solution level, and worked under an ultrasound power of 600 W for different times to elucidate the morphology change in the sonochemical reaction process with a pulse cycle of 3 s on and 2 s off. Finally, the KMO samples were collected by centrifugation and were washed with water and ethanol several times, and dried at 120 °C for more than 2 h in an ambient atmosphere. In this study, KMO refers to the sample obtained by sonication treatment for 2 h unless there are no special instructions. For comparison, (C8H17NH3)@MoO4-derived MoO3 plates, i.e., CMO, were also used as electrodes in LIBs and SIBs. Moreover, to investigate the effect of MoO3 precursors on the phase structures, the micro-scale MoO3 powder obtained by calcining commercially available molybdic acid (H2MoO4) at 500 °C for 1 h was also used as the precursor to prepare KMO samples.
Characterizations
The phase structures of the as-obtained samples were determined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method on a micro-area X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2500, Rigaku) with a Cu Kα radiation under a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 300 mA. The morphologies and sizes of the samples were observed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova 230, FEI Company) with EDX equipment (Amatek Edax Inc.). The powder samples for the SEM observation were coated with a thin Au film. TEM images, HRTEM images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded on a field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, Tecnai G2 F20, Philips) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The TG-DSC curves were recorded on a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA/DSC, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland).
Electrochemical test

Preparation of electrodes. 
Slurries were prepared by mixing the active materials (e.g., KMO), carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in the N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solution under magnetic stirring for 12 h at room temperature. Then, the slurries were coated on the copper foils via a doctor blade method and dried in a vacuum oven overnight. The loading mass of the electrode was about 2 mg cm−2.


Electrochemical test. 
Half cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with the metal Na or Li plates as counter electrodes. For the lithium ion batteries, the electrolyte was a LiPF6 solution (1 M) in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). For sodium ion batteries, the electrolyte was a NaClO4 solution (1 M) in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) tests were performed on a Land battery test system. EC-Lab Electrochemical workstation (Bio-Logical VMP3) was used for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz and cyclic voltammetry (CV) at various scan rates.

Results and discussions
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-obtained samples are shown in Fig. 1a and S1a.† As shown in Fig. 1a, there are four kinds of XRD patterns corresponding to (A) commercial molybdic acid, (B) the (C8H17NH3)@MoO4 hybrid, (C) the hybrid-derived MoO3 plates, and (D) the KMO nanorod samples. The commercial molybdic acid is a mixture of intermediate phases containing certain amount of water, which make it difficult to determine its specific phases. With the addition of C8H17NH2, the water molecules in the structure reacted with the amine groups, forming a molybdate-based inorganic–organic hybrid compound. There are several intense diffraction peaks in the 2θ-angle range of 1.5–20°, indicating the existence of a layered phase. The peaks at 2θ = 3.8°, 7.7°, 11.5°, and 15.3° can be indexed to the reflections of the (010), (020), (030) and (040) planes of the layered hybrid compound.44 After calcination at 500 °C, (C8H17NH3)@MoO4 was transferred to the MoO3 sample of CMO. As shown in Fig. 1a (XRD pattern (C)), the positions of the strongest three peaks are located at 2θ = 12.5°, 25.7° and 39.0°, which can be indexed to the (020), (040) and (060) planes of α-MoO3 (ICPDS: No. 05-0508). Due to the influence of a strong texture, three strong peaks (the (020), (040) and (060) planes) could also be observed in the XRD pattern of the KMO nanorod samples (Fig. 1a, pattern (D)). To exclude the influence of this orientation, the precursor was changed from CMO to the common MoO3 powder obtained by directly calcining the commercial molybdic acid. As shown in Fig. S1a,† after sonication for 2 h under the same condition as KMO, the as-obtained sample shows the combined phase characteristics of α-MoO3 and K2Mo4O13 without any enhanced peaks. As shown in Fig. S1b,† the contents of element K and the K2Mo4O13 phase in KMO are also exhibited with the reaction time. At the beginning (0 min and 1 min), the content of K2Mo4O13 is almost 0. With the increase in the reaction time, the content of K2Mo4O13 exhibits a proportional relationship to the reaction time; when the reaction time reaches 20 min, the content of K2Mo4O13 reaches 2.31%. All of these results confirm that the content of the K2Mo4O13 phase can be controlled with the reaction time. Furthermore, the morphologies of the molybdic acid-derived α-MoO3 and its derived α-MoO3/K2Mo4O13 sample are shown in Fig. S2.† The α-MoO3 precursor had an irregular particle-like morphology with a size of about 1 μm, as shown in Fig. S2a.† After the sonication treatment, the irregular particle-like morphology changed into nanorods with smaller sizes (Fig. S2b†).

The TG-DSC curves of the (C8H17NH3)@MoO4 hybrid and KMO are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. As Fig. 1b shows, for (C8H17NH3)@MoO4, when the temperature reaches 470 °C, the mass of the final sample keeps constant, being about 38% of the mass of the (C8H17NH3)@MoO4 hybrid. Two weak endothermic peaks at 136 and 185 °C can be assigned to the desorption of n-octyl ammonium ions/molecules and the decomposition of crystal water in the Mo–O frames, respectively.44 There are two intense exothermal peaks at around 249 °C and 280 °C due to the oxidation of interacted organic molecules. The sharp exothermal peak at 460 °C corresponds to a combustion reaction of organics, and the final inorganic powder was CMO. Fig. 1c shows the TG-DSC curves, and there is an obvious endothermic peak at 105 °C with a 6.5% mass decrease, assigned to the desorption process of adsorbed water. The exothermic peak at 308 °C is due to the formation of potassium oxide and molybdenum oxide, and the endothermic peaks at 536 and 556 °C can be attributed to the phase changes of molybdenum oxide. When the temperature reaches 1000 °C, the metal oxides begin to volatilize, leading to a sharp mass decrease.43,45,46
The morphologies of the as-obtained samples and their precursors were observed under SEM and TEM. Fig. 2a shows that the precursor of commercial molybdic acid (H2MoO4) possesses a large particle size of up to 50 μm. After the intercalation reaction between H2MoO4 and C8H17NH2, the initial large particles of commercial H2MoO4 were peeled off and broken into plate-shaped morphologies, as shown in Fig. 2b. The as-obtained plate-like product, i.e., the (C8H17NH3)@MoO4 hybrid, was calcined at 500 °C under air atmosphere to form large CMO plates, and Fig. 2c show their typical SEM image. The CMO plates were then exfoliated by sonication to form KMO nanorods. Fig. 2d–f shows the typical SEM images of the KMO nanorods obtained by sonicating CMO plates for 2 h. The as-obtained product shows a rod-like shape with a large aspect ratio of more than 10, which is consistent with the oriented structure of the pattern (D) revealed in XRD. To obtain rod-like products with various high aspect ratios, sonication treatments with different sonication times were performed, and their SEM images are shown in Fig. S3.† With the increase in the reaction time, it can be found that the sample becomes increasingly slender and then, it gradually breaks. Compared with the samples with reaction times of 0.5 h, 3 h and 8 h, the sample with the reaction time of 2 h shows the largest aspect ratio of more than 10. Thus, this sample was further investigated as the electrode for both LIBs and SIBs.

Fig. 3 shows the TEM and element mapping images of the typical KMO nanorods with a sonication time of 2 h. The low-magnification TEM images shown in Fig. 3a–c indicate that the length of the KMO rods is about 2 μm, consisting of a bunch of nanoneedles with a width of 100–200 nm. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 3d indicates that the as-obtained KMO nanorod is of a single crystalline structure. As marked in Fig. 3d, the lattice stripes of 0.65 nm spacing distance can be attributed to the (020) plane of α-MoO3. The inset of Fig. 3c shows a typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with a zone axis of the [001] direction of the KMO sample, corresponding to the orthorhombic a-MoO3 phase (PDF 05-0508). To elucidate the elemental distribution of the as-obtained KMO nanorod (Fig. 3e), we conducted the elemental mapping with EDX. The typical images are shown in Fig. 3f–h. Clearly, the K, Mo and O elements in the selected areas are distributed uniformly in the KMO nanorod. Combining the above experimental data with our previous studies,44,47 the formation mechanism of the hybrid plates and resulting nanorods can be inferred. Molybdic acid is a hydrophilic layer-stacked compound with interlayer water,48 which forms a suspension when dispersed in ethanol, resulting from the acid–base reactions of molybdic acid and –NH2 groups. With the processing of acid–base reactions, the intercalation of C8H17NH2 will take place and keep reacting with the water molecules in molybdic acid, forming layered inorganic–organic hybrids. After the calcination step of the hybrids, the organic components gradually decompose and overflow from the layers to form large agglomerates with plate shapes. During the sonication process with PVP and KCl, the action of ultrasonic waves will help to peel off the molybdenum oxide plates to become KMO nanorods with the intercalation of potassium ions; the edge portion of the KMO nanorods can be dissolved due to the high energy from the sonication process.47

The electrochemical properties of the as-obtained KMO nanorods were systematically investigated by using them as the anode electrodes in the LIBs and SIBs. As mentioned above, the sample used here is the KMO sample with a reaction time of 2 h, having the large aspect ratio of 10. Fig. 4 shows the electrochemical properties of the KMO nanorods. Fig. 4a shows the rate performance of the KMO nanorods as an anode of LIB. One can see that at 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1 in the potential ranging from 0.01 V to 3 V, the KMO anode in LIB exhibits specific capacities of 895, 740, 601, 575, 400, 298 and 170 mA h g−1, respectively. Even at a high current density of 5 A g−1, the KMO anode still gives a high specific capacity of over 80 mA h g−1. As Fig. 4b shows, the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of the KMO anode is calculated to be about 74%, which is higher than that of most carbon-based anodes, suggesting the advantages of the KMO nanorods as an anode in full batteries. Comparatively, the rate performance of the CMO powders as the anode of LIB were also investigated (ESI, Fig. S4a†), and it is found that the specific capacities drop sharply from ∼160 to less than 10 mA h g−1 with the increase in the current densities from 0.02 to 5 A g−1. Fig. 4c shows the cycling performance of the KMO anode in LIBs at 0.2 A g−1. The KMO anode still exhibits a high specific capacity of over 250 mA h g−1 even after 200 cycles. When the current density increases to 1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 4d, the specific capacity drops first and then surprisingly increases to about 250 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. This electrochemical activation phenomenon caused by the structure pulverization has been observed in many transition-reaction based electrode materials. During the transition reaction involving Li and some oxides, the overall material structure will be transformed into amorphous structures, which bring about more active sites, leading to the increased capacity. Moreover, considering the layered and assembled structures of KMO, the intercalated lithium ions can effectively strip or split this structure, while exposing more lithium ion diffusion dominant surfaces. Fig. 4e shows the initial GCD curves in SIBs at a current density of 0.05 A g−1 when using KMO nanorods as the anode. The initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) drops to about 53.08% due to the severe irreversible reaction of the Na+ ions with a larger size. Fig. 4f shows the cycling performance of the KMO nanorods in SIBs at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, and the KMO anode exhibits a capacity of over 150 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles in the SIBs.
 Fig. 4  Electrochemical properties of KMO nanorods: (a) the rate performance as an anode of LIBs; (b) initial GCD curves in LIB at a current density of 0.05 A g−1; (c) cycling performance in LIB at 0.2 A g−1; (d) cycling performance in LIB at 1 A g−1; (e) initial GCD curves in SIB at a current density of 0.05 A g−1; (f) cycling performance in SIB at 0.1 A g−1. 
To investigate the enhanced properties of KMO, the cycling performance of the CMO powders as the anode in LIBs and SIBs were comparatively investigated (ESI, Fig. S5†). The specific capacity of the CMO anode in LIBs drops sharply from over 750 mA h g−1 to 100 mA h g−1 after just 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S5a†). When the current increases to 1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. S5b,† the CMO anode shows a specific capacity of about 100 mA h g−1 with obvious fluctuations, which is far less than that of the KMO anode. When the CMO anode was used in SIBs (Fig. S5c and d†), it showed low specific capacities of 70 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 150 cycles and 20 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1500 cycles, respectively.
The pseudocapacitive behaviors of the KMO and CMO electrodes were further investigated via the CV method, and Fig. 5 shows the typical results. Fig. 5a shows the initial CV curves of the KMO nanorods in the lithium system. The MoO3 phase in KMO is a typical layered oxide with a tunnel structure, while the K2Mo4O13 phase possesses a large frame structure in which the intercalation process of lithium ions can take place reversibly. In the first cycle, there are a couple of redox peaks existing at around 2.1 V and 3.1 V, which can be attributed to the intercalation and extraction processes of lithium ions, respectively. Since the material was discharged to a very low voltage when it is used as a negative electrode material, a partially irreversible conversion reaction occurred. In the second cycle, the overlapped reduction peak can be distinguished. Fig. 5b compares the CV curves of the KMO and CMO samples under a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. One can find that besides the existence of obvious pseudocapacitive peaks, the absolute area of the CV curve of the KMO nanorods is much larger than that of the CMO powders. Fig. 5c compares the CV curves of the CMO and KMO samples in SIBs at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Almost no peaks can be observed in the CV curves of CMO, indicating that no electrochemical reactions, such as intercalation, occur in the sodium ion system. However, some humps exist in the curves of KMO, especially in the potentials ranging from 1.5 V to 2 V. Intercalation-based pseudocapacitance is greatly influenced by the size of carriers, which leads to the shrinking of peaks in the CV curves. The pseudocapacitive behavior of the KMO nanorods in the LIBs is much more obvious than that in SIBs because the radius of Na+ is larger than that of Li+. Fig. 5d compares the EIS curves of the CMO and KMO anodes in LIBs before and after the electrochemical tests. For the KMO anode in SIBs, the EIS curves before and after the electrochemical test are almost the same shape, indicating that there is almost no SEI layer formed on the surface of the electrodes. When the CMO powders were used as the anodes in LIBs, the charge-transfer resistance of the CMO anode dropped from 90 Ω to 50 Ω before and after the electrochemical test due to the formation of the surface SEI layers.
 Fig. 5  (a) CV curves of KMO nanorods in LIBs at 10 mV s−1; (b) comparison of CV curves of CMO and KMO in LIBs at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1; (c) comparison of CV curves of CMO and KMO in SIBs at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1; (d) comparison of EIS curves of CMO and KMO in LIBs before and after electrochemical tests. 
In the CV curves, there is a relationship between the current i and scan rate v, i = avb, where a and b are constants.34,49 The values of b were determined based on the slope of a log(i) versus log(v) plot, which can be used to differentiate between a faradaic process or a capacitive process. When b = 0.5, it is a faradaic process, including intercalation, transition or insertion; when b = 1.0, it refers to a capacitive process. If the b value approaches 0.5, this electrode material is more prone to exist as a solid solution in a phase transition process. Moreover, if the b value approaches 1, behaviors like adsorption on the surface of a capacitor will occur, resulting in faster ion transport. For Mo-based composites, this fast capacitor-like ion transfer process is essentially an intercalation process. Based on this discipline, the b values of KMO and CMO at different potentials in LIBs and SIBs were investigated and are shown in Fig. S6.† The b values of the KMO sample at 0.1 V, 1 V, 2 V and 3 V are 0.69, 0.94, 0.91 and 0.87, respectively, suggestive of an obvious pseudocapacitive process in the KMO-based LIBs (Fig. S6a†). When the working potential increases from 0.1 V to 2 V (Fig. S6b–d†), the b values of CMO are much smaller than those of KMO. When the working potential is 3 V, the b values of both CMO and KMO are near 1, suggestive of a total capacitor behavior. The peak current of CMO at around 0 V is much higher than that of KMO in SIBs, indicating that a severe transition reaction process occurs in CMO as an anode of SIBs (Fig. S6f†). The cut-off potentials of using MoO3-based materials as cathodes in the SIBs were also investigated (ESI, Fig. S7†). When tested at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, the cut-off potential of the KMO cathode reaches 3.7 V, whereas the cut-off potential of the CMO cathode is only about 3.5 V (Fig. S7a and b†), indicating the enhanced anti-oxidized ability of the KMO sample compared with CMO. As exhibited in Fig. S7c and d,† with the increase in scan rates, the absolute areas of the CV curves for the KMO electrode in SIBs increase proportionally, whereas the CMO electrode shows different shapes from those of KMO. The above electrochemical data confirm that the KMO nanorods have excellent pseudocapacitive properties in both LIBs and SIBs.
Conclusion
In summary, for the first time, a scalable sonochemical method was developed to fabricate the K2Mo4O13/α-MoO3 nanorods (KMO) with high aspect ratios and uniform morphologies. Due to the larger open framework and one-dimensional morphology, the as-synthesized KMO nanorods exhibited excellent electrochemical properties in LIBs and unique pseudocapacitance in SIBs compared with the pristine MoO3. The unique intercalation, followed by a sonication method, can be used to synthesize other kinds of metal oxides with designated morphologies. Moreover, because of the efficient pseudocapacitance, resulting from the intercalation of K+, it is expected that further optimization could effectively enhance the electrochemical properties of the KMO electrode. The combination of intercalation and exfoliation processes promotes the formation of rod-like nanocomposites, greatly extending the “top-down” approach to synthesize low-dimensional nanomaterials. Regulations on structures, contents and morphologies of nanomaterials can further be expanded by the incorporation of ultrasound and intercalation chemistry to the existing synthetic strategies.
