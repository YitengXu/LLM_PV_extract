    , Accepted 23rd August 2016First published on 23rd August 2016AbstractPlanar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PHJ-PSCs) constructed with one-step precursor solution spin-coating deposition (OPSSD) usually give an extremely low performance mainly due to the poor morphology and low crystallinity of the perovskite films. In this work, by incorporating a suitable HONH3Cl additive in the perovskite precursor solution, a high quality perovskite film with improved morphology and crystallinity was obtained. The UV-vis measurement of the CH3NH3I solutions without and with HONH3Cl demonstrates that the improved quality of the perovskite film can be easily attributed to a combined effect of N2, I2, H2O and CH3NH3Cl originating from the oxidation of CH3NH3I triggered by the HONH3Cl additive, which can manipulate the crystallization process of the perovskite. Accordingly, the improved performance for the HONH3Cl-induced PHJ-PSCs can also be demonstrated. At the optimized molar ratio of 1:1:0.1 for PbI2:CH3NH3I:HONH3Cl, the PHJ-PSCs exhibit an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.61 ± 0.51%, which is much higher than that of pristine 1:1:0 based cells without additive (7.21 ± 0.61%), and the best performing HONH3Cl-induced device can yield a PCE as high as 11.12% with a Jsc of 18.42 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.95 V and FF of 0.63. Introducing suitable HONH3Cl as an additive into the perovskite precursor solution is really an effective route to enhance the performance of the PHJ-PSCs via OPSSD.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by Miyasaka et al. in 2009,1 tremendous enthusiasm and extensive efforts in the photovoltaic research area have been witnessed worldwide.2–7 Quite recently, the PCE of PSCs has skyrocketed to a certified 22.1%,8 comparable to the commercial crystalline silicon-based solar cells. This is attributed to extraordinary photovoltaic materials with desirable features, such as high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths (100–1000 nm) and lifetimes (∼100 ns) and decent am-bipolar transport behavior, etc.9–11 Apart from the above advantages, PSCs can also be realized by cheap and facile solution deposition methods which have great potential in large-scale production. Currently, the most utilized solution process methods for perovskite films are mainly divided into two classes, namely, one-step precursor solution spin-coating deposition (OPSSD) and two-step solution sequential deposition (TSSD).12,13 Although high-quality perovskite films with optimal crystallinity and uniform morphology can be obtained by the TSSD method, the OPSSD method has attracted intensive interest due to its simple processing steps and shorter overall processing time compared with TSSD.14 However, the OPSSD approach usually encounters a bottleneck for its intensive application, especially for PHJ-PSCs, which always results in rough and discontinuous films with many pinholes due to overly rapid evaporation of the solvent and nucleation reactions during the spin-coating process.14–16 A poor perovskite film is very detrimental to device performance because of the deleterious impact on the extraction/dissociation/transport of the photo-generated carriers. Therefore, to prepare highly efficient PHJ-PSCs by OPSSD, it is extremely crucial to seek more desirable approaches for improving the quality of perovskite films with optimal surface morphology.
Recently, in order to optimize the morphology, improve the crystallinity of the perovskite films, and further achieve highly efficient PSCs, many effective approaches have been reported in the preparation process of perovskite films, such as regulating the thermal annealing process of the perovskite films and solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution.17–20 However, these approaches often result in a lot of extra operational steps and need severe operating conditions. Introducing additives into the perovskite precursor solution is another extremely effective approach for controlling the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films by modulating the crystallization process, such as DIO, TBP, hypophosphorous acid (HPA), alkali metal halides (KCl, NaCl and LiCl), N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone, I2, NH4Cl, CH3NH3I, ethylammonium iodide or PbCl2, etc.21–30 Despite all these additives being successfully utilized as additives for enhancing the quality of the perovskite films and the performance of the corresponding devices, many of them were merely applied in either mesoporous structure PSCs (MS-PSCs) or PHJ-PSCs prepared by TSSD. Therefore, it is extremely essential to find another effective additive for improving the morphology of perovskite films and further enhancing the performance of the PHJ-PSCs with the facile OPSSD method.
Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HONH3Cl) is commonly used as a reducing agent in organic synthesis and depolarizer in electrical analysis. Generally, it can be decomposed into NH3, N2O, H2O and HCl under high temperature.31,32 The chemical formula and structure of HONH3Cl is shown in Fig. 1a. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the flexible and facile utilization of HONH3Cl to control the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite for efficient PHJ-PSCs with OPSSD routes. As a result, 47 wt% of the perovskite precursor solution composed of PbI2 and CH3NH3I with a molar ratio 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl addition (PbI2:CH3NH3I:HONH3Cl) can produce a more uniform and more continuous perovskite film with clearly improved morphology, crystallinity and with fewer pinholes. Also, this resulting film exhibits an obviously enhanced UV-vis light absorption and photoluminescence (PL) intensity. Based on this strategy, with this optimized HONH3Cl addition in perovskite precursor solution, the average PCE of the corresponding PHJ-PSCs was significantly improved from 7.21 ± 0.61% to 10.61 ± 0.51%, and the best performing device in our work shows a satisfying PCE of 11.12% for PHJ-PSCs prepared with OPSSD.

Experimental
Materials
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized via a previously reported method.3 Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HONH3Cl) was obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Industrial Company. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. All other chemicals (PbI2, methylamine (CH3NH3), hydrogen iodide (HI), titanium isopropoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol (IPA), etc.) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Acros Organics and used as received without any purification. The conducting substrates were fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, 2.2 mm, 15 Ω per square, NSG, Japan).
Device fabrication
Initially, the patterned FTO, which were obtained by etching with 2 M HCl and Zn powder, were sequentially cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, respectively.17 After blow drying with clean nitrogen, the substrates were treated in oxygen plasma for 10 min.
The PHJ-PSCs with device architecture of fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO)/compact TiO2 (C-TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (80 nm) were constructed according to the following step. The TiO2 compact layer (C-TiO2) was first deposited by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in isopropanol (3000 rpm, 45 s) on the as-cleaned FTO substrates, then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Before use, the as-prepared C-TiO2 substrates were immersed in 0.02 mM TiCl4 solution at 80 °C for 30 min. Finally, the films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min after rinsing with deionized water and ethanol.
The CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared via one-step precursor solution spin-coating deposition (OPSSD) in a glovebox with N2 atmosphere. 47 wt% of the perovskite precursor solution without additive was obtained by dissolving PbI2 and CH3NH3I (with molar ratio of 1:1) into anhydrous DMF. To achieve the ternary mixture solution doped with HONH3Cl, a proper amount of HONH3Cl was added into the above binary mixture solution of PbI2 and CH3NH3I (with molar ratio of 1:1) into DMF. After that, the as-prepared mixture solutions were continuously stirred and heated at 70 °C for 12 h in the dark. For perovskite film preparation, the above-mentioned mixture precursor solutions were spin-coated onto the FTO/C-TiO2 substrates with a speed of 5000 rpm for 45 min. Thereafter, the as-constructed films were annealed at 110 °C for 20 min onto the hot plate. After the films were cooled to room-temperature, 20 µL of HTM solution was dropped onto the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM solution was prepared via dissolving 72.3 mg of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene(spiro-MeOTAD) in 1 mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene, then 30 µL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 18 µL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg of LI-TSFI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) were added as additives under energetic stirring. The devices were then left in a dry air atmosphere with low relative humidity in the dark for spiro-MeOTAD oxidation.25 Finally, 80 nm of back contact electrodes were deposited via thermally evaporating Au on the top of the spiro-MeOTAD-coated devices under a pressure of ca. 1 × 10−6 Torr.
Measurement and characterization
Initially, it needs to be noted that all measurements for the films and devices were accomplished in open air (>45% relative humidity). X-ray diffraction characteristics were conducted using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffraction instrument with Cu-Kα radiation. UV-vis absorption measurements were performed on a Japan Shimadzu model UV-2250 spectrophotometer. Steady-state (Ss) and time-resolved (Tr) photoluminescence measurements were carried out via an FLS 920 luminescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 425 nm which passed through a 650 nm low-pass filter. The annealing temperature of all samples was set at 110 °C for a period of 20 min. Especially, the samples for XRD and PL characterization were prepared by directly spin-coating the precursor solutions on clean glass slides. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded using a Rili SU 8000HSD Series Hitachi New Generation Cold Field Emission SEM. Elemental analysis and distribution measurement was performed with SEM (Rili SU 8000HSD) and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
The photocurrent and voltage properties of the PSCs were characterized using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation by applying an external bias potential to the solar cells under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) generated from an AAA Class 150 W solar simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, model XES-40S2-CE, Japan) with an AM 1.5G type filter. The light intensity was calibrated using a Newport Oriel PV standard reference cell and meter (model 91150 V); the photoactive area of the solar cells was 0.09 cm2 determined by a metal aperture, and the scan rate was 100 mV s−1. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using an IPCE measurement system (model 2931-C, Newport, USA) using a 300 W xenon lamp (model 66902, Newport, USA) with a 1/4 monochromator (model 74125 Oriel Cornerstone 260, Newport, USA), and the light intensity was calibrated using a silicon detector (model 71675, Newport, USA).
Results and discussion
In this report, the conventional TiO2-based planar heterojunction photovoltaic device with architecture of FTO/C-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (80 nm) was constructed to investigate the influence of HONH3Cl on the perovskite films and device performance. As shown in Fig. 1b, a series of perovskite precursor solutions in DMF consisting of PbI2, CH3NH3I and HONH3Cl additive with different molar ratios were prepared, denoted as pristine 1:1:0, 1:1:0.05, 1:1:0.075, 1:1:0.1, 1:1:0.2, and 1:1:0.3, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding perovskite films or PHJ-PSCs were also denoted as pristine 1:1:0 based film or PHJ-PSCs (devices) and other molar ratio (1:1:0.05, 1:1:0.075, 1:1:0.1, 1:1:0.2, and 1:1:0.3) HONH3Cl-induced films or PHJ-PSCs or devices, respectively. The detailed information about the preparation of the perovskite precursor solutions is described in the Experimental section. Clearly, the color of the precursor solutions gradually changes from light yellow to brown with increasing molar ratio of the HONH3Cl additive. In addition, Fig. 1c shows that a significant color change was also observed for the un-annealed CH3NH3PbI3 films via spin-coating the above different perovskite precursor solutions on the FTO/C-TiO2 substrates. The un-annealed film formed by the ternary precursor solutions with molar ratio of 1:1:0.1 for PbI2, CH3NH3I and HONH3Cl exhibits an obvious dark-brown color which is the characteristic color of the perovskite.27 According to this, we can conclude that the nucleation and growth process of the perovskite crystal can be manipulated by varying the amount of HONH3Cl additive.
The crystallinity of perovskite, which is an important parameter for assessing the perovskite film, directly determines the quality of the perovskite film and the properties of the resulting PSCs.21,25Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the different perovskite films without and with HONH3Cl addition. The strong diffraction peaks, located at 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9° in the XRD spectrum, correspond to the 110, 220, and 310 crystal planes of the orthorhombic lattice of the CH3NH3PbI3, respectively, which are in good agreement with the previous reports.33 Apparently, a noticeable enhancement for the characteristic peak intensities can be seen for the HONH3Cl-induced perovskite films with the increase of the molar ratio of PbI2, CH3NH3I and HONH3Cl ranging from the pristine 1:1:0 to 1:1:0.1. Especially, the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced film displays the strongest diffraction intensity characterized as the highest and sharpest peak intensity, which can be attributed to the improvement of the crystallinity due to the similar thicknesses of the films deposited by the same spin-coating process. For the 1:1:0.2 and 1:1:0.3 HONH3Cl-induced films with a higher molar ratio of HONH3Cl addition, an additional peak at 11.5° can be observed which is assigned to the characteristic peak of PbI2, indicating that excess HONH3Cl addition will lead to a result of a shortage of CH3NH3I, however, which is adverse to the complete crystallization of the perovskite film.

The UV-vis spectra of the perovskite films processed with different molar ratios of HONH3Cl addition are shown in Fig. 2b. Apparently, it can be seen that all the films, without or with HONH3Cl addition, show outstanding panchromatic absorption over the whole visible range with the onset at approximately 800 nm.34 Compared with the pristine 1:1:0 based perovskite film, the HONH3Cl additive induced films exhibit a much higher light absorption range from visible to near-infrared. Especially, the highest light absorption can be observed for the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced perovskite film. In addition, it should be noted that the light absorption increases with incremental HONH3Cl addition at low doping level (1:1:0.05, 1:1:0.075 and 1:1:0.1), but decreases at high doping level (1:1:0.2 and 1:1:0.3). This can also be explained by the high quality perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity, morphology and fewer pinholes controlled by the HONH3Cl additive due to the similar thickness for the films deposited by the same spin-coating procedure.
In order to further investigate the influence of HONH3Cl on the perovskite film and gain a deeper understanding of the role of the additive in perovskite crystallization, steady-state (Ss) and time-resolved (Tr) photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on the different perovskite films. As presented in Fig. 3a and b, the HONH3Cl-induced perovskite films show much higher PL emission intensity (excited at 425 nm) at 785 nm than the pristine 1:1:0 based film (without HONH3Cl addition). Furthermore, an extended PL lifetime can also be observed for the HONH3Cl-induced perovskite films, as seen in Fig. 3b. In comparison with other films, the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced perovskite film exhibits a much stronger PL intensity and a longer PL lifetime. The above results indicate that the nonradiative recombination of the perovskite film can be partially suppressed due to the enhanced electronic quality of perovskite films with much lower energetic disorder and density of defect sites by the addition of HONH3Cl.35–37
 Fig. 3  (a) Steady-state (Ss) and (b) time-resolved (Tr) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films without and with different molar ratios of PbI2, CH3NH3I and HONH3Cl addition in perovskite precursor solution. 
The morphology of the perovskite films without (pristine 1:1:0) and with HONH3Cl addition was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As illustrated in Fig. 4a and b, the pristine 1:1:0 based perovskite films are of poorer quality, with worse morphology and discontinuous coverage due to the presence of many submicrometer pinholes. Upon adding the HONH3Cl, significant improvement to the morphology of the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced perovskite films can be observed, as shown in Fig. 4d and e. By comparison, this film exhibits uniform and optimal morphology with noticeably enhanced surface coverage and fewer pinholes. More interestingly, the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced perovskite grains show a leaf-like shape with an average length above 5 µm. These grains are closely packed. The voids and pinholes on the perovskite film surface partly disappeared. Thereby, it can be inferred that the additive HONH3Cl in the precursor solution can encourage faster homogenous nucleation and directional growth of the nucleus. In addition, it can also be observed from Fig. 4e and f that the pristine 1:1:0 based perovskite film is composed of much smaller sized crystals than the HONH3Cl-induced perovskite film, meaning that there are fewer grain boundaries for the HONH3Cl-induced film, which allows us to predict suppressed charge carrier recombination during charge transport and dissociation.

To better reveal the nature of the effect of the HONH3Cl additive on the precursor solution and the resulting perovskite film, the UV-vis absorption measurement for different CH3NH3I solutions without and with HONH3Cl addition was performed. For comparison, the UV-vis results of I2 solution in DMF was utilized as a reference. As shown in Fig. 5a, there is a strong absorption around 365 nm for I2 solution in DMF, ascribed to the characteristic absorption peak of I2.24 In contrast, we can not observe a clear absorption peak around the same wavelength for the CH3NH3I solution. However, after adding the HONH3Cl into the CH3NH3I solution, an apparent increase in the absorption peak around 365 nm can be seen, indicating formation of I2 due to the addition of HONH3Cl. This was also confirmed by the color of the precursor solutions as shown in Fig. 1b. Accordingly, a probable reaction mechanism is thus proposed (Fig. 5b) to elucidate production of I2 with HONH3Cl being added into the pristine 1:1:0 solution of PbI2 and CH3NH3I in DMF. Generally, HONH3Cl will decompose into NH3, N2O, H2O and HCl under certain conditions (i.e. high temperature), as shown in reaction (1) in Fig. 5b. Obviously, as illustrated in reactions (2) and (3) in Fig. 5b, N2O, which is an oxidant, can react with CH3NH3I to form N2, I2, H2O and CH3NH3Cl. As well, N2O can also react with PbI2 to form N2, I2, H2O and PbCl2. According to the XRD results, we can further infer that N2O can prefer to react with CH3NH3I to PbI2 in the ternary mixture perovskite precursor solution. In fact, a mixture of additives: H2O, HCl, I2, and CH3NH3Cl were indirectly introduced into the perovskite precursor solution by introducing the HONH3Cl additive, and each of the components in the mixture additive have been successfully utilized as individual additives to improve device performance in previous studies.23,26,29,36 Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 5c, the improved quality perovskite films were formed by a combined effect of HONH3Cl and other multiple additives. Moreover, this HONH3Cl-induced perovskite film is merely composed of CH3NH3PbI3, which was demonstrated by the results of elemental analysis and distribution of the perovskite film (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). Apart from this, we cannot observe the characteristic peaks of the CH3NH3PbCl3 from the XRD spectra of the perovskite film shown in Fig. 2a. As reported in the previous literature, this is mainly attributed to the conversion reaction of the CH3NH3PbCl3 to CH3NH3PbI3 and ICl triggered by I2, and the escape of ICl (bp = 97.4 °C) from the perovskite film under the annealing process.26

For further verifying the influence of the HONH3Cl additive on the performance of PHJ-PSCs, the corresponding PHJ-PSCs were constructed via OPSSD using the perovskite precursor solution without (pristine 1:1:0) and with the optimized molar ratio of PbI2:CH3NH3I:HONH3Cl (1:1:0.1). The device configuration is schematically presented in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves. The relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. More obviously, the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced PHJ-PSCs exhibit a promising improved performance for PCE of 11.12% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 18.42 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.63. In contrast, the pristine 1:1:0 based PHJ-PSCs yield a lower PCE of 7.82% with Jsc of 15.61 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.85 V and FF of 0.59. Undoubtedly, the improvements of all parameters for the HONH3Cl-induced device can be attributed to the high quality perovskite film with good morphology and high crystallinity.

In order to indirectly illustrate the enhanced performance of the HONH3Cl-induced PHJ-PSCs, characterization of the above devices using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at a bias voltage of 0 V under 1 Sun illumination, and the results were systematically analyzed. Fig. 7a displays the Nyquist plots fitted according to the EIS measurements. Over the frequency range from 0.1–105 Hz, a semicircle at high frequency range and a transmission line (TL) at low frequency range are clearly observed in the Nyquist plots, which are assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rtr) at the HTM/perovskite interface and the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/perovskite interface, respectively. In addition, the intercept value of the extension of the high frequency semicircle on the real axis (Z′) is the series resistance (Rs), which is contributed to by the wires and FTO substrates and other contacts inside the device.38,39 Obviously, the smaller semicircle and greater slope of TL in the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced device indicate a smaller Rtr at the perovskite/HTM interface and a larger Rrec at the TiO2/perovskite interface. However, the condition of the pristine 1:1:0 based PHJ-PSCs is the opposite. It is apparent that a high quality perovskite film with better morphology, continuous surface coverage and fewer pinholes could reduce the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers caused by the defective trap states and increase the dissociation of charge carriers.24

Inset is the corresponding fitted equivalent electrical circuits. (b) The IPCE curves of the pristine 1:1:0 and 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced PHJ-PSCs. 
As shown in Fig. 7b, the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the above PHJ-PSCs shows a broad and strong spectrum response in the visible light region range, and the onset of the IPCE value at 800 nm is consistent with the UV-vis light absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 shown in Fig. 2b. More obviously, the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced device gives a higher IPCE value range from 400–800 nm with the highest efficiency up to ca. 83% at 563 nm. After integrating the IPCE values, the 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced device exhibits a higher integrated current (Jint) of 18.36 mA cm−2 than the pristine 1:1:0 based device (15.56 mA cm−2), which is basically consistent with the Jsc measured in the I–V characteristics.
The reproducibility of these PHJ-PSCs was also analyzed by constructing a total number of 44 devices of the pristine 1:1:0 based and 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced PHJ-PSCs, respectively. The statistical histogram of PCEs of the above-mentioned PHJ-PSCs is shown in Fig. 8, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The pristine 1:1:0 based devices give an average PCE of 7.21 ± 0.61%, whereas 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced PHJ-PSCs yield a much higher average PCE of 10.61 ± 0.51%, with an average Jsc of 17.89 ± 0.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.96 ± 0.03 V and FF of 0.62 ± 0.01. By comparison, we can easily conclude that 1:1:0.1 HONH3Cl-induced devices exhibit much higher photovoltaic performance and exhibit higher reproducibility than the pristine 1:1:0 based devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed an effective and facile method for improving the performance of PHJ-PSCs via the OPSSD approach by introducing HONH3Cl as an additive. The influence of HONH3Cl on perovskite films and the performance of the corresponding photovoltaic devices were thoroughly investigated. As demonstrated by the XRD and SEM results, a proper amount of HONH3Cl can significantly improve the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film with fewer pinholes and continuous coverage by encouraging homogenous nucleation and directional growth of the nucleus. This, in turn, resulted in enhanced optical absorption and PL intensity of the perovskite film, reduced charge carrier recombination and increased charge dissociation and transportation due to the reduced defective trap states. The HONH3Cl based PHJ-PSCs with a molar ratio of 1:1:0.1 for PbI2:CH3NH3I:HONH3Cl lead to a higher average PCE of 10.61 ± 0.51% than the pristine 1:1:0 based cells. The best performing HONH3Cl-induced device gives a PCE as high as 11.12% with a Jsc of 18.42 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.95 V and FF of 0.63. In conclusion, our findings in this work demonstrate that HONH3Cl is an effective additive for improving the performance of PHJ-PSCs constructed by OPSSD. We also anticipate that greater improvement can be achieved by further optimizing the process with these additives in the future.
