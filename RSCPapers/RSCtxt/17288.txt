    , Accepted 21st January 2019First published on 22nd January 2019AbstractPolyacenes, such as anthracene, tetracene, pentacene etc., have been identified as potential candidates for singlet fission (SF) and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) processes in their crystalline and thin film forms as they possess significant singlet and triplet exciton couplings. Interestingly, phenyl-ethynyl substitution to anthracene at the 9,10 positions (9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene/BPEA) enhances the transverse π-electron conjugation and retains the planar structure even in the excited state. The excited singlet state S1 and the multi-excitonic state 1(TT) in BPEA are separated by ∼30 meV (∼250 cm−1) making it an ideal system for both SF and TTA applications. BPEA is very effective in photon up-conversion even for low input intensities. Transient absorption measurements of BPEA in n-hexane solution are inadequate for distinguishing the S1 state and the multi-excitonic state 1(TT), since the spectroscopic features are complex (mixed) due to the isoenergetic nature and the existence of an equilibrium between these states. However, ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy reveals a systematic red shift and a blue shift in the central frequencies of the Raman modes corresponding to CC and CC vibrational frequencies with time constants of ∼2.0 and ∼20 ps, respectively. Such a shift in the Raman frequencies is direct evidence of the structural changes that take place while changing from excited singlet state S1 to the multi-excitonic state on the potential surface.
Introduction
A photon up-conversion process is a nonlinear process that generally requires high excitation powers. Recent studies by Castellano et al. have demonstrated that efficient photon up-conversion is possible even with continuous wave excitation with a very low excitation power by harnessing the excited energy using the sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) method.1,2 The up-conversion process is a result of the following steps: (i) absorption of the incident photon by a donor, (ii) formation of the triplet population through intersystem crossing in the donor, (iii) energy transfer (ET) from the donor triplet to the acceptor triplet states and (iv) annihilation of the acceptor triplets leading to population of the singlet of the acceptor. The emission results from the excited singlet state of the acceptor moiety. The efficiency of the overall process is primarily governed by the diffusion-assisted ET and TTA processes i.e., steps (iii) and (iv). This property is widely used in photovoltaics, specifically to cover the red-edge region of the solar spectrum. Light harvesting has been very effective when metal–organic or metallated porphyrin sensitizers such as [Ru(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+, palladium(II)meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdPh4TBP) and polyacenes such as 9,10-diphenylanthracene, 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) and 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) are chosen as the donors and TTA-possessing acceptors, respectively.3,4 BPEA is preferred for such applications due to its high chemical stability under ambient conditions when compared to rubrene. Polyacenes are known to exhibit a very high fluorescence quantum yield (∼0.95) and very weak intersystem crossing (ISC) since they possess a large energy gap between the first excited singlet state and the triplet state. However, a few polyacenes such as rubrene and BPEA possess an energy relation of 2ET1∼ES1, where ES1 and ET1 are the energies of the S1 and T1 states with respect to their ground electronic states. Such an energy relation in polyacenes makes them unique and potential candidates for exhibiting signatures of TTA and singlet fission (SF) despite possessing weak ISC.
SF is a spin-allowed process and it can be viewed to be opposite to the TTA process i.e., a photoexcited singlet exciton by colliding with nearby ground state molecules leads to the generation of two triplet excitons, implying the generation of two electron–hole pairs from one photon.5–20 This feature is extensively adapted for solar cell applications as this can overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit (∼32%) and provide improved efficiency (∼46%) by doubling the photo-generated excitons. However, improving the efficiency is a non-trivial problem since this is predominantly governed by the proximity of the molecules (diffusion-assisted) and their relative orientations, the energy criteria of the singlet and the triplet states as mentioned above and the energy difference should be within kBT. The concept of singlet fission has drawn significant attention from various scientific sections in recent times to address various issues related to energy. SF has been demonstrated mostly in polyacene systems in their crystalline, thin film and condensed forms.
Despite many experimental and theoretical reports in the literature addressing various aspects related to several steps that are involved in the SF process in terms of the time evolution of the spectroscopic signatures of the electronic states, a molecular structural perspective in each of the electronic states of relevance is still not clear. Recently, a few studies have been reported to address this aspect.21,22 By employing two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy for crystalline rubrene, Turner and co-workers have demonstrated that the formation of the correlated triplet pair and the spatial separation of the triplets occur at timescales of ∼20 fs and ∼2 ps, respectively.23 Furthermore, they discussed the role of vibronic resonance and vibrational relaxation during the SF process and correlated the timescale for the spatial separation of the triplet states to the nature of molecular stacking. Kukura and co-workers studied ultrafast SF in TIPS-pentacene and demonstrated the evolution of its initially prepared wavepacket in the singlet state into the 1(TT) state indicating the vibronic coupling between the S1 and correlated triplet–triplet 1(TT) states. Such a feature is used to draw parallels between the ultrafast SF (S1 → 1(TT)) process involving two molecules and the ultrafast internal conversion process through a conical intersection in a single molecule.24–27
Frontiera and coworkers have succeeded in capturing the time evolution of the vibrational signatures of excited species in rubrene by employing femtosecond stimulated Raman microscopy.28–31 Analyzing the dynamics of the Raman modes helps in monitoring the evolution of the correlated triplet pairs into two individual triplets. These studies are a clear indication of the direct structural evidence in support of the proposed mechanism of SF wherein the sequence followed is the formation of the correlated triplet states, followed by its separation into two individual triplet states.32 However, it is not well explored by researchers in terms of excited state structural dynamics of a primary event of SF i.e., conversion of S1 to 1(TT). BPEA belongs to the class of polyacenes and is a potential candidate for both TTA and SF.4,33–36 The SF process is considered to occur at a slower rate in the solution phase when compared to the crystalline forms. Herein, we employ ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy (URLS)37–41 to elucidate the early time structural dynamics among the isoenergetic and equilibrated states (S1 → 1(TT)) and to extract mode-specific information in BPEA under resonance excitation. We believe that understanding the excited state structural evolution in BPEA would be beneficial for designing better light harvesting systems.
Methods
9,10-Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) and n-hexane (HX) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. Steady-state absorption of BPEA in n-hexane was performed using a UV-2600 absorption spectrophotometer from Shimadzu Corporation. The Raman measurements were performed by using a Raman microscope from Renishaw for the powdered BPEA sample while exciting it at 633 nm. The molecular structure and the Raman activity of the ground state of BPEA were computed using density functional theory with the Gaussian 09 package. The experimental set up for femtosecond transient absorption (TA) and ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy (URLS) is described in detail in our earlier publications ref. 37 and 39–41. Briefly, a titanium:sapphire amplifier system from Spectra Physics was used to produce fundamental radiation having a central wavelength of 790 nm, a pulse width of 100 fs and a pulse energy of 2 mJ with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. A portion of the fundamental light (1 mJ) was used to pump the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to generate wavelengths in the 500–700 nm range having a pulse width of ∼100 fs and a pulse energy of ∼50 μJ with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Such an output was used to generate the Raman pump with a pulse width of ∼1 ps (∼20 cm−1) by using a home-built grating pair spectral filter. The other portion was further divided into 95:5 to pump TOPAS (from Spectra Physics) for generating wavelengths in the 280–500 nm range and to generate white-light continuum, respectively. TOPAS was tuned to produce light centered at ∼450 nm with a pulse width of ∼100 fs and a pulse energy of ∼4 μJ. Femtosecond TA was performed using pump light centered at ∼450 nm from TOPAS and a white-light continuum as the probe. The pump light was modulated at ∼500 Hz in order to evaluate the excited-state absorption spectra from the pump-on and pump-off white-light spectra. In the case of URLS, the actinic pump was set at ∼450 nm with an energy of ∼3 μJ and the Raman pump was centered at ∼580 nm with a bandwidth of ∼20 cm−1 and a pulse energy of ∼200 nJ. Here, the actinic pump and the Raman pump were modulated at ∼250 Hz and ∼500 Hz to measure the Raman signatures of both the ground state and the excited state. The excited state Raman signatures at various delay time points were processed by removing the ground state Raman signatures. The software to record transient absorption and Raman measurements was obtained by Pascher Instruments. A sample of 300 μM with a stock solution of ∼50 ml was circulated using a 1 mm path length flow-type cuvette from Starna at a sufficiently high flow rate to replenish with fresh sample for every new set of pulse sequences for both TA and URLS measurements.
Results and discussion
A. Steady-state measurements

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of BPEA in HX for different concentrations. It should be noted that the absorbance is enhanced as the concentration of BPEA increases while retaining the spectral profile. This is a clear indication that the ground state structure or potential is perturbed minimally by the variation in concentration. The absorption spectrum possesses peaks centered predominantly at ∼450 and ∼430 nm, and shoulder peaks at ∼400 and ∼380 nm. These features represent a vibronic structure with a spacing of ∼1030 cm−1. The attempt to measure non-resonant Raman signatures of BPEA in HX solution was unsuccessful. However, the steady-state Raman signatures of the powdered BPEA sample at non-resonant excitation are obtained and the spectrum is given in Fig. 1b. The spectral window covers the Raman shift in the range of 900–2300 cm−1. The prominent peaks centered at ∼2100, ∼1550 and ∼1200 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 1b represent the CC and CC and C–H bend frequencies.

B. Time-resolved measurements

Transient absorption (TA) measurements. 

Fig. 2a shows the TA spectra of BPEA in HX at various time delays upon photoexcitation at ∼450 nm. The spectral window that covers TA is in the range of 470–700 nm. It is evident from the figure that TA is majorly governed by a strong peak (P-I) centered at ∼570 nm and a weaker peak (P-II) at ∼640 nm. At early time delays, i.e., < 1 ps, the P-I band exhibits a continuous growth while the P-II band shows growth till 0.2 ps, subsequent to which it exhibits a decrease in its intensity.

Furthermore, the P-I band continued its growth till the time delay of ∼10 ps in addition to the narrowing of the bandwidth. We noticed an isosbestic point centered at ∼590 nm, which is a clear indication of the correlation between the P-I and P-II bands. Fig. 2b shows the evolution of TA of BPEA in HX for time delays from 5 to 1500 ps. Here, one can notice that the intensity of the P-II band sharply decreases to reach the base level while the P-I band exhibits a significant absorbance even at a time delay of ∼1500 ps, which indicates that the P-I band arises from a long living state. The kinetic traces for different probe wavelengths covering both blue (534 and 566 nm) and red-edge regions (594 and 630 nm) in the TA spectra of BPEA in HX are depicted in Fig. 2c. Clearly, the kinetics of the blue region of the spectra is different from the red region. The wavelengths in the blue region exhibit a monotonous increase in their amplitude till 10 ps time delay and decay beyond 1500 ps, whereas in the case of the red-edge region, they exhibit an increase in their amplitude within 0.3 ps and decay significantly within ∼100 ps time delay.
Furthermore, we analyzed the spectral decomposition of the transient absorption spectra to comprehend the excited state dynamics. The global analysis of the TA spectra is best fitted with three time constants having a total of four independent species. The decay-associated spectra as obtained from global analysis are represented in Fig. 3a. It is clear from the figure that at an initial stage, TA exhibits a broad absorption spectrum, and later on, the spectrum is blue-shifted and becomes narrower. Fig. 3b shows the kinetic traces of independent species. The first species [A] is formed within the instrument response function (IRF) and decays with a time constant of ∼1.1 ps. The second species [B] is formed with a time constant of ∼1.1 ps and decays by ∼44.0 ps. Furthermore, species [C] reaches its maximum in the time range of ∼200 ps and decays with a time constant of ∼827.0 ps. Here, we attribute the initial species [A] to an unrelaxed singlet state (1S) and the rest of the species may be related to the relaxed singlet state and the correlated triplet state 1(TT). The TA and transient URLS data are analyzed and discussed in detail below to correlate the extracted time and spectral components with the multi-excitonic nature of excited BPEA in solution. We performed the TA measurements of BPEA in HX at 75, 150 and 300 μM concentrations. We noticed that the single wavelength kinetics at ∼575 nm is sensitive to the concentration. The ultrafast growth component is increased more than twice while changing the concentration from 300 to 75 μM. The concentration-dependent TA parameters are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.†

Transient URLS measurements. 

Fig. 4 represents the transient URL spectra of BPEA at various time delays by exciting it with a photo-pump at ∼450 nm and a Raman pump at ∼581 nm. The transient Raman spectra in the spectral window of 900–2250 cm−1 are majorly dominated by the bands centered at ∼2100, ∼1600, ∼1300 and ∼1000 cm−1.

Kinetics of Raman band amplitudes (b) and band integrals (c) for vibrations corresponding to the CC and CC stretches. Green lines in (b) and (c) represent the fit curves. 
Based on a comparison of the computed spectrum with the ground state Raman spectrum, the excited state Raman bands are attributed to the following vibrational modes: CC stretch (∼2100 cm−1), CC stretch (∼1600 cm−1), phenyl ring breathing in core anthracene + in-plane C–H bending (∼1300 cm−1) and in-plane C–H bending (∼1000 cm−1). It is clear from Fig. 4a that the ∼1600 cm−1 mode exhibits positive features as compared to the negative features for the other modes. We can also notice that the Raman modes at ∼1600 and ∼2100 cm−1 exhibit subtle dispersive features in their lineshapes. The effect of change in the lineshape of the Raman modes on resonance excitation is essentially indicative of the relevance of the vibrational modes to the concerned absorption spectrum. We refer the readers to ref. 39–43 for more details about the effect of mode-dependent lineshape changes on resonance excitation. Fig. 4b and c represent the kinetics of the peak amplitudes and the peak area of Raman modes corresponding to the CC and CC vibrational frequencies. Both the Raman peak amplitudes and the band integrals are found to follow similar kinetics. They initially exhibit a growth with time constants of ∼2.0 and ∼22 ps, followed by decay with a time constant of >2.0 ns. The cumulative effect of the band integrals of the full spectrum can be correlated to the population of the species. The fit parameters for the band integrals and the band amplitudes are given in Table 1.

The temporal evolution of the central position of the Raman modes corresponding to the CC and CC vibrations is presented in Fig. 5. The kinetics of these modes are best fitted with bi-exponential functions having rise as well as decay components. It is noticed that the CC stretch exhibits a red shift of ∼3.0 cm−1 and subsequently a blue shift of ∼4.0 cm−1 with time constants of ∼2.8 and ∼22 ps, respectively, whereas the CC stretch exhibits a red shift in its frequency only by ∼1 cm−1 and a blue shift by ∼3 cm−1 with time constants of ∼6 and ∼17 ps, respectively.

Fig. 6 represents the transient URL spectra of BPEA in HX solution at different time delays by exciting with the Raman pump centered at ∼596 nm. It is evident from the figure that the Raman modes appear at the same position as in the case of excitation at ∼581 nm. However, they are distinct in terms of exhibiting dispersive lineshapes having positive and negative lobes within the band profile. We can also notice that the bands corresponding to the CC and CC frequencies exhibit dispersive lineshapes, while they possess relatively opposite sign of the dispersion. Here, we emphasize that the dispersive lineshape for these bands originates at zero time delay and retains the shape even for a longer time period albeit with a decrease in their intensity. These features clearly indicate the relevance of these modes with regard to the excited state absorption band.

The above experimental results for BPEA are discussed below in correspondence with those obtained for anthracene, a core entity of BPEA. Anthracene possesses two transition dipole moments along the long axis (y-axis) and the short axis (z-axis). An addition of the phenyl-ethynyl groups at the 9,10 position of core anthracene (BPEA) results in a strong effect on the electronic and optical properties when compared to those of the anthracene molecule. The enhanced transverse π-electron conjugation due to the retention of the planar structure in the excited states leads to a downshift of the energies of the S1 and T1 states. The transition dipole moment along the z-axis in BPEA is more than twice that of the core anthracene molecule. This feature essentially determines the strengths of the singlet and triplet exciton couplings, especially in molecular crystals. Triplet exciton couplings, though smaller in comparison with singlet exciton couplings, are determined by the significant overlap of the inter-molecular wavefunction as guided by the relative orientations and distances between the two molecules i.e., the crystallographic directions in molecular crystals. Furthermore, the singlet exciton coupling strength in BPEA is of the order of ∼250 cm−1 for most of the possible dimer orientations, whereas the triplet exciton coupling strength is of the order of ∼100 cm−1 for a particular dimer. These features indicate that BPEA is a potential system for SF and TTA applications. Recent demonstration of the TTA property by BPEA in photon up-conversion even at low light powers and the theoretical analysis of the energy difference (ES1–E2T1) between the lowest excited singlet state (S1) and the triplet state (T1) to be of the order of ∼30 meV (∼250 cm−1) clearly indicate the existence of a multiexcitonic state which is also in equilibrium with the S1 state.3,4,33–36,44,45 In fact, the energy difference is likely to be affected by the rotation of the terminal phenyl groups, thereby influencing the photon-upconversion efficiency as demonstrated recently by Gray et al.45 The multiexcitonic state is typically formed instantaneously from an initially excited singlet state and subsequently transforms into two triplet states in the case of thin-films or crystalline forms. However, the evolution of such states is less explored in the solution phase as SF is believed to be less significant and not very feasible for practical applications. Recent transient absorption measurements of TIPS-pentacene and TIPS-tetracene in solution revealed the spectroscopic identification of the initially prepared S1 state, correlated triplet state (1TT or excimer state) and the triplet state. It is also demonstrated that the rate of formation of the individual triplets follows second order kinetics and approaches the diffusion limit.11,46 This clearly indicates the feasibility of exploring the evolution of SF in a solution phase in detail which is otherwise considered to be instantaneous in thin films or crystalline forms. It is noticed that the overall behavior of BPEA in HX is not much deviated from its crystalline or thin film forms. Here, we emphasize the structural evolution during the early time events of SF in BPEA in HX using the URLS method, which complements the TA measurements.
The single wavelength kinetics at ∼640 nm as shown in Fig. 2 rises to its maximum value within the IRF (∼200 fs) and decays significantly with a time constant of ∼11 ps. It clearly indicates that this is originated from the initially populated state (S1), whereas kinetics at 575 nm and 460 nm (stimulated emission) show rise times of ∼1.0 and ∼0.7 ps, respectively. These bands therefore should be obtained from a state other than the S1 state. Furthermore, the band at 575 nm reaches its maximum intensity with a timescale of ∼10 ps and the band at ∼640 nm decays significantly on a similar timescale. Such a feature is a direct indication of the correlation between these two states. The TA spectrum at a short time delay of ∼0.1 ps appears very broad and exhibits comparable intensities for both the bands at 640 and 575 nm, albeit later shows a growth for further time delays. This feature indicates that the new state that is formed from the initially excited S1 state has a mixed character. We attribute such state to the correlated triplet state or multi-excitonic state (1TT). The P-I band becomes narrow for time delays beyond ∼100 ps, signifying a triplet–triplet transition having a minimal contribution from the absorption by the S1 state. This finding is in good agreement with allowed triplet–triplet transitions that occur in the spectral region of ∼600 nm in the single molecule of BPEA, as suggested in recent theoretical calculations.27
The Raman modes corresponding to the CC and CC bonds are chosen for the analysis due to their prominent nature in the excited state dynamics and relatively higher intensities in the spectra. These modes exhibit a growth with time constants of ∼2.0 and ∼22 ps and a decay with a time constant of >2.0 ns. These time constants do not match with the time constants as obtained both from the global analysis of TA and from single wavelength kinetics. The mismatch between the two methods could arise due to the difference in the origin of the TA and URLS techniques. TA is based on differential absorption of the probe light during the electronic transitions by the transient species; the amplitude of absorbance is a direct consequence of the concentration or population of the transient species. Kinetics of such absorbance is a demonstration of evolution of the transient population, whereas URLS is based on the Raman scattering process at the vibrational energy levels, whose amplitudes are majorly governed by the variation in the factors such as polarizability, molecular environment and electronic distribution along with the concentration of the transient species. The difference in the peak intensities of the Raman modes for a given transient species clearly indicates that the concentration of the transient species is not the sole criterion that decides the amplitudes of the Raman modes. Hence, the kinetics of the amplitude of a particular Raman mode is inadequate in representing the evolution of the population of the transient species. However, the cumulative sum of the area under the Raman peaks for the full spectrum at each time delay can be related to the population of the excited species. Furthermore, the central frequency of the CC Raman mode exhibits an initial red shift of ∼3 cm−1 and a subsequent blue shift of ∼4 cm−1 with time constants of ∼2.0 ps and ∼22 ps, respectively. Similarly, the CC Raman mode also shows an initial red shift and a subsequent blue shift. These features are in parallel with the recently reported results by our group for the thioxanthone (TX) system in methanol. TX possesses two isoenergetic and equilibrated excited S1 and T2 states. The ultrafast transient absorption measurements were inadequate in analyzing the initial evolution of the photoexcited state of thioxanthone. However, URLS enabled such entangled states to be distinguished by providing a systematic red shift and a subsequent blue shift in the Raman mode corresponding to the CO frequency, which was considered to have a significant change in the electron density when changing from the singlet to triplet potential surface. From these observations, we can correlate that in BPEA there exists an electronic state, which is in equilibrium with the initially prepared S1 state. However, such an electronic state cannot be either T1 or T2 as they possess a large difference in their energies with respect to the S1 state. Based on both TA and URLS measurements, we conclude such a state to be a multi-excitonic state. The red shift in the frequency could arise due to the elongation of the CC and CC bonds as a consequence of the delocalization of electrons between the two BPEA molecules in a multi-excitonic state. The blue shift can be related to the vibrational relaxation within the multi-excitonic potential surface. The electron density, bond lengths and vibrational frequencies get perturbed when BPEA is at a different potential energy surface, as supported by the theoretical calculations using the Gaussian 09 package.47 The bond lengths and the vibrational frequencies are provided in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

A decrease in bond lengths of the C1–C6, C13–C14, C3–C4 and C10–C11 bonds in both the S1 and T1 states when compared to the S0 state is noticed. However, the bond lengths for the C8–C9, C7–C10, C4–C8 and C3–C7 bonds get shortened. The relative change in the bond lengths is more prominent in the case of T1 than that in the case of S1. This signifies the structural dynamics in BPEA when it changes from the initial excited singlet state to the triplet state.
The change in the vibrational frequencies while changing from the initial state to the multi-excitonic state is related to the strength of the excitonic couplings.48 In the case of molecular crystals of BPEA, we can expect a large shift in the vibrational frequencies while changing from an initial excited state to a multi-excitonic state. However, tracking the initial evolution in such systems is a non-trivial task as the process occurs at much faster timescales in comparison with the solution phase. The structural dynamics of photoexcited BPEA in HX through various states is summarized in Scheme 1. The URLS measurements essentially complement the TA measurements in understanding the structural changes that take place while moving from various electronic states, particularly entangled or isoenergetic electronic states where TA measurements are inadequate in distinguishing the corresponding spectral signatures. This study clearly indicates that early time events of the SF process can be explored in detail which helps in identifying and characterizing the singlet and correlated triplet states with much more reliability. We believe that, in future, advanced ultrafast Raman techniques such as impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy/microscopy using ∼10 fs would be very effective in determining the structural evolution during early time events of SF in crystalline or thin films which helps in modifying and designing effective materials for solar cells and other applications.22,49,50

Conclusions
To summarize, the excited state dynamics of BPEA in HX solution upon photoexcitation at ∼450 nm was studied using fs-TA and transient URLS methods. TA measurements revealed that, at an initial time delay (∼0.2 ps), the spectrum was very broad with bands centered at ∼570 and ∼640 nm. It is noticed that the ∼640 nm band rises instantaneously but decays significantly at the timescale of ∼10 ps, whereas, the ∼570 nm band reaches its maximum by ∼10 ps and decays at >2.0 ns. The TA spectrum is predominantly governed by the ∼570 nm band for time delays above 10 ps. The bands at ∼640 and ∼570 nm are related to the excited singlet state (S1) and triplet state (T1) absorptions, respectively. However, these bands co-existed for all the delay times, clearly indicating the mixed character of the excited state i.e., the correlated triplet state 1(TT). Transient URLS measurements were carried out by exciting with a Raman pump at ∼580 nm. The kinetics of the intensity of the Raman modes corresponding to the CC and CC vibrations revealed a growth in their amplitudes till ∼100 ps. Interestingly, kinetics of the central frequency of these modes exhibited an initial red shift and a subsequent blue shift with time constants of ∼2 and ∼20 ps, respectively. The systematic red shift and blue shift with time is direct evidence of the structural changes during the evolution of excited BPEA from an initially excited singlet state S1 to an isoenergetic multi-excitonic state 1(TT), which was otherwise non-trivial as observed from the TA measurements.
