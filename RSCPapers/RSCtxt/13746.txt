    , Accepted 6th March 2021First published on 8th March 2021AbstractProducing hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is a feasible and efficient route for resolving the problems associated with energy and the environment, and great efforts have been devoted to improving solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Here, we study an arsenene/g-C3N4 van der Waals heterostructure as a possible photocatalyst for water splitting. Using first principles calculations, we find that the heterostructure is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a type-II band alignment and low exciton binding energy, facilitating the effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Comparing the band edge positions with the redox potentials of water demonstrates that the heterostructure is a potential photocatalyst for water splitting in a neutral environment. Meanwhile, the heterostructure shows significantly enhanced optical absorption beyond the constituent monolayers in both visible and ultraviolet regions. Its STH efficiency limit can reach up to 15.8%, which is quite promising for commercial applications. Thermodynamic analyses for redox reactions suggest facile hydrogen generation on the heterostructure. These extraordinary properties enable the arsenene/g-C3N4 heterostructure to be a promising water-splitting photocatalyst.
1 Introduction
Photocatalytic overall water splitting, which involves the simultaneous reduction and oxidation of water, producing hydrogen and oxygen gases, has been considered as a promising technology for providing a clean, environmentally friendly, low cost, and renewable energy source. Since the breakthrough report of Fujishima and Honda on water splitting on a TiO2 electrode,1 many semiconductor materials were found to function as photocatalysts for hydrogen production.2 Unfortunately, these materials have excessively wide band gaps, fast electron–hole recombination and poor activation of catalysts.3 Hence, they are less efficient for photocatalytic applications. Nevertheless, this can be overcome to some extent by adjusting their dimensions and shapes to be nanoscale materials. Among them, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extremely promising in the field of photocatalysis due to their enhanced photocatalytic properties.3–5 These 2D photocatalysts exhibit a high specific surface area available for photocatalytic reactions and promote the adsorption of reactants. Besides, they help in minimizing the distance that photogenerated electrons and holes have to migrate before reaching the solid/water interface, reducing the possibility of electron–hole recombination, thereby potentially enhancing the photocatalytic performance.
Recently, various 2D materials such as monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),6,7 single-layer group-III (IV) monochalcogenides8,9 and others3–5 have been designed and predicted to be promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Among these photocatalysts, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as a distinctive kind of 2D material, has attracted much attention due to its fascinating merits, such as an appropriate electronic band structure, low cost, good chemical stability, a large number of vacancies and enough adsorption sites.10–15 g-C3N4 is a conjugated polymeric system, which is constructed from s-triazine or tri-s-triazine (heptazine) units interconnected via tertiary amines.10 Heptazine has been established to be more stable under ambient conditions.16 Recently, many strategies, such as thermal exfoliation, liquid ultrasonic exfoliation, template-assisted synthesis and so on have been used to obtain g-C3N4 nanosheets.12–14,17,18 Typically, the thermal exfoliation method offers advantages such as low cost, absence of solvents, time-efficiency and high yield.19 However, this method results in a material with low crystallinity and a relatively low surface area, which is detrimental to the performance in photocatalytic water splitting. Liquid ultrasonic exfoliation has inherent advantages: nanosheets with a high surface area and relatively high crystallinity can be formed, which are critical properties in photocatalytic water splitting.19 Recently, heptazine-based g-C3N4 nanosheets with high crystallinity have been successfully synthesized by a probe sonication assisted liquid exfoliation method.13,18 And these nanosheets show significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity under visible light compared to the bulky ones. Later, 2D heptazine-based crystalline g-C3N4 will be selected to design efficient photocatalysts.
Moreover, monolayer gray arsenic (arsenene), as a new elemental 2D semiconducting material with a buckled honeycomb lattice, has been investigated theoretically and synthesised experimentally.20–22 Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have shown that monolayer arsenene (As) has a tunable band gap, high carrier mobility and good visible/UV light absorption capacity.20,21,23,24 These excellent electronic and optical properties enable monolayer As to achieve highly efficient photocatalysis25,26 despite its known toxicity.
Therefore, both g-C3N4 and As monolayers have great potential for photocatalytic water splitting. However, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in monolayer g-C3N4 or As remain in the same spatial regions and recombine easily, which can reduce the solar energy conversion and thus limit their application in photocatalytic water splitting. A possible solution is to construct a type-II van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) by putting a monolayer on top of another monolayer,27–32 where photogenerated electrons and holes are confined separately in different building blocks, thus reducing the recombination rate. Various such type-II heterostructures like As/Ca(OH)2,28 As/GaS,27 As/GaX (X = S, Se),33 In2SeS/g-C3N4 (ref. 34) and g-C3N4/MoS2 (ref. 35) have been reported to exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation from water. This motivates us to consider whether monolayer As and g-C3N4 can form a stable As/g-C3N4 vdWH and what interesting electronic or optical properties it can provide.
In this work, we focus on the exploration of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting to generate hydrogen. We first determine the relative stabilities of the heterostructures with different stacking configurations. Then, we study the electronic and optical properties of the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure, and find that it is a typical type II semiconductor with strong visible-UV light absorption. Importantly, it has a favorable band position for water splitting in a neutral environment. Finally, the high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency and excellent catalytic performance of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH have been predicted, further proving that it is a promising candidate for photocatalytic water splitting.
2 Computational methods
In this work, we perform a comprehensive first-principles investigation using the projected augmented wave (PAW) method36 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).37 For structural relaxations, the PBE generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is employed.36,38 The computationally more expensive hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional method39,40 is used to obtain the electronic band structures to compensate for the underestimated band gaps obtained by DFT/PBE calculations. The effect of weak vdW interaction between the two monolayers is studied with the DFT-D2 method,41 which has proven to be reliable for describing various vdW heterostructures.27,29,42–44 Dipole correction is applied to compensate for the diploe interaction. A vacuum space in the z-direction more than 25 Å is used to avoid the neighboring slab interactions. A plane wave energy cutoff of 500 eV, an energy convergence criterion of 10−5 eV, a force convergence of 0.01 eV Å−1, a k-mesh of 21 × 21 × 1 (11 × 11 × 1) for the PBE (HSE06) calculations are sufficient for structural optimization and electronic property calculations.
3 Results and discussion
Before exploring the As/g-C3N4 vdWH, we first investigate the geometric structures of isolated As and g-C3N4 monolayers, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c) and Table 1. The lattice constants of single-layer As and g-C3N4 are 3.61 and 7.14 Å respectively. The bond lengths of As–As, C–N1 and C–N2 are 2.51, 1.48 and 1.33 Å. Furthermore, their band structures are also investigated by HSE06 calculations and presented in Fig. 1(b) and (d), respectively. Apparently, the two monolayers are both indirect-band gap semiconductors, and the band gaps are 2.21 and 2.77 eV for arsenene and GaS monolayers, respectively. The calculated structural and electronic properties of all these monolayers are in agreement with those in previous studies,10,11,20,45 which confirm the reliability of our method.

The As/g-C3N4 vdWH is constructed from a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of the As monolayer and a unit cell of the g-C3N4 nanosheet stacked in the vertical direction with a lattice mismatch of about 1.10%. This small lattice mismatch is favorable to form heterostructures in terms of the vdW interactions, i.e. vdWHs46 and indicates a high possibility for the successful synthesis of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH for industrial applications. In view of possible lattice orientation, three vertical stacking configurations for the As/g-C3N4 heterostructures are constructed, as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c), namely α-, β- and γ-stacking. In the α-stacking, the hexagonal As rings are right over the C9N9 rings in the g-C3N4 layer. As for the β- and γ-stacking, they can be obtained by further moving and/or rotating the As layer with respect to the g-C3N4 layer in the α-stacking. To assess the stabilities of the heterostructures, we calculate their interface binding energies for different stacking configurations by using the following equation Eb = (EAs/g-C3N4 − EAs − Eg-C3N4)/A(1)where EAs/g-C3N4, EAs, and Eg-C3N4 represent the total energies of the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure, arsenene and g-C3N4 monolayer, respectively, and A is the surface area of the 2D supercell. By this definition, a lower Eb value means better stability of the heterostructure. As listed in Table 1, the formations of all interfaces are exothermic (negative Eb) and their Eb values are very close to each other, which means that the three considered heterostructures possess very similar stability, although the α-stacking one is the most stable one. In fact, the three structures also have very similar electronic structures (see Fig. 3(a)). A similar behavior is also found in arsenene/Ca(OH)2 and arsenene/MoS2 heterostructures.28,44 Thus, in the following sections, we take the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure with a-stacking configuration as a representative to show our results.

All the results are from the HSE06 calculations. 
We next focus on the electronic properties of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH. The projected band structure given by the HSE06 calculation is illustrated in Fig. 3(b), in which the circles filled with green and cyan indicate the contributions from the arsenene and g-C3N4 layers, respectively. Obviously, the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.89 eV, with the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the Γ point and K point, respectively. Its band gap is larger than the required 1.23 eV minimum band gap for photocatalysis reactions, showing the potential application of the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure as a visible light photocatalyst. The CBM mainly stems from the g-C3N4 sublayer, while the VBM is primarily due to the As monolayer, implying that the heterostructure has a type-II band alignment with staggered gaps, which will spontaneously separate the free electrons and holes, enabling high efficiency solar energy conversion.47 Further support can be obtained from the decomposed charge densities of the VBM and CBM, as shown in the insets of Fig. 3(b), in which the CBM is from C and N atoms while the VBM is from the As atom. Meanwhile, the total density of states (TDOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) for the As/g-C3N4 vdWH are calculated. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the CBM is mainly contributed by the p states of As atoms, while the VBM is dominated by the p states of C and N atoms, which further demonstrate the type-II nature of the heterostructure.
To give a more detailed understanding of the electronic properties of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH, the charge transfer is considered by analyzing the planar average charge density difference (CDD) (Δρ(z)) along the z direction normal to the surface. Δρ(z) is calculated by using the following formula:30 Δρ(z) = ρH(z) − ρA(z) − ρg(z)(2)where ρH(z), ρA(z) and ρg(z) are the plane-averaged charge densities of the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure, pristine As and g-C3N4 monolayers, respectively. Therefore, positive values indicate charge accumulation while negative values mean charge depletion. In Fig. 4(a), we can see that the g-C3N4 layer donates electrons to the As layer, which means that an intrinsic built-in electric field (Ein) is induced with its direction pointing from the g-C3N4 layer to the As layer. The number of transferred electrons up to the z point is given by the formula (3)The results in Fig. 4(a) (right y-axis) show that about 0.0012 |e| per unit cell is transferred from the g-C3N4 to the As layer, which is determined by the value of ΔQ(z) at the g-C3N4/As interface.48 To further study the interfacial electronic properties, we also investigate the interface dipole moment μ(z) as follows49 (4)
 Fig. 4  (a) Plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ (black line), the amount of transferred charge ΔQ (magenta line) and (b) interfacial dipole moment μ (blue line) along the normal direction of the surface for the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure. 
A μ(z) of 0.003 D is found (see Fig. 4(b)), confirming the formation of a heterostructure-induced interface dipole. A positive value of μ(z) suggests an inward pointing dipole,49 that is, from the As layer (with electrons) to the g-C3N4 layer (with holes). Such a feature would improve the separation between electrons and holes and induces an electrostatic potential difference.50
The profiles of the planar-averaged electrostatic potentials with a dipole correction applied along the z axis of the g-C3N4 and As monolayers and As/g-C3N4 vdWH are obtained. Their work functions (Φ) are given by aligning the Fermi level with reference to the vacuum energy level. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the Φ values of g-C3N4 and As monolayers are 4.76 eV and 5.24 eV, respectively, which means that the g-C3N4 layer more easily loses electrons than the As layer. This is consistent with the result of CDD analysis. Especially, we note that there is a large vacuum level difference (∼0.50 eV) on the two respective surfaces of the g-C3N4/As heterostructure. We know that the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O are determined by the electrochemical potentials relative to the vacuum level, and thus, the vacuum level difference on the two respective surfaces can result in the shifts of the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O between the two surfaces (see later discussion).50–52 Compared with the work functions of g-C3N4 and As monolayers, those of the heterostructure (see Fig. 5(c)) are decreased because of the efficient interfacial formation and charge transfer. The low work function means the electron transition would get easier between VBM and CBM edges under light irradiation.53 Besides, we find that there is a large potential drop (ΔV) at the interface of the heterostructure, which can lower the photoexcited electron–hole recombination rate and thus enhance the power conversion efficiency.

(d) Band edge positions of the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure, referring to the vacuum level. The redox potentials of water splitting at pH 0 (green dashed line) and pH 7 (red dashed line) are shown for comparison. 
As mentioned above, the As/g-C3N4 vdWH has suitable bandgaps as a visible light photocatalyst. Here, the photocatalytic activities of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH are evaluated by comparing its band edge positions to the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. According to the mechanism proposed by Yang et al.,50–52 we align the band edges of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH relative to the vacuum levels. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the CBM (−3.32 eV) of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH is higher than the reduction potential (−4.44 eV) of H+/H2 at pH = 0, and the VBM (−5.72 eV) is only slightly lower than the oxidation potential (−5.67 eV), implying lower oxidizing power.54 Nevertheless, as we know, the water redox potentials are closely related to the aqueous solution pH and increase with pH by pH × 0.059 eV, shifting the water's redox energy levels upward.3,8 As a result, it can be found that the band edges of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH locate at energetically favorable positions for water splitting at pH = 7. Importantly, the energy difference between the VBM (CBM) and the oxidation (reduction) potential level of water is 0.46 (0.71) eV, which is adequate for O2(H2) production from water.54 Therefore, in terms of potential, the As/g-C3N4 vdWH might be an overall water-splitting photocatalyst candidate in a neutral environment.
Moreover, when the heterostructure is illuminated with light, both the g-C3N4 and As sublayers, the valence electrons with high energy obtained from the sunlight can leap into the conduction band. And then these photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of the As layer can be easily shifted to that of the g-C3N4 layer owing to the observed conduction band offset. Conversely, the valence band offset can drive photoinduced holes in the valence band of the g-C3N4 layer to migrate to the valence band of the As layer. As a result, the photogenerated carries can be effectively separated on different surfaces, which can reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs and thus is beneficial for photocatalysis. Specifically, the Ein mentioned above acts in the opposite (same) direction to the transfer of photogenerated electrons (holes) and thus inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. To further qualitatively evaluate the efficiency of photogenerated-carrier separation, the exciton binding energies (Eeb) are calculated by using the Mott–Wannier model:55 Eeb = 13.6μex/(m0ε2)(5)where μex, m0 and ε are the effective exciton mass, electron mass and static dielectric constant, respectively. Thereinto, μex is given by μex = memh/(me + mh). The Eeb values for the As and g-C3N4 monolayers are found to be 3.01 and 12.98 eV respectively. The As/g-C3N4 vdWH presents a much lower Eeb value of 0.44 eV, which will facilitate the separation of the carriers.
Then, we turn our attention to the light absorption properties and solar energy conversion efficiency of the As/g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The absorption spectra of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH and its components are recorded at the HSE06 level and displayed in Fig. 6. The computational details have been fully described in our previous studies.29,30 It is seen that the As sheet exhibits expanded optical adsorption from UV into visible light. However, the g-C3N4 monolayer only displays weak ultraviolet absorption. Fascinatingly, the As/g-C3N4 vdWH exhibits stronger visible-UV light absorption compared with its components. This arises from the fact that new optical transitions can be induced by the interlayer coupling and charge transfer in the heterostructures.56–58 Consequently, the outstanding light absorption ability of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH favors obtaining high STH efficiency.
 Fig. 6  (Color online) The calculated optical absorption spectra A(ω) of As and g-C3N4 monolayers and the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure using the hybrid HSE06 functional. The solar spectrum is also shown for comparison. 
The corrected STH efficiency (ηSTH) of photocatalytic water splitting for a 2D material with a vertical intrinsic electric field can be evaluated approximately by using the following expression:54 (6)where ΔG = 1.23 eV is the potential difference for water splitting, P(hω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy of hω, E is the energy of photons that can actually be used for water splitting, Eg is the band gap of the heterostructure,59,60 and ΔΦ is the vacuum level difference on the two respective surfaces of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH. In this work, E is determined by using E = Eg + 0.6 − χ(O2), where χ(O2) is the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).54,59,60 Accordingly, the ηSTH of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH is roughly estimated to be 15.8%, which exceeds the critical value (∼10%) that makes the photocatalyst economically viable.54
Finally, we will explore the thermodynamic feasibility of the As/g-C3N4 vdWH for photocatalytic water splitting. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the intermediate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER processes can be calculated by using the following equation:34,61 ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE + TΔS − ΔGU − ΔGpH(7)where ΔE represents the change in total energy. ΔZPE and ΔS represent the difference of the zero-point energy and the difference of entropy between the ground state and the adsorbed system, respectively. T is the temperature and here is taken as 298.15 K. Then, ΔGU and ΔGpH represent the effect of the electrochemical potential and pH value on ΔG, respectively. They can be calculated by using ΔGU = −eU and ΔGpH = −kBTln10 × pH, respectively, where e represents the electron charge, U represents the potential difference from the standard hydrogen electrode potential and kB is Boltzmann's constant. In our work, pH = 7 is considered.
Because the CBM and VBM of the heterostructure are localized on g-C3N4 and As monolayers, respectively, the active sites for the HER and OER are namely located at g-C3N4 and As surfaces. The potential difference Ue (Uh) of photogenerated electrons (holes) for the HER (OER) is defined as the energy difference between the hydrogen reduction potential and the CBM (VBM) level. As shown in Fig. 5(d), Ue and Uh for the As/g-C3N4 vdWH are 0.71 eV and 1.69 eV at pH = 7, respectively. U = 0 denotes the situation of the absence of light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the ΔGH for the HER at U = 0 and pH = 7 can reach as low as −0.02 eV, which is lower than the potential difference Ue of photogenerated electrons. Therefore, the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure will facilitate the HER quite readily at an appropriate H coverage. The OER process a four-step process with the intermediates of OH*, O* and OOH*, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(b), when U = 0 and pH = 7, ΔG increases every step to 4.51 eV eventually. The third step of forming OOH* is the rate-limiting step with a Gibbs free energy change of 2.72 eV. That is to say, the smallest extra potential of 2.72 eV is needed to guarantee that O2 can be produced spontaneously without light irradiation from neutral water. Under light irradiation (U = 1.69 V), ΔG declines in the first, second and fourth reactions, while it increases in the third reaction. And the free energy change of forming OOH* is reduced to 1.03 eV, which is still high and will be detrimental to the OER.54 Consequently, introducing cocatalysts may become necessary, which has been demonstrated to be an efficient route for addressing the activation energy issue.62

(b) Free energy profile for the OER on the As layer in the heterostructure at pH = 7 and at different potential differences. U = 0 and U = 1.69 V represent the potential without and with light irradiation, respectively. U = 2.72 V means the smallest value of all the downhill limits. 
4 Conclusions
In summary, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the stability, electronic structures, and optical and potential photocatalytic properties of bilayer vdW heterostructures consisting of As and g-C3N4 monolayers. Because of little lattice mismatch as well as the negative binding energy, the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure should not be difficult to synthesize experimentally. The calculated results show that the pristine As/g-C3N4 heterostructure is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a type-II band alignment and low exciton binding energy. The calculated plane-averaged charge density differences imply that an intrinsic built-in electric field is induced with its direction pointing from the g-C3N4 layer to the As layer. These properties facilitate the effective separation of photogenerated carriers and solar energy conversion. Interestingly, its band edges locate at energetically favorable positions for water splitting at pH = 7, so overall photocatalytic water slitting can be achieved in the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Meanwhile, the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure is predicted to have outstanding light absorption ability and high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Free energy calculations for redox reactions also demonstrate high catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Briefly, the As/g-C3N4 heterostructure is expected to be a good candidate for photocatalytic water splitting in a neutral environment.
