The edges of molybdenum sulfide are able to mediate proton adsorption and dihydrogen formation at relatively low overpotentials in acidic media. From a practical perspective, an optimal electrocatalyst must combine electrode level efficiency (reflected by high current densities and low Tafel slopes and overpotentials) with high intrinsic catalytic activity (measured by turnover frequency). Herein, we map both sets of parameters for molybdenum sulfide catalysts as a function of the annealing temperature across their amorphous to crystalline phase transition. Studies of local structure indicate that with increasing annealing temperature, molecular precursors are initially cross-linked to form [Mo3S13]2− clusters characterized by both apical/bridging S22− and unsaturated/terminal S22− moieties, which in turn are consumed to nucleate ultra-thin crystalline MoS2 domains. With increase of the annealing temperature, these nuclei coalesce to form larger nanosheets. Annealing and the resulting amorphous to crystalline transition involves a trade-off between the number of available sites (which is decreased with increasing crystallite size) and the intrinsic activity of the sites (which is improved with increasing crystallinity). Optimal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is observed for the molybdenum sulfide sample prepared by annealing at 300 °C, which comprises ultra-thin MoS2 nuclei embedded within a matrix of [Mo3S13]2− clusters. This sample is characterized by an overpotential value η10 of 176 mV, a Tafel slope of 49.2 mV dec−1, a turnover frequency of 1.15H2 per s per active site at −0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and furthermore exhibits reasonable stability upon prolonged electrochemical cycling. The amorphous samples are found to be more susceptible to oxidation, which degrades the stability of the catalysts. The mapping of electrode-level parameters and intrinsic activity as a function of crystallite size provides vital design principles for constructing a viable electrocatalyst.
Introduction
Solar energy represents the most attractive and fundamentally viable solution to global energy needs, and yet as a result of challenges related to materials development, solar energy conversion remains amongst the defining challenges of modern science.1–4 Solar cells and solar fuel production have been somewhat independently developed as a means of capturing solar energy. These two areas of active research have followed somewhat divergent trajectories underpinned, nevertheless, by some commonalities arising from the need to match interfacial energetic offsets and optimize kinetics of charge transfer within semiconductor heterostructures.5–8 Hydrogen has emerged as arguably the most extensively explored solar fuel owing primarily to the high energy density that can be stored in a H–H bond. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER): 2H+ (aq.) + 2e− → H2 (g)(1)occupies a central place in photocatalytic water splitting. One possible means of solar fuel production involves a photoelectrochemical cell that couples photocatalytic water oxidation with electrocatalytic HER.2,9,10
The Pt-group metals evolve hydrogen with close to null overpotentials in acidic media but are plagued by concerns regarding cost and materials criticality, which have inspired a strong effort to develop earth-abundant alternatives.11–15 Various transition metal phosphides,16,17 chalcogenides,18,19 and carbides20–22 have been shown to exhibit promising electrocatalytic properties. In particular, layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively explored as an alternative to Pt and is thought to possess catalytically active edge sites with a distinctive electronic structure that is markedly different from the electronic structure of the basal planes of MoS2.11,13 However, in contrast to Pt, the adsorption of hydrogen on MoS2 is enthalpically uphill by ca. +0.08 eV and some estimates suggest that the adsorption of hydrogen is limited to one in four atoms at the MoS2 edges.11–13 Furthermore, the thermodynamically stable 2-H polymorph of MoS2 is a semiconductor with a bandgap of ca. 1.29 eV and its basal planes do not provide facile pathways for electron transport.23 Consequently, the measured overpotentials and turnover frequencies observed for MoS2 electrocatalysts are not thus far competitive with nanostructured Pt. Several strategies for modulating the catalytic activity of MoS2 have been explored including defect engineering, cation intercalation, incorporation of substitutional dopants, and interfacing with other semiconductors or nanostructured additives.15,24–29 Considerable effort has been invested in exposing a high density of edge sites both for 2H MoS2 as well as for a metastable 1-T phase that can be stabilized upon exfoliation.24,30–32 However, a clear dependence of the catalytic activity and stability on size and crystallinity remains to be rigorously mapped for this system.
A fundamental question that remains to be answered is how the catalytic activity of MoS2, widely thought to derive from sulfur dimers stabilized at the edges, evolves as a function of domain size. In other words, to what extent is the catalytic activity correlated to the specifics of local structure and to what extent is it influenced by the emergent atomistic and electronic structure of an extended solid in the form of a nanoparticle.33 For instance, a molecular edge-site analog of MoS2 has been demonstrated to show reasonable catalytic activity.33 Several recent reports further point to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx).26,34–39 Molecular and amorphous compounds have a key advantage of allowing for low-cost solution-phase processing that is compatible with scalable nanomanufacturing approaches. Several competing mechanistic ideas have been advanced to explain the catalytic activity of amorphous MoS2. For instance, Merki and Hu have suggested that the activity of amorphous MoS2 is derived from coordinatively unsaturated sulfur atoms, and that the amorphous structure contains incomplete cubane-type [Mo3S4]4+ units.34 Furthermore, based on a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies, these authors have suggested that the amorphous phase has apical and/or bridging S22− ligands as well as unsaturated and/or terminal S22− sites.35,36 Recently, Tran et al. have advanced the idea that amorphous MoS2 has a structure akin to a molecular coordination polymer comprising [Mo3S13]2− building blocks. In this regard, the terminal S22− ligands, function as the catalytically-active sites.40 In contrast, Ting et al. have reported that the catalytic activity of the [Mo3S13]2− clusters derives primarily from the bridging S22− and not terminal S22− ligands.41 Consequently, structure—function correlations remain poorly defined in this system and a systematic evaluation of how the catalytic activity towards HER evolves with crystallization and increasing domain size has not thus far been examined.
A detailed mapping of the evolution of catalytic function with increasing crystalline order holds tremendous value for developing mechanistic understanding as well as for identifying optimal processing conditions. In relevant work, Li et al. have contrasted the HER properties of poorly crystalline and well-crystalized molybdenum sulfide prepared via an ambient-pressure chemical vapor deposition process.42 These authors have found that the poorly crystalline molybdenum sulfides exhibit lower overpotentials and Tafel slopes, whereas their highly crystalline and annealed counterparts yield higher turnover frequencies and much improved stabilities. However, in the absence of a detailed evolution of the characteristics as a function of the annealing temperature, a full understanding of structure—function correlations remains elusive in this system. In this work, we have systematically characterized the evolution of the structure of molybdenum sulfide upon annealing from an amorphous phase and have correlated the structures therein to electrocatalytic properties. Such structure—function mapping provides a clear pathway for evaluation of the influence of dimensionality and local structure on catalytic function for transition metal dichalcogenide electrocatalysts.
Results and discussion
A homogeneous precursor solution for the deposition of amorphous molybdenum sulfide is prepared by dissolving 1.25 wt% (NH4)2MoS4 in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF). The solution is then cast onto a conductive carbon fiber paper substrate and annealed under a flowing Ar atmosphere in the range of 120 to 1000 °C within a tube furnace (Tmelting of MoS2 is 1185 °C). The substrate laden with amorphous or partially crystallized MoS2 is used directly as the working electrode while evaluating HER activity. The precursor (NH4)2MoS4 decomposes to MoS2 as per: (NH4)2MoS4 (s) → 2NH3 (g) + H2S (g) + MoS3 (s)(2)the MoS3 phase is further thermally decomposed as per: MoS3 (s) → MoS2 (s) + S (g)(3)above 335 °C.43
Based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the thermal decomposition of (NH4)2MoS4 dissolved in DMF is characterized by two distinct endothermic events at ca. 62 and 116 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), corresponding to the loss of NH3 and then the elimination of H2S, respectively. Since this precursor solution decomposes cleanly at ca. 116 °C, the molybdenum sulfide samples prepared at 120 °C and above do not include appreciable amounts of impurities, as indeed verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) studies.
Fig. S2 (ESI†) depicts the morphology of thin films cast onto a Si/SiO2 substrate upon annealing to a temperature of 120 °C. The deposited amorphous MoSx forms films that are continuous on a micron scale but are characterized by a regular cracking pattern generated to relieve the residual stresses and strains induced within the substrate-adhered film upon removal of the solvent and loss of NH3 and H2S. The hierarchical crack pattern noted here has previously been observed for electrophoretically deposited CdSe quantum dot films upon solvent loss and similarly attributed to high in-plane stresses induced above a critical film thickness.44,45 Based on EDS analysis, the elemental composition is determined to MoSx (Mo: 41.25 at%, S: 58.75 at%) without detectable amounts of nitrogen. A conductive porous carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate has been used to facilitate electrocatalytic evaluation and to further provide a larger surface area given that the MoSx film appears to conformally adhere to the underlying substrate. Fig. 1 indicates the morphologies of the molybdenum sulfide films deposited on the CFP substrate and annealed at various temperatures from 120 to 1000 °C. The individual carbon fibers are ca. 7 μm in diameter and are homogeneously covered by the deposited molybdenum sulfide films, which in many instances have sufficient mechanical resilience to span across and interconnect several fibers. Interestingly, upon low-temperature annealing, a pronounced cracked microstructure with a hierarchical fracture pattern is noted as with the Si/SiO2 substrates; however, the films annealed at 250, 300, and 500 °C do not show the intricate network of cracks. The change in microstructure and crack patterns is attributed to stronger adhesion and mechanisms for strain relief through deformation and straining of the underlying carbon fiber substrate that become accessible at high temperatures. The sample annealed at 1000 °C again shows a fracture pattern that results from a large and rapid volume change upon annealing to this temperature. Notably, there appears to be relatively little correlation between microscale fracture patterns and electrocatalytic activity (vide infra).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the molybdenum sulfides deposited on CFP and calcined in the temperature range from 120 to 1000 °C under an Ar atmosphere. The top and bottom images show low- and high-magnification images for each annealing temperature, respectively. The annealing temperatures are as follows: (a) and (b) 120 °C; (c) and (d) 150 °C; (e) and (f) 180 °C; (g) and (h) 200 °C; (i) and (j) 250 °C; (k) and (l) 300 °C; (m) and (n) 500 °C; and (o) and (p) 1000 °C. 

Fig. 2a shows Raman spectra of the molybdenum sulfides formed on CFP at low annealing temperatures in the range of 120–300 °C. Raman spectroscopy is a probe of local structure and indeed localized phonon modes are immediately discernible at low annealing temperatures even when X-ray diffraction does not indicate any evidence of long range order (Fig. S3, ESI†). Indeed, distinctive bands corresponding to molybdenum–molybdenum linkages (ν(Mo–Mo) at 233 cm−1), molybdenum sulfide bonds (ν(Mo–S) at 284–383 cm−1 and ν(Mo3–S) at 450 cm−1), terminal disulfides (ν(S–S)t at 520 cm−1), and bridging/shared disulfide (ν(S–S)br/sh at 553 cm−1) are clearly discernible and are assigned based on previous literature reports of the vibrational spectra of thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2− clusters and/or MoS3.40,42,46 Notably, the bridging and terminal disulfide bonds are discernible even at 120 and 150 °C where the Mo–S linkages appear to be less well defined. However, beyond annealing temperatures of 180 °C, the latter modes also clearly emerge above the baseline. It is worth noting that there is considerable literature precedence for [Mo3S13]2− clusters and MoS3 formed at low temperatures exhibiting high HER activity as a result of the presence of terminal disulfide (S22−) ligands, which can stabilize molybdenum hydride moieties and act as the active sites for HER.40,42,46 The materials formed in the temperature range of 200–300 °C reveal the characteristic bands of crystalline MoS2 (E12g, in-plane Mo–S mode at 375 cm−1 and A1g out-of-plane S mode at 401 cm−1)47 suggesting the emergence of some intermediate-range order. However, these bands are superimposed on the bands derived from [Mo3S13]2− clusters and MoS3, suggesting that while extended ordered phases have been nucleated, these crystalline phases coexist with the amorphous and molecular frameworks.48,49
 Fig. 2  Raman spectra (λex. = 514.5 nm) of the molybdenum sulfides deposited onto CFP and annealed under an Ar atmosphere in the temperature range (a) from 120 to 300 °C (a closer view) and (b) from 120 to 1000 °C (range from 200–700 cm−1). The assignments noted in (a) are discussed in the text. 

Fig. 2b indicates that annealing at temperatures of 500 °C and higher results in the prominent emergence of the characteristic Raman bands of 2H-MoS2 (a mode of E12g symmetry at 381 cm−1 and a A1g symmetry mode at 404 cm−1);47 the localized modes corresponding to [Mo3S13]2− clusters are substantially reduced in intensity as these clusters are subsumed to grow the 2-H MoS2 crystallites. The blue-shifting and narrowing of the characteristic 2H-MoS2 modes from 250–1000 °C and their pronounced increase in intensity are suggestive of larger crystallite dimensions as phonon confinement effects are eliminated (only Brillouin zone center phonons are observed as per Raman selection rules).27 The sample annealed at 1000 °C shows characteristic Raman modes of well-crystallized 2H-MoS2 at 381 and 407 cm−1, which can be assigned to E12g and A1g phonons, respectively. A gradual increase in the relative ratio of A1g to E12g is observed with increasing temperature from 200 to 1000 °C. This increase suggests a reduced density of edge sites and a greater degree of ordering between layers of MoS2.47,50
The crystallinity of the annealed materials has been further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as indicated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The (002) reflections of 2H-MoS2 (2θ = 14.4°) are discernible only upon annealing to 500 and 1000 °C. For annealing temperatures <500 °C, no reflections characteristic of crystalline MoS2 can be distinguished; the diffraction patterns of these samples are dominated by the reflection derived from the graphitized CFP substrate (Fig. S3, ESI†). A Scherrer analysis of the diffraction patterns of the MoS2 architectures formed upon annealing at 500 and 1000 °C yields average crystallite sizes of 2.4 and 30.0 nm, respectively.51 Given that the amount of the precursor is held constant after drop-casting, the increase in domain size necessarily comes from incorporation of the MoSx molecular clusters.

Fig. 3 indicates high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns that have been acquired for flakes harvested from the CFP substrates by ultrasonication. For annealing temperatures in the range of 120–180 °C, no lattice planes can be resolved and the materials appear to be entirely amorphous, as indeed verified by the SAED patterns in Fig. 3b. For samples annealed at 200 °C, a few sparse crystalline domains can be resolved that can range a few nanometers in length but span <5 nm in thickness. The lattice spacing (ca. 6.2 Å) can be indexed to the separation between the (002) planes of 2H-MoS2. This sample clearly comprises ultra-thin domains of crystalline MoS2 embedded within an amorphous matrix. This observation is consistent with the emergence of Raman signatures of crystalline MoS2 observed upon annealing at this temperature (Fig. 2). The relative abundance of the crystalline domains is greatly increased upon annealing at 250 and 300 °C; the SAED patterns (Fig. 3b) further become much more structured at these temperatures as compared to the diffuse rings observed for the materials annealed at lower temperatures. Indeed, Fig. 3b suggests that annealing at 300 °C results in the emergence of (100) diffraction spots that can be distinguished from the diffuse ring pattern. The detailed microstructure of the nanocrystalline domains is more clearly visible in Fig. 4 wherein the colors denote the extent of crystallinity. The TEM image of nanocrystalline MoS2 embedded in an amorphous matrix (Fig. 4a) has been converted using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain a frequency domain image, which is filtered to retain the contrast from the crystalline domains. Inverse-FFT has been performed to reconstruct the images in real space and is plotted as a false color image in Fig. 4b to highlight the contrast between amorphous and crystalline phases. The crystalline domains are marked in red and yellow.

 Fig. 4  (a) HRTEM image of molybdenum sulfide flake harvested from the CFP substrate after annealing at 250 °C under an Ar ambient and (b) corresponding color image mapping the extent of crystallinity. The color is changed from blue to green to yellow to red with increasing crystallinity. 
The image depicts crystalline nuclei embedded within less crystalline domains that in turn are surrounded by amorphous regions (crystalline MoS2@amorphous MoS2). Furthermore, the color map of Fig. 4b provides insight into the crystallization process upon annealing. As the annealing temperature is increased, crystalline nuclei are formed that span a few nanometers in length (which is likely the nucleation volume); the nuclei grow by subsuming the amorphous matrix and are interconnected with increasing density. Upon annealing to a temperature of 500 °C and above, distinctive layered crystalline sheets are stabilized, as depicted in Fig. 5; concomitantly, the SAED pattern is transformed to that of polycrystalline 2-H MoS2 and several other diffraction spots can be indexed (Fig. 5b). The few-layered 2-H MoS2 prepared by annealing at 1000 °C spans ca. 1 μm in length. The increase in grain size, as also evidenced from XRD measurements results in a multitude of discrete diffraction spots as indexed in Fig. 5b.

The nature of chemical bonding in these structures has been investigated by XPS (Fig. 6). Regardless of the annealing temperature, the Mo 3d core level spectra show a distinctive doublet with similar binding energies at 229.40 and 232.60 eV, ascribed to the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states, respectively; these binding energies are characteristic of tetravalent Mo.52 The small shoulder at 226.70 eV, observed for samples annealed above 200 °C, is attributed to S 2s.35,36,42,46,53 In stark contrast, the S 2p core level spectra are greatly modified as a function of the annealing temperature. A doublet of features at relatively low binding energies of 162.25 eV (S 2p3/2) and 163.40 eV (S 2p1/2) arises from unsaturated and/or terminal S22−; another set of features with binding energies of 163.70 eV (S 2p3/2) and 164.90 (S 2p1/2) is ascribed to apical and/or bridging S22− within [Mo3S13]2− clusters.41,42,46 The intensities of the features arising from unsaturated and or terminal S2− species are diminished upon annealing from 120 to 250 °C, suggesting that the amorphous Mo–S precursors are incorporated within the [Mo3S13]2− clusters. The low-energy peaks at 162.25 and 163.45 eV are again increased in relative intensity upon annealing at 300 °C and beyond as a result of the nucleation and growth of nanocrystalline MoS2 domains as also observed in the HRTEM images depicted in Fig. 3. In addition, the XPS results indicate that the S:Mo atomic ratio gradually decreases with increasing calcination temperature from 120 to 300 °C, consistent with loss of elemental sulfur as per eqn (3). Beyond a temperature of 300 °C, the Mo:S stoichiometry stabilizes at ca. 1:2. For the samples annealed at temperatures of 500 and 1000 °C a distinctive doublet at 162.25 eV (2p3/2) and 163.45 eV (2p1/2), characteristic of MoS2, is observed.
 Fig. 6  XPS spectra indicating Mo 3d and S 2p binding energies for samples annealed in the temperature range between 120 and 1000 °C. The S 2p spectra are deconvoluted to (i) 2p1/2 and (ii) 2p3/2 peaks for apical and/or bridging S22− and to (iii) 2p1/2 and (iv) 2p3/2 peaks for unsaturated and/or terminal S22−. 
The characterization data discussed above provide a detailed picture of the evolution of structure upon annealing of the (NH4)2MoS4 precursors cast onto a CFP substrate and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7 and can be rationalized based on insightful calculations of thermodynamic formation energies of these species calculated by Lee et al.54 On a scale where higher heats of formation represent lower thermodynamic stabilities with respect to 2H-MoS2 (which represents the baseline at 0 eV and is the thermodynamic minimum), these authors have predicted a bulk formation energy of 3.19 eV per atom for Mo3S4 clusters.54 In the temperature range from 120–180 °C, amorphous molecular Mo–S species are crosslinked to form [Mo3S13]2− clusters characterized by both apical/bridging S22− and unsaturated/terminal S22− moieties. Distinctive Raman bands are discernible for such clusters and the S 2p binding energies corroborate the presence of these distinctive disulfide species. The calculated bulk formation energy is 1.60 eV per atom for the Mo3S13 cluster and thus with increased annealing temperature, the system moves to a species that is more thermodynamically stable.54 Subsequent heating to 200 °C brings about the initial nucleation of MoS2 nanocrystallites, spanning only a few nanometers, as directly visualized in Fig. 3 and 4. The MoS2 domains are clearly formed by crosslinking of the clusters and further elimination of sulfur as discernible from the XPS measurements of Fig. 6. Up to 300 °C, nucleation and growth proceed in tandem with the [Mo3S13]2− clusters serving as the “monomeric” species. A much higher density of nanocrystallites are discernible in HRTEM images (Fig. 3) and the Raman bands for MoS2 are strongly increased in intensity at the expense of the phonon modes of the clusters. These samples comprise a biphasic mixture of nanometer-sized crystalline domains embedded within an amorphous quasi-molecular matrix (Fig. 4). Amorphous MoS2 is more stable than the clusters with a predicted formation energy of 1.09 eV per atom.54 Upon annealing at 500 °C, phase-pure nanocrystalline MoS2 is observed although based on Scherrer analysis the domain sizes span only a few nanometers. Annealing to 1000 °C brings about considerable grain growth and continuous nanosheets spanning ca. 1 μm in length are observed with thicknesses of a few tens of nanometers. Based on comparison with predicted formation energies,54 the structural evolution of molybdenum sulfide observed here proceeds towards increasing thermodynamic stability with annealing temperature.
 Fig. 7  Schematic illustration describing the evolution of structure upon annealing of (NH4)2MoS4 precursor solution. An amorphous to crystalline transition is mediated by cross-linking of [Mo3S13]2− to nucleate crystalline MoS2, which further grows with increasing annealing temperature to yield 2D layered nanosheets. The formation energies noted in the figure are derived from ref. 54. 
The structural diversity accessible from thermal annealing (Fig. 7) has inspired a comparative investigation of the electrocatalytic properties of these species, which is facilitated by the use of a conductive substrate, thereby allowing the annealed samples to be directly used as the working electrode. The electrocatalytic properties have been investigated in a 0.5 M aqueous solution of H2SO4 using a typical three-electrode system. Fig. 8a and b show polarization curves and Tafel slopes, which have been corrected for ohmic losses (iR) (Fig. S4, ESI†). The polarization curve for the bare CFP substrate is shown for comparison and the substrate is observed to be essentially catalytically inert towards HER in the measured potential range. The exchange current density (J0) is a quantitative measure of the rate of the electrochemical reaction at equilibrium (i.e., η = 0).55 The value of J0 can be derived from the Butler–Volmer equation as per J = −J0 × 10η/b, where J is the measured current density, η is the overpotential, and b is the Tafel slope.56 The resulting overpotential (η10), required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (conventionally, the current density required for a 12.3% efficiency device anticipated to be cost competitive for a photoelectrochemical cell)4,57 as well as the Tafel slopes determined for the samples annealed at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 8c. Fig. 8a and b indicate that the η10 and Tafel slope values are sharply decreased as the annealing temperature increases from 120 to 300 °C. The overpotential is reduced from 211 to 176 mV, whereas the Tafel slope is decreased from 83.2 to 49.2 mV dec−1. Increasing the annealing temperature to 400 °C brings about a modest increase of the overpotential and Tafel slope. Annealing to still higher temperatures brings about a pronounced increase of the overpotential and Tafel slope with values of 434 mV and 177.3 mV dec−1, respectively, observed for the sample annealed at 1000 °C.
 Fig. 8  (a) Polarization curves and (b) Tafel plots measured for the molybdenum sulfide samples prepared by annealing at temperatures of 120–1000 °C on CFP substrates contrasted to data acquired for bare CFP. In (b), Tafel slope values are noted with dimensions of mV dec−1. The data have been acquired in aqueous solutions of 0.5 M H2SO4 using a three-electrode system. (c) The overpotentials required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope values are plotted as a function of the annealing temperature. The overpotentials have been corrected for the internal resistance values (Fig. S4†). (d) The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA), plotted as a function of the annealing temperature. 
Electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of all the annealed samples have been estimated by measuring the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) from cyclic voltammetry (CV) data in a potential region with no faradaic current.55,58,59 The cyclic voltammograms have been collected with various scan rates ranging from 20–100 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0.13–0.20 V versus RHE, where the current is preponderantly derived from the charging of the double layer (and not from eqn (1)). Fig. S5 (ESI†) depicts CV curves acquired for molybdenum sulfides annealed at different temperatures. The difference between anodic and cathodic current densities (Δj) at 0.17 V versus RHE for each CV plot is shown as a function of the scan rate in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The slope of each Δj versus scan rate plot is equal to 2Cdl. The ECSA has been derived from the ratio of the measured Cdl with respect to the specific capacitance of flat crystalline MoS2 (ca. 66.7 μF cm−2).55,58,59 The Cdl and ECSA values are plotted as a function of the annealing temperature in Fig. 8d. An important caveat in considering ECSA values is that the non-faradaic current provides a measure of exposed surface sites, both those that are catalytically active as well as those that are catalytically inactive. In MoS2, only the edge sites are active and the basal planes are inactive, and thus while the ECSA provides an idea of the electrochemically addressable density of sites, it is not directly a measure of the areal density of active catalytic sites.57 Nevertheless, these values provide a relative measure of the evolution of the overall density of surface sites as a function of the annealing temperature. The Cdl and ESCA values slightly increase from 120 to 180 °C but are then of approximately the same order of magnitude (ECSA = 60–80 cm2) up to a temperature of 300 °C before decreasing by orders of magnitude upon annealing to still higher temperatures. The initial increase in ESCA from 120–180 °C accompanies cross-linking of the amorphous precursors to form [Mo3S13]2− clusters characterized by both apical/bridging as well as unsaturated/terminal S22− moieties and is posited to result from better structuring of the thin film (Fig. 7) as well-defined cluster motifs are defined and interfaced with the carbon fiber substrate. The decrease of overpotential and Tafel slope observed in Fig. 8c are both electrode-level measures of catalytic efficiency. Recent reports suggest that the bridging S22− of [Mo3S13]2− clusters exhibits higher catalytic reactivity as compared to terminal S22− units that are present even within entirely amorphous structures.41 The initial increase of catalytic activity with annealing temperature observed here correlates with the increase of ESCA and along with Raman (Fig. 2) and XPS (Fig. 6) corroboration of an increased concentration of bridging S22− as compared to terminal S22− units supports this contention and indeed suggests that the former are more catalytically active. From 180–300 °C, the ESCA does not substantially change but the overpotential and Tafel slope continue to decrease. The overall current density (J) at a given potential. J = f × S × TOF × nF/ANA(4)where f is the fraction of active sites, S is the ECSA and represents the total number of surface sites, TOF is the average turnover frequency that is a measure of the average intrinsic activity of each site, n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule, A is the superficial electrode area, F is Faraday's constant, and NA is Avogadro's constant. If the total number of surface sites remains essentially constant, either the fraction of active sites or the average turnover frequency must be increasing within this temperature range. Based on the structural evidence presented above, the creation of crystalline MoS2 nuclei with well-defined edge sites likely translates to an increase in the intrinsic activity of the sites. In other words, the overpotential and Tafel slope values are reduced for these better defined domains suggesting a lower activation energy barrier for HER at nanocrystallite edges. Next, upon the stabilization of extended crystalline domains by annealing to temperatures of 400 °C and above, the Cdl and ECSA values are reduced by more than two orders of magnitude (Fig. 8d) as a result of mass loss (as per eqn (3)) and grain growth, which creates basal planes and substantially reduces the density of edge planes (as also indicated by the A1g to E12g ratio observed by Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 2).47 Such growth of MoS2 nanocrystallites at 500 °C, reducing the edge-to-basal plane ratio, greatly increases the η10 and Tafel slope values to 416 mV and 198.5 mV dec−1, respectively, indicating the deterioration of the overall electrode-level HER activity (Fig. 8c); clearly, a large number of catalytically active sites are lost during the grain growth process, thereby substantially decreasing S in eqn (4) and reducing the overall electrode activity. The change in the Tafel slope values furthermore suggest an alteration of the HER mechanism. The low Tafel slope values (<100 mV dec−1) measured for catalysts prepared at low temperatures of 120–400 °C suggest the operation of the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism wherein the rate-determining steps involve both proton reduction and hydrogen desorption.28,60 In contrast, the high Tafel slope values (>120 mV dec−1) of catalysts prepared at temperatures of 500 °C and above indicate that the HER proceeds through the Volmer mechanism, wherein proton reduction yielding hydrogen adatoms bound to the active sites represents the rate-determining step.28
The average TOF, defined as the number of H2 evolved per active site per unit time, is an essential parameter to contrast the intrinsic catalytic activity of different systems.55,58,59 However, as per eqn (4), in the absence of information regarding the fraction of active sites, the quantity that can be deduced from measurements of ECSA and J is f × TOF (given that the number of active sites on a flat surface of crystalline MoS2 is 1.164 × 1015 cm−2).59 As noted above, a major caveat for a heterogeneous sample such as MoS2 is that the electrochemically addressable surface area cannot be taken as a direct measure of the areal density of active catalytic sites. Nevertheless, as often depicted in the literature and to facilitate comparison between the different samples, Fig. 9a plots the average TOF (per active site) of the molybdenum sulfides prepared on CFP in the applied potential range of −0.1 to −0.3 V versus RHE where the HER is controlled by electrode kinetics with minimal influence from other effects with the assumption that f = 1. The variation in average TOF for heterogeneous catalysts including MoS2 can span 10 orders of magnitude.61 A primary observation is that the deduced average TOF values here (see also Table 1) do not diverge more than an order of magnitude across the range of annealing temperatures examined here. The deduced average TOF values are furthermore comparable to the best solution-phase molybdenum sulfide catalysts reported in the literature57 such as molybdenum sulfide cubanes supported on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.62

The samples annealed to low temperatures in the 120–180 °C range show relatively low average TOF values of 0.6–0.8H2 per s per active site at −0.2 V versus RHE and J0 values of 0.05–0.06 μA cm−2 (Fig. 9b). Only for annealing temperatures above 400 °C, are the average TOF values substantially increased (Fig. 9b) reaching a value of 8.47H2 per s for the sample annealed at 1000 °C. Considering Fig. 8a, the variation of current density in proximity of the onset potential is about one order of magnitude as a function of the annealing temperature and yet Fig. 8d indicates that the ECSA is decreased by over two orders of magnitude upon increasing the annealing temperature from 120 to 1000 °C; based on eqn (4), f × TOF thus must increase by at least an order of magnitude. Based on the TEM images depicted in Fig. 3 and 4 and the Raman evidence of Fig. 2, the density of edge sites (which is expected to be correlated to f) is substantially decreased with increasing annealing temperature and thus the average TOF is enhanced with annealing temperature. The increased TOF likely reflects both the stabilization of better defined (−1010) sulfur edges as well as reduced mass transport limitations as the incipient MoS2 nanosheets form sub-monolayer electrically connected interfaces with the carbon fiber paper. Fig. 9c maps the correlation between annealing temperature, overpotential, and turnover frequency. The sample annealed at 300 °C comprising a high density of ultra-thin MoS2 nuclei embedded within a matrix of clusters appears to provide a happy medium between electrode level performance and the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. This sample yields η10 = 176 mV and a Tafel slope = 49.2 mV dec−1 along with a deduced average TOF of 1.15H2 per s per active site at −0.2 V versus RHE and a J0 value of 0.02647 μA cm−2 (Fig. 8c and 9b). Table 1 contrasts the electrode-level performance and intrinsic catalytic activity of amorphous and crystalline molybdenum sulfides, Mo–S clusters, and Pt and suggests that that the sample annealed at 300 °C shows excellent performance for a non-precious-metal catalyst.
Dihydrogen generation from the samples annealed at 150, 300, and 750 °C has been further examined by gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the resulting GC traces derived for headspace analysis with an injection volume of 1 mL CH4 as an internal standard. The peaks eluting from the column at ca. 1.35 and 4.13 min correspond to H2 and CH4, respectively. The area ratio of H2 to CH4 peaks is calculated to be 3.75 for the 150 °C-annealed sample, 5.48 for the 300 °C-annealed sample, and 1.18 for 750 °C-annealed sample, which further corroborates the greater electrode-level activity of the sample annealed at 300 °C. Based on the calculated ratios, the faradaic efficiencies are deduced to be 21%, 23%, and quantitative (100%) for 150, 300, and 750 °C-annealed samples, respectively. These results are again consistent with the higher electrode-level activity of the sample annealed at 300 °C and the higher per-site catalytic efficiency of the crystalline MoS2 samples annealed at 1000 °C that has a well-defined edge geometry.
To assess the long-term stability of the molybdenum sulfides prepared on CFP at each temperature, CV sweeps have been performed for 1000 cycles in a 0.5 M aqueous solution of H2SO4 in the range between −0.2 and 0.2 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S8, ESI†). After 1000 cycles, the amorphous molybdenum sulfides prepared at 120–180 °C show an increase of the η10 by more than 20 mV. The magnitude of the η10 increase is reduced with an increase of the η10 by an amount of ca. 5 mV in the molybdenum sulfides prepared at 200–300 °C. The polarization curves for the nanocrystalline MoS2 prepared at 500 and 1000 °C are almost exactly superimposable upon the initial data suggesting no degradation in performance for these highly crystalline nanosheets that are strongly interfaced with the underlying carbon fiber substrate. To further investigate the degradation of catalytic activity for the low-temperature amorphous phases, the molybdenum sulfide sample prepared at 120 °C has been characterized by XPS after 1000 CV cycles (Fig. S9, ESI†). Interestingly, the Mo 3d spectrum shows a shoulder for Mo(VI) 3d3/2 (235.78 eV), alongside the primary Mo(IV) 3d5/2 (229.74 eV) and Mo(IV) 3d3/2 (232.64 eV) components and the S 2s (226.64 eV) shoulder.67,68 This suggests that Mo(IV) is partially oxidized to Mo(VI) as previously reported in the literature.41,42 Furthermore, based on the S 2p XPS spectrum shown in Fig. S8b,† the amount of unsaturated S2−/terminal S22− in amorphous molybdenum sulfide is observed to increase from 45 to 55 mol% after 1000 CV cycles. Therefore, the catalytic degradation of the amorphous molybdenum sulfides during CV cycling is attributed to the partial oxidation of surficial Mo sites (likely stabilizing MoO3) and increase in the amount of terminal S22− moieties that are characterized by relatively low catalytic reactivity. While MoO3 is conductive and can facilitate the catalytic activity of MoS2, if it is formed at the expense of active catalytic sites, the overall efficiency is degraded.
In summary, we have correlated electrode-level as well as site-specific electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 across its amorphous to crystalline transition to specific features of the local and average structure. Increasing annealing temperature results in stabilization of thermodynamically more stable species. The sample annealed at 300 °C comprising a high density of ultra-thin crystalline MoS2 nuclei embedded within an otherwise amorphous matrix of clusters appears to provide a happy medium between electrode level performance and the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. This sample yields η10 = 176 mV and a Tafel slope = 49.2 mV dec−1 along with an average TOF of 1.15H2 per s per active site at −0.2 V versus RHE. Samples annealed at high temperatures have well-defined edge geometries and high catalytic sites but exhibit an overall lower level of electrode characteristics as a result of the diminished density of catalytic sites.
Experimental
Preparation of molybdenum sulfides on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrates
In a typical synthesis of amorphous molybdenum sulfides integrated onto conductive carbon fiber paper, 0.25 g of ammonium thiomolybdate, (NH4)2MoS4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.97% purity) was dispersed in 20 mL of anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) in an Ar glove box to prepare a 1.25 wt% solution. The dispersion was ultrasonicated for 20 min prior to drop casting onto a cleaned CFP substrate. A loading of 100 μL cm−2 was cast onto the substrate using a micropipette. The coated solutions were calcined at various temperatures of 120–1000 °C. For the calcination, after an initial Ar purge for 20 min, the coated CFP substrates were heated to each temperature at a ramp rate of 40 °C min−1 in a tube furnace under a 50 sccm Ar flow at 1 atm. The samples were maintained at the final annealing temperature for 5 min prior to shutting off the furnace to enable cooling to room temperature.
Structural characterization
The thermal decomposition behavior of amorphous MoS2 was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q2000, TA Instruments) from 0 to 500 °C at a scan rate of 5 °C min−1 using Tzero aluminum pans under a flowing Ar atmosphere. Phase assignment was performed with the help of X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8-Advance instrument equipped with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5406 Å) as well as by Raman microprobe analysis using a Jobin-Yvon HORIBA LabRAM HR800 instrument coupled to an Olympus BX41 microscope. Raman spectra were collected with excitation from the 514.5 nm line of an Ar-ion laser; the laser power was kept below 10 mW to minimize photooxidation. The morphology of the prepared materials was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a JEOL JSM-7500F instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Flakes harvested from the CFP substrate by ultrasonication in toluene were examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy using a JEOL JEM-2010 instrument operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The chemical composition and oxidation states of the molybdenum sulfides deposited on CFP were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron XPS) using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) as the probe. Energy calibration in the XPS measurements was achieved by setting the C 1s line from adventitious hydrocarbons to 284.8 eV.
Electrochemical characterization
The HER performance of the prepared materials was evaluated using a three-electrode system operated by a Bio-Logic potentiostat (SP-200). All of the measurements were performed in a 0.5 M aqueous solution of H2SO4 purged with N2 gas. The molybdenum sulfide samples integrated onto CFP were individually used as the working electrodes. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt foil were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The potential versus SCE (ESCE) was converted to the potential versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (ERHE) using the relation ERHE = ESCE + 0.279 V.69 Polarization curves for HER were measured using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in the range between 0.1 and −0.4 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 8 mV s−1. The polarization curves were corrected for the ohmic potential drop (iR) losses, where R is the series resistance of the electrochemical cell as determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. EIS measurements were performed in the range between 200 kHz and 50 mHz using an AC amplitude of 25 mV. In order to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the samples, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the samples was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the potential range of 0.13–0.20 V versus RHE, corresponding to a non-faradaic region, at scan rates between 20–100 mV s−1.
GC analysis of gaseous products
GC analysis was performed on the headspace of sealed electrocatalytic cells with the electrode configuration as described above. The cells were sealed under an Ar ambient. After application of a constant voltage of −0.321 V versus RHE for 30 min, the headspace was sampled using a syringe. A calibrated volume of 1 mL of CH4 was injected into the headspace of the flask as an internal standard. An Agilent Trace 1300 GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a custom-made 120 cm stainless steel column packed with Carbosieve-II from Sigma-Aldrich was used for analysis. The carrier gas was Ar, and throughout the entire separation, the column was kept at 200 °C, whereas the detector was maintained at 250 °C. Identification and quantification of H2 produced from electrolysis were accomplished by withdrawing 200 μL of the headspace using a 0.5 mL Valco Precision Sampling Syringe, Series A-2 equipped with a Valco Precision Sampling syringe needle with a 5 point side port. Quantification of H2 produced was accomplished by determining the relative response factor of H2 and the internal standard, CH4. This was done by preparing vials containing varying amounts of H2 with 1 mL of CH4 for the samples annealed at 150, 300, and 750 °C and plotting the vs.. The H2 curves were calibrated as described in previous work.70
Conclusions
In summary, the electrocatalytic activity of molybdenum sulfide towards HER has been investigated across its amorphous to crystalline transition with increasing calcination temperature from 120 to 1000 °C. The crystallization process is stepwise investigated by being subdivided into the stages for pre-nucleation, nucleation and crystal growth of MoS2. The structural short-range ordering, associated with the increasing amount of the apical S2−/bridging S22−, is found at the pre-nucleation stage during low-temperature heating from 120 to 180 °C in the amorphous molybdenum sulfides consisting of the [Mo3S13]2− clusters and MoS3. Such a structural transformation reduces the η10 and Tafel slope with the increase in the Cdl and ECSA, indicating high HER activity and a large number of active sites in the amorphous phase. However, the low TOF and J0 values indicate that the per-site activity of bridging S22− atoms is low compared with MoS2 nanocrystals. The nucleation of MoS2, progressing from 180 to 300 °C in the amorphous phase, increases the overall HER activity with the improvement in the η10, Tafel slope, and TOF. The anisotropic growth of MoS2 nanocrystallites from 300 to 500 °C, primarily features the growth of catalytically inert basal planes, deteriorates the HER activity (η10 and Tafel slope) with a reduction in the active area (Cdl and ECSA). In contrast, further increase in TOF and J0 demonstrates that the inherent HER activity on the edge sites of the grown MoS2 nanocrystallites is gradually enhanced with temperature. Furthermore, the long-term instability of low-temperature amorphous phase during CV cycling is found to be due to the oxidation of Mo ions and the increasing amount of terminal S22− with relatively low catalytic reactivity. The best electrocatalytic HER activity of η10 = 176 mV and Tafel slope = 49.2 mV dec−1 is achieved in the molybdenum sulfide prepared at 300 °C, which possesses the biphasic composite structure wherein MoS2 nuclei and nanocrystallites are dispersed in an amorphous molybdenum sulfide matrix, with reasonable long-term stability.

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of the molybdenum sulfides deposited on CFP and calcined in the temperature range from 120 to 1000 °C under an Ar atmosphere. The top and bottom images show low- and high-magnification images for each annealing temperature, respectively. The annealing temperatures are as follows: (a) and (b) 120 °C; (c) and (d) 150 °C; (e) and (f) 180 °C; (g) and (h) 200 °C; (i) and (j) 250 °C; (k) and (l) 300 °C; (m) and (n) 500 °C; and (o) and (p) 1000 °C.	 

 	Fig. 2  Raman spectra (λex. = 514.5 nm) of the molybdenum sulfides deposited onto CFP and annealed under an Ar atmosphere in the temperature range (a) from 120 to 300 °C (a closer view) and (b) from 120 to 1000 °C (range from 200–700 cm−1). The assignments noted in (a) are discussed in the text.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) HRTEM images of molybdenum sulfide flakes harvested from the CFP substrate after annealing at temperatures ranging from 120–300 °C under an Ar ambient and (b) their respective SAED patterns.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) HRTEM image of molybdenum sulfide flake harvested from the CFP substrate after annealing at 250 °C under an Ar ambient and (b) corresponding color image mapping the extent of crystallinity. The color is changed from blue to green to yellow to red with increasing crystallinity.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Low-magnification TEM images of molybdenum sulfide flakes harvested from the CFP substrate after annealing at 500 and 1000 °C under an Ar ambient and (b) their respective SAED patterns.	 

 	Fig. 6  XPS spectra indicating Mo 3d and S 2p binding energies for samples annealed in the temperature range between 120 and 1000 °C. The S 2p spectra are deconvoluted to (i) 2p1/2 and (ii) 2p3/2 peaks for apical and/or bridging S22− and to (iii) 2p1/2 and (iv) 2p3/2 peaks for unsaturated and/or terminal S22−.	 

 	Fig. 7  Schematic illustration describing the evolution of structure upon annealing of (NH4)2MoS4 precursor solution. An amorphous to crystalline transition is mediated by cross-linking of [Mo3S13]2− to nucleate crystalline MoS2, which further grows with increasing annealing temperature to yield 2D layered nanosheets. The formation energies noted in the figure are derived from ref. 54.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Polarization curves and (b) Tafel plots measured for the molybdenum sulfide samples prepared by annealing at temperatures of 120–1000 °C on CFP substrates contrasted to data acquired for bare CFP. In (b), Tafel slope values are noted with dimensions of mV dec−1. The data have been acquired in aqueous solutions of 0.5 M H2SO4 using a three-electrode system. (c) The overpotentials required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope values are plotted as a function of the annealing temperature. The overpotentials have been corrected for the internal resistance values (Fig. S4†). (d) The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA), plotted as a function of the annealing temperature.	 
J = f × S × TOF × nF/ANA	(4)

 	Fig. 9  (a) Turnover frequencies of the molybdenum sulfides prepared at 120–1000 °C on CFP. (b) The turnover frequency measured at −0.2 V versus RHE and the exchange current density (J0), plotted as a function of calcination temperature. (c) 3D map indicating the correlation between annealing temperature, overpotential, and turnover frequency.
