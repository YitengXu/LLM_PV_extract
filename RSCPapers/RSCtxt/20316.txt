    , Accepted 6th April 2020First published on 7th April 2020AbstractTwo decades ago, halogen bonding attracted considerable attention as a new type of non-covalent interaction and has now emerged as an important supramolecular tool for crystal engineering, demonstrating its ability to self-assemble low affinity entities. Specific features of halogen bonds have been subsequently harnessed in biological and material sciences to give rise to elegant functional systems with a wide range of applications. In this highlight, we focused on new concepts in polymer science, electrochemistry, electronic and sensing materials. Recent findings on the use of halogenated compounds for transmembrane transport are also discussed, together with a short summary of the current understanding of the nature of the halogen bond, in the light of modern computational tools and energy decomposition.
Introduction
In the last two decades, halogen bonding (XB) has seen an upsurge of interest by the scientific community.1 Pioneering investigations in both the gas and solid phase highlighted its promising potential in supramolecular chemistry, opening to a new land of exploration and innovation.2,3 It has now become a key player in supramolecular chemistry and has found widespread applications in materials4,5 and biological sciences.6,7 XB is defined as a noncovalent attractive interaction involving a halogen as an acceptor of electron density from a neutral or anionic Lewis base (i.e. an XB acceptor). The unexpected ability of halogen atoms to interact with electron rich species was elucidated using quantum mechanical methods and gave rise to the σ-hole model.8 The electron depletion of the pz orbital anisotropically distributes the electron density with an electronegative equatorial region and the positive σ-hole along the extension of the C–X bond axis, making XB more directional than the hydrogen bond although usually weaker for identical surrounding groups.9 The dual electron donor/acceptor character of halogen atoms has been emphasized in crystalline materials,10–12 as well as a competition or cooperation phenomenon with other non-covalent bonds.13–15 The strength of the donor follows the hierarchy I > Br > Cl, but recent works also uncovered the occurrence of XB for astatine and fluorine.16,17
Recent applications of XB have been taking advantage of its high directionality, tunable strength, hydrophobicity, and the size of halogen atoms. Literature reviews have been dedicated to specific aspects including mesomorphic materials,18 organic catalysis,19 anion recognition20 and drug discovery.21
Here, we decided to cover topics in which the halogen bonds have either demonstrated a remarkable performance by comparison to other non-covalent bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds) or involved preliminary results that deserve further exploration. Within the allocated space of such a highlight piece, we focused on membrane transport, polymers, electronic materials, sensing devices and electrochemistry. We also included a short discussion on the physical nature of XB. Particular attention was drawn to recent analytical techniques that were employed to highlight halogen bonds, thus offering perspectives for the reader.
The physical nature of the halogen bond
The exact nature of XB remains an ongoing debate and controversy, although the components involved are rather well established. A realistic description should surely comprise charge-transfer, electrostatic, and covalent characters.22,23 Analysis of the molecular electrostatic potential of halogenated methane in the early nineties revealed the anisotropy of the electrostatic potential (ESP) around the halogen atoms,24 with a positive region in the prolongation of the C–X axis and a negative corolla around the halogen (Fig. 1a). The positive region was named the σ-hole more than ten years after the initial discovery, and the anisotropic electron density on halogens can even be traced back to experimental data on solid chlorine in the sixties and seventies.25,26 The σ-hole is a convenient way for representing the electron density around the halogen atoms, which is intrinsically anisotropic due to the low hybridization of their p orbitals, with one lobe of the pz orbital participating the bonding and thus being depleted along the prolongation of C–X axis. The formation of the bond indeed concentrates most of the electron density between the carbon and the halogen atom (Fig. 1b). Hence the location and geometry of the σ-hole are responsible for the quasi-linear arrangement of XB, and its magnitude can be quantified by the maximum value of the ESP at the intersection of the molecular surface and the C–X axis. This value obviously depends on the halogen itself but also on its chemical environment, this effect being more pronounced in the case of halogens attached to an aromatic ring.27–30

(b) Depletion of the pz orbital of iodine in the prolongation of the C–I axis, the py, the px and the bonding σ orbital for the CF3I⋯Cl− complex. (c) The charge transfer picture for the same complex, showing the C–X σ* antibonding orbital and the donating lone pair from Cl−. (d) Correlation plots between the produce of the magnitude of the ESP maxima from the donor–acceptor pairs with the interaction energies in the resulting complexes, showing the poor correlation when iodine is involved. (a and d were adapted from ref. 29 with permission from The American Chemical Society.) 
The ESP is usually obtained from ab initio methods or from density functional theory (DFT) and is not strongly influenced by the choice of the method, although Hartree–Fock calculations expectedly fall short in comparison to DFT, MP2 and configuration interaction. As a rule of thumb, DFT with triple-ζ basis sets provide accurate ESP at a reasonable computational cost, and deliver better accuracy than the more costly MP2 level.31,32
The magnitude of the hole and the strength of the resulting XB are somehow correlated, the stronger interaction energies with the more positive ESP.27,28 Different pairs of donors and acceptors can be evaluated by the products of their maximal and minimal ESP, respectively. The most striking evidence from this is that the correlation stands true for XB complexes involving Cl and Br donors, but becomes poor when iodine is involved, highlighting the higher degree of involvement of other forces in the bonding, owing to the higher polarizability of iodine, along with purely electrostatic interactions (Fig. 1c).33 The electrostatic model and the σ-hole both notoriously fail in the case of CX3I⋯X′ (where X and X′ are any of F, Cl, Br and I). The strongest dipoles and σ-holes are indeed correlated with weaker interactions. The highest stabilization energies are found for CI4⋯X′, CI4 having no total dipole at all but a low energy σ*, making it a particularly good electron acceptor in the picture of charge-transfer.34 This example shows the limits of the electrostatic model and the σ-hole, and the interplay of other interactions such as charge transfer.
The IUPAC definition of XB is somewhat elusive and if the interaction is first regarded as electrostatic, a cautionary statement follows: “the forces involved in the formation of the halogen bond are primarily electrostatic, but polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion contributions all play an important role. The relative roles of the different forces may vary from one case to the other”.1 Electrostatics and charge transfer should indeed be considered as separate forces at play in non-covalent interactions and XB. The exact proportion varies from case to case and its determination by quantum mechanical method has no unique definition and partitioning. The widely used natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis tends to overestimate the contribution of charge transfer.35,36 The Head-Gordon group recently used variational energy decomposition from absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMO-EDA) to analyse the interaction energy composition of the CX3I⋯Cl− complex: the decomposition comes with increased charge transfer when going down the periodic table. The electrostatic contribution shows the opposite trend, although making less of a difference to the overall binding energy changes and the dispersive stabilization is similar in all cases.22 This well emphasizes the need of both the electrostatic picture and the σ-hole, associated with the involvement of variable charge transfer depending of the XB donor–acceptor pair.
XB-mediated membrane transport
Thyroid hormones
Medium to high molecular weight and hydrophilic molecules poorly diffuse through physiological membranes and XB-mediated transmembrane transport has emerged in the recent years. Thyroid hormones T4 and T3 are obvious naturally occurring XB-donors (Fig. 2a). Their transport is mediated in the blood by the thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and the human serum albumin (HSA).37 The crystal structure of TTR complexed with T4 in its two binding sites displays short contacts on site I between various residues and the hormone iodines.38 Although it is reported that contacts involve nitrogen from the peptide backbone at the Ala109 and Leu110, a careful examination reveal XB with the carbonyl lone pairs in site I, while little interaction is made within binding site II. Beyond blood transport, several proteins allow thyroid hormones to enter cells and cross physiological barriers like the blood–brain barrier, such as the monocarboxylate transporters and 10 (MCT8/10) and the solute carrier organic anion transporter family 1C1 (OATP1C1). MCT8 appears to specifically shuttle thyroid hormones.39,40 It is however unclear how the binding of T3/T4 to MCT8 involve XB, as no crystal structure has been available to date.

(c) 4-Amino-1,8-naphthalimide molecular probes show a dramatic increase in cell penetration following iodine substitution. (b was adapted from ref. 41 with permission from Wiley.) 
Synthetic molecules
Small molecule cellular uptake can be considerably enhanced by the presence of halogens. The most striking effects have been seen with naphthalimide-based fluorescent probes, where the introduction of iodine dramatically enhanced cellular penetration to a much higher extent than their Cl and Br analogues (Fig. 2b).41 These 4-amino-1,8-naphtalimide dyes consistently showed increased uptake when the phenyl ring was substituted with halogens in the order I > Br > Cl, in addition to the methylation of the aromatic amine and phenol. The mechanism of uptake involves facilitated transport through MCT8, as evidenced by the uptake inhibition with silychristin, a specific MCT8 inhibitor. Competitive inhibition by T4 and T3 further prove cellular uptake to involve specific thyroid hormone transport.41 Similar trends were observed when the diiodoanisole moiety was placed at the aromatic amine, which conducted the authors to anchor this moiety to other fluorophores and verify its ability to help crossing cellular membranes. Conjugates with 2,3-dithiomaleimide and coumarin fluorophores once again had increased cellular accumulation following the introduction of the diiodoanisole part in contrast with anisole.42 A further step was taken by efficiently increasing the cell penetration of the green fluorescent protein by single atom substitution, namely the halogenation of Tyr39, located on the protein surface. The 5-fold increase in cellular accumulation was found to involve ATP-dependent caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but not the MCT8 transporter.43
The effect of halogen substitution on the cellular accumulation of anticancer ruthenium(II) complexes resulted in more mitigated trends. Adding halogens at the X1 and X2 positions slightly increased cellular uptake but most probably through added lipophilicity. A stronger increase was seen when chlorine was added at the X1 position and iodine at the X2 position (Fig. 2c).44 It is not known if XB-mediated transmembrane passage was involved.
Halogen bonds have also been involved in shuttling other species through bilayer membranes and a first attempt was made with calix[4]-arenes acting as counterion-activated transporters with effective halogen bonds and anion–π interactions. Modest anion transport activity was recorded for constructs resulting in strong XB-bound anion-transporter complexes. Pure anion–π transporters also exhibited activity, as did weakened XB-donor analogs, highlighting the “Goldilocks principle” and the fact that strong binders are not good transporters (Fig. 3a).45,46 A series of oxacalix[2]-arene[2]triazine transporters bearing anion–π-, hydrogen-, and halogen-bonding sites was also reported with EC50s in the micromolar range. Although halogen bonding was clearly involved in the host–guest interaction, anion–π and hydrogen bonds were critical and showed to retain transport activity in the absence of HB donors.47

The relative failure of cyclic XB-donors to shuttle anion through membranes was solved by unwinding the synthetic transporters to linear, rod-like structures that functioned as ion hoppers (Fig. 3b).48 The directionality and strength of XB, combined to its lipophilicity, makes it a good candidate for synthetic transport systems and simple perfluoroalkanes with a terminal iodine can act as efficient anion transporters, down to the simplest trifluoroiodomethane.46,49 Zeng and co-workers further used monopeptidic scaffolds to make artificial chloride channels. These scaffolds can stack into vertical columnar structures by tight intermolecular H-bonds and present well-arranged arrays of halogen bond donors, while two variable groups allowed for fine tuning of the anion recognitions by a combinatorial approach, leading to EC50s below the micromolar range.50 These compounds could further disrupt anion homeostasis in the breast cancer cell line BT-474 that resulted in moderate antiproliferative effects (IC50 around 20 μM).
Polymer chemistry
Self-assembly of complementary species
Recognition processes involving complementary polymers have broad interest in (bio)material sciences,51 and H-bonds were historically used as the driving force for recognition while XB remain unexplored. In 2015, Taylor and co-workers prepared complementary polymers, i.e. poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and derivatives bearing iodotetrafluorophenoxy repeating units using controlled polymerization followed by self-assembly through XB in aqueous solution.52 A new XB-donor unit (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-iodo-4-vinyl-1,1-biphenyl), was similarly polymerized by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) and gave rise to a poly(iodotetrafluoro-4′-vinyl-1,1′-biphenyl) derivative (PIVP) and a diblock copolymer PEO-b-PIVP with low polydispersity indices (Đ = 1.12–1.23) (Fig. 4). When PIVP was challenged with PEO-b-PDMAEMA, unusual internal inverse hexagonal (H‖) phases were obtained, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). New porous and internally structured particles were formed by decreasing the number of dimethylamino groups of PEO-b-PDMAEMA by half. In contrast, the combination of PEO-b-PIVP and PEO-b-PDMAEMA resulted in the formation of spherical and worm-like morphologies. Binding energies of the iodine 3d electrons by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 19F NMR shifts confirmed the role played by the halogen bonds in the formation of these structures, although XB donor groups occupancy was 50–60%.53 The same group further investigated the self-assembly of PIVP with new triblock terpolymers possessing central poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(caprolactone) (PCL) hydrophobic blocks, namely PEO-b-PMMA-b-PDMAEMA and PEO-b-PCL-b-PDMAEMA, respectively (Fig. 4). The stepwise co-assembly in solution followed the typical sequence acetonitrile → acetone → water, leading to clustered and aggregated morphologies according to TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Upon transfer to water, micelles comprised of chemically distinct compartments were formed due to the collapse of the hydrophobic PMMA or PCL blocks, creating a second compartment in addition to the one driven by XB.54 Inverted hexagonal H‖ phases are frequently encountered in self-assembled lipid nanostructures where the polar head groups decorate the internal cylinders.55 Such porous morphologies possessing XB-donor groups could thereby open new avenues for separation materials or nanoreactors.

Another approach consisted in the self-assembly of the homopolymers and diblock copolymers PITFPh and PEO-b-PITFPh bearing iodotetrafluorophenoxy XB donor units with a macrocyclic N-benzyl ammonium resorcinarene bromide ResBr as XB acceptor (Fig. 4). The resulting polymeric complexes provided spherical morphologies, as determined by TEM and DLS. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies highlighted the presence of I⋯Br− halogen bonds through the changes in the C–I and C–F vibrations, respectively, confirming the pivotal role of XB in these assemblies.56
These examples highlight the use of XB-donor polymers as an attractive strategy for the preparation of complexes loaded with several distinct functional entities. The design of these complexes with potential (multi)stimuli responsiveness make them appealing systems in (bio)materials sciences.57
Soft materials
This section omits halogen bonded liquid crystals as they have recently been the topic of a review.18 Environmentally harmless, sustainable and eco-friendly materials have become important aspects of chemistry and next-generation materials should have, in some aspects, self-restoring properties aiming at extending their service life.58 Various approaches including supramolecular recognition have been employed to this purpose but it has only been in 2017 that Schubert and coworkers developed self-healing polymer networks with XB. Repeating units comprising iodotriazole groups and butylmethacrylate were polymerized through RAFT to obtain the SHI1 copolymer (Mn = 30100 g mol−1, Đ = 1.16), followed by methylation the triazole rings to give the corresponding SHI2 copolymer (Mn = 17000 g mol−1, Đ = 1.14) (Fig. 6). In parallel, a complementary donor system, SHD1 (Mn = 33300 g mol−1, Đ = 1.13), was obtained by copolymerization of methacrylic acid and butylmethacrylate which underwent alkaline treatment to give the partially deprotonated copolymer SHD2 (Mn = 28700 g mol−1, Đ = 1.11) (Fig. 6). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) highlighted a stronger interaction of copolymer SHI2 to AcO− than to Br− with association constants of 4.2 × 105 M−1 and 2.9 × 104 M−1, respectively. After preparation of the cross-linked polymeric networks SHI1/SHD1 and SHI2/SHD2 by solvent evaporation, nano-indentation measurements revealed slightly higher stiffness for the neutral film SHI1/SHD1 while FT-Raman highlighted stronger I⋯O interactions in SHI2/SHD2 compared to SHI1/SHD2. Finally, after a scratch test at 100 °C, all samples were endowed with self-healing properties (Fig. 5).59 The same group later investigated another system composed of a copolymer (BMP, Mn = 15100 g mol−1, Đ = 1.21) bearing butyl methacrylate and phosphate functional units as XB acceptors and four iodotriazole units (ICL) as XB crosslinkers (Fig. 6). Whereas BMP alone revealed healing at 100 °C within 3.5 h, complex BMP-ICL showed the same performance with a 10-fold increased hardness.60

Gels are an important class of soft materials but, since the work of Steed in 2013, halogen bonded gels have been scarcely reported in the literature.61 The gelation properties of p-functionalized Fmoc phenylalanines (Fmoc-4-X-Phe, with X = H, F, Cl, Br and I) were recently investigated through fibrillation kinetic measurements using UV-Vis absorbance of diluted solutions (0.1 mM, 5% DMSO in PBS) (Fig. 6). The fibrillar growth appeared faster for the iodo derivative compared to the bromo, and the minimum gelation concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 3.0 mM followed halogen polarizabilities (I > Br > Cl > F). Further gel–sol transition analyses gave temperatures ranging from 58 °C for Fmoc-4-H-Phe to 105 °C for Fmoc-4-I-Phe, confirming the propensity of halogen bonds to promote hydrogel formation.62 Another approach addressed the formation of photoresponsive supramolecular gels: the azopyridine Azopy-C10 and the azobenzene derivative BTFIPD formed a supramolecular complex due to I⋯N halogen bonds with a gelation behaviour upon cooling of a THF solution in the dark (Fig. 6). Then, the photoresponsiveness of the BTFIPD/Azopy-C10-BTFIPD complex was demonstrated upon green (trans to cis isomerization) and blue (recovery of the trans configuration) light irradiation. The gel dependent isomerization showed gel collapses upon green light irradiation but the absence of reverse sol–gel transition was attributed to the greater solubility in THF of the cisBTFIPD isomer. Whereas FT-IR and Raman highlighted the persistence of halogen bonds before and after irradiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a change of morphology from narrow flakes to broad sheets.63
Catalysis in controlled polymerization reaction
The first use of XB for the synthesis of polymers has concerned the controlled ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide.64 Goto and Kaji then focused on living radical polymerization involving the reversible generation of radical species R˙. By comparison with the typical atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) exploiting alkyl halides (R–X with X = Cl, Br, in general) and copper(I) as catalyst,65 here 2-cyanopropyl iodide (CPI) is used in the presence of an organic salt (Bu3MeP+I−, Bu4N+I−, or ethylmethyl imidazolium iodide) as catalyst (Fig. 7). The R–I⋯I− halogen bonds were able to promote the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) to give the corresponding PMMA with Mn and PDI in the range 7700–140000 g mol−1 and 1.13–1.37, respectively. This method also allowed butyl acrylate to polymerize with an Mn up to 11000 g mol−1 and low dispersity (PDI = 1.39), and to prepare copolymers of methacrylates and acrylates.66 The pseudohalide azide anion (N3−), thiocyanate (−SCN) and cyanate (−OCN) were also endowed with the ability to reversibly generate R˙ species. In toluene, polymerization of MMA occurred in bulk in the presence of 18-crown-6 ether for the dissolution of NaN3. The resulting PMMA was obtained with Mn and PDI in the range of 7300–42000 g mol−1 and 1.15–1.70, respectively, and with a conversion up to 91%. Even more remarkable, a one pot procedure allowed for the polymerization reaction in toluene, which was followed by a chain end transformation from I to N3 after the addition of DMF. Post-functionalization was therefore possible through the azide–alkyne cycloaddition that allowed formation of diblock copolymers. This method was subsequently applied to the preparation and post-modification of polymer brushes on surface.67 Ionic pyridine N-oxide (PO) catalysts were also developed and evaluated under thermal and photoirradiation conditions. Polymerization of MMA as a model system in the presence of I2 highlighted higher catalytic activity for molecules having strong electron donating groups like Me2N-PO, PRD-PO and PPD-PO due to enhanced I⋯O− XB strength (Fig. 7). Using PPD-PO as catalyst under LED irradiation (380–550 nm) at room temperature, the reaction appeared to be even more efficient and resulted in Mn up to 28000 g mol−1 with PDI as low as 1.09. In these conditions, the authors demonstrated very good iodide chain-end fidelity.68

From these results, the XB-based reversible chain transfer catalyzed polymerization (RTCP) allowed for the preparation of (block co)-polymers in a controlled fashion with a wide range of functionalities such as styrene (St), acrylonitrile (AN), and methacrylates functionalized with butyl (BMA), benzyl (BzMA), epoxide (GMA), poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEGMA), hydroxyl (HEMA), and dimethylamino (DMAEMA) groups. In contrast to typical conditions for ATRP or RAFT, the XB catalytic systems appear inexpensive or environmentally friendly. Further innovations may be considered in the field of sequenced-controlled polymerization.69
Electronic materials
Perovskite-based solar cells
Perovskite solar cells (CH3NH3PbX3 with X = I−, Br−, Cl−) show great promise to convert sunlight to electricity at low cost and high efficiency. Enhancement of cell performance remains possible considering the trapping of positive charges at the perovskite p-type hole-conductor heterojunction by undercoordinated halide ions. To prevent this, iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) was used to coat the perovskite crystal surface, aiming at screening the electrostatic charges from halide ions. Solid state 13C and 19F NMR confirmed the presence of I⋯X− halogen bonds and, upon IPFB treatment of the meso-superstructured solar cell, the recombination rate constant (1/τrec) was reduced by three and the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 13% to 15.7%.70 New CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells were then prepared with the objective to reduce intrinsic traps, using C4H8I2 and C4F8I2 as XB donor additives. SEM shows that the additive-processed films were highly compact and homogeneous. Starting from a PCE of 17.5% for the reference cell, the addition of 3% (mass ratio) of C4H8I2 or C4F8I2 allowed to boost the performance to 18.5% and 20.1%, respectively. A comparison of the reference system and the C4F8I2-based device explained these variations: the trap density (nt) dropped from 7.6 × 1014 cm−3 (reference cell) to 5.5 × 1014 cm−3 (with C4F8I2) while the carrier mobility of holes (μh) and electrons (μe) increased from 3.83 × 10−2 and 5.45 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (reference cell) to 1.04 × 10−1 and 1.11 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (with C4F8I2), respectively. These additives also preserved the device performance over a longer period of time.71
Organic semiconductors
Naphthalene diimides (NDIs) and perylene diimide (PDI) belong to a family of popular building blocks for constructing n-type OSCs for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).72 Octabromination of the perylene tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (Br8PDA) and the corresponding perylene diimides (Br8PDIa-e) was evaluated for its effects on their electrochemical, optical and electron mobility properties (Fig. 8). X-ray structures of Br8PDA and Br8PDIa revealed the presence of Br⋯O halogen bonds that impacted the properties of the materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) of Br8PDA and Br8PDIa-e indeed showed a reversible stepwise two-electron reduction process with a dramatic shift of the reduction potentials in the positive direction, while UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra were red-shifted. The XB interaction provided high air-stability to Br8PDA, and an electron mobility of about 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a persistent radical anion form for Br8PDIa.73 With the aim to control the microstructure and thin film morphology, an XB-based NDI-DTYM2 derivative was self-assembled with 2,2-dipyridine and 2,2-bipyrimidine due to I⋯N interactions (Fig. 8). After verification of the formation of halogen bonds in the solid state by spectroscopic methods, OFET devices were constructed using pure NDI-DTYM2, NDI-DTYM2/2,2-dipyridine and NDI-DTYM2/2,2-bipyrimidine complexes. This resulted in an increased electron mobility from 0.027 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.070 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.053 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.74 Several research groups also turned their attention to the influence of XB on the supramolecular organization and photophysical properties of organo-electronic building blocks like thiophenes,75 furans76 and isoindigo derivatives.77

Fluorination of conjugated polymers can affect HOMO/LUMO energy levels, optical properties and intermolecular interactions, leading to improved performance for organic electronic devices when compared to their hydrogenated analogues.78 The use of XB as the driving force has been scarcely reported in the literature,79 however, XB is expected to control supramolecular organization in addition to other physical phenomenon like electronic coupling.
Sensing systems
Iodine capture
With the development of nuclear energy for electricity generation, the production of radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants has become a major issue with high hazardous risks to the environment and human health. Among these pollutants, radioactive iodine isotopes (125/129/131I) are highly volatile and can cause various diseases and thyroid cancer. Among materials behaving as iodine adsorbent, ionic liquids (ILs) are of interest as non-flammable adsorbent materials with negligible vapour pressure. Yan and Mu studied the I2 removal efficiency of ILs derived from 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium (Bmim) with various anions (Fig. 9). Bmim ILs with AcO−, Cl−, TfO−, I− and Br− could remove 84 to 96% of the iodine content of a cyclohexane solution, through I2⋯X− halogen bonds, while the NO3−, Tf2N−, PF6−, ClO4− and BF4− counterions were much less effective (3–39%). UV-Vis spectroscopy confirmed the formation of halogen bonded complexes with disappearance of the I2-specific adsorption band at 509 nm in the presence of AcO−, Cl−, TfO−, I− and Br−.80 Another work consisted in the association of BmimAcO/DMSO mixture (mass ratio 1:1) with amino acids (lysine, serine, glycine, proline, glutamine, alanine, and histidine) and biomass-based compounds (cellulose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, cyclodextrin, starch, chitosan, chitin, lignin). After 5 h, the uptake efficiency was in the range of 78–92% both for amino acids and biomass molecules, with a maximum obtained for proline and glucose.81 Another approach has consisted in the chelation of a cation leaving a naked anion as a boosted halogen bond acceptor.82,83

PEGylated quasi-ionic liquid systems, namely a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG200, PEG400, PEG600 and PEG4000) and an inorganic salt, were also evaluated as iodine adsorbers in cyclohexane. While environment benign PEG solvents could adsorb up to 60% of iodine in 10 h, the combination of PEG200 with NaI, NaBr or NaSCN (5% mass ratio) could reach more than 80% of efficiency in 3 h. The addition of solvents such as DMSO, DMF, BmimAcO or BmimBF4 (mass ratio solvent to Na*/PEG200 was 1:1) could improve the capture up to 89%.84
Attention was also given to I2 capture in the gas phase. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) associated with low-cost triphenylphosphine oxide/sulfide/selenide (TPPX, X = O, S or Se), reached I2 equilibrium loading capacities in the range of 1.22–1.37 g g−1 in 3 h at 90 °C, POSS-TPPO showing best reusability for I2 uptake after regeneration with ethanol (Fig. 9). Several analytical techniques were used to characterize both the interaction and the type of iodinated species and among them, 31P MAS NMR highlighted a chemical shift variation consistent with electron donation from POSS-TPPX to iodine. RAMAN spectroscopy then demonstrated the nature of iodine species that included I3− and I5− anions (Fig. 9).85
Finally, a metal–organic framework (MOF) based on PCN-333(Al) was designed with an ionic liquid (BmimBr) to provide the IL@PCN-333(Al) composite (Fig. 10). The adsorption capacities measured for iodine vapor and iodine–hexane solution were 7.35 g g−1 and 3.4 g g−1, respectively. After washing the I2-loaded-IL@PCN-333(Al) materials with hexane, the adsorber was recovered in white state, confirming the recyclability of the material. XPS and Raman indicated the generation of polyiodide species [I2nBr]− and therefore the formation of I2⋯Br− interactions.86

Catch/release/degradation of compounds
Organoiodine compounds possess a wide scope of applications ranging from biological, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries.87 However, their presence in drinking water can induce adverse health effects requiring the development of selective adsorbents. A series of hydrogel microspheres composed of poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate (pMEA), poly(2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate) (pET2A) or poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate) (pME2A) were evaluated to catch and release the halogen dyes eosin Y (EoY), erythrosine (Ery), phloxine B (PhB), and rose bengal (RB), and the non-halogen dyes orange II (OrII) and tartrazine (Ttz) (Fig. 11). The best adsorption capacity (Qm) was observed for pMEA with values spanning from 131 to 311 mg g−1 for EoY, Ery, PhB, and RB. Then, a competitive experiment showed very high selectivity of pET2A microspheres (0.1 wt%) for RG (adsorption rate ∼91% at 1 mM) compared to iodine-free EoY, OrII, and Ttz (adsorption rate <10% at 1 mM). Finally, around 80% of RG was released from thermoresponsive pME2A microgel at 50–70 °C whereas it remained strongly bound to pET2A under the same conditions.88 Organophosphate-based chemical warfare agents (CWAs) is a potential danger for populations despite their prohibited use. Zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can degrade nerve agents by hydrolysis and halogenated UiO-66 derivatives (UiO-66-F, UiO-66-Cl, UiO-66-Br, and UiO-66-I) were compared to the parent MOF (UiO-66) for the degradation of dimethyl-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP). UiO-66-I was four times more active than the reference UiO-66. Calculations and further tests using UiO-66-I50% (with 50% of iodinated ligands) confirmed the correlation between the catalytic activity and the presence of XB donors.89

In addition to these applications, we can also note the use of ionic liquids for catch and controlled release of perfluoroiodobutane under thermal treatment. The halogen bonds appeared the strongest with acetate counteranions, as observed by 19F NMR.90
Electronic gas sensors
The ability to detect and discriminate volatile organic compounds in a fast and reliable manner is emerging in the development of gas sensors.91 Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)-based sensors were engineered using haloaromatic compounds for gas-phase detection. Pristine SWCNTs and aryl halides were ball-milled and compressed into pellets followed by abrasion between gold electrodes on paper. The 1,4-diiodobenzene (DIB)-based composite was able to detect down to 3 ppm of pyridine while the dichloro- and dibromo-analogues needed 25 ppm. Other XB-based sensing materials using 3-iododurene (3ID) and 1,4-didodecyl-2,5-diiodobenzene (DDD) could respond to pyridine at a 1 ppm concentration and 3ID also produced a weak signal to hexane and benzene (Fig. 12). Surprisingly, the excellent halogen bond donor 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (DIFB) was less efficient than others.92
 Fig. 12  Structures of compounds involved in electronic gas sensors. 
A similar SWCNTs-based device aimed at detecting compounds related to explosives such as cyclohexanone (CH), a side product of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX) and dimethyl-dinitro-butane (DMNB), a taggant of composition 4 (C-4), Semtex, and Detasheet (Fig. 11 and 12). Both 1,4-diiodobenzene and 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene-embedding materials gave the largest responses with almost identical values and using DIFB as an XB sensor, 25, 50, or 75% of CH vapor (diluted with N2) induced conductive changes (ΔG/G) of 5.36 (±0.21), 9.17 (±0.22) or 12.24 (±0.54)%, respectively (Fig. 13). Poor volatility of DMNB required its dissolution in acetonitrile but this was sufficient to promote a significant change of ΔG/G values for acetonitrile vapor (2.78 (±0.34)%) vs.DMNB saturated acetonitrile vapor (3.77 (±0.45)%) (Fig. 13).93

Similarly, a cyclic conjugated organic semiconductor based on the association of diphenyl perylene diimides (PDIs) and brominated bithiophenes (PDI-BrBT) was designed as an OFET sensing device (Fig. 14). The capsule structure could self-assemble into thin films due to Br⋯PDI halogen bonds, which was not the case for non-brominated analogues (PDI-BT). XB hence allowed to confer an electron mobility of ∼1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 to PDI-BrBT, 20 times higher than that of PDI-BT. When the hollow organic film was in contact with chemical vapours, the device responded through changes in the drain current. A wide variety of molecules (ketones, alcohols, nitriles) could be accommodated within the cavity (∼415 Å3), and hydrocarbons having similar structures (n-hexane, 1-hexyne or 3-hexyne) could be distinguished from one another.94

Other options were developed to organize/catch species on a substrate coated with a self-assembled monolayer, as recently disclosed with gold nanoparticles.95,96 To the best of our knowledge, halogen bonded polymer brushes have not been studied thus far. The association of XB groups combined with the tuning of the Sigma hole could give rise to stimuli responsive materials endowed with catch and release properties.97
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques are powerful tools that can be used as electrochemical sensing devices to measure the concentration of varied species. In 2014, Schöllhorn and coworkers probed and controlled the formation of XB by switching the redox capacity of different scaffolds (TCQ, DDQ and TCNQ, Fig. 16) in the presence of a hundred equivalents of (perfluorinated) aliphatic and aromatic XB donors (see Fig. 15 for structures). In the case of TCQ (0.5 mM in 0.1 M TBAPF6–acetonitrile), the CV experiments revealed that XB was directly related to the redox state of TCQ, which was enabled (“switch-on”) in the reduced di-anionic state (TCQ2−), and disabled (“switch-off”) in radical anion (TCQ˙−) or neutral states. As expected, the formal potential shifts ΔE°′ appeared stronger for halo-perfluorocarbons compared to their non-fluorinated homologues, and followed the XB donor strength: I > Br > Cl (Fig. 15).98
 Fig. 15  Formal potential shifts ΔE°′ of the redox couple TCQ˙−/TCQ2− ([TCQ] = 0.5 mM) in the presence of 100 equivalents (50 mM) of perfluorinated and non-fluorinated XB donors in 0.1 M TBAPF6–acetonitrile: X-Rf (1-halo-perfluoro-n-hexane), X-Rh (1-halo-n-hexane), X-Arf (halopentafluorobenzene), X-Arh (halo-benzene).

 Fig. 16  Structures of compounds involved in tetrathiafulvalene-based electrochemical sensors. 
Tetrathiafulvalene based electrochemical sensors
Tetrathiafulvalenes and analogues are frequently employed as redox probes due to their electrochemical properties and their assembling by XB has already been the subject of intense research.99 Here, the oxidation of iodo-tetrathiafulvalene (I-TTF) resulted in two reversible redox states, i.e. the monocation and dication species I-TTF+ and I-TTF2+, respectively (Fig. 16). Upon addition of increasing amounts of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl), cyclic voltammograms of I-TTF showed a shift of reversible oxidation waves towards smaller and more cathodic potentials due to I⋯Cl− halogen bonds. Although smaller than for chloride, a similar potential shift of I-TTF was observed with bromide anions while none was seen with nitrate, triflate and perchlorate.100 Further experiments performed with iodo-trimethyltetrathiafulvalene (I-Me3TTF) highlighted a very weak influence of electrolytes, solvents and electrode materials on the thermodynamic data with a detection limit of 5 × 10−4 M for various anions (Fig. 16).101 Finally, a self-assembled monolayer on a gold electrode was created using a diiodo-tetrathiafulvalene (2I-TTF) linked to thioctic acid (Fig. 16). Upon oxidation of 2I-TTF species, CV allowed to determine that chloride anions interacted strongly with the substrate, the authors estimating the limit of detection at 6 × 10−6 M. The reversible character of the process could provide a selective catch and release strategy for anionic species.102
Ferrocene based electrochemical sensors
Ferrocene is an electroactive compound that has found applications in sensing devices.103 Beer and co-workers designed XB redox-active ferrocene receptors. From a structural point, molecules 1.XB, 2.XB and 3.XB were comprised of a ferrocene unit appended to two iodotriazole/iodotriazolium moieties (Fig. 18). The anion recognition properties were first evaluated by 1H-NMR titration in acetonitrile/D2O 9:1 using TBACl and TBABr. It came out that 1.XB and 3.XB interacted strongly with both chloride (∼ 300 Ka M−1) and bromide (∼ 1100 Ka M−1) anions although no binding was observed for 2.XB. The subsequent electrochemical anion sensing properties were studied by CV in acetonitrile with 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the electrolyte and ten equivalents of halide salts. Only 1.XB and 2.XB observed cathodic shifts of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couples (ΔE1/2/mV), with values of about −30 and −18 mV for chloride and bromide salts, respectively (Fig. 17).104

In all spectra, the CVs at 0 and 10 equivalents of halide are represented by the black and red curves respectively (potentials compared to the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode).

 Fig. 18  Structures of compounds involving ferrocene-based electrochemical sensors. 
Another substrate (TFBI) comprising three ferrocene units was investigated in a 1:1 CH2Cl2/CH3CN mixture with TBAPF6 (0.15 M) as the electrolyte towards AcO−, H2PO4−, HP2O73−, SO42−, F−, Cl−, Br−, NO3− and HSO4− anions through Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry (OSWV) (Fig. 18). Only AcO−, H2PO4−, HP2O73− and SO42− induced a significant response on the redox peaks of the triferrocene–bis(iodotriazole) receptor TFBI. Regarding the TFBI/SO42− complex, additional 1H-NMR titration data revealed association constants of about 7000 M−1 and a stoichiometry of 2:1.105
After investigation of the redox-active [2]rotaxanes combining hydrogen- and halogen-bonding,106 another interlocked system ROTAXB was engineered with four iodotriazole units and an electroactive ferrocene moiety (Fig. 18). When ROTAXB was challenged with Cl−, Br−, I−, SCN− and SO42− anions in an aqueous solvent mixture of CD3CN/d6-acetone/D2O 45:45:10, the strongest interaction was obtained with the iodide anion, resulting in an association constant of 1125 M−1, as determined by 1H-NMR titration. As far as the redox sensing property is concerned, experiments performed by square-wave voltammetry in the same conditions provided cathodic shifts of −11, −21 and −4 mV in the presence of 150 equivalents of Cl−, Br− and SCN−, respectively. It is noteworthy that this system was found to be Br− sensitive over Cl− in the presence of water.107 Finally, we can mention other studies aiming at carrying out the anion recognition through redox-active molecules, such as a dicationic diquat DIQUAT108 and a N-n-hexyl-N′-(iodo-tetrafluorophenyl)-viologen PV2+-C6F4I (Fig. 18).109
Perspectives
XB-mediated materials and applications have seen an unprecedented development in the past years and there is more to come. Chemists are creating novel structures and functions by taking advantage of the high tunability, directionality and hydrophobicity of XB.
Experimental and theoretical understandings of the interaction has also expanded and this knowledge has been critical to advance the field and develop new avenues, such as biological and medicinal applications. The fact that nature employed iodine and XB for thyroid hormones, which bind selectively to their targets through XB, shows the potential and selectivity that a single atom substitution by a heavy halogen can bring to the physiology and pharmacology of small molecules.40,110
In the fields of electronic devices and nanocomposites,111 carbon nanotubes and graphenes are of particular relevance due to their unique intrinsic properties.112 The combination of nanofillers, ionic species and XB donors might also be possible for self-assembling objects with low affinity.113,114 Another aspect concerns the modulation of the Sigma hole size through internal or external stimuli, as shown in the electrochemistry section. A recent work described a pH responsive molecule that forms a dimeric system in solution through protonation,115 and such strategies can pave the way to new inventions.
This short review on the recent developments of halogen-bonded systems and applications thus highlighted some of the exciting possibilities that this singular non-covalent interaction can bring to the chemical world.
