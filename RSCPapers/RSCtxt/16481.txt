    , Accepted 27th January 2020First published on 27th January 2020AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising materials in the areas of gas storage, magnetism, luminescence, and catalysis owing to their superior property of having highly crystalline structures. However, MOF stability toward heat or humidity is considerably less as compared to carbons because they are constructed from the assembly of ligands with metal ions or clusters via coordination bonds. Transforming MOFs into carbons is bringing the novel potential for MOFs to achieve industrialization, and carbons with controlled pore sizes and surface doping are one of the most important porous materials. By selecting MOFs as a precursor or template, carbons with heteroatom doping and well-developed pores can be achieved. In this review, we discussed the state-of-art study progress made in the new development of MOF-derived metal-free porous carbons. In particular, the potential use of metal-free carbons from environmental and energy perspectives, such as adsorption, supercapacitors, and catalysts, were analyzed in detail. Moreover, an outlook for the sustainable development of MOF-derived porous carbons in the future was also presented.
1. Introduction
Conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas still comprise the primary energy resource for the world's energy frameworks.1 Pollution and energy shortage from the exhaustive use of fossil fuels are two key issues affecting human life because of accelerating industrialization.2–4 In response to these issues, developing green technology for efficient energy storage has become an attractive proposition.5 Currently, most of the research efforts have been focused upon storage devices (supercapacitor),6 batteries (Li batteries),7 and energy production systems (fuel cell).8–10 Electrochemical storage is truly one of the most promising methods for energy storage even if the optimization of electrodes usually needs systematic procedures to ensure maximum efficiency.11–13 In addition, the combustion of fossil fuels has a critical role in CO2 emissions in the atmosphere; therefore, searching for new materials for CO2 capture as well as alternative clean energy (e.g., H2) for the proposed H2 economy has aroused wide interest.14–17 Industrialization has also caused severe pollution of water owing to the discharge of untreated sanitary and toxic wastes.18,19 In particular, pollution from metals or dyes in water systems has become a great concern toward public health because they are nonbiodegradable; further, heavy metals even tend to accumulate in the environment.20 To accomplish such targets, key aspects involve the design of new materials as electrodes, catalysts, or adsorbents with controllable pore structures and functional groups to provide sufficient active sites in addition to achieving low-cost mass-scale production. Among the various reported materials, porous carbons are one of the most studied classes in the abovementioned important research areas as electrode materials for supercapacitors; catalysts for oxygen reduction or hydrogen evolution reactions in fuel cells; or adsorbents for CO2 capture, H2 and CH4 storage, and wastewater treatment. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to declare that porous carbons are indispensable in our modern scientific society.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as hybrid solids obtained from organic–inorganic building blocks, have captured tremendous attention in gas storage and separation as well as energy storage because of their highly crystalline structure.21–23 Almost 30000 kinds of MOFs have been reported with different geometries and sizes, which have been conceptualized as points, lines, polygons, or polyhedra via interactions between the metal ions and organic ligands.24,25 Carboxylate- and pyridyl-based compounds comprise the most studied ligands within the family of MOFs; other ligands such as phosphonate, sulfonate, imidazolate, and porphyrin have also been reported for MOFs, which have been reviewed in many important articles.25–32 The surface areas of MOFs can range from 0 to 10000 m2 g−1, largely exceeding those of traditional porous materials such as zeolites and activated carbons, endowing them to become potential candidates for gas storage of fuel (H2 and CH4), CO2 capture, catalysis, sensors, and drug delivery.33 This makes them some of the most interesting families of porous materials. MOFs comprise abundant intrinsic molecular metal sites, high surface areas, ordered pores, and chemical stability; they can act as a suitable source to obtain carbons,34 particularly carbons with intrinsic N-doping from in situ carbonization. Importantly, the morphology and functionalization of MOFs can be modulated based on the needs of specific applications by the adjustment of metal salts and ligands.26–28 More detailed discussions on the chemistry and application of MOFs can be found in recent reviews.29–31 However, it should be noted that the stability of MOFs toward heat and humidity is usually inferior than those observed in carbon materials, and the construction of MOF-derived carbons is now bringing new potential for the family of MOFs to reach industrialization.
Recently, growing bodies of evidence have indicated that MOF-derived carbons have promising potential in the fields of energy and environment cleaning.35–37 MOFs are regarded to be suitable precursors for carbons due to their periodic structure, high surface areas, and abundant C-species in the ligands. In general, temperature, components of metals or ligands in MOFs, loading contents of organics, and post-modification are major factors that affect the pore structure and surface-doping chemistry of MOF-derived carbons.38–46 Heteroatoms are prone to be homogeneously distributed in carbons because of in situ carbonization due to the regular arrangement of heteroatom-containing ligands in MOFs.47 Recently, vast advancements have been achieved in MOF-derived carbons, and it was not until very recently that their potential applications in energy storage and tackling environmental pollution drew considerable attention with regard to supercapacitors, gas storage, and water treatment. Although several reviews on MOFs and their derivatives, such as carbons, metal oxides, and composites, have been reported with emphasis on the preparation, structure, and potential applications,34,38–45,48–50 few dedicated analyses have solely focused on MOF-derived metal-free carbons as the active centers. When compared with other carbons such as activated carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene, MOF-derived carbons show at least the following two merits: (a) their pores and shapes can be easily controlled by MOF precursors; (b) heteroatoms can be easily doped with a controllable configuration by the selected linkers for MOFs and carbonization conditions.51 It should be pointed out that the production cost of MOF-derived carbons is higher than those of carbons derived using conventional methods, while the amazing controllable particle sizes and shapes of the carbons would compensate for the aspects involving production cost and environmental friendliness. Therefore, it is essential to formulate a generic review from these dispersed references to provide collective enriched information for practical applications. This review discusses the preparation methods of MOF-derived metal-free carbons and summarizes the progress made in their applications as active centers in emerging energy and environmental areas, i.e., gas storage and separation, supercapacitor, catalysis, capacitive deionization, and removal of dyes in aqueous systems. Moreover, an outlook for the future sustainable development of MOF-derived metal-free carbons is also provided, and we hope to gather these scattered data, highlight the main hurdles, and provide newer insights into MOF-derived carbons in energy and environment-related fields.
2. Preparation of MOF-derived carbons
MOF-derived carbons may broaden the library of carbons with new pore structures and morphologies similar to the parent MOFs, showing high flexibility with the selection of MOFs. The cavities in MOFs can provide channels that can be accessed by small organics, showing their potential use as a precursor or template for carbons. Before the utilization of MOFs, carbons were usually obtained by the carbonization and activation using various biomasses and polymers as the precursors,14,52–54 in addition to the nanocasting method.55–57 Such as-made carbons exhibited high performance as compared to commercially available activated carbons, particularly for carbons with ordered pores that were obtained from the nanocasting template route. As an alternative route to template methods, carbons from a variety of MOFs showed several advantages such as large surface areas, controlled pore sizes, morphology, and automatically functionalized with heteroatoms or metal/metal oxide particles in the network as compared to that of carbons obtained via routine synthesis. Transforming MOFs into carbons was also actually a template procedure that did not require etching as compared to the classical nanocasting route.58 On account of these advantages, a large number of related studies have been reported on the preparation of MOF-derived carbons from the selection of suitable MOF precursors, carbonization atmosphere and temperature, use of a secondary source, and further post-modification, as well as their potential applications in various areas such as energy storage and conversion, environmental remediation, or even acting as a support for single-atom catalysts.34,50 In general, there are mainly three methods for fabricating MOF-derived carbons: (a) direct carbonization of a single MOF precursor; (b) carbonization of a mixture of MOFs and another additional source; (c) posttreatment of carbons, i.e., KOH activation. The schematic for fabricating MOF-derived carbons is shown in Fig. 1, and all the development on the synthesis procedures, structure, and properties of carbons are also discussed in detail. It is not difficult to understand that the characteristics of MOF-derived carbons would be highly reliant on the preparation strategies.

2.1 Direct carbonization of original MOFs
MOFs have definitely proven to be worthwhile precursors for carbons because the organic ligands in MOFs comprise higher C-species contents,35 and carbonization was also favorable due to the inferior stability of certain MOFs in a moisture-laden environment.59 The first example involving this approach was achieved for obtaining MOF-5,60 and the carbons (MC) obtained at 900 °C had a surface area of 1812 m2 g−1. Many studies have confirmed that crystalline MOFs can reorganize into aggregates and retain the cubic morphology in carbons.61–66 For instance, Srinivas et al.65 reported hierarchical carbons from MOF-5 with a surface area of 2734 m2 g−1 and high pore volume of 5.23 cm3 g−1 when millimeter-sized MOF-5 was carbonized at 1100 °C, even up to 5.53 cm3 g−1 when carbonized at 1000 °C. Significantly, the carbons always showed higher surface areas as compared to the carbons obtained from micron-sized MOF-5. Micropores in hierarchical carbons were mostly retained, and portions of the meso- and macropores were generated from defects in MOFs due to structural inheritance. A possible mechanism for MOF carbonization is shown in Fig. 2. Apart from MOF-5, Zn-based MOFs using imidazole as the ligands (ZIFs) were also often used as precursors,67–70 and the groups on ligands would largely affect the shape of carbons, although high similarity existed in the crystallography of MOFs.68 Yamauchi et al.69 reported carbons from a commercial ZIF-8 followed by acid treatment, where the carbons obtained at 600 °C exhibited a surface area of only 24 m2 g−1 close to nonporous structures. Interestingly, the carbons carbonized at 600 °C without acid treatment were significant in the N2 isotherm with a surface area of 790 m2 g−1, indicating that the temperature of 600 °C was insufficient to form carbons, and the pores would collapse after the removal of inorganic residuals. The carbons had a surface area of 1100 m2 g−1 for temperatures up to 1000 °C, exhibiting enlarged pore sizes with an increase in the carbonization temperature, as shown in Fig. 3. They also obtained carbons from ZIF-8 made in the nanocrystals,71 yielding shapes similar to those of ZIF-8 with sizes ranging from the nano- to micrometer scale (Fig. 4). The regulation effect on the size was also observed by another group.67,70,72 The relationship between the morphology of MOFs and carbons was unraveled by Cao et al.73 using ZIF-7 as the matrix with varied morphologies of spheres, rods, or polyhedra. After carbonization at 800 °C, the rod shape of ZIF-7 was retained in the carbons (NC-R-800), while the spherical particles of ZIF-7 were connected to form carbons (NC-S-800). Further, NC-D-800 from polyhedral ZIF-7 was formed by partially interlinked particles. Overall, Zn-based MOFs are suitable precursors for carbons with varied shapes and porosities that were highly dependent on the MOFs precursor: the decomposition behaviors and Zn species removal for temperatures as high as 900 °C could be attributed to the low boiling point of carbon-reduced Zn species (∼907 °C).74–76 When using temperatures lower than the boiling point of Zn or using other MOFs as the precursor with higher boiling points than that of Zn (such as Fe, Co, Ni, Al, Cu, etc.), acid treatment was needed to obtain metal-free carbons.77 For instance, Yamauchi et al.78 reported carbons from Al-PCP with a surface area of 5000 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 4.3 cm3 g−1, and the morphology and porosity of the carbons would be highly affected by the pretreatment of MOFs (e.g., NH2 decoration or Cu2+ loading) before carbonization.79–81 Metal–organic gel (MOG)—an extended structure of MOFs—was also applied to obtain carbons.82 Although carbons with colorful architectures have been reported from MOFs,67–70 most studies have failed to provide full information on the variation of MOFs. A mechanism has been recently proposed by Gadipelli et al.83 using ZIF-8 by the simultaneous TG-MS technique, as shown in Fig. 5. The carbons had a marked dependence of surface doping and porosity on temperature, where N-doped Zn-decorated carbons were obtained at 600–800 °C; any further increase in temperature resulted in enhanced porosity at the expense of carbon yield and the introduction of N- and Zn-species. A considerable mass loss was observed in isothermal carbonization with one-, two-, and three-step decompositions of ligands, but no further loss was observed for the carbons remaining at 600 °C up to 7 h (Fig. 5). A clear conversion of Zn centers to crystalline ZnO also occurred at this stage. A sharp loss was observed above 900 °C due to the simultaneous reduction of ZnO with carbon, and the release of Zn vapor and ligands in the form of CO or CO2 that is analogous to physical activation,61 yielding metal-free carbons with a surface area of 1222 m2 g−1. Similar to most types of MOFs with pores in the skeleton, porous aromatic framework (PAFs), porous organic polymers (POPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were also frequently applied as the precursors for carbons.84–86 The carbons obtained from these precursors also had an enlarged pore volume as compared to the parent porous materials; further, significant acid treatment was not required because of the absence of metal components in the frameworks.

This approach is also suitable for MOFs without pores in the skeleton for carbons.87–90 For instance, Liang et al.91 reported carbons (900 °C) with a surface area of 720 m2 g−1 from a triply interpenetrated nonporous MOFs ([Zn2(TPT)(BDC)2]·H2O). Carbons with a surface area of 1671 m2 g−1 were also obtained from nonpermanent porous MOFs ([Zn3(BTC)2·(H2O)3]n),92 where MOFs as the isostructure of HKUST were highly porous originally, but the skeleton collapsed during activation.93 To understand the relationship between the pore structure and nonporous MOFs, Kurungot et al.88 performed detailed studies on carbons from several Zn-based nonporous MOFs constructed by ligands with different properties (flexible linkers, i.e., 1,3-ADA, or rigid linkers, i.e., benzene derivatives such as 1,3,5-BTC and 2,6-NDC), as shown in Fig. 6. A linear relationship was observed between the Zn/C ratio of MOFs and the surface areas of carbons. Moreover, no hysteresis was observed in the N2 isotherms for carbons from nonporous MOFs (Fig. 6), while the carbons from MOF-5 had evident hysteresis, indicating the presence of some mesopores.14 The surface areas of the carbons obtained from MOFs with a rigid linker, i.e., MOF-5, MOF-2, and Zn-BTC, were 2184, 1378, and 1326 m2 g−1, respectively, while that for carbons obtained from MOFs with a flexible linker, i.e., Zn-PAA, was 495 m2 g−1. All the results indicated that the organic ligands would exert a large effect on the intrinsic properties of MOF-derived carbons, and MOFs with high surface areas and rigid linkers were believed to easily yield carbons with large surface areas as compared to the carbons obtained from nonporous MOFs with flexible ligands under the same conditions.

2.2 Carbonization of a mixture of MOFs and other sources
The carbons were also often obtained from the carbonization of MOFs and other sources because of broad pores with large cracks or voids in the as-made porous carbons from the insufficiency of carbon species and anisotropic shrinkage of MOFs. Furfuryl alcohol (FA) with dimensions of 0.84 × 0.64 × 0.43 nm3 is one of the most often used sources. FA can be introduced into MOFs by polymerization before carbonization; a scheme is shown in Fig. 7. Xu's group has undertaken several pioneering studies using this method for fabricating MOF-derived metal-free carbons,94 and the carbons with surface areas of 2872 and 217 m2 g−1 were obtained by carbonizing MOF-5 and FA at 1000 and 530 °C, respectively, constituting the first report for MOF-derived metal-free carbons obtained by this approach. FA was also introduced into MOF-5 by evaporation for the first time,95 where the carbons obtained at both 530 and 1000 °C had much larger surface areas as compared to the carbons obtained at 800 °C, which was different from the impregnation route to introduce FA.94 All the results indicated that the introduction method requiring an additional organic source would largely affect the porous parameters of the carbons. The carbonization of FA and nonporous Zn-BTC also yielded carbons with surface areas in the range of 518–1455 m2 g−1,96 and the presence of FA was reported to increase the yield of carbons depending on temperature. Other organic sources such as CCl4, glycerol, ethylenediamine, and phenolic resin were also used to substitute FA as the secondary source,60,97,98 confirming the feasibility of this method to prepare MOF-derived carbons. However, the carbons usually showed inferior morphology duplication as compared to the ones obtained from single MOF-5,61 partially due to the inferior stability of MOF-5 in humid environments. In general, ZIF-8 exhibits higher stability toward heat or humidity as compared to MOF-5. Xu et al.99 introduced FA into the pores of ZIF-8 by the evaporation route and carbonized at 1000 °C to obtain carbons (3405 m2 g−1), while the carbons from a commercial ZIF-8 using the same procedures yielded a surface area of 1131 m2 g−1.100 Banerjee et al.101 reported carbons from ZIF-68, ZIF-69, and ZIF-70 using FA as the secondary source to understand the effect of MOF precursors on the carbons, indicating that the shape, morphology, and porosity of the carbons were largely determined by the selection of MOF precursors. For instance, the carbonization of Al-PCP and FA also produced carbons in fibers (Fig. 8),102 confirming that the fibrous morphology was inherited from Al-PCP with a higher surface area of up to 513 m2 g−1 with an increase in FA loading. In fact, Cao et al.103–105 performed many pioneering studies involving the effect of other sources on MOF-derived carbons. For instance, they reported a series of carbons from a mixture of ZIF-8 and other sources, i.e., urea, glucose, ethylene glycol, glycerol, xylitol, melamine, and FA, where glucose was confirmed to be a promising secondary source because it could reduce the loss of N-species from the ZIFs by pre-melting and polymerization outside the ZIFs during carbonization.104

Recently, several different types of organics acting as modulators have also been widely used in fabricating MOFs and subsequently modulating the shape and porosity of carbons.106–109 For instance, Xu et al.110 used salicylic acid to modulate the growth of MOF-74 rods by the one-pot route followed by carbonization at 1000 °C to yield carbon rods (1559 m2 g−1), while the carbons prepared from MOF-74 without salicylic acid had no specific shape. We also reported the amino acid modulation of ZIF-8 and converted it into carbons at 1000 °C.111 Different from the one-pot route, Zou et al.107 proposed a pore-expansion strategy for carbons from ZIF-8, where 1H-1,2,3-triazole as the explosive component was mixed with ZIF-8. After carbonization at 900 °C, the as-made EZIF-C showed a foam-like structure with hierarchical micro-, meso-, and macropores. ZIF-8 particles were coated with tannic acid (TA) to obtain a core–shell composite, mediating the post-formation of H3BO3-polyol bonds after adding 1,4-benzenediboronicacid (BDBA) as the boron source.112 As a result, N,B-codoped hollow carbons with surface areas of up to 936 m2 g−1 were obtained from the carbonization of ZIF-8@TA/BDBA composites. Recently, N,P,S-tridoped hollow carbon shells were also obtained by the carbonization of polymer-coated ZIF-67 followed by acid washing,113 where poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4, 4′-sulfonyldiphenol) was used as the coating agent; the schematic is shown in Fig. 9. MOFs were also converted into hierarchical porous carbons with diatom-like structures through the inclusions of guests and high-temperature MOF–guest interactions,51 which were demonstrated to be feasible for common MOFs to produce carbons with tailored pores. For instance, the metallic salt guest of (NH4)2MoS4 was introduced into HKUST-1-type MOFs to obtain a family of carbon nano-diatoms with two to four levels of structural hierarchy by means of carbonization and acid washing, as shown in Fig. 10. The as-made carbons containing web- and fiber-like structures were formed by the cooperative Mo–Cu catalytic mechanism,51 where the Mo-species from the guest were firmly bound to the carbon and facilitated the scissoring of the formed carbon structures (i.e., cracking the C–C bond of organic compounds), and the accumulation of Cu on the surface disrupted the Cu/Mo ratio necessary for catalysis and inhibited the outward growth of the fibers. Therefore, both synthesis procedure and MOFs quality would largely affect the porosity and morphology of the obtained carbons. Moreover, monomers have also been widely used as the secondary source for carbons from this method.114–118 Sung et al.116 incorporated dopamine on the surface of ZIF-8 and converted it into carbons via carbonization at 800 °C, where the use of dopamine yielded sp2-hybridized carbons that could overcome the mass transport and low conductivity issues that are generally associated with sp3-hybridized carbons. The presence of organics would effectively disperse metals in the MOFs, providing carbons with uniformly distributed pores after removing these metal impurities. However, this method required a series of procedures including mixing, polymerization, and carbonization, making it time-consuming. Organics with heteroatoms such as N, S, P, and B have also been often used to obtain heteroatom-doped carbons,119–123 and ZIF-derived carbons did have N-species due to the advantages of ZIFs with N-enriched ligands, which can be varied from imidazole to its complex derivative and regulate the porosity of ZIFs.124 Yaghi et al.125 reported the modulations of ZIF-90, ZIF-91, and ZIF-92 by changing the linkers and regulated the porosity of carbons. However, the C–N bonds were easily broken during the carbonization process with limited N-species in the carbons. Scholars have started to search for other N-enriched organics to enhance the amount of N-species in carbons.113,121–123 For instance, Yamauchi et al.123 introduced dicyandiamide (DCDA) into Al-PCP and carbonized it at 600 °C to form nitride fibers with a surface area of 90 m2 g−1, constituting the first report for a new type of carbons obtainable from this approach. The surface areas of nitrides were close to the carbon nitrides reported from the classical template route,126 exhibiting randomly distributed mesopores in the entire area of the fibers. Liang et al.91 also reported carbons from the ternary mixture of [Zn2(TPT)(BDC)2]·H2O, DCDA, and FeCl3 at a ratio of 5:10:1, showing N-species content of up to 6.3 at% with bimodal pores in the structure. Xu et al.120 reported the impregnation of ionic liquids (ILs) into MIL-100 with an equal mass, using EMIM·DCN and EMIM·TCB as the N- and B,N-sources, respectively. The carbonization of MIL-100 yielded carbons (C800) with a surface area of 2731 m2 g−1 and NC800 had a surface area of 2397 m2 g−1. B,N-Codoping caused an additional decrease in the surface areas of BNC800-1 (1068 m2 g−1). By decreasing the EMIM·TCB loading, a surface area of 1525 m2 g−1 could be achieved with N-species concentration of 8.1 wt% for BNC800-2 due to the additional MIL-100 carbon contributions and IL confinement during carbonization. In particular, the value of 2397 m2 g−1 was among the highest for carbons obtained from ILs, and the value of 1525 m2 g−1 was also one of the best for B,N-codoped carbons that have been reported until now.

Moreover, some scholars have also reported metal-free carbons from two MOFs,127–131 or the composite of MOFs with different types of carbon materials, i.e., graphene, GO, and CNT.132–138 For instance, Wang et al.131 reported high-graphitic N-doped carbons from the direct carbonization of dual-metal ZIFs with different ratios of Co/Zn at 700 °C under a N2 atmosphere followed by acid washing. Lu et al.135 reported the direct growth of ZIF-8 on the CNT surface, and particle sizes of ZIF-8 could be controlled by the reaction conditions that subsequently affected the size of the carbons after carbonization; the schematic is shown in Fig. 11. After carbonization, CNT/NPC hybrids were obtained because of the high graphitization degree and hierarchical pores with morphology similar to those of the parent ZIF-8 and CNT.138 Moreover, CNTs could also be modified by dopamine to support the growth of ZIF-8, followed by carbonization to form carbons.136 The distribution of ZIF-8 on the CNT surface was adjusted by varying the age with the assistance of a dopamine coating. When GO was used as the support, strong interactions between metallic Zn from ZIF-8 and O-species from GO would make the composites have a random distribution of ZIF-8 with a large particle size due to heterogeneous nucleation and rapid growth; here, it was difficult to obtain carbon/graphene sheets with large surface areas via carbonization due to the uncontrollable shrinkage and agglomeration of graphene. The ZIF-8-layer-protected carbonization method was also applied to obtain carbon@graphene sandwiches,139 and a ZIF/GO/ZIF composite with ultrasmall ZIFs with 20 nm coating of GO was fabricated by homogenous nucleation followed by uniform deposition and confined growth, hindering the agglomeration of graphene during carbonization. As a result, the carbon nanosheets carbonized at 800 °C exhibited a high surface area of 1170 m2 g−1 with developed pores and good conductivity. N-Doped carbon@GO composite was also reported by in situ confinement carbonization,118 where monodispersed ZIF-8 polyhedra were used as the precursor under the assistance of PVP. It should be noted that graphene, GO, and CNT usually shared special electrical characteristics and therefore the as-made carbons were believed to be potential candidates in energy storage applications.

2.3 Posttreatment of MOF-derived carbons
With the in-depth development of MOF-derived carbons, many scholars have also used posttreatment to modify the pores and surface doping of carbons. Zou et al.68 reported KOH activation at 750 °C for carbons from ZIF-8 with a surface area of 2437 m2 g−1, showing over triple the enlargement as compared to that in the carbonization of ZIF-8 at 1000 °C. They also reported the KOH activation of carbons from Al-MOG, and no detectable macropores were observed for the carbons.82 Mokaya et al.100 reported the KOH activation of carbons from ZIF-8 and FA, where the carbonized samples showed surface areas in the range of 933–1131 m2 g−1 for carbonization at 900–1100 °C; the carbons activated at 700 °C yielded enhanced porosity between 30 and 240%. For instance, activated carbons (ACBF-900, 3200 m2 g−1) had the highest increase of 240% and the carbonized samples (BF-900) had a surface area of 933 m2 g−1. Xia et al.140 reported carbons from ZIF-8 when carbonized at 600–1000 °C followed by activation at 700 °C; these carbons showed largely increased surface areas but reduced N-species after activation. KOH activation appeared to be efficient in most cases in increasing the surface areas; sometimes, this activation would have a negative impact.60,110 For instance, Xu et al.110 reported the KOH activation of carbon rods from MOF-74 rods to form graphene ribbons (GNRibs) (Fig. 12), yielding surface areas of 1492 and 1559 m2 g−1 for GNRibs and carbon rods, respectively. The formation of new types of rod- and ribbon-shaped carbons indicated that the carbon structures could be controlled not only by the regulation of MOFs but also by the posttreatment applied. Thermal posttreatment with another organic source was also an excellent strategy to incorporate heteroatoms into carbons. Kurungot et al.141 reported carbons obtained from MOF-5 by carbonization at 1000 °C, followed by the impregnation of melamine into the pores of carbons and the subsequent carbonization at 600 °C to produce N-doped carbons. Macropores in the carbons served as N-reservoirs by the initial plugging of C3N4 units from the polymerization of melamine, and these carbons had a surface area of 765 m2 g−1 with N-species content of 7 wt% when carbonized at 900 °C. However, the direct carbonization of MOF-5 and melamine yielded carbons with N-species content of ∼1.2 wt%, and the ineffective N-doping was due to the rapid decomposition of C3N4 without sufficient stable N atoms in the pores of carbons. Further, NH3 was another good N-source for N-doped carbons through the deposition of N-species and diffusion into carbons during carbonization.73,142 Posttreatment was also confirmed to be efficient for MOF-derived carbons with S-doping properties.143–145 For instance, Zhang et al.144 reported the encapsulation of sulfur into carbon nanoplates from MOF-5 when carbonized at 900 °C, showing largely reduced surface areas from 1645 to 102 m2 g−1 after S-doping treatment.

3. Applications in energy and environmental fields
Developing new green technologies in energy storage has been widely discussed in the recent years,2,3 and carbon-based materials have focused on extensive concerns in this field owing to the intrinsic advantages such as large surface areas, good conductivity, superior stability, and adjustable surface-doping chemistry, in addition to lowered production costs. Significantly, doping heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S, P, and B) into carbons can cause a redistribution of electrons around the dopants,146 further improving the performance in most application scenarios. For instance, Sevilla et al.147 reported carbons with a surface area of ∼1260 m2 g−1 from the mild KOH activation of hydrothermal carbonized sawdust, while the carbons had an ultrahigh CO2 capacity of up to 4.8 mmol g−1 at 1 bar and 25 °C due to the presence of large numbers of narrow micropores (<1 nm), constituting the largest ever recorded CO2 uptake for any other type of activated carbons. Recently, large varieties of MOFs were converted into porous carbons with an extraordinary variability in shape, surface doping, and porosity, causing enhanced interest in MOF-derived carbons for multiple uses such as gas storage, supercapacitor, catalysis, and water treatment. MOF-derived metal-free carbons with the sp2-hybridized carbon configuration and controllable morphology can exert a positive influence on the interaction between the pores and adsorbates, yielding high performance toward specific applications. As discussed above, carbons with tunable pores and shapes largely depend on the MOF precursor and synthesis procedure. By tuning the composition or incorporating other organic components in these MOFs, the active sites for carbons can be modulated and enhanced, providing formidable advantages as compared to the carbons obtained from traditional methods. In this section, we summarize the fundamental multifaceted role of MOF-derived metal-free carbons and diverse applications in the emerging energy and environment-related systems.
3.1 Gas storage and separation
Gas storage mainly involved physisorption occurring on the surface and inner pores, depending on the electrostatic interactions. MOFs exhibit high performance due to their well-defined cages and a high surface area of over 2000 m2 g−1,149,150 while the stability of MOFs was under debate because of the occurrence of adsorption (e.g., MOF-5 was sensitive to a humid environment). Transforming MOFs into carbons had promising potential because carbons have well-developed pores and good chemical inertness. Carbons with fast kinetics and low weight were useful for H2 storage and CO2 capture, representing the main bottleneck for H2 fuel cell vehicles and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. The parameters of gas molecules were determined by Guo et al.148 using GO-based adsorbents as the model; we investigated certain interesting ones such as H2, N2, CO2, and CH4 considering the fact that they are often studied in the syntheses of MOF-derived carbons, as summarized in Table 1.

In 2008, Xu et al.94 reported the H2 uptake of 2.60 wt% at 1 bar for carbons (2872 m2 g−1) from MOF-5 and FA, constituting the first report for gas storage on MOF-derived carbons. Later, H2 uptake of up to 2.77 wt% at 1 bar was reported for the carbons with a surface area of 3405 m2 g−1 using ZIF-8 to replace MOF-5.99 Banerjee et al.101 studied H2 and CO2 capture behaviors on carbons from ZIF-68, ZIF-69, and ZIF-70, and the storage capacities were proportional to the surface areas of carbons, which were much larger than those of the parent ZIFs.124 A similar situation was also observed by Park et al.61 for carbons obtained from other MOFs, as shown in Fig. 13, where the pores showed the evolution of the hierarchical structure from microporous MOFs. The H2 uptakes for MOF-derived carbons are summarized in Table 2: ultrahigh uptake of 3.25 wt% was observed for MDC-1 at −196 °C and 1 bar due to a large surface area of 3174 m2 g−1 with ultramicropore volume of 0.63 cm3 g−1, largely exceeding all the reported MOFs and carbons until now. Importantly, volumes of the meso- and macropores for MDC-1 were also up to 3.05 cm3 g−1, yielding amazing H2 uptake at 25 °C and 100 bar. The H2 uptake on the carbonized sample (MOA-C) from Al-MOG was also higher than that in MOG,82 even if they had similar surface areas. As expected, the KOH-activated sample (MOX-C) with the largest surface areas had the highest uptake, which was also confirmed by the carbons from MOF-74 in the microcrystal or rod shape.110 The carbons (C1000, 1492 m2 g−1) from Zn-MOF had CH4 uptake of 20.8 wt% at 25 °C and 95 bar with high selectivity of 27 toward CO2/CH4 in an equimolar mixture at 1 bar,92 which was much higher than that for classical CMK-3 with selectivity of 3.4.151 Zou et al.68 reported the KOH activation of carbons (CZIF8a, CZIF68a, and CZIF69a) with surface areas of 2437, 1861, and 2264 m2 g−1, respectively. Among them, CZIF8a had the highest H2 uptake of 2.59 wt% at 1 bar, while CZIF69a showed the highest CO2 uptake of 4.76 mmol g−1 at 1 bar and 0 °C due to the effect of coordination from the Cl groups on the ligands of ZIF-69. Mokaya et al.100 also reported a large enhancement in the H2 uptake at 20 bar on carbons by KOH activation, varying from 2.6–3.1 wt% for the carbonized sample to 3.9–6.2 wt% for activated carbons, which is highly related with the increase in the microporous surface area and volume. As adsorbents for H2 storage, B-doping also enhanced the adsorption energy by electronic interaction from the occupied s-orbital of H2 to the empty pz-orbital of B, making B-doped carbons to be worthwhile candidates for H2 storage. For instance, boron nitrides had high H2 uptake due to their interaction with H2 molecules from the dipole moment of B–N bonds and the local curvature of the surface.152–155 Xu et al.120 reported N-doped or B,N-codoped carbons obtained from ILs and MIL-100 with surface areas of 2731, 2397, 1068, and 1522 m2 g−1 for C800, NC800, BNC800-1, and BNC800-2, respectively. Among them, C800 had the highest H2 uptake of 1.8 wt% at 1 bar (Fig. 14). Both NC800 and BNC800-2 had appreciable uptake of 1.7 wt% even when BNC800-2 showed much lower surface areas as compared to those of C800 and NC800. However, BNC800 had much higher H2 uptake when normalized to the surface areas, indicating that a higher content of B,N-species with higher surface areas could enhance the H2 uptake as compared with N-doped or undecorated carbons. As a comparison, both surface areas and N-species showed an important effect toward CO2 capture, as shown in Fig. 14. The Qst value of CO2 on NC800 was 26 kJ mol−1 for lower coverage and BNC800 had a similar Qst value of 23 kJ mol−1 on C800 due to the offset effect of the acidic nature of B atoms. CO2/N2 selectivity at 0 °C was calculated to be 57 for NC800, 44 for BNC800-1, and 22 for C800; the high selectivity for B,N-codoped carbons was due to the microporous network with high charge density at the N-sites, facilitating more favorable interactions with the CO2 molecules via local dipole–quadrupole interactions.

Many studies have confirmed that incorporating N-species into carbons would provide more active centers for CO2 capture.156–158 Moreover, the high-pressure CO2 uptake was usually in agreement with the porosity of carbons from ZIF-8,83 where the uptake of 4.4 mmol g−1 was observed at 25 °C and 30 bar for carbons carbonized at 700 °C with a surface area of 494 m2 g−1 and then enhanced to 7.8 mmol g−1 on the same carbons with a surface area of 950 m2 g−1 only with acid washing to remove the Zn impurities. As metallic Zn usually starts to vaporize above 900 °C, no big difference was observed in the uptakes of the as-made carbons and carbons after acid washing. Significantly, the presence of Zn- and N-species were found to be beneficial for low-pressure uptake, particularly for carbons obtained at less than 700 °C.159 A positive effect of metal and N-doping was also observed by Matsuoka et al.160 for the carbons from ZIF-9, acting as the catalyst to promote the reaction of CO2 with epoxide to form cyclic carbonates. Xu et al.37 reported carbons from ZIF-8, FA, and NH4OH as carbonized at various temperatures, where ultrahigh CO2 uptake of 1.53 mmol g−1 at 0.1 bar and 0 °C was observed for the carbons (600 °C) with a surface area of 455 m2 g−1 and N-species content of 25.9 wt%, confirming the existence of strong interactions between CO2 and N-species at lower pressures. High adsorption energy was observed for carbons (700 °C, 1022 m2 g−1) with N-species content of 20.9 wt%, where the Qst value of CO2 was up to 30 kJ mol−1 even at higher coverage and the CO2/CH4 selectivity was as high as 11 at 0 °C. The importance of micropores and N-species for CO2 capture was recently demonstrated by different groups.70,140,161 For instance, Li et al.121,122 reported the CO2 capture performance of carbons derived from MOFs@urea, using MOF-5 or ZIF-8 as the template and urea as the N-source. With regard to MOF-5, the carbons (600 °C) with an intermediate surface area of 1161 m2 g−1 exhibited the largest CO2 uptake of 2.44 mmol g−1 at 1 bar,121 while the carbons for ZIF-8@urea (650 °C) with the smallest surface area (948 m2 g−1) showed the best uptake of 3.7 mmol g−1 under the same conditions owing to higher concentration of N-species of 25.5 at%.122 Theoretical calculations also indicated that high N-species concentrations could promote interactions through H-bonding or electrostatic potential with larger CO2 uptake. Srinivas et al.65 also reported hierarchical carbons from MOF-5 with high CO2 uptake at higher pressures due to the exceptionally high porosity with micro-, meso-, and macropores, where ultrahigh uptake of up to 27 mmol g−1 was observed at 30 bar and 27 °C for carbons from millimeter-sized MOF-5 with a surface area of 2734 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 5.23 cm3 g−1.65 It should be pointed out that there was no correlation between the surface areas and CO2 uptake at 30 bar from the collected data on various types of carbons over 2000 m2 g−1, while the uptake showed an almost linear relationship with the surface areas of the present MOF-derived hierarchical carbons, where the CO2 uptake of 10 mmol g−1 was observed for each 1000 m2 g−1 increase in the surface area.
3.2. Batteries
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) form the source of energy for a majority of portable devices due to their high energy density and long lifetime.40 The basic principle of LIBs is that Li in the anodes gets oxidized to Li+, which then moves toward the cathodes, where it gets inserted into the cathode materials. Although many types of carbons, such as carbon fibers, graphene, hollow carbon spheres, and carbon beads, have been reported for use in LIBs,85,162–164 most of them show unsatisfactory performance due to the limited availability of sites for Li storage, low conductivity, and poor stability after the intercalation–deintercalation of Li. Large numbers of MOFs or MOF-based metal oxides have been reported for use as electrodes for batteries, which can be found in several recent reviews.40,48,49 Here, we have focused on MOF-derived metal-free carbons for battery applications. For use as the anode for LIBs, N-doped carbons can be obtained by the simple carbonization of ZIF-8. For instance, N-doped graphene analogs (634 m2 g−1) with 17 wt% N-species could be obtained from the carbonization of ZIF-8 at 800 °C,165 yielding a capacity of 2132 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. A capacity of 785 mA h g−1 could be retained after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 15, constituting one of the best capacities obtained from carbons. Such remarkable performance could be largely attributed to the graphene-analogous structure with abundant N-species, which could be favorably grafted by sites at the edges of graphene or within the hexagonal lattice, particularly for pyridinic- or pyrrolic-N. Theoretical calculations also confirmed the adsorption ability of this edge-doped graphene model.165 Comparatively, carbons (1880 m2 g−1) obtained from MOF-5 had a capacity of 1015 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 even when the surface areas were almost triple of those obtained from ZIF-8,166 confirming the importance of N-doping for Li storage. Very recently, Cai et al.167 reported a novel porous Zn-based polyhedral MOF (Zn-PBAI) with the pcu topology, as shown in Fig. 16, using a T-shaped ligand of 5-(4-pyridin-4-yl-benzoylamino) isophthalic acid (H2PBAI) to assemble with Zn under solvothermal conditions. Porous carbon polyhedra (PCP) were obtained from simple carbonization (Fig. 16), and PCP-1000 carbonized at 1000 °C with a surface area of 1254 m2 g−1 had the highest reversible capacity of 1125 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 200 cycles due to the large accessible surface areas and good electric conductivity. Li et al.168 also reported the potential of carbons in LIBs from the carbonization of Zn-MOF at 1000 °C, where the as-made carbons (FPC) in a N2 atmosphere at 1 bar had a reversible capacity of 1600 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C (1C = 0.037 A g−1), and the carbon (VFPC) obtained from vacuum pressure showed a capacity of up to 2458 mA h g−1. VFPC also exhibited superior rate capability with a capacity of up to 2016 mA h g−1 even after 50 cycles. The better Li-storage performance of VFPC could be attributed to the fact that the vacuum condition could induce the formation of a multifractal structure and more closed pores in the carbons, providing sufficient active sites for Li storage with enriched transition zones in the Li atoms.51

In addition, N-doped carbon sponges (NCS) comprising hierarchical porous layers were obtained from the carbonization of Al-MOF at 800 °C under NH3 flow, and Se was impregnated into 0.4–0.55 nm pores with surface areas decreased from 1274.5 m2 g−1 for NCS to 195.2 m2 g−1 for NCS/Se-50 after the introduction of Se into the pores.142 When used as cathodes for Li–Se batteries, NCS/Se-50 exhibited good stability and rate capability with a capacity of 443.2 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and only 0.03% loss per cycle even up to 200 cycles. Further, the cathode retained a capacity of 286 mA h g−1 at 5 C after 60 cycles. This robust NCS provided a stable environment for the intercalation–deintercalation of Li in the presence of Se,169 where the micropores in the layers acted as efficient immobilizers for linear Se and N-doping improved the conductivity and facilitated rapid charge transfer during the redox reaction. The tunable structure and composition of MOF-derived carbons also allowed them to be suitable host materials for S-doping for Li–S battery applications. Several types of MOF-derived carbons have been used as a support to encapsulate sulfur by the melting–diffusion route.143,145,170,171 Micropores in the skeleton can induce strong confinement for the guest species and then alter the behaviors of S-doped carbons.82,143 For instance, Wang et al.145 reported the KOH activation treatment of carbons obtained from MOF-5, where the as-made AMCP-950 composite exhibited uniform sponge-like morphology, abundant mesopores, and large surface area of 2211 m2 g−1. The as-made AMCP-950/S composite with S-species content up to 79 wt% showed excellent performance with a high initial capacity of 1274.0 mA h g−1 and 81.7% capacity retention after 50 cycles at a discharge rate of 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g−1). Zhang et al.172 reported CNT@Meso-C with hierarchical pores obtained from CNT@MOF-5; subsequently, active sulfur was encapsulated into the matrix. As a result, the initial and 50-cycle discharge capacities of CNT@Meso-C/S at 0.5 C were as high as 1343 and 540 mA h g−1, respectively, implying that CNT@Meso-C was a promising host material toward S-doping for Li–S battery applications. N-Doped hierarchical porous carbon (NHPC) was obtained from Cu-MOA constructed by the addition of moderate HMT to modulate the growth of HKUST;109 the as-made S/NHPC with S-species content up to 74% was obtained after heating S and NHPC at a mass ratio of 1:1 at 155 °C, showing an initial capacity of 1341 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C with superior rate capability of 354 mA h g−1 at 5 C, which was much larger than those of S/HKC (without HMT) and pure sulfur tested under the same conditions. The decay for S/NHPC over 500 cycles was only 0.08% per cycle at 1C, highlighting the superior long-term cycling performance of Li–S batteries due to the presence of hierarchical micro- and mesopores in the structure.
Besides LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have also attracted attention as the most promising alternative to LIBs due to their low cost and abundant Na sources;49 further, the price of Li is almost 20 times that of Na. Although the principle of SIBs is similar to that of LIBs, SIBs face more challenges due to the larger size of ions, requiring more open channels to achieve sufficient mobility of ions in the cathodes. The materials reported for LIBs could show inferior performance when used in SIBs mainly because of the sluggish kinetics caused by the larger Na ions during intercalation. The major challenge would be to design appropriate materials that are capable of accommodating Na ions with ultrastable cycling. MOF-derived metal-free carbons were also confirmed by several groups to be promising potential materials for use in SIBs even though the performance was slightly lower than that of carbons with metallic impurities.49,173 Zheng et al.174 reported carbons (ZIF-C, 1251 m2 g−1) with homogeneous micropores of ∼0.5 nm from ZIF-8 (930 °C), showing higher capacity and better reversibility than classical CMK-3 as the anode for SIBs. When compared with CMK-3, an initial capacity of 164 mA h g−1 was observed for ZIF-C at 0.05 A g−1, which remained 129 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with superior rate performance. Recently, ZIF-8 nanocrystals were converted into ZIF-8 nanobubbles (size: <100 nm; thickness: 10 nm) by incubation in tannic acid,72 and hollow carbon nanobubbles with uniform sizes of 70 nm were obtained after carbonization at 600 °C followed by acid etching, which were similar to those of the parent ZIF-8, as shown in Fig. 17. The nanobubbles were confirmed to enhance the Na/K ion intercalation during the charge–discharge process in capacitor-type behavior, promoting the shorter diffusion pathways and easily accessible surfaces for ions. In general, battery-type intercalation yields cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves with Faradaic redox peaks, and capacitor-type intercalation yield quasi-rectangular CV curves.48,175 Obviously, the CV curves at 5 mV s−1 for nonhollow particles had significant redox peaks, while the CV curves for hollow nanobubbles had a stable quasi-rectangular shape (Fig. 17). Both carbons showed a capacity of 240 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, while the capacity for those with nanobubbles and nonhollow particles dropped down to 90 and 4 mA h g−1, respectively, at 15 A g−1. Moreover, the hollow nanobubbles had competitively high capacity for Na storage as compared to those obtained from other carbons (Fig. 17).72 Significantly, carbon nanobubbles also had outstanding K-storage performance with insertion and extraction processes similar to those observed in Na ions. Recently, Song et al.176,177 reported N-doped carbons (HNC) from HMT-based MOFs, where HNCs obtained from HMT-based MOFs (Cu) at 600–900 °C had N-species content of 29 at% due to the high N-species of hexamine (HMT) molecules. When used as anodes for SIBs, HNCs had superior rate and cycling performances,176 where the reversible capacities were up to 160 and 142 mA h g−1 at 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively, and the capacities of 145 and 123 mA h g−1 were retained after 500 cycles. The ratio between pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in HNC was confirmed to be critical in determining Na storage. They also reported obtaining N-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCN) with N-doping of 16.5 at% from HMT-based MOF (Zn),177 where NPCN had a capacity of 318 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and retained 194 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, which is among the best rate capabilities toward Na storage due to the unique sheet structure and high N-species content. All these results indicated that MOF-derived carbons with high N-species can become promising candidates for use as electrodes in battery applications.

3.3. Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are one of the most promising devices with characteristics of high power density, long-term stability, and fast charging ability. A widely accepted mechanism for supercapacitors could be divided into two series: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.6,178 EDLCs are highly controlled by electrolyte adsorption, while pseudocapacitors are mainly based on redox reactions at the interface, which were usually evaluated by CV, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and impedance spectroscopy techniques. The nature of the electrode can affect the capacitance, particularly for adsorptive sites and the surface doping of active materials in the electrode. Carbons are one of the most promising active materials due to their chemical inertness, conductivity, and tunable pores;3 the existence of mesopores and N-doping can facilitate transportation, particularly at higher current densities.6,12 The properties of N-doping and high surface areas made carbons to be attractive candidates in energy storage with tremendous efforts focused on supercapacitors. It should be noted that wide ranges of MOF nanocrystals, such as MOF-5, MOF-74, ZIF-8, HKUST, UiO-66, MOF-177, and MOF-867, have been directly explored for use as electrodes in supercapacitors;40 further, Zr-based MOF-867 had much better energy density as compared to that obtained from the capacitor fabricated from commercially available activated carbons and graphene-based electrodes.179 MOF-derived carbons have been widely reported in the past few years for use as electrodes for supercapacitors due to advantages such as high surface areas, N-doping, and controllable pore size.180–184
In 2008, Xu et al.94 reported carbons (NPC) obtained from MOF-5 and FA, which were used as electrodes in 1 M H2SO4, constituting the first report of MOF-derived carbons for use in supercapacitors. Partial meso- and macropores imparted NPC with good EDLC properties, contributing to the slow decay in capacitance from 204 to 159 F g−1 as the scan rate increased from 5 to 50 mV s−1; high capacitance (312 F g−1) was observed at 1 mV s−1. The reported capacitances in aqueous electrolytes for various MOF-derived carbons are summarized in Table 3. Worm-like mesoporous carbons (WMC) with a surface area of 2587 m2 g−1 were obtained from the carbonization of Bi(NO3)3, MOF-5, and glycerol at 1000 °C,97 showing capacitance of up to 344 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. Zhan et al.187 reported laminated hollow porous carbons (HPC) from nonporous Zn-based MOFs and phenol resin when carbonized at 950 °C,187 showing capacitance of 234 F g−1 at 0.01 A g−1 and 203 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 in 6 M KOH, which are among the highest rate capability for carbons. The laminated structure in the 10–30 nm range played a critical role in the capacitive performance of HPC, providing short channels for ion diffusion and improving the accessible surface, particularly at higher current densities. The well-developed porosity was also confirmed to facilitate the capacitive performance in both aqueous and organic electrolytes.60 N-doped carbons were obtained from the carbonization of solvothermal carbon and urea at 800 °C after treating zinc(II)-bis(8-hydroxyquinoline) in ethanol at 200 °C to obtain solvothermal carbon,188 showing large differences in microporosity and morphology as compared to those carbons obtained in the absence of urea. The capacitance of 219 F g−1 could be achieved at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH for carbons (484 m2 g−1), which was an increase of up to 56% as compared to that obtained from carbons (521 m2 g−1) in the absence of urea; the former also had better stability with attenuation of 7.6% after 3000 cycles at 4 A g−1. Yamauchi et al.69 also reported high capacitive performance of N-doped carbons obtained from ZIF-8 in 0.5 M H2SO4, where Z-900 carbonized at 900 °C yielded capacitance values of 128 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 and 214 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 without any loss after 250 cycles. Significantly, Z-900 also showed high volumetric capacitance (200 F cm−3) at 5 mV s−1, constituting the highest volumetric value reported for carbons.69 All these results indicated the high performance of MOF-derived carbons when used as electrodes, particularly in terms of high capacitance and rate capability due to N-doping and high microporosity, and the efficient surface areas accessed by solvated ions primarily contributed toward capacitance besides pseudocapacitance.60,184

To further enhance the supercapacitor performance, many efforts have been devoted toward fabricating MOF-derived carbons with N-doping, hierarchical pores, and graphitization.182 The graphitic degree of MOF-derived carbons was correlated to the metal centers in MOFs, while heteroatoms doping including N-doping could be introduced by using various linkers. For instance, Nune et al.63 reported CMOF-950 and CIRMOF-3-950 with similar surface areas and cubic shape from MOF-5 and IRMOF-3, as shown in Fig. 18. CIRMOF-3-950 with N-species content of 3.3 at% had a high capacitance of 239 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4, retaining 189 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 with no obvious fading in capacitance after 10000 cycles. However, analogous N-free CMOF-950 had a capacitance value of 24 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1. Zhu et al.189 reported bimodal pores in carbons (1.0 and 3–20 nm) from silica@ZIF-8, and high capacitance of 181 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH was observed for carbons with much lower resistance as compared to those of carbons from the absence of silica owing to the presence of larger mesopores in the structure. The positive effects of N-doping and hierarchical pores were also observed for carbons from ZIF-8 and other sources, and carbon-ZS obtained from sucrose@ZIF-8 showed not only high capacitance but also superior long-term cycling stability because of its graphene-like structure with hierarchical pores and high N-species content.104 The balance between conductivity and surface area for carbons was also very important for dictating the capacitive performance.76,183 For instance, NPC-800 obtained from ZIF-67 with a high graphitic degree showed capacitance of up to 238 F g−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 20 mV s−1,185 which was much larger than the value of 112 F g−1 obtained from commercially available activated carbon with larger surface areas. The ratio of IG/ID in the Raman spectra for NPC-800 was calculated to be 2.07, almost two times that for activated carbons.185 The capacitance of NPC-800 at 20 mV s−1 was even much larger than the value of 214 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 for carbons obtained from ZIF-8 with close surface areas,69 which could be attributed to the high graphitization of carbons from the catalytic effect of Co. Yao et al.130 reported the wrapping of ZIF-8 into 2D ZIF-L (Co) to form hierarchical carbons containing CNTs with much higher surface areas, higher N-species content, and enhanced conductivity as compared to those of the carbons obtained from single ZIFs. The presence of ZIF-8 enhanced the surface areas and N-species content, while ZIF-L increased the graphitization degree or conductivity of carbons. The catalytic effect of Co induced CNT wrapping in the carbons, as shown in the TEM images (Fig. 19). Importantly, carbons (CZ-6) with surface areas of 1007 m2 g−1 had a capacitance value of 274 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 as compared to those of 220 F g−1 obtained for carbonized ZIF-8 and 57 F g−1 for carbonized ZIF-L (Co) in 6 M KOH. Further, the long-term cycling of CZ-6 at 20 A g−1 showed 96% retention even after 10000 cycles. CZ-6-based supercapacitors showed superior stability with an energy density of 6.99 W h kg−1 at 0.26 kW kg−1, which was much higher than those obtained from other types of MOF-derived carbons reported earlier,60,97,184 indicating the importance of graphitization and hierarchical pores for improving the capacitive performance.171 In addition, an enhancement was observed for the carbons obtained from MOFs and other types of carbon materials,134–136,186,190 where the presence of CNTs or GO in the composite would endow the carbons with hierarchical pores and improved conductivity during carbonization. For instance, Hao et al.134 reported sandwich-like N-doped carbons obtained from ZIF-8@GO, and the as-made carbons (NCG-800) contained a graphene substrate with carbon particles with sizes of 30–50 nm, showing capacitance as high as 225 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 with superior stability and 96.8% retention after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Wu et al.186 reported carbons obtained from CNT@ZIF-8@PVP with necklace architectures, showing capacitance values of up to 326 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 298 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 with high stability and 99.7% retention after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which were among the best data reported for MOF-derived carbons until now; a summary is provided in Table 3. The efficient modulations of the pores, particle sizes, shapes, and dimensions of MOF-derived carbons were also attractive strategies to improve the capacitive performances.110,191 For instance, Gadipelli et al.191 reported carbon polyhedra from ZIF-8 with sizes varying from 50 nm to the micrometer range, and all the features such as surface area, N-doping, pore size, and graphitization were strictly controlled in the carbons, resulting in capacity enhancement of 50 F g−1 as the size reduced from the micrometer range to less than 200 nm. The carbonization further had a considerable impact on the rate capacitance, and the increased size resulted in a decrease in charge transportability and inhibited the charge storage performance. Low-dimension carbons were obtained from MOF-74 rods,110 where 2D GNRibs were obtained from the KOH activation of carbon rods with capacitances of 193 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 and 123 F g−1 at 400 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4, which were much larger than those obtained from carbon rods. These GNRibs also showed high cycling stability at 10 mV s−1, indicating robust architecture for conductivity and porous graphene layers with high ion mobility during the cycling process. Wang et al.192 reported carbons (2618 m2 g−1) from MOF-5 with sizes in the range of 5–6 nm and the presence of hierarchical pores, showing good rate performance as the electrodes in 0.5 M Na2SO4 with capacitances of 150 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and 133 F g−1 at 50 A g−1. An all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor was assembled from the derived carbons using Na2SO4/PVA gel as the electrolyte, delivering a high power density of 13516 W kg−1 with an energy density of 8.26 W h kg−1. Further, this device had superior cycling performance with 94.8% retention after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Based on these discussions, all the features affecting the capacitive performance of MOF-derived carbons could be modulated by tuning the MOF precursors, synthesis procedures, and posttreatment strategies, making these carbons to be promising candidates for use in electrochemical capacitors.

3.4. Electrocatalysis
Electrocatalysts comprised center components in energy conversion, where they can promote the conversion of electricity from fuels.42,45,48 The oxidation of fuels like H2 in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring in fuel cells constituted the core of energy conversion devices: here, Pt/C is the most widely explored catalyst because of its lower energy barrier for sluggish reaction kinetics of O2-involved species. However, limited availability, high cost, poor stability, and CO deactivation during the reaction have undermined its potential applications. For the large-scale deployment of energy conversion, low-cost metal-free catalysts have become highly demanded and N-doped carbons have been confirmed to be efficient catalysts due to the rearrangement of the electronic structure in carbons after the introduction of N-species.141 N-doped CNTs were probably the first reported metal-free catalysts for electrocatalysis applications,193 where the catalytic efficiency of N-doped CNTs for CO2 reduction into CO was much larger than that of N-free CNT. Recently, Gascon et al.194 reported N-doped carbons obtained from the carbonization of ZIF-8 followed by acid washing to remove ZnO nanoparticles; the schematic is shown in Fig. 20. In CO2 electroreduction, NC-900 showed the highest Faradaic efficiency toward selective CO formation of up to 78% at −0.93 V vs. RHE,194 which can be attributed to the large amount of pyridinic-N and quaternary-N species present in the structure because they could lower the energy barrier for the formation of COOH* intermediates. Recently, large numbers of MOF-derived carbons have been studied for use as efficient ORR catalysts with high activity and durability,45 having promising potential as alternatives to noble metal catalysts. For instance, Wen et al.115 reported N-doped mesoporous carbons obtained from the carbonization of melamine and Zn-MOF-74, having high activity, durability, and CH3OH tolerance, as efficient pH-universal catalysts for use in ORR, showing comparable or even better activity as compared to that obtained from Pt/C in alkaline, acidic, or neutral electrolytes. The use of O-abundant Zn-based MOFs as the precursor was the key parameter to obtain such carbons with mesoporous sizes. Moreover, the size of MOFs had an obvious impact on the ORR activity for carbons, and the activity markedly increased as the size decreased.195 The first example of MOF-derived carbons on the ORR was reported when using ZIF-7@glucose,105 and the as-made Carbon-L had superior ORR activity with the onset and half-wave potential values of 0.86 and 0.70 V vs. RHE, respectively, in 0.1 M KOH, showing transferred numbers of electron of close to four (Fig. 21). N-Doped carbons obtained from ZIF-8, NH4OH, and FA also exhibited superior ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH,37 where the limiting current density at 0.7 V for carbons (NC900) was up to 1.36 mA cm−2. Interestingly, NC900 with moderate N-species, high surface area, and quantities of mesopores favored a 4e− pathway; however, NC800 with high N-species, moderate surface area, and more micropores favored a 2e− ORR process. The positive effect of N-species toward ORR was confirmed by other groups,67,90,106 although the detailed effect from which type of N-species (graphitic, quaternary, pyridinic, pyrrolic, or amine N) is debatable.196–199 The most accepted mechanism was due to the presence of graphitic- or pyridinic-N, and the total N-species imparted a marginal impact on the ORR activity and selectivity.118 For instance, Hong et al.67 reported N-doped graphitic carbons (NGPC) from ZIF-8 with a polyhedral shape with rich N-species and hierarchical pores. NGPC-1000-10 carbonized at 1000 °C for 10 h had a 4e−-dominant ORR process with Eonset (−0.02 V) and E1/2 (−0.20 V) values negatively shifted by only 40 mV as compared to those of 20 wt% Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH, which can be attributed to the abundant active sites with graphitic-N and well-conducting network. Cao et al.73 also reported three carbons from ZIF-7 with close pyridinic-N species and varied shapes of spheres, rods, or polyhedra, as shown in Fig. 22. Here, NC-D-800 obtained from polyhedral ZIF-7 showed the best ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH due to the highest surface areas of 538 m2 g−1 and graphitic-N content of 30.4%. After NH3 treatment, NC-D-NH3 retained its polyhedral shape with a surface area of 636 m2 g−1 and more positive onset potential of 1.0 V and half-wave potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE as compared to those of NC-D-800, exceeding the benchmark set by 20 wt% Pt/C with Eonset (0.95 V) and E1/2 (0.81 V). N-species content decreased from 10.3% in NC-D-800 to 2.2% in NC-D-NH3; however, the graphitic-N content increased to 54.6%, which would impart NC-D-NH3 with additional active sites to improve its activity. Nakamura et al.200 studied the ORR active sites in an acidic medium by using the oriented graphite with well-defined π-conjugation and controlled N-species, indicating that the active sites were the C atoms next to pyridinic-N with Lewis basicity at which O2 molecules were adsorbed as the initial step of ORR. Similarly, Zhao et al.90,201 observed the enhancement of activity from pyridinic-N in MOF-derived carbons constructed by pyridyl- or bipyridine ligands; further, pyridinic-N provided more active sites in the edge-based model and subsequently improved the onset potential in the ORR process. The graphitization of carbons also played important roles in the ORR activity from the highly decreased resistance of electron transfer and then produced higher activity.201 MOF-based N-doped carbons with mesopores also showed promising potential as catalysts for dye-sensitized solar cells.202,203 For instance, Sung et al.203 enlarged the pore sizes of carbons from ZIF-8 by increasing the dwelling time of Zn, where thin polydopamine shells covered the ZIF-8 surface and retarded the escape of vaporized Zn species during the carbonization process. The as-made carbons had superior catalytic activity in triiodide reduction with conversion efficiency of up to 9.03%, which was among the highest value obtained for carbon-based electrocatalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells.

Although N-doped carbons with good ORR activity could be obtained from MOFs, most of them were microporous with sp3-dominant structures, suppressing mass transport with low conductivity. As discussed above, carbons with high conductivity could be obtained by using MOFs and other types of carbons such as CNTs, GO, or graphene.132–138 For instance, the carbons (C-CZ-4-1000) obtained from ZIF-8@CNT had half-wave potential that was only 24 mV lower than that of 40 wt% Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH with a lower Tafel slope of 49 mV dec−1, as shown in Fig. 23.133 The limiting current density of C-CZ-4-1000 was as high as 6 mA cm−2 at 1600 rpm with a dominant 4e− pathway, showing good stability with lower deterioration after 5000 cycles. Both CNTs and N-doped carbons obtained from ZIF-8 had much lower numbers of electrons transferred and higher H2O2 yields, confirming the synergetic effect between CNTs and carbonized ZIF-8 in yielding the high activity. Wang et al.139 reported N-doped carbon@graphene sandwich with a surface area of 1170 m2/g: the as-made Zn-ZIF/GO-800 showed a high Eonset value (0.92 V vs. RHE) and limiting current density (5.2 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V) with dominant 4e− mechanism in 0.1 M KOH. Significantly, N-doped carbon@graphene sandwiches from ZIF-8 and GO were also confirmed to be efficient OER catalysts with catalytic activity close to that of RuO2.132 Wang et al.204 reported hybrids (NGPC/NCNT) of N-doped carbons and CNTs obtained in a stepwise manner using MOF-5 and urea as the C and N sources, respectively, and nickel as the catalyst for graphitization; these hybrids had a surface area of up to 1053 m2 g−1. The evolution of CNTs could be attributed to the repeated dissolve–precipitate behavior of the species (e.g., C2N2+, C3N2+, and C3N3+) from urea decomposition on Ni particles in NGPC. The optimized NGPC/NCNT-900 had a slightly more positive activity on the onset potential (−51 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) and half-wave potential (−171 mV) as compared to those of 20 wt% Pt/C, resulting from the unique hybrids structure, rich N-species, high graphitization, and high surface areas. Moreover, the codoping of other heteroatoms was also identified to an efficient strategy for facilitating ORR; here, the use of carbons with larger surface areas, smaller sizes, and good conductivities would be optimal.81,195 For instance, Yao et al.81 reported N-doped carbons from amino-acid-modified MIL-53(Al) with pores of 1 nm and microporous contributions as high as 93% toward surface areas and 88% toward volumes; they showed good activity in 0.1 M KOH. N-Doped carbons from IRMOF-3 when carbonized at 600 or 950 °C also showed good activity in 0.1 M KOH;196 CIRMOF-3-950 yielded high performance when used in supercapacitors in 1 M H2SO4, as discussed in an earlier section.63 CIRMOF-3-950 showed a higher surface area (553 m2 g−1) and lower N-species content (3.3 at%) than those of CIRMOF-3-600 (393 m2 g−1 and 7 at%, respectively), and the onset potential of carbons increased from −0.23 to −0.08 V as the temperature increased from 600 to 950 °C, which was close to that of 20 wt% Pt/C (−0.05 V). This high activity was due to the high content of quaternary- and pyridinic-N with high surface areas and good conductivities. The transferred numbers of electrons on CIRMOF-3-950 were about four, and the ORR had a 2e− reduction pathway on CIRMOF-3-600. It should be noted that carbons containing heteroatoms besides N-species would be obtained by the carbonization of MOFs or a mixture of MOFs and heteroatom-enriched organics;119,205 further, posttreatment has also been proven to be an efficient strategy for heteroatom doping.73,144,206 Liang et al.205 reported N,S-codoped carbons from MOFs (SCUT-12), and S- and N-containing ligands acting as the internal S and N sources were successfully transferred into the skeleton. The as-made carbons (NSMC900) showed decent activity toward ORR in 0.1 M KOH with onset and half-wave potential values of 0.98 and 0.85 V, respectively, comparable to those obtained from 40 wt% Pt/C. The ORR activity of N,S-codoped carbons largely outperformed either one of the mono-element-doped carbons, confirming the synergistic effect of dual-element doping.119 First-principles calculations revealed a positive effect of N,S-codoping,206 where N,S-coupled dopants promoted carbon sites with higher activity as compared to those obtained from isolated N- or S-dopants. N,S-coupled carbons would provide improved electron density to adsorb O2 and then promote O2 and its species to be reduced, which was also confirmed by N,P-codoped carbons from UiO-66-NH2.207 Recently, ultrathin tellurium nanowires (Te) were used as templates to construct ZIF-8 nanofibers,208 inducing the attachment of ZIF-8 nuclei and crystals onto the active surface of Te. After carbonization at 1000 °C, 1D carbon nanofibers (Z8-Te-1000, 2270 m2 g−1) with hierarchical pores were obtained, showing onset potential of −0.14 V and half-wave potential of −0.226 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M KOH, which were close to those for 20 wt% Pt/C. On further doping with phosphorus, the activity for P-Z8-Te-1000 (1417 m2 g−1) was largely enhanced as evident from the Eonset (−0.07 V) and E1/2 (−0.161 V) values, which are much better than those of 20 wt% Pt/C. Dai et al.64 reported obtaining N,P,S-tridoped carbons from MOF-5, DCDA, TPP, and DMSO, where the as-made carbons showed comparable onset potential in 0.1 M KOH as that obtained from Pt/C, and no noticeable change was observed after the addition of methanol. The i–t response up to 20000s with continuous ORR at −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) also indicated that the carbons retained 80% of the initial current with higher stability as compared to that obtained in Pt/C, making the carbons to become feasible candidates for use in methanol alkaline fuel cells.

Different from heteroatom-doped carbons, Wang et al.89 observed excellent ORR catalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH for mesoporous carbons obtained from nonporous MOFs without any heteroatom doping, which could be attributed to the large surface area and mesoporous structure coupled with the presence of moderate defects. Mesopores provided wider channels that facilitated diffusion as compared to the micropores; large surface areas contributed by partial mesopores exposed more active sites to enhance the ORR activity; further, defects modified the local atomic structure and altered the electronic distribution of the carbon lattice. Wen et al.115 reported PC and NPC by the carbonization of pure Zn-MOF-74 and a mixture of melamine and Zn-MOF-74, respectively, at 1000 °C. The ID/IG intensity ratio varied from 0.90 for PC-1000 to 0.98 for NPC-1000, indicating the presence of more defects in NPC-1000 because of N-doping. Although NPC-1000 showed a lower surface area of 811 m2 g−1 as compared to that of PC-1000 (1077 m2 g−1), the former had better ORR activity not only in alkaline media but also in acidic and neutral electrolytes due to the synergetic effect of the graphitic- and pyridinic-N species and defects in the skeleton. It was not difficult to understand that by introducing defects, the sp2 orbitals of carbons would get partially broken, and the charged sites that behaved as active sites for ORR would be better exposed to favor O2 adsorption and weaken O2 bonds. The carbonization of Zn-based MOFs was efficient to obtain carbons with moderate defects due to the highly porous texture with Zn centers, and defects could be formed after Zn removal with a precise control over the carbonization procedure.209 Yao et al.209 reported carbons obtained from the carbonization of IRMOF-8 950 °C, which only contained C and O atoms and yielded a surface area of 836 m2 g−1. The as-made PC-I8-950 showed superior activity in 0.1 M KOH with distinct onset potential at −0.06 V and reduction peak of ORR at −0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl); further, 20 wt% Pt/C had onset potential of −0.06 V and reduction peak of ORR of −0.16 V. The LSV curves of PC-I8-950 were also similar to those of Pt/C, supporting the dominant 4e− process for the direct reduction of O2 to OH−. Considering the fact that the carbons consisted of only C and O atoms with moderate surface areas, the high performance of the ORR activity for PC-I8-950 could be attributed to the presence of defects within the sp2-carbon matrix and not the heteroatoms (N, P, or S) as reported earlier. To induce more defects in the carbons, Wang et al.210 reported the carbonization of NaCl and ZIF-8 at 900 °C in a sealed reactor, where 3D nanosheet-linked polyhedral carbons (1579 m2 g−1) were obtained with rich defects and N-species content of 8.14 at%. Significantly, the carbons exhibited considerably enhanced ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH as compared to N-doped carbons from ZIF-8, showing comparable catalytic activity to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. Primary zinc–air batteries assembled from carbons also exhibited superior performances. All the above results indicate that the integration of heteroatoms, such as N-, P-, and S-dopants, with rich defects could result in the formation of highly active sites for ORR, highlighting the promising potential of defect engineering in fabricating efficient ORR catalysts.
3.5 Water treatment
Moreover, MOF-derived metal-free carbons have often been used in the area of water treatment, such as catalysts for the degradation of organic contaminants, adsorbents for organics removal, electrode materials for electrosorption, and sensing materials for the detection of organic compounds.211 Rod-shaped carbons (PMFC) with a surface area of 1700 m2 g−1 were reported from the carbonization of rod-like Zn-based MOF, as shown in Fig. 24,66 and the oxidized carbons (oPMFC) were efficient in the selective isolation of N-linked glycans from complex biological samples due to the strong interaction between the carbons and glycans, as well as the size-exclusion effect. As a result, 26 N-linked glycans could be identified from the digestion of standard glycoprotein ovalbumin at 0.01 μg μL−1; a detection limit as low as 1 ng μL−1 could be obtained with the identification of 21 N-linked glycans. These results indicate that MOF-derived metal-free carbons exhibit considerable potential for the selective enrichment of glycans, paving the way for glycan profiling in complex biosample analyses. N-Doped graphenes were reported from MIL-100 with carbonization at 800 °C with the assistance of DCDA, melamine, or urea,212 showing the high catalytic oxidation of p-hydroxylbenzoic acid (PHBA) by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, where singlet O2 was produced and dominated the PHBA degradation rather than hydroxyl or sulfate radicals. These graphenes also exhibited good catalytic oxidation of phenol and FA via the PMS activation–degradation mechanism, particularly for carbons using DCDA as the nitrogen source. N,P,S-tridoped hollow carbon shells were also derived by the carbonization of ZIF-67 after coating poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) on the surface of ZIF-67, followed by acid etching to remove the cobalt particles.113 Significantly, the as-made tridoped carbons also showed superior catalytic performance via the PMS activation mechanism because the presence of N, P, and S in the hollow shells could largely deteriorate the electroneutrality of the pristine carbon structure and subsequently promote O–O breakage in the PMS; this facilitated the generation of radicals.

In addition, capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as an efficient desalination technology in the recent years, and MOF-derived metal-free carbons have also been confirmed to be suitable CDI electrode materials.213–217 Carbon polyhedra (1187 m2 g−1) from ZIF-8 when carbonized at 1200 °C showed an electrosorption capacity of up to 13.86 mg g−1 in a 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution,213 constituting the first report of MOF-derived carbons toward CDI. N-Doped carbons were also obtained from bimetallic MOFs,215 where the molar ratio of Zn to Co in MOFs was adjusted to formulate the optimal combination of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67. Among the series of carbons obtained, PC-ZnCo-3 had a salt removal capacity as high as 45.6 mg g−1 in a 750 mg L−1 NaCl solution at 1.4 V using the membrane CDI (MCDI) system, as shown in Fig. 25, which was much higher than that ever reported using other types of electrode materials. The larger electrical potential on the electrodes would induce a larger electrosorption capacity with larger numbers of ions adsorbed in the electrodes; further, a larger voltage also resulted in an enhanced current (Fig. 25). Significantly, the charge efficiency of PC-ZnCo-3 at 1.4 V was as high as 93.7% in a 250 mg L−1 NaCl solution, showing superior cycling performance toward desalination without obvious decays over 22 cycles. MOF-derived carbons also showed promising potential as sensing materials for use in aromatic compounds or as electrochemical sensors.71,78,218,219 For instance, the carbonization of Al-PCP at 800 °C yielded carbons with fast responses toward benzene and toluene, resulting from the graphitic sp2-hybridized carbons in the skeleton.78 The uptakes of benzene vapor over the as-made carbons were also about 4 times higher than those obtained from commercially available activated carbons, exhibiting promising potential for the highly selective detection of aromatic guests in water. N-Doped carbons from ZIF-8 when carbonized at 1000 °C also had considerable potential when used as electrochemical sensors for several organic substances,218 where the linear response of Z-1000 for uric acid and catechol was obtained within 0.001–0.3 mM for detection limits of 1.4 × 10−8 M and 2.78 × 10−7 M, respectively, and a linear range for hydroquinone was in the region of 0.001–0.2 mM with a detection limit of 2.15 × 10−7 M. MOF-derived metal-free carbons also had significant potential as adsorbents for the efficient removal of organic dyes from water without creating any secondary pollution. Significantly, the presence of N-species in carbons would increase the interaction between the dyes and carbon surface, resulting in remarkably enhanced removal efficiency. For instance, Xia et al.161 reported a water steam carbonization route to obtain N-doped carbons from ZIF-8, showing enhanced microporosity as compared to carbons obtained from traditional carbonization techniques. These as-made carbons showed high performance toward methylene blue (MB) removal from water with efficiency of up to 98.5%, where the kinetic adsorption process was dominated by a pseudo-second-order adsorption model. The carbonization of DCDA and ZIF-8 at 950 °C yielded N-doped carbons with MB removal efficiency from water of close to 100%,220 where DCDA was used as the secondary nitrogen source during carbonization. N-Doped carbons obtained from amino-acid-modified aluminum terephthalate MOFs (CAU-1-NH2) also showed superior performance for methyl orange removal with a capacity of up to 222 mg g−1.221 Moreover, N-doped carbons were obtained from the carbonization of ZIF-8@IL through the ship-in-a-bottle method,222 and the as-made carbons showed remarkable performance for liquid-phase adsorption in both water and hydrocarbons. The adsorption performances for organic contaminant removal including atrazine, diuron, and diclofenac were remarkably enhanced for the carbons obtained from ZIF-8 or ZIF-8@IL when compared with commercially available activated carbons. In the case of atrazine, the maximum adsorption capacity (208 mg g−1) for carbons from ZIF-8@IL was higher than that obtained from activated carbon (60 mg g−1) and carbons obtained from ZIF-8 (168 mg g−1), which are among the highest data reported so far. The denitrogenation and desulfurization results for fuel were similar to that of water purification, resulting from the possible H-bonding mechanism on N-doped carbons. Recently, N-doped carbons were even reported from the carbonization of bimetallic ZIFs by adjusting the molar ratios of Zn/Co in the frameworks, and the optimized carbons had RhB adsorption capacity as high as 137 mg g−1,223 which were comparable to the reported data on activated carbons when using other precursors. Comparatively, the RhB adsorption amount on the counterparts of N-doped carbons from the carbonization of ZIF-8 was ∼88 mg g−1. All the above results indicated that MOF-derived carbons were promising materials for the detection, analysis, and purification of water, particularly for carbons with high surface areas, some mesopores, N-species, and other types of functional groups.

4. Summary and perspectives
MOFs with highly crystalline structures showed promising potential for the preparation of metal-free carbons due to attributes such as periodic structures, high surface areas, and abundant C-species in the organic linkers. Here, a wide range of MOF-derived carbons with varied pore structures, shapes, and sizes were summarized considering the large number of MOFs with different geometries and sizes have been reportedly conceptualized as points, lines, polygons, or polyhedra via the interactions between metals and organic ligands, showing superior performance for the applications of gas storage and separation, energy storage and conversion, and wastewater treatment. As concluded from this review, the carbonization temperature, secondary precursor, and posttreatment would exert a double-sided effect on the characteristics of carbons, urging us to explore appropriate synthesis procedures for MOF-derived carbons with high performance for detailed applications. For instance, surface area, mesoporosity, and functional group were the key parameters for carbons to determine the final uptake in gas storage and separation, particularly for high-pressure storage, while microporosity and functional groups on the carbons were more important for gas capture at ambient pressures. All these results indicate that MOF-derived carbons are one of the most promising materials for environment and energy applications because of their large surface areas, tunable porosity, and inherent presence of active adsorptive sites. However, it should be noted that there are certain challenges that exist in MOF-derived carbons regarding their syntheses and applications, which should be further explored in the future. First, the large-scale production of MOF-derived carbons should be resolved because of their low yields (usually in the range of 13–21%) depending on the carbonization temperature. Although the yield of carbons could be largely enhanced by the carbonization of MOFs and other sources, the presence of an additional source would affect the microstructure and active sites of these carbons. Second, theoretical calculations on the abovementioned discussions involving MOF-derived carbons were very limited; the scope of these calculations should be enhanced to better direct the synthesis of carbons with specific structures and functions, promoting the understanding on the detailed active sites and mechanisms to further improve performance. Third, the performance of carbons was determined by the structure, and the structure of MOF-derived carbons largely depended on the parent MOFs having controllable shapes, particle sizes, porosities, and crystal structures. The development of new types of MOFs is very critical for the success of MOF-derived carbons, and we hope to find a new structure of MOF-derived carbons with improved performance and diverse applications by the assistance of chemistry in the design of new MOFs, promoting to reveal the relationships between the MOFs and morphological control of carbons. Fourth, additional in situ characterizations such as in situ XAS, EXAFS, and FT-IR should be performed to better understand the inner structures of such MOF-derived carbons, structural variations during the reaction, and relationship between the carbon structure and functions. The observation of the dynamic reaction mechanism, particularly for carbons with other heteroatoms, and in situ characterization were believed to pave the way for understanding the formation mechanism of MOF-derived carbons and subsequently developing highly efficient carbons for specific applications. Finally, the exploration of MOF-derived carbons for other types of applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and medicine detection was also believed to be promising, considering the large surface areas of MOF-derived carbons with abundant active sites and defects in the structure.
