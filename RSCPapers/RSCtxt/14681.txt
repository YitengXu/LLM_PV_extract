    , Accepted 24th January 2017First published on 24th January 2017AbstractA large-grained perovskite film, with a crystal grain size of ca. 30–50 μm, was achieved by polyoxometalate-induced Ostwald ripening. Aiming at commercially-oriented fully printable hole-conductor-free perovskite solar cells, the power conversion efficiency of the device was significantly improved from 9.17% to 11.35% (average) via polyoxometalate molecular doping. This is because the large-grained perovskite film could effectively reduce bulk defects and charge recombination, thereby facilitating charge transport.
Organometallic halide-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise as a low-cost, highly-efficient photovoltaic technology, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has taken a giant leap from an initial 3.8% to a record 22.1%.1,2
To meet commercial requirements, the development of cost-efficient PSCs with high performances has become the object of ongoing research. To reduce the manufacturing costs for large-scale production, a reasonable selection of low-cost, easily processable materials (carbon or conducting polymers) as counter electrodes (CEs), instead of noble metals (Au or Ag) as well as substitutes for expensive and unstable hole-transport materials (HTM) are necessary.3 Han et al. developed a fully printable hole-conductor-free PSC architecture with low cost and easily processable carbon-based CEs, achieving a relatively high efficiency and stability.4 Although the efficiency of Han's PSC device was still below that of the state-of-the-art cells using HTMs and Au metal, the Han's device structure provided a good balance of production cost and performance (long-term stability and efficiency), thereby making it a promising candidate for prospective commercialization of PSCs.
It is well-known that highly crystalline perovskite films with a tunable morphology play a key role in improving the performance of PSCs.5 Moreover, the performance of perovskite films is heavily dependent on crystal grain size because the grain boundaries can cause an increased charge recombination and series resistance due to the large density of charge traps.6 Undoubtedly, the growth of large-grained perovskite films is beneficial for reducing bulk recombination, increasing carrier diffusion length, decreasing trap density and attenuating intergranular impedance; these positive factors greatly facilitate charge transport.7 Moreover, it is expected that large-grained perovskite film growth may bring a comprehensively enhanced performance including higher PCE, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit density, and stability.
In previous publications, researchers reported the modulation of perovskite film morphology by molecular doping, involving the addition of chemicals, such as CH3NH3Cl, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), polymers or H2O3P(CH2)4NH3Cl, to a perovskite precursor solution.8 Although these compounds present a remarkable ability to tune the perovskite morphology, they are neither useful to inject electrons into the electron transport layer nor able to extract electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of a perovskite sensitizer. Hence, finding bifunctional materials that boost charge transfer and control morphology is highly desired for further improving the performance of PSCs.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a large family of molecular metal–oxo cluster compounds, are mainly composed of Mo, W, V and O atoms. Despite their applications in catalysis, materials science and medicine,9 the most intriguing property of POMs is that of acting as an electron acceptor that is able to separate the photogenerated excitons effectively, enhancing the PCE. Vasilopoulou et al. demonstrated the use of POMs as an electron extraction layer in organic optoelectronic devices.10 Furthermore, we explored the photoconductive performance of the PW12/CH3NH3PbI3 composite and achieved a significantly enhanced photoconduction and photodetection performance.11 These performance enhancement was attributed to the key role of POM in separating the photogenerated charges and reducing electron–hole recombination. Inspired by the superior properties of POMs, in this study, we introduced POMs into the perovskite material with the aim to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the Han's fully printable PSC device. The device containing PW12 exhibited a PCE of 11.35%, which was a 24% increase with respect to the PCE of the control device (9.17%). More interestingly, for the first time, we found that in the presence of PW12, a typical Ostwald ripening process occurred during crystal grain growth of the perovskite film; larger grains merged with emerging small grains, and hence charge recombination was suppressed. We believe that a POM-induced Ostwald ripening should be the main cause for such a growth process of perovskite grains. Thus, the POM-induced Ostwald ripening may have other applications in perovskite-based photovoltaics, light-emitting and optoelectronic devices.

Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the PSC device. The corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device is shown in Fig. 1b. All of the films, including the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer, the ZrO2 insulating layer, and the mesoscopic carbon CE, were screen-printed layer by layer onto the FTO glass substrate.

The SEM image showing a cross-section of the PSC device and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The synthesis and deposition of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 perovskite was carried out by one drop-coating of the precursor solution onto the carbon layer. The PW12-modified precursor solution was prepared in the same manner except for the addition of PW12 into the pristine perovskite precursor. The IR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the PW12/perovskite composite demonstrated the presence of the molecular structures and their optical absorption property. As shown in Fig. 1c, the matching energy levels of the device structure are capable of leading to both the photoexcited electron extraction from (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3(−3.9 eV) to the TiO2 conduction band (−4.0 eV) and the hole collection from the (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 valence band (−5.4 eV) to the carbon CE (−5.0 eV). The molecular structure of PW12 and the crystal structure of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 are shown in Fig. 1d.
The influence of PW12 on the morphology of the perovskite film on the mp-TiO2 layer could be observed in the SEM images. The corresponding grain size distributions are given in Fig. 3. For the perovskite film without PW12, the film surface appeared as the aggregation of small grains with several grain boundaries (Fig. 2a), and these perovskite crystal grains exhibited irregular crystallites with a relatively rough surface and multiple interfacial areas (Fig. 2c). Clearly, the film is composed of interconnected microscale crystals with a small size of around 5 μm, and numerous gaps between grain boundaries can be observed. The gaps existing between perovskite grains may cause an increase in intergranular impedance and trap density; this is detrimental to charge carrier transfer because the photogenerated charges have to go through several grain boundaries before being collected by the electrodes. For the perovskite film with PW12, obtained under the same conditions, the grains grew up to a larger size and the small grains merged into the larger grains, such that the gaps between grain boundaries and the interfacial area were reduced, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. Furthermore, the perovskite film surface containing PW12 exhibited a more uniform morphology and larger crystal grains with an average size of 30 μm, indicating a drastically enhanced growth of the perovskite crystals. As confirmed by several reported results, a perovskite film with a large grain distribution and reduced interfacial area offers better conditions for high-performance PSCs because large grains reduce charge trapping and eliminate charge recombination.6,7 Moreover, larger grains present relatively less bulk defects and enable a higher mobility; this promotes charge transport and collection, as the charge travels through a single grain without encountering grain boundaries and charge traps. From the elemental mapping images of Pb and P (Fig. 2e and f), it can be seen that PW12 is uniformly distributed throughout the perovskite film. Clearly, the abovementioned phenomenon could well be related with the occurrence of an Ostwald ripening process induced by POM. Although the ability of POMs to facilitate electron transfer and retard charge recombination had been previously demonstrated, the phenomenon of POM-induced Ostwald ripening had not been reported before.

Taking into consideration the characteristics of PW12 and the perovskite grain boundaries, we proposed the following explanation for the POM-induced Ostwald ripening. Spherical PW12 anions contain 36 surface oxygen atoms, including 12 terminal oxygen atoms with excess electron density (negative electrostatic field) that have a strong driving force to capture H+ for protonation.12a For the perovskite grain boundaries, the stable vacant terminations have to expose the CH3NH3+ and HOOC(CH2)4NH3+ cations.12b During perovskite grain growth, the small grains with large interfacial curvature have a significant interfacial energy. The electrostatic interactions between PW12 anions and CH3NH3+ or HOOC(CH2)4NH3+ cations from the vacant terminations of perovskite grain boundaries could readily facilitate the Ostwald ripening process, in which larger grains grow at the expense of small grains to reduce the interfacial energy associated with the overall free energy of the two-phase system.
In addition, the POM-induced crystallinity change was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. S3 (ESI†) displays the XRD patterns of the perovskite film with and without PW12. The main diffraction peaks at 5.8°, 14.12°, 28.50°, 32.01°, 40.1°, and 43.26° were assigned to the (001), (110), (220), (310), (224), and (314) diffraction planes, confirming the tetragonal crystal structure of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3.4c The perovskite–PW12 composite exhibited stronger diffraction peak intensities when increasing the concentration from 10 mg ml−1 to 20 mg ml−1, indicating a higher degree of crystallinity at a higher PW12 content. This revealed that PW12 was also able to enhance the crystallinity of the large-grained perovskite film.
The charge transport properties of the larger grain size films were investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL). As shown in Fig. 4c, the PL intensity of the perovskite–PW12 composite increased gradually with increasing PW12 concentration, suggesting that the large-grained perovskite film with improved crystallinity induced by PW12 could reduce the surface and bulk defects and facilitate charge transfer, such that non-radiative decay was remarkably suppressed. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was measured to investigate the charge transfer and recombination lifetime in the perovskite film (Fig. 4d). All the PL curves were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, according to a previous report,13 and the detailed lifetime (τ1, τ2), the corresponding fractions (f) as well as the average lifetime (τ) are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The PL curves were measured at the PL emission peak (780 nm) with a bi-exponential decay function, revealing a fast decay (τ1) component, which originated from bimolecular recombination, and a slow decay (τ2) component, which could be attributed to the radiative recombination of free carriers.13 From Fig. 4d, we can observe a continuous increase in the average lifetime with increasing PW12 concentration, indicating a lower degree of bulk recombination than in perovskite without PW12. Moreover, both the τ2 and f2 were gradually increased with PW12 addition, suggesting that the quenching of photogenerated charges was dominated by radiative recombination rather than bimolecular recombination.

The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are presented in Fig. 4(a and b). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a, the control device fabricated from the pristine perovskite precursor exhibited a PCE of 9.17%. The device containing 10 mg ml−1 of PW12 showed a moderately improved PCE, of 9.67%. Notably, the device containing 15 mg ml−1 of PW12 exhibited a PCE of 11.35%, which represented a 24% enhancement compared to that of the control device (9.17%), together with a significantly enhanced Jsc of 22.57 mA cm−2. This was consistent with the increased EQE, as shown in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that the device fabricated with the perovskite precursor containing 15 mg ml−1 of PW12 displayed an excellent photocurrent response, and the maximum EQE peaks reached 80%, whereas the maximum EQE peaks of the control device only reached 60%. However, as the concentration of PW12 was further increased to 20 mg ml−1, the PCE slightly decreased as compared with that of the device containing 15 mg ml−1; this may be because the electric resistance of the excess PW12 caused a negative effect. In addition, a little Voc loss was also observed for PW12 concentrations higher than 10 mg ml−1. We considered that the slight Voc loss might have been due to the excess PW12 having a negative effect on the built-in electric field strength in the TiO2/perovskite interface region; this would have led to the increase of the radiative recombination and reduced the energy difference of the quasi-Fermi levels between TiO2 and perovskite, resulting in a negative effect on Voc.12 Notably, the Jsc increased from 18.00 to 22.57 mA cm−2 by introducing PW12 because a larger grain size with a reduced grain boundary area could efficiently decrease charge trapping and thus improve charge transfer.8b To check the reproducibility of the PW12-based devices, 20 control devices and 20 PW12-based PSCs were randomly selected to form histogram plots of photovoltaic parameters (Fig. S4, ESI†). The PW12-based PSCs exhibited an average PCE of 11.35% with a small deviation, indicating a good reproducibility. Furthermore, PW12-based PSCs exhibited a good long-term stability (Fig. S8, ESI†) with negligible loss (<3%) in PCE.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and hole-only devices were used for investigating the kinetics of the interfacial charge transfer processes in the PSCs. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the Nyquist plots display a large semicircle in the low-frequency region, which was related to the interfacial and/or bulk recombination resistance (Rrec) between mesoporous TiO2 and the perovskite layer. The small semicircle in the high-frequency region was assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rsc) at the interface of the CE and the perovskite layer.4a In comparison with the control device, the PW12-based device displayed a smaller semicircle in the high-frequency region, indicating a decreased Rsc at the perovskite/CE interface, which benefited from the large grain growth in the perovskites. Furthermore, the PW12-based device displayed a larger semicircle in the low frequency region, indicating an increased Rrec at the TiO2/perovskite interface. These results demonstrated that the addition of PW12 to perovskite can boost charge carrier transport and decrease charge recombination, which is consistent with the conductivity enhancement observed in the PW12-based hole-only device (Fig. S9, ESI†). The large grain growth resulting from the POM-induced Ostwald ripening can effectively improve crystallinity and greatly reduce surface boundaries and bulk defects, which are potential charge recombination centers.
In summary, based on the hole-conductor-free and fully printable PSC device, we introduced a POM (PW12) into the hybrid perovskite (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 for enhancing the performance of PSCs. As a result, the device containing PW12 exhibited a PCE of 11.35%, which was a 24% increase with respect to the PCE of the control device (9.17%). Although the PCE of 11.35% is lower than the record PCE of the updated PSC, it is notable that the hole-conductor-free, fully printable PSC device is of low-cost and has an easily processable pattern, which makes it a promising device for commercialization. More interestingly, we found that the addition of PW12 to perovskite could induce the growth of larger grains at the expense of small grains, a typical Ostwald ripening process, yielding larger grains with an average size of 30 μm. The large-grained perovskite film with higher crystallinity has certainly less crystal grain defects and facilitates charge transport. Therefore, the large-grained perovskite film growth induced by POM should be mainly responsible for the enhanced performance. Moreover, the POM-induced Ostwald ripening may have further applications in perovskite-based functional devices.
