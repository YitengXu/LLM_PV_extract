    , Accepted 25th January 2015First published on 26th January 2015AbstractFluorinated quinoxaline units are attractive acceptor blocks for building low band gap photovoltaic polymers. In this contribution, two novel fluorinated quinoxaline-based copolymers, PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ, have been successfully synthesized by combination of cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) or dithienosilole (DTS) donor blocks in the polymeric backbones. The bridging atom effect shows a great influence on the absorption properties, energy level, carrier mobility as well as photovoltaic performance. PDTSBFQ with Si bridging atoms shows a little blue-shift in the UV-vis absorption, and a little larger band gap than PCPDTBFQ. However, PDTSBFQ shows a stronger aggregation even in the solution state. Compared with carbon, silica atoms afforded PDTSBFQ with a lower-lying HOMO level, suggesting a high Voc for polymer solar cells (PSCs). PDTSBFQ also exhibits better crystallinity and molecular ordering properties than PCPDTBFQ from the XRD study. The hole-only device based on PDTSBFQ exhibited a higher hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of 4.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCPDTBFQ. Conventional PSCs were fabricated to investigate the bridging atom effect on the photovoltaic properties of these two copolymers. Different interfacial layers (IFLs) of Ca and PFN had been tried to optimize the performance of the fabricated PSCs. When using a Ca/Al top electrode, PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices showed PCEs of 2.16% and 4.43%, respectively. The better performance of the PDTSBFQ device can be attributed to the improvements in its Voc, Jsc and FF values just by choosing silica bridging atoms. After replacing the Ca/Al with a PFN/Al cathode, the performance of both PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices was enhanced largely. The PDTSBFQ device achieved the highest PCE of 5.92% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 12.25 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.63. The primary results gave a simple but efficient strategy to design high performance dithiophene-quinoxaline polymer donors for organic solar cell applications.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting considerable interest due to many advantages, including the thin-film architecture and low material consumption resulting from a high absorption coefficient, efficient wet-process, and low manufacturing energy requirement. Meanwhile, their low specific weight, mechanical flexibility, tunable material properties, and high transparency endow them with vast potential applications for future development.1 The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) device, which involves an interpenetrating network of electron donor (conjugated polymers) and acceptor materials (fullerene derivatives) in the active layer, is known as one of the most efficient types of PSCs for satisfactorily addressing the issue of exciton disassociation.1a,2 With so many kinds of good materials and wonderful process techniques having been discovered and developed for the last two decades, the improvements in the device performance have been driven to achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 9%.3
In search for high performance PSCs, the design and synthesis of new π-conjugated organic semiconductors have been a hot topic of great research interest for the past few years.4 From the view point of π-conjugated polymer design, the donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating motif, combining electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) subunits, is considered to be a well established approach to attain high efficiency.5 By developing different donor and/or acceptor units and incorporating them with rational counterparts, the optical absorption properties and band gap could be finely tuned, resulting from different inter- or intramolecular charge (ICT) and π–π* transition processes.6 Among them, the low band gap (LBG) copolymer may be the most successful candidate, aiming at achieving broad absorption, high hole mobility, and a suitable energy level.2b,6a,7 However, a low band gap does not necessarily guarantee high performance. Many copolymers feature low band gaps, but the relative narrow range of solar spectrum absorption limits their performance. The tandem device architecture can provide an effective way to solve the above problem, which employs two or more semiconductors with different band gaps enabling absorption over a broad range of photon energies,2b,3b,8 but more combined active layers involve more complex processing procedures, which require more advanced technical support and increase the overall fabrication cost. Furthermore, lowering the band gap may cause a rise in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, resulting in a low open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.9 In this regard, a “weak donor–strong acceptor” strategy was proposed to simultaneously lower the HOMO energy level and maintain the low band gap, as required by the ideal polymer donors.10 A series of such materials have been successfully demonstrated with high efficiency in typical BHJ devices.3c,4b,7,11 The PCEs for single junction BHJ devices based on LBG copolymers have already broken the 9% milestone.3c,12
The quinoxaline (Qx) skeleton has been extensively studied in recent years as a strong electron deficient unit for building high performance LBG copolymers.13 In addition, the incorporation of the electron withdrawing fluorine atom onto the Qx moiety has become more and more attractive.14 Because of many unique characteristics, such as the use of the most electronegative element, the smallest electron-withdrawing group, and a great influence on inter- and/or intramolecular interactions through secondary bonds,11c fluorinated conjugated polymers and their devices exhibit improved thermal and oxidative stability and elevated resistance to degradation.15 More important than that the Voc, short circuit density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) as well as PCE can be simultaneously improved.14a,16 Our previous work focused on benzodithiophene (BDT) and fluorinated Qx copolymers has demonstrated a good example of efficient tuning of the thermal stability, absorption range, energy level, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties by side chain engineering of both the branching degree and dimensionality.17 To achieve higher performance, other good donor blocks should be tried to balance and optimize the relationship between the molecular structure and the photovoltaic properties. On the other hand, cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) and dithienosilole (DTS) are typical weak donor units, which have been used for constructing efficient LBG photovoltaic materials. Polymers based on these two blocks exhibit good solubility and thermal properties, good crystallinity, excellent morphology and high efficiency.11b,d,18 Furthermore, they are also endowed with a larger optical absorption coefficient than BDT counterparts.18d,19 It is expected that CPDT and DTS based polymers can show a more satisfied performance when copolymerized with fluorinated Qx. However, only a few CPDT-Qx and DTS-Qx copolymers have been reported, letting alone the fluorinated Qx block.20
Based on the above considerations, we report here the synthesis and characterization of two novel fluorinated Qx based copolymers, PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ (Scheme 1), in which two different weak donor units of CPDT and DTS with similar π-conjugated backbones have been incorporated in the main chains. By taking advantage of the “weak donor–strong acceptor” strategy and the benefits of the fluorine atom, an improvement of the device performance would be expected in such a D–A system. The bridging atom effect was also investigated in detail on the optical and photovoltaic properties. On replacing the bridging carbon atom by a silicon atom, PDTSBFQ exhibits a higher thermal stability, more ordered molecular organization, and more superior nanoscale phase splitting structure when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). A high PCE of 5.92% was obtained for the PDTSBFQ device in a conventional structure.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the copolymers are shown in Scheme 2. The BFQ and organic tin monomers were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.17,21PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ were then prepared through Stille-coupling polymerization in good yields, using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 as a catalyst system. The crude polymers were precipitated into methanol and filtered, followed by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform to remove byproducts and oligomers. The purified copolymers were obtained and collected from the chloroform fraction by precipitation into methanol again. The chemical structures of target copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The two polymers exhibit an excellent film-casting property and good solubility in some common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDI) of the two polymers were measured at 35 °C by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the internal standard. The Mn values of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ were determined to be 16.0 and 34.1 kDa, respectively. The PDI of PCPDTBFQ is 2.2, but for PDTSBFQ, the PDI is relatively high up to 6.5, which might be overestimated because of the strong aggregation property of PDTSBFQ in organic solution even at room temperature.21e,22 In order to confirm this speculation, the molecular weights were further measured using high temperature GPC. The Mn of PDTSBFQ was determined at 80 °C to be about 13.6 kDa with a relatively narrow PDI of 2.7. The aggregation phenomenon could also be confirmed from the UV-vis spectra (vide infra).

The thermal properties of conjugated polymers play a very important role in PSCs. The thermal stability was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 1a, the degradation temperatures (Td) of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ with 5% weight loss were measured to be about 421 and 430 °C, respectively. Using Si bridging atoms can improve the thermal stability of these fluorinated Qx based copolymers, which is beneficial for device fabrication and evaluation. On the other hand, no endo- or exothermal signals were observed in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements in the range of 0–230 °C from the second heating run (Fig. 1b), implying that these two polymers are thermally robust. The molecular weights and the thermal analysis results are listed in Table 1.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption properties of these two polymers were measured in solutions and thin solid films. We first investigated the UV-vis absorption in chloroform solution with a concentration of 10−5 M. As shown in Fig. 2a, it is interesting to find that PDTSBFQ shows a slightly red-shift than PCPDTBFQ in solution. This is likely ascribed to the strong aggregation of PDTSBFQ in solution. To verify this assumption, we diluted the polymer solution to a small concentration of 10−6 M. By this treatment, the absorption of PDTSBFQ was blue-shifted distinctly by about 8 nm of the maximum absorption peak. When this solution was heated to 60 °C, this shift became larger to about 25 nm (Fig. 2b). However, when adopting the same conditions, the maximum absorption peaks were almost steadfast for PCPDTBFQ, with only a little blue shift of the maximum peak and edge absorption during dilute and heat processes. The film absorption profile of PDTSBFQ shows more multiple well defined transitions, whereas that of PCPDTBFQ remains broad. A plausible explanation for that may be greater molecular order in PDTSBFQ backbones, which leads to better interchromophore electronic coupling. This is consistent with previous literature findings where polymers containing Si bridged DTS possess a higher degree of solid-state crystallinity than C bridged CPDT.18c,d,23,24 The result is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile measurements (vide infra). Compared to the BDT based polymers,17 the remarkable red-shift makes them have narrower band gaps, which can be expected to induce an elevation of the short circuit current density (Jsc) of their PSCs. Both PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ showed a strong ICT transition absorption peak in the region of 500 to 700 nm, and their optical energy band gaps (Eoptg) could be calculated to be 1.60 eV and 1.63 eV, respectively (Table 2). To further investigate the concentration and temperature effects on the intermolecular interactions of these two polymers, we normalized the absorption data by the highest electronic vibration energy peaks (Fig. 2c and 2d). It is interesting to note that the two polymers have an absolutely different variation tendency. When the solution was diluted and heated, the solution maximum absorption peak of PDTSBFQ blue-shifted and the intensity declined in the meantime, which is attributed to breakup of the intrachain aggregates.18b,25 However, no distinct change was found for PCPDTBFQ with the same treatments, which signified insusceptible intramolecular interactions in which the molecular structure of the backbone governed the optical features.18b The strong and impressionable intramolecular interactions of PDTSBFQ make it possible for us to do more post-optimization, which would favor its high performance in photovoltaic applications.

Electrochemical properties
The energy levels are crucial for the selection of appropriate acceptors in BHJ PSCs.26 The HOMO and LUMO levels of the copolymers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). CV measurements were carried out on a CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a 0.1 mol L−1 solution of Bu4NClO4 in anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated CH3CN. A platinum plate coated with a thin film of the studied copolymers was used as the working electrode. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) system to be 4.34 eV in this work.27 As shown in Fig. 3a, both polymers exhibited reversible oxidation and reduction waves, implying their good abilities in transporting positive and negative charges.28 From the onset potentials, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.08 and −3.35 eV for PCPDTBFQ, and −5.18 and −3.31 eV for PDTSBFQ, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps are then calculated to be 1.73 and 1.87 eV for PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ, respectively. The difference between the optical and electrochemical band gaps could be explained by the exciton binding energy of the copolymers and/or the interfacial barriers for charge injection.29 Compared to the BDT counterparts,17 the two polymers show significant reduction of LUMO with slightly increasing HOMO levels. PDTSBFQ has almost the same HOMO level as PBDTAB-BFQ with BDT blocks in our previous work.17 It is well known that Voc is directly proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of a polymer donor and the LUMO energy level of a fullerene derivative.30 Therefore, replacing the BDT units with DTS lowers the band gap but maintains the deep-lying HOMO level, giving rise to an enhancement of the overall device performance.31 To make a clear comparison, the electronic energy level diagrams of the polymers and PC71BM are described in Fig. 3b. The LUMO gaps of 0.65–0.69 eV and HOMO gaps of 1.08–1.18 eV between the polymers and PC71BM should provide a sufficient driving force to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation at the D–A interface, which would ensure energetically favorable electron transfer.32

Theoretical calculations
To evaluate the bridging atom effect of the donor skeletons on the molecular architectures and electronic properties of the resulting polymers, DFT calculations were performed to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single-point energies, at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.14b,15,33 Three repeating units of the copolymers were studied as the model compounds for simulations of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ. To simplify the calculations, long alkyl chains were replaced by the methyl group because they did not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries and electronic properties.14b,15,33 The HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the model compounds are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen clearly from the optimized molecular backbone that the Si bridged trimer adopts a more linear geometry, while it is more twisted for the C bridged trimer, which is also different from the zigzag geometry for BDT incorporated trimers.17,34 The linear molecular chain of PDTSBFQ is in favor of more ordered organization and higher degree of crystallinity. The HOMOs feature extended delocalization along the entire conjugated backbones. The electron density mainly distributes in the middle part of the conjugated molecular skeleton, which is affected by both the donor and acceptor units. However, the LUMOs are mainly focused on the Qx skeletons, resulting from the effect of the acceptor units. Compared with the HOMO and LUMO, the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 seem to be distributed from the middle part to two side parts, which indicates that the internal charge transfer is possible in these conjugated systems. Thus, low band gaps of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ can be obtained by the efficient internal charge-transfer processes from donor segments to acceptor segments. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ trimers were calculated to be −4.39/−2.45 and −4.44/−2.45 eV, respectively. The calculated band gaps were then determined to be 1.94, and 1.99 eV. From the calculation results, the bridging atom effect on the band gaps and energy levels is similar to those results obtained from CV and UV/vis evaluation. That is, the introduction of Si atoms will efficiently deepen the HOMO energy level and slightly increase the band gap.

Crystallinity and hole mobility
The crystallinity and molecular ordering properties of the copolymer films were investigated by XRD analysis. Fig. 5a shows the XRD patterns of the corresponding polymer films cast from solutions in chlorobenzene (CB). As shown in Fig. 5a, the first peaks that are around 3.55° and 3.80° for PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ, respectively, are assignable to (100) diffraction of a lamellar structure. The d-spacing distance can be calculated to be about 24.9 Å and 23.2 Å. The shorter d-spacing distance and stronger diffraction peak were found for the PDTSBFQ film, indicating a more ordered and tight packing in its solid state, which may result from the more linear molecular chains observed from the theoretical calculations. The broad (010) diffraction peaks give the information on π-stacking properties. PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ films peak at about 20.5° and 22.0°, featuring the π-stacking distances of 4.3 Å and 4.0 Å, respectively. It is clear that replacing the bridging C atom with a Si atom makes DTS-containing polymers favor a more planar geometry and a high degree of crystallinity.18c,dPDTSBFQ also shows a slight (200) diffraction around 7.5°, which manifests again its excellent crystallinity as well.

The hole mobility of the active layer has a positive effect on the Jsc and fill factor (FF) of the resulting PSCs. Higher hole mobility is favorable in photovoltaic application because it can enable better carrier transport without a large photocurrent loss caused by recombination of opposite charges.35 To evaluate the vertical charge carrier mobility, we fabricated hole-only devices to determine the space charge limited current (SCLC). This type of device was fabricated with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)/polymer/MoO3/Au. The hole mobility can be calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation.35Fig. 5b shows the voltage (V)–current density (J) curves of the hole-only devices of the copolymer blends. The hole mobilities of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ were calculated to be 4.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PDTSBFQ film exhibits a higher mobility than the PCPDTBFQ film, which is attributed to its better crystallinity and molecular packing properties, as described by the XRD analysis. The larger mobility of the PDTSBFQ film is also highly desirable with respect to the increasing Jsc of its PSC devices.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ, PSCs were first fabricated and evaluated with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The device performance was generally influenced by some processing parameters, such as the type of solvent, the blend ratio of the copolymer and PC71BM, the annealing temperature, and the usage of processing additives. The optimal weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM was found to be 1:1 (w/w). 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the blend solution to optimize the morphology of the active layer. In this work, the thermal annealing process had no role in improving the device performance. The active layers were finally spin-coated from the polymer solutions with PC71BM in CB, while the PFN interlayer was spin-coated from its methanol solution. All PSCs were tested under simulated illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 6a, and the data of photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 6a, the PDTSBFQ device with a Ca interlayer exhibited a Voc of 0.75 V, which is 0.4 V higher than that of the PCPDTBFQ device. The elevated Voc value is related to the lower-lying HOMO level of this polymer, measured from the CV experiments. The Jsc values of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices were 7.37 and 10.40 mA cm−2, respectively. Generally, the Jsc is often affected by many factors, including the absorption properties of the active layer and the charge carrier mobility. The higher Jsc is in good agreement with the higher hole mobility of PDTSBFQ determined from SCLC measurements (4.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCPDTBFQ and 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDTSBFQ). The improved Jsc was also confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) evaluation. As shown in Fig. 6b, the photocurrent response of both devices covered the range of 300–800 nm. But PDTSBFQ showed a little broader but much higher curve shape. The maximum EQE plateau of PDTSBFQ reached 53%, which was higher than that of PCPDTBFQ (38%), resulting in more efficient light harvesting and higher Jsc values as well. Furthermore, the Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE curves with an AM 1.5 G reference spectrum are within 3% error compared to the corresponding Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. Obviously, the better optical response and higher carrier mobility guarantee the PDTSBFQ device to achieve a larger Jsc value. The elevation of sixteen percentage points in FF had also been obtained for the PDTSBFQ device (FF = 0.57) compared with the PCPDTBFQ device (FF = 0.41). The result can be attributed to the formation of the optimal blend film morphology. The surface morphology of the polymer:PC71BM film was checked by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM height (left) and phase (right) images are shown in Fig. 7. The blend films of PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ showed different morphological properties. The average surface roughness values (Ra) measured from the topographic images were 1.15 and 2.02 nm for PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ blend films, respectively, casting from the CB solution at a ratio of 1:1 (by adding 3% DIO). The Ra of the PDTSBFQ blend film is about 1.8 fold more than that of the PCPDTBFQ film. However, the PCPDTBFQ film possesses a poorer nanoscale phase separation (see the phase images). The aggregate size of the PCPDTBFQ film reached more than one hundred nanometer scale, which is much bigger than that of the PDTSBFQ film. This is due to the bad compatibility of PCPDTBFQ and PC71BM. In contrast, the aggregate size in the PDTSBFQ blend film was in the ideal region of 10–20 nm, which would not cause strong geminate recombination, giving rise to a higher FF and a more efficient EQE of PDTSBFQ devices. This result also indicated that the bridging atom effect had a distinct influence on the compatibility and aggregation of the blend counterparts. As a result, 4.43% PCE of the PDTSBFQ device was achieved, which was about 2 times the PDTSBFQ device (2.16%) under the same conditions.

The PFN interfacial layer could largely elevate the photovoltaic performance of a group of N-heterocycle-containing polymer donors.36 In order to study the effect of different top electrodes, we fabricated another type of PSC device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al. After using a PFN/Al instead of the Ca/Al top cathode, the PSCs based on both copolymers exhibited a largely enhanced performance. PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices showed PCEs of 3.23% and 5.92%, respectively, which had a great increase of 50% and 34% in comparison with those with a Ca/Al cathode. Comparing both types of devices, the Voc just elevated a little. So the increased PCEs were mainly attributed to the improvements of Jsc and FF. For PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices, the Jsc values were increased from 7.37 to 8.55 mA cm−2, and from 10.39 to 12.25 mA cm−2. But the FF values were largely increased from 0.41 to 0.57 and 0.52 to 0.63 for PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices, respectively. This elevation of Jsc and FF was also checked using EQE curves, as shown in Fig. 6b. The maximum EQE values were raised from 38% to 43%, and 53% to 63%, for PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices, respectively. Clearly, PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ contain enough N atoms, leading to strong N–N interactions at the interface between the polymers and the PFN layer.36 Such a polar effect can establish good interface contact with the Al cathode, enhancing the electron extraction from the acceptor phase to the metal cathode and decreasing the hole–electron recombination in the active layer. As a result, enhanced Jsc and FF values were obtained to achieve a high PCE around 6% in PSCs for DTS-FQx conjugated copolymers.
Conclusion
Two novel fluorinated quinoxaline-based alternating copolymers, PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ, have been successfully synthesized and characterized, incorporated with C-bridged cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) or Si-bridged dithienosilole (DTS) blocks. The bridging atom effect showed a great influence on the absorption properties, energy level, carrier mobility and photovoltaic performance of the resulting copolymers. When using the DTS block instead of CPDT, PDTSBFQ showed a little blue-shift as well as a little larger band gap than those of PCPDTBFQ. However, PDTSBFQ showed unique aggregation even in the solution state. The electrochemical results indicated that PDTSBFQ had a lower-lying HOMO level, implying that a high Voc could be obtained in its PSCs. From XRD analysis, PDTSBFQ also exhibited better crystallinity and molecular ordering properties than PCPDTBFQ, which induced a higher hole mobility (1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDTSBFQ and 4.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCPDTBFQ) measured by the SCLC method. BHJ solar cell devices were finally fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of these two copolymers. The different interfacial layer (IFL) had also been tried to optimize the performance of the fabricated PSCs. When using a Ca/Al top electrode, the PDTSBFQ device showed a PCE of 4.43% while the PCPDTBFQ device just had a lower PCE of 2.16%. This enhancement can be due to the elevations of Voc, Jsc and FF values. After replacing the Ca/Al with a PFN/Al cathode, the performance of both PCPDTBFQ and PDTSBFQ devices was enhanced largely. Then, the PDTSBFQ device achieved the highest PCE of 5.92%. All these results confirmed our design strategy and afforded a simple but efficient approach to obtain high performance dithiophene-quinoxaline polymer donors by the bridging atom effect and fluorinated substitution.
Experimental section
Measurements and characterization
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 400 NMR spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Elemental analysis was performed using a Carlo Erba 116 elemental analyzer. Molecular weights of the copolymers were determined using a Waters 1515 GPC with chloroform as the eluent at 35 °C and 80 °C, and polystyrene as the standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Carry 300 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out at room temperature on a CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an anhydrous nitrogen saturated acetonitrile solution (0.1 mol−1) of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4). The redox couple of ferrocene/ferrocenium ions (Fc/Fc+) was used as an external standard. The copolymers were coated on the platinum plate working electrodes from dilute chloroform solutions. XRD patterns of the polymers were recorded on a Philips X-ray diffractometer operated in reflection geometry at 30 mA, 40 kV with CuKα radiation. The AFM measurements were performed on a Veeco Nanoscope V microscope in tapping mode.
PSC device fabrication and characterization
PSCs were fabricated with ITO glass (15 Ω cm−2) as the anode, Ca/Al or PFN/Al as the cathode, and the active layer of the copolymer and PC71BM as the photosensitive layer. After spin-coating a 35 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083) onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate, the photosensitive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating the solution (by adding 3% DIO) of the copolymer and PC71BM (w/w) in CB on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The device area was 0.09 cm2. I–V characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measurement system. The EQE values were measured at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford, SR830 DSP) during illumination with monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored by using a standard Si solar cell. The thickness of the films was measured by using a Dektak 6M surface profilometer. All fabrication and characterization processes, except for the EQE measurements, were conducted in a glove box.
Materials
All chemicals purchased were of reagent grade from Aladdin, Adamas, Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, and Acros Chemical Co., and used without further purification. All solvents were freshly distilled immediately prior to use. Monomer BFQ and the other two organic tin monomers were synthesized according to the procedures in the published literature.17,21
PCPDTBFQ
5,5′-Bis(tributylstannyl)-4,4-dioctyl-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (0.2942 g, 0.3000 mmol), monomer BFQ (0.2628 g, 0.3000 mmol), and degassed toluene (12 mL) were added into a two-necked flask. After being degassed with argon several times, Pd2(dba)3 (5.5 mg, 2 mol%) and P(o-tol)3 (7.3 mg, 8%) were added and the solution was degassed with argon several times again. The reaction solution was subsequently heated to 110 °C for 24 h. Tributylstannylthiophene (23.7 mL) was added to the reaction and then after 2 h, 2-bromothiophene (7.5 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. The reactant mixture was slowly dropped into methanol (400 mL) to allow precipitation of the crude polymer. The precipitate was then filtered, and washed with methanol and hexane in Soxhlet apparatus to remove oligomers and the catalyst residue. Finally, the copolymer was extracted with chloroform. The solution was condensed by evaporation and precipitated into methanol again. The purified PCPDTBFQ was then collected as a dark-purple solid (0.28 g, 83%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 8.2–6.7 (m, 15H, ArH), 4.1–3.7 (m, 4H, –O–CH2–), 2.1–1.0 (m, 52H, –CH2–), 1.0–0.7 (m, 12H, –CH3). Anal. calcd (%) for (C69H83O2N2S4F)n: C 74.02, H 7.47, N 2.50; found: C 73.83, H 7.58, N, 2.27.
PDTSBFQ
Polymer PDTSBFQ was obtained as a dark-purple solid in a yield of 85% from the reaction of 4,4′-bis(n-octyl)-2,2′-bis(tributylstannyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole with monomer BFQ, similar to the procedure described for PCPDTBFQ. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 8.5–6.4 (m, 15H, ArH), 4.1–3.7 (m, 4H, –OCH2–, 4H, –CH2–), 2.0–1.0 (m, 48H, –CH2–), 1.0–0.7 (m, 12H, –CH3). Anal. calcd (%) for (C68H83O2N2S4FSi)n: C 71.91, H 7.37, N 2.47; found: C 72.19, H 7.15, N 2.31.
