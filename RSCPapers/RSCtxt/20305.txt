    , Accepted 28th June 2019First published on 5th July 2019AbstractLead acetate-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown their superiority in terms of controlled grain growth and replacement of traditional lead halides, which is critical for their large-scale commercial applications; however, the lack of control on the grain quality of lead acetate-based perovskite still creates risks such as unwanted defects, pinholes and grain boundaries. Herein, we proposed a reliable method to control the morphology and grain size of lead acetate-based perovskites along with a dynamic solvent-vapor annealing treatment; it was found that the vapors of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) assisted in the growth of perovskite grains and facilitated the increase in grain size. Using optimized DMF volume, the fabricated planar PSCs with the structure FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.71%, which was 23.8% higher than that of the controlled device. Moreover, the hysteresis effect was negligible. The results demonstrate that the solvent vapor-assisted crystal growth process is a simple and facile way to improve the quality of lead acetate-based perovskites and increase their performance.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites as active layers for solar cells have attracted significant attention because of their appealing merits such as excellent light harvesting ability, adjustable spectral absorption range and large diffusion length for charge carriers.1–5 Since the first study on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 24.2% from 3.8% in recent years.6,7 At present, the achievement of high PCE and stability of PSCs is still the chief goal of researchers working towards the development of PSCs; many previous studies have revealed that the film morphology and quality of perovskites definitely affect the PCE of PSCs.8 A high-quality perovskite film with almost full coverage, a smooth top surface, large grain size and less defects is essential to ensure sufficient light harvesting and decrease the shunting loss. On the other hand, a high-quality perovskite film can provide high-speed charge-transport channels and reduce the recombination loss. Therefore, to improve the quality of perovskite films, many methods have been developed by optimizing the preparation methods, selecting new perovskite absorbers, improving the morphology and crystallization.9–13
Recently, perovskite films have been prepared by non-halide lead precursors such as lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2), lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) and lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2).14–16 Moreover, Pb(Ac)2·3H2O has been reported as a promising precursor for efficient PSCs because lead acetate provides a rapid crystallization process, whereas the trihydrate improves the film stability;17,18 furthermore, the facile removal of N-methylammonium acetate (CH3NH3Ac) brings about fast crystal growth of perovskites and leads to the formation of more uniform and high-coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films.14 Qing et al. reported an inverted device structure with a Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS and PCBM that was fabricated in a N2-filled glovebox and exhibited the highest PCE of 10.16% with the active device area of 0.1 cm2.19 On the basis of the Pb(Ac)2 precursor, an inverted planar heterojunction PSC configuration with a perovskite deposited on the PEDOT:PSS layer has been reported by Zhao et al., leading to the PCEs of 13.78% (the active area of 0.07 cm2).20 Subsequently, perovskite absorber layers deposited via the heat-assisted blade coating (HABC) technique have been reported by Kong et al. employing Pb(Ac)2 as a lead source, and the efficiency of 12.4% was achieved (the active area was 0.0925 cm2).21 Moreover, Xu et al. reported that the use of fullerenes as an additive in the mixed precursor of Pb(Ac)2 and PbI2 can reduce hysteresis because of the passivation effect of fullerenes.22 Wei et al. have reported that the acetate group plays an important role in controlling the morphology of perovskites.23 To date, PSCs based on a lead acetate precursor provide a fast crystallization process and show a relatively small grain size, many defects and an obvious hysteresis effect.
According to previous studies, significant efforts, including precursor composition engineering, thermal annealing, solvent annealing and vapor-assisted solution process, have been made towards controlling the quality of organic–inorganic halide perovskite films.24–27 Nowadays, the one-step spin-coating method is used for preparing perovskite films because of its excellent and easy operation.28,29 Due to the quick reaction of PbI2 and MAI and the nucleation and crystal growth process occur simultaneously, the as-prepared perovskite films with a small grain size and defects so on, which resulting in the non-ideal of morphology and crystallinity for perovskite film.30 Solvent annealing is an effective way to improve the morphology and control the surface performance of films. Recently, Liu et al. have annealed perovskite films under different solvent vapor conditions and demonstrated that the solvent vapors have a strong effect on the film growth. Moreover, PSCs based on DMSO-treated films exhibited the PCE of over 13% with negligible photocurrent hysteresis.31 In addition, Tafazoli et al. reported that the perovskite film prepared by sequential deposition methods and vapor-assisted solution process improved the perovskite morphology and decreased residual lead halides, and enhanced the optical absorption and efficiency of PSCs.32
Herein, a low-cost and easily controlled method was developed for the fabrication of pure lead acetate-based PSCs without the use of toxic anti solvents, which could finally provide a methodology to achieve large-area PSCs. The solvent vapor annealing treatment was incorporated to control the grain growth and morphology of the perovskite film, which led to significant improvements in the photophysical properties of the film. Thus, the preparation of high-quality perovskite films with large grain sizes and high fraction of coverage was achieved by the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) vapor, which resulted in the enhanced performance of PSCs. The champion PCE of 13.28% and negligible current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis were achieved with an optimal volume of DMF (15 μL). Moreover, the mechanism of solvent vapor annealing based on a non-halogen lead system proposed in this study was systematically investigated.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Materials and preparation of perovskite precursor solutions
Lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O, 99.95%), methylamine iodide (MAI, 99.5%), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99.5%), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.9%) and 4-tert butylpyridine (tbp, 96%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.8%) and ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Aldrich. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were bought from OPV Tech New Energy Co.
In detail, 1 mmol of Pb(Ac)2·3H2O was mixed with 3 mmol of MAI in 1 mL of anhydrous DMF, and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature.
2.2. Fabrication of planar structure perovskite solar cells
Planar PSCs were fabricated on FTO-coated glass substrates. The FTO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, acetone, deionized water, and ethanol for 15 min. Then, the conductive substrates were dried with a nitrogen stream and treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. The device has the definite structure of FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. A compact layer of TiO2 was spin-coated on top of the FTO glass at 2000 rpm for 50 s, then moved onto a hot plate and maintained at 150 °C; it was then sintered at 500 °C in a muffle furnace for 30 min, followed by treatment with the TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min to ensure reduction in the number of remaining pinholes.33 For the prepared perovskite film, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 4000 rpm for 55 s and then subjected to thermal annealing or solvent vapor annealing at 100 °C. For the solvent vapor annealing film, the perovskite films were placed on top of a hot plate and covered by a glass Petri dish. DMF in different volumes (0 μL, 5 μL, 10 μL, 15 μL, 20 μL, and 25 μL) was added around the substrates during the formation of perovskite films. The processing scheme for the formation of the perovskite film using the solvent-vapor annealing method is shown in Fig. 1. After this, a layer of hole transport material (72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL of tBP were dissolved in 1 mL of CB) was spin-coated on the perovskite active layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s to form the hole transport layer.34,35 Finally, a metallic silver electrode was deposited by the magnetron sputtering technique.

2.3. Characterization
The morphology of the perovskite film was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS EV0MA15). The crystal structure of the perovskite film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, DX-2700, Dandong) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at the scanning rate of 5° min−1. The absorption spectrum of the perovskite film was obtained using a UV–vis spectrometer (UV-2600, SHIMADZU). The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy were performed at 475 nm upon excitation at 450 nm at the pulse frequency of 1 MHz (FLS980, Edinburgh). The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of perovskite solar cells were determined using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Chenhua) under AM 1.5 simulated illumination (CEL-S500, Beijing, China). The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined using an IPCE system (PVE 300, Bentham, Inc.) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Moreover, using a mask, the active area of the solar cells was controlled at 0.12 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure of the perovskite films

Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the fabrication of perovskite films by thermal annealing and solvent (N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF) vapor annealing on the FTO/compact TiO2 substrate. Moreover, the perovskite films were prepared by a one-step deposition method. Because of high solubility of Pb(Ac)2·3H2O and MAI in DMF, the humid environment provided by the DMF vapor allowed the precursor ions and molecules to achieve longer diffusion distances, whereas in the case of solid-state thermal annealing, the environment improved the ordered crystallization, which promoted the growth of large grains. To verify these hypotheses, we explored the effect of DMF vapor annealing on the grain growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 film. Moreover, pristine samples were prepared by thermal annealing. As shown in Fig. 1a, the precursor solution was spin-coated on the compact TiO2 layer after the delay time of 55 s, and then, the perovskite film was formed with a tan color and transparent mirror-like surface. After being transferred onto a hot plate (100 °C), the perovskite films turned dark brown and showed a mirror-like appearance. As shown in Fig. 1b, a perovskite film was formed by DMF vapor annealing, and the film was transferred to a hot plate (100 °C) and covered by a glass Petri dish. Moreover, DMF in different volumes was placed onto the hot plate around the samples during the formation of the perovskite film. A transparent and dark brown film was immediately formed on the substrate, indicating the formation of CH3NH3PbI3. The perovskite formation process can be described by the following equations: Pb(Ac)2·3H2O + 3CH3NH3I = PbI2 + CH3NH3I + 2CH3NH3Ac(g)↑ + 3H2O(1) PbI2 + CH3NH3I + H2O → CH3NH3PbI3·H2O(2) CH3NH3PbI3·H2O → CH3NH3PbI3 + H2O(3)
In summary, Pb(Ac)2·3H2O + 3CH3NH3I = CH3NH3PbI3 + 2CH3NH3Ac(g)↑ + 3H2O(4)
Note that the hydration water was introduced into the precursors instead of water. The hydration water does not degrade the MAPbI3 perovskite; however, several water molecules are released during the formation of MAPbI3·H2O that may induce other side reactions, such as the generation of perovskite dihydrate, which would irreversibly decompose to PbI2 in air, as shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 2c shows the growth model of solvent annealing. Due to Pb(Ac)2·3H2O and MAI have high solubility in DMF, the DMF vapor provided an advantageous atmosphere so that the precursor ions and molecules can diffuse a longer distance, which promotes the grain growth and forms a larger grain size. Thus, the DMF solvent molecules in the perovskite film condense on its surface and facilitate the rearrangement of the precursor atoms to some extent, promoting the packing of atoms in a regular array-like structure.31

The crystalline morphology of the perovskite film was evident. The SEM surface images are shown in Fig. 3a–d, and the grain size of both thermally annealed and DMF solvent vapor-annealed films increases with an increase in the volume of DMF from 0 μL to 15 μL. Specifically, the perovskite layer obtained by DMF (15 μL) vapor annealing had largest average grain size (∼520 nm) with less defects; as shown in Fig. 3e and f, when the perovskite films were prepared by DMF (the volume of DMF ranged from 20 μL to 25 μL) solvent vapor annealing, the defects of the perovskite film significantly increased, and the average grain size of the film decreased; therefore, it could be observed that perovskite layers with large grain sizes and higher coverage were obtained using an optimum volume of DMF during solvent vapor annealing. The excessive DMF solvent damages the alignment and reorganization of perovskite grains, which causes the voids to increase inside the perovskite film. The reason is that an excessive DMF solvent will be destructive to the balance of perovskite crystal arrangement, and decompose the perovskite and blur the thin films. Therefore, the orderly arrangement of perovskite crystal particles is disturbed due to the disordered arrangement of the particles, holes are produced in the film, and the coverage rate decreases. However, when the DMF volume was increased from 0 to 10 μL, the order degree of crystalline particles and the quality of the forming films improved, as observed from the SEM image of the film. When the DMF volume was 15 μL, the order degree of crystalline particles reached an optimal dynamic equilibrium state; therefore, the membrane had the best surface structure. For perovskite films, their morphology and coverage are another key factors affecting the carrier transport path. Therefore, the surface structure of the perovskite film (obtained using 15 μL DMF) was extremely helpful for the achievement of high PCE PSCs due to the reduction in carrier recombination during long-distance transmission at grain boundaries.36
 Fig. 3  (a, b, c, d, e and f) Top-view SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared by DMF in various volumes, which correspond to 0 μL, 5 μL, 10 μL, 15 μL, 20 μL, and 25 μL, and (g) and (h) show the change in the average grain size with different volumes of DMF. 
The XRD results of thermally annealed and DMF solvent vapor-annealed perovskite films are shown in Fig. 4a. All the films show prominent diffraction peaks at 14.19°, 28.45° and 31.87°, corresponding to the (110), (220) and (310) lattice planes. Moreover, other diffraction peaks at 19.94°, 24.55°, 40.6°, and 43.18°, corresponding to the (112), (202), (224), and (314) lattice planes show low intensities of the tetragonal perovskite structure, which indicate that the CH3NH3PbI3 film is formed. Furthermore, all the diffraction peaks indicate that the prepared films have a tetragonal crystal structure and the lattice parameters of a = b = 8.87 Å and c = 12.65 Å; this is consistent with the reported results.37 Moreover, Fig. 4b shows that the perovskite film formed by DMF solvent (15 μL) vapor annealing requires a long time to decompose in the air environment (temperature = 27–35 °C, humidity = 45–80%); these results indicate that the perovskite film formed by DMF solvent (15 μL) vapor annealing has best stability in the air environment.

3.2. Electronic properties of the perovskite films
Subsequently, we explored the electronic properties of the perovskite films obtained by annealing using DMF in different volumes. Fig. 5a shows the UV–vis spectra of the perovskite films. It has been observed that all samples show absorbance over the entire visible region, corresponding to the band gap of MAPbI3 (∼1.55 eV). Moreover, we observed that the perovskite film, which was annealed by 15 μL DMF, showed highest light absorption in the range of 500–800 nm. The results demonstrate that the perovskite film obtained by annealing with 15 μL DMF can effectively enhance the light harvesting ability and accelerate charge extraction from the perovskite to charge collection layers; this would lead to higher Jsc of PSCs. Furthermore, the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the perovskite films (with and without DMF vapor treatment) deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrate irradiated from the glass side are shown in Fig. S1.† It is clear that the DMF vapor-treated perovskite films have a higher reflectance value in the region from 400 to 750 nm when compared with those without the DMF vapor treatment; this demonstrates that the light undergoes multiple reflections within the perovskite film; this leads to the extension of the light path length as well as higher efficiency of light utilization. The enhanced absorbance should be attributed to the fact that the smooth and dense film has higher extinction coefficient of light than the coarse and loose film.36Fig. 5b shows the transformed Kubelka–Munk spectra of the perovskite films with or without DMF treatment during the thermal annealing process. We have found no difference in the determined optical band gaps of the films obtained by the two annealing processes, and the band gap of MAPbI3 is ∼1.56 eV.

Fig. 5c shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films. The steady-state PL spectra were obtained to study charge transport capability, charge extraction capability and the rate of carrier recombination at the interface of TiO2 and the perovskite film. Fig. 5c shows that all perovskite films are excited at 450 nm, and the characteristic steady-state PL peak (15 μL DMF) at 768 nm is related to the intrinsic band gap (∼1.61 eV) of MAPbI3. After comparing all the samples, we found that the PL peak intensity of the perovskite films obtained by 15 μL DMF was less than that of other peaks; this indicated efficient charge injection from the perovskite layer to the compact TiO2 layer.38 More efficient carrier transport achieved by the faster electron extraction may be a contribution to the enhancement in the photovoltaic efficiency.39 These results can be attributed to the fact that the crystal of the perovskite film is enlarged, and the film is compact, continuous and less defective; this is consistent with the morphology results shown in Fig. 3.
The time-resolved PL measurement was used to explore the charge carrier extraction at the interface between the charge collection layers and the perovskite layer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 5d. The TRPL decay curves can be well fitted by a bi-exponential equation:40 Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + Y0(5)where A1 and A2 are the decay amplitude and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow recombination time, respectively. We also calculated the average PL lifetime (τave) according to the following equation:40 τave = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(6)
Using eqn (5) and (6), the key TRPL parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The perovskite film prepared without DMF had the carrier lifetime of 86.36 ns. When the perovskite film was annealed with 15 μL DMF, the reduced carrier lifetime of 74.17 ns was obtained; compared to the case of all samples, the shorter τave of Pb(Ac)2·3H2O-based perovskite films obtained by annealing with 15 μL DMF indicated acceleration of efficient transportation and charge extraction from the perovskite layer to the charge collection layer.41 This is in good agreement with the reduced steady-state PL peak intensity and directly translates to the improved device performance. In detail, the reduced PL decay time is conducive to the reduction of charge combination at the interface of the perovskite and the c-TiO2 layer, which should contribute to the improvement in FF and Voc.
3.3. Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells

Fig. 6a shows the device architecture FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, and the cross-sectional images of the devices are shown in Fig. S2.† The CH3NH3PbI3 thin films were obtained by single thermal annealing and DMF solvent vapor annealing, represented as TA-PSCs and DMF-SA-PSCs, respectively. To further identify the effect of DMF on the performance of PSCs, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were investigated, as shown in Fig. 6b and c. The J–V curves of the PSCs prepared using the DMF solvent in different volumes are shown in Fig. 6b, and the statistical data are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3. The PCE of all devices has maximum value at an optimum DMF volume (15 μL), and when the volume of DMF exceeds 15 μL, the PCE is remarkably lowered. Fig. 7 and Table 3 further show the same PCE results of PSCs. Fig. 6c shows that the DMF-SA-PSCs achieve the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.71%, with the short-current photocurrent (Jsc) of 21.26 mA cm−2, the open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.036 V and the fill factor (FF) of 62.20%. In contrast, the TA-PSCs exhibit the champion PCE of 10.44%, Jsc of 18.35 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.956 V, and FF of 59.55%. Fig. 6d shows a comparison of the hysteresis of TA-PSCs and DMF-SA-PSCs (15 μL DMF), and the relevant performance parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and S1.† In Table 2, the hysteresis index is obtained according to the following equation:42,43 Hysteresis index = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse.(7)

The TA-PSCs show a larger hysteresis index than the DMF-SA-PSCs. It has been inferred that the negligible J–V hysteresis can be attributed to the DMF vapor-treated perovskite film with large grain size and a smoother and compact surface. Fig. 6e shows the histograms of PCEs for TA-PSCs and DMF-SA-PSCs (50 devices for each group). Moreover, the PCE of TA-PSCs is significantly less than that of DMF-SA-PSCs, and both TA-PSCs and DMF-SA-PSCs have good reproducibility. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Fig. 6f show that the DMF-SA-PSCs (DMF solvent: 15 μL) exhibit higher quantum yield throughout the entire wavelength than the TA-PSCs; this is consistent with the photovoltaic performance. The integrated Jsc obtained from the IPCE spectra is lower than the value obtained from the J–V tests (as shown in Table 3). This discrepancy is probably due to the existence of defects in the perovskite film or direct contact of PSC with water and oxygen in an open air environment during the PSC performance test.

Fig. 8a shows the Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra for PSCs at the bias voltage of 0.7 V under a dark condition, which can be used to further investigate the charge transport and recombination properties of cells; the inset in Fig. 8a shows a simplified equivalent circuit used to analyze the charge transportation and recombination in the PSCs.44 After DMF solvent vapor annealing, the DMF-SA-PSCs exhibit smaller contact resistance (Rs) and larger charge recombination resistance (Rct) than the pristine PSCs, indicating better charge transfer ability and less carrier recombination, which should contribute to the improvement in PCE.
 Fig. 8  The PSCs based on without and with DMF solvent-treated perovskite films: (a) Nyquist plots measured in dark at the bias voltage of 0.7 V and (b) stabilized photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency at maximum power points. 
In addition to the enhanced PCE, the stability of the cells based on the DMF solvent vapor-annealed films was improved. Fig. 8b shows the stabilized output at maximum power points of perovskite solar cells fabricated with or without DMF during the MAPbI3 film synthesis process. The pristine PSCs exhibited the stabilized PCE of 9.35% (at the voltage of 0.70 V) and stabilized current density output of 16.33 mA cm−2. For the device prepared with DMF (15 μL) during the annealing process, the stabilized PCE of 12.35% was obtained (Jsc = 19.43 mA cm−2).
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the PSCs obtained using DMF solvent vapor-annealed Pb(Ac)2·3H2O-based perovskite films exhibited enhanced performance. It is evident that when DMF is used in an appropriate volume for the annealing of Pb(Ac)2·3H2O-based perovskite films, it improves not only the film morphology and coverage, but also the optical and electrical properties of the perovskite layer. Moreover, charge carrier extraction at the interfaces between the perovskite layer and the charge collection layers was enhanced, as could be determined by the PL quenching measurements. Moreover, the incorporation of DMF in a suitable amount during the annealing process of perovskite photoactive layers can control the rate of perovskite crystal growth and the size of the perovskite grain; these results indicate that the proposed method can be a promising way to achieve highly efficient and large-scale planar heterojunction PSCs without the use of anti-solvents and provides a new idea and method towards controlling the growth of crystal perovskites.
