    , Accepted 19th August 2022First published on 19th August 2022AbstractTumor phototherapies including mainly photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have drawn increasing attention due to their various merits of minimal drug resistance, low invasiveness and good spatial–temporal controllability. Photosensitizers play a key role in these processes. Under laser irradiation, tumor cells can be killed by hyperpyrexia or reactive oxygen species produced by photosensitizers. Compared with inorganic photosensitizers and conjugated polymer photosensitizers, organic small-molecule photosensitizers exhibit many valuable advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity, high reproducibility and facile molecular tailoring. In this field, the development of organic conjugated small-molecule photosensitizers that contain donor–acceptor backbones has maintained strong momentum. More and more types of such photosensitizers have been designed for PTT, PDT or their synergistic phototherapy. In this review, we highlight the design strategy adopted for diverse conjugated backbones in organic conjugated small-molecule photosensitizers and give a comprehensive summary of their applications in tumor phototherapy.

1. Introduction
There is no doubt that cancer is still one of the deadliest diseases today.1–5 Although radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are still the main therapeutic treatments for cancer in the clinic, the serious side effects produced by these treatments have driven us to find better therapies.5–13 In this context, phototherapies including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have shown better prospects in cancer treatment.14–20 The treatment processes that involve the combination of laser light and photosensitizers (PSs) exhibit minimal drug resistance, low invasiveness and good spatial–temporal controllability. Upon photoexcitation, the ground state (S0) of the PS jumps rapidly to the lowest excited singlet state (S1). The excited state will decay back to the ground state through non-radiative pathways, which can generate heat (Scheme 1). When the temperature exceeds 42 °C, irreversible cell necrosis occurs. As the temperature rises further, cell death can occur rapidly owing to vessel thrombosis, ischaemia or destruction of proteins and membranes. If the excited state decays back to the triplet state (T1) through intersystem crossing (ISC), the excited energy of the triplet state promotes the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) like singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), superoxide radicals (O2˙−), etc.21–25 The apoptotic mechanisms of PTT and PDT are complicated. Results have demonstrated that PTT and PDT can initiate cell death through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway that involves BID, cytochrome c, APF-1 and caspase proteins.26,27 Therefore, high-performance photosensitizers play a key role in tumor phototherapy.

Nowadays photosensitizers mainly include inorganic molecules, polymers and organic small molecules. Inorganic photosensitizers have received long-term attention due to their good light-absorption ability.23,28–33 However their non-negligible toxicity restricts their clinical application.34 By contrast, organic molecules show better biocompatibility and lower toxicity.17,35–39 Nevertheless, polymers have also been criticized for their low reproducibility and problematic biodegradation.38–40 Organic small-molecule photosensitizers have shown great potential in tumor phototherapy owing to their excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity, facile molecular tailoring and adjustable absorption wavelength.38,41 Various kinds of organic small-molecule photosensitizers, including cyanine dyes,42–45 porphyrins,46–49 BODIPY derivatives50–53 and conjugated small molecules that contain donor–acceptor (D–A) structures,38,54 have been developed for PTT and PDT. Among them, organic conjugated small molecules with D–A, D–A–D or A–D–A structures have gradually gained favor. These molecules were originally used as organic semiconductor materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),55–57 organic solar cells (OSCs)58–61 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).62–65 The push–pull electron effects between the electron donor and electron acceptor units can enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) to improve their light-harvesting capability and narrow the optical bandgaps.61,66–70 Their modular structures can facilitate the regulation of their photophysical properties and phototherapy performance. Some specific groups can easily be introduced into the molecular skeletons to adjust the absorption spectra, water solubility and specific targeting of these photosensitizers. In the past decade, their applications in biological fields including biosensing, biological imaging and tumor phototherapy have grown rapidly.71–76
The aforementioned small-molecule photosensitizers usually use one or more electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units to complete the construction of diverse conjugated backbones such as D–A, D–A–D, A–D–A and so on (Fig. 1). Strong D–A effects are an essential feature of these molecules, and are beneficial for enhancing the light absorption and decreasing the bandgap. Light absorption and the bandgap are the key photophysical properties of small molecules that affect their PTT and PDT activities. On the other hand, the molecular geometry and aggregation can be modified through the introduction of different donor or acceptor units, which also play critical roles in PDT and PTT. They affect the charge transfer and molecular rotation and/or vibration. Distorting the molecular conformation, extending the intermolecular distance and providing more loose-packed surroundings can facilitate the non-radiative decay to enhance PDT and PTT. The last parameter to talk about is the ISC rate, which has a big impact on the PDT activity. The ISC rate is related to spin–orbit perturbations (SOPs) and singlet–triplet energy gaps (ΔEST) based on perturbation theory. These values can be adjusted via structural modification for a high ISC rate. Studies on the structural design and application of photosensitizers in PTT and PDT have received unprecedented attention.77–81 Since 2019, an increasing number of such photosensitizers have rapidly been developed for phototherapy, especially in the design and synthesis of photosensitizers with A–D–A structures82 with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) or excellent ROS generation capabilities. So, it is necessary to provide a comprehensive insight into the design strategy for these photosensitizers and their application in tumor phototherapy. However, so far, there is no corresponding review on this topic. In this review, we will highlight the effects of the structural units in these photosensitizers on their light-absorption ability, the PTCE and ROS generation capability. We expect that our summary of the relationship between the chemical structures and their phototherapy performance will provide a clear direction for the rational design of organic conjugated small-molecule photosensitizers.

2. Advances in small-molecule photosensitizers with D–A structures
The D–A skeleton is seen in many kinds of photosensitizer.83 Strong interaction between the D and A units can facilitate the ICT of these molecules. Enhanced ICT could reduce the bandgaps to improve the ISC rate of the photosensitizers,84 which is beneficial for enhancing the PDT activity.85,86 So the core of the current molecular design is how to improve the interactions between the D and A units. One strategy is to use conjugated units with a higher electron-donating or electron-withdrawing capability. Another strategy is to extend the conjugated length of the small molecules. In terms of PTT, sufficient rotations could facilitate non-radiative decay so as to increase the PTCE of the photosensitizers So, the introduction of structural units with more molecular rotors is the main strategy for improving the PTT activity.
Here we cannot help but mention the concept of aggregation-induced emission (AIE), which was first established by Tang in 2001.87–90 For organic molecules, the fluorescenceimaging and phototherapy abilities are produced by different photophysical energy-dissipation processes. The excited energy can be relaxed via a radiative pathway, which will cause fluorescence, whereas the photon energy absorbed by photosensitizers is consumed through non-radiative pathways, which can be used for PTT and PDT. It is easy understand that these two pathways usually compete with each other. It is important to balance the fluorescence emission and the PTT or PDT activity for the design of excellent phototheranostic agents. Fortunately, AIE luminogens (AIEgens) are competent for this task. Sufficient molecular rotators or vibrators in the AIEgens can consume the energy of the excited state through the non-radiative decay pathway to improve the photothermal conversion ability. In addition, numerous studies have revealed that the PDT activity and fluorescence emission in AIEgens are not in absolute opposition. A strong fluorescence emission can be obtained for AIEgens in the aggregated state, which can promote efficient ROS generation due to the prohibition of energy dissipation through non-radiative channels.91 Besides, one other concept called aggregation-induced intersystem crossing (AI-ISC) has been proposed to demonstrate that AIEgens can achieve superior PDT activity through molecular design.92 Therefore, more and more AIEgens have also been applied in tumor phototherapy.93,94
Among the various AIEgens, those known as anion–π+ AIEgens,95 which have D–A structures and were first reported in 2017, have been used widely in tumor phototherapy. The most striking feature of these molecules is that they use cationic groups, for example, pyridinium, as the acceptor units. These pyridinium groups not only play the role of electron-withdrawing units but also play the role of tumor-targeting agents. By contrast, the development of the donor units has been less dizzying, where the donor units used are usually triphenylamine (TPA) and its derivatives.96,97
In 2018, Tang and colleagues designed two AIEgens, TTPy and MeTTPy, which were constructed using a pyridinium moiety and a TPA segment, with a carbon–carbon double bond and a thiophene ring as the π-bridge (Fig. 2).98 In solution, they exhibited a strong absorption from 400 to 600 nm. The use of the pyridinium moiety with a positive charge as an electron acceptor unit endowed these molecules with a strong D–A strength to enhance their far-red/near-infrared (FR/NIR) emission and ROS generation efficacy. As a result, TTPy and MeTTPy exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields of 9.6% and 8.6%, respectively. In terms of the PDT activity, MeTTPy has a higher ROS quantum yield of 90.7% compared with TTPy (71.91%) due to the smaller ΔEST of MeTTPy (Table 1). Moreover, introduction of the pyridinium moiety endowed TTPy and MeTTPy with mitochondrial-specific targeting. Experiments using the standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay revealed that both TTPy and MeTTPy have excellent phototherapy abilities for A431 cancer cells. In addition, cell viability data showed that MeTTPy did even better due to its higher PDT activity. The PDT performance of MeTTPy in vivo further demonstrated that this photosensitizer is a promising theranostic agent for imaging-guided PDT. The introduction of the pyridinium moiety facilitates the introduction of other groups for different tumor-targeting abilities. Thus, Tang's group went on to synthesize three AIEgens, TFPy, TFVP, and TPE-TFPy, which exhibited different tumor targeting of by anchoring to mitochondria, cell membranes and lysosomes, respectively.78 Moreover, they proposed a novel phototherapy strategy that integrated the three AIEgens into one theranostic agent (Fig. 3). TFPy, TFVP, and TPE-TFPy exhibited singlet oxygen quantum yields of 25.2%, 18.3% and 63.0%, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, these AIEgens did not interfere with each other's 1O2 generation when they were integrated. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results demonstrated that the three AIEgens together showed ‘1 + 1 + 1 > 3’ synergistic photodynamic therapy.

In addition, to study the effects of the electron-donating ability of the donor units on the phototherapy performance of the D–A structured photosensitizers, in 2020, Tang et al. synthesized four anion–π+ AIEgens (TBZPy, MTBZPy, TNZPy, MTNZPy) using the same pyridinium motif and different electron-donating units.99 The D units in MTNZPy showed the highest electron-donating ability through the introduction of the methoxy-substituted TPA segment and the naphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole moiety. As the electron-donating ability of the D units was improved, their ICT effects followed the order of TBZPy < MTBZPy < TNZPy < MTNZPy. The strong ICT state facilitates minimizing the ΔEST, which is beneficial for enhancing the PDT activity. As a result, MTNZPy gave the best ROS generation ability. In addition, the enhanced ISC endowed the photosensitizers with type I PDT activity, which is beneficial for PDT under hypoxic conditions.100 Therefore, MTBZPy and TNZPy had both type I and II PDT activities, and MTNZPy mainly exhibited type I PDT activity. Subsequently, the good fluorescence imaging (FLI) and PDT performance of TNZPy and MTNZPy were demonstrated through experiments in vivo (Fig. 4). The clearly visualized tumor sites can be observed due to the strong fluorescence of TNZPy and MTNZPy (Fig. 4a). The tumor volume and body weight data recorded throughout the entire PDT treatment time indicated the good antitumor effects and biosafety of these AIEgens (Fig. 4b–d).

The other method for improving the D–A effects is to extend the π-conjugation length via the insertion of one or more electron-rich aromatic rings. This design concept has been used to synthesize a series of AIEgens of TI, TSI, TSSI, TTT-1, TTT-2, TTT-3 and TTT-4.101,102 These molecules have become the ‘all-round athletes’ for phototheranostic applications. Similar to electron donor units, increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor units is also an effective method of enhancing the D–A effects. Besides the pyridinium ion, other ions (i.e., 2,3,3-trimethylindolenine, quinolinium and acridinium) were also used as A units to construct anion–π+ AIEgens.103,104 Among the ions of pyridinium, quinolinium and acridinium, the acridinium ion has the highest electron-withdrawing ability. So TPEDCAc using the acridinium ion as the A unit showed the broadest absorption and the strongest ICT intensity, which give TPEDCAc the highest PDT activity.104 Moreover, compared with TPEDCPy and TPEDCQY, TPEDCAc showed obvious PTT activity due to skeleton distortion and rotor twisting (Table 1). Based on the photophysical features of these photosensitizers, their therapeutic effects were tested in MCF7 tumor-bearing nude mice. The experiments in vivo showed that TPEDCAc exhibited the highest inhibition ability on the tumor growth due to its dual PTT and PDT activities. By contrast, TPEDCPy and TPEDCQY were able to inhibit tumor growth only slightly using just PDT in vivo.
Although the above-mentioned photosensitizers could achieve multimodal phototheranostics, their absorption values do not exceed 800 nm. In light of this shortcoming, through structural modification, Lee et al. synthesized the D–A structured photosensitizer BT3, which has an absorption peak beyond 800 nm (Fig. 5). Nanoparticles based on BT3 showed a PTCE of 58.3%, and the ROS generation efficiency of BT3 NPs is 10.3-fold higher than that of indocyanine green (ICG; Fig. 5).77 The photothermal effects were also confirmed in the treatment of A549 tumor-bearing nude mice. After 5 min of 808 nm laser illumination (1 W cm−2), the temperature of the tumor sites in mice injected with BT3 NPs rose to 54 °C (Fig. 5c and d). Other experiments in vivo showed that the BT3 NPs with good biosafety performed well in tumor-growth inhibition based on combined PTT and PDT (Fig. 5e–g).

Although the photosensitizers with D–A structures performed well in PTT or PDT, the light sources they used were usually confined to the visible region, meaning that it is difficult to complete tumor eradication in deep tissues.105,106 Therefore, push–pull electron effects from the interaction between one D unit and one A unit are still slightly weak, which could not further broaden the absorption of the photosensitizers.
3. Advances in small-molecule photosensitizers with D–A–D structures
The prototypes of small molecules with D–A–D structures were designed and synthesized back in the 1990s.107 In early studies, they were used widely as organic semiconductor materials in OLEDs and OSCs.108,109 In terms of biological fields, they first showed up in the fluorescent-imaging application.110 Nowadays, more and more such molecules are being designed and used in tumor phototherapy. Similar to the D–A structured photosensitizers, the D segments used in D–A–D structured are still TPA, aromatic heterocycles, the triphenylethylene group or their combination. By contrast, changes in the A segments have been more colorful, and have mainly included diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), benzothiadiazole (BT), benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBTD), thiadiazolobenzotriazole (TBZ), [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) and so on.
A. DPP
Since it was first discovered in 1970s,111 DPP has become a very common electron acceptor unit for the construction of π-conjugated organic small molecules. It has many excellent merits, such as simple synthesis, exceptional stability and easy structural modification.112–115 There are multiple sites in DPP for structural modification. Through N-alkylation, functional side chains that can be used to adjust the solubility, improve the biocompatibility or provide tumor targeting can be easily introduced into DPP-based small molecules. D–A–D structured small molecules can be readily constructed through the attachment of electron-rich aromatic rings onto DPP. Small molecules based on DPP have high molar extinction coefficients and intense NIR absorption, which are very important for their application in phototherapy.
Since 2017, many groups have reported such DPP-based small molecule photosensitizers that mainly use TPA or its derivatives as electron-donating units. The study of Dong's group focused on the effects of π-bridges on the performance of these photosensitizers. They synthesized three similar photosensitizers, called FDPP-TPA,116 DPP-TPA117 and SeDPP-TPA,118 using furan rings, thiophene rings and selenophene rings, respectively, as π-bridges (Fig. 6). Compared with FDPP-TPA and DPP-TPA, SeDPP-TPA in solution exhibited a clear red-shifted absorption due to the higher electron-donating ability of the selenophene ring (Table 2). All of them showed both PTT and PDT activities. The PTCE of FDPP-TPA NPs, DPP-TPA NPs and SeDPP-TPA NPs were calculated to be 47%, 34.5% and 37.9%, respectively, and their respective ROS quantum yields were 40%, 33.6% and 40% (Table 2). As a result, all of them performed well in multi-modal imaging-guided photothermal and photodynamic therapy (Fig. 7).

In view of the importance of the π-bridges and electron-donating units, Tang and colleagues systematically studied their effects on the performance of the photosensitizer. To do this, they synthesized four similar DPP-based photosensitizers with different π-bridges and electron-donating units (Fig. 6; DPP-TPA, 2TPAVDPP, TPATPEVDPP and 2TPEVDPP).119 It was found that they can improve the planarity and extend the π-conjugation length through replacement of the thiophene ring with a vinyl group, which can elevate the D–A interactions. DPP-TPA exhibited a much more twisted configuration than the other three photosensitizers. Thus, 2TPAVDPP, TPATPEVDPP and 2TPEVDPP showed a clear red-shifted absorption (Table 2). In addition, the elevated D–A interactions contributed to enhancing the ΔEST improving the ROS generation efficiency (Fig. 8). The ROS producing capability of these photosensitizers was as expected, which follows the sequence of 2TPAVDPP NPs < TPATPEVDPP NPs < DPP-TPA NPs < 2TPEVDPP NPs. Moreover, 2TPAVDPP NPs, TPATPEVDPP NPs and 2TPEVDPP NPs exhibited type I PDT activity through introduction of the vinyl moiety. In terms of the photothermal conversion, the PTCE of 2TPEVDPP NPs was calculated to be 66% while the PTCE of TPATPEVDPP NPs and 2TPAVDPP NPs decreased slightly (Table 2). The 2TPEVDPP NPs showed the best photothermal conversion ability due to the introduction of the tetraphenylethylene segment with more rotor numbers. Therefore, the 2TPEVDPP NPs were then used to perform experiments in vitro and in vivo. The cell viability data of HeLa cells after the different treatments indicated that the 2TPEVDPP NPs showed a synergistic effect of PTT and PDT. The temperature in the tumor region of mice treated with the 2TPEVDPP NPs and laser irradiation was raised by 31 °C. Another series of experimental results in vivo confirmed again that the 2TPEVDPP NPs showed PDT/PTT synergetic anticancer efficacy.

In order to improve the mitochondrial targeting of the phototherapeutic agent, Kim's group reported a DPP-based photosensitizer MsPDTT with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) motifs at both ends (Fig. 6). The introduction of TPP not only endowed MsPDTT with mitochondrial targeting but also improved the PTT and PDT activities of the photosensitizer.120 Besides TPA, other electron donor units, such as phenothiazine derivatives, thieno[2,3-b]indole, and so on, have been used in succession for the construction of such D–A–D structured photosensitizers (Fig. 6).121–124 Their phototherapy performance has been summarized in Table 2.
B. Thiadiazoles
Thiadiazoles as electron acceptors were first studied in the 1980s.125,126 Since then, their derivatives, including BT, BBTD and TBZ, have been used widely in the construction of organic semiconductor materials.127,128 In recent years, a series of D–A–D structured photosensitizers using these molecules as electron acceptor units have been designed and synthesized (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of D–A–D structured photosensitizers based on thiadiazole derivatives. 
In this section, we intend to emphasize the effects of twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) on the photothermal conversion.129,130 In 2019, Tang's group synthesized four D–A–D structured photosensitizers containing TPA (D unit) and BBTD (A unit) with different 3-alkyl-substituted thiophene rings as π-bridges (Fig. 9).131 The TICT state can be easily adjusted through side chain engineering. NIRb14, with long alkyl chains branched at the second carbon, is superior to NIR6, which has short linear chains, in the stabilization of the dark TICT state. The TICT state favors various non-radiative quenching processes, which is beneficial for improving the PTCE. The final PTCE values were consistent with the theory mentioned above (Table 2). NIRb14-PEG NPs, which were prepared using copolymer PEG-b-PCL as the doping matrix, showed a PTCE of 31.2%, which is higher than similar nanoparticles based on NIRb10 (29.8%), NIRb6 (26.2%) and NIR6 (22.6%). In order to increase the tumor uptake and the retention of nanodrugs in vivo, the new nanoparticles NIRb14-PAE/PEG NPs with charge conversion features were prepared (Fig. 10a). The NIRb14-PAE/PEG NPs exhibited better photothermal effects in xenograft 4T1 tumor-bearing mice than did the NIRb14-PEG NPs due to their better tumor accumulation and retention (Fig. 10b and c). Therefore, NIRb14-PAE/PEG NPs displayed the most remarkable antitumor efficacy (Fig. 10d). In their follow-up study, this group also demonstrated that extending the side-chain length was also an effective means of improving the PDT activity. The ROS generation capabilities of the TBFT1 NPs and TBFT2 NPs with a longer alkyl chain were superior to that of TBFT (Table 2).132

The design strategies for other photosensitizers have been mentioned repeatedly above (Fig. 9). We will not repeat them. Here, we want to discuss the application of the Se atom.133,134 Lee's group reported a D–A–D conjugated small molecule IR-SS, which shows NIR II absorption through the introduction of the Se atom (Fig. 9).79 Under 1064 nm laser irradiation, the IR-SS NPs based on IR-SS showed a PTCE of 77% (Table 2). The photothermal performance of the IR-SS NPs in tumor-xenografted mice was also remarkable. After laser irradiation, the temperature of the tumor sites in mice injected with IR-SS NPs increased from 34 °C to 63 °C in 5 minutes. As a result, IR-SS NPs have a superior capability of tumor-growth inhibition. This is one of the few NIR II excited organic photosensitizers that performed well in PTT. The phototherapy performance of other D–A–D conjugated photosensitizers using BT, BBTD or TBZ as electron acceptor units has been summarized in Table 2.135–137
C. [1,2,5]Thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ)
Compared with BT, TQ has a higher electron-withdrawing ability due to the electron-deficient pyrazine ring. Only a few D–A–D structured photosensitizers using TQ as electron acceptor units have been reported so far (Fig. 11). Tang's group first reported such a type of photosensitizer, TPA-T-TPQ.138 In solution, TPA-T-TPQ has an intense absorption in the region of 700–900 nm. The nanoparticles based on TPA-T-TPQ showed an excellent photothermal conversion performance, excellent photothermal stability and physiological stability.
 Fig. 11  Chemical structures of D–A–D-type photosensitizers based on TQ derivatives (as highlighted in red). 
As mentioned above, the introduction of a π-bridge with a large steric hindrance could weaken the intermolecular stacking and prevent interactions between the excited photosensitizer and its surroundings. Based on this theory, Tang's group synthesized a novel photosensitizer DPBTA-DPTQ using benzo[c]thiophene as the bulky π-bridge.139 DPBTA-DPTQ had a more twisted conformation, with movable rotators and vibrators, and showed an excellent capability for NIR II imaging and photothermal conversion (Fig. 12). The viability of HepG2 cells and B16-F10 cells confirmed the low dark cytotoxicity and good tumoricidal performance of DPBTA-DPTQ. A cell viability of 92% under dark conditions was obtained even using a high concentration of DPBTA-DPTQ NPs, while more than 90% of cells were killed after laser irradiation. Next, the good antitumor performance of DPBTA-DPTQ NPs was demonstrated in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice and B16-F10 tumor-xenografted C57BL/6 mice. Besides Tang's group, Liu et al. used tetraphenylethene as the electron donor unit to obtain one such photosensitizer, TQ-BTPE, with two-photon photosensitization, which was the first example of an NIR-II excited two-photon organic photosensitizer for PDT.140

D. Other photosensitizers
Wang's group reported a D–A–D structured photosensitizer PPCy-TPA (Fig. 13) based on the pyrrolopyrrole cyanine (PPCy) segment as the A unit and TPA as the D unit.141 PPCy is evolved from DPP. The π-conjugation length can be effectively prolonged through a ring-fusing strategy.115 Under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.77 W cm−2), the PTCE of PPCy-TPA was calculated to be around 40%. Besides, Huang's group used a large electron-deficient unit, (3Z,7Z)-3,7-bis(4-(2-octyldodecyl)-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-6H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrol-6-ylidene)-3,7-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6-dione, as an electron acceptor unit to synthesize the D–A–D structured photosensitizer BTA with a twisted conformation (Fig. 13).142 The twisted conformation can decrease the ΔEST for enhancing the ISC rate constant, which contributes to enhancing the PDT efficacy of the photosensitizer. By contrast, the twisted structure can hinder the π–π stacking for improving the non-radiative relaxation. Under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2), BTA NPs exhibited a PTCE of 33% and a ROS yield of 28.3%. BTA NPs have no dark cytotoxicity to HeLa cells (Fig. 14a). Upon laser irradiation, BTA NPs can kill HeLa cells effectively via synergistic PTT and PDT (Fig. 14b). Another D–A–D structured photosensitizer, TFM, with a twisted structure was reported by Tang's group, which showed a disordered amorphous form with still active molecular motions in the aggregates.143 After incubation with TFM NPs (80 μg mL−1) and laser irradiation, the viability of EMT-6 cells was observed to be as low as about 6% (Fig. 14c). Moreover, the tumor inhibition ratio was calculated to be 98.6% (Fig. 14d) when EMT-6 tumor-bearing mice were treated with TFM NPs and laser irradiation (650 nm, 0.34 W cm−2).

The efficacy of the type II photodynamic therapy will be restricted by the inherent hypoxia properties in the tumor cells.100 Thus, the development of type I PDT is considered to be a more feasible strategy. In this field, the development of organic photosensitizers lags behind that of inorganic photosensitizers. However, the efforts in this regard cannot be ignored. Last year, Zhao et al., used 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ) as an electron acceptor unit to obtain a series of D–A–D structured photosensitizers (Fig. 13) with PTT and type I PDT activities (Table 2).144 PQ with n–π* transition featured can promote ICT and ISC processes within the molecules. Moreover, PQ can undergo a redox cycle inside the tumor cells,145,146 which endows the photosensitizers with type I PDT activity (Fig. 15). In addition, the side chain length has a big impact on the molecular packing, which will affect both the PTT and PDT activities. Among them, PQ-TPAOC1 NPs came out on top due to having the most suitable intermolecular distances. After injection with PQ-TPAOC1 NPs, the temperature of the tumor sites rose to 54.9 °C under laser irradiation. As a result, the tumor inhibition rate was calculated to be as high as 80.4% due to the superior PTT and type I PDT activities.

Organic small-molecule croconium dyes are well known due to their superior NIR absorption and photothermal conversion properties.147,148 In 2021, Lee's group first reported such a croconium dye, DRM, with the D–A–D structure, which was used in PTT (Fig. 13). Diradical features can enhance NIR absorption. The light absorption wavelength of DRM in THF exceeds 1000 nm. Moreover, DRM exhibited a high PTCE of 68% (Table 2) under 808 nm laser irradiation, suggesting the great potential of D–A–D structured croconium dyes in PTT.149 The experimental results in vitro showed that DRM NPs can kill A549 cancer cells effectively, even at low concentrations (6.25 μg mL−1), under 808 nm laser irradiation. The tumor volume and mouse weight changes demonstrated the good tumor therapy efficacy and biosafety of DRM NPs.
At present, the changes in molecular structures for D–A–D molecules are relatively monotonous. All the changes have ultimately focused on modulation of the molecular rotation and/or vibration, and excited-state properties. Compared with their phototherapy applications, the fluorescence imaging of D–A–D molecules has received more attention. Therefore, increasing the molecular rotation and/or vibration in aggregation is a common strategy used to inhibit radiative decay. In addition, enhancing the D–A effects to decrease the ΔEST is the major consideration in molecular design. D–A effects can be strengthened via increasing the electron-donating capability of D units or the electron-withdrawing capability of A units or extension of the conjugation length.
4. Advances in small-molecule photosensitizers with A–D–A structures
Early on, A–D–A structures were first applied in the construction of the oligothiophene electron donor for photoelectric devices.58,150 In 2015, Zhan's group reported a new type of A–D–A structured small molecule that used bulky fused rings with long side chains as the electron donor unit and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the electron acceptor units.151 Nowadays, these conjugated small molecules have become the most widely used organic semiconductor materials.59,61,152 The higher D–A effects give these molecules a wide and strong NIR absorption, as well as a small ΔEST.153,154 Compared with the most reported D–A–D structured small molecules, such types of A–D–A structured small molecules have greater development potential in NIR II absorption. Side chains perpendicular to the main plane of the molecules restrict their excessive aggregation and increase the molecular vibration.155–158 Modular structures with fused-ring cores, end groups and side chains facilitate the molecular design and performance adjustments.159–161 Thousands of such excellent molecules have been designed to be applied in OSCs. In view of their promising biological applications, their application in tumor phototherapy has also been increasingly carried out since 2019.162,163
In 2019, Han's group pioneered the use of the landmark molecule ITIC (Fig. 16) in fluorescence imaging and PTT.82 ITIC NPs showed a high PTCE of 41.6%. After laser irradiation, the viability of SCC4 cells incubated with ITIC NPs was markedly decreased. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was calculated to be 2.5 mg mL−1. The photothermal conversion effects were estimated in SCC4 tumor-bearing nude mice. The temperature at the tumor sites reached 56 °C after laser irradiation for 8 minutes, which again confirmed good photothermal conversion ability of ITIC. Subsequently, a series of such photosensitizers (Fig. 16; F8IC, CPDT, IPIC, IHIC and IDIC-4F) were applied in tumor phototherapy.164–168 Among them, the nanoparticles based on F8IC and IDIC-4F both exhibited an ultra-high PTCE that exceeded 80%, while CPDT and IPIC showed both PTT and PDT activities (Table 3). These early studies confirm once again the great potential of such types of photosensitizer.

The more stable triplet excited state and the smaller ΔEST caused the A–D–A structured molecules to have type I PDT activity. Tian's group and our group successively demonstrated that A–D–A structured molecules could exhibit both type I and II PDT activities. Under laser irradiation, the COi6-4Cl NPs (Fig. 16) reported by Tian's group can produce both 1O2 and ˙OH, which contribute to completing the hypoxia-tolerant photodynamic process.80 Under normoxic conditions, 95% of 4T1 cells can be killed by COi6-4Cl NPs (20 μM) under laser irradiation. Moreover, even under hypoxic conditions, COi6-4Cl NPs (20 μM) can kill 90% of 4T1 cells. Recently, our group developed an A–D–A structured photosensitizer DPIC (Fig. 16), which exhibited not only a high PTCE of 55% but also excellent ROS generation through both type I and II photodynamic mechanisms (Table 3).169
The other thing worth mentioning is that Tang et al. synthesized a new A–D–A structured photosensitizer, IDT-TPE, with AIE effects through the introduction of tetraphenylethene moieties into the π-bridges (Fig. 17).170 Due to both PTT and PDT activities, the IDT-TPE NPs presented a low IC50 value of 27.9 μg mL−1. After treatment with IDT-TPE NPs and laser irradiation, the temperature at the tumor site rose by 19 °C, which again confirmed their good PTT activity. The tumors were completely ablated in mouse groups treated with IDT-TPE NPs plus laser irradiation. The experimental results demonstrated that IDT-TPE NPs have efficient synergistic PDT and PTT efficacy with FLI-PTI bimodal imaging guidance.

The emerging Y-series small-molecule organic semiconductor materials171–174 represented by Y6 (Fig. 16) have also been widely considered in biological fields. In 2021, many groups, including our own, demonstrated that Y6 has good anti-tumor activities based on the combination of PDT and PTT (Table 3).175–177 In addition, Tian's group systematically studied the effects of the side chains in Y-series photosensitizers on their PTT performance.178 The flexible side chains are more facile to rotate than the rigid side chains, which have big effects on the photothermal conversion. As the steric hindrance of the side chains was increased, the nanoparticles based on the corresponding photosensitizers showed a gradually decreasing PTCE. The PTCE of BDTR9-OC6, BDTR9-OC8, BDTR9-C8, and BDTR9-EH NPs was 80%, 78%, 71%, and 69%, respectively (Table 3). The CCK8 test showed that BDTR9-OC8 NPs and BDTR9-C8 NPs demonstrate no obvious dark cytotoxicity but a considerable cell-killing capability upon laser irradiation (Fig. 18a and b, respectively). The temperature enhancement at the tumor sites again confirmed the good PTCE of BDTR9-OC8 NPs and BDTR9-C8 NPs (Fig. 18f). The tumors in mice were completely eliminated or significantly reduced via photothermal therapy (Fig. 18g).

The applications of A–D–A structured photosensitizers in tumor phototherapy are still in their infancy, and it is difficult to summarize some regular design strategies at this stage. Similar to the design of D–A–D structured photosensitizers, the structural changes still focused on some important issues, including light absorption, energy levels and molecular packing, which are repeatedly mentioned.
5. Advances in small-molecule photosensitizers with other structures
As with prominent photoelectric materials, conjugated oligomers have particular merits in tumor phototherapy. However, only one such oligomer has been reported by Liu's group, where the oligomer N4 (Fig. 19) was applied in the PA-imaged PTT of sentinel lymph nodes (Table 4).179 As early as 2018, Tang et al. proposed an effective strategy for enhancing the efficiency of PSs, namely the D–A even–odd effect.180 Based on this idea, Fan's group used two electron-withdrawing motifs to synthesize the small-molecule photosensitizer DPP-BT, which can serve as an FL/PA dual-modal imaged PTT and PDT therapeutic agent (Table 4).181

In addition, some small-molecule photosensitizers (Fig. 19) with tumor-microenvironment responsiveness (i.e., pH, GSH) have been developed by Dong's group,182–184 which is a promising strategy for the design of phototherapy agents with multiple functions. For example, Dong et al. reported the small molecule DAA (Fig. 20), which can be hydrolyzed to release the DMXAA with anti-vascular activity and photosensitizer DPP-4 with phototherapeutic ability (Fig. 20).182

6. Summary and outlook
In summary, recent developments in organic conjugated small-molecule photosensitizers with D–A, D–A–D and A–D–A structures used in tumor phototherapy have been reviewed. Their structure–property relationships are discussed in depth for the future design of high-performance organic phototherapy agents. In their molecular design, there are two aspects of interaction with each other (electronic structure and molecular packing) which need major attention. The electronic structures have great influences on the bandgap as well as the absorption wavelength. Conjugation extension, heteroaromatic substitution and heteroatom substitution are the major strategies used to tune the electronic structures. In addition, the molecular packing also has a big effect on the photophysical properties. Orderly π–π stacking can promote charge transfer to improve the light-harvesting capability and narrow the optical bandgaps. However, tight molecular stacking may have adverse effects on the PDT and PTT. In order to facilitate non-radiative decay for enhancing PDT and PTT, distorting the molecular conformation, extending the intermolecular distance, and providing more loose-packing surroundings may be the major considerations.
Although the photosensitizers listed in this review perform well in tumor phototherapy, there is still a long and hard road ahead for these molecules before they can be used in the clinic. So far, only ICG has been approved for clinical use by the US FDA. The following issues in the future development of these molecules may be worth watching.
(1) Some common effective molecular-design strategies for any photosensitizers, such as the introduction of more molecular rotors, the incorporation of heavy atoms and so on, need to be further discussed in depth at a theoretical level. For the photosensitizers with D–A, D–A–D or A–D–A structures, which one will come out on top in tumor phototherapy? In 2018, Tang's group gave a preliminary conclusion that A–D–A structured small molecules have a higher ISC efficiency than the D–A–D counterparts, which are more suitable as efficient photosensitizers. In spite of this, it may still be hard to give a perfect answer because of the infinite possibilities of molecular design.
(2) Everything is all right, but nothing is the best. For the excited state of one molecule, there is an antithesis between the radiative decay process for fluorescent imaging and the non-radiative decay process for PTT or PDT. Although some molecules as ‘all-rounders athletes’ show great potential in multi-modal imaging and phototherapy, it would be better to constantly optimize one aspect of the outstanding performance of these molecules to make them greater rather than omnipotent.
(3) How can simple structures be made powerful? Although more and more photosensitizers with D–A, D–A–D and A–D–A structures exhibit excellent anti-tumor activity, their structures are usually complicated. It is desirable to obtain high-performance molecules with simple structures, so as to avoid their laborious synthesis and to decrease costs for clinical applications.
(4) The construction of a superior drug delivery system for these molecules is a key point for their clinical application. While focusing on the phototherapy performance of these organic conjugated small molecules, more efforts should be devoted to exploring excellent nanocarriers for them. Compared with the vigorous development of these photosensitizers, the development of nanocarriers for these molecules seriously lags behind.
The application of organic conjugated small-molecule photosensitizers with D–A, D–A–D and A–D–A structures in the field of phototherapy is still in its early stages. Too much work needs to be done. We believe they have a better tomorrow with the unremitting efforts of so many people with lofty ideals.
