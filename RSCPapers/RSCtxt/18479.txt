    , Accepted 23rd March 2015First published on 24th March 2015AbstractHighly active electrode materials with judicious design of nanostructure are important for the construction of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. In this work, we have fabricated a tubular TiC fibre cloth as an interesting type of stable supercapacitive material. Hollow microfibres of TiC are synthesized by carbothermal treatment of commercial T-shirt cotton fibres. To demonstrate the rationale of nanostructuring in energy storage, the hollow fibres are further covered by interwoven TiC nanotube branches, forming 3D tubular all-TiC hierarchical fibres with high electrical conductivity, high surface area, and high porosity. For energy storage functions, organic symmetric supercapacitors based on the hollow fibre–nanotube (HFNT) TiC cloth electrodes are assembled and thoroughly characterized. The TiC-based electrodes show very stable capacitance in long charge–discharge cycles and at different temperatures. In particular, the integrated TiC HFNT cloth electrodes show a reasonably high capacitance (185 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), better cycling stability at high-rates (e.g., 97% retention at room temperature after 150000 cycles, and 67% at −15 °C after 50000 cycles) than other control electrodes (e.g., pure carbon fibre cloths). It is envisaged that this 3D tubular TiC fibre cloth is also useful for solar cells and electrocatalysis.

Broader context
The energy/power density of supercapacitors is mainly controlled by the electrochemical reactivity and reaction kinetics of electrode materials, namely the kinetics of ion and electron transport in electrodes and at the electrode/electrolyte interface. High performance relies largely on scrupulous directional design/fabrication of electrode materials. Tailored electrode materials with judicious nanostructure can meet the critical requirements such as enhanced ion/electron conductivity, faster reaction kinetics and stronger mechanical stability, leading to enhanced supercapacitor performances with high energy/power densities and superior cycling stability. Herein we present the controllable synthesis of a tubular TiC fibre cloth as an interesting type of stable supercapacitive material. To demonstrate the rationale of nanostructure design in energy storage, the hollow fibres are further covered by interwoven TiC nanotube branches, forming 3D tubular all-TiC hierarchical fibres. Compared to metal oxides, the TiC fibers have the properties of high electrical conductivity, high surface area, and mechanical stability. We assemble organic symmetric supercapacitors based on hollow TiC cloth electrodes and demonstrate high-rate energy storage with wide-temperature high specific capacitances and long-term cycling stability.

Introduction
Power sources for modern mobile devices are required to store large quantities of electrical charges in small volumes, and simultaneously be able to deliver the charges rapidly. However, these two requirements cannot always be fulfilled by a single energy-storing device. In the past few decades, supercapacitors have emerged and greatly advanced the development of electrochemical energy storage. It is well known that typical supercapacitors include electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) arising from ion adsorption,1–3 and pseudocapacitors originating from surface Faradic redox reactions.4–6 Whatever the type, electrode materials are the key components, which determine the whole performance of supercapacitors. Recently, the research on developing advanced electrode materials has made encouraging achievements by exploring new materials or nanoscale surface modification.7–12 Research on new electrode materials such as transition metal carbides or nitrides has emerged, but it is still scarce, due to their good EDLC properties, excellent mechanical and chemical stability, and high electrical conductivity.1,3
Titanium carbide (TiC) is one of the most promising transition metal carbides with fascinating physical properties such as excellent chemical and thermal stability, high hardness, outstanding oxidation and corrosion resistance, and low electrical resistivity.13–15 These properties make TiC attractive for a wide range of applications in wear-resistant coatings, superconducting devices, chemical catalysis and electrochemical energy storage.16–20 Micro/nanosize TiC has been prepared based on carbon nanotube (CNT) confined reaction,15,21–23 carbon thermal reduction,17,24–27 and chemical vapor deposition.28–30 All these methods use different carbon sources including CNTs, graphite, activated carbon, polymers, hydrocarbon gases, and biomaterials (such as bamboo and cotton). It has been demonstrated that the final morphology of TiC is highly related to the carbon source employed. Of these carbon sources, the cheap bio-templates, especially cotton fibres, are highly preferable for the construction of TiC electrodes. Up to now, although different types of TiC micro/nanostructures have been synthesized,15,23,27,29,31 no results about integrated TiC electrodes have been reported, let alone their applications for electrochemical energy storage.
In order to achieve high performance of electrodes (e.g., higher capacitance, better cycling life, higher power/energy density), it is now widely accepted that a directional design/fabrication of the electrode materials is a prerequisite. Tailored electrode materials with judicious nanostructure can meet the critical requirements such as enhanced ion/electron conductivity, faster reaction kinetics and stronger mechanical stability.32–40 An integrated electrode usually consists of a conductive micron-scale backbone (usually both as the support and active material) and secondary nanosized active materials grown on the former. This integrated electrode is beneficial to the power/energy output because of a hierarchical porous system with different pore diameters, high surface areas, high conductivity network structure, as well as its binder-free and additive-free characteristics.
In the present work, we fabricated TiC tubular fibers, both 1D hollow microfibres and hollow fibres with nanotube branches, and demonstrated their outstanding supercapacitive properties. The TiC hollow fibre cloth was prepared directly from a commercial cotton T-shirt which acts as both the carbon source and a sacrificial template. The TiC hollow fibre cloth is made up of interconnected nanoparticles, and shows a high electrical conductivity (up to 105 S m−1). To further enhance the performance and demonstrate the rationale of nanostructuring, secondary interwoven TiC nanotubes are grown onto the hollow fibre cloth skeleton to obtain integrated all TiC hollow fibre–nanotube (HFNT) electrodes. This integrated structure further improves the surface area and porosity. As a preliminary demonstration, organic symmetric supercapacitors based on the tubular TiC fibre electrodes are assembled and thoroughly characterized. Remarkably, the symmetric supercapacitors based on the integrated HFNT electrodes exhibit noticeable high-rate capability and impressively stable cycling life at high rates (∼97% retention after 150000 cycles at room temperature). Temperature-dependent (−15 to 65 °C) electrochemical properties are also determined. Our study may stimulate attention on a wide range of metal carbides in various nanostructures as high-performance electrode materials.
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization

Fig. 1a shows the fabrication procedure of the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes prepared by the combination of carbothermal process, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. For the first step, the TiC hollow fibre cloth (HFC) is prepared by a facile carbothermal process using a commercial cotton T-shirt as both the carbon source and a sacrificial template. Then, at the second step, CVD-derived carbon nanofibres are assembled on the surface of the TiC HFC via the EPD method. Finally, the TiO2 layer is coated on the surface of carbon nanofibres by ALD and then forms the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes after another carbothermal process. SEM images of cotton fibres are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The 100% cotton T-shirt is composed of interconnected microscale hollow cotton fibres with diameters of 7–9 μm. Cotton has a striking hydrophilic ability due to which it can absorb a large number of polar solvents such as water and ethanol. After soaking the cotton T-shirt in a precursor solution for 3 h, the cotton T-shirt fully absorbs the solution with the titanium source. After annealing at 1200 °C for 3 h in argon, the cotton cloth template is consumed and TiC hollow fibre cloth is successfully formed with well-preserved cloth morphology (Fig. 1b–d and Fig. S2a, ESI,† see the Experimental section). The obtained microscale TiC fibres (8–10 μm) maintain the hollow structure (Fig. 1c) and the walls of TiC fibres are made up of interconnected nanoparticles of 100–500 nm. Further insight into the microstructure of the TiC fibres is provided by TEM examination (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). The TEM results confirm that the TiC fibre consists of interconnected nanoparticles of 100–500 nm leaving numerous nanopores of 10–100 nm. Moreover, the measured spacing between two adjacent lattices is 0.22 nm, which is consistent with the (002) planes of cubic TiC (JCPDS 65-0242). The phase and component of the TiC fibres are supported by XRD, Raman and energy dispersive (EDS) spectra analysis (Fig. S2d–f, ESI†). According to the BET test (inset in Fig. S2e, ESI†), the TiC hollow fibres exhibit a surface area of ∼126 m2 g−1.

In order to construct more porous electrode structures with higher surface areas, an intermediate step was taken to cover the TiC HFC with carbon nanofibres with diameters of 80–100 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†). Both sides of TiC fibre cloth undergo EPD to ensure uniform deposition of carbon nanofibres. The carbon nanofibres were pre-prepared by a standard CVD method (see the Experimental section). The as-fabricated carbon nanofibres have two different morphologies: coiled fibres and common straight fibres. These two types of carbon nanofibres on the TiC hollow fibres are interwoven with each other forming a network of high surface area, rather than straight branches. More evidence of the amorphous carbon fibres is provided by XRD and Raman spectra (Fig. S3g and h, ESI†) as well as TEM examination (Fig. S4, ESI†).
The integrated TiC HFNT electrode is formed after two other steps: ALD and carbothermal treatment (Fig. 1e–g). Here, the ALD-TiO2 layer is first coated on the carbon nanofibres and finally converts into a TiC nanotube after carbothermal treatment at 1200 °C for 3 h. The 3D porous architecture is well preserved for the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes, which consist of TiC hollow fibre substructure and TiC nanotube superstructure. Note that they are flexible like common cloth. The overall size of the branched fibre is about 12 μm (Fig. 1e and f). The TiC nanotubes exhibit smooth surface and diameters ranging from 180 to 200 nm (Fig. 1e). These nanotubes are also interwoven with each other. The tubular structure of TiC is clearly distinguished from the TEM images (Fig. 2a and b). The wall thickness of the TiC nanotubes is about 50 nm, the same as ALD TiO2 thickness. In addition, the SAED pattern reveals the existence of crystalline TiC and the lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.22 nm corresponding to the (002) planes of cubic TiC (JCPDS 65-0242) (Fig. 2c). The composition of the nanotube is further confirmed by the elemental maps of Ti and C (Fig. 2e) and the EDS spectrum (Cu is from the TEM copper grid) (Fig. 2d).

The integrated TiC HFNT electrodes are further characterized by XRD, Raman and XPS to check the phase and component. Data are presented in Fig. 3. Compared with Fig. S4a and b (ESI†), the carbon peak disappears and only characteristic peaks of TiC are left in the XRD pattern and Raman spectrum (Fig. 3a and b), confirming the TiC phase. Meanwhile, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to investigate the surface elemental composition of the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes. For the Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 3c), the observed binding energies of 454.9 and 460.9 eV are attributed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of the TiC phase. The interval between two peaks is about 6.0 eV, which is in good agreement with that of TiC in the literature.18–20 For the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 3d), the broad peak at 281.9 eV is assigned to the carbon peak in a metal carbide environment. The specific surface area of the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes is calculated to be ∼255 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3e), which is higher than that (∼126 m2 g−1) of the TiC HFC electrodes above. More importantly, the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes have a high electrical conductivity up to ∼1.1 × 105 S m−1 measured by the four points probe technique. It is well accepted that high electrical conductivity and large surface area are of great importance for the higher performance in electrochemical energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). For our TiC HFNT electrodes, we now see that all these desirable characteristics are integrated into one, thus superior electrochemical energy performance could be anticipated.

Supercapacitor performance
To demonstrate the potential application for electrochemical energy storage, in the present work, we assembled coin-type symmetric supercapacitors with the integrated TiC HFNT electrodes as both cathode and anode in an organic electrolyte composed of 1.5 M LiClO4 acetonitrile solution (see experimental section). It is noteworthy that our organic electrolyte has the advantages of high voltage window (0–2 V) and wide-temperature (−45 to 80 °C) stability compared to the water electrolyte. The water electrolyte has a narrower voltage window of 0–1.23 V. And in the water electrolyte, detrimental side reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction will occur, which is particularly serious at temperatures above 45 °C. For comparison, we also assembled symmetric supercapacitors based on other control electrodes: (i) a carbon fibre cloth electrode prepared from a cotton T-shirt (designated as CFC, an electrical conductivity of ∼1350 S m−1) (Fig. S5, ESI†), (ii) a carbon fibre cloth supported carbon nanofibre electrode (designated as CFC + CNF, an electrical conductivity of ∼1760 S m−1) (Fig. S6, ESI†), and (iii) a TiC hollow fibre cloth (designated as TiC HFC, an electrical conductivity of ∼105 S m−1). In our experiment, the selected working voltage window is 0–1.6 V, which is a very stale voltage window that side reactions such as decomposition of the electrolyte can be avoided.
As shown in Fig. 4a and b and Fig. S7 (ESI†), obviously, all four electrodes exhibit typical EDLC behavior with rectangular CV curves at different scanning rates and no redox peaks are observed. This indicates that TiC is an active EDLC material similar to carbon, which is also supported by the CV at the low scanning rate (2.5 mV s−1) and Raman measurement before and after charging (Fig. S8, ESI†). Comparatively, supercapacitors with the TiC HFNT electrodes show much higher current density and larger enclosed area of the CV curve than other counterparts at the same scanning rate (Fig. S9a, ESI†), implying their best electrochemical reactivity and energy storage performance, followed successively by TiC HFC, CFC + CNF and CFC electrodes. This result is supported by the corresponding charge–discharge measurements at 2 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. S9b and c, ESI†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was conducted to elucidate the superior performance of the TiC HFNT electrodes. Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plots of all four electrodes at room temperature at the fully discharge state. The four plots all consist of a depressed semicircle in the high-frequency range and a long low-frequency line. The intercept on the Z real axis is attributed to the resistance of the electrolyte (Rs), the diameter of the semicircle reflects the charge transfer resistance (Rct) related to the charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface. Apparently, the TiC HFNT electrodes have the smallest Rs value and amplitude of the semicircle, indicating their lowest charge transfer resistance and electrolyte resistance, followed successively by TiC HFC, CFC + CNF and CFC electrodes. Such an integrated highly conductive network can enhance the charge transfer kinetics and diminish the polarization, resulting in high-rate performance.

The electrochemical results (specific capacitance at different rates, energy density and power density) of all four symmetric supercapacitors at room temperature are shown in Fig. 4d, Fig. S10 (ESI†) (also tabulated in Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). The TiC HFNT electrodes exhibit a specific capacity ranging from 185 F g−1 (41.6 F cm−3) at 2 A g−1 to 146 F g−1 (32.8 F cm−3) at 30 A g−1 (based on the mass of one electrode). 79% capacitance is maintained when the current changes from 2 to 30 A g−1. These values are higher than those of other counterparts. This capacitance improvement is also reflected in the full supercapacitors (see Fig. S10b and Table S2, ESI†). The full supercapacitors based on the TiC HFNT electrodes show a capacity of 44 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 34.8 F g−1 at 15 A g−1 (based on the total mass of cathode, anode and separator), around 1.5 times higher than the counterparts with TiC HFC and CFC + CNT electrodes, and 2.8 times higher than the supercapacitors with CFC electrodes. Ragone plots in Fig. 4e (also Table S2, ESI†) show the comparison of the power and energy densities of full supercapacitor devices. The all-TiC HFNT based supercapacitor shows an energy density of 12.4 W h kg−1 at the power density of 11 kW kg−1. This value is higher than all three counterparts. These results demonstrate the noticeable high-rate capability and high energy/power performance of the TiC HFNT electrodes at room temperature (25 °C). Such outstanding performance of the TiC HFNT electrodes originates from the rationale design of the hierarchical structure. First, the robust connection of microscale hollow fibre substructure and nanotube superstructure can efficiently provide a large active surface area, which facilitates the ion/electron transportation and shortens their transfer path. Second, the good electrical conductivity of TiC decreases the charge transfer resistance resulting in lower inner resistance and better reaction kinetics. Both features account for the high-rate capability.
The full supercapacitor is very stable in cycling tests up to 160000 cycles. Fig. 4f shows the high-rate cycling trend of four supercapacitors at 25 °C (numerical data in Table S3, ESI†). Impressively, the TiC HFNT electrodes exhibit excellent cycling life and deliver a high capacitance retention of 99% at 2 A g−1 after 50000 cycles (183 F g−1), 98% at 5 A g−1 after 100000 cycles (176 F g−1), and 97% at 10 A g−1 after 150000 cycles (169 F g−1), respectively. The excellent cycling stability can be ascribed to the structural stability of the electrode materials; no evident degradation of the hollow fibers or nanotubes was observed by SEM and TEM examinations after 160000 cycles (see Fig. S11, ESI†). It is worth noting that both TiC-based electrodes (TiC HFNT and TiC HFC) have very stable cycling life compared to the carbon-based ones (CFC + CNF and CFC). Through a comprehensive comparison (see Table S4, ESI†), the electrochemical results of the TiC HFNT electrodes are comparable, or superior to some carbon based materials,41–45 but lower than some highly porous nanocarbons,46–48 and the light-weight and highly-conductive 3D graphene/carbon nanotube composite electrodes.49–51 It is known that carbon material electrodes may have the issue of oxidation at high current densities. The ability of anti-oxidation of the TiC electrodes is therefore advantageous for operation at high current densities, leading to excellent rate capability. Therefore, it is indicated that the TiC-based electrodes are a promising type of EDLC electrode for high-performance supercapacitors.
We now present and discuss the temperature-dependent electrochemical properties of the full supercapacitors. It is well known that the working temperature will greatly affect the ion conductivity and stability of the electrolyte. From the CV curves and galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles (Fig. 5a and b and Fig. S12, ESI†), it is clear that the reactivity and capacitance of all four electrodes increase with the working temperature from −15 to 65 °C. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the organic electrolyte has better ion conductivity at higher working temperatures (see EIS data below) and leads to higher capacitance and electrochemical reactivity. As shown in Table S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 5c, the TiC HFNT electrodes deliver a capacitance of 120 F g−1 at −15 °C, which increases to 192 F g−1 at 65 °C (based on the mass of a single electrode). And again the capacitance of the TiC HFNT electrode is consistently higher than other types of electrodes. Similar results are obtained in full supercapacitors. In particular, the capacitances of TiC-based electrodes (TiC HFNT and TiC HFC electrodes) at −15 °C account for ∼67% of the values obtained at 25 °C, much higher than the carbon-based electrodes (CFC + CNF and CFC electrodes, 53–54%), implying that the TiC-based electrodes possess a high working efficiency at low temperatures and are good active materials for low-temperature supercapacitors. At a high temperature of 65 °C, capacitance enhancement is observed for all electrodes and do not show degradation due to the temperature-stability of our organic electrolyte (no decomposition and side reactions up to 65 °C). To check the reactivity of the electrode at different temperatures, EIS measurements of the TiC HFNT electrodes were conducted from −15 to 65 °C (Fig. 5d). Note that both the resistance of the electrolyte and the charge transfer resistance decrease with increasing working temperature. The higher ion conductivity at higher temperatures corresponds to better reaction kinetics, in agreement with the above-mentioned CV and charge–discharge results. The TiC-based electrodes also have an excellent cycling stability at both −15 °C and 65 °C for at least 50000 cycles (Fig. 5e and Table S6, ESI†). In addition, at temperatures higher than 65 °C, the device performance starts to become worse, in particular the cycling performance. At higher temperatures, the electrolyte becomes more volatile, which may cause inner pressure in the full devices and lead to a catastrophic impact on the electrode. This is more serious when the temperature is above 75 °C. Based on these electrochemical results, we can confidently conclude that the TiC-based integrated electrodes possess superior wide-temperature supercapacitive performance (higher capacitance and better high-rate capability) and excellent long cycling life. Both are superior to the corresponding carbon-based counterparts.

Conclusions
We have directionally designed and fabricated a tubular TiC fibre cloth as a new supercapacitor electrode material. The TiC electrodes are constructed from a commercial cotton T-shirt as both the carbon source and the sacrificial template. In particular, the all-TiC hollow fibre–nanotube integrated electrode shows high conductivity and interconnected porous structure. The organic symmetric supercapacitors based on TiC HFNT integrated electrodes show outstanding EDLC performance with relatively high capacitance and stable cycling life at both low and high temperatures. Therefore, the TiC hollow fibre electrodes could be a promising wide-temperature EDLC material with excellent anti-degradation in an organic electrolyte. While the weight specific capacitance of the tubular TiC fibre cloth electrode is still not competitive with carbon nanotubes or graphene, it is comparable or even superior to many carbon materials (see ESI†). In all, we have demonstrated not only the potential of TiC to act as a supercapacitor but also the rationale of nanostructuring in boosting the energy storage performance.
Experimental
Preparation of TiC hollow fibre cloth (HFC) electrodes
In a typical synthesis, 0.3 g Ni(NO3)2 and 0.6 g NaF were first dissolved into 50 ml ethanol and then 1.8 g TiO2 powder was added to form emulsion under ultrasound irradiation. After stirring for 2 h, a piece of cotton T-shirt of 5 × 10 cm2 was dipped into the above emulsion and stirred for 3 h, then the cotton textile was taken out and dried at 110 °C for 2 h. Finally, the cotton textile was placed in a sealed corundum crucible and heated at 1200 °C for 3 h under continuous flow of argon. The carbothermal reactions for the formation of TiC fibres were very complex. The involved reactions might be as follows.25 NaF(l) → Na(g) + F2(g)(1) Ni@C(s) → Ni(C)(l)(2) 2TiO2(s) + xF2(g) + 4C(s) → 2TiFx(g) + 4CO(3) 2TiFx(g) + 2Ni(C)(l) → 2Ni(Ti,C)(l) + xF2(g)(4) Ni(Ti,C)(l) → TiC(s) + Ni(l)(5) After that, the sample was immersed in 0.2 M KMnO4 for 1 h at 85 °C and 0.2 M HCl for 1 h, respectively, to remove the leftover carbon and nickel catalyst to obtain TiC hollow fibre cloth (HFC) electrodes.
Preparation of TiC hollow fibre–carbon nanofibre electrodes
First, carbon nanofibre powder was fabricated by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The catalyst precursor was prepared by mixing 50 ml of 0.1 M CuCl2 and 50 ml of 0.1 M sodium–potassium tartrate to form a copper tartrate precipitate. The dried copper tartrate was transferred to the reaction tube. The CVD reaction was conducted at 250 °C for 2 h in argon with flowing acetylene as the carbon source under atmospheric pressure. Then, the sample was immersed in a solution of 1 M FeCl3 and 0.5 M HCL for 3 h to completely dissolve the copper catalyst. Finally, the sample was annealed at 800 °C for 4 h under argon to form carbon nanofibres. The obtained carbon nanofibres were deposited on the surface of TiC hollow fibre cloth by an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. The electrolyte for EPD was obtained by dispersing 50 mg of carbon nanofibre powder in 100 ml of isopropyl alcohol to form stable carbon nanofibre colloids after adding 50 mg of Mg(NO3)2. EPD was performed in a standard two-electrode glass cell at room temperature, with a TiC hollow fibre cloth with a size of 2 × 3 cm2 as the working electrode and a Pt foil as the counter-electrode. The distance between the two electrodes was 1 cm and EPD was carried out by applying 60 V for 80 s. Both sides of the TiC hollow fibre cloth were subjected to EPD to ensure the homogeneous deposition of carbon nanofibres.
Preparation of TiC hollow fibre–nanotube (HFNT) electrodes
The TiC HFNT electrodes were synthesized by the combination of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and carbothermal process. A layer of TiO2 (thickness ∼ 50 nm) was coated on the surface on the carbon nanofibres on TiC hollow fibre cloth by atomic layer deposition (ALD Beneq TFS 200) with TiCl4 and H2O as the Ti and O precursors, respectively. Then, the samples were annealed at 1200 °C under an argon atmosphere for 3 h to form the TiC HFNT integrated electrodes. The simplified reaction would be TiO2 + 3C → TiC + 2CO.
Preparation of carbon fibre cloth (CFC) electrodes
The CFC electrodes were prepared by a pyrolysis of commercial cotton T-shirt, which was annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in argon. The mass of the CFC electrode is about 4.0 mg cm−2.
Preparation of carbon fibre cloth supported carbon nanofibre (CFC + CNF) electrodes
The CFC + CNF electrodes were prepared by EPD of carbon nanofibres on CFC. The EPD process was the same as that aforementioned. The mass of the CFC + CNF electrode is about 5.8 mg cm−2.
Characterization of integrated electrodes
The phase and microstructure of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU D/Max-2550 with Cu Kα radiation), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI SIRION), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F), Raman spectroscopy (WITec-CRM200 Raman system with a laser wavelength of 532 nm), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer System 2000 FTIR interferometer) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5700). The surface areas of samples were determined by BET measurements using a NOVA-1000e surface area analyzer.
Supercapacitor fabrication and electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performances of the TiC HFNT integrated electrodes were tested in CR2025 coin-type symmetric supercapacitors, in which the TiC HFNT electrodes were used as both the positive and negative electrodes without any ancillary materials. The mass of TiC HFNT electrodes was about 9 mg cm−2, in which the mass of TiC hollow fibres and TiC nanotubes was 6.1 and 2.9 mg cm−2, respectively. In our experiment, the different components were weighed by using an analytical balance with high measure resolution (0.01 mg). The electrolyte was an organic electrolyte with 1.5 M LiClO4 in a nonaqueous acetonitrile solution. The positive and negative electrodes were separated by a porous non-woven cloth separator and assembled into coin-type symmetric supercapacitors. A series of electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). In order not to exceed the current range of the electrochemical working station, the CV test was conducted using small-sized (∼0.5 cm2) full supercapacitor devices. The EIS measurements were conducted with a superimposed 5 mV sinusoidal voltage in the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz. The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were conducted using a Xinwei battery program-control test system with a current range up to 10 A.
The specific capacitance and energy/power density were calculated according to the following equations. For a symmetrical capacitor, assuming the capacitance of the single electrode was CS, then the total capacitance (CT) of the full supercapacitor would be 1/2CS according to the equation: (6) The specific capacitance of the full supercapacitor (CST) was calculated according to the following equation. (7)where CST (F g−1) is the specific capacitance of the full supercapacitor, I (mA) represents discharge current through the full supercapacitors, and M (mg), ΔV (V) and Δt (s) designate the mass of full supercapacitors (here mainly including anode, cathode and separator), potential drop during discharge and total discharge time, respectively. The specific capacitance of single electrode (CSS) was about 4CST. The specific capacitance of the single electrode (CSS) was calculated according to the following equation. (8)where CSS (F g−1) is the specific capacitance of the single electrode, I (mA) represents discharge current through the full supercapacitors, and m (mg), ΔV (V) and Δt (s) designate the mass of the single electrode, potential drop during discharge and total discharge time, respectively.
The energy density (ET) of the full supercapacitors was derived according to the following equation: (9)where E (W h kg−1) is the energy density, CST (F g−1) is the specific capacitance of the full supercapacitors, and ΔV (V) is the discharge voltage range.
The power density (P) of the full supercapacitors was calculated from the following equation. (10)where P (W kg−1) is the power density and Δt (s) is the discharge time.

Broader context
The energy/power density of supercapacitors is mainly controlled by the electrochemical reactivity and reaction kinetics of electrode materials, namely the kinetics of ion and electron transport in electrodes and at the electrode/electrolyte interface. High performance relies largely on scrupulous directional design/fabrication of electrode materials. Tailored electrode materials with judicious nanostructure can meet the critical requirements such as enhanced ion/electron conductivity, faster reaction kinetics and stronger mechanical stability, leading to enhanced supercapacitor performances with high energy/power densities and superior cycling stability. Herein we present the controllable synthesis of a tubular TiC fibre cloth as an interesting type of stable supercapacitive material. To demonstrate the rationale of nanostructure design in energy storage, the hollow fibres are further covered by interwoven TiC nanotube branches, forming 3D tubular all-TiC hierarchical fibres. Compared to metal oxides, the TiC fibers have the properties of high electrical conductivity, high surface area, and mechanical stability. We assemble organic symmetric supercapacitors based on hollow TiC cloth electrodes and demonstrate high-rate energy storage with wide-temperature high specific capacitances and long-term cycling stability.
