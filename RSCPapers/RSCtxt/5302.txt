    , Accepted 26th April 2013First published on 30th April 2013AbstractTwo new D–A alternating copolymers, PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT, featuring a fluorinated benzothiazole (BT) electron-acceptor unit and the electron-donor segments of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), were prepared by a standard Stille cross-coupling reaction. The resulting copolymers were characterized by TGA, GPC, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements. PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT show good film forming properties. Bulk heterojunction polymer photovoltaic devices based on an active layer of the electron donor copolymers (PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT), blended with an electron acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in three weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 were investigated. The devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al demonstrated promising power conversion efficiencies of 3.3% for PBDFFBT:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) and 4.0% for PBDTFBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs),1 which are composed of a photoactive layer of a p-type conjugated polymer donor (such as P3HT) and an n-type soluble fullerene derivative acceptor (such as PCBM),2,3 have been a vigorous research topic from both the industry and academic communities for photovoltaics over the past decade because of their outstanding features such as low-cost, light-weight, flexibility, easy processability over a large-area size via printing and their great potential application for the realization of flexible devices over a large area.4,5 Inspiring success has been achieved over the past few years in polymer solar cells. Recently, Wu and his co-workers have reported a PCE over 9% for PTB7 (thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene) using an inverted device structure.6 However, it is still low for applications when compared with inorganic solar cells which have been commercialized widely. When it comes to realize such applications, there is still a long way to develop excellent materials and suitable device designs.7
To obtain high performance PSCs, it is very critical to develop low bandgap polymers with broad absorption, deep-lying HOMO energy levels and high hole mobility.8 The most effective strategy for obtaining low bandgap polymers is to copolymerize electron rich donors and electron deficient acceptors into the backbone.9 Both benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]difuran (BDF) have coplanar geometries and rigid structures which can lead to high charge mobility.10 Wu et al. improved the PCE of a BDT-based copolymer up to 8% with a modified layer,11 Hou et al. firstly reported a BDF-based copolymer with a high PCE up to 5%.12 But there is still the need for suitable electron acceptor moieties to combine with such good donors to achieve a high PCE. Benzothiadiazole (BT) has been proved to be a good acceptor unit. Adding an electron-deficient group into the polymer backbone can lower its energy levels.13 Thus, when attaching a fluorine atom onto a BT-derivative, a higher Jsc and PCE can be achieved by delocalizing the LUMO wave function.5g,14 Peng et al. and Jen et al. reported a partially fluorinated low bandgap polymer, PBDT-FBT and PCPDTFBT, respectively. PBDT-FBT shows a high PCE of 6.21% and PCPDTFBT exhibits a promising PCE of 5.51%.14,15 However, it seemed complicated, of high cost and difficult to synthesize the monomer-FBT which is not beneficial for scaling up. Taking all this into account, we synthesized a new acceptor: 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT). In this work, we can obtained the FBT monomer using a simple two step method; in addition, we attached a dodecyl chain to the thiophene to increase the solubility of the polymers. The two new D–A copolymers from a BT derived acceptor unit-FBT and the electron-donor segments of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT (as shown in Scheme 1) were designed and synthesized towards photovoltaic applications. The copolymers show a broad absorption from 300 nm to 800 nm. From their absorption spectra, we can see that the absorption edges of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT are located at 773 nm and 775 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the films of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT blended with PCBM exhibit a hole mobility of 1.83 × 10−2 cm−2 v−1 s−1 and 4.98 × 10−2 cm−2 v−1 s−1, respectively, using the SCLC method. The PSCs based on PBDTFBT as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor demonstrated a PCE up to 4.0% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 9.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.6, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2.

Experimental
Materials
Pd(PPh3)4 and 3,4-diamino-1-fluorobenzene (1) were obtained from Alfa Asia Chemical Co, and they were used without further purification. Toluene was dried over molecular sieves and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as analytical-grade quality and used without further purification. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (size: 200–300 mesh). Tributyl(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane (4),16 5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (2), 4,7dibromo-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (3) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene M2 were synthesized according to the reported literatures.17,18 2,6-Bis-(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]difuran (M1) was synthesized according to our previous report.19 All of the other compounds were synthesized following the procedures described herein.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K, unless specified otherwise. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. Molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene as standard (Waters 515 HPLC pump, a Waters 2414 differential refractometer, and three Waters Styragel columns (HT2, HT3, and HT4)) using THF (HPLC grade) as eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 35 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 with a heating rate of 20 K min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. For the solid state measurements, a polymer solution in chloroform was spin-coated onto quartz plates. The cyclic voltammetry was recorded with a computer controlled Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation using polymer films on a carbon electrode (1.0 cm2) as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) as the reference electrode in an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical onsets were determined at the position where the current starts to differ from the baseline. The morphology of the polymer/PC71BM blend films was investigated by a SPI 3800N atomic force microscope (AFM) in contacting mode with a 5 μm scanner.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
The PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass positive electrode and a Ca/Al negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 15–20 Ω/□ was purchased from CSG Holding Co. Ltd. (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 25 min. Then PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Baytron PVP Al 4083, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s onto the ITO substrate. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 15 min in the air, and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer is about 40 nm. The polymers and PC71BM (10 mg mL−1 for polymers) were dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) overnight, and spin-cast at 2000 rpm for 45 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the photoactive layer is about 150 nm measured by a Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A bilayer cathode consisting of Ca (∼20 nm) capped with Al (∼80 nm) was thermally evaporated under a shadow mask with a base pressure of ca. 10−5 Pa. The active area of the PSCs is 4 mm2. Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 67005, 500 W), calibrating by a standard silicon cell. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 236 digital source meter. A xenon lamp with AM 1.5 filter was used as the white light source and the optical power was 100 mW cm−2. The EQE measurements of the PSCs were performed using a Stanford Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and 500 W xenon lamp. A calibrated silicon detector was used to determine the absolute photosensitivity at different wavelengths. All of these fabrications and characterizations after the cleaning of the ITO substrates were conducted in a glove box.
Synthesis of the monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 2. The detailed synthetic procedures are as follows.

The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then 30 mL chloroform and 30 mL deionized water were added. The mixture was washed several times with water, rinsed with saturated sodium sulfite and rinsed with saturated sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was collected and dried over reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographically purified on a silica gel column eluting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:20, v/v) to afford compound 3 as a white solid (1.72 g, 55%). 1H NMR (400 Hz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 7.79 (d, 1H); MS: 312 (M+).

To a solution of compound 5 (2.50 g, 3.82 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (75 mL) and chloroform (75 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (1.50 g, 8.42 mmol) in one portion. The mixture was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 24 h. The solution was concentrated in vacuum and the residue was chromatographically purified on a silica gel column eluting with dichloromethane/petroleum ether (1:10, v/v) to afford compound 6 as an orange-red crystal (2.36 g, 76%). 1H NMR (400 Hz, CDCl3, ppm): δ: 7.95 (s, 1H), 7.75 (s, 1H), 7.66–7.62 (d, 1H), 2.65–2.62 (t, 4H), 1.66–1.26 (m, 40H), 0.89–0.87 (t, 6H); MS: 812 (M+).
Synthesis of PBDFFBT
4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (6) (162.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]difuran (M1) (148.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of dry toluene. The solution was flushed with Ar for 20 min and then Pd(PPh3)4 (20 mg, 0.016 mmol) was added into the flask. The flask was purged three times with successive vacuum and argon filling cycles. Then the oil bath was heated to 110 °C carefully, and the mixture was stirred for two days at this temperature under argon atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then poured into methanol (100 mL) slowly. The resulting precipitate was filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane and chloroform. Finally the polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. The brown solid was dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight (156 mg, yield: 51%).
Synthesis of PBDTFBT
PBDTFBT was synthesized as a tan solid with a yield of 23% according to the method of PBDFFBT described above.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The general synthetic route to the monomers and polymers is shown in Scheme 2. Compound 6 was copolymerized with the di-tin derivative (M1, M2) through Stille coupling reactions to obtain the target polymers PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT, respectively. The polymers were purified by continuous Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane and CHCl3. And then the CHCl3 fraction was reduced in volume, precipitated into methanol and collected by filtration, to yield a brown or tan solid. The molecular weight of the polymers was determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT is 5360 and 6062 g mol−1, with a PDI of 1.2 and 2.5, respectively, the related data are summarized in the Table 1. Given the low molecular weight of the polymers, it is believed that the photovoltaic performance of these kind of polymers can be further improved from the material aspect, such as optimizing the polymerization conditions to increase the molecular weight and improving the polymer purity.

Thermal stability
The thermal stability of polymers is an important parameter for device fabrication. The thermal stability of the copolymer was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fig. 1 displays the TGA thermograms of the two polymers, PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT. The TGA results reveal that, under the protection of an inert atmosphere, the onset points of the weight loss (5%) of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT are ca. 340 °C, and 330 °C, respectively. The thermal data of the two polymers are shown in Table 1. A good thermal stability of the resulting copolymers prevents the deformation of the copolymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under an applied electric field.

Optical properties
The photophysical characteristics of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectra in a dilute CHCl3 solution and in a solid film spin-coated on a quartz substrate. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the two copolymers are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding optical results are summarized in Table 2. Absorption spectra of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT show two bands: one band in the wavelength of ca. 300–500 nm and the other band in the range of 500–800 nm. The absorption maxima of the copolymers in solution are located at 612 and 559 nm, while those of the thin films are at 683 and 616 nm, respectively for PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT. Compared to the solution absorption, the absorption in the films is broaden and red-shifted by 71 nm and 54 nm for PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT, indicating large intermolecular interactions in solid state. The optical bandgaps deduced from the PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT film absorption edges are 1.60 eV and 1.63 eV, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is broadly employed to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of copolymers.20 In order to get more significant parameters for the PSC fabrication, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the two polymers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was carried out in a 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at room temperature under argon with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. All the potentials are reported vs. Ag/AgCl with the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple as an internal standard assuming the absolute energy level of Fc/Fc+ to be 4.8 eV below vacuum.21 CV curves of the two polymers are shown in Fig. 3. In a positive potential region, the oxidation is quasi-reversible; the onset oxidation potential (Eoxon) is 0.93 V vs. Ag/AgCl for PBDFFBT. And for PBDTFBT, Eoxon is 0.90 V vs. Ag/AgCl. From the Eoxon and Eredon of the copolymers, we calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers according to the equation:22HOMO = −e(Eoxon + 4.4) (eV)LUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.4) (eV)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT films on a glassy carbon electrode in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6, CH3CN solution. 
Using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, the oxidation potential of Fc/F+c is 0.4 V. The calculated HOMO energy levels of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT are −5.33 eV and −5.30 eV. The HOMO level of PBDFFBT is very similar to that of PBDTFBT. Accordingly, the LUMO levels are −3.58 eV and −3.57 eV for PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT. From Fig. 3, the cathodic current in the wave at −1 V is severals time lower than the anodic current for polymers, which may be from the acceptor unit-FBT. The related CV data are summarized in Table 2 for comparison.
Hole mobility
Hole mobility plays a direct effect on the charge transport in PSCs. Therefore, we measured the hole mobilities of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model which is based on the Poole–Frenkel Law using a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:2, w/w)/Au.23 The results are plotted as ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5, as shown in Fig. 4. Herein, J is current density, d stands for the thickness of the device, and V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential. The SCLC model can be described by eqn (1): (1)
 Fig. 4  ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5 plots of the polymer/PCBM blends for the hole mobility by the SCLC method. 
According to the eqn (1) and Fig. 4, the hole mobilities of PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT are calculated to be 1.83 × 10−2 cm2 v−1 s−1 and 4.98 × 10−2 cm2 v−1 s−1, respectively. The results show that the hole mobility of the PBDTFBT/PCBM blend is a little higher than that of PBDFFBT/PCBM blend under the same conditions, which may be from the close π–π stacking of PBDTFBT, which is beneficial for obtaining a higher mobility.19
Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate and compare the photovoltaic properties of the two copolymers, PSCs with a sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The polymer active layers were spin-coated from an ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution with different concentrations (polymer:PC71BM = 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3; w/w). Fig. 5a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on polymers:PC71BM blend under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding results of the devices are listed in Table 3. Jsc, Voc and FF show little difference between PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT-based solar cells; a high Jsc comes from strong absorbance and good charge transport in the active layer. The relatively higher Voc is from the deep-lying HOMO level compared to that of P3HT. Although having very similar HOMO levels, the polymers exhibit 0.1 V difference of Voc, which may be from their blend morphology or interchain stacking because Voc has been affected by many factors besides the HOMO level of the polymers.24 A high FF shows a balanced transport in the PSCs. The photovoltaic properties are affected by many parameters especially by the donor–acceptor (D–A) ratio. From Table 3, we can see that Voc and FF are decreasing while Jsc is increasing, which may be correlated to the increasing ratio of PC71BM. The resulting PCE of PBDTFBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) reached up to 4.0% without annealing or any additives, which is better than that of PBDFFBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) (3.1%) under the same conditions. From Fig. 5b, the complementary absorbance of PC71BM and the polymers gives a relatively high photo-conversion efficiency over the wavelength range of 370 to 650 nm, with monochromatic EQE values above 25%. It is worth noting that the Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum matches well with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V measurements.25 Five measurements for every polymer with every ratio were investigated here and all the results were reproducible within experimental error. Preliminary results are promising and furthermore we are currently aiming at high performance copolymers by testing this fluorinated monomer with other electron donors and different device conditions.

Morphology
The morphology of the photoactive layer is also one important parameter for PSCs, in some cases the performance of the devices strongly depends on its morphological features.26 Therefore, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the surface morphology of the active layer by spin-coating blends onto an ITO glass similar to the preparation of the active layer in the photovoltaic devices. AFM topographic and phase images are shown in Fig. 6. The surface rms (root mean-square) roughness of the polymer:PC71BM films (1:2, w/w) are 7.86 nm and 3.08 nm for PBDFFBT and PBDTFBT, respectively. From Fig. 6, we can see that PBDTFBT shows a better phase separation. For the PBDFFBT:PC71BM blend, Fig. 6A shows that the domains are not distributed very well throughout the surface, revealing a little aggregation of one component (PBDFFBT or PC71BM), which maybe influences the formation of the interpenetrating bicontinuous network between the polymer donor and the PC71BM which then affects the charge generation and transportation.27 For the PBDTFBT:PC71BM blend, the blend films are smoother than those of PBDFFBT:PC71BM. The rough surface and coarse phase separation of PBDFFBT:PC71BM, at least in part, explain the relatively lower PCE and hole mobility.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized two new D–A conjugated polymers containing a fluorinated benzodithiazole (BT) electron acceptor unit and the electron donor segments of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), by Stille cross-coupling polymerization reactions. The synthesized copolymers demonstrated good absorption in the visible region and high hole mobility. Preliminary photovoltaic results using the blend of PBDTFBT and PC71BM (1:2, w/w) as the active layer afforded a PCE up to 4% with a Voc of 0.72 V, Jsc of 9.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.6. For PBDFFBT blended with PC71BM (1:3, w/w) as the active layer, the PCE reaches up to 3.3%. It is believed that the photovoltaic properties can be further improved by modifications to the polymer backbone and different device processing conditions such as a different blend ratios, additives and thermal annealing etc.
