1. Introduction
PerSCs have attracted worldwide attention due to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as a low band gap, high absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility, and long exciton diffusion length. In the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PerSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 25.2%.1–3 PerSCs are usually composed of a PAL, an ETL, a hole transport layer (HTL) and two electrodes (anode and cathode). According to the way of stacking of the functional layers, PerSCs can be divided into two different device configurations: conventional n–i–p type and inverted p–i–n type.4 Letter “i” represents perovskite materials which have accomplished great progress with wide absorption, excellent charge carrier separation and transport, and very good stability properties.5–9 On the other side, the “n” or “p” type transport layer plays a role in extracting charge carriers efficiently, avoiding charge carrier accumulation and recombination loss in the photoactive layer, respectively. The development of ETLs and HTLs is becoming more and more important as they have great influence on the performance of PALs. Particularly the extraction of electrons by ETLs has a great effect on controlling the overall device performance.10 A good ETM should have excellent electron transport properties, the ability to form a dense uniform film, energy levels well matching with that of the PAL, good morphological stability and low cost. In addition, the ability to passivate defects in the PAL is preferred.11 Until now, most reported highly efficient PerSCs are based on the conventional n–i–p device configuration using inorganic ETMs as ETLs, such as TiO2, ZnO and SnO2. However, high-temperature sintering (TiO2 > 450 °C) is usually the essential procedure to achieve high electron mobility, and high-density defect states may exhibit owing to surface crystal defects, so extra passivation to surface crystal defects is needed. These problems of inorganic ETLs much limit the low-cost commercialization and flexible application of PerSCs. In recent years, low-temperature, solution processable and diverse organic ETLs have been largely investigated as potential alternatives. Especially, inverted p–i–n PerSCs can be easily manufactured with a simple device structure and could be deposited at low temperature since both the HTL and ETL are organic semiconductors.
Fullerenes (C60, C70) and their soluble form phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are the widely used organic ETMs in inverted p–i–n PerSCs due to their excellent electron transport properties and PCBM is the most representative ETM,12–17 whereas, there are some intrinsic shortcomings for fullerene ETMs. Owing to diverse Sn and Pb-based halide perovskite materials in PerSCs, their conduction band changes a lot from −3.36 eV (MASnCl3) to −4.74 eV (FAPbI3).18 However, the LUMO level of fullerene ETMs can only be tuned in a narrow range because of the poor communication between the fullerene cage and its substituents.19,20 This in turns limits potential PAL/ETL combinations. Fullerenes also exhibit relatively poor morphological stability due to their relatively weak intermolecular interactions in the solid state, which is detrimental to the stability of PerSCs. Besides, high-cost material synthesis and purification are an obstacle for the commercial application of PerSCs.20–22
Recently, inspired by the rapid development of high-performance non-fullerene electron acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs), researchers have explored non-fullerene ETMs for PerSCs.23,24 Various non-fullerene ETMs have been reported as efficient ETLs or interfacial modifiers in PerSCs. They not only retain the n-type semiconductor properties of fullerenes, but also overcome some disadvantages of fullerenes by exhibiting properties such as readily tunable electronic energy levels, and good thermal and chemical stability. Their electronic, optical, and morphological characteristics can be rationally designed and precisely adjusted.25,26 Non-fullerene ETMs are emerging as a hot topic in the field of PerSCs. As shown in Fig. 1, they can be divided into four categories according to their chemical structures, namely rylene diimides (naphthalene diimide derivatives (NDIs) and perylene diimide derivatives (PDIs)), azaacene derivatives, indacenodithiophene (IDT) derivatives and n-type conjugated polymers.17 It was found that both the substituents and design strategies of molecular configuration play important roles in the properties of non-fullerene ETMs.27
 Fig. 1  A summary of typical non-fullerene organic ETMs. 
In this article, we reviewed the latest developments of non-fullerene organic ETMs used as ETLs in PerSCs according to the four categories. The common effects of substituents and design strategies of molecular configuration on the properties of non-fullerene ETMs were systematically summarized. The remaining challenges and promising future directions for PerSCs based on non-fullerene organic ETMs are also discussed.
2. Rylene diimide small molecules
Rylene diimides have two diimide groups at the end positions of rylene. They usually possess high chemical and thermal stabilities owing to their conjugated planar structure.25 Their synthetic raw materials are usually very cheap. Moreover, rylene diimides have many functionalized reaction sites, which makes them easy to be modified. PDIs and NDIs are two types of most studied n-type rylene diimides. Both electronic (LUMO, HOMO) and optical properties (absorption, fluorescence) of PDIs and NDIs can be tailored over wide ranges.17,28
2.1 PDIs as ETLs in PerSCs
PDIs are widely investigated as promising non-fullerene ETMs due to the above-mentioned advantages of ease of modification, low-lying energy levels, and good stability. However, compared with PCBM, the performance of devices based on PDI ETLs is still lower.22,29–32 The main problem for PDI derivatives is their strong aggregation due to their strong π–π stacking tendency, which affects the film morphology and transport properties. Therefore, it's necessary to introduce functional groups or design novel geometries of PDI derivatives to disrupt the planarity of PDIs. In addition, the control of energy levels and the passivation of the PAL should also be taken into account.

2.1.1 Effects of halogen atoms on PDIs. 
Halogen substitution will change the intermolecular force, which affects the arrangement of the molecules and solubility. As a result, PDI films with different halogen substituents show different morphologies and electron mobilities.33,34 PDI chemical structures with different halogen substituents are shown in Fig. 2 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 1.

Chen et al. studied the effect of halogen atoms on EH-PDI properties and the performance of PerSCs based on halogenated PDI ETLs. Br-PDI exhibited the highest solubility (>10−1 mol L−1) in chloroform and electron mobility (1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) among the three PDIs, while the corresponding values of EH-PDI and F-PDI are 8.7 × 10−2 mol L−1 and 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.2 × 10−2 mol L−1 and 8.31 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The good properties of Br-PDI could be attributed to the weaker intermolecular interactions because the Br atom of large atomic radius suppressed the aggregation of molecules, which gave a good film morphology, while the intermolecular interactions of F-PDI were very strong because of the π–π, F–π, and F–F interactions and its film morphology was the worst. The performance of devices based on F-PDI dropped sharply compared with EH-PDI, while the performance of devices based on Br-PDI was the best. The PCEs of PDI-based PerSCs could be further increased by the insertion of ZnO NPs as a cathode buffer layer.34 In 2019, using density functional theory Zhang et al. predicted the electron mobility to be in the order of F-PDI < EH-PDI < Cl-PDI < Br-PDI, which was well consistent with the experimental trend. In addition, Cl-PDI was theoretically predicted to have good hydrophobicity, solubility, electron mobility and stability.35 So Cl-PDI was also expected to be a high-performance ETM. Tetrachloro-substituted perylene diimide (TCl-PDI) has been used as an ETM in n–i–p planar PerSCs to replace TiO2. It was reported that PerSCs based on TCl-PDI showed higher PCE and stability than that based on TiO2, which was attributed to the well-matched energy level of TCl-PDI/PAL and the superior crystalline characteristics of the PAL formed on the hydrophobic TCl-PDI.36


2.1.2 Increase in the steric-hindrance effect of PDIs. 
The strong π–π stacking of PDI molecules is the main cause of aggregation, which leads to the poor solubility and film morphology.36 The increase of the steric-hindrance effect is a usual way to prevent excessive aggregation of PDIs. Some novel designs of twisted dimers or three-dimensional structure PDIs are reported as efficient ETMs which can form a denser and more uniform ETL, reduce the direct contact between the PAL and the cathode, and promote charge transfer.37 The chemical structures of PDIs with steric-hindrance effect are shown in Fig. 3 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 2.

Constructing PDI dimers is the most used approach due to synthetic accessibility. Priyadharsini et al. designed benzo[ghi]perylenetriimide (BPTI) and its dimer (t-BPTI) as novel ETL materials. It was found that t-BPTI with a twisted structure could effectively inhibit the self-aggregation of PDI molecules. A smooth and continuous morphology of t-BPTI on the PAL was obtained. The optimal t-BPTI-based device showed higher PCE than the BPTI based device.37 The morphology of PDI dimers could be further adjusted by solvent additives. Ye et al. provided a simple way to tune the morphology and transport properties of PDI dimers by solvent additive engineering. A series of solvent additives (1,8-diiodooctane, 1-chloronaphthalene, 1-phenylnaphthalene, and 1-methylnaphthalene) was investigated for their role in the morphology and transport properties of the PDI dimer (Bis-PDI-T-EG) film as well as on the photovoltaic performance of PerSCs. It was found that 1-methylnaphthalene was the best additive that possessed good adjusting ability to control both morphological and electrical properties of the Bis-PDI-T-EG film. The fabricated PerSCs with an optimized Bis-PDI-T-EG + 0.05 v/v% MN electron transport layer (ETL) displayed the best PCE of 14.96%.38 In addition, it was reported that the electron mobility of di-PDI could be further increased by adding an n-type dopant, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazole (DMBI), and an increased PCE could be obtained.39
Besides the twisted PDI dimers, a kind of more stereo molecule with a three-dimensional (3D) core is designed and termed as 3D PDI. This design rule makes inhibition of aggregation more effective and the charge transport isotropic. Jiang et al. reported a 3D molecule TPE-PDI4 with a tetraphenylethylene core, which showed good electron mobility, excellent solution processability, favorable film morphology, and compatible energy levels. It was used as an ETM in inverted p–i–n PerSCs and a PCE of 16.29% was finally obtained, which was slightly higher than that of the PCBM-based PerSC. Furthermore, a higher PCE of 18.78% was achieved when TPE-PDI4/C60 was used as a double ETL.40 Cheng et al. synthesized a 3D molecule SFX-PDI4 based on the Spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) core. The 3D structure of SFX-PDI4 exhibited low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels, high electron mobility and good film-formation properties. When applied in inverted p–i–n PerSCs, a high PCE of 15.3% was achieved without any significant hysteresis, which was just slightly lower than that of the device based on PCBM.41 Wang et al. designed two PDI trimers bridged by the truxene core, Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C. In the Tr-PDI3 molecule, the three PDI units were connected to the truxene by C–C bond, while Tr-PDI3-C was connected by a fused ring. Therefore, the Tr-PDI3 molecule showed a more twisted 3D structure than the Tr-PDI3-C molecule with a planar structure. The Tr-PDI3 film coated on the PAL exhibited smoother film morphology, and higher electron transport and extraction ability than the Tr-PDI3-C film. The PerSC using Tr-PDI3 as the ETL demonstrated a higher PCE of 17.45% than the device based on the Tr-PDI3-C ETL (16.90%). In addition, a PCE of 19.83% was further achieved by using a double ETL Tr-PDI3/C60 because the LUMO energy level of Tr-PDI3 was more compatible with the PAL.42 These results indicated that finely tuning the geometry of 3D PDI-based materials was closely related to the optical, electronic, morphological and photovoltaic properties.


2.1.3 Increase in the conjugate effect of PDIs. 
Graphene-like planar molecular structures can be formed by increasing the conjugate plane of dimers or multimer nanoribbons.43 It is an effective method to improve electron transport by enhancing the extent of π-extension. The energy levels are modified at the same time. Additionally, the chemical structures of PDIs with the conjugate plane are helical owing to the large steric-hindrance and shown in Fig. 4. There is a balance in suppressing the aggregation while preserving high electron mobility. Photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 3.

Nuckolls et al. synthesized two graphene nanoribbons, hPDI2-Pyr-hPDI2 and hPDI3-Pyr-hPDI3, which were introduced into p–i–n PerSCs as ETLs. HPDI3-Pyr-hPDI3 had a larger conjugate plane than hPDI2-Pyr-hPDI2, resulting in a higher mobility and more matched energy levels. The device based on the hPDI3-Pyr-hPDI3 ETL gave a PCE of up to 16.5%, which was higher than that of hPDI2-Pyr-hPDI2.43 Yang et al. found that an extended π-conjugated PDI small molecule PDI2 could accelerate electron transport and suppress carrier recombination in PerSCs. When it was used as the interfacial modifier between TiO2 and the PAL, PerSCs showed negligible thickness dependence on the PDI2 interlayer, enhanced device efficiency, reduced hysteresis and light-soaking instability. This could be attributed to the high electrical conductivity of PDI2 and its passivation of the PAL defects by electron-rich oxygen atoms.44,45 Wang et al. synthesized a ladder-conjugated PDI dimer containing an IDT unit, IDTT2FPDI. The multiple fused thiophene ring structure endowed IDTT2FPDI with high electron mobility and suitable energy levels, which facilitated efficient electron transport and reduced charge carrier recombination. In addition, the excellent hydrophobicity of the IDTT2FPDI layer could prevent the destruction of the PAL from water. When it was applied as an ETL together with PCBM, the device exhibited a PCE of 19.4% and a good stability.46


2.1.4 Amino and sulfur modified PDIs. 
Amino and sulfur modified PDIs can be used as interfacial layers to reduce the work function of metal electrodes and optimize energy level alignment. At the same time, the nitrogen and sulfur atoms have lone electron pairs, which can enhance the electron transport of the ETL and passivate the electron traps of the PAL. Therefore, amino and sulfur modified PDIs are effective ETMs in PerSCs.27,47 The chemical structures of amino or sulfur modified PDIs are shown in Fig. 5 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 4.

It is found that PDIs with the amino group are selectively well soluble in alcohol solvents, which benefits from the solvent resistance in the fabrication of PerSCs. As is well known, PDIN is a typical PDI with an amino terminus and it has been proved as an effective ETL in OSCs. Compared with C-PDI, the amino group of PDIN could not only reduce the work function of the cathode and promote electronic transport, but also passivate traps on the surface of the PAL, and enhance the surface wettability to the perovskite. Zhang et al. firstly tried to apply PDIN as an ETL in n–i–p PerSCs and achieved a PCE of 17.66%.47 Miao et al. reported the first exploration of PDIN in inverted p–i–n PerSCs. Trifluoroethanol was used to replace the conventional alcohol solvents such as methanol and ethanol. A high quality PDIN thin film was formed and the erosion to the PAL was reduced. A PCE of 15.28% was achieved, which was significantly higher than that of the PCBM only device. Furthermore, the performance of the device with PDIN as the ETL was insensitive to the thickness of PDIN owing to its high conductivity.48,49 Through oxidizing PDIN to PDINO, the conductivity could be increased and the HOMO level could be decreased as shown in Table 4. By incorporating a PDINO buffer layer between PCBM and Ag, more efficient charge extraction was achieved than the PCBM only device. In addition, the stability of the device was improved because the uniform and smooth PDINO film effectively prevented the diffusion of I− or Ag between the PAL and cathode.50,51 Combining amino-modification and the increase of the conjugate plane, Jen et al. synthesized a discotic coronene diimide derivative (CDIN) with an expanded p-conjugated plane and amino groups as the terminal substituents at the imide-positions. This structure could increase the charge mobility of ETLs and affect the grain size of the perovskite. Ultimately, the PCE of PerSCs was increased from 12.0% (the TiO2 based device) to 17.1% with a weak hysteresis of 0.2%.52 Besides introducing aminated substituents at the imide positions, the bay positions of PDI could also be easily modified. Cheng et al. reported two PDI dimers (FA-PDI2 and (FA2+-PDI2)Br2) modified by amino or ammonium groups at bay positions. The charged ammonium moiety in (FA2+-PDI2)Br2 showed a higher electronic conductivity and better hydrophobicity than FA-PDI2. The PerSCs based on the (FA2+-PDI2)Br2 ETL exhibited a promising PCE of 17.1%, in comparison to devices based on the reference ETL FA-PDI2 (13.5%) and PCBM (17.5%).53
Sulfur atom-modified PDIs can also tune the energy levels, improve the conductivity of PDIs and passivate the PAL. Li et al. introduced a varying number of annulated sulfur atoms on the basis of PDI dimers and obtained a series of ETMs, 2PDI-0S, 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S, and 2PDI-4S.54 The number of fused sulfurs tunes the LUMO of the PDIs with varying values (3.7 eV, 3.9 eV and 4.0 eV for 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S, and 2PDI-4S, respectively) and a deep HOMO (5.9 eV). The electron mobility of 2PDI-4S was comparable to that of PCBM suggesting that it could act as an effective ETL for PerSCs. Due to the chemical interaction between sulfur atoms and the PAL, the 2PDI-4S-based devices exhibited significantly higher stability than PCBM ones, and there was no significant attenuation after working at the maximum power for 400 hours.55

2.2 NDIs as ETLs in PerSCs
NDIs are analogs of PDIs that replace the perylene core by the naphthalene core and photoelectric properties are very similar. So they also have received increasing attention as ETLs in PerSCs. Compared with PDIs, NDIs can achieve a larger optical band gap, which is beneficial to the n–i–p device configuration.56 At the same time, NDIs are also easy to aggregate by strong π–π interactions, which will greatly affect the solubility, stability and charge-carrier transport. However, as the smallest part of the ‘rylene family’, the π–π packing of NDIs can be adjusted easier without complicated synthesis. NDI ETMs can be simply synthesized in a few steps, which reduces the cost a lot. N- or side-substitution on mono-NDIs is the usual way to control the intermolecular interaction. Introducing NDI dimers is also an efficient method. Heteroatoms (e.g. O, S, N atoms etc.) on NDIs to passivate interfacial defects are introduced simultaneously.57,58

2.2.1 Effects of N-substituents on NDIs. 
The introduction of N-substituted alkyl chains into NDI derivatives can enhance solubility, but it leads to various mesophase transitions due to high conformational freedom and flexibility of alkyl groups, reducing the stability of PerSCs.57,59–61 On the other hand, the introduction of N-substituted aromatic groups can enhance the long-term temporal stability, but it will reduce the solubility of NDIs in organic solvents, resulting in a decreased processability.62,63 Therefore, selecting suitable substituents on the nitrogen atom in NDIs is very important. The chemical structures of N-substituted NDIs are shown in Fig. 6 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are shown in Table 5.

The Im group introduced N-substituted phenylmethyl into the NDI core (NDI-PM) and first applied it as an ETL in p–i–n PerSCs. NDI-PM exhibited electron mobility, charge extraction and solubility comparable to PCBM. As a result, NDI-PM-based PerSCs showed comparable performance to the PCBM-based devices. What's more, the thermal stability of NDI-based PerSCs was improved due to the much stronger hydrogen bonding in NDI-PM than PCBM.58 After that, Kwon et al. studied a series of similar N-substituted groups, such as 1-indanyl (NDI-ID(RR)), (R)-1-phenylethyl (NDI-PhE), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl (NDI-TN(RR)) and their corresponding heterochiral side groups (NDI-ID(RS) and NDI-TN(RS)). With indane containing both alicyclic and aromatic characteristics, NDI-ID achieved both low-temperature solution processability and high temporal stability. NDI-ID-based devices showed simultaneously higher PCE up to 20.2% and longer temporal stability than PCBM-based ones.64 NDI-PhE with higher solubility and better film-forming ability was obtained by adding a methyl group into NDI-PM. This is because the two asymmetric-shaped chiral (R)-1-phenylethyl (PhE) groups reduce molecular symmetry and increase free volume. As a consequence, the best PCE of NDI-PhE based p–i–n PerSCs reached 20.5% which was higher than that of PCBM.65 Then, they systematically studied the effect of substituents with chiral stereoisomerism on the physical and electronic properties of NDIs. It was found that the enantiomeric NDIs with a homochiral pendant group exhibited non-centrosymmetric molecular packing and had higher solubility and thermal stability than the homochiral NDIs. This was advantageous to the formation of a highly uniform ETL, and finally the NDI-ID (RR) and NDI-TN(RR) based PerSCs showed PCEs of 20.4% and 17.9% respectively, which were higher than those of the NDI-ID (RS) and NDI-TN(RS) based devices (20% and 16.5%). In addition, NDI-ID (RR)-based PerSCs demonstrated a degradation rate of less than 10% at 100 °C in air for 1000 h.66 It could be seen that the design of asymmetrical structures was a potential approach to achieve high solution processability and significant temporal stability in NDIs. Furthermore, in 2018, Shao et al. designed and synthesized a series of asymmetrical small molecules AI1, AI2, and AI3 based on acenaphthylene-imide (AI). All of them showed high electron mobility (>10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and solution processability. When used as an intermediate layer between TiO2 and the PAL, the short-circuit current and the fill factor of the device were significantly improved compared to that of TiO2 based devices and they were similar to those of TiO2/PCBM based devices. This could be attributed to their good electron transport properties.67
In addition, preparation of NDI films by a new solvent method was explored. Peng et al. developed a new alcohol-soluble NDI with N-substituted pyridinium salt (PN6), which could reduce the work function of Ag. When it was used as an intermediate layer between PCBM and metal electrodes, a PCE of 17.27% was obtained and the performance of PerSCs was insensitive to the thickness of PN6.68 The potential of naphthalene-1,8:4,5-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI-H, the simplest NDIs) as an ETL in PerSCs was examined by a thermal conversion method. By introducing thermally cleavable solubilizing groups tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) as the N-substituents, a soluble NDI-H precursor was synthesized. NDI-H could be obtained by heating the spin-coated film of the NDI-Boc precursor compound, and a NDI-H film oriented face to face with the substrate was successfully prepared.69


2.2.2 Effects of side substituents on NDIs. 
Then aggregation can also be suppressed by the introduction of side substituents into the NDI core, resulting in smooth and uniform morphology, low leakage current and high electron mobility. The side chains containing the thiophene group are the most common modified units, which can passivate uncoordinated Pb traps on the surface of the PAL as well as adjusting the molecular stack of NDIs.69–72 The chemical structures of NDIs with different side chains are shown in Fig. 7 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 6.

In view of the passivation effect of sulfur atoms on the PAL, Zhang et al. designed and synthesized two new dithiafulvenyl-NDIs (DS1 and DS2). Compared with DS1, DS2 possessed two thiophene groups and more sulfur atoms, which could more efficiently passivate uncoordinated Pb traps on the surface of the PAL. As a result, DS2-based PerSCs showed better PCE (11.4%), which was close to that of PCBM-based devices (13.5%).70 Following this strategy, they developed two benzothiazole-NDIs (NDI-BTH1 and NDI-BTH2). NDI-BTH2 with four benzothiazole subunits exhibited higher electron mobility and stronger passivation properties, leading to a higher PCE of 15.4% for NDI-BTH2 based PerSCs. Their work demonstrated that the use of benzothiazole modified NDI was a promising approach to improve the performance of PerSCs.71 Recently, they attached dithiafulvenyl and 2-(2-methyl-4H-chromen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CMCN) groups into the skeleton of NDIs elaborately to solve the aggregation problem. By carefully adjusting the position and the amount of side chains on the skeleton of NDIs (NDIF1, NDIF2, and NDIF3), the extent of molecular interaction and aggregation could be successfully modified, which would eventually affect the aggregation of molecules and surface qualities of ETLs. NDIF1 exhibited proper aggregation of molecules, resulting in a smooth contact with the cathode and low series resistance. A PCE of 15.6% was achieved. However, too strong or weak intermolecular interaction would either get strong aggregation (NDIF2) or film with a pinhole (NDIF3), causing insufficient contact with the metal cathode and reducing device performance.72 This demonstrated that more attention should be paid to the relationship among sided chains, molecular interaction and morphology when designing efficient NDI ETMs for PerSCs.


2.2.3 NDI dimer. 
Similar to PDIs, the aggregation caused by planar aromatic rings in NDIs would negatively affect the solution processability and film quality.69 Besides N-substituents and side substituents, adding twisted NDI dimers may be figured out as another simple way to address this problem.73,74 At the same time, the strategy of the passivation of Pb atoms in the PAL by sulfur and nitrogen atoms can also be adopted. The chemical structures of reported NDI dimers are shown in Fig. 8 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 7.

NDI dimers have a distorted spatial structure, which can enhance the isotropy of charge transport, and at the same time, inhibit the aggregation of molecules to promote the formation of a more uniform ETL. Ge et al. designed planar NDI3HU-DTYM2 and twisted NDI dimers (DTYM-NDI-DTYA)2. The twisted molecular skeleton weakened the aggregation effect of molecules and enhanced the isotropic charge transport. It demonstrated good film morphology and higher electron mobility as an ETM. In addition, the LUMO energy level of (DTYM-NDI-DTYA)2 matched well with the valence band of the PAL. A PCE of 12.9% was obtained for PerSCs based on (DTYM-NDI-DTYA)2, which was higher than the PCE of PerSCs based on NDI3HU-DTYM2.73 Said et al. synthesised two novel NDI dimers (PDPT and PMDPT) bridged by piperazine-1,4-diyl. It was found that the inverted p–i–n PerSCs with PMDPT as an ETL showed higher device performance compared with PDPT. The improvement in the efficiency was ascribed to the increased number of nitrogen atoms in PMDPT, which passivated the electron traps on the surface of the PAL. The passivation resulted in less charge recombination, therefore delivering a higher Voc and PCE.74 These studies suggested that the heteroatoms played an important role in twisted dimers when used as ETMs in PerSCs.

3. Azaacene-based small molecules
Azaacene derivatives have attracted much attention for their application in the field of organic electronics, such as n-type FETs, OSCs and PerSCs, due to their excellent charge transport properties.75 The electron-deficient nature of the pyrazine on azaacene provides good n-type electron transport. However, the relatively high LUMO and poor solution processability of azaacenes hinder their use in PerSCs.20 Current research on azaacenes focused on the introduction of different substituents containing the sulfur element to improve the above problems. The chemical structures of the azaacene-based small molecules mentioned in this review are shown in Fig. 9 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 8.

In 2016, Jen's team reported one of the first azaacene-based ETMs for high-performance p–i–n PerSCs. They designed a series of azaacene-based ETMs functionalized with alkylsulfanyl chains of different lengths or of different sulfur oxidation states (sulfide – HATNAS3C4, HATNAS3C7, HATNAS3C7-C3h, HATNAS3C7-Cs; sulfoxide – HATNASOC7-Cs; and sulfone – HATNASO2C7-Cs). They found that this modified strategy could improve the solution processability of the compounds as well as passivate the surface traps of the PAL. However, the electron-donating alkylsulfanyl chains would also raise the LUMO level significantly and lead to unmatched energy levels with the PAL compared with HATNA-F6. So, they replaced the sulfide (S) with sulfoxide (SO) or sulfone (SO2), and the LUMO level decreased. The final PCE increased from 4.69% of HATNA-F6 to 17.62% of HATNASOC7-Cs. Furthermore, the fluorine group made the materials hydrophobic and the PerSC based on the HATNASOC7-Cs ETL maintained 80% of the initial PCE in air for 30 days.20 Gu et al. reported a novel azaacene QCAPZ employed as an ETM for inverted p–i–n PerSCs. The electron mobility of QCAPZ was 4.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was comparable to that of the PCBM. However, the PCE of the inverted device was only 10.26%, especially the Jsc and the Voc were obviously lower than those based on PCBM ETL devices. This was mainly attributed to the mismatch of energy levels between the PAL and QCAPZ.76 Subsequently, Gu et al. studied two azaacenes (TDTP with sulfur atoms and PYPH without sulfur atoms) as ETLs in PerSCs. It was further proved that the interaction between the sulfur atom and the PAL surface can improve the performance of the device. The device based on TDTP showed 18.2% PCE which was much larger than that based on PYPH (9.5%). This superior performance was attributed to the stronger interaction between TDTP and the PAL surface than that between PYPH and the PAL surface, which was supported by theoretical calculations.77 The above results indicated that the introduction of groups containing the sulfur element could affect both the LUMO level of azaacene and the passivation of azaacene to the PAL. Considering energy levels together with the passivation of sulfur species, Wang et al. designed a new sulfur-containing n-type azaacene hexaazatrinaphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (HATNT), which possessed both suitable energy levels and high electron mobility. By employing HATNT as an ETL in inverted p–i–n PerSCs, a high PCE of 18.1% was obtained, which was even higher than that of the traditional PCBM-based device (16.2%). More importantly, HATNT showed more effective passivation by sulfur atoms to the PAL and suppression of photogenerated charge recombination at the PAL/ETL interface.78
4. IDT-based small molecules
IDT derivatives (IDTs) were first designed and applied as organic acceptor materials in OSCs by Zhan's group and gained great success.79 The electron-donating fused ring core of IDTs usually provides good charge transport ability, while the side chains and electron-withdrawing end groups give solubility in common organic solvents and result in electron-deficient nature. By modifying and changing these groups, a wide variety of ETMs can be conveniently obtained, and their photoelectric properties (such as the electron mobility, energy levels, the solubility, the extension of photoresponse to the NIR absorption and the passivation of the PAL) can be easily adjusted.25 Recently, these modified IDTs have been used as ETMs and show excellent performance in PerSCs.80
4.1 Terminal group or side chain modification of IDTs
By modifying the terminal groups of IDTs with F atoms or Me groups, the LUMO level, the charge transport and the hydrophobic ability of the IDTs can be adjusted.81–83 At the same time, S, N, O atoms of terminal groups can efficiently passivate the PAL and the introduction of halogen atoms can change the hydrophobicity of these materials, thereby improving the performance and stability of PerSCs.84,85 The chemical structures of IDTs with different terminal groups are shown in Fig. 10 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 9.

In 2016, for the first time, IDIC with 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone as terminal groups was introduced into inverted p–i–n PerSCs as an ETL. The CO and CN of IDIC could effectively passivate the Lewis acid traps (e.g., uncoordinated Pb ions and Pb clusters) of MAPbI3, together with an electron mobility as high as 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the matched energy level, resulting in a PCE of 19.5% which exceeded the PCE of the control device without IDIC by 45%.84 Following this strategy, Ma et al. dissolved IDIC in an anti-solvent to obtain a gradient IDIC intermediate layer, which enabled IDIC to simultaneously passivate the grain boundaries and surface of the PAL, and promote charge extraction. A PCE of 19.86% was achieved.85 When used as an ETL in n–i–p PerSCs to replace TiO2, IDIC could also improve perovskite crystallinity and film quality due to its hydrophobicity and incompatible wetting surface. The IDIC-based devices exhibited a champion PCE of 19.1%, which was higher than that of TiO2-based devices (17.4%).86
The introduction of halogen atoms into terminal groups provides another strategy to improve the performance and stability for PerSCs. The Zhan group designed three IDTs with different numbers of fluorine atoms (INIC, INIC-1F and INIC-2F) as the ETMs for inverted p–i–n PerSCs, and PCBM was used as the second ETL. It was found that increasing the number of fluorine atoms could obviously enhance the electron mobility and the device performance. At the same time, the good hydrophobic ability of the fluorinated IDTs significantly improved the ambient stability of PerSCs. Finally, due to the fast interfacial charge extraction and efficient trap passivation, the PerSC based on the INIC-2F interface layer achieved a PCE of 19.3% with good stability.81 To illustrate the effect of the end-group's electronegativity on the energy levels of IDTs, three IDTs with end-groups of different electron accepting ability (ITIC, IT-4F, and IT-4M) were studied as ETMs in inverted p–i–n PerSCs. The terminal groups of ITIC were modified with F atoms and methyl groups to form IT-4F and IT-4M. As the electron-withdrawing ability of the end group increased, the LUMO of IT-4M, ITIC and IT-4F decreased from −3.96 eV, −4.04 eV to −4.19 eV, respectively. IT-4M with the electron-donating methyl groups showed a more consistent energy level with the conduction band of the PAL, leading to higher Voc and Jsc of the PerSCs. The PCE of PerSCs based on the IT-4M ETL was the highest and reached 17.65%. When adding the second ETL of C60, the PCE of the device with IT-4M/C60 ETLs was 18.92%.82 Fan et al. studied the effects of two IDTs with different end groups (ITIC and IT-M attached by two methyl groups) as ETLs on the PCE and hysteresis of inverted p–i–n PerSCs. Thanks to the excellent extraction and transport of photo-generated carriers, and the passivation effect of sulfur atoms on the PAL. Devices based on IDTs showed superior performance to that based on PCBM and the hysteresis effect was dramatically suppressed.83
Side chain modifications of IDTs include replacing benzene rings with alkyl chains, thiophenes and selenophenes. The modification of the side chain mainly improves the electron mobility and hydrophobicity and morphology of IDTs.87 The chemical structures of IDTs with different side chains are shown in Fig. 11 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 9.
 Fig. 11  The chemical structures of IDTs with different side chains. 
To study the side chain effect on the electron transport properties of IDTs and the performance of inverted p–i–n PerSCs, Wu et al. synthesised two π-conjugated small molecules (ITCPTC-Th and ITCPTC-Se) based on the fused rigid ladder-type backbone. ITCPTC-Th with n-hexylthiophene showed a smoother film morphology, higher electron mobility, and more efficient electron extraction than ITCPTC-Se with selenophene. The PCE of the ITCPTC-Th based device was 17.11%, which was higher than that of the ITCPTC-Se based device (16.12%). When ITCPTC-Th was used as an intermediate layer between the PAL and C60, a PCE of 18.75% could be further achieved for PerSCs based on ITCPTC-Th.87 It has been reported that the ITIC-Th had a higher electron mobility than ITIC by replacing benzene rings with thiophenes in side chains owing to the intermolecular sulfur–sulfur interaction.88 Liu et al. firstly fabricated quasi 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 based inverted p–i–n PerSCs using ITIC-Th as the ETL. It was found that the ITIC-Th based 2D PerSCs exhibited an average PCE of 8.4%, which was comparable to that of PerSCs using PCBM. In addition, the long-term stability of the 2D PerSCs was also improved owing to the strong hydrophobic properties of ITIC-Th.89
4.2 Fused ring core modification of IDTs
Research on the IDT core mainly focused on the development of asymmetric molecules and changing the conjugation length of fused rings. Increasing the conjugation length of the fused ring can increase the electron mobility and extend the photoresponse to the NIR absorption.90 By forming asymmetric molecules, the molecular dipole moment can be changed and the morphology of the film can be improved.91 The chemical structures of IDTs with different main chains are shown in Fig. 12 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 10.

In 2018, Yang's group designed three IDTs with different conjugation lengths of the central multi-fused ring. Consequently, IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC with five, six and seven fused-rings were obtained. They were applied as ETLs in inverted p–i–n PerSCs. It was found that increasing the conjugate length was an efficient way to enhance the electron transport ability. The ITCPTC molecule showed the highest PCE of 17.42% due to its high electron mobility and the dominant “face-on” molecular orientation in neat films. When used as an interface modifier between PAL/C60, ITCPTC could further deliver a higher PCE of 19.51%. This could be mainly attributed to their matched energy levels and the reduced defect density of the interface.91 A similar enhancement in PCE was also observed in many other studies when IDTs were used as interface modifiers to form a double-layer ETL, such as TiO2/PAL or SnO2/PAL.92–94 In addition, IDTs can be used as additives for fullerene, which promoted energy level matching and inhibited molecular aggregation.95–97 Recently, they have designed an ETM ITCP-M with more fused rings, which could extend the light absorption of the inverted PerSCs to the NIR region. Coupled with the suitable energy levels, smooth film morphology, decent electron mobility, and electron extraction ability ITCP-M was made a promising ETM for inverted PerSCs. An excellent PCE of 19.15% was reported.90
It has been proved that the design of asymmetrical molecules was an effective way to adjust the dipole–dipole interaction of IDT-based molecules and the intermolecular π–π stacking. Yang et al. developed two novel asymmetric molecules, the methyl-substituted IDT6CN-TM and the fluorinated IDT6CN-4F. The larger dipole moment enabled a stronger π–π stacking of IDT6CN-TM compared to IDT6CN-4F, and thus a higher electron mobility was observed in IDT6CN-TM neat films. The high electron mobility, efficient charge collection and decent interfacial properties (good surface coverage on the perovskite film) allowed IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F to work as efficient ETMs: IDT6CN-TM- and IDT6CN-4F-based inverted PerSCs achieve PCEs of 18.36% (FF of 80%) and 17.75%, which were significantly higher than that of the PCBM-based one.98 It should be noted that the stronger π–π stacking might lead to more severe aggregation, poorer solubility and morphology in the case of rylene diimides. However, the good π–π stacking resulted in high electron mobility here in the case of IDTs. This was because IDTs were usually well soluble in organic solvents and there was a balance between the good morphology and the π–π stacking.
5. Other small molecules as ETLs
In addition to the aforementioned ETMs, some of other small molecule ETMs have been successfully used in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and OSCs and have achieved good performance.99–102 The development of these novel ETMs is particularly desirable and meaningful to achieve efficient and low cost PerSCs. The chemical structures of these molecules are shown in Fig. 13 and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 11.

Hexadecafluorophthalocyaninatocopper (F16CuPc) has been used as an n-channel semiconductor material in OTFTs and exhibited good air stability.99 When used as an ETL in PerSCs, F16CuPc improved the air stability of the device and achieved a PCE of 12.62% which was higher than that of the fullerene-based PerSCs.103 The benzobis(thiadiazole) unit with a hypervalent sulfur atom is a strong electron acceptor, and its high mobility has been verified by its use in OTFTs.100 Zhu et al. designed and synthesized a novel small molecule B2F based on benzobis(thiadiazole), which had a LUMO of 4.02 eV and matched well with the conduction band of the PAL. Furthermore, S atoms could passivate the PAL defects. PerSCs with B2F as the ETL and the interface modifier of C60 showed PCEs of 12.35% and 17.18% respectively.104 The pyrene unit has a wide range of applications in OLEDs, OTFTs and OSCs.101 Chen et al. designed two new small molecules based on pyrene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene(TT), PTTI-1 and PTTI-2, and the positions of sulfur atoms in TT were different. The sulfur positions in PTTI-1 and PTTI-2 played an important role in influencing the energy level, the mobility and the passivation ability of ETMs. PTTI-1 showed a better PCE of 15.37%, higher than that of PTTI-2 (11.07%).105 Chen et al. designed a D–A structured TPA-3CN ETM containing a TPA core and 3CN capping groups. The strong electron-withdrawing ability of 3CN resulted in deeper HOMO and LUMO levels, which well matched with that of the PAL. By doping an n-type dopant H2, the electron mobility and conductivity were also improved. The PerSCs based on doped TPA-3CN exhibited a PCE of 19.2% with a negligible hysteresis, which was comparable with that of PCBM based PerSCs (19.1%).106 3-[6-(Diphenylphosphinyl)-2-naphthalenyl]-1,10-phenanthroline (Phen-NaDPO) was successfully applied in OSCs as a cathode interfacial layer owing to the combination of high electron mobility and good solubility in common solvents.102 Seitkhan et al. developed an organic–inorganic hybrid electron extracting layer based on the PhenNaDPO:Sn(SCN)2 mixture. A minute amount of Sn(SCN)2 interacted with Phen-NaDPO at O and N sites, resulting in a sharp decrease of the LUMO value of PHEN-NaDPO by 1.25 eV and improving both the electron extraction and its film-forming properties. The Phen-NaDPO:Sn(SCN)2 blend ETL increased the PCE of PerSC to 18.2% compared to that of the pristine Phen-NaDPO ETL (16.6%).107
6. Polymer electron transport materials
A great number of organic polymers as ETMs or acceptors in OSCs have been reported and excellent results have been achieved.108–110 Given the abundant acceptor polymer materials, their easily tunable properties, good morphological stability, strong solvent resistance (DMF, DMSO and GBL etc.) and film-forming properties, it is worth making ETMs and exploring their use for PerSCs.111,112 Herein we will introduce the application of typical polymers used as ETLs in PerSCs respectively, such as NDI polymers, PDI polymers and polyfluorene derivatives.
6.1 NDI polymer
NDI polymers exhibit high electron mobility, good solution processability, high stability, and feasible adjustment of chemical structure which are beneficial for being used as ETMs.113 Until now, NDI based polymer ETMs reported are mainly modified by the units of thiophene or fluorene. The conjugation degree of copolymerized units can effectively improve the conjugation and order of NDI polymers, which are beneficial for improving the electron mobility. As electron donating groups, modifying thiophene and fluorene with substituents or adjusting the amount of thiophene and fluorene are effective strategies to adjust the energy levels of NDI based polymers as well.114,115
NDI polymers with thiophene as a copolymerization unit are shown in Fig. 14, and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 12. The thiophene units are usually used to adjust the conjugation degree and then control the electron mobility of NDI polymers. In 2015, Ma's team introduced PNDI2OD-TT, PNDI2OD-T2, and PNVT-8 into PerSCs as ETLs for PerSCs, whose copolymerization groups were thienothiophene (TT), 2,2′-bithiophene (T2) and (E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene (TVT), respectively.116 Studies on OFET indicated that the electron mobility gradually increased in the order of PNDI2OD-TT, PNDI2OD-T2, and PNVT-8.117,118 Due to the lowest electron mobility, PerSCs based on PNDI2OD-TT showed high series resistance which accounted for the low FF and PCE. With higher electron mobility, the performance of the device based on PNDI2OD-T2 was comparable to that of a PCBM-based device. Although PNVT-8 showed the highest electron mobility, PNVT-8 based PerSCs showed lower FF and PCE due to its higher HOMO which weakens the blocking effect on holes.116 When PNDI2OD-T2 and PCBM formed a hybrid ETL, the film morphology was improved, and the average PCE increased from 5.78% to 9.82%.119 Compared with 2,2′-bithiophene in PNDI2OD-T2 and PNDI2DT-T2, PNDI2OD-TET was composed of one more ethyl group which reduced the conjugation and the electron mobility (1.0 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1), resulting in severe bimolecular recombination in the PerSCs and very low PCE. With higher mobility, devices based on PNDI2OD-T2 (2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PNDI2DT-T2 (1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) achieved PCE around 10.8%.120 This revealed that the conjugation degree of copolymerized units had great influence on the electron mobility of NDI polymers. In PNDI2DT-TTCN, intramolecular interactions between the S–N groups provided dicyanothiophene with a pseudo-planar structure, in the meantime, intermolecular π–π aggregation was also enhanced, leading to the increase of the electron mobility (7.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Together with a deep LUMO (−4.14 eV) for PNDI2DT-TTCN caused by the electron-withdrawing dicyano group, the PCE of the device based on PNDI2DT-TTCN was significantly improved from 14.3% (PCBM-based device) to 17.0%. Because these polymers have good hydrophobicity, they can act as water-permeable encapsulation layers to obtain PerSCs with higher air stability. In addition, PNDI2DT-TTCN exhibited excellent mechanical stability and could be used in flexible equipment.121

The modification to thiophene can also be used to adjust the energy levels of ETMs. In 2018, Zhang's team reported a series of NDI polymers based on thiophene–piazthiole–thiophene, pBTT, pBTTz, and pSNT. It was found that the LUMO level decreased from −3.78 eV to −3.86 eV by introducing sp2-nitrogen to the thiophene of pBTT to form pBTTz with a slightly declined electron mobility. The PCE of PerSCs based on pBTTz was improved from 12.8% (pBTT) to 14.4% owing to the better matching LUMO energy level. Adding sp2-nitrogen to the piazthiole of pBTT to get pSNT resulted in a lowest LUMO level of −3.88 eV and a higher electron mobility, but its PCE decreased to 12%. That was because that the HOMO level of pSNT (−5.45 eV) was close to the valence band of the PAL (−5.4 eV) and resulted in poor hole blocking.122
Besides the thiophene unit, its analogue of selenophene has also been investigated. The number of selenophene increased in the order of NDI-Se, NDI-BiSe and NDI-TriSe. Similar to thiophene, NDI-BiSe and NDI-TriSe showed increased conjugate planarity, which improved electron delocalization and crystallinity. Electron mobility increased in the order of 4.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (NDI-Se), 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (NDI-BiSe) and 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (NDI-TriSe). The PCEs of NDI-Se, NDI-BiSe and NDI-TriSe-based PerSCs were 9.51%, 7.66% and 14.0%, respectively. The NDI-TriSe-based PerSC gave a PCE close to that of C60-based PerSC.123
According to the above discussion, we can conclude that increasing the conjugation degree of copolymerized units is an effective strategy to improve the electron mobility of NDI polymers, but the HOMO level also increases which weakens the blocking effect on holes. Modification of copolymerized units is essential to find a balance between high electron mobility and acceptable HOMOs.
The chemical structures of the NDI polymers with fluorene as the copolymerization unit are shown in Fig. 15, and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 12. It was found that the introduction of N atoms onto fluorene was an effective strategy to passivate the defects of the PAL and reduce the work function of metal cathodes, resulting in improved electronic collection and device performance.
 Fig. 15  The chemical structures of the NDI polymers with fluorene as the copolymerization unit. 
Compared with the amino-free group of PF-2TNDI, the new amino-functional copolymer of PFN-2TNDI could replace PCBM in inverted PerSCs. The amino group on the polymer could reduce the work function of the metal cathode and passivate the surface traps of the PAL.124 Cao's team developed various fluorene copolymerized NDI polymers (P1–P4) with different steric hindrance of the amino groups. With the increase of the steric hindrance of the amino groups in P1–P4, the electron donation ability decreased and the work function of the silver electrode gradually decreased from −4.66 eV to −4.00 eV, −4.13 eV, −4.24 eV and −4.36 eV. At the same time, the passivation effect of the amino groups on the PAL decreased, which led to the decrease of the device performance.125 Recently, they claimed that NDI polymers with the fluorinated side chains could substantially improve the water resistance of the PAL, with a significant improvement in the stability of PerSCs. A series of fluorine and amino bifunctionalized NDI polymers were designed, PN, PN-F25% and PN-F50%. The fluorinated side chains on the fluorene units enhanced the hydrophobicity of the device. As the content of fluorine atoms increased, the PerSCs showed improved device stability. Combined with the effect of N atoms on the work function of the cathode, a PCE of 17.5% can be obtained by carefully regulating the ratio of amino and fluorinated side chains (optimum ratio: PN-F25%), exceeding those of PCBM-based devices (PCE was 14%).126
Furthermore, additives can effectively improve the performance of ETMs. Compared with pure PNDI2OD-T2, the doped ETL exhibited a higher electron mobility, better matched LUMO and similar stability. Therefore, the electronic performance of PFN-OX doped PNDI2OD-T2 increased the PCE of the device from 15.02% to 16.84%.127 The doping of N-DPBI minimized resistive losses, enhanced conductivity from 1.2 × 10−8 S cm−1 to 4.2 × 10−3 S cm−1, and improved the surface coverage of PNDI2OD-T2 on the MAPbI3 layer. The PCE of the PerSC based on the N-DPBI-doped PNDI2OD-T2 ETL reached 19%.128
6.2 PDI polymers
Similar to NDI polymers, the study of PDI polymers mainly focuses on the modification of copolymerized units to adjust the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the electron mobility of PDI polymers. As a common research strategy, nitrogen and sulfur are introduced into the copolymerization units to passivate the surface defects of the PAL. The chemical structures of the PDI polymers are shown in Fig. 16, and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 13.

As shown in Fig. 16, PDI polymers with different electron-donating ability of their conjugated units, including vinylene (V), thiophene (T), selenophene (Se), dibenzosilole (DBS), and cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT), were used as ETMs to study the effect of copolymerization units on the LUMO level and mobility. Among these five polymers, PV-PDI, PT-PDI, Se-PDI, PDBS-PDI and PCPTD-PDI, PV-PDI with the best planar structure of the ethylene group and the best matched LUMO level demonstrated the best electron transport ability. At the same time, more planar polymer chains could promote the formation of a uniform film, enhance the electron mobility (2.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and promote charge transfer, resulting in the best performance (PCE is 10.14%).129 Similar to PV-PDI, NDP-V also followed the strategy of increasing conjugate planes and was used in p–i–n PerSCs as an ETL. The NDP-V's planar structure and π conjugate system enhanced the aggregation of molecules, which improved electron transport. Compared with PCBM, NDP-V exhibited higher electron mobility, greater hydrophobicity, and similar energy levels. Therefore, NDP-V based devices showed a higher PCE of 16.54% than PCBM based devices (15.27%).130
Similar to the strategy used in small molecular ETMs, the introduction of N and S atoms or phosphite groups into PDI polymers is an effective method to improve the performance of PerSCs, which can passivate the PAL and adjust energy levels. Zhan's team used N and S atoms in the PDI polymer to passivate the PAL, which improved the performance of devices. They used PPDIF3N with amino groups to improve the energy level matching between the TiO2 and the PAL. At the same time, the amino groups on the side of PPDIF3N could passivate the defects of the PAL and improve the wettability of the precursor solution on the ETL. The PCE of PerSCs increased from 16.7% (TiO2) to 18.3% (TiO2/PPDIF3N).131 Subsequently, they introduced PPDIDTT as the interface modifier between the PAL/fullerene interface. The electron-rich dithiothiophene in PPDIDTT could significantly passivate the surface of the PAL and also showed effective charge extraction and transfer nature. The passivation of PPDIDTT increased the PCE of PerSCs from 15.3% to 16.5%.132 Yang's team designed PPDIN6 with amino groups to modify the PCBM/Ag interface in inverted PerSCs. The passivation of PPDIN6 reduced the density of interface traps and enhanced the extraction of electrons. At the same time, PPDIN6 could neutralize the migrated iodine ions and protect the Ag electrode, so a PCE of 20.43% was obtained with good long-term stability.133 Recently, Fang's team developed a PDI-based conjugated polymer PFPDI, it contained both thiophene and fluorene groups with phosphite units as pendant groups. Due to the coordination of Pb2+ with the phosphite groups, a nanostructured ETL was spontaneously formed when PFPDI was spin-coated on the PAL. The nano-structured PFPDI layer could passivate the PAL as well as improving the light collection efficiency of the PerSCs. PFPDI-based devices achieved a PCE of 15.01%, which was close to that of PCBM based devices.134
6.3 Other conjugated polymers
In addition to the above polymers based on diimide, some other polymers are also reported as ETMs or interface modifier materials in PerSCs (as shown in Fig. 17), and photovoltaic parameters of PerSCs are summarized in Table 14.

Polyfluorene can be modified to serve as an ETL in PerSCs. F8BT is one kind that can be synthesized by the copolymerization of benzothiazole and fluorene. It exhibited high electron mobility and was used as an ETL for PerSCs in 2014, and a PCE of 7.05% was achieved.135 The LUMO level of F8BT was determined to be −3.75 eV, which is the same as the conduction band (−3.75 eV) of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. This facilitated electron transfer. When combined with C60 as a double ETL, the energy level alignment between the PAL and the ETL was improved. At the same time, the F8BT's deep HOMO level (−5.91 eV) can effectively prevent holes from transporting into the ETL. PCE was increased from 7.9% to 13.9%. When F8BT was combined with PCBM, a higher PCE of 15.9% was obtained.136 The amino-modified PFN and PFN-OX were also widely used as ETLs in PerSCs. PFN had good film-forming performance. When PFN was used to modify TiO2 in PerSCs, the PerSCs showed a PCE up to 14.31% because of the reduced recombination as well as the optimized PAL.137 However, PFN exhibited a certain solubility in DMF and DMSO which were the solvents of perovskite materials. This is disadvantageous when used in n–i–p PerSCs. Thus, a cross-linkable conjugated polymer with oxetanyl (PFN-OX, Fig. 17), which shows better solvent resistance, was preferred to form an ETL in n–i–p PerSCs. The PCE increased from 10.2% (PFN) to 11.1% (PFN-OX). If hybrid composite films consisting of PFN-OX and ZnO nanoparticles were utilized as ETLs, a remarkable power conversion efficiency over 16% was achieved. The hybrid composite of PFN-OX:ZnO could not only achieve the appropriate energy level alignment between the perovskite material and ITO electrode, but also formed optimized ohmic contact. Moreover, the charge separation and collection processes were improved for the devices based on PFN-OX:ZnO.138 PFN-OX can also be used as an n-dopant for PCBM. When PFN-OX-doped PCBM was used as an ETM, the PCE of PerSCs increased significantly from 11% to 16.2%.139
He's team recently designed two novel n-type polymers based on bithienimide and thienothiazole imide, PBTI and PDTzTI. Replacing thiophenes with thiazoles could greatly reduce HOMO and LUMO levels. Owing to the mismatched energy levels between PBTI and the PAL, its device performance was far worse than PDTzTI. PDTzTI had high electron mobility, good energy level matching, and passivation of interface traps, and its optimal PCE was 20.86%, which was even better than that of PCBM. What's more, PDTzTI had hydrophobicity and ion blocking ability, as well as good film formation ability. As a result, PDTzTI-based devices demonstrated excellent long-term and operational stability.140
In addition, Jen's team designed and synthesized an n-type conjugated cross-linked polymer, cross-linked hexaazatrinaphthylene (c-HATNA), to serve as an efficient and robust ETL for inverted p–i–n PerSCs. By employing the thiol–ene reaction, c-HATNA could be efficiently obtained at a relatively low temperature of 110 °C. The obtained c-HATNA film possessed excellent hydrophobicity and thermal stability, enabling the realization of stable PerSCs without encapsulation. By doping with Et3N, a high PCE of 18.21% was obtained. More importantly, the device with the c-HATNA ETL showed impressive thermal stability and a slight loss (<10%) of PCE after being heated at 70 °C for 1000 h.141
7. Conclusion
We have summarized common non-fullerene organic ETMs, including NDIs, PDIs, azaacene-based molecules, IDTs and n-type conjugated polymers. Rylene diimides including NDIs and PDIs have a conjugated planar structure and reaction sites that are easy to functionalize. At the same time, they have the advantages of good thermal stability and low cost.25 But they all face the problem of strong aggregation, leading to poor film morphology and electronic transmission.34,69 Therefore, it is an effective strategy to introduce substituents or change the three-dimensional structure of molecules to regulate the interaction among molecules.37,73,74 Azaacene derivatives have higher electron mobility, but higher LUMO and poor solution processability hinder their use in PerSCs. Therefore, groups such as sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone are introduced to promote energy level matching and improve solubility.75,76 IDT derivatives also have advantages such as modifiable structure, higher mobility, good solution processability, and ability to passivate the PAL, so they show better performance in PerSCs, but IDTs also faced the problem of high cost as well as fullerenes owing to their complicated synthetic routes and purification.25 The research on IDTs focuses on the modification of their terminal groups, side chains and fused ring core. Compared with small molecule ETMs, polymer ETMs can provide better film-forming properties, a wider range of rheological properties, and better mechanical flexibility of films and devices. However, the electron mobility and energy levels of polymer ETMs usually need to be adjusted to match with the PAL. In addition to the modification of the backbone in the polymer, cross-linking and doping strategies are also good to improve the electrical properties.141 According to the effects of substituents and design strategies of molecular configuration on the properties of non-fullerene ETMs, Fig. 18 summarizes the following strategies: (1) introducing halogen atoms to improve stability and hydrophobicity (e.g. F atoms in rylene diimide small molecules and polymers), and to increase electron mobility and improve film formation (e.g. Br atom in PDIs). (2) Introduction of Lewis base functional groups, such as amino groups, thiophene and pyridine to improve energy level matching and passivate the PAL. (3) Increasing steric hindrance to inhibit the self-aggregation of molecules to obtain smooth, uniform, pinhole-free ETLs and increase electron mobility (such as PDIs and NDIs). (4) Enhancing the conjugate effect to increase electron mobility (e.g. PDIs, IDTs and polymers) as well as to adjust the film morphology, and there is a balance in adjusting the aggregation while preserving high electron mobility. (5) Forming cross-linked ETLs to improve air stability, thermal stability and hydrophobicity.
 Fig. 18  The summary of methods to improve the performance of ETMs. 
Although some non-fullerene ETMs have achieved closed or even better performance in PerSCs than that of PCBM based ones, most PCEs of PerSCs based on non-fullerene ETLs are still lower. High device efficiency was commonly obtained based on non-fullerene/fullerene bilayer ETLs or mixing with other ETMs. In this case, those non-fullerene organic ETMs can be developed as ideal interfacial modifiers or defect passivators. To serve as independent ETLs in PerSCs, much research on non-fullerene ETMs is needed.
