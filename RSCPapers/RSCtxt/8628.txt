    , Accepted 5th July 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractSolar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) systems have attracted increasing attention due to their great prospects for breaking the Shockley–Queisser limit. As a critical component of high-performance STPV systems, fabrication of a spectrally selective emitter with good stability at high temperature is one of the main research challenges. In this study, we developed a hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter with spectral selectivity and high temperature stability using a simple fabrication process by introducing a controlled silicon nitride (SiNx) layer on a silicon stepped nanopillar substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo). Owing to the cooperative effect of cavity mode resonance and the interference effect of the SiNx dielectric layer, our proposed silicon-based metasurface emitter achieves a broadband optical absorption of ∼95% in the wavelength range of 220–2000 nm, while effectively suppressing the heat radiation to ∼19% in the long wavelength range (>5 μm). Moreover, polarization-independence and angle-insensitivity behaviors are demonstrated in the emitters. Additionally, due to the presence of a SiNx protection layer, this silicon-based metasurface emitter is experimentally proved to sustain its excellent spectral properties after ultra-high temperature treatments, including annealing at 1273 K under an Ar atmosphere for 6 h, even at 1073 K in air for 1 h, which makes it an alternative candidate for application in actual STPV systems.
1. Introduction
Energy crisis and environmental disruption in the past decades have greatly boosted the research for alternatives to traditional fossil foils. Due to its cleanness and abundance, solar energy stands out as a particularly promising candidate, and a photovoltaic (PV) cell is the main utilization form of solar energy extraction. However, the efficiency of conventional semiconductor PV cells is dependent on the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit.1 Sub-bandgap photons cannot be absorbed, resulting in transmission loss, while in photons with energy much higher than the band gap, the excess energy of carriers generated by intrinsic absorption during in-band relaxation is transferred to the lattice atoms, resulting in thermalization.2 For the sake of surpassing the S–Q limit, an efficient solar energy conversion technology named solar thermophotovoltaics (STPV) is attracting increasing attention, and its theoretical efficiency can reach 54% and 85.4% under unconcentrated and fully concentrated solar radiation,3–5 respectively. The core of STPV systems is the coordinated spectral regulation of broadband absorbers and selective emitters by absorbing solar energy efficiently and reshaping the thermal radiation spectrum to match the bandgap of the bottom PV cell. Thus, the optical properties of spectrally selective emitters are crucial for high-efficiency energy conversion of STPV systems.
Carbon-based solar absorbers, especially graphene-based solar absorbers,6–9 have been reported due to their outstanding optical properties. However, the ultrabroadband absorption performance ranging from the ultraviolet to the terahertz regime of graphene makes it difficult to limit the absorption in the desired cut-off wavelength range. Therefore, various spectrally selective emitters with different structures have been studied,10 including blazed gratings11–13 or fishnet gratings,14 micro-cavities,15 2D16–18 or 3D photonic crystals,19 and metamaterials.20–25 Actually, according to Wien's displacement law, the surface temperature of thermal emitters in STPV systems is generally over 1000 K,20 so practical thermal emitters are generally constructed of refractory materials,26 such as titanium nitride (TiN),27–31 nickel (Ni),32,33 titanium (Ti),34,35 chromium (Cr),36,37 tungsten (W),2,23,38–42 tantalum (Ta),16,43 and Mo.44,45 For example, S. L. Wu et al.29 demonstrated a TiN-based metasurface selective absorber fabricated through continuously variable spatial frequency photolithography, and a calculated average absorption of 87% from 250 nm to 2300 nm and 29% in the wavelength range of 5 μm–13 μm was achieved. Meanwhile, owing to the protection of the SiNx layer, the absorber remained stable after annealing at 1073 K in a vacuum for 4 h. A. Chirumamilla et al.45 fabricated a spectrally selective emitter based on 3D Mo nanopillars by hole-mask colloidal lithography, also demonstrating the thermal stability up to 1473 K for a 24 h duration under an inert gas atmosphere. However, due to the lack of dielectric layer coating, the structures may face the problem of instability when the environment is not ultrahigh vacuum. Also, the complex and expensive fabrication method limits the scale of these emitters and their use in actual STPV systems. Therefore, developing high-temperature stable nanostructures with excellent spectral selectivity using large-scale lithography-free fabrication methods is still challenging.
Here, taking advantage of the mature micro–nano-fabrication technology of silicon (Si) nanostructures, we demonstrated hybrid Si stepped nanopillar (NP)/Mo/SiNx metasurface emitters fabricated by polystyrene (PS) sphere lithography,30 with spectral selectivity, polarization-independence, and angle-insensitivity. Our designed silicon-based metasurface emitter achieves a broadband optical absorption of ∼95% in the wavelength range from 220 nm to 2000 nm and effectively suppresses the heat radiation to ∼19% in the long-infrared range (5 μm–11 μm). As revealed by FDTD simulations, a strong optical absorption in the specific wavelength range is attributed to cavity mode resonances. Furthermore, the metasurface emitters have been proved to possess outstanding thermal stability up to 1273 K under an Ar atmosphere, even 1073 K in air. Therefore, the demonstrated silicon-based metasurface emitters show great potential for application in high-temperature energy-conversion systems.
2. Experimental
A schematic diagram of the fabrication process for the hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx structure is presented in Fig. 1. After cleaning with the standard RCA procedure, Si wafers were coated with a monolayer of close-packed PS nanospheres, which were self-assembled46 on the de-ionized water surface with an initial diameter of DPS = 1 μm. Fig. S1a† presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the monolayer clock-packed PS nanospheres within a certain range. Then, the Si stepped NPs were fabricated by multi-step inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Next, a Mo layer was deposited through magnetron sputtering, after the removal of the PS nanospheres by ultrasonic processing in alcohol. In the end, a silicon nitride (SiNx) layer was found to serve as the encapsulation layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). More experimental details are described in the Experimental section.

3. Results and discussion
To quantify the absorption properties of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters, the reflectivity (R) and transmissivity (T) were measured using an ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectrometer (UV 3600, with integrating sphere ISR-3100 accessories) from 220 nm to 2600 nm, and the absorptivity (A) is defined as A = 100% − R − T. According to Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity of a surface in thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, the emission performance of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter is obtained by measuring its absorption spectrum. Due to the enhanced light trapping effect,47 the Si stepped NP absorber exhibits a better absorption characteristic than the Si plane and the Si NP absorber, as shown in Fig. 2a. Also, as presented in Fig. 2b and Fig. S1d,† the absorption performance of Si stepped NPs was improved by adjusting the ICP etching parameters to optimize the geometric aspect ratio of Si stepped NPs, while Fig. 2c–e show the SEM images of the Si stepped NPs with three typical geometries. Additionally, Fig. S1b and c† present the top-view and side-view SEM images of the Si stepped NPs, respectively, with the same ICP etching parameters as shown in Fig. 2d. It can be seen that the Si stepped NPs are uniform in diameter and height within a certain extent. However, the absorption range of the pure Si absorber is limited by its energy gap (1.12 eV).

In order to broaden the absorption spectrum, metallic Mo with a nominal thickness of 60 nm was sputtered on the Si plane, Si NPs and Si stepped NPs, respectively. As presented in Fig. 3a, due to the high imaginary part of the permittivity, the flat metallic Mo film exhibits a broad but relatively low absorption. Correspondingly, by integrating the strong light trapping effect and the cavity resonance effect, the Si stepped NP/Mo structure achieves greatly improved optical absorption performance in comparison with the Si NP/Mo structure. To achieve better optical absorption performance, we optimized the structure and compared the Si stepped NPs with different ICP etching parameters coated with 30 nm Mo. It can be seen that the Si stepped NPs (ICP etching parameters: 300 s-O2 210 s-300 s) exhibit better absorption characteristics, as shown in Fig. S2a.† To study the dependence on the Mo layer thickness of absorption spectra, we fabricated 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 nm thick Mo layers on the Si stepped NPs (ICP etching parameters: 300 s-O2 210 s-300 s), and the results are shown in Fig. 3b. Clearly, the absorption spectra show little difference especially when the Mo layer is 60, 90, or 120 nm thick. Then, a 36 nm thick SiNx layer was deposited on the Si stepped NP/Mo structure. As presented in Fig. 3c and Fig. S2b,† the absorption spectra of the hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx structure are further enhanced, compared with the Si stepped NP/Mo structure. The enhancement of the absorption spectra largely results from the fact that the SiNx film contributes to the appearance of the interference-induced peak, which is confirmed by the samples shown in Fig. 4a. As the thickness of the SiNx layer increases, the peak red-shifts, as shown in Fig. 4b and Table S1.† Moreover, stronger optical absorption within the visible light range (400 nm–780 nm) can be achieved after deposition of ∼36 nm SiNx. The ratio can reach 97% in the visible light range and 95% over a broadband wavelength from 220 nm to 2000 nm. Thus, by introducing a controlled SiNx layer, we could tune the position of the interference peak and achieve an enhanced optical absorption performance of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters.

Furthermore, the reflection spectra of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters in the range of 2600 nm–11000 nm were measured in the form of percentages using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. Absorption spectra were then calculated using the formula A = 100% − R (T ∼0), where A is the absorptivity, R is the reflectivity, and T is the transmissivity. Fig. 5a shows the calculated absorption spectrum of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter for the normal incidence from 220 nm to 11000 nm. Obviously, experimental results show that an average solar absorptivity of 94.8% is achieved in the wavelength range of 220 nm–2000 nm. Meanwhile, an average thermal emissivity of 19.1% is obtained from 5000 nm to 11000 nm. This finding indicates that the proposed structure absorbs the vast majority, i.e., ∼95% of the incident solar energy, and most of the energy is not wasted by heat dispersion through IR radiation. The dependence on the Mo layer thickness of the absorption spectra of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters was also studied. Clearly, there are only slight differences among the absorption spectra in Fig. S2c,† where the nominal thicknesses of the Mo film are 60, 90, 120, and 150 nm. Therefore, our fabricated hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter possesses excellent spectral selectivity, which is suitable for STPV applications. Also, polarization and angular dependence were characterized through the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. On the one hand, polarization independence of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter was confirmed by experimental results shown in Fig. 5b. Fig. 5c shows the simulated absorption spectra for various polarization angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90°. Obviously, the optical absorption performance with various polarization angles remains totally the same, because nanostructures with symmetric configurations contribute to the identical light response mode for different polarization angles. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5d, the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter maintains good optical absorption performance as the incident angle increases from 0° to 60°.

(c and d) Contour plots of the simulated absorption spectra of the silicon-based metasurface emitter as a function of wavelength and polarization angle/incident angle, respectively. 
To understand the physical mechanism underlying the optical behavior, numerical electromagnetic simulations were obtained through the FDTD method. We performed a series of simulations for the Si stepped NP, Si stepped NP/Mo, and Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx structures. Here, for the sake of accuracy and simplicity, we employed the rough wire structure in the FDTD library as a model of the Mo and SiNx films to approximate the experimentally fabricated Mo and SiNx layers with irregular grooves or nanoparticles, which is demonstrated in Fig. S1e and f.†Fig. 6a and b show the electric field distributions of the hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx structure at 800 nm and 1600 nm, respectively. It can be seen that strong electric field localizations are observed between the hybrid stepped NPs due to the generation of cavity mode resonances, which trap and localize the propagating waves.45 Because of the high imaginary part of the permittivity of Mo, which makes it behaves as a lossy metal, the energy can be efficiently dissipated along the Mo layer. Moreover, there also exist Mie resonances31,48–53 in the Si stepped NPs at 800 nm, which localize the electric field mainly in the forward direction, and then the energy can be efficiently absorbed by the Si stepped NPs. Therefore, the enhanced absorption performance is associated with the cavity mode resonances of the hybrid stepped NPs, the high lossy nature of Mo and Mie resonances in the Si stepped NPs.

(d) Simulated electric field distribution of the hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx structure at 800 nm with incident angles of 30° and 60°. 
In addition, when the sample with a hexagonal dense stack structure is irradiated with polarized incident light, the cross section of electric field distribution rotates with the corresponding polarization angle and presents similar distribution, as presented in Fig. 6c, and Fig. S3a and b† show that the lengthwise section of electric field distribution with the same polarization angle as incident light is almost the same. Also, as shown in Fig. 6d, the electric field was still firmly confined to the interior and sidewall of the top nanopillars when the incident angle increased to 30° and 60°. The localized electric field distribution offered theoretical proof of the good optical absorption performance under a bevel angle. The FDTD results further help us to demonstrate the good optical absorption performance of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters with the excellent optical properties of spectral selectivity, polarization independence and incident angle insensitivity.
It is well known that thermal stability is crucial for spectrally selective emitters when operating at high temperatures, such as for STPV devices, where the operation temperature may exceed 1200 K. Thus, we studied the thermal stability of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters under an inert gas atmosphere and in air to test the adaptability to extreme environments. Fig. 7a shows the absorption spectra and SEM characterization of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter measured at room temperature before and after annealing at 1273 K for 6 h under an ambient Ar atmosphere, and the strong selective optical absorption performance and structural integrity could be well preserved after annealing. Due to the changes between the refractive indexes of Mo before and after annealing,45 there is a gradual decrease of the absorption spectra in the wavelength range from 3000 nm to 6000 nm shown in Fig. S2d.† Likewise, their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show no difference, as shown in Fig. 7b. Moreover, the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter after annealing at 1273 K for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere was tested through a heating/cooling cycle for a more 6 h duration. Remarkably, the optical absorption performance still remains stable under the heating/cooling cycle of additional annealing treatment at 1273 K for 6 h. Besides, the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter was annealed at 1073 K in air for 1 h, and there is no obvious difference between the absorption spectra, so as SEM images, as shown in Fig. 7c. Fig. 7d shows that there is no obvious change between their XRD patterns, except that the diffraction peak of Mo at (200) becomes higher after annealing at 1073 K in air for 1 h. However, Fig. S4a† shows the reduction of the optical absorption performance after annealing at 1073 K in air for a long time and the destruction of the hybrid structure. Fig. S4b† shows the diffraction peak of Mo at (200) disappeared after annealing for a long time. Meanwhile, Fig. 7e shows that there is a sharp degradation of the optical absorption performance of the hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter after annealing at 1173 K in air for 1 h, and the structure after annealing at 1173 K in air for 1 h was severely damaged, i.e., peeling off. As presented in Fig. 7f, after annealing at 1173 K in air for 1 h, XRD patterns show no diffraction peaks for Mo, and only a Si reflex at (100) is observed, which is quite different from the initial sample. Thus, our fabricated hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitters could maintain the stability of the optical absorption performance and structure after annealing at 1273 K under an Ar atmosphere for 6 h, even 1073 K in air for 1 h, which is beneficial for application in actual STPV systems.

A comparison of our results and fabrication characteristics with those of other state-of-the-art absorbers or emitters based on similar structures is shown in Table S2.† The silicon-based metasurface emitter proposed here shows great optical absorption performance and good high-temperature stability both under an inert-gas atmosphere and in air due to the coating of a relatively thin SiNx dielectric layer. Moreover, the simple lithography-free fabrication method is suitable for large-scale application in STPV systems.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we systematically demonstrated a hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx metasurface emitter with spectral selectivity and high temperature stability, which can be fabricated through a facile large-scale lithography-free technique. The metasurface emitter achieves a broadband optical absorption of ∼95% in the wavelength range of 220–2000 nm and effectively suppresses the heat radiation to ∼19% in the long-infrared range. In addition, the optical performance of the emitter is insensitive to the polarization mode and incidence direction. As demonstrated by FDTD simulations, this excellent optical absorption performance is attributed to the cooperative effect of the cavity resonance in the Si stepped NP/Mo structure and the interference effect of the SiNx layer. Furthermore, the SiNx layer can protect the Si stepped NP/Mo structure from oxidation and other chemical reactions at high temperatures. The fabricated hybrid silicon-based metasurface emitter shows great resistance to ultra-high temperature treatment, maintaining the strong optical absorption characteristics through up to 1273 K annealing treatment under an Ar atmosphere for 6 h and 1073 K annealing treatment in air for 1 h, respectively. Overall, we believe that the hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx metasurface emitter provides an alternative candidate for various high-temperature energy-conversion applications, such as energy harvesting and conversion devices, STPV, and high-temperature photonic applications.
5. Experimental section
5.1. Device fabrication
The fabrication procedure of the hybrid Si stepped NP/Mo/SiNx structure involved PS sphere lithography, ICP treatment, magnetron sputtering and the PECVD technique. The bottom nanopillars of Si stepped NPs were fabricated by ICP treatment under a C4F8/SF6/O2 atmosphere with different etching durations, an ICP/RF power of 100 W/100 W, an C4F8/SF6/O2 gas flow rate of 15/10/40 sccm and a chamber pressure of 1 Pa. The size of PS nanospheres was then reduced by ICP etching under an O2 atmosphere with different treatment times, an ICP/RF power of 200 W/100 W, an O2 gas flow rate of 20 sccm and a chamber pressure of 1 Pa, and the top nanopillars of Si stepped NPs were fabricated by the same process as the bottom nanopillars. Next, the etched PS spheres were removed in alcohol solution after ultrasonication for 5 min, leaving the Si stepped NPs. Then, the Mo layer was coated through a magnetron sputtering technique, with a power of 100 W and an Ar flow rate of 40 sccm. The sputtering rate of Mo was about 0.33 nm s−1. Finally, the SiNx film was deposited with a power of 20 W and a SiH4/NH3 mixed flow rate of 5/5 sccm. The butterfly valve was fully open during the deposition of films, and the growth temperature was 623 K. The deposited rate of SiNx was approximately 0.2 nm s−1, and the refractive index of SiNx was approximately 2.94.
5.2. FDTD simulation
Electromagnetic simulations were carried out by the FDTD (Lumerical FDTD Solutions) method. In modeling 3D optical structures, a hexagonal dense stacking periodic structure was employed, and the periodic boundary conditions were set for the x and y directions, while perfectly matched layers were set for the z direction. A broadband plane wave source from 200 nm to 7000 nm was used for illumination. The incident plane wave source is polarized along the x direction. The values of reflectivity and transmissivity were detected by two power detectors on the top and bottom of the model, and the electric and magnetic field intensity distribution was measured by field intensity monitors crossing the model structure. The simulation time is the default duration-1000 fs. The condition of simulation temperature is 300 K. The condition of auto shutoff min is 10−6. The permittivity of Si was obtained from the Palik database, and the Mo's refractive index was acquired from Querry (https://refractiveindex.info/).
5.3. Characterization
The top-view and side-view SEM images of our samples were characterized using SEM (ZEISS Sigma). The crystal structures of the materials were tested by XRD (Bruker D8 Advance). The reflection spectra and transmission spectra of our fabricated samples in the ranges of 220–2600 nm and 2600–11000 nm were measured in the form of percentages at room temperature using a UV 3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) and an FT-IR photometer (iS50, Nicolet, America), respectively. The details of the above two spectrophotometers have been described in our previous work.54 Thermal annealing experiments were performed using a tube furnace (OTF-1200X-80-II).
