    , Accepted 17th July 2012First published on 18th July 2012AbstractNew alternating copolymers based on thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (TTz) derivatives were synthesized by Stille, Suzuki or direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation (DHAP) reactions using either benzodithiophene (BDT), dithienosilole (DTS), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), diketopyrrolopyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) or isoindigo units as comonomers. In particular, the direct hetero(arylation) polycondensation reaction has been shown to be a very interesting tool for a more efficient and economical access to new conjugated polymers. Modifications of the TTz moiety and of the polymer backbone show that it is possible to efficiently modulate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TTz-based copolymers. These conjugated polymers exhibit bandgaps between 1.07 and 1.82 eV with HOMO energy levels ranging from −5.06 to −5.48 eV and LUMO energy levels ranging from −3.61 to −4.02 eV.
Introduction
Over the past decade, a large number of studies have been carried out in the field of organic photovoltaics using alternating copolymers.1,2 It has been proven that the utilization of push–pull structures is an efficient way to tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the bandgaps to maximize the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Polymers utilized in such BHJ solar cells have now demonstrated power conversion efficiencies over 8%.3,4 Along these lines, different designs have been made to synthesize various electron-rich and electron-poor monomeric units. Carbazoles,5–7 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes,3,8,9 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]siloles,10–12 and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germoles4,13,14 are electron-donating units that led to highly efficient polymer-based BHJ solar cells when combined with electron-withdrawing units such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles (BT),15,16 diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diones (DPP),17–19 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-diones (TPD),10,20,21 thieno[3,4-b]thiophenes (TT),22 and benzo[d][1,2,3]triazoles (TAZ).8
Recently, we reported new push–pull conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (push) and thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (TTz) (pull) derivatives.23 Soon after, the group of Wei You published a new and more efficient procedure to synthesize the TTz moiety, as well as the synthesis of a similar BDT-TTz copolymer.24 Unfortunately, in both cases, devices fabricated with these polymers gave relatively low power conversion efficiencies (1.2–2.5%).23,24 Characterization of these polymers showed relatively high HOMO energies leading to a relatively low open circuit voltage (Voc) when blended with fullerene derivatives.
In order to overcome this limitation, we decided to try to tune the HOMO and LUMO energies by modifying the push–pull properties of the polymers. In this study, we accomplished this by adding aromatic substituents to the TTz moiety, exploring new comonomers and using the TTz unit either as a push or pull unit. Herein, we report the synthesis of two new TTz moieties and six new conjugated polymers based on thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (TTz) derivatives.
Synthesis of the monomers
In our previous work,23 we reported the synthesis of 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole according to the work of Kim and co-workers.25 This synthetic pathway was found to be difficult and not very efficient. Since then, Wei You's group reported a new and much more efficient synthetic procedure to obtain various 2-substituted-thieno[3,4-d]thiazoles.24 Following this new strategy, the syntheses of 2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (4a), 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5a), 4,6-dibromo-2-(4-octylphenyl)thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5b) and 4,6-dibromo-2-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5c) have been carried out and are described in Fig. 1. All synthetic steps are fully described in the ESI.†

Various substituents were placed onto the thieno[3,4-d]thiazole unit. In particular, the introduction of an aromatic substituent at the 2-position was believed to decrease the bandgap by giving rise to a sort of two-dimensional conjugated system. To achieve this goal, it is imperative that the substituted aromatic ring be coplanar to the thieno[3,4-d]thiazole moiety. X-ray diffraction analyses on single crystals of 4b confirmed that the aromatic substituent is indeed almost planar with a torsion angle of 3.0(3)° (Fig. 2).

Synthesis of the polymers
The first polymers were prepared to study the influence of an aromatic substituent on the TTz unit on the HOMO and LUMO energies. As shown in Fig. 3, P2 and P3 have been synthesized by Stille cross-coupling reactions between 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-di(ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and 4,6-dibromo-2-(4-octylphenyl)thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5b) for P2 and 4,6-dibromo-2-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5c) for P3 using conditions already reported for P1.23 Polymer P1, which has already been reported,23 was synthesized in this study via direct (hetero)arylation between 2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (4a) and 2,6-dibromo-4,8-di(ethylhexyl-oxyl)benzo[1,2b:4,5b′]dithiophene. The direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation reaction only involves a halogenated monomeric unit and a hydrogenated one. Thus, this reaction does not require the synthesis of stannylated compounds or pinnacol borane compound usually used in Stille or Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. In addition, the utilization of a hydrogenated compound usually saves a bromination step in the synthetic pathway for an overall reduction of two synthetic steps in the fabrication of the copolymer. The reaction was carried out in a sealed vessel with equimolar ratio of both monomers, 4 mol% of trans-di(μ-acetato)bis[o-(di-o-tolyl-phosphino)benzyl]dipalladium(II), 8 mol% of tris(2-methoxyphenyl)phosphine, 30 mol% of pivalic acid and 2.3 equivalent of cesium carbonate in THF (anhydrous and oxygen-free) and heated to 120 °C for 24 h. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements based on monodisperse polystyrene standards in trichlorobenzene at 140 °C have been performed and the values are reported in Table 1. Values obtained from SEC measurements for the direct (hetero)arylation synthesis of P1 show a Mn of 32 kg mol−1 which is the same Mn value reported for the Stille reaction.23 These results show that DHAP can be applied to a wide variety of copolymers and it is possible to achieve molecular weights as high as those obtained by Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. Optical and electrochemical analyses comparing the two methods are shown in the ESI.†

Polymers P4 to P8 were synthesized by various cross-coupling reactions (Stille, Suzuki or direct (hetero)arylation) by combining 2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (4a) or 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5a) with different push or pull units. The synthesis and characterisation of P4 have already been reported in the literature.23 Polymer P5 has been synthesized by a Stille cross-coupling reaction between monomer 5a and 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole. SEC values obtained for P5 correspond to a Mn of 11 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index of 2.0. P6 and P7 have both been synthesized by this new direct (hetero)arylation polymerization.26 In the case of P6, 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5a) was coupled with 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione by DHAP to obtain the resulting copolymer P6. SEC measurements of P6 demonstrated a Mn of 8 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index of 1.8. It has been shown that the ketone of the TPD unit can form a strong bond with a nearby sulfur of a thiophene ring.27 The low molecular weight obtained for P6 is probably due to a strong rigidity of the polymer backbone caused by the interaction between the ketone of the TPD unit and the thiophene ring of the TTz unit reducing therefore the solubility of this rigid-rod material. In the case of P6, the utilization of the direct (hetero)arylation polymerization is particularly useful because this is the only available procedure to obtain this polymer. Indeed, in our hands, no stable and pure tin or pinacol borane derivatives can be prepared with either the TPD or the TTz unit. P7 has also been synthesized by DHAP. In that case, 2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole was copolymerized with 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione using the same conditions as those utilized for P6 to obtain the copolymer P7. The number-average molecular weight obtained for P7 was 17 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index of 2.9. This polymer could have been prepared by Suzuki cross-coupling reaction instead of a direct (hetero)arylation polymerisation since a pinacol borane derivative of the DPP unit has already been reported.28 However, this derivative is not easy to synthesize and to purify, therefore the direct (hetero)arylation reaction allows this polymer to be synthetically viable. The synthesis of P6 and P7 demonstrates that it is possible to use either the TTz derivatives directly or halogenated analogues to undergo DHAP. Finally, P8 has been prepared from a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (5a) and 6,6′-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)(N,N′-2-hexyldecyl)-dibromoisoindigo. The reaction has been carried out with equimolar ratio of monomers, 0.5 mol% of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and 2 mol% of tri(o-tolyl)phosphine mixed in an anhydrous and oxygen free mixture of toluene/DMF (10/1 v/v). The polymerization reaction was carried out at 110 °C for 48 hours. SEC measurements on P8 show a Mn of 23 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index of 1.9.
Optical properties
Solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers P1 to P8 are shown in Fig. 4. Additionally, all solid-state and solution UV-vis spectra for each polymer are available separately in the ESI.†P1 and P4 have already been reported in the literature23 and are shown in Fig. 4 for comparison purposes. The solid-state UV-vis absorption spectrum of P2 shows two absorption peaks at 607 nm and 656 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.66 eV. In the case of P3, the spectrum shows two absorption peaks at 600 nm and 640 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.69 eV. Compared to P1 (alkyl chain on the TTz moiety), the addition of an aromatic ring (P2 and P3) leads to a decrease of the optical bandgap. The decrease of the bandgap supports the assumption that the aromatic ring remains coplanar with the conjugated backbone. Spectra of P2 and P3 also show that the nature of the alkyl chain on the aromatic ring does not have any significant effect on the optical properties.
 Fig. 4  Solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 to P8. 
Next, we wanted to study the effect of using different comonomers with alkylated TTz derivatives (P4 to P8). The solid-state UV-vis absorption spectrum of P5 reveals one absorption band at 655 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.54 eV. If one compares this polymer with its thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) analog, PDTSTPD10 which has an optical bandgap of 1.73 eV, we could suggest that the lower bandgap obtained with P5 is due to a more efficient stabilization of the quinoid form in the TTz moiety. However, if one compares P1 with its TPD analog, PBDTTPD,20 it is reported that both polymers have about the same optical bandgap of 1.8 eV. So, at this point, it is not possible to make any clear conclusions about the quinoidal properties of the TTz unit and what causes a smaller bandgap for P5. In the case of P6, the TTz-TPD copolymer, the solid-state UV-vis spectrum shows one absorption peak at 680 nm with an estimated optical bandgap of 1.43 eV. One could compare the TPD unit with the TTz unit by comparing the homopolymer of TPD with our TTz-TPD copolymer. The former has a bandgap of 1.91 eV26 while the latter has a much smaller value of 1.43 eV. In that case, it seems that the quinoid structure is more favorable and leads to a strong decrease of the optical bandgap. Futhermore, a homopolymer of TTz has already been reported by Kim et al. and shows an optical bandgap of 1.26 eV.25 Copolymers P7 and P8 are based on TTz and diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diones (DPP) or isoindigo units, respectively. These polymers have no TPD analogs reported in the literature. For P7, we obtained one broad absorption peak between 856 and 965 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.07 eV. For P8, the solid-state UV-vis absorption spectrum shows one absorption peak at 750 nm and an optical bandgap of 1.43 eV.
Electrochemical properties
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Table 1) of P1 to P8 were estimated from redox onsets of the polymers using cyclic voltammetry. P1 to P8 voltammograms are shown in Fig. 5 and individual voltammograms are reported in the ESI.† As mentioned above, polymers P1 and P4 have already been reported in the literature and are shown in Fig. 5 for comparison purposes. As shown in Fig. 5, P2 exhibits one quasi-reversible oxidation and two quasi-reversible reduction processes giving estimated HOMO–LUMO energy levels at −5.21 eV and −3.63 eV, respectively. Polymer P3 has a quasi-reversible oxidation and a quasi-reversible reduction process leading to a HOMO energy level of −5.20 eV and a LUMO energy level of −3.76 eV. Comparison of P1, P2 and P3 showed that addition of an aromatic ring to the TTz moiety led to a smaller optical and electrochemical bandgap. Indeed, P2 and P3 have their HOMO energy level at about −5.2 eV whereas P1 has one at −5.33 eV. In addition, P2 and P3 have a little difference of 0.15 eV between their LUMO energy levels, which could be attributed to some kinetic effects during the electrochemical measurements since their optical bandgaps are more or less the same. A schematic representation of P1 to P3 HOMO and LUMO energy levels is shown in Fig. 6.

 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of P1 to P3 HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 
For P5, the TTz moiety with the simple alkyl chain was coupled to the electron-rich dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) unit. In this case, the cyclic voltammetry of P5 shows one quasi-reversible oxidation process and one non-reversible reduction process, leading to a high lying HOMO energy level at −5.06 eV and a LUMO energy level at −3.64 eV. Therefore, because P5 is much more electron-rich than the two BDT derivatives used for P1 and P4, the HOMO energy level of P5 lies at a higher value. Since we had relatively high lying HOMOs with TTz used as the pull unit, we wanted to also investigate its potential as a push unit since it was believed that its poor electron-donating abilities compared to BDT derivatives and DTS would help to lower the HOMO energy levels. P6 shows two quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction processes. The estimated HOMO energy level is at −5.37 eV whereas the estimated LUMO energy level lies at −3.85 eV. One can observe that while studying different push–pull alternating copolymers (P1–P5), the electronic properties seem to vary in the same way: more significant changes occur in the HOMO energy levels whereas the LUMO energy levels remain more or less the same. In the case of P6, this copolymer could be described as a pull–pull unit. Effectively, in that case, both HOMO and LUMO energy levels seem to have decreased. However, this effect does not seem to fit with every pull–pull copolymer synthesized. In fact, the cyclic voltammogram of P7 shows one quasi-reversible oxidation process and one quasi-reversible reduction, leading to a HOMO energy level at −5.22 eV and a LUMO energy level at −3.99 eV. Finally, P8 exhibits one quasi-reversible oxidation process and one quasi-reversible reduction process. The estimated HOMO energy level is at −5.48 eV and the LUMO energy level at −4.02 eV. In that case, both HOMO and LUMO energy levels are relatively low when compared with the previous push–pull copolymers. A schematic representation of P4 to P8 HOMO and LUMO energy levels is shown in Fig. 7.

Conclusion
In this study, we reported the synthesis and characterization of new poly(thienothiazole) derivatives. Alternating copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes (BDT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]siloles (DTS), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-diones (TPD), diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diones (DPP) and isoindigo units have been synthesized and characterized for the first time. Some of these copolymers have been synthesized by direct (hetero)arylation which was either the only way or the most efficient procedure to synthesize them. This new synthetic method opens new doors to the synthesis of a whole new set of polymers that were not accessible before. The various copolymers synthesized in this study exhibit bandgaps between 1.07 and 1.82 eV with HOMO energy levels ranging from −5.06 to −5.48 eV and LUMO energy levels ranging from −3.61 to −4.02 eV. With these results, we have shown that it is possible to modulate the HOMO energy level by modifying the TTz moiety and to modulate both HOMO and LUMO energy levels by using different comonomers. Photovoltaic devices made of these new polymers are currently under investigation.
