 oxygen evolution on α-Fe2O3 films was studied using the Fe3+ ion as a sacrificial oxidizing
 agent. The reaction conditions affecting the oxygen evolution rate, i.e. anion, Fe3+ concentration, pH,
 Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibrium concentration and dependence of irradiation wavelength, were investigated. The reaction
 rate increased with increase of both the Fe3+ ion concentration and the solution pH. Oxygen evolution
 ceased at an Fe3+
:Fe2+ ion concentration ratio of 3:7–4:
6. The reaction rate decreased rapidly for longer-wavelength
 irradiation (above around 400 nm),
 which is considerably
 shorter than the
 α-Fe2O3 bandgap of ca. 600 nm (2.1 eV).1. IntroductionOxygen evolution from water using photocatalysts with UV
 irradiation has been intensively studied.1–6 However, reports of
 research based on visible light irradiation are limited.7–9 The
 α-Fe2O3
 photoelectrode has received considerable attention as
 a solar energy conversion material because of its excellent properties,
 such as a small bandgap, high resistivity toward corrosion
 and low cost. This material has especially been used
 as a photoanode for the photoassisted electrolysis of water.10
 The energy band position of α-Fe2O3 is located favorably for
 the oxidation reaction of water to oxygen; the flatband potential
 has been reported to be −0.1 V s. SCE at pH 6.3.11 Although
 α-Fe2O3 has been extensively investigated as a photoelectrode, it
 has rarely been applied as a photocatalyst for oxygen evolution.
 Iron oxide in a hydrous form has been studied previously.7,8
 Apart from oxygen evolution, the α-Fe2O3
 photocatalyst
 has been used for the oxidation of CN−, SO32−,12,13 or halide ions.14
 It was also reported that the hydrous ferric oxide had better
 results than a TiO2-based catalyst in the photogeneration
 of NH3
.15In
 this paper we studied photocatalytic oxygen evolution on
 α-Fe2O3 films using the Fe3+ ion as a sacrificial oxidizing agent.
 The reaction conditions which affect the oxygen evolution rate,
 such as anion effect, Fe3+ concentration, pH effect, Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibrium
 concentration and dependence of irradiation wavelength,
 were investigated. The properties of the Fe3+ ion as
 a sacrificial agent for oxygen evolution have been studied previously
 in other semiconducting powder photocatalyst systems.6,9
 The use of the Fe3+ ion has the advantage over, e.g. the
 S2O82− ion8 that the reaction is thermodynamically far more
 uphill (favorable for energy conversion from light to chemical
 energy) because the redox potential of Fe3+ is more negative
 than S2O82−. It is also advantageous over the Ag+ ion7 because
 Fe3+/Fe2+ is a reversible redox couple which exists in the
 solution phase whereas the Ag+ ion can be reduced to Ag only by
 being deposited on the photocatalyst surface. The α-Fe2O3
 films
 were fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering. α-Fe2O3 can be formed
 by various methods such as sputtering, chemical vapor deposition
 (CVD), sintering or flame oxidation of iron metal. Here
 we applied sputtering, which is a relatively controllable
 method in which the deposition
 parameters (film thickness,
 substrate temperature, RF power, deposition atmosphere and
 pressure, etc.) can be changed for characterization and
 optimized in future studies.2. ExperimentalThe
 α-Fe2O3 film was deposited on a glass substrate by RF magnetron
 sputtering from an Fe2O3 target (Furuuchi Chemical)
 in an argon atmosphere. The applied input power was 100–150
 W, which provided a deposition rate of 0.3–0.7 Å s−1. Photocatalytic
 oxygen evolution was performed at room temperature
 using a closed gas-circulating system. The details of
 the system have been described previously.16 The α-Fe2O3 film
 sample and the aqueous solution containing the Fe3+ ion were introduced
 into a quartz reaction cell. After the reaction cell was
 deaerated and substituted with 60 kPa Ar, the cell was irradiated
 with a 250 W high-pressure Hg lamp (USHIO, ML-251A/A). The
 gas evolved on irradiation was analyzed using gas chromatography
 (Ar carrier, Yanaco-G2800). Fe3+ and Fe2+ ion
 concentrations were determined by measuring UV–vis absorption
 spectra after complexation with thiocyanic acid for
 the Fe3+ ion and with 2,2′-dipyridyl for the Fe2+
 ion.3. Results and
 discussionIt
 was found from the XRD spectrum that the sample consisted
 of α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 1). The α-Fe2O3 film started to absorb light from ca.
 600 nm corresponding to a bandgap of 2.1 eV (Fig. 2), which
 is the typical bandgap value of α-Fe2O3 reported in the literature.17Fig. 3 shows the amount of oxygen which was evolved
 by successive irradiation. The reaction cell was evacuated and
 refilled with 60 kPa Ar repeatedly after each experimental
 cycle of irradiation, and subsequent gas analysis was fulfilled. In most experiments the oxygen evolution rate decreased gradually over the first few hours and then approached a constant
 value. Oxygen evolution was not observed in the absence
 of Fe3+ ion in solutions, and the reaction was apparently
 found to be catalytic from the fact that oxygen evolved in amounts far more than the stoichiometric amount from the α-Fe2O3
 samples, with a film thickness of 1 μm, typically engaged in the present study. Similar results were even obtained using samples with a film thickness of 300 Å. Fig. 1  XRD
 pattern for the film deposited by RF magnetron sputtering.  Fig. 2  Absorption spectrum of the α-Fe2O3 film.  Fig. 3  Oxygen evolved with successive irradiation in 1 M FeCl3. 
The oxygen evolution rate was greater in 1 M Fe[(NO)3]3 (pH
 0.6) than in 1 M FeCl3 (pH 1.0). However, this is considered
 to result from an event such as decomposition of the NO3−
 ion. It was confirmed that oxygen was evolved on irradiating
 the α-Fe2O3 film in HNO3
, or even from HNO3 alone, thus
 leading to excess oxygen evolution regardless of the photocatalytic
 reaction. In 0.5 M Fe2(SO4)3 (pH 0.6) oxygen did
 not evolve owing to its low pH value, which reduced the
 photocatalytic reaction activity, as will be described
 below. Hereafter, we focussed on an investigation of the photocatalytic
 oxygen evolution reaction using FeCl3 solutions.On
 increasing the Fe3+ ion concentration, the oxygen evolution
 rate increased. For instance, at pH 1.8 oxygen evolution was
 not observed in 0.001 M FeCl3, while oxygen evolved at an
 initial rate of 0.9 μmol h−1
 cm−2 in 0.1 M FeCl3 (we used the term ‘initial rate’ for the amount evolved during the first hour of irradiation).
 An increase in the Fe3+ ion concentration led to
 a decrease in the solution pH. Therefore, if the Fe3+ ion concentration
 was simply changed (i.e. without 
adding other
 electrolytes in order to keep the pH constant), the effect of
 pH on the reaction rate had to be taken into account at the
 same time. The initial oxygen evolution rate increased up
 to 4 μmol h−1 cm−2 in 1 M FeCl3. The pH of 1 M FeCl3 (pH 1.0) could
 not be increased so as to compare the results because precipitation
 of iron hydroxide occurred.The
 oxygen evolution rate decreased as the solution pH
 decreased. As seen in Table 1, the initial oxygen evolution rate
 decreased with decrease in pH in 0.1 M FeCl3. When the
 Fe3+
 ion concentration was adjusted to 0.0064 M FeCl3, the amount
 of evolved oxygen became larger at pH 0.82 than at pH
 1.7 on prolonged irradiation. This was caused by the photodissolution reaction of the α-Fe2O3 film, which involved oxygen
 evolution. It was observed that the α-Fe2O3 film peeled off from
 the glass substrate, broke into small pieces and dissolved in
 the solution. The α-Fe2O3 photoanodic dissolution reaction, which
 is accompanied by oxygen evolution, is written as follows
 at pH 1:10,18

 was suggested that stability toward photoanodic dissolution
 could be achieved if the Fermi level of the redox couple in
 solution were more negative than the decomposition potential,
 ED.19,20 According to this criterion, α-Fe2O3 should be stable
 in the pH range for which the O2/H2O level is more negative
 than ED of the above reaction (typically >pH 0) in the present
 system. The dissolution reaction rate will be affected
 not only by pH but also by Fe3+ ion concentration, as is found
 from the above equation. It is considered that the dissolution
 was effectively suppressed in 1 M FeCl3, while it proceeded
 readily in 0.0064 M FeCl3 under low pH conditions. The
 observed pH dependence on the photocatalytic oxygen evolution
 rate could be explained by the fact that the flatband
 potential of α-Fe2O3 is shifted according to the Nernstian formula11
 with the oxidation potential of water to oxygen, while the
 standard redox potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ moves in the positive
 direction with increasing solution pH.21 Other factors, such
 as ion adsorption onto the α-Fe2O3
 surface, may need to be
 considered simultaneously.We
 examined how much oxygen would evolve from a given
 initial Fe3+ ion concentration before the photocatalytic oxygen
 evolution reaction ceased. With an initial concentration
 of 0.01 M FeCl3, oxygen continued to evolve until the Fe3+
 ion was consumed to reach a concentration of ca. 0.003 M
 (Fig. 4). For this calculation, it was assumed that one oxygen
 molecule evolved with the concomitant reduction of four
 Fe3+ ions to Fe2+. Accordingly, the concentration ratio between
 Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions in the equilibrium state is estimated
 to be 3:
7. Further, the absorption spectra were measured
 for the Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions, respectively, by withdrawing
 a portion of the solution after the reaction, and the concentration
 ratio was evaluated as 4:6. The experimental error
 was within 25% through all the experiments between the values
 calculated from the amount of oxygen evolution and from
 the absorption spectra. The equilibrium concentration ratio
 was approximately the same (3:7–4:6) for an 
initial concentration
 of 0.001 M FeCl3. The forward and backward reactions
 of Fe3++e−→Fe2+ are considered to become equilibrated at this Fe3+:Fe2+ concentration ratio. We also performed
 an experiment in which the concentration ratio was initially
 regulated at [Fe3+]/[Fe2+]=1 ([Fe3+], [Fe2+]=0.005 M) before the irradiation
 was started. Here, oxygen evolution was hardly observed,
 demonstrating that the Fe3+ ion concentration in the initial
 solution was already lower than that in the equilibrium
 state. This result supports the above idea concerning the equilibrium
 state, although it gave a different equilibrium concentration
 ratio (5:
5), which could arise as a result of different experimental procedures. It was reported that oxygen evolution occurred above an Fe3+/Fe2+ molar ratio of ca. 0.2 in the WO3
 photocatalyst system,22 while oxygen continued to
 evolve until all of the Fe3+ ion was thoroughly reduced to become
 Fe2+ ion in the TiO2 system.6 In the latter case, the
 equilibrium concentration ratio was considerably reduced because
 the Fe3+ ion adsorbed preferentially over the Fe2+ ion
 onto the TiO2 surface. Noticeable adsorption of Fe3+ ion
 onto the α-Fe2O3 surface was not observed in the present study,
 which was confirmed from measurement of the Fe3+ ion concentration
 in solution. One important factor for facilitating
 photocatalytic reactions would be to design the photocatalytic
 system so that the sacrificial reacting species can be favorably
 adsorbed onto the surface. Fig. 4  Cumulative
 amount of oxygen evolved with successive irradiation. The solution used was 0.01 M FeCl3 with amount of 2 ml. The dependence of oxygen evolution on the irradiation
 wavelength was examined by measuring the reaction rate
 using low-frequency pass filters. As seen in Table 2, the reaction
 rate decreased rapidly for irradiation of longer wavelength.
 Oxygen was not detectable when the 460 nm filter was used,
 although the α-Fe2O3 film was shown to absorb light from ca.
 600 nm. In the case of an Fe2O3 colloidal photocatalyst
 it was reported that the quantum efficiency decreased from a
 maximum at around 400 nm with increasing irradiation wavelength.7
 Moreover, in a study of water photo-oxidation
 on an α-Fe2O3 electrode,23 the absorption 
coefficient calculated
 from the photocurrent was smaller than that obtained
 from optical measurements in the longer-wavelength range.
 Hence our result accords with these studies. One possible reason
 for the observed wavelength dependence might be the fact
 that there exist two types of electronic transition in α-Fe2O3
.24,25 The first is the transition which takes place from the Fe3+(3d)
 band and the second is that from the O2−(2p) band. The hole
 mobility which is generated in the Fe3+(3d) band will be lower
 compared to that in the O2−(2p) band because of the narrowness
 of the d band. The energy required for the former transition
 (the onset is 2.1 eV for the bandgap excitation) is typically
 smaller than for the latter transition (an energy larger than ca. 3.0–3.5 eV is necessary26,27). Consequently,
 the above wavelength dependence might be because the
 hole mobility is lower (with the result that the number of
 holes which can reach the surface is smaller) in the former transition
 (generated by irradiation of a longer wavelength) than in
 the latter one (generated with a shorter wavelength). In addition
 to the hole mobility, the charge transfer site is also
 different between the two transitions,25 which could be
 another explanation for the experimental results. A similar
 case was made regarding water photo-oxidation with an α-Fe2O3
 electrode: the hole in the O2−(2p) band could react to evolve
 oxygen while that in the Fe3+(3d) band could not.23 In addition
 to these, it has been reported that the holes (electrons)
 created by shorter-wavelength light than the bandgap can
 reach the surface without being thermalized in the valence
 (conduction) band, leading to a higher reaction rate for
 shorter wavelength light.7,28 All these factors confirm
 our results, but further detailed investigations including the
 surface states,17,29 which affect the recombination process, must
 be done in order to clarify the mechanism.

 has been studied using Fe3+ ion as a sacrificial oxidizing agent.
 The reaction conditions affecting the oxygen evolution rate, such
 as anion effect, Fe3+ concentration, pH effect, Fe3+/Fe2+ equilibrium
 concentration and dependence of irradiation wavelength,
 were investigated. The reaction rate increased with
 increase of both the Fe3+ ion concentration and the solution
 pH. The optimum solution condition for the reaction was
 1 M FeCl3; the NO3− and SO42− anions had the disadvantage
 of being decomposed on irradiation or of lowering the solution
 pH, and the highest concentration of FeCl3 gave the
 fastest reaction rate even at the expense of the lowest pH, with suppression of the α-Fe2O3 dissolution effectively. Oxygen ceased to evolve at an Fe3+:Fe2+
 concentration ratio of 3:7–4:6. The reaction rate decreased rapidly for longer wavelength irradiation
 above around 400 nm, although the absorption
 started from ca. 600 nm, for which a further detailed study is needed. The reaction efficiency would be expected to be improved
 on optimizing the α-Fe2O3 photocatalyst, by changing the sputtering conditions or by depositing RuO2 on the α-Fe2O3 film.AcknowledgementsT.
