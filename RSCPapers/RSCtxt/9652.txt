The electrochemical behaviour of Co2+ has been studied in ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrodeposition of Co2+ in EAN occurs at −0.95 V vs. Fc0/+, followed by hydrogen evolution reaction. The electro-oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ is found to be a reversible process in dried EAN at E1/2 = 1.47 V vs. Fc0/+. The presence of water significantly affects the voltammetric behaviour of Co2+ and the subsequent electrodeposition processes. Cobalt oxides nanostructures have been deposited onto glassy carbon and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates by two routes, (i) controlled-potential deposition of Co, followed by spontaneous air oxidation and (ii) controlled-potential deposition of Co followed by anodic oxidation in the presence of water. SEM, EDX, XRD and XPS reveal that cobalt oxides of different morphologies and chemical compositions are formed on the surface of electrodes. The cobalt oxides films exhibit catalytic activity towards water oxidation reaction in neutral phosphate buffered solution with low overpotentials.IntroductionWater electrolysis is a promising approach to store electricity generated from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, in the form of hydrogen, which could be used as a high energy density fuel or as an energy carrier for powering fuel cells.1 Water electrolysis consists of two half reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In comparison to HER, OER is more challenging owing to the high overpotential that arise from activation barriers, concentration effects, and voltage drops due to resistance.2 Various types of OER catalysts based on Ir, Ru and Pt have been developed to lower the overpotential and facilitate the OER process.3–5 However, the application of these precious metal based electrocatalysts have been greatly limited by their scarcity and nobility. The catalytic activity of cobalt oxides in water oxidation have been recognized since 1960s.6,7 In 2008, Nocera and coworkers reported a cobalt-based OER catalyst obtained from electrodeposition of Co2+ in a phosphate buffer solution. The finding stimulates significant renewed interest the development of OER catalysis based on inexpensive cobalt materials.8 A vast range of techniques have been developed to fabricate cobalt-based catalysts such as spray pyrolysis,9 radio frequency (RF)-sputtering,10 chemical vapour deposition,11,12 pulsed layer deposition,13 sol–gel process,14 spin coating, and electrodeposition.15,16 Among the techniques available, electrodeposition is a versatile approach which has been widely applied in industry.17 Electrodeposition allows precise control of the nucleation and growth processes, purity, structure, as well as the morphologies of the deposits. Besides that, electrodeposition is often performed under ambient and benign conditions.Cobalt metals can be electrodeposited from an aqueous NH4Cl or LiClO4 solutions, whereby the structures of cobalt are strongly influenced by the pH of solutions.18,19 In most of the cases, this process is associated with hydrogen evolution which affects the physical quality of the electrodeposited cobalt. Organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) have also been used for the electrodeposition of cobalt. However, the inevitable presence of water in the solvents lead to undesirable hydrolysis of the organic media which hampers the electrodeposition process.20 In an attempt to alleviate these issues, a new class of ionic liquids (ILs) electrolytes, has been used as for metal deposition due to their desirable properties such as wide electrochemical potential window, high ionic conductivity, simplicity of handling due to their non-volatility and non-flammability.21 Importantly, low interfacial tension in ionic liquids allows rapid nucleation and formation of nanoparticles,22,23 which is advantageous for achieving nanostructures with a large surface area to bulk ratio to facilitate fast electron transfer in electrocatalysis applications.24Electrodeposition of cobalt has been studied in aprotic ILs such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C4mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C4mim][Tf2N]).25–27 However, the solubility of cobalt salts in aprotic ionic liquids is generally low. Although, tetrahydrofuran has been commonly used to facilitate the dissolution of cobalt salts in aprotic ILs, however, it often complicates the electrodeposition process due to the formation of electrochemically inert cobalt complexes.25 Recently we have prepared and characterised a number of protic ionic liquids (PILs).28,29 Compared to aprotic ILs, PILs offer advantages such as low cost, low viscosity, high conductivity which allows fast mass transport and high solubility of common metal salts.30,31 We also have shown that PILs are useful electrolytes for electrodeposition of silver and copper micro/nanostructures.17,31In this study we report, for the first time, the electrodeposition of cobalt/cobalt oxides from a PIL, ethylammonium nitrate (EAN). The electrochemical behaviours of cobalt in EAN have been examined by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrodeposited cobalt oxides were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrodeposited cobalt oxides materials exhibit significant catalytic activity towards electrochemical oxidation of water to oxygen.ExperimentalMaterialsCobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2) was purchased from Prolabo (France) with R.P Normapur grade. NaH2PO4 was purchased from Ajax APS (Australia) and Na2HPO4 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia). High purity ethylammonium nitrate (EAN, >97%) was purchased from Io-Li-Tec (Germany) and dried at 100 °C in vacuo for 60 h. The dried ionic liquid was then stored in an argon-purged glove box with a water content less than 5 ppm.Electrochemical measurementsAll the electrochemical measurements were undertaken under normal bench-top laboratory conditions at 25 ± 0.2 °C with a CH760 Electrochemical Workstation (CH Instrument, Texas, USA) using a gas-tight three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration. Glassy carbon (GC) and indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass electrode were used as the working electrode for voltammetric studies. Prior to any measurements, the GC electrodes were polished with an aqueous 0.05 μm alumina slurry (CH Instrument, Texas, USA) on Microcloth polishing cloth (Buehler, Illinois, USA), then thoroughly rinsed with deionised water and acetone before being dried with low-lint tissue (Kimberly-Clark, Wisconsin, USA). ITO-coated glass (PrazisionsGlas and Optik GmbH, Iserlohn, Germany, 10 Ω cm−2 sheet resistance) was cleaned using sonication in acetone for 10 minutes followed by rinsing with absolute ethanol and drying under N2 stream. For measurements in ethylammonium nitrate, an Ag wire was used as the quasi reference electrode and then calibrated to the Fc0/+ internal standard potential reference. For electrolysis, a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode (RE) and a Pt wire counter electrode was used.Water electrolysis was performed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.0) in a custom-made cell composed of two gastight compartments to separate the anode (cobalt oxides/ITO) and reference electrode from the cathode (Pt wire). The two compartments were separated with a glass frit. Oxygen detection was performed by using a fluorescent oxygen sensor (NeoFox, Ocean Optics, USA) positioned into the headspace of the anode compartment through an airtight septum. Prior to the electrolysis, the electrolyte was purged with a stream of N2 gas for 60 min to remove the dissolved O2 in the electrolyte. The background oxygen level was then monitored for 30 minutes prior to electrolysis to ensure the cell was gastight.Physical characterizationEAN was used in bench-top laboratory conditions and their water contents were measured by Karl-Fischer (KF) titration using a 821 KF Coulometer (Metrohm, Switzerland). Scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed using FEI Nova SEM 230 with a Bruker energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) system operated on 10 kV accelerating voltage. The thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was generated using a PANalytical X'Pert Materials Research Diffractometer (MRD) machine. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi under 10 scans, 200 s, 500 μm, CAE 20.0 and 0.10 eV operating parameters.Result and discussionElectrochemical behavior of Co2+ in “dried” EANIonic liquids are hygroscopic materials and can take up significant amounts of water from atmosphere when exposed to air. The protonic nature of PILs is particularly such that most PILs are hygroscopic. Ethylammonium nitrate is a classic PIL, and is also believed to be the very first room-temperature ionic liquid that was reported.32 KF titration measurements show that under our bench top laboratory conditions, the ambient and water equilibrated EAN contains 2.7 wt% water, which after drying in vacuum, can be reduced to <0.01 wt% (100 ppm). Fig. 1a shows that an electrochemical potential window of 3.45 V is obtained with a GC electrode in the “dried” EAN, which is, as expected, larger than that obtained in EAN under bench-top laboratory conditions (3.30 V),31 and also that obtained at a Pt electrode (2.21 V). Fig. 1  (a) Cyclic voltammograms obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a GC electrode in EAN containing 0.1 M Co(NO3)2, 25 °C, 0.3 wt% of water content. (b) The plot of current peaks (Ip) of Co2+ oxidation versus square root of scan rates (v1/2). (c) Chronoamperometric current transients for electrodeposition of cobalt onto a GC electrode in EAN containing 0.05 M Co(NO3)2, 0.3 wt% of water. With the addition of Co2+ into the “dried” EAN, the electro-reduction of Co2+ occurs on the cathodic scan with an onset potential of −0.95 V (vs. Fc0/+), which increases linearly with increasing Co2+ concentration from 10 mM to 100 mM (not shown). A current loop was detected at −0.98 V, indicating the nucleation and growth mechanism of the cobalt deposition.33 Further, scanning potential to more negative values lower than −1.02 V (vs. Fc0/+) after Co2+ reduction, resulted in a dramatic increase of cathodic current, attributed to catalytic hydrogen evolution at the electrodeposited Co metal, similar to that observed in aqueous electrolytes.34On the reverse scan, the anodic peaks observed at −0.14 V (Fig. 1a, o1) and 1.24 V (Fig. 1a, o2) are associated with sequential oxidation of Co metal deposited on the cathodic scan to Co+ and Co2+, respectively. The two peaks are not observed when the cathodic scan is reversed at 0 V, prior to the onset potential of cobalt deposition. At more positive potentials, a quasi reversible process is detected at E1/2 = 1.47 V and is attributed to the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+. This behaviour is distinctly different from that observed in aqueous,18,35 organic,36 aprotic ionic liquids,25–27,37 and deep eutectic solvent media.38 The Co2+ oxidation peak currents (Ip) are found to be linear against the square root of the scan rates (v1/2) (Fig. 1b), implying that the oxidation of Co2+ is diffusion controlled. The diffusion coefficient (D) of Co2+ in EAN is calculated to be 1.60 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 from the slope of Fig. 1b using the Randles–Sevcik equation. This value is larger than that obtained in aprotic ILs such as [C4mim][BF4] (1.80 × 10−8 cm2 s−1) and 1-n-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (1.00 × 10−7 cm2 s−1),27,39 however, significantly smaller than that in aqueous solution (1.10 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, 0.1 M CoCl2).40The cobalt reduction process is further studied by chronoamperometry. A series of current–transient (I–t) is obtained when potentials are stepped from 0 V where Faradaic process is absent, to the more negative potential values ranging from −0.95 V to −1.15 V (Fig. 1c). When the potential is stepped up to a potential that encompasses the deposition of cobalt (≤−0.95 V), current maxima is observed in all current transient (I–t) curves. As the potential stepped into more negative values, the corresponding current maximum occurs more promptly. In all I–t data, the capacitance current predominates at very short times before decaying exponentially. The Faradaic current, which becomes dominant at longer time, increases as the electroactive area increases, due to the growth of independent Co crystals and/or the birth of new crystals.22 After reaching a maximum current value, the transients decrease at different rates and eventually reach the diffusion-controlled region. The different diffusion-limited current values suggest the presence of a parasitic reaction,41 which is attributed to hydrogen evolution reaction in this case. The presence of the hydrogen evolution reaction can in principle decrease the current efficiency of Co deposition. Cobalt has been reported as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution,42 and the electrodeposition of cobalt in acidic aqueous media also is reportedly accompanied by hydrogen evolution at very negative potential values.18Electrochemical behaviour of cobalt in the presence of waterWater is one of most common impurities in ionic liquids. Our recent result show that some “dried” PILs can absorb up to 15.8 wt% of water when exposed to water-saturated nitrogen gas environment.43 The presence of water in an ionic liquid is known to significantly influence physical properties such as viscosity, density, surface tension and hence increase the diffusion coefficients of metal ions. With respect to cobalt ions, aquated cations such as [Co(H2O)x]2+ could also be formed. All of these modifications will inevitably alter the properties of the ionic liquid and the solutes contained therein and subsequently affect the electrodeposition processes. Previous studies also demonstrated that water content can significantly affect the morphology of electrodeposited metals from PILs and charge transfer complexes, silver tetracyanoquinodimethane from aprotic ILs.17,22,31Fig. 2 shows cyclic voltammograms of Co2+ obtained in “wet” EAN. The peak current for cobalt electrodeposition decreases when the water content is gradually increased from 0.30 wt% to 8.20 wt%. Concomitantly, the peak potentials of reduction of cobalt was shifted toward more negative values. This phenomena is ascribed to the formation of bulky cobalt ion complex with water, [Co(H2O)x]2+, which obstructs electron transfer between electrode surface and the Co redox centre leading to an increase of the reduction overpotential. Similar behaviour has been observed in concentrated electrolytes and ionic liquids.22,26 Fig. 2  Influence of water content on the electrochemistry of EAN containing 0.1 M Co(NO3)2, scan rate: 50 mV s−1, 25 °C. The processes on the anodic scan are also significantly influenced by the water content. Fig. 2 shows that by increasing the water content from 0.3 to 8.2 wt%, the reversibility of Co2+/3+ redox couple decreases dramatically. The o1 peak at −0.14 V is observed decreasing with the increase of water content (see the inset in Fig. 2), which is in accordance with the Co deposition peaks on the cathodic scan. The o2 oxidation peak currents increase with water content, and the shape of the oxidation peaks also transforms from broad, diffusion controlled peaks to sharp, surface confined oxidation peaks. The significantly higher oxidation currents are a result of the sequential oxidation of Co metal deposited on the cathodic scan, as well as the water-coordinated Co2+ complex in the solution, to form various phases of cobalt oxides in the presence of water.44 Moreover, the reduction potentials for Co2+ also shift to more negative values in the subsequent scans, indicating the formation of passivating layers on the electrode surface.45Electrodeposition of cobalt/cobalt oxidesBased on the above voltammetric studies, two routes are available for electrodeposition of cobalt oxides in EAN. The first one is through cathodic reduction of Co2+ into Co metal thin film, followed with spontaneous oxidation by atmospheric oxygen into CoO and/or Co2O3.46,47 Controlled potential electrodeposition, that was carried out with a glassy carbon electrode at −0.95 V (vs. Fc0/+) for 150 s in EAN containing 0.1 M Co2+. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the deposition results in a porous thin film of cobalt which consisted of nano-filaments of ca. 40 nm in thickness (Fig. 3a). With prolonged deposition time (300 s), large porous clusters are formed on top of the bottom layer (Fig. 3b). The second approach, is via controlled electrochemical anodic oxidation of electrodeposited Co thin film in ‘wet’ EAN to yield various phases of cobalt oxides. The presence water in EAN is essential to this approach for the formation of metal oxides. Thus, electrodeposition of cobalt oxides was performed on an ITO electrode in the ambient and water equilibrated EAN (2.7 wt% water) containing 0.1 M Co2+ by using cyclic voltammetry in the potential range of −1.20 V to 1.00 V at an scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Five cyclic scans result in a smooth yellowish film on ITO (Fig. 3c). The cobalt film deposited after 20 cycles shows no significant difference in surface morphology (Fig. 3d), except that the film is thicker and darker in colour by visual inspection. Higher scan rates result in thinner and relatively non-uniform films. SEM images show that the deposited cobalt films via both routes appear to be amorphous, which is confirmed by the absence of X-ray diffraction peaks generated by the deposited cobalt oxides (not shown). Amorphous cobalt oxides has been reported in some studies to have higher catalytic activity relative to its crystalline form.48 Fig. 3  SEM micrographs of cobalt deposits on GC obtained via controlled potential deposition at (a) −0.95 V vs. Fc0/+ for 150 s (b) −0.95 V for 300 s; and on ITO via cyclic voltammetry in the potential range of −1.2–1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for (c) 5 and (d) 20 cycles. The EDX analysis confirms that the electrodeposited films on GC and ITO are solely composed of cobalt and oxygen. The XPS was further applied to characterise the chemical compositions of cobalt deposits formed via both routes. Shown in Fig. 4, the XPS spectrum of cobalt deposited on GC electrode through the first route shows characteristic peaks sharpening for Co 2p3/2 spin orbit at 781.7 eV and 787.4 eV as well as for Co 2p1/2 spin orbit characteristic peaks at 797.8 eV and 803.6 eV respectively in the formed film. These peaks are characteristic of CoO,49 suggesting CoO is primarily formed via spontaneous air oxidation. The XPS spectra for the cobalt oxides film on ITO formed via cyclic voltammetry show Co 2p peaks around 780.7 eV and 795.9 eV, which are characteristic of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin orbitals in Co3O4,8,50 suggesting Co3O4 is the primary product upon anodic oxidation of electrodeposited metal. Moreover, the peaks of o1s observed at 530.0 eV and 531.8 eV also fit to the oxygen species in Co3O4 (not shown).50 The above XPS data confirm that the two electrodeposition routes lead to the formation of different forms of cobalt oxide. Fig. 4  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of electrodeposited cobalt oxides on GC plate electrode and ITO-coated glass electrodes, respectively. Electrocatalytic oxidation of water using the electrodeposited cobalt oxidesThe electrocatalytic activity of the electrodeposited cobalt oxides film in water oxidation was characterised by using cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 5a shows the cyclic voltammogram obtained in a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution using a glassy carbon electrode modified with cobalt oxides formed via air oxidation. Water oxidation to oxygen occurs at an onset potential of ∼1.26 V vs. NHE and an overpotential of 0.42 V at current density of 1 mA cm−2, comparable to cobalt phosphate (CoPi) electrocatalyst reported by Kanan and Nocera.8 The electrocatalytic activity of the cobalt oxides film deposited via cyclic voltammetry is also investigated. Fig. 5b shows that electrocatalytic water oxidation occurs at an onset potential of 1.10 V vs. NHE and an overpotential only of 0.32 V is required to reach current density of 1 mA cm−2. These values outperform the CoPi catalyst proposed by Kanan et al.,8 and series of Co3O4 nanoparticles with different sizes by Grzelczak et al.51 at the same current density. The small wave prior to the onset of OER is ascribed to the oxidation of Co species in low valence bands e.g. CoIII to the catalytically active CoIV.51Fig. 5 shows that the cobalt oxides (Co3O4) fabricated via anodic oxidation exhibits higher catalytic activity and lower overpotential for OER than the CoO film prepared through air oxidation. Studies have suggested metal cations in high oxidation states are the active centres for OER catalysts based on oxides of Mn, Ni, and Ir, and Co(IV) centres are required in cobalt oxides to catalyse OER.52–54 The evolution of oxygen is confirmed by using a fluorescent oxygen sensor,8 to monitor the oxygen concentration during the controlled-potential bulk electrolysis of H2O at 1.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0). With the start of electrolysis at 1.20 V, gas evolution is observed at the ITO electrodes and a steady increase of oxygen concentration is also recorded at the oxygen sensor. The oxygen evolution is also accompanied with progressive colour change of the cobalt oxides film from initially yellowish to dark grey by visual inspection, indicative of further oxidation of cobalt oxides. Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) obtained at (a) cobalt oxide modified glassy carbon (black line). (b) Anodic oxidised cobalt on ITO obtained by CV (5 cycles, −1.2 V to 1.0 V). Dashed lines represent the CVs of unmodified substrate. E(NHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V. It has been often observed that electrocatalysts that aid multielectrons reactions (e.g. OER) are prone to structural rearrangement, possible mineral dissolution, oxidative damage and physical stress from the gas evolution which render the catalyst physically unstable.55,56 The stability of cobalt oxides in OER is a long-standing issue, and has been reported to be strongly dependent on the electrolytes and substrate materials.55,57 In this study, the cobalt oxides films anodically deposited onto ITO show moderate long term stability with observation of gradual decrease of the catalytic current in the prolonged electrolysis (>5500 s). Further work is currently under the way to investigate the effect of electrolytes and use nanocarbon materials as substrate to enhance the stability and efficiency.ConclusionsThe electrochemical behaviour of Co2+ has been studied for the first time in protic ionic liquid by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Cobalt exhibits distinctly different voltametric behaviour in the protic ionic liquid, compared to conventional solvents and aprotic ionic liquids, and is found to be strongly water dependent. Two routes have been applied to form cobalt oxides via electrodeposition of cobalt from EAN. Application of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques reveal that the electrodeposited cobalt/cobalt oxide thin films are amorphous and exhibit different morphologies and compositions. The electrodeposited cobalt oxide films formed via both routes exhibit considerable catalytic activity towards electrocatalytic water oxidation. This study demonstrates that PILs are promising “green” electrolytes for electrodeposition of technologically important metal/metal oxides, with advantages such as low cost, low toxicity, high solubilities of metal ions, in comparison to aprotic ionic liquids. The study opens up the opportunities for further exploitation of PILs to fabricate various nanostructures of metal/metal oxides electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to UNSW Mark Wainwright Analytical Center for providing access to their SEM facilities.
