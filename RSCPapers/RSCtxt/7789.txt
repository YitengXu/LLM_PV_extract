    , Accepted 29th April 2016First published on 29th April 2016AbstractA new series of D–A–D-type small-molecule photovoltaic donors are designed and virtually screened before synthesis using time-dependent density functional theory calculations carefully validated against various polymeric and molecular donors. In this series of new design, benzodithiophene is kept as D to achieve the optimum highest-occupied molecular orbital energy level, while thienopyrroledione is initially chosen as A but later replaced by difluorinated benzodiathiazole or its selenide derivative to achieve the optimum band gap. The D–A–D core is end-capped by pyridone units which could not only enhance their self-assembly via hydrogen bonds but also play a role as an acceptor (A′) to form an extended A′–D–A–D–A′ small-molecule donor.
1. Introduction
An organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell made of low-cost light-weight flexible materials has potential to utilize solar energy in various interesting applications. Its power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved (<12%) with the introduction of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture where push–pull (or D–A) conjugated-copolymer donors (absorbing the solar spectrum in the near-IR region of 680–950 nm) form an interpenetrating network with fullerene-derivative acceptors. A narrow bandgap and high charge carrier mobility as well as efficient charge separation and collection are desirable for high-PCE OPV donors and often achieved via morphology control.
Recently, OPV cells with small molecular donors have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their uniform and well-defined molecular structure circumventing batch-to-batch variations in the molecular weight, polydispersity, and purity of polymeric donors.1 More reproducible morphology control and finer energy-level control through chemical-structure modification could be achieved with small-molecule donors.1
They had received little attention due to their extremely low PCE (<1%) when first introduced in 2006,2,3 but the PCE was improved to 6.7% with a D1–A–D2–A–D1 type small-molecule donor DTS(PTTh2)2 in 2012,1 and it was further improved up to 8–9% with continuous optimization of the molecular structure which modifies or replaces each unit to introduce new A–D–A combinations.4,5
In this work, we design a new D–A–D type of small-molecule OPV donors. Since there can be a plethora of possible combinations of D and A units, a virtual pre-synthesis screening would be mandatory for a rational design of small-molecule OPV donors. We have described well the molecular orbital (MO) energy levels, the bandgaps, the UV/Vis absorption spectra, and the PCEs of various D–A polymer donors using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level on their short oligomer (∼2 nm) models.6–10 Contrary to the concern about the accuracy of the B3LYP functional in describing long-range charge transfer, this level of theory has been surprisingly suitable for studying OPV donor polymers. Our interpretation is that the charge transfer involved in OPVs is rather short-range and the polymers are planar only over rather short (∼2 nm) conjugation lengths. Since it could also be owed to a fortunate cancellation between the error from the B3LYP functional in describing long-range charge transfer and the error from the short oligomer model in representing polymers, it would be very interesting to see how well the same level of theory would describe the characteristics of small-molecule OPV donors.
Therefore we first validate our calculation method against the experiments on the best known components of small-molecule OPV cells, the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) acceptor and the DTS(PTTh2)2 donor (0; Fig. 1).1 We then use the same method to predict the (electronic) structure and PCE of new D–A–D-type small-molecule donors (1–4; Fig. 2) comprised of benzodithiophene (BDT; D) and thienopyrroledione (TPD; A) units. The BDT–TPD–BDT core, which mimics the [–BDT–TPD–]n copolymer donors employed in high-PCE (∼8.5%) OPV cells,11,12 is end-capped by self-assembly (SA) units which are expected to form a hydrogen-bonding network. Among the four units considered, pyridone is selected as the electronically best end-capping unit. The PCE of this combination 4, however, is disappointingly low (∼2%) due to the wide band gap, as confirmed experimentally. This is improved up to ∼9% by varying the A unit from TPD to benzodiathiazole (BT) and its derivatives (5–7; Fig. 3).

2. Calculation details
The same type of calculation is carried out as done in our previous studies.6–10 The gas-phase ground-state geometry is fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of DFT13–17 using Jaguar v6.5.18,19 Each component unit (SA, D, and A) is fully optimized, and then each pair of them (SA–D and D–A, that is four different SA–BDT combinations as well as BDT–TPD) is connected at various dihedral angles and fully optimized. All the possible pairing combinations and their dihedral energy curves are shown in Fig. S1 of ESI.† The lowest-energy pair conformers are connected to build the whole molecule 0–7 and are fully optimized. All the alkyl side chains added to increase the solubility are replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculations. The optimized geometries are confirmed to be the true minimum using the normal mode analysis, and the atomic Cartesian coordinates are given in Tables S1–S9 of ESI.† The energy levels of the highest occupied MO (HOMO), EHOMO, are taken from the eigenvalues of the Kohn–Sham equation. In principle, the first ionization potential [IP = E(cation) − E(neutral)] should be more appropriate to compare with experimental EHOMO, which is estimated electrochemically from the oxidation onset potential,20 but inspection of previous studies including ours6 indicates that our approach is rather simple and reliable. At each optimized geometry, the singlet–singlet electronic transition energies are calculated at the same level of theory using TDDFT21–24 in Gaussian09.25 The lowest (S0 → S1) vertical transition energy gives the optical band gap (Eg; eV) which corresponds to the lowest peak maximum λmax (not the onset λonset) in the absorption spectrum (Eg = 1240/λmax; in nm). Our band gap Eg should be compared with literature with care, because the optical band gaps in the literature (ref. 20, for example) are typically much lower values converted from the absorption onset wavelengths λonset. Since most (∼98%) of the lowest-energy (S0 → S1) transition come from the transition from the HOMO to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the lowest TDDFT transition energy can be approximated as the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The LUMO energy level, ELUMO, is estimated by adding EHOMO of DFT and the TDDFT transition energy [ELUMO = EHOMO (DFT) + Eg (TDDFT)]. Since the solvent effect of chloroform (CHCl3) considered with the same implicit solvation model as done in our previous work10 turns out to be marginal (ΔEg < 30 nm or 0.08 eV; see ESI† for details), we use the gas-phase calculations for the following discussion.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Validation: PC61BM and DTS(PTTh2)2
The EHOMO, ELUMO, and Eg values (in eV; Fig. 1) calculated for PC61BM (−6.00, −4.25, and 1.75) and DTS(PTTh2)2 (0; −5.25, −3.67, and 1.59) are in good agreement with those measured electrochemically (CV) or optically (UV/Vis): −5.80, −6.0, −6.10, −6.18, and −6.2 (vs. −6.0); −3.70, −3.80, −3.95, and −4.30 (vs. −4.25); and 1.7, 1.80, 2.00, 2.25, 2.48 (vs. 1.75) for PC61BM26–31 as well as −5.2 (vs. −5.25) and −3.6 (vs. −3.67) and 1.6, 1.72, and 1.89 (vs. 1.59) for 0.1 Our calculation appears to be reliable for predicting EHOMO and the lower end of Eg of small-molecule donors. The agreement shown for polymeric donors in our past studies should be genuine with only a small amount of fortunate error cancellation.
The PCE of a PCBM-based BHJ OPV cell can be estimated from the Eg and ELUMO values of the constituting donor using the Scharber diagram,26,32,33 which has been constructed from the insight that a high PCE comes from a high open-circuit voltage VOC (a driving force for exciton dissociation; ∝ELUMO[acceptor] − EHOMO[donor] − 0.3 eV), a high short-circuit current JSC (∝solar spectrum integrated above Eg[donor]), and a high fill factor FF (fixed at 0.65). A prerequisite for using the Scharber diagram for the PCE prediction is that the hole mobility of the donor should be higher than 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to ensure FF is higher than 0.65.26,32,33 The hole mobility of DTS(PTTh2)2 (0) has been reported1 to be 6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, satisfying the prerequisite. Plugging Eg (1.59 eV) and ELUMO (−3.67 eV) calculated for 0 into the Scharber diagram predicts that 0 would show a PCE of up to 7% (blue dot, Fig. 4), and this indeed agrees with the value of 6.7% measured with morphology control using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additives.1

3.2. Varying SA: 1–4
Now the same type of calculation is carried out on new D–A–D (BDT–TPD–BDT) small-molecule donors which are end-capped with four different SA (pyridinol-derivative) units (1–4, Fig. 2). Only 4 is significantly (25°) twisted around pyridone (low-energy tautomer of pyridinol) termini in its minimum-energy conformation, and all the others (1–3) with pyridinol-derivative termini have a nearly planar (<10°) minimum-energy structure with a significant (6 kcal mol−1) torsion barrier (as shown in the dihedral energy curves between the component units; Fig. S1 in ESI†). The overall planarity of 1–4 would give a high degree of π-conjugation and low Eg. The predicted frontier MO energy diagram of 1–4 (in eV) is shown in Fig. 5. EHOMO is calculated to be −5.33, −5.30, −5.35, and −5.67, Eg to be 2.31, 2.31, 2.32, and 2.34 (equivalently, λmax to be 537, 537, 535, and 530 nm), and thus ELUMO to be −3.02, −2.99, −3.04, and −3.33. EHOMO and ELUMO are significantly (by 0.3 eV) lower for 4 than for the others, but Eg is essentially the same for 1–4 (2.31–2.34 eV). Contrary to their polymer analogues, this series of small-molecule donors have too wide Eg (2.31–2.34 eV corresponding to λmax of 530–537 nm) to absorb the near-IR solar spectrum of 680–950 nm.
 Fig. 5  Predicted frontier MO energy diagram (in eV) of 1–7 which shows several HOMO (black bar) and LUMO (red bar) levels of each compound as well as the lowest-energy (S0 → S1) electronic transition (black dashed vertical arrow; in eV and nm), the oscillator strength (f), and the contribution from the HOMO-to-LUMO transition. 
The Scharber diagram (yellow dots, Fig. 4a) predicts that, among the compounds 1–4 which exhibit essentially the same Eg (2.31–2.34 eV), the compound 4 with the lowest ELUMO (−3.33 eV) would show the highest PCE of up to 4% while the other compounds 1–3 with ELUMO around −3.0 eV would show PCE less than 2.7%, assuming that they would also satisfy the prerequisite for sufficiently high hole mobility for the Scharber-diagram-based PCE prediction.
3.3. Validation experiments with synthetic compound 1
To confirm the predicted MO energy levels and PCE as well as the required hole mobility, we first synthesize compound 1 having a benzyloxy group on the pyridine as the SA unit (BnOPy–BDT–TPD–BDT–PyOBn; synthesis of the other compounds 2–4 has not been realized so far) and fabricate its devices (see the ESI† for experimental details).
The Eg and EHOMO are measured by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 6a shows that the spectroscopic data from the UV/Vis measurement on a thin film of 1 (λmax 555 nm, Eg 2.23 eV, λonset 614 nm, and Eoptg 2.02 eV; black curve) and on 1 in chloroform solution (λmax 505 nm and Eg 2.46 eV; blue curve) are in agreement with the TDDFT calculation (λmax 537 nm and Eg 2.31 eV; red vertical line). Furthermore, Fig. 6b shows that the EHOMO of 1 is estimated to be −5.26 eV (EHOMO = −Eonset − 4.8 eV)34 from the onset oxidation potential (Eonset 0.86 V) measured in the CV experiments, and this agrees well with −5.33 eV from the DFT calculation.
 Fig. 6  Experimental data for 1, PyOBn–BDT–TPD–BDT–PyOBn. (a) UV/Vis spectra in CHCl3 (CF) solution (blue) and thin film (black) shown with the peak maximum position predicted by TDDFT (red), (b) CV curves, (c) J–V curves, and (d) external quantum efficiency spectra taken with and without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additives. 
Then, its inverted solar cells (ITO/ZnO/1:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag) are fabricated with and without morphology control using DIO additives, and their photovoltaic performances are evaluated from the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 6c) to be 0.80 and 0.82 V (VOC), 4.53 and 4.48 mA cm−2 (JSC), 0.46 and 0.44 (FF), and 1.7% and 1.6% (PCE = VOC × JSC × FF), respectively. The large Eg of 1 leads to a narrow external quantum efficiency (EQE) absorption spectrum (Fig. 6d, 300–700 nm rather than 300–800 nm of 0),1 and its disrupted molecular orientation and connection in BHJ domains limit the EQE (Fig. 6d, of up to 35% rather than 68% of 0),1 resulting in relatively low photocurrents JSC.
The hole mobility of 1 measured in organic field effect transistors fabricated on octadecyltrichlorosilane-treated SiO2/Si substrates using Ag source and drain electrodes is 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (much lower than 0.12 of 0),1 resulting in a FF as low as 0.44 (much lower than 0.59 of 0).1 Therefore the maximum PCE measured for 1 (1.7%) is much lower than 6.7% measured for 0.1 It is also significantly lower than 2.7% predicted for 1 (Fig. 4a), most likely because the hole mobility (1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) barely satisfies the prerequisite (>10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the Scharber diagram and the FF (0.44) is still significantly lower than its assumption (0.65) without improvement after adding DIO, in contrast to the substantial improvement achieved for 0 (0.45 to 0.59).1 Considering the difference in the end-capping unit between 0 (long alkyl chain) and 1 (aromatic SA unit), we believe that the morphology of 1 could be further improved either by adding long alkyl chains to the SA units of 1 or by devising a better way (than adding DIO) to induce self-assembly networks via the SA units of 1, so that the experimental hole mobility, FF, and in turn PCE (currently 1.7%) would be further improved approaching the upper limit of PCE (2.7%) predicted by intrinsic electronic structure calculations (which could be adjusted by simulations of BHV morphology and charge transfer/transport hopefully in near future).
3.4. Varying A: 5–7
In fact, not only 1 but also the whole series 1–4 are predicted to have low PCEs (2.5–4%) due to their consistently wide Eg (∼2.3 eV). The Eg of this series is controlled by the D–A–D core rather than the SA unit (see the four yellow dots vertically aligning in Fig. 4a whose x-axis denotes Eg). This is explained by the relative positions of EHOMO (pink) and ELUMO (green) of the pyridone (SA), BDT (D), and TPD (A) component units shown in Fig. 7 (three columns on the left). The highest EHOMO and the lowest ELUMO among them would determine the EHOMO and the ELUMO of their composites, respectively. Therefore, the EHOMO and ELUMO of 1–4 are determined mostly by the EHOMO of the D unit (BDT) and the ELUMO of the A unit (TPD), respectively, while the SA unit makes only an inductive effect to shift up and down the EHOMO and ELUMO together (see again the four yellow dots vertically distributing in Fig. 4a whose y-axis shows ELUMO). Therefore, enhancing the PCE by reducing Eg could be difficult if we keep the BDT–TPD–BDT core.
 Fig. 7  Frontier MO energy diagrams (HOMO in pink and LUMO in green) of the SA (fixed as pyridone), D (fixed as BDT), and A (varied from TDP to BT and its derivatives) component units for 4–7 donors. 
Instead, since EHOMO of 4 (−5.67 eV) is sufficiently low, we decide to modify 4 in a direction to lower the ELUMO (and accordingly Eg) while keeping the EHOMO intact, that is to follow up the white line starting from the yellow dot of 4 in Fig. 6. This would be realized by altering the A unit,35,36 while keeping the D unit as BDT and the SA unit as pyridone. On the basis of ELUMO compared in Fig. 7 (four columns on the right), we choose three A units having lower ELUMO than TPD to virtually build a new series of small-molecule donors where the A unit of 4 (TPD) is replaced by benzothiadiazole (BT; 5), 5,6-difluoro-BT (DFBT; 6), and 5,6-difluorobenzoselenadiazole (DFBSe; 7) (Fig. 3).
The frontier MO distributions and energy diagram (in eV) of 5–7 are shown in Fig. 3 and 5. Indeed, we see in Fig. 3 that the HOMO and LUMO of 5–7 are distributed on the D and A units, respectively, and in Fig. 5 that the low EHOMO of 4 (−5.67) is kept intact in 5 (−5.62), 6 (−5.67), and 7 (−5.61) while ELUMO is significantly lower in 5 (−3.63), 6 (−3.77), and 7 (−3.85) than in 4 (−3.33). Accordingly, Eg is narrower in 5 (1.99), 6 (1.91), and 7 (1.76) than in 4 (2.34), and equivalently λmax (in nm) is longer in 5 (622), 6 (651), and 7 (705) than in 4 (530). This new series 5–7, particularly 6–7, would be able to absorb the near-IR region (680–950 nm) of the solar spectrum. Indeed, the Scharber diagram predicts that the PCBM-based BHJ OPV cells made of 5–7 (red dots, Fig. 4b) would show significantly higher PCEs than those made of 1–4 [1–3 (2.7%) ≪ 4 (4%) ≪ 5 (6.5%) < 6 (7.8%) < 7 (9%)] under the condition that they would show high hole mobility (>10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and FF (∼0.65). The dihedral energy curves calculated for 5–7 (not shown) indicate that the nearly planar conformation of 1–4 would be kept in 5–7 having the minimum-energy dihedral angle of less than 10°, thus the intermolecular π–π stacking favorable for structural organization and morphology control would be still eligible in this new series. We thus propose 5–7 as electronically promising candidates to be used as a small-molecule donor in PCBM-based BHJ OPV cells, although their synthesis has not been successful so far and a new strategy still needs to be developed to improve their morphology. If such issues in synthesis, morphology, and BHJ-electrode contact could be successfully solved, they have a potential to reach 6–9% of PCE.
4. Conclusions
Our DFT/TDDFT (B3LYP/6-311G**) calculations on both molecular and polymeric OPV donors reproduce well their frontier MO energy levels observed in experiments. Among newly-proposed D–A–D-type small-molecule donors 1–4 end-capped by different SA units, 4 end-capped by pyridone units is predicted to have the highest PCE (4% ideally) owing to its relatively low HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Further enhancement of PCE (to 6–9% ideally) is achieved with 5–7, which are rationally-designed from 4 by altering the A unit in the direction of lowering the band gap and the LUMO energy level while keeping the HOMO energy level. Synthesis of promising candidates would be highly interesting and is currently in progress.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Calculated (black mark) and measured (blue and red bars) EHOMO and ELUMO of PCBM and DTS(PTTh2)2 (0). See text in Section 3.1 for the references.	 

 	Fig. 2  D–A–D small-molecule donors 1–4 where BDT–TPD–BDT is end-capped by different SA units. 4 (pyridone) is a lower-energy tautomer of 3 (pyridinol). Alkyl side chains are replaced by methyl groups. Color code: black (H), gray (C), blue (N), red (O), and yellow (S).	 

 	Fig. 3  Small-molecule donors 5–7 with BDT (D), pyridone (SA), and various A units (top) and their HOMO (middle) and LUMO (bottom). Color code: black (H); gray (C); blue (N); red (O); turquoise (F); yellow (S); wine (Se); and green/pink (positive/negative MO phase).	 

 	Fig. 4  Scharber diagram to estimate the PCE (in %) for 0 (blue), 1–4 (yellow) and 5–7 (red), which is adapted from the work of Scharber and coworkers26,32 with permission from Wiley-VCH.	 

 	Fig. 5  Predicted frontier MO energy diagram (in eV) of 1–7 which shows several HOMO (black bar) and LUMO (red bar) levels of each compound as well as the lowest-energy (S0 → S1) electronic transition (black dashed vertical arrow; in eV and nm), the oscillator strength (f), and the contribution from the HOMO-to-LUMO transition.	 

 	Fig. 6  Experimental data for 1, PyOBn–BDT–TPD–BDT–PyOBn. (a) UV/Vis spectra in CHCl3 (CF) solution (blue) and thin film (black) shown with the peak maximum position predicted by TDDFT (red), (b) CV curves, (c) J–V curves, and (d) external quantum efficiency spectra taken with and without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additives.	 

 	Fig. 7  Frontier MO energy diagrams (HOMO in pink and LUMO in green) of the SA (fixed as pyridone), D (fixed as BDT), and A (varied from TDP to BT and its derivatives) component units for 4–7 donors.
