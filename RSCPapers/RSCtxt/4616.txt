    , Accepted 1st September 2022First published on 3rd September 2022AbstractAdditive engineering is an effective strategy for defect passivation and performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, few additives have achieved outstanding stability with high efficiency by simultaneously passivating deep and shallow defects. Herein, we design a novel ionic silicone polymer (PECL) with multi-active sites as an additive to modify inverted PSCs. The C–O groups in the PECL polymer can chelate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters to passivate deep defects; and the ionic groups in the PECL polymer can generate electrostatic interaction with both positively and negatively charged vacancies, which help to repair shallow defects. Moreover, we quantitatively reveal the effect of deep and shallow defects on the efficiency and stability of PSCs separately, by establishing the correlation between additives with different functional groups and the performance of devices. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency of the PECL-modified inverted PSC increases from 20.02% to 23.11%. More importantly, the encapsulated PSCs maintain 95% of their initial steady-state power output after 1500 hours under AM 1.5 illumination at the maximum power point at 45 °C. Therefore, we provide a universal guideline of polymer structure design for defect healing in stabilizing PSCs with high efficiency.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received extensive attention due to their outstanding photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) and low production cost. However, poor operational stability seriously hinders the further development of perovskite photovoltaics. Although various effective additive strategies have been reported to enhance the device performance, they do not achieve operational stability at high efficiency. In this context, we propose the simultaneous passivation strategy via a novel ionic silicone polymer, which passivates the deep defects by the chemical coordination between ether bonds and undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters, while the ionic groups generate electrostatic interaction to repair the charged vacancies. The strategy achieves high PCE and excellent stability of the device. Our work provides a new method to achieve high-performance PSCs for accelerating the commercialization of PSCs.

1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received extensive attention due to their high absorption coefficient,1 long carrier diffusion length,2,3 adjustable band gap,4 and simple preparation process.5,6 Normal (n–i–p) PSCs have power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 25%,7,8 and the PCEs of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs have reached 25%.9 However, there are inevitably numerous defects in the polycrystalline perovskite films due to the rapid crystallization and high-temperature annealing processes, which cause the deterioration of the devices.10–12 Deep defects in the perovskites, such as undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters, attract much attention from the community. According to previous reports, they mainly act as non-radiative recombination centers, which trap electrons or holes during charge carrier migration and thus reduce the device performance.13,14 Shallow defects are often neglected by researchers due to the negligible effect on the efficiency. Recent studies show that shallow vacancy defects, such as I vacancies and FA/MA vacancies, can severely deteriorate the stability of PSCs by causing phase separation and ion migration.15–17 However, a general and puzzling problem is how to understand the difference in the impact of deep defects and shallow defects on the device efficiency and stability.18 Here, we quantitatively reveal the effect of deep and shallow defects on the efficiency and stability of PSCs separately, by establishing the correlation between additives with different functional groups and the performance of devices.
Additive engineering is proved to be one of the most effective and prevailing ways to passivate defects and improve the stability of PSCs.19–21 Researchers have proposed a variety of additives for passivation, including small molecules,22–24 ammonium salts,25–27 and ionic liquids.28–30 The effective functional groups of these additives contain elements such as oxygen,31,32 nitrogen,33–35 sulfur,36 and phosphorus,37–40 which act as Lewis bases to interact with undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters. It is reported that alkaline chloride passivates the deep and shallow defects simultaneously through doping the alkaline metal ion K+ and halogen ion Cl− into the electron transport layer/perovskite interface. However, it is difficult for them to achieve sufficiently stable devices due to the diffusivity and hydrophilicity of alkaline chloride. Recently, some polymers with excellent thermal stability and hydrophobicity have been demonstrated as efficient additives for improving the device performance.41–43 Unfortunately, most polymer additives can only passivate deep defects due to the single functional group and poor designability. Thus, developing multi-active-site polymer additives to realize the simultaneous passivation of deep and shallow defects is imperative for the development of high-performance PSCs.
Here, we innovatively design and synthesize a novel ionic silicone polymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(dimethyl siloxane)-poly(ethylene glycol)-chloride (PECL), to modify the active layer of PSCs (Fig. 1a). The PECL polymer is a block copolymer with the ionic silicone in the center segment and polyethylene glycol at both ends, which endows it with excellent thermal stability and good solubility in solvent. The long-chain structure of polymer PECL achieves cross-linking between grains and passivates grain boundaries (GBs). The C–O groups enable chelation with undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters to passivate deep defects. In addition to the C–O groups, ionic groups are introduced into the polymer with the aim to repair the shallow vacancies, including FA/MA vacancies and I vacancies. Thanks to the simultaneous passivation effect, the champion PCE increases from 20.02% (control) to 23.11% (PECL) and the encapsulated device achieves superior operational stability, maintaining 95% of its initial performance after 1500 hours under AM 1.5 illumination and the maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 45 °C. Finally, we thoroughly summarize the effects of shallow and deep defects on the performance of PSCs for the first time. This work shows that repairing shallow vacancies and passivating deep defects in the perovskites simultaneously is an effective strategy for achieving PSCs with long-term stability and high efficiency.

2. Results and discussion
We synthesize the ionic silicone polymer PECL through a two-step reaction, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The chemical structure of the polymer is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Fig. S2a, ESI†) spectroscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, Fig. S3, ESI†). In addition, we measure the molecular weight of the polymer via gel permeation chromatography (GPC), shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). These results confirm the successful synthesis of the ionic block copolymer. To prove the advantages of the PECL polymer in passivating the deep and shallow defects, we also choose butyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (BTMC) and block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(dimethyl siloxane)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEDE) for comparison (Fig. 1a). The novel polymer additive PECL was incorporated into the perovskite film via the chlorobenzene antisolvent.

Fig. 1b depicts the schematic of the interaction between PECL and CsMAFA-based perovskites (MACH3NH3+; FACH(NH2)2+), which is studied using FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and theoretical modeling. First, the C–O groups of the PECL polymer chelation with undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb cluster is characterized. The stretching vibration peaks of the C–O groups in the PEDE and PECL film shift from 1093 cm−1 to a lower wave number in the PEDE-PbI2 film and the PECL-PbI2 film, shown in Fig. 1c,44 which indicates the Lewis acid–base interaction between the C–O groups and Pb2+. In contrast, the peaks of quaternary ammonium group N(–CH3)3+ and C–N stretching vibration in the BTMC-PbI2 film do not shift compared with that of the pure BTMC film (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†), revealing the absence of interaction between BTMC and Pb2+. The interaction has been further investigated using XPS spectra (Fig. 1d and Fig. S5, ESI†). When compared to those of the control film, the Pb 4f peaks of the BTMC-modified perovskite do not shift obviously, whereas the Pb 4f peaks of the PEDE- and PECL-modified perovskite films shift to lower binding energies due to the Lewis acid–base interaction.24 In addition, the Pb 4f XPS in the control film shows two additional peaks at 136.5 eV and 141.3 eV, which relate to the metallic Pb clusters.45,46 The reason for the occurrence of metallic lead clusters (Pb0) is that uncoordinated lead in perovskites is decomposed into lead iodide, and lead iodide is further decomposed into Pb0 due to light and X-ray irradiation. The Pb0 peaks still exist in the perovskite modified with BTMC. In contrast, the peaks of PEDE- and PECL-modified films disappear, indicating that the C–O groups of PEDE and PECL can interact with uncoordinated lead, which prevents the decomposition of perovskite and the formation of lead iodide, thereby inhibiting the appearance of Pb0.47
The interaction between the ionic groups in the polymer and vacancies (i.e., halide anion (I) vacancies and FA/MA vacancies) in the perovskite has been investigated via electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis, shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).48 Cl− in the ionic groups distributed in the red region indicates the highest electron density. The electron-deficient regions are mainly distributed to N(–CH3)3+ of the ionic groups, which could possibly compensate the vacancies of the FA/MA in the perovskite. To thoroughly investigate the passivation effect of the ionic groups, we have built the perovskite model and ionic group modified perovskite to calculate the formation energy of vacancies, shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Considering FAPbI3 as the dominant component in the CsMAFA-based perovskite, we choose FAPbI3 as the research object instead of the mixed composition perovskite to simplify the calculation. Details of the computational procedure are shown in the Supplementary Note 1, ESI.† When ΔΔEvac turns out to be a positive value, it indicates that the formation of vacancies is suppressed effectively. After modification with ionic groups, the formation energy of I vacancies increases by 1.50 eV and the FA vacancies formation energy increases by 1.34 eV compared with the pristine perovskite (Fig. 1e). Therefore, the presence of ionic groups significantly prevents the formation of I and FA vacancies in the perovskite.
We use temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy (AS) to analyze the energy distribution of defects in the PSCs with and without molecular modification (Supplementary Note 2, ESI†).49–51Fig. 1f, g and Fig. S8 (ESI†) show the capacitance spectra of control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified PSCs measured at different temperatures, respectively. We observe that the capacitance of the PECL-modified device increases obviously with temperature in the low-frequency region compared with that of the control device, revealing that more and deeper defects participate in the transitions as the frequency decreases. Furthermore, we calculate the slope via plotting ln(ω0/T2) and 1/T for obtaining the defect activation energy (Ea) of PSCs, which roughly corresponds to the depth of the defect energy level (Fig. 1h). The BTMC-modified device shows a trap energy level at 0.432 eV, which is shallower than that of the control device (0.457 eV), revealing that BTMC mainly eliminates some shallow defects. Therefore, the defect energy level is still in a deep position. In contrast, the PEDE-modified device has a trap energy level at 0.316 eV, indicating that PEDE mainly passivates deep defects and shallows the trap energy level immensely. Interestingly, the PECL-modified device shows the lowest trap energy level (0.286 eV), indicating that PECL passivates deep defects and repairs shallow defects simultaneously.
To deeply understand the passivation mechanism of PECL, we conduct density functional theory (DFT) calculation via the Vienna ab initio simulation package code (Fig. S9, ESI†). Three typical defect sites are constructed, including the Pb cluster defect, FA vacancy defect, and I vacancy defect (Fig. S10, ESI†). In addition, we divide the PECL polymer into two sections (the ionic groups and the C–O groups) according to the type of the functional groups. Fig. 2a and b depict the structural relaxation models based on the FAPbI3 cell containing FA vacancies modified by the ionic groups (Fig. 2a) or C–O groups (Fig. 2b). We clearly observe that N(–CH3)3+ in the ionic groups fills in the FA vacancy due to electrostatic interaction while there is no interaction between FA vacancy and C–O groups. Fig. 2c shows the corresponding density of states (DOS). It is worth mentioning that, since the lattice of the perovskite shrinks when the FA cation is missing,14 the bandgap of FAPbI3 with FA vacancy increases slightly compared with that of pristine FAPbI3. After the introduction of ionic groups, N(–CH3)3+ achieves the component compensation, resulting in a similar bandgap and band-edge state to those of the pristine perovskite. When we use the C–O groups to modify the perovskite, a rather insignificant shift in the valence band maxima (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) takes place compared with that in the FAPbI3 cells containing FA vacancy. The results reveal that compared with the C–O groups, N(–CH3)3+ shows a stronger ability to passivate the shallow defects, resulting in the movement of bandgap and the same band-edge state as that of pristine FAPbI3.

(i) DOS of FAPbI3 containing a Pb cluster defect, ionic group modulated FAPbI3 and C–O group modulated FAPbI3. 
We further evaluate the influence of the ionic groups or C–O groups on I vacancy defect. When the ionic groups are used to treat I vacancy defect, we observe that the anion Cl− takes up the I vacancy (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the C–O groups are only adsorbed on the perovskite surface (Fig. 2e). As shown in Fig. 2f, the I vacancy defects introduce localized shallow state defects at the CBM of the perovskite. The band-edge state of ionic group modulated FAPbI3 changes significantly due to the interaction between the Cl− and the I vacancy. The interaction causes a new hybrid state, bridging the CBM and shallow trap states.45 So, the shallow defects are repaired by the ionic groups through electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, the shallow defects of the C–O group modulated FAPbI3 still exist, which is similar to the FAPbI3 containing an I vacancy defect. Furthermore, we also compare the influence of the ionic groups (Fig. 2g) or C–O groups (Fig. 2h) on Pb cluster defect. We observe that undercoordinated Pb2+ is bonded with C–O groups while there is no interaction between undercoordinated Pb2+ and ionic groups. Fig. 2i shows the corresponding DOS. The FAPbI3 cell containing the Pb cluster defect exhibits the trap state at the deep-level between the VBM and CBM. The introduction of ionic groups does not obviously affect the strap state, which disappeared after the introduction of C–O groups, revealing that the C–O groups can passivate deep defects more effectively than the ionic groups. Therefore, the PECL polymer passivates both the deep defects and shallow defects via coordination passivation and vacancy repair.
The effect of additives on the morphological properties of perovskite films is investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The top-view SEM images and the distribution statistics of grain sizes are shown in Fig. 3a–d and Fig. S11 (ESI†). We observe that the PEDE-modified and PECL-modified perovskite films show larger grains than control and BTMC-modified films, which is probably because the interaction between the C–O groups and Pb2+ may influence the crystal nucleation and crystallization kinetics of perovskites.52 Moreover, the cross-sectional SEM images show the vertical arrangement of dense grains and reduced GBs in the PECL-modified perovskite film compared with the other perovskite films, shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Therefore, we conclude that the additive PECL with multi-active sites acts as a more efficient crystallization accelerant.

(k) Time-resolved photoluminescence decay of control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified perovskite films. 
The cross-linking between PECL polymer and perovskite grains is confirmed further using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 3e, the internal region shows the good crystal structure, with an interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (002) plane of the CsMAFA crystal. Furthermore, we observe that the amorphous polymers exist in GBs of the perovskite and constitute the cross-linking structure, which efficiently immobilizes perovskite grains (Fig. S13, ESI†). As a comparison, the pristine perovskite film is crystalline, and no amorphous polymer is found in the GBs, shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). The cross-sectional energy-dispersive X-ray (TEM-EDX) mapping is further utilized to locate the PECL polymer. Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows that the characteristic element Cl of PECL is present in the whole perovskite film. We use time-resolved UV-vis absorption spectroscopy to in situ study the perovskite crystal kinetics during the spin-coating process. Fig. 3f and g show the color mapping of the UV-vis absorption spectra as a function of the spinning process for control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified perovskites. The control film and BTMC-modified film exhibit three processes: solution process (<12 s), intermediate process (≈12–30 s), and solid process (>30 s), while the PEDE- and PECL-modified films show an extended intermediate region. In order to compare the crystallization rate of the perovskite films more clearly, we plot the absorption intensity as a function of spin-coating time at a wavelength of 550 nm.53 As shown in Fig. 3h, the BTMC-modified perovskite film shows a similar slope (0.040) to that of the control film (0.042), revealing that the repair of shallow defects via the BTMC has a limited effect on the crystallization kinetics of perovskites. In contrast, the crystal growth is retarded in PEDE (0.036) and PECL (0.033) incorporated perovskites due to the coordination bonds between Pb2+ and C–O groups. The enhanced crystallinity is confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 3i). The absence of an additional diffraction peak in the additive-modified films indicates that additives are not embedded into the perovskite lattices. Furthermore, the PEDE- and PECL-modified films exhibit increased (002) peak intensity but decreased PbI2 peak intensity in the XRD pattern, indicating enhanced crystallinity. The (002) peak of the BTMC-modified perovskite film has a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) that is comparable to that of the pristine perovskite film, while the FWHM of the PEDE- and PECL-modified films becomes narrower compared with the pristine sample, shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The results reveal that due to the abundant chemical anchor sites on the PEDE and PECL polymer, the strong interaction between C–O and Pb2+ regulates the morphology and thus improves the quality of the perovskite film.
We study the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite film with or without additions, shown in Fig. 3j to understand the discrepancy in the optical characteristics of perovskite films after annealing. The absorption intensity of the BTMC-modified perovskite film is similar to that of the control film, while the PEDE- and PECL-modified perovskite films show enhanced optical absorption, which is explained by the enlarged grain size and increased crystallinity. The results match well with the SEM and XRD results. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite films is directly related to the deep defect induced non-radiative recombination.54 The PL intensity of the BTMC-modified perovskite film is close to that of the pristine perovskite film, shown in Fig. 3j, while the PL intensity of the PEDE- and PECL-modified perovskite films is much stronger, further confirming that the non-radiative recombination is mainly suppressed by the passivation of deep defects rather than shallow defects. In addition, we use time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to investigate the charge transport and recombination kinetics. The curve is fitted by the model, shown in the Supplementary Note 3, ESI.† As shown in Fig. 3k and Table S1 (ESI†), the fast decay times τ1 are 3.30 ns (control), 4.21 ns (BTMC-modified), 7.64 ns (PEDE-modified) and 8.03 ns (PECL-modified). A longer carrier lifetime means a lower recombination probability.55 Furthermore, τ2 values are 235.40 ns (control), 261.88 ns (BTMC-modified), 278.26 ns (PEDE-modified), and 304.38 ns (PECL-modified), which can be attributed to the larger grain sizes and higher crystallinity. Due to the synergistic effect of defect passivation and grain cross-linking, the PECL-modified perovskite film shows the longest carrier lifetime.
Next, we have fabricated inverted PSCs with the structure of Glass/ITO/NiOx (20 nm)/FAMACs with or without additives (800 nm)/PCBM+C60 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Cr (5 nm)/Au (100 nm), as shown in Fig. 4a. PCBM is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, and BCP is bathocuproine. The J–V characterization of the additive-modified devices are shown in Fig. 4b and the details are given in Table 1. The PCE of the control device is 20.02%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short circuit density (JSC) of 22.51 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.15% measured in the reverse scan at 0.1 V s−1 scan rate. The champion PCEs of the BTMC- and PEDE-modified devices reach 20.68% and 22.21%, respectively. The maximum PCE of the PECL-modified device has increased to 23.11%, accompanied by a VOC of 1.15 V, a JSC of 23.98 mA cm−2, and an FF of 83.79%. The optimized J–V curves with different additive ratios are shown in Fig. S17–S19 and Table S2–S4 (ESI†). The integrated JSC values are 21.60, 21.90, 22.45, and 23.05 mA cm−2 for the control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified devices via external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, shown in Fig. 4c, which exhibit a <4% mismatch compared to that of the JSC values from the J–V curves. Fig. 4d and Fig. S20 (ESI†) indicate the narrow distribution of photovoltaic parameters, confirming the excellent reproducibility of the PECL-modified PSCs. The steady-state power output (SPO) of PSCs under MPP is shown in Fig. S21 (ESI†). The device with PECL maintains the value of JSC and PCE at a constant, while the BTMC- and BETE-modified devices show a slight decay and the control device attenuates obviously, suggesting the high reliability of the PECL-modified device performance. Meanwhile, the PECL-modified device exhibits negligible hysteresis, and the detailed parameters are presented in Fig. S22 and Table S5 (ESI†). We further incorporate the PECL polymer into all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbI2Br) via the antisolvent method. The PECL-modified devices also exhibit an increased PCE (Fig. S23 and Table S6, ESI†), demonstrating that incorporating the ionic silicone polymer into the perovskite is a universal method. Additionally, we add the polymer PECL directly into the perovskite precursor solution; the PECL-modified device obtains an improved PCE and high FF (Fig. S24 and Table S7, ESI†).

We understand the influence of PECL on device efficiency by evaluating photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, and FF). As shown in Fig. S25 (ESI†), the energy gap between the Fermi level (EF) and CBM of the additive-modified perovskite films is narrower compared with the control film, indicating the enhanced n-type character of the additive-modified films, which helps to improve the VOC.56 In addition, the increase in photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) indicates that the nonradiative losses of additive-modified perovskite films are suppressed effectively, resulting in an increased VOC (Fig. S26, ESI†). The ideal factor (nid) values of the BTMC- and PEDE-modified devices are 1.42 and 1.28 compared with the nid of control devices (1.47), shown in Fig. 4e and Supplementary Note 4 (ESI†), indicating that passivating deep defects are more effective in suppressing non-radiative recombination. Due to the synergistic passivation, the PECL-modified device exhibits the lowest nid of 1.23. The increment of JSC for the additive-modified device is attributed to the high-quality perovskite films with improved optical absorption (Fig. 3j) and reduced trap density via space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurement (Fig. S27, ESI†). Furthermore, we measure the dark current curve to explain the improvement in FF, shown in Fig. 4f and Table 2. Compared with the control device, the value of series resistance (Rs) for the additive-modified devices decreases, revealing the more efficient extraction and transfer of the carrier, and matches well with the decreased charge transport resistance (Rct) and increased recombination resistance (Rrec) of the additive-modified PSCs (Fig. S28 and Table S8, ESI†) in the electrical impedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the value of shunt resistance (Rsh) increases gradually due to the improved quality of the perovskite film. Therefore, the decreased Rs and increased Rsh resulted in the increased FF of additive-modified PSCs.57

We monitor the PCE evolution of nonencapsulated PSCs at 85 °C in a N2 atmosphere to evaluate the thermal stability of PECL-modified devices (Fig. 5a). After 1008 hours, the normalized PCE of the control device barely retains 42% of its initial value. The devices with additives have lower attenuation, which maintains approximately 83% (BTMC-modified) and 71% (PEDE-modified), and 92% (PECL-modified) of their original PCEs, respectively. The BTMC-modified device shows better thermal stability compared with PEDE-modified device, indicating that the shallow defects are more pronounced than deep defects in affecting the device stability. We measure the operational stability of the encapsulated PSCs under MPP tracking at 45 °C to investigate the influence of deep defects and shallow defects on the stability of PSCs. Fig. 5b shows that the normalized SPO of control device decays rapidly and only retains 48% of its initial value after 700 hours, whereas the BTMC- and PEDE-modified devices maintain 85% and 69% of their initial SPOs after 1500 hours, respectively. Remarkably, the PECL-modified device maintains 95% of its initial SPO after 1500 hours of ageing under the same conditions.

(c) tDOS based on the control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified devices after aging at 85 °C and full-spectrum sunlight for 500 hours. The various colors represent trap bands with varying trap energy depths: shallow trap states (blue, 0.35 to 0.40 eV) and deep trap states (red, >0.4 eV). (d) The tDOS changing trend of additive-modified devices after aging based on the control device. The ΔNT can be extracted from the relation: ΔNT = ((NT (additive) − NT (control))/NT (control)) × 100%. (e) The synergistic influence on efficiency and stability of BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified PSCs. The efficiency growth rate can be extracted from the relation: ΔPCE = ((PCE (additive) − PCE (control))/PCE (control)) × 100%. The stability retention rate is the normalized SPO at 750 hours under maximum power point tracking based on the control devices. ΔSPO = ((SPO (additive) − SPO (control))/SPO (control)) × 100%. 
We further measure the trap density of states (tDOS) of devices after aging for 500 hours at 85 °C and full-spectrum sunlight, shown in Fig. 5c. The built-in potential (Vbi) values are derived from the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S29, ESI†). In comparison to the BTMC-modified devices, the tDOS of PEDE-modified devices increases dramatically, indicating that repairing shallow defects might be more effective in inhibiting device degrading than passivating deep defects. More importantly, we observe that PECL-modified devices exhibit the lowest defect density among the devices. In addition, we calculate the change rate of tDOS (ΔNT), shown in Fig. 5d. The ΔNT value of the BTMC-modified device is close to that of the PEDE-modified device in the deep defect region, while in the shallow defect region, the ΔNT value of the BTMC-modified device is significantly higher than that of the PEDE-modified device, indicating that the BTMC-modified device is more stable than the PEDE-modified device. Moreover, the ΔNT value of the PECL-modified device still maintains the maximum value with negligible decrease and almost no change at all. The results show that the simultaneous passivation of deep and shallow defects is significant for achieving inverted PSCs with low defect density and high stability.
Finally, we unprecedentedly summarize the effects of shallow and deep defects on the performance of PSCs. The PCE enhancement (ΔPCE) of BTMC- and PEDE-modified devices is 3.3% and 10.9% based on the control device, respectively, shown in Fig. 5e, revealing that the deep defects have a greater impact on device efficiency compared with the shallow defects. Regarding the effects of different defects on device stability, the BTMC-modified device maintains 75.1% ΔSPO while the PEDE-modified device maintains only 44.9% ΔSPO, indicating that the shallow defects have more direct influence on the stability of the device. We observe that PECL-modified device has both higher ΔPCE (15.4%) and stability (99.2% ΔSPO), confirming that simultaneous passivation of the deep and shallow defects plays a significant role in achieving superior operational stability with high efficiency.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesize a novel ionic silicone polymer PECL as an additive for high-performance inverted PSCs. The coordination interaction between the C–O groups and the undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters enables the passivation of the deep defects, while the shallow defects are repaired via the electrostatic interaction between the charged vacancy and the ionic groups, simultaneously. Furthermore, the continuous GB passivation and high-efficiency grain cross-linking are achieved by the block copolymer PECL. As a result, the champion PCE of the inverted device with PECL reaches 23.11%. More critically, following 1500 hours of MPP tracking at 45 °C, the encapsulated PSCs maintain 95% SPO; and the nonencapsulated PSCs maintain 92% PCE after 1008 hours at 85 °C. Our results rationalize the general and puzzling problem that the device efficiency is mainly affected by the deep defects while the stability is mainly affected by the shallow defects, and provide a design guideline for achieving superiorly stable PSCs with high efficiency via ionic silicone polymer additives.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received extensive attention due to their outstanding photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) and low production cost. However, poor operational stability seriously hinders the further development of perovskite photovoltaics. Although various effective additive strategies have been reported to enhance the device performance, they do not achieve operational stability at high efficiency. In this context, we propose the simultaneous passivation strategy via a novel ionic silicone polymer, which passivates the deep defects by the chemical coordination between ether bonds and undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters, while the ionic groups generate electrostatic interaction to repair the charged vacancies. The strategy achieves high PCE and excellent stability of the device. Our work provides a new method to achieve high-performance PSCs for accelerating the commercialization of PSCs.

 	Fig. 5  (a) Normalized PCE evolution of non-encapsulated control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified devices under a N2 atmosphere at 85 °C. (b) Normalized SPO of encapsulated control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified devices under MPP tracking at 45 °C in the air. (c) tDOS based on the control, BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified devices after aging at 85 °C and full-spectrum sunlight for 500 hours. The various colors represent trap bands with varying trap energy depths: shallow trap states (blue, 0.35 to 0.40 eV) and deep trap states (red, >0.4 eV). (d) The tDOS changing trend of additive-modified devices after aging based on the control device. The ΔNT can be extracted from the relation: ΔNT = ((NT (additive) − NT (control))/NT (control)) × 100%. (e) The synergistic influence on efficiency and stability of BTMC-, PEDE-, and PECL-modified PSCs. The efficiency growth rate can be extracted from the relation: ΔPCE = ((PCE (additive) − PCE (control))/PCE (control)) × 100%. The stability retention rate is the normalized SPO at 750 hours under maximum power point tracking based on the control devices. ΔSPO = ((SPO (additive) − SPO (control))/SPO (control)) × 100%.
