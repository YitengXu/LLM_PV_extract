    , Accepted 23rd December 2018First published on 24th December 2018AbstractThe development of polysulfide reduction electrocatalysts with abundant active sites, high conductivity and good stability is vital to the fabrication of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) but is challenging. Herein, we report a convenient approach for the synthesis of Cu nanoparticle@carbon nanorod (Cu@CNR) composites by the direct pyrolysis of HKUST-1 precursors at temperatures above 1000 °C. The Cu@CNR composite whose carbon nanorods (CNRs) are encased with Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs) exhibits superior catalytic activity towards polysulfide reduction in QDSCs, which might be ascribed to the abundant CuxS active sites derived from Cu NPs and the excellent charge transfer capability of graphitized CNRs. Benefiting from the encasement in CNRs, the dissociation of CuxS from counter electrodes (CEs) is effectively suppressed. When Cu@CNR composites deposited on F-doped tin oxide glass were used as CEs, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50% (Jsc = 26.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.628 V, and FF = 0.573) under one sun illumination was observed with Zn–Cu–In–Se QD sensitizers and polysulfide electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are one of the promising candidates for new generation solar cells due to low-cost solution processability and the potential application in power portable electronics.1–5 In QDSCs, the catalysts for counter electrodes (CEs), responsible for transferring electrons from an external circuit to electrolytes by catalytic reduction of polysulfide species affect substantially the photovoltaic performance of the cells.6–8 Up to now, copper sulphides with outstanding catalytic activity toward polysulfide reduction are most commonly used as CE catalysts.9–13 However, copper sulfides deposited on FTO or brass substrates may dissociate gradually from CEs, poisoning photoanodes and consequently deteriorating photovoltaic performance.14–18 Recently, many efforts have been devoted to the development of alternative CE catalysts derived from carbonaceous materials.19–25 Still, the catalytic activity of most reported carbon catalysts in QDSCs is far from satisfactory. Nevertheless, the introduction of special carbons, especially carbon nanorods (CNRs)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs), provides a possible approach for the immobilization of copper sulphides, by which the catalytic activity and stability of CEs are supposed to be guaranteed. The embedment of Cu NPs within CNRs therefore is vital to accomplish the strategy mentioned above since Cu NPs immersed in polysulfide electrolyte may readily be converted to copper sulphides.
The pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is an effective way for the preparation of metal@CNT composites.26,27 During pyrolysis, metal ions regularly arranged in the 3-dimensional framework of MOFs could be converted directly to metal NPs without the additional introduction of metal precursors.28 Many metal@CNT composites have been synthesized by direct carbonization of MOFs in the literature.28–32 Typically, Xia et al. synthesized N-doped CNTs with Co NPs at the tip of CNTs by the pyrolysis of Co based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the ORR and OER.28 Meng et al. synthesized a series of CNTs with a high yield from various MOF precursors by low temperature pyrolysis at 430 °C.29 Crystalline metal NPs were found to be encapsulated at the top of CNTs. The presence of the catalytic metals such as Co and Ni was suggested to play an essential role in the formation of tube-like carbon.30–32 It is noteworthy that the composites reported all share a similar morphology in which only a very small quantity of metal NPs is encased at the tip of CNTs. Up to now, no Cu@CNT composites have been synthesized by direct pyrolysis of MOFs with Cu as a metal center since Cu is commonly considered to be inactive for the growth of CNTs. To achieve a versatile catalytic activity of MOF-derived Cu NP/CNR composites in QDSCs, the abundance of Cu NPs therefore is expected.
Herein, rod-like carbon encased with Cu NPs of 10–35 nm (Cu@CNR composites) was synthesized for the first time by direct pyrolysis of Cu-based MOF precursors (HKUST-1) and utilized further as a CE electrocatalyst for the construction of QDSCs. The CEs with Cu@CNR composites deposited on FTO substrates (Cu@CNR/FTO CEs) exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity to traditional Cu2S/FTO CEs. The dissociation of copper sulfides encapsulated in CNRs from CEs was found to be efficiently suppressed, favourable to the stability of cell devices. With Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QD sensitizers and polysulfide electrolyte, the Cu@CNR composite based QDSCs show an extraordinary average PCE of 9.43% (Jsc = 26.40 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.626 V, and FF = 0.570) under one sun illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity, which is the highest efficiency reported in QDSCs based on FTO-based CEs.
2. Results and discussion
The synthetic method for Cu@carbon composites is illustrated in Fig. 1, and its detailed description can be found at the end of the article. Firstly, blue HKUST-1 powders whose XRD patterns are illustrated in Fig. 3 were synthesized based on the literature method.33 Then, four dark-purplish-red Cu@carbon composites, denoted as Cu@C-x (x = 800, 900, 950, 1000 and 1100), were obtained by the pyrolysis of the HKUST-1 precursors at the temperatures of 800, 900, 950, 1000 or 1100 °C for 5 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The morphology and microstructure of Cu@C-x characterized by SEM and TEM are illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3. As shown in Fig. 2, all the Cu@C-x composites obtained maintain the original octahedral shape of the HKUST-1 precursors. It is interesting that a small number of rods with the diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nm appear on the surface of Cu@C-1000 (Fig. 2c) and the quantity of the nanorods increases drastically on the surface of Cu@C-1100 (Fig. 2d). By a partial enlarged view, it was found that a large number of nanoparticles are encased in these nanorods (Fig. 2e and f). To reveal the internal structure of Cu@C-x, SEM characterization was further conducted on crushed octahedral geometry. As shown in Fig. S1,† the interior of both Cu@C-1000 and Cu@C-1100 is filled entirely with the same nanorods. By contrast, Cu@C-800 and Cu@C-900 are just carbon matrices in the absence of nanorods inside the samples.

By the drastic change in morphology between Cu@C-900 and Cu@C-1000, the sample denoted as Cu@C-950 was prepared by the carbonization of the HKUST-1 precursor at 950 °C. According to the SEM images of Cu@C-950 (Fig. S2†), an octahedral shape similar to those of Cu@C-x composites obtained at other temperatures was observed. Meanwhile, a small number of carbon nanorods were found to be embedded in the carbon matrix, indicating that Cu@C-950 is a transition from Cu@C-900 without carbon nanorods to Cu@C-1000 consisting of carbon nanorods.
The TEM images of Cu@C-1000 and Cu@C-1100 (Fig. 3a and S3a†) clearly show that abundant Cu NPs with the diameter ranging from 10 to 35 nm are encased in nanorods several μm in length. The corresponding polycrystalline dotted rings of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED, inset of Fig. 3a) pattern can be well indexed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of metallic Cu. A lattice fringe space of 0.208 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic Cu, can also be observed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, inset of Fig. 3b and S3b†). The presence of Cu NPs is further confirmed by the XRD patterns as illustrated in Fig. 3c and S4.† The peaks at the 2θ values of 43.4 and 50.5° can be assigned to the (111) and (200) planes of metallic Cu, respectively. Meanwhile, a very weak peak appearing at 35.5° should be related to the (111) plane of CuO because of the slight oxidation of Cu NPs exposed to air. Nevertheless, the characteristic peak of crystalline carbon could not be found in the XRD pattern, which might be described to the poor long range order induced by the few layers and a small amount of graphitic carbon in the composites. To further reveal the presence of graphitized carbon, the Cu nanoparticles (NPs) in composites were etched by dispersing the Cu@C-1000 sample in aqua regia with ultrasonic treatment for 5 minutes, followed by standing for a night. As can be observed from the XRD pattern shown in Fig. S5,† a peak at 2θ = 26.3° appears which should be related to the (002) plane of the graphitized carbon. The presence of CuCl diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.5° and 47.4° is attributed to the chemical reaction between aqua regia and Cu NPs. Besides, a lattice fringe space of approximate 0.34 nm in the HRTEM image of Cu@C-1000 (Fig. 3b), corresponding to the (002) plane of graphitic carbons, was observed, indicating the presence of graphitized carbon by the pyrolysis of HKUST-1 above 1000 °C. The crystalline nature of carbon materials is further confirmed by a low ID/IG value in Raman spectra shown in Fig. 3d. By contrast, the higher ID/IG values for Cu@C-800 and Cu@C-900 indicate that the carbon formed at pyrolysis temperature below 900 °C is mainly in the amorphous form.34,35
Following the “tip-growth” mechanism, various metal@CNT composites have been synthesized by the direct carbonization of MOFs containing specific catalytically active metal centers, like Co and Ni.36,37 In most cases, a small quantity of composites in which metal NPs encapsulated at the tip of CNTs could be observed only on the outer surface of polyhedral architectures.28,29,32 It is generally acknowledged that Cu shows no catalytic activity for the growth of CNTs since the binding strength between Cu and carbon is not sufficient to support the dangling bonds of a growing CNT.38,39 As a result, the preparation of rod- or tube-like carbons by the direct pyrolysis of Cu based MOFs has not been reported. Recently, with the introduction of catalytically active metal salt guests into HKUST-1 precursors, CNTs encased with a small amount of Cu NPs were synthesized by pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 600 to 800 °C.40 The direct pyrolysis of untreated MOF precursors under the same conditions results in amorphous polyhedral carbons whose microstructure is similar to that of Cu@C-800 and Cu@C-900 obtained in this work. The formation of tube-like carbons was ascribed to the synergetic contribution of Cu combined with catalytically active metals such as Mo and W.40
Without introducing additional catalytically active metals, CNRs were obtained in this work by the direct pyrolysis of HKUST-1 at high temperatures. On the one hand, CNRs formed appear in great numbers, densely distributed inside octahedral geometry. On the other hand, a larger number of Cu NPs are closely encased within CNRs. As reported in the literature, carbon might dissolve in a Cu solid solution at a high enough temperature.41–43 It can be deduced that, at pyrolysis temperature above 950 °C, carbon atoms dissolve into Cu NPs, precipitating subsequently to form a graphitic structure adjacent to the Cu NPs.
To examine the catalytic activity of Cu@C-x composites prepared for polysulfide reduction, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was conducted on Cu@C-x/FTO CE fabricated by the deposition of Cu@C-x composites on FTO substrates. Typically, two identical CEs were used to form a virtual cell unit and a certain amount of polysulfide electrolyte was then injected into the gap between the CEs. The Nyquist plots illustrated in Fig. 4a show two semicircles. The first semicircle in the high frequency region can be assigned to the resistance (R1) between FTO and Cu@C-x composites. The arch in the low frequency region reflects the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the composites and polysulfide electrolyte. The first intercept of the Nyquist plots with the real axis represents series resistance (Rs).44–46 The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S6† was applied to fit the EIS results, with the detailed parameters listed in Table S1.† It was found that all four CEs have a similar Rs value, which could be attributed to the deposition of composites on the same FTO substrates. Obviously, the Cu@C-1000/FTO and Cu@C-1100/FTO CEs exhibit lower Rct values than those of Cu@C-800/FTO, Cu@C-900/FTO, Cu@C-950/FTO and the commonly used Cu2S/FTO CEs, demonstrating the superior charge transfer capability of rod-like carbon composites from composites to the electrolyte.

The outstanding catalytic activity of the Cu@CNR composites especially Cu@C-1000 for polysulfide reduction can also be verified from the Tafel polarization curve illustrated in Fig. 4b. Exchange current density (J0), determined by the intersection of anodic and cathodic branches at equilibrium potential (V = 0), varies in the order of Cu@C-1000/FTO > Cu@C-1100/FTO > Cu@C-950/FTO > Cu2S/FTO > Cu@C-900/FTO > Cu@C-800/FTO. The higher the exchange current density (J0), the more active the catalytic activity of catalysts.47–50 Consequently, the catalytic activity of CEs follows the same order mentioned above. The results agree with the conclusion obtained from EIS data, in accordance with the relationship of J0 = RT/nFRct (R, T, F and n mean the gas constant, temperature, Faraday constant and the number of electrons involved in the reaction, respectively).
To further study the electrocatalytic activity of the four CEs toward the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.51 As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the CV curves of Cu@C-1000/FTO and Cu@C-1100/FTO show remarkably higher cathodic reduction peak current values than those of Cu@C-800/FTO, Cu@C-900/FTO, Cu@C-950/FTO and Cu2S/FTO CEs. Both the peak positions and current densities of the Cu@C-1000/FTO and Cu@C-1100/FTO CEs change slightly over 50 cycles of CV scans (Fig. S7 and S8†), but those of Cu@C-800/FTO, Cu@C-900/FTO and Cu2S/FTO CEs change substantially. Such a phenomenon further confirms the superior catalytic activity and stability of Cu@C-1000 and Cu@C-1100 with Cu NPs encased in CNRs. Their outstanding catalytic activity should be ascribed to the abundant active sites provided by CuxS as well as CNRs and the excellent charge transfer capability of graphitic CNRs. Cu@C-1100 and Cu@C-1000 are similar in morphology. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity of the former is lower than that of the latter, which might be ascribed to the lower specific surface area of Cu@C-1100 (Fig. S9 and Table S2†). A low specific surface area limits the penetration of the electrolyte and the exposure of active sites to the polysulfide, thus affecting the catalytic reduction of the polysulfide.

With the combination of a ZCISe QD sensitized TiO2 photoanode and commonly used polysulfide electrolyte, “sandwich-type” QDSCs based on Cu@C-x CEs were constructed. The short-current density (J)–photovoltage (V) curves of the cell devices under one full sun illumination are shown in Fig. 5b, with the detailed parameters listed in Table 1. At increasing calcination temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, no obvious change in the Voc values of the corresponding QDSCs could be observed. In the meantime, the values of Jsc and FF increase from 25.09 to 26.40 mA cm−2 and from 0.509 to 0.570, respectively. As a result, the PCE values of the cells increase from 7.88% to 9.43%. With the further increase in calcination temperature to 1100 °C, the values of Jsc and FF decrease to 26.31 mA cm−2 and 0.552, respectively. Without the evident change of Voc, the PCE decreases to 9.05%, accordingly. It can be concluded that rod-like carbon based QDSC devices (Cu@C-1000 and Cu@C-1100) show superior photovoltaic performance to both octahedral carbon matrices (Cu@C-800 and Cu@C-900) and the commonly used Cu2S based devices. Among them, Cu@C-1000 based QDSC devices exhibit an optimal photovoltaic performance with a champion PCE of 9.50% (Jsc = 26.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.628 V and FF = 0.573).

Copper sulfides are ultimate active components for polysulfide reduction in QDSCs, so the penetration of polysulfide electrolyte through the rod-like carbon of Cu@C-x composites becomes the prerequisite for the formation of copper sulfides. By this consideration, Cu@C-x impregnated in aqueous polysulfide electrolyte followed by alcohol washing and drying was characterized. The XRD pattern (Fig. S10†) of vulcanized composites shows sharp diffraction peaks at the 2θ values of 29.4, 38.8 and 14.3°, which could be assigned to the (102), (105) and (410) planes of CuS, respectively. The peaks at 2θ of 32.1 and 46.1° derive from the (200) plane of Cu1.3S and the (019) plane of Cu1.81S. Besides, there are two weak peaks at 2θ of 43.3 and 50.4°, corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of metallic Cu, respectively. That is to say, the majority of Cu NPs are converted to copper sulfides (CuS, Cu1.3S and Cu1.81S) by reacting with polysulfide electrolyte. The final vulcanized composite is denoted as CuxS@C-x. The TEM image of CuxS@C-1000 as a representative shows that CuxS@CNR-1000 with CuxS NPs embedded in CNRs maintains the original morphology of Cu@C-1000 (Fig. 6). The corresponding EDS mapping images clearly depict that both Cu and S are evenly distributed in the interior of CNRs (Fig. 6), indicating that polysulfide electrolyte penetrates readily into CNRs and react with Cu NPs.
 Fig. 6  (a) TEM image of CuxS@CNR-1000 and (b) EDS elemental mapping of CuxS@CNR-1000. 
To verify the suppression of the CuxS sloughing from CEs, CuxS@C-x/FTO electrodes prepared were immersed into an aqueous solution for 3 days. The content of Cu in the aqueous solution was then measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), with the data listed in Table S3.† The content of Cu in the solution soaked CuxS@CNR-1000/FTO and CuxS@CNR-1100/FTO is found to be around 0.7 mg L−1, approximately 1/4 that of the solution soaked CuxS@C-800/FTO and CuxS@C-900/FTO. The strategy of encapsulation of CuxS in CNRs therefore may effectively prevent the dissociation of CuxS from CEs, facilitating further the stability of the devices constructed.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a series of Cu@C-x materials were prepared by pyrolysis of a single precursor HKUST-1 at increasing temperature from 800 to 1100 °C. Amorphous carbons with an octahedral structure were produced at temperatures below 900 °C, while rod-like carbons encased with abundant Cu NPs were obtained at temperatures above 950 °C. Based on the electrocatalytic test on Cu@C-x/FTO electrodes constructed, the Cu@C-1000 and Cu@C-1100 composites were found to present a superior electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte, which might be ascribed to the abundant CuxS active sites derived from Cu NPs and excellent charge transfer capability of graphitic CNRs. What is more, the dissociation of the ultimate active components of CuxS from CEs is effectively suppressed by the embedment of CuxS in CNRs. With ZCISe QD sensitizers and modified polysulfide electrolyte, the Cu@C-1000/FTO based QDSC devices exhibit a champion PCE of 9.50% (Jsc = 26.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.628 V, and FF = 0.573) under one sun illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest PCE among the reported deceives based on carbonaceous catalysts supported on FTO substrates.

Cupric nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, ≥99%), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, 99.99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), and diphenylphosphine (DPP, 98%) were purchased from J&K. Selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), and oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%) were bought from Aldrich.
Synthesis of HKUST-1 powders
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (32.3 mM, 0.126 g) and H3BTC (18.4 mM, 0.063 g) were dissolved in DMF (16 mL) under stirring, which was subsequently transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After reacting at 85 °C for 20 h, light blue powders (HKUST-1) were collected and washed repeatedly with ethanol followed by drying in air at room temperature.
Calcination of HKUST-1 powders
500 mg of HKUST-1 powders in alumina crucible was placed in the center of a flow-through quartz tube sitting in tube furnaces. The furnaces were heated at 5 °C min−1 to the target temperature (800, 900, 1000, and 1100 °C) under 200 mL min−1 of pure nitrogen, and the samples were maintained at the target temperature for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final products were collected from the quartz tube and labeled Cu@C-x (x = 800, 900, 1000, 1100).
Synthesis of CuxS@C-x
80 mg of Cu@C-x (x = 800, 900, 1000, 1100) powders were ground for 5 min in a mortar, and were uniformly dispersed in an aqueous solution of electrolyte by the ultrasonic method for 1 min, and the final carbonaceous materials denoted as CuxS@C-x were obtained through alcohol washing and drying.
Acid treatment procedure of Cu@C-1000
80 mg of Cu@C-1000 was dispersed in 4 mL of aqua regia with ultrasonic treatment for 5 min. After standing overnight, the sample was washed with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at a temperature of 90 °C for 12 h.
Fabrication of Cu@C-x/FTO counter electrodes.
Various CEs were prepared as follows: 100 mg of Cu@C-x (x = 800, 900, 1000, 1100) powders were ground for 5 min in a mortar, into which 100 μL of pale yellow adhesives (prepared by mixing 0.2 g of ethyl cellulose with 8 mL of terpineol and 500 μL of titanium isopropoxide) was added. The mixture was ground for 0.5 h until there were no tiny particles. Products appeared as dark-purplish-red paste. Finally, Cu@C-x dark-purplish-red paste was coated on cleaned FTO glass via screen printing technology, followed by calcination in an argon atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of Cu2S/FTO counter electrodes
Typically, Cu/FTO was first obtained by electrodepositing a Cu film on electrical tape circled FTO glass via multipotential-step technology with an electrochemical station. The electrochemical station (CH1660D, Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Co., Ltd., China) is equipped with a three electrode electrolytic cell (a phosphorus copper foil and a saturated calomel electrode as counter and reference electrodes).52 The area of the Cu film on FTO is consistent with that of Cu@C-x on FTO. The electrolyte for Cu electrodeposition was prepared by dissolving H2SO4 (5.0 mM) and CuSO4 (9.0 mM) in deionized water. The multipotential-step technique was performed with 1000 cycles for 80 min, during which each cycle includes a first step at −2.0 V for 0.2 s and a second step at 0 V for 0.4 s. After electrodeposition, the Cu/FTO obtained was finally sulfurized by immersing in polysulfide methanol solution (1.0 M Na2S, 1.0 M S and 0.1 M KCl) for 60 s, producing the commonly used Cu2S@FTO CE.
Synthesis of water-soluble Zn–Cu–In–Se QDs
ZCISe QDs were synthesized following our reported method.53 Typically, Zn precursors were obtained by dissolving 0.22 g of Zn(OAc)2 in a mixture of 1 mL of OAm and 9 mL of ODE at 130 °C, and Se precursors were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of 42.5 mg of Se powder in a mixture of 0.4 mL of DPP and 0.5 mL of OAm. 0.6 mL of the as-prepared Zn precursors, 59.5 mg of In(OAc)3 and 28.0 mg of CuI were first loaded into a three-necked flask containing 3 mL of ODE and 4 mL of OAm. The system was then heated to 190 °C under a N2 atmosphere followed by rapid injection of the Se precursors obtained. After maintaining at 200 °C for 5 min, oil-soluble ZCISe QDs capped with OAm were obtained. To effectively deposit QDs on a TiO2 film, the initial oil-soluble ZCISe QDs were converted to water-soluble using mercaptopropionic acid as bifunctional ligands via the ligand exchange method.
Assembling of the cell devices
To prepare the photoanode, a 20 μm transparent layer and 5 μm light scattering layer of TiO2 films were successively coated on cleaned FTO glass via screen printing. Following calcining at 450 °C, 45 μL of water-soluble ZCISe QDs were dropped on the mesoporous TiO2 film and maintained for 2 h at 50 °C. The QD sensitized TiO2 films were then dipped into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min successively.54–56 After repeating 6 times, the photoanode was obtained. Gel polysulfide electrolyte was prepared by mixing 6 wt% carboxymethylcellulose sodium with 10 g polysulfide electrolyte including 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S and 0.2 M KCl in aqueous solution, following our previously reported method.57 The QDSC devices with a sandwich structure were assembled by associating the ZCISe sensitized photoanode, gel polysulfide electrolyte and carbon based CEs prepared.
Characterization
The phase and crystal structures of the products were determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which were recorded with a Rigaku Mini 600 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The morphology and structure of the product were observed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai F20). N2 adsorption was measured by using a BET instrument using a surface area analyzer (NOVA touch LX3 ASAP 2020, USA).
Photovoltaic performance characterization
The J–V curves of the solar cells were obtained by using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter, the Oriel model no. 91160 could generate a standard sunlight (AM 1.5) as the solar simulator, and the glowing intensity was calibrated to 1000 W cm−2 with the adoption of a NREL standard Si solar cell. The photoactive area was 0.235 cm2 calibrated with a metal mask. The instrument for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was a Zahner Zennium, which has a bias voltage of −0.55 V and an amplitude of 10 mV with scan frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. The Tafel polarization spectrum was measured at a scanning frequency of 50 mV s−1 with an edge potential from −800 mV to 800 mV, and the current range from −2.5 A to 2.5 A. The two CEs were symmetrically composed of a dummy solar cell device with a sandwich structure and used to measure EIS and Tafel. With a Pt wire used as the auxiliary electrode and a SCE electrode as a reference electrode, the studied counter electrode was used as a working electrode with a total exposure area of 0.36 cm2, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a gel solution containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M S, with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1.
