    , Accepted 26th February 2018First published on 27th February 2018AbstractNitrogen-doped graphene frameworks (N-GFs) with a large specific surface area (1149 m2 g−1) are successfully synthesized from fumaric acid in the presence of sodium carbonate with urea added as nitrogen precursor through a facile one-step fast pyrolysis. The N-GFs can be utilized as an excellent counter electrode in hole transport material (HTM)-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs), achieving the power conversion efficiency of 10.32%, higher than the PSCs using undoped graphene frameworks. The enhanced performance of N-GF-based PSCs is probably due to the superiority of N-GFs in enabling increased charge extraction efficiency and transportation to substantially reduce charge recombination losses. This work indicates the great potential of N-GFs to replace expensive organic HTM and noble-metal electrodes in developing low-cost and efficient HTM-free PSCs.
1. Introduction
Inorganic–organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are attracting great attention due to the vast improvements in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the past few years.1–6 A typical PSC configuration includes mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3, perovskite absorbers, hole transport material (HTM), and noble metal counter electrode.4,7 However, the most commonly used HTM layer, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), is exorbitantly expensive and limits the long-term stability of the PSCs.8–14 Furthermore, the noble metal (Au or Ag) counter electrode used is costly and requires the highly energy-consuming vacuum evaporation deposition.10,13,15,16 These aforementioned issues may limit PSCs’ commercialization process to a certain extent. Intriguingly, perovskite light- harvesting materials possess ambipolar semiconductor characteristics for charge transport and can thus enable PSCs to work even without HTM.3,4,13 In this context, carbon materials have emerged as a promising candidate because of their abundance, low cost, easy preparation, suitable Fermi level, and excellent environmental stability.10,13 Given these unique attributes, during the past few years, considerable efforts have been devoted to investigate different kinds of carbonaceous materials such as graphite, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, and graphene as the substitute for expensive HTM and the noble metal electrode to construct low-cost, HTM-free PSCs, making great progress with reliable efficiency and enhanced stability.10,13,15–33 To date, PCE values of carbon-based, HTM-free PSCs have been obtained from the initial value of 6.64%33 to the highest value of 15.6%.30 For example, Chumanov et al.27 reported the use of a graphite/carbon black counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs, obtaining a PCE of 10.2%. Duan et al.28 applied the ultrathin graphite carbon electrode for HTM-free PSCs and achieved a PCE of 14.07%, higher than that obtained with the bulk graphite-based electrode of 12.63%. Recently, Rong et al.30 developed PSCs based on carbon electrode using high-quality perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, presenting a high PCE of 15.6% and with long stabilization in ambient air. Despite the great progress that has been made, it is worth increasing the PCE of PSCs by improving the conductivity and surface chemical properties of the carbon electrode material.
Studies have revealed that the introduction of nitrogen (N) heteroatoms into carbon materials can modulate electrons to provide desirable electronic structures and chemical characteristics.34,35 N-Doped carbon materials have better electron-transfer ability and electrocatalytic activity because of the additional lone pair electrons of nitrogen atoms and the resulting local strains in a hexagonal carbon network.34–36 In fact, N-doped carbon materials are also widely used as counter electrodes or catalyzers to remarkably enhance electron transport and electrocatalytic activity and thus improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells,36 lithium batteries,37 and fuel cells38 compared with pristine carbon materials. However, to our best knowledge, the possibility of using N-doped carbon materials as counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs has not been explored. Furthermore, in terms of electrode structure design, the carbon electrode composition of charge transport material with good connectivity should enhance charge extraction. Meanwhile, graphene frameworks (GFs) are attracting extensive research attention because of their unique advantages, such as high electrical conductivity, interconnected framework structure, quasi-isotropic electron conduction, and satisfactorily large specific surface area.39,40 GFs can be synthesized via the rapid decomposition of fumaric acid particles in the presence of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), as in our recent report.41
Based on this, in the present study, using fumaric acid (FA) and Na2CO3 as raw materials and by adding a nitrogen precursor (urea), we successfully synthesize high specific surface area GFs (1149 m2 g−1) by using real-time nitrogen doping through a facile one-step fast pyrolysis. We then applied the N-doped GFs (N-GFs) as counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs and achieve the PCE of 10.32%, higher than PSCs with GFs as counter electrode. The enhanced performance is mainly due to the increased charge-extraction efficiency and transportation ability, which reduce charge-recombination losses. This work demonstrates that N-GFs can be used as an effective counter electrode to develop low-cost PSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods

Synthesis of N-GFs. 
In a typical synthesis, quantitative amounts of FA and Na2CO3 were mixed evenly, then different amounts of urea (FA/Na2CO3/urea molar ratios = 1:4:0.125; 1:4:0.25; and 1:4:0.5) were added. Subsequently, 2 g of the mixture was placed in a small ceramic boat, which was placed in a quartz tube reactor at 1000 °C to enable the fast pyrolysis of materials under a flow of argon atmosphere. After reaction of 2 min, the formed N-doped black solids were fully washed with deionized water to remove Na2CO3 and dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum conditions to obtain N-GFs. For comparison, GFs were synthesized by fast pyrolysis of FA and Na2CO341 under the same conditions as N-GFs.


Solar cell preparation. 
Preparation of TiO2 substrate. 
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (14 ohm per square, Nippon Glass Sheet) were laser etched to obtain the required pattern. Then, the FTO substrates were ultrasonically washed sequentially with detergent solution, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol, then dried with clean air stream, and finally, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The preparation of photoelectrode was according to the reported methods.2,42 Typically, the TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2) was deposited on the FTO by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 20 s with 150 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution diluted in ethanol, then heating at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the FTO substrates were immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the mesoporous TiO2 layer (mp-TiO2) was spin coated with a commercial TiO2 paste (18NR-T, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol (weight ratio = 1:3.5) at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and the TiO2 film was dried for 5 min at 100 °C and sintered afterward for 30 min at 550 °C.
Synthesis of CH3NH3I42. 
CH3NH3I was synthetized by reacting 27.86 mL of CH3NH2 (40 wt% methanol) and 10 mL of HI (57 wt% in water) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask in an ice bath, with stirring for 2 h. After reaction, the precipitate was obtained via rotary evaporation at 50 °C to remove the solvents. The product was re-dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized from diethyl ether three times. Finally, the CH3NH3I product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h.
Preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 layer42. 
PbI2 was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 462 mg mL−1 and stirred at 70 °C. The mesoporous TiO2 film was pre-heated to 70 °C and then spin coated with the PbI2 solution at 3000 and 6000 rpm for 10 s and 5 s, respectively, annealed at 40 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 5 min, and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, 8 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I solution in 2-propanol was loaded on the PbI2 film for 20 s, spin coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min to form the CH3NH3PbI3 layer.
Preparation of PSCs based on N-GF counter electrode42,43. 
First, the TiO2/PbI2 film was prepared according to the above-mentioned method. Subsequently, 15 mg of N-GFs were dispersed in 2 mL of 2-propanol with ultrasonication for 15 min, added with 8 mg of CH3NH3I, and fully stirred to form an even N-GF and CH3NH3I reactive paste. Finally, the reactive paste of N-GFs intercalated CH3NH3I was drop-casted on the TiO2/PbI2 film and heated at 100 °C for 5 min to obtain the final FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/N-GF PSC devices. For comparison, the PSC-based GF counter electrodes were also prepared under identical conditions.
All the reagents were analytical grade and used as received.

2.2 Characterization
The morphologies of N-GFs, GFs, and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-7001F, operated at 10 kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100F, operated at 200 kV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM; NanoScope IV) were further used to characterize the N-GFs. Raman spectrum was obtained using a LABRAM-HR laser Raman spectrometer. X-ray diffraction measurement was conducted on an X-ray powder diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance). The elemental composition of samples was determined using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system (AXIS ULTRA DLD) with an Al Kα X-ray source. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were analyzed with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 at 77.4 K. UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra measurements were obtained using the SHIMADZU UV-3600 spectrophotometer and Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the electronic and atomic structures of the sample surface using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
Photocurrent density voltage (J–V) curves were obtained with a 2400 source meter (Keithley Instruments Inc., USA) and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel, 91192) providing light with AM 1.5G spectrum distribution. The incident photon-conversion efficiency (IPCE) of PSCs was measured within the wavelength range of 400–800 nm on a Crown instrument. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on the electrochemical workstation IM6ex (ZAHNER) with applied potential bias from 500 mV to 900 mV and a frequency range of 100 kHz to 100 mHz in the dark.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the SEM image of the products derived from a certain amount of fumaric acid (FA) and Na2CO3 mixtures, without urea and with different amounts of urea as nitrogen source through one-step fast pyrolysis. The SEM images (Fig. 1b and c) of the obtained solid products from the mixture of FA, Na2CO3, and urea (molar ratios = 1:4:0.125 and 1:4:0.25, respectively) exhibit good network structure, similar to that of graphene frameworks (GFs) prepared from FA and Na2CO3 mixtures without nitrogen source (Fig. 1a).41 However, with increased urea proportion (FA/Na2CO3/urea molar ratio = 1:4:0.5), the obtained solid products do not form a good network structure but have irregular lamellae (Fig. 1d), which may be due to the increased urea content that caused a large amount of gas release during the fast pyrolysis, leading to the incomplete network structure.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the obtained products prepared by fast pyrolysis at 1000 °C of (a) FA and Na2CO3 (molar ratio = 1:4), and with different ratios of urea (b) 0.125, (c) 0.25, and (d) 0.5, respectively. 
The XPS data of the products synthesized from FA and Na2CO3 with urea (molar ratios = 1:4:0.125 and 1:4:0.25, respectively) and without urea are shown in Fig. 2a. Using FA and Na2CO3 as raw materials with added nitrogen precursor (urea), the products appeared with a nitrogen peak signal at approximately 400 eV,44 indicating that urea as nitrogen source can successfully accomplish the in situ doping of nitrogen atoms in the framework-structured products. The element contents of the above three framework-structured products are shown in Table 1. When the molar ratios of FA, Na2CO3, and urea are 1:4:0.125 and 1:4:0.25, the nitrogen content (atomic ratio) of the products are 1.45% and 3.05%, respectively. These results confirm that an appropriate amount of urea as nitrogen source can synthesize the framework-structured products by real-time nitrogen doping through one-step fast pyrolysis. However, when the urea content is small (FA/Na2CO3/urea molar ratio = 1:4:0.125), the nitrogen element content of the framework structure product is low. Accordingly, we use the products (i.e., N-GFs) with FA/Na2CO3/urea molar ratio of 1:4:0.25 for subsequent study. Meanwhile, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of N-GFs (Fig. 2b) exhibits three peaks centered at 398.9, 400.1, and 401.8 eV, which are associated with the pyridine-, pyrrole-, and graphite-like nitrogen configurations,44,45 and the pyrrole nitrogen configurations predominate in the N-GFs.

Fig. 3a shows the TEM image of N-GFs, which are found to consist of thin two-dimensional graphene sheets. The high-resolution TEM image (inset of Fig. 3a) indicates that N-GFs comprise a few layers of graphene. The AFM image also displays the thickness of N-GFs (approximately 2.3 nm) and further illustrates that N-GFs are composed of a few layers of graphene, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Raman spectrum of N-GFs is depicted in Fig. 3c. Three distinct peaks at approximately 1356, 1590, and 2750 cm−1 for N-GFs are observed and label as D band, G band, and 2D band, respectively, implying the formation of graphitic carbon.46

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of N-GFs is 1149 m2 g−1, which is significantly close to that of GFs (1093 m2 g−1), is calculated from N2 absorption/desorption measurements (Fig. 4a). Pore distribution (Fig. 4b) clearly shows that N-GFs have a highly continuous and abundant 3D network pore structure ranging from micropores to macropores, similar to that of GFs, which is an important factor affecting the performance of electrode materials.39,40 The results indicate that N-GFs with high specific surface area can be synthesized with urea as nitrogen source through one-step fast pyrolysis and are expected to be utilized as excellent electrode materials.

To evaluate the potential function of N-GFs, HTM-free PSCs are fabricated with N-GFs as counter electrode and CH3NH3PbI3 as light absorber. The PSC device configuration and the typical cross-sectional SEM image of a complete PSC based on N-GF counter electrode are illustrated in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 5b and c, CH3NH3PbI3 fills the mesoporous TiO2 layer (350 nm). A CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer also formed, and the connection among CH3NH3PbI3 grains are good, thereby effectively reducing the grain boundary and enhancing the light-absorption and charge-collection efficiency.19,43 Otherwise, N-GFs conformably cover the perovskite photoanode because of the interfacial wet chemical reaction assembly and still retain a good network structure conducive to charge transport, as clearly observed in Fig. 5b, d and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The X-ray diffraction pattern of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/N-GFs is displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The obvious diffraction peaks at approximately 14.21°, 24.49°, 28.46° and 31.89° correspond to the lattice planes of (110), (111), (200) and (210),2,47 indicating that the mixed reaction slurry of N-GFs and CH3NH3I can in situ transform PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and simultaneously deposit the N-GF counter electrode, creating an interpenetrating interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 and N-GF electrode with minimal charge recombination.19,43 The UV-vis absorption spectra of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/N-GFs (Fig. S3, ESI†) illustrate the good light-absorption range of 400 nm to 750 nm and further imply the generation of CH3NH3PbI3.43

The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on N-GF counter electrode is measured using a light illumination of standard global AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2), and PSCs based on the GFs are also fabricated under conditions identical to that of N-GFs for comparison. The typical photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs are presented in Fig. 6a, and the relevant performance parameters derived from the J–V curves are listed in Table 2. The N-GF-based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.32% together with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.02 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 59.25%. Meanwhile, PSCs with the GFs display a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 18.69 mA cm−2, FF of 55.89%, and a PCE of 8.98%. Obviously, the PSCs based on N-GFs perform better than those based on GFs mainly due to the enhanced Jsc and FF as well as a slightly increased Voc. The improvement in the above photovoltaic parameters for N-GF-based PSCs is likely to stem from the increased charge extraction capability and conductivity of N-doped GFs, which promote the charge transfer and transportation as well as reduce the charge-recombination probability, thereby enhancing the Jsc, FF, and Voc. Moreover, the N-GF-based PSCs also have higher IPCE than PSCs with GFs between 400 nm to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 6b, which indicate better Jsc,26,43 consistent with the J–V characteristic curve. All these results suggest the superior photovoltaic performance of N-GF-based PSCs over GFs and the potential of N-GFs as excellent counter electrode materials for HTM-free PSCs. The reproducibility of the PSCs based on N-GF and GF counter electrodes are investigated, and the statistical data are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), which reveal that N-GF-based PSCs have small standard deviation and good reproducibility. The stability of PSCs is important for practical applications. Therefore, the stability tests (Fig. S5, ESI†) of the N-GF- and GF-based HTM-free PSCs are evaluated under AM 1.5G irradiation in ambient air, and the PSCs based on Au electrode are also examined for comparison. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the N-GF and GF electrode-based PSCs retain about 78% of their original value after 500 h in ambient air, outperforming the reference Au-based PSCs (≈55%), indicating the good stability of the PSCs based on the N-GFs and GFs, which is mainly due to the hydrophobic property of carbon materials.30,33

Furthermore, to understand the enhancement in the photovoltaic performance of N-GF-based PSCs, the charge-extraction efficiency and transportation ability of N-GFs are investigated.
Steady-state PL measurement is usually adopted to investigate the charge-extraction efficiency between the HTM and perovskite layer.43,47,48 From the PL spectra in Fig. 7a, a clear quenching effect is observed at approximately 764 nm when the perovskite layer establishes contact with either the N-GF or the GF layer. N-GFs exhibit a stronger PL quenching effect than GFs, indicating higher charge-extraction efficiency from perovskite to N-GFs than GFs.43,48 This result is probably due to the change in energy-band structure of N-GFs induced by N doping, which may render the N-GFs more efficient in extracting holes from the perovskite surface. Then, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is used to investigate the effect of the energy-band structure of N-GFs and GFs on charge-extraction efficiency, and the curves obtained from UPS characterization results (Fig. 7b) are applied to ascertain the work function data for N-GFs and GFs. The work function of GFs downshifts from 5.22 eV to 4.92 eV for N-GFs, which may be due to the dominant pyrrole nitrogen in N-GFs (Fig. 2b) similar to other reported works that N doping results in decreased graphene work function.35,49 The conduction band and valence band position of CH3NH3PbI3 are 3.86 eV and 5.43 eV, respectively, according to previous reports.43 As shown in the energy-level diagram for various components in Fig. 7c, N-GFs are energetically more favorable to extract photoinduced holes in CH3NH3PbI3 than GFs, which may be explained from the fact that a larger energy difference will result in a larger excess energy of transferred charge and thereby reduce the charge recombination probability.50–54 This finding is consistent with the above PL analysis, which showed that the N-GF-based PSCs can increase Jsc and Voc and thus photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 7  (a) Steady-state PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3/N-GFs, and CH3NH3PbI3/GFs, respectively, (b) UPS spectra of the N-GFs and GFs, and (c) the energy level diagram for various components used in PSCs. 
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is performed to study the charge-transport dynamics at the PSC interface. The impedance spectra of N-GF- and GF-based PSCs at an applied bias of 800 mV in the dark are presented in Fig. 8a, and the enlarged high-frequency region is shown in Fig. 8b. Two semicircles are observed for both PSCs, consistent with a previous report, and these correspond to two distinctly different charge transport or transfer behaviors.19,43 The high-frequency semicircle may represent charge transport in the carbon counter electrode, whereas the lower-frequency semicircle may be attributed to the charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface.19,43 By fitting the Nyquist curves using the reported equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 8b, N-GF-based PSCs show a considerably larger recombination resistance Rrec of 850 Ω than GFs (550 Ω), suggesting that N-GFs are superior to GFs in charge separation and collection and thus reduce the charge recombination, consistent with a previous report.19,43 To further investigate the charge-transfer properties of PSCs based on N-GFs and GFs, EIS analysis is performed at different applied biases ranging from 500 mV to 900 mV. The resulting Nyquist curves illustrated in Fig. S6 (ESI†) are fitted using the equivalent circuit (Fig. 8b, inset). Notably, the obtained Rrec for N-GF-based PSCs is higher than that obtained with GFs throughout the entire applied bias range, as shown in Fig. 8c, suggesting more considerable suppression of charge recombination at the interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and N-GFs, which may be due to the better function of N-GFs to extract holes. This result well agrees with those of PL and UPS analyses. The larger Rrec is supposed to an important factor determining the increase in Jsc and Voc values,19,43 which favor the improvement of photovoltaic performance of N-GF-based PSCs. This trend is similar to the above J–V and IPCE results. In addition, series resistance (Rs), another important parameter that is purportedly affected by charge transport in solar cells,26,55,56 is derived from the Nyquist curves. The Rs can reflect the conductivity of the N-GF and GF electrodes, and FF is sensitive to Rs.26,55,56Fig. 8d shows that the Rs values of N-GF-based PSCs are smaller than those of GF, implying the better charge-transport property in the N-GF-based PSCs; consequently, a higher FF is achieved in N-GF-based PSCs. Overall, the N-GF-based PSCs show better photovoltaic performance than GF-based PSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized N-GFs with a large specific surface area (1149 m2 g−1) using FA, Na2CO3, and urea through a facile, one-step fast pyrolysis. N-GFs can be utilized as excellent counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs, and the optimized devices achieve a PCE of 10.32%. The PSCs based on N-GFs exhibit greater photovoltaic performance than those based on GFs, probably because of the higher charge extraction efficiency and transportation ability, which lead to significant suppression of charge recombination and enhanced charge collection efficiency. Moreover, N-GFs are also promising for practical application in a broad range of fields, such as in fuel cells, lithium batteries, and supercapacitors.
