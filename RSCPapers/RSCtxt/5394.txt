    , Accepted 12th August 2019First published on 14th August 2019AbstractThe good environmental stability of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is crucial for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. In this paper, an efficiency improvement from 6.85% to 8.63% is achieved by doping SnBr2 into the CsPbBr3 light absorbing layer in FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon perovskite solar cells. By doping with SnBr2, the CsPbBr3 perovskite light absorbing layer is more continuous and nonporous, and the charge transport of the CsPbBr3 layer doped with SnBr2 is accelerated. The SnBr2 incorporation also modifies the band structure of the CsPbBr3 perovskite material so that the valence band energy level shifts from −5.6 eV to −5.46 eV. As a result, the energy level between the carbon electrode and the light absorbing layer is more matched, facilitating the charge transport of holes from the light absorbing layer to the carbon electrode. This work highlights a doping method in CsPbBr3 to enhance the solar cell performance.
Introduction
Since the discovery of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), they have received unprecedented attention because of their high efficiency and simple preparation.1–6 However, most of the PSCs have poor environmental stability, as they are severely affected by humidity, temperature, and light intensity.7 The majority of the perovskite materials degrade at 300 °C and decompose with oxygen in the atmosphere.8,9 Moreover, under illumination, the perovskite layer is also susceptible to the degradation reaction with the electron transport layer.10 Among various PSCs, all-inorganic PSCs with CsPbBr3 as the light absorbing layer are attractive due to their efficiency and stability.11–13 When the batteries are not packaged, they can maintain more than 85% of their original efficiency after being in air for three months. Thanks to their excellent environmental stability, CsPbBr3 PSCs can be prepared in the atmosphere which is far better than other PSCs. Moreover, such a carbon based solar cell using a porous structure removes a highly hygroscopic, expensive hole transport layer, which makes it cheaper and more environmentally friendly than conventional PSCs.11
For an ideal photovoltaic device, the most important thing is to promote favorable interface charge dynamics and minimize carrier loss for the maximum power output.3,14,15 It is regrettable that the quality of the CsPbBr3 perovskite film obtained by the conventional one-step (spin-coating PbBr2 and CsBr mixed precursor solution) or two-step (first spin coating of a layer of PbBr2 and then spin-coating of a layer of CsBr) process is poor and mixed with CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6, which is disadvantageous for the preparation of highly efficient PSCs. Moreover, CsPbBr3, with a conduction band (CB) of −3.3 eV and a valence band (VB) of −5.6 eV, has a 2.3 eV wide bandgap level. This limits its charge transport capability and also makes its visible light absorption range narrower. In addition, the energy level mismatch between the carbon electrode and the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer, and the presence of a high-energy barrier in the TiO2/CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces severely affect the extraction efficiency of the interface charge.16–19 Due to these problems, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbBr3 PSCs is usually less than 10.6%.20–24 How to improve the efficiency of the CsPbBr3 PSCs without losing their good environmental stability thus is crucial.
In order to obtain a better crystalline quality and better energy matching of CsPbBr3 perovskite cells with the carbon electrode, a high quality CsPbBr3 perovskite light absorbing layer is obtained by doping SnBr2 in PbBr2N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and using a multi-step solution spin coating method (first spin coating of a layer of PbBr2 and then spin-coating CsBr solution six times).21 By doping with SnBr2, a CsPbBr3 film layer with a small amount of pinhole is obtained. And the obtained CsPbBr3 perovskite layer exhibits better charge extraction and transport ability. Sn2+ which has a smaller radius than Pb2+ exists in the lattice gap of CsPbBr3, and the incorporation of Sn2+ regulates the band gap of the CsPbBr3 perovskite material. The high energy barrier between the carbon electrode and the light absorbing layer is lowered, thereby accelerating carrier transport. By means of SnBr2 doping, the PCE of CsPbBr3 PSCs can be enhanced from 6.85% to 8.63%.
Experimental
PbBr2 (99%), CsBr (99%) and SnBr2 (99%) are purchased from Xian Baolaite. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%), methanol (99.9%), chlorobenzene (99.9%) and isopropoxide (99.5%) are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The compact TiO2 slurry and the mesoporous TiO2 slurry are synthesized by a method reported in the literature.25 Commercial carbon paste is purchased from Guangzhou Saidi. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO; Nippon, 14 Ω □−1, 100 mm × 150 mm) is used as a substrate for solar cells.
Two precursor solutions were formed by dissolving PbBr2 and a small amount of SnBr2 in a DMF solution and dissolving CsBr in a methanol solution. The amounts of PbBr and CsBr were 1 mol L−1 and 0.07 mol L−1, respectively. Both precursors needed to be heated at 60 °C for 30 minutes to ensure complete dissolution of the PbBr2 and CsBr. The precursor liquid formed is transparent and colorless. The preparation process includes: first, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates were etched with hydrochloric acid before being ultrasonically cleaned in aqueous washing solution, ethanol and acetone. After this the patterned substrate was coated with a compact TiO2 layer (80 nm) and a mesoporous TiO2 layer (120 nm) by spin-coating at a rate of 4000 rad s−1 and 3000 rad s−1, repectively, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, a 1 mol L−1 PbBr2 DMF solution was spin-coated at a rate of 2000 rad s−1 on the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 structure and annealed at 90 °C for 50 min; the 0.07 mol L−1 CsBr methanol solution was immediately spin-coated on the PbBr2 film layer at a rate of 2000 rad s−1, and the CsBr methanol solution was spin-coated six times. After spin-coating, each layer of CsBr solution was annealed at 250 °C for 5 min. Finally, an isopropanol solution was spin-coated at 1000 rad s−1 to rinse the CsPbBr3 layer and to anneal at 250 °C for 5 min. (The preparation of the CsPbBr3 layer is shown in Fig. 1.) The thickness of the CsPbBr3 layer was approximately 500 nm. The carbon paste was deposited directly on the perovskite film by a doctor blade method and annealed at 90 °C for 40 minutes to form a carbon electrode (20 μm) finally.

Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the color of the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/PbBr2 substrate after spin-coating different layers of CsBr methanol solution. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) and (b) that when there is first spin-coating of CsBr to PbBr2, the color of the substrate rapidly changes from white to yellow. At this time, CsBr reacts with PbBr2 as follows: 2PbBr2 + CsBr = CsPb2Br5 and CsPb2Br5 + CsBr = 2CsPbBr3. After heating at 250 °C for 5 minutes, the substrate turns white, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Meanwhile, the chemical reaction of CsPb2Br5 = CsPbBr3 + PbBr2 occurs. Since the amount of CsPbBr3 finally formed is very small, the color change of the substrate is not obvious and white is dominant. As the number of layers of spin-coated CsBr methanol solution increases, the amount of CsPbBr3 generated increases and the color of the substrate gradually deepens. After the spin coating and annealing of the layer three times, the color of the substrate changes from white to light yellow as shown in Fig. 2(d), and after layer spin coating and annealing six times, the substrate turns into a brighter yellow color. This indicates that PhBr2 has fully reacted, and the color of the base will not deepen even if the spin coating is continued.

Fig. 3(a–d) show the SEM images of PbBr2 undoped and doped with SnBr2 at 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. From the SEM images of (a–d), as the concentration of doped SnBr2 increases, the continuity of the PbBr2 film deteriorates, a large number of pores gradually appear, m-TiO2 is exposed, the PbBr2 grain size decreases, and grain boundaries become increasingly blurred. From the SEM images of Fig. 3(e and f), after six times spin-coating in CsBr methanol solution, there are a large number of pinholes in the CsPbBr3 film layer without doping with SnBr2, and the film quality is poor. As the concentration of SnBr2 increases, the average grain size of CsPbBr3 decreases from 1.04 μm to 0.60 μm (see Fig. 3(i–l)). Also, the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 3(m) and (n) show that the addition of SnBr2 leads to grain size reduction and the film becomes denser. Although the grain size of the CsPbBr3 film layer becomes small as SnBr2 is added, the small crystal grains fill between the large crystal grains which greatly reduces the pinhole of the CsPbBr3 perovskite layer, and the continuity of the film is improved. From the SEM images in Fig. 3(a–f), it can be inferred that the grain size is reduced and the pinhole reduction may be attributed to the increasingly poor continuity of the PbBr2 film layer. More and more pores in the PbBr2 layer make the CsBr and PbBr2 fully contact and react. However, with the increase of doping SnBr2 concentration, the pores of the PbBr2 film layer increase, the continuity becomes too poor, the m-TiO2 bare leakage is serious, and the growth of CsPbBr3 crystal grains is not enough to completely cover the whole piece of m-TiO2. A small amount of pinholes appeared in the CsPbBr3 film which was obtained at a concentration of 0.3% SnBr2. Therefore, we believe that the CsPbBr3 perovskite light absorbing layer film obtained at a concentration of 0.2% SnBr2 has the least number of pinholes and the strongest continuity. In addition, we obtained the steady-state PL characterization of the glass/CsPbBr3 film (see Fig. 3(o)). At the doping concentration of 0.2%, the PL peak of the film is the strongest, and the quality of CsPbBr3 is the best. The results are consistent with the SEM images.

In order to study the effect of SnBr2 doped into PbBr2 on the growth of the CsPbBr3 perovskite absorber layer, we performed XRD characterization of the FTO/CsPbBr3 films obtained by a multi-step solution spin coating method.21 From the XRD pattern in Fig. 4(a), the diffraction peaks of CsPbBr3 perovskite crystals which are grown at different SnBr2 doping concentrations are mainly concentrated at 15.5°, 21.8°, 30.4° and 38.1°, which correspond to the characteristic peaks of perovskite materials of (100), (110), (200), (211), indicating that good CsPbBr3 cubic phases are formed under different concentrations of SnBr2.26–29 Corresponding to the XRD patterns of different SnBr2 doped concentrations, there is no characteristic peak associated with Sn, indicating that the incorporation of SnBr2 does not introduce a new heterogeneous phase in the perovskite material, which is advantageous for the preparation of stable and highly efficient all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. From the CsPbBr3 XRD diffraction patterns with an SnBr2 concentration of 0.2%, the XRD diffraction peak is stronger than the original and other doping concentrations, the mixed peak is weaker, and the corresponding PbBr2 is not observed. These weak diffraction peaks indicate that the formed CsPbBr3 crystal phase is purer. In the XRD diffraction pattern magnified near 30° in Fig. 4(b), it is found that the diffraction peaks shift to small angles as the concentration of doped SnBr2 increases, which indicates that part of Sn2+ has entered the lattice gap of CsPbBr3, causing the crystal lattice to expand.30,31 In order to determine the change of the bond energy of Pb and Br after doping with SnBr2, we performed XPS analysis to characterize the CsPbBr3 film without SnBr2 and with 0.2% SnBr2. The addition of SnBr2 results in an increase in the bond energy of Br and Pb as shown in the XPS characterization of Pb 4f and Br 3d (see Fig. 4(c) and (d)). It can be inferred that since the electronegativity of the Sn ion is stronger than that of the Pb ion, the bonding of the CsPbBr3 crystal is enhanced, which facilitates the formation of the stable and continuous perovskite film. Characterization by the above XRD and XPS techniques shows that doping with SnBr2 in CsPbBr3 is advantageous for film formation of CsPbBr3.

In order to further investigate whether the Sn2+ in the doped SnBr2 affects the energy band structure of the CsPbBr3 perovskite material, we performed UPS characterization of the CsPbBr3 perovskite material that was undoped and doped with SnBr2. The UPS spectra of CsPbBr3 at different SnBr2 dosages are shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(c) which is the main structure of the PSCs. According to the formula:11,32 WF(work function) = hν + Ecutoff − EF(1)The work function of the CsPbBr3 material is reduced by 0.037 eV when the SnBr2 doping concentration is 0.1%. When doping with 0.2% SnBr2, it is 0.137 eV less than the original. The decrease in work function means that the valence band of the CsPbBr3 perovskite material moves from −5.6 eV to −5.46 eV. In the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of Fig. 5(b), the absorption band edge of the CsPbBr3 material at different doping concentrations substantially coincides with the original absorption band edge, indicating that the obtained CsPbBr3 materials have the same band gap width.33 The incorporation of SnBr2 reduces the energy gap between the CsPbBr3 light absorbing layer and the carbon electrode interface from −5.6–5.0 eV to −5.46–5.0 eV (as shown in Fig. 5(c)).13 The high energy barrier between the CsPbBr3 light absorbing layer and the carbon electrode hinders the transport of holes from the light absorbing layer to the electrode, thereby degrading the PSC efficiency. The incorporation of SnBr2 reduces the barrier between the interfaces, allowing holes to be more efficiently transported to the carbon electrode, improving the carrier transport efficiency.

(d) Spectra of FTO/CsPbBr3 films doped with different concentrations of SnBr2. 
To illustrate the effect of SnBr2 incorporation on the CsPbBr3 perovskite light-absorbing layer, the charge extraction ability of the doped and undoped SnBr2 CsPbBr3 layer is studied by steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), as shown in Fig. 5(d).
It can be seen that the PL peaks of the FTO/CsPbBr3 film layer doped with SnBr2 are significantly quenched compared with the FTO/CsPbBr3 film with undoped SnBr2. The PL peaks of the FTO/CsPbBr3 layer doped with SnBr2 are reduced, and when the concentration of SnBr2 is 0.2%, the PL peak intensity is at the lowest level, which indicates that the CsPbBr3 light absorbing layer is most effective for the charge extraction at this doping concentration.
We further studied the effect of the incorporation of SnBr2 on the performance of the PSCs by preparing CsPbBr3 doped with different concentrations of SnBr2 into PSCs. The main structure of the PSCs is shown in Fig. 5(c). The structure includes FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon. Fig. 6(a) shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) curve of the PSCs doped with SnBr2 and undoped with SnBr2 under standard AM 1.5 (100 mW cm2) illumination. The photovoltaic parameters such as Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are listed in Table 1. From Table 1 and Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that the original device without SnBr2 has a PCE of 6.85%, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.29 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 7.27 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.04%. By doping with SnBr2, the device Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are significantly improved. When doped with 0.2% SnBr2, the device shows the best photovoltaic parameter, and the PCE increased to 8.63%. Meanwhile, the device parameters show excellent performance of Voc of 1.37 V, Jsc of 7.66 mA cm−2 and FF of 82.22%. Among them, with the increase of SnBr2 doping concentration, the Jsc of the device is from 7.27 mA cm−2 of the original device to 7.66 mA cm−2 at a doping concentration of 0.2%, and then to 7.07 mA cm−2 at a doping concentration of 0.3%, and the current density first increases and then decreases, which may be attributed to the fact that the incorporation of SnBr2 enhances the charge extraction efficiency in the TiO2/CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces. However, with an increase of the SnBr2 doping concentration to 0.3%, the crystallites of the CsPbBr3 perovskite absorbance layer decreased, and the grain boundaries and pinholes increased,34 resulting in more defects, and thus the PSCs leakage current is increased and the current density is lowered so the solar cell efficiency also drops. It can be seen that the devices doped with SnBr2 has a significant improvement over the original FF, and the FF reaches 82.22% at a doping concentration of 0.2%. It is 12.57% higher than the original 73.04%. The optimization of FF may be attributed to the accelerated transmission efficiency of the carriers. Fig. 6(b) shows the forward bias scan and reverse bias scan J–V curves for the devices that were undoped and doped with 0.2% SnBr2, and there is almost no difference between the forward and reverse J–V curves of the two devices, indicating that the introduction of SnBr2 does not cause hysteresis. It can be seen from the Fig. 6(c) IPCE images that the absorbable wavelength range of the devices at different doping concentrations are 350–530 nm, and the narrow absorbable wavelength range may be attributed to the wide band gap (2.3 eV) of the CsPbBr3 material. The original device without SnBr2 doping has a maximum monochromatic incident photon-to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 90%. After doping with 0.1% and 0.2% SnBr2, the IPCE was up to 98%. This demonstrates that the solar cell devices are more efficient in extracting and transporting carriers after appropriately doping with SnBr2. Such a pattern of the IPCE is consistent with the J–V curve of the devices.

We used impedance spectroscopy to further understand the effect of Sn2+ incorporation on carrier recombination and transmission behavior. Impedance tests are performed on different cells under dark conditions, at −1.25 V bias and at measurement frequencies from 1 mHz to 1 MHz. Fig. 6(d) shows the Nyquist diagram of cells doped with SnBr2 (0.2%) and undoped SnBr2. The equivalent circuit diagram is in the upper left corner of Fig. 6(d). The equivalent circuit consists of series resistance (Rs), contact resistance (Rco) and recombination resistance (Rrec). The measured impedance map typically has two semicircles, and the left semicircle in the high frequency region is related to Rco (as shown in the illustration in the lower left corner of Fig. 6(d)). It mainly reflects the charge extraction and separation from the perovskite absorber layer to the hole transport layer and the electron transport layer. The right semicircle in the low frequency region is related to the Rrec of the solar cell, mainly reflecting the recombination of carriers inside the solar cell. From the fitting parameters in the upper right corner of Fig. 6(d), the undoped and doped 0.2% SnBr2 devices have close Rs and Rco, and the Rrec of the device doped with 0.2% SnBr2 is significantly increased. The battery's Rrec has increased from 310 Ω to 550 Ω, which indicates that the incorporation of Sn2+ helps passivate defects and suppress the recombination of carriers, and it also contributes to carrier extraction and transportation.35 At the same time, we further study the transmission of the photogenerated carriers on the time scale by a transient photocurrent. Transient photocurrent measurements are performed under short circuit conditions. Fig. 6(e) shows transient photocurrent decay curves for a solar cell device doped with 0.2% SnBr2 and not doped with SnBr2, and the photocurrent decay time of the device which is doped with 0.2% SnBr2 is 14.33 μs compared with the original 19.85 μs, and the photocurrent decay rate is significantly faster than that of the undoped original PSCs.36 This means that the transport capacity of the PSC doped with SnBr2 is stronger than that of the control group. The increase of the carrier transport capacity is attributed to the incorporation of SnBr2, which reduces the interfacial defects and inhibits the recombination of interface charge, and modifies the energy level of CsPbBr3, which is beneficial for carrier transport. This also indicates that the incorporation of SnBr2 makes carrier transport more efficient.37 These results are consistent with the performance of PSCs, further indicating that doping with SnBr2 can improve the electrical properties of PSCs.
To demonstrate the repeatability of the device, 40 independent devices were taken for each type of device. As can be seen from Fig. 7(a), the narrow PCE distributions and high PCE values suggest high-performance all-inorganic PSC devices with good reproducibility. In addition, in the steady-state current and stable power output tests of Fig. 7(b) and (c), devices undoped and doped with 0.2% SnBr2 have a stable current output of over 80s and a stable PCE output of over 100s. The stable current and stable output power of PSCs doped with SnBr2 are significantly larger than those of undoped devices. Once again it was confirmed that incorporation of SnBr2 can effectively improve the performance of PSCs. The superior stability is the greatest advantage of the CsPbBr3 PSCs compared to the high efficiency MAPbI3 organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, so the stability of the CsPbBr3 PSCs is critical. Fig. 7(d) shows the PCE curves of CsPbBr3 PSCs with and without doping of SnBr2 under unpackaged conditions at a temperature of 25 °C and a humidity of 10% for three months. Similarly, Fig. 7(e) shows the PCE performance in an air environment (the temperature is between −10 °C and 30 °C, and the humidity is between 30% and 90%). It can be seen from Fig. 7(d) that after three months of being placed at a temperature of 25 °C and a humidity of 10%, the efficiency of the undoped and doped SnBr2 devices is only slightly attenuated. The PSC efficiency still maintains more than 90% of the original efficiency. From Fig. 7(e), it is seen that the efficiency drop of the two devices which are doped and undoped with SnBr2 is slightly more obvious after being placed in an air environment for three months than at 25 °C and 10% RH, but they still retain more than 85% of their original efficiency. Although a small amount of highly oxidizable Sn2+ is added, the efficiency of the devices has not decreased. In either case, the introduction of SnBr2 does not deteriorate the stability of the CsPbBr3 PSCs, which is very important. The CsPbBr3 all-inorganic PSCs exhibit a good temperature and humidity stability compared to organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, which may contribute to the commercialization of PSCs.

Conclusions
In this study, the solar cells of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon structure are successfully prepared under an air environment. The charge extraction between the CsPbBr3 light absorbing layer and c-TiO2/m-TiO2 is improved by incorporating SnBr2 in the CsPbBr3 perovskite light absorbing layer. The energy band structure of the CsPbBr3 material is regulated and the high energy barrier between the CsPbBr3 light absorbing layer and the carbon electrode is lowered. Therefore, the hole transport from the light absorbing layer to the carbon electrode becomes more effective. The PCE is increased from 6.85% to 8.63% at a concentration of 0.2% of SnBr2. The PSC performance is significantly improved, and the solar cells have good environmental stability. Although CsPbBr3 is doped with a small amount of easily oxidizable Sn2+, the stability of the battery to the environment is not lowered. The unpackaged PSCs can retain more than 85% of the initial efficiency after being stored for 3 months in air. This study provides an effective method for improving the efficiency of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs.
