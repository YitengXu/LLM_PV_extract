    , Accepted 14th June 2014First published on 16th June 2014AbstractA one-step and mass-production synthetic route for a flexible reduced tungsten oxide–carbon composite nanofiber (WOx–C-NF) film is demonstrated via an electrospinning technique. The WOx–C-NF film exhibits unprecedented high content of metal-oxides (∼80 wt%) and good flexibility (the tensile strength of the specimen was 6.13 MPa) without the use of flexible support materials like CNTs or graphene. The WOx–C-NF film is directly used as an anode in a lithium ion battery (LIB). Compared with previously reported tungsten oxide electrodes, the WOx–C-NF film exhibits high reversible capacity (481 mA h g−1total electrode), stable cycle, and improved rate performance, without the use of additive carbon, a polymeric binder and a current collector. Moreover, control electrodes fabricated by conventional processes support the positive effects of both the freestanding electrode and metal-oxide embedded carbon 1-D nanofiber structure.
1. Introduction
Flexible energy-storage systems, such as batteries and supercapacitors, have been actively studied for the commercialization of flexible devices, including wearable electronics, electronic paper, roll-up displays, etc.1,2 To achieve this, a recent study concentrated on the development of flexible and free-standing electrode films with high chemical and mechanical stability. An efficient synthetic method could simplify the existing complicated electrode production processes, in which conventional powder-type active materials are used. For example, free-standing electrodes do not require binders, carbon additives and metal current collectors. The binder, used to provide close contact between the active materials, the additive carbon and current collector, has its own demerits: (i) an electrochemically inactive nature and (ii) a thermal stability problem.3–6 In addition, the current collector accounts for a substantial portion of the electrode mass. Usually, a 20 μm thick copper substrate that is commonly used as a battery anode has an areal density of ∼15 mg cm−2. Therefore, the use of a binder and a current collector results in a great decline in the gravimetric/volumetric power and energy density. Moreover, the conventional electrode production process requires multiple-steps, including slurry production, current-collector coating, drying, and electrode configuration.
Recently, in order to fabricate flexible and free-standing electrodes, various approaches have been developed by many researchers using “flexible materials” such as carbon nanotube (CNT) films, graphene films, porous metal substrates, etc.7–16 Among these, graphene and CNTs have been employed to construct flexible electrodes in many reported studies. Because of their mechanical flexibility and high electron mobility, both graphene and CNTs have been widely used as flexible supports for transition-metal-oxide loading. Recently, many papers have reported the preparation of flexible metal-oxide/graphene (or CNT) composite films by using filtration or sonication methods.8–11,17 These flexible films have been directly used as electrodes in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) or supercapacitors and exhibited reasonable cycle and rate performances.
However, some fundamental limitations are still present. In the case of a graphene electrode, the metal oxide loading content is limited to 50–60 wt%.18–21 When the metal loading increases, the film becomes brittle in most cases. In addition, chemically modified graphene, which is composed of several carbon layers, could disturb the diffusion of active ions (Li+ in the LIB case) into the metal-oxide particles.22,23 On the other hand, in a case where CNTs are used as a conducting support, it is difficult to disperse hydrophilic active particles on the surfaces of the CNTs because of the hydrophobic nature of these surfaces. In most cases, the active particles are physically trapped in pores between CNT fibers. Therefore, in order to maximize the electrochemical performance of metal-oxide/CNT nanocomposites, additional processes are required, such as the introduction of functionalities onto the CNT surface or addition of a surfactant.24,25 Moreover, because the homogeneous mixing of the metal-oxide and carbon materials is not guaranteed with a physical mixing approach, the aggregation problem still exists in conversion-based materials. Based on these basic problems, a new approach for flexible film electrodes is urgently needed to realize the mass production of flexible energy storage systems.
Among the various candidates, an electrospinning technique could be a solution to the above-mentioned problems. Electrospinning is a versatile method for the low-cost mass production of nanofibers with diameters ranging from 10 to 1000 nm.26,27 When a voltage is applied, an electric force is generated between a polymeric solution in a syringe tip and a substrate, resulting in a jet of the polymeric solution. The length and diameter of the electrospun fiber are easily controlled by adjusting the voltage, concentration and viscosity of the polymeric solution, and the distance between the substrate and the tip. However, it has been difficult to construct a free-standing and flexible inorganic (metal-oxide) film despite the easy fabrication of metal precursor–polymer as-spun fibers. This was because the size of the nanocrystals continues to grow during the calcination process, resulting in a severe deformation of the nanofiber structures.28–31
Recently, some free-standing and flexible electrodes have been fabricated through an electrospinning approach for application in energy storage devices.32,33 However, there are still limitations to overcome, such as the multiple fabrication steps (an active material was coated after the fabrication of a carbon nanofiber film using electrospinning34) and low metal-oxide loading (10–20 wt%). A higher metal-oxide content would be favorable for the performance of a real cell. (i) In real battery applications, the volumetric energy/power performance is the most important characteristic. However, carbon-based electrodes exhibit a lower electrode density than metal-oxide-based electrodes. (ii) Carbon electrodes show a low coulombic efficiency of approximately 30–60%, which produces a considerable Li ion loss in the first cycles.35,36 In this sense, it is necessary to develop free-standing and flexible metal-oxide-based films with high metal-oxide loading through a simple electrospinning process.
Tungsten oxides, which are rarely studied for anodes, are attractive materials for anodes because of their multiple oxidation states, low price and high intrinsic density.37–39 Recently, a few groups have synthesized nanostructured tungsten oxides using various approaches such as a hydrothermal method and spray pyrolysis and have applied them as anode materials in LIBs.40–43 In our previous study, we synthesized ordered mesoporous reduced tungsten oxide (m-WO3−x) and applied it as an LIB anode material.44 The partial reduction of tungsten oxide resulted in an enhanced electrical conductivity due to the intervalence charge transfer between W5+ and W6+.45 This reduced-tungsten-oxide anode exhibited a higher capacity and faster rate performance than other nanostructured tungsten oxides because of the positive effects of the ordered mesoporous structure and enhanced electrical conductivity. Moreover, the reduced tungsten oxides (m-WO3−x) were also successfully applied in various energy related devices including fuel cells, supercapacitors, and dye-sensitized solar cells.46–50
In this study, we synthesized electrospun free-standing and flexible tungsten oxide/carbon nanofibers (denoted as WOx–C-NF) using ammonium-meta-tungstate (AMT) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the tungsten and carbon precursors, respectively. The selection of the precursors and optimization of the synthetic conditions resulted in the successful fabrication of a flexible film with a high mass-loading of metal oxide (∼80 wt% tungsten oxide). The fabricated WOx–C-NF film was directly used as an LIB anode without further processing, meaning that no current collectors, carbon additives, and binders were needed to fabricate the electrodes. Compared with other tungsten oxide anode studies, our WOx–C-NF film electrode exhibited a high reversible capacity (481 mA h g−1), a coulombic efficiency (74.5%), and good rate and cycle performances. Because we achieved high loading of tungsten oxide which has high intrinsic density, the coulombic efficiency was higher than that in carbon rich free-standing electrodes, and a large amount of electrochemically active materials could be packed into a limited space. Because of the versatility of the electrospinning technique, this process will be applicable to the mass production of electrode films with a low-cost in a short time.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of WOx–C-NF
The electrospun WOx–C-NF were fabricated using a polymer and tungsten precursor composite solution. First, 0.8 g of ammonium-meta-tungstate hydrate ((NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O, Aldrich, 99.99%) and 0.58 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW: 1300000, Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 2 ml and 6 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Macron chemicals) solution. The two solutions were stirred for 10 h and then homogeneously mixed together. The prepared precursor solution was transferred to a 10 ml plastic syringe. The solution was supplied by using a syringe pump (KD Scientific, KDS 100). The flow rate of the precursor solution was 0.12 ml h−1, respectively. A single nozzle tip (plastic nozzle tip 21G 1/4, Nanonc. CO.) was used in the electrospinning process. The distance between the nozzle tip and the substrate was 20 cm. A high electrical potential of 11.5 kV was applied to the precursor solution using a power supply. Finally, the as-spun WOx–C-NF was collected on the substrate. To obtain the WOx–C-NF, the as spun fibers were heat treated at 700 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere.
2.2. Material characterization
The morphologies of the materials were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JSM-840A, JEOL) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEM-2010, JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken using a Rigaku D/Max-3C diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) images of the WOx–C-NF were obtained using a JEM-2200FS (JEOL) instrument. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA) were performed using an SII EXSTAR 6000 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Raman spectrum analysis was performed using a LabRam ARAMIS (460 mm focal length monochromator with an air cooled (−70 °C) CCD multichannel detector). The flexible properties of the WOx–C-NFs film were measured by using a MTS Nano Universal Testing System (Nano UTM).
2.3. Electrochemical characterization
An electrochemical test was conducted using a coin-type two-electrode cell (CR2032). The electrospun WOx–C-NF was directly used as an electrode after cutting the film into a round shape with a diameter of 14 mm. For the control experiment, WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano slurries were prepared by mixing the electrode materials with a binder (polyvinylidene difluoride) and additive carbon (Super P) (mass ratio of 8:1:1) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). After mixing, the slurries were coated on a Cu foil. The electrodes were dried at 110 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. Finally, the electrodes were punched into 14 mm diameter circles. The coin cells were assembled using prepared electrodes with lithium metal foil, a polyethylene separator, and an electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate, 1:1 volume ratio, Panaxetec Co., KOREA) in a glove box. A galvanostatic charge–discharge test was performed using a WBCS-3000 battery cycler (Xeno Co.) with various current densities (0.05 to 5 A g−1) in a potential range of 3.0 to 0.01 V (vs. Li/Li+). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted using a Reference 600 potentiostat (Gamry Instruments, USA). The voltage range for the CV test was 3 to 0.01 V with a scan rate of 0.15 mV s−1. The EIS test was conducted under different voltage conditions (OCV of pure cells and 0.01 V after 5 cycles) in a frequency range of 105 to 0.01 Hz under an AC stimulus with 5 mV amplitude. For ex situ SEM study, the cells were disassembled in the glove box and the electrodes were washed with anhydrous dimethyl carbonate (99%, Aldrich). After drying, the electrodes were attached to the carbon tape for sample fixation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of the WOx–C-NF via electrospinning
The synthetic procedure for the flexible WOx–C-NF film is summarized in Scheme 1. A polymeric solution was prepared by homogeneous mixing of AMT, PVP, and N,N-dimethylformamide. Subsequently, this polymeric solution was introduced into the nozzle by using syringe pumps. When a voltage was applied, the as-spun nanofiber web was formed by a jet of the polymeric solution. Finally, the WOx–C-NF film was obtained by heat-treatment at 700 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Although the film size shrank upon heat-treatment, the free-standing and flexible characteristics were maintained after heat treatment. The morphology of the WOx–C-NF was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

Fig. 1A shows the as-spun film which consisted of nanoscale fibers with an average diameter of 190 ± 60 nm with a high aspect ratio. The as-spun WOx–C-NF film had common flexible properties like a fabric (inset of Fig. 1A). After heat treatment at 700 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, the size of the free-standing film and the diameter of the nanofibers were reduced by thermal shrinkage from the decomposition of the inorganic precursors and polymers (Fig. 1B and ESI, S1†). The average diameter of the WOx–C-NF was 135 ± 85 nm.

Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1C, the WOx–C-NF show a smooth surface without any bead formation or particle aggregation on the surface of the nanofibers, indicating that small WOx nanoparticles could be well embedded and distributed inside the nanofiber. In general, after the calcination process, the electrospun metal-oxide nanofibers revealed a rough surface or sintered particle morphology like a string of pearls.28–31,51 Consequently, the as-electrospun film could not sustain its original free-standing properties after high-temperature heat-treatment. Fig. 1F shows a digital photograph of the bent WOx–C-NF film. The SEM image of the folded region of the WOx–C-NF film also reveals that its bent part is not collapsed (Fig. 1E), and the unbroken long nanofibers are continuously tangled with each other in a large range for the entire web (Fig. 1D). These results support the conclusion that the WOx–C-NF film maintains flexible properties even after heat treatment at a high temperature.
To investigate the morphology of the WOx–C-NF in more detail, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study was performed (Fig. 2). As confirmed in the SEM studies, the smooth surfaces of the WOx–C-NF are observed, and there are no exposed large and sintered inorganic particles, as shown in Fig. 2A. A high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image showed that the small WOx nanoparticles (less than 3 nm) were uniformly dispersed inside the amorphous carbon matrix generated by carbonization of PVP (Fig. 2B and C). Fig. S2† shows the XRD patterns of the WOx–C-NF, where WOx corresponds to a reduced form of the WO2.83 phase (JCPDS no.036-0103, Fig. S3†). Reduced tungsten oxides are better electrode materials than WO3 because of their enhanced electrical conductivities and capacities.44 The mean crystallite size of WOx was estimated to be 1.5 nm by the Scherrer equation using the width at half-maximum of the main peak corresponding to the (010) reflection.

This amorphous carbon matrix could prevent the growth of WOx particles during heat treatment.33,52 The uniform distribution of the small nano-sized WOx crystallites inside the carbon matrix was probably the main reason for the flexible properties of the WOx–C-NF even with high loading of tungsten oxides. To prove that the uniform small particles were crucial to the flexible properties, the as-spun of WOx–C-NF film was heat-treated at higher temperature, 900 °C (Fig. S4†). The particle size was significantly increased and the flexible properties were lost.
Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping images of the W, O, and C contents of the WOx–C-NF are presented in Fig. 2D–G. The HR-TEM images (Fig. 2B and C), along with the corresponding EELS mapping images, again confirmed that the tungsten oxide particles were embedded inside the amorphous carbon. It should be noted that the overlapping image, as shown in Fig. 2G, reveals that thin C-element layers (blue color) are formed on the outer surface of the nanofiber. This carbon layer could have been generated by decomposition of the polymer content during the heat treatment.53–55 When the polymer content was decomposed with increasing temperature, gases, such as carbon monoxide, could force out relatively light organic species out to the nanofibers, and the organic-species-rich region on the shell of the nanofiber was converted into a thin carbon shell. When the WOx–C-NF is used as an anode, this carbon layer can provide WOx particles with high chemical stability and a protecting layer during the charge–discharge reaction.54–56
To confirm the metal-oxide and carbon contents in the synthesized WOx–C-NF, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under an air atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 3A, the weight of the WOx–C-NF is reduced between 400 °C and 550 °C by the oxidation of amorphous carbon. Surprisingly, although the flexibility is given to the WOx–C-NF, its weight loss was only 17 wt% which was similar to the carbon content measured from the CHN elemental analysis (15 wt%).

In order to study the bending property of the WOx–C-NF film, tensile tests were performed on the film (Fig. 3B). The gauge length of the specimen was fixed at 10 mm. The specimen was mounted on a paper jig and set onto an MTS Nano Universal Testing System (Nano UTM), as shown in Fig. 3C. The sides of the paper jig were cut off and the specimen was stretched at a constant strain rate of 0.027 mm s−1. The data for a specimen that fractured within the gauge length were used for its mechanical properties. The tensile strength of the specimen was 6.13 MPa, and the maximum strain was 0.9%. Despite the high metal-oxide loading (83 wt%), the WOx–C-NF film showed a high strength, which supported its free-standing property, as confirmed by microscopy analysis.
Based on the above characterization, we can conclude that the flexibility of the WOx–C-NF is produced by their unique fiber structure: very small particles (∼2 nm) embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix. The key factor for this indestructible nanofiber is the proper selection of the AMT precursor for tungsten oxide. The AMT precursor is decomposed into tungsten blue oxide (reduced form) in an inert gas.57–59 This indicates that small WOx crystals are formed inside the carbon without any oxygen precursor. Moreover, it seems that the functional groups in PVP such as nitrogen and oxygen interact with AMT inside the nanofiber, which is responsible for the formation of small-sized nanoparticles. Although PVP is not a common carbon source because of its low conversion yield (less than 10 wt%),60–62 in this work, 14% of the PVP was converted into conducting amorphous carbon, producing 17 wt% of the carbon in the WOx–C-NF. Fig. S5† shows the Raman spectrum of the WOx–C-NFs. Two bands, around 1350 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1, represent the disordered carbon (D-band) and graphitic carbon (G-band), respectively.63 Recently, Wang et al. reported that a PVP as-spun nanofiber could be converted into a carbon nanofiber by appropriate heat treatment processes, including stabilization, pre-oxidation, and carbonization.64 Similarly, the interaction between AMT and PVP probably aids in the stabilization and carbonization of PVP during the heat treatment. However, further study is required to clarify the interaction between the two precursors.
3.2. Electrochemical characteristics of the WOx–C-NF
In order to test the applicability of the WOx–C-NF to current-collector-free and free-standing battery electrodes that do not require binder and carbon additives, CR 2032 coin-type cells were assembled using the WOx–C-NF film as a working electrode and Li metal as the counter and reference electrode. The WOx–C-NF film was cut into a disk-shape with a diameter of 14 mm (Scheme 1) and used directly as an electrode. In order to demonstrate the high performance of the WOx–C-NF electrode, two control bulk powder samples were prepared: (1) WOx–C-nano by heat treatment of an AMT/PVP polymeric solution (without the electrospinning process) and (2) carbon-free WOx-nano by the thermal decomposition of AMT under a nitrogen atmosphere (700 °C). To investigate the phases and morphologies of these comparison samples, XRD and TEM analyses were performed, as shown in Fig. S6.† The XRD pattern of the WOx–C-nano was confirmed to be the WO2.83 phase (JCPDS no. 036-0103) and the mean crystallite size was 6.6 nm, as calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation. The WOx-nano sample corresponded to the WO3 phase (ICSD no. 98-001-5905), and the particle size was 40 nm (Fig. S6A and C†). Fig. S6B and D† show the structures of the control samples, as investigated by TEM. The carbon content of the WOx–C-nanosample was confirmed by elemental analysis. The carbon content of WOx–C-nano was 17 wt%, similar to that in the WOx–C-NF. WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes were produced by mixing the active materials with a conducting carbon (Super P) and a binder (polyvinylidene difluoride) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1. The mass of a WOx–C-NF electrode was 2–3 mg and the total loadings of the WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes were 2.5 mg and 3.3 mg on a copper current collector with a diameter of 14 mm, respectively.
To investigate the lithiation and delithiation of the WOx–C-NF electrode, a cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was conducted at a scan rate of 0.15 mV s−1 (Fig. 4A). The electrode exhibited several cathodic and anodic peaks, corresponding to the multiple reduction and oxidation reactions of WOx. In the first cathodic process, the peak at 1.5 V was attributed to the irreversible process, and a portion of this reaction was involved in the Li+ intercalation into the WOx crystals.65–67 The peak near 0.8 V was related to the initiation of the WOx reduction and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. In previous studies, most tungsten-oxide materials exhibited an intense peak at the first cycle, indicating a large amount of SEI formation on the tungsten-oxide surface or the decomposition of the WOx crystal by conversion reaction.43,44,65–67 As shown in Fig. S7B,† the WOx-nano electrode also has a strong cathodic peak centered at 0.75 V. However, the free-standing WOx–C-NF electrode exhibited a weak cathodic peak at this potential. Similarly, the WOx–C-nano electrode also shows a weak cathodic peak (Fig. S7A†). This indicates that the amorphous carbon enveloping the WOx nanocrystal could suppress the SEI formation reaction or a severe structural change in the WOx crystal.68–72 The following cathodic peaks below 0.3 V are the results of a further reduction reaction, W5+ or W6+ into a low oxidation state (W0) following the equation: WOx + 2xLi+ + 2xe− ↔ W + xLi2O(1)
 Fig. 4  Electrochemical characterization of the WOx–C-NF electrode. (A) Cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 0.15 mV s−1 and (B) galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles measured at 50 mA g−1 current density in the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+. (C) Capacity retention profiles of WOx–C-NF, WOx–C-nano, and WOx-nano electrodes. The charge–discharge rate was fixed at 500 mA g−1. (D) Capacity changes of WOx–C-NF and WOx–C-nano electrodes under different current density conditions (0.05–5 A g−1). 
The conversion reaction produces a W metal and Li2O amorphous mixture during the first lithiation process.44,67 Although the broad anodic peak centered at 1.3 V decreased during the initial cycles, both the cathodic and anodic processes were reversible in the WOx–C-NF electrode.

Fig. 4B shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the WOx–C-NF electrode (2 mg) with a current density of 50 mA g−1. The WOx–C-NF electrode exhibited initial discharge (lithiation) and charge (delithiation) capacities of 646 mA h g−1total and 481 mA h g−1total, respectively. The WOx–C-nano electrode, on the other hand, showed first discharge and charge capacities of 770 mA h g−1WOx–C and 594 mA h g−1WOx–C (Fig. S7C†). Considering the mass of the copper film, binder and conducting carbon, the total reversible capacity of WOx–C-nano electrode is much lower, Celectrode: ∼44 mA h g−1total (the total mass of the WOx–C-nano electrode is 27.0 mg). This indicates that the electrospun free-standing electrode could increase the gravimetric energy and power densities of the LIBs as a result of its lightweight and free-standing features. The initial coulombic efficiency of the WOx–C-NF electrode (74.5%) was comparable to that of the WOx–C-nano electrode (77.1%) and higher than that of other nanostructured tungsten oxide electrodes (45–70%).39–44 On the other hand, the pure WOx-nano electrode showed a lower initial coulombic efficiency of 63.1% compared to the WOx–carbon composite electrodes (Fig. S7D,† 773 and 488 mA h g−1WOx for the lithiation and delithiation capacities, respectively).

Fig. 4C shows the cycle performances of WOx–C-NF, WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes. Using the 3 mg WOx–C-NF film, the cell was charged and discharged with a current density of 500 mA g−1. In previous studies, tungsten-oxide anodes have shown noticeable capacity degradation during the initial few cycles.39,41,42 In our study, the WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes also exhibited capacity declines during the initial 10 cycles. However, the WOx–C-NF film electrode exhibited a more stable cycle performance. The reversible capacity of the WOx–C-NF electrode after 85 cycles was 321 mA h g−1 (65.6% retention). However, only 164 mA h g−1 (31.4%) and 85 mA h g−1 (21.6%) were maintained in the WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes. In general, the destruction of the electrode integrity causes this decrease in capacity in conventional tungsten-oxide cell configurations that consist of a carbon additive, a binder, and a current collector. From the cycle data, we conclude that the enhanced cycle performance of the WOx–C-NF electrode can be attributed to both the carbon composite and 1-D nanofiber structure effects. The amorphous carbon shell provides a layer of protection against the SEI formation and mitigates the structural degradation of WOx particles during cycles. Moreover, in the WOx–C-NF, the ultra-fine WOx nanoparticles (<3 nm) are trapped inside the 1-D carbon nanofiber with homogeneous mixing, resulting in good electrical contact and improved structural stability.68–72 Fig. S8A† shows the coulombic efficiency (CE) values of three tungsten oxide cells. The plots correspond to the cycle data in Fig. 4C. At the first cycle, their CE values were 76.6, 71.8, and 55.7% for WOx–C-NF, WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes, respectively. From the second cycle, all electrodes showed a rapid increase in CE values, especially for the WOx–C-NF electrode. The CE values in the WOx–C-NF cell were over 98% from the 8th cycle, while more than 22 cycles were required to reach that value in other electrode cases. The results indicate that the WOx–C-NF has the best reversible charge–discharge performance.
The rate performance of the WOx–C-NF electrode (2 mg) was investigated by charging–discharging the cells with a current density range of 0.05–5 A g−1 (Fig. 4D). In the early cycles, the WOx–C-NF film electrode presented stable charge–discharge capacities, whereas the capacities of the WOx–C-nano electrode dropped under a slow charging rate condition of 50–100 mA g−1. At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the delithiation capacities of the WOx–C-NF and WOx–C-nano electrodes were 481 mA h g−1 and 594 mA h g−1, respectively. However, as the current densities increased, the capacity fading was severe in the WOx–C-nano electrode, 39 (7%) and 12 (2%) mA h g−1 at 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. On the other hand, the WOx–C-NF electrode had a better rate performance of 232 (48%) and 150 (31%) mA h g−1 under the same current conditions. It should be noted that the WOx–C-NF electrode showed a better rate performance even without the use of any carbon additive and metal current collector (the conducting carbon and binder were used in the case of WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes). When the current density was reduced to 1 A g−1, the charge capacity value of the WOx–C-NF electrode was 375 mA h g−1, which was slightly higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mA h g−1). The reversible capacities of both electrodes at the 31st cycle were higher than the capacity values at the 16th cycle, even at the same current density of 1 A g−1. The capacity increase during the cycles is not surprising for the conversion-based metal-oxide anodes.73–76 Based on the data, we can conclude that our electrospun WOx–C-NF electrode shows overwhelming cycle and rate performances, compared with those of the WOx–C-nano particles and tungsten oxides in other studies.39–42,44,67 In addition, the ex situ SEM images of the WOx–C-NF after 50 cycles exhibit a well-preserved 1-D nanofiber structure with a small portion of aggregated particles on the nanofibers (Fig. S9†). The SEM images represent that the WOx nanoparticles are somehow aggregated during the conversion reaction (eqn (1)), but a unique 1-D structure of the WOx–C-NF is well-maintained during the 50 cycles.
To compare the resistance properties, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted in the frequency range of 105 to 10−2 Hz. Fig. 5A and B show the Nyquist plots of the WOx–C-NF and WOx–C-nano electrodes under pure (at OCV) and fully lithiated (after 5 charge–discharge cycles) conditions, respectively. Both electrodes showed characteristic graphs, composed of a semicircle and a sloped line. Typically, the semicircle in the high frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte. The sloped line in the low frequency region is related to the Warburg diffusional process for Li ions into the electrode. In a rough comparison, it is easily confirmed that the WOx–C-NF electrode exhibits much smaller impedance values than those of the WOx–C-nano electrode under different voltage conditions. This indicates that both the charge-transfer and ion-diffusion processes are quite effective in the electrospun electrode. This resistance property occurs because the carbon framework provides an electron path to the WOx nanocrystals, and the 1-D nanofiber structure facilitates Li ion diffusion to the metal oxide.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, despite the fact that the film has 83 wt% metal oxide, we developed a free-standing and flexible WOx–C-NF film using a one-step electrospinning process. The film was used directly as a free-standing anode for LIBs and exhibited higher stability and rate performance than normal WOx–C-nano and WOx-nano electrodes. This result indicates that the “one-step electrospinning technique” is more economical than the conventional electrode fabrication because no polymeric binder, additive carbon, and current collector are employed to fabricate free-standing electrodes for LIBs. This approach can be extended to other high capacity metal-oxide materials to fabricate high performance flexible batteries.
