    , Accepted 30th April 2016First published on 3rd May 2016AbstractStrontium fluoride (SrF2) powders containing aluminum (Al3+) and doped with rare-earth neodymium (Nd3+) and ytterbium (Yb3+) were synthesized using the combustion synthesis technique. Heat-treated (700 °C for 3 h) powder samples presented the SrF2 network arranged in a face-centered cubic phase. Under pulsed laser excitation at λ = 750 nm, at room temperature, near-infrared luminescence attributed to 4f–4f electronic relaxation 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 from Nd3+ was observed in the spectral range λ ∼ 850–930 nm for both Nd3+ doped and Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder samples. Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder samples presented an additional luminescence band peak at λ ∼ 980 nm assigned to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+. Quenching of the luminescence originating from the 4F3/2 state of Nd3+ was observed in co-doped samples and the phenomenon was assigned to energy transfer (ET). ET was investigated by analysing the near-infrared luminescence dynamics of Nd3+ using the Inokuti–Hirayama model. The energy transfer mechanism was found to be of a quadrupole–quadrupole type with efficiency as high as 62%. Our results show that this system is a potential phosphor for photonics applications involving near-infrared light sources.
1. Introduction
The study of the photoluminescence emission from rare-earth (RE) doped inorganic materials has been fundamental for the use of these systems in photonics devices such as phosphor-based lamps, optical sensors, solar cells, amplifiers, lasers, etc.1–6 Among trivalent RE ions, neodymium (Nd3+) has attracted interest due to its unique properties such as numerous electronic excited states suitable for optical pumping in the ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelength range and strong near-infrared luminescence. As a consequence, Nd3+-doped materials have been extensively studied as effective near-infrared emitters with potential application in optical temperature sensing and lasing involving the 4fN intraband transitions from the 4F3/2 state to 4IJ (J = 9/2, 11/2, 13/2) states.7–11 Another important trivalent RE ion for near-infrared light generation is ytterbium (Yb3+), which presents, among REs, the largest absorption cross section in the near-infrared region at around 0.98 μm. This feature has led this element to be used with other RE ions in photon conversion involving energy transfer mechanisms.1–6,12,13 The phenomenon of near-infrared photon down-shifting via energy transfer involving Nd3+ and Yb3+ for photonics applications has recently attracted interest. For example, optical temperature sensing has been demonstrated using this scheme in Y2SiO514 and LiLa0.9−xNd0.1YbxP4O1215 crystalline powders. A quantum cutting phenomenon in Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped in YF3 has been investigated for silicon-based solar cell application.16 In this case, photons in the UV spectral region are absorbed by Nd3+ ions and the loaded energy is transferred simultaneously to two Yb3+ ions. This process involves at least three RE ions and it needs high doping levels, which in turn may quench the luminescence by energy back-transfer processes. In a recent report, near-infrared photon down-shifting has been studied in Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped Al4B2O9 crystalline powders for potential use in solar cells and near-infrared lasers.17 The authors have found energy transfer efficiencies in the range 13–37%, which are not very high. The use of Yb3+ doped systems as near-infrared tuneable diode-pumped high-power lasers is well established.18 However, the fact that Yb3+ has only one 4f excited state has somehow limited the use of external pump sources because of the narrow spectral absorption range. In this case, Nd3+ may be a convenient sensitizer of short-wavelength pump radiation as long as efficient energy transfer to Yb3+ takes place. In all examples given here, engineering host materials with superior Nd3+ → Yb3+ energy transfer efficiencies is of paramount importance. Furthermore, a promising host material for luminescent RE elements must have phonons of low energy to decrease the probability of nonradiative (multiphonon) relaxation of electronic states. Fluorides have low phonon energy and relatively high chemical stability. Among such materials, strontium fluoride (SrF2) has been widely investigated due to various advantages such as low cut-off phonon (Raman frequency in the range 300–350 cm−1), favourable thermal and chemical stability, and ability to generate strong luminescence at different wavelengths.1,12,19,20 Successful fabrication of RE doped SrF2 crystalline powders using different chemical methods has been reported.4,19–21 A few years ago, our group showed the successful production of SrF2 crystalline powders using the combustion synthesis (CS) technique.22 The advantages of the CS method include simple and cheap apparatus, direct crystallization of small particles under low processing temperature and short processing time. In the same report, we showed that the inclusion of aluminum (Al3+) produced a reduction of the Raman frequency to 256 cm−1. As a consequence, luminescence enhancement was observed in erbium (Er3+) doped SrF2 powder samples especially when glycine was used as the fuel in the combustion process.
Because of the aforementioned interest in near-infrared photon down-shifting involving Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped systems for photonics applications, we investigate in the present work the energy transfer process involving Nd3+ and Yb3+ in SrF2 crystalline powders prepared by CS. Based on our previous study,22 the inclusion of Al3+ in the matrix and the use of glycine as the fuel were employed to guarantee high luminescence.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials preparation
The Nd3+ doped and Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powders were prepared by the CS technique using reagent-grade neodymium nitrate Nd(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%, Aldrich), ytterbium nitrate Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99%, Sigma), aluminum nitrate Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99%, Sigma), and strontium nitrate Sr(NO3)3 (99.9%, Aldrich). The fuel used was glycine C2H5NO2 (Sigma, 99.5%). After dissolving the metal nitrates, in an appropriate molar ratio, in a minimum amount of de-ionized water to form a mixed solution, an appropriate amount of glycine is added while keeping the mixed solution under constant stirring at room temperature. This process takes about 5 minutes. Then, an aqueous solution of ammonium fluoride NH4F (Sigma, p.a.) is added dropwise under constant stirring, at room temperature, and after about 10 minutes a milky solution is obtained. After that, the resultant solution is placed in a furnace preheated at 500 °C for 25 minutes, until excess free water evaporates and spontaneous ignition occurs resulting in a fine foamy powder product which is grounded. Finally, the as-prepared powders undergo heat-treatment at 700 °C for 3 h in an air atmosphere to eliminate surface residues and complete the crystallization process. The as-prepared concentrations of Nd3+ and Al3+ were fixed at 0.7 and 6.9 mol%, respectively, for optimized luminescence yield. The Yb3+ doping concentrations were 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.1 mol%.
2.2 Materials characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were obtained using an Inel Equinox-1000 diffractometer (60 mA, 60 kV) equipped with a nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 1.540 Å) source. Surface morphology was investigated using a VEGA 3 TESCAN Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) coupled to an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) detector from Oxford Instruments. Images were obtained using a backscattering electron detector in the charge-up reduction mode.
Optical absorption was observed using a diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 300). Stokes luminescence was obtained using a Nd:YAG Q-switched (5 ns, 10 Hz) pumped OPO laser system (Opotek Vibrant 355 II) as the excitation source. The excitation (λ = 750 nm) laser beam was directed to the sample surface and luminescence was collected in a reflection mode by an optical fibre attached to a compact spectrometer (ocean optics USB4000). For lifetime measurements, the luminescence collected by the fibre probe was sent to a spectrograph (Horiba Micro-HR) attached to a Si amplified detector (PDA 36A-EC Thorlabs) or a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R928). The electronic signal was processed using an oscilloscope (Tektronics TDS 2012B) connected to a personal computer. The software used to analyse the data was Origin 8.0. All the experiments were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure, morphology, and optical absorption
The XRPD data for Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder samples prepared by CS are shown in Fig. 1. The heat-treated samples with well-defined diffraction peaks and very small background noise are fully crystallized, demonstrating that the crystallization process is complete. The diffraction patterns are similar for different samples and the diffraction peaks are identified in the pure face-centered cubic phase (space group: Fm3m) using the standard data for SrF2 (JCPDS no. 06-0262). The inset shows the structural analysis by the SEM technique on one of the Nd3+:Yb3+ (0.7:0.5 mol%) co-doped SrF2 powders. The SEM image shows that the surface is highly irregular and porous, characteristic of samples that underwent a drastic reaction such as the one involved in the combustion process. EDXS data (not shown) confirm the RE doping amounts and element distribution.

Fig. 2 shows the baseline-filtered absorption spectrum in the range from 500 to 1030 nm for the Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder sample shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum shows absorption bands similar to those of other reported Nd3+ doped systems.23 Absorption lines related to the intraband 4fN ground-state to excited-state transitions of Nd3+, more specifically 4I9/2 → 4G9/2, 4G7/2, 2K13/2 at 500–550 nm, 4I9/2 → 4G5/2, 2G5/2 at 585 nm, 4I9/2 → 4F9/2 at 683 nm, 4I9/2 → 4F7/2, 4S3/2 at 750 nm, and 4I9/2 → 4F5/2, 2H9/2 at 805 nm are clearly observed. Absorption bands from 850 to 1035 nm are due to both RE ions, 4I9/2 → 4F3/2 (at 890 nm) of Nd3+ and 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 (at 980 nm) of Yb3+.

3.2 Luminescence properties

Fig. 3 shows the luminescence spectrum of the Nd3+ (0.7 mol%) doped SrF2 powder under near-infrared (λ = 750 nm) excitation resonant with, according to Fig. 2, the 4I9/2 → 4F7/2, 4S3/2 transition of Nd3+. From the recorded emission spectra, a broad down-converted (Stokes) luminescence emission band (∼850–930 nm) is observed with four Stark components, corresponding to 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transitions.
 Fig. 3  Stokes luminescence spectrum of the Nd3+ singly doped SrF2 powder sample obtained under near-infrared (λ = 750 nm) excitation at room temperature. The inset of the figure shows the partial energy level diagram of Nd3+ ions indicating the Starks levels involved in the observed transitions. 

Fig. 4 shows the luminescence spectra of Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powders with Yb3+ doping concentration varying from 0.1 to 1.1 mol%. The spectra are displayed for the same excitation wavelength as in Fig. 3 (λ = 750 nm). It is observed that the intensity of the emission band corresponding to the transition 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 of Nd3+ (∼850–930 nm) decreases while the intensity of the emission band corresponding to the transition 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 of Yb3+ (∼925–1025 nm) first increases and then quenches with Yb3+ doping concentration.
 Fig. 4  Stokes luminescence spectra of Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder samples under near-infrared (λ = 750 nm) excitation at room temperature. 
The appearance of 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition from Yb3+ in our Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 samples suggests the existence of an energy transfer mechanism from Nd3+ to Yb3+ ions, as Yb3+ ions are insensitive to radiation at λ = 750 nm. According to the Förster–Dexter theory,24,25 the criterion for an energy transfer to take place is the spectral overlap between a donor emission band and an acceptor absorption band. Fig. 5 shows the luminescence spectrum of our Nd3+ doped SrF2 powder sample and the absorption spectrum of one of our Yb3+ doped SrF2 powders. The emission spectrum corresponding to the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transition of Nd3+ presents a clear overlap in the spectral range 10400–11360 cm−1 with the absorption band of Yb3+ (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) indicating the possibility of energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+.

To confirm the presence of the energy transfer mechanism, the luminescence decay curves of the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transition of Nd3+ doped SrF2 powders under pulsed excitation at λ = 750 nm were analysed. Luminescence lifetime can be written as τ = 1/(AR + ANR + AET), where AR is the radiative decay rate, ANR is the nonradiative decay rate, and AET is the energy transfer rate. The first two terms are electronic population relaxation channels intrinsic of isolated species while the third term represents relaxation via interaction among species (having a probability that decreases with the sixth power of the distance among the species). Fig. 6 depicts the luminescence decay curves monitored at λ = 860 nm (4F3/2 → 4I9/2) for Nd3+ singly doped (0.7 mol%) and Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped (0.7:0.5 mol%) samples. The decay curve in the co-doped sample is clearly shorter than the decay curve in the sample containing only Nd3+. Note that the doping concentration of Nd3+ is 0.7 mol% for both samples and therefore the shortening of lifetime is attributed to the presence of Yb3+, which interacts with Nd3+via the energy transfer channel [Nd3+]4F3/2 + [Yb3+]2F7/2 → [Nd3+]4I9/2 + [Yb3+]2F5/2. The fact that the intensity of the emission band corresponding to the transition 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 of Nd3+ decreases while the intensity of the emission band corresponding to the transition 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 of Yb3+ increases confirms the presence of this Nd3+ → Yb3+ energy transfer channel. The luminescence decay time of Nd3+ in the absence of Yb3+ fits well with a simple exponential decay profile and the value obtained was τ = 1.1 ms (shown in the inset). The decay curve in the co-doped powder is non-exponential and in this case the decay time constant was estimated by using the following equation:17,26 (1)where I(t0) is the maximum intensity at the initial time t0. The values found for τ were ≈0.89, 0.55 and 0.42 ms and the calculated values of AET were ≈215, 909, and 1472 s−1 for samples containing 0.7:0.1, 0.7:0.2, and 0.7:0.5 wt% of Nd3+:Yb3+, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Luminescence decay curve of the state 4F3/2 of Nd3+ doped (0.7 mol%) SrF2 powders with and without Yb3+ (0.5 mol%) and obtained by excitation using a pulsed laser at λ = 750 nm. The inset shows the log scale of the lifetime decay curve of Nd3+ singly doped (0.7 mol%) SrF2 powder fitted using a single exponential decay function. 
The energy transfer efficiency was estimated by17,26 (2)where τ1 and τ0 are the decay times of Nd3+ luminescence in a sample with and without Yb3+. The values found were 61.8, 50.3 and 19.1% for samples containing 0.7:0.5, 0.7:0.2, and 0.7:0.1 mol% of Nd3+:Yb3+, respectively. These values are comparatively higher than those found in ref. 17, which presented energy transfer efficiencies in the range 13–37%. We believe that the choice of the host matrix is mainly responsible for the higher values of ϑET obtained in our samples. In Al4B2O9, Nd3+ and Yb3+ replace Al3+ at specific cation sites while in SrF2 the rare-earth trivalent ions will generally form clusters27–29 for charge compensation when Sr2+ is substituted by Nd3+ and Yb3+. The consequence is a high probability of energy transfer between the rare-earth ions as they may be in close proximity.
The sample that showed quenching of Yb3+ luminescence (see Fig. 4) was not included in our decay time analysis of Nd3+ luminescence. The luminescence quenching of Yb3+ may be due to the formation of Yb3+ clusters at high Yb3+ doping levels, which favours cooperative up-conversion phenomena at Yb3+ pair sites.30
The presence of quenching centres for the sample containing 1.1 mol% of Yb3+ was confirmed by analysing the emission decay curves of Yb3+ 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition for co-doped Nd3:Yb3+ SrF2 samples containing 0.7:0.5 and 0.7:1.1 mol%. Fig. 7 shows the results and each of the decay curves was well fitted with a single exponential decay function. The luminescence lifetime for the sample with 0.5 mol% of Yb3+ was τ = 2.1 ms and for the sample with 1.1 mol% of Yb3+ was τ = 0.85 ms.
 Fig. 7  Luminescence decay curve of the state 2F5/2 of Yb3+ for Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powders with two different Yb3+ doping concentrations. The excitation was a pulsed laser tuned to λ = 750 nm. The lifetime decay curves were fitted using a single exponential decay function. 
In order to determine the governing mechanism responsible for the Nd3+ → Yb3+ energy transfer, the Nd3+ luminescence non-exponential decay curves were fitted following the Inokuti–Hirayama model.31 In the case of electric multipolar interaction, the emission intensity of the donor state changes with time according to the following equation: (3)where I0 is the intensity at t = 0, τ0 is the lifetime of the donor (level 4F3/2 of Nd3+) in the absence of acceptors (Yb3+), γs is the energy transfer parameter and s is the multipolar interaction parameter with s = 6 for dipole–dipole, s = 8 for dipole–quadrupole and s = 10 for quadrupole–quadrupole interaction. Eqn (3) can be rearranged to be written as (4) In this case, s can be found by fitting a linear function to the data of P(t) as a function of t in a log–log scale graph. The experimental data of the decay curve emission of Nd3+ (4F3/2 → 4I9/2) in Nd3+:Yb3+ (0.7:0.5 mol%) co-doped SrF2 powder (Fig. 7) were used in the plot of P(t) versus t and the results are shown in Fig. 8. The best fit value found for s was 10.9, which is very close to the value expected for a quadrupole–quadrupole interaction.

The inset shows the plot of log{−ln[I(t)/I0] − (t/τ0)} versus log(t) and the linear fit used to find the multipolar interaction parameter s. 
After identifying the multipolar character of the energy transfer process, we estimated the critical distance R0 of energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+ using the concentration quenching method suggested by Blasse32 and calculated using the following equation: (5)where C0 is the critical concentration, V is the volume of the unit cell, N is the number of available cation sites for the dopant in the unit cell (in this case, N = 4). For pure face-centered cubic phase (space group: Fm3m) of the SrF2 host, the crystallographic data give us a volume of V ≈ 194.1 Å3. The critical concentration C0 is estimated for the sample with the highest luminescence intensity of Yb3+, i.e. for 0.7:0.5 mol% of Nd3+:Yb3+. The critical energy transfer distance R0 between Nd3+ to Yb3+ ions was found to be ∼17 Å. This result suggests that the energy transfer mechanism in this system is governed by electrostatic interaction as the exchange interaction dominates at critical distances shorter than 5 Å between the sensitizer and the activator.
To confirm that the energy transfer process from Nd3+ to Yb3+ is of quadrupole–quadrupole type, we used the method based on Dexter's energy transfer formula of multipolar interaction and Reisfeld's approximation:33,34 (6)where I0 and I are the emission intensities of the Nd3+ ions without and with the presence of Yb3+, respectively, and C is the total dopant concentration of Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions. The plots of I0/I vs. Cn/3 for Nd3+:Yb3+ (0.7:0.1; 0.7:0.2; 0.7:0.5 mol%) co-doped SrF2 samples, excited at λ = 750 nm and with the luminescence monitored at λ = 860 nm, are shown in Fig. 9. The best linear behaviour is found for n = 10, based on the goodness of fit, indicating that the energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+ ions occurs via quadrupole–quadrupole interaction.

Left: n = 6, center: n = 8, and right: n = 10. Chi-square values of the fits were 0.056 (left), 0.054 (center), and 0.050 (right). 
4. Conclusions
Nd3+ doped and Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 ceramic powders containing Al3+ and prepared via a simple combustion synthesis route showed near-infrared Stokes emission from Nd3+ (transition 4F3/2 → 4I9/2) and from Yb3+ (transition 2F5/2 → 2F7/2) under excitation at λ = 750 nm. The spectral and temporal analyses of luminescence suggested the presence of energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+ ions. By the application of the Inokuti–Hirayama method in the experimental luminescence dynamics, electrostatic quadrupole–quadrupole interactions are found to be responsible for the occurrence of energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+ ions in SrF2. The high energy transfer efficiency found for this system (around 62%) is attributed to the formation of rare-earth clusters in SrF2 and suggests their potential use as near-infrared light sources for photonics applications.

 	Fig. 1  XRPD pattern of Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder samples heat-treated at 700 °C for 3 hours. Vertical numbers indicate hkl Miller indices. Inset: SEM image for the Nd3+:Yb3+ (0.7:0.5 mol%) co-doped SrF2 powder sample prepared by combustion synthesis. Full scale bar is 10 μm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Optical absorption of one of the Nd3+:Yb3+ (0.7:0.5 mol%) co-doped SrF2 powder samples prepared by combustion synthesis. The bands are assigned to the ground state to excited state 4fN transitions of Nd3+ and Yb3+.	 

 	Fig. 3  Stokes luminescence spectrum of the Nd3+ singly doped SrF2 powder sample obtained under near-infrared (λ = 750 nm) excitation at room temperature. The inset of the figure shows the partial energy level diagram of Nd3+ ions indicating the Starks levels involved in the observed transitions.	 

 	Fig. 4  Stokes luminescence spectra of Nd3+:Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 powder samples under near-infrared (λ = 750 nm) excitation at room temperature.	 

 	Fig. 5  Luminescence spectrum of Nd3+ and the absorption spectrum of Yb3+ in SrF2 powders prepared by combustion synthesis.
