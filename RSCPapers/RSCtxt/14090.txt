    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 16th August 2018AbstractThe development of stable noble metal-free photocatalysts with efficient separation and transportation of the photogenerated electrons–holes is of crucial importance for promoting the application of photocatalysis technology. Herein, we propose an electron transfer strategy by reasonable design and fabrication of novel 0D NiSx nanosheets as a co-catalyst on the surface of 1D CdS nanorods (CdS-NRs) to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evaluation and contamination (Cr(VI), rhodamine B and bisphenol A) removal in water. Under visible light irradiation, the 0D–1D NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite with 1.5% NiSx loading gave a hydrogen evolution rate of 5.98 mmol h−1 g−1, which is about 5.3 times and 1.9 times higher than that of the native CdS-NRs and the optimal 1% Pt/CdS-NRs, respectively. Notably, good stability in the recycling test and a high apparent quantum efficiency of about 69.9% at 420 nm were also obtained. The 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs exhibited enhanced photocatalytic contamination degradation efficiency of about 2 times higher than pure CdS-NRs. In this hybrid photocatalyst, 0D NiSx nanosheets came into intimate interfacial contact with the surface of 1D CdS-NRs and played a similar role as noble metals, which could effectively improve the separation, transportation efficiencies and lifetime of photogenerated charge, and thus enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS-NRs with more efficient conversion of solar energy. This work shows not only a possibility for the utilization of noble metal-free NiSx as a co-catalyst in the photocatalysis, but also provides new insight into the design and fabrication of high-performance composite photocatalysts (such as NiSx/g-C3N4 and NiSx/Zn3In2S6).
1. Introduction
The increased consumption of fossil-derived oil and serious environmental pollution as well as global climate change have become worldwide issues.1–3 For example, the total world consumption of petroleum and other liquids reached 96.95 million barrels per day in 2016 and continues to climb annually (98.5 million barrels per day in 2017).2 Emissions of CO2 had increased to 41.5 ± 4.4 billion tones in 2017.3 To address the above current problems, semiconductor photocatalysis as a promising method has attracted increasing interest due to the possibility of converting solar energy into green chemical energy and environmental remediation.4–8 Since Fujishima and Honda9 reported that H2 could be produced on TiO2 by photoelectrocatalytic splitting of water, various photocatalysts such as metal sulfides, metal oxides, metal oxynitrides and metal-free semiconductors have been explored,10–14 while the development of highly efficient, visible-light driven and stable noble metal-free photocatalysts is still considered to be central to promoting the application of photocatalysis.
Recently, CdS is of increasing interest in applications such as solar energy conversion and photocatalysis due to its optimal band gap (2.4 eV) for efficient utilization of visible light, suitable band structure for the reduction of protons (H+) to H2, low-cost and simple preparation method.15–21 However, the individual CdS exhibited very low photocatalytic performance due to poor photostability, high activation energy (over-potential) and rapid recombination of photoexcited electrons (e−) and holes (h+).17–21 High-efficiency photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 is indeed a hard process. To obtain highly active photocatalysts for H2 evolution, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the designing of CdS-based photocatalysts in the last few decades.18–28 Loading noble metals as the co-catalyst onto the photocatalyst has proven to be an effective method,25–28 which can dramatically lower the over-potential and improve the separation and transportation of photoexcited electrons–holes, thus remarkably enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Nonetheless, the scarcity and the high price of noble metals greatly limit their large-scale application as co-catalysts in practical photocatalytic H2 evolution.17–20 Therefore, seeking highly efficient and inexpensive Earth-abundant materials as co-catalysts is of great urgency at present.29 Fortunately, some co-catalysts based on Earth-abundant transition-metal elements including Co,30,31 Mo,18,32 Ni,19–21,33–40 Cu,41 and W42,43 and their corresponding oxides, sulfides or phosphides with low-cost have been explored and demonstrated high activity for assistance to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution of the host photocatalyst. Among them, NiS, a low bandgap semiconductor, has been considered as a potential alternative to noble metals due to its friendliness to the environment, high electrical conductivity and high power conversion efficiency, such as on CdS,33–38 g-C3N4,40 and ZnxCd1−xS.44
Despite remarkable progress, the efficiency of NiS-based composites reported so far is very limited because NiS is a p-type semiconductor, while photocatalysts (such as CdS and g-C3N4) are generally n-type semiconductors. It is easy for NiS and the host photocatalyst to generate p–n junctions, which can facilitate the separation of photoexcited electrons–holes due to the presence of built-in electric fields from the host photocatalyst to NiS. Specifically, the built-in electric field can promote the transportation of photoexcited electrons from NiS to the host photocatalyst, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.33 However, the photoexcited electrons produced on the host photocatalyst cannot be transferred, and the high electrocatalytic H2 evolution activity of NiS cannot be expected from photocatalytic H2 evolution. Consequently, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of such p–n heterostructures could only be enhanced to a limited degree.19,33 That is to say, the ideal structure model of the NiS-based composite photocatalyst is that the photoexcited electrons can transfer from the host photocatalyst to NiS. In order to achieve this, β-NiS has been brought up because of its remarkable electrical conductivity. For example, Peng et al.36 prepared β-NiS film modified CdS nanoflowers with a high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 43% at 420 nm at 25 °C. However, the crystalline phase of NiS in the reported NiS/CdS photocatalysts19,33 and other NiS-based composites40,44 is commonly α-NiS or a mixture of α-NiS and β-NiS because of the difficult preparation of pure β-NiS. Alternatively, NiSx may be a promising candidate to replace β-NiS because: (1) it is easy to prepare NiSx;34,38,45–47 (2) NiSx possesses remarkable electrical conductivity and higher work function than CdS (so the photoexcited electrons produced on CdS could be transferred to NiSx);46 (3) NiSx shows the lowest activation energy to form a Ni–H bond which is conducive to the adsorption–reduction–desorption process of H2.45,47 However, a moderate AQE was observed on CdS/NiSx photocatalysts. Qin et al.34 first prepared CdS/NiSx photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution, showing a high AQE of 60.4% at 420 nm but at 35 °C. Later on, Xu et al.38 proposed a self-template synthetic strategy for the fabrication of CdS/NiSx nanohybrids by using Cd(II)–Ni(II)-(4,4′-bipyridine) coordination polymers as the template and precursor, exhibiting an AQE of 16.8% at 420 nm at 20 °C. In the previous reports,34,38 NiSx particles are prone to precipitate onto the surface of CdS (Na2S and NaOH used in the preparation process might accelerate the precipitation of NiSx), and the reported NiSx/CdS composites are usually composed of bulk-shaped morphology or building blocks. These greatly limit the contact area and the transfer of photoexcited electrons–holes, and thus the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain highly active NiSx/CdS hybrid photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation at room temperature.
To address these problems, we herein develop a simple and efficient hydrothermal process to fabricate a composite photocatalyst (NiSx/CdS-NRs) with 0D ultrafine NiSx nanosheet modified 1D CdS nanorods (CdS-NRs). Herein, 1D CdS nanorods other than bulk or building blocks were selected as the scaffold, because 1D nanostructures have unique advantages such as a short radial distance for the separation and transportation of photoexcited electrons–holes.48 To control the growth of NiSx on the surface of CdS-NRs, thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) instead of Na2S used in the previous report38 was chosen as the sulfur source of NiSx. The optimally prepared NiSx/CdS-NRs exhibit high efficiency and photostability for photocatalytic H2 evolution in lactic acid solution under visible light (λ > 400 nm), reaching an H2 evolution rate of about 5.98 mmol h−1 g−1 at 10 °C (the AQE is approximately 69.9% at 420 nm). Notably, this approach is versatile for the application of other NiSx/semiconductor photocatalysts (such as NiSx/g-C3N4 and NiSx/Zn3In2S6) with high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Moreover, a significant enhancement of photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and organic pollutant (rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA)) degradation could also be obtained over NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposites. The probable mechanism was further determined by the photoelectrochemical method, time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra and electron spin resonance (ESR), which indicates that NiSx is an efficient co-catalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution and contaminant removal in water under visible light irradiation.
2. Experimental section
Cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 99%), thiourea (CS(NH2)2, 99.0%), ethylenediamine (C2H4(NH2)2, >99%), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 99%), L-(+)-lactic acid (C3H6O3, ≥98%), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Pt ≥37.5%), anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99.0%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%), potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate (K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 99.0%), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2, ≥98.0%), potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6, ≥99.5%) and commercial cadmium sulfide (CdS, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and used without further purification. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was obtained from Sigma Co. Deionized water was used throughout this work.
2.1. Preparation of photocatalysts
CdS-NRs were prepared via a solvothermal method. In the experimental procedures, 10 mmol Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 30 mmol CS(NH2)2 were dissolved in 60 mL C2H4(NH2)2 by ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. Subsequently, the above solution was transferred into a 100 mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to ambient temperature naturally, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven.
NiSx/CdS-NR samples were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Typically, 0.08 mmol Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 0.08 mmol CH3CSNH2 and 0.5 g CdS nanorods were dispersed in 60 mL distilled water. After being stirred for 2 h, the above mixture was transferred into a 100 mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 10 h. The obtained precipitates were collected by centrifugation and rinsed with distilled water. The final product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
For comparison, (1) commercial CdS (CdS-C) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and the obtained 1.5% NiSx modified CdS-C was denoted as 1.5% NiSx/CdS-C. (2) CdS nanoparticles (CdS-NPs) were synthesized using a Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and CS(NH2)2 mixed aqueous solution under the same experimental conditions as CdS-NRs and the obtained 1.5% NiSx modified CdS-NPs were denoted as 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NPs. (3) A Pt loaded CdS-NR (Pt/CdS-NR) sample was prepared by an in situ photodeposition method using a CdS-NR and H2PtCl6 mixed suspension solution under visible light irradiation.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). UV-visible diffuse reflection spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded using a Hitachi UV-365 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as a reference. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by field emission SEM on a FEI Nova NANOSEM 230 spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were performed on a JEM-ARM200F electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. High-angle annual dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and elemental mapping images were obtained on a FEI Titan Themis 200 equipped with a Bruker super-X energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDX). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 3.0 × 10−10 mbar using an Al Kα X-ray beam (1486.6 eV). All binding energies were corrected with reference to the C 1s peak of the surface adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the as-prepared samples were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were recorded on a RF530 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Japan). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the active species spin-trapped by DMPO were recorded by using a Bruker model A300 spectrometer.
The photoelectrochemical tests were carried out on a three-electrode system (CHI-660E, CH Instruments, USA). A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The sample powder was deposited on the fluoride tin oxide (FTO, 14 Ω cm−2, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) substrate to serve as the working electrode. The 5 mg sample was dispersed in 500 μL of deionized water by sonication to obtain a uniform slurry. Then, the 20 μL slurry was deposited as a film on a 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm FTO substrate. After drying at room temperature, the working electrode was obtained. A quartz cell filled with 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used as the reaction system for the measurement of transient photocurrent responses and open circuit potentials of the samples. 0.1 M KCl electrolyte containing 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] was applied to the test of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of the samples. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) equipped with an optical filter (λ > 400 nm) was used as a visible light source. The lifetime (τ) of the photoexcited electrons was calculated by using the formula:49τ = (kBT/e) (dVOC/dt)−1.kB, T, e and t are the Boltzmann's constant (1.3806 × 10−23 J K−1), the temperature (298.15 K), the charge of one electron (1.602 × 10−19 C) and time, respectively.
2.3. Photocatalytic reaction
The photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system (LabSolar H2, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China).18 In a typical experiment, 0.1 g catalyst powder was dispersed in a 110 mL aqueous solution containing 1.22 M lactic acid as the sacrificial reagent. The whole reaction system was then evacuated using a mechanical pump several times to remove system air and the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium before irradiation. Then the suspension was irradiated using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) equipped with an optical filter (λ > 400 nm) to cut off ultraviolet light. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at about 10 °C by a flow of cooling water. The evolved H2 amount was determined by on-line gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC7900-TianMei, molecular sieve 5A column, Ar carrier). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hydrogen generation is calculated according to the following equation: AQE = Ne/Np × 100% = (2 × NH/Np) × 100%(1)where Ne, NH and Np are the numbers of reacted electrons, evolved H2 molecules and incident photons, respectively.
The photocatalytic removal of contamination (Cr(VI), rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA)) in the aqueous solution was performed in a quartz cell. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) equipped with an optical filter (λ > 400 nm) was used as the visible light source. The 0.05 g photocatalyst was added into 50 mL of contamination solution (40 ppm K2Cr2O7, 10 ppm RhB and 10 ppm BPA). In particular, the reaction system was under an N2 atmosphere for photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). After pretreatment to reach the equilibrium of adsorption–desorption in the dark for about 30 min, 3 mL of reaction solution was sampled at given time intervals under visible light irradiation, and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles. The pellucid solution was then detected by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Persee TU-1950).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the NiSx/CdS-NR composite

Fig. 1 shows the results of microstructural characterization of the as-prepared CdS-NR sample. The as-prepared CdS-NRs with nanorod-like morphology could be clearly observed in Fig. 1a and b. Further HRTEM observation (Fig. 1c) shows the resolved lattice fringes for the prepared CdS-NRs and the measured lattice spacing (0.34 nm) corresponds to a typical d-spacing value for the (002) plane of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 41-1049).18 This indicates that the CdS-NRs grow along the direction of the c-axis and possess high crystallinity. The XRD pattern of the CdS-NRs as shown in Fig. 2 also indicates that the prepared CdS-NRs are in a high crystallinity structure and the diffraction peaks are in agreement with hexagonal CdS with lattice parameters of a = 4.1 Å and c = 6.7 Å. The main diffraction peaks at about 24.8°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 36.6°, 43.7°, 47.8°, 50.9°, 51.8°, 52.8°, 54.6° and 58.3° can be indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (004) and (202) planes of hexagonal CdS, respectively. No impurity peaks are found, indicating the high purity of the CdS-NR sample. For the pure NiS sample, the diffraction peaks are located at 30.0°, 34.5°, 45.8° and 53.2°, corresponding to the (100), (101), (102) and (110) lattice planes of hexagonal NiS (JCPDS No. 65-0830), respectively. However, no NiS phase is detected in the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR composite, which may be due to the low content of NiSx and high dispersion of NiSx deposited on the surface of the CdS-NRs. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the NiSx/CdS-NR composite fabricated by the hydrothermal method exhibit no appreciable difference compared with pure CdS-NRs, revealing that the hydrothermal process probably did not change the crystal lattice of CdS-NRs.

To obtain more information (microstructure and identification of NiSx), the typical NiSx/CdS-NR sample was investigated by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, HAADF-STEM and EDX elemental mapping. As shown in Fig. 3a, it can be seen that the morphology of the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR composite is similar to that of pure CdS-NRs. This morphological feature of the NiSx/CdS-NR composite can be further confirmed by the TEM image in Fig. 3b. However, unlike pure CdS-NRs, there are many nanoclusters with a diameter of about 5 nm dispersed on the surface of CdS-NRs. In order to identify these nanoclusters, HRTEM and XPS were applied, as shown in Fig. 3c–e. The larger interplanar spacing (0.31 nm), displayed in Fig. 3d, than that of the (100) plane (0.29 nm) in NiS as well as the defective lattice arrangement implies the formation of NiSx.45 The XPS survey spectrum of the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs demonstrates the existence of Ni (Fig. S1†), and the content of NiSx in the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs has been found to be about 1.36%. Moreover, binding energies at around 872.7 and 855.2 eV indicate the higher valence state of Ni species other than Ni2+ (Fig. 3e).45 While the peaks at 870.2 and 852.7 eV belong to NiS, and two peaks observed at 878.8 and 860.8 eV could be assigned to the satellite peaks. Consequently, the defective lattice arrangement and the higher binding energies of Ni compared to those of NiS directly demonstrate the formation of NiSx. These results are consistent with the observed data of the NiSx/Cd0.5Zn0.5S composite.45

To investigate the dispersion of Cd, S and Ni elements, spatially resolved EDX mapping images (Fig. 3g–i) were scanned as shown in Fig. 3f. It can be observed that Cd and S signal dots are dense and throughout the nanorods, while the density of the Ni signal dots is quite low as the content is less than 1.5% but distributed mainly on the nanorods. More importantly, it is clear to see that NiSx nanoclusters are in close contact with the CdS-NRs (Fig. 3c), which would facilitate photoexcited electron–hole separation and promote the photocatalytic H2 evolution. However, when the content of NiSx reached up to 10% in the NiSx/CdS-NR composite, the surface of the CdS-NRs is covered by large and excessive amounts of NiSx nanosheets (Fig. S2†). A lower contact area between NiSx and CdS-NRs would reduce the photocatalytic activity because the interfacial contact area of the photocatalyst and co-catalyst plays a major role in improving the separation efficiency of the photoexcited electrons–holes as well as enhancing the photocatalytic activity.19,38
3.2. Evaluation of the photocatalytic activity

3.2.1. Photocatalytic H2 evolution. 
The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the prepared CdS-NR and NiSx/CdS-NR composites with a different content of NiSx (0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 3% and 10%) was investigated under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). Fig. 4 shows the average rates of H2 production during the first 3 h reaction over CdS-NR, NiSx/CdS-NR and NiSx samples in 1.22 M lactic acid solution. Clearly, the pure CdS-NRs have a relatively low activity with a H2 evolution rate of only 1120 μmol h−1 g−1, although it has strong visible light response. It is similar to the previous reports for photocatalytic H2 evolution over the CdS photocatalyst.18–20,33–39 The poor activity of the pure CdS greatly limits its applications. Although the NiSx sample was not active for H2 evolution, a significant enhancement of the activity for H2 evolution with a volcano-like distribution could be obtained by loading NiSx onto the CdS-NR photocatalyst.
 Fig. 4  Activity comparison of different samples. Reaction conditions: 0.1 g photocatalyst, 110 mL of aqueous solution of lactic acid (1.22 M), a 300 W Xe-lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter. 
The highest H2 evolution rate (5890 μmol h−1 g−1) was achieved on the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR sample, which is approximately 5.3 times that of the pure CdS-NR sample. When the weight ratio of NiSx was further increased, the H2 production activity decreased. For 10% NiSx/CdS-NRs, the H2 production rate was just about 2010 μmol h−1 g−1. It has also been reported that an optimum loading of the co-catalyst is necessary to produce maximum activity in composite photocatalysts.18–20 This phenomenon in this work could be attributed to the following factors: (i) excessive amounts of NiSx nanosheets covered on the surface of CdS-NRs may shield the incident light and result in a decrease in the surface active sites of CdS-NRs, thus hindering the generation of electrons from the inside of CdS-NRs and photoexcited electron–hole separation, respectively;33 (ii) pure NiSx shows no H2 production activity under the same conditions.
It has been reported that 1D nanostructures can provide direct pathways for charge transport and facilitate photoexcited charge separation, thus exhibiting high photocatalytic activity.48 To illustrate this point, CdS nanoparticles (CdS-NPs) prepared by a hydrothermal method and commercial CdS (CdS-C) were used to prepare NiSx/CdS-NPs and NiSx/CdS-C composite photocatalysts. From Fig. S3 and S4,† it is clear that both CdS-NPs and CdS-C exhibit an irregular nanoparticle-like shape. Apparently, NiSx/CdS-NRs show much higher photocatalytic activity than NiSx/CdS-NP (179 μmol h−1 g−1) and NiSx/CdS-C (1560 μmol h−1 g−1) samples (Fig. 4). This result clearly demonstrates that the unique 1D nanostructure of the CdS is important for the high H2 evolution rate of the NiSx/CdS nanocomposite. Previous reports17,18 have also demonstrated that the hexagonal CdS possesses a higher H2 evolution rate than the cubic CdS and the mixture of cubic and hexagonal CdS. Since CdS-NPs are in a mixture phase of cubic and hexagonal and CdS-C is in a pure hexagonal phase (Fig. S5†), no wonder a low H2 evolution rate is observed over the NiSx/CdS-NP sample.
It is reported that noble metal co-catalysts (e.g. Pt,26–28 Au25) loaded on the photocatalyst can effectively promote the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes, providing active sites, and therefore significantly enhance the H2 production rate. Pt is considered as the most effective co-catalyst for CdS because of its high work function and high redox potential.26–28 Therefore, we chose the optimal 1% of Pt to be used as a reference model.33,35 The Pt was in situ deposited onto the CdS-NRs (Pt/CdS-NRs) by injecting H2PtCl6 aqueous solution into the suspension through the irradiation of visible light (λ > 400 nm). To better evaluate the photocatalytic activity, the 1.5% Pt/CdS-NR sample has also been prepared to correspond to the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs. As shown in Fig. S6a,† it can be observed that tiny Pt nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of CdS-NRs, and the deposition amount of Pt is about 1.38% (determined by ICP-MS). From Fig. 4 and Fig. S6b,† both 1% Pt/CdS-NRs and 1.5% Pt/CdS-NRs show significant enhancement of H2 production activity (3120 and 2721 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively), while it is still lower than that of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs. Furthermore, 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite does not show any loss of activity like Pt/CdS-NRs after photoreaction for 9 h (Fig. 5). However, the activity of pure CdS-NRs is decreased because of the known photocorrosion of CdS. Additionally, the used 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs (Fig. S7†) still have a rod-like structure with almost the same shape as the fresh one (Fig. 3a). These results indicate that NiSx is an efficient co-catalyst for CdS-NRs and the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite is a highly efficient and stable catalyst for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution.

We then measured the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) of the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR composite at different light wavelengths by using various band-pass filters in the same reaction solution. As shown in Fig. 6, the trend in AQEs closely follows that of the absorbance, revealing bandgap-transition-dependent H2 evolution behavior. Notably, a high AQE of about 69.9% was obtained at 420 nm. In the previous reports (Table S1†), the CdS/NiSx photocatalyst was first prepared by Qin et al.34 and achieved an AQE of 60.4% at 420 nm at 35 °C. Later on, Xu et al.38 proposed a self-template synthetic strategy to synthesize CdS/NiSx nanohybrids for photocatalytic H2 evolution and reached an AQE of 16.8% at 420 nm at 20 °C. It should be noted that the AQE increases with an increase in reaction temperature.19 Herein, we combined the 1D nanostructure of CdS with 0D nanoclusters of NiSx to fabricate 0D–1D NiSx/CdS nanocomposites for the first time, and a higher AQE of 70.8% was achieved at 10 °C for photocatalytic H2 evolution. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest value among all the NiSx/CdS composite photocatalysts. Based on the above results, it can be concluded briefly that the decoration of NiSx can significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS for H2 evolution with a much higher H2 production rate and more efficient conversion of solar energy.

To illustrate the role of NiSx for improving photocatalytic activity on photocatalysts, the other two hot 2D nanomaterials g-C3N4 (JCPDS No. 87-1526)50 and Zn3In2S6 (JCPDS No. 65-4003)51 were prepared for the synthesis of NiSx/g-C3N4 and NiSx/Zn3In2S6 composites (Fig. S8–S10†). As shown in Fig. S11,† it can be seen that compared with pure g-C3N4 and Zn3In2S6, the H2 evolution rates of both NiSx/g-C3N4 and NiSx/Zn3In2S6 composites are remarkably improved. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activities should be ascribed to the introduction of NiSx as a co-catalyst. Therefore, it is concluded that NiSx coupling onto pure photocatalysts may be a versatile method for improving their photocatalytic H2 evolution. Based on the above encouraging results, noble metal-free NiSx co-catalysts would have great potential to replace the scarce and expensive noble metal Pt for the photocatalytic H2 evolution.


3.2.2. Photocatalytic removal of contamination. 
The photocatalytic reducibility of the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite was further investigated by Cr(VI) reduction in aqueous solution under visible light. To further clarify the activity of the photocatalyst, each of the photocatalytic reactions was carried out after 30 min of adsorption–desorption equilibrium in the dark and the blank test was performed in the absence of photocatalysts (Fig. 7a), both of which indicate negligible change in the substrate concentration. However, in the presence of photocatalysts and visible light, the concentration of Cr(VI) decreased much faster for the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite (Fig. S12a†). The calculated reduction rate constant of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs (0.013 min−1) is about double that of the pure CdS-NRs (0.006 min−1) (Fig. 7a). In particular, the constant of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs would be increased about 2 times when the reaction proceeded at pH = 1 (0.029 min−1). This indicates that Cr(VI) would be easily reduced under acidic conditions. This result is consistent with the phenomenon observed on the CaSb2O5(OH)2 photocatalyst.52

Additionally, the photocatalytic properties of the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite were evaluated by the degradation of RhB solution, in which RhB is a common toxic organic pollutant in printing and dyeing wastewater.53 As shown in Fig. 7b, it can be observed that the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs (1.04 min−1) display a much higher reaction constant than pure CdS-NRs (0.48 min−1). 98.3% of RhB could be degraded under visible light for just 4 min (Fig. S12b†). To avoid the dye-photosensitization effect in photocatalytic contamination removal, BPA was further chosen as another probe molecule to investigate the activity of NiSx/CdS-NRs for photocatalytic degradation of environmental organic pollutants, because it is a typical example of environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs), and it is colorless, refractory, ubiquitous in natural water and pernicious to human beings and wildlife.54 As shown in Fig. S12c† and Fig. 7c, the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite (0.26 h−1) exhibits higher activity for visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of BPA compared to pure CdS-NRs (0.16 h−1). The recycling photoactivity of the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR sample was also tested and shown in Fig. S13† (taking RhB as an example); after the photocatalytic reaction for three cycles, the photodegradation efficiency of RhB over the used 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR sample is similar to that over the fresh 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR photocatalyst, implying its good reusability. These encouraging results authenticate the superiority of the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite not only in photocatalytic H2 evolution but also in photocatalytic contamination removal. Moreover, the effects of active species on contamination degradation (taking RhB as an example) over the 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite were also studied and shown in Fig. 7d. Herein, benzoquinone (BQ), disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and tert-butanol (TBA) were employed as scavengers of superoxide radicals (˙O2−), photogenerated holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), respectively.7,55 It can be observed that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency is significant decreased when BQ was added into the reaction system, while the degradation efficiency is slight suppressed by adding EDTA and TBA (Fig. 7d). This indicates that superoxide radicals play a more important role than holes and hydroxyl radicals for photocatalytic degradation of RhB over the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite. Moreover, superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals have also been determined by the DMPO spin-trapping ESR technique.55 The characteristic peaks of the DMPO-˙O2− and DMPO-˙OH adducts can be observed clearly for the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite under visible light irradiation in Fig. 7e and f, respectively, whereas no such signals can be found in control groups (photocatalyst with DMPO in the dark and DMPO without the photocatalyst under light). This confirmed that superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals were produced in the photocatalytic degradation process. While the ˙OH radicals could come from ˙O2− radicals via chain reactions because the holes in the VB of CdS cannot drive the formation of ˙OH radicals.5 To prove it, a photometric method was employed to verify the existence of H2O2, which is an important intermediate species in this process.55 As shown in Fig. S14,† two strong absorption peaks can be observed over CdS-NRs and NiSx/CdS-NRs after visible light irradiation, indicating H2O2 is indeed produced in the photocatalytic reaction process. Therefore, the ˙OH radicals could be detected by the DMPO spin-trapping ESR technique.

3.3. Influencing factor and the mechanism
Generally, the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst is mainly influenced by three crucial factors: light absorption, surface area (or active site), and photogenerated charge separation and transportation, among which photogenerated charge behavior has been demonstrated as the most crucial factor.56–58 Therefore, a series of characterization methods have been performed to understand the origin of the higher photocatalytic activity of the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution in comparison with that of the individual CdS-NRs.
First, the optical properties of the prepared CdS-NR and 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR samples were studied by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS). As shown in Fig. 8, both of them exhibit similar absorption at λ < 540 nm, which corresponds to the intrinsic absorption of CdS (the bandgap energy is about 2.3 eV). Compared to CdS-NRs, it is clear that the absorption band edge of the NiSx/CdS-NR composite is not shifted. It indicates that nickel ions are not doped into the lattice of the CdS-NRs by cation exchange during the hydrothermal process, but rather precipitated on the surface of the CdS-NRs. This result is in line with the results of the XRD and TEM analysis. It can be explained by the solubility product constant in which CdS has a much lower constant (8.0 × 10−27) than NiS (3.2 × 10−19).35 The absorption level in the visible light region after 540 nm is substantially increased for NiSx/CdS-NRs, which can be observed distinctly by the color change of both samples (the insets in Fig. 8).

Second, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of CdS-NR and 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR samples were measured and the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 8. Type IV isotherms with a H3 hysteresis loop according to the Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller (BDDT) classification can be seen, suggesting the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm) in both samples.59 The wide pore size distributions (inset in Fig. 9) could be attributed to the irregular aggregation (cross and overlap) of CdS-NRs.33 The surface areas of CdS-NRs and 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs are about 21.2 and 18.8 m2 g−1, respectively. The slightly lower BET surface area and pore volume of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs than those of CdS-NRs clearly indicate that the surface area cannot account for the different activity between 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs and CdS-NRs.

Third, the photogenerated charge behavior was characterized by a photoelectrochemical method and a photoluminescence technique.60–64Fig. 10a illustrates the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR and CdS-NR electrodes, and the charge separation and transfer resistance across the solid-state interface layer can be reflected from the semicircles of the EIS plots.60,61 Clearly, both high- and medium-frequency semicircles of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs are smaller than those of CdS-NRs, which implies more effective separation of photoexcited electrons–holes and faster interfacial electron transfer. Fig. 10b shows the transient photocurrent response of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs and CdS-NRs. The much higher photocurrent of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs than that of CdS-NRs under visible light suggests a higher separation efficiency and longer lifetime of photoexcited electrons–holes. Moreover, open circuit photovoltage decay measurement shown in Fig. 10c also indicates the lower recombination rate of the photoexcited electrons–holes and the longer lifetime of the photoexcited electrons of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs than those of CdS-NRs (Fig. 10d). These mutually compatible results are in good agreement with the photocatalytic activity of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs and CdS-NRs.

(c) Illuminated open circuit potential of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR and CdS-NR electrodes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution without a bias versus the Ag/AgCl electrode. (d) Electron lifetime determined from the decay of the open circuit potential in the dark. 
Additionally, the charge recombination and lifetime over 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs have been further verified through physical means (photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL techniques).63–65 Generally, a higher PL intensity indicates a higher recombination rate of photoexcited electrons and holes.63,64 As shown in the inset of Fig. 11, the CdS-NR sample shows an intense PL peak, while the PL intensity of 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs is much weaker. This demonstrates that the recombination of photoexcited electrons–holes on the individual CdS-NRs is rapid but can be efficiently restrained by the deposition of the NiSx co-catalyst. That is an efficient charge transfer process occurred from CdS-NRs to NiSx. The charge transfer behavior was further proved by time-resolved PL spectra.65 The fitting decay curves are shown in Fig. 11. The lifetimes of the photoexcited charge are determined to be about 0.65 and 1.2 ns for CdS-NRs and 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NRs, respectively, confirming efficient charge transfer from CdS-NRs to NiSx.

Based on the above characterization and analysis, the promising photocatalytic H2 evolution performance and photocatalytic contamination removal over the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite could be attributed to the introduction of NiSx nanoclusters decorated on CdS-NRs. As a result, the photoinduced charge can be separated and transferred effectively, leading to the enhancement of the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate and photocatalytic degradation efficiency under visible light irradiation. Thus, mechanisms for the photocatalytic H2 production and photocatalytic contamination removal over the NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite are proposed and shown in Fig. 12. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons (e−) in the valence band of CdS-NRs can be excited to the conduction band, and form holes (h+) in the valence band. Then, the photoexcited electrons could effectively transfer from CdS-NRs to NiSx through the interfacial contact between the CdS-NR and NiSx nanoclusters, and the holes could be consumed by lactic acid molecules,35 suppressing the recombination of the photoexcited electrons–holes and promoting their separation and transportation. Finally, NiSx will catalyze the reduction of H+ to H2, resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the CdS-NRs for H2 evolution. On the other hand for photocatalytic contamination removal, the electrons on CdS-NRs and NiSx would be trapped by Cr(VI) or O2 to produce Cr(III) or ˙O2−, while the holes could oxidize organic pollutants directly and oxidize OH− to form ˙OH. The active species ˙O2−, h+ and ˙OH have strong oxidative ability,5 and thus can degrade environmental contamination.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a 0D–1D NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Under visible light irradiation, the optimal 1.5% NiSx/CdS-NR photocatalyst exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with a H2 production rate of 5890 μmol h−1 g−1, which is about 5.3 times higher than that of the individual CdS-NRs and even higher than a conventional 1% Pt/CdS-NR photocatalyst. Notably, this versatile approach could also be applied in the fabrication of other NiSx/photocatalyst (such as g-C3N4 and Zn3In2S6) nanocomposites with high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Moreover, a significant enhancement of photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and organic pollutant (RhB and BPA) degradation could also be obtained over NiSx/CdS-NR nanocomposites, and the superoxide radical (˙O2−) is the major active species followed by photogenerated holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). These results indicate that NiSx is a good noble metal-free co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The existence of NiSx nanoclusters and the close contact between NiSx and basal CdS-NRs confirmed by XPS and TEM techniques could effectively improve the separation and transportation efficiencies of photoexcited electrons and holes, thus greatly enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production and contamination removal. This study shows a possibility for the utilization of inexpensive and Earth-abundant transition-metal sulfides (TMS) as a substitute for noble metals in the visible-light-driven photocatalysis.
