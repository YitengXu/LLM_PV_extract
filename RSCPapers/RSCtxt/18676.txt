    , Accepted 8th April 2019First published on 10th April 2019AbstractNitrogen (N) doping is an efficient way to modulate the properties of graphene. The reported chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes for synthesizing N-doped graphene mostly involve a metal catalyst and ammonia (NH3) dopant. However, the inevitable metal residual and toxicity of NH3 would significantly hinder its practical applications. In this paper, for the first time, metal-free synthesis of N-doped graphene films on glass was achieved through a plasma-assisted hot filament CVD method using eco-friendly N2 gas as the dopant. Both the hot filament and plasma source were proven to be essential for growing N-doped graphene of preferable quality. By adjusting the N2 flow, the N content, transmittance and electrical properties of graphene films could be facilely modulated. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the electrical voltage induced by dropping ion droplets on graphene glass was significantly improved from 50 mV to 320 mV through N doping, exceeding those of reported graphene based electricity generators. This improvement was attributed to the higher surface potential of N-doped graphene glass compared to the pristine ones, as revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy. The present work provides a promising strategy for direct synthesis and expands applications of N-doped graphene glass for high-efficiency energy harvesting.
1. Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional material consisting of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged on a honeycomb lattice, has attracted great attention due to its outstanding properties and versatile applications.1–3 The heteroelement doping of graphene is of particular interest since it can modify the structural, electrical and chemical properties of graphene.2,4,5 Among numerous potential doping elements, nitrogen (N) possesses a similar atomic size and number of valence electrons to carbon atoms and therefore has been considered as an ideal candidate for graphene doping. To date, various preparation methods have been developed for N-doped graphene.6,7 A widely used synthetic method to obtain large-area uniform N-doped graphene films is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth with the existence of both carbon and N doping precursors on metal-catalytic substrates.6–8 However, such a route usually involves a complicated process for transferring graphene from the metal substrates to target substrates, which would inevitably introduce defects and contamination in graphene films.9,10
Accordingly, the synthesis of graphene films on insulating substrates such as glass, h-BN, SiO2, and Al2O3,11–16 which aims to achieve the direct growth and avoid the quality degradation during the transfer process, has been focused on in recent years. Among these substrates, glass is a good alternative due to its low cost, low thermal conductivity, intrinsic transparency and high surface hydrophilicity.12 Different CVD methods including thermal CVD, electron cyclotron resonance CVD (ECRCVD) and plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) have been reported to fabricate graphene glass successfully.11,13,17,18 Regardless of these successes, research studies on the preparation of N-doped graphene glass are still limited and confronted with great challenges since the dissociation of N doping precursors is much more difficult without the aid of a metal catalyst.19 In addition, the commonly used precursor ammonia (NH3) is corrosive and toxic, which would cause CVD system damage and environmental pollution.
In this work, for the first time, metal-free synthesis of N-doped graphene films on glass was accomplished through a plasma-assisted hot filament CVD (HFCVD) method. Instead of NH3 gas used in the literature, N2 gas was chosen as the N dopant here. Its low cost, abundant sources, toxicity-free nature and non-corrosiveness benefit the large-scale and eco-friendly production of N-doped graphene. To enhance the effective N doping of graphene, a radio frequency plasma source was added to the HFCVD system. Different from the films synthesized by post treatment of N2 or NH3 plasma on pristine graphene,20–22 the N-doped graphene in this study was prepared through an in situ doping process to achieve the uniform distribution of N atoms throughout the films. The necessity of both hot filament and plasma source for growth of preferable N-doped graphene was demonstrated by comparing the structure quality and doping content of films deposited via HFCVD, PECVD and plasma-assisted HFCVD. By changing the N2 flow, the N content, transmittance and electrical properties of graphene films could be adjusted. Compared with most reported CVD methods, the plasma-assisted HFCVD provides rapid and low-temperature deposition of both pristine and N-doped graphene films on glass substrates.
Furthermore, we fabricated both pristine and N-doped graphene glass directly by plasma-assisted HFCVD for liquid-based energy harvesting applications, which is different from the commonly used pristine graphene for electricity generation in the literature that the preparation involves the transfer process.23,24 This would simplify the procedure to fabricate graphene energy harvesting devices. It was discovered that the voltage induced by dropping ion droplets on graphene glass was significantly improved from 50 mV to 320 mV by N doping. This obvious improvement was found to originate from the higher surface potential of N-doped graphene glass compared to the pristine ones. The voltage of 320 mV obtained from the N-doped graphene glass for electricity generation is superior to those of graphene based devices reported by other groups. The present work provides a promising strategy for direct fabrication of N-doped graphene glass with tunable properties and expands the applications of N-doped graphene glass for high-efficiency energy harvesting devices applied in smart windows, solar cells and energy-related applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of graphene films
Both pristine and N-doped graphene films were prepared on quartz glass by plasma-assisted HFCVD. The quartz substrates were thoroughly cleaned through a three-step washing method before they were loaded into a plasma-assisted HFCVD chamber.25 The chamber was then pumped up to a base pressure of approximately 6 × 10−4 Pa followed by heating the substrate to the desired temperature of 850 °C. The schematic diagram of the plasma-assisted HFCVD equipment for graphene film preparation is shown in Fig. 1a. Precursor gases acetylene (C2H2, 1 sccm), hydrogen (H2, 50 sccm) and N2 (0–20 sccm) were passed through a gas shower and mixed together in the chamber. As the gas flow rate was stable, a radio frequency (RF) plasma power with a frequency of 13.56 MHz, which was added between the gas shower and substrate holder (distance of 6 cm), was switched on to generate the plasma. After that, two tantalum filaments (0.5 mm diameter, 2 cm above the substrate) were gradually heated to 2000 °C to reach the decomposition temperature of reaction gases. The reactive radicals of C2H2, H2 and N2 gases for graphene film growth were produced by both RF plasma and high temperature filaments. Deposition was started by opening the shutter between filaments and substrates to introduce reactive radicals. During the film growth, the plasma power and deposition pressure were maintained at 50 W and 10 Pa, respectively. The typical growth time was 9 min. After the growth period, both the plasma source and filament power were switched off. The samples were cooled down gradually from 850 °C to room temperature in a pure H2 atmosphere with a pressure of 25 Pa. The schematic process of the film preparation is shown in Fig. 1b, consisting of heating, growth and cooling.

2.2 Fabrication of graphene glass for electricity generation
The size of quartz glass used for electricity generation was 4.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 2 mm. After the graphene growth, the samples were masked and then transferred into the sputtering chamber. Two copper (Cu) electrodes each with an area of 10 mm × 3 mm and a distance of 3.8 cm, which are located symmetrically at the opposite sides in samples, were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The thickness of Cu electrodes was 100 nm. Subsequently, the electrodes were connected with Cu wires by silver paste to measure the output performance. In this work, 0.6 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution was used as the liquid for electricity generation. To avoid the interaction between electrodes and ionic solution, the Cu electrodes were previously sealed with enamel to protect them from the liquid droplet. To generate electric voltage, the NaCl droplets (0.2 ml) were dropped onto the inclined surface of graphene glass continuously from a height of 10 cm. The angle of inclination was 55°.
2.3 Measurements
The samples were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon), Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher DXR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Fisher, K-alpha), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2100(HR)), UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Shimadzu UV3600), four-point probe (KDY-1, Guangzhou Kunde), Hall-effect measurement system (ET-9000, East Changing) and contact angle system (Kruss DSA100). For Hall-effect measurements based on the Van der Pauw geometry, 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 mm quartz glass was used as the substrate for graphene growth. The Cu electrodes were sputtered at four corners of samples by magnetron sputtering. The current–voltage (I–V) test was performed using a Keithley 2400 and Keithley 2700 attached on the Hall-effect equipment. Substrates for the low temperature I–V test were 1 cm × 1 cm × 2 mm quartz glass and the samples were fabricated by sputtering two Cu strip electrodes (8 mm × 2 mm) with a distance of 4 mm symmetrically at the opposite sides. For the surface potential test, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were performed using the amplitude modulation mode of AFM equipment (MESP-RC probe, tip apex 35 nm). For flow-induced voltage measurements, the voltage signal of graphene samples was recorded using a Keithley 2700 controlled through software with a sampling rate of 20 s−1.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the Raman spectra of graphene films deposited by plasma-assisted HFCVD with different N2 flows from 0 to 20 sccm for 9 min. The presence of D peaks (around 1350 cm−1), G peaks (around 1580 cm−1), D′ peaks (around 1620 cm−1), 2D peaks (around 2700 cm−1) and D + D′ peaks (around 2930 cm−1) is the typical feature of Raman spectra for graphene. The peaks around 1540 cm−1 may be generated by the thermal stress.26 Generally, the intensity ratio of the D peak and G peak (ID/IG) together with the full width at half maximum of the G peak (FWHMG) reflects the defect density of graphene films, and the variation of intensity ratio of the 2D peak and G peak (I2D/IG) is dependent on the change of absolute value of the Fermi level of doped graphene films.27 The dependence of ID/IG, FWHMG, G peak position and I2D/IG on the N2 flow is summarized in Fig. 2b and c. Except for the N2 flow from 0 to 5 sccm, the ID/IG and FWHMG increase while the I2D/IG decreases with increase in the N2 flow. The results indicate the introduction of doped N atoms in graphene films and therefore increases the film disorder. Moreover, the shift of the G peak to high vibration frequency confirms the N doping, which originates from the decreased value of the Fermi level induced by nonadiabatic removal of the Kohn anomaly at the Γ-point.28,29 The abnormal decrease of ID/IG and FWHMG is observed as the N2 flow increases from 0 to 5 sccm, which implies the reduction of defects. It has been reported that the increase of dilution ratio is beneficial to the improvement of the crystalline quality of carbon films prepared by HFCVD.30 With the increase of N2 flow, on one hand, the C2H2 gas is more diluted by both N2 and H2 gases and therefore would result in the increase of crystalline quality. On the other hand, the flow increase is beneficial for a higher N content in graphene films, which would lead to the increase of lattice distortion and decrease of crystalline quality. As the N2 flow is lower than 5 sccm, the N content in graphene films is small. In this case, the increase of crystalline quality is mainly ascribed to the increase of dilution ratio. With the further increase of N2 flow, the film quality would be mainly dependent on the N content. Consequently, the crystalline quality decreases by increasing N2 flow from 5 to 20 sccm. Specifically, the ID/IG and FWHMG of pristine graphene films grown on glass without N2 flow (0 sccm) are larger while the I2D/IG is smaller than those prepared on metal catalysts, which is mainly attributed to two aspects: (1) the excess nuclei resulted from the amorphous properties of glass; (2) the short deposition time for grain growth.18,30,31 Accordingly, the pristine graphene films on glass possess more defects and exhibit polycrystalline properties. The uniformity of graphene films is confirmed by SEM measurements (Fig. S1†).

(e and f) Comparison of ID/IG, FWHMG and I2D/IG of graphene films deposited by different methods with N2 flows of 0 sccm and 5 sccm, respectively. 
To further investigate the structure difference caused by different deposition methods, graphene films were also prepared separately by HFCVD and PECVD under the conditions of 0 sccm and 5 sccm N2 flows. For comparison, the filament temperature of HFCVD and the plasma power of PECVD were maintained at 2000 °C and 50 W, respectively. Fig. 2d shows the Raman spectra and the corresponding ID/IG, the FWHMG and I2D/IG of graphene films prepared by different methods are shown in Fig. 2e and f. The FWHMG of graphene films prepared by plasma-assisted HFCVD (HF + PE) is smaller than those prepared by PECVD, but is larger than those prepared by HFCVD for each N2 flow condition. However, for ID/IG and I2D/IG, an opposite variation tendency is observed. Considering the FWHMG and I2D/IG, it is concluded that the graphene films synthesized by HFCVD and plasma-assisted HFCVD possess better crystalline quality compared to those prepared by PECVD. Particularly, both the 2D peak and D′ peak of films prepared by PECVD disappear under the 5 sccm N2 flow condition. The spectrum is similar to that of amorphous carbon, which indicates the amorphous structure of deposited films.32,33 The amorphous structure was also confirmed by HRTEM analysis (Fig. S2†). The degradation of film quality for films prepared by PECVD as the N2 flow increases from 0 to 5 sccm is found to be mainly caused by the high N content of ∼3.5 at% in films at 5 sccm N2 flow which largely increases the film disorder. It is also found that the crystalline quality of films cannot be improved by increasing the plasma power, even to a high value of 130 W (Fig. S3†).
XPS measurements were then taken to confirm the effective N doping in graphene films and analyze the N content. Shown in Fig. 3a and S4a† are the XPS survey spectra of graphene films deposited with different N2 flows from 0 to 20 sccm. The N-doped graphene films exhibit an obvious N 1s peak in comparison with the pristine ones. Fig. 3b plots the N content and the content ratio of N and C (N/C) of graphene films prepared by plasma-assisted HFCVD and HFCVD, respectively, as a function of N2 flow. The XPS survey spectra of graphene films deposited by HFCVD with different N2 flows are shown in Fig. S4b.† Both the N content and N/C of graphene films deposited through different methods increase gradually with increasing the N2 flow. The N content and N/C of graphene films prepared by HFCVD are much smaller than those prepared by plasma-assisted HFCVD under the same N2 flow conditions, which can be attributed to the good stability of N2 gas to temperature even at a high filament temperature of 2000 °C. Therefore, it is more effective to achieve the N doping of graphene films prepared by plasma-assisted HFCVD rather than those prepared by pure HFCVD. The N content of graphene films prepared by plasma-assisted HFCVD with the dopant N2 gas in this work ranges from about 0 to 3.0 at%, which is comparable to those prepared with other dopant sources such as NH3, methylamine, urea and triazine in the literature.19,34–37 To analyze the binding modes of graphene films, the high resolution C 1s and N 1s spectra are provided in Fig. 3c, S4c† and 3d. After the deconvolution of C 1s spectra, sp2 carbon (∼284.8 eV), C–H (∼285.3 eV) and C–O (∼287.3 eV) peaks for 0 sccm N2 flow, and sp2 carbon (∼284.8 eV), N–sp2 C (∼285.8 eV) and N–sp3 C (∼287.5 eV) peaks for the other N2 flow conditions are obtained, which suggests the structure of pristine graphene and N-doped graphene, respectively. The N 1s spectra are fitted with four separate peaks representing pyridinic N (∼398 eV), pyrrolic N (∼400 eV), graphitic N (401.5 eV) and N-oxide (∼405 eV) peaks. The flat N 1s spectrum of graphene films with 0 sccm N2 flow further confirms the pristine characteristic. By calculating the peak area of each N configuration over the total C 1s peak area, the N content of different N configurations can be obtained. Fig. 3e summarizes the content of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N under different N2 flow conditions after the normalization of total N content. The N-oxide peaks are neglected in the calculation since they are not generated from the film growth. The schematic diagram of the three N-doped configurations is shown in Fig. 3f. The content of pyrrolic N decreases while the pyridinic N increases with increasing the N2 flow from 5 to 20 sccm. Meanwhile, the dominant doping type of N-doped graphene films changes from pyrrolic N to pyridinic N. The results manifest that pyrrolic N and pyridinic N are easier to form than graphitic N, which is ascribed to the lower formation energy at the edges or defects of the graphene lattice.38 Moreover, since the formation energy of pyrrolic N is lower than that of pyridinic N,39,40 pyrrolic N is preferred to form in graphene films, and therefore becomes the dominant configuration at the low N2 flow condition of 5 sccm. The increased amount of pyridinic N may be caused by both the dehydrogenation of N–H bonds of pyrrolic N for forming sp2 N–C and the increased formation of aromatic carbon rings under high dilution ratio conditions.30,39

To compare the structure difference between pristine graphene and N-doped graphene, HRTEM measurements were utilized. Fig. 4 depicts the HRTEM images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and elemental mapping of pristine graphene and N-doped graphene films deposited with N2 flows of 0 sccm and 20 sccm. Both pristine graphene and N-doped graphene nanosheets used for HRTEM tests are uniform and continuous (Fig. 4a and g). The high magnification images of pristine graphene and N-doped graphene are shown in Fig. 4b, c and h, i, respectively. The grains for pristine graphene and N-doped graphene grown directly on glass are found to be nanocrystalline (pink arrows). In addition, the diffraction rings of SAED patterns (insets of Fig. 4b and h) further confirm the polycrystalline structure. The intensity of diffraction rings of pristine graphene is higher than that of N-doped graphene, which indicates the better crystalline quality of pristine graphene. These results are in agreement with the Raman analysis. After indexing the SAED patterns, (002), (111) and (100) orientated nanocrystallines with the inter-planar spacings of 0.33 nm, 0.26 nm and 0.21 nm, which are the typical features of the graphene structure, are obtained. However, the (002) planes with the largest inter-planar spacing disappeared in N-doped graphene (insets of Fig. 4h and i). This phenomenon indicates the decrease of inter-planar spacing of graphene films by N doping. To clarify the element doping, the scanning of C and N elements were conducted to get the elemental distribution. The morphology images of graphene nanosheets used for elemental mapping are shown in Fig. 4d and j. The C signal mapping images of pristine graphene and N-doped graphene both exhibit strong and uniform distribution (Fig. 4e and k). However in the N signal mapping images, only N-doped graphene presents an obvious elemental distribution. These results unambiguously confirm the uniform N doping behavior of N-doped graphene films prepared by plasma-assisted HFCVD.

Fig. 5a shows the transmittance spectra of graphene films deposited by plasma-assisted HFCVD with different N2 flows for 9 min. The transmittance at 550 nm increases gradually from 68 to 90% with increasing the N2 flow. In general, the transmittance is dependent directly on film thickness. Fig. S5† shows the corresponding thickness of graphene films under different N2 flow conditions. The thickness decreases from ∼72 to ∼3.4 nm with the increase of N2 flow, which is in agreement with the variation of transmittance. The decreased thickness can be interpreted by the increased dilution ratio, which would reduce the film growth rate. It is also seen that the N-doped graphene films prepared at 20 sccm N2 flow possess 4–5 graphene layers (Fig. S5f†). Particularly, we point out here that despite the thickness being different for graphene films grown with various N2 flows, the film structure is well maintained under different growth time conditions, unless the film transmittance is higher than 90% (Fig. S6†). In that situation, it tends to be more sensitive to the substrates. Therefore, the structure of graphene films with different N2 flows for the same deposition time of 9 min in this work is comparable. Electrical properties of graphene films were characterized by the Hall-effect measurement, which are shown in Table 1. The pristine graphene exhibits positive Hall coefficient while the N-doped graphene shows a negative Hall coefficient. These results indicate p-type and n-type conduction of pristine and N-doped graphene films, respectively. The resistivity decreases with the increased N2 flow, which is ascribed to the higher contribution of electrons of N atoms to the π system that is confirmed by the increase of carrier concentration. For carrier mobility, it increases firstly by increasing the N2 flow from 0 to 5 sccm, followed by a decrease. To explore the mechanism, a low temperature I–V test was conducted to calculate the activation energy of both pristine and N-doped graphene films (Fig. S7†). Fig. 5b summarizes the calculated results. The variation of activation energy is found to be opposite to that of carrier mobility and the smallest activation energy is observed at 5 sccm N2 flow. In fact, small activation energy implies the small energy needed for the transition of electrons from the impurity energy level to the conduction band, which is beneficial to the movement of electrons in graphene films and result in a high carrier mobility.30 In addition, from a structural view, the mobility is largely influenced by the defect density in graphene films. According to the Raman analysis, the highest mobility of graphene films is obtained at 5 sccm N2 flow due to their best crystalline quality.

The overall results are divided into two categories according to the duration of growth time: several minutes (solid line) and over 1 h (dashed line).

Comparison of the sheet resistance and transmittance of graphene films grown directly on glass by plasma-assisted HFCVD in this work with the reported results by other CVD methods in the literature was made to evaluate the film properties (Fig. 5c). The overall results are divided into two categories according to the duration of growth time: several minutes (solid line) and over 1 h (dashed line). The graphene films deposited under a N2 flow of 20 sccm were chosen as the comparison samples for N-doped films owing to their lowest resistivity. At the same transmittance, it is seen that the N-doped graphene films exhibit lower sheet resistance than pristine ones in this work, which indicates the better performance of N-doped graphene glass. Moreover, the sheet resistance of N-doped graphene films in this work is comparable, or even lower than most reported results in the literature.13,17,41–48 However, the sheet resistance is higher than those deposited by some thermal CVD methods (growth temperature > 1000 °C).11,19,49,50 This is mainly attributed to the relatively low growth temperature (850 °C) and short growth time (several minutes) in this work. Nevertheless, the plasma-assisted HFCVD method provides greener (low temperature) and rapid (short growth time) deposition of graphene films on insulating substrates.
Considering the high transmittance and good conductivity of graphene glass fabricated in this work, an electricity generator by dropping droplets on graphene glass was made to fulfill its potential applications. Fig. 6a shows the illustration of the experimental setup for electricity generation. 0.6 M NaCl was chosen as the solution for droplets, since its ion concentration is close to that of realistic rainwater and therefore has been used as simulated rain solution in the literature.51,52 The anode and cathode of the voltmeter for voltage signal collection is marked. Both pristine and N-doped graphene glass were fabricated to compare their performance. A 20 sccm N2 flow was used for N doping because of the largest doping amount and the best transparent conductive performance of graphene films prepared under this situation. For practical applications, the comparison of electricity generation between pristine and N-doped graphene glass should be based on the same transmittance. Herein, the transmittances of 96%, 90% and 85% at 550 nm were selected by adjusting the growth time of graphene films and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6b. Raman spectra shown in Fig. S8† confirm the graphene structure of films for electricity generation. Fig. 6c depicts the I–V measurements of pristine and N-doped graphene glass. The linear I–V curves indicate the good ohmic contact between electrodes and graphene glass. Moreover, from the linear I–V curves, the internal resistance of graphene glass can be obtained by calculating the slope (Fig. 6d). From the results, it is seen that the resistance of graphene glass decreases with the decreased transmittance, which is attributed to the thickness increase of graphene films. In addition, the resistance of N-doped graphene glass is lower than that of pristine ones with the same transmittance. Fig. 6e–g show the voltage signal generated by dropping droplets of NaCl solution on both pristine and N-doped graphene glass with transmittances of 96%, 90% and 85%, which were fabricated at 0 sccm and 20 sccm N2 flows. The results are summarized in Fig. 6h. Obviously, the voltage generated from N-doped graphene glass is higher than that of pristine ones with the same transmittance, especially under high transmittance conditions, where the voltage difference is increased by six times through N doping. Furthermore, the generated voltage also decreases sharply while reducing the transmittance from 96 to 85%, which is in agreement with the results reported in the literature.53,54Fig. 6i shows the voltage signal generated by dropping NaCl droplets on N-doped graphene glass with a transmittance of 96% sixty times. The Raman spectra of N-doped graphene glass before and after dropping NaCl droplets sixty times are shown in Fig. S9.† Both the results confirm the good stability of N-doped graphene glass for energy harvesting.

All samples were fabricated by plasma-assisted HFCVD at 0 sccm or 20 sccm N2 flows. 
To explore the underlying mechanism for the enhanced voltage generation of N-doped graphene glass with a transmittance of 96% for electricity generation, the graphene glass was further characterized by both KPFM measurements and contact angle measurements (Fig. 7 and S10†). As shown in Fig. 7, based on the condition whether the graphene glass is immersed into 0.6 M NaCl solution or not, the surface potential of pristine graphene is more negative than that of N-doped graphene. The results indicate the upshift of the Fermi level by N doping. In addition, since the surface potential of pristine and N-doped graphene glass both increase after the immersion, it is concluded that the graphene glass is more positively charged while NaCl droplets are more negative charged by triboelectrification after the contact. Because of the large difference of surface potential between pristine and N-doped graphene glass, the higher voltage generated by N-doped graphene glass is supposed to be attributed to their higher surface potential. Apart from the surface potential, the smaller contact angle of N-doped graphene glass compared to pristine ones may also be a factor for the larger voltage due to the increased contact between NaCl droplets and graphene glass (Fig. S10†).55

Schematic diagrams of the electricity generation mechanism of pristine and N-doped graphene glass by dropping ion droplets are shown in Fig. 8a and b, where the items on the left and right represent the NaCl droplets in the stationary state and moving state, respectively. On the basis of KPFM analysis, the NaCl droplet possesses negative charges while the graphene glass possesses positive charges once they make contact with each other and the electric double layer accompanied by a pseudocapacitance are formed by the Coulomb force between negative and positive charges at the interface.56 For the stationary state, there is no electrical potential difference at both ends of the droplet. After the inclination of graphene glass to achieve the moving of the droplet, anions inside the droplet are driven toward the front side of it, and the surface charge balance of graphene is broken. This would generate a potential difference at both ends of the droplet and result in the drawing of cations in graphene. Accordingly, the pseudocapacitor is charged at the front of the droplet and discharged at the rear of it with the droplet movement, and both voltage and current are generated. In addition, the anticlockwise direction of current just leads to a positive voltage signal of the voltmeter, which is in agreement with the direction of voltage collection shown in Fig. 6a. The dynamic charging and discharging process of pseudocapacitors in the moving NaCl droplet can be described by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 8c, where CR and CF represent the two pseudocapacitors forming at the rear and front ends of the graphene and droplet interface, respectively, and RL and Rd are the resistance across the liquid droplet and the resistance of graphene under the liquid droplet, respectively. The charging of CR and simultaneous discharging of CF would drive free cations from the rear to the front ends across the graphene under the droplet (Fig. 8a and b). The equivalent current I and the generated voltage V can be calculated using the formula below:53,57 (1)where qe is the quantity of electric charge, t the charging and discharging time, ψ the equivalent surface potential of graphene relative to the absorbed droplet layer, W the width of the graphene layer under the droplet, C0 and v the pseudocapacitance per unit area and the moving velocity of the droplet, respectively, which are both constant values here, Rd the resistance of graphene glass, Rsq the sheet resistance of graphene and L the length of the droplet. For comparison of the generated voltage of pristine and N-doped graphene glass, since the ratio difference of Rd (Fig. 6d) and W (Fig. S10†) is both much smaller than that of ψ (Fig. 7b and d), the generated voltage V would be determined mainly using the surface potential ψ according to the formula V = ψWC0vRd. Therefore, the higher voltage generated by N-doped graphene glass is confirmed to be attributed to their higher surface potential. Due to the electron donation by N doping, the N-doped graphene glass possesses higher surface potential than the pristine ones once the NaCl droplets come into contact with the graphene surface, and leads to more anions forming in the NaCl droplet at the interface (Fig. 8b). As the droplet moves on the graphene surface, more anions accumulate at the front side of the droplet, drawing more cations from the graphene. Consequently, a larger potential at both ends of the NaCl droplet is generated from the N-doped graphene glass compared to the pristine ones and results in a higher output voltage. In addition, based on the formula V = ψC0RsqLv, the decrease of generated voltage with the decreased transmittance for both pristine and N-doped graphene glass can be ascribed to the decrease of sheet resistance Rsq (Fig. 5c), the decrease of droplet length L (Fig. S10†) and the introduction of more additional electron leakage channels as the film thickness increases.57

Finally, a comparison of performance of liquid-based graphene energy harvesting devices in this work and the reported studies by other groups is made, which is shown in Table 2. The generated voltages of N-doped graphene glass based devices are much higher than that of pristine ones in this study. Moreover, the large output voltage of 320 mV by our group is superior to those of most reported graphene based devices and even comparable to that of graphene on specific PTFE substrates by sliding water droplets in the literature.53,54,56–62 Apart from the performance, our devices possess two unique advantages. The direct growth avoids the potential contamination and damage existing in transferred graphene films. In addition, the intrinsic high transparency and good insulating properties of the glass substrate make the graphene glass more suitable as an energy harvesting device applied in smart windows, solar cells and energy-related applications.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have achieved the direct growth of N-doped graphene films on glass through a plasma-assisted HFCVD method using N2 as the dopant gas. Both the hot filament and plasma source were found to be crucial for the preparation of preferable N-doped graphene films, according to the analysis of structure quality and doping content of films synthesized by HFCVD, PECVD and plasma-assisted HFCVD, respectively. The N content, transmittance and electrical properties of graphene films could be modulated by adjusting the N2 flow. Compared with most reported CVD methods, the plasma-assisted HFCVD provided rapid and low-temperature deposition of both pristine and N-doped graphene films on glass substrates. Further experiments about electricity generation revealed that the electrical voltage of graphene glass induced by dropping NaCl droplets was much enhanced from 50 to 320 mV through N doping. The significant improvement of generated voltage was ascribed to the higher surface potential of N-doped graphene glass when compared to the pristine ones, as demonstrated by KPFM analysis. The high voltage of 320 mV obtained from the N-doped graphene glass for electricity generation is superior to those of graphene based devices reported by other groups. This work should shed light on the large-scale and eco-friendly production of N-doped graphene glass by CVD methods as well as promote their applications for high-efficiency energy harvesting devices.
