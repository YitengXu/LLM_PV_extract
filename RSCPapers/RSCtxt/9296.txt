    AbstractSelf-assembled functional rod–coil block copolymers (poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate-stat-acrylate perylene)) containing electron donor (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) and acceptor (perylene) moieties were synthesized, characterized, and studied in photovoltaic devices. The block copolymers were synthesized by a combination of the McCullough route yielding monodisperse polythiophene, living radical polymerization and finally “click chemistry”. The self-assembled nanostructure was tuned via time to control the degree of order. As a result, devices with active layers which were completely disordered (molecularly mixed), contain short range order in which the nanodomains were molecularly pure, but were poorly organized, or consisted of cylindrical fibrils with their long axes running parallel to the electrodes were compared. Active layers with well formed but poorly organized nanodomains had the highest photovoltaic efficiencies indicating that molecular scale segregation has a significant effect on device performance. The poor performance of the well defined cylindrical nanostructures is probably a reflection of the poor charge transport properties associated with the misorientation of the long axes parallel to the electrodes.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices are attractive for many energy applications due to their inherently low material costs, mechanical flexibility, and the promise of scalability to large area, light weight devices.1 In contrast to many inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconducting materials generate excitons (electron–hole pairs) instead of free charge carriers upon photoexcitation. The exciton binding energy in organic materials exceeds thermal energy at room temperature2 so the exciton does not separate into free charges spontaneously. Instead, free charge carriers can be formed by creating an interface between a light absorbing electron donating species and an electron accepting material. The donor material has a lower ionization potential and the acceptor material has a larger electron affinity. Ideally, the exciton diffuses to the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface prior to recombination. Then, due to the energy difference between the donor's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and acceptor's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, the electron will be transferred to the acceptor and the hole will reside in the donor. The free charge carriers must then migrate to their respective electrodes to generate a photocurrent before charge recombination occurs.
There are two major bottlenecks in the creation of photocurrent: charge separation and charge transport to the electrodes. In order for an exciton to separate, it must find a D–A interface before recombination. Generally, even with the prolonged excitonic lifetime in organics, the exciton diffusion length is limited to approximately 10 nm, necessitating a 10 nm length scale of interfaces within the active layer of the device to maximize charge seperation.3–5 Once separated, the electron and hole must be transported through the acceptor and donor phases (respectively) back to the cathode and anode. These dual requirements suggest optimization through the creation of a bicontinuous morphology where the domain size is on a 10 nm length scale. Fig. 1 schematically depicts possible active layer morphologies. The bilayer morphology (Fig. 1a) is commonly achieved by thermal evaporation techniques, generally appropriate for small molecules.6 This morphology provides the most direct pathway to transport electrons and holes to the electrodes and minimizes the recombination of the free charges, however, exciton separation is limited to the small interfacial area. Excitons are only separated within ∼10 nm of the interface, though the light penetration depth is much greater (∼100 nm). A bicontinuous morphology with a large amount of interfacial area would be ideal, but is difficult to realize. Structures created by blending of the donor and acceptor components7 are generally referred to as bulk heterojunction structures (Fig. 1b). The interface morphology in these devices is non-equilibrium, depending on the phase separation of the two components. The casting conditions, thermal histories, and thermodynamic interactions of these components must be tuned to create small length scale phase separation and a large amount of internal interfacial area. The morphologies resulting from phase separation are necessarily difficult to tune in terms of connectivity to the electrodes and are subject to Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, even when phase separated two component blends encompass some degree of molecular scale mixing which has unexpected effects on the electronic properties.8 Indeed, studies of the relationship between morphologies in blend structures and photovoltaic performance have only begun to appear in the last few years.9–14 While some of the highest efficiencies to date have been demonstrated in bulk heterojunction devices, optimization generally requires combinatorial processing to achieve optimal morphologies. It is unclear whether this type of processing can be scaled with similar effects.
 Fig. 1  Numerous active layer morphologies of the electron donating and accepting components have been suggested in the literature. Parts a and b are commonly used bilayer and bulk heterojunction morphologies. Block copolymers can be used to form disordered structures, structures with poor order, or long range ordered structures. 
Block copolymers made by covalently linking distinct chains with electron donor and acceptor properties may be good candidates for solar cell applications due to their ability to self-assemble into structures on the 10 nm length scale. Self-assembly in classical block copolymers is a compromise between the immiscibility of the blocks and the penalty associated with stretching a chain across the interface.15 As a result, the nanodomain size is set by the size of the polymer and not subject to ripening. Furthermore, the shape of the nanodomain can be predicted and is not a result of processing history. Finally, the nandomains are molecularly pure with mixing of components only occurring in the immediate vicinity of the interface. These effects promise to separate the nanodomain morphology of an active layer from its processing history and provide a chemical purity of domains. These properties are of interest in bulk heterojunction devices.
While a large amount of work has been done to understand classical block copolymer self-assembly, the backbone conjugation that imparts a semiconducting band gap also creates chain rigidity in the polymer. Chain rigidity introduces liquid crystallinity, an intramolecular interaction not found in classical block copolymers. Additionally, the conformational asymmetry of so-called rod–coil block copolymers provides an additional geometrical constraint. Experimentally, a large number of intriguing phases have been observed16 including zigzag, herringbone, and hockey puck phases, as well as cylindrical and spherical phases reminiscent of more classical systems. This phase behavior is the subject of a few recent reviews.16,17 The self-assembly of rod–coil block copolymers relies on four thermodynamic parameters: the Flory–Huggins strength of segregation (χN, where N is the molecular length) which parameterizes the interactions between chemically dissimilar blocks, the Maier–Saupe interaction relating the rod–rod alignment tendency (µN), the volume fraction of coil (ϕcoil) and the geometrical asymmetry of the system (ν).18–21 The phase diagram for a model conjugated rod–coil block copolymer system suggests that lamellar phases occur for a much larger range of volume fraction than in the classical block copolymer case22,23 though hexagonal24–26 and spherical24,26 phases have been observed under certain circumstances. While classical block copolymers generally form layered morphologies with the long axis parallel to the substrate due to preferential wetting conditions, it appears that the kinetics of rod–coil block copolymer self-assembly can trap a less well ordered morphology with layers arranged both perpendicular and parallel from the substrate.27,28
Several groups have prepared donor–acceptor block copolymers for photovoltaics.29–33 Novel diblock copolymers consisting of an electron donating poly(alkoxy phenylene) and a coil block with pendant fullerenes demonstrated intriguing device performance, though the self-assembly was kinetically hindered by the presence of the crystallizable fullerene.29–32 Scherf and co-workers prepared a series of diblock/triblock copolymers with both electron donor and electron acceptor blocks, which formed regular nanostructures in thin films.34–36 The use of pendant donor and acceptor groups on a coil-like polymeric backbone results in polymers that bear more resemblance to classical block copolymers. Thelakkat and co-workers have demonstrated a poly(bisphenyl-4-vinylphenylamine)-b-poly(perylene diimide acrylate) in which all of the electronic functionalities are attached as side groups.37–41 Backbone conjugated polymers, such as poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT), have higher charge mobilities. Recently, block copolymers incorporating poly(3-hexyl thiophene) as the donor material and a hybrid acceptor material made of an acrylate backbone with pendant perylene groups have been synthesized.42,43 This block copolymer system has shown improved device performance in comparison to an analogous blend, suggesting that the molecular scale phase separation of a block copolymer is advantageous.
While several donor–acceptor block copolymers have been demonstrated, well organized nanostructures have been slow to appear. If cast quickly from a non-preferential solvent, block copolymers do not have time to self-assemble and molecularly mix (Fig. 1c). If cast slowly or annealed above the glass transition temperature for suitable periods of time, the block copolymers may form not only the monodisperse, molecularly pure nanostructures generally associated with block copolymer self-assembly, but these nanostructures will also orient cooperatively to form large grains with long range order. Intermediate conditions allow for the formation of the monodisperse nanodomains, but the system may lack sufficient mobility to form long range, well defined grains (as shown in Fig. 1d). The impact of nanoscale segregation and long range order on device behavior is unclear.
Here, a single active layer photovoltaic device based on poly(3-hexyl thiophene)-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate-stat-acrylate perylene) block copolymer as shown in Fig. 2 is synthesized, self-assembled, and characterized by constructing photovoltaic devices. Regioregular P3HT is one of the most promising electron donating conjugated polymers with good solubility, environmental stability,44 high charge carrier mobilities and a low band gap relative to most conjugated polymers. Perylene diimide derivatives have large molar absorption coefficients and good electron accepting properties,45–49 and previous studies suggest good photovoltaic performance both in layered and in bulk heterojunction structures.50–55 We show that the degree of order achieved through self-assembly can be tuned by altering the mobility of the backbone and the time available for self-assembly. We find that while long range ordered self-assembly can be achieved, nanostructures consisting of well defined interfaces but lacking long range periodicity and orientation perform better. This appears to at least partially be due to a lack of ability to control nanostructure orientation and therefore long range self-assembly with misorientation may lead to a decrease in connectivity of the donor–acceptor interface with the electrodes. The statistical polymerization of the perylene precursor with non-functional butyl acrylate improves chain mobility and the kinetics of self-assembly, but increased amounts of butyl acrylate reduce the performance of the device, as expected. This demonstrates that well controlled domain sizes and a decrease in molecular mixing that is a result of self-assembly are advantageous.

Synthesis of 3a–c. 
In a typical experiment, N,N,N′,N′,N′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA) ligand (17.3 mg, 0.10 mmol), initiator (1) (29.8 mg, 0.10 mmol), 3-(trimethylsilyl)prop-2-ynyl acrylate (2) (280 mg, 1.5 mmol), n-butyl acrylate (768 mg, 6.0 mmol) and a magnetic stirrer were introduced into a dry 10 mL round-bottom flask. The round flask was subjected to 3 freeze–pump–thaw cycles. CuBr (14.3 mg, 0.1 mmol) catalyst was added into the flask while the contents were in a solid state and deoxygenated by vacuum followed by back filling with nitrogen two times. The flask was placed in an oil bath set at 60 °C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and then aliquots were withdrawn for characterization. Conversions were calculated via1H NMR by comparing the integrals of the monomer CH2-O- signals (4.77 ppm from 3-(trimethylsilyl)prop-2-ynyl acrylate and 4.15 ppm from n-butyl acrylate) to the peak of polymer CH2-O- signals (4.65 ppm from poly(3-(trimethylsilyl)prop-2-ynyl acrylate) and 4.05 ppm from poly(n-butyl acrylate)). The molecular weight of the polymer was calculated by 1H NMR by comparing the integral of the peak of polymer CH2-O- signals (4.65 ppm from poly(3-(trimethylsilyl)prop-2-ynyl acrylate) and 4.05 ppm from poly(n-butyl acrylate)) to that of the CH2-N3 group connected to the aromatic ring, at 4.35 ppm. Polydispersities were calculated from SEC using polystyrene standards.

Polymer 6a (118 mg, 0.01 mmol), CuBr (7.1 mg, 0.05 mmol), and azide substituted asymmetric perylene diimide (7) (125 mg, 0.15 mmol) were introduced into a 25 mL round-bottom flask, which was fitted with a stopper. The flask was evacuated and back-filled with dry nitrogen three times. After the evacuating cycles, dry THF (10 mL) and PMDTA (8.6 mg, 0.05 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was sonicated for 2 h. After reaction, the solution was passed through a column of neutral alumina to remove the catalyst. The desired polymer was precipitated in acetone three times to remove the excess of azide substituted asymmetric perylene diimide. In order to study the effect of adding butyl acrylate to the backbone of the electron accepting block, the number of perylene units was kept at around 10 to keep the ratio of the donor and acceptor monomer units constant in all samples 8a–c.

Device fabrication and measurement
Prepatterned 150 nm sputtered ITO-coated (20 Ω m−1) glass substrates were obtained from Thin Film Devices, Inc. The substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication for 20 min in acetone, and then 2% Helmanex soap in water for 20 min. This cleaning was followed by extensive rinsing and then ultrasonication with deionized water and then 2-propanol. A final 10 min oxygen plasma treatment completed the substrate cleaning. A 40 nm thick film of poly(styrenesulfonate)-doped poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron-P) was spin-coated onto the cleaned glass–ITO substrate at a rate of 4000 rpm and baked for 1 h at 125 °C. All procedures after this point were performed in an inert-atmosphere glove box. For spun-cast devices, solutions of block copolymers (10 mg mL−1 in toluene) were applied to the substrate and spun at 1000 rpm for 60 s. For drop cast devices, solutions of block copolymers (0.5 mg mL−1 or 1 mg mL−1 in toluene) were used to flood the substrate which was then covered to reduce the evaporation rate of the solvent and allowed to dry. Solvent annealing was accomplished in a saturated vapor environment and upon completion of annealing, the vapor was allowed to flash quickly off the sample. Contacts on the ITO anode were created by mechanically removing some of the organic film. Substrates were then held under high vacuum (10−7 Torr) for 4 h to facilitate removal of remaining solvent prior to evaporating 100 nm of Al through a shadow mask at a rate of 0.1–0.5 nm s−1. During the evaporation, samples were rotated at 1 Hz to ensure even metal deposition. The configuration of the shadow mask afforded eight independent devices on each substrate and one control connection between the Al and the ITO substrate. Devices were left to cool to room temperature before further processing. Device testing was performed under an argon atmosphere with an oriel xenon arc lamp with an AM 1.5G solar filter. Current–voltage data were measured with a Keithley 236 SMU. Reported efficiencies are averages from all eight devices on each substrate.
Transmission electron microscopy
Samples for top view transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were prepared by either spin-casting films from toluene solution (10 mg mL−1) or drop casting films from toluene solution (0.5 mg mL−1 or 1 mg mL−1) onto a silicon wafer covered with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS to mimic the device conditions. The slow dissolution of PEDOT:PSS in a water bath allowed for the release of the block copolymer films from the silicon wafer. Films were then retrieved on top of 500-mesh copper TEM grids. To create TEM contrast, the P3HT domains were preferentially stained by exposure to I2 vapor for 4 h or RuO4 vapors for 10 min. Preference of these stains for P3HT was confirmed via staining and subsequent imaging of large-scale blend samples (not shown). TEM images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai 12 (200 kV, bright-field) using the internal charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
Samples for cross-sectional TEM were prepared by drop casting films from toluene solution (0.5 mg mL−1 or 1 mg mL−1) onto a silicon wafer covered with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS. In this case, the P3HT domains in the films were stained for one day using RuO4 vapors to insure even staining throughout the depth of the film. A thin cross-sectional TEM sample of a drop cast film was prepared by the “shadow focused ion beam” method.60 TEM images were obtained on a Zeiss LIBRA 200MC (200 kV, bright-field) using the internal charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
Atomic force microscopy
Samples for atomic force microscopy (AFM) were prepared by first spin-casting PEDOT:PSS onto (100) silicon wafers and then either spin-casting or drop-casting polymers from toluene solution on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. AFM samples were analyzed on a Digital Instruments MultiMode AFM operating in Tapping Mode™.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of block copolymers
Conjugated block copolymers have been previously prepared by either a macroinitiation approach29,61 or a coupling approach.62–64 When the conjugated chain is used as the initiator for the polymerization of a second block (usually via a living polymerization route), controlled polymerization is achievable, but characterization of the molecular weights and chemical integrities of the individual blocks after polymerization is difficult. Furthermore, exposure of the conjugated block to the polymerization conditions of the second block can lead to higher polydispersities, side reactions, and degradation. By contrast, coupling reactions allow each block to be synthesized and characterized separately, but a balance must be found in which the coupling reaction is high yielding and the resulting block copolymer is easily separable from its constituent homopolymers, but does not result in side reactions. Here, well defined functional rod–coil block copolymers containing electron donor and acceptor moieties with narrow molecular weight distributions are synthesized by a combination of living free radical polymerization and two “click chemistry” steps as shown in Scheme 1 utilizing the coupling approach.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis route of the P3HT-b-poly(BA-stat-PerAcr) block copolymers. BA = n-butyl acrylate, PerAcr = acrylate unit with perylene diimide side group. 
Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of a protected alkyne functionalized monomer with an azide end functionalized initiator yielded a monodisperse (PDI ≈ 1.2) polymer (3). Click chemistry was then used to couple the P3HT rod (4) to the polyacrylate chain (3). The high efficiency of this coupling reaction allowed for very mild reaction conditions which helped to preserve the chemical integrity of the individual blocks. Care was taken to remove the catalyst and any unreacted azide functionalized P3HT. The alkyne functionalities on the block copolymer were then deprotected to yield a defined number of sites to which further functionalities could be attached (6). In this case, electron acceptors were attached via another click chemistry step.
4-(Azidomethyl)benzyl 2-bromopropanoate (1) was chosen as the ATRP initiator. The number average molecular weight (Mn (NMR)) of the corresponding polymers was determined by using both the benzylic and the aromatic protons as internal 1H NMR standards. This initiator (1) was prepared in a single step from (4-(azidomethyl)phenyl)methanol and 2-bromopropanoyl bromide as shown in Scheme 1a. The homo- and copolymerization of 3-(trimethylsilyl)prop-2-ynyl acrylate 2 and n-butyl acrylate with the initiator in the presence of a CuBr–PMDTA31 catalyst yielded good control over the polymer molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (Table 1). Adding n-butyl acrylate to the polymerization should decrease the glass transition temperature of this block and increase its self-diffusion coefficient. The azide end group is stable under the ATRP reaction conditions, as verified by comparing the ratios of the aromatic protons to azide connected benzylic protons via1H NMR.

Ethynyl-terminated P3HT was prepared according to the McCullough methods.57 Low polydispersity ethynyl-terminated P3HT 4 (Mn = 5300 (NMR), Mn/Mw = 1.15) was synthesized by terminating the P3HT with a Grignard reagent (ethynylmagnesium chloride). Ethynyl-terminated P3HT 4 was then added to 3. Since polymer 4 dissolves only very slowly in THF, sonication was used to promote the solubilization. The two polymer building blocks (3 and 4) were coupled via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions between the azide and alkyne end groups using CuBr and PMDTA,65,66 forming block copolymer (5). The coupling reactions were finished within 2 h by monitoring the disappearance of homopolymer (4) with SEC. The block copolymer contains trace amounts of unreacted P3HT homopolymer and acrylate homopolymer which are easily distinguished from our target block copolymer (Fig. 3). After the reaction, the polymer solution was filtered through a neutral alumina column twice to remove the copper catalyst. The excess homopolymer 3 and monomers were easily removed by precipitating in methanol.
 Fig. 3  SEC trace of 8a using a UV photodiode array detector showing absorbance intensity versus wavelength and molecular weight indicating the successful coupling of P3HT and a perylene diimide containing polyacrylate. The trace homopolymer P3HT has a molecular weight of ∼4000 g mol−1 and a peak absorption at 453 nm. The block copolymer has an expected molecular weight ∼20000 g mol−1 and narrow polydispersity. This block copolymer also has the expected multiple absorption peaks, including characteristics of both the P3HT block (absorption maximum at 453 nm) and the perylene diimide (absorption maximum at 485 nm). 
The trimethylsilyl side chain protecting group was removed quantitatively using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as verified by 1H NMR. Completion of the deprotection was confirmed by the disappearance of Si(CH3)3 (0.18 ppm) protons and the appearance of CCH (2.50 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectra. We also note that if the copper catalyst was not completely removed from polymer 5 after previous reaction steps, coupling reactions in the polymer were observed during deprotection (as seen in SEC). In all of the polymers in this study, great care was taken to remove trace catalyst so that no coupling was apparent.
Azide substituted asymmetric perylene diimide groups 7 were attached to the polyacrylate backbone by click chemistry with CuBr as the catalyst in the presence of PMDTA. The success of the click reaction yielding block copolymer 8 was confirmed by the disappearance of CCH (2.50 ppm) in 1H NMR spectra and an expected increase in polymer size observed in SEC. After the reaction, the polymer solution was filtered through a neutral alumina column twice to remove the copper catalyst completely. Since 7 is soluble in acetone and 8 is not soluble in acetone, the excess of 7 was removed via precipitating from acetone three times. The narrow molecular weight distribution (Table 1) from SEC suggests no cross-linking reactions occurred during the click reaction. UV-Vis spectroscopy indicates that perylene diimide functionalized homopolymer absorbs sharply at 485 nm and P3HT absorbs broadly at 453 nm. Fig. 3 shows a three dimensional SEC plot showing wavelength, absorbance, and molecular weight from an SEC fitted with a photodiode array detector in its effluent stream. Trace P3HT homopolymer has the expected broad absorbance centered at 453 nm. Only after the coupling with a perylene diimide containing block does the polymer assume a higher molecular weight (20 kg mol−1) and absorbances at both 485 nm and 453 nm, indicating the successful incorporation of both functionalities onto the polymer chain. Molecular weights found using SEC are determined by using polystyrene calibrations and tend to reflect chain shape rather than the true molecular weight. As a result, molecular weights shown in Table 1 are derived from NMR analysis.
Self-assembly of the bifunctional block copolymer
While block copolymer chemistries improve the efficiency of dissociating excitons, the level of long range ordering of the block copolymer nanostructures is expected to be crucial in optimizing performance. When casting quickly, block copolymers can be prevented from ordering, leading to molecular scale mixing of the two blocks. Casting slightly slower will lead to poor ordering which establishes interfaces between the donor and acceptor but does not lead to the long range continuity of the domains. If annealed or cast slowly, block copolymers will self-assemble into long range periodic structures. Herein we demonstrate the effect of this variation in self-assembly on device performance.
Rod–coil block copolymer 8a (PTP4AP) was chosen to study the effect of long range order on solar cell device performance. Surface chemistries and thermal/solvent histories are well known to influence the detailed order of block copolymers.67 Care was therefore taken such that all samples studied via AFM and TEM exactly replicated actual devices including the presence of a PEDOT:PSS substrate surface. Disordered, molecularly mixed thin films of block copolymer PTP4AP were prepared by spin-coating (rapid drying) PTP4AP solution in toluene onto the PEDOT:PSS passivation layer, as shown in Fig. 4a and b (AFM and TEM micrographs showing a lack of nanostructure). The lack of order results from the relatively fast casting of a bulky, kinetically hindered block copolymer. These conditions do not allow for the time and molecular mobility necessary for self-assembly. In order to obtain structures with well defined nanodomains, drop casting and solvent annealing were used to prolong the thin film self-assembly process. A dilute block copolymer PTP4AP (0.5 mg mL−1 or 1 mg mL−1 in toluene) solution was drop casted on PEDOT:PSS. Evaporation of the solvent was slowed by covering the container containing the substrate and liquid film. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, this casting technique resulted in nanostructures (periodicity = 26.8 nm, as calculated from 2D Fourier transforms of the TEM image) with long range order, stereotypical of either block copolymer self-assembly or P3HT fibril formation.
 Fig. 4  AFM tapping mode phase images and TEM plane view images of P3HT–PTP4AP with (a and b) disordered structures, (c and d) long range order, and (e and f) poorly organized nanostructures. TEM contrast originates from I2 staining of P3HT. AFM contrast originates from the mechanical property contrast between the blocks. 
Electron microscopy samples were obtained by floating the film off the PEDOT:PSS substrate and picking up the films on a copper grid. The films were then stained with I2 or RuO4 which makes the P3HT segments appear dark in the TEM (as confirmed via staining of macrophase separated blends). The images in Fig. 4d show projections through the top plane of the film and indicate either nanostructured cylinders with long axes parallel to the substrate or lamellae lying perpendicular to the substrate. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy studies using focused ion beam (FIB) etching are used to distinguish between these two types of nanostructures. As shown in Fig. 5, the nanodomains have a circular cross-section and appear to lie with their long axes parallel to the substrate. Contrast in the AFM phase images (Fig. 3c) derives from mechanical property difference between the P3HT and polyacrylate blocks in the block copolymers. The polyacrylate regions appear softer and stickier. The characteristic domain spacing of the block copolymer (26.8 nm) is of the same order as the exciton diffusion length, resulting in a promising morphology to efficiently charge separate at the D–A interface. Cylindrical nanosegregated morphologies in P3HT containing block copolymers have been attributed to both block copolymer driven self-assembled cylinders26 and the crystallization of P3HT68,69 resulting in cylindrical fibrils. Since both of these phenomena result in structures of similar size and degree of long range order, it is not possible to distinguish the driving force for the nanostructures shown here.
 Fig. 5  TEM plane view (a) and cross-sectional (b) images of P3HT–PTP4AP confirming the morphology of long range order samples consist of fibrillic cylinders lying parallel to the surface. Cross-sectional sample was prepared by FIB. Contrast originates from RuO4 which is used to stain the P3HT. 
Nanostructures with intermediate degrees of order were achieved by spin-coating disordered films and then exposing them to high vapor pressures of a non-selective solvent to impart mobility to the chains. Structures shown in Fig. 4e and f were fabricated by first spin-coating and then annealing in a saturated vapor of toluene for 12 h. The characteristic domain spacing (25.4 nm calculated from fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the TEM image) from solvent annealed films is very similar to the drop cast films but significantly less order is present.
Device behavior of self-assembled films
To evaluate the effect of morphology on device behavior, the casting procedures above were used to fabricate thin film solar cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the same PEDOT:PSS layer served as the substrate to the block copolymer film, but in this case PEDOT:PSS was stacked on top of the glass–ITO anode. After casting and/or annealing of the block copolymer layer, an aluminium cathode was evaporated onto the film. Devices were then characterized by current–voltage measurements under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G conditions).
Increases in power conversion efficiencies (η) are related to increases in the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the fill factor (FF). The Jsc is the current value when the solar cell is at zero bias and is related to the amount of absorbed light and charge carrier mobilities of the organic materials. More light absorption and higher mobilities will generate higher Jsc by creating more excitons and transporting the resulting charges more efficiently. The Voc is the voltage produced when the current in the cell equals zero. It has been suggested that in bulk heterojunction cells, the limited Voc is related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.70,71 The FF is the ratio of the maximum power produced to the product of the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage. Ideally, the fill factor should be unity, but losses due to inefficiencies in charge transport and recombination result in typical values between 0.2 and 0.7 for organic solar cells. Previous studies suggest that the solar cell device thickness has a strong effect on performance as it can be tuned to optimize both charge transport (important in materials with low charge mobility) and light absorption.70,71 The thicknesses in spun-cast devices can be controlled exactly. As a result, the films which were molecularly mixed or poorly organized nanostructures could be prepared over a wide range of thicknesses. For active layers with well formed, but poorly ordered nanostructures, power conversion efficiencies (η) of the devices increased as film thicknesses increased from 70 nm to 103 nm after which the efficiency became thickness independent indicating that maximum absorption had been reached. This also indicates the device thickness has little effect on the charge transport efficiency in the thickness ranged studied. In comparison, molecularly mixed active layers had lower Jsc's indicating that the formation of well defined, but poorly organized nanostrucures results in improved charge carrier mobilities. As expected, the Voc's and FF were similar in the two devices.
As shown in Fig. 6, we find that charge mobility improves when going from a molecularly mixed to a well defined but poorly organized nanostructure. The structure with truly long range order, reminiscent of classical block copolymers behaves worse than the poorly organized sample. We postulate that this difference is related to the detailed morphology and particularly the orientation of the anisotropic structures in the well ordered sample. The enhancements seen in the Jsc and FF for the poorly organized nanostructures suggest that the creation of a donor–acceptor interface (separation of the two functionalities into different domains) results in better hole and electron transport (Fig. 7). TEM micrographs (Fig. 3f) indicate that this nanostructure's lack of organization may result in a lack of directionality in the morphology which leads to improved charge transport pathways. In comparison, the cylindrical structure is aligned with its long axes running parallel to the electrodes. It appears likely that this orientation is detrimental, particularly to hole transport (P3HT is on the inside of the cylinders). Many techniques exist to control nanodomain orientation within block copolymer thin films and it is clear that the use of these techniques could be advantageous to device performance.67

In all cases, the sample with poorly organized nanostructure shows increased power conversion efficiency (a), short-circuit current density (b), open-circuit voltage (c), and fill factor (d) under AM 1.5, 100 mV cm−2 conditions.

The solar cell devices with poorly organized nanostructures show the best device performance. 
The effect of chemical structure
It is possible that the presence of bulky, crystalline perylene diimide results in decreased chain mobility and therefore poor self-assembly. Butyl acrylate was copolymerized with the precursor for the perylene diimide segments to improve chain mobility. Clearly the incorporation of this insulating monomer will affect charge mobility so the amount of butyl acrylate was optimized to allow for optimal self-assembly into ordered structures while still allowing charge transport. Here, the block copolymer was varied so as to keep the number of perylene diimide groups per chain (Nperylene) constant while varying their spacing by inserting more or fewer butyl acrylate groups along the chain, as shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Chemical structures for (a) 8a, (b) 8b and (c) 8c. 
Similar to the previously discussed PTP4AP, block copolymers with less butyl acrylate (PTP2AP and PPTP) show no nanophase segregation when films are spin cast from toluene (Fig. 8a and c). After solvent annealing in toluene, they all show poorly organized nanostructures (Fig. 8b and d) and have very similar morphologies to PTP4AP. As expected, large amounts of insulating butyl acrylate monomer is detrimental to device performance (particularly efficiency and Jsc), but this effect is not as harmful at lower ratios around 2 : 1 butyl acrylate to perylene diimide ratio. This indicates that an optimum exists in which some butyl acrylate may be added to improve self-assembly without damaging device performance. In this case, that optimum appears to be at a ratio of ∼2 : 1 plasticizer : electron conductor, but it is sure to vary depending on the specific chemistry used. In each case, however, the self-assembled (poorly ordered) device showed superior performance compared to the disordered system (Fig. 9).

While the dependence of device performance on self-assembled structure is easily observed via comparison of the above structures, it should be noted that the overall efficiencies observed here are quite low. We suspect that this is largely due to a very complex optimization process which has not yet occurred. In particular, it is well known that crystallinity is crucial to charge transport. While the perylene diimide side chains are clearly crystallizing, as observed via dynamic scanning calorimetry, the relative lengths of the tether between side chain and backbone as well as solubilizing groups will play a strong role in determining the crystalline perfection and grain size. Work is currently underway to optimize this chemistry. Similarly, the misorientation of the crystalline nanostructures in the well ordered self-assemblies is clearly detrimental to device performance and work is currently underway to control this aspect of self-assembly.
Conclusions
The synthesis of well defined functional rod–coil block copolymers P3HT-b-poly(BA-stat-PerAcr) containing electron donor (P3HT) and acceptor (perylene) moieties with narrow molecular weight distributions has been demonstrated. The block copolymer PTP4AP forms disordered structures, poorly organized nanostructures and long range ordered nanostructures depending on the time allowed for self-assembly. Samples with well defined interfaces but poorly organized nanostructures had significantly improved device performances. Samples with long range nanostructure formed cylindrical fibrils and performed poorly probably due to misorientation of the long axis of the nanostructure parallel to the electrodes, limiting charge transport. Chain mobility can be increased to enhance self-assembly by incorporating plasticizing butyl acrylate groups into the perylene domain in the block copolymer with relatively little effect on device performance. In this case, that ratio of plasticizer : perlyene diimide is approximately 2 : 1, but it is sure to depend on the exact chemistries in question.

 	Fig. 3  SEC trace of 8a using a UV photodiode array detector showing absorbance intensity versus wavelength and molecular weight indicating the successful coupling of P3HT and a perylene diimide containing polyacrylate. The trace homopolymer P3HT has a molecular weight of ∼4000 g mol−1 and a peak absorption at 453 nm. The block copolymer has an expected molecular weight ∼20000 g mol−1 and narrow polydispersity. This block copolymer also has the expected multiple absorption peaks, including characteristics of both the P3HT block (absorption maximum at 453 nm) and the perylene diimide (absorption maximum at 485 nm).	 

 	Fig. 4  AFM tapping mode phase images and TEM plane view images of P3HT–PTP4AP with (a and b) disordered structures, (c and d) long range order, and (e and f) poorly organized nanostructures. TEM contrast originates from I2 staining of P3HT. AFM contrast originates from the mechanical property contrast between the blocks.	 

 	Fig. 5  TEM plane view (a) and cross-sectional (b) images of P3HT–PTP4AP confirming the morphology of long range order samples consist of fibrillic cylinders lying parallel to the surface. Cross-sectional sample was prepared by FIB. Contrast originates from RuO4 which is used to stain the P3HT.	 

 	Fig. 6  Solar cell devices of PTP4AP: △ = disorder, □ = long range order and ○ = poorly organized nanostructures. In all cases, the sample with poorly organized nanostructure shows increased power conversion efficiency (a), short-circuit current density (b), open-circuit voltage (c), and fill factor (d) under AM 1.5, 100 mV cm−2 conditions.	 

 	Fig. 7  Plot of current density versus voltage for photovoltaic devices constructed from PTP4AP under different prepared conditions: ▲ = disorder structures, ■ = long range order nanostructures, ● = poorly organized nanostructures. The solar cell devices with poorly organized nanostructures show the best device performance.	 

 	Scheme 2  Chemical structures for (a) 8a, (b) 8b and (c) 8c.	 

 	Fig. 8  Poorly organized nanostructures of block copolymers with varying fractions of low glass transition (plasticizing) butyl acrylate after solvent annealing in toluene: (a) PTP2AP, (c) PTPP for 0 h, (b) PTP2AP for 12 h, and (d) PTPP for 24 h.	 

 	Fig. 9  Solar cell devices made from block copolymer as a function of mole ratio of Nperylene and Nbutyl acrylate: (a) variation of power conversion efficiency, (b) short-circuit current density, (c) voltage, and (d) fill factor under AM 1.5, 100 mV cm−2 conditions; ○ = disorder, □ = poor order.
