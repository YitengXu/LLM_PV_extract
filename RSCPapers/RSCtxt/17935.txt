    , Accepted 21st January 2014First published on 22nd January 2014AbstractRare earth doped NaYF4 nanocrystals have received intensive attention in recent years because of their unique luminescence properties as a result of their very low phonon energy. However, their luminescence is largely limited by the low optical absorption of rare earth ions. This paper presents a novel strategy to prepare highly dispersible and strongly luminescent Eu3+ doped α-NaYF4 (α-NaYF4:Eu3+) nanocrystals, which can be intensely excited via multi-channel optical absorption. Highly dispersible α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals are synthesized using a solvothermal method, and they are coated with a SiO2 layer to form the α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures. These α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures are thermally annealed and the SiO2 shell is then removed to obtain the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals with strong O2−→Eu3+ charge transfer excitation. Luminescence of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals is further enhanced by energy transfer of organic ligands after forming a type of inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructure. This strategy is also useful for developing other types of dispersible and strongly luminescent nanocrystals.
1. Introduction
In recent years, rare earth (RE) doped fluorides have attracted extensive attention because of their high chemical stability and strong luminescence properties, which are ascribed to their merits of low phonon energy, excellent optical transparency, narrow emission band and so on.1 The RE-doped fluoride materials have promising applications in the field of solar cells,2 display devices,3 optical communication,4 biological labels,5 solid-state lasers,6etc. One of the most intensively researched fluorides is NaYF4.7,8 NaYF4 is usually prepared in the form of nanocrystals, which are typically used as the host matrix for RE dopants for desirable luminescence.9 As a result of their very low phonon energy, RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals have been believed to be one of the most ideal candidates for downconversion (especially for near infrared quantum cutting) and near infrared-to-visible upconversion.10–13 Luminescent nanocrystals with an efficient near infrared quantum cutting property are extremely beneficial for enhancing the power conversion efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells,14 while the infrared-to-visible upconversion property enables the biological imaging through infrared light.15,16
NaYF4 has two polymorphic forms: cubic (α-) NaYF4 and hexagonal (β-) NaYF4.17 In recent years, much research has been devoted to the fabrication process of NaYF4 nanocrystals. Li's group employed a liquid–solid-solution (LSS) strategy to synthesize RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, and they showed that the morphology of these RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals can be readily controlled.18,19 Qu et al. employed a tunable solvothermal method to synthesize RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, and they found that both α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 nanocrystals can be desirably obtained by changing the reaction temperature or the molar ratio of Y3+/F− in the source materials.20 Kang et al. prepared NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@nSiO2@mSiO2 core–shell nanospheres with upconversion luminescence, and they reported that these nanospheres can potentially be used as carriers for drug delivery.21
In general, RE ions (such as Eu3+, Dy3+, etc.) have a relatively small optical absorption cross section and a narrow absorption spectrum because of the forbidden nature of the f–f transition.22 Luminescence of RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals depends on the optical absorption of RE ions, so their luminescence is considerably limited. In this paper, we present a strategy to circumvent these limitations associated with RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals.
First, we introduced a strong O2−→Eu3+ charge transfer excitation to the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals via thermal annealing.23 This greatly enhanced their luminescence. Furthermore, thermal annealing can greatly eliminate crystalline defects within crystals, and this is also beneficial to their luminescence. However, as shown in Section 3.1, the thermal annealing process of α-NaYF4 nanocrystals can easily lead to a quick growth of the nanocrystals as a result of sintering. Since fluorides usually have a low melting temperature, they can easily be sintered at a relatively low annealing temperature. Therefore, the first object of this work was designed to resolve this difficulty by employing a core–shell structure to prohibit the growth of Eu3+-doped α-NaYF4 nanocrystals upon thermal annealing, and in the meantime introduce the strong O2−→Eu3+ charge transfer excitation to the nanocrystals.
Secondly, a luminescence sensitization (or the so-called “antenna effect”) through organic ligands was also introduced to the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals.1,24 Such luminescence sensitization can considerably strengthen their absorption intensity and broaden their absorption spectrum by energy transfer.25 In this process, the organic ligand with a strong optical absorption ability is first excited by the excitation wavelength, and then the absorbed energy is transferred to the associated RE ions, resulting in efficient emission via the RE ions.26,27 Our second object of this work was to introduce two types of organic ligands to extend the excitation spectrum and enhance the excitation intensity of α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals.
In this work, we first synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals by a solvothermal method, and then coated them with a SiO2 shell by a sol–gel process to form the α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell structures, which were then annealed in air. After etching off the SiO2 shell, the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals were decorated with pyromellitic acid (PMA) and benzoic acid (BA) ligands to obtain the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructures. In addition to the characteristic direct excitation of Eu3+ ions, the O2−→Eu3+ and the organic ligand to Eu3+ energy transfer excitation considerably broadened the excitation spectrum and enhanced the excitation intensity for the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. The synthesis process, crystal structures, microstructural characteristics, and luminescence properties of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ hybrid nanocrystals were investigated in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.99%) and europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.99%) were used as the RE sources for synthesizing α-NaYF4:Eu3+, while sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (analytical grade, A.R.) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) (A.R.) were used as the Na and F sources, respectively. Other chemicals used in this work included a concentrated ammonia aqueous solution (28 wt%), hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution (10 wt%), and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), all of which were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis details

2.2.1 The α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. 
The doping concentration of Eu3+ ions in the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals was set at 5 atm% for substituting Y3+ (the molecular formula became NaY0.95Eu0.05F4). In a typical procedure for preparation of α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals, Y(NO3)3·6H2O (0.7227 g, or 1.9 mmol), Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.0446 g, or 0.1 mmol) and NaNO3 (0.1700 g, or 2 mmol) were mixed and dissolved adequately in a solution of 15 ml ethylene glycol (EG) to form a clear solution A. NH4F (0.2963 g, or 8 mmol) was added to a 15 ml EG solution to form the solution B. The molar ratio of RE ions in solution A to the F− ions in solution was set at RE3+/F− = 1:4. After both solutions A and B were magnetic stirred for 1 h separately, they were mixed to form a mixture solution. The mixture was further stirred for 1 h to form a uniform solution. The as-prepared solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated at 180 °C for 16 h to synthesize the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals were collected by centrifugation and then washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol in turn several times before being dried at 80 °C for 12 h.


2.2.2 The α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures and thermal annealing. 
In a typical procedure, 0.3 g α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals was dispersed in a solution of 40 ml ethanol and 10 ml deionized water under ultrasonication for 30 min. 2 ml concentrated ammonia aqueous solution (28 wt%), and different amounts of TEOS (0.1 ml, 0.3 ml and 0.5 ml) were added to the above solution. After stirring at room temperature for 4 h, the α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures were obtained. The α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures were collected by centrifugation and washed several times before being dried at 80 °C for 12 h. It should be noted that the SiO2 shell was to prohibit the growth of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals upon thermal annealing.
Thermal annealing of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures was carried out in a quartz tube furnace at 600 °C for 30 min in air. The annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures were immersed in the HF solution under ultrasonication for 1 h to etch off the SiO2 shell, and the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals were obtained and collected by centrifugation.


2.2.3 The α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures. 

Fig. 1 illustrates the whole preparation process of annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ hybrid nanostructures with PMA and BA. Both the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals were then used to coordinate with PMA and BA to obtain the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures. Different amounts of PMA or BA (the molar ratio of α-NaYF4:Eu3+ to organic ligand in the solution was 1:0.5) were added into 10 ml ethanol to form the solution A. An amount of 0.3 g annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals were uniformly dispersed into 10 ml deionized water to form the solution B. Solutions A and B were mixed together under ultrasonication for 30 min, and the mixture solution was magnetic stirred for 2 h. After the mixture solution was left overnight, the final products were washed with ethanol three times and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The α-NaYF4:Eu3+ inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructures were obtained and collected by centrifugation.

2.3 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with a graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15496 nm) at a step rate of 0.02° in the 2θ range 10° to 80°. Microstructural characteristics were investigated using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010) and a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S4800). For the luminescence properties, both excitation and emission spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4600 spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon lamp source. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructures were recorded on a Nicolet 380 FTIR spectroscope. All measurements were made in air at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures and microstructural characteristics

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals after removal of the SiO2 shell. All the diffraction peaks of as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals can be readily indexed according to the cubic NaYF4 crystal structure. The average crystallite size of these nanocrystals can be calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation,28 d = 0.89λ/βcosθ(1)where d is the crystallite size, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the full width at half maximum of a XRD peak, and θ is the Bragg angle. The average crystallite size of the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals was calculated to be about 26 nm and 27 nm, respectively. This suggests that the crystallite size of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals was almost unchanged during the thermal annealing process.

Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals with low and high magnification. These as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals had an irregular shape, and their average size was about 28 nm, which is slightly larger than the calculated size by Debye–Scherrer equation (eqn (1)). Fig. 4 shows the TEM image of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures immediately after thermal annealing. The SiO2 shell can be clearly observed in Fig. 4, and its thickness was about 11.8 nm.

After the removal of the SiO2 shell, the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals were obtained. Fig. 5 shows the TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals with different magnifications. The annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals had an average size of about 29 nm, which is quite similar to the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals (Fig. 3). This confirms that the SiO2 shell effectively prohibited the growth of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals during the thermal annealing process. The HRTEM image in Fig. 5d indicates that the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles were single crystals with a clear lattice image.
 Fig. 5  TEM (a, b, c) and HRTEM (d) images of the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals at different magnification after removal of the SiO2 shell. 
Compared to the irregular-shaped characteristics of the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals (Fig. 3), the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals had a quasi-spherical morphology (Fig. 5), and their surface was rather smooth. This is because, during thermal annealing, nanoparticles generally have a tendency to reduce their surface areas in order to lower their free energy.
For comparison, the FESEM image in Fig. 6 shows the microstructural characteristics of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals annealed under the same conditions but not coated with a SiO2 shell. The particle size increased to about 2 μm (Fig. 6), much larger than the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals (Fig. 3). This should be a result of sintering during thermal annealing. In general, fluorides, especially those containing alkaline elements such NaYF4 and NaF, have a low melting temperature, and they can be easily sintered at a relatively low temperature.

3.2 Luminescence properties

3.2.1 The α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. 

Fig. 7 shows the excitation and emission spectra of the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles. Different amounts of TEOS were used for preparing the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles: 0.5 ml, 1 ml, and 2 ml. All the emission peaks in Fig. 7b are assigned to the characteristic emissions of Eu3+ ions. As shown in Fig. 7a, the charge transfer band (CTB) of O2−→Eu3+ (200 to 300 nm and centered at about 260 nm) dominates the excitation spectra for the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles, but it is not present for the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles. This suggests that oxygen atoms effectively diffused into the α-NaYF4 lattice during the annealing process to become oxygen dopants, although no oxide phase was observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2) and the HRTEM micrograph (Fig. 5d). The O2−→Eu3+ CTB is usually present in the excitation spectra of Eu3+-doped oxides such as Y2O3:Eu3+,29 YVO4:Eu3+,30 oxyfluorides,23 and others. In addition to the O2−→Eu3+ CTB, the characteristic excitation peaks of Eu3+ ions can also be seen in Fig. 7a, and they are assigned to transitions from the ground state 7F0 to different excited states: 5H0 (317 nm), 5D4 (360 nm), 5G2 (378 nm), 5D3 (414 nm),5D2 (464 nm) and 5L6 (393 nm). The annealing process also moderately enhanced the characteristic excitation of Eu3+ ions (Fig. 7a) due to the improved crystallization.
 Fig. 7  Excitation (a) and emission (b) spectra of the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. Different amounts of TEOS were used for the annealed samples. 
It is noted in Fig. 7a that a larger amount of TEOS used for preparing the α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures led to relatively weaker O2−→Eu3+ CTB. This is because a larger amount of TEOS yielded thicker SiO2 shells, which should limit the number of oxygen atoms diffusing to the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystal core. As reported previously for the LaF3:Eu3+ nanoparticles,23 the relative intensity of the O2−→Eu3+ CTB should depend on the concentration of oxygen dopants in the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles. Thicker SiO2 shells should lead to a lower concentration of oxygen dopants in the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. In Fig. 7a, the CTB of F−→Eu3+ generally located below 200 nm is not present because of the larger amount of energy needed to extract an electron from F− than from O2−.31
The presence of oxygen dopants within the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ host lattice was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, the binding energy of O1s at 531.6 eV for both the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals belongs to hydroxyl or absorbed oxygen on their surfaces.32 It is noted that the SiO2 shell was etched off before the XPS measurement for the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals in Fig. 8, and this corresponds to the sample prepared with 1 ml TEOS (see Fig. 7). The existence of hydroxyl or absorbed oxygen should be attributed to their exposure in air or the organic solvent used in the solvothermal reaction. In Fig. 8, the binding energy peak centered at 529.3 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen in the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals.32,33 The XPS results confirm that oxygen dopants should have an interaction with Eu3+ ions within the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals, and this is responsible for the O2−→Eu3+ CTB (Fig. 7a). However, the XPS spectrum in Fig. 8 indicates that the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals did not show any noticeable existence of lattice oxygen, and this is consistent with their excitation spectrum (Fig. 7a).

3.2.2 The α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures. 

Fig. 9 shows the excitation and emission spectra of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures. It should be noted that the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals in these hybrid nanostructures were annealed and they were prepared using 0.5 ml TEOS. For comparison purposes, Fig. 9 also includes the results from both the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. All the emission peaks (right region in Fig. 9) can be directly assigned to the 5D0→7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions of Eu3+ ions. The 5D0→7F0 transition is located at about 579 nm, while the 5D0→7F1 transition is centered at about 593 nm. The 5D0→7F2 transition is the strongest emission centered at 615 nm. The characteristic excitation peaks of Eu3+ originating from ground state (7F0) to different excitation states (5D4, 5G2, 5D3, 5D2, 5L6, and 5H0) are observed in the excitation spectra (left region in Fig. 9). As in Fig. 7a, the O2−→Eu3+ CTB dominates the excitation spectra of the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals (left region in Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Excitation (left) and emission (right) spectra for the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA (a) and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA (b) hybrid nanostructures. Both the as-synthesized and annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals are also included for comparison. 
The strong and broad excitation bands (200 nm to 350 nm in the left region of Fig. 9a and 200 nm to 300 nm in the left region of Fig. 9b) for the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures are assigned to the π–π* electron transition of PMA and BA ligands, and they perfectly correspond to the absorption spectra of these ligands.1,24,34 The organic ligands absorb ultraviolet photons and their electrons are excited and then transferred to the coordinated Eu3+ ions for emission. Detailed description for this energy transfer is included in the next section. It is noted in Fig. 9 that the excitation of the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ hybrid nanostructures included contribution from both the O2−→Eu3+ CTB and the energy transfer of the organic ligands, and their excitation has a much stronger intensity and wider spectral range than the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ based hybrid nanostructures. By including the excitation from the direct f–f transitions of Eu3+ ions, the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures have triple excitation channels: the O2−→Eu3+ CTB, the energy transfer from organic ligands, and the direct f–f transitions of Eu3+ ions.
As shown in the emission spectra in Fig. 9, the forbidden 5D0→7F0 transition band was almost invisible for the as-synthesized α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. This is expected because the J = 0 → J = 0 transition of Eu3+ ions is not allowed according to the selection rule. Nevertheless, the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals showed a quite strong 5D0→7F0 transition band centered at about 579 nm. This could be a result of the O2−→Eu3+ charge transfer mechanism. Interestingly, this strong 5D0→7F0 transition band for the annealed α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals was significantly weakened after the formation of α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA hybrid nanostructures. Especially for the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA hybrid nanostructures, the intensity of their 5D0→7F0 transition was weakened by about 4 times. This may indicate that the organic ligand can weaken the 5D0→7F0 transition. One explanation is that the two excitation mechanisms, the two charge transfer processes from either the O2− or the organic ligands to Eu3+, may work against each other. A similar result was also observed by the authors in the Y2O3:Eu3+–thenoyltrifluoroacetone hybrid nanostructures.35 Our hypothesis is that when an Eu3+ ion receives an excited electron from an organic ligand, it cannot simultaneously accept another electron from O2− due to the repulsive electrostatic force. Further work is in progress by the authors to achiever a better understanding of the interactions between different excitation mechanisms.

3.3 Luminescence sensitization by PMA and BA
FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the PMA and BA ligands on the surfaces of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 10, the broad band at 3456 cm−1 is attributed to the O–H stretching vibration from the residual absorbed water.36 The peaks around 3150 cm−1 and 3056 cm−1 for α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA in Fig. 10b belong to the vO–H (intermolecular hydrogen bond) vibration and C–H stretching vibration of PMA, respectively. Moreover, the absorption peaks at 1417 cm−1 and 1515 cm−1 in Fig. 10b and 1461 cm−1 in Fig. 10c correspond to the stretching vibration of carboxyl.8 The strong characteristic bands located at 752 cm−1 and 815 cm−1 (Fig. 10b) and 708 cm−1 (Fig. 10c) are assigned to out-of-plane bending vibrations of benzene rings.37

The mechanism of energy transfer (or the so-called “antenna effect” or “sensitization”) in the α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructures can be explained as follows.25,38 As shown in Fig. 11, an ultraviolet photon absorbed by an organic ligand initiates its π–π* electron transition, and excites it to the excited singlet (S1) state. Then an energy migration via intersystem crossing from the S1 state to a triplet (T) state carries out. The energy is then nonradiatively transferred from the lowest triplet state of the organic ligand to a resonance state (5DJ) of Eu3+, which in turn emits in the visible region. It is widely accepted that the sensitization of RE3+ ions by organic ligands takes place through an electron exchange (Dexter) mechanism.39

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel strategy has been developed to prepare highly dispersible and strongly luminescent α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals, which can be excited by multi-channel optical absorption. The α-NaYF4:Eu3+@SiO2 core–shell nanostructure can effectively prohibit grain growth of α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals upon thermal annealing, which introduces a strong O2−→Eu3+ excitation to the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals. The α-NaYF4:Eu3+–PMA and α-NaYF4:Eu3+–BA inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructures have been successfully fabricated. Luminescence of the α-NaYF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals are greatly enhanced by energy transfer of organic ligands to the nanocrystals. The O2−→Eu3+ excitation and energy transfer by the organic ligands effectively resolve the characteristic limitation of optical absorption for the RE-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals.
