    , Accepted 5th October 2017First published on 5th October 2017AbstractThe preparation of a series of organic dyes having a carbazole donor, cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor, and phenylene ring as a spacer with the difference in the positions of fluorine substitution is reported. Due to its unique properties of small size and high electronegativity, fluorine is now being extensively used to control the optoelectronic properties of organic conjugated materials. In this study, the results revealed that the specific position and number of fluorine substitution were very crucial to control the optical as well as the electrochemical properties of organic dyes. It was found that fluorine substitution led to a redshift in the absorption spectra of the dyes and reduced the band gap. The injection rate of photoexcited electrons was measured using time-resolved photoluminescence and the o-fluoro substituted dye MA1F-o showed the best electron injection dynamics. As a result of broad absorption and high electron injection rate, the dye MA1F-o outperformed other dyes with a power conversion efficiency of 4.02% (Jsc = 8.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.75 V and FF = 0.64). The non-fluorinated dye MA0F exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 3.23% (Jsc = 6.8, Voc = 0.72 and FF = 0.67). The dye MA1F-m exhibited the least molar absorption coefficient and a lower power conversion efficiency because of the meta inductive effect.
Introduction
For more than two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been receiving considerable attention from many researchers1 in view of their great potential for converting solar energy to electricity at low-cost using less hazardous and low energy-consuming materials. Generally, DSSCs are composed of a mesoporous titania film stained with a photosensitizer dye, which acts as a working electrode, a redox mediator in an organic solvent working as an electrolyte and a counter electrode.2,3 Considering the efficiency and stability, zinc porphyrin4–8 and ruthenium polypyridine9–11 complexes are the dyes with the best performance. However, ruthenium dyes have a drawback of metal toxicity and inadequate resource availability, whereas zinc porphyrin dyes have the complications of giving low yields and handling of highly poisonous chemicals during the synthesis.12 DSSCs have recently achieved the record in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 14% based on organic sensitizers, which is higher than the maximum reported efficiency of metal complex dyes.13 Organic sensitizers have the advantage of abundant raw materials, flexible molecular modification, and high molar absorption coefficient.14 Organic sensitizers mostly consist of a push–pull combination of a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) linked with a π-spacer to enhance intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT), resulting in effective sunlight harvesting.15 The properties of D–π–A sensitizers can be easily tuned by choosing different combinations of the components (i.e. D and A) and different substitutions.16–21 Photovoltaic characteristics of a sensitizer can be enhanced by broadening the absorption spectra. This may be achieved by either increasing the conjugation length using an additional spacer, donor, and acceptor or introducing different substituents. The extension of π-conjugation causes unfavourable π–π stacking and aggregation that results in low photo-stability.22 Fluorine atom, when substituted on organic sensitizers, provides an inverted charge density distribution with respect to the analogous non-fluorinated molecule due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature. Moreover, fluorine has a strong impact on inter- and intra-molecular interaction via hydrogen bonding. It is also beneficial in lowering the energy level as well as reducing the band gap.23 The method based on fluorine substitution to obtain a narrow band gap sensitizer also has the advantage that fluorinated sensitizers are more hydrophobic, creating a large shielding that curtails the direct contact between the electrolyte and the photoanode. Several studies have been reported on the effects of fluorination, which includes either the effect of fluorine position (ortho- or/and meta- to cyanoacrylic acid)24–26 or the effect of fluorine content.27–29 It has been observed that when fluorine was substituted at an ortho-position, a superior PCE was obtained, while it hampered the efficiency when incorporated at a meta position. When mono and di-ortho substitutions were considered, the highest efficiency in mono-substitution was observed with vinyl spacer dyes, whereas di-substituted dye gave the highest efficiency with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer.24–28
Herein, we designed and synthesized fluorine containing metal-free organic sensitizers MA1F-o, MA1F-m and MA2F (Scheme 1) based on a carbazole donor, cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor and different fluorine substitutions at a phenylene unit that acted as a spacer. Both the number and the position of fluorine on phenylene spacer were changed. The properties of these dyes were compared with those of the fluorine-free reference dye MA0F. Fluorination can lower the LUMO level relative to that of the non-fluorinated dye because of its electron withdrawing nature, resulting in a narrower band gap and a redshift in the absorption. We observed that mono fluorine substitution at the ortho position improved the photovoltaic properties of the dye significantly. We correlated the improvement in the photovoltaic properties with the positions and number of fluorine using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Results and discussion
Widely used D–π–A configuration was considered to design these dyes, where carbazole acted as a donor, cyanoacrylic acid acted as an acceptor and phenyl ring with different fluorine substitutions acted as a spacer. Fluorine substitution at ortho (MA1F-o), meta (MA1F-m) and ortho–meta positions (MA2F) on phenyl spacer to cyanoacrylic acid of the reference dye MA0F was carried out to design the dyes. The synthesis method of MA dyes involved two steps (Scheme 1). First, the Suzuki coupling reaction of 3-bromo-9-hexyl-9H-carbazole with 1 gave the corresponding aldehyde 2. The second step involved the Knoevenagel reaction of 2 with cyanoacetic acid to afford the corresponding dye.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all dyes in chloroform solution are illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and the parameters are summarized in Table 1. All of the dyes exhibited similar spectra with the localized π–π* transition peaks in the range of 260–360 nm and the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from carbazole to the cyanoacrylic acid group in the range of 360–500 nm. The reference dye MA0F exhibited a λmax at 380 nm (ε = 24957 M−1 cm−1) for the lowest energy peak. As expected, fluorine substitution resulted in a redshift of the absorption maxima to 396, 400, and 402 nm for MA1F-o, MA1F-m, and MA2F, respectively. The observed redshift was attributed to the reduction in the band gap because of the electronegative fluorine substitution.25 However, a moderate decrease in the molar absorption coefficient of MA1F-o (19869 M−1 cm−1) and MA2F (19251 M−1 cm−1) as well as a dramatic decrease in case of MA1F-m (11489 M−1 cm−1) were observed. As compared to the absorption onset of other fluorinated dyes, the absorption onset of MA1F-m was blue-shifted due to the meta inductive effect of the fluorine atom and was almost equal to that of MA0F. Fig. 1(b) shows the absorption spectra of the dyes absorbed on 6 μm TiO2 films, where the maximum absorption peaks are located at 435, 418, 446, and 440 nm for MA0F, MA1F-o, MA1F-m, and MA2F, respectively. When dyes are loaded onto TiO2 surface, the aggregation and deprotonation affect the UV-vis absorption. The aggregation of the sensitizers may be of H-type or J-type. The H-type aggregates along with deprotonation always resulted in the blueshift of the absorption peak, while the J-type aggregates mainly led to the redshift.30 The redshift in the absorption maxima for the dyes coated onto TiO2 as compared to those in the chloroform solution, in our study, proved the dominance of J-type aggregates. A blueshift in the absorption peak of MA1F-o as compared to that of other dyes may be attributed to better deprotonation and anchoring to the TiO2 layer.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to calculate energy levels of the sensitizers. However, the reduction peak was not observed (Fig. S24, ESI†). Therefore, a more sensitive technique, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), was used to obtain the energy level. Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction peaks were observed for all of the sensitizers (Fig. 2(a)). The energy levels of all MA dyes were calculated using the formulae EHOMO = (−4.8 − Eox) eV and ELUMO = (−4.8 − Ered) eV, as reported in the literature.31 The HOMO level of all of the dyes matched well with the redox potential of I−/I3− present in the electrolyte. The electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine led to an enhanced charge separation between the donor and the acceptor parts.25 As a result of fluorination, the LUMO level of MA0F (−3.43 eV) was reduced to −3.54, −3.49, and −3.56 eV for MA1F-o, MA1F-m and MA2F, respectively. These values were above the conduction band (CB) level of the TiO2 electrode (3.9 eV), providing a sufficient driving force for the electron injection from the oxidized sensitizer to the CB of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The electron injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2 was analyzed by dynamic fluorescence. The lifetime decay curves of the dyes coated on 6 μm thin film of TiO2 and Al2O3 are illustrated in Fig. 2(b, c). The decay was found to be biexponential in case of TiO2 and triexponential for Al2O3. The fluorescence decays of the dyes absorbed on alumina films showed only the intermolecular energy transfer due to the aggregation of the dye on the alumina surface. However, in case of the dyes absorbed on TiO2 films, both processes, the aggregation induced energy transfer and the electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2, occurred simultaneously. Therefore, if we assume same aggregation in both the cases (i.e. Al2O3 and TiO2) as the same thickness of Al2O3 and TiO2 films were used, the rate constant for the electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2 can be evaluated using equation kinj ≈ kTiO2 − kAl2O3.32,33

The average lifetime 〈τ〉, rate coefficient (k), and rate constants for the electron injection (kinj) are listed in Table 1. Monofluoro-substitution at the ortho position (MA1F-o) and difluoro-substitution (MA2F) resulted in an increase in the rate constant for the electron injection to 9.10 × 108 and 9.48 × 108 s−1, respectively. Moreover, a decrease in the rate constant was observed in case of MA1F-m (3.95 × 108 s−1) when compared with that of the reference dye MA0F which has the rate constant of 5.99 × 108 s−1. The rate constant is a measure of electron transfer between the dye and the CB of TiO2.
Electron density of frontier molecular orbitals was analysed using Gaussian 09 software package. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using B3LYP-631G(d,p) basis set. The distribution of electrons was similar in all of the dyes as seen in Fig. 3. The dyes were almost planar and HOMO electrons are mainly distributed on the carbazole unit with partial spreading over the phenyl ring. LUMO electrons are spread from cyanoacrylic acid up to the phenyl spacer. The analogous HOMO and LUMO levels could be attributed to the same backbone structure of the dyes. Fluorine substitution lowered both the HOMO and LUMO level and reduced the band gap.

Based on an earlier report where the effect of the thickness of the TiO2 film sensitized with different fluorine containing dyes was investigated,34 we have selected 12 μm TiO2 film due to its suitability and performance with the dyes of these series (Fig. 4 shows the schematic of the fabricated DSSC). Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs under light and dark conditions. The results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSC changed clearly with the position of fluorine substitution in the phenyl ring of the dye. Various photovoltaic parameters of DSSC with different sensitizers are depicted in Table 2. Photovoltaic parameters in terms of Jsc, Voc and PCE of DSSC based on the reference dye MA0F (i.e. without fluorine substitution) were 6.76 mA cm−2, 0.718 V and 3.23%, respectively. The introduction of a single fluorine atom at the ortho position on the phenyl ring (MA1F-o) led to a redshift in the absorbance (Fig. 1 (a)) due to the pronounced charge transfer, in the presence of fluorine atom, towards the acceptor end along with the subsequent H-type aggregation inducing the blueshift on the TiO2 film, which led to an enhancement in Jsc (8.28 mA cm−2).

To analyze the increase in the photovoltage of the dyes MA1F-o and MA2F and the decrease in that of MA1F-m compared to that of the reference dye MA0F, we analyzed the dipole moment of the dyes, which was calculated using DFT. The energetics of titania electrode depends on the dipole moment of the sensitizers in a dye sensitized solar cell. Therefore, we compared the dipole moment of these dyes. The dipole moment normalized to the surface of TiO2 (μz) is among three components that can cause a shift in the conduction band potential of TiO2. A higher positive value of μz can upshift the conduction band of TiO2, which could lead to an increase in the photovoltage.28 As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), the order of μz was MA1F-o > MA2F > MA0F > MA1F-m. This increase in the μz led to the increment of the photovoltage. The increase in the photovoltage coupled with the increase in the photocurrent resulted in the enhancement of PCE in the same order.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, which reflect the efficiency of photoelectric conversion at various wavelengths, are depicted in Fig. 6. Because of the strong absorption bands in the visible range (400–500 nm), these molecules had a good IPCE in a wide range of the solar spectrum, which is in good agreement with the absorption spectra of the dyes. Furthermore, it is possible to observe that the IPCE plateaus of the MA1F-o and MA2F dyes were higher than that of the MA0F dye, whereas that of MA1F-m was lower, indicating that the introduction of a fluorine unit has a significant effect on the light harvesting capability.

The Voc value depends on the conduction band edge (Ec) of the TiO2 electrode and the electron recombination process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.35–37 The measurement of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to evaluate the recombination effect relation for different yielded Voc values of the DSSC devices. Typical EIS Nyquist plots measured in the dark under forward bias (−0.7 V) are shown in Fig. 7(a). The larger semicircle at lower frequencies represents the interfacial charge-recombination resistances (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.38 The fitted Rrec increased in the order of MA1F-m < MA0F < MA2F < MA1F-o, which is consistent with the sequence of the Voc values in the devices. The larger Rrec value indicates that the electron recombination from the conduction band to the electrolyte occurred with more difficulty. Clearly, the electron recombination in the devices based on MA1F-m and MA0F was faster than that in devices based on MA2F and MA1F-o. By fitting the EIS curves, another important parameter for DSSCs, the electron lifetime (τ), could be extracted from the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and Rrec using the equation τ = CPE2 × Rrec. The fitted τ increased in the same order as the recombination resistance, providing an explanation of the difference in Voc yielded by the DSSCs based on these four dyes.

The Tafel polarization curves, used to study the back electron transfer reaction in the DSSC devices, are shown in Fig. 7(b). This technique is used to analyse the interface charge transfer of the iodine/triiodide redox mediator on the photoanode surface. The kinetics of the anodic reactions occurring at the electrolyte and TiO2 photoanode interface can be represented using the Buttler–Volmer equation.39,40  where J0 is the exchange current density; Eeq is the equilibrium potential of the iodide/triiodide redox system; E is the applied voltage; αa and αc are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, respectively. It is clear from this equation that j = j0 as E = Eeq in the dark condition. Tafel measurement data were fitted using the CorrView software and J0 was estimated for all of the devices and summarized in Table 3. From the results obtained from the above technique, it was concluded that the trend of J0 value was best fit with Rpt and Rrec from EIS study and the highest exchange current density of MA1F-o proved the bright performance over the other sensitizers.

Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) method is a useful tool to learn about the electron lifetime and the electron recombination velocity kinetics in DSSCs.41 To support the mechanism from EIS study, we have performed OCVD measurements, where the simulated solar light was illuminated on the device and a steady-state voltage was obtained after interrupting the illumination (Fig. 8). This result indicated that the equilibrium between the electron injection and the electron recombination was attained at the TCO surface. A potentiostat monitored the decay of Voc of the photoanode with different sensitizer based devices. Herein, the exponentially fitted decay behaviour of MA1F-o was the slowest, suggesting the superior photovoltaic performance.

General synthesis of dyes (MA0F, MA1F-o, MA1F-m, and MA2F)
In a clean and dry round bottom flask, a mixture of the compound 2 (0.25 mmol) [2a–2d] and cyanoacetic acid (0.3 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile and sparged with Ar. Finally, piperidine (0.03 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and it was refluxed for 10 h. The solution was then allowed to cool to room temperature and acetonitrile was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The compound was finally extracted with chloroform, washed with 0.1 M HCl, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solid was finally washed with hexane and 2% ethyl acetate in hexane to get the pure compounds.

Fabrication of solar cell
The TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared by following the previously reported process.34 In brief, a transparent layer of TiO2 with a thickness of 12 μm was used as a photoanode. A TCO glass substrate on deposition of TiO2 blocking (ethanolic titanium tetraisopropoxide) layer was calcined in a tubular furnace at 450 °C for 10 min. Then, ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol were dispersed to make a paste and the film was prepared by doctor blade method on the prepared TiO2 thin film as the TCO blocking layer. The electrode was cooled to 60 °C and soaked into various sensitizer solutions (20 mM in dichloromethane and ethanol mixture) for 24 h. The counter electrode was prepared by a spin coating method using Pt salt (50 mM H2PtCl6 solution in IPA) and the electrode was calcined at 450 °C for 10 min. DSSC was assembled in a sandwich type configuration and sealed. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M BMIMI, 0.03 M iodine and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine. 0.1 M GuSCN in 3-methoxy propeonitrile was inserted through the predrilled holes onto the counter electrodes. The devices were stored in the dark for 24 h prior to the photovoltaic measurements.
Conclusions
In this study, we showed a strong connection between the fluorine substitution and the optoelectronic properties of the dyes. Four carbazole-based dyes (MA0F, MA1F-o, MA1F-m and MA2F) having the same structure, but different fluorine substitution at phenylene spacer were synthesized involving a simple two-step reaction (Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions). UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic analysis revealed that the dyes with fluorine substitution exhibited red-shifted absorption maxima as compared to the non-fluorinated reference dye MA0F. TRPL studies of the dyes coated onto the TiO2 film elucidated the role of fluorine in the electron injection. The results indicated that when fluorine substitution was aligned towards the TiO2 surface, the dye showed a higher electron injection rate. We also illustrated that the position and the content of fluorine have a direct influence on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC. As expected from the optical and electrochemical data, with respect to the reference dye MA0F, the dyes MA1F-o and MA2F with a better absorption near the absorption onset resulted in an increased short circuit current, while the dye MA1F-m with the absorption onset almost equal to that of MA0F and very low extinction coefficient resulted in a lower Jsc. The DSSC device based on the dye MA1F-o gave the best solar cell performance among those based on the other dyes with a PCE of 4.02%, corresponding to a Jsc = 8.28 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.745 V and FF = 0.64. Thus, fluorination could be used as a tool to optimize the optical, electrochemical and electron injection properties to obtain high-efficiency DSSCs.
