    , Accepted 19th December 2012First published on 19th December 2012AbstractWe report a simple solution-based approach to form ordered patterns of an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and underlying reasons for the improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) built on the nanostructured ITO electrode. The patterning of ITO was achieved by using nanospheres as the template to erode ITO by wet chemical etching. Using a textured ITO anode for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) (P3HT:PCBM) OSCs enhanced PCE by 15% with respect to the non-patterned ITO anode. The improvement is mostly attributed to the morphological and interfacial changes stemming from the textured ITO electrode as well as enhanced light absorption due to the optimal morphology and refractive index change of patterned ITO. With its simplicity and time-saving, this method of fabricating a unique pattern of ITO electrodes can be widely applicable to a variety of large-area thin film solar cells.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great interest in recent years due to many advantages, including easy fabrication of large-area, light-weight, and potentially low-cost solar cells.1–3 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSC devices remains much lower than that of inorganic solar cells, which is greatly limited by insufficient optical absorption of a thin active layer, small exciton diffusion length, poor separation ability at the donor–acceptor interface, and low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors.4,5 Management of light absorption, improvement of exciton separation, and facilitation of charge carrier transport may be tackled by engineering the surface morphology of OSCs.6–15
Conventionally, there are typically two ways to create surface textures in OSCs: one is to employ molds with predefined structures via a contact printing process, such as nanoimprint lithography, which requires considerable effort to create molds with a high degree of ordered patterns.16–20 The other is to first form nanoparticles onto the ITO substrate, and then use the nanoparticles as masks to vertically etch ITO by reactive ion etching (RIE)21 or grow an additional ITO layer.22 The fabrication of nanoimprint molds and further patterned deposition of ITO usually requires complicated processes, such as electron-beam lithography, photolithography, RIE, and sputtering, and relevant expensive facilities. It is difficult to generate textures on hard surfaces, such as ITO and oxide buffer layers, by nanoimprint lithography. Moreover, the surfaces patterned by both approaches are limited by involved instruments.23 Hence, a simple approach which would not significantly increase the fabrication cost of OSCs needs to be developed towards attaining higher PCE.
On the other hand, the fundamental understanding of structure–performance correlations of nanostructured OSCs is still very limited.16 The improvement of PCE of such patterned organic solar cells is mostly attributed to enhanced light absorption due to reduction of reflection,9 which is mostly based on the extensive studies of light-trapping on silicon solar cells24,25 or on the simulation of optical properties.26 However, this explanation is not well consistent with the experimental observation on photocurrent and PEC,18,22,27 and there are few studies on the claimed change of refractive index to confirm the reduction of reflection of nanostructured OSCs.28 Therefore, a deep understanding of how to increase photocurrent and in turn improve PCE by modifying the device geometry is becoming essential as morphological optimization strategies reach their limits towards commercially relevant and significant PCE.
Here, for the first time, with no molds and sophisticated instruments, we design textures of the ITO electrode by spin-coating polystyrene (PS) nanospheres as the etching template to erode ITO by wet chemical etching. By employing such a textured ITO anode, the PCE of bulk heterojunction solar cells of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) (P3HT:PCBM) with an ultrathin MoO3 layer instead of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the anode buffer layer was enhanced by 15% with respect to the non-patterned ITO anode. This is a low-cost, time-saving, and reliable method for large-scale patterning of ITO texture for efficiently engineering the morphology of an organic active layer. The improvement in PCE of our structured OSCs originates from the textured morphology of the devices, mostly optimal morphology of the organic active layer rather than the change of refractive index of the patterned ITO anode.

Fig. 1 shows our method for patterning the ITO surface. First, PS nanospheres are deposited onto 150 nm thick ITO-coated glass by spin-coating, which leads to a monolayer of closely packed nanospheres by optimizing the assembly parameters, such as the solution concentration of PS nanospheres and the speed of spin-coating. Second, the ITO substrate with the PS monolayer on it is eroded by the vapor of concentrated HCl solution. Finally, removal of leftover PS nanospheres is performed by ultrasonication of the ITO-coated glass in chloroform.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication process for patterning ITO. 
To demonstrate the facile texture design of ITO, we examined here the effects of erosion time and erosion temperature (see ESI†) on the formation of ordered ITO patterns by using PS nanospheres with a diameter of 100 nm. As shown in Fig. S1a (see ESI†), we can make very nice closely packed monolayer PS nanospheres on the ITO surface at a spin speed of 1800 rpm for 60 s. After the assembly of PS nanospheres, we directly eroded the ITO by using the vapor of concentrated HCl and PS nanospheres as the etching template. Difference in the eroding time resulted in very different textures of ITO (see Fig. S1b–f in the ESI†). In the present study, we can generate a honeycomb geometry of the ITO with an eroding time of 2.5 min at 20 °C. Temperature influences the eroding rate and thus has an effect on the texture change (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). We also investigated the ITO surfaces by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 2a–e show the typical AFM images (upper panel) and corresponding cross-sectional profiles (lower panel) along the lines in the AFM images of the ITO surfaces eroded for 0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 min, respectively. The line profiles are suggestive of the change in texture of the ITO surfaces induced by erosion. In the case of eroding for 2.5 min at 20 °C, the typical etching height was estimated to be about 11 nm, comparable to the thickness of the anode buffer layer, i.e. MoO3 (see below). We found that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the surfaces was changed with the eroding time; and the RMS roughness of the ITO surfaces eroded for 0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 min is 1.87, 2.70, 4.89, 3.73, and 2.13 nm, respectively. For our method, the ITO eroding is a critical step to pattern ITO. Because we use solution-based etching, the HCl vapor condenses on the ITO regions uncovered by the PS nanospheres; and etching initiates at these regions. Etching of the covered ITO regions is from the sidewalls formed during the etching of uncovered ITO regions, which is different from anisotropic etching by RIE. Using the HCl vapor allows us to easily control the eroding rate and in turn the pattern formation of ITO, neither over-etching nor under-etching.

Scan size: 1 μm × 1 μm; Z-data height scale bar: 0–50 nm. 
To investigate the effect of the textured ITO anode on device performance of OSCs, we fabricated ITO (patterned or non-patterned)/MoO3 (10 nm)/P3HT:PCBM (150 nm)/Al (100 nm) bulk heterojunction solar cells29 as shown in Fig. 3a. Previously, most of the textured OSCs were achieved by grating the PEDOT:PSS layer by nanoimprint lithography as an anode buffer layer.28,30–33 However, PEDOT:PSS has several disadvantages for use in organic solar cells. The hygroscopic and acidic features of PEDOT:PSS could make the device unstable and device lifetime short. It has been shown that an ultrathin oxide film, such as MoO3, can replace PEDOT:PSS as the anode buffer layer.29,34,35 Although our textured ITO anode can also be applicable to the PEDOT:PSS anodic buffer layer (see ESI†), here, we, for the first time, report the employment of MoO3 as the buffer layer in nanostructured OSCs.

Fig. 3b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells with planar and patterned ITO anodes. The main characteristics of the corresponding short circuit (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), filling factor (FF), and PCE are listed in Table 1. The employment of the textured ITO as the anode of the solar cells greatly influenced device performance. With the increase in the eroding time of ITO, the Jsc and FF were first increased and then decreased, while Voc showed little effect as a function of eroding time. Compared to the device on the planar ITO anode, the Jsc and FF of the device with ITO eroded for 2.5 min increased from 8.14 mA cm−2 and 55% to 8.32 mA cm−2 and 61%, respectively. Thus, the formation of the honeycomb ITO pattern yielded the highest efficiency of 3.2%, showing an enhancement of 15% as compared to the planar device, which is mainly due to the enhancement in Jsc and FF.

Photocurrent generation is principally governed by three major factors, i.e., the number of absorbed photons, the number of carriers generated by exciton separation at the donor and acceptor interface, and the efficiency of charge collection.36 Textured solar cells have been shown to reduce light reflection due to good matching of the refractive index with air as compared to a planar device. The observed reflective behavior was attributed to a concept of gradual refractive index that has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated by several research groups.22,37,38 In order to find out the reason for the increase in Jsc of our devices, the reflectance measurement was conducted over a broad wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm, which covers most of the solar spectrum. Fig. 4b shows the full reflectance of our devices. The main absorption of P3HT of P3HT:PCBM is located in the range of 375–650 nm (see Fig. 4a). In this wavelength range, we can see that the reflectance spectra of solar cells with the patterned ITO anodes (eroded for 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 min) except the one eroded for 3.5 min are identical, and the reflection is suppressed as compared to the solar cell with a planar ITO anode. Furthermore, the refractive indexes of the ITO anodes with different eroding times (Fig. 4c), characterized by ellipsometry spectroscopy, show that the refractive index decreases with the eroding time, but no obvious change is observed for those eroded for 2.5–3.5 min. Certainly, the reduction of light reflection of the devices with ITO anodes eroded for 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 min could enhance light absorption, leading to an increase of absorbed photons. However, the characteristics of the reflection spectra do not synchronously follow the change of the absorption spectra (Fig. 4a), and are not well consistent with the changing trend of the observed device performance, e.g., Jsc and PCE. This kind of inconsistency was also observed by Chen et al.,22 but without pointing out this behavior. As a result, only characterization of the reflection property is not enough to explain the change of device performance.22,28 We can also find inconsistency between the device performance (Table 1) and absorption (Fig. 4a) in the case of devices with ITO anodes eroded for 2.0 min and 3.0 min. Therefore, we believe that enhanced light trapping is not the only reason for performance improvement of the solar cells. Furthermore, the changes of reflection and absorption cannot be fully reflected in the change of refractive index of the etched ITO electrodes, which indicates that the changes of reflection and absorption of the devices are not exclusively caused by the eroded ITO electrodes but may also be associated with the morphology change of the P3HT:PCBM films induced by the textured ITO electrodes as discussed below.
 Fig. 4  Optical properties of solar cells built on ITO anodes eroded for different times. (a) Absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM on ITO/MoO3 with patterned or planar ITO anodes; (b) the full reflectance spectra of ITO/MoO3/P3HT:PCBM with patterned or planar ITO anodes; and (c) refractive indexes of ITO anodes eroded for different times. 
We further measured external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices (Fig. 3c). The differences in EQE provide the information on generated charge carriers and charge collection efficiency. The EQE spectra are also not in line with the reflection spectra and absorption spectra of the devices. As a result, the origin of the improved photocurrent and in turn the PCE is only partly attributed to the light-trapping optical effect. The EQE spectra indicate that there is an obvious increase in the number of carriers generated and/or an improvement in the charge transport/collection efficiency for the devices with ITO anodes eroded for 2.5 min and 3.0 min as compared to the device with planar ITO anodes. As it is well known, exciton separation and charge carrier transport strongly rely on the morphology of the active layer and donor–acceptor interface,1,2,5,6,12,17,29 P3HT:PCBM in the present case. It has also been reported recently that the structured interface between the organic and metal cathode can increase electron collection.15
To show the morphological and interfacial changes stemming from the texture of the ITO anode, we depict typical AFM images of the P3HT:PCBM active layers fabricated on patterned or planar ITO/MoO3 (Fig. 5). Without patterning, the surface of the P3HT:PCBM active layer is smooth with a RMS roughness of 0.84 nm. The RMS roughness of the surfaces of P3HT:PCBM on ITO/MoO3 with the ITO eroded for 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 min is 1.71, 1.75, 1.73, and 1.66 nm, respectively, which was averaged from three different sample regions of each sample. The roughest surface of the active layer is that on the ITO eroded for 2.5 min. Such a morphology change of the active layer guided by the eroded ITO substrate might be due to graphoepitaxy.39–41 Hillside-like etching-induced steps could promote graphoepitaxial growth,39–41 which can be produced by wet chemical etching as in the present case, instead of the RIE technique. This is due to the mostly vertical delivery of reactive ions in the RIE method, making RIE produce very anisotropic etch profiles, which is in contrast to the typically isotropic profiles of wet chemical etching. The wrinkle-like surface morphology of the active layer on patterned ITO could extend the donor–acceptor contact interface area and allow for efficient exciton separation, carrier transport and collection.15,42–46 As plotted in Fig. 6, it appears that the rougher the ITO surface (also the organic layer), the higher the PCE of the OSCs except the device built on the ITO anode eroded for 3.5 min. Although the surfaces of the ITO eroded for 3.5 min and the organic layer on this ITO anode are rougher than those of the untreated ITO and the organic layer on it, the PCE of the device built on the eroded ITO anode is lower than that built on the untreated ITO anode. The change of device performance of these two devices is in line with the difference of absorption (Fig. 4a) at the wavelengths of 300–500 nm, but not in the range of about 570–800 nm. As mentioned above the main absorption of P3HT of the P3HT:PCBM layer is located in the range of 375–650 nm. Thus, other factors may contribute to the difference of device performance. The eroded height of this ITO anode was estimated to be about 15.4 nm. Due to the isotropic etching, the whole ITO surface was etched in this case; and the effective thickness of ITO is about 134.6 nm. The changes of the ITO thickness and surface electronic states induced by the etching could influence electrical properties of the ITO anode, and in turn the device performance of the solar cell. Compared to other devices, the reason for the complex phenomena of optical properties of the device built on the ITO eroded for 3.5 min is not clear at present. This cannot be simply explained by the changes of roughness (Fig. 6) and the refractive index (Fig. 4c). A more detailed study is needed.
 Fig. 5  Typical AFM images of the P3HT:PCBM active layers on ITO/MoO3 with the ITO eroded for different times. (a) Eroded for 0 min (RMS roughness of 0.84 nm); (b) eroded for 2.0 min (RMS roughness of 1.71 nm); (c) eroded for 2.5 min (RMS roughness of 1.75 nm); (d) eroded for 3.0 min (RMS roughness of 1.73 nm); and (e) eroded for 3.5 min (RMS roughness of 1.66 nm). 
 Fig. 6  Relationship between the RMS roughness of the ITO anode and the PCE of the solar cells. 
Moreover, we found, under the same eroding conditions for patterning ITO, that a thicker anode buffer layer, such as 30 nm PEDOT:PSS, led to less effect on the device performance (see ESI†). This is mainly because a much thicker PEDOT:PSS layer smoothened the roughness of the textured ITO anode. This comparison obviously suggests that the morphological and interfacial changes may play a dominant role not only in the enhanced light absorption but also in exciton separation and charge carrier transport and collection, and they may be more important than the effect induced by the refractive index change of ITO as we compare the device properties of devices employing PEDOT:PSS as the anode buffer layer. Therefore, the improved abilities of exciton separation and charge carrier transport and collection in such a textured device, combined with the enhanced light absorption which was induced by the eroded ITO anode and optimal P3HT:PCBM morphology, improved the Jsc and FF and in turn PCE of our solar cells.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a simple, low-cost, and solution-based way to nanopattern the ITO electrode just by spin-coating of PS nanospheres and chemical erosion of the ITO electrode using PS nanospheres as the etching template. By employing textured ITO as the anode, the P3HT:PCBM solar cells with an ultrathin MoO3 anodic buffer layer showed improvement in Jsc and FF, and in turn yielded a PCE of 3.20%, an enhancement of 15% as compared to the planar device. Furthermore, we have elucidated the underlying reasons for the improvement in photocurrent and PCE of the structured OSCs. We mainly contributed to the improvement of the enhanced exciton separation, efficient charge carrier transport and collection resulting from the textured device, in particular the optimized morphology of the P3HT:PCBM active layer, which is combined with enhancement of light absorption due to the change of refractive index of patterned ITO and its induced optimal morphology of the active layer. Without the need of sophisticated instruments, our method is a low-cost, time-saving, and reliable method to engineer large-area ITO textures for high performance OSCs.
Experimental section
Patterning ITO electrode
The ITO-coated glass substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with a glass detergent and deionized water, followed by acetone, and dried using N2 gas. Prior to use, the cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for about 5 min. PS nanospheres were deposited onto the clean ITO substrate by spin-coating under different conditions such as spin speed, spin time, and concentration of PS. In the present case, the optimized concentration of PS nanospheres in de-ionized water was 2.5 wt%. The ITO substrate with the PS monolayer on it was eroded by the vapor of concentrated HCl solution (ω = 37.5%) with different etching times. Removal of leftover PS nanospheres was performed by ultrasonication in chloroform. Finally, the eroded ITO substrate was cleaned in isopropanol for 10 min and dried by using N2 gas.
ITO/MoO3/P3HT:PCBM/Al bulk heterojunction device fabrication
First, a MoO3 buffer layer with a thickness of about 10 nm was deposited onto the planar or patterned ITO substrates by vacuum thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa.29 Second, a P3HT:PCBM (mass ratio of 1:0.9 in dichlorobenzene (2 wt%)) layer (150 nm) was prepared by spin-coating on the MoO3 layer at a speed of 550 rpm for 120 s, and then dried for 20 min at room temperature in a glove box. Finally, an Al layer (about 100 nm thick) was deposited on P3HT:PCBM by thermal evaporation. Our working device with an area of 9 mm2 was defined by depositing the Al cathode.47 We fabricated 8 devices for each type of ITO anodes. The results discussed here are the best ones among the devices. The averaged parameters from 8 cells for each type of the devices are shown in Table S2 (see ESI†).
Characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar illumination with Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured with a Stanford lock-in amplifier 8300 unit. Absorption and reflection spectra were recorded by using a UV-2450 UV-vis Shimadzu spectrophotometer. The refractive indexes of the ITO substrates with different eroding times were obtained by measuring the ITO substrates with ellipsometry spectroscopy at incident angles of 65°, 70°, and 75° in the wavelength range of 190–1700 nm. The taken data were then fitted by using a Cauchy model. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image was taken using a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image was taken using a Veeco MultiMode scanning probe microscope operated in tapping mode in air.48 The film thickness was measured by an AMBIOS XP-1 high-resolution surface profiler.
