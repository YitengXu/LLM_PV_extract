    , Accepted 12th December 2022First published on 4th January 2023AbstractSimultaneously achieving photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation and degradation of organic pollutants coupled with H2 generation for bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is highly desirable, while it is still hampered by low charge transport ability along with poor chemical durability. Herein, we have developed a NiFeOx co-catalyst decorated N-incorporated BiVO4 photoanode (N-BiVO4/NiFeOx), which not only can facilitate the charge transport efficiency but also efficiently suppresses the photo-corrosion. More specifically, the Fe sites trap photo-generated holes for promoting PEC processes and the Ni sites provide electrons to V sites for inhibiting V5+ dissolution of BiVO4. As a result, the large size N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode with outstanding chemical stability exhibits efficient water oxidation and tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) degradation coupled with H2 production performance. This work offers a promising avenue to design a high-performance photoanode and a new insight into antibiotic wastewater treatment.
1. Introduction
Owing to the current serious energy crisis and environmental pollution, converting solar energy into sustainable and clean hydrogen energy is urgently required.1–4 Solar-assisted water splitting has been regarded as one of the most promising strategies to achieve practical applications via using photoelectrochemical cells.5,6 Among various photoanode materials, N-type semiconductor BiVO4 is identified as a desirable candidate because the appropriate bandgap (2.4–2.5 eV) can absorb a high portion of visible light and the favorable conduction band (CB) edge position is very close to the thermodynamic potential of hydrogen (H2) evolution.7–9 Nevertheless, poor carrier mobility and sluggish surface water oxidation kinetics severely restrict the solar to hydrogen efficiency.10–12 Specifically, there are fewer active sites on the surface of BiVO4, so the bulk of photogenerated electron–hole pairs recombine rather than participating in the water splitting reaction at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces.13–15 Accordingly, a number of tactics such as extrinsic doping,16,17 loading co-catalysts,18,19 facet tailoring20,21 and constructing heterojunctions22,23 have been applied to address these limitations.
Element doping, adding a small fraction of impurity atoms in the regular crystal lattice, can significantly enhance the carrier density of semiconductors.24,25 For instance, the Yang group fabricated a Mo doped BiVO4 photoanode, which dramatically reduced the loss of interfacial energy and improved the open-circuit potential (OCP) of BiVO4 photoelectrochemical cells.26 Gamelin et al. demonstrated that tungsten (W) doped BiVO4 could efficiently improve the electron mobility and reduce surface electron–hole recombination.27 In addition, some nonmetallic elements as anionic dopants, such as C, N, S and P, have been adopted to improve optical absorption and diminish their band gap.28 The Taga group reported that N doping into substitutional sites of TiO2 had been verified to be essential for reducing the band gap and improving the photocatalytic activity.29 Although doping studies can facilitate charge transport as well as optical absorption of BiVO4, it still suffers from serious photo-corrosion owing to the dissolution of V5+ ions during the process of PEC water splitting.30 Therefore, decorating co-catalysts on the surface of BiVO4 is an essential aspect to stabilize photoanodes and provides more active sites for PEC water oxidation.
Recently, a BiVO4 photoanode modified with various co-catalysts has been broadly demonstrated to be a promising avenue to promote PEC water oxidation activity.31,32 Specifically, these catalysts can efficiently utilize surface-reaching photo-generated holes from the bulk BiVO4 and minimize the reaction overpotential, accelerating the surface reaction kinetics.33 Among various co-catalysts, VIII metal (Ni, Co, and Fe) oxides or layered double hydroxides have attracted worldwide interest.34,35 For example, Gong et al. demonstrated that introducing Co3O4 co-catalysts on BiVO4 could achieve a charge separation efficiency of up to 77% in the bulk and 47% on the surface of catalysts.36 Choi's group serially applied double layered co-catalysts on BiVO4 (BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH), which efficiently inhibited interface electron–hole recombination for facilitating water oxidation.37 Nonetheless, the interfacial interaction between co-catalysts and BiVO4 is still ambiguous and insufficiently understood.38 Therefore, ascertaining the interaction is extremely desirable for constructing a photoanode with high performance and durability.
Herein, we reported a NiFeOx co-catalyst decorated N-BiVO4 (N-BiVO4/NiFeOx) photoanode, which not only efficiently boosts charge separation but also obviously suppresses the V5+ dissolution of BiVO4. As a result, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode possesses excellent chemical durability and a high photocurrent density of 5.40 ± 0.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE up to 4.1-times higher than that of the BiVO4 photoanode. In addition, the photoanode shows superior activity of TCH degradation with a conversion rate of 85%. More importantly, when the electrode area is extended to 9 cm2, the large size N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode can achieve as long as 90 hour water oxidation performance, and well maintain the degradation efficiency of TCH in a continuous-flow photoelectrochemical cell.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All chemical reagents were acquired from Aldrich without further purification. FTO glass with a resistance of 6 Ω was purchased from South China Xiangcheng Technology Co., Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of nano-porous N-BiVO4 photoanodes
The nano-porous BiVO4 photoanode was fabricated according to Lee and Choi's method.37 Nitrogen incorporation was realized by annealing BiVO4 electrodes at various temperatures (350–400 °C) and times (60–150 min) under a 1% NH3/N2 atmosphere. The generated photoanodes with the best PEC properties were annealed at 350 °C for 120 min in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 (Fig. S1†).
2.3. Synthesis of N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanodes
The N-BiVO4 electrode was immersed in 15 mL NiCl2·6H2O (10 mM) and 5 mL FeCl3·6H2O (10 mM) freshly mixed metal salt solution (pH ∼ 2.8) for 15 min, and then its pH was adjusted to 8 by adding 2 M NaOH solution with gentle stirring. Subsequently, the co-catalyst loading process was that the above solution and electrode were left standing at 25 °C for 50 min. Finally, the as-prepared N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoelectrode was washed with deionized water and further dried at 60 °C in an oven.
2.4. Material characterization
SEM (JSM-IT500HR, Japan) and HR-TEM (Tecnai G2 F30) were performed to investigate the surface microstructure characteristics of the products. The crystalline structures of the photoanodes were identified by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D2 PHASER). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600) by using BaSO4 as the reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to measure the surface elements of samples on a PHI-5000C ESCA. The photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay spectra were obtained on a fluorescence spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau). A Bruker A300 was used on the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals of ·OH. The transient-state surface photovoltage responses (TS-SPV) were taken on an Edinburgh FLS1000 equipped with an Oxford cryostat designed for optical measurement. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed by using an Agilent 1290II-6460.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
A gas chromatography system (GC, GC-7806) equipped with an Ar gas carrier and TCD detector was employed to measure the amounts of evolved H2 and O2. The PEC performance was examined using an electrochemical workstation (Corrtest 310H) based on a three-electrode configuration. The light source was a 300 W Xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (100 mW cm−2). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, the measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the equation:ERHE = 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH + EAg/AgCl
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was determined using a solar simulator equipped with a monochromator and was calculated by using the following equation:39  where Plight refers to the incident photon intensity (mA cm−2) and J refers to the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) obtained from the specified light wavelength (nm).
Based on LSV curves, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated using this equation:  where Plight refers to the incident photon power density (100 mW cm2) and Vbias is the measured potential (V).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV was performed under AM 1.5G illumination in the frequency range 106 to 0.1 Hz. Mott–Schottky spectra were collected with a frequency of 1 kHz and an amplitude of 10 mV.
The following equation was employed to study the transient time constant (τ):40D = (I(t) − I(st))/(I(in) − I(st))where I(t) refers to the photocurrent at time t, I(in) refers to the photocurrent at t = 0 and I(st) refers to the steady state photocurrent.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared BiVO4 photoanodes in Fig. S2† showed the unchanged monoclinic structure after NH3 treatment and deposition of NiFeOx. Fig. 1a shows the top-view as well as cross-sectional SEM images of the N-BiVO4 photoanode and shows a similar worm-like porous structure to BiVO4 (Fig. S3†). Interestingly, when decorating the NiFeOx co-catalyst, the N-BiVO4 photoanode presents a slightly rough surface (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, HR-TEM was employed to investigate the surface morphological structure. Compared to N-BiVO4 (Fig. 1c), N-BiVO4/NiFeOx possesses a uniform thin and amorphous NiFeOx co-catalyst layer with a thickness of ∼4 nm (Fig. 1d, S4 and S5†). The corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy element mapping and line-scan images (Fig. 1e and S6†) display uniformly distributed Ni and Fe elements on the N-BiVO4 surface.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of (a) the top view image with the cross-sectional image of N-BiVO4 and (b) the top view image of N-BiVO4/NiFeOx; TEM images of (c) N-BiVO4; (d) HR-TEM image of N-BiVO4/NiFeOx; (e) TEM-EDS elemental mapping images of N-BiVO4/NiFeOx; high-resolution XPS spectra of BiVO4, N-BiVO4 and N-BiVO4/NiFeOx: (f) Bi 4f, (g) V 2P, (h) O 1s, and (i) N 1s. 
To explore the built-in potential and band offsets at the photoanode interface, XPS was performed (Fig. S7†).41 As depicted in Fig. 1f and g, the Bi 4f and V 2p of the N-BiVO4 photoanode shift to lower binding energy in comparison with BiVO4, which is due to the incorporation of N leading to changes in the ligand type (O to N) and decreases in the coordination number of Bi3+ and V5+ ions. Moreover, the N 1s XPS spectra confirmed the existence of N in the BiVO4 lattice (Fig. 1i). In Fig. 1h, it can be observed that N-BiVO4 shows a much higher oxygen vacancy (Ovac) content than BiVO4 because three O2− ions need to be removed for every two N3− ions incorporation, thus generating an Ovac. The much higher Ovac content after decorating the NiFeOx co-catalyst is ascribed to the presence of Ovac in the NiFeOx co-catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. S8,† two different oxidation states were detected for both Ni 2p and Fe 2p XPS spectra, which contributes to PEC performance.42,43 The more upward band blending after decorating NiFeOx illustrates efficient hole migration from N-BiVO4 to NiFeOx in the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode (Fig. S9†).44
3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties
The PEC water oxidation was carried out in a 0.5 M K3BO3 electrolyte (KBi, pH = 9.3) under AM 1.5G illumination. As shown in Fig. 2a, the N-BiVO4 photoanode presents 2.37 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE, much higher than that of BiVO4 (1.31 mA cm−2) due to the accelerated charge transfer efficiency. After decorating the NiFeOx co-catalyst, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode achieves an excellent photocurrent density of 5.40 mA cm−2, which is significantly higher than that of BiVO4/NiFeOx (3.81 mA cm−2), N-BiVO4 and BiVO4 (Fig. S10 and S11†). Notably, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode shows the lowest onset potential, indicating that the NiFeOx co-catalyst layer and the N-incorporation can effectively improve oxygen evolution kinetics. Besides, the results of chopped LSV (Fig. S12†) and dark LSV curves (Fig. S13†) demonstrate that water splitting is driven by photoexcited charge carriers, and the enhanced photocurrent density originates from the accelerated surface reaction kinetics.45 On the basis of LSV curves, the ABPE was calculated to elucidate the photocurrent efficiency (Fig. 2b). The maximal ABPE value of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode can reach 1.79%, higher than that of BiVO4/NiFeOx (0.96%), N-BiVO4 (0.46%) and BiVO4 (0.26%). To elucidate the influence of monochromatic light on photocurrent density, the IPCE was measured and is shown in Fig. 2c and S14.† The IPCE value of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode is much higher than that of other electrodes and reaches 95.5%. In addition, the recombination behavior of charges was studied according to chopping photocurrent density (Fig. S15†). In Fig. 2d, the time constant of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode is 9.0 s, much higher than that of BiVO4/NiFeOx (4.7 s), N-BiVO4 (3.0 s) and BiVO4 (2.2 s), which suggests the effectively prolonged decay of photogenerated carriers.46,47 The EIS spectra further illustrate that the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode has the lowest charge transport resistance (Fig. 2e and Table S1†). Moreover, Mott–Schottky curves were recorded to analyse the flat-band potential of electrodes. As observed in Fig. S16,† N-BiVO4/NiFeOx possesses more negative flat-band potential than N-BiVO4 and BiVO4, implying more favorable H2 evolution at the cathode.48

The wavelength and intensity of the excitation pulse are 355 nm and 50 μJ, respectively; (h and i) charge separation and transfer efficiency of BiVO4, N-BiVO4 and N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanodes. 
The N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode exhibits the lowest intensity of PL spectra at 517 nm, illustrating a relatively high charge separation ability (Fig. S17†). Furthermore, TRPL was performed to explore the energy relaxation process and charge carrier transfer capability under excited states.49,50 As depicted in Fig. 2f, the average carrier lifetime of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode (3.35 ns) is almost double that of the BiVO4 counterpart (1.82 ns), evidently confirming the reduced charge recombination (Table S2†). The TS-SPV responses of all photoanodes are positive signals, which is due to the migration behavior of the surface photogenerated holes (Fig. 2g). Obviously, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode shows the strongest photovoltage signal and the longest-lived holes, demonstrating that photogenerated holes reaching the surface of the photoanode are greatly promoted and surface recombination is dramatically suppressed.21,51 The open-circuit potential (OCP) of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode was measured as shown in Fig. S18† and shows higher photovoltage intensity compared with N-BiVO4 and BiVO4, indicating a greater driving force for injecting photoinduced holes into the electrolyte for the process of PEC water splitting.52 In UV-vis absorbance spectra, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx and N-BiVO4 photoanodes exhibit a slight shift of the band edge absorption (Fig. S19†), implying that N-doped on BiVO4 is beneficial to light absorption. To further analyse water oxidation kinetics, the charge separation (ηsep) and charge transfer efficiencies (ηtran) were calculated (Fig. S20 and 21†). Note that the ηsep of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode reaches 98.9%, accelerating water oxidation kinetics (Fig. 2h). Besides, the ηtran of the N-BiVO4 photoanode reaches 61.7%, which is 1.6-times higher than that of BiVO4. After decorating with a thin NiFeOx co-catalyst layer, its ηtran is significantly enhanced, which is due to Fe sites trapping photogenerated holes (Fig. 2i).
3.3 Water oxidation stability and mechanism
It is noteworthy that the water adsorption at the interface of photoanodes is crucial for the water oxidation process, and their hydrophilicity was explored by using the contact angle (CA). As depicted in Fig. 3a and b, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode (20.5°) possesses a much smaller CA compared with N-BiVO4 (49.4°), indicating that the decoration of the NiFeOx co-catalyst layer is conducive to improving the electrode surface wettability and thus accelerating oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, promoting the stability of the BiVO4 photoanode is still a thorny but particularly important issue. As seen in Fig. S22,† the N-BiVO4 photoanode exhibited poor PEC durability owing to the severe photo-corrosion (Fig. S23†), but the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode showed a stable photocurrent density. Meanwhile, the XRD, SEM and TEM spectra after stability testing further demonstrate that the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode possesses excellent PEC stability (Fig. S24 and S25†). The amount of gas produced was collected by using an on-line GC, and the stoichiometric ratio of H2 and O2 generated is near 2:1, which is in agreement with the theoretical evolution amount calculated by using the photocurrent density (Fig. 3c). In addition, the Table S3† shows the excellent PEC performance of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode in comparison to BiVO4 based photoanodes. To investigate the surface electronic structure change of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode after testing, XPS spectra were employed. Note that the relative content of Ni3+ and Fe3+ species in the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode after testing has been obviously increased compared with that before PEC testing (Fig. 3d and e). The Bi, V, N and O species of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode before and after testing are barely shifted, suggesting that their surface chemical states hardly change after long-term testing (Fig. S26 and Table S4†). Importantly, to further achieve the practical applications for PEC water splitting, a large size N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode (9 cm2) was fabricated. As shown in Fig. 3f and S27,† it exhibits ultra-stable photocurrent during the consecutive irradiation of 90 hours, demonstrating high performance and strong photo-corrosion resistance. Inspired by the above results, a possible mechanism for dramatically enhanced PEC activity and stability is proposed in Fig. 3g. The PEC activities of the BiVO4 photoanode are enormously affected by poor charge transfer efficiency, surface electron–hole recombination and serious photo-corrosion (left in Fig. 3g). In contrast, N-incorporation can facilitate charge transfer efficiency and the NiFeOx co-catalyst layer can efficiently suppress the photo-corrosion (right in Fig. 3g). More specifically, photoexcited holes could quickly migrate from BiVO4 to Fe sites to participate in the OER for promoting the PEC activity. Meanwhile, the Ni sites provide electrons to V sites for efficiently inhibiting V5+ dissolution of BiVO4 and boosting PEC durability.

3.4 PEC degradation of TCH
Simultaneous PEC wastewater treatment coupled with H2 evolution is one of the most promising technologies to solve environmental and energy issues.53,54 Therefore, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode is applied for the degradation of TCH coupled with H2 production. As expected, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode exhibits 4-times enhanced photocurrent density in comparison to BiVO4 (Fig. 4a). Compared to N-BiVO4 and BiVO4, the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode possesses a significantly improved TCH degradation activity with an 85% degradation rate in 2 hours (Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the data points of concentration–time for all electrodes are determined by linear first-order kinetics (Fig. S25†). It is interesting to note that the onset potential of TCH degradation was negatively shifted and the photocurrent density was obviously improved (Fig. S26†), illustrating that PEC degradation of TCH is much easier than the OER. To illustrate the superior degradation efficiency of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode via a PEC cell, the comparison of TCH degradation by various reaction processes was performed (Fig. 4c). The degradation rate of direct photolysis (PL) after 2 hours is only 8%, demonstrating that the TCH degradation is relatively difficult under natural conditions. Fig. 4d shows the PEC degradation of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode with different initial concentrations of TCH at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Although the concentration of TCH is up to 100 mg L−1, the degradation rate of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode can still reach 53%, indicating that it has great potential to be applied in high-concentration wastewater treatment. The PEC degradation efficiency of TCH for four cyclic measurements of the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode is hardly declined, implying outstanding cycle stability (Fig. 4e). To further explore its durability, the i–t curve was obtained after four cycle tests (Fig. 4f). Note that the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode displays a stable photocurrent density for over 10 hours and an unchanged surface morphology after long-term measurement (inset in Fig. 4f).

To realize the practical applications for wastewater treatment coupled with H2 evolution, continuous-flow photoelectrochemical cells were designed (Fig. 5a). As shown Fig. 5b, the large size N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode (9 cm2) achieves a 62% TCH degradation rate under a continuous-flow rate of 0.25 mL min−1. The EPR responses for DMPO-·OH generation by the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode were determined, disclosing that ·OH is the main active species for TCH degradation (Fig. 5c). Based on the above analysis and LC-MS spectra (Fig. S27†), the possible degradation pathway of TCH by the N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode was proposed (Fig. 5d). Initially, TCH (m/z = 446.7) was oxidized to produce the substance (m/z = 432.7). Subsequently, the ring-opening reaction and over-oxidation reaction occurred to generate these substances (m/z = 363.2, 348.8, 310.8, 312.7, 174.8, 212.8 and 122.9). Finally, these intermediates were converted into small molecules (CO2 and H2O).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed N-incorporation into the oxygen sites of BiVO4 in an NH3 atmosphere, promoting hole transfer efficiency. Furthermore, NiFeOx co-catalyst decorated N-BiVO4 not only can provide active sites for boosting PEC activity but also efficiently suppresses the V5+ dissolution of BiVO4. The resultant N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density (5.40 ± 0.1 mA cm−2) and TCH degradation efficiency (85%). More important, to simulate practical application systems, a large size N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode (9 cm2) was fabricated. As excepted, the large size N-BiVO4/NiFeOx photoanode exhibits superior chemical stability, which can reach up to 90 hour water oxidation activity and maintain excellent TCH degradation efficiency in a continuous-flow PEC cell. This work provides a new insight for constructing high-performance photoanodes and achieving multi-application PEC processes.
