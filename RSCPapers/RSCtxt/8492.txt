    , Accepted 23rd March 2016First published on 24th March 2016AbstractSmall-molecule hole transporting materials based on an indolocarbazole core were synthesized and incorporated into perovskite solar cells, which displayed a power conversion efficiency up to 15.24%. The investigated hole transporting materials were synthesized in three steps from commercially available and relatively inexpensive starting materials without using expensive catalysts. Various electro-optical measurements (UV-vis, CV, hole mobility, DSC, TGA, ionization potential) have been carried out to characterize the new hole transporting materials.
Since the first publication on organolead halide perovskites as light absorbers in liquid based solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81% for CH3NH3PbI3 by Miyasaka,1 the past few years have witnessed unprecedented rapid development in perovskite based solar cells (PSCs).2 Record efficiency exceeding 20% have been reported and further improvements are expected.3 In these cells, the hole transporting material (HTM) is one of the key components. Despite the significant efforts dedicated towards the development of new HTMs, the field is still dominated by costly 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), 2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino) spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,9′-fluorene] (FDT) and even more expensive poly[bis(4-phenyl)-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine].4–7 Alternative small molecule HTMs such as azulene-,8 pyrene-,9 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-,10 linear π-conjugated-,11 butadiene-,12 azomethine-13 and methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole-based14 structures pave the way towards low-cost, environmentally friendly and efficient HTMs. However, most of these molecules fail to show performance similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD.
Therefore, the development of efficient and inexpensive HTMs with optimal electronic properties remains an attractive goal. One of the candidates for such HTMs is indolocarbazole derivatives, particularly indolo[3,2-b]carbazoles (ICZ) and triazatruxenes (TAT), which have been known as HTMs for the active layer of various optoelectronic devices. The core of these molecules being structured from two and three indole units condensed via a benzene ring can be considered as a two-dimensional π-system, which provides a large aromatic surface to overlap with each other for efficient intermolecular charge transport. Hu et al. reported an ICZ naphthyl derivative, which shows an unusual atropisomerism and excellent hole-transport properties in organic light-emitting diodes.15 In 2004, the first organic field effect transistor (FET) using an ICZ derivative as an active layer was successfully fabricated.16N,N-Disubstituted indolo[3,2-b]carbazoles and polymeric analogues have also been reported as new HTMs for fabrication of organic FETs.17–19 Previous studies have shown that 5,11-bis(4-octylphenyl)indolo[3,2-b]carbazole provides a self-organized layered structure upon vacuum deposition and high FET mobility can be achieved.20 Furthermore, due to sufficient charge mobilities and suitable ionization potentials ICZ-based derivatives can be applied in organic photoreceptors.21 TAT-based HTMs were earlier used both in organic22,23 and hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs).24,25 A remarkable PCE of 17.7% was realized using TAT derivatives with an extended π-conjugate system via Suzuki and Buchwald coupling reactions.25 However, these HTMs require inert reaction conditions, boronic precursors or transition metal catalysts, making large scale production more costly.
Recently, we have demonstrated a simple one-step synthesis providing solution processable star-shaped charge-transport materials with a varied number of different phenylethenyl side arms, which extend the π-conjugated system of the molecule noticeably.26–28 Such a molecularly engineered carbazole- and triphenylamine-based HTMs demonstrate comparatively high hole drift mobility (up to 0.017 cm2 V−1 s−1), similar to the values that have been reported in the literature.28–32
Considering this, here we report new HTMs for efficient PSCs, by adopting a facile synthetic strategy. Two novel indolocarbazole derivatives HTM-1 and HTM-2 (Fig. 1) have been synthesized from inexpensive precursor materials and characterized to reveal their electrochemical and optoelectronic properties. Moreover, they do not require an extensive and expensive synthetic procedure. PSCs employing HTM-2 shows a promising PCE up to 15.24%, in comparison with that of the reference cell employing spiro-OMeTAD (17.02%). Furthermore, its simple three-step synthesis and the ready availability of the starting materials make this HTM very appealing for commercial prospects of PSCs.

The general synthesis procedure for the preparation of 2,8-bis-[2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethenyl]-5,11-diethyl-5,11-dihidroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (HTM-1) and 3,8,13-tris[2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethenyl]-5,10,15-triethyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-indolo-[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole (HTM-2) is shown in Scheme 1. The ICZ core 1 was prepared by intermolecular condensation of commercially available 3,3′-bisindolylmethane via a one-step procedure.33 The obtained planar ICZ core was then attached with ethyl chains to obtain the alkylated precursor 2, which in condensation with 2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)acetaldehyde in the presence of (±)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid (CSA) provided the final HTM-1 containing phenylethenyl-engineered side arms. The presence of methoxy groups allows tuning of the HOMO level in order to adapt the molecule's donor nature. Furthermore, the methoxy groups have been demonstrated in the literature as effective anchors for the interface between the perovskite and HTM.34

HTM-2 containing the TAT core with phenylethenyl-engineered side arms was prepared by the analogous procedures from triazatruxene 3, which was synthesized from commercially available 2-indolinone via a one-step reaction (Scheme 1).35 The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were verified by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Experimental details and characterization can be found in the ESI.†
The thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. HTM-1 and HTM-2 are stable up to 414 °C (Fig. S1†) and 427 °C (Fig. 2a), respectively, confirming their good thermal stability and stating practical utilization. DSC scans demonstrate that the TAT core-based HTM is fully amorphous and shows only a glass transition temperature (Tg) at 138 °C (Fig. 2b, Table 1). Tg of HTM-2 is higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (126 °C), indicating a more stable amorphous state and reduced tendency to crystallize, which is beneficial for the overall device stability.36 In contrast, the endothermic melting peaks have been observed in both DSC heating scans for HTM-1 with the ICZ core. Interestingly, the DSC curve for HTM-1 at the first heating reveals a number of polymorphous changes before melting at 299 °C (Fig. S1†).

The UV-vis absorption bands of the ICZ core-based HTM-1 and TAT core-based HTM-2 measured in THF are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra of the parent compounds 2 and 4 are given for comparison reasons. Indeed, the spectrum of the alkylated ICZ core 2 consists of a weak band in the long wavelength region due to n–π* followed by a broad and intense band in the UV region due to π–π* transitions. These results are typical of planar conjugated systems, which is obviously the case for these bridged indolocarbazole derivatives.37 The π–π* absorption bands for HTM-1 are bathochromically shifted with respect to the reference 2 by 15 nm, indicating an increase in the size of the π-conjugated system due to ICZ core engineering by phenylethenyl side arms. Obviously, this is more expressed in the case of HTM-2: the π–π* absorption band is bathochromically shifted by 35 nm.

When considering the use of an organic material for hole-transport applications it is important to have an understanding of its solid state ionization energies (Ip). This understanding can help in identifying suitable partner for organic transport and inorganic electrode materials. The ionization potential was measured by the photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) method (Fig. S2†) and the results are presented in Table 2; the measurement error is evaluated as 0.03 eV. ICZ and TAT core-based HTMs have similar Ip values, 5.28 eV and 5.34 eV, respectively. The energy offset of the EHOMO (ca. −5.34 eV) relative to that of the MAPbI3 (−5.40 eV)38 presents enough driving force for the charge injection process. The ground-state oxidation (Eox) potentials of the indolocarbazole-based HTM-1 and HTM-2 were measured employing the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique (Table 2). These values do not represent any absolute solid-state or gas-phase ionization energies but can be used to compare different compounds relative to one another. The cyclic voltammograms of both synthesized HTMs show quasi-reversible oxidation signals (Fig. S3 and Table S1†) and differences in the CV results are quite small. The EHOMO energy levels determined in CV experiments are in agreement with the PESA measurement results.

The new indolocarbazole-based semiconductors HTM-1 and HTM-2 were tested as HTMs in PSCs (where the perovskite precursor contained a cation and anion mixture) using a device stack of fluorine doped tin oxide(FTO)/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au. The HTM layer was applied onto the perovskite from a solution in chlorobenzene containing 330 mol% tert-butylpyridine, 50mol% tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) and 3 mol% FK209 (Co(III) oxidant) as additives. All fabrication details can be found in the ESI.† In Fig. 4, current density–voltage (JV) characteristics are shown. A maximum PCE of 15.24% under AM 1.5 G illumination was recorded in the perovskite device containing TAT core-based HTM-2 as a hole transporting material (Table S1†). The measured fill factor was 0.70, the current density (Jsc) was 20.53 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was 1042 mV (Fig. 4). Spiro-OMeTAD was used as a reference material and the best device from the same batch of solar cells, prepared following the same device fabrication procedure displayed a PCE of 17.04%. Depending on the preparation method and the cell architecture PSCs can exhibit hysteretic behavior, i.e. a discrepancy between the forward and backward scan, which can result in largely distorted performance parameters.39,40 For example, seemingly high PCEs can be achieved upon a fast scanning of the device from open-circuit to short-circuit conditions (reverse scan) but these values drop significantly at slower scan rates.40 Therefore, all JV measurements were taken at a slow scan rate of 10 mV s−1 resembling quasi steady-state conditions as suggested independently by Unger et al. and Kamat and co-workers.40,41 The full hysteresis loop with the corresponding performance parameter for each device is reported in Table S1† showing only a small mismatch between the forward and backward scans. In fact PCE values for the forward scan are around 5% lower compared to the reverse scan.
 Fig. 4  Best performing current density–voltage characteristics of PSC using HTM-1, HTM-2 and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. The voltage scan rate was 10 mV s−1 and no device preconditioning, such as light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for a long time, was applied before starting the measurement. The full hysteresis loop (forward and backward scan) for each scan is listed in Table S1.† 
Time-of-flight measurements were used to characterize charge-transporting properties of the synthesized HTMs. The obtained layers of the neat compound HTM-2 appeared to be uniform and transparent, while those of compound HTM-1 became opaque rapidly after the deposition. Therefore, a uniform layer of HTM-1 was obtained by casting the solution of its mixture with bisphenol-Z polycarbonate (PC-Z) in the weight ratio 1:1. The corresponding layers of spiro-OMeTAD were also prepared in order to compare the charge-transporting ability of new HTMs. Fig. S4† demonstrates representative dU/dt hole-transients for the thin film of the composition HTM-2/PC-Z (1:1). It exhibited a dispersive hole-transport; which along with the strong electric-field mobility dependence suggested the trap-dominant charge transport in this material. Nevertheless, well-defined transit times (tt) established from the intersection points of two asymptotes of double-logarithmic plots provided hole-drift mobility at respective applied fields. Moreover, for the samples of the spiro-OMeTAD composition with PC-Z hole transport is Gaussian and the transit time is defined in the linear plot of transients (Fig. S5†). Examples of mobility field dependencies are given in Fig. 5. In all the cases investigated mobility μ may be well approximated by the formula:  here μ0 is the zero field mobility, α is the Pool–Frenkel parameter and E is the electric field strength. Such mobility dependence can be explained in terms of Borsenberger and Weiss,42 and Borsenberger et al.43 disorder formalism. The mobility defining parameter μ0 and α values as well as the mobility value at the 6.4 × 105 V cm−1 field are given in Table 2.
 Fig. 5  The dependence of the hole-drift mobility on the applied electric field in the amorphous layers of compounds HTM-1, HTM-2, and spiro-OMeTAD in composition with PC-Z, 1:1. 
As seen from the results presented, the hole drift mobility values in the amorphous film of composition HTM-2 with PC-Z are higher than the ones for HTM-1 and under a strong electric field they are similar to the ones of spiro-OMeTAD measured under the same conditions. Nevertheless, the difference makes up to one order of magnitude under a weak electric field. These results are fully in agreement with the obtained parameters of the constructed PSC in this work.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a rapid and efficient synthesis of novel indolocarbazole-based two-dimensional HTMs comprising electron-rich methoxy substituents in phenylethenyl-engineered side arms. HTMs are obtained in three scalable synthetic steps, offering potentially much lower production costs in comparison with the most widely used spiro-OMeTAD. A remarkable power conversion efficiency of 15.24% was achieved using HTM-2 as the hole transporting material and a compositive perovskite as the absorber, which is on par with that of spiro-OMeTAD (17.03%). Triazatruxene core-based HTM-2 is an especially promising candidate because it can be handled in air, requires no high temperature annealing steps, can be solution deposited, possesses comparatively high mobility, and could be synthesized in three steps from commercially available and cheap materials, without using expensive catalysts.
