    , Accepted 14th May 2014First published on 19th May 2014AbstractQuantum cutting down-conversion has been the subject of intense research activity due to its wide application in optoelectronic devices. However, the energy transfer mechanism behind this down-conversion process is not fully understood. In this work, monodispersed Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes were synthesized by a hydrothermal route. Simultaneous phase transition from cubic to hexagonal and size modification are controlled by changing the Eu3+ doping concentration. Excited by 393 nm ultraviolet monochromatic light, Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes show quantum cutting down-conversion involving visible and broadband near-infrared emissions through an energy migration process 5D2 (Eu3+) → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+). Based on the emission spectra of Eu3+ ions, an improved method is proposed to calculate Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters and radiative transition probability. A comprehensive seven-level rate-equation model is developed to study the energy transfer mechanism. This work offers a method to calculate Judd–Ofelt parameters of opaque powder phosphors and to evaluate the population dynamics of excited states.
I. Introduction
In recent years, near-infrared quantum cutting down-conversion with the quantum efficiency higher than unity has attracted much attention, due to its promising applications in mercury-free fluorescent tubes, plasma display panels and Si solar cells.1–5 Since the first demonstration of the quantum cutting phenomenon in the deep blue region for lanthanide ions Pr3+ doped fluorides in the early 1970s,6,7 the focus of research on quantum cutting systems has shifted to the combination of two ions, such as Tb3+–Yb3+, Tm3+–Yb3+, Eu2+–Yb3+, and Nd3+–Yb3+, in rare earth ions codoped oxide powder and oxyfluoride glass ceramics, in which one ultraviolet photon is converted to two near-infrared photons (λ ∼ 1000 nm).8–18 So far, there have been few theoretical studies on the quantum cutting mechanism for the Re3+–Yb3+ (Re3+ = Tb3+, Tm3+, Eu2+, and Nd3+) ion couple. The underlying energy transfer mechanism of the quantum cutting process is still not quite clear, in particular, the population dynamics of excited states of Re3+ and Yb3+ ions in the cooperative energy transfer process from Re3+ to Yb3+.
To study the quantum cutting mechanism, it is necessary to calculate Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters ΩJ (J = 2, 4, 6), radiative transition probability, and non-radiative transition probability, before establishing dynamic balance rate equations. The Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters are very important for investigation of the local structure and bonding in the vicinity of rare-earth ions.19,20 Judd–Ofelt theory was proposed firstly by Judd and Ofelt,21,22 based on free-ion, static and single configuration approximations, and described theoretically the oscillator strength and radiative transition probability in the 4fN configuration of rare-earth ions by considering the electric-dipole and magnetic-dipole contributions. As reported in the literature, Judd–Ofelt optical parameters were calculated using fitting equations with the least square method, after analyzing the absorption spectrum of activated luminescence center ions. However, Judd–Ofelt theory was used mainly in the form of transparent glass, and was not suitable for powder samples because of adverse light scattering. As for the powder sample, the absorption spectrum was obtained by transforming the diffuse reflectance spectrum without consideration for light scattering. Gross errors in this transforming process will induce the inexact values of ΩJ (J = 2, 4, 6), because the magnitude order of ΩJ is 10−20 cm2.19,23 Thus, there have been few systematic theoretical studies focusing on the quantum cutting mechanism in powder samples. A new method is necessary to be explored to calculate Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters ΩJ (J = 2, 4, 6) of opaque powder samples.
In this work, we develop a method to calculate experimental Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters ΩJ (J = 2, 4, 6), radiative transition probability Aij of Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotube powder by analyzing the emission spectra of the resulting nanotubes. In conjunction with a dynamic balance rate-equation model, the population dynamics of excited states of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions is simulated for the case of excitation by the nanosecond pulse at 393 nm. To our knowledge, quantum cutting down-conversion has not been reported in Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes previously. The selection of the Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotube powder as the object of research is motivated by low phonon energy of the NaYbF4 host, the high solubility between Eu3+ ions and the NaYbF4 host, and high thermodynamical stabilization. Moreover, the NaYbF4 host offers sufficient Yb3+ ions with long excited level lifetime as energy-transfer acceptor ions to emit 970–1050 nm infrared light.24–26
II. Experimental procedure
2.1 Materials
Deionized water was used throughout. Analytical grade NaOH, NH4F, oleic acid, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, and 99.99% Ln2O3 (Ln = Yb and Eu) were used. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes
Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes were prepared by a hydrothermal method according to the molar composition of NaYb1−xEuxF4 (x = 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%). In a typical synthesis process, rare earth oxides Ln2O3 (Ln = Yb and Eu) were dissolved in hydrochloric acid (1 mol Ln2O3: 3.5 mol HCl) to prepare 0.2 mol L−1 LnCl3 solution. An aqueous solution of 3.0 mL 0.2 mol L−1 YbCl3 and EuCl3 was mixed with ethanol (15 mL), oleic acid (15 mL) and NaOH (0.6 g) under thorough stirring. Then, 2 mL of NH4F (0.3889 g) solution was added dropwise to the mixture. After vigorous stirring at room temperature for about 30 min, the colloidal solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated. The final products were collected, washed several times with ethanol, and purified by centrifugation.
2.3 Characterization
Structures of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using X’TRA (Switzerland ARL) equipment provided with Cu tube with Kα radiation at 1.54056 Å in the range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 70°. The size and shape of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (LEO-1530). The size and shape of the samples were observed using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100). The excitation and emission spectra and the fluorescence decay curves in both visible and NIR regions were recorded on a FLSP920 fluorescence spectrophotometer and using a Shimidazu R9287 photomultiplier (200–900 nm) along with a liquid nitrogen-cooled InGaAs (800–1700 nm) as the detectors. All measurements were performed at room temperature.
III. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure

Fig. 1 shows the images of crystal morphology and size of NaYbF4 samples at different Eu3+ doping concentrations (1–5 mol%) obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the presence of 1 mol% and 2 mol% Eu3+ dopant ions, the scanning electron microscope images in Fig. 1a and b show two distinct particle morphologies that include large nanotubes and small nanoparticles. With the increase of the Eu3+ doping concentration from 3 mol% to 5 mol%, SEM images show the formation of hexagonal nanotubes (Fig. 1c–e). A phase transition from cubic to hexagonal and size modification from large to small are achieved by increasing the Eu3+ doping concentration. With increasing Eu3+ dopant concentration, nanotubes with different lengths are formed. The length of the nanotubes firstly increases and gradually decreases in the range from 0.5 μm to 3.1 μm. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and electron diffraction patterns of the Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 samples are shown in Fig. 2. The electron diffraction patterns show that the polycrystal phase NaYbF4 is transferred into a single-crystalline phase NaYbF4 with the increasing Eu3+ doping concentration.

The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 3 show the phase conversion process of NaYbF4 crystals from a cubic to a hexagonal phase with the increasing Eu3+ doping concentration. Thus, simultaneous phase transition and size modification can be controlled by increasing the Eu3+ doping concentration. According to reported studies,27–29 shape and size modifications originated from the surface charge redistribution of the crystal nucleus induced by inner electron charge transfer between Eu3+ doping ions and Yb3+ lattice cation ions.

3.2 Spectrum analysis

Fig. 4 shows the excitation spectra of red and infrared luminescence of the NaYbF4: 3% Eu3+ sample. Fig. 4(a) is obtained while monitoring the 615 nm emission line, which corresponds to the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+. Groups of absorption lines observed in the excitation spectrum correspond to 7F0 → 5KJ, 7F0 → (5HJ + 5FJ + 5IJ), 7F0 → (5LJ + 5GJ + 5D4), and 7F0 → 5D3 transitions of Yb3+. Fig. 4(b) is obtained while monitoring the 977 nm emission line, which corresponds to the 2F5/2 → 7F7/2 transition of Eu3+. One can find that the spectral overlap between the excitation spectra of red luminescence at 615 nm and infrared at 977 nm is observed in the whole wavelength range. The most intense excitation peak at 393 nm is chosen as the excitation source to pump the Eu3+ ions.

Fig. 5 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes at various dopant concentrations under ultraviolet light excitation at 393 nm corresponding to the Eu3+: 7F0 → 5L6 transition. In the visible region of 450–700 nm, eight emission peaks centered at 465 nm, 488 nm, 510 nm, 555 nm, 591 nm, 615 nm, 650 nm, and 695 nm are observed, which are ascribed to 5D3 → 7F4, 5D2 → 7F2, 5D2 → 7F3, 5D1 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions of Eu3+, respectively. The 5D0 → 7F3 transition was reported to have originated from an enhanced electron–phonon interaction.30 In general, the 5D0 → 7F3 transition is forbidden from both electric (dipole or quadrupole) and magnetic (dipole) considerations. In the infrared region, the broad emission band in the range of 977–1015 nm, which is centered at 997 nm, is attributed to the Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition from the high Stark level of the 2F5/2 multiplet to the low Stark level of the 2F7/2 multiplet. With the increase of the Eu3+ concentration from 1 to 5 mol%, the intensity of 465 nm, 488 nm, 510 nm, 555 nm, 595 nm, 615 nm, 650 nm, 695 nm, and 997 nm emission peaks firstly increases and then decreases, a maximum existing at about 3 mol%. An obvious decrease of the intensity of emission bands is observed with the increase of the Eu3+ concentration more than 3 mol%, owing to the concentration quenching.31

Notably, the energy of the 5D2 level of Eu3+ (21355–21396 cm−1) is almost equal to the sum of energy of two excited states of Yb3+ (10335–10909 cm−1). The cooperative energy transfer 5D2 (Eu3+) → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) is possible to occur. In order to explore energy transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+, the Eu3+ concentration dependent decay behavior of 488 nm, 510 nm, and 997 nm emissions under 393 nm excitation is studied using decay curves in Fig. 6. These curves with a non-exponential nature reveal the existence of energy transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+. The corresponding decay lifetimes can be calculated using the second order exponential curve fitting equation: I = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2),(1)where I is the luminescence intensity, A1 and A2 are constants, t is the time, τ1 and τ2 are the short and long lifetimes for exponential components, respectively. The average decay lifetimes τ are determined by the formula τ = (A1τ12 + A1τ22)/(A1τ1 + A1τ2).(2)
As shown in Fig. 6, obviously, the decay lifetimes of the 488 nm and 510 nm emissions decrease with an increase of the Eu3+ doping concentration. The decay lifetimes of the 997 nm emission firstly increase and decrease with the increase of the Eu3+ doping concentration. These results suggest that the cooperative energy transfer occurs from the 5D2 state of Eu3+ to the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ under 393 nm excitation.

Based on the above analysis, the energy transfer mechanism of infrared quantum cutting from 5D2 (Eu3+) to 2F5/2 (Yb3+) under 393 nm excitation is given in Fig. 7. The energy of the Eu3+: 5D2 → 7F0 transition is two times equal to that of the Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition, so the excited Eu3+ ions can transfer energy to the Yb3+ ions through an energy migration process: 5D2 (Eu3+) → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+). The energy of the Eu3+ ion on a 5D2 level transfers to the ground state Yb3+ ion, provoking the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+, which is a dominant mechanism to achieve 977–1015 nm infrared emission.

3.3 Rate-equation model for near-infrared quantum cutting
To get some insight into the mechanism of infrared quantum cutting from Eu3+ to Yb3+, Judd–Ofelt theory will be applied for determination of spontaneous emission probability. In this section, we offer a method to calculate experimental Ω2, Ω4, and Ω6, radiative transition probability Aij of Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes by analyzing the emission spectrum of Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes. The experimental intensity parameters, such as Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6, are used to calculate the spontaneous emission probability Aij.
The luminescence intensity of an emission band can be expressed as Iij = EAijNi(3)where E is transition energy per photon from an i state to a j state, Aij is spontaneous radiative emission probability, and Ni is the state population of the i state.32

E is expressed as (4)where λ is the mean wavelength of transition, h the Planck's constant, and c the speed of light.
For Eu3+ ions, the 591 nm emission originated from a 5D0 → 7F1 magnetic-dipole transition.33 The 615 nm and 695 nm emissions originated from 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F4 electric-dipole transitions. The electric-dipole spontaneous emission probability Aedλ is expressed as (5)where e is the elementary charge, n the refractive index, and |Ut| the double-reduced matrix element of unit tensor operators, which are considered to be independent of the host and its value has been given by Carnall et al.34 The magnetic-dipole spontaneous emission probability Amdλ is expressed as (6)where Smd is the magnetic-dipole line strength. The Smd for Eu3+ ions is a constant and independent of the medium hosts.
The spontaneous radiative emission probability Aij for electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions is given by: Aij = Aedλ + Amdλ,(7)and the radiative lifetime of an excited state is calculated using τrad = 1/Aij.(8)
The measured experimental lifetimes (τexp), the radiative lifetimes (τrad) calculated using eqn (8), and the energy transfer probability WET can be related as follows:19,21 (9)
Notably, the electric-dipole transition 5D0 → 7F2 and magnetic-dipole transition 5D0 → 7F4 of Eu3+ ions originated from the same 5D0 state of Eu3+. Thus, combining eqn (3)–(6), the luminescence intensity of emission bands induced by the magnetic-dipole transition (λmd) and electric-dipole transition (λed) is expressed as (10) (11)where Ni is the state population of the 5D0 state of Eu3+. Combining the above equations, the luminescence intensity ratio of emission bands induced by the magnetic-dipole transition and the electric-dipole transition is expressed as (12)
The luminescence intensity of the emission band can be expressed as the integral transition intensity in the emission spectrum.35 Thus, the luminescence intensity ratio R is also expressed as (13)
Combining eqn (12) and (13), Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6 can be calculated using a least-squares fitting approach. The Eu3+ concentration dependent Ω2 and Ω4 parameters under 393 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 8. Ω6 is zero, because the 5D0 → 7F6 transition is not observed in the emission spectrum of Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes in Fig. 5. Generally, the intensity parameter Ω2 has been identified to be associated with the asymmetry around the rare earth ions sites and the covalence between the rare earth ions and the surrounding ligands, and Ω4 and Ω6 are related to the bulk properties and the rigidity of the host.36Ω2 changes with the increase of the Eu3+ concentration, which suggests that the asymmetrical environment around the Eu3+ sites is dependent on the Eu3+ concentration. Ω2 reaches a maximum value at 4 mol% Eu3+ concentration, which suggests that the weakest asymmetrical environment around the Eu3+ sites appears in 4 mol% Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes. The most intense 997 nm infrared emission in 4 mol% Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes, shown in Fig. 5, is induced by the weakest asymmetrical environment around the Eu3+ sites.

In order to study the mechanism of infrared quantum cutting, we study theoretically and experimentally the population dynamics of Eu3+ and Yb3+ states under the excitation of the 5L6 Eu state by the 393 nm ultraviolet monochromatic light. The calculated time dependence of excited state population dynamics is achieved by a simulation of dynamic balance rate equations for Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes. We assume here the simplest seven-level model in Fig. 7:
(1) The 5DJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3) excited states are populated by the nonradiative relaxation of the above 5L6 state. The cross relaxation energy transfer between 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 5DJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3) states is negligible.
(2) The adjacent 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) states are considered to be the ground state.
(3) The infrared quantum cutting process between 5D2 and 2F5/2 is equal to three cross relaxation energy transfer processes CR1, CR2, and CR3 to populate the 2F5/2 state two times, as the energy of the 5D2 state is two times equal to that of the 2F5/2 state.
(4) The energy back transfer from Yb3+ to Eu3+ is considered to be negligible.
All the processes considered in the system of dynamic balance rate equations are indicated in the energy levels scheme in Fig. 7. The population dynamic process of states of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions in the quantum cutting down-conversion process is simulated as follows: (14)where σ is the cross-section of the ground state absorption of Eu3+ ions, ρ is the incident pumping power density, ni is the population number of the ith level of Eu3+, Ni is the population density of the ith level of Yb3+, the terms of Wij represent the nonradiative decay rates between the levels i and j of Eu3+, Aij is the radiative transition rates between the levels i and j of Eu3+ calculated using the Judd–Ofelt parameters from our method, and δ is the probability of energy-transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+ involved in the quantum cutting process.
For 3 mol% Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes, the parameter values used in our calculation process are as follows: A10 = 5626.5 s−1, Aed = 46.5417 s−1, A20 = 48.7439 s−1, A30 = 31.098 s−1, A40 = 27.0304 s−1, A21 = 113000 s−1, ρ = 7.87 × 1018 mW cm−2, σ = 1.92 × 10−17 cm2, δ = 2287.21 s−1, W21 = 1775.84 s−1, W32 = 823.8 s−1, W43 = 2289.66 s−1, and W54 = 2150.54 s−1. The time dependent population numbers of the Eu3+ and Yb3+ excited states are calculated in Fig. 9(a). The population numbers of 5D0, 5D1, 5D2, 5D3, 5L6, and 2F5/2 excited states of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions firstly increase sharply and then decrease slowly with the increase in time. The maximum population numbers of 5D0, 5D1, 5D2, 5D3, 5L6 excited states are about 0.42%, 1.37%, 3.27%, 5.13%, and 5.76% of the total Eu3+ number (1.08 × 1019 ions). The maximum population number of the 2F5/2 excited state is about 0.082% of the total Yb3+ number (3.51 × 1020 ions). The normalized population curves in Fig. 9(b) show that different rise times are used to populate Eu3+ and Yb3+ excited states. The delay time to populate Eu3+ excited states gradually increases from 5L6 to 5D0 states, which reveals that the below state is populated by the non-radiative relaxation process of the above state. The rise time for the population of the 2F5/2 excited state of Yb3+ ions is longer than that for the population of the 5D2 state of Eu3+ ions reveals the existence of energy transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+ in the quantum cutting down-conversion process.

IV. Summary
Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes were synthesized successfully by a hydrothermal route. The phase transition from cubic to hexagonal and size modification are achieved by increasing the Eu3+ doping concentration. Quantum cutting down-conversion from Eu3+ to Yb3+ ions is observed under 393 nm ultraviolet excitation, in which the energy migration 5D2 (Eu3+) → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) is the main mechanism to emit near-infrared fluorescence. We proposed a method to calculate the Judd–Ofelt parameters and radiative transition probability of Eu3+ doped NaYbF4 nanotubes through analyzing the emission spectra of Eu3+ ions. The population numbers of excited states of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions are obtained by solving dynamic balance rate equations.
