    , Accepted 16th November 2017First published on 16th November 2017AbstractGreen synthesis of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSn(S1−xSex)4 (CZTSSe) nanocrystals is highly desirable for low-cost and high-efficiency solar energy conversion devices. In this work, scalable synthesis of multinary CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals at room temperature has been achieved by a simple metal complex solution mixing (Metcomix) process. In the Metcomix process, CZTS or CZTSSe nanocrystals are formed by simply mixing aqueous solutions of copper thiourea complex ([Cu(TU)4]2+), zinc ammonium complex ([Zn(NH3)4]2+) and tin chalcogen complex ([Sn2S6]4−) or tin double chalcogen complex ([Sn2S4Se2]4−) at room temperature. The Metcomix process features low-energy-consuming, low-cost, environmentally friendly, high-purity, and scalable-production. The CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals have a small size of 4–10 nm and exhibit remarkable room-temperature photoluminescence and optical absorption properties. The CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals are also deposited onto ZnO nanorod arrays and demonstrated as efficient photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The ZnO/CZTSSe photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 9.06 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. the NHE) and an optimal applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of ∼3.43% at a bias of 0.60 V. The present work demonstrates a new approach for synthesizing eco-friendly multinary chalcogenide nanocrystals at room temperature and their promising applications in solar energy conversion devices.
Introduction
Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) as a multinary I2–II–IV–VI4 compound is a promising light-harvesting material for solar energy conversion applications due to its merits of suitable bandgap (∼1.5 eV), high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1), earth-abundance of the constituting elements, low toxicity, good photostability, and tunable absorption via Se incorporation to form Cu2ZnSn(S1−xSex)4 (CZTSSe).1–10 Synthesis of CZTS or CZTSSe colloidal nanocrystals via solution processing has attracted much recent attention.8–22 The CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals are usually synthesized by colloidal solution methods, including both hot-injection and non-injection strategies.8–22 Such synthesis typically requires a high-temperature (usually >200 °C) heating process and is still energy-consuming. It also involves long-chain organic solvents such as oleylamine, oleic acid, trimethylamine, trioctylphosphine oxide, octadecene, and dodecanethiol, which are expensive and hazardous to the environment. Moreover, the attached organic ligands on the surface of the CZTSSe nanocrystals can form insulating barriers, suppress charge separation, and consequently deteriorate their solar energy conversion performance. Therefore, exploration of new chemistry for preparing CZTSSe nanocrystals featuring room temperature reaction, green aqueous solution, no toxicity and large-scale synthesis is highly desirable. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on synthesis of CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals at room temperature.
There are two critical challenges for synthesizing CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals at room temperature. On one hand, there are large differences in solubility product constants (Ksp) of the component binary sulfides: CuS (6.3 × 10−36), ZnS (2.5 × 10−22), and SnS2 (1.0 × 10−25). This suggests that it is much easier to form CuS because of its small Ksp instead of the quaternary alloyed CZTS. Once binary copper sulfide is formed, high temperature or pressure is required for its conversion to alloyed CZTS.23–25 On the other hand, there is a lack of suitable aqueous precursor solutions containing both S and Se anions that are chemically bonded together as a group for preparing pentabasic alloyed CZTSSe nanocrystals. As a result, mixtures of CZTS and CZTSe can be easily formed instead of CZTSSe.
To address these challenges, we report for the first time a simple metal complex mixing (Metcomix) process for preparing high purity CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals in aqueous solution at room temperature. In the Metcomix process, formation of binary sulfides is suppressed by employing the reaction between metal complexes instead of direct reactions between Cu2+, Zn2+, Sn4+, S2− and Se2− ions. Furthermore, formation of high purity CZTSSe is enabled by developing an aqueous [Sn2S4Se2]4− precursor solution in which complex ions containing simultaneously S and Se are achieved. The CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals exhibit a kesterite phase with an average size of 4–10 nm. They show outstanding room-temperature PL properties and photoresponse properties. Importantly, CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystal sensitized ZnO nanorod arrays are prepared and demonstrated as efficient photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting.
Experimental
Preparation of the complex solutions
Copper thiourea complex ([Cu(TU)4]2+) solution was prepared by dissolving a Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution (3.0 mL, 3.3 M) in a thiourea (TU) aqueous solution (105 mL, 1.0 M) under continuous magnetic stirring. Zinc ammonium complex ([Zn(NH3)4]2+) solution was prepared by dissolving a Zn(NO3)2 aqueous solution (1.5 mL, 3.3 M) in an ammonium solution (6 mL, 25–28%) under continuous magnetic stirring. Tin chalcogen complex ([Sn2S6]4−) solution was made by dissolving the S powder (10 mmol) and Sn powder (5 mmol) in a (NH4)2S aqueous solution (9 mL, 20%) under continuous magnetic stirring. Tin double chalcogen complex ([Sn2S4Se2]4−) solution was prepared by dissolving the Se powder (9 mmol) and Sn powder (5 mmol) in a (NH4)2S aqueous solution (9.0 mL, 20%) under continuous magnetic stirring.
Synthesis of CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals
For the synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals, the [Zn(NH3)4]2+ and the [Sn2S6]4− complex solutions were added into the [Cu(TU)4]2+ complex solution under vigorous magnetic stirring. The mixed solution was kept for 2 h at room temperature. The synthesis of CZTSSe nanocrystals was performed by the same procedure except that the [Sn2S6]4− complex solution was replaced with the [Sn2S4Se2]4− complex solution. Black precipitation products were collected and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times. The product yield in one pot is larger than 2 g.
Preparation of ZnO/CZTSSe and ZnO/CZTS photoanodes
Arrays of ZnO nanorods on FTO glass substrates were synthesized by a hydrothermal method as described in our previous reports.26,27 The CZTSSe (or CZTS) nanocrystals were deposited onto the surface of the ZnO nanorods by spin-coating the nanocrystal inks. Finally, the ZnO/CZTSSe and ZnO/CZTS photoanodes were annealed at 400 °C for 30 min.
Characterization
The electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) spectrum of the [Sn2S4Se2]4− complex solution was measured on a liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ACQUITY UPLC LCT Premier XE). Crystallographic structures of the CZTS and the CZTSSe samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2500v diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation). Morphologies, sizes, crystal structures, and compositions were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM 200 FEG, 200 kV, or JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 kV), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL30 FEG). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi XPS spectrometer system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Raman spectra were measured with a Lab RAM HR Evolution system with a 532 nm excitation source. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. PL spectra were carried out with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation of 550 nm.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting measurement
A standard three-electrode configuration in a quartz cell was assembled to carry out photoelectrochemical measurement using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). A Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The arrays of ZnO/CZTSSe, ZnO/CZTS, and bare ZnO on FTO glass substrates with an active area of 0.2 cm2 were used as the working electrodes for electrochemical water splitting. A Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M) with a pH = 6.78 was used as the electrolyte, which was bubbled with N2 for 30 min prior to measurements. The simulated sunlight (CEAULIGHT, CEL-S500) under AM 1.5G illumination at a power density of 100 mW cm−2 was employed as the light source.
Results and discussion
[Cu(TU)4]2+, [Zn(NH3)4]2+, tin chalcogen ([Sn2S6]4−),28,29 and tin double chalcogen ([Sn2S4Se2]4−) complex solutions (Fig. 1a) were prepared for synthesizing CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals. Upon mixing, spontaneous reactions of the negatively charged complex ([Sn2S4Se2]4− or [Sn2S6]4−) with the positively charged complexes ([Cu(TU)4]2+ and [Zn(NH3)4]2+) lead to the formation of high purity CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals at room temperature. The formation of the tin double chalcogen ([Sn2S4Se2]4−) complex is carefully examined, which works as a key group for synthesizing CZTSSe nanocrystals at room temperature. Fig. 1b shows an electrospray ionization-mass spectrum (ESI-MS) of the aqueous solution prepared by dissolving Se and Sn powders in a (NH4)2S solution. The strongest peak for protonated [Sn2S4Se2]·5H+ at m/z = 528 is clearly observed, indicating the formation of the [Sn2S4Se2]4− complex in the solution.

Fig. 2a shows an XRD pattern (curve i) of the CZTS nanocrystals by mixing the three complex solutions of [Cu(TU)4]2+, [Zn(NH3)4]2+, and [Sn2S6]4−. The three diffraction peaks of the freshly prepared CZTS nanocrystals can be well indexed to the (112), (220) and (312) planes of a kesterite structure (JCPDF no. 01-075-4122). The CZTS samples exhibit improved crystallinity upon annealing the freshly prepared sample in nitrogen flow (curves ii–iv). As ZnS and Cu2SnS3 have a similar XRD pattern to CZTS,18 the samples are further characterized by Raman analysis as shown in Fig. 2b. Curve i is the Raman spectrum of the freshly prepared CZTS nanocrystals, showing a characteristic peak at 332 cm−1. It matches well with the reported values (331–338 cm−1) of the characteristic peak of kesterite CZTS.30,31 There are no additional peaks observed from impurities of binary or ternary sulfides, such as Cu2−xS (470 cm−1), ZnS (351 and 374 cm−1), SnS2 (315 cm−1) and Cu2SnS3 (314 cm−1).30–32 For the two CZTS samples annealed at 200 and 300 °C (curves ii and iii), they both show a characteristic peak at 332 cm−1. For the CZTS sample annealed at 400 °C as shown in curve iv, the peak shifts slightly from 332 cm−1 to 337 cm−1. An additional peak at 287 cm−1 is obviously observed, which is consistent with the previous report of an annealed CZTS film.7 The observation is probably attributed to the improved crystallinity and enlarged grain size. Both the XRD and Raman results demonstrate the formation of the pure kesterite phase of CZTS. The size of the CZTS nanocrystals is estimated to be 4–10 nm from the TEM image in Fig. 2c. The size distribution map is shown in Fig. S1, ESI.†Fig. 2d shows an HRTEM image of the CZTS nanocrystals. The lattice spacings of 0.192 and 0.224 nm match well with the (220) and (114) interplanar spacings of kesterite CZTS. An energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of the freshly prepared CZTS nanocrystals is presented in Fig. S2a, ESI.† The atomic ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn:S is estimated to be 22:14:14:50, indicating the formation of a copper-deficient CZTS.

CZTSSe nanocrystals were prepared by mixing the [Cu(TU)4]2+, the [Zn(NH3)4]2+ and the [Sn2S4Se2]4− complex solutions at room temperature. The product consists of both CZTSSe nanocrystals and elemental Se microrods as a by-product which can be easily removed by treating the sample in a NaBH4 solution (Se + NaBH4 + 3H2O → NaHSe + H3BO3 + 3H2) (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XRD pattern of the CZTSSe nanocrystals after purification in a NaBH4 solution (curve ii in Fig. S3a, ESI†) is similar to that of the CZTS nanocrystals (curve i in Fig. 2a), except for a slight shift of diffraction peaks to lower 2θ degree as shown in Fig. 3a. This shift is attributed to the replacement of S atoms by larger-sized Se atoms in the CZTS lattice.7,11 The Raman spectrum of the CZTSSe nanocrystals in Fig. 3b shows two resonance peaks at 224 (CZTSe-like) and 326 cm−1 (CZTS-like). The two values deviate from that of the bare CZTSe (191 cm−1) and that of the bare CZTS (332 cm−1), respectively, which are attributed to the slight substitution of S by Se atoms in CZTS. This observation is in good accordance with previous work,7,10,33 and further confirms the formation of alloyed pentabasic CZTSSe. No impurity peaks from binary selenides and sulfides, such as Cu2−xSe (260 cm−1) or Cu2−xS (470 cm−1), are detectable. The difference in the two band intensity also suggests that the Se content is much smaller than the S content. An EDX spectrum (Fig. S2b, ESI†) reveals that the Se content (x) in the CZTSSe nanocrystals is 0.12. A TEM image in Fig. 3c and an HRTEM image in Fig. 3d reveal that the crystalline CZTSSe nanocrystals have an average size of 4–10 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). Without long-chain ligand capping, these small nanocrystals have large surface energy and trend to agglomerate, leading to lower monodispersity. As shown in Fig. 3e, the lattice fringes of 0.320 nm and 0.318 nm match well with the interplanar spacings of the {112} planes of the kesterite crystal structure.

Chemical states of the five constituent elements in the CZTSSe nanocrystals after post-treatment in NaBH4 solution were further examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4a depicts a Cu 2p core level XPS spectrum, exhibiting two peaks at 951.95 eV for Cu 2p1/2 and 932.15 eV for Cu 2p3/2 with a peak separation of 19.80 eV corresponding to Cu+ cations.22,24 A Zn 2p core level spectrum in Fig. 4b shows doublet peaks at 1044.75 eV for Zn 2p1/2 and 1021.70 eV for Zn 2p3/2, indicating the existence of Zn2+ cations.22,24Fig. 4c presents a Sn 3d core level spectrum, showing doublet peaks at 494.95 eV for Sn 3d3/2 and 486.45 eV for Sn 3d5/2 corresponding to Sn4+ cations, as well as a shoulder located at 496.60 eV resulted from Zn LMM.22–24Fig. 4d displays a S 2p core level spectrum possessing doublet peaks at 162.80 eV for S 2p1/2 and 161.60 eV for S 2p3/2, which are in good agreement with the reported values of S2− in CZTS.22–24 A Se 3d core level spectrum of the CZTSSe nanocrystals is shown in Fig. 4e. It can be fitted to two couples of doublet peaks: a couple of doublet peaks at a lower energy of 55.10 eV for Se 3d3/2 and 54.00 eV for Se 3d5/2 corresponding to Se2− anions,23 and another couple of doublet peaks at higher energy of 55.85 eV for Se 3d3/2 and 54.90 eV for Se 3d5/2 corresponding to elemental Se.34 The signals of elemental Se are attributed to oxidation of Se2− anions in CZTSSe exposed in air or the possibly unremoved by-product of Se.

The reactions to synthesize CZTS and CZTSSe might take place as follows:
(1) Synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals,4[Cu(TU)4]2+ + 2[Zn(NH3)4]2+ + [Sn2S6]4− + 4S2− + 8H2O → 2Cu2ZnSnS4 + 16TU + 8NH3·H2O + 2S
(2) Synthesis of CZTSSe nanocrystals,4[Cu(TU)4]2+ + 2[Zn(NH3)4]2+ + [Sn2S4Se2]4− + 4S2− + 8H2O → 2Cu2ZnSn(S1−xSex)4 + 16TU + 8NH3·H2O + 8xS + (2 − 8x) Se
In the above two equations, redox reactions occur. Reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ is accompanied by oxidation of S2− and/or Se2− to form the by-product of elemental S and/or Se. The by-product of S can be further dissolved in the mixed solution containing excess (NH4)2S to form soluble poly-sulfide ions (Sn2−). For the formation of CZTSSe nanocrystals, the by-product of Se is formed and well demonstrated by the XRD and SEM results as shown in Fig. S3, ESI.†
The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the freshly prepared CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals were investigated respectively by UV-vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 5a shows UV-vis spectra of the two nanocrystals, revealing that the absorption edge red shifts slightly after incorporation of Se into CZTS to form CZTSSe. Recently, it has been reported that wurtzite CZTSSe nanocrystals have PL properties at low temperature of 20 K.10 Room-temperature PL properties are seldom reported.5,35,36 In our work, both the CZTS and the CZTSSe nanocrystals show remarkable PL at room temperature. The CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals exhibit prominent emission peaks at respectively 832 and 838 nm (Fig. 5b). The bandgap is estimated to be 1.49 eV for the CZTS nanocrystals and 1.48 eV for the CZTSSe nanocrystal. While it is difficult to tune the bandgap by a quantum confinement effect owing to the small Bohr radius (2.2–4.3 nm) of CZTS,37 the ability to control the composition allows for versatile tuning of optical properties. Therefore, the as-synthesized nanocrystals, containing no toxic metal, can serve as promising candidates for replacing the widely studied cadmium or lead chalcogenide quantum dots in biological tagging, quantum-dot solar cells, photoelectrochemical water splitting, or as components for optoelectronic devices.

Optoelectronic behavior of the CZTSSe and CZTS nanocrystals deposited on a glass substrate by spray coating followed by annealing at 400 °C is studied. Fig. 5c shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves of a CZTSSe nanocrystal film measured in the dark and under AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The CZTSSe film shows outstanding photoresponse, and a significant increase in current is observed while the film is exposed from in the dark to under illumination. Fig. 5d shows a time-resolved response at a bias of 1.0 V as light illumination is turned on and off alternately. It is found that the current varies from 1.4 nA in the dark to 5.6 nA under illumination, showing superior reversibility and stability. The CZTS nanocrystal film presents similar photoresponse properties as shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† Therefore, the nanocrystals prepared by such a room-temperature synthetic strategy are considered as promising light-harvesting materials in solar energy conversion devices.
To demonstrate potential applications of the CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the as-prepared nanocrystals are coated onto ZnO nanorod arrays to construct photoanodes of PEC cells (Fig. S5, ESI†). As depicted in Fig. 6a, upon illumination, electron–hole pairs are generated at the photoanode. When the holes move to the interface of photoanode/electrolyte and oxidize OH− ions to produce O2, the photoelectrons transport through an external circuit to the Pt counter electrode and reduce H+ ions to generate H2.38–41 The cross-sectional SEM images of the bare ZnO nanorods and the ZnO/CZTSSe photoanodes are presented in Fig. 6b. The arrays of the nanorods have a length of 5–6 μm. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the different photoanodes under illumination are presented in Fig. 6c. The photoanode of the bare ZnO nanorod array delivers a photocurrent density of 0.48 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the NHE. After coating the CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals, the photoanodes show significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical performance. Photocurrent density is increased to 6.38 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the NHE for the ZnO/CZTS photoanode and further to 9.06 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the NHE for the ZnO/CZTSSe photoanode. The increase in photocurrent density is attributed to the expanded light harvesting ability of the photoanodes after being sensitized with CZTSSe nanocrystals. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPEs) of the photoanodes can be calculated using the equation: , where V is the applied bias vs. the NHE, J is the photocurrent density at the measured bias, and Pin is the power density of illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).42 The ABPE of the three photoanodes is shown in Fig. 6d. The pristine ZnO photoanode exhibits an optimal ABPE of only 0.16%. Sensitization with CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals substantially enhances the ABPE by improving the photocurrent. Significantly, the highest efficiency of ∼2.80% at a low bias of 0.48 V vs. the NHE is obtained for the ZnO/CZTS photoanode and the optimal ABPE of ∼3.43% at a bias of 0.60 V vs. the NHE is achieved for the ZnO/CZTSSe. Furthermore, the photoresponse of the photoanodes is investigated by measuring the LSV under chopped light illumination (Fig. 6e). It is observed that both ZnO/CZTS and ZnO/CZTSSe exhibit a rapid and reproducible photocurrent response with respect to the on/off cycles. When light illumination is turned off, the current density of the PEC device is negligible, indicating the formation of a space charge region in the photoanodes. When the light is turned on, high current densities are measured, owing to the collection of photogenerated carriers. The vertical rising and falling photocurrent densities of the transient photoresponse indicate fast charge transport in these PEC devices.

The significant improvement in PEC performance is attributed to expanded light-harvesting capability and fast charge separation and transport by the nanoarray structure. Theoretically, photocurrent density (Jph) is determined by the relationship Jph = Jabs × ηsep × ηinj, where Jabs is the photocurrent density at 100% internal quantum efficiency; ηsep is the photogenerated electron−hole separation efficiency for producing surface-reaching holes; and ηinj is the efficiency of surface-reaching holes participating in desired electrochemical reactions.43,44 In our case, the ZnO/CZTSSe photoanode shows expanded light absorption and enhanced light harvesting efficiency (LHE) in the visible light region as shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† The ZnO/CZTSSe photoanode forms a stepwise energy band alignment at the heterointerface as depicted in Fig. 6a. Photogenerated electron–hole pairs would be preferably transferred across the interface in opposite directions, which promotes photo-generated charge carrier separation and reduces electron–hole recombination.45 These aspects would contribute to the increase in photocurrent density of the ZnO/CZTSSe photoanode. Fig. S7 in the ESI† presents the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the ZnO photoanodes before and after CTZSSe coating. It further reveals the expanded and increased IPCE of the ZnO/CZTSSe in the visible light region. Fig. 6f shows the time-resolved response curves of the three photoanodes at a bias of 1.23 V vs. the NHE as light illumination is turned on and off alternately. It reveals that all the PEC devices exhibit superior reversibility. The stability of the ZnO/CZTSSe electrode under simulated sunlight illumination is shown in Fig. S8, ESI.† It reveals that the photocurrent density of the ZnO/CZTSSe photoelectrode remains about 65% of its original value after 1 h. The decrease in photocurrent is attributed to stability inadequacy of the photoanode, where CZTSSe was found to be slightly oxidized during the illumination process (Fig. S9, ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystal inks have been successfully synthesized at room temperature for the first time, featuring zero energy-consumption, simple synthesis, large-scale production, and low-cost and environmentally friendly water solvent. While a [Sn2S6]4− complex is used for growing CZTS nanocrystals, a novel [Sn2S4Se2]4− complex is designed for synthesizing CZTSSe nanocrystals. Utilization of the complexes balances the reaction rates between metal cations and chalcogen anions in aqueous solution, and consequently overcomes the big challenges of easy formation of binary impurities. The as-prepared CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals possess a kesterite structure with sizes of 4–10 nm. They show remarkable room-temperature PL properties, and yield a shift of an emission peak from 832 nm for CZTS to 838 nm for CZTSSe owing to the Se incorporation. The CZTS and CZTSSe nanocrystals have been further employed as promising light-harvesting materials for PEC water splitting. The ZnO/CZTS and ZnO/CZTSSe photoanodes exhibit optimal ABPEs of 2.80% and 3.43%, respectively. This synthetic strategy in current work could be extended to prepare other multinary chalcogenide nanocrystals at room temperature, which opens up a new door for synthesizing colloidal nanocrystals and fabricating low-cost and high-efficiency solar energy conversion devices.
