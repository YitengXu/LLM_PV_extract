    , Accepted 4th December 2019First published on 5th December 2019AbstractAg nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully deposited onto TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) via a photochemical method and ZnS layer was further fabricated on the surface of the TiO2/Ag NTs at room temperature. The morphology, composition and structure of the as-prepared samples were analyzed. A self-powered UV photodetector (UVPD) based on the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs has been constructed. When exposed to UV light, the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs UVPD manifests a higher photocurrent density than that of the TiO2 and TiO2/Ag NTs UVPDs at a bias of zero V. The TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs UVPD also reveals a splendid linear optical signal response. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs UVPD has excellent stability and repeatability, and the rise time and decay time are 0.16 s and 0.18 s, respectively. Moreover, a possible UV detection mechanism of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs UVPD is proposed.
Introduction
As one of the novel photovoltaic ultraviolet photodetectors (UVPDs), self-powered UVPDs have captured a great deal of attention in environmental monitoring, flame detection, chemical analysis and missile plume detection.1–4 Apart from exhibiting high photosensitivity and a fast photoresponse,5,6 self-powered UVPDs can also work without a driving bias voltage, which means that self-powered UVPDs can work free of an external power source.7 In the last decade, various wide-bandgap semiconductors, such as ZnO, SnO2 and TiO2, have been widely investigated in self-powered UVPDs.8,9 In particular, TiO2 has been extensively investigated for preparing self-powered UVPDs due to its key advantages: a band gap (3.2 eV),10 good chemical stability,11 high carrier mobility,12 radiation stability and high photoelectric conversion efficiency.13 Song14et al. fabricated a self-powered UVPD based on nanoflowers with a fast time response. Zu15et al. and Zhou16et al. assembled self-powered UVPDs based on TiO2, exhibiting a photocurrent of 0.42 and 0.8 μA respectively. However, because of the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, the low quantum efficiency limits the performance of self-powered UVPDs based on TiO2.9
In order to improve the detection performance, people have conducted a lot of research. The deposition of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) on TiO2 as an attractive and effective approach has been intensively studied because Schottky barriers are established between the noble metal NPs and TiO2,17 leading to efficient photogenerated electron–hole separation and promotion of carrier transfer at the metal/semiconductor interface.18 Compared with other noble metals (Au and Pt), Ag has attracted intensive interest due to its low cost and easy preparation. At present, several types of nanocomposites, such as Ag/TiO2 nanotubes (NTs), Ag/TiO2 nanorods (NRs) and Ag/TiO2 NPs have been reported, showing a higher quantum efficiency compared with pure TiO2. In addition, as another efficient way to suppress charge recombination, compounding semiconductors with different band gaps has attracted great attention because this approach can increase the number of photogenerated carriers. Owing to its nontoxicity, stability and wide band gap (3.72 eV),19 ZnS is an optimal candidate for semiconductor compounding with TiO2. What's more, after combining with TiO2, it can form a typical type-II heterojunction to restrict interfacial charge recombination due to its higher conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) than TiO2. Up to now, TiO2/ZnS has been widely used in the fields of photocatalysis,20 hydrogen production21 and solar cells,22 exhibiting greater efficiency than a single structure. Once the noble metal modification and semiconductor heterojunction are combined, it is possible to get a high-performance UVPD. Meanwhile, a ZnS film layer can also prevent Ag NPs from shedding. However, to the best of our knowledge, reports about TiO2/Ag/ZnS in self-powered UVPDs are quite scarce so far.
In this paper, TiO2 NTs with high specific surface area and transparency modified with Ag NPs were prepared via liquid phase deposition followed by a photochemical method. Then, a ZnS layer was synthesized on the TiO2/Ag NTs by successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The microstructure, chemical composition and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by various characterization methods, and a self-powered UVPD based on TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs was fabricated for the first time. The photosensitivity and photocurrent density (J) of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD were investigated, and the UV detection mechanism had also been discussed.
Experimental
Preparation of TiO2 NTs
TiO2 NTs were synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate according to a ZnO NRs template. In a typical experiment, the ZnO seed layers were fabricated by radio frequency magnetron sputtering and then ZnO NRs were prepared on the FTO substrate via the hydrothermal method.23 Subsequently, the FTO substrate with ZnO NRs was soaked in a mixture solution including 0.05 M ammonium hexafluorotitanate ((NH4)2TiF6) and 0.15 M boric acid (H3BO3) at room temperature for 2 h. Then, any residual ZnO was eliminated by immersing in a 0.5 M boric acid solution for 1 h. Finally, the sample was annealed in air for 2 h at 450 °C.
Synthesis of TiO2/Ag NTs
Ag NPs were deposited on the surface of the TiO2 NTs by a photochemical method. Briefly, the FTO substrate with TiO2 NTs was placed in a AgNO3 solution (0.02 M) and illuminated with a UV lamp at room temperature. The illumination duration was 2 min. Ultimately, the obtained sample was washed with distilled water and dried in air.
Fabrication of TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs
A ZnS layer was coated on the TiO2/Ag NTs via the SILAR technique. For the deposition of ZnS, the TiO2/Ag NTs were immersed in equimolar concentrations (0.1 M) of zinc acetate and sodium sulfide respectively for 1 min. Following each immersion, the TiO2/Ag NTs were rinsed for 2 min with distilled water and ethanol respectively, to remove the unabsorbed residual unreacted reagents. All these processes are termed as one SILAR cycle. The coat cycle of deposition of the ZnS layer was repeated five times.
Assembly of self-powered UVPDs
The schematic diagram of the self-powered UVPD based on the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs is illustrated in Fig. 1. The obtained TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs and the platinized FTO electrode were sandwiched and sealed with a 30 μm thick surlyn gasket. Then a polysulfide electrolyte solution drop penetrated into the internal space through capillary action. The polysulfide electrolyte solution consists of S (2 M), Na2S (2 M) and KCl (0.2 M) in a mixture of deionized water and methanol (volume ratio: 3/7).

Characterization
The samples’ morphology was analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU70) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) for elemental analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) were also carried out on a transmission electron microscope (FEI, Tecnai G2 F20). Additionally, EDS mapping under scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode was also employed to investigate the elemental distribution. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) analysis with Cu Kα X-ray radiation was used to characterize the crystal structure of the samples. The chemical binding status of the constituent elements of the samples was investigated using a PHI-5700 multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) using Al Kα as the exciting source. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples at room temperature were measured with a Raman spectrometer (Jobin Yvon HR 800). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photoresponse switching behavior analysis were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302N).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a displays a typical SEM micrograph of the TiO2 NTs synthesised by liquid phase deposition. It can be clearly observed that large scale and high density TiO2 NTs were uniformly grown on the surface of the substrate. From the magnified view (inset of Fig. 2a), tubular structures can be clearly observed from some broken tubes (red circles). Meanwhile, the TiO2 NTs reveal a slight curve and are discovered with outer and inner diameters of about 160 nm and 100 nm, respectively. After irradiation with a UV lamp, the color of the sample transforms from grayish white to tawny. The SEM image of the TiO2/Ag NTs has no obvious change, as shown in Fig. 2b. Namely, compared to the bare TiO2 NTs, the Ag NPs cannot obviously influence the morphology of the TiO2 NTs. In the high magnification image of Fig. 2b, Ag NPs with an average diameter of 10 nm were spread evenly over the surface of the TiO2 NTs. Moreover, there was no significant change in the nanotube diameter. Indeed, Fig. 2c indicates that the tubular structure has not changed and the overall morphology of the initial TiO2/Ag NTs was maintained after the addition of ZnS layer. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2c, the high magnification image shows that the surface becomes rough and is decorated with a very thin ZnS layer. Meanwhile, with the ZnS layer deposition, the average diameter of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs is slightly increased compared with that of the TiO2 NTs.

In addition, strong Ti, O, Zn, S and Ag signals are observed in the EDS pattern of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs (Fig. 2d), which demonstrates the formation of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT composite structure. The appearance of Sn and Si peaks come from the FTO substrate.
To exactly reveal the microscopic structure of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs, the sample is observed by TEM and the corresponding image is shown in Fig. 3a. The obvious difference in the color contrast of the light inner center and relatively dark edge confirms the tubular structure. Moreover, it is found that Ag NPs coated by ZnS which was deposited on the outer surface of the NTs. Fig. 3b is a HRTEM image of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs, which shows the characteristic lattice fringe of 0.312 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of cubic ZnS.24 In addition, the other two lattice fringes of 0.204 nm and 0.352 nm correspond to the (200) plane of Ag and (101) plane of anatase TiO2,25–27 respectively. The HRTEM image indicates that in addition to contact with TiO2, the Ag is also wrapped by a layer of ZnS.

The morphology of a TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT is further investigated by HAADF-STEM, as illustrated in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The edge of the broken TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT is convex and the middle area is recessed, and some rough protrusions (Ag NPs) can be clearly observed. In order to observe the elemental composition and distribution of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT, elemental mapping of the same area is also performed. The element mapping images show that Ti (Fig. S1b, ESI†), O (Fig. S1c, ESI†), Zn (Fig. S1e, ESI†) and S (Fig. S1f, ESI†) are homogeneously distributed throughout the nanotube. It is noteworthy that the intensity of Zn and S is relatively weaker than Ti and O. Furthermore, the spatial distribution ranges of Zn and S are larger than those of Ti and O, suggesting the encapsulation of the TiO2 NT by a thin ZnS layer. As expected, the Ag NPs can be seen as bright dots (dark red in the image) rather than a uniform distribution, as shown in Fig. S1d. These results clearly prove the formation of a hollow, tube-like structure of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS composite.
XRD was carried out to investigate the crystalline structure of the TiO2, TiO2/Ag and TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs. Fig. 4a clearly demonstrates the peaks from the FTO substrate, which also appear in the other samples. Fig. 4b reveals that the characteristic XRD pattern of the TiO2 NTs well indexed to the diffraction pattern of TiO2 manifests an anatase structure (JCPDS 21-1272).28 After depositing the Ag NPs (Fig. 4c), a new diffraction peak corresponding to (200) of Ag appears at 2θ = 44.2°,25 certifying the presence of metal Ag. The XRD pattern of TiO2/Ag/ZnS is presented in Fig. 4d. Besides the peaks of TiO2 and Ag, a weak peak appears which is ascribed to (111) of face-centered-cubic ZnS (JCPDS 65-0309).24 The puny peak can be attributed to the fact that the ZnS film is fairly thin. These results confirm that the composite consists of TiO2, Ag and ZnS, which is consistent with the SEM and TEM result.

XPS was performed to analyze the chemical compositions and the valence states of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs. The XPS full spectrum of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs indicates the presence of Ti, O, Ag, S, and Zn elements, as shown in Fig. 5a. In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p (Fig. 5b), the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks correspond to Ti(IV) and their binding energies are 458.6 eV and 464.4 eV,29 respectively. The spectrum for O 1s in Fig. 5c has a peak at 530.2 eV that was attributed to the oxygen species in TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5d, Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks appear at 368.1 eV and 374.1 eV showing that Ag NPs have been successfully introduced on the surface of the TiO2 NTs.30 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p is exhibited in Fig. 5e. It can be seen that the S 2p signal of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs has been obtained at 161.8 eV, which is related to Zn–S bonding.31 Meanwhile, Fig. 5f reveals the spectrum of Zn 2p; peaks at 1025.1 eV and 1048.5 eV are obviously observed, which can be assigned to the signal of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn2+, respectively.32

The detection performance of the UVPDs was measured at a fixed bias of zero V with repeated on/off cycles by controlling the switching interval between dark and UV light illumination (365 nm, 40 mW cm−2). On UV light illumination, the photocurrent density of the TiO2 NT UVPD rises apace to a stable value of 51 μA cm−2. After turning off the UV light, the photocurrent density rapidly decreases and returns to the initial state. The TiO2 NT UVPD can be readily switched between the “on” and “off” states for 8 cycles as shown in Fig. 6a, indicating the J signal response to be consistent and repeatable. It is noteworthy that the J signal of the TiO2/Ag and TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPDs sharply increases, reaching 211 μA cm−2 and 497 μA cm−2, respectively. After repeating cycles, the TiO2/Ag and TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPDs also have very good stability. These results demonstrate that the deposition of Ag and the coating of ZnS on the TiO2 NTs is beneficial for enhancing the performance of the TiO2 NT UVPD. In addition, for the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPDs, the on/off ratio of the J signal is 9837, which is significantly higher than that of 1120 and 4951 of the TiO2 and TiO2/Ag NT UVPDs.

In general, the response speed is an important feature for UVPDs. Usually, τr and τd are defined as the time to increase from 0 to 1 − 1/e of the maximum photocurrent and recover to 1/e of the maximum photocurrent, respectively.5 Enlarged rising and decaying edges of the photocurrent response are displayed in Fig. 6b, in which τr and τd of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD are approximately 0.16 and 0.18 s. By contrast, τr of TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD is faster than that (0.28 and 0.23 s) of TiO2 and TiO2/Ag NT UVPDs. Meanwhile, it is rather remarkable that τd of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD also shows a faster response compared with the TiO2 and TiO2/Ag NT UVPDs (0.21 and 0.20 s).
The photocurrent density of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD was also measured at a zero V bias voltage under different UV light intensities, as shown in Fig. 6c. It could be obviously found that the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD has good UV detection performance and good stability for different UV light intensities. Furthermore, the photocurrent density as a function of light intensity is displayed in Fig. 6d. Clearly, a nearly linear increasing photocurrent density is observed in relation to increasing incident light intensity varying from 5 to 40 mW cm−2. This linear variation of the photodetector indicates that the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD may be employed for accurate UV light measurement.
The room-temperature PL spectra of TiO2, TiO2/Ag and TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs under a 325 nm excitation wavelength are shown in Fig. 7a. All samples exhibit similar PL spectra, a UV emission band and a broad visible emission band. The UV emission band can be ascribed to the near band edge exciton recombination of TiO2.33 Furthermore, in the visible region, the broad emission band from 450 nm to 600 nm may be mainly related to defects, which results from oxygen vacancies and impurities in the TiO2.34 Meanwhile, it can be found that the emission intensity gradually decreases with the addition of Ag and ZnS. The PL spectra suggest that the transfer of the interface charge between TiO2, Ag and ZnS can benefit the separation and minimize the recombination probability of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.

To investigate the increased performance of the UVPDs, EIS has been applied to undertake a deep investigation on the electron transport at the interfaces, as shown in Fig. 7b. In general, the semicircle in the mid frequency region denotes the impedance related to the charge recombination process at the NT/electrolyte interface.35 At 0.2 V bias, the semicircle radius of TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD is much greater than that of TiO2 and TiO2/Ag NT UVPDs, suggesting that TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT structure is a powerful strategy to suppress the interfacial electron recombination at the NT/electrolyte interface.
Based on the above results, a possible mechanism of the UV detection of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD is illustrated in Fig. 8. When the photodetector is illuminated with UV light from the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT side, TiO2 and ZnS absorb UV light whose photon energy is larger than their band gap, and are excited to give photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Because the VB and the CB of ZnS are both higher than that of TiO2, a type-II heterojunction is formed between TiO2 and ZnS, which could efficiently boost separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and suppress charge recombination.22 Meanwhile, the Ag NPs can not only enhance the light harvesting efficiency because of localized surface plasmon resonance,36,37 but also play an important role as an electron-conduction bridge for electron transfer from ZnS to TiO2.38,39 Consequently, electrons migrated from ZnS to TiO2 and then to the counter electrode, rapidly reacting with Sn2− to product S2−. In the meantime, the holes on ZnS are trapped by S2− dissolved in the polysulfide electrolyte near the surface of ZnS to generate Sn2−.40,41 Beacause of Sn2− and S2− recycling, the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NT UVPD can achieve stable UV detection.

Conclusions
In summary, TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs are successfully synthesized by a photochemical method combined with the SILAR technique. The result shows that the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs UVPD can work at zero V. In comparison to the UVPDs based on TiO2 and TiO2/Ag, the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs UVPD exhibts a higher photocurrent density of 497 μA cm−2 and an on/off ratio of 9837, which can be attributed to the lower photogenerated electron–hole recombination. It's important to note that the self-powered UVPD based on the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs has a fast rise time of 0.16 s and decay time of 0.18 s, together with an outstanding linear optical signal response in a wide light intensity range. Considering the excellent performance of the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs composite, the TiO2/Ag/ZnS NTs can be also applied in many important applications, such as solar cells, photocatalysis, and nanodevices.
