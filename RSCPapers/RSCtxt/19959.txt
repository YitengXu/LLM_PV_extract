Part 5.—Pyranthrone–dodecane (containing aliphatic amines)(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Ramesh C. Ahuja and Karl HauffeAbstractThe phenomenon of electric-field-assisted, photon-stimulated charge transfer across the pyranthrone–dodecane (HMPA) interface, using a transient technique, has been investigated. By using various modes of illumination it has been established that intense trapping of charge carriers limits the quantum yield of charge injection at the interface. Furthermore, the effect of certain other aliphatic amines in dodecane on the photoinjected charge has also been investigated. It has been found that the nature and amount of binder material in the photoconductor layer also affects the charge injection at the interface. In addition, the results on the dependence of photoinjected charge on electric field, thickness of photoconductor layer, intensity and wavelength of light are presented and explained qualitatively.
