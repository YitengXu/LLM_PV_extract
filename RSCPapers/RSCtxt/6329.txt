    , Accepted 13th June 2021First published on 16th June 2021AbstractPerovskite single crystals (PSCs) can be used to fabricate high performance photoelectric detectors due to their superior optoelectronic characteristics. Generally, an external electric field needs to be applied in PSC-based detectors to improve their charge collection efficiency. However, the large external electric field increases the dark current, which will enlarge the noise current. To alleviate this drawback, an approach of fabricating a PSC-based heterojunction is proposed in this work, which contributes to reduced dark current in a relatively high reverse electric field. In this study, a heterojunction formed by epitaxially growing MAPbBr3 PSCs on Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs is reported, and it shows relatively low trap density and higher built-in potential. The as-fabricated Au-MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction-Au photodiode shows smaller dark current density, better long-term current stability and reduced noise level by approximately four orders compared to the Au–MAPbBr3 PSCs–Au photoconductor device under an external reverse voltage of 100 V (mean electric field of ∼31.5 V mm−1). Moreover, the pN heterojunction photodiode shows favorable X-ray detection performance, with a fast response time of 4.89 μs and high sensitivity of 1.72 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 for 50 kVp X-ray photons under a reverse electric field of 31.5 V mm−1. This work confirms that the epitaxial fabrication of PSC heterojunctions may be a promising strategy to enhance the performance of X-ray photodetectors.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites (MAPbX3, where MA = CH3NH3, X = Cl, Br, I) have received a tremendous amount of attention in recent decades due to their intriguing optical and electronic properties,1–3 which have been employed in a number of optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors,4,5 light-emitting diodes,6,7 lasers8,9 and solar cells.10–12 In comparison with polycrystalline thin films, perovskite single crystals (PSCs) are free of grain boundaries and exhibit lower charge trap densities, higher mobility–lifetime products, and better stability.13–16 In addition, due to their high-Z elements (Pb, Br, I, etc.) and thicknesses of a few millimeters, single crystal bulk perovskites have been successfully utilized as active absorbers with high attenuation coefficients for direct X-ray photon to current conversion.17–19 Most reported frameworks of direct X-ray detectors based on PSCs are perovskite crystals sandwiched between two metal electrodes. In these frameworks, charges generated by incident X-ray photons are shifted in PSCs and collected by electrons on both sides of the crystal under the external electric field. Generally, the applied external electric field is expected to be high to increase the drift length of charge carriers and reduce the charge trapping; however, this will also decrease the signal-noise ratio due to the increase of dark current.20 To improve the charge collection while decreasing the dark current at a high electric field, several approaches have been presented to overcome this drawback, including growing high quality alloyed perovskite SCs to improve bulk resistivity and using a guard ring electrode in the detector to reduce the crystal surface leakage current,21 forming a Schottky contact barrier by depositing an asymmetrical electrode on a crystal surface to reduce the dark current of the device,22,23 introducing an electron transport layer and hole transport layer to block injected electrons and holes,24,25 and selecting an exposed facet with improved charge carrier transport properties and a lower trap density.26 In spite of this progress, little work has been carried out to study X-ray pN junction photodiodes based on PSCs, which is an efficient stratagem to reduce dark current even at a high reverse voltage. In our previous work, we reported the fabrication of heterojunctions by epitaxially growing MAPbBrxCl3−x on MAPbCl3 PSCs and their successful application in X-ray detection.27–29 To further decrease the dark current of a heterojunction photodiode, it is significant to enlarge the heterojunction barrier.
Similar to silicon, gallium nitride, indium phosphide and other conventional semiconductors, the incorporation of impurity ions into perovskites can tune their optical and electrical properties and realize controlled incorporation of n-type or p-type dopants.30 Recently, a report of the successful addition of isovalent and heterovalent ions to perovskite was published.31,32 Especially for the PSCs with Bi3+ incorporation, positive effects were observed, such as prolonged stability, enhancement in the n-type electrical conductivity and red shifts of the absorption onset energy.33–36 However, subsequent studies have also reported that the addition of Bi3+ to perovskite crystal increases the within-gap trap states.34,37–39 This defect causes higher dark current and deterioration of optoelectronic properties, and photoelectric devices directly based on Bi-doped perovskite materials have been rarely reported to date.
Inspired by the above work, we herein report a structure of a pN photodiode based on an MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction. MAPbBr3 PSCs have already been proved to be slightly p-type semiconductors.21,28 Bi3+ ions doped into MAPbCl3 PSCs with a larger band gap could enhance their n-type conductivity, as with the incorporation of Bi3+ in MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3.32,40 The large barrier in the heterojunction could suppress the dark current effectively. In this work, Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs were dipped into MAPbBr3 precursor solution with several hours of epitaxial growth to fabricate pN heterojunctions. Considering the similar lattice constants of Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 and MAPbBr3 PSCs, this could support the fabrication of photodiodes based on a pN type PSC heterojunction with a small lattice mismatch rate (∼1.65%) and lower carrier trap density at the interface. The as-fabricated pN photodiodes based on the MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction exhibit rectification characteristics and maintain a small dark current density when a large reverse bias is applied (>100 V). Compared to the Au–MAPbBr3–Au photoconductor device, the pN PSC heterojunction photodiode shows smaller dark current density, improved long term current stability and a lower noise level under the same conditions due to the built-in space charge region. In addition, under a reverse bias of 100 V, the pN PSC heterojunction photodiode in this work suggests a fast response time of 4.89 μs and good X-ray detection performance, with a sensitivity of 1.72 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 for 50 kVp X-ray photons. This work reports a photoelectric device utilizing Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs and proposes an ideal method to obtain building blocks for sensitive X-ray photodetectors.
Experimental section
Material preparation
Methylamine ethanol solution (CH3NH2, 33 wt%), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt%), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%) were obtained from Aladdin. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.9%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.9%) and bismuth(III) chloride (BiCl3, ≥98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All commercial products were used as received.
Heterojunction device fabrication:
To synthesize methylamine chloride (MACl) and methylamine bromide (MABr), 1 mol L−1 HCl and 1 mol L−1 HBr were poured into 1 mol L−1 CH3NH2 solution, respectively. To increase the purity of the MACl and MABr powder, the raw powder was washed with ethanol and diethyl ether at least three times. White powder-like MACl and MABr were obtained after drying in vacuum at 150 °C. The optimized inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method was used to grow halide perovskite crystals in this work according to previously published work.36,41–43 The Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs could be grown by dissolving MACl (2.025 g), PbCl2 (8.34 g) and BiCl3 (0.946 g) in a 1:1:0.1 molar ratio in mixed solution with 30 mL DMF and 20 mL DMSO. To prepare the precursor solutions of MAPbBr3, MABr (3.36 g) and PbBr2 (11.01 g) in a 1:1 molar ratio was dissolved in 30 mL DMF. For the synthesis of the wrapped perovskite pN heterojunction, 10% Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 precursor solution was firstly heated from 40 °C to 60 °C over several days to obtain n-type PSCs. Then, the obtained n-type PSCs were placed into the MAPbBr3 precursor solution and epitaxially grown for several hours at 60 °C. Finally, the core-shell wrapped MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction bulks were obtained. The surrounding redundant parts of the as-fabricated core–shell wrapped heterojunction bulks were cut away using a fine diamond-impregnated wire sawing machine. To fabricate the heterojunction photodiodes with vertical structures, two Au (50 nm) electrodes were deposited on the two opposite surfaces of the heterojunction bulk by thermal evaporation in vacuum, respectively. The as-presented device in this work had an efficient electrode area of 16 mm2 and thickness of 3.18 mm. For comparison, an Au–MAPbBr3–Au device with an efficient electrode area of 25 mm2 and thickness of 2.91 mm was fabricated using the same approaches.
Device characterization and measurements:
SEM (scanning electron micrograph) images were obtained by a Quanta 200 FEI microscope (USA). PL (photoluminescence) patterns were obtained by an Edinburgh Instruments FS5 (UK) using a 355 nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser as the excitation source. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured by a Keithley 4200 semiconductor analyzer (USA) under room temperature. The responsivity spectra were measured using a Zolix tunable 500 W xenon arc lamp light as the illumination source and a Keithley 4200 semiconductor analyzer. The response time was measured using an Agilent oscilloscope (7.5G, USA) with a Keithley 2400 voltage source (USA) and a 532 nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a 6 ns pulse width at 20 Hz as the illumination source. The photocurrent in the X-ray detection performance was measured by a Keithley 6487 picoammeter. The 50 kVp X-ray photons were obtained from a digital radiography (DR) system with a setting tube voltage of 50 kV, which was provided by Perlove Medical (China). The dependence of the X-ray dose rate on the operating current of the X-ray tube was determined by a commercial dosimeter (FJ-347A, China).
Results and discussion
A detailed schematic of the perovskite pN heterojunction fabrication process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 precursor solution was decanted into a crystalline dish, and then the n-type Bi3+doped MAPbCl3 PSCs were grown from 40 °C to 60 °C. Subsequently, the as-fabricated n-type Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs were placed into an intrinsic MAPbBr3 precursor solution at 60 °C, and then p-type MAPbBr3 PSCs were epitaxially grown on the n-type Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs to form a wrapped external layer. After cutting the redundant parts around the crystal bulk, a perovskite pN heterojunction with a thickness of 3.18 mm was fabricated in which the thicknesses of Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 (yellow) and MAPbBr3 (orange) were 1.68 mm and 1.50 mm, respectively.

The digital photograph of the as-fabricated PSC heterojunction is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), from which a clear interface can be easily observed. More details of the as-fabricated heterojunction interface could be obtained from the cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph (SEM) image, which reveals the favorable contact between the MAPbBr3 and Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs. This finding is attributed to the similar lattice constants of Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 (∼5.6815 Å) and MAPbBr3 PSCs (∼5.8715 Å), with a lattice mismatch rate of approximately 1.65%, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The measured Bi/Pb atomic ratio (∼0.076) of the Bi-doped MAPbCl3 crystals, identified using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), was found to be substantially lower than the nominal Bi/Pb amount (0.1) in the precursor solution, as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). This indicates the formation of Pb vacancies and the superior difficulty of doping perovskites.32,34 Furthermore, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of MAPbCl3, Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 and the MAPbBr3 PSC heterojunction was investigated with a 355 nm pulsed laser as the excitation light source. As shown in Fig. 2(c), we observed a large decrease in the PL spectral intensity for MAPbCl3 after Bi3+ incorporation. This degradation in PL intensity should be ascribed to increased non-radiative recombination in Bi-doped MAPbCl3, which is consistent with the previous results for Bi-doped MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3.37,40

To fabricate the photodiode, the as-fabricated MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction was sandwiched by two Au electrodes deposited by thermal evaporation. The MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction bulk is the active layer for generating and transporting carriers. The Au electrodes on the Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 and MAPbBr3 surfaces are the anode and cathode, respectively. To shed light on the operation mechanism of the heterojunction photodiode, the energy band diagram of the photodiode in the equilibrium state under the reverse bias condition was then analyzed. The detailed energy band positions of the various PSCs are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S2) according to results reported previously.28,32,34,36,42 As clearly depicted in Fig. 3(a), the MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction shows a typical type II (staggered) energy band structure. After the p-type MAPbBr3 and n-type Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 contact each other, a built-in electric field pointed from n-type PSCs to p-type PSCs can be formed at the interface due to band bending. The energy barriers of the VBM (valance band maximum) and CBM (conduction band minimum) between MAPbBr3 and the Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs are estimated to be about 0.86 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively. Under a reverse external bias, the increased energy band barrier of the PSC heterojunction would effectively prevent electrons and holes from traversing the space charge region, which contributes to decreasing the dark current. As can be observed in Fig. 3(b), the I–V curve of the pN heterojunction photodiode shows typical rectification characteristics, which reveals a very small dark current under reverse bias sweep.

(b) I–V curve of the PSC heterojunction pN photodiode with bias sweeping from negative to positive. (c) Dark I–V response of the heterojunction device exhibiting different regions obtained from the logI versus logV plot. 
The conventional space charge limited current (SCLC) method is employed to investigate the transport properties of a device. The trap density (ntrap) and carrier mobility (μ) of the device can be derived from measuring the dark I–V curve. The dark I–V curve can be divided three regions, which are the linear ohmic region (blue), trap-filled region (red), and trap-free child region (green), as shown in Fig. 3(c). The linear I–V relation in the dark (blue line) indicates an ohmic response at low bias. Through the trap filling limited (TFL) region, the trap density was calculated based on the following equation:2 (1)where e, ε0, ε and L are the electronic charge, vacuum permittivity, relative dielectric constant and thickness of the device, respectively. VTFL is the voltage of the trap filling limit.
When operating in the trap-free child region, the carrier mobility (μ) of the device was fitted by the Mott–Gurney law:44 (2)where V and J represent the applied voltage and dark current density in the child region, respectively.
Depending on the VTFL (∼16.5 V) and ε (∼25) for the MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction, the trap density and mobility of the heterojunction were estimated to be about 4.59 × 109 cm−3 and 131 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, suggesting fantastic charge transport and collection efficiency.
Assuming a uniform electric field inside device, the single polarity Hecht equation could be adapted as:45 (3)where η is the charge collection efficiency (CCE), U is the applied voltage, d is the detector thickness, and μτ is the mobility and transit time product. According to the above equation, it is clear that the applied electric field in the device is required to be higher to increase the charge collection efficiency. However, the dark current would be enlarged at the same time that the applied voltage increases, which would decrease the signal-to-noise ratio and degrade the detection performance of the device. It is significant for photoelectrical detectors to maintain a small dark current at a relatively high applied external voltage. According to the literature,46,47 simulation of perovskite p–n heterojunctions was performed by multiphysics analysis in COMSOL, as shown in the ESI,† to investigate the mechanism and advantages. The simulation model is shown in Fig. S6.† The energy diagrams for the perovskite homo-junction and hetero-junction are compared in Fig. S7,† which indicates that the hetero-junction can further efficiently suppress the diffusion of holes from the p-type region due to the larger energy barrier of the valance band in the heterojunction. The simulation results also show that the dark current of the perovskite pN junction is quite small although a high reversed bias voltage is applied (Fig. S8†), and the nonequilibrium photo-current density is quite stable (Fig. S9†). For the heterojunction with a large bandgap in the n-type region, the dark current could be suppressed effectively, especially for the high bias electric field, as shown in Fig. S10.† The simulation proves that the perovskite heterojunction based on n-type large bandgap perovskite Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 is significant to further decrease the dark current.
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the dark current of the present heterojunction photodiode is reduced by approximately two orders compared with that of the Au–MAPbBr3–Au photoconductor under the reverse bias voltage. The smaller dark current of the present PSC heterojunction device under reverse bias is attributed to the enlarged barrier of the pN heterojunction, which prevents the electrons and holes from traversing the space charge region. The long-term dark current stability of the two devices at −100 V is also shown in Fig. 4(b). The amplitude of the vibration of the dark current for the PSC heterojunction photodiode is less than 0.78 nA, suggesting better long-term stability under a large reverse external electric field than that of the Au–MAPbBr3–Au photoconductor. Furthermore, the noise spectral density could be analyzed by fast Fourier transform (TTF) of the dark current. The results shown in Fig. 4(c) indicate that the present MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction photodiode possesses a relatively low noise level and decreases the noise current by 4 orders compared to the Au–MAPbBr3–Au photoconductor device.

(c) The noise spectral density of the PSC heterojunction device and Au–MAPbBr3–Au device based on the Fourier transform of the dark current. 
To investigate the photoelectricity properties of the present pN PSC heterojunction device, the J–V curve under light illumination with a 4 mW, 520 nm LED as the light source is measured in Fig. 5(a), and the working mode of the device under reverse bias with incident photons from the anode is illustrated in the inset. The μτ product of the as-fabricated pN PSC heterojunction was extracted by fitting the J–V response with the single-carrier Hecht equation. The μτ product was fitted as about 4.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1, indicating a favorable charge collection efficiency for the PSC heterojunction device. The photocurrent density of the heterojunction photodiode approaches the saturation threshold with enlarged external bias and was tested as 302 μA cm−2 at −100 V, suggesting relatively high sensitivity. The spectral photoresponse at −100 V was further measured under illumination of a xenon lamp with varied wavelengths. The responsivity (R) could be calculated by the following equation:48 (4)where Iλ is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, Pλ is the incident light power intensity, and S is the effective illuminated area. From the spectral photoresponse shown in Fig. 5(b), the present pN heterojunction device exhibits a relatively narrow bandwidth response with a peak at 540 nm. The peak corresponds to the reported absorption peak of the MAPbBr3 PSCs.41 It is worth noting that the responsivity of the device before 450 nm is much lower, although the absorption edge of the Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs could be 480 nm (Fig. S3†).36 This probably occurs because of the presence of the DX-like center (D: donor atom, X: unspecified lattice defect), a nonradiative recombination center, in Bi-doped halide perovskites. It has been hypothesized that electrons are trapped in the DX-like centers and recombine with holes from the valence band, leading to the fast decay of photocurrent, as proposed by Md Azimul Haque et al.35 The current–voltage curves (Fig. S4†) and transient photocurrent (Fig. S5†) of the doped MAPbCl3 were also measured under white light on–off switching, and the results are consistent with the results for doped MAPbBr3.35 Furthermore, the on–off switching properties of the MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction photodiode are presented in Fig. 5(c). It is obvious that the device can be switched on and off repeatedly and stably with different irradiance power densities illuminated by a 420 nm LED. To further investigate the response speed of the heterojunction photodiode, the transient photoresponse signal was measured using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a 6 ns pulse width at 20 Hz and recorded by an oscilloscope. The photodetectors collect the pulsed light signal emitted by a pulsed laser, and then the photogenerated carriers can be driven by a built-in potential field or external voltage bias applied to the respective electrodes. Therefore, the response speed can be defined as the photocurrent decay time from the peak down to approximately 1/e. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the device shows a fast response speed with a fall time (tfall) of 4.89 μs in an electric field of 31.5 V mm−1.

(d) Normalized transient current response of the PSC heterojunction device. 
It is noted that the as-fabricated MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction photodiodes have great potential in direct X-ray detection due to their thicknesses of several millimeters and small dark currents under a large reverse external voltage. The on–off current response of the heterojunction device under 50 kVp X-rays was also measured at −100 V, as shown in Fig. 6(a), which means that it is highly reproducible and stable in air. The photocurrent under 50 kVp X-ray exposure with different doses is investigated in Fig. 6(b). The photocurrent of the device at −100 V reaches nearly 120 nA cm−2 when the dose rate is 71.73 μGyair s−1, which indicates excellent X-ray detection performance for the PSC heterojunction photodiodes. Furthermore, the X-ray sensitivity (S) of the heterojunction photodiode could be calculated by the following equation:49 (5)where Q is the photo charge collected during radiation, X is the radiation dose during the test, and A is the area of the region receiving radiation. As a result, S is approximately 1.72 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 for 50 kVp X-rays, as shown in Fig. 6(c). In order to compare the performance of previously reported X-ray detectors based on organic/inorganic lead bromide perovskite single crystals with this work, various relevant device parameters reported in the literature are summarized in Table 1. A comparison of the sensitivities obtained from published data reveals that the sensitivity of the PSC heterojunction X-ray detector is relatively high. This is attributed to the increased collected photo charges and decreased transit time of carriers due to the low dark current and high applied voltage bias. Moreover, the high mobility and low trap density of the PSC heterojunction benefit the transport of photogenerated carriers and reduce the recombination loss. The high sensitivity and response speed of the heterojunction detector at high bias exceed those of most state-of-the-art reported lead bromide perovskite detectors. It was also proved that the Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSCs epitaxially grown on MAPbBr3 PSCs to form a pN heterojunction help improve the response speed and enhance the X-ray detection performance.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully fabricated a pN perovskite heterojunction device using a solution-processed epitaxy growth method. The as-fabricated MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction possesses a low trap density of about 4.59 × 109 cm−3 and carrier mobility of about 131 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the Au–MAPbBr3–Au device without built-in potential, the Au-PSC heterojunction-Au device shows smaller dark current, improved long term current stability and lower noise power density under the same conditions. The present PSC heterojunction photodiode shows a small dark current density and noise level under external reverse bias voltage due to the enlarged built-in potential of the pN heterojunction by Bi3+ doped in MAPbCl3 PSCs. Additionally, the device indicates a relatively narrow bandwidth response in the visible range of the spectra, with a peak at 540 nm. Significantly, the as-fabricated MAPbBr3/Bi3+-doped MAPbCl3 PSC heterojunction photodiode reveals excellent potential for application in direct X-ray detection, with a high sensitivity of up to 1.72 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 for 50 kVp X-rays and a fast response time of up to 4.89 μs by applying an external 100 V reverse bias. The above results confirm that the fabrication of PSC heterojunctions by solution-processed epitaxial growth aids enhanced X-ray detection performance and may be a promising strategy to obtain superior perovskite single crystal X-ray detectors in future.
