    , Accepted 29th April 2016First published on 16th May 2016AbstractPhotocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction using a Ru(II) tris-diimine complex (Ru) as a photosensitiser and dinuclear Re(I) diimine tricarbonyl complexes (Re(n)Re), in which diimine ligands are connected by alkyl chains of various lengths (–CnH2n–: n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 14), as catalysts were investigated. The photocatalytic systems using Re(n)Re exhibited improved durability compared with that using the corresponding mononuclear Re(I) complex (Re); moreover, among the Re(n)Re, shorter alkyl chains in the bridging ligands induced greater durability. We found that the durability of the photocatalytic system depended on the decomposition speed of Ru, which could be suppressed using Re(n)Re with shorter alkyl chains.
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using metal complexes as the main players, i.e. photosensitisers, catalysts or even photocatalysts, has been actively investigated because the conversion of CO2 to energy-rich compounds using solar energy is expected to be a promising technology for resolving serious problems, e.g. shortages of energy and carbon resources and global warming.1,2
Since Lehn et al. (1983) first reported that fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3X (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; X = Cl, Br) could photocatalyse the reduction of CO2,3,4 rhenium(I) diimine carbonyl complexes have attracted great attention as photocatalysts and catalysts for CO2 reduction with high efficiency and selectivity.5–12 For example, irradiation to fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl in an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution containing triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor resulted in the selective catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Detailed mechanistic studies of this photocatalytic system clarified that fac-Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl acts as a redox photosensitiser,13,14 and the Re(I) complex capturing CO2 with the assistance of TEOA acts as a catalyst15 which is produced in the initial stage of the photocatalytic reduction. The coexistence of another redox photosensitiser such as [Ru(dmb)3]2+ (dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) with the Re(I) complex, which functions only as a catalyst in this case, greatly improved the durability of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.6 Some aspects of the reaction mechanism of the catalysis of Re(I) complexes have been previously clarified; however, other processes have not. As described above, we recently reported that a Re(I) complex with a deprotonated TEOA ligand, i.e. Re(bpy)(CO)3(OC2H4NR2) (R = C2H4OH), can quite efficiently capture a CO2 molecule giving Re(bpy)(CO)3{OC(O)OC2H4NR2};15 this CO2 adduct should be produced as a main Re(I) species during the photocatalytic reactions and act as a catalyst for CO2 reduction in most photocatalytic systems using fac-[ReI(N^N)(CO)3L]n+-type complexes (N^N = diimine ligand) in the presence of TEOA. The Re(I) complex is reduced and converted into the one-electron-reduced species (OERS) by redox photosensitisation with the photosensitiser. Although much effort has been dedicated to clarifying the subsequent processes, they remain unclear. Fujita et al. proposed the μ-CO2 Re(0) dimer as a precursor of CO formation, where one CO2 molecule bridges two Re0(N^N)(CO)3 units;16–18 however, Gibson et al. proposed the carboxylato complex Re(N^N)(CO)3{C(O)OH},19,20 which was recently detected in the photocatalytic reaction solution through cold-spray ionisation spectrometry, as the precursor.21
Rieger et al. reported the use of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as photocatalysts, of whose two rhenium(I) units were connected by an alkyl spacer, i.e. –C2H4– and –C12H24–.10 In this system, the rhenium(I) dinuclear complex should function both as a photosensitiser and a catalyst; however, it has not been clarified which function (or both) was (or were) improved by the dimerisation. Recently, they reported photocatalytic CO2 reduction using a rhenium(I) dinuclear complex as a catalyst and [Ru(dmb)3]2+ as a photosensitiser; only the rhenium(I) dinuclear catalyst with an ethylene spacer exhibited better photocatalytic abilities compared with the corresponding mononuclear Re(I) complex.12 However, systematic investigation into the photocatalysis of dinuclear Re(I) complexes with various lengths of alkyl chains has not been reported. Gilson, Kubiak et al. recently reported that a rhenium(I) dimer complex connected by hydrogen bonds exhibited better catalysis than the corresponding mononuclear complex in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.11
We herein report the systematic investigation of catalysis using rhenium(I) dinuclear complexes (Re(n)Re, Chart 1) in which diimine ligands are connected by alkyl chains of various lengths (–CnH2n–: n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 14). By employing [Ru(dmb)3]2+ (Ru) as a photosensitiser, we could focus solely on the effects of the alkyl chain on the catalytic function of Re(n)Re, which has two CO2 adducts, i.e. fac-Re(BL)(CO)3L units (L = OC(O)OCH2CH2N(CH2CH2OH)2).
 Chart 1  Structures and abbreviations of Re(I) dinuclear and mononuclear complexes. 
The rhenium(I) dinuclear complexes were first synthesised and isolated in a form with two acetonitrile ligands, i.e. [{Re(CO)3(NCCH3)}2(BL)]2+, and then the acetonitrile ligands were substituted via three steps in solution to afford the corresponding CO2 adducts in quantitative yield (eqn (1)) prior to photophysical, electrochemical and photocatalytic measurements according to the reported synthesis methods for the corresponding mononuclear complexes.15 (1)

Fig. 1 shows the IR and UV–vis absorption spectra of Re(2)Re, Re(14)Re and Re. In the IR spectrum of Re, three peaks were observed at νCO = 2018, 1913 and 1889 cm−1, which can be attributed to the vibration modes of three carbonyl ligands coordinated to the rhenium(I) center in the facial form. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of Re showed a broad absorption band at λmaxabs = 357 nm, attributed to the singlet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (1MLCT) excitation. The spectra of Re(14)Re were almost identical to those of Re. In the case of Re(2)Re, however, νCO was slightly shifted to a higher energy, and the MLCT absorption band was slightly red shifted. Table 1 summarises νCO and λmaxabs of all Re(I) complexes. Similar spectral shifts were observed in the case of Re(3)Re but not in the cases of Re(4)Re and Re(6)Re. These results clearly indicate that in only the dinuclear complexes with short alkyl chains, i.e. ethylene and propylene chains, there is a weak electronic interaction between two Re complex units through the alkyl chains.

Fig. 2 illustrates cyclic voltammograms of Re(2)Re, Re(3)Re, Re(14)Re and Re measured in CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Et4NBF4 as an electrolyte. All the complexes exhibited an irreversible reduction wave at around −1.8 V vs. Ag/AgNO3, attributed to reduction of the diimine ligand (Fig. 2b), followed by a catalytic wave for CO2 reduction (Fig. 2a).22 Since the onset potentials of the first reductions of all the Re(I) complexes were around −1.7 V (Fig. 2a), which is more positive than that of the photosensitiser Ru (E1/2 = −1.82 V vs. Ag/AgNO3), electron transfer from the OERS of Ru to all the Re complexes should proceed efficiently in the photocatalytic reactions. Notably, the first catalytic waves of Re(2)Re and Re(3)Re were observed at more positive potentials than those of Re and Re(14)Re.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms of Re (0.5 mM, black line), Re(2)Re (0.25 mM, red line), Re(3)Re (0.25 mM, green broken line) and Re(14)Re (0.25 mM, blue line) measured in CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Et4NBF4 (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte with a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode at a 200 mV s−1 scan rate. Orange broken line shows the blank measurement in the same condition. 
Photocatalytic reactions for CO2 reduction were conducted under the following conditions. A CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, 0.1 M) as a sacrificial electron donor, Ru (0.05 mM) as a photosensitiser and Re(n)Re or Re as a catalyst was irradiated at λex > 500 nm. The concentration of Re(n)Re (0.025 mM) was adjusted to half that of Re (0.05 mM). In all cases, the main product was CO, accompanied by the production of a small amount of H2 (the selectivity of CO formation was >84% after 18 h irradiation, Table 2). Irradiation of the solution consisting of only Ru and BNAH without a Re(I) catalyst produced H2 but scarcely produced CO. Turnover numbers for CO production (TONCO) are shown as a function of irradiation time in Fig. 3. TONs after 18 h irradiation and turnover frequencies (TOF) are summarised in Table 2, with quantum yields for CO formation (ΦCO) using monochromatic light at λex = 510 nm for irradiation.

In cases using Re(n)Re, larger amounts of CO were produced than when using Re as the catalyst. Among the photocatalytic systems using Re(n)Re, the shorter bridging alkyl chains exhibited higher TONCO (λex > 500 nm). In particular, usage of the Re(2)Re catalyst produced a 2.7 times greater amount of CO than that obtained using Re, and TONCO reached 192 after 18 h irradiation. In cases with higher light intensity (6.0 × 10−8 einstein s−1, λex = 510 nm), the Re(n)Re systems with shorter alkyl chains showed higher ΦCO; the highest ΦCO was obtained using Re(2)Re (ΦCO = 8.4%), which was 1.4 times higher than that obtained using Re (ΦCO = 6.1%). Although, on the other hand, usage of half-intensity light (3.0 × 10−8 einstein s−1) gave similar quantum yields in the systems using the dimers with n ≤ 6 (ΦCO = 9.8% to 10.0%), these values were higher than the systems using Re and Re(14)Re. Therefore, the dinuclear complexes (Re(n)Re) worked better as catalysts in the photocatalytic systems with the Ru photosensitiser and BNAH as a reductant compared with the corresponding mononuclear Re complex (Re), and the length of the alkyl chain in the bridging ligand strongly affected the catalysis of the Re(I) binuclear complexes, i.e. a shorter alkyl chain could induce greater durability of the photocatalytic system.
Since TONCOs indicating the durability of the photocatalytic systems were strongly affected by the catalyst, the transformations of the complexes during the photocatalytic reactions were monitored using both IR and UV–vis absorption spectra as well as ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Fig. 4 shows the IR and UV–vis absorption spectral changes of the reaction solution of the Ru and Re(2)Re system as an example. A drastic change in the IR spectrum was not observed even after 18 h irradiation. In the UV–vis absorption spectra, on the other hand, the 1MLCT absorption band of Ru (λmaxabs = 460 nm) drastically decreased during the photocatalytic reaction. This absorption spectral change during the photocatalytic reaction, i.e., the decrease of 1MLCT absorption of Ru (∼460 nm) and the increase of absorption at longer wavelength, is attributable to the ligand substitution reaction of Ru, of which one dmb ligand was substituted by solvent molecules (L) (eqn (2)).23,24 (2)
 Fig. 4  FT-IR (a) and UV–vis (b) absorption spectra of the reaction solution: a CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing BNAH (0.1 M), Ru (IR: 0.5 mM, UV–vis: 0.05 mM) and Re(2)Re (IR: 0.25 mM, UV–vis: 0.025 mM) was irradiated at λex > 500 nm. 
These results clearly indicate that Re(2)Re was stable during the photocatalytic reaction, while the decomposition of Ru proceeded. This decomposition is believed to be the main deactivation process of the photocatalytic system. Since CO production in the absence of Re catalysts was negligible (Table 2), the decomposed products of Ru, i.e., [Ru(dmb)2(L)2]2+, should not function as a catalyst for CO formation.
The decomposition process of Ru was quantitatively analysed using UPLC equipped with a size exclusion chromatography column. Fig. 5a shows chromatograms of the reaction solutions using Ru and Re(2)Re with different irradiation times. Although the peaks of Ru and Re(2)Re were observed at similar retention times (∼9.5 min), we successfully quantified the amounts of Ru in the reaction solution using 450 nm as the detection wavelength, which was absorbed only by Ru. The Ru peak gradually decreased during the photocatalytic reaction: 27% of Ru decomposed over 3 h irradiation, and even after 18 h irradiation, approximately 34% of Ru still remained in the reaction solution. It is noteworthy that the photocatalytic formation of CO still continued after the 18 h irradiation, although the speed of formation drastically decreased. In the case where Re was used instead of Re(2)Re, however, more rapid decomposition of Ru was observed. Fig. 5b shows the chromatograms of the reaction solution in this case: the peaks at 9.5 and 9.8 min were attributed to Ru and Re, respectively, where the detection wavelength was 350 nm. Irradiation for 3 h caused 48% of Ru to decompose, and only 16% Ru remained after 18 h irradiation. In contrast, the Re peak scarcely decreased even after 18 h irradiation. Fig. 6 summarises the decomposition speeds of Ru in all the photocatalytic systems. Although Ru gradually decomposed during the photocatalytic reaction in all cases, the decomposition was more strongly suppressed in the superior photocatalytic systems. Now, we can conclude that decomposition of the photosensitiser Ru was the main deactivation process of the photocatalysis, while the Re catalysts were relatively stable under these reaction conditions. In other words, to increase the durability of photocatalytic systems using the Ru photosensitiser and the Re catalyst, the deactivation of Ru must be suppressed during the photocatalytic reaction. Since Ru was scarcely decomposed by irradiation in the absence of BNAH, the decomposition of Ru in the photocatalytic reaction should not proceed owing to the photochemical ligand substitution reaction via the excited state of Ru, while the photochemical decomposition of Ru− should proceed.

The amounts of Ru were determined from the peak area at 9.5 min in the size exclusion chromatogram observed at 450 nm. 
To clarify the improvement in the photocatalytic durability and activity using Re(n)Re, especially in the case of Re(2)Re, the following mechanistic investigations were conducted. In the mixed systems using the Ru photosensitiser and the Re catalyst, Ru selectively absorbed the irradiated light, giving the triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) excited state. The excited state was reductively quenched by BNAH, giving the OERS of Ru, i.e.Ru−, and the one-electron-oxidised species of BNAH, i.e. BNAH˙+, with a quenching rate constant of 1.2 × 107 M−1 s−1 (eqn (3)). It has been reported that electron transfer proceeds from Ru− to Re (eqn (4)),6 and BNAH˙+ is deprotonated by TEOA to give BNA˙, which is quantitatively dimerised, giving BNA2 (eqn (5)).25,26 This function of TEOA as a base suppresses back electron transfer from Ru− to BNAH˙+ and improves the efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction. (3) (4) (5)
Since similar processes should occur in the cases of Re(n)Re, the electron transfer process from the OERS of Ru to the Re(I) catalyst might affect the photocatalyses of Re(n)Re. Therefore, we determined the electron transfer rates from Ru− to Re(2)Re (kRe(2)Reet) and to Re (kReet) by laser flash photolysis. As previously reported, the transient absorption spectra of the DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Ru (0.3 mM) and BNAH (0.1 M) after a laser flash at λex = 532 nm show a new absorption band at λmax = 510 to 550 nm, which is attributed to Ru−.9 Similar measurements were performed in the presence of Re(2)Re or Re. The production and decrease of Ru− were followed using the absorbance changes at 510 nm because the absorption of Ru− was maximised at this wavelength.27 In all the cases, the decay of Ru− was fitted with a single exponential function, and the observed rate constants (kobs) could be resolved as follows:kobs = kbet[BNAH˙+] + ket[Re catalyst]where kbet and ket are the rate constants of back electron transfer from Ru− to BNAH˙+ and of electron transfer from Ru− to the Re catalyst, respectively. Fig. 7a shows the decay of absorbance at λabs = 510 nm of a CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Ru (0.3 mM), Re(2)Re (0.15 mM) and BNAH (0.1 M) after laser irradiation at λex = 532 nm, which could be analysed as first-order kinetics with kRe(2)Reet = 3.6 × 108 M−1 s−1. In the system using Re instead of Re(2)Re, on the other hand, the decay at λex = 532 nm was about three times slower (kReet = 1.2 × 108 M−1 s−1). Note that the concentration of Re(2)Re was 0.15 mM, while that of Re was 0.3 mM, adjusting for the concentrations of the Re units in both cases; moreover, in the absence of the Re catalyst, the decay was much slower, as shown in Fig. 7b. Therefore, the actual decay rate constants of Ru− were kRe(2)Reet[Re(2)Re] = 5.3 × 104 s−1 and kReet[Re] = 3.6 × 104 s−1, i.e. the electron transfer from Ru− to Re(2)Re was about 1.5 times faster than that to Re.
 Fig. 7  Absorption change at 510 nm after laser irradiation: a CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing BNAH (0.1 M) and Ru (0.3 mM) in the presence (a) and absence (b) of Re(2)Re (0.15 mM) was irradiated at 532 nm with a Nd:YAG pulse laser under degassed conditions at room temperature. The red line shows the fitting result. 
Since the first reduction potentials of these two Re catalysts were very similar, as described above (Fig. 2), the increase of the electron transfer rate by the dinucleation of the Re catalyst cannot be explained by the difference in the free energy change of electron transfer from Ru− to the Re catalyst. A possible explanation might be the suppression of back electron transfer from the OERS of the dinuclear Re catalyst to Ru owing to an intramolecular electron transfer from the OERS of one Re unit to another (Scheme 1b); if such an intramolecular electron transfer proceeded, the OERS of the Re unit in the binuclear Re complexes should be at a longer distance from Ru compared with Re (Scheme 1a).
 Scheme 1  Intermolecular electron transfer from the OERS of Ru to the Re catalyst and the subsequent processes in the cases using (a) Re and (b) Re(2)Re. 
Accumulation of Ru− was observed in the reaction solutions during the photocatalytic reaction. Fig. 8 shows the accumulation of the OERS of Ru during 75 min irradiation when CO was produced linearly in all cases using Re, Re(2)Re and Re(14)Re. The positive absorption at 510–550 nm is attributed to the accumulated Ru−. In the three photocatalytic systems, the amount of accumulated Ru− was the largest in the case of Re, whose catalytic ability was the lowest; moreover, in the case of the most efficient catalyst, i.e.Re(2)Re, the lowest accumulation of Ru− was observed. These results also suggest that more efficient CO2 reduction can be induced by the faster total rate of electron transfer from Ru− to the Re catalyst.
 Fig. 8  Accumulation of OERS of Ru over 75 min irradiation: a CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing BNAH (0.1 M), Ru (0.05 mM) and Re catalyst (Re(2)Re (0.025 mM, a), Re(14)Re (0.025 mM, b) and Re (0.05 mM, c)) was irradiated using 510 nm light with a light intensity of 6.0 × 10−8 einstein s−1. 
The electron transfer from Ru− to the Re catalyst (eqn (4)) should compete with the back electron transfer from Ru− to BNAH˙+ (eqn (6)), which is one of the wasting processes of the photons absorbed by Ru. Since the OERS of the Re catalyst rapidly consumes the added electron to produce CO and since Ru− is much more stable, faster electron transfer from Ru− to the Re catalyst should suppress the back electron transfer to BNAH˙+ and thereby induce a higher efficiency of CO2 reduction. Ru− + BNAH˙+ → Ru + BNAH(6)
In the ΦCO measurements with half-light intensity (3.0 × 10−8 einstein s−1), the photocatalytic systems using dinuclear Re catalysts with n ≤ 6 produced CO with similar efficiencies (ΦCO = 9.8% to 10.0%), which were 1.1 times higher than that using Re (ΦCO = 8.8%). Under these conditions, accumulation of Ru− was almost negligible using Re(n)Re with n ≤ 6. These results indicate that at lower light intensity, the subsequent processes after the intermolecular electron transfer from Ru− to Re(n)Re (n ≤ 6) are not rate-determining steps; therefore, among the Re(n)Re (n ≤ 6) systems, the ΦCO values stayed almost constant. In other words, using the dinuclear Re catalysts with n ≤ 6, the efficiencies of the intermolecular electron transfer from Ru− to Re(n)Re were very similar and were higher than that using Re, because the inhibition of the back electron transfer shown in Scheme 1b was also effective. At the higher light intensity of 6.0 × 10−8 einstein s−1, the photocatalytic systems using Re dimers with shorter alkyl chains in the bridging ligand exhibited higher efficiency for CO formation. These phenomena can be understood from the switch of the rate-determining step at higher light intensity to the subsequent processes after the reduction of the Re dimer and the faster subsequent processes with shorter alkyl chains. The faster CO2 reduction at the Re dimer will increase the concentration of Re(n)Re in the ground state and consequently decrease the accumulation of Ru−, as shown in Fig. 8. Since accumulated Ru− in solution gives an internal filter effect, the lower concentration of Ru− during photocatalysis will increase the ΦCO values. The higher ΦCO values at lower light intensity support the presence of the inner filter effect. In summary, we have found two of the reasons why the Re(n)Re systems exhibited higher efficiency for CO production compared with the Re system: (1) suppression of the back electron transfer process from the OERS of Re(n)Re to Ru and (2) faster subsequent processes after the one-electron reduction of Re(n)Re.
The higher durability of Ru in the Re(n)Re systems with shorter alkyl chains in the bridging ligands compared with that in the Re system can be logically explained from the higher efficiencies of CO formation. As described above, the photochemical reaction of Ru− should be the main decomposition process of Ru. Therefore, the higher efficiencies of the intermolecular electron transfer from Ru− to Re(n)Re and the faster CO2 reduction on Re(n)Re catalysts shortened the detention time of Ru− in the reaction solution and lowered the frequency of excitation of Ru−, thus extending the lifetime of Ru.
Conclusions
In photocatalytic systems using a Ru(II) photosensitiser (Ru), dinuclear Re(I) complexes (Re(n)Re) functioned as more efficient and durable catalysts for CO2 reduction compared with the corresponding mononuclear Re(I) complex (Re). When comparing the Re(n)Re complexes, shorter alkyl chains in the bridging ligands induced greater durability. Two main factors induced improvements in the photocatalysis: (1) faster electron transfer from Ru− to Re(n)Re than to Re, which suppressed back electron transfer from Ru− to BNAH˙+ and (2) acceleration of the processes following electron transfer in the systems using Re(n)Re, especially with shorter alkyl chains, compared with that using Re. Because of these effects, usage of Re(n)Re shortened the detention time of the produced Ru− in the reaction solution, suppressing the decomposition of Ru−, which was the main reason for the decline in photocatalysis. On the other hand, all Re(I) catalysts were stable in the photocatalytic reactions.
Experimental
General procedures

1H NMR spectra were measured in chloroform-d and acetonitrile-d3 using a JEOL AL300 (300 MHz) or EXA400II (400 MHz) system. The residual protons of chloroform-d and acetonitrile-d3 were used as internal standards for the measurements. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded with a JASCO V-565 spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded with a JASCO FT/IR-610 spectrometer in acetonitrile or CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution. Electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) was performed using a Shimadzu LCMS-2010A system with acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The redox potentials of the complexes were measured in a CO2-saturated DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Et4NBF4 (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte by cyclic voltammetric techniques using an ALS/CHI CHI-720Dx electrochemical analyser with a glassy carbon disk working electrode (3 mm diameter), a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. The supporting electrolyte was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 1 day prior to use. The scan rate was 200 mV s−1.
Preparation of Re–CO2–TEOA adducts
As described above, Re–CO2–TEOA adducts, [Re(N^N)(CO)3{OC(O)OC2H4N(C2H4OH)2}] (N^N = diimine ligand), were employed as catalysts. Since the Re(I) complexes were isolated with acetonitrile as a ligand, i.e. [Re(N^N)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+, Re–CO2–TEOA adducts were prepared according to the following procedures before the photocatalytic reactions, UV–vis absorption and IR spectra measurements, cyclic voltammetry measurements and laser flash photolysis. First, [Re(N^N)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ were dissolved in DMF and the solutions were maintained in the dark overnight. Second, TEOA was added to the DMF solutions and maintained in the dark for over 2 h. Finally, CO2 bubbling for 20 min through the DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solutions gave Re–CO2–TEOA adducts.
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were performed in 4 mL DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Ru (0.05 mM), Re (0.05 mM) or Re(n)Re (0.025 mM) and BNAH (0.1 M). After the solution was purged with CO2 for 20 min, the solution was irradiated. For TON measurements, the mixed solution in an 11 mL test tube (i.d. 8 mm) was irradiated in a merry-go-round apparatus using >500 nm light from a high-pressure Hg lamp equipped with a uranyl glass and a K2CrO4 (30% w/w, light pass length: 1 cm) solution filter. For quantum yield measurements, the mixed solution in a quartz cubic cell (11 mL, light pass length: 1 cm) was irradiated in a Shimadzu photoreaction quantum yield evaluation system QYM-01 using 510 nm light from a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 510 nm (FWHM: 10 nm) bandpass filter. The temperature of the solution was controlled during irradiation at 25 ± 0.1 °C using an IWAKI CTS-134A constant-temperature system. The gaseous products of photocatalysis, i.e. CO and H2, were analysed by GC-TCD (GL science GC323). The metal complexes after photocatalysis were analysed using a Shimadzu UHPLC Nexera X2 system consisting of a Waters ACQUITY SEC column (150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.), a SPD-M30A UV–vis photodiode array detector, an LC-30AD pump and a Shimadzu DGS-20A degasser. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C using a CTO-20AC column oven, and the mobile phase was a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and methanol containing 0.5 M CH3COONH4 with a flow rate of 0.2 mL min−1.
Time-resolved UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
Second-harmonic-generation light at 532 nm produced with a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray LAB-150-10 pulsed Nd:YAG laser was used for excitation (10 ns FWHM). An Ushio 300 W Xe arc lamp was operated in pulse-enhanced mode (500 μs duration) using an XC-300 power supply and a YXP-300 light pulsar (Eagle Shoji) as a monitoring light source. The monitoring light beam was passed through a quartz cuvette (10 × 10 × 40 mm) that contained the sample and was directed into an R926 photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics) on a Jobin–Yvon HR-320 monochromator. Time profiles of the monitoring light intensity were stored using a LeCroy WaveRunner 640zi oscilloscope (4 GHz bandwidth). Transient spectra were obtained with an Andor Technology iStar H320T-18F-03 (690 channels; minimum gate width: 5 ns) ICCD detector head mounted on the HR-320 monochromator. A DMF–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution containing Ru (0.3 mM), BNAH (0.1 M) and Re (0.3 mM) or Re(2)Re (0.15 mM) was bubbled with CO2 prior to laser flash photolysis.
Materials
DMF was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled under reduced pressure (10–20 mmHg). TEOA was distilled under reduced pressure (<1 mmHg). They were kept under Ar before use. All other reagents were reagent-grade quality and used without further purification.
