    , Accepted 9th March 2021First published on 10th March 2021AbstractThe Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) plays an essential role in hydrogen production via water splitting, metal–air secondary batteries, and artificial photosynthesis. Among the various OER catalysts, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted significant attention due to their compositional and structural flexibility, as well as tenability, and have been acknowledged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts. Nonetheless, OER possesses sluggish kinetics because it involves a four-electron pathway. Numerous efforts directed to tailoring the structure and composition of electrocatalysts have resulted in accelerated intrinsic catalytic activity and more exposed active sites, and subsequently advanced electrocatalytic performance. In this review, the recent progress of LDHs for the OER and the primary mechanisms for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity are presented. Besides, other tactics for promoting the catalytic performance, such as synthesis of LDH-based derivatives and configurations of heterostructures, are summarized, followed by a hypothesis on the enhanced OER activity. Finally, the applications of the OER, as well as the challenges in using LDHs are also discussed.Jie YuJie Yu received her bachelors degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Shihezi University in 2019.

1. Introduction
With the increasing energy demand and deteriorating environmental issues, green energy storage and its transformation have attracted significant attention. Hydrogen energy has become one of the most competitive green energies because of its high energy storage capacity, clean combustion, and renewable generation. Besides these advantages, the electrolysis of water producing hydrogen and oxygen offers new possibilities for increasingly pure hydrogen production. As it is widely acknowledged, two half-reactions, i.e., the anodic Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and the cathodic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) are involved in water-splitting.1 Currently, researchers have found many materials showing excellent HER catalytic performance. However, OER performance still requires a higher superpotential to match HER rates due to the multiple chemical reactions involved in electron coupling to intermediate states and the relatively slow reaction kinetics. Therefore, the OER is considered a bottleneck for practical application of hydrogen energy, and active OER catalysts are urgently needed to address these deficiencies.
Numerous studies have focused on producing controllable and common non-precious metal OER catalysts aiming to develop high-performance catalysts comparable to or even superior to noble metals. Layered double hydroxide (LDH), such as hydrotalcite, which has a two-dimensional stratified structure and possesses the characteristic tunable properties of layered materials, is a typical example. Its catalytic activity for oxygen evolution is comparable to that of precious metals like ruthenium and iridium.2 It is an anion intercalation material with a layered structure similar to octahedral magnesium compounds. The unique combination of lamination and interlamination provides various properties. The general formula of two-dimensional LDHs is: [M1−x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+(Ax/nn−)·mH2O, in which M is M2+ (divalent metal ion) or M3+ (trivalent metal ion) with a radius similar to that of Mg2+, and An− is the anion ligand between layers. X is the molar ratio of the trivalent metal ions relative to the sum of the trivalent and divalent metal ions. The primary lamination is composed of MO6 octahedral ligands. Because of the holocrystalline substitution of M2+ by M3+, the primary lamination is positively charged. Therefore, a negatively charged anion locating between the layers enables the overall electrical neutrality of LDH. The molar ratio and arrangement of M3+ and M2+ on the main lamellae could directly affect the charge density and charge distribution. The volume, valence, and number of anions may affect the spacing between layers.
The combination of different laminate cations or guest anions allows LDH materials to be employed in a wide variety of applications, thus offering many opportunities to highlight the advantages and research value of various LDH formulations. Among the reported LDH structures, M2+ mainly represents Mg2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+; trivalent cations include Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Mn3+, etc.; interlayer anions include CO32−, NO3−, SO42−, F−, ClO4−, PO43−, etc.3 The general LDH synthesis approaches are the hydrothermal method, co-precipitation method and sol–gel method. Additionally, we also noticed some more new methods reported, such as the flash nano-precipitation (FNP) method, microwave hydrothermal method and plasma method. Such new methods not only shorten the synthesis time, but also lay the foundation for the large-scale applications of LDHs. More importantly, different intercalated anions have a great impact on their performance, which could be attributed to the modulability and diversity of the anions. So, LDHs show rich convertibility and have various applications, such as catalysis, adsorption, electrochemical analysis, energy storage and transformation. Particularly, LDHs have been widely used as electrocatalysts. And, the hydroxyl group present in LDHs is especially beneficial to the OER reaction.
In this review, we explain OER mechanisms for electrochemistry applications and describe the modifications of LDHs through different regulation strategies and functionalization of the structures. This paper also summarizes the possible LDH-derived nanomaterials that can replace precious metals such as ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir). Besides, the current development of LDH-based composites is also discussed. Finally, we focus on energy conversion and storage devices, which represent one of the recent advances in the practical applications of 2D-LDHs.
2. Fundamentals of the OER
In early 1983, OER catalysis reaction mechanisms were put forth by a chemist named Bockris, who believed that OER begins with the electrochemical adsorption of OH− at the active catalytic site, subsequently leading to the formation of H2O2 intermediates, and finally ends with the desorption of oxygen.4 Many researchers have carried out theoretical analyses of the OER pathway under the proposed framework.5–7 For example, Li et al. used Density Functional Theory and Coulombic interactions (DFT+U method) to explain the OER of hydroxylated hematite (α-Fe2O3),8 suggesting that it is a promising photoanode material for the generation of hydrogen and oxygen by water pyrolysis. Ni doped to the α-Fe2O3 surface favors the OER reaction pathway and has the lowest overpotential. Ali proposed using the oxygen precipitation mechanism that OH− on the transition metal atom Co is dehydrogenated to form an excited state O* double bond, leaving Co in the +4 valence state.9–11 A second OH− attaches on another Co atom and is dehydrogenated, forming another O* double bond that leaves Co in the +4 valence state again. The O* atoms form a covalent bond, while the Co atom reacts with a molecule of water to generate an OO* complex and is reduced to the +3 valence state, and finally, OO* is converted to molecular oxygen. Nejati proposed another reaction mechanism for the water-splitting reaction.12,13 It suggested that H2O produces OH* and decomposes it into O*. Then, it reacts with a molecule of water to form OOH* and eventually is precipitated out as oxygen. The primary function of an OER electrocatalyst is reactant adsorption on the catalyst surface to form adsorption intermediates, which facilitates the charge transfer between the electrodes and the reactants.14–16 The OER of LDHs in an alkaline electrolyte is shown in Fig. 1a. A large amount of OH− in the solution forms adsorbed OH* (R1) on the LDH surface, which forms adsorbed oxygen O* after deprotonation (R2). Then, it adsorbs another OH− in the step R3 to form the intermediate OOH*, which is finally deprotonated and desorbed to form O2 (R4). Gibbs free energy calculation was carried out for identification of the difference in the adsorption of O and OH at the metal sites for the OER (Fig. 1b). It was observed that Ni, Co, and Fe were located close to the volcanic peak in the adsorption curve and demonstrated good catalytic activity. On the other hand, it was found that in the second step and the fourth step of the OER, there is a big difference between the theoretically calculated value and the actual measured value (Fig. 1c), suggesting that it should be carefully considered during the theoretical calculation.

2.1 Similarities and differences of the reaction mechanism in acid–alkaline electrolytes
The OER reaction mechanism varies in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, and depends on the pH value of the electrolyte. The similarities and differences of the OER mechanism in the acidic and alkaline electrolyte environments are well illustrated in the literature.20,21 At present, there are two generally accepted OER mechanisms in both solutions,22 namely, adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM). Taking an alkaline electrolyte as an example (Fig. 2a), the –OH species is present in abundance in the solution at the very beginning of the reaction in the case of the AEM. The –OH is then adsorbed on the surface of the active sites (metal cation), followed by desorption to form –O, following which–OH is in turn formed by the dissociation of the alkaline solution. Next, it is adsorbed along with –O to form M–OOH, after which O2 is obtained by desorption. On the other hand, the lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM) suggests that –OH is adsorbed on the lattice oxygen first, which is subsequently desorbed to form oxygen–oxygen bonds and finally desorbs to form oxygen. It is worth noting that an oxygen vacancy is formed on the transition metal in the third step. This vacancy is filled by the generated oxygen for continuous water electrolysis, allowing the entire OER reaction to proceed in a continuous sequence. These two mechanisms confirm from different perspectives that the binding strength of oxygen-containing intermediates is key to determining the Gibbs free energy, thus playing an important role in OER catalytic activity.

The reaction mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is as follows: H2O + * → OH* + H+ + e−(1.1) OH* → O* + H+ + e−(1.2) H2O (L) + 0* → OOH* + H+ + e−(1.3) OOH* → * + O2 + H+ + e−(1.4)
The OER reaction mechanism in the alkaline electrolyte was proposed by Norskovi, and is given below:23 OH− + * → OH* + e−(1.5) OH* + OH− → O* + H2O + e−(1.6) OH− + O* → OOH* + e−(1.7) OOH* + OH− → * + O2 + H2O + e−(1.8)
Thus, the OER reaction consists of four steps, “*” denotes the active site or adsorption site on the catalyst surface. In alkaline electrolytes, OH− is adsorbed on the catalyst surface (i.e., OH*), and the generated OH* continues to dissociate to form O*, H2O, and e−. According to eqn (1.7), another water molecule in the electrolyte dissociates to form OH−, H+, and e−, and OH− combines with O* enabling the formation of the peroxide radical OOH*. Next, molecular O2 is desorbed from the adsorption site on the catalyst surface, completing the whole catalytic process. However, the formation and combination methods are different in the reaction process. In acidic electrolytes, due to the presence of a large amount of H+, H2O first dissociates into H+ and OH*, and then the as-formed OH* is further dissociated into H+ and O*. The reaction of H2O and O* results in the formation of OOH*, which is further decomposed and subsequently generates O2. Therefore, the products are oxygen and water molecules in an acidic solution, and hydroxyl ions in an alkaline solution.
Given the fact that there is abundant OH− in alkaline solutions, it is easier for the catalyst to adsorb the intermediate of the OER, which is favorable for the OER. In acidic solutions, the reaction intermediate OH− is mainly generated by the cleavage of water, leading to a high overpotential than that in alkaline solutions. In acidic solutions, the pH tends to drop dramatically, resulting in high chemical aggressiveness. For LDHs, dissolution of the catalysts occurs in acid electrolytes. Therefore, LDH based catalysts show better performance and stability in alkaline electrolytes.
2.2 Overpotential
The transition of potential from one conducting phase to another usually takes place nearly entirely at the phase interface. The level of interface potential difference also affects the relative energy carrier at the two phases. Therefore, the potential controls the direction and rate of charge transfer, whose measurement and controllability are among the most important aspects in electrochemistry experiments. The ideal situation for an electrocatalytic reaction is that the applied voltage is equal to its equilibrium potential. However, in practice, the activation energy of the reaction needs to be taken into account. According to the Nernst equation,2 the corrected thermodynamic potential considering the concentration can be expressed as follows: (2.1)
There is no particular explanation for the chemical symbols, which are commonly used in the formula. It is worth mentioning that E is the actual potential, E0 is the standard potential, and CO and CR are the concentrations of the oxidizing agent and reducing agent, respectively. However, when these cells are examined with the applied potential, some reactions do not occur as thermodynamically expected. So, a very high electric potential (beyond what is expected by thermodynamics) must be applied, called overpotential (η), to make the reaction occur at a measurable rate. η = E − E0(2.2)
In a typical three-electrode measurement, the overpotential (η), which is defined as the difference between the external potential and the thermodynamic potential that transmits a specific current density, has been recognized as one of the dominating factors for evaluating the electrocatalytic activity. We will focus on the overpotential of the catalysts at current densities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 mA cm−2. The test index of 10 mA cm−2 originates from the field of artificial photosynthesis, and the indicator for developing artificial photosynthesis devices is 10% light energy to hydrogen energy conversion rate. Electrochemical water splitting is an important component of artificial photosynthesis, and the conversion rate corresponds to the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Thus, the current density of 10 mA cm−2 becomes one of the indicators to evaluate the electrochemical performance. However, it cannot fully represent the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, because it is affected by the amount of catalyst, and the macroscopic area of the electrode ignores the fact that the catalytic reaction is a surface reaction process. The reaction rate is further characterized by increasing the current intensity to, say, 20 mA cm−2. Experimentally, it was found that when the current density was less than 50 mA cm−2, the overpotential would be affected by the oxidation peak, resulting in the measured value being indeed less than the actual overpotential. Given these facts, the actual OER reaction should be measured with a current density of >50 mA cm−2. However, some catalysts have poor activity and stability at high current density >100 mA cm−2. Therefore, its catalytic activity is generally evaluated at current densities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 mA cm−2.
2.3 Tafel slope
Let us assume that the OER reactions occur at two electrode interfaces: one at the oxide/solution interface and the other at the metal/oxide interface. It is not comprehensive to evaluate the OER reaction mechanism only from the exchange current density. In light of this fact, the Tafel line is obtained by importing dZ/dJ (Z is the impedance and J is the exchange current density), and the Tafel slope is determined by extrapolation. It is noteworthy that extrapolation does not prove that true equilibrium conditions have been reached because of the high overpotential.25 Generally, the reaction rate of electrocatalysis and its rate constant are associated with the chemical potentials. In the electrocatalysis reaction, there are multiple steps in which each step reaction speed is related to its reaction potential. It also relates to the rate of electrocatalytic reaction and the conversion of intermediate species.26 The rate depends on the current and the overpotential (η), and its value is governed mainly by the transfer coefficient. Tafel slope (b) is one of the critical parameters for understanding the reaction kinetics. The rate-determining steps in the catalytic reaction with the theoretically derived Tafel slope are based on the micro-dynamic model. The calculation formula is as follows: (3.1)
In the formula, α is the transfer coefficient, a parameter denoting the symmetry of the energy barrier, and in most cases, α is a constant value. The minimum Tafel slope can be obtained when a approaches 1, indicating the fastest reaction rate and electrocatalytic kinetics. Rate-determining step (RDS) is generally defined as the slowest dynamic step due to the occurrence of O–H bond breaking towards the formation of O–O bonds, and the involvement of multiple transfers of a proton-coupled electron in the OER.27 As is well known the OER process involves four-electron steps,24 which reduction to H2O.
In alkaline media: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−(3.2)
In acidic media: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O(3.3)
Different catalysts can change the rate-determining steps in the OER four-electron process (Fig. 2b). According to this work, the Tafel slopes of 120, 60, and 40 mV dec−1 correspond to the first step (single-electron transfer), the second step (two-electron transfer), and the third step (three-electron transfer). It was reported that RDS changes from the second step to the third step in the OER process by selenization, resulting in a lower Tafel slope and improved reaction kinetics. And different Tafel slope values represent different rate-determining steps. A smaller Tafel slope, implies that the rate-determining step is at the end of the multi-electron transfer reaction, indicating that the current density increases more rapidly. It is a useful indicator to evaluate the performance of electrocatalysts.
2.4 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
Evaluation of the OER performance of the catalyst via overpotential and Tafel slope is not complete. The relationship between the catalyst structure and active center is a key point that we should be concerned and discuss in depth. Therefore, there is an urgent need to combine theoretical calculations with experimental methods to establish the relationship between the structure, reaction and mechanism.15 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation is helpful for further analysis of the OER process, understanding the Gibbs free energy and identification of active sites. Tian used first-principles density functional theory to study the active sites of NiFe LDH on the (110) crystal plane in the OER, from which the change of Gibbs free energy in the 4-step reaction was obtained.28 According to the calculated Gibbs free energy, Fe and Ni were both confirmed to be the active sites for adsorption, from which the rate determining step was also confirmed. It was concluded that Fe had better catalytic activity than Ni during the OER. In addition, density of states calculations and charge analysis were carried out to observe the change of charge number in the reaction path and valence, and it was found that more charge transfer occurred on Fe atoms. With Ni and NiCo oxides as models, Lee et al. performed DFT calculations in the case of Ni sites (coordinated by lattice oxygen atoms) for the oxygen evolution reaction.29 It was found that the theoretical overpotential of the OER was lower when Fe was combined with these oxides. These results showed that the Ni site was no longer the main active site, although it still existed there. The introduced Fe worked as a new, highly reactive surface-active site, which significantly improved the catalytic activity of the OER.
Theoretical calculations can not only disclose the understanding of the active sites in the LDH structure, but also theoretically unveil the changes of the Gibbs free energy with the intercalation as well as other modifications. Li et al. constructed a NiFe LDH structure, in which half of the iron ions were replaced by vanadium ions.30 By comparing the Gibbs free energy, the total densities of states (TDOS) and the projected densities of sates before and after vanadium doping, it is found that vanadium doping changes the electronic structure, reduces the band gap, improves the conductivity, and is beneficial for electron transfer. Thus, the enhanced OER activity can be well understood. Duan's group systematically studied different crystal faces, such as (001) and (110).31 The (110) plane, whose metal site is exposed at the top, delivers a lower OER overpotential than the (001) plane. Fig. 3a shows the schematic diagram of the OER reaction model, in which Co3+ acts as the adsorption sites. From Fig. 3c and d, it can be found that the theoretical overpotentials of the doped Co element with different valence states are 0.481 V and 0.413 V, much smaller than that of the undoped NiFe LDH (0.572 V) (Fig. 3b), confirming the fact that doping Co is a potential strategy for enhancing the intrinsic activity of NiFe LDH. Secondly, the comparison of Fig. 3c and d indicates that the doping of Co3+ is kinetically favored in theory. It is also worth mentioning that the valence states of the Co element are determined by modeling different positions and bonding modes. Zhou et al. conducted theoretical calculations of the intercalated NiFe LDHs by considering the different intercalated anions such as Cl−, ClO−, HPO32− and SO32−.32 According to the results, it was found that different anions could result in different layer spacings. On the other hand, from the calculated binding energy and Bader charge of Ni and Fe, it is found that that the addition of anions with strong reducing ability can modify the electronic structure of the surface metal and in turn significantly improve the catalytic performance of NiFe LDHs.

At present, combination of experiments with theoretical calculations is a hotspot for research, by which we can identify the active sites and better understand the internal mechanism of the OER.33 However, it is an inevitable concern whether the simple replacement element or the idealized model is consistent with the experimental results. More importantly, the experimental and test conditions cannot be well simulated in theoretical calculations. This requires us to develop new calculation methods or combine some in situ test instruments to better explore the internal reaction mechanism of catalysts by real-time detection of changes in the catalyst structure during the reaction process, as well as combining theoretical calculation values and experimental results.
2.5 
          In situ characterization techniques
Some classical characterizations, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc., can provide some basic structure and morphology information, but it is still challenging to explore the mechanism of OER activity during the reaction.33 Much effort has been made towards employing sophisticated instruments to monitor the OER process to detect the in situ electrochemical behavior of the reaction intermediates (or the actual active phase) and the surface of the electrocatalysts. For example, Dionigi et al. carried out electrochemical testing with operando wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and XAS data, as well as the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.34In situ WAXS measurements were performed in 0.1 M KOH, starting at the catalyst's resting state (1 VRHE), then increasing the applied potential to 1.7 VRHE, and finally returning to the resting state or lower potential. The (003) diffraction peak of LDH was observed. By analyzing water molecules and ions from intercalated and unintercalated phases, it was found that LDHs were oxidized from the prepared α phase to the activated γ phase in the process of the OER at the applied anode potential. The oxidative phase transitions are characterized by ∼8% contractions in both the in-plane lattice constant and the interlayer distance. Chen et al. studied the effect of Fe in NiFe layered hydroxides by operando Mössbauer spectroscopy, details of which are given in Fig. 4a and b.35 Fe-rich NiFe and Fe catalysts were prepared on carbon base electrodes and CV tests were performed prior to recording Mössbauer spectral data (Fig. 4c). Under open circuit conditions, the initial Mössbauer spectrum of the NiFe catalyst (Fig. 4d) shows a doublet, in which the isomer displacement (delta) is 0.34 mm s−1 and the quadrupole splitting (Δ) is 0.46 mm s−1. No change in the spectrum was observed upon applying a potential of 1.49 V (Fig. 4e), which was at the end of Ni ions conversion from 2+ to 3+ reaction, just below the onset of the catalytic activity. When the spectrum was recorded in a region with significant OER reaction (1.62 V applied potential), the shoulder appeared at δ = −0.27 mm s−1, indicating oxidation at about 12% of the Fe sites in the material (Fig. 4f). The potential was further increased to 1.76 V, resulting in the generation of an oxidized Fe peak, which accounted for about 21% of the total Fe (Fig. 4g). When the potential was restored to 1.49 V, the current dropped to the baseline level previously observed at 1.49 V, but the peak of oxidized Fe was still evident in the Mössbauer spectrum (20% of total Fe, Fig. 4h). In case no applied potential is given, the oxidation Fe peak no longer exists after the sample is kept for 48 h (Fig. 4i). According to operando Mössbauer spectroscopy, Fe4+ is formed in the NiFe oxide catalyst during the steady catalytic process, which should be due to the stabilizing effect of the NiOOH lattice. For future investigation on OER mechanisms, the possibility of four oxidation states of iron in these catalysts should be considered.

In order to track the product formed in the OER reaction (O2 release) and the distribution of Faraday charge in the redox process of the catalyst, Gorlin et al. used differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), combined with quasi-in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemical methods to investigate the electrocatalytic behvior.36 Compared with the unsupported reference catalyst at pH > 13, the supported catalyst shows a large cathodic shift in the pre-catalytic potential range before the OER starts. The UV-Vis data also confirmed this finding, indicating that with the increase of pH, the Ni oxide species showed more cathodic displacement. Both the pH of the carrier and the electrolyte had a strong enhancing effect on the catalytic activity of the OER. At a high pH value, more cathodes will release O2 and the cathodes will be more easily oxidized. This study provides a new insight into the catalytic kinetics of alkaline OER catalysts and the redox chemistry of related catalysts. Yoshida et al. proposed in situ XAFS and UV/Vis spectroscopy to study the electrochromic transition process.37 The transformation of the average valence state can be observed in the XAFS spectrum, and the peak emergence and absorption capacity at the corresponding potential can be understood in the in situ UV/VIS absorption measurement. The results can be applied to further study the photocatalytic mechanism in the future. In addition, Schorr et al. introduced spatiotemporal correlation Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to study the effects of structural heterogeneity, interfacial decomposition products and layer number on the electron transfer of the catalyst.38 Raman-SECM allows us to analyze the contribution of redox responses to different structural effects in the same place and time, especially during the process of delamination, defect generation, and surface film formation. Besides, it also provides a powerful surface analysis method for elucidating the interface properties related to energy, catalysis and sensing.
In conclusion, by performing in situ characterizations we can gain insights into the activity mechanism of LDHs in the OER by monitoring the change of intermediates and metal valance. It is important to identify the active site of the OER in order to reveal the mechanism of the OER. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and other technologies have been developed and reported in the literature.39 However, no scientific consensus has been reached on the active phase and active site of specific LDHs in the OER by the above methods so far. In addition, different characterization methods have different cell configurations, so there is no technology that can capture the full observation of phase transitions, valence changes, and configuration changes. Thus, it is highly desirable for the future development of new in situ techniques to monitor the reaction process of catalysts and to understand the OER reaction mechanism of LDHs by combining multiple characterization techniques and comparing the reaction morphologies of various types of catalysts.
3. Tailoring the structure and tuning the functionalities of LDHs
LDH has wide applications and is as a star of two-dimensional materials; however, it has drawbacks of low electrical conductivity and structural collapse over time. To solve these problems, adjusting the local coordination environment, defect engineering and heteroatom-doping could effectively expose more active sites, subsequently improving the conductivity and promoting the intrinsic activity of LDH-based catalysts. Herein, we will introduce some ways for tailoring the structure and tuning the functionalities of LDHs: (1) modification of the structure by exfoliation and defect engineering of LDH can improve its overall performance as significantly more active sites are exposed and the specific surface areas are enlarged; (2) structural design of LDH by elemental doping and anion exchange alters its electronic structures and promotes the formation of the corresponding reaction intermediates during the OER; (3) LDHs can be obtained from MOFs by etching, inheriting the unique hollow architecture. Thus, tailoring the structure or tuning the functionalities of LDHs provides increased active surface area and accelerated electron transfer, leading to advance OER activity.
3.1 Exfoliation
The primary objective of structure design is to expose and utilize the active sites of the catalyst. For layered materials such as LDHs, the preparation of several-layer or even monolayer LDHs is an essential task for layer modification/engineering. The active sites in LDHs can fully be exposed, and their catalytic performance can be improved. Chen described an OER activation mechanism in NiFe LDH as proton receptors diffuse between layers,40 leading to the dissolution of catalysts. To promote the diffusion of proton receptors, multi-layer NiFe LDH was exfoliated and transformed into atomically thick nanocrystals, which also improves its catalytic stability. Zhao et al. reported the synthesis of ultrathin NiFe LDH nanometer sheets (the synthesis process is shown in Fig. 5a), in which metal species (Ni2+ and Fe3+) are present in abundance, together with numerous oxygen vacancies. The as-prepared ultrathin nanometer sheets show semi-metallic conductivity.41 To reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the required overpotential is 254 mV and the Tafel slope is 32 mV dec−1. Song et al. reported significant improvement of the catalytic activity using single layer LDHs.42 However, agglomeration decreases the active sites and hence reduces the stability of catalysts. With ultrasound treatment, Munonde et al. exfoliated the NiFe LDH/CB into single/several layer-structured sheets.43 The ultrathin nature and lamellar morphology as well as comparison with the parent LDH could be discerned in Fig. 5b–d. The smaller overpotential and Tafel slope (Fig. 5e and f) indicate that the OER activity is boosted. The ultrasonic approach provides an effective means of green exfoliation of layered materials. Jia et al. successfully synthesized ultrathin ZnCo LDH nanometer sheets with a linear dimension of approximately 3.5 nm on a side and a total thickness of 0.5 nm.44 It had abundant oxygen vacancies and unsaturated coordination centers, and exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic water oxidation. Gao et al. used a coprecipitation method to obtain an LDH block structure and used dialysis (8 kDa) to remove formamide to obtain LDH nanosheets.45 The ultrathin monolayer LDH nanosheets show better OER activity compared to the precursors by introducing more active sites, and the value of CdI also increased. DFT calculations, which provide a better understanding of the electronic structure and spin polarization, confirm that Co and Fe-based LDHs can enhance the conductivity. Zhou et al. prepared DH-CoFe LDHs with defects and a hierarchical structure by reducing with ethylene glycol, in which the concentration of ethylene glycol could change the thickness and size of LDHs.46 Smaller size leads to more dangling bonds and oxygen vacancies, changing the electron density of adjacent metal atoms, facilitating ion diffusion and charge transfer, and improving the catalytic performance.

Besides, plasma treatment has the advantages of fast, simple, convenient, clean, and low-cost chemical processing. Exfoliation of LDHs can be achieved through plasma treatment,47 where the material surface becomes rougher, increasing the specific surface area and benefiting the adsorption of oxygen-generated species during the catalytic process. For example, Wang et al. achieved dry exfoliation of CoFe LDH powders by acid etching and using Ar plasma;48 O, Co, and Fe vacancies by doping and etching were also produced at the same time. Liu et al. used H2O plasma to achieve wet exfoliation and etching of CoFe LDHs.49 Chen et al. carried out nitrogen doping in NiCo LDHs with N2/Ar plasma,50 providing a profound perspective on the applications of LDHs in catalysis and energy storage.
3.2 Defects
Defect introduction is a powerful tool to adjust the physical and chemical properties of LDHs due to the modification of active sites and the improved electrical conductivity owing to the presence of metal and oxygen vacancies (achieved by etching ions or doping). Recently, Xiong et al. designed a unique NiFe LDH nanoarray on electrodes by modulating the electronic structure.51 By combining theoretical calculations, they found that the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 6a) may result in a lower Gibbs free energy and valence state, and a narrower bandgap (Fig. 6b and c). These observations suggest that the electrons are easily excited into the conduction bands, thereby reducing the overpotential and improving the OER efficiency. Li et al. generated oxygen vacancies in FeNi LDH/NF by the uptake and release of sodium ions.52 With increasing Na content in the reaction solution, the oxygen vacancy on the surface of FeNi LDH changes accordingly. The oxygen vacancy on FeNi LDH/NF enhances electron transport capacity, electrolyte wettability, wettability between active centers and the electrolyte, and the absorption/activation capacity of H2O.

(b) Free energy plots and (c) charge density analysis on P–NiFe LDH and R–NiFe LDH for the OER51 (Copyright@2018, Springer Nature). 
Yuan et al. reported the design of an NiFe LDH based on multiple vacancies that use the memory effect of LDH combined with O, Ni, and Fe vacancies.53 The technique produces a lower overpotential due to the improved conductivity, larger electrochemical specific surface area, and faster charge transfer. The NiFe LDH-VNi and NiFe LDH-VFe electrocatalysts synthesized by Wang exhibited good electrocatalytic performance, mainly attributed to the effective regulation of surface electronic structures by introducing iron/nickel rich vacancies into NiFe LDH nanocrystals.54 Achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and potentials of 245 and 229 mV, Chen and co-workers synthesized oxygen-rich vacancies in NiFe LDHs by the H2O plasma method. As expected, the OER activity was enhanced compared with the bare NiFe LDHs (the one that did not undergo the plasma treatment).50
At present, many studies are using liquid phase etching to create defects. Some examples include: (1) the preparation of LDH as a precursor dispersed in a specific solution; (2) the removal of metal ions that are soluble in acidic or alkaline media under mild conditions to form defect sites on the exposed surfaces. Introduction of vacancies enables engineering of the local chemical coordination and surface valence of the catalyst. The electronic structure is also effectively modified to lower the activation energy and Gibbs free energy of the reaction, enhancing the catalytic activity. For example, elements soluble in alkaline solutions (e.g., Zn and Al) may be introduced into the LDH laminate and they dissolve in the alkaline solution to produce a vacancy site in the LDH.55 Xiong et al. found that the activity of the coupling site of Ni–O–Fe with unsaturated coordination was improved compared with that of Ni–O–Ni.51 Zhang et al. introduced abundant pores into single-layer NiFe-LDH nanosheets by a simple one-step co-precipitation strategy, resulting in a high concentration of oxygen and cationic vacancy in PM-LDH nanosheets and a synergistic effect.56 Through theoretical calculation, it was concluded that the abundant oxygen and metal vacancies are beneficial to the adsorption of reactants, improving the electrical conductivity of LDH nanosheets, and enhancing the adsorption and binding of OH* intermediates formed in the OER process. Thus, PM-LDH shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance.
Meanwhile, the introduction of defects in nanomaterials remains an effective method to improve the performance of catalysts. Some mechanical defects produced by the previous techniques are prone to structural collapse. However, recent studies have shown that ionic reductive complexation extraction (IRCE) methods can create atomic vacancies without destroying the local structure. One survey by Xie used IRCE to produce defects without damaging the system of nanomaterials.57 In order to make the selective extraction of Cu in the NiCu LDH, Na2SO3 was added in the complexation solution to only reduce the Cu(II) to Cu(I), and keep the Ni(II) ions have no change. The process yields an electrocatalyst as a result of the rich defects and the formation of metallic defect sites that further regulate the electronic structure and surface desorption properties of the catalyst to the reactant/intermediate. These additionally reduce the impedance of charge conduction as well as enhance the OER performance under alkaline conditions.
From Table 1, it can be clearly seen that exfoliation of LDH and introduction of defects can promote the electrocatalytic performance. On one hand, the ultra-thin LDH enlarges the specific surface area, increases the number of active centers and speeds up the mass transfer process. On the other hand, the introduced defects make the edges and corners of the catalyst more active than in the original LDH. At present, the methods of exfoliation mainly focus on ultrasonic exfoliating and organic solution exfoliating, and there are some research studies on electrochemical exfoliation. However, how to make the exfoliation of block LDH uniform with a simpler, faster and green method is still worth studying in the future. In the table, by comparison, we find that the introduction of different defects and vacancies can greatly reduce the overpotential, and a smaller Tafel slope makes it more likely to happen kinetically. We support the introduction of certain defects into LDHs, but the key lies in controlling the defects, so as to maximize the role of the defects. Meanwhile, the influence of defects on the electronic structure of LDHs also requires a deeper understanding and research.

3.3 Cationic doping
The chemical properties of LDHs can be altered by changing the types of metal cations, adjusting the corresponding proportion of different elements, or adding layers according to the functional requirements of the material.62 As an example, Song et al. compared the OER catalytic activities of CoCo LDHs, NiCo LDHs, and NiFe LDHs (Fig. 7a) and found that NiFe LDHs deliver the best performance.42 ZnCo LDHs were prepared by Zou from the MO6 octahedral structure of polymetallic oxalates.63 They found that Co3O4 and Co–OH show decent OER catalytic activity, while ZnO and Zn–OH did not, and confirmed that the Zn cation was the active site for the OER. Friebel et al. performed an in situ XAS to reveal that Fe3+ exhibited an unusually short iron–oxygen bond in the octahedral Ni1−xFexOOH complex.64 Zhang et al. used cobalt–nickel hydroxide as the precursor and iodine as the oxidant to transform a fraction of the Co2+ metal to Co3+.65 They found that the oxidation of Co cations and the creation of impressive lamellar structures enhance the catalytic activity of CoNi LDHs.

By employing a third metal element it is possible to produce lattice distortion and defects and introduce more active sites.66 At the same time, the tri-metal complex reduces the free energy and lowers the overpotential. Liu et al. added Al3+ to NiFe LDHs and subsequently obtained ternary NiFeAl LDHs, delivering improved OER performance compared to the parent binary complex.67 Also, as shown in Fig. 7b, Al3+ can be dissolved in alkaline media forming defects partially, which further enhances the catalytic activity as well as the electrical conductivity (Fig. 7c and d). By a close examination of the OER mechanism in these materials, Liu et al. concluded that adding an oxidant increases the content of metal cations in high oxidation states and increases the active metal valence of the catalyst. NiCo LDH was directly grown on carbon cloth by a hydrothermal method. By adding a third metal cation, Al, Gao et al. found that the stoichiometric ratio in the appropriate range favors the nanosheet growth, and its function was to stabilize the LDH structure and improve its cycling stability.68 Han et al. reported a Zn doped FeCo LDH by a developed in situ method, showing a distinctive needle-like nanostructure with a partial amorphous phase.69 The activity and durability of electrocatalysts were significantly improved by adjusting their crystal structure and morphology. Materials with low crystallinity, disordered structure and well-defined morphology have the unique advantages of disordered long-range and isotropic properties. The unique 1D nanoarray morphology increases the specific surface area, promotes rapid bubble detachment, and subsequently facilitates the OER response.
Doping small amount of precious metals and rare earth metals (like Ce, Au, Ru, Pt) in LDHs modifies the surface electron structure and significantly enhances the catalytic activity and stability.70–73 Zhu et al. introduced the electronegative noble metal Au in an LDH array by a simple hydrothermal method and chemical deposition.74 NiFe LDH@Au/NF has a three-dimensional smooth morphology with large holes, and hence improved conductivity and active specific surface area. The incorporation of Au promotes the formation of Ni3+ to a certain extent, which formed NiOOH intermediates that can serve as the active center for the OER, enabling remarkable OER activities. Xie et al. synthesized Cr/NiFe LDH using a ligand-assisted capping growth method (LACGA). In NiFe LDH, doping with atomically dispersed Cr atoms can synchronously modify the electronic structure, improve the intrinsic catalytic activity, narrow the bandgap, and increase the conductivity of the catalyst.75 Zhou et al. introduced Mn2+ with relatively weak electronegativity to modify the cations' electronic structure in the LDH laminates.76 The electron transfer from Mn2+ with strong reduction ability to the surrounding Ni2+ and Fe3+ of the LDH, leading to the electric transfer of Ni2+ and Fe3+ to form an electronic-rich structure conducive to the protonation step and significantly improves its OER performance. Li et al. doped V into NiFe LDH laminate to form ternary NiFeV LDHs,30 the purpose of which was to regulate the energy band of the catalyst, thus reducing the catalyst overpotential. Because of the doping, the original electronic structure is changed. The bandgap became narrow, which improved the electrical conductivity, accelerated the electron transfer, and promoted active medium formation enabling highly catalytic activity. Zhang et al. preliminarily grew fluorine-containing NiFe hydroxide (NiFe–OH–F) nanosheet arrays on NF by a one-step hydrothermal method.77 The OER occurs when surface self-reconstruction takes place due to fluoride leaching, which converts surface LDH into mesoporous and amorphous NiFe oxide hierarchical structures. This work provides a new path for surface self-reconstruction by in situ synthesis and significantly improves the catalytic performance.
3.4 Anion intercalation
Interlaminar anions have a weak electrostatic force; nonetheless, a network of weak hydrogen bonds enables exchange of ions in solution and formation of new anion interlayer structures because of the expanded layer spacings. Nejati et al. synthesized ZnFe–VO4-LDH and ZnFe–MoO4-LDH electrocatalysts with different intercalations by a hydrothermal method and obtained splendid OER activity.12 Xie et al. fabricated a molybdate intercalated NiFe LDH and used it as the precursor for reducing Mo and in situ localized synthesis of a molybdate modified nickel-iron alloy for catalytic water oxidation.78 Their results showed that the presence of MoO42− results in the retention of the original precursor structure, with a concurrent increase in the number of active sites, and increased conductivity, all of which lead to the outstanding OER performance of NiFe–MoOx-NS. Zhou et al. studied 16 different intercalations of NiFe LDHs and found that anionic intercalates with varying redox potentials gave rise to different degrees of OER activity (Fig. 8a and b).79 The results showed that the insertion of hypophosphate with high reducing capacity yielded higher OER activity. Theoretical calculations (Fig. 8c and d) and experimental characterizations show that the inserted anions alter the electronic structure of the exposed metal atoms, increase the electron density of surface metal sites, and stabilize the high-order states. Morales intercalated the NiFe LDH layer with tetrasulfonate phthalocyanine containing Co or Ni and performed liquid phase exudation to conjugate the LDH to graphene lamellar metal cations and interlamellar anions contribute to the overall electrocatalytic performance.80 Alibakhshi et al. synthesized LDHs by a hydrothermal method, in which the CO32− anions were eliminated. The PO43− intercalated ZnAl LDH was prepared by a coprecipitation method.81 The crystallinity of LDH decreased significantly after phosphate exchange, which provides a new experimental scheme for LDH intercalation. Muller et al. studied the intercalation of NO3−, BF4−, Cl−, ClO4−, CO32−, C2O32−, F−, I−, PO43− and SO42− anions on NiFe LDHs and found that their measured catalytic activity could be used to establish a functional relationship with the alkalinity of anions.82

Compared to inorganic acid anion intercalation, the process of organic acid anion and multi-acid anion intercalation in LDH layers is complicated. However, the extra complexity does indeed improve the performance. Ultrathin MgAl LDH nanometer tablets (DI-LDH Ns) intercalated with dodecyl sulfate were prepared by Lei using a surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method.83 Zhang and collaborators systematically summarized and combined the anion regulation of LDH based materials. It was concluded that the intrinsic activity of the metal cation active center can be improved by adjusting the adjacent anions.84 Owing to the difference of adjacent anions, the electronic structure of metal on the laminate is influenced, intermediates and products is strengthened or weakened, which shows the change of OER activity. The mechanism of anion regulation was explained in detail as well. Harada et al. designed a ZnAl LDH by a coprecipitation process and obtained an LDH structure by the anion exchange method with lauric acid treatment.85 When a new-round intercalation was conducted, the LDH continuously swelled, leading to the laminates accumulation and subsequent fracture, introducing a large number of defects. Abellan et al. synthesized alcohol salt intercalated CoFe LDHs using methanol and showed superior O2 generation.86 Li developed in situ formamide intercalated NiFe LDHs by unipolar pulsed electrodeposition,87 presenting advanced activity even comparable to the state-of-the-art RuO2. Waghmode et al. synthesized a NiCo LDH on carbon materials which is intercalated with an unbonded calixarene.88 Coprecipitation and anion intercalation increase the active surface area of the LDH. The results also show that using CNO as a carrier could enhance the electrical conductivity. Anionic intercalation can produce a large active surface area and enhance rapid electron transfer, which in turn increases the electrocatalytic activity of LDHs.
One method worth mentioning is the flash nano-precipitation (FNP) method. It is a micro-mixed synthesis process capable of rapidly mixing two or more solutions in significantly reduced material preparation time. The entire preparation process can be completed in a few seconds and operated as a continuous batch process. Compared with the traditional intermittent co-precipitation method (Fig. 9a),89 they have similar morphology and size (Fig. 9b and c). Thus, the FNP method is recognized as a rapid preparation approach of the catalysts, which allows the synthesis of catalyst materials with defects towards improving their performance (Fig. 9d and e). In recent years, using the FNP method, the Yu research group synthesized NiFe LDH with tungstate anion intercalation. It was found that the morphology and structure of the material were modified to provide more marginal active sites with superior electrocatalytic properties.90 The FNP method could also achieve a certain degree of spatial separation of active sites for nucleation and growth. This process is simple, efficient, and can be extended to provide a new path for producing metal-based electrocatalyst materials.

Table 2 shows the performance summary of Ni-LDH after doping and intercalation. It can be concluded that the catalytic activity of the OER is significantly improved after doping. We attributed this to the following factors: (1) enhanced electron transfer and effective regulation of the electronic structure, (2) improved electrical conductivity, (3) doped ion can dissolve in the electrolyte, leading to the formation of defects in the catalytic process enabling further improvement of the catalytic activity, (4) the doped atom itself can be used as an active center to improve the intrinsic activity of LDHs. After intercalation of the LDHs, it was found that the intercalation of different anions expands the interlamellar distance, which was beneficial to ion diffusion and enlargement of the specific surface area. Apart from that, the intercalated anions can regulate the electronic structure of the active center on the laminate and promote the catalytic activity effectively. Thus, these two methods are very effective for improving the activity of LDHs. Cationic doping seems to have a smaller overpotential and a lower Tafel slope, and is kinetically more favored. However, different elements could be doped and intercalated, for which we have to seriously consider how they will exist and connect in the structure of the LDH. With these points in mind, further exploration is needed to conclude whether doping methods and testing procedures have an impact on the existence of doping elements.

3.5 MOF derived structures
Metallic organic framework materials (MOFs) are porous structured materials that are self-assembled by coordination between organic ligands and metal ions and have adjustable pores and abundant unsaturated active sites. One kind of LDH can be obtained by etching the MOFs. This unique morphology is conducive to exposing numerous active sites and could significantly enhance the catalytic activity. By using acid etching, Zhou et al. obtained LDHs from ZIF-67 nanocubes,94 and prepared Pd/NiCo LDH via an in situ reduction deposition strategy (Fig. 10a). The TEM image reveals that it is a hollow cube composed of LDHs, which allows electronic coupling between the transition metal elements via an oxygen bridge (Fig. 10b), implying that the electronic structure is tunable. Because of the advanced architecture and electronic coupling between the transition metal elements, excellent catalytic performance was achieved. It provides a design strategy for the sustainable development of green energy. Kong et al. also prepared a graded Fe-LDH(FeCo)/Co(OH)2 nanostructure on ZIF-67 on carbon cloth by electrodeposition and ion exchange methods.95 The hierarchical structure facilitates the transformation of intermediates, which is beneficial for boosting OER kinetics. FeCo alloys facilitate electron transfer over CoOOH related newly formed interfaces, thereby improving OER durability. He et al. also synthesized ZIF-67 nanocubes by a surfactant-mediated method and carried out the Ni(NO3)2 reaction at room temperature. The formed NiCo LDHs were finally phosphated.96 The size of the nanocube was about 750 nm, and it had high uniformity. The porous NiCoP/C nanocubes can open up more active sites. The hollow structure with a high specific surface area enables a highly efficient electrochemical reaction. The materials' synergistic action contributes to the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity, in which the carbon significantly improves the charge transfer efficiency and conductivity. Huo et al. used in situ pseudomorphic semi-transformation to obtain ultrathin, hollow, hierarchical FeNi LDH nanoparticles with a thickness of about 5 nm, derived from the FeNi-MOF-74 precursor, which were tightly anchored and vertically inserted into the FeNi MOF skeleton.97 As a result, abundant metal active centers, and expanded electron transport channels were obtained, and FeNi LDH/MOF showed significant electrochemical activity, which provides a solid step for extending the application of MOFs and designing LDHs with new morphologies.

Li et al. successfully fabricated Co-based selenides using MOFs as the raw material.98 Fractional hollow (Co,Ni)Se2@NiFe LDH nanocages were synthesized and they delivered excellent OER performance, which was attributed to the superb adsorption/desorption properties of Fe and Ni/Co to oxygen-generated species. Analysis of the electronic interactions on the interface with the proposed Ni–O–Co–O–Fe–O–Ni model suggests that the interaction between Ni2+ and the bridging O2− was electron–electron repulsion, while some of the electrons were spontaneously transferred from Ni2+ to Co2+ (Fig. 10b). Better redistribution of electron symmetry among Ni, Co, and Fe can be achieved locally, which is beneficial to the adsorption/desorption of oxygen species. Effective electrocatalysts can also be obtained by coupling MOFs (Fig. 10c and d). For example, Xu et al. directly grew CoNiAl-LDH on NF by a hydrothermal method and coupling it with ZIF-67, resulting in the formation of a three-dimensional porous hierarchical structure, ZIF-67/CoNiAl-LDH/NF.99 The hybrid ZIF-67/CoNiAl-LDH increases the electrochemically active area and shows good electrocatalytic activity. Ping et al. prepared layered NiCo MOF/LDH on NF, in which NF serves both as the nickel source and the substrate for the NiCo LDH. Besides, NiCo LDH can also be grown with specific metal sources and/or from sacrificial templates such as MOFs.100 The open structure together with the synergistic effect between the two components of the composites contributes to the high catalytic activity.
3.6 Special hollow nanostructures
The hydrothermal/solvothermal reaction is generally used to obtain specifically designed nanoarchitecture. It is a standard method for the preparation of LDHs in aqueous solvents and fluids within a specific temperature and pressure range. Guo et al. reported a core–shell structure with Co3O4 nanowire arrays as cores and ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) as shells, i.e., Co3O4@NiFe LDHs.101 It was found that the processing time is a vital factor for the growth of NiFe LDH shells in achieving an optimal electronic structure through modulation of interfacial cation valences. Zhong et al. adjusted the ammonium fluoride concentration and reaction time, and finally obtained 3D flower-shaped hierarchical NiFe-LDH hollow microspheres (3D NiFe-LDH HMS).102 This demonstrates the self-transformation of a layered hollow structure induced by a template-free hydrothermal treatment, which could accelerate the electron transport. With the increase of NH4F concentration, NiFe LDH sample grains were obtained and finally began to aggregate.
Compared to the hydrothermal method, the template method is an enhanced chemical process as well, in which the sacrificial template is etched resulting in the specific hollow morphology for shell formation. Yu et al. prepared a layered hollow nanometer prism composed of ultrathin NiFe LDH sheets using the square (012) phase of the nickel prism as a self-sacrificial template (Fig. 11a).103 The SEM image shows that NiFe LDH has a large specific surface area (Fig. 11b and c) inherited from the self-sacrificial template. Due to the synergistic effect between nickel and iron, it exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity, i.e., lower overpotential (Fig. 11d and e), smaller Tafel slope, and much better stability compared with the NiFe LDH nanoclusters.

(e) η at 10 mA cm−2 for the NiFe LDH hollow prisms and control samples103 (Copyright@2018, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.KGaA, Weinheim). 
By using a hard-template Bai et al. constructed hollow CoCo LDH nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets using the sacrificial template method. The detailed morphology of the CoCo LDH/graphene composite material was investigated using TEM.104 The hollow structural feature was confirmed from the strong image contrast between the purported shell and the inner cavity. Sun et al. also used the self-template strategy to prepare layered hollow NiCo LDH nanopolyhedra with adjustable components and nanostructures. Theoretical calculation confirms that Co3+ has the lowest free energy in the OER response, indicating the high activity, and is the adsorption and activity center.105 A uniformly dispersed amorphous Cu–NiFe LDH was synthesized by Cai using a photoetching method. The precursor is a core–shell structure, and the hollow structure is obtained by etching Cu2O.106 Due to the high electronegativity of Fe3+/Cu2+, partial charge transfer exists between Ni and Fe/Cu, and the active sites of Ni become more positive and highly attractive to OH− species, which is conducive to promoting the catalytic activity. Wang et al. used the Cu2O nanocrystals as sacrificial templates to form the hydroxide by two-step method, through a two-step synthesis consisting of etching and coprecipitation under the action of NiZn double hydroxide nanocages.107 It is worth mentioning that the presence of Zn in the product can significantly improve its catalytic performance owing to the bimetallic coordination effect. NiFe LDH was grown in situ using SiO2 as a template.108 Finally, a hollow spherical LDH structure with a shell thickness of 50 nm was obtained by etching the Si template. It is found that NiFe-LDH HMS has a high specific surface area, mesoporous structure, and excellent hydrophilicity, leading to effective active centers for the OER reaction and rapid gas release. More new ideas are required for designing hollow microsphere structures toward advance OER activities.
Morphology regulation is one way of increasing the active surface area. We focused on the preparation of LDH derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs have the merits of high specific surface area, high crystallinity, rich functional groups and special structural stability, providing carbon, nitrogen and metal sources at the same time. LDHs prepared from MOF precursors can inherit most of the above-mentioned advantages. By comparison with the precursor and the intrinsic LDH (Table 3), the catalytic activity of LDH is even better, indicating the potential production of LDH from the parent MOFs. On the other hand, the hollow structure generally possesses large specific surface area, exposing numerous active sites, facilitating the adsorption of the active intermediate, subsequently speeding up the OER. Thus, the preparation of LDH from MOFs is highly desirable. Also, we anticipate that special structures for other hollow precursors via simple, continuous and controllable synthesis processes are possible, which need to be explored in the future.

4. LDH derivatives
In addition to tuning the functionalities of LDHs, chemisorption, promoting interactions with reactants and optimizing the electrical conductivity have also attracted intense attention. It was reported that with chemisorption treatment, transition metal oxides, nitrides, phosphates, and other compounds have shown remarkable catalytic activities for the OER.14,16 It is noteworthy that the unique layered structure of hydrotalcite can not only work as the precursor, but also serve as a complementary structure. Because of the uniform dispersion of metal ions in the laminated LDHs and their unique layered structure, the compounds obtained from these processes are homogeneous. Compared with hydroxides, LDH derivatives can be used in a broad pH range and have extensive applications. The appropriate addition of polarized anions (sulfurization, nitridation, etc.) can optimize the electronic structure of the active center, adjust the ion valence states of the original LDH, and promote the adsorption of reactants, electron transfer and desorption of products. It has been proved that oxidation, nitridation and phosphorus vulcanization are effective methods to regulate the electronic properties and increase the active centers.
4.1 Oxides
After calcination, LDHs form dispersed, layered bimetallic oxides (LDOs) in the nanometer range, which are useful catalysts and carriers. The anions between layers will be lost during the calcination process. Interestingly, it was found that the LDO can be reconstructed and restored to a layered structure after immersion in an anion solution. Therefore, LDOs can also be used as adsorption materials for storing and releasing functional anions. In recent years, Chakrapani et al. synthesized Co2−xNixGa LDHs by constant pH co-precipitation and found that this oxide was more active delivering better catalytic activity when calcined.111 Zhao et al. prepared 2D MnAl LDO using the flash nanometer precipitation method.89 After the precursor LDH was calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h, the lattice oxygen content increased, resulting in improved catalyst surface oxidation capacity. Xie et al. synthesized MoO42− intercalated NiFe LDHs in nanometer sheets through a hydrothermal reaction, and then calcined them at 500 °C in an Ar/H2 atmosphere for 2 hours to obtain the NiFe MoOx NS reduction product (Fig. 12a).78 From Fig. 12b and c, it can be seen that the as-formed LDOs maintained the layered structure of LDHs. In an alkaline electrolyte, the overpotential was 276 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the Tafel slope was 56 mV dec−1 (Fig. 12d and e). Again, using the hydrothermal method, Miao et al. synthesized layered catalyst materials of Ni and Fe in the ratio of 3:1.112 After roasting NiFe LDH at 600 °C in nitrogen, the generated oxide exhibited high conductivity. As anticipated, this led to enhanced catalytic activity. In an alkaline electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential was 270 mV, and the Tafel slope was 32.8 mV dec−1.

Wang et al. prepared a three-dimensional self-supporting NiFe LDH/CeOx electrode with abundant oxygen vacancies by the electrodeposition of CeOx nanoparticles on NiFe LDH nanosheets.113 Theoretical and experimental results show positive charge accumulation between the LDH and metal-oxide interface. Oxygen vacancy can be successfully introduced into the interface and it causes local electron potential difference. It accelerates the electron transfer rate and increases the electrochemical activity. Shi et al. used ZIF-67 as a template and fabricated LDHs by first refluxing followed by oxidation (by calcination).114 The hollow structure could provide abundant mass transfer channels and increase the contact area between the material and electrolyte. Also, the NiFe–NiCoO2 oxide possessed significant electrochemical durability. Fan et al. designed a WO3/α-Fe2O3 core–shell heterojunction composite electrode, which was electrodeposited with NiFe LDH.115 The electrode has a small initial potential and good stability which is beneficial to the electron flow and a unique large surface area. Sirisomboonchai et al. prepared NiO/C@NiFe LDH by calcination and hydrothermal synthesis methods. NiO/C was obtained by the calcination of Ni-MOFs, which not only provided a porous structure and conductive carbon material support for the NiFe LDH, but also an excellent active center to facilitate the reaction.116 They adopted the hydrothermal method to first grow NiO directly on NF and then calcinate it at 450 °C for 2 h. The obtained oxide is transferred to the hydrothermal composite NiFe LDH to obtain the mixed oxide NiO@NiFe LDH. In particular, further ultrasonic treatment (NiO@NiFe-LDH/NF-US) in organic solutions is performed to provide sufficient diffusion channels for ion transport. The exceptional 3D nanostructure and the effect of composite oxides enable the material to exhibit excellent OER performance. Zhang et al. prepared NiFe LDH by the coprecipitation method and calcined it in a muffle furnace at different temperatures.117 The major products after calcination, NiO, FeOx, and NiFe2O4, evidenced that the ionic activity increased with increase in temperature, and NiFe LDH collapsed after the heat treatment. The OER activity of nickel oxide formed was lower than that of the NiFe LDH material but higher than that of NiFe2O4 spinel (600 °C).
4.2 Sulfur
Sulfur is one of the most important components of catalysts because of its unique electrochemical properties, rich valence states, and long-term stability in acidic medium. Chen et al. effectively combined NiCo LDHs and ZIF-67, allowing subsequent oxidation (Fig. 13a and b), sulfuration (Fig. 13c and d), carbonization (Fig. 13e and f) and selenization (Fig. 13g and h).118 They found that the NiCo LDH@Co MOFs-S (NCO@COS) after sulfuration exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance compared with the control samples (Fig. 13i and g). A low voltage of 1.54 V was required for driving a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The electrocatalyst also showed good electrocatalytic stability and overall good water splitting efficiency. Fan et al. first prepared 3D hydrangea-like microspheres composed of NiV LDHs on NiCo foam (NCF), and then obtained Ni8V2(Mo3S4)11/NCF by ion exchange with (MoS4)2−.119 Thanks to the large surface area, low adsorption free energy value and fast electron transportability of its unique structure, catalytic potential on a bifunctional sulfur compound-based catalyst in alkaline media was achieved. Zou et al. hydrothermally grew NiFe LDH on carbon microtubes and obtained NiFe LDH/(NiFe)Sx/CMT complex sulfide by the ion-exchange method.120 The layered structure formed by the micro-CMT hollow tube is vertically inserted into NiFe LDH nanoparticles and then vulcanized into (NiFe)Sx nanoparticles. The hierarchy creates an integrated electrocatalytic system with an effective electron transfer process, and the superior conductivity of CMT substrates extracted from biomass is of great significance for achieving rapid charge transfer.

Cao et al. prepared S–NiCoFe LDH with 3D porous sulfur doping on carbon cloth.121 The improvement of its electrocatalytic activity was attributed to its unique 3D-structure (Fig. 14a and b) and sulfur doping (Fig. 14c), which produced active centers and high electrical conductivity. In an alkaline electrolyte with a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential was 206 mV, and the Tafel slope was calculated to be 46 mV dec−1 (Fig. 14d and e). Li et al. studied the OER activity of NiFe-LDHs by taking into account the doping amount of S as a variable, by which the best performance was achieved when the S content was 0.43 at%.122 The enhancement is attributed to the synergistic effect between S and Fe sites, which lowers the reaction energy barrier and promotes OER kinetics. Zeng et al. etched and sulfurated CoAl LDH obtaining PA-CoSx(OH)y at room temperature.123 The pores formed by corrosion were evenly distributed on the nanosheets, and the relative amount of micropores and mesopores significantly increased the surface area. By impregnating the cobalt-based hydroxide precursor with a solution containing a high concentration of S2−, Wang et al. achieved the conversion of the transition metal hydroxide to hydroxyl sulfide at room temperature, thus preserving its original good morphology.124 The as-prepared catalysts displayed high intrinsic reactivity and electrical conductivity. This work provides a very simple but effective way to vulcanize metal hydroxyl compounds and effectively adjust their structure for zinc empty cells.

Furthermore, the synergistic effect and oxygen vacancy between S and OH groups can regulate the electronic structure, thus producing excellent catalytic activity and stability. Liu et al. prepared (NiFe)S2-GN by placing the NiFe LDH-GO composite material in a tubular furnace and heating the vessel containing 0.5 g sulfur powder in an Ar atmosphere at 400 °C for 80 min and kept for 1 h.125 Due to the appropriate density distribution and lattice doping of (NiFe)S2 nanoparticles on GO, the electronic structure is regulated, thus effectively improving the catalytic performance. However, one deficiency common with many sulfides (such as thiosulfhydryl compounds) is the pungent odor. Sulfur is also capable of undergoing rapid oxidation, quickly deactivates metal catalysts, and terminates the catalytic cycle, all of which are challenges to future development.
4.3 Selenides
LDH-derived selenides that circumscribes a specific structural and morphological group, which inherit corresponding structures and properties can be prepared by conformal selenization. Conformal selenides have the advantages of high specific surface area and full exposure of active sites. Dutta et al. prepared NiFe LDH-NiSe by a self-supporting method, where NiFe LDH-NiSe/NF was obtained by gradual surface redox etching of nickel foam by the hydrothermal method.126 Kang et al. prepared a CoFe LDH precursor by a separation–nucleation–aging (SNAS) method and then vulcanized and selenized the product in a tube furnace for 100 min at 500 °C to obtain Co0.75Fe0.25(S0.2Se0.8)2.127 EIS and ECSA studies revealed that the material showed significantly enhanced electron transport and electrochemically active surface area of LDH, and improved electrocatalytic performance. MOF based materials can be used as precursors for the design and construction of nanostructured materials, as Ao et al. proposed the synthesis of ZIF-67@LDH/CFP by an ion-exchange method. Then the hydrothermal selenization process was used to generate Y–SNi–Co–Se/CFP nanoparticles.128 The catalysts prepared showed long-term stability, which was attributed to: (1) the synergistic binding effect of Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se in nanostructures; (2) in situ growth on the CFP substrate, which improves the charge transfer and ion diffusion efficiency on the electrode; (3) the unique yolk–shell structure had more exposed active centers.
Duan et al. combined elemental selenium in NiFe LDH and compared with tSe isomer doped NiFe LDH; the optimized Ni0.8Fe0.2-m/t-Se0.22-LDH catalyst using mixed m/t-Se isomers promoted the formation of γ-NiOOH and reduced iron in the OER process.129 With nickel foam as the carrier, Sun et al. prepared NiFe LDH, following which CoSe nanotubes were combined with the precursor to form CoSe@NiFe LDH/NF (Fig. 15a confirms the success of the synthesis).130 Due to the rod-like structure (Fig. 15b and c), uniform distribution of each element (Fig. 15d) and the optimized adsorption/desorption of oxygenated species at the electrolyte interface. Owing to the electronic coupling between the transition metals in CoSe@NiFe-LDH/NF (Fig. 15e), it was found that the electronic structure is stable after selenization. Li et al. prepared graded hollow (Co,Ni)Se2@NiFeLDH nanoparticles from a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67).98 They attributed the exposure of more active sites to selenization, and the enhanced OER activity to more optimal adsorption/desorption properties of oxygen-containing species provided by the iron and nickel/cobalt complexes. Xue et al. produced CoSex nanocrystals by in situ reduction and interfacial directional assembly.131 The Co–O and Co–Se clusters were then hydrated in the synchronous reduction/precipitation reaction of Co2+ enamine and NaHSe on the toluene water interface. Besides, due to the strong electron absorption ability of metallic Co, electrons can be spontaneously transferred from Co LDH to adjacent Co nanocrystals, which synergized the structure, components, and electronic configuration of the synthesized LDH-based selenides, and finally improved the electrical conductivity and provided ion adsorption and permeation channels. Li et al. arranged the cactus-like NiCo–OH precursor vertically on carbon cloth by a hydrothermal method and selenized by CVD.132 Finally, the NiFe LDH nanosheet was deposited on the surface of the (Ni, Co)Se2 scaffold forming a three-dimensional (Ni, Co)Se2/NiFe-LDH nanocomposite. Growing it directly in carbon cloth can reduce ohmic loss in the system, provide a pathway for effective charge transfer, facilitate the rapid release of bubbles formed in OER processes, and achieve moderate catalytic activity and stability. Song et al. took Se powder as a grinding aid and sintered after high-strength ball grinding for a long time obtaining a block-shaped electrode Ni1−xFexSe1.15 with high porosity and mechanical strength.133 The activity was generated on its surface by in situ electrochemical oxidation to generate the LDH structure. This unique method improves the catalytic efficiency of the material, achieves lower charge transfer resistance and greater electrochemically active surface area, and will be further explored in future studies.

4.4 Nitrogen
Nitrogenation/ammoniation processes may cause rise in Fermi levels on conversion of LDH to the corresponding nitrides.134,135 Due to its bonding properties inside the metal and its unique electronic structure, the conductivity of nitrides and adsorption ability of water molecules is better. This enables the converted nitrides to have low resistance and corrosion resistance. Binary metal-modified LDH complexes, the binary metal nitrides of LDHs, show outstanding catalytic activity. Tang et al. designed a new composite material based on NiFe LDHs and graphene (nitrogen-doped graphene foam, NGF) and carried out nitrogen doping that created graphene defects.136 These defects promoted the adsorption and anchoring of metal cations, making NiFe LDH/NGF a potentially useful electrocatalytic material. Zhou et al. used an in situ synthesis route to vertically grow Ni2CoIIIFe-LDH arrays of nanostructured flakes on N-doped GO through defect induction nucleation.137 Due to the two synergistic effects, the as-prepared nitride composite has the maximum number of active centers and rapid electron transfer efficiency.
Chen et al. synthesized NiCo LDH on 3D NiCo foam and treated it with N2/Ar plasma under different conditions.138 The plasma effectively produced N-doped NiCo LDH catalysts (partial nitridation) which significantly improved the electrocatalytic performance of N–NiCoLDH. In the alkaline electrolyte at 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential was 190 mV and the Tafel slope was 46 mV dec−1. Lobinsky et al. synthesized CoAl LDH nanosheets and N-doped graphene composites by continuous ion layer deposition.139 It yielded a larger electrocatalyst active surface, which enabled the ions to remove bubbles near the electrode layer and from the surface. This novel property contributes to its catalytic performance. Wang et al. successfully exfoliated bulk CoFe LDHs into ultrathin CoFe nitride LDH nanometer sheets using nitrogen plasma.140 The ultrathin CoFe LDH nanocrystals showed an increased number of reactive centers. Due to the conductivity of LDH and the limited active centers, it cannot be used for large-scale practical applications.141 Nie et al. proposed a method to overcome this shortcoming, wherein the amorphous NiFe LDH nanosheet is directly electrodeposited forming 3D N-doped hierarchical porous NiCoP@NC. This study opens up new prospects for the design of effective LDH based catalysts. Chen et al. synthesized N-doped carbon nanosheets, CoFe/NH–C NSs using the flower-shaped LDH as the multifunctional template.142 CoFe NPs and N-doped carbon have a strong synergistic effect, providing higher ECSAs and higher vibrant centers, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity. Hu et al. synthesized a novel N-doped NiZnCu LDH using a simple hydrothermal method and a bi-functional catalyst N–NiZnCuLDH/rGO on nickel foam.143 Xu et al. obtained N-doped graphite foil (NNGF) with a nanoarray structure through N2 plasma treatment and electrodeposited NiFe LDH on NNGF for direct use as an OER electrode.144 Due to the nanoarray structure, the electrolyte's wettability and gas release were significantly improved. With the intense interaction between N dopant and LDH sheets, the charge transfer is enhanced substantially. At the same time, the composite electrode shows low resistance and high conductivity. Jia et al. prepared ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets by a reverse microemulsion method followed by synthesis of Ni3FeN-NPs by a thermal aminolysis method (Fig. 16a).145 The face-centered cubic structure of Ni3FeN was established (Fig. 16b). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the band structure and the density of states (DOS) of Ni3FeN near the Fermi level (Fig. 16c). It was found that Ni3FeN was metallic and had no obvious band gap. By calculation, it was found that Ni3FeN possessed the largest adsorption energy (Fig. 16d), thus enhancing the adsorption of H2O and improving the electron transfer efficiency from the active sites to H2O.

4.5 Phosphorus
The metallic nature of transition metal phosphates promotes electron transfer in water-catalyzed redox reactions. P element close to metal centers forms metal phosphates, which improves electronic transport through greater delocalization.146 Zeng et al. reported a method for synthesizing porous metal hydroxide nanosheets using amphoteric aluminum ions and cobalt phosphide (CP) from CoAl LDH/CP blends by selective etching.147 Low-temperature phosphation converts CoAl LDH/CP into porous cobalt phosphide nanoparticles loaded on carbon paper. The synthesized p-CoP/CP has low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and low charge transfer resistance, high electrochemical surface area, and good catalytic activity and good stability throughout the wide pH range. Xie et al. prepared Mo-doped ZnCo LDH by a hydrothermal method and obtained Mo–ZnCoP-LDH after phosphation.148 The results show that the phosphating material has a porous structure, which improves the electrocatalytic performance. Among them, Mo–ZnCoP-3 nanosheets have a higher current density than others, indicating that Mo doping can reduce the overpotential and improve the OER performance. Improving the mass transfer and electron conductivity by changing the nanostructure and electron configuration is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical activity and stability. Wang et al. effectively controlled NiCoPO/NC nanocrystal synthesis with ZIF-67 as the precursor through chemical etching and phosphation.149 The material contains not only nitrogen-doped carbon but also carbon doped with P and O elements. After phosphation, the porosity and oxygen vacancy provide the material better catalytic activity. By adjusting the surface electron density, Qu et al. prepared Ru–NiFe–P nanosheets on three-dimensional self-supported nickel foam by doping Ru into transition metal phosphates.150 Density functional theory calculation shows that the purpose of doping Ru is to generate new active sites on ruthenium atom and substitute P, resulting in lower Gibbs free energy.
Meanwhile, amorphous nickel hydroxide/nickel foam was treated by Liang using phosphine (PH3) plasma (Fig. 17a–f),151 NiFe LDH and NiFeP had strong electronic interactions that significantly reduced the adsorption energy of H2O and improved the OER activity. In an alkaline electrolyte, the overpotential was 258 mV at a current density of 300 mA cm−2, and the Tafel slope was 39 mV dec−1 (Fig. 17g and h). Wang et al. used CoAl LDH as the precursor and combined it with an ultrathin amorphous Al2O3 nanosheet and modified CoPS nanoparticles to produce CoPS/Al2O3-n bifunctional electrocatalysts.152 In these compounds, Co atoms occupy the vertex and surface centers, while P2− and S− atoms are uniformly distributed at the edge and the center of the body. Since the electron charge associated with high concentrations of P2− promotes the formation of (adsorbed H) Hads in the HER process, this technique prevents the aggregation of CoPS nanoparticles. Wang et al. used hydrothermal synthesis to grow NiCo nanoarrays on NF and phosphation under calcination to obtain NiCoP/NF, and finally, a hydrothermal reaction to obtain NiCoP@NiMn LDH.153 The electrocatalytic advantages of phosphating heterogeneous structure arrays are as follows: (1) a heterogeneous junction combines the intrinsic properties of NF and achieves high activity through effective interface engineering between two phases; (2) NiCoP significantly improved the conductivity of the electrode; (3) the Ni foam supported by the 3D network is conducive to exposing more active centers, ensuring the rapid release of bubbles and electron/mass transfer.

Using certain methods (such as calcination, doping, etc.), we can obtain the corresponding derivatives of LDH, including oxides and selenides, and sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus derivatives. As shown in Table 4, LDH has poor electrical conductivity. Transformation of hydroxides into the corresponding derivatives through crystal phase transformation can significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of LDH, thus improving the electrochemical performance of the materials. It is worth mentioning that the LDO complexes were obtained after calcination in an O2 atmosphere and have a unique memory effect. It is not only conducive to storage but also can facilitate anion exchange. The improvement of OER performance is most obvious when LDH is converted into sulfides, nitrides and phosphides. The excellent electrocatalytic performance should be attributed to the improvement in the corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity and electronic structure. It is observed that the performances of many catalysts improve after sulfuration, nitridation and phosphation. However, the process requires careful operation at high temperatures and a closed environment, and how to operate safely at room temperature and prepare evenly dispersed LDH derivatives is also worth further study. On the other hand, the improvement of performance is what we are pursuing. We are also interested in the green optimization of this approach and the replacement of other inorganic elements.

5. LDH-based composites
Although LDH materials present good OER activity, their applications are restricted by the low electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is essential to combine them with materials that have excellent electrical conductivity and heterogeneous structures, forming composite materials. Also, a unique design of the composite material provides support for the growth of LDH nanosheets. It comprises impressive nanosheet arrays, nanowires, nanocages, and nanotubes with abundant active sites. In this section, heterostructures, carbon-containing complexes and emerging MXene-based complexes are summarized, and it was found through research that the formation of composite materials enhances the conductivity, and their select properties can improve the OER catalytic activity of LDH composites.
5.1 Heterostructures
Two-dimensional (2D) heterojunctions are composed of two different materials bound by van der Waals forces. Because these interactions are weak, the stacking between the two layers is relatively easy to control, and the electronic properties can be tuned. Due to the inherent advantages and strong coupling of LDH based materials, 2D heterogeneous structures have abundant catalytic activity sites, high electron conductivity, and high catalytic activity. Bai et al. demonstrated high catalytic activity for both OER and HER using the NiFe LDH photoanode when modified by a WO3/Fe2O3 heterojunction.159 This formulation showed excellent stability at high current densities. Hu et al. assembled MoS2 with NiCo LDH by use of a microwave hydrothermal reaction.160 Its superlattice structure produces a substantial effect on the adsorption of intermediate reactants which leads to improvements in electrical conductivity and electron transport capacity over the NiCo LDH base and better OER activity in an alkaline environment. Chen et al. made FeOOH nanoparticles with NiFe LDH structures and demonstrated extremely high activity in OER catalysis.161 Because of strong interfacial interactions, the obtained FeOOH/LDH complex showed a strong synergistic catalytic effect in the OER. Its activity was much higher than that of the same type of LDH. The result is highly dependent on the size of the FeOOH nanoparticles, and the catalytic activity increased with decrease in the size. When the average size of FeOOH nanoparticles is 2.0 nm, only 174 mV overpotential is required for driving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Gao et al. used a pulsed laser to synthesize the Ni/NiFe LDH precursor in one step. After electrochemical oxidation, the NiO content was about 18.2%, and the existence of a heterojunction was confirmed by the TEM image (Fig. 18a and b). It is noteworthy that the excellent OER activity should be partially attributed to the heterojunction configuration (Fig. 18c and d).162Fig. 18e shows the 4-electron OER process of the NiO/NiFe LDH heterostructure. A nickel cation with a special position was found in the model and the heterostructure showed unique catalytic behavior when it was used as the active site. For better understanding, the dynamic 3D adsorption process was captured as a 2D image (Fig. 18f). The left side is the heterostructure after adsorption, and the right side is the pristine LDH. Obviously, compared with the adsorption process on LDH, there are one or two additional chemical bonds in the heterostructure facilitating the adsorption of Ni cationic intermediates, and the additional chemical bonds of each intermediate are different (shown in the red square). The free energy and theoretical overpotential of the heterostructure (yellow line) and LDH (green line) were calculated respectively. It was found that NiO/NiFe LDH has smaller free energy, enabling a favorable OER process (Fig. 18g). Finally, the volcanic curve of theoretical overpotential for the OER is given, where “T” represents different NiO/NiFe LDH models, “L” is the LDH model and “S” is the interfacial center activity. It can be clearly identified that “T1” model has the smallest overpotential and minimum ΔG*O − ΔG*OH value (Fig. 18h). For reaction kinetics, it was verified again that the structure shows the best catalytic activity. Yang et al. prepared a NiMn LDH/NiCo2O4 heterostructure by a hydrothermal method and a subsequent leaching method.163 The synergistic effect between NiMn LDH nanosheets and NiCo2O4 nanowires improves the electrical conductivity, speeds up charge transfer, increases the metal valence state, and plays a significant role in promoting the reaction dynamics, contributing to the electrocatalytic performance of the OER. Thus, this work demonstrates a smart strategy for boosting OER kinetics.

Metals with good conductivity, as suitable matrix materials, can speed up the electron transfer. Due to their unique network structure, the loaded LDHs have a large specific surface area, a high electron transmission rate, and an open channel for material transmission, thus improving the catalytic performance. Liang et al. synthesized a kind of Ni3S2/NiFe LDH with a 3D nuclear shell structure by simple electrodeposition combined with a hydrothermal method.164 The prepared catalyst has abundant exposure edge and surface area, more electrocatalytic reaction active centers, and an easier gas escape path. Wang et al. further engineered NiFe LDHs/GO/NF by directly growing NiFe LDHs after a graphene layer was deposited on the pre-treated nickel network, making the NiFe LDHs/GO/NF electrode an ideal catalyst.165 Liu et al. developed a hydrothermal method to obtain NiV-LDH/NF, and then obtained Ni3S2@NiV-LDH/NF directly from NiV LDH/NF by a simple in situ partial anion exchange method, in which Ni3S2 grows vertically on the surface of NF and are spatially connected.166 The excellent performance of the material is attributed to the following factors: (1) the increase of marginal sites exposes more catalytic active centers; (2) the strong electron interaction between Ni3S2 and NiV-LDH accelerates the charge transfer and boosts reaction kinetics; (3) the heterostructure has high electronic conductivity; (4) strong surface wettability.
5.2 Carbon-based composites
Carbon materials, such as graphene, have attracted great attention in recent years because of their excellent electrical conductivity, chemical stability and 2D flake structure. By merging LDH sheets with graphene, researchers have discovered a stacking structure of heterogeneous sheets. It improves the electronic conductivity and enhances the exposure of microscopic active sites, thereby effectively improving the OER activity of LDHs. Ma et al. synthesized NiMn LDHs by a hydrothermal method, in which they were exfoliated into flakes after ion exchange with rGO. Alternating stacked layers of superlattice composites, NiMn LDHs/rGO promote reactant conversion and provide sufficient electrons to endow the material with ideal catalytic activity.167 Long et al. prepared FeNi–CO3-LDHs and FeNi–GO-LDHs by a one-step ion exchange method.168 The GO was then reduced to rGO by a chemical method, and the FeNi-LDHs were interspersed with intercalated rGO. Han et al. obtained CoFe LDHs with excellent OER activity by tailoring Fe3+.169 The activity was further enhanced by the assembly of CoFe LDHs and rGO into composites. Han et al. directly adsorbed Co2+, Fe3+ and Al3+ on GO surfaces and instantly grew CoFeAl LDHs by a thermal urea reflux method.170 It was then dissolved in an alkaline solution and infused with aluminum ions to form an FeCoOOH/GO alloy. If this material is subjected to long term electrochemical testing in alkaline electrolyte solutions, the layered structure will be damaged. However, this problem can be rectified by coupling it to an extensive 3D network to have high electron conductivity. For example, Tang et al. loaded carbon quantum dots on ultrathin NiFe LDH nanocrystals to form the composite alloy NiFe-LDHs/CQDs.171 Cao et al. prepared NiCoFe LDH nanometer tablets (S–NiCoFe LDH) layered on carbon cloth.121 A unique 3D layered nanostructure and sulfur-doping endowed the self-supporting S–NiCoFe LDH electrode with rich active sites and high electrical conductivity, making it the most effective and low-cost electrochemical catalyst for the OER. As Ni laced graphene carbon nanospheres (HPGC) with multi-stage holes were formed from pyrolyzed and acidified phenol resin,172 the NiFe LDH nanometer sheets grew vertically on the surface of the HPGC sphere by a hydrothermal method to develop a special core–shell structure. The doping of hetero-atomic nitrogen also changes the charge density of the graphene sheets. Chen et al. treated graphene with ammonia water to achieve nitrogen doping.173 Heterogeneous deposition was employed to vertically load NiCo LDHs onto both sides of the graphene sheet. Electrode dynamics, catalytic activity, and stability were improved, and the current density significantly increased. Jia et al. prepared a hybrid catalyst of NiFeLDH-NS@DG10 by exfoliation of NiFeLDH together with high defective density graphene (DG) (Fig. 19a).174 The overpotential was determined to be 0.21 V in the alkaline electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1 (Fig. 19b,c).

Side views of the 3D charge density difference plot for the interfaces between a defective graphene sheet (DG-5, DG-585, or DG-5775) and an Ni–Fe LDH-NS layer are shown.

(c) Tafel plots for the OER174 (Copyright@2017, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.KGaA, Weinheim). 
Currently, carbon cloth (CC) is commonly used as the substrate. Different heterogeneous active materials can store charge on CC and thus play a key role in the OER performance. For instance, Tang et al. reported that the presence of a favorable substrate in LDH-based electrocatalysts is highly required from the perspective of performance enhancement, which can expose the low-conductivity active phase and enhance the intrinsic activity of the OER.175 This work summarized the different synthesis strategies and fractional structures of different carbon substrates and NiFe LDH, and systematically reported the related nanocarbon catalysts. Yan et al. produced self-supported CoMn LDH nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 1.9 nm, fabricated on carbon fiber cloth by an electrodeposition method within fifty seconds.176 This method is convenient and binder-free, demonstrating good electrochemical performance. Kong et al. grew ZIF-67 on carbon cloth and transformed ZIF-67 into Co(OH)2. Meanwhile, Fe (FeCo) LDH nanoarrays were electrodeposited on Co(OH)2 at room temperature.177 The catalyst demonstrated gradation arrays and was loaded on carbon cloth. Besides, FeCo alloy can facilitate electronic transfer between new interfaces with CoOOH in the OER, thereby improving OER performance and durability. Zhang et al. formed NiFe-LDH on carbon cloth and proved that the electrodes showed strong long-term electrochemical durability.178 The superior activity is attributed to the pre-formed amorphous NiFe–Bi layer, which effectively promotes the generation of active species on the NiFe-LDH surface and the excellent conductivity of the carbon cloth that enhances the OER performance by regulating electronic structures and using binder-free catalysts.
5.3 MXene-based LDHs
MXene is made of transition metal carbide and nitride, with widely adjustable electronic conductivity, energy band, and work function. The formula of MXene is Mn+1Xn, where M is the pre-transition metal, and X is carbon or nitrogen, which has a layered structure like graphene. MXene can be utilized in the field of electrocatalysis by adjusting its surface properties and constructing LDH based composite materials. As a new research direction, Yu et al. prepared an NiFe LDH/Ti3C2-MXene complex, and found that NiFe LDH and Ti3C2 MXene had strong interfacial interactions, facile electron coupling, and rapid charge transfer at the interface (Fig. 20a).179Fig. 20b–e evidence the fact that the complex showed improved structural stability and electrical conductivity and the OER process was faster compared to the corresponding individual compounds, leading to remarkable OER activity, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent durability in alkaline media. Dong et al. prepared stratified Ti3C2Tx/CoAl LDH composites by self-assembly through electrostatic interactions.180 Combining the advantages of the high electronic conductivity of Ti3C2Tx and high electrochemical activity of CoAl LDH, the electrochemical reaction demonstrates that oxygen production was effectively improved, and the kinetics of the Faraday reaction was accelerated. The monolayer of MXene has more active centers and is reported to have higher electrochemical activity than other MXene forms. Yan et al. successfully prepared a CoP/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure by a simple precipitation reaction and in situ growth,181 wherein CoP NAs were vertically anchored on the Ti3C2 MXene substrate, forming a layered 3D porous structure with high electrical conductivity, which not only prevents the self-aggregation of nanoparticles but also provides sufficient active centers and promotes the rapid release of gas and charge transfer. It paves ways for heterogeneous structure design and can be extended to MXene based electrocatalysts.

This enables synergistic chemical and electronic coupling for catalytic improvement in the OER.

(d) A comparison of these catalysts with regard to the onset overpotential and overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. (e) Tafel plots179 (Copyright@2017, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved). 
Tian et al. used HCl and LiF etching monolayer MXene nanocrystals and then formed FeCo LDHs on the monolayer MXene surface by refluxing in urea, after which the FeCo LDH/MXene composites were obtained.182 The composite of MXene stabilizes the LDH structure, resulting in a strong synergistic effect between the compounds, which endows the material with higher electron transfer capacity and greater specific surface area for electrochemical activity. Yu et al. impregnated electronegative MXene with electrostatically wrapped on a positively charged 3D NF macroporous scaffold and then obtained NiFe LDH/MXene/NF by electrodeposition.183 This complex had a strong chemical interaction, which confirmed that the redox activity of NiFe LDH/MXene was enriched, and the dynamic performance and the active surface of the system were increased by the use of binder-free NF and layered porous LDH. Hao et al. hybridized Ti3C2Tx/TiO2/NiFeCo LDH using a simple hot solvent.184 The excellent performance can be attributed to the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles, which enhanced the light absorption and improved the generation of electron/hole pairs.
Meanwhile, Ti3C2Tx nanosheet is a useful shuttle for electron/ion transport. Zhu et al. derived carbides from MXene, and constructed a 3D MDC/NiMn LDH by an in situ growth method,185 which has a porous structure, and the derived carbides are conducive to improving the electrical conductivity. Benchakar et al. devised a surface synthesis route for synergistic oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.186 Co-LDH and Ti3C2Tx have a synergistic effect that changes the surface chemical state of the substrate. The covering of MXene and Co preserved the material structure, and strong coupling occurs between Co and the LDH, which evidences that the presence of MXene is beneficial for the growth of the Co-LDH. The terminal groups of MXene can disperse the ions of the active phase. Heterogeneous nucleation results in the change of the electron structure on the Ti3C2Tx surface, which is beneficial to the formation of intermediates and speeds up the reaction kinetics.
The composites combine the advantages of LDHs and other materials, and play a significant synergistic role when used as OER catalysts. We compare the OER performances of different composites in Table 5. It can be seen that the heterojunction is obtained by combining the two heterostructures, boosting the catalytic activies. When LDHs are combined with carbon materials (with merits of high specific surface area and high conductivity), the low conductivity and low carrier mobility of LDHs can be overcome, resluting in advanced OER activity. As a hot and emerging material, MXene when combined with LDH shows improved catalytic activity. It is worth noting that MXene contains C and Ti elements, which can not only improve the electrical conductivity but also be sensitive to visible light because of the suitable band gap, owing to which it should have good prospective applications in the field of photoelectric water hydrolysis. Thus, there are many challenges in designing new structures and engineering LDH based composites. Accurate regulation of composition, proportion, size and thickness to improve not only the activity but also stability is important, but how to exactly do it still needs more effort.

6. Energy conversion and storage devices
In the context of an energy shortage, the overall water splitting technology can produce hydrogen and oxygen by electrocatalysis. At present, high-efficiency catalysts are highly desirable. LDHs show superior catalytic performance for anode oxygen evolution reactions under alkaline conditions and are widely used. On the other hand, zinc–air batteries are a semi-closed, energy conversion device that uses the redox reaction between elemental zinc (anode) and oxygen (cathode) in the air to generate electricity. The research on oxygen reduction catalysts for zinc–air batteries still focuses on metallic or carbon-based materials with high activity and high cost. Among the alternatives to Pt catalysts, LDH-based materials have attracted great interest due to their low cost, abundance, and high catalytic performance. Electrochemical water splitting is an important component of artificial photosynthesis. To develop artificial photosynthesis devices is our ultimate goal to achieve green energy. In light of these facts, we will give a list of three classical applications of the OER, through which we want to encourage exploration of multifunctional catalysts in the future.
6.1 Water splitting
Electrolysis of water is considered as the most promising hydrogen evolution technology because it can store green energy (such as solar and wind energy) in hydrogen for future utilization. One key for its large-scale application is identifying how to reduce the overpotential of the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and realize large-scale production of hydrogen at a low potential, thus reducing power consumption and hydrogen production cost. Recently, Wang annealed CoAl-LDH-3 at a high temperature of 500 °C, forming CoPS/Al2O3-3.192 SEM image (Fig. 21a–c) shows that CoPS/Al2O3-3 retained the sheet morphology of the precursor, and the doped-P and S evenly distributed over the whole sheet. The full cell water splitting performance with CoPS/Al2O3-3 working as both the anode and the cathode is even superior to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C/IrO2 (Fig. 21d). The results show that CoPS/Al2O3-3 can be used as a bifunctional catalyst to promote the water splitting reaction. Li et al. synthesized NiCo2O4@NixCoy LDH/NF by hydrothermal and electrodeposition techniques.193 The array-like morphology of the material is conducive to increasing the electrocatalytic surface area and electrical conductivity. Its heterogeneous structure improves the charge transfer rate, giving it good overall water splitting performance in alkaline electrolytes. Pirkarami et al. also used hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods to prepare CDS@NiCo-LDH forming a 3D core–shell structure.194 Yu et al. synthesized a hierarchical core–shell nanostructured Cu@CoFe LDH by electrodeposition.195 Due to the interconnected nanosheets, a highly porous surface morphology was formed which increases the active area and access to the catalytic site. Loading the catalyst on Cu reduces the electron transport path and energy barrier, thus speeding up the reaction. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of Co and Fe significantly improves the catalytic performance, making the material a potential “keeper” for use in the electrolysis of water.

Wang et al. synthesized NiV-LDH, NiVRu LDH, and NiVIr-LDH on Ni foam and found that V-doping was beneficial to regulate the conductivity of Ru and Ir.196 The self-supporting structure further improved its catalytic performance. Moreover, theoretical calculations verified that the electronic structure was appropriate to split water effectively. Sun et al. constructed a water-splitting electrochemical cell with NiTe@RuO2 as the cathode and NiTe@NiFe-LDH as the anode.197 NiFe LDH was deposited on T-shaped NiTe nanorods by electrodeposition to prepare a unique hierarchical structure. The outstanding water splitting stability is due to the unique architecture of the catalyst. The assembled device exhibited advanced full cell performance as confirmed from the behavior at high current densities, where 1.58 and 1.63 V are required to drive current densities at 100 and 200 mA cm−2, respectively. The calculated Faraday efficiency is close to 97%, and the current densities at 10 mA cm−2 can be maintained for 27 h. In this research, an elegant catalyst structure is fabricated, and electron transport is accelerated, which provides a new design idea for catalyst design. Han et al. prepared NiFe LDH by a hydrothermal method and obtained nitrogen-modified NiFe LDH using ammonia as the nitrogen source.198 When the introduced N atoms have the appropriate water separation energy, the electronic structure can be tuned. The N12–NiFe LDH exhibits good water splitting performance under alkaline conditions. NiFe LDH has been proved to exhibit decent OER performance, while the HER performance seems to be unsatisfactory. By doping Rh into NiFe LDH, Zhang et al. significantly improved the HER dynamics without sacrificing the OER performance.199 Rh–NiFeOxHy is an ideal bifunctional electrocatalyst in alkaline media, which could be attributed to the following explanation: (1) water molecules are unstable on the surface of Rh, and the addition of Rh can improve the dissociation rate of water, which is beneficial to HER dynamics; (2) the excessively strong binding of Had on the surface of Rh often hinders H2 production release and can be used to balance the strong OHad on NiFeOxHy; (3) substituting Rh for Fe in NiFeLDH can improve its OER activity. Zhu et al. proposed a simultaneous etch-doped sedimentation equilibrium (EDSE) strategy to design Rh-doped CoFe LDH. The results show that the hollow structure with Rh-doping and Fe vacancy can optimize the whole hydrolysis process.200 Through the DFT calculation, it is also concluded that Rh-doping can improve the catalytic performance by adjusting the electronic structure and improve the electrical conductivity. Simultaneously, it has significant reducibility, and the reduction of the free energy barrier in the intermediate state accelerates the dynamics of the water-splitting process.
6.2 Zinc–air batteries
Flexible energy devices promote the development of portable and wearable electronic devices. Among the various energy devices developed in recent years, portable power sources have received great attention, such as zinc–air batteries, which offer functional OER and ORR reaction paths between elemental zinc (anode) and oxygen (cathode) in the air and result in the generation of electricity. Due to the intractable challenges, the zinc–air batteries are still far away from large-scale practical applications. Thus, solving the slow dynamics of the involved OER and ORR, as well as improving the charging and discharging efficiency of the battery and reducing the energy loss is highly desirable. So far, numerous efforts have been made to find alternative non-precious metal materials to reduce the cost of zinc–air batteries. Owing to the decent OER activity and stability in alkaline electrolytes, LDHs have been regarded as a promising candidate for zinc–air battery application. Guo et al. prepared Co3O4@NiFe LDH nanosheets with core–shell structures based on Co3O4 nanowire arrays as cores by using the chemical codeposition and thermal decomposition method.201 Through this unique design, increasing its active surface area and can offer more active sites. It becomes a new standard reference for the application of LDH materials in zinc–air batteries (Fig. 22a). Fig. 22b and c show the agreement between the internal structure and CV results during charging and discharging. The mutual support and dispersion of the two structures significantly improved the catalytic performance, enabling the Co3O4@NiFe LDH LDH catalyst to operate up to the 1250th cycle (Fig. 22d and e). Huang et al. reported a steric hindrance strategy and introduction of LDH layer growth for in situ deposition of high-density LDH on carbon nanosheets to obtain Ni-LDH C/CNSs.202 It has high electrocatalytic selectivity and Faraday efficiency up to 95%. The significant increase of Ni edge in the structure provides numerous active centers, working as active adsorption sites in thermodynamics. The synergistic effect of CNSs and Ni-LDH leads to two-electron transport pathways with high activity and selectivity. Wang et al. used a sacrificial template method to synthesize Co and N-doped carbon nanosheets and deposited 3–5 nm NiFe LDH nanoparticles on them.203 The synergistic effect of the two binary metal components changes the electronic structure of the catalyst, to be more specific, moving electrons away from the metal cation and promoting intermediate state formation. As a cathode catalyst, the material can be used in rechargeable zinc–air batteries with lower charging voltage and higher discharge voltage. Also, it has excellent energy storage and discharge performance.

(c) Voltage curve of the initial discharge–charge tests. (d) The discharge–charge voltage profile of the Zn–air battery. The cycle numbers surpass 1200 cycles (at 15 mA cm−2, 10 min per cycle). (e) Discharge–charge voltage curves of the Zn–air battery at the 1st and the 1250th cycle201 (Copyright@2019, American Chemical Society). 
In another study, Wang et al. combined MnO2 with NiFe LDH by electrodeposition.204 Each element in the composite is uniformly distributed, and its unique network gives rise to significant dispersion of gases. In this innovative approach, vaseline was used to assist the electrodeposition. This has been subsequently found to facilitate the use and application of other catalysts. It also demonstrated excellent charging and discharging stability and good catalytic performance. Li et al. obtained CoAl-LDH@PDA NSAs with a core–shell structure by a hydrothermal method and calcined it in a N2 atmosphere to obtain Co–CoOx/N–C NSAs.205 It has high power density, excellent flexibility, and outstanding durability when applied in flexible all-solid zinc–air batteries. Wan et al. maximized the advantages of MnOx for the ORR and FeNi LDH for the OER. MnOx and FeNi LDH were electrodeposited on both sides of NF, respectively.206 The Janus structure with dual-function electrodes provides a valuable method for developing high-performance rechargeable ZABs, which has the advantages of simple preparation, low cost, high energy efficiency, and good long-term stability. Xie et al. has developed an efficient dual-function electrocatalyst consisting of NiFe alloy sheets doped with N-doped carbon nanotubes (TA-NiFe@NCNT).207 The significant bifunctional performance of TA-NiFe@NCNT can be attributed to the excellent OER and ORR activity of NiFe alloy nanoparticles and NCNTs, as well as the good electrical conductivity of the high porosity electrocatalysts, which is conducive to electron transfer processes. Therefore, this material is a very promising low-cost and dual-function catalyst for rechargeable zinc air batteries.
6.3 Artificial photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the oxygen production activity that occurs naturally in the Earth during the day (Fig. 23 left). Natural photosynthesis is carried out by cyanobacteria, algae and plants that use the sun's energy to reduce carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. Imitating the process of photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis (Fig. 23 right) aims at producing oxygen, via fully digested water, and renewable chemical fuels. The process enables conversion of naturally abundant materials such as water and carbon dioxide into useful chemicals, such as O2, H2, CO and hydrocarbons, which are required for replacing non-renewable energy in the future. Among them, decomposition of water under light is a typical artificial photosynthesis technology used for converting solar energy into chemical energy, which has been widely studied. Direct hydrogen generation for fuel effectively powered by solar energy is the key for sustainable development of the society. The process involves the OER and HER with the involvement of light in the whole process.208–213 Ghausi prepared nitrogen doped porous silicon from carbon nanomaterials (SiNC),214 and it was extended to the electrochemical decomposition of CO2, wherein the response included the CO2 reduction reaction (CDRR: CO2 + 2H+ +2e− → CO + H2O) and the OER. Experimental results confirm that SiNC catalysts show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER, and can produce structures with large specific surface areas and high porosity. Also, the mechanism ensures that the flexible electronic system of the –Si(O)–C–N– bond in the SiNC structure can act as a highly active center for the CDRR and OER at the same time, reducing the adsorption free energy between the CDRR and OER. This work provides a protype for the realization of highly efficient artificial photosynthesis.
 Fig. 23  Artificial photosynthesis corresponding to the OER response schemata. 
As a standard performance indicator of OER catalysts, an overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is conceptually derived from artificial photosynthesis. The conversion efficiency of solar energy is 10%. The OER is related to artificial photosynthesis because the electrochemical process of water splitting converts the electricity generated by sunlight into chemical energy stored in H2 and O2. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is derived from artificial photosynthesis and is also used to screen the intrinsic activity of OER electrocatalysts.25 It can be seen that the additional light cannot be separated in the electrocatalysis. Resasco et al. demonstrated Ta:TiO2|BiVO4 prepared from Ta-doped TiO2 nanowires as a host and BiVO4 as a guest material.215 The nanowires have a broad band of light absorption and carrier collection efficiency, surface recombination in the low potential zone, and improved water oxidation kinetics. At present, the OER performance is also much improved when electrocatalysis is carried out in LDH and mimics photosynthesis. CuNiFe LDH was synthesized by Cai using a rapid photoetching method.216 The overpotential was 224 mV and the Tafel slope was 44 mV dec−1 in the alkaline electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the numerous generated Ni(III/IV) active species and the improved charge transfer upon introduction of Cu, highlighting the possibility of photo-etching to boost OER kinetics. Arif et al. successfully synthesized a highly efficient and active OER catalyst, CoMn LDH@g-C3N4 for artificial photosynthesis at room temperature (Fig. 24a).217 Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has many advantages, such as tunable visible light absorption, electronic structure, high thermal and chemical stability, and environmental friendliness. However, the small specific surface area, inherent low conductivity, and easily recombined electron–hole pairs hinder its further applications. The combination of uniform LDH and g-C3N4 nano-sheets (Fig. 24b and c) enables the formation of many interspaces, promotes water molecule adsorption, and thus increases charge transport (Fig. 24d and e). Many people have noticed that by carrying out OER under light irradiation, electronic transition within the catalyst system can be effectively promoted and the overpotential is also reduced. The light absorption properties can be further engineered by doping with Ti, Zn, and other metal ions. It will be beneficial to imitate photosynthesis and add light response elements to LDH-based materials to form new multiple LDH structures, which can widely be applied to the OER.

(d) Overall water splitting. (e) Durability test using CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4(10%) as the OER and HER catalyst217 (Copyright 2018, Chemistry-An Asian Journal). 
LDH based materials play an essential role in the field of electrocatalysis. For example, they are used as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting and zinc–air batteries. There are some findings of these materials as multi-functional catalysts; for example, Zhang et al. recently proposed a three-dimensional NiFe-based hydroxyl sulfide monomer with anion regulation.228 The catalyst has abundant active centers and a unique structure, yielding excellent OER, ORR, and HER performance in alkaline electrolytes. However, some problems still need to be solved, including how the active sites of LDH and its derivatives affect further development of the catalytic mechanism. New revelations of the catalytic mechanism and synergistic catalysis will benefit the design of the catalytic system based on LDH materials and develop renewable clean energy and energy storage devices.

Table 6 summarizes the applications of LDHs. In the water splitting reaction, the required potential for the full cell becomes smaller and smaller, which is generally less than 1.5 V. A smaller potential means high efficiency hydrogen production. It should be pointed out that the OER can not only be used in the field of energy storage, but also in the field of batteries. In a zinc–air battery, involving the OER and ORR, LDHs possess good flexibility and a tunable nature. Besides that, LDHs also show their promising application potential in the field of artificial photosynthesis. All in all, assembling LDH materials into devices for energy storage and battery applications allows us to use existing renewable resources to create energy and provide the energy needed for the human society. However, it is still a long-term challenge and hard task, not only in the field of science but also in the field of engineering.

7. Conclusion and future perspectives
Due to the global energy demand and environmental problems, hydrogen energy has become the most promising fuel cell for energy storage and electricity consumption. Its popularity is driven by high energy release, and clean and renewable sources. Electrolysis of water consists of the two half-reactions: anodic oxygen evolution (OER) and cathode hydrogen evolution (HER). Both reactions motivate the expansion of high purity hydrogen production. Many materials exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance, but the OER still requires a more significant superpotential bias to match HER rates due to the multiple electron transfer steps involved in the various electron coupling steps needed to complete the OER and the relatively slow reaction dynamics. The primary function of OER electrocatalysts is to adsorb reactants on the surface and form adsorption intermediates that facilitate charge transfer between electrodes and reactants. An in-depth understanding of OER mechanisms can contribute to the development and optimization of catalysts. A large number of studies have discussed the advantages and research value of LDHs for use as OER catalysts. Some of these studies focus on improving the intrinsic activity of the catalyst by optimizing the chemical composition, while others focus on changing the electronic band structure of materials or optimizing the interfacial structure and morphology to increase the exposed active sites.
To enhance the catalytic performance, tailoring the structure and tuning the functionalities of LDHs have become useful solutions. These focus on exploiting the method of exfoliation and manufacture of defects. Some studies have also focused on the exposure of active sites to the solution phase, increasing the electrochemical surface area, and adjusting electronic band structures to match those of admixed heterocomplexes. According to the different functional requirements, other functional elements are needed to build a multi-component LDH system enabling altered chemical properties. Such adjustments would take advantage of the interlayer anionic exchangeability, including the LDH restructuring of interlayer anions by the FNP method and other ion exchange methods, to achieve new anion interlayer structures. These include expanding the layer spacing to improve the catalytic performance. Finally, some of the LDH structures are derived from the MOFs, and unique hollow designs are obtained by etching LDHs by the template method leading to increased active area.
LDH derivatives, such as transition metal oxides, nitrides, and phosphates, have been prepared using calcination and doping, which often produce good yields in catalytic reactions. After calcination, LDH forms a dispersed, nanoscale LDO, an excellent catalytic material and copious charge carriers. It exhibits a good memory effect; when it loses interlayer anions in the calcination process, these can be reconstructed and restored to a layered structure when it is immersed in the anion solution. The metallic properties of transition metal phosphates have enhanced the electron transfer in the catalytic oxidation and water reduction. Sulfur compounds have demonstrated long-term stability in acidic media and have become promising electrocatalysts as well. Taking LDH compounds with specific structural spacings and morphology into account, they may be employed as precursor compounds combined with metal selenides having complementary structures that form active catalysts by conformal selenization. The conformal selenides have the advantages of high specific surface areas and full exposure of active sites to the liquid phase, conducive to high electrocatalytic activity. Nitrogen compounds have been prepared by nitrogenation/ammoniation treatment protocols applied to LDHs. The inherent metal bond characteristics and the resulting unique electronic structure of the compound improve the conductivity and adsorption capacity of the nitride compared with the pure LDHs. They show low resistance and good corrosion resistance, and demonstrate excellent catalytic activity.
By combining LDH reagents with highly conductive materials, the composite materials exhibit improved electron transport capacity and enhanced catalytic activity. In this review, we have presented the current development of LDH design, such as heterojunctions, carbon materials, MXene based complexes, etc. Due to the inherent advantages of layered structures and strong coupling of LDH based materials to many metal compounds, it is possible to build heterogeneous arrays that have abundant catalytic active sites, high electron conductivities, and good catalytic reactivity. Because of the narrow bandgap and electron flow in the heterojunction, the electrocatalytic activity is significantly increased.
At present, the preparation of novel single atom and composite LDH electrocatalysts for water splitting is a promising way to develop new energy devices. However, it remains challenging to up-regulate reaction rates for optimal electrochemical performance and stability. It is a favorable prospect to improve the catalytic kinetics and control the types and number of active centers. It is well known that LDHs show better performance in alkaline electrolytes, but applications of LDH-based catalysts in the full pH range are necessary, which need more efforts. Besides delivering remarkable catalytic activity and stability is another important factor that should be considered for real applications. More progress will undoubtedly be made by further exploring different catalytic mechanisms and performing theoretical calculations. More research should be conducted on the future development of the multiple compatibility of the in situ technology for achieving in-depth analysis of the structural changes of the catalyst in reactions. Apart from that, a combination of theoretical calculations and experiments in terms of kinetics to explore the reaction mechanism should be focused upon as well. It is important to note that simple, continuous and green synthesis methods are essential for future industrial applications. The application of LDHs and their derivatives will be extended to other fields, such as manufacturing, energy transduction and storage devices. Moreover, artificial photosynthesis and light-assisted OER processes are also effective strategies for promoting the reaction process, which has attracted great attention and has become a new pathway to catalysis.
