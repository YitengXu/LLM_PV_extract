    , Accepted 28th May 2021First published on 28th May 2021AbstractCo9S8 and transition metal hydroxides are both potential pseudo-capacitance electrode materials for supercapacitors. Co9S8 has a large specific capacitance and electrochemical activity, and transition metal hydroxides have the advantages of high capacitance and redox activity due to their multiple valence metals and open layered structure. In this study, Co9S8 and NiCoLDH are used to form a Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH composite electrode material by twining acidified carbon nanotubes (aCNTs) around hollow Co9S8 rods and then compounding nickel cobalt hydroxide (NiCoLDH) on the outside. aCNTs provide more electronic channels, which bring more active electrochemical reactions and absorb the volume expansion of Co9S8. The hollow Co9S8 rods and flower-like NiCoLDH structures ensure that the electrode has a highly open structure, which increases the contact area with the electrolyte and is beneficial for ion transport. The outer NiCoLDH can also reduce the volume expansion of Co9S8. These advantages ensure the high specific capacitance and rate performance of the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode material. Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH was used as the positive material to fabricate asymmetric supercapacitors with attractive energy density and power density, which further proved its excellent electrochemical performance.
1. Introduction
The progress in science and technology has brought a more convenient life for human beings, but at the same time it also has an irreversible impact on the environment. Non-renewable energy sources are gradually decreasing and facing a risk of exhaustion. It is necessary to develop renewable energy and clean energy sources. In recent years, research has focused mainly on solar energy, wind energy, hydrogen energy and biomass energy. With the development of renewable energy sources, improving the utilization rate and storage efficiency of renewable energy becomes the next major problem. A supercapacitor is an efficient energy storage and conversion device, which has the advantages of a high power density, long cycle life and high reliability. It has been widely used in new energy vehicles, smart grids, urban transportation and other fields.1–6 The key to the performance of supercapacitors lies in electrode materials, including carbon materials, conductive polymer materials, metal compound materials and so on.7–12
Carbon materials are one of the earliest electrode materials used in supercapacitors. Carbon-based materials are abundant in reserves, easy to produce and process, and non-toxic, and have an extremely high specific surface area, good conductivity and chemical stability. All kinds of advantages make them widely studied and applied in the field of supercapacitors. However, due to the double-layer energy storage mechanism, the specific capacitance and energy density of carbon materials are low.13–21 Common carbon materials include activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene and so on. Compared with carbon materials, metal compound materials have higher specific capacitance and energy density due to the pseudo-capacitance principle, but the conductivity and stability of metal compounds are poor.22–29 If the two materials are combined, the resultant composite presents both electric double layer and pseudo-capacitance energy storage mechanisms with a greatly improved specific capacitance and energy density.30–33
The formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is mainly through the curling of single or multi-layered graphene sheets, and can be divided into single-walled CNTs and multi-walled CNTs. Because of their unique hollow structure, high thermochemical stability and high conductivity, CNTs have been widely studied in supercapacitors, and their large pore size results in better rate performance of the electrode.14,34,35 In many studies, CNTs have been used to wrap metal compound materials, which can not only improve the conductivity, but also weaken the volume expansion of materials.36,37
Among various pseudo-capacitive electrode materials, transition metal sulfides have excellent redox reversibility and relatively high specific capacitances, but their poor electron transmission rate, volume expansion and thermal stability lead to poor rate performance and a short cycle life.38–40 Transition metal hydroxides have the advantages of high capacitance and redox activity due to their various-valence metals and open layered structure.41–43 However, the poor conductivity of hydroxides leads to poor cycling performance and low rate performance. For supercapacitors, the structure and morphology of electrode materials have a great influence on their capacitance performance, and materials with mesoporous structures and a large specific surface area can greatly enhance the redox reaction when active substances come in contact with electrolyte ions.44–48 If sulfides and hydroxides are prepared into hollow or flower-like structures, then the electrochemical performance of the two materials will be effectively improved. Also, the coating of sulfides with porous hydroxides can also be expected to reduce the volume expansion of sulfides.
In this work, a battery-type composite electrode material (Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH) was synthesized by coating hollow Co9S8 rods with acidified carbon nanotubes (aCNTs) and then embedded in a flower-like nickel–cobalt hydroxide (NiCoLDH) structure. The hollow Co9S8 rod with a mesoporous structure exhibits a high contact area with the electrolyte. The winding of aCNTs can weaken the volume expansion effect of Co9S8 and enhance the conductivity of the electrode. The flower-like nickel–cobalt hydroxide (NiCoLDH) further maximizes the specific surface area of the composite material and contributes to the overall capacitance. When used as an electrode material of asymmetric supercapacitors, the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH composite shows promising practical application potential in energy storage devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material preparation

Synthesis of Co9S8. 
Co9S8 was synthesized through a two-step hydrothermal process. In the first step, 1 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 8 mmol CH4N2O and 1 mmol KCl were dispersed in 40 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication for 30 min. The mixed solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and underwent the hydrothermal treatment at 90 °C for 10 h. Then, the precursor was washed with ethanol and deionized water under ultrasonication for 5 min and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. In the second step, 100 mg of precursor and 300 mg of NaS2·9H2O were dispersed in 40 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication for 20 min and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at a temperature of 180 °C for 8 h. Finally, Co9S8 was obtained by washing and drying as in the first step.


Synthesis of Co9S8–aCNT. 
Based on the synthesis of Co9S8, 80 mg of aCNTs (acidified carbon nanotubes) were added in a mixed solution, respectively, when synthesizing the precursor, and then were subjected to the same vulcanizing method to obtain Co9S8–aCNT. Co9S8–aCNT composites with a low CNT content of 60 mg and a high CNT content of 120 mg were also synthesized and marked as Co9S8–aCNT (low) and Co9S8–aCNT (high), respectively.


Synthesis of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. 
100 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 100 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 200 mg of CH4N2O and 20 mg of PVP-K30 were dispersed in a mixed solution of 15 mL of deionized water and 15 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then 100 mg of Co9S8–aCNT was added under sonication for 30 min, then the suspension was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at a temperature of 90 °C for 10 h. The product was washed with ethanol and deionized water and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH.

2.2 Material characterization
The crystal structure was determined using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) ranging from 20° to 60° with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), an operating voltage of 40 kV and an operating current of 40 mA. The Raman spectra were measured using a Horiba Raman spectrometer (He–Ne laser, 514 nm excitation). The microstructure of the material was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Sirion 200) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM 2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by a hemispherical electronic energy analyzer and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, which has a working voltage and current of 15 kV and 10 mA and a monochromatic Al Kα radiation of 1486.71 eV. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves were measured using an automatic gas adsorption analyzer (Autosorb-iQ-2MP), and then the BET method was used to analyze the specific surface area.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The test was carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, Shanghai Chenhua, China) with three electrodes: an Ag/AgCl electrode (reference electrode), a platinum wire electrode (counter electrode) and a working electrode, and the electrolyte used is 3 M KOH. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated before testing. The value of specific capacitance is calculated based on the total mass of the active material. Using the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test technologies, including a CV measurement range of 0–0.5 V, a scan rate of 2–100 mV s−1, a GCD measurement range of 0–0.5 V, and a current density of 1–10 A g−1. The EIS measurement was performed at a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz and by applying a 5 mV AC voltage amplitude. The specific capacitance (C) was calculated according to the formula: C = (I×Δt)/(ΔV × m), where m is the mass (g) of the active material, I is the constant discharge current (A), ΔV is the applied potential window (V) and t is the discharge time (s).
The activated carbon electrode (AC, negative electrode) and Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH (positive electrode) are assembled into ACS devices, which were fabricated by CR2016-type coin cells with 3 M KOH solution as the electrolyte and one piece of cellulose paper as the separator. According to the formula: E = CV2/2 and P = E/Δt, the energy density (W h kg−1) and power density (W kg−1) of the ACS devices can be calculated.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the preparation process of the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH composite. A hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the Co9S8–aCNT precursor with rod-like Co9S8 structures wrapped by CNTs. Then, the precursor was subjected to a vulcanizing process to allow the solid rods in the precursor to turn into hollow Co9S8 rods. The resultant Co9S8–aCNTs were then compounded with flower-shaped NiCoLDH structures to obtain the final product Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. The synthesis of hollow Co9S8 during vulcanization mainly depends on the Ke–Kendal effect, which was discovered by Ernest Kirkendall in 1947. This effect is now widely used in the preparation of hollow nanomaterials, and the hollow structure is formed due to the varied diffusion rates of different metal atoms on both sides of the interface.49–53 The schematic illustration of the Ke–Kendal effect in the preparation process is shown in Fig S1.† Since the hydrolysis of urea can produce OH− and potassium chloride can provide Cl− that has strong electronegativity, it is helpful in the formation of the Co9S8–aCNT precursor. In the subsequent vulcanization process, a thin layer of Co9S8 is formed on the surface of the precursor, the internal ions diffuse outward through the grain boundary of Co9S8 and further react with sulfur ions. The inner part of the precursor is gradually consumed and the outer layer Co9S8 is gradually thickened, resulting in the formation of hollow Co9S8 rods.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. 
X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2a) can further analyze the composition of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. It can be found that Co9S8 was successfully synthesized. Compared to pure Co9S8, some characteristic peaks of Co9S8 in Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH became less evident due to amorphous NiCoLDH that affects the characteristic peaks of Co9S8.54,55 The Raman spectrum of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH (Fig. 2b) shows the characteristic peaks of aCNTs and NiCoLDH, and the intensity of the characteristic peak of Co9S8 is relatively low due to the influence of NiCoLDH. The N2 adsorption–desorption curve of the composite was further analyzed (Fig. 2c) which exhibited the reversible type IV isotherms in Co9S8 and the composite, indicating their mesoporous structures. Compared to Co9S8, the pore-size distribution curves of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH (Fig. 2d) presented highly increased number of pores, especially in the range of 5–100 nm, which corresponded to the pores between CNTs/NiCoLDH and Co9S8. Before and after compounding, the specific surface area increased by over five times from 15.61 m2 g−1 in pure Co9S8 to 88.39 m2 g−1 in the composite, which declared the effect of CNTs and NiCoLDH in achieving a porous composite structure. The larger surface area is expected to improve the contact between the electrolyte and the composite and result in beneficial electrochemical performance.

Fig. 3 shows the XPS survey spectrum of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH, which proves the existence of elemental Co, Ni, S, O and C. There are four main peaks located at 777.6, 780.9 eV and 792.3, 796.6 eV in the XPS high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 4b), corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. Two satellite peaks were also found at 786.1 eV and 802.7 eV around the two main peaks. This proves the existence of Co2+ and Co3+ in Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 4c consists of two intensive peaks at 855.6 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 873.2 eV (Ni 2p1/2) and two corresponding satellite peaks at 861.5 eV (Ni 2p3/2 sat.) and 879.7 eV (Ni 2p1/2 sat.), which together confirm the existence of Ni2+ in NiCoLDH, respectively. The high-resolution S 2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 4d. There are two main peaks located at 160.7 eV and 161.8 eV, two satellite peaks were also found at 167.7 eV and 169 eV, which proved the existence of S in Co9S8. The high-resolution O 2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 4e. The peaks were observed at 530.4 eV(O1), 530.9 eV(O2) and 531.6 eV(O3), which can be indexed to the physically adsorbed molecular water, hydroxyl group and lattice O, respectively. The C1s peak is shown in Fig. 4f, which can be divided into three functional groups of C–C, C–O and CO at 283.7 eV, 284.3 eV, 285.3 eV and 288.6 eV, respectively. The existence of these functional groups plays an important role in improving the wettability of rGO in the electrolyte. The XPS results demonstrated the successful synthesis of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH.

The microstructure of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH was characterized by SEM. The micro-morphology of the precursor (Fig. 4a) is a solid rod, and Co9S8 obtained after vulcanization has a hollow structure (Fig. 4b). Through further enlargement (Fig. 4c), it can be found that the inner diameter of the hollow rod structure is about 200 nm and the outside surface of the rod structure is no longer smooth and has many irregular protrusions. The hollow structure and irregular protrusions can increase the surface area and the active sites for the chemical reaction. Fig. 4d shows the microstructure of Co9S8 further compounded by aCNTs. Compared to ordinary CNTs, aCNTs have better dispersibility (Fig. S2a and 2b†) and the structure is more uniform and orderly when compounded with rod-like Co9S8, which can also reduce the volume expansion of Co9S8. It should be noted that the concentration of aCNT has a great influence on the microstructure. When the concentration of aCNTs is low (Fig. S2c†), it is impossible for them to fully wrap Co9S8. In addition, a smaller amount of aCNTs provide low composite strength and fall off easily. When the concentration of aCNT is high (Fig. S2d†), although sufficient wrapping is realized, Co9S8 is not easy to be exposed, which affects its contact with electrolyte. Moreover, the thick aCNT layer makes the aCNTs on the surface layer fall off easily during a long cycle, which affects the structural stability. Fig. 4e and f show the microstructure of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH, in which NiCoLDH has a flower-like structure (Fig. S2e†) with a large specific surface area. The Co9S8 wrapped around aCNTs is embedded in the flower-like NiCoLDH, and the combination of the porous structure and the flower-like structure greatly improves the specific surface area of the composite. The EDX elemental maps of the microstructure in Fig. 4g–l show that five elements, Co, Ni, S, C and O, are evenly distributed, thus confirming their homogeneous combination.
The morphological details of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH were further investigated by TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). Single NiCoLDH has a flower-like structure (Fig. S3a†) and there are many folds on the surface. A very thin flower-like NiCoLDH can be found in Fig. 5a, and a rod-like Co9S8 exists in it. Upon further enlargement (Fig. 5b), it can be found that the hollow Co9S8 is inserted and embedded in NiCoLDH, and the tail end of the rod-like structure contacts with the outside, further confirming the embedding structure of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. In the HRTEM image, clear lattice fringes of 0.29 nm, 0.31 nm and 0.34 nm were observed (Fig. 5d), corresponding to the (311) and the (220) facets of Co9S8 and the (100) facet of aCNTs, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. 5e confirmed the polycrystalline characteristics of Co9S8, in which clear diffraction rings of (021) can be observed for Co9S8. Fig. 5f shows a dark-field image of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH. Through EDS analysis (Fig. 5g–j), it is found that Co, Ni, S, C and O are uniformly distributed, confirming their homogeneous combination. Both SEM and TEM images confirmed the embedded structure of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH that provides several advantages as electrode materials for supercapacitors, such as high conductivity, high porosity, large specific area and high structural integrity.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Co9S8, Co9S8–aCNT and Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH were tested using a three-electrode configuration. In the CV curves obtained at the scanning speed of 0.002 V s−1 and shown in Fig. 6a, obvious redox peaks appeared in all electrodes, corresponding to the Faraday reaction of Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ in Co9S8 and NiCoLDH. Of all the electrodes, Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH has the highest redox peak current and the largest curve integral area, indicating the beneficial effect of the proper concentration of aCNTs and the composite of NiCoLDH on the electrochemical activity and pseudocapacitance of the electrode. More obvious redox peaks are achieved for Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH than Co9S8 due to the synergistic effect of bimetallic Ni/Co in NiCoLDH and the addition of carbon materials, both leading to more active redox reactions. Besides, it can be found from Fig. 6a that the redox peak of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH is obvious at low scanning speeds, but weakened at higher scanning rates. This is caused by the accelerated electron/ion transmission rate and increased polarization at higher rates. In addition, as the valence state of sulfur is more variable in the electrode reaction, the reduction peak appears to be stronger than the oxidation peak.56–58Fig. 6b shows the Galvanostatic Charge and Discharge (GCD) curves of the electrodes at 1 A g−1, in which the longest discharge time of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH further proves its large specific capacitance. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) curves shown in Fig. 6c were also examined to study the conductivity characteristics of materials. In the EIS spectra, the lower the impedance, the higher the transfer efficiency, and the lower the interface resistance, the better the electron transfer ability. Inclined lines can be found in the low frequency region of all the curves, which represent the impedance of ion diffusion in the electrode. One can find that the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrodes possess a slope closer to the imaginary axis, indicating more active ion transfer behavior. The CV curves of Co9S8, NiCoLDH, Co9S8–aCNT and the final Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH composite were further explored from 0.002 to 0.1 V s−1 in the voltage range of 0–0.6 V. By examining the curves shown in Fig. S4a, c, e, g and i† and Fig. 6d, it can be found that each CV curve has a pair of redox peaks obviously, which indicate the battery-like behavior of Co9S8 and NiCoLDH. In particular, the shape of the CV curves shown in Fig. 6d was basically unchanged at enhanced scanning rates, proving good reversibility. Even at the maximum scanning rate, obvious peaks can still be seen, thus proving active ion transport at high scan rates. This was also in good accordance with the large slope of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH in the EIS curve shown in Fig. 6c. The GCD curves of Co9S8, NiCoLDH, Co9S8–aCNT and the final composite electrodes at elevated current densities were then measured and shown in Fig. S4b, d, f, h, j† and Fig. 6e. According to the specific capacitance values calculated based on the GCD curves, pure Co9S8 and pure NiCoLDH have relatively low specific capacitance values of 266.2 F g−1 and 850 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively, which can be improved obviously to 740.2 F g−1 in Co9S8–aCNT and 1185.5 F g−1 in Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH, implying the synergistic effect among the components. In particular, the optimum Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode continued to exhibit the highest specific capacitances of 1121.4, 1050.2, 980.7, 900.8, 798, 646.6 and 471.2 F g−1 at increased current densities of 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 20 A g−1, respectively, demonstrating promoted Faraday redox reactions in the electrode. Besides, the effect of CNT content on the overall performance was also studied by the electrochemical performance of different Co9S8–aCNT electrodes as shown in Fig. S5.† One can see that through similar CV shapes (Fig. S5a†), the Co9S8–aCNT (low) and Co9S8–aCNT (high) electrodes presented much shorter discharge times (Fig. S5b†), resulting in a smaller capacitance output as shown in Fig. S5c.† This result is also in good accordance with their inferior morphology as revealed by the SEM images. The cycling performance of the optimum Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode was examined at 10 A g−1 (Fig. S6†), which displayed a high capacitance retention of 86.4% after 5000 cycles. This demonstrated excellent cyclic stability, enabled by the stable Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH composite structure during cycling.

The excellent electrochemical performance of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH in the above comprehensive analysis is attributed to its special structure and the synergistic effect of Co9S8, aCNT and NiCoLDH. Firstly, the aCNTs provide numerous electronic passages and adsorb the volume expansion of Co9S8, which ensure the high conductivity and structural stability of the electrode. Secondly, compared to solid rod structures that can only allow surface ion exchange (Fig. 7a), the hollow structure of Co9S8 rods achieved a larger specific surface area and provided more ion transport channels both in and out of the rod (Fig. 7b). Thirdly, the flower-shaped NiCoLDH structure acted as a substrate for Co9S8–aCNT to further stabilize the composite structure and ensure effective ionic exchange between the electrolyte and the electrode (Fig. 7c). Moreover, the bimetallic hydroxide feature of NiCoLDH also provides more active centers for the Faraday redox reaction, largely contributing to the overall capacitance output.

In order to further explore the application prospects of the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated, in which Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH was used as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) was used as the negative electrode (Fig. 8a). As shown in the CV curves in Fig. 8b, the AC and the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode can exhibit stable potential windows of −0.5–0 V and 0–0.4 V, respectively, and therefore the ASC device based on the two electrodes can be expected to work in the potential windows of 0–1 V. The CV curve of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH//AC ASC showed roughly a rectangle-like shape, thus demonstrating the presence of electric double layer capacitances and pseudocapacitances. The shapes of the CV curves retained stability with no distortion at scan rates ranging from 0.002 to 0.1 V s−1, indicating fast and reversible redox reactions (Fig. 8c). The GCD curves of the ASC devices were then tested and the results are given in Fig. 8d. The Coulomb efficiency is 50.2% at the current density is 1A g−1. It can be found that Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH//AC ASC has the largest specific capacitance with values of 100.2, 91.65, 84.2, 74.7, 65.5, 59.2 and 56 F g−1 at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 8e). Note that the theoretical total capacitance of the ASC device relies on the formula of 1/Ct = 1/Cp + 1/Cn, where Cp and Cn are the specific capacitance values of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Therefore, the measured specific capacitance was acceptable considering that the negative electrode AC can only deliver a specific capacitance of around 107.2 F g−1 (Fig. S7†). Based on the charge–discharge curves, the Ragone diagram of the three ASC devices was plotted as shown in Fig. 8f to reflect the energy densities and power densities of the supercapacitors. The results show that a Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH//AC ASC outputs an energy density of 31.2 W h kg−1 at a low power density of 1111.6 W kg−1 and an energy density of 17.5 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 11250 W kg−1. In addition, we also compared the energy density and power density with other reported works, such as those using Co9S8//AC and NiCoLDH//AC, and the values of our work are among the highest ones than those reported previously.12,16,56,59,60

The cycling stability of the ASC device was studied at a current density of 10 A g−1. The results (Fig. 9a) showed that after 2000 cycles, 94.4% of the initial capacitance can be retained, thus implying excellent cycling stability. There is no significant shape change in the charge–discharge curves of the first 10 cycles and the last 10 cycles (the inset of Fig. 9a), which indicated highly reversible electrochemical reactions. The stability of the composite can be further confirmed by the morphology of the electrode after cycling. As shown in Fig. 9b, the SEM image shows that the repeated charge and discharge process did not change the microstructure of Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH, and no obvious collapse and aggregation can be observed. According to the EDX elemental maps, the five elements Co, Ni, S, C, and O are still evenly distributed without obvious element loss, further confirming the highly stable structure and composition of the electrode. Two ASC devices are then connected in a series to power a violet LED (Fig. 9c and d). After charging for 40s, the LED can be lighted for up to 15 minutes. A number of ASC devices are connected in a series to light up a “CUGB (China University of Geosciences Beijing)” pattern constructed by LEDs (Fig. 9e), thus demonstrating the excellent performance and promising practicality of the Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode.

4. Conclusions
Co9S8–aCNT–NiCoLDH electrode materials were successfully prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Compared with Co9S8, the specific surface area of the material has increased by more than three times. The intertwining aCNTs and flower-like nickel–cobalt hydroxide can effectively inhibit the volume expansion of hollow Co9S8 rods, which also increases the conductivity, increases the contact area between the composite and electrolyte, and accelerates the ion transmission speed. Due to its special structure and synergistic effect, the specific capacitance of the electrode reaches 1185.5 F g−1, with the capacitance retention rate as high as 94.4% after 2000 cycles. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated with this composite material, proving the practical application potential of this material.
