The effects of SILAR cycle numbers of n and m for CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs, as well as the influence of the co-sensitization of QDs on the energy conversion efficiency, are discussed. The results show that the deposition of co-sensitizer PbS QDs on CuInS2 QDs–TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrodes presents a complementary effect in light absorption. The performance of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) shows dominant dependence on the value of SILAR cycles n and m. The enhanced performance of QDSSCs with the cascade structure, PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 photoelectrode, is attributed to the Fermi energy level alignment of the QDs co-sensitizer. An energy conversion efficiency of 4.11% is achieved using the PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 photoelectrodes under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2).
1. Introduction
In recent decades, there has been an urgent demand to explore and develop environmentally friendly alternative energy because of the decline of fossil fuels and increasing pollution.1–4 Solar cells, as a kind of clean energy, have been paid more attention in research and application areas. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have developed rapidly over the past two decades. They combine both the advantages of organic dye photosensitizers and inorganic semiconductors, and have achieved a power conversion efficiency up to 13%.5 There are inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) besides the organic dyes, which can also serve as sensitizers based on quantum confinement effects. On the basis of quantum size effect, the optical band edge can be tuned by controlling QDs size, accompanied by an enlarged photoabsorption from the visible to near-infrared (n-IR) region.6 Furthermore, the high extinction coefficient could speed up photoinduced charge separation and reduce dark current.7 In addition, the impact ionization effect enables the quantum yield to be more than 100% through generating multiple excitons from single-photon absorption.8 Therefore, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are considered novel candidates for the third generation solar cells.
At present, owing to the suitable/compatible band gap and facile preparation, TiO2 with a band gap of 3.26 eV is one of the most commonly used photoanode materials for QDSSCs.9 The recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pair in QDSSCs is restrained because TiO2 cannot produce holes to combine the electrons due to large band gap. However, its wide band gap also limits the absorption range only to the UV region. Hence, different kinds of semiconductor QDs with narrow band gaps such as CdS,10–12 CdSe,13–15 InP,16 InAs,17 PbS,18 Bi2S3,19 and CuInS2,20–22 are induced to extend the activity of the photoelectrode into the visible light region. As a I–III–VI2 inorganic semiconductor compound, CuInS2 has great potential in solar cells due to high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), optimal band gap (∼1.5 eV), good photostability and low cost.23,24 Several efforts have been made to develop the synthesis methods, photoelectrochemical characteristics and applications of CuInS2 in solar cells. According to the study of Ren et al., the CuInS2 QDs with size ranging from 1.8 nm to 5.2 nm were prepared via a conventional convective heating method, which could be employed in the low-cost non-vacuum-based solar cells.29 Kamat et al. assembled CuInS2-QDSSCs with an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 1.14% via electrophoretic deposition and further increased the energy conversion efficiency to 3.91% by using CdS as a passivation layer.25 Teng et al. investigated the effect of QD sizes and counter electrodes on the performance of CuInS2-QDs/CdS heterostructure.26–28 They synthesized the CuInS2 QDs by a hydrothermal process and fabricated the QDs on TiO2 nanocrystalline followed by coating CdS. The as-prepared QDSSCs exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical performance due to the dual role of pillar and passivation layer of CdS.
Although many efforts have been taken to improve the performance of QDSSCs, the η is still extremely lower than that of DSSCs, which is mainly due to the junction between QDs and electron-conducting substrates and the defect density on the QD surface, as well as the difficulty of assembling semiconductor QDs into matrix. As an alternative, utilizing different kinds of QDs as sensitizers (i.e. co-sensitization) has been studied in the past few years. Lee et al. enhanced the η of QDSSCs to 4.22% by depositing the co-sensitizer of CdS/CdSe on the mesoscopic TiO2 films, which is advantageous to the electron injection and hole-recovery of QDs.35 Zhao et al. prepared the core/shell structured CuInS2/CdS on the TiO2 films and investigated the electron transfer from QDs to TiO2 by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The performance of QDSSCs was improved with the improved electron transfer by passivating surface states and tuning the band alignment of QDs.20 Recently, Shen and Katayama et al. studied the photoexcited carrier dynamics of co-sensitizer of double-layered CdS/CdSe QDs with heterodyne transient grating and transient absorption methods and they found that the η can be enhanced by 70% in the appropriate layer order and the reverse electron transfer does not matter for the energy conversion efficiency.36 Therefore, the co-sensitization is a promising approach to improve the performance of QDSSCs, and the key issues are to develop the suitable semiconductor QDs with suitable band gap and panchromatic light absorption range.
PbS, with a bulk band gap in the IR (∼0.37 eV), is a particularly interesting semiconductor material. Compared with CuInS2, PbS has low electron injection efficiency due to its lower location of conduction band edge than that of TiO2,30 while the conduction band edge of CuInS2 is higher than that of TiO2.21 However, PbS can extend the absorption range to ca. 900 nm which is larger than that of CuInS2 (ca. 600 nm).31,32 To take both advantages of the two materials in light harvest and electron injection, CuInS2 and PbS can be used as co-sensitizers of TiO2 film.
Herein, we prepare CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs via successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method sequentially to sensitize TiO2 nanorod arrays, and assemble a co-sensitized cascade structure. Influence of SILAR cycle numbers of n and m for CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs, microstructure and phase composition, and the co-sensitization of QDs on the energy conversion efficiency of PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 photoelectrodes are investigated by XRD, FESEM, XPS, TEM-SAED, UV-vis-NIR measurements and Electrochemical workstation equipped with solar simulator. The cascade structure has proved to possess excellent photoelectrochemical characteristics compared with single CuInS2 or PbS due to the synergistic effect and an energy conversion efficiency of 4.11% is achieved in this work.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Analytical-grade concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5%–38% by weight), cupric chloride hemipentahydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, 99%), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, 98%), lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2, 99%), zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%), sulfur powder (S, 99.5%), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 98%) and high purity indium chloride (InCl3, 99.99%) were purchased commercially and used as received. Titanium chloride (TiCl4, 99%) was purchased from Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of TiO2 nanorod arrays
TiO2 nanorod arrays were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using a hydrothermal method similar to the literature.33 Prior to the fabrication of TiO2 nanorod arrays, the FTO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned for 60 min in a mixed solution of deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol with volume ratios of 1:1:1, subsequently rinsed with deionized water, and finally dried in a nitrogen stream. 15 mL of deionized water was mixed with 15 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture was stirred at ambient conditions for 5 min before 0.3 mL of titanium chloride was added and then placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL volume) after being stirred for another 5 min. After that, one piece of FTO substrate was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon liner with the conductive side facing down. A reaction temperature of 180 °C was used, with reaction time lasting 2.5 h in oven. After synthesis, the autoclave was water-cooled to room temperature, and then the FTO substrate was taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air.
2.3. Fabrication of PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 electrodes
CuInS2 QDs were deposited on TiO2 nanorods with a modified successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method reported by Cho et al.22 The deposition was carried out at room temperature. TiO2 film was dipped into 5 mM CuCl2 aqueous solution for 10 s followed by deionized water washing, and dipped into 50 mM Na2S aqueous solution for 10 s followed by deionized water washing. Then the TiO2 film was dipped into 5 mM InCl3 aqueous solution for 10 s followed by deionized water washing, and 50 mM Na2S aqueous solution for 10 s followed by deionized water washing again. The four-step dipping procedure was termed as one SILAR cycle. The deposited samples were annealed at 500 °C in nitrogen atmosphere after several SILAR cycles which is different from the subsequent treatment process of Cho et al. The TiO2 nanorod sample after n cycles of CuInS2 deposition was denoted as CuInS2(n)/TiO2. For PbS QDs, the SILAR was used to deposit on the CuInS2(n)/TiO2 photoelectrodes as well. Briefly, the CuInS2(n)/TiO2 photoelectrode was immersed into 0.02 M Pb(NO3)2 aqueous solution for 30 s followed by deionized water washing, and then immersed for another 30 s into 0.05 M Na2S aqueous solution and washed again with deionized water. The two-step immersion program was termed as one SILAR cycle. After m cycles of PbS deposition, the sensitized photoelectrode was denoted as PbS(m)/CuInS2(n)/TiO2.
2.4. Fabrication of QDSSCs
The solar cells were assembled into a sandwich-type configuration by placing a Pt-coated counter electrode prepared by spin coating method on the QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode with a 60 μm-thick Surlyn sealing material as a spacer. The redox electrolyte used in this study was a polysulfide solution consisting of 0.2 M KCl, 0.5 M Na2S and 2.0 M sulfur in a mixture of methanol and water solution (3:7 by volume).34 The mixture combines the dissolving capacity of solvent and penetration to the working electrode. The addition of KCl improves the conductive capability of solvent.27 The active area of the solar cells was 0.5 cm2.
2.5. Measurements
The surface morphologies of the as-prepared samples were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6701F, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai F30, acceleration voltage: 300 kV) were used to explore the microstructure of the QDs. The structure and phase composition were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2400 X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα irradiation) at a scanning speed of 1.2° min−1. The chemical states of the elements in the samples were determined using a PHI5702 multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, USA). XPS analysis was conducted at 400 W and pass energy of 29.35 eV, using Al-Kα irradiation (1486.6 eV) as the excitation source, and the binding energy of contaminated carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV) was used as reference. The optical absorption was measured by a Spect-50 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jena, Germany) in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm. The photoelectrical conversion efficiency of the as-prepared samples was determined by a CELL-S500 (China) solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5 G).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 presents the FESEM images of various as-prepared photoelectrodes (a–c) and the corresponding 3D schematic diagrams of the photoelectrodes (d–f). Fig. 1a shows a typical top-view FESEM image of the plain TiO2 nanorods. The TiO2 nanorods with tetragonal crystal planes grow uniformly all over the FTO substrate with an obvious porosity between them. The cross-sectional view in the inset of Fig. 1a demonstrates that the TiO2 nanorods are vertically aligned and the length of TiO2 nanorods is about 2 μm. The surface of TiO2 nanorods becomes rough after the CuInS2 QDs deposition for 6 circles (Fig. 1b) and the QDs are uniformly coated on TiO2 nanorods. Fig. 1c presents the top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2. It shows that the CuInS2 QDs are aggregated on the top and side faces of TiO2 nanorods and the PbS QDs are uniformly deposited on the CuInS2/TiO2 photoelectrode. As a result, the surface of photoelectrode becomes rougher than that in Fig. 1b.

Fig. 2 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the plain TiO2 nanorods. It can be found that the diameter of plain TiO2 nanorod is around 130 nm (Fig. 2a). The SAED pattern (the inset in Fig. 2a) and the HRTEM image (Fig. 2b) confirm that the nanorods are single crystalline. The HRTEM image shows a (110) lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, and the nanorods grow along the (110) crystal plane with a preferred (001) orientation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum displayed in Fig. 4 also confirms the single crystalline nature of TiO2 nanorods, and the nanorods can be classified as tetragonal rutile phase (JCPDS file no. 21-1276) as all the characteristic peaks of TiO2 nanorods agree well with rutile phase.

Fig. 3a and b display the TEM images of PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2. The nanorod structures of TiO2 are not damaged during the CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs depositing process, and the QDs with a size ranging from 5 nm to 10 nm are uniformly covered over the TiO2 nanorods. Clearly distinguishable lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) verify the high crystallinity of the nanorods and QDs. The distance between lattice fringes is 0.32 nm and 0.28 nm, corresponding to the (112) plane of tetragonal CuInS2 (JCPDS file no. 27-0159) and the (220) plane of cubic PbS (JCPDS file no. 159-0592), respectively. In addition, the lattice fringe distance of 0.35 nm is corresponding to the (110) plane of rutile phase of TiO2. The SAED pattern of PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2, is consist of many single crystal diffraction spots (Fig. 3d). The diffraction spots are in messy arrangement for the quantity and density of the QDs. The inset of the electron diffraction pattern of a single QD, indicates the QDs are of high crystallinity, which is consistent with the analysis in Fig. 3c. More detailed TEM images of PbS(m)/CuInS2(n)/TiO2 photoelectrodes are shown in the (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the samples, where curve a–d represents the XRD pattern of FTO, TiO2/FTO, CuInS2(6)/TiO2/FTO and PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2/FTO respectively. Apart from the FTO substrate and TiO2 film, the rest of the diffraction peaks match well with the tetragonal CuInS2 (JCPDS file no. 27-0159) and cubic PbS (JCPDS file no. 159-0592). The diffraction peaks located at the diffraction angle of 27.9°, 46.2° and 54.9° are corresponding to the crystal planes of (112), (204)/(220) and (312)/(116) of the CuInS2 QDs. At diffraction angle of 54.9°, the diffraction peak widens obviously because the diffraction peaks of CuInS2 and FTO coincide with each other. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks at 25.9°, 30.1° and 43.1° can be indexed to the crystal planes of (111), (200) and (220) of PbS QDs. At diffraction angle of 25.9°, the diffraction peak also widens obviously as the diffraction peaks of PbS and FTO coincide with each other. The average diameter of CuInS2 and PbS can be estimated by Scherrer's equation, D = Kλ/βcosθ, where K is a shape factor equal to 0.89, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray equal to 1.5406 Å, β is the full-width at half maximum in radians calculated from the diffraction peak intensity and θ is the Bragg's angle. The calculation is done to get the average diameters of 9 nm for CuInS2 and 6 nm for PbS, respectively, corresponding to the TEM images in Fig. 3. Moreover, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has also been performed to investigate the surface composition as well as valence state of PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2. As shown in Fig. S2,† all the peaks correspond to Ti, Cu, In, Pb, S, O and C elements (in which the C element was used to calibration) can be clearly detected and their valence states are consistent with the corresponding standardized binding energies. Combined with the XPS analysis, it can be corroborated that the CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs are deposited on the surface of TiO2 nanorods successfully and there is no obviously impurities exist in the as-obtained PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 samples.

Fig. 5 presents the variation of optical absorption for the plain TiO2 nanorods and PbS(m)/CuInS2(n)/TiO2 films as a function of wavelength (CIS is short for CuInS2). A generally increased optical absorption is observed for the PbS(m)/CuInS2(n)/TiO2 films compared with that of the plain TiO2 nanorods, the absorption edge of which is only 400 nm. The deposition of CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs on TiO2 nanorods enlarges the absorption edges to 650 nm and 900 nm respectively, which confirms that the CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs can effectively improve the light absorption property of the TiO2 nanorods. The insets of a and b show the plots of (αhv)2 against photon energy (hv) for CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs, and the band gap of CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs is determined to be 1.58 eV and 1.15 eV respectively according to the long wavelength extrapolation of the band gap. Compared with that of the bulk CuInS2 and PbS, the band gaps of the two QDs all have changed, suggesting the presence of quantum size effect. Meanwhile, the band gap of CuInS2(6)/TiO2 and PbS(4)/TiO2 electrodes is also calculated (Fig. S4, ESI†), which indicates that the enhanced absorption in the longer wavelength region is due to the quantum confinement effect of the CuInS2 and PbS QDs. Moreover, the PbS(m)/CuInS2(n)/TiO2 films enlarge the absorption edge to 750 nm, greater than that of 650 nm for CuInS2/TiO2 films, indicating that PbS is a promising co-sensitizer for the CuInS2/TiO2-QDSSCs and the co-sensitized films (i.e., the PbS(m)/CuInS2(n)/TiO2 films) have complementary and enhancement effects in light harvest, which is similar to the case of CdS and CdSe co-sensitized TiO2 films.35

It is well known that the performance of QDSSCs depends on the SILAR cycles introduced to prepare the QDs-modified TiO2 films. Therefore, the influence of SILAR cycles on the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics is investigated. The J–V characteristics of QDSSCs employing CuInS2(n)/TiO2 photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding parameters as open circuit potential (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and energy conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 1. The inset in Fig. 6 shows the photos of CuInS2(n)/TiO2 photoelectrodes where the values of n are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 from left to right, respectively. It can be found that the JSC is enhanced with the increasing deposition cycles n of CuInS2 QDs on TiO2 nanorods, while the VOC exhibits a tendency of increasing firstly and then decreasing. The QDSSC with CuInS2(6)/TiO2 photoelectrode reaches the maximum VOC of 0.48 V and η of 2.61%. It could be concluded that the increasing quantity of CuInS2 QDs on TiO2 nanorods (the deepening color in the inset indicates the increasing quantity of CuInS2 QDs on TiO2 nanorods) raises the amount of semiconductor nanohybrid-heterojunctions consisting of CuInS2 QDs and TiO2, which increases the light absorption of QDSSCs and provides more channels for electron transportation, and enhances the collected photocurrent and energy conversion efficiency. However, for more deposition cycles (n ≥ 6), the aggregation of excessive QDs weakens or even dissolves the quantum size effect (Fig. S1b, ESI†), and it increases the series resistance of photovoltaic devices and the recombination loss of photogenerated carriers, leading to the decrease of energy conversion efficiency for QDSSCs.

Fig. 7 shows the J–V characteristics of PbS and CuInS2 QDs co-sensitized QDSSCs by depositing PbS QDs on the CuInS2(6)/TiO2 electrodes and the corresponding parameters of PbS(m)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 photoelectrode are listed in Table 1. The inset in Fig. 7 shows the photos of PbS(m)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 photoelectrodes where the values of m are 0, 2, 4, 6 from left to right respectively and the last sample is PbS(4)/CuInS2(0)/TiO2 electrode. The JSC and VOC of PbS(m)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 photoelectrode are in a tendency of first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing deposition cycles m of PbS QDs. The QDSSC employing PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 electrode obtains the maximum η of 3.47%. This is due to the fact that the increasing amount of PbS QDs on CuInS2(6)/TiO2 photoelectrodes (the deepening of color in the inset indicates the increasing quantity of PbS QDs) increases the co-sensitization effect and improves η. While too much PbS QDs depositing (m ≥ 4), similar to CuInS2(n)/TiO2, would lowered the quantum size effect and the high series resistance is predominant (Fig. S1d, ESI†). Moreover, the energy conversion efficiency of PbS QDs-SSC is only 1.35%, which was due to the weak driving force of electron injection for PbS QDs. The conduction band edges of CuInS2 and PbS for bulk phase are located above and below that of TiO2,21,30 and it is difficult for the photoexcited electrons to inject into the next energy level, which leads to the lower value of JSC, FF and η of single QDs sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes.

To understand the photogeneration process of the photovoltaic devices, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of QDSSCs assembled with various photoelectrodes measured from the ISC monitored at different excitation wavelengths are presented in Fig. 8. It is clearly seen that the IPCE spectra of the devices are all consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 5. Compared with QDSSC assembled with PbS(4)/TiO2 electrode, the QDSSC assembled with CuInS2(6)/TiO2 electrode obtains the IPCE value of 29%, higher than that of PbS-QDSSC, which suggests that the injection ability of photoexcited electrons for CuInS2-QDSSC is stronger than PbS-QDSSC due to its higher conduction band edge. Furthermore, the IPCE value as high as 45% obtained by QDSSC assembled with PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 electrode in the wavelength range of 380–750 nm indicates that the deposition of CuInS2 or PbS QDs systematically leads to higher external quantum efficiency, which is mainly due to the enlarged photoresponse range and enhanced photoelectron injection ability.

In order to further study the co-sensitization effect and the structure of QDSSCs, the PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 electrodes are prepared to investigate the effect of QDs co-sensitizers layers order on the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs. The J–V characteristics and corresponding parameters are presented in Fig. 9 and Table 1. The photovoltaic characteristic of QDSSC assembled with CuInS2(6)/PbS(4)/TiO2 electrode degrades dramatically compared with that of PbS(4)/CuInS2(6)/TiO2 electrode. The reason is laid in that the CuInS2 QDs between TiO2 nanorods and PbS QDs could enhanced the capacity of collecting excited electrons, and therefore, the co-sensitization effect is strengthened. However, the electronic transitions are restrained and the co-sensitization effect cannot be realized when the PbS QDs are deposited between TiO2 nanorods and CuInS2 QDs. It can also be determined that the PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 electrode is a cascade structure as the STEM shows in Fig. S3† which is similar to the CdSe/CdS/TiO2 electrode.35

Compared with QDSSCs fabricated with CuInS2/TiO2, the photoelectrochemical characteristic of the QDSSC fabricated with PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 electrode has some increment, which is attributed to the Fermi level alignment. Fig. 9a displays the energy level arrangement of TiO2, CuInS2 and PbS in bulk phase which can be found elsewhere.21,31,37 When the PbS QDs and CuInS2 QDs contact with each other and form the cascade structure on the TiO2 nanorods, the electrons will transfer from the high energy level to the low energy to achieve an energy balance because of the Fermi level difference, which is denoted as Fermi level alignment. The redistribution of electrons rearranges the energy level of TiO2, CuInS2 and PbS (Fig. 9b). The deposition of PbS QDs on the CuInS2/TiO2 electrode enlarges the absorption range and increases the photocurrent of co-sensitized QDSCs, which enhanced the photovoltaic characteristic of QDSSCs eventually. On the other hand, the presence of CuInS2 QDs between PbS QDs and TiO2 nanorods enhances the conduction band edge of PbS QDs relatively because of the redistribution of electrons, providing a more powerful driving force for the injection of photoexcited electrons into the next energy level. Hence the electrons density transferring to the FTO substrates is increased and the recombination of photogenerated carriers is restrained as well. As a result, the collected current of PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 electrodes is enhanced. Meanwhile, the cascade structure of PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 electrodes reduces the band bending at the TiO2 interface, which is benefit to the injection of photoexcited electron to TiO2. Therefore, the performances of photovoltaic devices are enhanced. Moreover, the EIS Nyquist plots of various photoelectrodes are measured and shown in Fig. S5.† The deposition of CuInS2 and PbS QDs could greatly and effectively improve the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Simultaneously, it could accelerate the interfacial charge transfer and electron injection process. In addition, the Mott–Schottky plot of PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 photoelectrodes (Fig. S6†) shows that the charge carrier density of photoelectrode increases with the deposition of CuInS2 and PbS QDs, which could lead to the upwards shift of the Fermi level, and the conduction band of CuInS2 and PbS QDs is enhanced relatively. Simultaneously, the enlarged band gap of QDs could enhance the conduction band of semiconductor QDs, which lead to the expected higher conduction band of PbS QDs coupled with the upwards shift of the Fermi level as shown in Fig. 9b. Overall, the cascade structure takes the advantages both of PbS QDs and CuInS2 QDs, achieving the synergistic effect, and increases the energy conversion efficiency eventually, which is the practical significance of co-sensitization effect.
To further improve the performance of the as-prepared photovoltaic devices, a ZnS passivation layer prepared according to the literature is used to retard the back transfer of electrons and protect the QDs from photocorrosion.38,39 The introduction of ZnS passivation layer could increase the VOC, JSC and FF, and the energy conversion efficiency η increases from 3.47% to 4.11% (Fig. 10, and Table 1). As previous studies reveal, there is no meaningful change in the UV-vis spectrum, but the dark current decreases after the deposition of ZnS, which indicates that the ZnS passivation layer as an effective intermediate layer between photoelectrode and electrolyte could suppress the electrons leakage from TiO2 to the electrolyte and avoid the direct electrons recombination in the interface of TiO2 and electrolyte, increasing charge collecting efficiency and energy conversion efficiency η.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a cascade structure of PbS/CuInS2/TiO2 electrodes with the co-sensitization effect is prepared with the SILAR method. The SILAR cycles of n and m for CuInS2 QDs and PbS QDs are discussed carefully and it is found that the performance of QDSSCs depends on the value of n and m dominantly. Moreover, the contact of PbS QDs and CuInS2 QDs on the surface of TiO2 nanorods can alter the energy level arrangement of TiO2, CuInS2 and PbS into an energy level order of PbS > CuInS2 > TiO2, which increases the driving force for electrons injection and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Under one sun illumination, the cascade structure obtains the maximum η value of 4.11%.
