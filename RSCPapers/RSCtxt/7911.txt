    , Accepted 24th July 2018First published on 25th July 2018AbstractQuantum dot based solar cells have attracted considerable attention owing to the unique geometrical, electronic, and optical properties of quantum dots. Exciton-delocalizing ligands, such as phenyldithiocarbamate, are demonstrated to benefit charge extraction in quantum dot-based solar cells. However, sufficient details of the exciton delocalization mechanism are still lacking. This work reports theoretical investigations concerning the role of the exciton-delocalizing linker for the ground- and excited-state properties of the Cd33S33 quantum dot. We perform density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory investigations of the Cd33S33 quantum dot functionalized with two hole acceptors: PTC–PTZ, a phenothiazine ligand with the exciton-delocalizing phenyldithiocarbamate linker, and BA–PTZ, phenyldithiocarbamate with the benzoate linker which is not an exciton-delocalizing ligand. Our calculation results find that PTC–PTZ has two binding modes: bidentate binding and flat binding modes, with the latter being more favorable. The phenyldithiocarbamate linker tends to delocalize the charge densities compared to benzoate. For all complexes, solvent increases electronic band gaps and makes quantum dot-to-quantum dot transitions dominate for the high-energy absorption band. Electron density differences between the excited state and the ground state suggest that the exciton-delocalizing PTC–PTZ molecule, especially the flat binding mode, would induce more significant charge transfer in the direction from the quantum dot to the dye.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials for photovoltaics, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and nanoscale photonics due to their size-tunable luminescence, pure color emission, solution processability, etc.1–4 Utilization of semiconductor QDs in solar energy conversion technologies strongly depends on the ability of QD-containing systems to efficiently separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs, or excitons, and further capturing and extraction of both carriers by other components of solar cells.5–9 It is necessary to emphasize that both charge carriers should be extracted from the QDs with similar rates in order to make electron–hole recombination less probable which could result from accumulation of either electrons or holes and thus limit the power conversion efficiency.10,11 It was shown that electron extraction from semiconductor QDs to various types of acceptors can be very facile and fast, occurring within a picosecond, even for acceptors physisorbed on QDs.12–16 On the contrary, hole extraction was demonstrated to be more challenging. Holes are more localized compared to electrons resulting in decreased electronic state overlap between QDs and hole acceptors.17,18 This was shown to be particularly true for Cd chalcogenide QDs, where reported time constants for hole extraction by physisorbed molecular acceptors vary from nano- to microseconds, thus being up to six orders of magnitude higher than for electron extraction.17–22 However, when the hole acceptors are bound to the QD surface by covalent bonds, the hole extraction times could be decreased down to several picoseconds, thus becoming very similar to those for electron extraction.23–25
In order to achieve similar rates of charge carrier extraction from Cd chalcogenide QDs, the hole extraction process must be accelerated even further to compete with hole trapping by QD defects (surface and in the bulk). This trapping was shown to be very fast, from picoseconds to subpicoseconds.26–28 To achieve this goal, the QD surface should be modified by covalent binding of molecules with desired photophysical properties, which was demonstrated to be a very attractive and promising pathway.29–35 Usually, molecules of phenothiazine PTZ (a well-recommended hole acceptor), are covalently bound to the surface of a CdS QD through the phenyldithiocarbamate moiety (PTC). PTC, in turn, binds to Cd2+ sites on the QD surface through its dithiocarbamate group CS2−. PTC and its para-substituted derivatives were experimentally proved to manifest large decreases in bandgaps and corresponding bathochromic shifts in the QD absorption spectra.29–35 Such bandgap decreases (up to 1 eV for CdS QDs)31 can be ascribed to exciton delocalization over interfacial states formed by mixing of PTC orbitals with the delocalized highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) states of the QD.35 Thus, the QD exciton becomes delocalized over states of mixed inorganic/organic character, and not over pure semiconductor states.29
Recent work by Weiss and co-workers demonstrated that chalcogenide-containing ligands, like PTZ, can bind to the QD surface by different modes.29,36–38 This, in turn, was shown to result in either exciton delocalization or trapping of charge carriers.29,36–38 Therefore, future studies involving delocalizing ligands like PTC should focus on the appropriate binding geometries of the PTC linker which would dominate the exciton delocalization. Previous experimental studies showed that the hole delocalizes upon binding of PTC ligands to the CdS QDs’ surfaces.30–32 Simulation of the exciton delocalization effect involves donor–acceptor coupling between QDs and PTC-linked molecules, and is a complicated electronic structure problem which has not yet been attempted.29 The details of the exciton delocalization mechanism in both QD-based functional materials and hole acceptor binding to the QD surface are still lacking. The need for theoretical elucidation of the exciton delocalization effect becomes increasingly important. Motivated by this, we decided to perform DFT and TD-DFT investigations of two model systems: CdS QDs with two hole acceptors, BA-PTZ (contains a phenyldithiocarbamate anchor) and PTC–PTZ (contains a benzoic acid anchor), in their anionic forms (see Fig. 1 below). We have studied the model systems with just one anion of the hole acceptor coordinated to the QD surface, focusing on the geometrical, electronic, spectral, and charge transfer properties of these model systems. In our studies, when investigating the structures of the bare QD and the molecule–QD complexes, we focus on the results obtained in vacuum because use of (implicit) solvent, such as CH3CN (see Computational details below), could significantly weaken the QD–ligand interactions, as revealed by Kilina and co-workers in their 2016 study.39 However, implicit solvent effects were demonstrated by Kilina and co-workers to be very important for the electronic properties of the QD studied,39 and thus, in our study we also use the implicit solvent when investigating the electronic properties of the QD–dye systems (vide infra). Our study is expected to give important insights into the surface chemistry of QDs with covalently linked hole acceptors, highlighting the important role of the EDL PTC-linker in the charge transfer processes.

The paper is organized as follows. First, the review of previous research is provided (see above), then the summary of computational details is given. Next, the structural features of the QD–(hole acceptor) complexes are considered. Further, we focus on the electronic properties of the QD–(hole acceptor) systems, followed by consideration of their spectral features. Finally, the conclusion and perspectives for further research work are given.
2. Computational details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.40 The QD–(hole acceptor) complexes (BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 and PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33, see Fig. 1) were optimized without any symmetry constraints in vacuum. We performed the structure optimizations and frequencies calculations using the following theoretical approaches: (i) the hybrid functional PBE041 with the Los Alamos pseudopotential and the corresponding basis set, LANL2DZ,42–44 for Cd atoms, and the split-valence polarized 6-31G(d) basis set45,46 for lighter atoms, this approach is subsequently referred to as PBE0/[LANL2DZ/6-31G(d)]; (ii) the dispersion corrected DFT functional wB97XD,47 again with LANL2DZ for Cd atoms and 6-31G(d) for lighter atoms, this approach is subsequently referred to as wB97XD/[LANL2DZ/6-31G(d)].
As mentioned in the Introduction section, in our studies we restrict ourselves only to structure optimization in vacuum because implicit solvents, like CH3CN, were previously shown by Kilina and co-workers to destabilize the ligand–QD structures and result in smaller binding energies.39 However, implicit solvent effects were demonstrated to be very important for the electronic properties of QD–ligand systems;39 we furthermore use the vacuum optimized geometries to study the electronic properties (molecular orbitals), projected densities of states (pDOS), and spectral properties of the isolated hole acceptors and QD, and QD–(hole acceptor) complexes both in vacuum and implicit acetonitrile (dielectric constant ε = 35.688) for the studied QD–(hole acceptor) complexes. The calculations with implicit solvent effects were performed using the self-consistent reaction field IEF-PCM method48 and the PBE0/[LANL2DZ/6-31G(d)] approach. The absorption spectra were calculated using the TD-PBE0 functional.49,50 The nature of the excited states contributing to the main absorption band was analyzed using the Multiwfn program.51
The binding energies (Ebind) of the dye–QD complexes were computed using the following formula:Ebind = E(dye–QD) − E(dye) – E(QD).Below we consider both the vacuum and implicit solvent results without the zero-point correction ZPE (ΔE0). Molecular structures and orbitals were visualized using VMD52 and GaussView.53
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural features of the QD–(hole acceptor) complexes
We focus on the Cd33S33 QD with a diameter of ∼1.5 nm (see Fig. 1) because it is the smallest cluster with a crystalline-like core. The vacuum optimized structures for the free Cd33S33 QD and free dyes BA–PTZ and PTC–PTZ are presented in Fig. 1a–c, together with the vacuum optimized structures for the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 and PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complexes, see Fig. 1d–f. All structures presented were optimized using the wB97XD/[LANL2DZ/6-31G(d)] level of theory. The structure optimizations were initiated from different starting configurations (monodentate, bidentate bridging or chelating). As can be seen, upon the geometry optimization for the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 compound only one binding mode was observed, the so-called bidentate binding mode (Fig. 1d) with the hole acceptor coordinated to the QD surface with its carboxyl oxygens, and for the PTC–PTZ molecule two binding modes were found: the bidentate binding mode with the hole acceptor coordinated to the QD surface with its thionyl sulfurs (Fig. 1e), and the flat binding mode where both the PTC and PTZ parts of the hole acceptor are partially aligned along the QD surface (Fig. 1f). Table 1 shows that both DFT functionals employed give QD–(hole acceptor) complexes with relatively high binding energies, ranging from −43.6 to −76.5 kcal mol−1. For the three cases considered, the wB97XD functional give higher binding energies compared to the PBE0 functional since the former includes dispersions and long-range corrections, which are necessary to take into account for these QD–ligand systems where relatively weak dispersion interactions between the QD and the ligand occur as well. Interestingly, with the PBE0 functional the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode is found to be unstable. In the bidentate bridging mode, it was calculated to be ca. 20 kcal mol−1 less stable than the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex (Table 1). This could be explained by the stronger interactions of the CO2− group with the QD surface compared to the CS2− group because of larger sizes and smaller charges of the S-centers vs. the O-centers. However, with the wB97XD functional this complex in the flat binding mode was found to be the most stable structure, with a binding energy of −76.5 kcal mol−1, ca. 5 kcal mol−1 more stable than the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex (Table 1). The preference of the flat binding mode for the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex can be explained by the higher PTC–PTZ ligand flexibility due to the presence of the NH-group in the PTC–PTZ ligand (Fig. 1c). In the following discussions, we will use the structure optimized with the wB97XD functional for calculations of electronic and optical properties of the QD–(hole acceptor) complexes.

3.2. Electronic features of the QD–(hole acceptor) complexes
Now we consider in detail the calculated electronic features of the QD–(hole acceptor) complexes. We start with analysis of the selected molecular orbitals, HOMOs−1, HOMOs and LUMOs, of these complexes presented in Fig. 2. Regarding the most stable PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex with the ligand flat adsorption mode (Fig. 2, bottom row), analysis of its HOMO−1, HOMO, and LUMO shows the following. (i) Both in vacuum and in the implicit solvent, the HOMO and HOMO−1 of this complex have noticeable contributions from the PTZ-moiety of the ligand and from the part of the QD to which the ligand is bound. It should be noted that in the solvent the contributions of the QD become more significant compared to in vacuum, thus, the HOMO and HOMO−1 become more smeared over the QD (see Fig. 2, bottom row left). Insignificant contributions from the PTC-moiety of the ligand could be seen. (ii) The situation is completely different for the LUMO: thus, in vacuum it has contributions only from the QD, from its part which is the most distant from the ligand (Fig. 2, bottom row right). In the implicit solvent the LUMO spreads all over the complex involving the ligand as well, even its PTC-moiety (Fig. 2, bottom row right). Comparison with the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode (middle row) shows some differences. For example, the HOMO in vacuum has contributions only from the ligand, mostly from its PTC-moiety, whereas this orbital in implicit CH3CN has contributions only from the QD, mostly from its part adjacent to the coordinated ligand (cf.Fig. 2 left and right, middle row). Noticeable differences could be seen between the HOMOs of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in two different coordination modes. In addition, HOMO−1 of the complex in vacuum is dominated by the QD contributions, and in acetonitrile, it has non-negligible contributions from the ligand PTC-moiety and its QD-component becomes more spread. Again, noticeable differences with the HOMO−1 of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode of the ligand can be seen. It is worthy of note that the LUMO of the complex now has noticeable similarities with the LUMO of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode of the ligand (cf.Fig. 2, middle and bottom rows).
 Fig. 2  The HOMO−1, HOMO and LUMO for: the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode (bottom row), the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode (middle row), and the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode (top row) calculated with the PBE0 functional in the implicit solvent (left) and vacuum (right). 
Whereas for the MOs of the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex, both the HOMO and LUMO have almost no contributions from the ligand, both in vacuum and in the implicit solvent (Fig. 2, top row). The LUMO becomes more smeared in the solvent, and the HOMO−1 of this complex has dominating contributions from the ligand BA-moiety, both in vacuum and in the solvent. The LUMOs of the three complexes considered demonstrate very close similarity in vacuum. In the solvent, there are similarities between the LUMOs of the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex and the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode.
Thus, from consideration and comparisons of the three MOs of all complexes we can conclude the following. (i) The implicit solvent has insignificant effects on the MOs of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode of the ligand and has no effect on the MOs of the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex. However, it has very noticeable effects on the MOs of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode. (ii) For all complexes, the LUMO is dominated by the QD contributions, and thus, the hole would be localized on the ligand upon the removal of an electron from the HOMO, in both vacuum and solvent. (iii) There is a very large difference in the HOMO−1 and HOMO compositions between the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex and the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex. (iv) For the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex, parts of the HOMO−1 and HOMO localized on the ligand are spatially located very close to the QD surface in both the vacuum and solvent cases, and the HOMO−1/HOMO charge density is delocalized over the dye/QD interface in the flat binding mode, which could facilitate the process of electron transfer from the ligand to the QD.
pDOS and electronic energy levels calculated for all complexes studied both in vacuum and solvent are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. We can see that all complexes have quite significant HOMO–LUMO gaps, from ca. 2 up to ca. 4 eV, which are increased in the implicit solvent. For example, for BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 the gaps increase from 2.16 eV in vacuum to 3.95 eV in the solvent, for the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode from 2.47 eV in vacuum to 3.95 eV in the solvent, and for the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat bridging mode from 2.43 eV in vacuum to 3.79 eV in the solvent. Interestingly, the implicit solvent has the smallest effect on the HOMO–LUMO gap of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat bridging mode compared to the same complex in the bidentate bridging mode and to BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 (1.36 eV, 1.48 eV, and 1.79 eV, respectively). In vacuum, there are noticeable gaps in the pDOS for the empty states after the first peaks corresponding to LUMOs (Fig. 3). In addition, LUMOs and higher-lying empty states in the vacuum are composed only of the QD states, and only around ca. 0 eV small contributions from the ligands appear (see Fig. 3d–f and 4). In the implicit solvent, LUMOs are mostly or completely composed of the QD states but the ligand contributions to higher-lying empty states appear much earlier than in vacuum (see Fig. 3a–c and 4). For the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode, however, the LUMO has quite significant (15%) contributions from the ligand PTZ-moiety, vs. 4% ligand PTZ-moiety contributions for the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode (Fig. 4b and c). On the contrary, in vacuum the HOMOs are composed only by or mostly by the ligands (see Fig. 3d–f and 4d–f) whereas in the implicit solvent the HOMOs become composed predominantly of the QD states. In vacuum the HOMO of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode has dominant contributions from the PTZ-moiety of the ligand and relatively small contributions from the QD, whereas the HOMOs of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode and the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode have dominant contributions from the PTC-moiety of the ligand and no QD contributions, which is in agreement with the MOs plots in Fig. 2.

 Fig. 4  The electronic energy levels: the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode in the acetonitrile solvent (a) and vacuum (d); the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the bidentate bridging mode in acetonitrile (b) and vacuum (e); the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode in acetonitrile (c) and vacuum (f). All computations were performed using the PBE0/[LanL2DZ/6-31G(d)] approach. 
Thus, the analysis of the pDOS, MOs, and the computed electronic energy levels shows us the important effects of the ligand type (PTC–PTZ ligand vs. BA–PTZ ligand), ligand binding mode (flat vs. bidentate bridging for the same ligand), and implicit solvent. The PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex has larger HOMO–LUMO gaps in vacuum but smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps in the implicit solvent compared to the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex. As shown in Fig. 3 and 4, the implicit solvent strongly stabilizes the states contributed by the PTC–PTZ ligand compared to those contributed by the BA–PTZ ligand. Moreover, the coordination of the PTC–PTZ ligand close to the QD surface causes stronger stabilization of the states contributed by this ligand in the flat mode compared to the states contributed by this ligand in the bridging mode. This could be qualitatively explained by easier polarizability of the PTC–PTZ ligand in general compared to the BA–PTZ ligand: in the latter, the COO− group could cause a shift of electron density toward itself, and in the former, the CSS− group is less electronegative and more polarizable itself. Moreover, the flat coordination/binding mode of the PTC–PTZ ligand results in its interactions with the QD surface and thus could make the ligand more polarizable, too.
3.3. Spectral features of the QD–(hole acceptor) complexes
The absorption spectra of the three studied complexes, along with the absorption spectra for the bare QD and free dye, calculated using the PBE0 functional and mixed LanL2DZ/6-31G(d) basis set both in vacuum and implicit CH3CN, are provided in Fig. 5. Analysis of the spectra shows that the absorption spectra profiles of all complexes have significant similarities in vacuum (one broad high-energy band around ca. 3.5 eV and a lower-energy shoulder at ca. 3 eV) and in the solvent (two broad bands, the higher-energy band located at ca. 4.1–4.2 eV and the lower-energy less intense band located around ca. 3.5–3.7 eV). However, the change from vacuum to the implicit solvent causes drastic changes both in the shape (see Fig. 5) and in the positions of the spectra (a blue-shift in the implicit solvent vs. vacuum). It should be noted that the well-separated absorption bands in the solvent provide good control of the excitation for the QD or the dye–QD complex. In addition, the spectra of all the three complexes both in vacuum and in the solvent are strongly red-shifted compared to the free dye spectra and cover the energy range very close to that of the free QD. Significant similarity could be seen between the free QD spectra and the complex spectra in the implicit solvent (see Fig. 5, left). For the implicit solvent complexes, both bands can be considered as associated with the QD (QD-to-QD transitions), whereas for the systems in vacuum, the higher-energy band can be considered as associated with the mixture of the dye and QD (QD-to-dye transitions). The lowest energy transitions of the functionalized QDs are optically dark, originating from either the optically forbidden QD-to-dye transitions or the QD-to-QD transitions with negligible oscillator strengths. Both in vacuum and in the implicit solvent, the spectra of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex in the flat binding mode are slightly red-shifted compared to two other complexes. Thus, the importance of the ligand coordination mode along with the importance of the implicit solvent for the complexes’ optical features can be clearly seen here.
 Fig. 5  The absorption spectra of the complexes (blue line) along with the absorption spectra of the bare Cd33S33 QD (green line) and the isolated dye molecule (red line). Isolated systems are calculated with the preserved geometry they have in the QD/dye composite. Left and right panels compare the spectra calculated in solvent and vacuum. For the solvent systems, the lowest-energy bands are associated with the QD, whereas for the vacuum case, the lowest-energy bands are associated with the mixture of dye and QD transitions. 
The nature of the excited states with the highest contributions to the main absorption bands of the dye–QD complexes was characterized using the electron density differences between the excited state of interest and the ground state, see Fig. 6. As the electron density difference map reveals, for the solvent case, the electron density difference spreads over the whole QD, with the dye molecules contributing more to the positive area of electron density difference in the PTC–PTZ dye case. Interestingly, the electron density increase/decrease is localized in space for the transitions in the vacuum case, in which the electron density exhibits a decrease at the bottom of the QD, whereas an increase at the top of the QD as well as the interface with the PTC–PTZ dye. In order to visualize the charge transfer (CT) more clearly, we calculated the centroids of charges associated with the positive and negative density areas. Although the two centroids show large superposition, the directional CT character was observed. In order to evaluate the extent of CT for the transitions of interest for the three systems considered, we calculated the CT parameters such as dCT, qCT, H, and t as proposed by Le Bahers and co-workers.54 The numerical values of these CT indexes are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Herein dCT denotes the distance of electronic rearrangement, represented by the spatial distance between the barycentres of electron density depletion and enhancement, see Fig. 7; qCT is the amount of transferred charge, obtained by integrating over all space; H is half of the sum for the centroid axis along the charge transfer direction; and t refers to the difference between dCT and H – if t is more negative, then large overlap between the electron density increase and electron density decrease is expected, which is unfavorable for charge separation. More details regarding these charge transfer indexes can be found in ref. 54–61. The centroids of the surfaces associated with the density increase confirm the occurrence of significant transfer of charge from the QD to the dye in both vacuum and solvent, with the computed dCT value being in the range 1.3–2.8 Å. The PTC–PTZ dye in the flat binding mode has the largest dCT for both absorption bands. The amount of charge transfer (qCT) allows us to quantify the volumes obtained for the electron density difference. The computed qCT is around 0.8–1.3 e. It is worthy of note that in vacuum the systems considered have a smaller dCT since vacuum tends to localize the charge density, making directional charge transfer less likely. Also, electronic rearrangement is larger for the lower energy band. In addition, the computed t values are generally larger in the PTC–PTZ–QD complex, especially with the flat binding structure, indicating that the EDL linker has the more complete charge separation. Overall, the analysis shown above indicates that the EDL linker with the flat binding mode would induce considerable charge transfer in the direction from the QD to the dye.

The green and purple colors denote increasing (positive) and decreasing (negative) parts of the electronic density during the excitation process, respectively.

4. Summary and conclusions
We have analyzed the differences of structural, electronic, spectral, and charge transfer excitation properties of a magic size Cd33S33 QD functionalized by EDL PTC–PTZ against non-EDL BA–PTZ hole acceptors using DFT and TD-DFT calculations. Our calculations show that there are two possible binding modes for the EDL PTC–PTZ molecule: the bidentate binding mode with the hole acceptor coordinated to the QD surface with its thionyl sulfurs, and the flat binding mode where both the PTC and PTZ parts of the hole acceptor are partially aligned along the QD surface with the latter being more favorable. Whereas only one binding mode was observed for the non-EDL BA–PTZ molecule, namely the so-called bidentate binding mode with the hole acceptor coordinated to the QD surface with its carboxyl oxygens.
The PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex has larger HOMO–LUMO gaps in vacuum but smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps in the implicit solvent compared to the BA–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex. The implicit solvent tends to delocalize the charge density distribution, facilitate the overlap of corresponding MOs. In the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex the flat binding mode makes the HOMO−1/HOMO charge density delocalize over the dye/QD interface, which could facilitate the process of hole transfer from the QD to the ligand. In addition, the solvent strongly stabilizes the states contributed by the PTC–PTZ ligand compared to those contributed by the BA–PTZ ligand. Moreover, the coordination of the PTC–PTZ ligand close to the QD surface causes stronger stabilization of the states contributed by this ligand in the flat mode compared to the states contributed by this ligand in the bridging mode.
Inspection of absorption spectra suggests solvent causes drastic changes both in the shape and in the positions of the spectra (a blue-shift) as well as the electronic transition. For example, solvent favors QD-to-QD transitions and suppresses QD-to-dye transitions. The lowest energy transitions of the functionalized QDs are optically dark, originating from either the optically forbidden QD-to-dye transitions or the QD-to-QD transitions with negligible oscillator strengths. The spectra of the PTC–PTZ–Cd33S33 complex with the flat binding mode are slightly red-shifted compared to the two other complexes. Thus, the importance of the ligand coordination mode along with the importance of the implicit solvent for the complexes’ optical features can be observed here.
The nature of the excited states contributing to the absorption band was characterized using the electron density differences. For the solvent case, the electron density difference spreads over the whole QD, with the dye molecules contributing more to the positive area of electron density difference in the PTZ–PTC dye case. Interestingly, the electron density increase/decrease is localized in space for the transitions in the vacuum case, in which the electron density exhibits a decrease at the bottom of the QD, whereas it shows an increase at the top of the QD as well as the interface with the PTZ–PTC dye. The centroids of the surfaces associated with the electron density increase confirmed the occurrence of significant transfer of charge from the QD to the dye in both vacuum and solvent. The PTZ–PTC flat structure was shown to have the more complete charge separation since it has longer dCT, large qCT, and stronger t. Overall, the charge transfer analysis indicated that the PTZ–PTC flat binding mode would induce considerable charge transfer in the direction from the QD to the dye.
It is worthy of note that the structural and energetic properties of benzoate-ligands have been discussed previously.62 The BA linker has demonstrated the potential to connect the molecule and the QD; this work shows that the PTZ–PTC with EDL linker would be more favorable for structural stability and charge transfer excitation between the dye and the QD. The number of ligands and different binding modes can change the obtained results.39,63 This work focus on the adsorption of one ligand with few binding modes, this is because the adsorption of more ligands will cause significant computational cost and is unfeasible for our current computational capability, and because the qualitative trend can still be obtained from the current work. Overall, the simulations performed in this work revealed the important role of the EDL PTC-based linker and provided information that cannot be accessed experimentally, which is expected to generate critical insights into charge carrier extraction in molecule–QD complexes, relevant for photovoltaics and photocatalysis applications.
