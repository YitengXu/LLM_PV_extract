    , Accepted 27th November 2021First published on 15th December 2021AbstractVanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are attracting increasing attention due to their promising prospect for large-scale energy storage. However, the high cost and low selectivity of current membranes limit their further application. In this work, a highly conductive (1122 mS cm−1) and stable microporous membrane was obtained via oxidizing a dense anion exchange membrane by an in situ or off situ process. Poly[(fluorene alkylene)-co-(biphenyl alkylene)] (PFBA-QA) with pendant quaternary ammonium alkyl groups was designed and prepared. The difference in stability between the main and side chains of the ether-free polymer allows the transformation of ion channels from aggregated ion clusters in the dense membrane to micropores by sacrificing the side chain in a strong oxidative environment. As a result, a VFB assembled with the resulting membrane demonstrates a CE of 97% and an EE of 88% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2, which can stably run for more than 290 cycles. This paper provides a new option for the membrane design in VFBs.
Introduction
With the rapid development of renewable energies and the continuous improvement of energy structure in recent years, large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) have been greatly promoted due to their contribution towards alleviating the instability and discontinuity of renewable energies such as solar energy and wind power.1–3 Flow batteries (FBs) are one of the most promising ESSs because of the unique features of high capacity and high power, which can be designed and regulated independently, high safety and long cycle life.4–6 Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs), possessing two pairs of vanadium redox couples (V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+) from the same parent molecules, which can avoid capacity losses from the ion crossover, have been one of the most mature FBs.7–11
As a key component of a VFB, an ion-conducting membrane (ICM) separates catholytes and anolytes, while transport ions complete the entire circuit.12 The selectivity and conductivity of ICMs significantly affect the coulombic efficiency (CE) and voltage efficiency (VE), respectively.12–16 ICMs of VFB are normally divided into ion exchange membranes (IEMs) and porous membranes. IEMs, including cation exchange membranes (CEMs), anion exchange membrane (AEMs) and amphoteric ion exchange membranes (AIEMs) have been widely investigated in FBs.17 CEMs, such as Nafion, carry ion exchange groups with negative charges, which are proposed to preferentially conduct protons in VFBs.13,18,19 Compared with CEMs, AEMs contain high-density positive charges in the ion channels, which are proposed to repulse vanadium ions via the Donnan effect and enhance the ion selectivity.20,21 AIEMs hold both positive charges and negative charges and could conduct both anions and cations and achieve high ion conductivity.22,23
However, one of the most critical issues of IEMs is their tolerance and stability under high acidic and oxidized conditions. The oxidation of VO2+ in an acidic environment is significantly increased, causing fatal and irreversible damage to the polymer structure, which seriously reduces the efficiency and finally leads to the membrane degradation.21,24,25 The stability issue is mainly caused by the ion exchange groups, which leads to the uneven charge distribution of the main chain and increases the risk of oxidization degradation.25 Alternatively, porous membranes conduct ions via the electrolyte in pores, which can utilize polymers without ion exchange groups and show very high stability in VFB.26–32 However, the porous membranes made by phase-separation methods generally have wide pore size distribution and twisty pore configuration, and the microstructure needs to be well controlled.29,33 A well-defined porous membrane with exquisite controlled nanopores has emerged as a next-generation membrane. The chemically partial etching process was induced into the preparation of porous membranes, resulting in the pores with precise control.34,35
Herein, we propose a simple strategy of fabricating the membranes with micropores via etching the side chains of IEMs, which contain an ether-free aromatic main chain and pendant quaternary ammonium alkyl side chains. In this design, the ether-free aromatic main chain favors the construction of highly stable polymers via uniform distribution of electrons induced by conjugated structures.36–38 The long alkyl side chains with ion exchange groups at the end could be corroded by off-line or on-line oxidization during battery operation, thereby leading to the transition from dense membranes to microporous structures. The transformation of ion transport mechanism found that ions especially protons prefer to transport via pores in the membrane rather than dense ion channels. The chemical degradation is actually a conversion of the membrane's internal structure, which dramatically increases the conductivity of the membrane to three-folds (1122 mS cm−1) and prolongs the cycle life of membranes. As a result, VFBs based on the microporous poly[(fluorene alkylene)-co-(biphenyl alkylene)] (PFBA-QA-p) membrane possess high efficiencies (CE = 97%, VE = 91%, EE = 88% at 80 mA cm−2) and stability (290 cycles).
Experimental

Fluorene (98%), tetrabutylammonium bromide (99%), dichloride and petroleum ether were purchased from Beijing Innochem Technology Co., Ltd. 1,5-Dibromopentane (98%), biphenyl (99%), and 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (97%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemistry Technology Co., Ltd. Trimethylamine (30% in water) was purchased from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. TFSA was purchased from Zhengzhou Alfa Technology Co., Ltd. KOH, MgSO4, H2SO4 (98%), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and diethyl ether were purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory. VOSO4 (99%) was purchased from Haizhongtian Chemical Reagent Factory in Shenyang, China. Nafion 115 membrane was purchased from Dupont and treated with H2SO4 and H2O2 successively.
Synthesis of 9,9-bis(5-bromopentyl)-9H-fluorene monomer (BBPF)
Fluorene (16.6 g, 0.1 M) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (3.2 g, 0.01 M) were dissolved in 1,5-dibromopentane (322 g, 1 M) in a 1 L round flask, and then, 200 g solution of KOH (50 wt%) was added into the flask under the protection of N2. The mixture was reacted at 95 °C under N2 flow for 40 min. Then, excess water was added and stirred for ten minutes. After standing for a while, the solution was stratified and the organic phase in the lower layer was collected, followed by drying with MgSO4. The organic solvent (1,5-dibromopentane) was removed by distillation after filtration, and finally, a yellow solid was obtained. A pure white solid was obtained by column chromatography (petroleum ether:dichloride = 10:1).
Synthesis of poly[(fluorene alkylene)-co-(biphenyl alkylene)] (PFBA-Br-0.4)
BBPF (2.32 g, 5 mmol), biphenyl (1.15 g, 7.5 mmol), and 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (1.54 g, 13.7 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL dichloromethane in a 75 mL pressure flask with magnetic stirring at 0 °C. Then, 10 mL TFSA was added into the solution and the flask was sealed, followed by stirring at room temperature for 40 min. After this, 30 mL dichloromethane was added into the bottle to dilute the slurry until the viscosity of the solution was high enough. Then, the slurry was poured slowly into cold ethanol. A white floccule was obtained and washed with ethanol, and 4.6 g of product was obtained after drying (92% yield). Other polymers (PFBA-Br-0.3, PFBA-Br-0.5, and PFBA-Br-0.6) were obtained following the above-mentioned procedure and changing the ratio.
Synthesis of QA-tethered polymers (PFBA-QA-0.4)
PFBA-Br-0.4 (4.00 g, 8.5 mmol Br), 30% trimethylamine solution (5.01 g, 25.5 mmol), and 50 mL DMAc were added to a 250 mL flask with stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The solution was slowly poured into diethyl ether and a white solid was obtained. Then, 3.55 g product was obtained after washing with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum (88% yield). Other polymers (PFBA-QA-0.3, PFBA-QA-0.5, and PFBA-QA-0.6) were obtained following the above-mentioned procedure and changing the ratio.
Microporous membrane preparation
The cationic polymers PFBA-QA-0.4 were dissolved in DMAc at 5.0 wt% concentrations. The polymer solutions were cast on a flat and dry glass plate and incubated on a heating stage at 80 °C for 5 h after filtration and degassing. A colorless, transparent membrane was obtained after solvent removal and cut into appropriate size. As VO2+ is a strong oxidative species especially in acids, which could cause chemical decomposition of polymers, a microporous structure can be obtained via off-line oxidation etching by immersing PFBA-QA-0.4 in 1.5 M VO2+ and 3 M H2SO4 at 40 °C for 240 h. Similarly, oxidation etching can be carried out by an online process that assembled into a VFB cell and the micropores were formed via a charge and discharge process. The microporous membranes obtained by either an online (more than 150 cycles) or an off-line method have similar characteristics and abbreviated as PFBA-QA-p.
Chemical structure
All chemical structures of polymers were characterized using a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR, AVANCE III 400 MHz). First, 5 mg sample of polymers was dissolved into DMSO-d6 in NMR tubes for further tests.
Microscopy of membranes
The surface morphology of PFBA-QA-x membranes was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU1510 from Hitachi). The PFBA-QA-x samples were cut into pieces and adhered to the conductive tape before coating with gold. The hydrophilic channels derived from phase separation were determined using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Cypher from Asylum Research) with a probe of NANOWORLD Silicon SPM-Sensor and 0.7–2.0 MHz resonance frequency. Before testing, PFBA-QA-x membranes were cut into pieces and adhered to a glass sheet.
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
The size of the ion channels was tested by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, Saxes M2 from Anton Paar) and the scan range is 0.05° to 6°. The PFBA-QA-x membranes were treated with ultrapure water for 24 h before testing. The exposure time and average time were 120 s and 2 s respectively. The scattering vector was calculated as follows:q = 2πsinθ/λwhere θ is the scattering angle and λ is the scattering wavelength.
The diameter of the ion channels was calculated as follows:  
Water uptake and swelling ratio
The water uptake and swelling ratio of PFBA-QA-x membranes in deionized water were measured at room temperature. After drying using a vacuum oven, the membranes were immersed in water to absorb enough water, and excess water on the surface was removed from the surface using filter paper. The water uptake (WU) was calculated as follows:  where mW and md are the masses of the hydrated and dry PFBA-QA-x membranes, respectively. The swelling ratio (SR) was calculated as follows:  where lW and ld are the lengths of the hydrated and dry PFBA-QA-x membranes, respectively.
Vanadium ion permeability
A diffusion device fabricated with two 80 mL half cells and a PFBA-QA-x membrane (the effective area is 3 cm × 3 cm) was used to demonstrate the vanadium resistance of the membrane. Two half cells were filled with 1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 and 1.5 M MgSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 respectively to minimize the influence of osmotic pressure. Then, 3 mL of the solution was extracted at regular intervals, while extra 3 mL original solution was added back from the side of MgSO4 under the condition of constant stirring to ensure a uniform concentration. An UV-vis spectrometer (TU-1901, Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd.) was used to detect the concentration of V(IV). The vanadium permeability of membrane was calculated as follows:  where V is the volume in the MgSO4 side, C2(t) is the concentration of VO2+ in the MgSO4 side, C1 is the concentration of VO2+ in the VOSO4 side, and L and A are the thickness and effective area of the membrane.
Permeability of H2
The change in the porosity of the membrane can be confirmed by hydrogen permeability. The membrane is fixed in a sandwich mold with cavities on each side and the effective area is 10.8 cm2. Two ports of the mold are respectively connected with the entrance and exits of nitrogen and hydrogen and make the exits connected to a gas chromatograph (GC, GC-2014 from Shimadzu). The flux of hydrogen and nitrogen was set to 37 mL min−1. The permeability of H2 was calculated as follows:  where C (cm3 cm−2 min−1) is the permeability of H2, q is the permeability of H2 in one minute and S is the efficient area of the membrane.
Area resistance and conductivity
A four-probe method was used to test the area resistance and conductivity of the PFBA-QA-x membrane. Two L-shaped cells sandwiched a membrane (effective area is 2.01 cm2) to contrast such a device. Electrochemical parameters of the membrane were detected using a Gamry 1000.
The area resistance (RA) was calculated as follows:RA = (Rm − R0) × Awhere Rm is the resistance of the cell with the membrane, R0 is the resistance of an empty cell with 3 M H2SO4 and A is the effective area. The conductivity of the PFBA-QA-x membrane was calculated as follows:  where σ (S cm−1) and h (cm) are the conductivity and thickness of the membrane.
Ion transport number (ITN)
Ion transport numbers of membranes was measured by a four-electrode method. Different concentrations (0.11 M to 0.33 M, 0.33 M to 1 M and 1 M to 3 M) of KCl, HCl, and H2SO4 solutions were placed into two L-shaped cells separated with PFBA-QA-x membranes. The different concentrations of each solution were tested three times respectively to take the average value to reduce the error. The ion transport numbers of membranes were calculated as follows:  t− + t+ = 1where V0 is the voltage as current is 0, t+ and t− are the ion transport numbers of the cation and anion, respectively, Z+ and Z− are the valences of the cation and anion, ΔC is the concentration gradient of two cells, γ±high and γ±low are the activity coefficients of the cation/anion at high/low concentrations, k is the Boltzmann constant (k = 1.38 × 10−23) and e is the elementary charge (e = 1.6 × 10−19).
Battery performance
A VFB cell fabricated with two stainless-steel endplates, a carbon felt (3 cm × 3 cm effective area and 5 mm thick), a carbon current collector and a PFBA-QA-x membrane were employed to estimate the electrochemical performance. There are two tanks containing 30 mL electrolyte, which consists of 1.5 M V(III)/V(IV) and 3 M H2SO4. As the electrolyte cyclically pumped into the two half cells separated by a PFBA-QA-x membrane respectively, the charging and discharging process and cell performance were supervised using an Arbin BT2000. The cut-off voltages were set from 1.65 to 0.8 V to avoid corrosion of electrodes. CE, VE and EE were used as parameters to evaluate the battery performance which can be calculated as follows:      
Results and discussion
In order to introduce the micropores in membranes, specific sites were etched to obtain the micropores without damaging the backbone of the membrane, and the design of the polymer structure is particularly critical. Normally, for a polymer with side chains, the destruction of the main chains is fatal to the structural stability of membranes, yet the pendant ammonium group degradation remains unchanged in macroscopical morphology. Therefore, a chemically stable ether-free PFBA main chain was designed in this work to maintain the dimensional stability of the membrane (Fig. 1a).36 A long alkyl chain was used to link the ion exchange group to reduce the influence of ion exchange groups on the stability of the main chain.39–41 Hence, poly[(fluorene alkylene)-co-(biphenyl alkylene)] (PFBA-QA-x) was synthesized by a typical superacid-catalyzed polycondensation reaction as reported before.37

The chemical structure of PFBA-QA-x (x = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6) polymers was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S3–S6†). All signals from the aromatic backbone were found from 7.0 to 8.0 ppm, while signals from alkane of the side chain were observed at 3.2 ppm, 3.1 ppm, 2.0 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm, and 0.6 ppm and that of trifluoroacetone on the backbone was observed at around 2.0 ppm, respectively. Quarterization was executed under ambient conditions using trimethylamine, and transparent IEMs were obtained by solution casting with a thickness of 45 ± 5 μm. A series of membranes with different IECs (PFBA-QA-x) were synthesized for optimization.
The microporous membrane can be obtained by oxidizing the unstable side chains of PFBA-QA-x (x = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) at both online and off-line methods. The chemical stability of the membrane in harmful environment was evaluated before the preparation of micropores by complete oxidation. The off-line oxidized was executed under 1.5 M VO2+ in 3 M H2SO4 solution at 40 °C, and such strong oxidizing condition is always used to evaluate the chemical stability of membrane.20,21,24,25 In order to observe the change more intuitively, a low concentration oxidation test of VO2+ was executed with 0.15 M VO2+ solution. As can be seen in Fig. 2a and b, the concentration of VO2+ was positively correlated with the treatment time for all PFBA-QA-x. After 120 h of immersion in oxidative solution, the obvious color change of the solution could be observed caused by the reduction of VO2+ to VO2+ (Fig. 2c). The higher the IEC of the membranes, the more serious the oxidation, suggesting that the oxidation may come from the degradation of the side chain.38 Surprisingly, the chemical degradation is slower at high concentrations (1.5 M) than at low concentrations (0.15 M). The reason may be the high osmotic pressure at high concentrations, which dehydrates the membrane ion channel and reduces the contact with the oxidative solution.42,43 It is worth noting that the degradation of the side chain can facilitate the transformation of the membrane from highly dense to microporous. The ion exchange groups anchored on the main chain are etched in an oxidizing environment and then detached from the main chain, resulting in the form of the micropores and PFBA-QA-p was obtained for further use in the oxidation stability test. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, PFBA-QA-p is more stable than PFBA-QA-x (x = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6). With the detachment of the side chains, only the ether-free main chain was left which makes the stability comparable to Nafion 115 in a strong oxidation environment.

For the online oxidation method, the original film is oxidized in situ to a microporous membrane through the charge/discharge process. PFBA-QA-0.4 was selected for structural comparison before and after oxidation treatment. Compared with the pristine PFBA-QA-0.4 membrane, both water uptake and swelling ratio of PFBA-QA-p are greatly reduced, which is attributed to the detachment of the ion exchange groups on the side chain from the main chain (Table 1). The NMR signal retention of pendant ammonium groups after different charging/discharging cycles was recorded to evaluate the structure–activity relationship between the configuration of the membrane and battery performance (Fig. 1b and c). With the repeated charging and discharging process, the side chain decays continuously and the side chain decays almost completely after implementing 150 charge/discharge cycles. As shown in Fig. 1b, the integration ratio of the signal Hd, He, Hf, Hg, Hh and Hi significantly decreases, and these signals are assigned to the side chain. Therefore, the degradation mechanism of the side chain involves the elimination of the N,N,N-trimethylpentan-1-aminium groups through being attacked by pentavalent vanadium ions VO2+.25 The slight signal decay at 7 ppm to 8 ppm corresponded to Ha, Hb, and Hc on fluorene. A model compound was synthesized and treated with 1.5 M VO2+ to figure out the signal decay of Ha, Hb, and Hc. A side reaction, the electrophilic substitution of bromine, was confirmed by the characterization of 1H and mass spectrometry (Fig. S10–S12†). In addition, no new peaks were observed in the polymer, indicating that the backbone was well preserved. A slight decrease in tensile strength (10.3 to 7.0 MPa) and elongation at break (39.9% to 38.1%), which does not obviously affect the mechanical properties of the membrane, can be seen from Table 1.

The phase separation of PFBA-QA-x and the transition of the hydrophilic channel to micropores was observed from AFM image (Fig. 3a and b). As shown in Fig. 3a hydrophilic clusters with low content of ion exchange groups are smaller and more isolated on the surface of membranes. With a higher IEC, hydrophilic clusters tend to connecting with each other, and a part of the clusters aggregate to form continuous hydrophilic channels. High IEC results in an introduction of more hydrophilic channels and large hydrogen-bonding networks into the membranes.44 More free water in the membrane could benefit ion transport.45,46 After side chain degradation, the phase separation of PFBA-QA-p fades compared to the pristine PFBA-QA-0.4, indicating that the pendant ammonium groups were detached from main chains and induced cavity, i.e. micropores, yet it cannot be clearly observed in the AFM images of PFBA-QA-p.
 Fig. 3  (a) Phase images of PFBA-QA-x and PFBA-QA-p. (b) Height images of PFBA-QA-x and PFBA-QA-p. 
The morphological changes before and after oxidation etching can also be determined by TEM images (Fig. 4a and b). The dark spots in Fig. 4a and b are attributed to PdCl42− clusters interacting with ammonium groups by oppositely charge attraction. As for PFBA-QA-0.4, there are obvious PdCl42− clusters aggregating discretely, which indicated the position of ion channels. In contrast, the dark spots of PFBA-QA-p severely reduced to an almost unobservable form, meaning the pendant ammonium groups exhausted. The transition process from a dense ion exchange membrane to micropores can also be demonstrated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The scattering intensity of the PFBA-QA-0.4 membrane after oxidative treatment was located at q = 2.9 nm−1. The d-spacing (d = 2π/q) of ion channels was calculated as 2.1 nm (Fig. 5a). Although the ion channels appear larger than pentavalent vanadium ions, the calculation by scattering vector only represents the size of the region with density variation; nevertheless, it is not the effective pore size of the membrane after degradation. Considering that the polymer skeleton occupies a specific space, the effective pore size should be smaller than this value. The generation of the micropore structure can also be confirmed by a hydrogen gas permeation test. In Fig. 5b, dry membranes with different IEC were put into the hydrogen permeability experiment. The permeation of H2 of the PFBA-QA-x membrane was around 0.001 cm3 cm−2 min−1 and increases slightly with the increase in the proportion of ion exchange groups. This might be due to the aggregation of ion exchange groups, causing a weaker hindrance to H2 of the PFBA-QA-x membrane. Obviously, the hydrogen permeability of the PFBA-QA-p reached 0.004 cm3 cm−2 min−1, which is nearly four-folds the pristine one. The hydrogen permeability test can explain the transformation of macroscopic properties caused by the change in the microstructure of the membrane. Moreover, there are no cracks or defects for PFBA-QA-p in the SEM image (Fig. S9†).

The ion conductivity of membranes after detaching the ion exchange groups was investigated, which increased from 352 to 1122 mS cm−1 (Table 1). The degradation of the pendant ammonium groups causes the loss of functional groups, resulting in a change in the ion conductivity. The promoted ion conductivity of PFBA-QA-p was attributed to micropores. As shown in Table 2, the water uptake of PFBA-QA-x increased from 33.3% to 110.5% when the IEC values increased from 1.80 to 2.92 meq g−1 at 25 °C. Correspondingly, swelling ratios positively correlated with water uptake increasing from 12.2% to 31.7%.

The formation of micropores could possibly lead to the transformation of the ion-transport mechanism across PFBA-QA-p. KCl was utilized as a probe salt to characterize the charge of the membrane, since the mobility of K+ and Cl− is similar. The ion transport number (ITN) of Cl− (tCl−) is larger than 0.5, suggesting that the membranes are positively charged. With the increase in ion exchange groups in the membrane, the tCl− decreased from 0.89 to 0.66, whereas the transport number of K+ (tK+) increased from 0.11 to 0.34 (Fig. 6a), demonstrating a weakening of the Donnan effect, which contradicts with the increase in IEC due to the more and more connected clusters of the membranes. This phenomenon is consistent with the previous discussion of phase separation and pore sizes at different IECs. Oversized ion channels can enhance the proton conductivity, however, they are obviously unbeneficial to the selectivity of membranes. Furthermore, with KCl gradually increasing from 0.11 mol L−1 to 0.33 mol L−1, the anion/cation selectivity of the membranes decreases (tCl− decreased from 0.89 to 0.80 vs. tK+ increased from 0.11 to 0.20 of PFBA-QA-0.3), indicating that the Donnan effect is still weakened at high concentration and this trend was also confirmed in PFBA-QA-0.4, PFBA-QA-0.5, and PFBA-QA-0.6. Such anomaly indicated that the microphase is also influenced by IEC. The final counter ion/co ion selectivity is the combined influence of the Donnan effect and the size of ion channels. However, there is a thoroughly different transport behavior of ions in PFBA-QA-p. The tCl− in PFBA-QA-p decreased from 0.73 to 0.58, whereas tK+ increased from 0.27 to 0.42 under the same conditions (Fig. 6b). The transport behavior of Cl− and K+ in PFBA-QA-p is approximately equal, consistent with the transformation of ion channels from aggregated ion clusters to micropores. Ion transport is no longer dominated by pendant ammonium groups but driven by the concentration of the solution and the intrinsic properties of themselves.17 The Donnan membrane equilibrium weakened and the effect of size exclusion gradually participates in the process of ion transport, since the side chains detached from the backbone and the micropores were formed accordingly.

The transport mechanism of cations and anions in the membrane is more inclined to it in a porous membrane, and this trend was also evident in HCl and H2SO4 solutions respectively (Fig. S14 and S15†). In HCl, tCl− decreased from 0.19 to 0.15 and ITN of protons increased from 0.81 to 0.85 as the transport rate of protons is much higher than that of Cl− together with the weakening of the Donnan repulsion of the membrane by the loss of the ion exchange groups, because more protons are conducted and the membrane porosity is increased. The ion conductivity of the membrane after etching the side chains increases from 352 mS cm−1 to 1122 mS cm−1. As the ion-exchange groups anchored on the end of the side chain detaching from the main chain, the conductivity of the membrane improved, due to the formation of micropores containing electrolyte. The emergence of micropores leads to a change in the mechanism of ion transport in the membrane.
A VFB single cell was assembled to evaluate the performance of different membranes, as shown in Fig. 7. VFB cells assembled with the PFBA-QA-0.3, PFBA-QA-0.4 and PFBA-QA-0.5 membranes exhibited higher CE (>95%) than Nafion 115 (93% at 80 mA cm−2), due to the lower vanadium permeability (Fig. 8a and b). Combined with the vanadium permeability test, PFBA-QA-0.3, PFBA-QA-0.4 and PFBA-QA-0.5 membranes show the same trend of vanadium permeability with CE, whereas PFBA-QA-0.6 has a higher vanadium permeability and a lower CE than Nafion 115, probably due to an excessive swelling degree under electric field (Table 2). In terms of PFBA-QA-p, the degradation of the side chain with a positive charge leads to a decay of the Donnan effect, thus, a weak resistance to vanadium ions results in a slight increase in vanadium ion crossover (CE = 98% to 97%), but it was still significantly better than Nafion 115. Higher ionic conductivity of membranes may lead to higher VE, the VFB cell with PFBA-QA-0.5, PFBA-QA-0.6 especially PFBA-QA-p exhibits higher VE (>90%) than Nafion 115 (89%). In addition, PFBA-QA-0.4, PFBA-QA-0.5 and PFBA-QA-p show the best performance (EE > 87%). The cell performances of PFBA-QA-p and PFBA-QA-0.4 are similar; however, PFBA-QA-p and PFBA-QA-0.4 undergo completely different ion transport mechanisms.

As a typical membrane possess the highest EE among all IEC, the cyclic stability of PFBA-QA-p obtained by oxidation etching from PFBA-QA-0.4 was investigated. A long-term VFB cycle stability testing was carried out on a VFB with PFBA-QA-p (off-line oxidation for 240 h in 1.5 M VO2+) at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. The cell showed a stable performance after more than 290 cycles (Fig. 8d). PFBA-QA-p was obtained by online oxidation and its cyclic stability was evaluated, as shown in Fig. 8c (>320 cycles). The cycling stability of PFBA-QA-p is attributed to the transformation of ion channels from aggregated ion clusters to micropores. After the oxidation experiment, the membrane kept its integrity, suggesting that the polymer skeleton preserved (Fig. S8†). It shows that the formation of micropores changes the micromorphology of the membrane and thus changes the ion transport mechanism, which means that a partial degradation is not equivalent to the decay of cell performance.
Conclusion
Overall, a microporous membrane PFBA-QA-p with stable ether-free aromatic main chains has been synthesized by etching unstable side chains. The difference in chemical stability of the main chains and the side chains achieves the microstructural transformation of the membrane from aggregated ion clusters to micropores under oxidative condition. The efficiency of the VFB cell based on PFBA-QA-p membranes by an off-line oxidation was similar to the online one (CE = 98% to 97%, VE = 91% to 90%) and the energy efficiency was retained above 88% in 290 cycles. This microstructure transition induced by in situ etching does not require any pretreatment resulting in a slight fluctuation in the cell performance, a higher VE and a lower CE. Generally, oxidation-induced degradation of polymers is always unfavorable for membranes in VFB cells; however, the proposed concept of side chain sacrifice could lead to various types of pores in membranes and broaden the research on the stability of the membrane. As a few ion exchange membranes thrive in the VFB, this strategy provides a new opportunity for the unstable moiety under extreme conditions and matching with the stable main chain is expected to turn over a new leaf in the EES.
