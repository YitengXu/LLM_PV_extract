    , Accepted 16th May 2022First published on 16th May 2022AbstractA composite cluster with core–shell structure composed of polyoxometalates (POMs) and graphdiyne (GDY) was synthesized and applied for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with the original POMs and GDY, the composite cluster Co4(PW9)2@GDY demonstrates superior performance and stable electrochemical OER. The core–shell composite cluster exhibited high performance for OER with low potentials and a small Tafel slope. Moreover, high catalytic activity of the cluster was achieved at a high current density. Co4(PW9)2@GDY has excellent catalytic performance and long stability due to its strong electron-transfer ability in the system, higher conductivity, and the structural advantage of pores in GDY. We also tested the OER synergism mechanism between POM and GDY. This would open access and guide us to synthesize novel clusters based on polyoxometalates and graphdiyne.
1. Introduction
With the increase of industry, energy resources have become an increasingly prominent conflict between economic growth and the environment in the past two decades. The use of fossil energy presents a range of problems, such as greenhouse effect, environmental pollution, and even conflicts among countries. More governments are developing a national policy of carbon neutralization to reduce the dependence of humans on fossil energy sources. Renewable and clean energy sources (e.g. solar power, hydrogen fuel and wind energy) are entering people's lives. However, solar power and wind energy are limited by regional and environmental factors. Hydrogen fuel could be produced effectively by some simple methods.1,2 Efficient energy production and conservation, such as water electrolysis, which converts electric energy into hydrogen fuel with low cost, environmental benignity and safety,3 are essential to solve the energy demand.4 The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a wide range of energy conversion and storage technologies that has received great attention from scientists. OER processes generate molecular oxygen together with the transfer of several proton and electron couples; however, the sluggish kinetic properties and high overpotential severely drag down the efficiency of water splitting, and therefore, electrocatalysts with high OER activity are desired to address the difficulties. Although a series of noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts, e.g., iridium- and ruthenium-based catalysts, show remarkable catalytic ability towards OER, they are yet to be widely used in large-scale industrial hydrogen production due to their high cost and the low reserves in the Earth's crust. The economic and earth-abundant non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts, e.g., cobalt- and nickel-based catalysts, are considered to be an ideal alternative option towards OER.5,6 A number of nonnoble metal electrocatalysts with favorable OER catalytic activity and environmentally benign properties have been studied in the past two decades, but they are still far from satisfactory.7–10 More than just catalytically active species, a suitable electronic structure, an excellent coordination interaction, and a powerful and stable supporting material should also be taken into account in the rational design of catalysts; in addition, the catalyst preparation method should be as simple as possible to further reduce costs. In conclusion, the search for simple and effective approaches to prepare non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts is a valuable way to promote the development of efficient electrocatalytic water splitting reaction.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have become a more important field in inorganic chemistry.11 Owing to their all-inorganic nature and robust shell topologies, POMs have extensive applications in several fields, such as electrocatalysis12 and photocatalysis.13 POMs also have high redox ability, which is consistent with the essence of electrochemistry. The introduction of transition metals is a viable and efficient way to realize the enhancement of electrocatalyst performance. Transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalates (TMS Ps), as a part of POMs, possess excellent electrochemical performance and have become an indispensable part of POMs,14e.g., nickel-containing POMs were applied as water oxidation catalyst.15 Furthermore, TMSPs substituted by transition metals with high redox potential, such as Co and Ni, could drive the initiation of OER, whereas normal POMs cannot, because the redox potential of metal atoms that make up POMs (Mo, W, V) is not sufficient for electron transfer between catalyst and water substrate. However, in some cases, the overall negative charge and all-inorganic nature of POMs may limit their application scope. The poor electroconductivity of POMs also hinders their application in OER to some extent. The development of novel materials based on POMs with high catalytic activity has been a growing interest. Creating hybrid organic/inorganic POM architectures is an effective method to diversify the physicochemical properties and applications of nanocluster metal oxides.16 Over the past years, the encapsulation of catalytically active POMs in metal organic frameworks has been an interesting avenue to perform selective catalytic oxidation reactions.17 Most carbon materials have outstanding electrical conductivity, which can make up for the disadvantages of POMs. It is known that doping heteroatoms in carbon materials could significantly improve the catalytic abilities in the electrochemical process.18 Therefore, incorporating conductive supports (e.g., carbon material) with POMs would address the issue of poor conductivity and synergistic OER catalysis.
Graphdiyne (GDY) is an allotrope of carbon with a flat network structure. Different from the traditional carbon materials, which only have sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, GDY comprising sp2- and sp-hybridized carbon atoms with high degrees of π-conjugation that feature uniformly distributed pores, which endow GDY many unique properties, such as highly unevenly distributed surface charges, large conjugated system throughout the whole network, natural band gap, impressive electrical conductivity, and superior electrochemical stability, outperform other carbon materials. Li and co-workers achieved the synthesis of GDY in Cu foil under low temperature by in situ cross-coupling method by using hexaethynylbenzene (HEB) as precursor;19 such mild synthesis condition allows GDY to be further popularized and recognized. It is interesting not only from a structural point of view but also from its applications in catalysis,20 energy storage,21 and energy conversion.22 GDY-based 3D nanoarchitectures featuring well-defined porous network structures can function as highly active cathodes for H2 evolution.23 Heteroatom-doped GDY structures are excellent metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR.24 GDY could be designed and synthesized into novel nanomaterials with core–shell structure across a range of compositions, sizes, shapes, and functionalities. Previous experimental studies show that the 2D material with high curvature (Au tip or Co, N-doped carbon materials, Bi nanotubes) will create more and larger electric fields to improve electrochemical reactions such as ORR, OER or CO2RR, etc.25–27 Thus, GDY with high curvature is a potential material for electrochemistry reactions.
Inspired by the research described above, we designed a new method of POM encapsulation by GDY to form a novel material (POMs@GDY with a core–shell structure) for OER, where the high redox potential transition metal Co is introduced into tri-vacant POMs to form TMSPs to enhance catalytic activity. The interactions between POMs and GDY are significant to electrochemical performance, in which GDY supplies more pores for electron storage and transfer and increase the conductivity of POMs; moreover, the POM core will be not only used as core model to create GDY curling but also affect the electronic field on graphdiyne by its terminal oxygen. The OER electrode was prepared through a two-step process. First, microcrystals of K10[Co4(PW9O34)2]·24H2O (1), which is abbreviated as Co4(PW9)2, were synthesized on commercial cobalt foam electrodes under mild hydrothermal conditions.28 Afterward, GDY nanosheets were grown on the microcrystals by a chemical method. This novel composite cluster, Co4(PW9)2@GDY, exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and long-term stability with high current density. The design approach reported here opened a way to construct different composite clusters based on polyoxometalates and graphdiyne.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of Co4(PW9)2 electrode
Co4(PW9)2 was deposited on the surface of Co foam by a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). First, 0.0582 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol), 0.2576 g Na9[A-α-PW9O34]·7H2O (0.1 mmol) and 0.0745 g KCl (1 mmol) were added to a 25 mL Teflon autoclave with 10 mL deionized water and stirred for 30 min. Second, the pH value of the mixed solution was adjusted to 7.5 and stirred for another half-hour. Then, commercial Co foam substrate, which was cut into pieces (1 cm × 2 cm) and washed by acetone, 1 M HCl, deionized water and ethanol for 15 minutes and dried for 2 h under vacuum, respectively, was immersed into the mixture. Furthermore, the Teflon autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 6 hours, then cooled to room temperature and 4 °C successively, in which the 4 °C cooling was performed overnight. Eventually, the prepared POM-based Co foam electrodes were washed with deionized water and dried at 50 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Synthesis of Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode
First, 20 mL THF, 100 mg HEB-TMS (0.15 mmol) and 0.92 mL 1 M TBAF in THF were added in a three-necked flask with stirring for 15 min at 0 °C under N2 atmosphere to remove the TMS group from HEB-TMS and obtain the monomer hexaethynylbenzene (HEB). Next, the solution was washed with brine, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered, then the extra solvent was evaporated and HEB was resolved with 50 mL acetone. Second, HEB solution was added dropwise to a three-necked flask with 50 mL acetone, 5 mL pyridine and 1 mL N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TMEDA), in which a Co4(PW9)2 electrode and a pretreated Co foil (1 cm × 1 cm) were placed in advance; the mixture was kept in N2 atmosphere at 50 °C for 24 h. Finally, the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode was taken out from the reaction mixture and washed with acetone to remove the unreacted monomer and oligomer, then the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode was dried under the vacuum condition at 50 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Electrochemical measurement
Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai CH. Instruments, China) with a typical three-electrode system. The as-prepared samples, saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and graphite rod were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. The measurement area of the working electrode was 1 cm2. The electrolyte was degassed with Ar for 10 min before each experiment. All potentials were converted based on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, ERHE = Emeasured + ESCE + 0.059 × pH). Polarization curves were collected in 1.0 M KOH at 5 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammogram measurement was conducted within −1 to 1 V (vs. RHE) at 100 mV s−1. The Tafel slope was calculated according to the Tafel equation: η = blogj + a. The EIS measurement was performed at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The double-layer capacitor capacitance (Cdl) was determined by CV curves ranging from 0.96–1.04 V (vs. RHE) at different scan rates. Turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated using the transferred charges from redox peaks of the catalytically active sites shown in CV curves.
2.4 Computational details
The density functional theory with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form of generalized gradient approximation functional (GGA) was employed in our work. The Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used. The plane wave energy cut-off was set as 400 eV. The electron occupancy was estimated by Fermi scheme, with an energy smearing of 0.1 eV. The first Brillouin zone was sampled in the Monkhorst–Pack grid with a k-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 1. The energy (converged to 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom) and force (converged to 0.01 eV Å−1) were set as the convergence criteria for geometry optimization. Spin polarization was considered in all calculations.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis of Co4(PW9)2@GDY is illustrated in Scheme 1. We chose Co foam (CF) as the substrate. First, the hydrothermal reaction conditions for preparing Co4(PW9)2 were optimized after a series of attempts (the preparation of Co4(PW9)2 is illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†); the optimized procedures are shown in Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†).29,30 Co4(PW9)2 was synthesized in aqueous solution at pH 7.5, and the purple crystal deposited uniformly on the surface of the CF.31 Second, because of the low electroconductivity of POMs confining their application as electrocatalyst for OER, GDY, as the conductive material, was introduced as the shell of POMs to reduce obstacles in the process of proton coupling-electron transfer.32 Finally, the Co4(PW9)2@GDY core–shell composite was prepared successfully on CF.

X-Ray diffraction was first used to characterize the structure of Co4(PW9)2. Crystallographic data and structure refinements are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). CCDC 2094409 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.† The structure of Co4(PW9)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n. It is constructed by one {Co4(H2O)2} cluster, two A-α-PW9O34 fragments and ten K+ cations. Two staggered trivacant Keggin A-α-PW9O34 fragments are linked to the {Co4(H2O)2} cluster by eight μ2-O and four μ2-O atoms from the lacunae of the A-α-PW9O34 fragments as well as two central μ4-O atoms from two PO4 tetrahedra. As shown in Fig. 1, a 3-D framework constituted by sandwich-type {Co4(H2O)2(PW9)2} SBUs are connected via ten K+ ions.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology and characterization of CF, Co4(PW9)2 and Co4(PW9)2@GDY. The SEM image of blank CF is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†); the framework and microporous structure of CF are bare and conspicuous. Fig. 2a and b depict appreciable amounts of Co4(PW9)2 crystals deposited on the surface of CF after hydrothermal reaction from the overall and partial perspective, and Fig. 2c also exhibits the parallelepiped-like microcrystal of Co4(PW9)2 clearly.

The Co4(PW9)2 microcrystals were then encapsulated with a uniform GDY nanofilm. We could observe the typical core–shell structure of Co4(PW9)2@GDY. The different morphology of Co4(PW9)2@GDY is revealed obviously with the distinct scale bar (Fig. 2d and e). It is noted that the size of microcrystal Co4(PW9)2@GDY in Fig. 2f is the same as the size in Fig. 2c, which confirms that the microcrystal is stable during the synthesis of GDY and the structure of POMs was preserved intact. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to detect the distribution of different elements of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), which indicates that the elements C, Co, P, O and W coexist in the composite. The results above supply concrete evidence of the formation of Co4(PW9)2@GDY with core–shell structure.
The prepared electrodes were subjected to sonication in 10 mL ethanol to obtain the Co4(PW9)2@GDY composite for further characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After sonication, the Co4(PW9)2 crystals were broken into pieces with different sizes and dispersed uniformly in bulk GDY nanofilm, as shown in Fig. 3a. A typical core–shell hierarchical structure of Co4(PW9)2@GDY is revealed clearly in Fig. 3b; the GDY nanofilm closely embraces the 150 nm fragments of Co4(PW9)2, which reflects that the interface contact mode between Co4(PW9)2 and GDY is wrapping rather than ordinary doping.

A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of the Co4(PW9)2@GDY composite is shown in Fig. 3c; the lattice fringes of Co4(PW9)2 are exhibited clearly. The lattice spacing of 1.04 nm and 0.72 nm between two fringes are observed, which should be ascribed to the (1 1 −1) and (0 2 −1) planes of the Co4(PW9)2 lattice.31 A typical distance of 0.37 nm was also captured, which is considered the interlayer spacing of GDY (Fig. 3d). The elemental mapping in Fig. 3e shows the evenly distributed elements C, O, W, Co and P, which matches well with the EDS element mapping in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The TEM images confirm that Co4(PW9)2 and GDY were prepared properly, and a well-designed core–shell structure formed, which can tackle the bottleneck from the low conductivity of POMs and lead to preeminent electrocatalytic performance.
After characterizing the morphology of the composite cluster, we further investigated its structural information. To obtain the microcrystal of Co4(PW9)2@GDY loaded on CF, the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode was washed by ultrasonication in 10 mL ethanol. First, the approach of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to determine the bonding environment and crystal structure of Co4(PW9)2 and its stability during the synthesis of GDY. The PXRD pattern of the microcrystal is consistent with the simulated patterns based on the single-crystal data, and the Miller indices of (1 1 −1) and (0 2 −1) match well with the TEM image (Fig. 4a).33 The above result indicates that the Co4(PW9)2 microcrystals have a reasonable structure.34Fig. 4b shows the diffraction spectra of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2 and GDY, which suggest the coexistence of POMs and GDY and confirm that the microcrystals are stable during the chemical process of GDY.
 Fig. 4  (a) Simulated and experimental PXRD patterns of Co4(PW9)2; (b) PXRD patterns of Co4(PW9)2, Co4(PW9)2@GDY and GDY. 
Second, Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were further used to identify the structure of the composite catalyst. Fig. 5a shows the Raman spectrum of GDY, Co4(PW9)2@GDY and Co4(PW9)2. There are four main peaks in the Co4(PW9)2@GDY spectrum; the first peak at 981.0 cm−1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of W–O, which has good agreement with Co4(PW9)2; the second peak at 1379.5 cm−1 in the D band is caused by the characteristic vibration of sp2-C domains of aromatic rings; while the G band at 1579.0 cm−1 of the third peak is caused by first-order scattering of the E2g mode from the in-phase stretching vibration of sp2-C lattice in aromatic rings; the fourth peak at 2186.1 cm−1 could be assigned to the typical vibration of diyne (–CC–CC–); therefore, the latter three peaks match well with GDY.

The samples were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine the oxidation number of each element.35Fig. 5b exhibits four characteristic peaks of Co2+ (2p), which include the Co 2p3/2 main peak at 781.7 eV and its satellite peak at 797.4 eV, and the Co 2p1/2 main peak at 786.9 eV and its satellite peak at 803.4 eV. Two peaks at 35.8 eV and 37.9 eV (Fig. 5c) can be ascribed to W6+ (4f). Two signals were detected at 134.0 eV and 135.2 eV (Fig. 5d), which can be assigned to P4+ (2p). The signal of C 1s spectrum in Fig. 5e can be readily deconvoluted into four contributing peaks, which correspond to CC and CC bonds at the binding energy of 284.5 eV and 285.2 eV, and C–O and CO bonds at the binding energy of 286.4 eV and 288.7 eV. The presence of C–O and CO bonds indicate the surface oxidation of graphdiyne. The O 1s spectrum of Co4(PW9)2@GDY can also be deconvoluted into two peaks (Fig. 5f); the peak at the lower binding energy of 530.7 eV is the dominating peak that belongs to the O–W bond in the POMs, and the OC bond has the same binding energy with O–W; the binding energy of 531.8 eV can be attributed to the O–C bond that is also caused by the oxidation of GDY. The XPS data above further proved the formation of Co4(PW9)2@GDY. The supplementary XPS spectra of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2, GDY and Co4(PW9)2@GDY after cycling can be seen in Fig. S9–S12 (ESI†).
From foregoing experimental studies, we know that POMs and GDY have already been applied extensively as the catalyst for OER. The composite cluster Co4(PW9)2@GDY with core–shell structure could have potential catalytic activity for OER. The electrocatalytic performance of Co4(PW9)2@GDY was evaluated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); the original Co4(PW9)2, GDY and CF were tested as reference under the same conditions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curve (iR-corrected) was first obtained at 5 mV s−1 with a standard three-electrode system, including a working electrode, graphite rod counter electrode and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and Ar-saturated 1 M KOH as the electrolyte at room temperature.36 As shown in Fig. 6a, Co4(PW9)2@GDY exhibits the lowest onset potential of 1.47 V (vs. RHE) and highest current density among the four electrocatalytic materials. The LSV curve also illustrates that 1.52 V, 1.57 V, 1.58 V and 1.68 V (vs. RHE) are needed for Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2, GDY and CF, respectively, to raise the current density to 10 mA cm−2. In addition, the relatively low potentials of 1.56 V, 1.59 V, 1.62 V and 1.66 V (vs. RHE) were obtained when current density reached 20 mA cm−2, 50 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2 and 200 mA cm−2 for Co4(PW9)2@GDY, which suggests that the composite cluster has impressive electrocatalytic performance, which could be attributed to the remarkable conductivity of GDY and the highly active catalytic sites from POMs. The synergistic effects between POM clusters and GDY enhance the transmission efficiency of electrons in the multiple electron transfer reaction. Besides, Tafel slopes were also determined in Fig. 6b; distinct Tafel slopes of 80, 117, 109 and 183 mV dec−1 were acquired for Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2, GDY and CF; the lowest Tafel slope of Co4(PW9)2@GDY indicates superior kinetic property among the four electrocatalysts.
 Fig. 6  (a) The LSV (iR-corrected) of Co4(PW9)2@GDY was acquired in 1 M KOH at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1, while Co4(PW9)2, GDY and CF are used for comparison. (b) The corresponding Tafel plot and (c) Cdl plot were obtained by current density versus different scan rates ranging from 0.957 to 1.037 V (vs. RHE) in the non-faradaic region. (d) TOF value versus overpotential for Co4(PW9)2@GDY and Co4(PW9)2. (e) The plot of current density against time for Co4(PW9)2@GDY and Co4(PW9)2 is used for stability assessment. (f) PXRD pattern of Co4(PW9)2@GDY before OER and after OER. 
The electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) is a vital factor to appraise the electrocatalytic performance and was evaluated by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl) via cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scan rates. The CV curves for different scan rates ranging from 0.96–1.04 V (vs. RHE) in the non-faradaic region centre at open-circuit potential are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Fig. 6c is the plot of current density against scan rate, and the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is the slope of fitted lines according to eqn (S1) (ESI†), which is also proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA).37 The Cdl values of 7.3 mF cm−2, 3.9 mF cm−2, 2.3 mF cm−2 and 0.6 mF cm−2 correspond to Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2, GDY and CF electrodes, respectively. The Cdl values and the specific capacitance (Cs) of 0.04 mF cm−2 based on the typical reported values in 1 M KOH were used to calculate ECSA according to eqn (S2) (ESI†).38,39 The ECSA of Co4(PW9)2@GDY is 182.5 cm2, the largest among the four electrodes, whereas only 97.5 cm2, 57.5 cm2 and 15.0 cm2 were obtained for Co4(PW9)2, GDY and bare CF electrode. The higher Cdl represents larger ECSA, which could be ascribed to the sufficient active sites provided by the unique structure of Co4(PW9)2 and well-defined GDY network with abundant cavities used for electron transfer, which thus helps activate more catalytic sites that were silent the first time.
Turnover frequency (TOF) is considered an important indicator to evaluate and compare the intrinsic catalytic performance among different electrocatalysts.40,41Fig. 6d shows the changes of TOF value along with the overpotential from 300 mV to 400 mV, which was calculated by the method of integrating the redox peaks of catalytically active substances;42,43 the expression is shown in eqn (S3) (ESI†). The gap between Co4(PW9)2@GDY and Co4(PW9)2 becomes bigger with the increasing overpotential, and Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode exhibits better intrinsic catalytic performance than Co4(PW9)2 during transfer from OH− to O2, which could be attributed to GDY's assistance in exposing more catalytic sites and its high conductivity. As reported in Table S2 (ESI†), 0.86 s−1 of TOF value was achieved by Co4(PW9)2@GDY at 350 mV of overpotential, whereas only 0.63 s−1 was obtained for Co4(PW9)2. The impressive electrocatalytic performance of Co4(PW9)2@GDY can accelerate OER process and produce more oxygen per second.
Operating under basic aqueous conditions, corrosion resistance is the most important parameter affecting the OER performance, including activity and stability. Chronoamperometry was used to evaluate the long-term durability of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2 and GDY as working electrode. With 1.59 V (vs. RHE) potential applied to the three electrodes, the i–t curves in Fig. 6e were basically unchanged after 30 h of continuous OER process, but obviously different initial current density was found. The highest initial current density of the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode is 32.2 mA cm−2, whereas the relatively low current densities of 17.3 mA cm−2 and 9.2 mA cm−2 for Co4(PW9)2 and GDY were obtained at the same applied potential. The higher current density of Co4(PW9)2@GDY represents higher conductivity and stability, which are due to the excellent conjugated structure of the GDY network. The Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode after OER reaction was further investigated by SEM (Fig. S14, ESI†), Raman (Fig. S15, ESI†) and PXRD (Fig. 6f); the morphology of Co4(PW9)2@GDY was preserved; Raman and PXRD patterns of Co4(PW9)2@GDY before and after have nearly no change. Besides, the XPS spectrum of Co4(PW9)2@GDY after cycling (Fig. S12, ESI†) shows the binding energies of each element are basically consistent with Co4(PW9)2@GDY before cycling, which indicates the retention of core–shell structure after OER cycling and the excellent stability of the composite cluster during the OER process.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to estimate the characteristic kinetics for the different electrodes.44,45 The Nyquist plots of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, Co4(PW9)2, GDY and CF electrodes and the related circuit and results are shown in Fig. S16 and Table S3 (ESI†). The solution impedance (Rs) is 1.49 Ω, and the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode possesses the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.70 Ω, suggesting the accelerating reaction kinetics and charge-transfer conductivity of the composite electrode,46 which could be ascribed to the synergistic effects between Co4(PW9)2 and GDY.
The faradaic efficiency (FE) value was calculated by collecting the products released from the anode. The sealed H-cell was connected to the drainage and gas storage device through an airway, and a graduated cylinder was used to record the volume of O2 produced (shown in Fig. S21, ESI†).47,48 The FE test was performed under 1.61 V (vs. RHE), and the OER process continued for 4000 s. Fig. S22 (ESI†) exhibits the FE values calculated according to eqn (S4-1) and (S4-2) (ESI†) at different points in time. It is noticed that all FEs are above 96%, with the minimum value of 98.6% at 4000 s. It also illustrates that the O2 volume obtained from experiment is basically consistent with the theoretical O2 volume. The results above prove that the OER process can be carried out with high efficiency.
To further explore the improved OER activity of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the free energy changes of the OER process (H2O → OH → O → OOH → O2) on the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode (the computational detail and model of Co4(PW9)2@GDY are discussed at large in ESI,† Fig. S23).49 For pure GDY, there are two sorts of possible active sites: C atoms connect to the 6-member rings and the C atoms in 6-member rings, abbreviated as C-6MR and Cin6MR. For the core–shell structure of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, under the effect of electrostatic action between Co4(PW9)2 and GDY, the electrons start to distribute on the GDY, making Cin6MR′, shown in Fig. 6a, also considered as a new kind of active site in Co4(PW9)2@GDY. Fig. 7a and b show the structure model of Co4(PW9)2@GDY; their corresponding distributions of differential charge are shown in Fig. 7c and d. The iso-surface is 0.003 e Å−3; the blue and yellow denote electron accumulation and loss, respectively. It is noted that the charged electrons on GDY are mainly focused on the sites close to the humped oxygen atoms in Co4(PW9)2; meanwhile, the humped oxygen atoms also show high electronic accumulation. This result is in good agreement with our deduction that POMs can cause GDY curling and affect the electronic field on GDY. As shown in Fig. 7e–g, the working potential of C-6MR, Cin6MR′ and Cin6MR active sites in Co4(PW9)2@GDY for OER are 1.78, 2.01 and 2.13 V (vs. RHE), in which C-6MR has values closest to the 1.23 V (vs. RHE), revealing the highest activity for OER over the others. Compared to the working potential of C-6MR (1.89 V) and Cin6MR (2.18 V) on GDY (Fig. S24, ESI†), the activity of OER is improved after combining Co4(PW9)2 and GDY, which agrees with the experimental observation.

It is noted that the OER catalytic performance of Co4(PW9)2 and GDY is limited by the elementary reaction of O → OOH (the free adsorption energy of O: ΔGO), but Co4(PW9)2@GDY exhibits a better catalytic activity and a lower ΔGO than pure GDY. To deeply work out the reason, adsorption configurations were investigated. For O adsorption process in the elementary reaction of O → OOH, the pure GDY is largely deformed due to the strong interaction between O intermediates and C in GDY, which raises the energy barrier and increases the ΔGO; therefore, it takes more energy to continue the O adsorption reaction. After introduction of Co4(PW9)2, the interaction between GDY and Co4(PW9)2 is attractive, with the energy of −5.67 eV, and the attractive interaction will reduce the deformation of GDY in the O adsorption process and lower the energy level of ΔGO. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6c and d, the interaction between Co4(PW9)2 and GDY is uneven according to the differential charge distribution; the main attraction occurs at the position close to the humped oxygen atom in Co4(PW9)2, and thus, the active sites away from the humped oxygen atoms still need to consume extra energy to overcome deformation under the O adsorption process. The active sites of Cin6MR in Co4(PW9)2@GDY are away from the humped oxygen in Co4(PW9)2; this is the main reason that it shows similar activity and deformation energy to Cin6MR in pure GDY (Fig. S25, ESI†). The active sites of Cin6MR′ and C-6MR in Co4(PW9)2@GDY are close to the humped oxygen; thus, they show lower deformation energy than Cin6MR and C-6MR in GDY. In addition, Cin6MR′ exhibits the lowest deformation energy, which suggests Cin6MR′ has the shortest distance from humped oxygen and possesses minimal deformation of GDY in Co4(PW9)2@GDY. Overall, the humped oxygen in Co4(PW9)2 will attract the GDY and reduce the deformation of GDY caused by the adsorption of O intermediates, which endows Co4(PW9)2@GDY with better OER performance and the closest working voltage to the thermodynamic equilibrium voltage of water electrolysis.
The above experiment and theory calculation prove that the Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode has impressive electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for OER. The core–shell structure of the composite cluster supplies a high catalytic activity centre and a highly conductivity interface. Co4(PW9)2, as the core material, has a multi-electronic property, which is favourable for multiple electron transfer reactions. The unique 2D structure composed of sp-C and sp2-C carbon atoms and conjugated network endow GDY with high electrochemical activity, excellent physical durability and novel micropore structure, enhancing the storage and electron transfer ability and accelerating the process of proton coupling-electron transfer. All the above advantages of Co4(PW9)2 and GDY should be responsible for the outstanding catalytic activity towards OER of the Co4(PW9)2@GDY composite cluster.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the core–shell structure of Co4(PW9)2@GDY, used for electrocatalysis towards OER in alkaline system, was prepared successfully by a facile two-step method. First, Co4(PW9)2 was deposited on the surface of commercial CF. Second, to improve the catalytic performance of the electrode, an in situ GDY synthesis method was used to achieve GDY nanofilm to encapsulate Co4(PW9)2 and form the core–shell structure. The composite cluster Co4(PW9)2@GDY electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER, has a low potential of 1.52 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2, with a small Tafel slope of 80 mV dec−1, large ECSA of 182.5 cm2, high TOF value of 0.86 s−1 and long-term stability for 30 h toward OER. GDY is an excellent all-carbon material due to its unique conjugated structure and microporous structure, which could improve the electron transport process and increase the stability of the electrode. POMs are also an excellent material for electrolysis, with impressive redox activity, stability, and numerous active catalytic sites. This report supplies an idea and guidance to make more advanced composite electrodes including POMs and GDY instead of using noble metals in the future.
