    , Accepted 10th October 2022First published on 21st October 2022AbstractLead-free metal halide perovskites have become emerging candidates for white light emitting diodes and X-ray imaging, and exploration of the corresponding down-conversion phosphors and scintillators based on perovskite structures with a high-performance for advanced devices is ongoing. Here, we synthesized Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ crystals with a yellow emission at 557 nm and a wide full width at half maximum around 104 nm, which is attributed to the transition from the triplet state to the ground state (3P1 → 1S0) of Te4+ ions. Moreover, the energy transfer process from the self-trapped exciton of Cs2HfCl6 to Te4+ ions is demonstrated. Accordingly, the white light emitting diodes show a color rendering index of 61.8, which was manufactured by employing the Cs2HfCl6:3% Te4+ crystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 74.2%. Furthermore, the Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ crystals exhibit a fascinating steady-state X-ray light yield reaching 76,194 photons MeV−1, a low detection limit of 36.2 nGy s−1 and a high spatial resolution of 11 lp mm−1. Hence, this study offers new insight for the development of lead-free metal halide perovskites and promotes their versatile application in white light emitting diodes and X-ray imaging.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskites CsPbX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, and I−) have emerged as a promising class of semiconducting materials due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties for optoelectronic applications, such as humidity sensors,1 solar concentrators,2 photocatalytic,3 white light emitting diodes (WLEDs)4,5 and X-ray imaging.6,7 However, the toxicity and stability problems of lead halide perovskites hinder their practical application for long-term operation.8 Hence, the exploration of lead-free perovskites with high-performance has attracted particular attention based on the substitution of Pb2+ ions with nontoxic metal elements (Sn2+,9 Ge2+,10 Mn2+,11 Bi3+,12 In3+,13 and Sb3+14–16). The as-explored inorganic lead-free metal halide perovskites (LFHPs) including CsSnCl3,17 CsGeI3,18 CsMnBr3,19 Cs3Bi2Br9,20 Cs3In2Br9,21 and Cs3Sb2I922 exhibit potential for ion detection, solar cells, anti-counterfeiting, information storage, lasers and photodetectors, respectively.
Recently, perovskite derivatives such as Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6,23 Sb3+ doped Cs2InCl5·H2O,24 Cs3InBr625 and Cs3Cu2I526,27 have been developed as down-conversion phosphors to achieve white light emission blended with the corresponding commercial phosphors, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Although encouraging results have been achieved, LFHP and their variants employed as next-generation light-emitting materials still face difficulties in terms of the production cost for they are generally efficiently excited by 365 nm UV rather than a blue chip.28 Besides, the re-absorption of the as-developed phosphors cannot be overlooked.29 Moreover, LFHPs such as Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4In0.85Bi0.15Cl6,30 Cs2NaLnCl6 (Ln: Tb, Eu),31 Cs2ZnBr4: Cu32 and Rb2AgBr333 with decent scintillation performances under X-ray irradiation have been explored as depicted in Table S2 (ESI†). Notably, the steady-state X-ray light yields, detection limit and spatial resolution of the involved scintillators still need to be further addressed.34
More recently, the vacancy-ordered lead-free perovskites as the exemplified Cs2HfCl6 are expected to be promising candidates for photoelectric devices.35,36 The corresponding structure is formed by doubling the conventional ABX3 perovskite unit cell and removing half of the B-site cations, where isolated [BX6]2− octahedral units are bridged by A-site cations in the void.37 Hence, the photogenerated charge carriers could be tightly confined in their isolated polyhedral cells, which greatly facilitates the recombination of charges to realize satisfied photoluminescence.38,39 Unfortunately, the excitation energies of hafnium halide perovskites are too high (<300 nm) to orientate WLED applications fundamentally.40 Doping of metal ions with ns2 electronic configuration (e.g., Sb3+, Bi3+, Te4+) is an effective approach to tailor the electronic and optical properties of LFHPs.36,41 Therefore, the introduction of suitable dopants for the soft lattice matrix of Cs2HfCl6 is expected to meet the application requirements for state-of-the-art photoelectric devices.
In this work, Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ crystals are synthesized successfully via a traditional hydrothermal method. Correspondingly, the as-explored Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ crystals emit a yellow light at 557 nm with a fascinating photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 74.2% and a modulated excitation band distinct from the Cs2HfCl6. Accordingly, the WLEDs with cold and warm white light are developed based on the as-explored crystals. Moreover, Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ as a satisfactory scintillator exhibiting high steady-state X-ray light yields, low detection limits and a superior spatial resolution is clarified.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and chemicals
Cesium acetate (CH3COOCs, AR, 99%, Macklin), hafnium chloride (HfCl4, 99.9%, Macklin), tellurium dioxide (TeO2, 99.99%, Macklin), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), and ethanol anhydrous (CH3CH2OH, 99.9%, Macklin) were employed in this study. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of Cs2HfCl6: x% Te4+ crystals
The Cs2HfCl6: x% Te4+ crystals were synthesized using a typical hydrothermal method. 2 mmol CH3COOCs, (1-x) mmol HfCl4, and x mmol TeO2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10) are dissolved in 20 mL of 37% HCl solution in a 50 mL autoclave. The autoclave is put into a drying oven and heated at 180 °C for 10 h. After complete reaction, the solution is then cooled to room temperature with a drying oven. The crystals from the solution are washed with ethanol anhydrous and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h.
2.3. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
The information on band structures and density of states (DOS) for the perfect perovskite and the Hf4+ sites replaced with Te4+ is obtained by using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code. Considering the gradient of the electron density, the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA-PBE) exchange–correlation function is selected. A 2 × 2× 2 mesh is adopted for the K-point sampling. All structural optimizations and electronic calculations are based on a cut-off energy of 400 eV.
2.4. Fabrication of cold and warm WLEDs devices
WLEDs devices are fabricated by using a blue chip (430 nm), weighing the epoxy resin and stirring them thoroughly. Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ crystals ground for 20 minutes in an agate mortar are added to the above mixed glue with a specific ratio. After sufficient stirring, the obtained slurry is coated on the surface of the LED chip subsequently and finally put at room temperature for 48 hours to fabricate an LED. The fabrication of cold and warm WLEDs can be adjusted by changing the ratio of the sample powder and epoxy resin.
2.5. Fabrication of a scintillator film
Mix and stir the weighed epoxy resin and the ground Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ crystals thoroughly. After standing for 15 minutes, the upper slurry is taken out to drop it on a piece of cover glass slide and then sheathed with another cover glass slide. Finally, place it at room temperature for 24 hours to form a scintillator film.
2.6. Measurement and characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns are obtained by using a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The PL spectra of samples are recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The Abs spectra are recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instrument Ltd, Edinburgh, UK) is employed to determine the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay kinetics. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping are executed using a Hitachi S-4300 field emission scanning electron microscope (Quanta250 FEG). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha and X-ray source (monochromatic Al Kα source (Mono Al Kα) energy: 1486.6 eV, 6 mA × 12 KV) with a 400 μm spot size and 50 eV pass energy. The PLQY measurement is performed using an absolute PLQY spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS 1000).
2.7. X-Ray characterization
X-ray detection was completed by using a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) as well as a commercially available and miniaturized X-ray tube (Amptek) with a maximum output of 1200 W. A range of X-ray dose rates (50 nGy·s−1–2 mGy·s−1) is applied by adjusting the current and voltage of the X-ray source. When measuring the X-ray radiation stability of the sample, the voltage and current values of the X-ray tube are kept at 40 kV and 30 mA respectively. Photographs of the X-ray induced luminescence are obtained with a digital camera (Nikon D7100 with AF-S Micro-Nikkor 105 mm f/2.8G IF-ED).
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the undoped sample (Cs2HfCl6) agrees well with the standard card (PDF#32-0233), which indicates the phase purity of the as-obtained sample. The diffraction peak around 24° significantly shifts toward small angles with the increased concentration of Te4+ ions in Fig. 1a (right panel), which implies that Te4+ ions are successfully introduced into the host matrix of Cs2HfCl6 locating the Hf4+ sites, responsible for the lattice expansion. Fig. 1b depicts the refined XRD patterns of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+, which further confirms the phase purity. The cubic Cs2HfCl6 with the Fm3m space group is isostructural to K2PtCl6, where Hf4+ ions are surrounded with Cl− ions equally forming undistorted [HfCl6]2− octahedrons isolated by Cs+ ions as displayed in Fig. S1a (ESI†).42 Te4+ (r4+Te = 97 pm) ions are inclined to occupy the Hf4+ (r4+Hf = 72 pm) sites to form [TeCl6]2− octahedrons when Te4+ ions are introduced into the matrix for the identical valence state in Fig. 1c. Fig. S2 (ESI†) confirms the obtained perovskite is microcrystalline with polyhedron morphology, and the corresponding Cs, Hf, Te and Cl elements of the micro-particle distribute uniformly. In Fig. 1d, the XPS results confirm the existence of Cs, Hf, Te and Cl elements. Two peaks at 576.76 and 587.15 eV are assigned to Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2 respectively in Fig. 1e.43 The XPS spectra of Cs 3d and Cl 2p are shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†) respectively. In Fig. S3c (ESI†), peaks in the range of 17–20 eV are attributed to Hf 4f,35 which further suggests the stable valence state of Hf and Te elements with a +4 oxidation state.

Fig. 2a depicts that the as-obtained Cs2HfCl6 crystals show blue emission at 432 nm (λex = 248 nm) with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) around 113 nm. Moreover, the corresponding lifetime of 13.69 μs could be fitted by a mono-exponential decay function It = I0e(−t/τ) as illustrated in Fig. S4a (ESI†). Hence, the blue emission of Cs2HfCl6 originates from the self-trapped exciton (STE), which coincides with previously reported data.42,44 Notably, yellow emission at 557 nm with a FWHM around 104 nm emerges after Te4+ ions are introduced into the Cs2HfCl6 host matrix under 340 and 420 nm, and a large Stokes Shift of 140 nm is observed in the PL spectrum shown in Fig. 2b. Identical PL performances of Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ under 340 and 420 nm excitation indicate that the emission originates from the same emission center. Besides, the excitation band at 340 and 420 nm is assigned to direct excitation of Te4+ ions through 1S0 → 1P1 and 1S0 → 3P1 transitions, respectively.45 Moreover, the recorded PLQY of the Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ sample reaches 74.2% (λex = 420 nm) in Fig. S5a (ESI†).

(f) Columnar diagram of the PL and RL intensity dependent on the concentration of Te4+ ions under 420 nm excitation and X-ray irradiation, respectively. 
It should be highlighted that both the samples of Cs2HfCl6 with and without Te4+ ions perform an effective RL under X-ray irradiation. Cs2HfCl6 and Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ exhibit RL located at 432 and 557 nm, respectively, which is consistent with their corresponding PL. This suggests the distinct luminescence behavior for the introduction of Te4+ ions and the homology of PL and RL.46 Furthermore, the bandgap of Cs2HfCl6 and Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ is calculated to be 4.67 and 4.13 eV respectively. Besides, the bandgap decreases gradually with the increase of Te4+ ion concentration as illustrated in Fig. S6a (ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 2c, the PL intensity of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ shows a linear dependence on the excitation power density, which rules out the emission originating from permanent defects.24,25 Considering the large FWHM, large Stokes Shift, and the 5s2 electron configuration of Te4+ ions, the yellow emission of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ is speculated from STE.43,47 The temperature-dependent PL spectra of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ are shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S7a (ESI†), which manifests that the relative PL intensity increases when the temperature drops from 300 to 24 K, thanks to the alleviated non-radiative recombination.24,48 The gradually broadening FWHM is observed with the increase of ambient temperature, which is attributed to the enhanced electron–phonon coupling.25,41,49 In order to further study the electron–phonon coupling, the FWHM as a function of reciprocal temperature is fitted by the following equation of the phonon broadening model:24,43 (1)where S is the electron–phonon coupling, ħωphonon is the phonon frequency, and Kb is the Boltzmann constant. As shown in Fig. 2e, the measured ħωphonon value is 21.6 meV. The calculated value of S is 30.2, which implies a strong electron–phonon coupling in the soft halide matrix. Accordingly, the yellow STE emission of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ is caused by strong Jahn–Teller distortion of the [TeCl6]2− octahedron.43,47,50,51 Moreover, the exciton binding energy (Eb) is estimated by using the Arrhenius formula shown below: (2)where I(T) and I0 are the PL intensity at temperature T and 0 K, respectively, and Kb is the Boltzmann constant. The Eb of 68.9 meV calculated in Fig. 2e is higher than the thermal energy (26 meV) at room temperature (RT), which means the stable STE with highly localized behavior is formed. It ensures the survival of excitons well above RT and their high-rate recombination.25,40,43 Moreover, the variable excitation and emission spectra with negligible change of peak shape and position is shown in Fig. S8a and b (ESI†), which is consistent with the characteristics of STE emission.25,52 The strong coupling between excitons and phonons results in STE emission generally with a longer lifetime at a long wavelength.24 The PL decay curves of the Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ could be well fitted by a double exponential function model It = I1e(−t/τ1) + I2e(−t/τ2) with an average lifetime of 4.26 μs including the shorter lifetime (2.48 μs) with a percentage of 39.4% and the longer lifetime (5.51 μs) with a percentage of 60.6% (λex = 420 nm, λem = 557 nm) in Fig. S8c (ESI†), identical with the characteristics of STE emission.39 Generally, the ground state 1S0, and the excited states split into four energy levels as singlet state 1P1 and triplet states 3Pn (n = 0, 1, 2) for the 5s2 electron configuration of Te4+ ions is formed, respectively. Hence, it is noteworthy that the short lifetime and long lifetime correspond to 3P1 → 1S0 and 3P0 → 1S0 pathways, respectively.43,51,53 Moreover, an optimum doping concentration is determined to be 3% in Fig. 2f, and the corresponding PL spectra with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S9a and b (ESI†).
Density functional theory (DFT) is performed to understand the band structures and optical properties of Cs2HfCl6 and Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The direct bandgap of Cs2HfCl6 is determined to be 3.984 eV in Fig. S10a (ESI†) according to the calculation of density functional theory, where Cl 3p and Hf 5d orbitals contribute to the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in Fig. S10b (ESI†). The top of the valence band for Te4+ ion doped Cs2HfCl6 is identical with that of Cs2HfCl6, while the conduction band is mainly derived from the Hf 5d and Te 5p orbitals in Fig. S10d (ESI†). Moreover, the direct bandgap reduced to be 3.190 eV with the introduction of Te4+ ions as observed in Fig. S10c (ESI†), which is consistent with the observed decrease of the optical bandgap in Fig. S6a (ESI†).48,54
Furthermore, an energy transfer (ET) process from the STE of Cs2HfCl6 to Te4+ ions is discovered shown in Fig. 3a. The PL spectrum of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ exhibits two emission peaks located at 440 and 563 nm for Gaussian fitting (λex = 248 nm). The emission peak of 563 nm can be assigned to 3P1 → 1S0 of Te4+ ions, while subtle emission at 440 nm which is consistent with the blue emission of Cs2HfCl6 (λem = 432 nm). It is notable that the yellow emission (λem = 557 nm) appears with the introduction of Te4+ ions, and the PL intensity of the blue emission (λem = 432 nm) is severely suppressed. Furthermore, the decay curves (λex = 248 nm, λem = 432 nm) of Cs2HfCl6 and Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ in Fig. 3b indicate the corresponding lifetime decrease from 13.69 to 2.88 μs, indicating that ET efficiency reaches 78% from STE of the Cs2HfCl6 to Te4+ ions.55 Fig. S11a (ESI†) displays the recorded lifetime of Cs2HfCl6 with different concentrations of Te4+ ions, demonstrating the decreased trend of the lifetime for the corresponding sample.

Accordingly, the luminescence mechanism diagram is illustrated in Fig. 3c. Under the excitation of 248 nm photon, the electrons transition from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and then fall into STE in the form of non-radiative relaxation, which eventually lead to the emission of 432 nm of Cs2HfCl6. However, with the introduction of Te4+ ions, electrons populated at STE of Cs2HfCl6 realize an ET process to Te4+ ions under 248 nm excitation, and then relax to the ground state 1S0, resulting in the yellow emission at 557 nm. Moreover, the electrons are pumped from the ground state 1S0 to the singlet state 1P1, and subsequently to the triplet state 3P1 through an intersystem crossing process (ISC) under 340 nm excitation,24 which is responsible for the yellow emission at 557 nm. The yellow emission is also attributed to triplet state excitonic recombination under excitation of 420 nm. In addition, the Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ absorb the incident radiation energy effectively when excited by higher energy X-ray and eject massive hot electrons due to the photoelectric effect and inelastic Compton scattering.30,34 These electrons thermalize on an ultrafast timescale to relax to the luminescent centers and generate the characteristic emission at 557 nm subsequently.
The thermal and water stability of the Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ crystals are of significant importance for practical LED applications.56 As shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†), the decomposition temperature of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ reaches as high as 400 °C. The PL intensity of the sample completely immersed in deionized water remains at 85% of the original after 180 minutes and there is no obvious luminescence loss when the corresponding sample is placed in the atmosphere for tens of days in Fig. S12b and c (ESI†). The excellent optical performance and stability endow the Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ with the potential for WLEDs. Hence, WLEDs combined the Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ with a blue chip (λem = 430 nm) are fabricated. By manipulating the ratio of the as-explored sample and epoxy resin, controllable cold or warm white light output can be easily achieved, and the corresponding EL spectrum under the operating current of 40 mA and voltage of 2.6 V is shown in Fig. 4a and c respectively. Fig. 4b exhibits the corresponding color correlated temperature (CCT) of 6274 K with a chromaticity coordinate of (0.3223, 0.2661) for the as-explored cold WLEDs, while the CCT of 3828 K with a chromaticity coordinate of (0.3862, 0.3781) and color rendering index (CRI) of 61.8 for the warm counterpart, respectively. Furthermore, the EL spectra of warm WLEDs with different driving currents (20 to 120 mA) are depicted in Fig. 4d, which indicates that the EL intensity increases with the increased drive current. Moreover, the EL intensity recorded as a function of operation time under a drive current of 40 mA and a voltage of 2.6 V in Fig. 4e confirms that the emission intensity is basically constant after operating for 12 hours. Herein, the corresponding chromaticity coordinate shown in Fig. 4f is significantly unchanged, which suggests a relatively good stability of the as-explored WLEDs.

Thanks to the heavy atoms (Cs, Hf, Te) response for the absorption of X-ray,34,57 Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ crystals exhibit a fascinating X-ray behavior as effective scintillators. The absorption spectra of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+, CsI: Tl, and BGO over a range of X-ray photon energy (0–120 keV) are plotted in Fig. 5a, which shows the absorption coefficient of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ is lower than CsI: Tl, but the RL intensity is much higher than that of CsI: Tl and BGO. Fig. 5b exhibits that the steady-state X-ray light yields of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ is up to 76,194 photons MeV−1, which is attributed to the effective absorption of the heavy atom for X-ray and the ability of converting X-ray into visible light. The corresponding RL spectra were recorded by a fibre-coupled spectrometer as shown in Fig. S13a (ESI†). The detection limit of 36.2 nGy s−1 is acquired from the linear relationship of both the integrated RL intensity of Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ and the X-ray dose rate shown in Fig. 5c. Furthermore, a self-built imaging system is illustrated in Fig. 5d. The X-ray imaging of the spring inside the silicone resin and chip is presented in Fig. 5e. Moreover, the X-ray image of the standard test-pattern plate manifests that the values of spatial resolution of the as-explored scintillators is around 11 lp mm−1 in Fig. 5f and g. Notably, there is no obvious change in RL intensity under continuous X-ray irradiation with a high dose rate of 8 mGy s−1 for 2 hours as shown in Fig. S13b (ESI†), while Fig. 5h illustrates the RL intensity is stable basically even when the accumulated radiation dose is up to 518.4 Gy.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the blue emission originating from Cs2HfCl6 disappears with the doping of Te4+ ions, and a new broadband emission of 557 nm is observed with the PLQY as high as 74.2% under the excitation of 420 nm. The yellow emission originating from the transition from the triplet state 3P1 to the ground state 1S0 is demonstrated. The ET process between the STE of the host and Te4+ ions is addressed. Accordingly, the as-explored Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ applied to WLEDs with adjustable color temperature and excellent operating stability is illustrated. Furthermore, Cs2HfCl6: 3% Te4+ crystals exhibit fascinating high steady-state X-ray light yields of 76,194 photons MeV−1, low detection limit (36.2 nGy s−1), superior stability under X-ray radiation and a high spatial resolution of 11 lp mm−1. With such outstanding optical and scintillation properties, Cs2HfCl6: Te4+ crystals are expected to be a promising candidate for versatile optoelectronics.
