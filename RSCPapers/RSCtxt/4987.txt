    , Accepted 14th May 2017First published on 15th May 2017AbstractPolycrystalline bulk Cu1.8S materials were fabricated using mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). The microstructure and thermoelectric transport properties were investigated in detail with emphasis on the effect of the mechanical alloying ball-milling process. Cu1.8S single-phase powders were directly synthesized from the elemental powders. High-density (>95%) p-type Cu1.8S bulk samples were fabricated using the subsequent SPS process at 773 K for 5 min. A Cu1.96S second phase was detected in the bulk samples when the ball-milling time was increased to 3 h, and the Cu1.96S content increased with increasing ball-milling time. The electrical properties and Seebeck coefficient of the Cu1.8S bulk samples were dependent on the milling time of the starting powders. The Cu1.8S bulk that was sintered by SPS using the powder treated with a 3 h ball-milling obtained a record-high power factor of 1552 μW m−1 K−2 at 773 K for the Cu–S system, which is 40% higher than that of pristine Cu1.8S. The ZT value of the Cu1.8S bulk sample that was sintered by SPS using the 12 h ball-milling treated powder reached 0.71, which is 67% higher than the ZT value of the sample that was sintered using the powder with a 1 h ball-milling time.
1. Introduction
Harvesting waste heat into electricity using high-efficiency thermoelectric (TE) materials has been a positive step toward sustainable development because of the reduction in greenhouse gas emission and the improvement in energy usage through the solid-state thermal-to-electricity conversion.1–5 The conversion efficiency of TE materials is characterized by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT (= α2σT/κ), where α is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature and κ is the thermal conductivity (a sum of the electronic thermal conductivity (κe) and lattice thermal conductivity (κl)).6 Recently, improved knowledge of the underlying physics of TE materials combined with advanced synthesis techniques has resulted in the discovery of new material systems with ZT values greater than 1 at elevated temperatures.7–11 However, the expensive, toxic and rare elements, which are used in complex and costly synthesis procedures, present serious impediments to large-scale applications. TE materials made of cheap, environmentally friendly and earth-abundant elements, such as SnSe,12,13 Cu2Se14,15 and Cu–S compounds,16–18 have received increasing attention.
Copper sulfides, particularly digenite, Cu2−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), have been initially used in thin-film solar cells and optoelectronic devices.19,20 Cu1.8S has a stable phase that varies with temperature. Cu1.8S crystals are structurally similar to the cubic Cu2S system with the exception that only nine tenths of the lattice sites are occupied by copper atoms.22 Cu1.8S has two different crystal structures (Fig. 1): low-digenite (hexagonal phase, R3-MH) and high-digenite (cubic phase, FM3-M) with a turning temperature of approximately 361 K, as shown in Fig. 2. When the temperature is greater than 361 K, the Cu atoms transition from an ordered state to a disordered state.21 Cu1.8S has been reported as a superionic conductor.16,17 Superionic conductors are solid materials that have high ionic conductivities, which are as high as those found in molten salts or liquid water at room temperature.23 In the crystallography literature, elucidating the structure of the various mineral forms of Cu2−xS has been a long-standing and challenging problem.24–28 The main reason for this is that the positions of the Cu atoms within the close-packed sublattice of S atoms are not well defined. The temperature-dependent behavior indicated that the Cu ions randomly move at elevated temperatures. This random motion behavior of the Cu ions is of high interest, which could possibly lead to strong phonon scattering and electron–phonon interactions.29,30

As a TE material, Cu1.8S has a high electrical conductivity (3000 S cm−1), a low Seebeck coefficient and a high thermal conductivity.31 As previously reported, Cu1.8S can be synthesized by several strategies, such as the fusion method32 or the solution phase method.33 MA is a solid-state powder processing technique that involves repeated welding, fracturing and rewelding of powder particles in a high-energy ball mill, which is capable of synthesizing a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium alloy phases starting from blended elements or pre-alloyed powders.34,35 The ball-milling parameters, including speed and time, affect the properties of powder samples. In our previous work, we found that the SPS sintering temperature can affect the Cu1.8S properties.16 In the present work, we demonstrated that the ball-milling time can significantly affect the TE properties of bulk Cu1.8S after SPS. As a result, a maximum power factor of 1552 μW m−1 K−2 was obtained at 773 K for the bulk Cu1.8S sample that was sintered via SPS using the powder treated by MA for 3 h, which was higher than those values that have been reported to date for the Cu–S system.17 Additionally, the highest ZT value of 0.71 was obtained for the bulk Cu1.8S sample that was sintered via SPS using the powder treated by MA for 12 h. Furthermore, first-principles calculation was employed for examining the property enhancement mechanism of Cu1.8S.
2. Experimental section
Commercial high-purity powders, 99.99% Cu (under 200 mesh) and 99.99% S (under 200 mesh), were used as the raw materials. These powders with the chemical composition of Cu1.8S were subjected to MA in a planetary ball mill (QM-4F, Nanjing University, China) at 425 rpm for 1, 3, 7, 12 and 18 h under an atmosphere of mixed nitrogen (95%) and hydrogen (5%) gases. The ball-milled powders were sintered at 723 K for 5 min in a Φ 15 graphite mold under an axial pressure of 50 MPa in a vacuum using the SPS system (Sumitomo SPS211-X, Japan). The phase structure and microstructure were checked using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrical and thermal transport properties, including electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal diffusivity and specific heat, were measured. The absolute errors of the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity were assumed to be 10%–20%.
The details of experiment and first-principles calculation36–40 are shown in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase and microstructure
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the Cu1.8S samples that were synthesized by MA using different milling times (1–18 h) are displayed in Fig. 3(a). All the diffraction peaks of the powder samples are indexed as the α-digenite phase (PDF card no. 47-1748), which indicates that all the powders have a Cu1.8S main phase without any detected impurities. Fig. 3(b) and (c) show that the diffraction peaks of the bulk samples sintered at 773 K for 5 min are sharper than the peaks of the powder samples due to grain growth. Based on the finding that Cu1.8S compounds can be synthesized by the combination of MA and SPS techniques, more experiments were conducted to control the composition and microstructure by an adjustment in the ball-milling time. Apart from the Cu1.8S main phase, the Cu1.96S (inverted triangle) phase was indexed according to PDF#12-0224, and the intensities of its diffraction peaks gradually increased with increasing milling time (for example, see the (1 0 3) and (1 0 4) diffraction peaks that are labeled by an inverted triangle symbol in Fig. 3(b)). Cu1.96S is also a p-type semiconductor with a lower electrical conductivity compared with Cu1.8S due to fewer Cu vacancies.41 This phenomenon arises from the loss and/or volatilization of sulfur in Cu1.8S and usually is a consequence of the MA and/or SPS processes. Fig. 3(c) indicates that the 2-theta angle of the (0 1 20) peak for each bulk sample remained at 46.02°, which is slightly lower than the angle of 46.11° from the standard card. This result indicates an increase in the lattice constant due to an increase in S volatility during the SPS process.42

Fig. 4 shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs of the Cu1.8S fractured bulk samples. A dense morphology was observed for samples with milling times of 1 h and 3 h, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The relative densities exceeded 95% and grain sizes ranged from 700 nm to 1.0 μm. Fig. 4(c) shows a sample with a 7 h milling time. In this case, the grain sizes were reduced to approximately 1.0 μm and a few pores that ranged from 500 nm to 900 nm were also observed. Additionally, the number of pores increased with increasing milling time, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and S1.† The appearance of the pores also coincided with the decomposition behavior of Cu1.8S to Cu1.96S and S, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(b), which resulted in a decrease in the relative density from 98% to 86% as the milling time increased from 1 h to 18 h. Porous microstructures are shown in Fig. 4(d) and S1† with smaller grain sizes (700 nm and 500 nm for milling times of 12 and 18 h, respectively), which may be favorable for reducing the thermal conductivity. In Table 1, EDX results indicate that the S content decreased with an increase in milling time. The S atomic ratio was 31.98% in the bulk sample with a 1 h milling time. For the bulk sample, the S atomic ratio decreased to 29.44% with an 18 h milling time, which is also in agreement with the XRD (Fig. 3) and FESEM (Fig. 4) results. The ball-milling time and speed are the most important parameters and both determine the energy input into the powder. This relationship is based on the following equation:43,44 E = Kωnt(1)where E, K, n, ω and t are the required energy in certain powder states in the MA process, the energy for one collision, an index, the milling speed and milling time, respectively. Therefore, either an increase in the milling speed or time can provide more energy to refine powders that require a reduced densification temperature.45–48 Grain growth is more apparent when powders are milled at higher speeds for longer times at the same sintering temperature. However, heavily refined powders tend to contain more sulfur vacancies resulting from MA and SPS processes and excessive sulfur vacancies can prevent grain growth, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e).

Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of 1 h and 3 h ball-milled samples. Fig. 5(a) shows a pure Cu1.8S sample with 1 h ball-milling where the grain size is approximately 300–500 nm. The inset of Fig. 5(a) shows the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the 1 h ball-milled sample depicting a lattice spacing of 0.2253 nm that corresponds to the distance between the (1 1 15) planes. Fig. 5b shows the HRTEM images of the 1 h ball-milled sample, indicating a good crystallinity and an orientation along [1 1 15]. The inset of Fig. 5(c) is the SAED pattern of the 3 h ball milled sample and the circular diffraction rings indicate that the sample is polycrystalline and the grain size is small. The indexing of the diffraction rings showed that both Cu1.8S and Cu1.96S are present in the sample. The HRTEM images clearly display lattice fringes with spacings of 0.1698 and 0.2253 nm, which match well with those of the (0 1 20) and (1 1 15) planes of Cu1.8S, respectively, as shown Fig. 5(d). In addition, the interstices of the blue region are approximately 0.3635 nm and 0.2637 nm, which correspond to the (1 1 4) and (1 0 4) planes of Cu1.96S, respectively. Moreover, Cu1.96S was precipitated from the Cu1.8S matrix. The HRTEM results show that the Cu1.96S lattice is nested in the Cu1.8S lattice to form a distinctive composite structure. This special structure will contribute to a better TE performance. However, there is a region of atomic perturbation in the HRTEM images, which indicates that the precipitate increased the complexity and the degree of disorder of the system. These findings will affect the electron and phonon scattering behavior differently because of diverse scattering properties, which improve the Seebeck coefficient and reduce the thermal conductivity.

3.2 Thermoelectric properties
The DSC curves of all the bulk samples are shown in Fig. 6(a). The results confirmed that the phase-transition temperature is approximately 360 K for samples with a milling time of 1 h, and as the milling time increased, the phase-transition temperature of the sample also gradually increased. The main phase (Cu1.8S) of the sample was maintained for 18 h. Moreover, the Cu1.96S second phase affected the performance of the sample. The Cu–S phase diagram showed that Cu1.8S has only one phase-transition point and a phase-transition temperature of approximately 361 K. As the atomic percentage of copper increased, the phase-transition temperature gradually increased. The phase-transition temperature of the sample was shifted to a higher temperature with increasing ball milling time due to the increased contents of the Cu1.96S second phase with higher phase-transition temperature. This phenomenon was also observed in the DSC test results. In Fig. 6(b), the electrical conductivity (σ) of all the samples first increased and then decreased with increasing temperature, which indicated the turning point of σ. The appearance of the turning point at 361 K for pure Cu1.8S, which was sintered for 1 h, can be explained by a phase change (the Cu ion positions were changed). The turning point of σ, which indicates a variation in the conduction mechanism from a semiconducting to metallic behavior, is attributed to the order–disorder phase transition in the Cu1.8S host phase from a low-temperature rhombohedral phase to a high-temperature cubic phase with increasing temperature. The σ turning point shifted to 380 K after a milling time of 18 h, which indicates an elevated phase-transition temperature. The high σ turning temperature was attributed to the variation in the S content in the Cu1.8S matrix phase, which was caused by the formation of the Cu-rich Cu1.96S second phase, as supported by the XRD results.16 The 1 h milling time demonstrated the largest σ (up to 2700 S cm−1) at the turning point (361 K). An increase in the sintering temperature led to a decrease in the σ value due to the scattering role of the second phase and pores. The largest σ at the turning point dropped to approximately 600 S cm−1 for an 18 h milling time. The σ values for the samples continuously decreased with increasing milling time due to the decrease in both the carrier concentration and mobility, as shown in Table 2. Hall measurements were conducted at room temperature and the carrier concentrations and mobilities are shown in Table 2. The carrier concentration decreased from 5.03 × 1020 to 2.29 × 1020 cm−3 with increasing milling time. The decrease in carrier mobility is due to the decrease in relative density, the large quantity of pores and Cu1.96S impurities.16,49,50 Cu1.8S is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor with holes as the majority carriers. Sulfur vacancies were generated in the bulk sample and can lead to a decrease in the carrier concentration because the sulfur ion vacancies will introduce electron carriers in a p-type matrix.51,52

The Seebeck coefficients (α) in Fig. 6(c) are positive for all samples, which indicates a p-type conductive behavior with a main hole carrier. The α value increased from 19 to 95 μV K−1 for the bulk sample with a milling duration of 1 h when the temperature was increased from 323 to 773 K. For other bulk samples, the increased α value was due to the appearance of impurities, which reduced the carrier concentration and expanded phonon scattering. Hall measurements were performed at room temperature and the carrier concentrations and mobilities are shown in Table 2. The results show that the carrier concentration drops with increasing milling times, which is consistent with the decrease in electrical conductivity. According to the expression α ≈ ɤ − lnn, where ɤ is the scattering factor and n is the carrier concentration, α is proportional to ɤ and inversely proportional to n. The upper α value obtained by adding milling times is attributed to the decreased n and the increased ɤ, which is ascribed to the enhanced carrier scattering by impurities. The increased porosity and impurity phases in the bulk material led to α values of 121 μV K−1, 113 μV K−1, 125 μV K−1 and 128 μV K−1 at 773 K for the samples with milling durations of 3 h, 7 h, 12 h and 18 h, respectively. It is worth noting that the 3 h sample has higher α values than the 7 h sample. We tried to find the reason. In Fig. 4(e), the HRTEM image shows that the Cu1.96S lattice is nested in the Cu1.8S lattice to form a distinctive composite structure. The 7 h sample was also observed by TEM; there is no similar structure. The Cu1.96S is just the common second phase in the Cu1.8S matrix. Thus this special structure is supposed to contribute to the increase in the complexity of the system and the increase in the degree of disorder, all these will increase the carrier scattering which will improve the Seebeck coefficient. This special structure is more effective to improve the Seebeck coefficient than common precipitates.

Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the calculated electronic band structures for the high-temperature cubic phase of stoichiometric Cu1.8S and Cu1.96S. It is clear that this system is either metallic or semimetallic. At first, the system appears to have a zero-band gap, but we believe that it most likely has a negative band gap of −1 eV or an overlap of 1 eV at the point. These calculations contradict the experimental results of the semiconducting nature of Cu1.8S. One possible reason for this contradiction is that the antifluorite structure is strongly oversimplified compared with the experimentally reported structures.22 However, LDA is known to underestimate band gaps and may turn a small band gap semiconductor into a semimetal.53–55Fig. 7(c) and (d) show the calculated total density of states (DOS) and the Fermi levels for stoichiometric Cu1.8S and Cu1.96S. For Cu1.96S, the Fermi level at the state density was closer to 0 eV, which indicates that its conductivity is worse than that of Cu1.8S and is consistent with the experimental structure.

According to the above σ and α values, the power factor (PF = α2σ) values of all the samples were calculated, as shown in Fig. 6(d). All the samples showed a similar positive temperature dependence of PF despite having different slopes. This trend is similar to the variation in α. With an increase in the test temperature, the power factor of the sample significantly increased because the Seebeck coefficient rapidly increased with temperature and the power factor and the square of the Seebeck coefficient are proportional. The PF value showed a decreasing trend with an increasing milling duration from 1 h to 18 h mostly due to a sharp decrease in σ. Despite a strong coupling of σ and α properties, an overall benefit to the thermoelectric power factor is often achieved in the milling duration. For example, the power factor of the 3 h ball-milled sample increased from 111 to 1552 μW m−1 K−2 as the temperature increased from 323 to 773 K. Additionally, this power factor is the highest-value power factor in the literature for a Cu–S system.17
The thermal diffusivity values (D) at 323–773 K for all bulk samples are plotted in Fig. 8(a). The results demonstrate that the D of all samples first increased and then decreased with rising test temperature. This trend corresponds to the phase transition of Cu1.8S from a low-temperature to a high-temperature digenite structure (from hexagonal to cubic). This situation was supported by the Cu–S phase diagram,56 which shows that the phase-transition temperature in stoichiometric Cu1.8S is lower than that of nonstoichiometric Cu1.8S rich in Cu. The low-temperature digenite rhombohedral phase shows an increase in D with increasing temperature. Above the phase-transition temperature, the high-temperature digenite cubic phase showed a decrease in D with increasing temperature, which indicates the high disorder of the liquid-like copper ions and an enhanced Umklapp phonon scattering effect.17,57 The temperature dependent Cp data are shown in Fig. 8(b) where we can see a λ-shape peak at around 366 K for the samples at 7 h, 12 h and 18 h due to the high contents of Cu1.96S. In Cu–S and Cu–Se systems, the phase transition from the monoclinic phase to the hexagonal phase will lead to a turning point in the Cp curve, but the phase transition from the hexagonal phase to the cubic phase will not.42

In Fig. 8(c), the thermal conductivity (κ) value at a sample milling duration of 1 h is 2.11 W m−1 K−1, which is much higher than that (<1 W m−1 K−1) of other sulfide TE materials.57,58 The high κ of Cu1.8S may be due to its high electrical conductivity, which leads to high electronic thermal conductivity. Because of the formation of both the second Cu1.96S phase (Fig. 3) and pores (Fig. 4(d) and (e)), the κ values for the 12 and 18 h sample-milling times clearly decreased. The lowest κ value is 1.06 W m−1 K−1 for a sample with an 18 h milling time, which also has the lowest relative density of 86% and a large pore percentage of 10.3%. The samples with high Cu/S atomic ratios possess a low κ in the entire temperature range. This result is reasonable since the contribution of the electronic thermal conductivity (κc) in the total κ decreased with increasing Cu/S atomic ratio according to the Wiedemann–Franz law (κcarrier = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number). Generally, the lattice thermal conductivity (κL) can be obtained by subtracting the carrier concentration from the measured κ. However, in this study, an accurate κL is difficult to obtain because the complex crystal structures, various phase transitions and different carrier concentrations would lead to an inaccurate L and an uncertain temperature dependence.59
The temperature dependence of ZT is shown in Fig. 8(d). The ZT values of all samples increased with increasing temperature. Although a 3 h milling time bulk sample possessed the maximum power factor among all samples, their relatively large κ values limited the attainment of high ZTs. Benefiting from a low κ value, the ZT at 773 K reached 0.68 and 0.71 for the sample milling times of 7 and 12 h, respectively. Thus, an enhanced TE property is expected through further optimization of the chemical doping or the Cu–S stoichiometric adjustment. The improved ZT values of the Cu–S system composite, which make it an environmentally friendly and low-price material, are desired for energy recovery from waste heat.
4. Conclusions
A p-type polycrystalline Cu1.8S material with a high density (>95%) was synthesized using MA and SPS techniques. The electrical transport properties and thermal conductivity of all the bulk samples were significantly affected by the ball-milling time. The electrical conductivity of the Cu1.8S bulk sample decreased with increasing ball-milling time due to the increased Cu1.96S content. At the same time, the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing milling time, which resulted in an enhanced power factor. The Cu1.8S bulk material that was sintered via SPS using the powder treated by MA for 3 h obtained the highest power factor of 1552 μW m−1 K−2 at 773 K, which is 40% higher than that of pristine Cu1.8S. Benefiting from a low κ value, the ZT at 773 K was 0.68 and 0.71 for the sample milling times of 7 and 12 h, respectively. The results indicate that the MA process should be optimized prior to doping and other adjustments.
