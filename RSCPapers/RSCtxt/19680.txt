    , Accepted 16th November 2012First published on 16th November 2012AbstractThe solvent dependent photochemistry of fenofibric acid (FA) was studied by femtosecond transient absorption and nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman experiments and density functional theory calculations. In acetonitrile-rich solution, a typical nπ* triplet state FA (3FA) is formed through a highly efficient intersystem crossing and then the 3FA species undergoes some reaction with water to generate a ketyl radical intermediate at low water concentrations. In contrast, nπ* 3FA changes from a reaction with water to generate a ketyl radical intermediate at lower water concentrations to a decarboxylation reaction with the assistance of water molecules to produce a biradical intermediate at higher water concentrations in water-rich solutions. The decarboxylation reaction leads to the formation of the FA carbanion in 50% phosphate buffer solution and the FA carbanion is observed on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale and the cleavage of the FA carbanion gives rise to the enolate 3− anion at later nanosecond delay times. As regards fenofibrate (FB), it only exhibits a benzophenone-like photochemistry, which consists of some reaction with water to generate a ketyl radical intermediate, being observed in the different aqueous solutions.
Introduction
Fenofibrate (FB) can act as a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to produce the active fenofibric acid (FA) metabolite. This metabolite is responsible for the primary pharmacodynamic effects of reduction in total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides as well as other biological effects.1 FA may also serve as a hypolipidemic drug circulating in the blood stream after the metabolism of the commercial prodrug FB.2,3 FA contains a benzophenone (BP) group; the photochemical behavior of FA has been investigated and FA was found to have a high quantum efficiency of the intersystem crossing (ISC) that transformed the singlet excited state into the triplet state.4 The UV/Vis absorption of ground state FA extends over the UV-A part of the solar spectrum5 and this feature causes FA to result in photosensitized DNA damage6 as well as peroxidation of fatty acids7 and red blood cell hemolysis.8 A study on DNA damage photoinduced by FA and ketoprofen (KP) suggested that the phototoxic effect of FA was somewhat lower than that of KP.6 Miranda and co-workers reported that FA usually underwent two different photodegradation pathways in methanol solvent. The free acid exhibited typical BP photochemical behavior while the dissociated form of FA was the predominant form in an aqueous solution with a buffer at pH = 7.4. Photolysis of the dissociated form of FA gave rise to a relatively low quantum yield of the ISC process to produce a triplet state FA anion that would then undergo a decarboxylation reaction irreversibly to form a biradical carbanion intermediate or cyclization to give an intramolecular light-absorbing transient species.9,10 Then the biradical carbanion intermediate would undergo ISC and protonation before or after rearrangement to yield two products: 4-chloro-4′-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-benzophenone and 4-chloro-4′-isopropoxybenzophenone.9,10 A laser flash photolysis (LFP) and two photon ionization studies of FA in water solution suggested that an inversion of the lower triplet state of FA (nπ* to ππ*) may occur when changing the solvent from acetonitrile (MeCN) to water. This could possibly account for the lower reactivity of FA and its photoproducts as compared with KP in aqueous media.10 The formation of a ketyl radical detected in the LFP experiments in ethanol confirmed that a hydrogen abstraction reaction takes place which is a typical reaction for an nπ* triplet state FA (3FA).11 In contrast with FA, the photophysical and photochemical character of KP has been extensively studied, and it was found that the triplet state KP (3KP) with nπ* character easily undergoes the hydrogen abstraction reaction in stronger hydrogen donor solvents or the decarboxylation reaction in phosphate buffer solution (PB, pH = 7.4) and basic aqueous solutions.12–17 Our recent studies showed that even the neutral form 3KP may generate a triplet protonated carbanion biradical species by an excited triplet state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) mediated decarboxylation process with the assistance of water or acidic molecules in high water concentration or acidic aqueous solutions, while the neutral form 3KP preferred to undergo some reaction with water to generate a ketyl radical species in lower water concentration solutions.18,19 Since both FA and KP contain a BP parent group (the molecular structures of FA, FB and KP are shown in Scheme 1), they may have a similar electronic structure and solvent dependent photochemistry. However, there are relatively few studies on the photochemistry of FA except for preparative irradiation studies,7,20 several LFP experiments9,10 and ns-TR3 investigation in non-aqueous solvents.21 To our knowledge, the vibrational spectra of the intermediates observed from the photochemical reactions of FA in aqueous solutions are not yet available. In an attempt to gain insight into the nature of the intermediates and reaction mechanisms of FA in aqueous solutions, femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman (ns-TR3) spectroscopy were employed to directly investigate the solvent dependent photochemistry of FA in the different aqueous solutions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also carried out to better understand the properties and vibrational modes of the intermediate species observed in the ns-TR3 experiments.

Experimental and computational methods
FA was prepared according to the methods reported by Scaiano and Miranda and coworkers.10 FB samples were commercially obtained from Aldrich (with 99% purity) and were used as received. Spectroscopic grade acetonitrile (MeCN), potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and deionized water were used to prepare various solvents for the experiments reported here. PB was prepared by mixing 2.314 mM KH2PO4, 7.384 mM Na2HPO4 in 1000 ml of deionized H2O with a final pH = 7.4. Unless noted, the sample solutions of FA and FB employed in the ns-TR3 experiments were all with a concentration of 1.5 mM. All of the mixed solvent ratios are volume ratios.
The fs-TA experiments were done using an experimental apparatus and methods discussed in detail previously.21,22 The fs-TA measurements were performed based on a femtosecond Ti:sapphire regenerative amplified Ti:sapphire laser system and an automated data acquisition system. At each temporal delay, data were averaged for 2 s. For the present experiments, the sample solution was excited by a 267 nm pump beam (the third harmonic of the fundamental 800 nm from the regenerative amplifier). The 50 ml solutions were studied in a flowing 2 mm path-length cuvette with a sample concentration of 0.32 mM throughout the data acquisition. The raw spectra obtained for FA in water solutions contain an overlapping contribution from the sample absorption and solvated electrons produced by a modest amount of two-photon ionization of the water when 267 nm was used for photoexcitation. The hydrated electron has a strong absorption at about 600 nm. Therefore, subtraction of the hydrated electron signal produced from the water solvent should be done in order to minimize the influence of the signal. After subtraction, the delta-axis is below 0.01 and the baseline of all of the transient absorption spectra is almost below 0.01. Therefore, most of the contribution of the hydrated electron signal has been removed in the spectra shown. The detailed method for this subtraction was described in previous work.23
The ns-TR3 experiments were done using an experimental apparatus and methods discussed in detail previously.24,25 The 299 nm was used as the pump laser and 341.5 nm was used as probe laser in the ns-TR3 experiments. The energy for the pump and probe pulses was in the range of 2.5–3.5 mJ with a 10 Hz repetition rate. The time resolution for the ns-TR3 experiments was approximately 10 ns. The pump and probe laser beams were focused onto the flowing sample system. The Raman signal was accumulated for 30 s by the CCD before reading out to an interfaced PC computer and 10–20 scans of the signal were added together to get a resonance Raman spectrum. The ns-TR3 spectra presented here were obtained by the subtraction of a resonance Raman spectrum with a negative time delay of −100 ns (probe-before-pump spectrum) from the resonance Raman spectrum with a positive time delay (pump–probe spectrum) and the Raman shifts were calibrated using the known Raman bands of MeCN solvent with an estimated accuracy of 5 cm−1. A Lorentzian function was applied to integrate the relevant Raman bands to determine the decay and growth kinetics of the species observed in the experiments.
Density functional theory (DFT) computations were used to explore the properties of the probable intermediates that may be generated after irradiation of FA and FB in the different solvents. The optimized geometries, vibrational modes and the vibrational frequencies for the different species were obtained from (U)B3LYP DFT calculations employing a 6-311G** basis set. No imaginary frequency modes were observed at the stationary states of the optimized structures shown here. The Raman spectra were obtained using the default G03 method that used determination of Raman intensities from transition polarizabilities calculated by numerical differentiation, with assumed zero excitation frequency (e.g. the Placzek approximation). The calculated Raman frequencies from the UB3LYP/6-311G** computations were scaled by a factor of 0.975 to compare with the experimental Raman results in order to make vibrational assignments. All of the calculations were done using the Gaussian 03 program suite.26
Results and discussion
Photochemistry of FA in water:acetonitrile mixtures

A. Steady-state UV/Vis absorption spectra and femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) studies of FA in water:acetonitrile mixtures. 

Fig. 1 shows UV/Vis spectra of fenofibric acid (FA) recorded in neat MeCN, MeCN–H2O (9:1), MeCN–H2O (3:7), MeCN–PB (pH = 7.4, 1:1) solvents. The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of FA has a strong absorption at 284 nm and a relatively weak absorption at 258 nm in neat MeCN. This indicates that an electron-donating group has no noticeable influence on the ππ* band near 260 nm but induces a strong absorption at longer wavelengths.10 Addition of water into MeCN does not change the feature and relative intensity of the absorption of FA, it just makes the absorption bands shift to the red compared to the spectrum obtained in neat MeCN. For instance, two absorption bands shift to around 264 and 297 nm in MeCN–H2O (3:7) solution respectively. The H-bonding solvent effect in aqueous solution may account for the red-shift of the absorption bands. Thus the ground state FA should mostly be the undissociated form in the water–acetonitrile mixtures as it is same with the case in MeCN.21
 Fig. 1  Shown are the normalized UV/Vis absorption spectra of FA in the different solvents with labels shown on the top right corner. 

Fig. 2 and 3 display the fs-TA spectra of FA obtained in an MeCN–H2O (9:1) mixture with a delay time from 0 to 3000 ps after 267 nm excitation. In an attempt to clearly present the spectral changes at different time scales, the temporal spectral variations of the early (within 1 ps) and middle (within 60 ps) times are given separately in Fig. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 shows that one absorption band grows rapidly and shifts from 325 nm at 0.29 ps to 346 nm at 0.79 ps and reaches the maximum within one picosecond. Later, the maximum absorption band at 346 nm declines rapidly and shifts down to 342 nm after 60 ps and another strong absorption band at 533 nm accompanied by a relative weak shoulder feature around 460 nm gradually arises in the same time at the expense of the band around 346 nm (as shown in Fig. 3 (left)). The slight blue shift of the strong band from 542 nm (MeCN) to 533 nm (MeCN–H2O (9:1)) should be due to the influence of hydrogen bonding in the low water concentration solution.21 The growth kinetics of the 346 nm band (Fig. 2) can be fitted by a one exponential function with a ca. 0.28 ps time constant. The spectra at very early times (such as 0.79 ps) in Fig. 2 are assigned to the S1 → Sn transition absorption from the S1 (nπ*) singlet state. In Fig. 3, with the decrease of the peak at 346 nm, the peak at 533 gradually increases with an isosbestic point being observed around 398 nm. This implies that a noticeable amount of S1 transforms into T1 by the ISC process, resulting in a similar well-known BP-like absorption which corresponds to the T1 → Tn transition with a maximum transient absorption at 346 and 533 nm in 90% MeCN solution. The dynamics of the temporal spectra are monitored at 346 and 533 nm and are displayed in Fig. 3 together with exponential fittings of the experimental data points. The evolution of spectra at 533 nm can be fitted by a two exponential function with time constants of t1 = ca. 0.28 ps, t2 = ca. 10.0 ps in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution. The short growth time constant is due to the ultrafast internal conversion (IC) from Sn directly to S1 (S1 also has a contribution at 533 nm), and the longer one (10.0 ps) is caused by the ISC from S1 to T1. The ISC time constant (ca. 10 ps) from S1 to T1 is essentially the same as the ISC time constant (10 ps) observed for BP28 and this implies that the substituents in the aromatic ring do not have much influence on the ISC rate of FA. The triplet assignment is also supported by the behavior of later decay times in 90% MeCN solution. After the generation of 3FA, the fs-TA spectra obtained in 90% MeCN solution show little change within 3200 ps (as displayed in Fig. 3 (right)).
 Fig. 2  Shown are transient absorption spectra of FA at early (from 0.29 to 0.79 ps) picosecond times recorded with 267 nm excitation in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution. 
 Fig. 3  Shown are transient absorption spectra of FA at early picosecond times in MeCN–H2O (9:1) (left). The temporal dependence of transient absorption spectra for FA recorded at 346 nm and 533 nm within 3200 ps (right). 
Similar fs-TA experiments were performed in a MeCN–H2O (3:7) aqueous solution, and the TA spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The fs-TA spectra recorded in the higher water concentration solution display different results compared with those recorded in the lower water concentration solution and in neat MeCN. At very early picosecond times, a strong absorption band at around 346 nm is first observed, which results from the S1(ππ*) → Sn transition state.29 After that, a main strong band at 450 nm and a broad shoulder feature at 526 nm are formed when the 346 nm band decays and shifts from 346 nm to 335 nm. The spectrum of the second transient species closely resembles the nπ* 3FA obtained in alcohol solvent that has maximum absorption bands at 340 and 520 nm.8 But this is different from the so-called ππ* 3FA (360 and 460 nm) observed in a phosphate buffer solution.9 Therefore, the transient absorption bands at 335, 450 and 526 nm are tentatively assigned to a T1(nπ*) → Tn transition absorption. The transient absorption of nπ* 3FA obtained in 70% water solution shows a hypsochromic shift compared with the spectra obtained in 10% water solution (from 533 to 526 nm and from 342 to 335 nm). On the other hand, the relative intensity of the shoulder band around 450 nm in 70% water solution is slightly stronger than that at 450 nm obtained in 10% water solution. This is probably caused by more hydrogen bonds interacting with the nπ* 3FA in the higher water concentration solutions.29 Therefore, the fs-TA spectra show an apparent difference in 70% water solution in contrast to that of 10% water solution and neat MeCN.21 As displayed in Fig. 4 (middle), the 3FA begins to decay at later picosecond times, the absorption band at 335 nm declines and shifts up to 354 nm as the delay time increases and this is accompanied with the shoulder band at 450 nm descending and the band at 526 nm ascending a little bit. This process is tentatively assigned to a triplet excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) with the assistance of water molecules that will give rise to a zwitterionic form subsequent to the ESIPT process. After 500 ps, the band at 354 nm gradually rises and shifts down to 341 nm. In contrast, the band at 450 nm decreases and shifts down to 445 nm which is accompanied by the slight descending intensity of the band at 526 nm. This indicates that the decay of the zwitterion form of 3FA leads to the generation of a new species that has its main transient absorption bands at 341, 445 nm and 526 nm. We assign this process to the decarboxylation reaction that generates a biradical intermediate and this will be further discussed in a later section. The results for FA obtained in water-rich solutions are consistent with our previous studies in which it was found that water can mediate the decarboxylation reaction of 3KP in water-rich solutions to generate a biradical intermediate.18,19 The solvent dependent fs-TA decay dynamics supports a triplet assignment and indicates that the triplet state is a reactive precursor of subsequent photochemical events seen before in water containing solvents.30
 Fig. 4  Shown are transient absorption spectra of FA at early, middle and later picosecond times in MeCN–H2O (3:7) solution. 
The time-resolved spectra obtained in 70% water solution were analyzed by a global fit and three time constants (t1 = ca. 4.8 ps, t2 = ca. 105 ps and t3 = ca. 864 ps) were obtained. The first time constant (4.8 ps) is assigned to the ISC process transforming S1 into T1. This ISC time constant is shorter than those observed in lower water concentration solutions and indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a role in influencing the properties of the 3FA species. The preceding section indicates that the 3FA observed in H2O:MeCN solutions has nπ* character (π* electrons delocalize over the carbonyl subgroups). Previous work found that the carbonyl oxygen of the p-hydroxyphenacyl (pHP) cage became more basic in the triplet state compared to the ground state.29,31–33 This leads to strengthening of the intersolute–solvent carbonyl H-bonding interaction in the triplet state relative to the ground state. The high quantum yield of phosphorescence of BP is consistent with an efficient ISC occurring via spin–orbit coupling from S1(nπ*) to T2(ππ*), followed by the rapid IC from T2(ππ*) to T1(nπ*). Thus, the unexpected short time constant of ISC from S1 to T1 in 70% water solution implies that the hydrogen bond effect will narrow the energy gap between S1 (nπ*) and T2(ππ*) and this will noticeably promote the ISC from S1 (nπ*) to T2 (ππ*), then T2 (ππ*) will return to T1 (nπ*) quickly. With the assistance of water, the neutral form of 3FA will undergo an ESIPT process and transform into the zwitterion form of 3FA. Thus, the second time constant t2 = 105 ps is assigned to the water assisted ESIPT process. However, for KP, the ESIPT process was too fast to be observed in the neutral water-rich solutions.22 The much slower ESIPT process for 3FA can be attributed to the long distance between the carbonyl group and the carboxyl group being 10.2 Å in the optimized structure of 3FA, which is significantly longer than the 5.9 Å distance of the optimized structure of 3KP. Thus, the ESIPT process is relatively slow for 3FA in contrast with the fast ESIPT process for 3KP. The third time constant of 864 ps is attributed to the decarboxylation reaction of the zwitterion form of 3FA, which leads to generating a biradical intermediate.
In an attempt to determine the possible photochemical pathways for FA in the different water concentration solutions, the photochemistry of FA was investigated by steady state irradiation of FA in MeCN–H2O (9:1) and MeCN–H2O (3:7) solutions and these results are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In both cases, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the photoproducts in the two solvents were totally different. The relative intensity ratio of the 260 and 287 nm bands in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution changes very fast. After 60 s irradiation, the absorption band at 287 nm significantly decreases. In contrast, the band at 260 nm gradually becomes more intense with increasing exposure time. However, the evolution of the UV/Vis absorption spectra in MeCN–H2O (3:7) solution is substantially different from that observed in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution. After 30 s exposure time, the strong absorption at 298 nm decreases quickly. Then the increase of the photodegradation time will lead to an increasing intensity of the strong absorption band at 265 nm and a weak shoulder band around 287 nm. These results are different from some results reported previously.10 The photolysis results of FA here lead us to propose that there may be two photochemical pathways for the irradiation of FA in the lower or higher water concentration solutions. This is consistent with the results of fs-TA studies on FA in different water solutions.


B. ns-TR3 of FA in water:acetonitrile mixtures: conversion from a ketyl radical formation reaction in acetonitrile-rich solutions to a decarboxylation reaction in water-rich solutions. 
Previous work reported that the rate constants and reaction mechanism of KP are strongly dependent on the concentration of water.19 In the case of FA, a previous study reported that an inversion of the lowest triplet state of FA (nπ* to ππ*) occurred upon going from MeCN to water solvent.10 Here, we carried out ns-TR3 experiments of FA in the different MeCN–H2O mixtures to investigate the solvent dependent photochemistry of FA. Fig. 5 displays ns-TR3 spectra of FA obtained in MeCN–H2O (9:1), MeCN–H2O (1:1) and MeCN–H2O (3:7) solutions. In the acetonitrile-rich solution (MeCN–H2O, 9:1), two intermediates are overlapped together at early nanosecond delay times and the second species reaches its highest intensity at 120 ns. In order to obtain the Raman signal of the first species, the experimental resonance Raman spectrum at 10 ns was subtracted from the experimental resonance Raman spectrum at 120 ns (the first intermediate completely disappears at 120 ns) to minimize the contribution of the second species. The comparison of the resulting resonance Raman spectrum obtained at 10 ns in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution with the one obtained at 0 ns in MeCN is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). These two spectra exhibit significant similarity to each other, providing convincing evidence that the first species is most likely a 3FA intermediate with nπ* character. This is consistent with the results of the fs-TA that nπ* 3FA does not decay appreciably up to 3000 ps. In the case of the photoionization of FA, the formation of the FA radical cation (and its subsequent intermediates) may occur and should also be considered. Therefore, DFT calculations were performed on the FA radical cation. Fig. S3 in ESI† reveals that the predicted normal Raman spectrum of the FA radical cation is significantly different from the experimental 10 ns Raman spectrum obtained in the lower water concentration solutions. However, the DFT calculation predicted that the Raman spectrum of 3FA exhibits a better reasonable agreement with the experimental Raman spectrum obtained at 10 ns from ns-TR3 experiments (as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†)). Therefore, the second transient intermediate (346 nm, 533 nm) observed in the time range from picoseconds to nanoseconds is assigned to the 3FA, rather than the FA radical cation intermediate.
 Fig. 5  ns-TR3 of FA in the MeCN–H2O (9:1) (left), MeCN–H2O (1:1) (middle) and MeCN–H2O (3:7) (right) solutions obtained at various delay times indicated next to the spectra. The asterisks (*) mark subtraction artifacts. 
As the 3FA species decays, the second species begins to be predominant and its main Raman bands are located at 728, 758, 806, 995, 1082, 1121, 1177, 1558 and 1583 cm−1. A comparison of the resonance Raman spectrum of FA obtained in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution at 120 ns with the spectrum obtained in 2-propanol at 20 ns (shown in Fig. 6) exhibits an excellent correlation with each other; this implies that the second species obtained in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution can be assigned to the FA ketyl radical intermediate whose optimized structure is shown in the ESI.† A ketyl radical was mainly generated from the triplet state apparently reacting with water which is similar to previous results of BP and KP in neutral lower water concentration solutions.16,17,34 The intensity of Raman spectra of the FA ketyl radical species gradually increases as the water concentration increases from 10% to 50%. This suggests that water molecules play a role in the generation of the ketyl radical species. Therefore it appears that the ketyl radical mainly results from some reaction of 3FA with H2O. Because a relatively high concentration of FA was used in the experiments, self-reaction of 3FA with ground state FA to generate a ketyl radical cannot be completely excluded to somewhat contribute to the signal. At this point, the precise mechanism for the generation of the ketyl radical in aqueous solutions is not clear and further work to be reported later is in progress to better elucidate the mechanism(s). After some reaction with water, the 3FA may form the ketyl radical species and possibly an OH radical if the reaction is hydrogen abstraction in nature. For KP and BP, any OH radical formed may react with the KP and BP at the para position of the benzene ring to form a light absorbing transient (LAT) that has several hundred microsecond lifetimes. For FA, the two para positions are occupied by Cl and –OR groups, therefore, the FA ketyl radical does not easily react with the OH radical at the para positions due to a steric effect and a higher energy barrier. This may account for why the LAT species was not observed in the ns-TR3 experiments at later delay times. Scheme 2 displays a proposed photochemical pathway of FA in the acetonitrile-rich solution. Examination of Fig. 5 shows that the 3FA species decays faster in 10% water solution than in MeCN solvent and the intensity of the resonance Raman spectrum of the FA ketyl radical is enhanced compared with the results obtained in MeCN solvent. In order to obtain the kinetics of the reaction with water, the time-dependence of the characteristic resonance Raman band at 1583 cm−1 of the FA ketyl radical in MeCN–H2O (9:1) was fit by a two-exponential function and a 98 ns growth time constant and a 174 ns decay time constant were obtained (shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). The growth time constant of the FA ketyl radical (98 ns) in 10% water solution is slightly longer than the one (68 ns) obtained in IPA. This implies that water solvent is a weaker hydrogen donor than isopropanol but some reaction with water can still take place.

 Scheme 2  Proposed photochemical mechanism of FA in the acetonitrile-rich solution is displayed. 
In addition to the possibility of the 3FA species abstracting a hydrogen atom from water to generate a FA ketyl radical, another possible pathway is that the hydrated electrons are trapped by FA and then form a benzophenone-like anion. The ketyl radical could be generated by very fast protonation of this anion and the rate determining process may be the electron trapping reaction. In order to consider the formation of the benzophenone-like anion for FA, DFT calculations were done for the FA triplet state anion intermediate. Fig. S6 (ESI†) displays a comparison of the DFT predicted Raman spectrum of the FA triplet state anion and the experimental Raman spectrum obtained at 10 ns in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution. The DFT predicted Raman spectrum of the FA triplet state anion exhibits a poorer agreement with the experimental Raman spectrum at 10 ns in MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution. Therefore, the intermediate observed at 10 ns by ns-TR3 experiments appears to be the 3FA intermediate rather than the benzophenone-like anion. Previous study reported that the production of the hydrated electrons was due to biphotonic photoexcitation of FA at neutral pH when 308 nm was used a pump laser.10 The formation of the FA ketyl radical was found to be related to the hydrated electrons and the concentration of the FA ketyl radical exhibited an exponential curve relationship with the power of the pump laser. In ns-TR3 experiments here, a 299 nm wavelength was used as the pump laser and the laser spot size was about 2 mm. In order to determine whether the formation of the FA ketyl radical is a one photon or a two photon process, power dependence experiments were done in neutral MeCN–H2O (9:1) solution and Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows that the integrated intensity of the FA ketyl radical (1583 cm−1) seems to have a linear relationship with the power of pump laser. This suggests that the formation of the FA ketyl radical is likely to be mainly a one photon process in our experiments.
In MeCN–H2O (1:1) solution, the 3FA species was only observed at 0 ns and then it swiftly disappears and transforms into a new species. Except for two Raman bands at 770 and 836 cm−1, the main resonance Raman bands at 728, 994, 1082, 1121, 1175, 1558 and 1583 cm−1 within 50 ns are still the same as the ones obtained in IPA solvent. Besides, a shoulder Raman feature (806 cm−1) close to 836 cm−1 appears at 10 ns. With the increase of the delay time, the 770 cm−1 Raman band gradually shifts down to 758 cm−1 as is highlighted by the dotted line in the figure and the 836 cm−1 band disappears at 80 ns while the 806 cm−1 Raman band gradually becomes more intense (shown in Fig. 6). By careful inspection of Fig. 5 (middle), it was found that the intermediate after 200 ns can be assigned to the FA ketyl radical due to the Raman spectrum obtained at 200 ns in MeCN–H2O (1:1) solution being essentially the same as the one obtained in IPA solvent. Now that the Raman bands at 728, 758, 806, 995, 1082, 1121, 1177, 1558 and 1583 cm−1 are attributed to the FA ketyl radical, there still remains an unknown new intermediate coexisting with the FA ketyl radical within 200 ns due to the appearance of Raman bands at 770 and 836 cm−1 and some small shifts of other Raman bands. In order to completely distinguish these two intermediates, ns-TR3 experiments of FA were carried out in the higher water concentration solution (MeCN–H2O, 3:7). Fig. 5 (right) reveals that only one intermediate is detected from the beginning to the end delay times being examined in the experiments. The intensity of Raman spectra for this intermediate reaches its maximum at 20 ns and then begins to decrease at later delay times. The characteristic Raman band of 770 cm−1 continues to shift up to 772 cm−1 as the water concentration increases from 50% to 70% and the intensity of this Raman band increases as well. Except for this band, the intermediate observed in the higher water concentration solution still includes the 728, 836, 995, 1082, 1121, 1174, 1489, 1560 and 1582 cm−1 Raman bands. Previous work reported that KP exhibits a significant water concentration dependent photochemistry: the 3KP undergoes some reaction with water to produce a ketyl radical species in the acetonitrile-rich solutions while the 3KP predominantly prefers to undergo a decarboxylation reaction to evolve a triplet protonated biradical carbanion species in the water-rich solutions.18,19 Therefore, FA probably also displays a water concentration dependent photochemistry behavior. Fig. 7 displays a comparison of the resonance Raman spectrum of FA obtained in 70% water solution to the calculated Raman spectrum for the FA biradical intermediate. These two spectra exhibit an excellent correlation with each other of their vibrational frequency pattern which implies that the intermediate observed in 70% water solution can be assigned to the FA biradical. The optimized structures and vibrational modes of the FA ketyl radical and biradical are shown in the ESI.† For the FA biradical intermediate, the radical can be delocalized in the benzene ring, which causes the bond length of the benzene ring to be slightly shorter than the analogous one in the FA ketyl radical. This possibly accounts for the shift of Raman bands seen in the Raman spectra of the FA ketyl radical and FA biradical.

In the water-rich solutions, a water bridge may shuttle a proton from the carboxyl group to the carbonyl group, which will lead to the occurrence of the decarboxylation reaction of the 3FA similar to the reaction observed for 3KP in the higher water concentration solutions.18 The decarboxylation reaction of 3FA species will take place to some extent even in 50% aqueous solution, while it is barely observed for KP under the same conditions. This implies that the substituents (chlorine atom and o-alkyl group at para positions) on the BP play a critical role in the photochemistry of 3FA species. In an attempt to determine whether the FA biradical has triplet character, quenching experiments were done in open air and under oxygen purged conditions. The results indicate that the FA biradical could be obviously quenched by oxygen (see results shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). This demonstrates that the FA biradical has a characteristic triplet property. Consequently, in the lower water concentration solution, the 3FA prefers to undergo a reaction with water to form a FA ketyl radical species, however, as the water concentration increases, especially in 70% water solution, the majority of 3FA seems to undergo the decarboxylation pathway to generate a biradical species with the assistance of water molecules. Previous study reported that the lifetime of 3FA in the acetonitrile-rich solution is 20 times shorter than that in water and 3FA reacts readily with hydrogen donors in the organic solvents but is less reactive in water.10 They assigned the 3FA to a ππ* triplet in the water-rich solution. However, the issues raised from the ns-TR3 spectra of FA in the different water concentration solutions can be easily rationalized by invoking a decarboxylation reaction in the water-rich solution. A decarboxylation reaction of nπ* 3FA is predominant in MeCN–H2O (3:7) solution while the nπ* 3FA reaction with water to generate a ketyl radical prevails in the MeCN–H2O (9:1) mixture. That is why the Raman band of 758 cm−1 gradually shifts up to 772 cm−1 from 10% to 70% aqueous solution. In MeCN–H2O (1:1) solution, these two pathways coexist together: two intermediates are observed within 80 ns, one species is a FA ketyl radical formed from the nπ* 3FA reaction with water molecules; another is a FA biradical generated by the decarboxylation reaction. Finally, the FA biradical intermediate undergoes the proton shift and ISC to form the final product. Scheme 3 presents the proposed photochemical mechanism of FA in the water-rich solution.

Photochemistry of FA in PB solution: decarboxylation reaction in PB solution

1. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) studies of FA in PB solution. 
For the UV-visible absorption of FA in PB solution, however, in addition to the main absorption band red shifting to 300 nm and the second absorption band still being at about the same wavelength compared with that of FA in MeCN, the relative intensity of those two bands becomes somewhat different, indicating that the FA− anion (e.g., the dissociated form of FA) is the predominant form in PB solution due to FA having a smaller pKa of 2.9.27
After irradiation, the KP anion (KP−) will undergo a decarboxylation reaction to give rise to a carbanion species. In an attempt to confirm that FA will also undergo the decarboxylation in PB solution, in the following section, the fs-TA experiments for FA were also carried out in PB aqueous solution. Fig. 8 displays the transient absorption spectra and kinetics of FA obtained within 3200 ps. A stronger absorption at 350 nm and a shoulder absorption around 570 nm at 0.7 ps are observed firstly and then it quickly transforms into a new transition state. During the transformation the transient absorption at 350 nm decreases and shifts down to 325 nm which is associated with an increase of absorption band at 466 nm and a weak band at 535 nm. The transient absorption spectra at 350 nm are associated with the S1 → Sn IC process. Then the ISC process promotes S1 to form T1. The transient absorption of triplet state FA− (3FA− anion) in PB solution exhibits its main bands at 325, 466 and 535 nm. After the band at 466 nm reaches its maximum intensity, it subsequently begins to quickly decrease in intensity and shifts down to 450 nm within 400 ps. This is accompanied by the intensity of peak at 325 nm dropping significantly and shifting up to 366 nm over the same delay time. However, the transient absorption spectra evolution at 535 nm decays slightly during this period with the maximum finally stabilizing at 502 nm. This demonstrates that the 3FA− anion mainly decays by the decarboxylation reaction to generate a carbanion species with its main absorption bands at 366, 450 and 502 nm. A global fit of transient absorption spectra determines that there are the two time constants (t1 = 3.7 ps, t2 = 147 ps), the 3.7 ps time constant is associated with the ISC process transforming the singlet excited state FA− anion to the 3FA− anion and the 147 ps time constant is attributed to the decarboxylation of the 3FA− anion.
 Fig. 8  Shown are transient absorption spectra of FA at early (left) and later (right) picosecond times in MeCN–PB (1:1, pH = 7.4) solution. 


2. Decarboxylation reaction in PB solution. 
Photoinduced decarboxylation was found to be an efficient and general reaction for different types of arylcarboxylic acids in aqueous solution at pH > pKa.35Fig. 9 displays the ns-TR3 spectra of 1.5 mM FA in MeCN–PB (1:1) solution. As the delay time increases, the Raman bands at 770, 1170 and 1583 cm−1 gradually shift up to 784, 1180 and 1586 cm−1, respectively, and a characteristic Raman band at 1130 cm−1 for the first species slowly decays and vanishes after 400 ns. These variations imply that there are two intermediates observed in 50% PB solution. In order to obtain the spectra of first species and the second species, the contributions from other intermediates generated at the same delay time need to be removed. For example, the Raman spectrum of the first species was extracted by employing the characteristic 784 cm−1 Raman features as a marker of the second species in Fig. 9 and subtracting its spectrum from the TR3 spectra obtained in 50% PB solution. In the same way, the Raman spectrum of the second intermediate is extracted by using the characteristic 1130 cm−1 Raman features in the subtracted spectrum of the first species as a marker and subtracting its spectrum from the TR3 spectra obtained in 50% PB solution. Fig. 10 shows the extracted spectra of the first species (A) and second species (B). The first species has its main resonance Raman bands at 728, 771, 839, 985, 1077, 1131, 1170, 1554 and 1583 cm−1, the second one has its main resonance Raman bands at 728, 784, 993, 1081, 1179, 1558 and 1585 cm−1.

It has been suggested that a prompt decarboxylation of the 3FA− anion takes place to produce a carbanion in the alkaline solution in which its biradical form is the more stable resonance structure and hence the carbanion should have more biradical character.10 Miranda and coworkers reported that photodecarboxylation from the anionic form resulted in the formation of compounds 1, 2 and 3 which involved three intermediates (1−, LAT, 3−) after the FA carbanion (the structure of these species are displayed in the Fig. S12, ESI†).9 The 1− species is the resonance structure of the biradical anion, the LAT intermediate can also be generated from the biradical anion and would give rise to compound 2 after protonation. On the other hand, the presence of oxygen resulted in the formation of an additional photoproduct 3. This implies that the cleavage of the FA carbanion in the presence of oxygen would produce the enolate 3− anion, whose subsequent protonation would give rise to photoproduct 3. In the ns-TR3 experiments, the system is exposed to open air, thus oxygen is inevitably involved in the solution. Therefore, the enolate 3− anion can probably be detected in the ns-TR3 experiments. In an attempt to determine the assignment of the observed intermediates, DFT calculations predicting the total energy, the optimized geometry and vibrational frequencies for the possible intermediates were performed. Based on the results of fs-TA experiments, the 3FA− anion appears to decay within 3000 ps. Therefore, the first species (Fig. 10 (left)) observed by the ns-TR3 experiment is likely the FA carbanion intermediate. The DFT calculation predicted Raman spectrum of the FA carbanion is compared with the experimental resonance Raman spectrum of the first species observed at 20 ns (as shown in Fig. 11). This comparison shows that these two spectra exhibit a very similar vibrational frequency pattern and thus this intermediate is assigned to the FA carbanion species. We note that the FA carbanion could still be observed up to 200 ns which is consistent with the observation of the FA carbanion in basic solutions by Miranda and coworkers.10Fig. 12 shows the comparison between the experimental resonance Raman at 200 ns and the calculated Raman spectrum of the enolate 3− anion. The excellent correlation of the vibrational frequency pattern between these two spectra demonstrates that the second species can be assigned to the enolate 3− anion. The LAT intermediate was not detected in our experiments. Scheme 4 shows the proposed photochemical pathway for FA in 50% PB solution. In order to determine the relationship of the FA carbanion and the enolate 3− anion, the characteristic Raman bands at 1583 and 1585 cm−1 were fit by a two exponential function, respectively (results shown in Fig. S11, ESI†), the decay time constant (105 ns) of the FA carbanion is almost identical to the growth time constant (107 ns) of the enolate 3− anion. This implies that on one hand the dissociated 3FA− decarboxylates to give rise to the FA carbanion after excitation in a way similar to that previously reported in the alcohol mixtures in the presence of the base; on the other hand that the FA carbanion is certainly the precursor for the formation of the enolate 3− anion. In addition, the lifetime of the FA carbanion is significantly shorter than the one obtained in PB solution for KP, this may be responsible for the lower phototoxic effect of FA in the biological system. Finally, the enolate 3− anion undergoes the protonation and ISC process to form the final products.10 The calculated optimized structure of the 3FA− anion is shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). For the structure of the 3FA− anion, the C–C bond length (the carboxyl group and its nearby carbon) is 1.684 Å, which is larger than the normal C–C bond length (1.527 Å). This suggests that the decarboxylation reaction can take place because this bond is very weak. In order to distinguish the difference between the FA carbanion and enolate 3− anion, the calculated optimized structures of these two intermediates are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Selected vibrational modes associated with the observed Raman frequencies are presented in Table S1 (ESI†) and compared with the corresponding calculated vibrational frequencies for the FA carbanion and enolate 3− anion species. Most of the Raman bands observed for the FA carbanion are due to the vibrations associated with the C–C stretch motions and the ring breathing and stretching of the phenyl rings. For example, the Raman bands at 771, 839, 985, 1554 and 1583 cm−1 are mainly due to these kinds of vibrational modes. The Raman band at 1077 cm−1 is associated with the C–Cl stretch motion. The Raman band at 1364 cm−1 has contributions from the C–O stretch motions. Compared with the FA carbanion, the negative charge of the enolate 3− anion may be liable to delocalize into the aromatic ring, causing the enolate 3− anion to exhibit some quinonoidal character. Therefore, the vibrations of the C–C stretch motions and the CO stretch motions for the enolate 3− anions are inclined to move to a higher wavenumber. For example, the 784, 993, 1558, 1585 and 1640 cm−1 bands for the C–C stretch motions and the 1490 cm−1 band for the C–O stretch motion shift up compared with the corresponding vibrations of the FA carbanion. The C–Cl bond length (1.775 Å) of the enolate 3− anion is also shorter than that of the FA carbanion (1.784 Å), this leads the Raman band at 1081 cm−1 associated with the C–Cl stretch motion to change a little bit relative to the 1077 cm−1 band.

ns-TR3 of FB in different aqueous solutions: reaction with water to produce a ketyl radical
In order to gain further insight into the reaction with water to produce a ketyl radical and the water assisted decarboxylation reaction of FA in the different aqueous solutions, we also performed ns-TR3 experiments for FB in the different aqueous solutions to compare with analogous results of FA. Fig. 13 shows the ns-TR3 spectra of FB obtained in MeCN–H2O (1:1) and MeCN–PB (1:1, pH = 7.4) solutions. These results indicate that the ns-TR3 spectra of FB are almost the same in the different solutions. Only two intermediates are observed from 5 ns to 5 microseconds. At 5 ns, a weak Raman signal of triplet state FB (3FB) could be observed. It swiftly disappears and generates the FB ketyl radical through some reaction with water. A previous study reported that an inversion of the lower triplet state of FA (nπ* to ππ*) may occur when the solvents are varied from MeCN to water. If this conclusion is correct, FB should also exhibit a similar inversion of the lower 3FB (nπ* to ππ*) in the lower and higher water concentration solutions. However, the ns-TR3 spectra of FB do not show any solvent dependent photochemistry in the different MeCN:H2O solutions. Furthermore, ns-TR3 spectra of FB obtained in the water-rich solutions are the same as those obtained in PB solutions. The main reason for this may be accounted for by noting that since FB is an ester of FA, the carboxyl group is prevented from undergoing a decarboxylation reaction. Therefore, no decarboxylation reaction is easily observed for FB in solutions of different composition. In contrast, FA shows a strong solvent dependent photochemistry in the different aqueous solutions. The conversion of the reaction with water to form ketyl radicals to the decarboxylation reaction could be observed when going from a lower water concentration solution to a higher concentration water-rich solution. The water can mediate the decarboxylation of 3FA to directly generate a FA biradical intermediate as well as the 3FA− anion experiences the decarboxylation reaction to give rise to the FA carbanion on the nanosecond time scale in PB solution.

Conclusions
The photochemistry of FA in different solutions was explored by using fs-TA and ns-TR3 spectroscopic methods. In the acetonitrile-rich mixtures, an nπ* 3FA intermediate evolves at later picosecond time scale and then the 3FA forms a FA ketyl radical by some reaction with water. On the other hand, in the water-rich solutions, the nπ* 3FA intermediate predominantly experiences a water assisted decarboxylation reaction at the sub-nanosecond time scale and then generates a FA biradical with triplet character. In PB aqueous solution, the 3FA− can be observed within 400 ps time scale and then undergoes decarboxylation to form the FA carbanion species; the subsequent cleavage of the FA carbanion will lead to production of the enolate 3− anion after 200 ns. In contrast, the FB compound only exhibits some reaction with water to produce a ketyl radical in the different aqueous solutions after photolysis of FB.
