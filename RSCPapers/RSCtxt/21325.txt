    , Accepted 5th September 2016First published on 6th September 2016AbstractSemiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution from water is of great importance for solar-to-chemical conversion processes to boost and promote the future hydrogen economy. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that p-Cu3P coupled with n-TiO2 forms a novel hybrid structure which accelerates electron–hole pair separation and transfer for improved photocatalytic H2-evolution activity. The rate of H2 evolution of the optimized Cu3P/TiO2 (7940 μmol h−1 g−1) is 11 times higher than that of bare TiO2, with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 4.6%. This work may provide more insight into the synthesis of novel phosphide-based hybrid materials with high photocatalytic H2-evolution activity and sufficient stability for solar-to-chemical conversion and utilization.
Introduction
A strong dependence on fossil fuels and the overuse of such fuels can aggravate environmental pollution and bring insecurity to the future sustainable energy supply.1,2 Semiconductor photocatalysts for hydrogen (H2) production are at the forefront of sustainable solutions to such problems.3,4 It is accepted that the participation in subsequent redox reactions of photo-excited electrons and holes is the main process in photocatalysis. Thus it is necessary to maximize the high separation of charge carriers and to achieve highly efficient photochemical conversion.5 Therefore, our strategy is to construct an effective and accessible photocatalyst structure.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a well-known n-type near ideal semiconductor for H2 production from water due to its appropriate conduction band, photochemical stability, non-toxic nature and low cost, etc.6,7 However, the high photo-excited charge recombination rate and the high overpotential for H2 production on bare TiO2 surfaces still make it unsatisfactory for practical applications.8,9 Although combining TiO2 with noble metal cocatalysts can greatly enhance its photocatalytic H2production activities,10,11 these cocatalysts are too scarce and expensive to be used for large-scale energy production. The construction of heterojunctions in TiO2 structures is consistently considered to be a common method to effectively retard the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
Transition metal phosphides, in particular copper phosphide (Cu3P), have attracted much interest in recent years for their potential in acid-compatible H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, and as anode materials in lithium ion batteries.12–14 Moreover, Cu3P is a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.3–1.4 eV,15 and there has been scarce research on Cu3P in photocatalytic H2 production reactions. Wu and coworkers reported that the photocatalyst Pt/MoP2 showed a H2-evolution rate of 47.3 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible-light irradiation.16 Tian and coworkers reported that the photocatalyst of PHIV/CoP (PHIV: human immunodeficiency virus labelled at one fluorescein-based dye probe) gave a H2-evolution rate of 170 μmol h−1 under visible-light irradiation.17 In addition, the above examples can be used to illustrate the application of phosphide in photocatalytic reactions.
Herein, for the first time, we use Cu3P as a cocatalyst combined with TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) to form a highly efficient heterogeneous photocatalytic H2-evolution photocatalyst. The strong interaction existing between Cu3P and TiO2 provides a charge separation pathway across the catalyst's interface, and consequently facilitates photocatalytic H2 generation. The rate of H2 evolution of the optimized Cu3P/TiO2 is 11 times higher than that of bare TiO2. More importantly, these hybrid materials show sufficient stability after five consecutive operations of 20 h.
Experimental section
Materials
Titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2), and poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(propylene glycol)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (P123) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Diethylene glycol (DEG), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. The de-ionized water used throughout all experiments was obtained by reverse osmosis followed by ion-exchange and filtration.
Synthesis of TiO2 NPs
TiO2 NPs were prepared via a modified solvothermal method.18 In a typical synthesis, 2.4 g of P123 were completely dissolved into 80 mL of DEG with vigorous stirring at 60 °C in a flask to form a clear solution. After that, 4 mL of TiCl4 and 4 mL of NH4OH were added to the above solution with constant stirring at 220 °C for 6 h in an oil bath. After cooling to room temperature, the light-brown mud-like precipitate was washed several times with acetone and ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the products were calcined at 450 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of Cu3P
Cu3P was synthesized according to the reported method with modifications.19 In a typical procedure, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution (50 mL, 0.05 M) was mixed with excess NaOH solution (0.25 M) with magnetic stirring. After a 2 h reaction, the precipitate was washed and then dried under vacuum to obtain the Cu(OH)2 precursor. Subsequently, a mixture of Cu(OH)2 (0.05 g) and NaH2PO2 (0.25 g) was ground until uniform. After that, the sample was annealed in N2 at 300 °C for 1 h at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. Finally, the obtained black solid was collected and washed several times with distilled water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven.
Synthesis of Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid
Cu3P NPs (0.003 g) were mixed with TiO2 NPs (0.3 g) in 20 mL of de-ionized water containing 0.25 g PVP. The mixture was sonicated and stirred for 24 h. Then it was washed thoroughly with de-ionized water several times, dried, ground and annealed in N2 at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain the 1 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 (theoretical loading weight percentage of Cu3P in the hybrid photocatalyst). Similarly, 0.125 wt% Cu3P/TiO2, 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2, 2 wt% Cu3P/TiO2, and 5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 were prepared. Based on the results of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (see Table S1 in ESI†), the practical loading weight percentages of Cu3P were found to be close to the theoretical values.
Synthesis of 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO2
Pt/TiO2 was synthesized by a simple NaBH4 reduction method. Typically, 0.5 g of TiO2 powders were dispersed into 30 mL de-ionized water containing 1.33 mL of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (5 mg mL−1). The dispersion was ultrasonicated for 5 min and subsequently stirred for 30 min. Thereafter, fresh NaBH4 solution (2 mL, 10 mM) was quickly poured into the above solution and the final mixture was stirred for 30 min. Finally, the obtained precipitate was washed and dried to give the 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO2 sample.
Characterizations
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα excitation. The crystalline structures of the as-prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku D/Max-2550 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 50 kV and 200 mA in the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of the samples were measured on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) detecting absorption over the range of 300–800 nm. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were analyzed by a multipoint BET method using adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.25. ICP-AES on a PerkinElmer OPTIMA 3300DV ICP spectrometer was used to acquire ICP data. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm were measured on a FLUOROMAX-4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a field emission SEM microscope (JSM-6700F, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a Tecnai G2 S-Twin F20 TEM microscope (FEI Company). The element mappings were obtained using a HITACHI SU-8020 TEM microscope.
The lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopic measurement system consisted of a source of monochromatic light, a sample cell, a computer, and a lock-in amplifier (SR830-D SP) with a light chopper (SR540). A low chopping frequency of 24 Hz was used. A 500 W xenon (Xe) lamp (CHF-XM-500 W, Global Xenon Lamp Power) and a grating monochromator (Omni-5007, Zolix) provided monochromatic light. The samples were studied without further treatment during the SPV measurements, and the photovoltaic cell was of the structure: fluorine tin oxide (FTO)-mica-sample-FTO. The system was calibrated by a DSI200 UV enhanced silicon detector to eliminate any possible phase shift which was not correlated to the SPV response, so that any phase retardation reflected the kinetics of the SPV response.
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 7.5 mg of photocatalysts were dispersed into a solution mixture containing 375 μL of water, 125 μL of ethyl alcohol and 30 μL of naphthol by sonication at room temperature. Then 30 μL of slurry were coated onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO) electrode using the doctor blade method. Next, the resulting electrodes were dried in the air. The electrochemical analysis was carried out using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI760E Instruments, Shanghai) with a standard three-electrode cell using one of the prepared sample films, a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. A 300 W Xe lamp was used to provide the light, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. Mott–Schottky plots were recorded for the above mentioned three electrode system over an AC frequency of 1 kHz. The photocurrents were measured in the above mentioned three electrode system at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl under solar irradiation provided by a 300 W Xe lamp. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by applying an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz under open circuit potential conditions.
Photocatalytic H2 production
The photocatalytic H2-evolution experiments were performed with 0.1 g of photocatalyst suspended in a 100 mL solution containing 90 mL H2O and 10 mL TEOA, in a Pyrex glass reaction cell at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. A 300 W Xe lamp (100 mW cm−2) with cooling water (to stabilize the temperature at 277 K) was used as the UV-vis light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. H2-evolution was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with an MS-5A column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (see Fig. S1 in ESI†).
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured and calculated according to the following equation:20,21  
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the XRD patterns for TiO2, Cu3P and the hybrid material 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2. The strong peaks observed at 25.3°, 27.8°, 48.0°, 53.9°, 55.1°, 62.7°, 68.8°, 70.3°, and 75.0° can be ascribed to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) planes of anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS-65-5714; Fig. 1a).18 Moreover, the strong peaks at 36.0°, 39.1°, 41.6°, 45.1°, 46.1°, 47.3°, 51.1°, 53.4°, 54.9°, 59.0°, 66.5°, 71.8°, and 76.4° can be assigned to the (112), (202), (121), (300), (113), (122), (004), (104), (310), (222), (124), (410), and (224) planes of Cu3P (JCPDS-65-3628; Fig. 1c).19 For both 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 (Fig. 1b), and 5% Cu3P/TiO2 (see Fig. S2 in ESI†), no characteristic diffraction peaks of Cu3P were observed, indicating its low loading content and low crystallinity. The two peaks at 43.4° and 50.4° can be attributed to metallic copper (JCPDS-04-0836). Compared to pure TiO2, no evident shift in the peak positions is observed in 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2, suggesting that Cu3P particles are probably compactly attached on the surface of the TiO2 NPs, rather than doped.

XPS was next conducted to analyze the surface chemical composition and electronic state of the Cu3P/TiO2 samples. Fig. 2B shows the XPS spectra of Ti 2p. Two strong peaks for both TiO2 and Cu3P/TiO2, corresponding to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 located at 464.7 and 458.9 eV, respectively, confirm the normal state of Ti4+.22 The O 1s spectrum of TiO2 shows one strong signal centered at 530.0 eV, in agreement with the binding energy of O 1s for pure TiO2 (Fig. 2C).23 More interestingly, there is a slight O 1s XPS peak shift to higher binding energy in the Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid material, indicating that strong chemical bonding between TiO2 and Cu3P is formed.24Fig. 2D presents the Cu 2p3/2 profile with one peak located at 933.7 eV, and the P 2p region with a single peak at 133.4 eV. The peak at around 933.7 eV can be ascribed to Cu in Cu3P, and the peak at 133.4 eV suggests that there is oxidation of P from the P 2p species due to exposure in air.25–27 In addition, the C 1s XPS spectrum for pure TiO2 was analyzed and the results showed that the preparation process of TiO2 led to carbon doping into its lattice (see Fig. S3 in ESI†).

TEM images (see Fig. S4 in ESI†) of the TiO2 sample indicated the formation of irregular nanoparticles. An average diameter of ∼23 nm was calculated from the Scherrer equation:28,29, where D, k, γ, B and θ are the crystallite size, shape factor (∼0.9), wavelength of the Cu Kα radiation (1.54056 Å), half maximum line width and angle of diffraction, respectively. TEM images (see Fig. S5 in ESI†) of the Cu3P sample exhibited stacking small particles and sheets which formed irregular shapes. Fig. 3A and B show TEM images for the 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid. The HRTEM of 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 in Fig. 3C demonstrates the well-defined crystallinity of Cu3P with interlayer distances of 0.196 and 0.230 nm, which are in accordance with the (113) and (202) planes of the hexagonal phase, respectively. The adjacent well-defined lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.350 nm correspond to the (101) plane of TiO2 NPs. More importantly, this closely compacted Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid structure is of great importance for mass transport in photocatalytic water splitting. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) shown in Fig. 3D can used to confirm the presence of Cu3P in this hybrid material. Fig. S6(B–E)† shows the elemental mapping of a space region in Cu3P/TiO2 and the results suggest that Ti, O, Cu, and P elements are all homogeneously distributed in the binary composite system.

Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained to investigate the optical absorption of TiO2 and 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 samples (Fig. 4A). After the coupling of Cu3P onto the TiO2 surface, an increase in visible absorption over the wavelength range of 400–800 nm was discovered relative to the TiO2 sample. In addition, the UV-vis DRS spectra of Cu3P is shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† Band gap energies of TiO2 and Cu3P were estimated from Tauc plots of (αhν)2 against the photon energy (hν) according to the formula αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2,30 as shown in Fig. 4B. Thus the band gaps of TiO2 and Cu3P were determined to be 3.18 and 1.50 eV, respectively, by extrapolating the linear fitting. The results are close to the data reported for TiO2 (3.2 eV)31 and Cu3P (1.3–1.4 eV).15Fig. 4C and D show the valence band (VB) XPS spectra of both TiO2 and Cu3P, which were obtained to determine the electronic structures of these compounds. These show that the VB positions (EVB) for TiO2 and Cu3P are 2.84 and 2.17 eV, respectively. The conduction band (CB) positions (ECB) of TiO2 and Cu3P were calculated to be −0.34 and 0.67 eV, respectively, according to the equation: EVB = ECB + Eg.32 Herein, the calculated EVB and ECB edge positions of TiO2 and Cu3P are summarized in Table S1.† To determine exactly the types of conductivity of TiO2 and Cu3P, Mott–Schottky plots were obtained using EIS analyses as shown in Fig. 4E and F. To the best of our knowledge, a straight line with a positive slope in a Mott–Schottky plot shows that the sample is an n-type semiconductor while a negative slope shows that the sample is a p-type semiconductor. Therefore, from the curves in Fig. 4, we learn that TiO2 and Cu3P are n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively.

Fig. 5A presents a comparison of H2-evolution rates on TiO2 NPs with different amounts of Cu3P loading. Pure TiO2 shows a clearly lower H2-evolution efficiency, ca. 0.74 mmol h−1 g−1. Interestingly, having a small amount of Cu3P attached caused a dramatic increase in H2 production as compared to the pure TiO2, especially when the mass ratio of Cu3P to TiO2 was 0.5 wt%. A maximum value of 7.94 mmol h−1 g−1, which represents an increase of up to 11 times with respect to bare TiO2, and an AQE of 4.6 was obtained (see Fig. S9 in ESI†). The obtained highest activity for 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 is just slightly lower than that of 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO2 (see Fig. S10 in ESI†), and therefore we have reason to believe that the noble metal of Pt can be substituted by Cu3P in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. Notably, much greater Cu3P loading leads to a decrease in H2 production which could be caused by insufficient light absorption and a decrease in the TiO2 active sites. Therefore, by loading appropriate amounts of Cu3P on TiO2 it is feasible and significant to optimize the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid photocatalyst. A recycling test of the photocatalytic H2 evolution on Cu3P/TiO2 was performed to evaluate the photocatalytic stability during a long-term photocatalytic reaction, as displayed in Fig. 5B. Almost no decrease in H2-evolution rate was observed after five consecutive operations totaling 20 h, indicating sufficient stability of this material for H2 generation. Furthermore, after the reaction, the catalyst was recollected and characterized by XRD and no distinct alterations in the structure were found, which again reflects the robust stability of our photocatalyst (see Fig. S11 in ESI†).

In Fig. 6A, the lock-in-based SPV spectra of TiO2, Cu3P and 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 composites were obtained to explore the transfer properties of the photo-excited charge carriers of the samples.33,34 A pronounced SPV response was observed for pristine TiO2, which can be attributed to the electron transitions from the VB to the CB of TiO2, that is, the intrinsic transition (300–400 nm).35 Generally, TiO2 is a typical n-type semiconductor with an upward surface band bending, so when TiO2 is excited, the SPV spectrum shows a positive response and indicates the transfer of photo-excited holes to the surface.36 For Cu3P, no SPV response is observed in the UV-vis light region. Interestingly, the response intensity of the photoelectric signal for the 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid is significantly reduced compared to that of pure TiO2, meaning that there are more electrons transferring to the surface.37 Generally, Cu3P is a p-type semiconductor with its photo-excited electrons transfer to the surface.36 That means an internal electric field exists in the interface of n-type TiO2 and p-type Cu3P, with a field direction from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor.38,39 Under UV light irradiation, electron injection is expected from the photo-excited Cu3P into the CB of TiO2, and many more negative charges accumulate at the surface of TiO2, which reduces the photovoltage signal in the Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst. The more photo-excited electrons there are, the greater the chances that they take part in photocatalytic H2 evolution resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of Cu3P/TiO2. PL spectra were obtained to accurately study the migration, transfer, and recombination processes of the photo-excited charge carriers of the Cu3P/TiO2 samples.40Fig. 6B shows the PL spectra of TiO2 and 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 excited at 325 nm. A strong PL emission peak is observed for native TiO2, which can be assigned to the recombination of photo-excited charge carriers. In comparison, the sample of 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 shows a much weaker emission intensity, confirming the transfer of photo-excited charge carriers in the composite of Cu3P/TiO2 which enables the photocatalytic process.

Fig. 7A shows the EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2 and 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2, which can be used to characterize the charge carrier migration of the electrode materials.41,42 Clearly, a smaller impedance was observed for 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2; that is to say the introduction of Cu3P boosted the electrical conductivity of the composite and made up for the fast charge transfer of photo-excited charge carriers, resulting in an effective separation of the photo-excited electron–hole pairs. Fig. 7B shows the photocurrent transient response for bare TiO2 and 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 working electrodes with typical intermittent on–off cycles under solar irradiation at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. It can be seen that a noticeable increased photocurrent density for 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 was found as compared to that for pure TiO2, suggesting a distinct improvement in the separation and a longer lifetime of photo-excited electron–hole pairs.43,44 The photoelectrodes show a low current response in the dark, while a sharp high photocurrent was produced upon illumination; in addition, this process can be repeated many times with no obvious photocurrent density decay, once again suggesting the stability for H2 evolution of Cu3P/TiO2 hybrid materials.

On the basis of the data listed in Table S2,† we illustrate in Fig. 8 the schematic mechanisms underlying the photo-excited carrier dynamics involved in the Cu3P/TiO2 heterojunction. Fig. 8A shows the theoretical band structure for p-type Cu3P and n-type TiO2 before contact. The Fermi level of TiO2 is higher than that of Cu3P, so that when they come into contact, electrons will transfer from TiO2 with the higher Fermi level to Cu3P with the lower one until the Fermi levels for both phases are equal,45 as shown in Fig. 8B. It is generally known that an internal electric field will exist at the interface when the p-type and n-type semiconductors combine to form the p–n heterojunction, with a field direction from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor,38,46 as shown in Fig. 8C. Thus, when p-Cu3P is coupled with n-TiO2, a novel p–n heterojunction will be formed (as depicted in Fig. 8D) which can be confirmed by the XPS results. Under solar irradiation, both Cu3P and TiO2 can be activated and electrons are excited from the VB to the CB, which creates holes in the VB. CB-electrons of Cu3P transfer to the CB of TiO2 and simultaneously, VB-holes of TiO2 inject into the VB of Cu3P, which explains the existence of the internal electric field. In this way, the processes of electron–hole recombination will be eventually decelerated, leading to significantly altered carrier dynamics. Based on the results of BET surface areas (see Fig. S12 in ESI†) and SPV, it can be safely inferred that the high-efficiency separation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs in the system cause many more photo-excited electrons to participate in the H2-evolution reaction in the presence of TEOA as the hole sacrificial agent.

The Cu3P/TiO2 interaction mechanism has been discussed in detail, and its photocatalytic H2-production performance has been elaborately presented. We have successfully designed and created Cu3P/TiO2 nanohybrids, systems which are absolutely non-toxic, strongly photo-corrosion resistant and inexpensive. In addition, the 0.5 wt% Cu3P/TiO2 system can give a much higher H2-evolution activity than those previously reported for semiconductor photocatalysts, as seen in Table S3.†
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have constructed an easily fabricated and efficient Cu3P/TiO2 p–n heterojunction to achieve the high-efficiency separation of photo-excited charges in artificial photosynthetic systems. This led to a dramatically enhanced H2-generation rate of 7940 μmol h−1 g−1, which is up to 11 times that of pristine TiO2. Further investigation on the transfer properties of the photo-excited charge carriers with the help of SPV and PL provides a clear understanding of the role that Cu3P plays in cocatalyzed photocatalytic reactions. This work explores a new way of designing phosphide-based high efficiency photocatalytic reactions.
