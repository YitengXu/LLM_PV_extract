    , Accepted 29th June 2020First published on 3rd July 2020AbstractPhotocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous organic removal by dual-functional photocatalytic systems is greatly limited by the weak visible-light absorbance and charge separation of these systems, especially the ready surface back-reaction of photogenerated electrons with radical intermediates. Herein, novel aromatic ring-terminated g-C3N4 nanosheets (ARCNSs) were prepared by a one-step copolymerization process by employing quinazoline-2,4-diamine as a molecular-structure-blocking and aromatic ring-terminated edge-directing agent. With the introduction of aromatic rings onto the edges of the g-C3N4 framework, the photocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous antibiotic total organic carbon (TOC) removal was significantly enhanced. In particular, ARCNS-3 shows a H2 evolution rate of 1021 μmol h−1 g−1 simultaneous with 92.1% TOC removal from tetracycline wastewater under visible-light irradiation, much higher than the values for pristine g-C3N4 nanosheets (H2-evolution rate of 325 μmol h−1 g−1 simultaneous with 18% TOC removal). The considerably enhanced dual-functional photocatalytic activity ascribed to the aromatic rings on the edges of g-C3N4 could suppress the back-reaction between the radical intermediates and the photogenerated electrons, enlarge its surface area, extend its light-absorbance to 900 nm, and improve the charge separation at the same time. This work not only provides a promising route to enhance photocatalytic H2 production with simultaneous organic pollutant removal but also provides new insight into the reaction control of dual-functional photocatalytic systems.
1 Introduction
Hydrogen is now widely considered the most promising fossil fuel alternative owing to its high energy content and zero CO2 emissions. Solar-driven hydrogen (H2) production from water splitting has been considered an attractive and carbon-free strategy and has received tremendous attention during the last few decades.1 For efficient photocatalytic H2 production, sacrificial electron donors (e.g., organic acids, alcohols, sulfide/sulfite) are generally required to scavenge photogenerated holes and suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges.2 However, the intentional addition of sacrificial electron donors is not economically suitable or practically acceptable for the future because sacrificial electron donors, such as methanol and ethanol, can serve as a kind of energy and will greatly increase the cost of photocatalytic H2 production. Therefore, novel promising systems for further industrial photocatalytic hydrogen production are urgently needed.
Recently, a series of studies have reported the replacement of sacrificial electron donors with organic wastewater in a photocatalytic H2-production system to establish dual-functional photocatalytic systems.3 In dual-functional photocatalytic systems, photocatalytic H2 production and the degradation of organic pollutants occur at the same time, achieving H2 production from industrial wastewaters, which not only reduces the cost of H2 production but also realizes wastewater purification. So far, some photocatalytic materials (e.g., g-C3N4-based,4–9 TiO2-based,10–16 and sulfide-based photocatalysts17–21) have proven to be feasible candidates for constructing dual-functional photocatalysts. However, the simultaneous photocatalytic H2 evolution and wastewater purification activity of the reported dual-functional photocatalysts are unsatisfactory, especially the TOC removal, because of insufficient light absorbance, high charge recombination, and ready surface back-reaction of photogenerated electrons with radical intermediates. Benefiting from various modified strategies,3 such as forming heterojunctions, doping, and coupling with carbon materials, to increase the light absorbance and reduce charge recombination, the H2 production efficiency of dual-functional photocatalysts was enhanced. However, compared with the H2 production efficiency, the TOC removal efficiency of dual-functional photocatalysis is far from meeting the requirements of wastewater purification. Normally, the organic pollutants in wastewater are not directly degraded but are gradually degraded to CO2 and H2O through a series of free radical intermediates in the photocatalytic hydrogen production process.22 The free radical intermediates trap the photogenerated electrons on the photocatalytic surface, not only by a competitive reaction of further radical intermediate degradation but also by consuming photogenerated electrons, which would greatly reduce the TOC removal efficiency of wastewater and the amount of H2 production. Thus, feasible strategies to increase light absorbance and reduce charge recombination, along with suppressing the surface back-reaction of dual-functional photocatalysts, are therefore highly needed.
In the current work, novel aromatic ring-terminated g-C3N4 nanosheets (denoted as ARCNSs) were prepared by a simple copolymerization method by employing quinazoline-2,4-diamine (DQ) as a molecular-structure-blocking and aromatic ring-terminated edge-directing agent for the first time. The terminal aromatic rings on the g-C3N4 edges can suppress the recombination of radical intermediates with photogenerated electrons, which facilitates the further degradation of radical intermediates. Grafting the aromatic rings in the framework of g-C3N4 edges can also enlarge its surface area, which can provide more reaction sites for the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the aromatic-ring-terminated edges formed a substituted doped level in the bandgap of g-C3N4, which increases the light absorbance of g-C3N4 and accelerates the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Consequently, outstanding enhancement of the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate and wastewater TOC removal efficiency of g-C3N4 nanosheets was achieved. This work not only provides a promising route to enhance photocatalytic H2 production with simultaneous wastewater purification but also provides new insight into the surface back-reaction control of dual-functional photocatalytic systems.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of ARCNS
In a typical copolymerization procedure,23,24 a certain amount of DQ and 5 g of urea were mixed thoroughly, and then the mixture was transferred into a crucible with a cover. The crucible was heated to 250 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and kept at this temperature for 2 h. Then, the crucible was heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1 and kept at this temperature for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the as-synthesized samples (denoted as ARCNS-1, ARCNS-2, ARCNS-3, and ARCNS-4, corresponding to DQ contents of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg, respectively) were directly used for the characterization and catalytic tests without any post-treatment.
2.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained by means of a D/max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Vector 33 Fourier infrared spectrometer. Solid-state 13C and 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Advance III 500 spectrometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were recorded by using a Bruker model A300 spectrometer with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cut-off filter (>420 nm) and an IR cut-off filter (<800 nm) as the visible light source. Diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on a U-3010 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. PL spectra of the photocatalyst powders were measured at room temperature using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a solid sample holder, and the excitation wavelength was 375 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a JEM2100F field emission electron microscope. The chemical state of the compound was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with 150 W Al Kα X-ray irradiation (Thermo ESCALAB 250). The specific surface areas of the samples were recorded through determination of the BET surface area by nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments (Micromeritics ASAP 2460).
2.3 Photocatalytic activity of H2 production with simultaneous antibiotic wastewater purification
A homemade Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system was used for the reaction. Pt was dispersed on the surface of the as-prepared photocatalyst. An AM 1.5 solar power system with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the light source. Specifically, 50 mg of catalyst was added to 50 mL of 5 mg L−1 tetracycline (TC) solution. Before irradiation, to achieve adsorptive equilibrium, the suspensions were mixed under vigorous stirring in the dark for 60 min. After the desired time intervals, the stirring was stopped to let the photocatalyst settle down, and then the top liquid was taken and centrifuged to separate the supernatant from the catalysts to analyse the concentration of residual tetracycline. The generated gases were measured by means of a gas chromatograph using argon as the carrier gas. The TOC was determined by a TOC-VCPH analyser (Shimadzu) using high-temperature combustion. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement was performed under the same dual-functional photocatalytic test, except under monochromatic light irradiation with a band-pass filter (λ = 420, 500, 600, 700 and 800 nm). The AQY was calculated according to the following formula: AQY (%) = 2 × number of evolved H2 molecules × 100/number of incident photons. In total, about 46 mg of photocatalyst was collected after an intact dual-functional photocatalytic test and the refreshing process including the washing and drying procedure. If the cycle run of the dual-functional photocatalytic test is conducted by directly using the remaining materials as photocatalysts, it is bound to result in lower H2-evolution rates and degradation efficiency of TC. Therefore, each cycle run was conducted in a similar dual-functional photocatalytic test except using 50 mg of used ARCNS-3 as photocatalyst, which is obtained by repeating the previous cycle run. For example, to obtain 50 mg of used ARCNS-3 for the 2nd run of the dual-functional photocatalytic test, the 1st run of the dual-functional photocatalytic test was conducted twice. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined using an XYL31-COD-571 analyser using high-temperature combustion. The main radical intermediates of TC under the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, Agilent 1100/Esquire HCT PLUS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Varian 3800 GC/4000 MS).
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1A displays the FT-IR spectra of CNS and ARCNS-3 (here ARCNS-3 is selected as the representative of ARCNS samples to investigate their physicochemical properties because it has the best dual-functional photocatalytic activity). The FT-IR spectrum of the ARCNS-3 sample is similar to that of the CNS sample, revealing the same characteristic structure. The peaks located at 810 cm−1 correspond to the s-triazine ring system of g-C3N4, and the peaks in the 1200–1650 cm−1 region are assigned to the typical stretching vibrations of C–N heterocycles. The broad absorption at 3000–3400 cm−1 possibly corresponds to the stretching vibration modes of the –NH2 group originating from partial condensation. However, the ARCNS-3 spectrum showed two additional slight absorption peaks at 1028 and 1204 cm−1 originating from the in-plane stretching vibrations of aromatic benzene rings, and two more intense peaks at 1450 and 1585 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the CC–C aromatic skeleton, implying that aromatic benzene rings were successfully grafted onto the g-C3N4 framework (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the grafting of aromatic rings onto the g-C3N4 framework was confirmed by direct solid-state 13C and 1H NMR tests. As shown in Fig. 1C, the obvious characteristic peaks at 157.5 and 165.8 ppm are assigned to 3s-triazine-based g-C3N4, while a new weak peak at 118.4 ppm was observed for the ARCNS-3 sample, which can be ascribed to aromatic carbon (usually located at 100–150 ppm). Fig. 1D presents the 1H NMR spectra of the CNS and ARCNS-3 samples. Two obvious peaks located at ∼4.8 ppm (residual water) and ∼9.4 ppm (amino group) were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the CNS sample. In addition, there are two weaker peaks located at ∼0.9 and ∼1.9 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of the CNS sample, which are attributed to the proton bound with the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group. Compared with the 1H NMR spectrum of the CNS sample, the 1H NMR spectrum of the ARCNS-3 sample shows two additional strong peaks located at ∼1.5 and ∼4.0 ppm, which are due to the proton bound with the carbon atom in the aromatic rings incorporated into the g-C3N4 framework. Moreover, the 1H NMR spectrum of residual water for the ARCNS-3 sample shows a clear high-field shift because of the formation of H-bonds in the ARCNS-3 sample. These results reveal that the aromatic rings were successfully incorporated into the g-C3N4 framework by a copolymerization process by employing quinazoline-2,4-diamine as a molecular-structure-blocking and aromatic ring-terminated edge-directing agent.

The crystallinity of the as-prepared CNS and ARCNS-3 samples was characterized by XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 2A. The CNS and ARCNS-3 samples show similar XRD patterns with two distinct diffraction peaks at approximately 13.0° and 27.3°, suggesting that the general graphitic crystal structure of the CNS sample does not change after grafting with an aromatic ring. The obvious peak at 27.3° attributed to the (002) crystal plane arises from the characteristic interplanar graphitic stacking of graphitic carbon nitride, while the weak peak at 13.0° attributed to the (100) crystal plane corresponds to the in-plane structural packing motif of tri-s-triazine segments.25 Remarkably, after introducing the aromatic ring into the framework of g-C3N4, the intensity of the (002) and (100) XRD peaks decreased because of the reduced interplanar order of the g-C3N4 nanosheets and the structural deformation of the tri-triazine units. In addition, a slight negative shift of the (002) XRD peak for the ARCNS-3 sample can be observed (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the looser stacking between layers in the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The reduced interplanar order and looser stacking between layers in the ARCNS-3 sample may be ascribed to the structural distortion induced by incorporating aromatic rings into the g-C3N4 framework.26

The chemical states of CNS and ARCNS-3 were investigated by XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3A, the survey spectra of CNS and ARCNS-3 demonstrate the presence of C, N and O elements without any contaminants in CNS and ARCNS-3. In the C 1s high-resolution spectra (Fig. 3B), both CNS and ARCNS-3 show chemical bonds at 288.2 eV, 286.5 eV and 284.8 eV corresponding to the N–CN sp2 carbon, O-bonding carbon and graphite sp2 carbon signals, respectively. However, ARCNS showed stronger signals at 286.5 eV and 284.8 eV. In the N 1s high-resolution spectra (Fig. 3C), the hybridized sp2 aromatic N (C–NC, 398.6 eV) in the triazine rings and bridging tertiary N peak (N–(C)3, 399.7 eV) were found in both CNS and ARCNS-3, but ARCNS-3 provided a weaker N–(C)3 signal. These results imply that the aromatic ring is incorporated into the framework of g-C3N4. Moreover, the peak attributed to amino functional groups (C–NH2, 401.0 eV) in the N 1s high-resolution spectra of ARCNS-3 is lower than that of CNS, which is ascribed to the benzene ring terminated edge leading to a lower amount of amino functional groups on the surface of g-C3N4. Fig. 3D presents the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra of CNS and ARCNS-3. Both CNS and ARCNS-3 show a single peak observed at around 532.2 eV, which is consistent with the H2O groups adsorbed on the CNS and ARCNS-3 surface.

From the analysis above, it can be concluded that the presence of DQ in the polymerization of urea brings about the grafting of aromatic rings on the g-C3N4 edges. As shown in Fig. 4A, the CNS sample is synthesized through thermal polymerization of urea without DQ. After heating, urea is first decomposed into cyanic acid and isocyanic acid by leaking NH3.27,28 Then, urea reacts with isocyanic acid to produce biuret, which further reacts with isocyanic acid to form cyanuric acid. Cyanuric acid reacts with the self-supported NH3 to form melamine, and the melamine is further polymerized to form melem. It is well known that the extension of melem to produce g-C3N4 frameworks is dependent on their side amino groups.29,30 Finally, melem can extend in all directions by means of amino groups of melem to form CNS. Fig. 4B displays the formation process of ARCNS. The difference between the formation process of CNS and ARCNS is that isocyanic acid can react with DQ to form an intermediate A (IMA), which further reacts with cyanic acid to product IMB. Then, IMB undergoes a self-nucleophilic attack and further reacts with isocyanic acid to form IMC.24 In the self-supported NH3 condition, IMC translates into a melem-like intermediate that contains an aromatic ring on its edges, which leads to the absence of an amino group on one of its sides. The side lacking an amino group in the melem-like intermediate containing an aromatic ring causes it to function as a blocking agent, which stops the extension of g-C3N4 frameworks in the direction without an amino group in melem-like intermediates. At the same time, urea turns into melem by the same decomposition pathway as that of CNS. Therefore, melem can only polymerize with melem-like intermediates in the direction of the amino group to produce an aromatic ring terminated g-C3N4. In the ARCNS, the aromatic benzene ring from DQ is bonded in the framework of g-C3N4, which enables it to survive under a high heat treatment temperature of 550 °C.

The morphology and microstructure of the CNS and ARCNS samples were detected by SEM and TEM. It is clearly seen that both the CNS and ARCNS-3 structures consist of many nanosheets with a laminar morphology like graphene (Fig. 5A and B). The corresponding EDS spectra of the CNS and ARCNS-3 samples indicate that C, N and O without any contaminants are present in these samples (Fig. S1†). A slight increase in the C/N atomic ratio from 0.694 for pristine CNS to 0.735 for ARCNS-3 reveals the successful integration of aromatic benzene rings into the g-C3N4 network. By comparing the difference in carbon atom content and the framework structure between CNS and ARCNS-3 (5 additional carbons for ARCNS-3), the molar ratio of grafted aromatic rings in the ARCNS-3 edges can be approximately calculated to be 0.28%. The TEM images (Fig. 5C and D) also clearly reveal that the CNS and ARCNS-3 samples exist as large-scale two-dimensional structures. The SEM and TEM results indicate that the introduction of DQ during the copolymerization process has a negligible effect on the formation of nanosheet structures. To further investigate the crystalline structure of the CNS and ARCNS-3 samples, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements were conducted. In Fig. 5E and F, it can be clearly seen that neither the CNS nor the ARCNS-3 sample displays any lattice fringes or diffraction spots, suggesting that the CNS and ARCNS-3 structures are amorphous.

It has been demonstrated that most g-C3N4-based materials do not show photocatalytic H2-evolution activity without a co-catalyst even in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor.25 Without a loaded co-catalyst, both CNS and ARCNS samples exhibit photocatalytic degradation of TC activity without any photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (Fig. S2A†). Therefore, the dual-functional photocatalytic activity of the CNS and ARCNS samples was tested under visible light irradiation with 2 wt% Pt as co-catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6A, CNS shows a low dual-functional photocatalytic activity, with a H2 evolution rate of 325 μmol h−1 g−1 and a simultaneous total TC degradation efficiency of 48% after 5 h of visible light irradiation. All the ARCNS samples show higher dual-functional photocatalytic activity than the CNS sample. With increasing amounts of DQ from 5 to 15 mg, the dual-functional photocatalytic activity of ARCNS increases, but it decreases when the amount of DQ is 20 mg. The ARCNS-3 sample shows the highest dual-functional photocatalytic activity, with a H2 evolution rate of 1021 μmol h−1 g−1 along with a total TC degradation efficiency of nearly 100% after 5 h of visible-light irradiation. Furthermore, the TEM images of ARCNS-3 recovered after dual-functional photocatalytic reaction tests (Fig. S2B†) show that Pt nanoparticles with diameters of about 5 nm were well dispersed on ARCNS-3. The results above reveal that CNS and ARCNS can achieve photocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous TC degradation with Pt as co-catalyst, and incorporation of aromatic rings in the framework of g-C3N4 can further enhance its dual-functional photocatalytic activity.

In order to investigate the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of TC in the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction, the different photocatalytic degradation of TC kinetic characteristics with respect to the visible-light irradiation time were fitted and are shown in Fig. 6B and C. In the blank experiment, no obvious degradation of TC was observed, suggesting that TC is stable under visible-light irradiation. As expected, ARCNS-3 shows the fastest degradation trends in the dual-functional photocatalytic systems over visible-light time, with a TC degradation rate constant of 0.907 h−1, 7.1 times higher than that of CNS (0.128 h−1). The characteristic absorption peak of TC gradually weakened within 5 h in the presence of ARCNS-3 (Fig. S3†). In the reported literature where g-C3N4-based catalysts have faster degradation kinetics for photocatalytic TC degradation,31–34 the dissolved oxygen in the photocatalytic degradation system can react with photogenerated electrons to produce superoxide radical, which is beneficial for the degradation of TC. However, there is no superoxide radical formed in the dual-functional photocatalytic system because photocatalytic H2 evolution requires anoxic conditions, which results in a relatively long reaction time required for the entire degradation of TC in our work.
Moreover, the mineralization ratio of TC in the photocatalytic reaction was detected by TOC measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 6D. After the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction, the TOC of the TC solution decreases, suggesting that TC is degraded into CO2 in the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction. The TOC removal percentage of tetracycline for all the samples is lower than the degradation percentage, suggesting that the mineralization route of tetracycline to CO2 is through serial radical intermediate degradation rather than direct decomposition. The mineralization percentage of TC for CNS is only 18%, which is much lower than its degradation percentage (48%). In contrast, the mineralization percentage of tetracycline for ARCNS-3 reaches 92.1%, only slightly lower than the degradation percentage (99%), which illustrates that incorporation of aromatic rings into the g-C3N4 frameworks can effectively promote the serial radical intermediate degradation procedure. To further confirm that the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction is driven by the long-wavelength visible absorption of ARCNS-3, a wavelength-dependent dual-functional photocatalytic experiment was also carried out under different monochromatic light irradiation conditions. As expected, ARCNS-3 shows good dual-functional photocatalytic activity under long-wavelength monochromatic light of 420, 500, 600, 700 and 800 nm irradiation (Fig. S4A†), while CNS does not exhibit any dual-functional photocatalytic activity, indicating that aromatic ring termination can indeed endow g-C3N4 with long-wavelength visible light-driven dual-functional photocatalytic properties. In addition, the AQY of ARCNS-3 was determined to be 4.43%, 2.14%, 0.84%, 0.36% and 0.10% at 420, 500, 600, 700 and 800 nm, respectively (Fig. S4B†), which further confirms the long-wavelength light-driven photocatalytic activity of ARCNS.
To detect the main radical intermediates of TC in the photodegradation process, HPLC-MS was used to identify polar intermediates with higher molecular weights. The mass spectrum intensity variation of those radical intermediates with higher molecular weights for CNS and ARCNS-3 and the corresponding m/z are shown in Fig. 7. Interestingly, the decreasing trend of tetracycline intensity for CNS slowed with prolonged illumination time, while that for ARCNS showed almost no changes. In addition, the intensity of radical intermediates with m/z of 402 and 333 for ARCNS-3 increased more rapidly than that for CNS. This can be attributed to the incorporation of aromatic rings into the framework of carbon nitride facilitating the degradation of the radical intermediates with an m/z of 416, leading to more efficient TOC removal, which is consistent with the dual-functional photocatalytic performance testing. Furthermore, GC-MS was used to identify nonpolar and polar intermediates with lower molecular weights. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1,† both radical intermediates with lower molecular weights were identified after a 2 h dual-functional photocatalytic reaction in the presence of ARCNS-3. Based on LC-MS and GC-MS, under visible-light irradiation, tetracycline (m/z = 445) is directly oxidized into the main radical intermediates with an m/z of 416 by losing the N-methyl group of the tetracycline molecule. Simultaneously, some radical intermediates with m/z of 402 and 333 were generated through the loss of hydroxyl groups, and the chromatograms of the radical intermediates exhibited an m/z of 416. As the illumination time increased, the radical intermediates with an m/z of 333 fragmented into intermediates with an m/z of 244 by the loss of CH, C, H and OH. Intermediates with low molecular weights, such as aromatic acids, were produced through ring-opening reactions, and these intermediates could be further oxidized into small organic molecules, such as organic acids and alcohols, through the cleavage of a carbon–carbon bond. Finally, all the above intermediates with low molecular weights are further mineralized into CO2 and H2O.

To study the positive effect of aromatic rings on photocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous TC degradation, the amount of H2 evolution with simultaneous TC vibrations as a function of irradiation time in the presence of CNS or ARCNS-3 was detected. It can be clearly seen that the photocatalytic degradation rate of TC and the H2 evolution rate for CNS decreased as the irradiation time increased, while the rates for ARCNS-3 were negligible (Fig. 8), similar to the result of LC-MS, suggesting that the incorporation of aromatic compounds may suppress the back-reaction of photogenerated electrons and radical intermediates.

To further study the influence of the aromatic benzene ring on the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction process, the photocatalytic H2 evolution was also detected by comparing the simultaneous TC degradation performance with the addition of an electron scavenger (Ag+) in the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction system. As shown in Fig. 9, no H2 was produced in the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction system of either CNS and ARCNS-3 with the addition of an electron scavenger (Ag+). The redox potential of Ag/Ag+ (0.80 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the redox potential of H2/2H+ (0 V vs. NHE). In addition, the metal ion was more easily bound on the surface of g-C3N4 because of stronger chemical absorption between the metal ion and the heptazine rings of g-C3N4. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons preferentially reduced Ag+ to Ag rather than reducing H+ to H2, which leads to no H2 being produced in the presence of Ag+. In contrast, the tetracycline degradation and TOC removal of CNS improved obviously, while those of ARCNS improved only slightly. This is ascribed to the electron scavenger rapidly consuming the photogenerated electron, which suppresses the photocatalytic water-splitting reduction reaction and the reverse reaction of radical intermediates with photogenerated electrons. The radical intermediates have many hydroxyl groups and some carboxyl groups, which can easily bind with the amino functional groups (C–NH2) on the surface of g-C3N4. In the ARCNS sample, the radical intermediates could not bind to the aromatic ring-terminated edges because there is no C–NH2 on the aromatic ring-terminated edges. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons accumulated on the aromatic ring-terminated edges of the ARCNS sample could not translate to the radical intermediates, which suppressed the back-reaction of photogenerated electrons and radical intermediates. However, upon the addition of an electron scavenger, the tetracycline degradation rate and the TOC removal of CNS were lower than those of ARCNS without the addition of an electron scavenger, indicating that the aromatic ring can not only suppress the back-reaction of radical intermediates with photogenerated electrons but also enhance the photocatalytic activity of CNS in other ways.

In order to further explore the other influence of the aromatic ring for improving the dual-functional photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, the surface morphology, optical and charge transfer properties of g-C3N4 with and without incorporating an aromatic ring were investigated systematically. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out to investigate the surface textural properties of CNS and ARCNS-3 (Fig. 10). CNS shows a relatively low BET surface area of 44.4 m2 g−1. After incorporation of the aromatic ring into the g-C3N4 framework, the BET surface area of ARCNS-3 increases to 64.6 m2 g−1, suggesting that incorporation of the aromatic ring into the g-C3N4 framework can improve the surface area of g-C3N4, which can provide more active sites for improving its dual-functional photocatalytic activity. In addition, the pore sizes of CNS and ARCNS-3 are mainly 30–130 nm, which results from the crinkled thin nanosheets. In addition to pores with diameters of 30–130 nm, some additional macropores with diameters of from 130 to 300 nm are found for ARCNS-3,33,34 which may be related to the increase of the surface area of ARCNS-3. These added macropores are due to structural distortion of the g-C3N4 framework formed by grafting of the aromatic ring.26 Moreover, upon increasing the amount of DQ added from 5 to 20 mg, the BET surface area of ARCNS increases (Fig. S6†). However, ARCNS-4 does not show the best dual-functional photocatalytic activity, suggesting that there are other factors in addition to BET surface area that affect the dual-functional photocatalytic activity of ARCNS.

Alterations in the optical properties of g-C3N4 with aromatic ring grafting were investigated by DRS. As shown in Fig. 11A, CNS exhibits an absorption edge at approximately 441 nm, lower than that of the reported bulk g-C3N4 (450 nm), which is ascribed to the quantum confinement effect.35 Compared with the CNS sample, all the ARCNS samples present a gradually red-shifted absorption edge. In addition, a strong absorption tail (Urbach tail) in the spectral region from 450 nm to 900 nm was observed for the ARCNS sample, and the Urbach tail edge gradually shifted to a longer wavelength as the grafted aromatic ring content increased.36 The Urbach tail edge at approximately 550 nm for the ARCNS samples corresponds to the LP–π* transition of N lone electron pairs, which was induced by the distortion of the g-C3N4 framework because of the grafting of aromatic rings.37,38 The Urbach tail is attributed to the electronic states (i.e., midgap states, denoted as MS) located within the bandgap, leading to a sub-bandgap (Et) lower than the intrinsic bandgap (Eg) of CNS. The band structures Eg of CNS and ARCNS-3 are determined by the Kubelka–Munk method, as shown in Fig. 11B. The CNS sample displays only one characteristic bandgap of 2.81 eV, which is in good agreement with the DRS results. Compared with CNS, ARCNS-3 exhibits a characteristic bandgap of 2.72 eV along with a sub-bandgap of 2.23 eV. To study whether the sub-bandgap of the CNS and ARCNS samples can promote dual-functional photocatalytic H2 evolution, the position of MS in the bandgap is fundamental. In this case, the XPS-VB spectra were used to determine the valence band (VB) positions of CNS and ARCNS-3. As shown in Fig. 11C, the VB positions of CNS and ARCNS-3 were determined to be 1.82 and 1.78 eV, respectively. The conduction band (CB) positions (ECB = EVB − Eg) of CNS and ARCNS-3 were calculated to be −0.99 and −0.94 eV, respectively. Based on a previous study,27,36,39 the value of the second bandgap could directly correspond to the distance between the valence band and the MS, which is usually ascribed to the formation of an aromatic ring-substituted level close to the conduction band bottom in the forbidden band. Therefore, the MS position (EMS = EVB − Et) of ARCNS-3 was calculated to be −0.45 eV. The band structures of CNS and ARCNS-3 are shown in Fig. 11D. The MS position of ARCNS-3 is −0.45 eV, which is located below the CB position in the bandgap of ARCNS-3. The DRS results reveal that incorporating an aromatic ring in the frameworks of g-C3N4 can extend its light absorption to long-wavelengths, which leads to higher dual-functional photocatalytic activity.

To further investigate the influence of the aromatic ring on enhancing the dual-functional photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, the photogenerated charge separation and transfer properties of CNS and ARCNS were detected by photoluminescence (PL), photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. As shown in the PL spectra (Fig. 12A), the wavelength of the PL emission peak of CNS is 460 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the DRS absorption edge (441 nm). This mismatch between the PL emission peak position and the DRS absorption edge is ascribed to the Stokes shift resulting from the internal conversion of photogenerated charges.40,41 The emission peak at 460 nm is attributed to the conjugated ring system (π → π* transitions), corresponding to the band–band recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.36 Obviously, all the ARCNS samples exhibit a decreased emission intensity of the PL peak in comparison to that of CNS, indicating that the introduction of aromatic rings on the edges of the g-C3N4 framework could greatly facilitate the separation of the excited charges in the conjugated system, further inhibiting their recombination. In addition, the PL emission peak of ARCNS shifts towards a longer wavelength with increasing amounts of aromatic ring in the framework, which is in good agreement with the DRS results. In the case of CNS, the LP → π* electronic transition at the nitrogen atoms are forbidden due to the perfectly symmetric and planar heptazine units of CNS. Incorporation of an aromatic ring causes the deviation from symmetry and layer buckling of the heptazine rings, which allows the LP → π* transition. The above results reveal that the aromatic rings can introduce an intermediate band into the forbidden bandgap of g-C3N4, which can provide more internal conversion sites to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated charges. However, ARCNS-4 shows a higher emission intensity of the PL peak than that of ARCNS-3, suggesting that the excess aromatic rings in the g-C3N4 framework will act as recombination sites for photogenerated charges and lead to lower dual-functional photocatalytic performance, which can be confirmed by the results of photocurrent and EIS measurements. As shown in Fig. 12B and C, all ARCNS samples show a larger photocurrent and a smaller EIS hemicycle radius than that of CNS. In addition, ARCNS-3 shows the highest photocurrent and smallest EIS hemicycle radius of all samples, indicating that incorporating aromatic rings in the g-C3N4 framework can enhance the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges, but excess aromatic rings in the g-C3N4 framework will act as recombination sites.

Moreover, the impact of aromatic rings in the electronic structure of g-C3N4 was investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The typical EPR spectra of CNS and ARCNS-3 are shown in Fig. S7.† The EPR signal intensity of g-C3N4 is amplified after aromatic ring incorporation, elucidating the effective extension of delocalized systems of g-C3N4 heterocycles after integrating aromatic rings into the g-C3N4 framework. Enhanced EPR signal intensity was observed when both CNS and ARCNS-3 were irradiated, indicating the efficient photochemical generation of radical pairs in the semiconductor. The increasing magnitude of the EPR signal intensity for ARCNS-3 is much higher than that of CNS, indicating that ARCNS can be excited more easily under visible light irradiation.
The reusability and photostability of the ARCNS samples were evaluated by a cycle run of the dual-functional photocatalytic reaction under identical conditions. As shown in Fig. 13A, it can be observed that the photocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous TC removal of ARCNS-3 has no apparent deactivation even after five successive cycles under visible-light irradiation, suggesting that ARCNS-3 has high dual-functional photocatalytic stability. This was further confirmed by the subsequent XRD, SEM and XPS measurements of ARCNS-3 before and after the photocatalytic reaction cycles. As revealed in Fig. 13B–E, no obvious discrepancy could be observed in the XRD and XPS patterns of ARCNS-3 before and after the photoreaction. Moreover, after 5 recycling photocatalytic reactions, ARCNS-3 retains nanosheet features (Fig. 13F). These results indicate the high crystal structure and chemical and morphological stability of the ARCNS samples under photocatalytic reactions.

4 Conclusions
In summary, aromatic ring-terminated g-C3N4 nanosheets were successfully synthesized by copolymerization of urea and DQ, as verified by FT-IR, NMR and XPS characterization, and a possible formation mechanism was proposed. A remarkably enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous wastewater purification (1021 μmol h−1 g−1 with 100% degradation of tetracycline) was achieved by ARCNS-3, which is much higher than that achieved by CNS (325 μmol h−1 g−1 with 48% degradation of tetracycline). In addition, the mineralization percentage of tetracycline for ARCNS-3 reached 92.1%, far superior to that of CNS (18%). Based on the results of the trapping experiment, BET, DRS, PL, photocurrent, Nyquist and EPR characterization, the significant enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution with simultaneous tetracycline removal was ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the incorporation of aromatic rings can suppress the back-reaction of photogenerated electrons and radical intermediates; (2) the incorporation of aromatic rings induces structural distortion of the g-C3N4 framework and leads to higher surface area, which can provide more reaction sites for the photocatalytic reaction; (3) the formation of an aromatic ring acceptor level in the ARCNS bandgap can effectively extend visible light absorbance up to 900 nm and suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, ARCNS-3 possesses satisfactory light and structure stability after 5 cycle runs (5 h per cycle). This work will provide a new insight and route to improve the photocatalytic performance of dual-functional photocatalytic systems.
