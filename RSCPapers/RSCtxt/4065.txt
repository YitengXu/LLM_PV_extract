    , Accepted 30th October 2020First published on 4th November 2020AbstractDesigning efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts based on single-atom catalysts is a highly promising option for cost-effective alkaline water electrolyzers. However, the instability of the OOH* intermediate and high energy barrier for the rate-determining step (RDS) (O* to OOH*) on the pure bimetallic-alloy represent serious challenges. Here, we report atomically dispersed Ru single-atoms on a cobalt–iron bimetallic-alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon (RuSACoFe2/G) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for the alkaline OER. In-depth X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) along with theoretical calculations were employed to validate the isolated Ru sites in the surface-oxygen rich alloy. RuSACoFe2/G displays exceptional intrinsic activity, achieving a record low overpotential of only 180 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with superior durability in alkali media. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations revealed that the isolated Ru sites with pre-adsorbed surface oxygen species on a bimetallic-alloy efficiently stabilize the OOH* intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier for the RDS, boosting the intrinsic OER activity. Our integrated alkaline electrolyzer demands a low cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm−2, suggesting that it has potential for use in practical applications.

Broader context
Water electrolysis driven by electricity/solar energy for scalable and sustainable hydrogen fuel production is considered a promising technology to combat the urgent energy and environmental threats. However, the sluggish 4 electron anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demanding a noble metal electrocatalyst limits its widespread applications. Recently, transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as a promising catalyst for the OER, but their intrinsic low conductivity and poor stability hamper their use in real systems. Although conducting alloy counterparts can be a suitable alternative, the instability of the OOH* intermediate and high energy barrier for the rate-determining step (RDS) (O* to OOH*) pose a major bottleneck. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to prepare surface oxygen-rich Ru single-atoms on a cobalt–iron bimetallic-alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon for achieving superior OER performance over noble metals and highly celebrated LDHs. Benefitting from the high intrinsic conductivity, an optimal content of pre-adsorbed surface oxygen on the bimetallic-alloy effectively stabilizes the OOH* intermediate and the Ru single-atoms significantly reduce the energy barrier for the RDS, synergistically accelerating the OER. This work unravels the role of pre-adsorbed surface oxygen towards boosting the OER and opens a new avenue for fabricating advanced electrocatalysts for other catalytic reactions.

1. Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting has been widely recognized as a promising approach for renewable electricity in the form of sustainable hydrogen fuel.1 Electrolysis of water includes two half-reactions: the 2 electron cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the 4 electron anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).2 Compared with the minimal energy losses in the HER, the more sluggish OER suffers from slow reaction kinetics involving multiple proton/electron-coupled steps and poor stability, making it the main bottleneck toward practical implementation of water electrolysis.3 Currently, Pt-based cathodes and RuO2/IrO2 anodes are used for the HER and OER, respectively. However, noble metal elements are expensive due to their scarcity, and there is an additional cost due to the complications of producing efficient materials and possible cross-contamination.4 Hence, the development of an OER electrocatalyst with both high activity and stability in alkaline media based on earth-abundant materials is of key interest and would be a significant innovation that promotes industrial applications. To this end, an atomic-level understanding of the nature of the active sites of catalysts is needed for the rational design of targeted OER catalysts.5
With their low-cost and moderate intrinsic activities, earth-abundant transition metal (e.g., Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, and Fe) based catalysts have been widely investigated for the OER, for example, transition metal oxides,6 hydroxides,7 sulfides,8 phosphides,9 nitrides,10 metal alloys,11 and carbon-based nanomaterials.12 Among them, CoFe/NiFe-based electrocatalysts (mainly their hydroxides and oxides)13,14 have been extensively investigated to further enhance the OER activity including designing the morphologies,15 optimizing the composition, and creating defects with carbon supports.16 Recently, CoFe2O4/biochar and CoFe2O4 NP-on-carbon fiber paper nanocomposites showed excellent OER efficacy attributed to the strong coupling between the nanoparticles and substrate with a high surface area.17,18 Spinel type Fe–Co3O4 and a Cr doped CoFe-layered double hydroxide (Cr-CoFe-LDH) with an optimum amount of dopants resulted in enhanced OER activity correlated to the modulated electronic parameters.19,20 A semicrystalline 2D Co–Fe–O mixed metal-oxide derived from the CoFe-LDH with attenuated electronic properties exhibited superior OER performance and outperformed the LDH counterpart.21 Nevertheless, the insufficient stabilization of the OER intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH) and poor intrinsic conductivity often hamper the overall performance and demand a high overpotential.22 Although the corresponding alloys with high intrinsic conductivity can be a suitable alternative, they have remained unnoticed.23 Bimetallic alloys have shown great advantages in accelerating the catalytic performance for reduction reactions due to their superior conductivity and metal–metal synergistic effects compared with the monometallic counterparts.24 However, due to the poor adsorption ability of the OER intermediates, the reported OER performance for the state-of-the-art designed bimetallic alloys in alkaline conditions is far inferior to that achieved for the reduction reactions and still needs further improvement.
Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted attention due to their numerous advantages, such as improved catalytic site homogeneity, a diverse range of supports, ultimate atom economy, and minimal usage of noble metals.25 Nevertheless, fabricating SACs always faces the challenge of segregating single atoms on the support due to the weak interactions between metal atoms and the supporting material, which results in agglomeration and poor overall catalytic performance.26 Besides the fabrication issue, the intrinsic activity of single atoms is another aspect of determining the catalytic performance. To maximize the catalytic activity, anchoring single atoms at stable sites on a suitable support is essential for the rational design of SAC-based state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Efforts to achieve high coverage of single atoms anchored on well-defined locations and superior catalytic performance are still insufficient, and these areas need to be further explored.27
In this work, we demonstrated a simple approach to tailor the water oxidation active sites on a surface oxygen abundant CoFe2 alloy encapsulated in graphitic carbon (CoFe2/G) by homogeneously anchored Ru single atoms. The isolated Ru atoms on CoFe2/G bimetallic alloys were uniformly produced by the micelle incorporated sol–gel method. Systematic characterization, including XAS, AC-TEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirmed that the Ru single sites were uniformly isolated at the surface-oxygen rich CoFe2 alloy. Remarkably, the resulting RuSACoFe2/G delivered excellent OER activity with an overpotential as low as 180 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a reasonable Tafel slope of 51 mV decade−1 in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. These results surpassed reported literature and state-of-the-art Ru based electrocatalysts. DFT calculation results revealed that the pre-adsorbed oxygen on RuSACoFe2(110) efficiently stabilized the OOH* intermediates and the isolated Ru sites further dramatically reduced the kinetic energy barrier of the rate-determining step (O* to OOH*), thereby accelerating the OER process in an alkaline medium. Moreover, upon integrating the electrocatalyst with reported Ni4Mo materials as a cathode, an alkaline electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was steadily driven at a very low cell voltage of 1.48 V, which was much lower than the value for a Pt/C–RuO2 couple (1.65 V at 10 mA cm−2).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Fabrication and characterization
The surface oxygen abundant CoFe2/G with homogeneously anchored Ru single atoms (RuSACoFe2/G) was prepared via a two-step micelle incorporated sol–gel method28 and carbothermal reduction29 (Scheme 1, details in the Experimental section). First, stoichiometric aqueous mixtures of cobalt and iron metal ions as precursors (molar ratios of Fe/Co = 0.5, 1, and 2) with fixed total metal concentrations were encapsulated in amphiphilic block copolymers due to electrostatic attraction with the pH-controlled to 9–10. Then, various amounts of Ru precursor were inserted into the Co–Fe monomicelle composites, followed by self-assembly at room temperature. A homogenous metal–gel film was produced by the vaporization of uncoordinated water and the elimination of the solvent in the form of gas molecules. The film was calcinated in an Ar atmosphere at 750 °C to produce a fluffy porous black power as observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Fig. S1, ESI†). Thermal decomposition of the copolymer blocks resulted in metallic compounds encapsulated inside graphitic carbon by carbothermal reduction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the existence of Ru, Co, Fe, and O with metal ratios identical to those of the precursors (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†). Meanwhile, Co–Fe alloys made from precursors of various ratios were also synthesized as control samples (RuSACoFe/G, RuSACo2Fe/G, RuNPCoFe2/G, CoFe2/G, RuNPCo2Fe/G, and Co2Fe/G). As depicted in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1a), the diffraction peaks at 44.9° and 65° and a broad peak at 20–30° were indexed to the (110) and (200) facets of a cubic bcc Co–Fe metal alloy (JCPDS: 49-1567) and the (002) facet of graphitic carbon, respectively. The as-prepared RuSACoFe2/G with 2.01 wt% Ru showed no obvious Ru particle or cluster diffraction peaks, whereas additional diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Ru (JCPDS: 65-1863) appeared upon increasing the Ru content to 4.37 wt%, which was referred to as RuNPCoFe2/G (Table S2, ESI†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed the morphology of RuSACoFe2/G, which revealed that amphiphilic copolymers were carbonized to form a conductive graphitic carbon network encapsulating CoFe2 alloys that may facilitate electron transfer during the electrochemical reaction (Fig. 1b and c and Fig. S3a and b, ESI†). The lattice distance of 0.187 nm and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d) correspond to the (110) plane of RuSACoFe2/G. The atomic dispersion of Ru species was confirmed by high-angle-annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF-STEM) with a sub-Å resolution (Fig. 1e–g and Fig. S3c, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1f, the bright spots (sites 1 and 2, and red circles) indicating single Ru atoms (the sizes of the bright spots were ∼2 Å) were homogeneously distributed across the entire CoFe2 metal alloy along the X–Y direction in the intensity profiles (Fig. 1g). The isolated Ru atomic dispersion was further verified with the line-scan elemental profile shown in Fig. S3d (ESI†). Importantly, high magnification STEM-EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 1h) showed the uniform distribution of Co, Fe, C, and O, and uncorrelated spatial distribution of Ru throughout the entire sample. Note that the Co–Fe monomicelle incorporated sol–gel method via electrostatic interaction was an ideal approach to achieve isolated atomic dispersion of Ru ions. The graphitic carbon substrate derived from the carbothermal treatment of the copolymers was highly porous with partially covered defective layers exposing the active metal surface, which can facilitate mass diffusion of reactants and products during the catalysis process to and from the active sites (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Similar elemental distributions of encapsulated CoFe alloy nanoparticles can also be seen in control samples CoFe2/G and Co2Fe/G (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). As the Ru content increased to 4.39 wt%, the presence of separated Ru NPs with a lattice distance of 0.21 nm was observed in RuNPCo2Fe/G, corresponding to the (101) plane of metallic Ru (Fig. S8, ESI†).

The chemical compositions and valence states of the elements on the surface of the electrocatalysts were analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table S3 (ESI†). The presence of Co, Fe, and O on the surface of CoFe2/G (Fig. 2a–c) was detected using high-resolution core-level XPS spectra both before and after Ar etching.30 The Co 2p spectrum in Fig. 2a revealed the presence of metallic Co at binding energies of 776.6 and 791.5 eV along with two sets of doublets of the surface oxidized Co2+ species centered at 778.8 and 793.6 eV and 786.7 and 795.6 eV. These peaks were attributed to the bonding between Co and pre-adsorbed surface oxygen. However, after argon ion sputtering, metallic Co0 is dominant, suggesting the presence of a highly conducting metallic Co core. Similarly, in the Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 2b) the presence of metallic Fe at binding energies of 705.1 and 718.2 eV along with two sets of doublets of surface oxidized Fe2+ species centered at 708.6 and 722.2 eV and 710.7 and 724.7 eV indicated the bonding between Fe and O at the surface. The majority of Fe atoms were in the metallic state after argon etching, indicating that both Fe and Co were successfully reduced to form a CoFe metal alloy during carbothermal reduction, which was consistent with the XRD pattern. The high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s (Fig. 2c) clearly showed the presence of two types of pre-adsorbed surface oxygen (oxygen bonded to the metal surface: M–Olattice and oxygen from the graphitic carbon substrate: G–Osubstrate) out of the total pre-adsorbed surface oxygen (OTotal: Olattice + OG-substrate) based on the comparison of the XPS spectra of CoFe2/G with graphitic carbon O 1s (Fig. S4c, ESI†). As shown in Table S4 (ESI†), CoFe2/G exhibited 3.44 at% Olattice out of 21.27 at% OTotal. After Ar sputtering to etch the covered graphitic carbon over the active metals, the peak area of G–Osubstrate around 531 to 532 eV was dramatically reduced with a relative increase of the peak area assigned to M–Olattice (7.11 at%) around 529 eV. Meanwhile, the introduction of isolated Ru atoms into the CoFe2 alloy would affect the electronic structure. The presence of C, Ru, Co, Fe, and O on RuSACoFe2/G was also detected before and after Ar etching (Fig. 2d–h). The C 1s and Ru 3d spectra in Fig. 2d revealed the existence of a graphitic carbon layer and isolated Ru atoms in RuSACoFe2/G. Ar-Sputtering Ru 3d XPS spectra31 of RuSACoFe2/G showed the binding energies of Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 at 280.2 eV and 284.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 2d), which were higher than those of Ru0 (279.8 eV) while lower than Ru4+ (280.7 eV). A similar trend was also observed in the Ru 3p XPS spectra (Fig. 2e). The Ru 3p spectra revealed three sets of triplets centered at 457.98 and 478.28 eV, 460.48 and 481.38 eV, and 463.08 and 484.08 eV, confirming that the oxidation state of isolated Ru was positioned between 0 and +4.15 In the Co and Fe 2p region, the majority of Co and Fe was in the metallic state, confirming the formation of a CoFe alloy along with surface oxidized Co and Fe species originating from the bonding between the metal and pre-adsorbed surface oxygen (Fig. 2f and g). Similar to CoFe2/G, the O 1s spectra (Fig. 2h) of RuSACoFe2/G also exhibited peaks corresponding to M–Olattice and G–Osubstrate with 1.86 at% Olattice out of 16.65 at% OTotal, whereas Olattice increased to 6.62 at% with a relative decrease of G–Osubstrate upon Ar etching (Table S4, ESI†). The Co 2p, Fe 2p, and Ru 3p XPS spectra of Co2Fe/G and RuNPCo2Fe/G also revealed the successful synthesis of the Co2Fe alloy and Ru nanoparticle anchored Co2Fe alloy (Fig. S9, ESI†). The Ru 3p XPS spectra in Fig. S10 (ESI†) showed that the oxidation state of Ru in RuSA exhibited a positive shift compared to Ru in RuNP, corroborating the successful anchoring of isolated Ru atoms in the CoFe alloy without any Ru–Ru bond formation.

Further investigation of the electronic and local structure of RuSACoFe2/G was carried out with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The Ru, Co, and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structures (XANES) in Fig. 3a–c were investigated along with key reference materials.15 The Ru K-edge XANES spectra of RuSACoFe2/G showed a lower leading edge at 22121 eV compared to that of RuO2 (22124 eV), while higher than that of Ru foil (22115 eV), confirming the oxidation state of isolated Ru to be +2.5 (Fig. S11a, ESI†),32 which was consistent with the XPS results. Bader charge analysis indicated that the isolated Ru atoms at the surface showed a partially positive oxidation state after losing 0.73e− to the pre-adsorbed surface Olattice, corroborating the XANES results (Fig. S11b, ESI†). The XANES spectra taken at the Co K-edge and Fe K-edge for both CoFe2/G and RuSACoFe2/G were identical to the metal foil, suggesting a pure metallic state of the CoFe alloy. Ru, Co, and Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were further conducted to verify the local environment at the atomic level (Fig. 3d–g). As shown in Fig. 3d, the Ru K-edge Fourier transform (FT) EXAFS curve of RuSACoFe2/G showed a conspicuous peak at 2.17 Å, which was assigned to the nearest shell coordination of Ru–Co/Fe bonds without the appearance of Ru–Ru peaks at ∼2.4 and 3.1 Å as in the FT-EXAFS curves of Ru foil and RuO2, respectively. This precluded the aggregation of Ru-related oxides and nanoparticles, indicating the single-atom nature of Ru in RuSACoFe2/G. These data agreed with the above characterization results (Fig. 1). The Co and Fe K-edge FT-EXAFS signals (Fig. 3e and f) showed similar scattering features to the Co/Fe foil with a dominant peak at ∼2.2 Å, affirming that the majority of Co and Fe in the samples was in the form of metal alloys. Furthermore, a non-negligible peak was also observed at ∼1.6 Å, corroborating the Ru/Co/Fe–Olattice scattering contribution (Fig. 3d–f). To confirm the adjacent properties of the metal atoms, we also conducted wavelet transform WT-EXAFS. As revealed in Fig. 3g, the WT signal (related to Ru–Ru bonds in the Ru foil) was not detected in RuSACoFe2/G, confirming the absence of Ru related clusters/nanoparticles. Compared to Ru foil, RuSACoFe2/G showed an intensity maximum at 9.1 Å−1, which was associated with the Ru–Co/Fe path. A faint WT signal of Ru–O at 5.2 Å−1 also appeared, consistent with the Ru K-edge FT-EXAFS results. Furthermore, model-based Ru K-edge EXAFS fitting (Table S5, ESI†) confirmed that the Ru atoms were coordinated with 6.5, 6.4, and 0.2 Co, Fe, and Olattice atoms, respectively, suggesting that the Ru atoms were atomically isolated in the CoFe2 alloy with pre-adsorbed surface oxygen species (Fig. 3h). As predicted from the extensive state-of-the-art characterizations, the unique electronic and atomic properties of the surface oxygen-rich RuSACoFe2/G may significantly regulate its electrocatalytic behavior.

2.2 Electrochemical oxygen evolution performance (OER)
The electrocatalytic OER performance of RuSACoFe2/G was assessed in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in a typical three-electrode configuration. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated in hydrogen saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte and converted to RHE (Fig. S12, ESI†).33 For comparison, the OER performance of CoFe2/G, commercial RuO2, and 5% Ru/C with the same mass loading was also evaluated under similar conditions. As depicted in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curve in Fig. 4a and b, RuSACoFe2/G obtained a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a record-low overpotential of only 180 mV, outperforming the state-of-the-art RuO2 (η10 = 298 mV), 5% Ru/C (η10 = 344 mV) and CoFe2/G (η10 = 313 mV). To the best of our knowledge, RuSACoFe2/G displayed the best OER performance with an ultra-low overpotential among the reported OER catalysts; it was even superior to the highly celebrated LDHs (Fig. 4c).14,29,34–45 The best performance was obtained with 2.01 wt% Ru loading into the surface oxygen-rich CoFe alloy with a Co to Fe ratio of 1:2 (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). To gain further insight into the OER kinetics, the Tafel slope was derived from the LSV polarization curve (Fig. 4d).46 RuSACoFe2/G exhibited the smallest Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1 and outperformed CoFe2/G (86 mV dec−1), implying that the most favorable OER kinetics were achieved due to the incorporation of single Ru atoms. The isolated Ru atoms were also incorporated into the NiFe2/G, NiCo2/G, and MgAl2/G alloys following the same synthesis method and showed improved OER performance compared to their individual alloys. However, their performances were inferior to that of RuSACoFe2/G (Fig. S15, ESI†). Surprisingly, the performance of RuSACoFe2/G outperformed the highly celebrated RuSACoFe2-LDH due to the active Ru single atoms with metallic cores, which facilitated faster electron transfer during the OER as evinced from the smaller charge transfer resistance (RCT) for the former (Fig. S16 and S17a and b, ESI†). Moreover, the valence band maximum value (VBM) for RuSACoFe2/G was much closer to the Fermi level (EF, set to 0 eV) compared to the RuSACoFe2-LDH (1.02 eV), signifying that RuSACoFe2/G exhibited high metallic character with a higher density of states around EF, necessary for sublime electron transfer during the OER process (Fig. S17c, ESI†). In addition, the higher electrical conductivity of RuSACoFe2/G compared to that of the RuSACoFe2-LDH revealed from the I–V measurement resulted in the low RCT and ultra-low overpotential (Fig. S17d, ESI†). The superior performance of RuSACoFe2/G was also evidenced by the mass activity observed by normalizing the catalytic current by the Ru loading (Fig. S18, ESI†). Furthermore, we investigated the OER performance of RuSACoFe2/G-2h synthesized with a lower calcination time, which contained a higher content of surface Olattice (3.9 at%) compared to RuSACoFe2/G (1.86 at%) (Fig. S19a and b, and Table S6, ESI†). The OER performance of RuSACoFe2/G was much superior to RuSACoFe2/G-2h, suggesting that a higher content of surface Olattice was detrimental to the OER performance (Fig. S19c, ESI†). To find out the optimal content of Olattice and the relationship with the OER performance, we synthesized RuSACoFe2/G-H2 with a lower content of Olattice (0.45 at%) by following a similar synthesis procedure to that for RuSACoFe2/G, however, calcining under 30% H2/Ar, and compared the OER performance with RuSACoFe2/G and RuSACoFe2/G-2h (Fig. S20a–c, Tables S7 and S8, and Fig. S21a and b, ESI†). RuSACoFe2/G with an optimal content of 1.86 at% Olattice exhibited the best OER performance, whereas lower content than the optimal amount was also detrimental. Interestingly, RuSACoFe2/G-H2 with the lowest content of lattice oxygen exhibited still higher performance than the RuSACoFe2-LDH (Fig. S21c, ESI†). The Nyquist plot in Fig. S22a (ESI†) revealed that RuSACoFe2/G possessed the smallest RCT, implying fast electron transfer kinetics solely due to its metallic nature with graphitic carbon as the electron transport layer. Additionally, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of RuSACoFe2/G (0.721 mF and 18.02 cm2), was two times higher compared to CoFe2/G (0.398 mF and 9.95 cm2), implying that it had the highest number of active sites, which agreed with its superior OER performance (Fig. S23, ESI†). In addition, RuSACoFe2/G showed superior OER performance over RuSACoFe2 (without the G substrate), benefiting from the improved electron transfer kinetics via the graphitic carbon transport layer and uniform distribution of active catalyst in the graphitic carbon substrate yielding a higher ECSA (Fig. S20, Table S8, and Fig. S24, ESI†). To estimate the optimum content of graphitic carbon and the correlation with the OER activity, we synthesized RuSACoFe2/HG (with high graphitic carbon) and RuSACoFe2/LG (with low graphitic carbon) and compared their OER performance with RuSACoFe2/G and RuSACoFe2 (Table S9 and Fig. S25, ESI†). RuSACoFe2/G with an optimum content of 73.86 at% G exhibited the best OER performance, whereas higher or lower G content hampered the OER performance.

The left inset in (e) is the faradaic efficiency and the amount of oxygen gas obtained by RuSACoFe2/G at 200 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, and the right inset in (e) is the LSV curve before and after the stability test. 
Apart from the superior OER activity, the long-term durability issues of single-atom catalysts are a major limiting factor for large-scale applications. A chronopotentiometry durability test at a fixed current density of 50 mA cm−2 conducted for at least 25 h with overlapping LSV curves after the durability test confirmed the exceptional stability of RuSACoFe2/G towards the OER, whereas the commercial RuO2 and 5% Ru/C showed relatively poor stability (Fig. 4e).14 The ICP-OES analysis of the electrolyte before and after the OER stability test confirmed that there was no dissolution of Ru, Co, and Fe into the electrolyte, verifying the superior stability of RuSACoFe2/G (Table S10, ESI†). Post stability characterizations of RuSACoFe2/G confirmed that the crystal structure, morphology, composition, and chemical states of Ru, Co, and Fe remained unaltered under harsh electrochemical conditions (Fig. S26, ESI†). RuSACoFe2/G also demonstrated excellent energy conversion efficiency measured by collecting the actual amount of oxygen gas generated at a constant current density of 200 mA cm−2 by the eudiometric method.47,48 The faradaic efficiency of RuSACoFe2/G was 97.4%, suggesting that almost all the charge was consumed for oxygen generation rather than any noticeable parasitic reaction (Fig. 4 inset). The OER performance of RuSACoFe2/G was highly reproducible as well as consistent (Fig. S27, ESI†).
2.3 Theoretical investigation
To understand the origin of the superior intrinsic OER performance of RuSACoFe2/G under alkaline media and the relationship between its electronic structure and the excellent activity, we employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) software. First, CoFe(110), the most stable facet, with a Co:Fe ratio of 1:2 was used as the starting point to build the model. The RuSACoFe2(110) model was constructed by replacing a surface Fe atom with a Ru single atom. The graphitic carbon layer was not considered in the calculation to reduce the complexity of the model since it was just used as a support for RuSACoFe2 and did not possess any active sites. Further details regarding the model construction can be found in the Computational method section. Fig. 5a shows the side view of the optimized unit cell of the CoFe2(110) and RuSACoFe2(110) facet. It is well-known that the OER activity has been demonstrated by the stability of the adsorbed reaction intermediates (such as OH*, O*, and OOH*) on the active catalyst surface, whereas the potential RDS for the OER is the formation of OOH* from O* groups, demonstrating the stabilization of the OOH* intermediate as an important step in the superior intrinsic OER performance. In this regard, we investigated the stability of adsorbed OOH* on the clean CoFe2(110) facet. Fig. 5b shows the top and side view of the CoFe2(110) facet with adsorbed OOH* placed on the hollow site before and after optimization. Due to the excessive number of high surface energy active atoms on the pure metallic CoFe alloy, the OOH* intermediate split into adsorbed H* and OH*, making OOH* unstable on the clean (110) facet of the CoFe2 alloy, implying that the clean (110) facet of CoFe2 had poor intrinsic OER activity. From our experimental characterization techniques (TEM, XPS, XANES, and EXAFS), we found that the CoFe2 alloy consisted of pre-adsorbed surface Olattice on the metal surface generating a partially oxidized surface, rather than the pure metallic surface. So, to match our experiment, we introduced different amounts of pre-adsorbed O species on the surface of the (110) facet of the CoFe2 alloy (1 pre-adsorbed O, 6 pre-adsorbed O, 7 pre-adsorbed O, 8 pre-adsorbed O, and 9 pre-adsorbed O) and investigated the stability of the adsorbed OOH* on these surfaces (Fig. 5c and Fig. S28, ESI†). Similar to the clean CoFe2(110) surface, CoFe2 with 1 pre-adsorbed O (CoFe2(O-1)(110)) and 6 pre-adsorbed O (CoFe2(O-6)(110)) also disintegrated the OOH* intermediate, making the OER process highly sluggish. Interestingly, we found that the (110) facet of CoFe2 with 8 pre-adsorbed O (CoFe2(O-8)(110)) can efficiently stabilize the adsorbed OOH* intermediate with the highest adsorption energy (Eads) of −0.90 eV compared to the relatively weak Eads of −0.87 eV for CoFe2 with 7 pre-adsorbed O (CoFe2(O-7)(110)) (Table S11, ESI†). Whereas with 9 pre-adsorbed O (CoFe2(O-9)(110)), due to a significantly weak Eads of −0.37 eV, the OOH* intermediate desorbed after optimization, suggesting the efficacious role of the optimal content of the adsorbed surface Olattice species on the metal alloy in stabilizing the OOH* intermediate. Previous studies ignored the presence of surface Olattice in their systems. Being more realistic, we showed that the optimal content of surface Olattice could play an important role in intermediate stabilization. Like CoFe2(O-8)(110), the adsorbed OOH* intermediate was also stable on the surface of RuSACoFe2(O-8)(110) (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, the Bader charge and charge transfer difference analysis revealed that there was charge redistribution after incorporating RuSA on CoFe2(O-8)(110) with RuSA transferring its charge to the coordinated surface Olattice, generating an electron-deficient center, thus facilitating intermediate adsorption and accelerating the OER (Table S12 and Fig. S29a and b, ESI†). Similar to the VB-XPS for RuSACoFe2/G and RuSACoFe2 in Fig. S17c, the density of states (DOS) calculations for RuSACoFe2(O-8)(110) and CoFe2(O-8)(110) also revealed high metallic character with a higher density of electron states near EF compared to CoFe2(110), illustrating high electrical conductivity necessary for faster electron transfer during the OER process (Fig. S29c, ESI†). Finally, to compare the catalytic activity with and without isolated Ru atoms in the surface Olattice-rich CoFe2(O-8)(110), we calculated the free-energy profile of the OER on the CoFe2(O-8)(110) and RuSACoFe2(O-8)(110) surfaces (Fig. 5e). The free-energy plot showed that the isolated Ru atom site on CoFe2(O-8)(110) had a lower Gibbs free energy (2.53 eV) for the RDS (O* to OOH*) than that of CoFe2(O-8)(110) (3.25 eV), suggesting more favorable OER kinetics in the RuSACoFe2(O-8) structure with isolated Ru atoms as efficient active sites for catalyzing the OER. Therefore, our theoretical calculation revealed that the excellent OER activity of the surface oxygen-rich RuSACoFe2/G originated from the effective stabilization of the OOH* intermediate and lowered the Gibbs free energy for the RDS.

2.4 Electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance (HER)
To investigate the bifunctionality of the synthesized materials, we checked their HER performances under similar conditions. As expected, the benchmark Pt/C showed the highest activity with a very low overpotential of only 37 mV at −10 mA cm−2. RuNPCo2Fe/G (4.39 wt% Ru loading) showed the best activity among the samples for the HER in terms of low overpotential (129 mV) at −10 mA cm−2 as well as a lower Tafel slope (116 mV dec−1), outperforming Co2Fe/G and RuSACoFe2/G (Fig. S30, ESI†). The highest performance was obtained with 4.39 wt% Ru loading in the CoFe alloy with a Co to Fe ratio of 2:1 (Fig. S31, ESI†). Interestingly, the Ru nanoclusters on the Co2Fe alloy showed better performance than the Ru single atoms on the Co2Fe alloy (RuSACo2Fe/G) towards the HER, which was consistent with previous literature.49 The rapid charge transfer kinetics due to the lowest RCT along with a higher ECSA confirmed the superior performance of RuNPCo2Fe/G over Co2Fe/G (Fig. S22b and S32, ESI†). The chronopotentiometry test at a fixed current density of −50 mA cm−2 for at least 24 h confirmed the exceptional stability of RuNPCo2Fe/G, whereas the commercial Pt/C showed relatively poor stability (Fig. S33, ESI†). The morphology, crystal phase, and the composition of RuNPCo2Fe/G were retained after the stability test (Fig. S34, ESI†).
2.5 Electrochemical overall water splitting
Fascinated with the exceptional OER performance of RuSACoFe2/G, we integrated two-electrode alkaline electrolyzers with RuSACoFe2/G as an anode and the well-known high-performance Ni4Mo as the cathode (Fig. 6a). Fig. S35 and S36 (ESI†) showed the successful synthesis and the superior HER performance of the Ni4Mo cathode in alkaline media. As depicted in Fig. 6b and c and Fig. S37a and b (ESI†), the Ni4Mo(−)‖RuSACoFe2/G(+) alkaline electrolyzer showed a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.48 V, and it outperformed the state-of-the-art Pt/C(−)‖RuO2(+) (η10 = 1.65 V) and Ni4Mo(−)‖RuO2(+) (η10 = 1.57 V) electrolyzers. The achieved cell voltage was even better than most of the recently reported alkaline electrolyzers (Fig. 6d).37,40,42,50–60 The chronopotentiometry durability test was conducted at a fixed current density of 100 mA cm−2 for at least 100 h. This test confirmed the exceptional stability of the Ni4Mo(−)‖RuSACoFe2/G(+) electrolyzer, whereas the state-of-the-art Pt/C(−)‖RuO2(+) electrolyzer showed relatively poor stability at the same current density (Fig. 6e and S37c, ESI†). The matching LSV polarization curve after the stability test confirmed the retention of the active sites (Fig. 6e inset). The Ni4Mo(−)‖RuSACoFe2/G(+) electrolyzer further proved unprecedented long-term stability for 100 h at a high current density of 200 mA cm−2 (Fig. S38, ESI†). Therefore, the above results suggested that RuSACoFe2/G can be a suitable anode for alkaline electrolyzers for large-scale water splitting.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed isolated Ru atoms anchored on a bimetallic-alloy with an adjustable ratio of Co/Fe via a simple two-step micelle incorporated sol–gel method and carbothermal reduction. The unusually high electrocatalytic OER performance with an ultra-low overpotential of RuSACoFe2/G was ascribed to the intrinsic high activity of single Ru atoms on a conductive CoFe2 metal alloy with pre-adsorbed surface Olattice stabilizing the OOH* intermediate. The outstanding OER activity of the RuSACoFe2/G catalyst was achieved with a quite low overpotential of 180 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for continuous operation of over 25 h in alkaline conditions, which to our knowledge is close to the best reported OER electrocatalyst. The combination of XAFS and Ar-sputtering XPS allowed us to identify the isolated Ru atoms and the surface adsorbed Olattice species on the alloy surface. More importantly, DFT calculations revealed that the pre-adsorbed oxygen on RuSACoFe2(110) efficiently stabilized the OOH* intermediates and the incorporation of isolated Ru sites into the CoFe alloy dramatically decreased the kinetic energy barrier of the rate-determining step (O* to OOH*), thereby accelerating the OER process. To demonstrate the potential to meet the industrial standard of alkaline water electrolysis, we constructed a Ni4Mo(−)//RuSACoFe2/G(+) alkaline electrolyzer, which demanded a very low cell voltage of 1.48 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was much lower than the value for the Pt/C(−)//RuO2(+) couple. We successfully synthesized bimetallic-alloys with homogeneously anchored Ru single atoms and shed light on the role of surface oxygen in the OER process.

Broader context
Water electrolysis driven by electricity/solar energy for scalable and sustainable hydrogen fuel production is considered a promising technology to combat the urgent energy and environmental threats. However, the sluggish 4 electron anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demanding a noble metal electrocatalyst limits its widespread applications. Recently, transition metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as a promising catalyst for the OER, but their intrinsic low conductivity and poor stability hamper their use in real systems. Although conducting alloy counterparts can be a suitable alternative, the instability of the OOH* intermediate and high energy barrier for the rate-determining step (RDS) (O* to OOH*) pose a major bottleneck. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to prepare surface oxygen-rich Ru single-atoms on a cobalt–iron bimetallic-alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon for achieving superior OER performance over noble metals and highly celebrated LDHs. Benefitting from the high intrinsic conductivity, an optimal content of pre-adsorbed surface oxygen on the bimetallic-alloy effectively stabilizes the OOH* intermediate and the Ru single-atoms significantly reduce the energy barrier for the RDS, synergistically accelerating the OER. This work unravels the role of pre-adsorbed surface oxygen towards boosting the OER and opens a new avenue for fabricating advanced electrocatalysts for other catalytic reactions.
