    , Accepted 21st March 2021First published on 23rd March 2021AbstractBy acting as the trapping centers during charge carrier transfer, oxygen vacancy (VO) plays a critical role in oxide photoelectric devices. Herein, a post-annealing method was introduced to perfect the photodetection performances of ε-Ga2O3 photodetectors (PDs) by improving the film quality and modulating the VO defect concentration. The native oxygen-deficient ε-Ga2O3 epitaxial films fabricated via metal–organic chemical vapor deposition become highly dense and VO-less after oxidation annealing, leading to an enhanced performance, while they become VO-rich after reduction annealing to depress the PD property. Compared with the pristine PD, the crucial parameters of the devices with a lower VO concentration have been improved by 1–6 magnitude with a high photo-to-dark current ratio of 1.06 × 108, a large responsivity of 1.368 A W−1, an excellent detectivity of 9.13 × 1014 Jones, a superior linear dynamic range of 176.7 dB and an outstanding external quantum efficiency of 666.5% and a record-high rejection ratio (R240/R400) of 1.80 × 107. As the VO defect is commonly ubiquitous in oxide materials, our investigation of regulating the VO concentrations in ε-Ga2O3 and then exerting influences on the PD capabilities will provide principles for designing high-performance photoelectric devices.
Introduction
Since the first report in 1950s, gallium oxide (Ga2O3) has attracted continuous attention owing its particular inherent physical properties of ultrawide bandgap (Eg) and large breakdown field.1,2 The polymorphs of Ga2O3, known as α, β, γ, ε and δ, enable this unique semiconductor material as a viable candidate for numerous applications in power electronics, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, solar cells and gas sensors.2–4 Among these numerous phases, the monoclinic β-Ga2O3 gets extensive attraction for its best chemical and structural stability and the easy access to the high-quality bulk crystals and epitaxial films, which open the door for technological development and practical applications for Ga2O3 as a matter of course.5–7 However, such preferred β-phase suffers from problems of thermal, vibrational, electrical and optical anisotropies, resulting from the nonsymmetric crystalline structure, not to mention the severe device manufacturing problems induced by the material cleavage.8–13 Fortunately, the polymorphism of Ga2O3 brings the complementarity for each other.
As the metastable phase, ε-Ga2O3 possesses higher symmetry and lower anisotropic crystalline structure with the symmetric hexagonal system belonging to space group of P63mc which reveal a magical attraction for photoelectric and power devices.14–16 The pure ε-phase epitaxial Ga2O3 films have been realized on the GaN, AlN, Ga2O3, SiC and Al2O3 substrates, which lay a solid foundation for device applications.16–18 Its crystal structure could remain stable even after being processed in the high temperature up to 650 °C, allowing the work possibility of ε-Ga2O3 in an extreme environment.18,19 The polar non-centrosymmetric attribute energizes a ferroelectric behavior of ε-Ga2O3 with a large spontaneous polarization, making the use of the high concentration of two-dimensional electron gas possible in ε-Ga2O3 heterojunctions.15,20–22 Importantly, the intrinsically wide Eg makes ε-Ga2O3 as promising as β-Ga2O3 for deep-ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs). Recently, the UV response of the ε-Ga2O3 epilayer fabricated by the metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method has been demonstrated by Pavesi et al.23 ε-Ga2O3 solar-blind PDs with asymmetric and symmetric Schottky constructions were reported by Qin et al. and Liu et al., respectively.24–26 Impressively, a record-high ultraviolet/visible rejection ratio (Ruv/Rvisible) of 1.2 × 105 was attested in MSM-structured ε-Ga2O3 PD.27 However, an effective strategy to modulate the ε-Ga2O3 film quality and PD performance has not been systematically reported.
Herein, a sample post-annealing method with special atmospheres was introduced to modulate the oxygen vacancy (VO) in ε-Ga2O3 films via the formation or desorption process of the lattice oxygen atoms. The regulating effect and physical mechanism between VO concentrations and PD performances were systematically investigated. The ε-Ga2O3 epilayers would become highly dense and VO-less after oxidation annealing, which led to an enhanced photodetection property. On the contrary, the reduction annealing would lead to a higher VO concentration in ε-Ga2O3 and depress the PD photoconductivity. Considering that VO is the commonly ubiquitous in oxide materials, our investigation of regulating the VO concentrations in ε-Ga2O3 films and then exerting influences on the PD capabilities will provide principles for designing high-performance photoelectric devices.
Experimental
The ε-Ga2O3 films were deposited on sapphire substrates by the MOCVD system at 470 °C using triethylgallium (TEGa, 99.999%) and O2 (99.999%) as the precursors.25 Argon (99.999%) was flown together with TEGa as the carrier gas. The deposition pressure was adjusted as 25 torr, and the growth rate was controlled in 500 nm h−1. The fabricated ε-Ga2O3 films were then annealed in a tube furnace employing air, O2 and Ar flows as different oxygen concentrations. The post-annealing temperature and time were set as 700 °C and 60 min at the heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The gas flow rate across the tube was fixed as 40 ml min−1. To construct the metal-semiconductor–metal (MSM) PD, Ti-30 nm/Au-70 nm films serving as square electrodes (2 × 2 mm) were grown by the radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method. The distance between two adjacent electrodes was 200 μm and therefore made an effective irradiation area of 0.4 mm2. The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at the scanning speed of 6° min−1. The absorption features and Eg values were concluded in the wavelength range of 200–700 nm on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600). The surface and cross-profile morphologies of the ε-Ga2O3 films were measured via an FEI field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8020). The chemical compositions of the ε-Ga2O3 films were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi) with Al Kα (1486.7 eV) as the excitation source at the scanning speed of 0.1 eV per step. The photodetection performances of ε-Ga2O3 MSM PDs were recorded on a Keithley 4200-SCS analyzer using a low-pressure lamp and xenon-arc lamp as the light excitation sources.28,29
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the as-grown Ga2O3 films with and without the post-annealing treatment are presented in Fig. 1(a). The pristine Ga2O3 films grown by MOCVD under 470 °C consisted of pure ε-phase with preferred (001)-orientations as the 2θ peak positions of 19.29°, 39.02° and 60.05°, corresponding to the (002), (004) and (006) reflection of the hexagonal crystal structure. The relevant XRD θ–2θ scanning patterns have been reported in our previous studies to emphasize the pure ε-phase of the fabricated Ga2O3 films.25,26 After they were annealed at the high temperature of 700 °C, the Ga2O3 films maintained the same pure ε-phase with unchanged peak positions, but demonstrated high crystal quality for the higher peak intensities. It is worth noting that the (01) oriented β-phase Ga2O3 films give rise to a similar peak sequence at slightly different 2θ values.16,19 For reference and revealing the difference, the XRD pattern of a β-phase Ga2O3 sample grown on sapphire by MOCVD is also displayed in Fig. 1(a). Compared to the pristine sample, three treated ε-Ga2O3 films present a similar enhanced UV spectrum absorption and a same decrescent Eg value around 4.88 eV, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The stronger UV absorption and the bathochromic-shift of Eg possibly result from the densified films by atom reconstruction under high temperatures.

The surface morphologies of ε-Ga2O3 films are presented in Fig. 2(a–d). The pristine layer contains a typical grain size in the order of 80–180 nm, and the large grains are mingled with numerous small grains with sizes less than 50 nm, as exhibited in Fig. 2(a). While these small grains decrease after post-annealing, and more uniform grain size can be observed with air annealing, as shown in Fig. 2(c). In addition, with enough oxygen supply, the ε-Ga2O3 grains can further grow up, leading to a rough surface, as displayed in Fig. 2(d). The grow-up or decrease in the small grains can lessen the crystal boundaries in ε-Ga2O3 which is of help to the carrier migration. As illustrated in Fig. 2(e) and (f), the fabricated ε-Ga2O3 films are homogeneous with the thickness of around 350 nm and demonstrate columnar contrasts that suggest a columnar growth of the material, as reported in TEM characterization.30 Obviously, the annealing process with high energies and enough oxygen supplies can not only realize the grain growth but also result in a denser ε-Ga2O3 film, which would impose significant impacts on the optical and electrical properties.

To trace the influences of post-annealing atmospheres on the material composition, the deconvolution procedure of O1s and Ga2p XPS peaks are performed in Fig. 3. All measured peak data have been calibrated referring to the C1s binding energy of 284.8 eV. The core level spectra of O1s mainly constituted by two components are fitted by the Gaussian–Lorentzian function, as shown in Fig. 3(a–d). The major constituent located at the binding energy of around 530.5 eV is related to the lattice oxygen that contributes to the chemical stoichiometry, usually named as OI.31–33 The other portion in the higher binding energy of around 532.6 eV is generally assigned to the O2− ions in the VO region, which results in non-stoichiometric oxides, defined as OII.31–34 It is noteworthy to mention that the OII area diminishes as the annealing oxygen concentrations increase with the OII/OI ratio changing from 0.31 to 0.18 after air annealing and 0.17 after oxygen annealing, which hints that the VO defects can be effectively suppressed in the high-temperature oxidizing atmosphere. However, in the Ar reducing atmosphere, the OII proportion enlarges with the OII/OI ratio of 0.35. Calculated from the XPS surface etching data, the O/Ga atomic ratio demonstrates an opposite trend to the OII/OI ratio, as shown in Fig. 3(e). The O/Ga ratio of the pristine ε-Ga2O3 is 1.4, evidencing that the just-fabricated ε-Ga2O3 is native oxygen-deficient, which agrees with the β-phase.35–37 The O/Ga atomic ratio is visibly increased after oxidation annealing, and the increased O atoms could replace the VO in ε-Ga2O3 films, leading to an ideal stoichiometric composition.35,37 Unexpectedly, the O/Ga ratio with Ar annealing is slightly higher than that in pristine, which may be induced by the sample contamination. In Fig. 3(f), the Ga2p XPS spectra display two peaks for the Ga element, which are assigned to Ga2p1/2 and Ga2p3/2, respectively, of which the Ga2p3/2 peak is related to the Ga–O band.31 Compared with the Ga2p3/2 binding energy of 1117.5 eV in the pristine layers, the shift of the Ga2p3/2 peak to the higher binding energy after oxidation annealing is indicative of the increase in the Ga–O binding structure.31,36

VO in semiconductor oxides gives rise to excess electrons that have the potential to affect the device performances by modulating the charge carrier transfer.32,38,39 Therefore, to have an insight into the role of VO in the PD performances, the systematic photoelectricity tests are carried out on the constructed MSM devices. The current–voltage (I–V) curves are measured in dark and light conditions, as shown in Fig. 4(a), in which the light source is wavelength of 254 nm with the intensity of 500 μW cm−2. The pristine PD suffers from a large leakage current and a depressive photocurrent, generating a small photo-to-dark current ratio (PDCR) of 69.5 in 5 V bias. After annealed in oxidizing atmosphere, the leakage current dramatically decreases into as low as 28 fA, and the photocurrent is promoted to as high as 2.98 μA, obtaining a super-high PDCR of 1.06 × 108 in O2-700 PD. Such outstanding device performances are benefitted from the high-dense and defect-less ε-Ga2O3 epilayers. Although the reduction annealing can generate a definite decrease in the leakage current, the photocurrent becomes smaller because of the introduction of extra VO defects, hence inducing a limited PDCR of 5.17 × 102 in Ar-700 PD. The on/off switching characteristics of ε-Ga2O3 PDs are displayed in Fig. 4(b). The current–time (I–T) curves prove the same regulating trend as the I–V curves, with a small on/off switching ratio of 16.7 in pristine PD and a super heightened on/off switching ratio of 5.92 × 106 in O2-700 PD. The device with larger photocurrent will remain larger off current in the same decay time because of the limited consumption of remanent charge carriers in a definite system.40 Consequently, the on/off switching ratio in Air-700 PD is slightly larger than that in O2-700 PD.

The responsivities (R) and detectivities (D) for different annealing conditions as a function of power intensities are presented in Fig. 4(c) and (d). Assuming the shot noise of the dark current as the major component of the total current, R and D can be calculated from the relations of R = (Iλ–Id)/(PλS) and , in which the Iλ, Id, Pλ, S and e are the photocurrent, dark-current, light intensity, effective illumination area and the charge of electron, respectively.40–42 With the power intensities increasing from 10 to 500 μW cm−2, both R and D decrease to a relatively stable state, demonstrating a nonlinear relationship. This self-limiting gain is attributed to the filling of high-gain trap states under higher power intensity that induces larger charge carrier scattering and higher electron–hole recombination possibility.40,43,44 Under the light illumination of 500 μW cm−2 and bias of 5 V, the O2-700 PD achieves a large R of 1.368 A W−1 and an excellent D of 9.13 × 1014 Jones.
Linear dynamic range (LDR) is an important quality of PD evaluating the range of incident light illumination on which the photo-response is linear. LDR can be determined by the equation LDR = 20log(Pmax/Pmin), in which the Pmax is the largest input light power and the Pmin is the minimum detectable light power.40,45 By measuring the photocurrents with varying light intensities from 1 × 10−5 to 5 × 10−4 W cm−2, as given in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the inferred LDRs are computed and compared in Fig. 4(e). The O2-700 annealing process makes the ε-Ga2O3 PD achieve a large LDR of 176.7 dB, which is even better than that of GaN (50 dB), InGaAs (66 dB) and Si PDs (120 dB).46,47
To repeat the modulating results, seven devices for every annealing condition are fabricated. The homologous statistical analyses of external quantum efficiency (EQE) data are depicted in Fig. 4(e). It is notable that the EQE performance can be greatly improved by reducing the VO in ε-Ga2O3 thin films. Thus, O2-700 PD can obtain a large EQE value of 666.5% under 5 V bias, which is 30 times larger than the pristine device. During the transfer process of photogenerated carriers, the VO defects become the trap centers for electrons, which would improve the recombination possibility. The augment of VO in films could suppress the EQE characteristic, resulting in a low EQE of 0.7% in Ar-700 PD. Moreover, the low electron–hole recombination probability is beneficial to the migration of changer carriers producing fast response speed. By fitting with the formula of I = I0 + Ae−t/τ1 + Be−t/τ2,28 the transient response speeds are evaluated in Fig. 4(f). As summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), O2-700 PDs with the densest ε-Ga2O3 films and the lowest VO defects acquire the fastest rise/decay time (τr/τd) of 61.1/87.5 ms. The fully comprehensive comparisons of the PD performances between our devices and recently reported ε-Ga2O3 PDs are summarized in Table 1. Our devices demonstrate a comparable photodetection performance and a particularly outstanding spectral identification capability.

Fig. 5(a) is the schematic of the oxidation and deoxidation effect on the native oxygen-deficient ε-Ga2O3 with oxidizing and reducing atmosphere, which discloses the evolution mechanism of VO in the crystalline structure. Normally, the oxides would keep an equilibration of VO with the O2 of the surrounding atmosphere in a conditional temperature.48 Only at high temperatures, the VO becomes mobile and its concentration will be affected by the surrounding oxygen atmosphere.49 If annealing the native oxygen-deficient oxides such as the pristine ε-Ga2O3 films in oxidizing conditions containing sufficient oxygen, the O2 molecules could decompose into O atoms with high energy, and then the active O atoms diffuse into the lattice structure occupying the VO and becoming the lattice O atoms. The formation of the lattice oxygen by oxidization to produce an ideally stoichiometric ε-Ga2O3 can be calculated from the reaction: . However, when the native oxygen-deficient oxides were annealed in the reducing condition, such as Ar, the lattice O atoms would desorb from the crystalline structure becoming O2 and leaving the VO defects, which increase the VO concentration in ε-Ga2O3. The formation of this VO case can be described by the reaction: .
 Fig. 5  The schematic of (a) the oxidation and deoxidation effects on the native oxygen-deficient ε-Ga2O3; the change carrier excitation and recombination in ε-Ga2O3 with (b) high and (c) low VO concentrations. 
The deep-level defects are widely regarded as the carrier killers for their trapping effects and the associated mechanisms of charge carrier migration and recovery are quite intricate.50,51 To explore the physical mechanism of VO defects modulating the PD performances, the schematics of carrier excitation and recombination in ε-Ga2O3 PDs with high and low VO concentrations are illustrated in Fig. 5(b) and (c). In general, VO is identified as the deep-level defect of Ga2O3 located at the energy level of ∼2.0 eV under the conduction band (CB).51 The PD implements the UV detection by absorbing UV photons and exciting the ground-state electrons jumping from the valence band (VB) into CB.54 However, acting as the recombination centers for the electron–hole pairs, the VO point defects would trap the excited electrons from VB and recombine with the recovered electrons from CB, as shown in Fig. 5(b), inducing a decrease in the effective charge carriers and diffusion lengths. Inversely, the less VO defects in ε-Ga2O3 as demonstrated in Fig. 5(c) would reduce the consumption of transferring electrons and prompt the transformation of UV photons into charge carriers. On the other hand, the narrower bandgap of the oxidized ε-Ga2O3 is also favor for the absorption of UV photons and conversion of energy.
Furthermore, the spectral responses with wavelength ranging from 200 to 700 nm for ε-Ga2O3 PDs have been investigated in Fig. 6. The depression of VO in oxidized ε-Ga2O3 thin films makes the relevant PD acquire an enhanced R in the solar-blind region (200–280 nm) and an ultralow R in the visible region (400–700 nm), implying a superhigh ultraviolet/visible rejection ratio (R240/R400) of 1.8 × 107 in O2-700 PD, which is 5 magnitudes higher than the pristine PD and also superior than the best reported.27 The defect-less ε-Ga2O3 PD gains the largest R of 2.8 A W−1 and the highest D of 1.88 × 1015 Jones in the wavelength of 235 nm.

The operation stability of O2-700 PD was measured after being stored in the normal atmospheric environment over 3 months. As displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†), O2-700 PD still retains high-sensitivity towards the 254 nm light signal and keeps a scarcely degraded photocurrent. Even working continuously over 110 on/off switching cycles lasting more than 4400 s, the transient response also maintains a great repeatability and the fast response speed as before. The prominent operation reliability indicates the good chemical and structural stability of ε-Ga2O3.
Conclusion
In this study, the VO concentrations in ε-Ga2O3 thin films are regulated by a sample post-annealing method inducing the formation or desorption process of the lattice oxygen atoms under an oxidizing or reducing atmosphere. By acting as the carrier killer to trap the excited electrons from VB and recombine the recovery electrons from CB, the VO defects reveal an effective modulating effect on the ε-Ga2O3 PD performances under UV radiation and optimize ε-Ga2O3 PD to achieve a highly enhanced photodetection property with a PDCR of 1.06 × 108, on/off switching ratio of 5.92 × 106, R of 1.368 A W−1, D of 9.13 × 1014, LDR of 176.7 dB, EQE of 666.5%, rise/decay time of 61.1/87.5 ms, and a record-high R240/R400 of 1.8 × 107. This VO modulating method could open the route of high-performance photoelectric devices for ε-Ga2O3.
