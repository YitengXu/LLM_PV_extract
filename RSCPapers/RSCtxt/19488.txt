    , Accepted 4th March 2016First published on 4th March 2016AbstractA series of solvent additive-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with PBDT-TS1:PC71BM (1:2, wt/wt) as the active layers; the performance of the PSCs can be enhanced by using MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB mixed solvent spin-coating treatment on the active layers. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was increased from 6.69% to 7.21% or 7.76% by spin-coating the mixed solvents onto the active layers, respectively. The PCE improvement may be attributed to the increase in PC71BM elevated toward the top surface of the active layers during the mixed solvent spin-coating treatment. The redistribution of PC71BM in the active layers could also be indirectly confirmed from the variation of photoluminescence spectra and water contact angles of the corresponding films, as well as the J–V curves of electron-only devices.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention and huge progress has been made in the last decade.1,2 Up to now, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has surpassed 10% through constant advances in material synthesis and device physics.3,4 It is known that the PCE of PSCs is codetermined by photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection.5–7 Some excellent electron donor materials have been developed with adjustable band gap, high absorption coefficient and high charge carrier mobility, such as quaterthiophene (4T-2OD) based polymers,8 quaterthiophene (Th4) based polymers,9 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based polymers.10 Fullerene derivatives have been commonly used as electron acceptor materials for obtaining highly efficient PSCs. Zhan et al. reported a series of excellent fullerene-free electron acceptor materials with adjustable band gap to cover a large range of the solar spectrum for better photon harvesting, meanwhile PSCs with fullerene-free materials as electron acceptors exhibit good stability.11–13 Donor/acceptor vertical phase separation with more donor material enriched near the top surface of the active layers may result in serious charge carrier recombination and relatively low performance for conventional structured PSCs.14,15 Inverted configuration PSCs were fabricated to take full advantage of vertical phase separation for performance improvement.16,17 Meanwhile, many efficient strategies have been applied to deliberately elevate the electron acceptor material toward the top surface of the active layers in the conventional structure, such as using mixed solvents, solvent additives, solvent vapor annealing and methanol soaking the active layers with residual solvent additive. Wang et al. reported that the PCE of PSCs was increased from 4.66% to 7.20% for active layers with mixed solvent vapor annealing: the PCE improvement was mainly attributed to the increase of PC71BM elevated toward the top surface of the active layers during the mixed solvent vapor treatment.18 Zhang et al. also reported that the PCE of PSCs based on PBDT-TS1:indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as the active layer was increased from 3.25% to 4.16% by drying the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctance (DIO) processed active layers under vacuum conditions, more ICBA may be elevated toward the top surface of the active layer during the accelerated volatilization of residual DIO from the active layers.19 It is known that the performance of PSCs can be enhanced by doping a small amount of solvent additive (less than 3 v%) in the blend solutions.20,21 However, the doping ratio and processing time of solvent additive should be accurately controlled in order to obtain highly efficient PSCs.22 In fact, some of the solvent additive may be left in the active layers due to its high boiling point; the residual solvent additive may result in the instability of PSCs.23 It is necessary to completely remove the residual solvent additive in the active layers for efficient PSCs with high stability.
Recently, Lee and coworkers reported that the PCE of PSCs in the absence of solvent additive in the active layers could be increased by a factor of ∼2 by soaking the active layers with inert solvent additive DIO, which was mainly attributed to the nano-morphology reconstruction of the active layers.24,25 Hou et al. reported that the PCE of PSCs with PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM active layers was increased from 7.07% to 7.53% by spin-coating the inert solvent methanol (MeOH) onto the active layers.26 The PCE improvement was attributed to the increase in PC71BM materials elevated toward the top surface of the active layers along with the residual DIO extracted from within the active layers. Zhang et al. reported that the PCE of PSCs was increased from 6.13% to 8.69% by adjusting the MeOH soaking time on the solvent additive DIO processed active layers.27 The MeOH soaking time plays an important role in extracting DIO from the active layers, some PC71BM molecules can be elevated toward the top surface of active layers during the DIO escape from the active layers, because PC71BM can be selectively dissolved in DIO. In fact, it is necessary to develop a solvent additive-free approach to elevate the electron acceptor toward the top surface of active layers for the performance improvement of solvent additive-free PSCs.
In this work, a series of solvent additive-free PSCs were fabricated with PBDT-TS1:PC71BM as active layers to investigate the effect of spin-coating mixed solvents on the vertical phase separation of the active layers. The mixed solvents were prepared by mixing MeOH with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) or chlorobenzene (CB), keeping the doping volume ratio as 9:1 (v/v). The PCE of PSCs was increased from 6.69% to 7.21% or 7.76% by spin-coating MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB mixed solvents onto the active layers, respectively, which was mainly attributed to the increase of PC71BM elevated toward the top surface of the active layers. The redistribution of PC71BM near the top surface of the active layers could be indirectly evaluated from the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and water contact angle (WCA) characterization of films with or without solvent treatment and the J–V curves of the related electron-only devices with the active layers having the same treatment conditions.
Experimental
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15 Ω □−1) were consecutively cleaned with detergent (RM11-07), de-ionized water and ethanol in ultrasonic baths, respectively. The cleaned ITO substrates were dried in an oven and treated with oxygen plasma for about 60 s. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios AI 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO coated substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s. Then the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates were annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes in ambient conditions and then transferred into a high purity N2 filled glove box. The mixed PBDT-TS1:PC71BM materials were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 with a PBDT-TS1:PC71BM weight doping ratio of 1:2 (wt/wt). Then, the blend solutions were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates at 1000 rpm for 40 s to prepare the active layers. All the pristine active layers were stored in high N2 conditions for about 40 minutes, and then part of the active layers were treated by spin-coating MeOH, MeOH:CH2Cl2 (9:1, v/v) or MeOH:CB (9:1, v/v) mixed solvents at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was dissolved in MeOH at a concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1 with the addition of 0.25 vol% acetic acid. The PFN solutions were spin-coated onto the active layers at 3000 rpm for 40 s to prepare the interfacial buffer layer. The 100 nm Al cathode was deposited by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask under 3 × 10−4 Pa vacuum conditions. The film thickness was monitored by using a quartz crystal microbalance. The active area of cells is defined as about 3.8 mm2 by the vertical overlap area of ITO and Al electrodes. All the measurements were carried out in ambient conditions.
The absorption spectra of films were measured by using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer. The PL spectra of films were measured using a HORIBA Fluorolog®-3 Spectrofluorometer. The WCA images of films were recorded using a KRÜSS DSA 100 instrument in ambient conditions. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and dark conditions were measured using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. The AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 was provided by an ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. The chemical structures of used molecules and the schematic structure of the cells are shown in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
A series of solvent additive-free PSCs were fabricated with PBDT-TS1:PC71BM as the active layers, with or without solvent spin-coating treatment. The pure MeOH, mixed MeOH:CB or mixed MeOH:CH2Cl2 solvents were directly spin-coated onto the active layers to adjust the donor/acceptor redistribution in the active layers, especially near the top surface of the active layers. It is known that PC71BM can be well dissolved in CB and CH2Cl2, rather than in the widely used inert solvent MeOH,28 while PBDT-TS1 usually has a rather low solubility in common solvents at room temperature.29 The J–V curves of PSCs with or without solvent spin-coating treatment on the active layers were measured and are shown in Fig. 2a. It is apparent that the effect of MeOH spin-coating treatment on the active layers should be negligible due to the almost overlapped J–V curves of cells with MeOH spin-coating treatment and the control cells without solvent treatment. The maximum PCE of the control cells reaches 6.69% along with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.76 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V and a fill factor (FF) of 54.5%. For the cells with MeOH spin-coating treatment on the active layers, the maximum PCE is about 6.66% along with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 15.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 53.8%. The slightly decreased PCE may be due to the slight loss of PC71BM on the top surface of the active layers during spin-coating MeOH solvent. The loss of PC71BM on the top surfaces should result in inefficient electron collection by the PFN/Al electrode, leading to the slightly decreased FF and Jsc. The slightly increased Voc should be attributed to the interfacial dipole induced by the MeOH spin-coating treatment; a similar phenomenon was also reported by Cao and coworkers.30 Apparent performance improvement of PSCs was obtained for the active layers with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatment. The maximum PCE of PSCs was improved to 7.21% or 7.76% for the active layers with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatment, respectively. All the key parameters, Voc, FF and Jsc, of PSCs were simultaneously increased by the mixed solvent spin-coating treatment on the active layers, leading to the PCE of 7.8%, or 16.0% PCE improvement compared with the control PSCs. To further confirm the effect of mixed solvent spin-coating treatment on the performance of PSCs, the EQE spectra of all PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectra of PSCs are slightly increased for the active layers with different solvent spin-coating treatment compared with that of the control PSCs. The PSCs with MeOH spin-coating treatment on active layers exhibit almost overlapped EQE spectra with the control PSCs. According to the EQE spectra of PSCs, the related integral Jsc values of PSCs are 15.73, 15.70, 16.18 or 17.26 mA cm−2 with a similar variation trend observed from the J–V curves. The calculated values are slightly less than the values obtained from the corresponding J–V curves due to the decay of cells without any encapsulation. Based on the J–V curves and EQE spectra of the PSCs, all the key photovoltaic parameters of PSCs are listed in Table 1.

To further confirm the effect of solvent spin-coating treatment on the performance of PSCs, the mixed solvents were dropped onto the active layers with different soaking times and then were spin-coated away from the active layers. The J–V curves of PSCs for the active layers with different solvent soaking times were measured and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). For the active layers with MeOH soaking treatment, the performance of PSCs remained almost constant, suggesting that the effect of MeOH on the active layer can be negligible. For the active layers with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB soaking treatment, the performance of PSCs was markedly decreased along with the increase of mixed solvent soaking time. The key photovoltaic parameters of PSC dependence on soaking time are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The decreased PCE of PSCs should be attributed to the disrupted PBDT-TS1:PC71BM interpenetrating network, especially near the top surface of active layers. It can be envisaged that more PC71BM may be washed off from the top surface of active layers due to its good solubility in CB or CH2Cl2. It means that the phase separation of active layers could be adjusted by solvent treatment due to the decreased PCE of PSCs with solvent soaking treatment on the active layers. More PC71BM may be elevated toward the top surface of active layers by the mixed solvent spin-coating treatment due to the selective solubility of PC71BM in CB or CH2Cl2. Meanwhile, the bicontinuous interpenetrated network may be kept due to the relatively large PC71BM doping ratios in the active layers (PBDT-TS1:PC71BM = 1:2, wt/wt).
To clarify the effect of solvent spin-coating treatment on the performance improvement of PSCs, the absorption spectra of active layers with different solvent spin-coating treatments were measured and are shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption spectra of active layers with different solvent spin-coating treatment were kept almost constant over the whole spectral range, indicating that a rather small portion of PC71BM was washed off during solvent spin-coating treatment on the active layers. Therefore, PCE improvement of PSCs should be attributed to the optimized phase separation in the active layers, especially near the top surface of active layers. To further investigate the effect of solvent spin-coating treatment on PC71BM redistribution in the active layers, the PL spectra of neat and blend films with or without solvent spin-coating treatment were measured under excitation with 475 nm light and are shown in Fig. 3b. The beam path diagram of PL measurement on films is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), where the PL emission should mainly originate from the materials near the top surface of films. It is apparent that the neat PBDT-TS1 and PC71BM films exhibit relatively strong PL emission with peaks at 790 nm and 710 nm, respectively. The 790 nm emission intensity in the blend films is markedly quenched due to the sufficient PBDT-TS1 exciton dissociation assisted by PC71BM in the blend films with a PBDT-TS1:PC71BM doping weight ratio of 1:2 (wt/wt). Meanwhile, the weak PL emission of PC71BM can be observed due to the relatively large content in the active layers. It is apparent that the 790 nm emission intensity of blend films was slightly decreased by MeOH spin-coating treatment, indicating that part of PC71BM may be washed off from the top surface of active layers. It is interesting that the 710 nm emission intensity of blend films was slightly enhanced for the films with mixed solvent spin-coating treatment, which may be due to the increase of PC71BM elevated toward the top surface of active layers. For the blend films with relatively high PC71BM content, the PC71BM redistribution may be beneficial to optimize vertical phase separation for efficient charge carrier transport and collection in the active layers. It is known that the change of composition on the top surface of blend films should result in the varied surface energy of the blend layers. The water contact angle (WCA) of the films provides an effective tool to investigate the surface energy of films.26,27 The information on the surface energy of the active layers may be used to analyse the active layer surface composition change induced by the solvent spin-coating treatment.

The WCA characterization of the active layers with or without solvent spin-coating treatment was carried out and the corresponding images are shown in Fig. 4. The WCAs of neat PBDT-TS1 and PC71BM film are about 104.4° and 94.5°, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The apparent difference of WCA for the neat films provides the potential to investigate the surface composition change of blend films with different solvent spin-coating treatment. The WCA images of PBDT-TS1:PC71BM blend films without or with different solvent spin-coating treatments are shown in Fig. 4c–f. The WCA is about 102° for the PBDT-TS1:PC71BM blend films without solvent treatment, which is between those of neat PBDT-TS1 and PC71BM films. The WCA of blend films was slightly increased to 102.3° for the blend films with MeOH spin-coating treatment, which could be attributed to the decreased PC71BM content on the top surface of the blend films. For the blend layers with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatment, the WCAs of blend films were markedly decreased from 102° to 99.3° or 98.4°, respectively. The decreased WCAs of blend films should be due to the enriched PC71BM on the top surface of the blend films. The fractions (f) of the blend film surfaces covered by PC71BM can be calculated by fitting the WCAs to the Cassie–Baxter equation:31cosθ = fcosθPC71BM + (1 − f)cosθPBDT-TS1where θPBDT-TS1, θPC71BM and θ are the measured WCAs of neat PBDT-TS1 film, neat PC71BM film and the blend film, respectively. The calculated surface coverage fractions of PC71BM on the top surface of the blend films are about 24.0%, 20.2%, 51.2% or 60.3% for the blend films without/with MeOH, mixed solvents MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatments, respectively. It is worth noting that the surface coverage fractions of PC71BM were markedly increased to 51.2% or 60.3% for the blend films with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatments, suggesting that more PC71BM may be elevated toward the top surface of the blend films. The experimental results of WCA characterization can further confirm our speculation on the redistribution of PC71BM in the active layers, especially on the top surface of active layers. The aggregation of PC71BM toward the top surface of active layer should be beneficial for the photogenerated electron collection by the PFN/Al cathode.

To further investigate the effect of PC71BM redistribution in the active layers on charge carrier transport and collection ability, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff = V0 − V) curves of all PSCs were calculated according to the J–V curves in dark conditions and under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5. The J–V curves of all PSCs in dark conditions are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is known that Jph is defined as the difference between the current density under illumination (Jl) and the current density in dark conditions (Jd), thus Jph = Jl − Jd.32,33V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and V is the applied bias voltage. The Jph of all PSCs rapidly come into the saturation state under a relatively low Veff and reach the maximum saturation current density (Jsat) at about Veff = 2 V. Generally, it can be assumed that all photogenerated excitons could be dissociated into free charge carriers and then all the photogenerated charge carriers can be fully collected by the individual electrode at high Veff. In this case, the Jsat value should be solely determined by the exciton generation rate.34 For the PSCs with mixed solvent spin-coating treatment of the active layers, the corresponding PSCs exhibit a relatively large Jsat due to the optimized phase separation or PC71BM redistribution in the active layers. Under the assumption, exciton dissociation efficiency in the active layers can be evaluated according to the Jph/Jsat values at short circuit conditions.35 The product of exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency can be evaluated according to the Jph/Jsat values at the maximum power output conditions, where the recombination of charge carriers strongly competes with carrier extraction under the low inner electric field in the active layer.36 The Jph, Jsat and Jph/Jsat values under different conditions of all the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. The Jph/Jsat values at short circuit conditions are increased to 94.0% or 95.0% for the active layers with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatments, indicating that the enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency may be due to the PC71BM redistribution in the active layers. Meanwhile, the Jph/Jsat values at the maximum power output conditions are also increased to 72.3% or 75.0% for the active layers with MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB spin-coating treatments, which may be attributed to the enhanced exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection efficiency dependence on the phase separation of the active layers.

According to the WCA characterization of the active layers with or without solvent spin-coating treatment, more PC71BM could be elevated toward the top surface of active layers. In fact, the redistribution of PC71BM in the bulk of active layers is difficult to discern by 2D transmission electron microscope images or other characterization. It can be envisaged that the redistribution of PC71BM could be indirectly reflected from the electric properties of the active layers. To further confirm the effect of solvent spin-coating treatment on electron transport and collection in the active layers, electron-only devices with the structure ITO/PFN/PBDT-TS1:PC71BM/PFN/Al (100 nm) were prepared under the same fabrication conditions as used for the corresponding solar cells.
The J–V curves of electron-only devices were measured in dark conditions and under the reverse bias, as shown in Fig. 6. The PFN buffer layer was used to pin the Fermi level of the ITO or Al electrode to about −4.1 eV,37,38 which was beneficial for the injection of electrons from the electrode onto the LUMO of PC71BM molecules (−3.91 eV). Under the reverse bias, the electrons will be injected by the Al electrode and collected by the ITO electrode. It is apparent that the devices exhibit relatively large current density based on the active layers with mixed solvent spin-coating treatment, which should be mainly attributed to the easier electron injection and transport in the active layers. In fact, the electron injection from PFN/Al or transport in the active layers can be hardly discerned from the increased current density of devices with the mixed solvent spin-coating treatment on the active layers. It is known that the electron injection and transport properties strongly depend on the PC71BM redistribution on the surface or in the bulk of active layers. Based on PL spectra and WCA characteristics of neat and blend films without or with different solvent spin-coating treatments, as well as the J–V curves of electron-only devices, the performance improvement of PSCs could be attributed to the optimized phase separation or enriched PC71BM near the top surface of active layers during the mixed solvent spin-coating treatment.

Conclusions
In summary, the PCE of PSCs with PBDT-TS1:PC71BM as active layers was increased from 6.69% to 7.21% or 7.76% for active layers with mixed MeOH:CH2Cl2 or MeOH:CB solvent spin-coating treatments. The performance improvement of PSCs should be attributed to the increase of PC71BM elevated toward the top surface of active layers during the solvent spin-coating treatment. The enriched PC71BM near the top surface of the active layers could be confirmed from the PL spectra, the WCA characterization of blend films and the corresponding electron-only devices. The mixed solvent spin-coating treatment on the active layers may be an efficient and simple method to optimize the phase separation of active layers for solvent additive-free PSCs.
