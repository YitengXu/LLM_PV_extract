    , Accepted 6th April 2017First published on 7th April 2017AbstractTwo non-fullerene acceptors with a three-dimensional structure based on the reported DBFI-T molecule (an arylenediimide-containing system) were theoretically modelled to study their performance as acceptor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). Many performance indices were employed to judge the molecules designed by us on the basis of density functional theory/time-dependent density function theory (DFT/TDDFT). Compared with DBFT-T, the modelled molecule 2 has a larger density of states in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and more low lying excited states in the anion, which greatly favors the charge separation process in OSCs. The comparison of charge separation/recombination rates (kCS/kCR) evaluated by considering the influence of low-lying excited states at the PSEHTT (donor)/acceptor interface suggests that molecules 1 and 2 have a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) than DBFI-T, since they have higher kCS and lower kCR. Moreover, many other important parameters, such as the open circuit voltage, energetic driving force and absorption spectrum were also provided, which further illustrates the efficacy of molecules 1 and 2 in OSCs.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), as a promising green technology developed for safe and clean renewable energy sources via conversion of solar energy into electricity, have several advantages over the inorganic solar cells, such as tunable flexibility, low cost and light weight.1–3 Among various OSC devices, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell is a type of architecture that can be commonly used. The combination of electron donor materials and electron acceptor materials leads to the formation of an interpenetrating network which contains donor–acceptor interfacial areas in the OSC devices. Compared to the early days of single heterojunction OSCs generating about 1%4 power conversion efficiency (PCE), progress over the last three decades has been dramatic. A PCE over 12%5 for a single-junction solar cell and a PCE of 13.2%6 for multi-junction solar cell devices have been achieved in recent years. Molecular engineering of materials, as a useful tool, has become one of the major ways to promote the development of OSCs. Currently, many efforts have been devoted toward the development of novel donor materials7–9 with low bandgap and high mobility. In fact, acceptor materials are of equal importance as donor materials for high performance OSCs. Until now, fullerene and its derivatives (fullerenes) are still the dominating acceptors due to their superior electron affinity and good transport properties.9–12 However, their poor photochemical stability and high cost for this series of OSCs reveals that PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) as an acceptor material is far from optimum.13,14 They have been recognized as having several disadvantages including a difficult synthesis, weak absorption in the visible region, long-term stability and relatively low bandgaps which limit the maximum obtainable open circuit voltage (Voc) in heterojunction systems.15–19 The issues about fullerenes addressed above provide a strong incentive for the exploration of novel, easily processable and cheap acceptor materials. In recent years, non-fullerene acceptor materials offering many advantages, such as facile synthesis, high absorbance in the solar spectrum, and tuned energy levels in a wider range than fullerenes20–28 have been attracting more and more attention from researchers.
In view of recent research progress in new non-fullerene organic acceptors, there is almost no non-fullerene acceptor material whose photoelectric performance can outdo that of fullerenes. Troisi and co-workers propose that the existence of low lying excited states in anions and large density of states at LUMOs can increase the charge separation rates for fullerene systems.29 Recently, numerous efforts have been made to develop non-fullerene acceptors with the aim of not only overcoming their disadvantages but also retaining the favorable properties of fullerenes.30–33 Lately, Samson A. Jenekhe and co-workers34 reported a three-dimensional (3D) structure non-fullerene organic acceptor DBFI-T (shown in Fig. 1), which is composed of the 8-(17-phenyl)-7,9,16,18-tetraazabenzodifluoranthene-3,4,12,13-tetracarboxylic acid diimide (BFI) moiety and thiophene (T) moiety in the middle, exhibiting superior charge photogeneration and photovoltaic properties. The PCE of an OSC device constructed from PSEHTT/DBFI-T reached 5.04%,34 and a higher PCE (8.52%) of OSCs based on DBFI-T derivatives was exhibited.35,36 Except for a similar distribution of low lying excited states in DBFI-T with PC61BM, a larger π-conjugated framework and nonplanar 3D architecture of this kind of materials are another two important characteristics which contribute to their high performance in OSCs. With the aim of further boosting the efficiencies of OSCs, taking DBFI-T as a reference, we designed two compounds 1 and 2 (shown in Fig. 1) by modifying and replacing the central unit T with benzene (B) and triphenylamine (TH), respectively. More low lying excited states and energy level degeneracy in LUMO were expected since their structural diversity and dimension were increased. Taking PSEHTT as a donor and molecules 1 and 2 as acceptors, the electronic structures, absorption spectra and interface charge separation/recombination (CS/CR) rates were investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. The designed molecules have larger potentiality in OSC than DBFI-T through comparison of some properties related to the cell performance. Finally, we expect to find more promising acceptor candidates other than DBFI-T, and thus improve the PCEs in OSC devices.

2 Computational methods
Although the alkyl chain affects the solubility and intermolecular packing of the material, the almost insignificant influence on the electronic structure impels us to use the methyl to replace the alkyl chain37–41 to save computational costs. All the ground state geometry optimizations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, since it has been demonstrated that the functional and basis set have been shown to provide reliable electronic trends for OSC molecules.42 As for the absorption, based on the optimized geometries in chloroform solution, we simulated the absorption spectrum of DBFI-T by using nine functionals (CAM-B3LYP, PBE0, M06, M062X, B3LYP, BP86, BLYP, LC-ωPBE, LC-BLYP) with the same basis set 6-31G(d,p) within the framework of TDDFT. The effect of the solvent (chloroform) was taken into account within a polarizable continuum model (PCM) in a nonequilibrium and linear response (LR) during TDDFT calculations. The simulated and experimental absorption spectra are summarized in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results show that the CAM-B3LYP functional provides reliable results when compared to the experimental spectra and therefore this functional was applied into the calculation of the spectra for all compounds. The absorption spectra were visualized using Multiwfn 3.2 software.43
To optimize the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface structure, the isolated donor and acceptor were put together to simulate the interface geometry, the starting separation distance between PSEHTT and the acceptor is set as 3.5 Å44 and the reference structures are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†). To give a better description of the weak interaction between the donor and the acceptor, the ground-state geometries of the D/A interface were optimized using the B3LYP-D2/6-31G(d,p) method, which adds the D2 version of Grimme’s dispersion.45 Then, the ground-state and cationic state energies of all systems were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Meanwhile, excited states were calculated in the framework of TDDFT by using the long range corrected CAM-B3LYP46 and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. All the calculations were carried out in the Gaussian 09 program package.47
The charge transport mechanism, considering the very weak coupling at the D/A interface, can be described as the non-adiabatic electron transfer theory. The rates of charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) at the interface are computed from the well-known semi-classical Marcus formula48 (1)wherein VDA represents the electronic coupling between the initial and final states, λ and ΔG are the reorganization energy and Gibbs free energy of the reaction, respectively. And T is the temperature which is set to 300 K in our calculations, kB and h denote the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively. The computational details of the total reorganization energy (λ), the electronic coupling (VDA), and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) are presented in our previous work,49 and the corresponding computations are given in the ESI.†
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic structure
We all know that the electronic structure of a compound determines its photoelectronic properties, and it is important to analyze the electronic structure first. All the optimized structures and frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) are plotted in Fig. 2 and 3. Studies have shown that a twisted nonplanar 3D backbone structure of the acceptor appears to improve morphological compatibility with the donor and thereby significantly facilitate the charge separation process compared to other planar molecules.34,50,51 As seen from Fig. 2, two BFI units in DBFI-T are twisted with an angle of 32.5° which is in accordance with the experimental results (32.7°), while 1 and 2 have larger twist angles, which are 86.2° and 91°, respectively, suggesting their more favorable 3D structures. It is obviously seen from the FMOs in Fig. 3 that the FMOs of DBFI-T and molecule 1 have analogous distribution characteristics, i.e., the HOMOs mainly occupy the electron-donating unit in BFI and the central linkage, while the LUMOs are mainly localized on the electron-deficient moiety in BFI. For molecule 2, the HOMO and the LUMO are mainly concentrated on the TH and BFI units, respectively. Therefore, these results manifest that the introduction of an electron-donating unit has a large influence on the molecular structure and FMO distribution.

3.2 Open circuit voltage and energetic driving force
As mentioned earlier, Voc exerts a crucial influence on the device PCE, and many researchers have found that Voc has close connection with the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.52–54 (2)In which e represents the elementary charge, EIP(D) and EEA(A) are the ionization potential of the isolated donor and the electron affinity of the isolated acceptor, respectively, and ΔV is an empirical term which corresponds to the exciton binding energy. The value of EIP(D)–EEA(A) has been normally estimated from the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. It has been reported that the exciton binding energy is in the range of 0.1–1 eV. Therefore, 0.5 eV, which is the intermediate value, was used in our calculations.52,55 The FMO energy levels of all compounds including the donor molecule PSEHTT were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in chloroform solution and the results are collected in Table 1. The Voc values were also obtained and are listed in Table 1 based on the FMO energy levels. Compared with DBFI-T, molecules 1 and 2 show higher Voc values (1.21 and 1.22 V, respectively). And the LUMO levels of 1 and 2 were enhanced by 0.02 and 0.03 eV, respectively. As a result, a slight improvement in Voc for designed molecules was achieved.

To complete the charge separation process, enough energetic driving force (ΔE) is required, which is also estimated based upon the FMO energies.56 It is reported that ΔE > 0.35 eV will increase the probability of dissociation of exciton into free carriers at the D/A interface.57 As can be seen from Table 1, the ΔE values of DBFI-T, 1 and 2 are 0.90, 0.88, and 0.87 eV, respectively, which are larger than 0.35 eV. Therefore, the designed molecules 1 and 2 possess large enough ΔE values to guarantee effective exciton dissociation at the D/A interface.
3.3 Absorption spectra
Extensive research on OSCs has shown that harvesting photons is a key step to produce the short-circuit current density (Jsc) in the device and the absorption spectra of the acceptors should match the solar spectrum as much as possible. Hence, to better understand photo-physical processes, the photoexcitation properties of acceptors were investigated. The electronic transition properties of the investigated systems were evaluated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, and the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated excitation energies, oscillator strengths and main configurations of all systems are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). As seen in Fig. 4 and Table S1 (ESI†), all the investigated acceptor molecules have better absorption within the range of the solar spectrum and the maximum absorption peaks are about 356, 353 and 354 nm, respectively. For DBFI-T, the absorption with the largest oscillator strength is originated from the S0 → S12 transition, corresponding to the contribution from HOMO−1 → LUMO+2 and HOMO−1 → LUMO transitions. Compared with DBFI-T, the maximum absorption peak of 1 corresponds to the S0 → S10 transition that can be ascribed to HOMO−3 → LUMO+2 and HOMO−3 → LUMO+3 transitions. In addition, the maximum absorption peak for molecule 2 arises from the S0 → S20 transition, which mainly corresponds to the HOMO−5 → LUMO+3 and HOMO−5 → LUMO+5 transitions. Molecules 1 and 2 have a similar maximum absorption peak for DBFI-T. More importantly, the absorption spectrum of 1 in high energy region is broader than those of others, which can match better with the donor than that of DBFI-T. Therefore, considering the increase of optical absorption and the Jsc, the OSCs may have high efficiency when molecule 1 is used as an acceptor material.

3.4 Interface charge separation and charge recombination process
The working mechanism of the OSC involves optical absorption, and exciton dissociation, as well as charge transport and collection. The most important process is exciton dissociation which mainly happens at the OSC interface.

3.4.1 Low lying excited state. 
The electron-accepting ability of the acceptor exerts a crucial influence on Jsc. Some research studies have shown that PC61BM serves as a dominant acceptor because of its special characteristics,29 namely, multiple degenerates in the LUMO and low excited levels occupied in anions. Fortunately, that DBFI-T is better than PC61BM in this respect has been proved.34 Therefore, we firstly calculated the excitation energies of the anions and energy level degeneracy in LUMOs for our designed molecules and compared them with DBFI-T. The excitation energies of the anions were calculated at the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and the results are presented in Fig. 5. Firstly, we found that our results are in good agreement with previous theoretical results,29,34 confirming the reasonable quality of the computational method. From these plots, DBFI-T has 6 quasi-degenerate LUMO energy levels and its radical anion has 5 low-lying excited states. The lowest excitation energies are 0.06, 0.15, 0.27, 0.45 and 0.47 eV which mainly correspond to transitions of LUMO → LUMO+2, LUMO → LUMO+1, LUMO → LUMO+5, LUMO → LUMO+4 and LUMO → LUMO+3 (in anion), respectively. In contrast to DBFI-T, molecule 1 has 6 quasi-degenerate LUMO energy levels and 5 low-lying excited states are dominated by the transitions of LUMO → LUMO+1, LUMO → LUMO+4, LUMO → LUMO+5, LUMO → LUMO+3, and LUMO → LUMO+2, respectively. For molecule 2, we find that it has 9 quasi-degenerate LUMOs and 8 low-lying excited states corresponding to LUMO → LUMO+2, LUMO → LUMO+1, LUMO → LUMO+7, LUMO → LUMO+6, LUMO → LUMO+8, LUMO → LUMO+5, LUMO → LUMO+4 and LUMO → LUMO+3, respectively. To summarize, these calculation results show that compared with 6 quasi-degenerate LUMO energy levels and 5 low lying excited states of anion for DBFI-T, the designed molecule 2 has a larger density of states in LUMO energy levels and more low lying excited states in the anion. This suggests that the designed molecule 2 is anticipated to be a better electron acceptor in OSCs than DBFI-T, as more low lying excited states can increase the total CS rate and thus enhance the PCE.

3.4.2 Charge transfer state. 
The performance of the OSC depends on numerous factors but much more largely on the exciton dissociation processes at the interface. To clearly understand the exciton dissociation process at the interface, the first thing is to find the interface charge transfer (CT) state. The CT state at the interface is generally considered as a state with a hole in the donor and an electron in the acceptor. As CT states are intermediary in exciton dissociation, a study of CT state properties is critical to improve the performance of the OSCs.44,55 Donor/acceptor interfaces between the donor PSEHTT and acceptors DBFI-T, 1 and 2 are considered herein. We calculated thirty excited states at the D/A interface, some of which exhibit almost an entire electron transfer from PSEHTT to the acceptor moiety after the transition, and some of them exhibit the hybrid state at the interface, which possesses both CT and single molecule excitation characters. Here, we considered the complete CT states only. Table 2 shows the collective transitions of all CT states for the three interfaces and Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†) depicts the corresponding molecular orbitals to these transitions. According to the transition natures and the frontier molecular orbital distributions, we determined and selected the CT states for each interface model. Taking the PSEHTT/DBFI-T interface as an example, S1, S2, S4, S5 and S9 were assigned as CT states since their transitions are from the donor to the acceptor (shown in Table 2). At the same time, we named the excited states S1, S2, S4, S5 and S9 as CT1, CT2, CT3, CT4 and CT5, respectively. Similarly, for the system PSEHTT/1, the CT states are S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S8, which are named as CT1, CT2, CT3, CT4, CT5 and CT6, respectively, while for PSEHTT/2, we infer that S2, S4, S6, S7, S8 and S9 are CT states (CT1–CT6). Consequently, both PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 have six CT states, while PSEHTT/DBFI-T has five CT states. It indicates that the interfaces based on the designed molecules have more CT states compared with the PSEHTT/DBFI-T interface. Besides, we also exhibit the oscillation strengths of all CT states for the three interfaces in Fig. 6, which suggests that PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 have higher oscillator strength values in some CT states than PSEHTT/DBFI-T, especially for PSEHTT/2. Therefore, more CT states and higher oscillator strengths for the interface models based on the designed molecules 1 and 2 indicate that they may have more chance for charge separation.

3.4.3 Interface charge separation and charge recombination process. 
After the exciton migration to the D/A interface, the next step is electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor material. Although charge recombination (CR) occurs in competition with the electron transfer (charge separation, CS) process, efficient OSCs will tend to minimize the CR rate and maximize the CS rate. The kCS and kCR values can be calculated by taking into account the electronic coupling (VD/A), reorganization energy (λ) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG). In our previous work, we have demonstrated the reliability of our calculation strategy,49 and we display the relevant computational methods of parameters in the ESI.†
According to eqn (S1)–(S3) (ESI†), we have calculated the electronic couplings of these CT states for three systems and listed them in Table 3. It can be seen that compared with PSEHTT/DBFI-T having one large electronic coupling value (larger than 1.0 eV), PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 have more large electronic couplings (2 for PSEHTT/1 and 3 for PSEHTT/2), which suggests that PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 may possess higher CS rates in term of the Marcus eqn (1), since the rate is proportional to the square of electronic coupling. In accordance with eqn (S6)–(S12) (ESI†), we evaluated the reorganization energies for all systems during the CS and CR process, and shown them in Table 4. As we know, the total reorganization energy consists of two components: internal reorganization energy (λi-CS and λi-CR), which comes from the geometrical change of the donor and acceptor, and external reorganization energy (λs), which is derived from the change in the electronic and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium. From Table 4, we can see that different interface systems possess different λi-CS, λi-CR and λs values due to their different geometrical relaxation during charge transfer processes. And it is also obviously shown that the computed reorganization energies (λi-CS, λi-CR and λs) for the PSEHTT/DBFI-T interface are larger than those of the interfaces constituted by molecules 1 and 2, which may be sourced from its larger geometrical changes. At the same time, the larger reorganization energy of the PSEHTT/DBFI-T interface also hints that it may have lower kCS and kCR with reference to the Marcus equation. We note that in the framework of the Marcus electron transfer theory, not only λ but also ΔG + λ should be considered, since they have an exponential relation with the final CT and CR rates. As was claimed in our previous reports,49,54,55 we still consider that all the CS and CR processes are exothermic reactions, namely ΔG < 0. In the Marcus theory expressed by eqn (1), as the absolute value of ΔG increases, the electron transfer rates will reach a maximum when ΔG + λ = 0. It is a critical point. The electron transfer rates decrease with the absolute value of ΔG increasing, which is called as the Marcus inverted region.2 According to eqn (S4) and (S5) (ESI†), we calculated the ΔGCS and ΔGCR values and collected them in Table 4. Combining ΔG with λ, we obtained the ΔGCS + λCS values of PSEHTT/DBFI-T, PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 as −0.586, −0.564 and −0.591 eV in the CS process, respectively, while for the CR process, ΔGCR + λCR of PSEHTT/DBFI-T, PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 are −1.063, −1.109 and −1.142 eV, respectively. Therefore, the absolute value of ΔGCS + λCS is the smallest for PSEHTT/1, and the ΔGCR + λCR value is the largest for PSEHTT/2. In terms of the definition of ΔG shown in eqn (S4) and (S5) (ESI†), we speculated that the differences in ΔG are mainly contributed by the change of LUMO in acceptors, since we took the value of EEA(A) by the LUMO energy level. Molecule 2 has the highest LUMO energy level in all acceptors, which can lead to the lowest absolute value of ΔGCS and the highest absolute value of ΔGCR.

The effect of low lying excited states was taken into consideration by the estimation of the CS rate for these CT states described in Section 3.4.1. It is reported that low lying excited states are helpful to increase kCS in the Marcus inverted region but do not affect kCR.29 Meanwhile, the high kCS has a positive influence on Jsc and the whole device efficiency.38,44,54,58,59 The increasing ΔGCS value of the PSEHTT/DBFI-T interface can result in the increase of the kCS, and this tendency is suitable for the Marcus inverted region. Therefore, the total rate of CS is the sum of the CS rates towards each of the final states in the case that the electronic coupling and the reorganization energy are similar for the charge transfer process. In order to further confirm the accuracy, we simulated three experimental molecules and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 5 and the corresponding computations are given in the ESI.† The results are consistent with the experiment in tendency (PSEHTT/BFI-P2 < PSEHTT/PC61BM < PSEHTT/DBFI-T). Then, for PSEHTT/DBFI-T, we computed the CS rate (kCS1 = 3.33 × 1013 s−1) by using ΔGCS = −1.085 eV when the charge transfer towards the lowest CT state (CT1 state) while for the calculations of the other state, ΔGCS was increased by 0.06, 0.15, 0.27, 0.45, and 0.47 eV, respectively. kCS increases along with ΔGCS becoming less negative, and thus the evaluated CS rates are 1.57 × 1014, 8.45 × 1014, 4.86 × 1015, 2.35 × 1016 and 2.60 × 1016 s−1, respectively. The sum of these rates makes the total CS rates, which are shown in Table 4. Similarly, we estimated the total kCSs for designed systems 1 and 2 and present the results in Table 4. As a consequence, compared with PSEHTT/DBFI-T, the designed systems PSEHTT/1 and PSEHTT/2 have larger kCS and smaller kCR, which may effectively increase Jsc and PCE.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we theoretically designed two 3D non-fullerene organic acceptor molecules based on an arylenediimide unit in order to further improve the efficiency of OSCs. To this end, many parameters, Voc, ΔE, absorption spectra, kCS and kCR have been calculated within the framework of DFT and TDDFT methods. The results suggest that these designed molecules 1 and 2 exhibit excellent Voc, similar absorption spectra with DBFI-T, and sufficient ΔE which can ensure the effective exciton dissociation. Here, molecule 1 has broader absorption in the high energy region than DBFT-T, which may result in higher Jsc. Compared with DBFI-T, the designed molecule 2 has a larger density of states in LUMO energy levels and more low lying excited states in anions. Meanwhile, taking into account the low lying excited state, the designed systems have larger kCS and smaller kCR than PSEHTT/DBFI-T which may gain higher Jsc values. These results imply that designed molecules 1 and 2 could replace DBFI-T as promising acceptor materials for high-performance OSCs. We expect that this work may provide a theoretical guideline for the further development of non-fullerene organic acceptor materials.
