    , Accepted 15th October 2020First published on 16th October 2020AbstractY6-type non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor′–donor–acceptor (A–D–A′–D–A) structure have been very popular in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their excellent performances. In this study, two novel NFAs, BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl were designed by incorporating undecylthio side chains into a thienothiophene moiety and connecting it to two different halogenated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile end groups (2F-IC and 2Cl-IC) respectively. When blended with a donor polymer, PM6, BTPS-4F-based devices achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 16.2% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.82 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.2 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.78, while BTPS-4Cl-based devices achieved an inferior PCE of 13.5%. This is the first time alkylthio chains are employed on Y6-like NFAs to achieve high-performance OSCs. Subsequent characterization showed that the upshifted energy level of BTPS-4F and the better intermolecular packing in PM6:BTPS-4F blends are the major reasons for the enhanced performance of BTPS-4F-based devices over BTPS-4Cl-based ones. This work provides high-performance non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs and demonstrates a promising molecular design strategy that can effectively regulate their energy levels and morphology.
Introduction
Extensive research effort from both academia and industry has been devoted to the development of OSCs due to their unique advantages, such as light weight, transparency, mechanical flexibility and roll-to-roll production feasibility.1–3 Compared to conventional fullerene derivative acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been proved to demonstrate excellent absorption, improved chemical tunability, reduced voltage loss (Vloss), low cost and decent stability in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends.4–7 Recently, multiple research groups have reported PCEs over 17% achieved by NFA-based OSCs, proving the huge application potential of OSCs in the future.8–16
A popular and promising approach is to adopt an acceptor–donor–acceptor′–donor–acceptor (A–D–A′–D–A) structure with tunable side chains and end groups to achieve small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with desirable energy levels, absorption and morphology.17–19 This approach led to an outstanding material Y6 which could achieve a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2, a FF of 74.8% and a PCE of 15.7%.20 Since then, numerous attempts have been made to optimize Y6 and devices based on it.21–26
Recent studies have suggested that an alkylthio side chain is a desirable structural motif because the upshifted LUMO (due to the introduction of electron-donating sulfur atoms) decreases energy loss incurred during exciton dissociation.27,28 The lone pairs on sulfur also increase the electron-donating ability of donor motifs (such as thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT)), resulting in an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect.29–32 When blended with an appropriate donor, these phenomena can improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE), JSC, and ultimately device performance. On the other hand, computational and experimental studies have also shown that sulfur atoms exhibit S–S and S–π interactions.33–36 Since sulfur atoms are commonly found in many optoelectronic materials and side-chain engineering is a common approach to improve intermolecular packing, it is anticipated that alkylthio chains on NFAs can facilitate BHJ formation while maintaining a good domain purity, leading to a high FF and PCE.37–40
With these considerations, we examined the effect of alkylthio chains on Y-series NFAs for the first time. Two novel Y-series acceptors with undecylthio side chains at a TT moiety and end-capped with different halogenated end groups (2F-IC and 2Cl-IC), namely BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl, were designed and systematically investigated (Fig. 1). OSC devices were fabricated using a conventional structure by blending the donor polymer PM6 with the respective SMAs. Devices based on BTPS-4F achieved a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 25.2 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.78 and a PCE of 16.2%, whereas devices based on BTPS-4Cl achieved a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 24.3 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.69 and a PCE of 13.5%. BTPS-4F-based devices demonstrated a better PCE and comparable performance parameters than Y6-based ones when they were first reported. The upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of BTPS-4F and the enhanced intermolecular packing in PM6:BTPS-4F blends were found to be the major reasons for the superior performance of BTPS-4F-based devices to BTPS-4Cl-based devices. Our work has shed light on the structure–performance relationship of alkylthio chain-substituted Y6-type SMAs and suggested the potential application of such a strategy in designing active layer materials for OSCs.

Results and discussion

Scheme 1 depicts the synthetic routes to BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl. Sulfur atoms were introduced in the first step, during which 3-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene was activated by n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) and sulfur powder (S8) was used as the sulfur source. Subsequent addition of 1-bromoundecane then completed the addition of the alkylthio chain. The alkylthio chain was found to be air-stable and unaffected by heat or other reagents in subsequent synthetic steps, suggesting that incorporation of alkylthio chains is a feasible approach to design and synthesize other SMAs. Then, other steps were conducted according to previously reported literature.20 2F-IC and 2Cl-IC end groups were used to yield BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl.41,42 All target compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, which are summarized in the ESI.† The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) derived from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, at 5% weight loss, Fig. S1†) (BTPS-4F: 315 °C, BTPS-4Cl: 299 °C) indicate that both molecules are stable at high temperature and thus suitable for OSC operation.

To elucidate the effects of alkylthio chains, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level to study the geometries and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the SMAs. To simplify the calculations, the undecylthio and 2-ethylhexyl chains were replaced by methylthio and 2-methylpropyl groups respectively. Fig. 2 shows that BTPS-4F has a larger bandgap and upshifted energy levels compared to BTPS-4Cl. Also, both BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl have a helical backbone with a small dihedral angle (BTPS-4F: 14.8°, BTPS-4Cl: 15.0°) between the two flanks of the molecules. They are desirable factors that imply that BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl can exhibit optimal intermolecular packing. Moreover, the FMOs spread across the entire molecule, implying good conjugation across the entire π framework, facilitating charge transport within and across molecules.

To investigate the optical properties of BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl, UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy was employed to study the SMAs in dilute chloroform solutions and film states (Fig. 3a and b and Table 1). The absorption of BTPS-4F peaked at 727 nm, with a maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.15 × 105 M−1 cm−1, whereas that of BTPS-4Cl peaked at 736 nm, with an εmax of 1.37 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Thus, BTPS-4Cl exhibits a stronger and redshifted absorption compared to BTPS-4F, which is consistent with the higher polarizability of chlorine atoms and the smaller calculated bandgap of BTPS-4Cl. In film states, both BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl exhibit bathochromic absorptions relative to their absorptions in chloroform solutions with absorption onsets at 896 and 913 nm respectively, corresponding to bandgaps of 1.38 and 1.36 eV, which agree with their calculated band gaps and absorption onsets in solutions. As a result, the absorptions of both blends satisfactorily cover the solar spectrum from 300 to 900 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3c) was employed to investigate the effect of different end groups on energy levels. The LUMO and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the species in the film state were estimated from the onset reduction and oxidation potentials using ferrocene/ferrocenium (−4.8 eV) (FeCp2/FeCp2+) as an external standard and are plotted in Fig. 3d. The LUMO of BTPS-4F (−3.91 eV) is slightly higher than that of BTPS-4Cl (−3.93 eV). It matches well with the slightly higher VOC of BTPS-4F based devices (Table 2). The LUMO levels of the SMAs are also very close to those of the electron transport layer, PNDIT-F3N, hence promoting efficient charge collection.43,44

The photovoltaic properties of PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl were then investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:SMA/PNDIT-F3N/Ag and the photovoltaic parameters of the respective devices are summarized in Table 2. The higher shunt resistance Rshunt (73.49 kΩ cm2vs. 68.89 kΩ cm2) and lower series resistance Rseries (0.50 Ω cm2vs. 1.25 Ω cm2) of BPTS-4F-based devices matched their better photovoltaic performance (Fig. S2 and S3†).45,46 Compared with Y6-based-devices when they were first reported, BTPS-4F-based ones achieved a better PCE and similar performance parameters. Considering that the LUMO of BTPS-4F is higher than that of Y6, we believe there is still margin for improvement in the VOC of BTPS-4F-based devices. Therefore, with further optimizations of molecular design and device fabrication, BTPS-4F and other alkylthio-containing NFAs have the potential to be another exemplary class of NFAs.
BTPS-4F-based devices achieved a slightly higher VOC than BTPS-4Cl-based ones, which is consistent with the CV results. Due to the nearly identical bandgaps of the two SMAs, the higher VOC of BTPS-4F-based devices indicates a smaller Vloss (Vloss = Eg/q – VOC) than that of BTPS-4Cl-based devices (0.53 V vs. 0.55 V).47 Both materials exhibit satisfactory quenching efficiencies (BTPS-4F: 87.8% (785 nm excitation), 86.5% (514 nm excitation); BTPS-4Cl: 90.3% (785 nm excitation), 77.8% (514 nm excitation)) in photoluminescence (PL) experiments (Fig. S4 and Table S1†), implying efficient exciton dissociation in both blends. The integrated JSC values from EQE measurements are 24.56 mA cm−2 and 23.51 mA cm−2 respectively, which match the values found in J–V characteristics (Fig. 4a). The EQE plots (Fig. 4b) reveal that both devices harvest photons efficiently in a broad absorption range. Furthermore, the higher JSC of BTPS-4F-based devices is mainly due to the enhanced light harvesting response from about 700 to 850 nm. It is interesting to note that the UV-vis absorption of PM6:BTPS-4F is lower in the range of 700 to 850 nm but the blend yields a better EQE in the same region than PM6:BTPS-4Cl does. The better SMA packing in BTPS-4F blend films is proposed to be the reason for the higher EQE despite their weaker absorption intensity. A discussion on film morphologies will be covered in later sections to support this point.

Charge recombination was studied with light-intensity-dependent experiments. The J–V characteristics of the devices under varying light intensity are provided in Fig. S5.† Both devices were found to follow the typical relationship, JSC ∝ Pα (where P is the light intensity and α is the recombination index, Fig. 4c). The α values are 0.89 and 0.87 for BTPS-4F- and BTPS-4Cl-based devices respectively. The slopes of VOCversus P (Fig. 4d) are 1.15 and 1.10kBT/q for BTPS-4F-based and BTPS-4Cl-based devices, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is room temperature (298 K) and q is the elementary charge. The light-intensity dependent experiments indicate that recombination in both materials is sufficiently suppressed, resulting in satisfactory FFs for both BTPS-4F-based and BTPS-4Cl-based devices. The charge dissociation behaviors of the respective devices were further studied by plotting photocurrent density (Jph) against effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4e). Jph equates the difference between current density under illumination (JL) and under dark conditions (JD). Veff is defined to be V − V0, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0. Dissociation probability (P(E,T)) can then be estimated by dividing JSC values at short circuit and at maximum power by saturation photocurrent density (Jsat). BTPS-4F-based devices were found to exhibit higher dissociation probabilities at short circuit (JSC/Jsat) (97.5% vs. 96.5%) and at maximum power (JMP/Jsat) (89.2% vs. 88.8%) than BTPS-4Cl-based ones, indicating that BTPS-4F-based devices collect charges from excitons more effectively, hence resulting in a higher JSC. Further studies on the photogeneration profile and recombination dynamics of PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl may be needed to provide more insights into the absorption and recombination behaviors at different wavelengths to explain the difference in the EQE of the respective materials more thoroughly.
The space-charge-limited-carrier method was employed to study the carrier mobilities of PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl blends (Fig. S6†). In the drift regime, J1/2 directly varies with applied voltage (Mott–Gurney law) and hence respective carrier mobilities can be extracted. The μh and μe of PM6:BTPS-4F blends are both higher than those of PM6:BTPS-4Cl blends (Table 2). Besides, the mobility ratio (μh/μe) of PM6:BTPS-4F (0.57) is closer to unity than that of PM6:BTPS-4Cl (0.54). The enhanced charge carrier mobilities and a more balanced mobility ratio of PM6:BTPS-4F are beneficial to charge transport, resulting in an improved JSC and a higher FF in BTPS-4F-based devices. Moreover, the more balanced mobilities in BTPS-4F-based devices may have contributed to the slightly larger α value.48,49
Various characterization techniques were then employed to study the molecular ordering and film morphology. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed on the pure and blend films to investigate the molecular packing of the respective materials (Fig. 5).50 Both blends were found to adopt a dominant face-on molecular orientation with respect to the substrate, indicated by the strong (010) π–π stacking peaks in the 2-D patterns and the significant (100) peaks of the out-of-plane linecuts. Therefore, π–π interactions between molecules can effectively contribute to the charge transport, leading to the satisfactory mobilities of both blends. The π–π spacings of BTPS-4F in pure films and blend films are 3.51 Å and 3.55 Å, respectively, both of which are smaller than those of BTPS-4Cl (3.53 Å and 3.58 Å for pure and blend films). Besides, the small π–π coherence lengths (CLs) of PM6:BTPS-4F (25.5 nm) and PM6:BTPS-4Cl (24.5 nm) are beneficial to charge transport. Consequently, the π–π stacking in PM6:BTPS-4F is noticeably more compact and ordered, in agreement with its superior carrier mobilities and JSC.51

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was employed to probe the nanoscale phase segregations of PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl films.52–54 The Lorentz-corrected R-SoXS profiles of PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl films acquired at 283.8 eV are shown in Fig. 6. The long periods of PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl are 62.8 nm and 89.8 nm respectively. A long period longer than the optimal diffusion length impairs exciton dissociation, since excitons may recombine before reaching the donor–acceptor interface or dispersed acceptor molecules.55,56 Therefore, PM6:BTPS-4F exhibits higher exciton dissociation probabilities than PM6:BTPS-4Cl does, as also supported by the Jph–Veff plots (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the relative composition variations, monotonically related to the domain purity of the polymer-rich domains, were estimated to be 1.00 and 0.88 for PM6:BTPS-4F and PM6:BTPS-4Cl respectively.57,58 This indicates that phase mixing is more uniform in PM6:BTPS-4F, which is consistent with the trends observed in RRMS and long periods. Since a higher domain purity is crucial in suppressing recombination, the R-SoXS results agree well with the superior EQE response and FF of BTPS-4F-based devices.59,60 In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S7†) reveals that the surface roughness of both blends was small, indicating appropriate mixing between PM6 and the NFAs. Thus, the morphology measurements may explain why BTPS-4F-based devices achieve superior overall performance.

Conclusions
In this study, BTPS-4F and BTPS-4Cl, which are the first NFAs designed via attaching alkylthio chains to a Y6 structure, were investigated. The incorporation of undecylthio chains is shown to be a feasible strategy in fine-tuning NFAs. Despite showing a relatively lower absorption from 700 to 850 nm, the enhanced packing of PM6:BTPS-4F enabled its devices to perform better than BTPS-4Cl-based devices did, as supported by GIWAXS and R-SoXS studies. As a result, BTPS-4F-based devices achieved a high performance, with a PCE of up to 16.2%, whereas devices based on BTPS-4Cl achieved a PCE of 13.5%. This study demonstrates for the first time the effect of alkylthio side chains on fine-tuning Y6-like acceptor molecules by manipulating the energy levels and morphology, which would provide important guidelines for further studies on exciton dynamics and development of high-performance non-fullerene OSCs.
