    , Accepted 28th September 2022First published on 29th September 2022AbstractWith the innovation of new materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) have been boosted to over 17%. However, most of them are processed with toxic halogenated solvents instead of non-halogenated solvents, which mainly stems from the difficulty of implementing a favorable active layer morphology via the latter. Here, we report a donor polymer named JD40-BDD20 by using a random copolymerization strategy for non-halogenated solvent-processed all-PSCs.

Consequently, a favorable morphology with a suitable domain size was achieved for a JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device processed with o-xylene (o-XY), contributing to improved exciton dissociation, balanced charge transport, enhanced charge extraction, and decreased charge recombination and energy loss (ΔEloss). Eventually, a prominent efficiency of 16.35% was achieved for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device, which was processed without annealing. In particular, when choosing PA-5 as an acceptor, the PCE was boosted to 17.21%. This work confirms that random copolymerization can be a very useful strategy by which to synchronously regulate the solubility and crystallinity of the polymer. It also demonstrates that JD40-BDD20 is promising to become the “workhorse” donor for the field of all-PSCs, and provides a promising avenue by which to achieve an optimal domain size in all-PSCs processed using non-halogenated solvent.

Broader context
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which use polymers as both donor and acceptor, have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for practical applications due to their notable merits of thermal and mechanical stabilities. From the perspective of practical applications, obtaining a remarkable photovoltaic performance using eco-friendly solvents is of great importance. Nevertheless, most high-performance all-PSCs are processed with toxic halogenated solvents instead of non-halogenated solvents, which mainly stems from the difficulty of implementing a favorable active layer morphology with an optimal domain size via the latter due to their limited solubility. Here, we report a donor polymer named JD40-BDD20 by using a random copolymerization strategy for non-halogenated solvent-processed all-PSCs. The incorporation of the BDD unit endows the JD40-BDD20 with improved solubility, suitable pre-aggregation and crystallinity, and superior miscibility with PJTVT. Consequently, a favorable morphology with an optimal domain size is achieved for a device processed with o-xylene and without annealing, leading to a prominent efficiency of 16.35%. In particular, when choosing PA-5 as an acceptor, the PCE of the all-PSC was boosted to 17.21%. This work demonstrates that using a random copolymerization strategy is a potential avenue by which to achieve an optimal domain size in all-PSCs processed with non-halogenated solvent.

1. Introduction
Over the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn considerable attention due to their unique merits of being lightweight, color-tunable, flexible, and manufactured using low-cost printing techniques.1–5 Among the various PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of a polymer donor (PD) and polymer acceptor (PA), have been considered to be one of the most promising candidates for industrialization owing to their notable merits of superior thermal and mechanical stabilities.6–11 In 2017, Li et al. reported a facile strategy of polymerizing fused-ring small molecular acceptors (SMAs) to construct a novel PA.12 The polymerized SMAs (PSMAs) preserve the attractive merits of SMAs and PA synchronously, including strong absorption, tunable energy levels, good charge transport, and film-forming properties, as well as morphological stability, etc.10,13–15 Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSMA-based all-PSCs has been boosted to over 17%,7,16 significantly narrowing the efficiency gap with SMAs systems.
It is worth noting that what most of the high-performance all-PSCs have in common is that they exhibit a suitable morphology.16–21 Generally, an ideal active layer morphology is deemed to be a bi-continuous interpenetrating network with large donor/acceptor (D/A) interfacial areas and approximated 10–20 nm domain size that is comparable to the exciton diffusion length (LD).22,23 Despite the LD for Y6-based NFAs (∼40 nm) being large, those of state-of-the-art donors, such as PTQ10, PM6, PM7, and D18, are still around 20 nm,24 limiting the domain size of the blend film. Notably, in comparison with SMA systems, it is more challenging to achieve such a small domain size for all-PSCs because the mixing of two macromolecular species plays a small role in the entropic contribution.25 Following the Lifshitz–Slyozov law, which states that the domain size is in direct proportion to the time of film formation,26 processing with highly volatile solvents is an effective strategy by which to reduce domain size. Indeed, most of the state-of-the-art all-PSCs are extensively processed with low-boiling point halogenated solvents, such as chloroform (CF).16–18,27 Nevertheless, to meet the demands of industrial fabrication, halogenated solvents with toxicity are not the optimal choice.28 Inversely, non-halogenated solvents are relatively eco-friendly but usually poor solvents for conjugated polymers.29–33 Limited solubility induces inferior solvent-polymer affinity, meaning that polymers are prone to interacting with themselves instead of solvent molecules, leading to the formation of aggregates,34–36 which does not promote a small domain size, thereby resulting in an inferior PCE. Thus, it is crucial and imperative to develop high-performance polymer materials with excellent solubility for non-halogenated solvent processible all-PSCs. Random copolymerization is a feasible approach by which to synchronously regulate the solubility and crystallinity of polymers,29,37–39 which makes it possible to achieve an optimal domain size for all-PSCs processed with non-halogenated solvent.38,40
In our previous work, we fabricated JD40:PJTVT-based all-PSCs with a small domain size using CF as a processing solvent, achieving a high performance of over 16%.17 But due to the limited solubility, it is difficult to process JD40 in non-halogenated solvents and acquire a desirable PCE. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel terpolymer JD40-BDD20 by introducing a 1,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-alkyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) block as the third unit into the skeleton of JD40. As expected, it enhances the solubility of JD40 in non-halogenated solvents (e.g. o-xylene, o-XY) and reduces the crystallinity, which contributes to weakening the excessive pre-aggregation in the solution. Besides this, JD40-BDD20 possesses better miscibility with PJTVT than JD40. Thus, the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device processed from o-XY offers a more favorable morphology with a smaller domain size that is comparable to the LD, contributing to improved exciton dissociation, balanced charge transport, enhanced charge extraction, and decreased charge recombination and energy loss (ΔEloss). Eventually, all the device parameters of the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device processed without annealing were greatly boosted with respect to those of JD40:PJTVT, leading to a superior efficiency of 16.35%. Interestingly, JD40-BDD20 can also be well matched with PA-5,41 boosting the PCE to 17.21%. Our results demonstrate that JD40-BDD20 is a potential PD for high-performance all-PSCs, providing a promising avenue by which to obtain an optimal domain size for all-PSCs processed using non-halogenated solvent.
2. Results and discussion
The random terpolymer JD40-BDD20 was synthesized by adding the BDD unit as the third electron-accepting unit into the JD40 copolymer matrix via typical Stille coupling polymerization, and the structures of PD and PA are displayed in Fig. 1a. The key synthetic routes for the relevant materials are illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The corresponding characterization, such as 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, high-temperature gel permeation chromatography, and elemental analysis are given in Fig. S1–S8 (ESI†). The 20% BDD monomer was used for ternary polymerization by synergistically considering the processability in non-halogenated solvent and good electronic properties. As shown in Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†), the 1H NMR of the key monomers (DBrDThfDTBT and DBrDThBDD), JD40, and JD40-BDD20 were carefully characterized. For JD40-BDD20, the integrals of the peaks at δ = 7.29 ppm and 7.20 ppm that respectively correlate to BDT-DThBDD and BDT-DThfDTBT framework are proportional (1:4). The peaks at δ = 3.37–3.33 ppm derived from the side-chain methylene of the DThBDD unit is also proportional to the peak at δ = 2.83 ppm (side-chain methylene groups of DThfDTBT) (1:4) and peak at δ = 1.81–1.75 ppm (side-chain methenyl groups from BDT, BDD, and fDTBT units) (1:5). All these results solidly substantiate the 20% loading of the BDD unit. Besides this, the elemental analyses of JD40 and JD40-BDD20 further support the above results (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). Compared with JD40, JD40-BDD20 shows superior solubility/processability in commonly used solvents, including the non-halogenated o-XY solvent (Fig. S9 and Table S1, ESI†). The thermal properties of JD40-BDD20 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). JD40-BDD20 demonstrates good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 420 °C (Fig. S10a, ESI†) and no visible phase transition appeared in the DSC curves up to 320 °C (Fig. S10b, ESI†). As depicted in Fig. 1b, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of JD40-BDD20 calculated from cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S11, ESI†) are −3.27 eV and −5.28 eV, respectively. Both HOMO and LUMO offset between JD40-BDD20 and PJTVT are enough to provide a strong driving force for efficient charge transfer. The distinction between the measured electrochemical and optical bandgap mainly stems from the distinction between photo excitation and electrical activation process.42,43 Additionally, the differences between the electrochemical and optical bandgap differ for two donors, which may result from their different solid-state polarization energy.43,44

To investigate the effect that introducing the BDD unit has on the optical properties, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute o-XY solution and pure films were measured and are depicted in Fig. 1c, with the detailed data shown in Table S2 (ESI†). From the film to the solution state, there is almost no difference in the 0–0 transition peak position for JD40 (from 586 nm to 585 nm), but a slight blueshift can be observed for JD40-BDD20 (from 586 nm to 580 nm), implying that the stronger pre-aggregation of JD40 in the solution state can be weakened by the introduction of the BDD unit.39,45,46 To further analyze the pre-aggregation behavior of the PDs in solution, their variable-temperature UV-vis absorption spectra (from 25 to 100 °C) were measured in dilute o-XY. As displayed in Fig. 1d and e, both PDs exhibit temperature-dependent aggregation properties that contribute to forming an optimal blend morphology.39,47 As for JD40-BDD20, the 0–0 absorption peak apparently blueshifts from 580 nm to 550 nm when the temperature is increased from 25 to 100 °C, while only a 15 nm blueshift is observed for JD40, indicating that the aggregation of JD40-BDD20 is relatively weak and it can be more easily disaggregated.48
Whereafter, the viscosity of the PD solutions (4.5 mg mL−1) was also measured at 25 °C and 60 °C to verify the different extent of their pre-aggregation behavior.49 As depicted in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the typical shear-thinning characteristics are observed for both PD solutions. In comparison with JD40, JD40-BDD20 exhibits a slightly weaker shear-thinning phenomenon, which may stem from its more flexible backbone induced by random copolymerization.50 Of note is that from 25 °C to 60 °C, the viscosity of JD40-BDD20 at the same shear rate decreases dramatically by over an order of magnitude, providing additional support for its weaker aggregation properties that can be easily disaggregated by increasing the temperature of the solution. In contrast, upon an increase in temperature, only a slight decrease in viscosity can be observed for the JD40 solution across the whole range of shear rates. In particular, in the case of a shear rate of 15.85 s−1, the viscosity of JD40 is substantially unchanged with the temperature increases. All the above results indicate that JD40 shows stronger aggregation properties, which can be restrained effectively via the incorporation of the BDD unit into the backbone.
To gain molecular level insights into the two donors, density functional theory (DFT) simulations of JD40 and JD40-BDD20 models were performed. To simplify the calculations, the model with a BDT-DThfDTBT-BDT-DThBDD frame was employed for JD40-BDD20 and all the alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups for the two models. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the introduction of the DThBDD unit leads to a slightly reduced coplanarity for the JD40-BDD20 backbone, evidenced by a larger dihedral angle (15.28°) between the BDD unit and adjoined thiophene than that of the JD40 model (12.36°), which contributes to improved solubility. Molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) and ESP area distributions of the JD40 and JD40-BDD20 molecular models are displayed in Fig. S14 (ESI†) and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). After quantifying the total average ESPs of the JD40, JD40-BDD20, and PJTVT models, we found that JD40-BDD20 has a relatively larger average ESP than the JD40 model, which is conducive to charge generation.51 Moreover, the differences in the total average ESP values between JD40-BDD20 and PJTVT are larger than for JD40 and PJTVT, implying stronger molecular interaction, which helps to improve miscibility between JD40-BDD20 and PJTVT.52
To elucidate the effect of the incorporation of the BDD unit into the backbone of JD40 on the photovoltaic performance, all-PSCs with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PD:PJTVT/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag were prepared using o-XY. The detailed optimization processes of the device, such as the D/A weight ratio, additives, and the annealing temperature, are shown in Tables S4–S7 (ESI†). Fig. 2a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the PDs:PJTVT devices under optimal processing conditions and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The all-PSC based on JD40:PJTVT shows a moderate PCE of 14.05%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.72 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.79%. Upon modification of JD40 using a random copolymerization strategy, the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device processed without annealing exhibits significantly improved JSC (23.88 mA cm−2) and FF (75.54%) values, as well as an elevated VOC (0.91 V) value compared with those of the JD40:PJTVT device, leading to a superior PCE of 16.35% (Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured and are presented in Fig. 2c and Table 1, in which the Jsc values integrated from the EQE data are in fairly good agreement with the those of the J–V measurements. Besides this, the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device demonstrates a higher EQE value than the JD40:PJTVT device across almost the entire photo-response range, indicating enhanced photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, in turn leading to a higher JSC value.

To discuss the relationship between the materials structure and morphology and performance, the surface morphologies of the blend films were firstly investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), in which the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film displays a more uniform morphology with lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values than those of JD40:PJTVT (1.61 nm vs. 2.69 nm). Subsequently, to further observe a more pronounced difference in phase separation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to measure the domain size in the blend films. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, it can be observed that the JD40:PJTVT blend film displays a fairly large-scale phase separation size, while a more uniform and distinct bi-continuous network with a smaller phase separation scale for JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film was observed. The oversized phase separation reduces the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interface areas in the blend films, in turn, goes against exciton dissociation, which could mainly be responsible for the gap in performance between the JD40:PJTVT and JD40-BDD20:PJTVT devices.

(g) The combined image of (c) and (e) for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film. 
To more clearly investigate the effect that the BDD unit in the JD40 skeleton has on the morphological characteristics, the detailed D/A phase separation in the active layers was measured by photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM), as shown in Fig. 3. Combining the analytical capabilities of optical spectroscopy and the high spatial resolution provided by the AFM microscope, PiFM is capable of affording the comprehensive and direct compositional analysis of blend films by distinguishing the different components at the nanoscale.53,54 Firstly, we measured the PiFM infrared (IR) absorption spectra of the pure PD and PA films, as shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). From the IR spectra, the characteristic IR absorption wavenumbers of PD and PA were identified to be 1457 cm−1 and 1424 cm−1, respectively. Fig. 3b–e displays the PiFM images of the PD (green color) and PA (red color) in the blend films by probing their characteristic IR peak wavenumbers, and the combined images are shown in Fig. 3f and g. It can be seen that, in the JD40:PJTVT blend film, the PD and PA are excessively phase-separated with an overlarge domain size, which stems from the stronger aggregation of JD40. In contrast, as for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film, the superior miscibility between PD and PA with a smaller phase separation size can be observed. These results manifest that the excessive aggregation of JD40 can be efficiently restrained by introducing the BDD unit into the skeleton of JD40, sequentially, resulting in a reduced domain size of the blend film.
To account for the origin of domain size discrepancy from the perspective of materials, the surface tension (γ) of the materials was examined using contact angle measurements. The contact angle images of the neat JD40, JD40-BDD20, and PJTVT films are illustrated in Fig. S17 (ESI†), while the γ, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ), and other relevant parameters, are displayed in Table S8 (ESI†). The χD/A, a critical evaluation index for the miscibility between the donor and acceptor, can be acquired using the Flory–Huggins model.33,35 In general, a smaller χ value signifies high interfacial compatibility, whereas an overlarge one tends to indicate phase separation.33 As a consequence, a lower χ value of only 0.085 K is observed for JD40-BDD20:PJTVT than JD40:PJTVT (0.304 K). Such results demonstrate that the introduction of the BDD unit into JD40 improves the miscibility with PJTVT, contributing to a favorable phase separation morphology formed in the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend with an increasing density of D/A interfaces, which is consistent with the TEM, AFM and PiFM results.
To provide the in-depth effect of incorporating the BDD unit into the backbone on the phase segregation, grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were conducted.55 The 2D patterns and the in-plane direction intensity profiles of the two blend films are shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†) and Fig. 4a, respectively. The Debye–Anderson–Brumberger and the fractal-like network model were employed to fit the intensity profiles,55–57 while the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S9 (ESI†). The intermixing domain sizes (ξ) are slightly reduced from 36.4 nm to 35.3 nm after the introduction of the BDD unit, which may stem from the better miscibility between JD40-BDD20 and PJTVT. The relatively small ξ indicates a narrower amorphous region for a mixed donor and acceptor, which is expected to provide a substantially large D/A interface area, conducive to sufficient exciton dissociation.56 In addition, the overlarge average domain sizes (2Rg) of the donor phase were calculated to be 40.3 nm for the JD40:PJTVT blend film, but only 25.3 nm for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film, indicating that the excessively high crystallinity of JD40 can be effectively restrained after incorporating the BDD unit into the backbone.

(b) Pole figure of the (100) peak for pure JD40 and the JD40-BDD20 film. (c) 2D GIWAXS patterns of the JD40:PJTVT and JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend films. (d) Scattering profiles of IP and OOP for JD40:PJTVT and the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film. 
To further probe how the introduction of the BDD copolymerization unit induces favorable phase separation from a molecular stacking viewpoint, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted to determine the crystalline properties of the relevant films at the nanoscale.36,58 The obtained two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and line-cut profiles of the relevant films are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. S19 (ESI†). The JD40 pure film shows a pronounced (010) diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction and (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, manifesting a distinct edge-on orientation for JD40. Additionally, JD40-BDD20 shows bimodal orientation because the pronounced (010) and (100) diffraction peaks are simultaneously observed in the OOP and IP directions of the JD40-BDD20 pure film. Moreover, a pole figure of the (100) lamellar crystalline peak was constructed by extracting the integrated intensity as a function of the azimuth angles ψ along the arcs to quantify the impact of the introduction of the BDD unit on molecular orientation, where ψ is the angle of the q vector with respect to the surface normal.17,58 The ranges of 0°–45° and 45°–90° are defined as edge-on and face-on orientations, respectively. As plotted in Fig. 4b, with the introduction of the BDD unit, the integral area ratio of 45–90° increases significantly. The above results demonstrate that JD40 shows a more distinct edge-on orientation, which can be attributed to the strong interactions of its polymer chains that can avoid interacting with the substrate surface.59,60 It should be noted that the incorporation of the BDD unit can weaken such strong interactions, in turn increasing the ratio of face-on orientation.
More remarkably, the GIWAXS data of the (010) π–π stacking peaks and (100) lamellar stacking peaks were fitted and are shown in Fig. S20, S21 (ESI†) and Tables S10, S11 (ESI†). For the pure JD40 film, in which edge-on is the dominant orientation, the IP(010) and OOP(100) crystal coherence length (CCL) estimated using the Scherrer equation are 43.34 Å and 89.25 Å, respectively. In contrast to JD40, smaller CCLs (24 Å and 70.64 Å) were calculated for JD40-BDD20 at OOP (010) and IP (100), indicating the weakened crystallinity of PD upon the incorporation of the BDD unit. After blending with PJTVT, as shown in Fig. 4c and d, both blend films show predominant face-on orientation with a sharp OOP (010) diffraction peak and IP (100) diffraction peak. Besides this, the JD40:PJTVT blend film exhibits a larger OOP (010) CCL (33.55 Å vs. 26.16 Å) and IP (100) CCL (137.25 Å vs. 80.74 Å) than the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT system, indicative of the excessively high crystallinity of the JD40:PJTVT blend film, which tends to form a large domain and leads to poor device efficiency.
As discussed above, the incorporation of the BDD unit suppresses the high crystallinity of JD40, contributing to obtaining an optimal blend morphology with reduced phase separation size and improved D/A interfacial area, which, in turn, is likely to optimize photo-physical processes.61 Initially, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was employed to illustrate the exciton and charge dynamics of the two blend films. As displayed in Fig. 5a, exciting the donor at 580 nm, the PL emission is quenched by 99.48% for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film, which is higher than that of the JD40:PJTVT blend film (97.52%). Upon exciting the acceptor at 750 nm (Fig. 5b), the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film also achieved relatively high PL quenching efficiency relative to the JD40:PJTVT blend film (91.61% vs. 90.87%). Overall, our PL results demonstrate that the incorporation of the BDD unit enables more close D/A interface contact in the blend film, which is conducive to charge separation and transport,33,62 leading to an improved JSC value.

To gain further insight into the effect of the terpolymer on exciton dissociation and carrier generation, as plotted in Fig. S22a (ESI†), the correlation between the photogenerated current density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff) was investigated.63Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are respectively the light and dark current densities. The dependent variable Veff is determined from the value of V0 − Va, where V0 refers to the voltage when Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage. The exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) can be defined by the specific value between the Jph value under short-circuit conditions and Jsat (Jph under saturation conditions). In comparison with the JD40:PJTVT device (22.71 mA cm−2), a higher Jsat value of 24.30 mA cm−2 was observed for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device, at Veff > 1 V, illustrating that more charge was generated. Notably, the calculated P(E,T) increased from 92.2% to 97.0% upon the incorporation of the BDD unit into JD40, showing more efficient exciton dissociation that contributes to enhancing the JSC value. This trend is in agreement with the PL quenching results, which can be attributed to the ameliorative phase separation morphology of the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend film.
To elucidate the charge recombination dynamics of the devices, the JSC and VOC values as a function of light intensity (Plight) were investigated.64 The correlation between VOC and Plight follows the equation VOC ∝ n(KT/q)lnPlight, where k, q, and T refer to the Boltzmann constant, elementary charge, and Kelvin temperature. As depicted in Fig. S22b (ESI†), the n value declines from 1.51 to 1.19 upon the incorporation of the BDD unit into JD40, revealing that much less trap-assisted recombination occurred in the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device. Subsequently, the relationship between light intensity and JSC can be expressed using the power function relation of JSC ∝ Pαlight, in which the power-law exponential factor α is an indicator for detecting the degree of bimolecular recombination. As extracted from the linear fitted line in Fig. S22c (ESI†), both devices exhibit a slope value, a, approaching 1, indicating that bimolecular recombination can be suppressed effectively.
To further illustrate the impact of introducing the BDD unit on charge recombination, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were conducted.65 As shown in Fig. S23 (ESI†), the TPV decay dynamics of the blend films can be used to extract the carrier lifetimes (τ) under open-circuit conditions. A longer τ was observed for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device across the entire light intensity range investigated, which is indicative of more suppressed carrier recombination. To carry out more comprehensive analysis, in addition to τ values, the corresponding carrier densities (n) can also be estimated using charge-extraction (CE) measurements performed at various illumination intensities in parallel.65 Fig. S23 (ESI†) delineates that the n values vary with the light intensity, and the relationship between τ and n is depicted in Fig. 5c. In comparison with the JD40:PJTVT device, higher n values are obtained across the light intensity range for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device, which is in agreement with the enhancement in the JSC value. The higher n values are likely to stem from the ameliorative exciton dissociation that occurs in the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device. Subsequently, the nongeminate recombination rate constants, krec, were calculated via the equation krec = 1/(λ + 1)nτ to distinguish the extent of nongeminate recombination, where λ is the recombination order extracted from Fig. 5c. From the plot of krecversus n depicted in Fig. 5d, it is found that a substantially lower krec value was obtained for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device rather than the JD40:PJTVT device among all the applied light intensities. Overall, the above results demonstrate that weaker nongeminate recombination can be achieved for the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend with the incorporation of the BDD unit, which is conducive to improving the FF.
The charge transport properties were evaluated via the voltage-dependent space charge limited current (SCLC) model in hole-only and electron-only devices (Fig. S24, ESI†).66 As listed in Table S2 (ESI†), high hole mobilities (μh) of 3.02 × 10−3 and 2.31 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 S−1 were individually calculated for pure JD40 and JD40-BDD20. Besides this, as depicted in Fig. 5e, both blend devices manifest superior μh and μe values with 10−3 and 10−4 cm−2 V−1 S−1 as the order of magnitudes, respectively. For the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend, a slightly inferior μh value of 1.28 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 S−1 but a superior μe value of 9.18 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 S−1 was obtained in comparison with those of the JD40:PJTVT blend (2.30 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 S−1 and 7.81 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 S−1). Of note is that the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device displays a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.39 than that of the JD40:PJTVT device (2.94), demonstrating more effective charge transport, thus facilitating charge extraction and collection in the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device. To further figure out the charge extraction process, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were conducted.67 As plotted in Fig. 5f, a faster charge extraction time (Tex) can be observed for JD40-BDD20:PJTVT devices compared with JD40:PJTVT devices (0.67 μs vs. 1.37 μs), which may be attributed to a more balanced charge transport process and weaker trap recombination losses. Relative to the JD40:PJTVT device, the almost twice faster charge extraction rate of the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device is possibly one of the critical factors that enhances the JSC and FF values.36,68,69
To reveal the cause of the distinct VOC values for the two all-PSCs, we measured the ΔEloss by recording Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra. Generally, the ΔEloss is split into three terms: radiative recombination loss (1) above the bandgap (ΔE1) and (2) below the bandgap (ΔE2); (3) nonradiative recombination loss (ΔE3), which can be estimated from ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL).70,71 The EL and FTPS-EQE spectra of the JD40:PJTVT and JD40-BDD20:PJTVT devices are shown in Fig. 5g and h, respectively, and each calculated loss term is listed in Fig. 5i and Table S12 (ESI†). Both all-PSCs show comparable ΔE1 (0.28 eV) and ΔE2 (0.05 eV) values. However, the ΔE3 value observed in the JD40:PJTVT device is higher than that of the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device (0.26 eV vs. 0.23 eV), which is most likely associated with the excessive aggregation of JD40.72 The excessive aggregation induces severe phase separation morphology with an overlarge domain size that exceeds the LD, which may lead to higher nonradiative charge recombination.73 In other words, the incorporation of the BDD unit restrains the aggregation of PD and reduces the domain size, which contributes to lower ΔE3 and higher VOC values of all-PSCs.
Overall, the behavior of the excitons and carriers in the two different blend morphologies are schematically shown in Fig. 6a and b. The incorporation of the BDD unit can effectively restrain the excessive aggregation of JD40 and enhance the miscibility with PJTVT, improving phase separation morphology with a small domain size that is closer to LD. This contributes to more efficient exciton dissociation, which is in good agreement with the elevated PL quenching and P(E,T) (Fig. 6c). Besides this, more balanced mobility is obtained after introducing the BDD unit, thus facilitating the charge extraction with a twice faster rate (0.67 μs vs. 1.37 μs), which is one of the critical factors for a high JSC value. In addition to more effective exciton dissociation and charge transport and extraction, reduced charge recombination is also achieved in the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device. Generally, the FF is deemed to be related to the charge recombination and extraction process in the device. Koster et al. quantified the relationship between the FF and the ratio of recombination rate/extraction rate (krec/kex) via simulations and experiments, finding that a lower krec/kex value tends to result in a higher FF.74 Here, the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device not only possesses a bigger kex value inferred from the CE and TPC measurements, but also a lower krec value, both of which synergistically lead to a lower krec/kex value, being ultimately embodied in the obtained enhancement of FF. Moreover, faster charge recombination results in reduced quasi–Fermi level splitting, thus resulting in a larger ΔEloss, which is consistent with a smaller VOC value for the JD40:PJTVT device.75

(f) The corresponding EQE curves of JD40:PA-5 and JD40-BDD20:PA-5 all-PSCs. 
Interestingly, this random terpolymer JD40-BDD20 possesses the potential to match well with other high-performance PSMAs and achieve an outstanding PCE. For example, we selected PA-5 (Fig. 6d)41 as an acceptor to match with our PDs and manufactured relevant all-PSCs with the same optimum conditions described above. Likewise, as shown in Fig. 6e and Table S13 (ESI†), the JD40:PA-5 device processed with o-XY shows a moderate PCE of 14.37%, with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 23.36 mA cm−2, and an FF of 72.87%, which are lower than those of processed using CF.41 In contrast, the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 device exhibits significantly improved JSC (25.23 mA cm−2), FF (77.11%), and VOC (0.88 V) values, resulting in a high PCE of 17.21%. In addition, as depicted in Fig. 6f, the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 device shows a higher EQE response than that of the JD40:PA-5 device, which is in good agreement with the trend in the above PJTVT-based devices. Similarly, JD40-BDD20:PA-5 shows better miscibility than JD40:PA-5 (Fig. S25 and Table S14, ESI†). Compared with the JD40:PA-5 blend film, the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 blend film displays a smaller RMS roughness value (Fig. S26, ESI†) and domain size (Figs. S27–S29, ESI†), which can be attributed to weaker aggregation of JD40-BDD20 and better miscibility with PA-5. It can be also seen that the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 blend film possesses smaller CCLs, ξ and 2Rg, calculated from GIWAXS and GISAXS (Fig. S30, S31 and Tables S15, S16, ESI†). Overall, an improved morphology can be observed in the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 blend film in comparison with the JD40:PA-5 blend film, in good agreement with the trend observed for the PJTVT system. Consequently, a higher PL quenching efficiency and P(E,T), more balanced charge mobility, and lower ΔE3 are achieved for the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 device (Fig. S32–S35 and Tables S17, S18, ESI†), leading to an outstanding PCE. Moreover, in comparison with the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT device, the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 device shows a higher PCE, which mainly stems from the enhanced JSC and slightly higher FF values. On the one hand, the PA-5 acceptor reveals better miscibility with JD40-BDD20, contributing to further fine-tuning blend morphology and achieving a more uniform film with a smaller RMS roughness value and domain size, which is in accordance with the PiFM and TEM results. Besides this, slightly smaller CCLs are achieved for the JD40-BDD20:PA-5 blend film, indicative of slightly weaker crystallinity, which conforms to the smaller domain, enhanced PL quenching efficiency and P(E,T), and contributes to improved JSC and FF values. On the other hand, the PA-5 acceptor shows distinctly red-shifted absorption and an increased maximum extinction coefficient in comparison with PJTVT (Fig. S36, ESI†), further conducive to enhancing the JSC value.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, a new random terpolymer donor JD40-BDD20 has been developed for high-performance all-PSCs. With the insertion of the BDD unit, the solubility and crystallinity can be fine-tuned to restrain the excessive aggregation of JD40. In addition to that, the enhanced miscibility with PJTVT is obtained. Thus, the JD40-BDD20:PJTVT blend enables a favorable morphology of reasonable polymer domains, which is conducive to promoting exciton dissociation, balancing charge transport, enhancing charge extraction, and decreasing charge recombination and ΔEloss, thereby, contributing to higher JSC, FF, and VOC values. As a result, even without a thermal annealing procedure, a high PCE of 16.35% is achieved for JD40-BDD20:PJTVT processed using non-halogenated solvents. It is also worth mentioning that JD40-BDD20 exhibits excellent potential to match with other PAs and be used to construct high-performance all-PSCs. When selecting PA-5 as an acceptor to match with JD40-BDD20, the PCE of all-PSCs is further boosted to 17.21%. This work demonstrates that JD40-BDD20 holds promise to become the “workhorse” donor for the field of all-PSCs and provides a fruitful avenue by which to achieve a favorable active layer with an optimal domain size in all-PSCs processed using non-halogenated solvent.

Broader context
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which use polymers as both donor and acceptor, have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for practical applications due to their notable merits of thermal and mechanical stabilities. From the perspective of practical applications, obtaining a remarkable photovoltaic performance using eco-friendly solvents is of great importance. Nevertheless, most high-performance all-PSCs are processed with toxic halogenated solvents instead of non-halogenated solvents, which mainly stems from the difficulty of implementing a favorable active layer morphology with an optimal domain size via the latter due to their limited solubility. Here, we report a donor polymer named JD40-BDD20 by using a random copolymerization strategy for non-halogenated solvent-processed all-PSCs. The incorporation of the BDD unit endows the JD40-BDD20 with improved solubility, suitable pre-aggregation and crystallinity, and superior miscibility with PJTVT. Consequently, a favorable morphology with an optimal domain size is achieved for a device processed with o-xylene and without annealing, leading to a prominent efficiency of 16.35%. In particular, when choosing PA-5 as an acceptor, the PCE of the all-PSC was boosted to 17.21%. This work demonstrates that using a random copolymerization strategy is a potential avenue by which to achieve an optimal domain size in all-PSCs processed with non-halogenated solvent.
