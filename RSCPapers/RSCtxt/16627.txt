    , Accepted 22nd March 2013First published on 22nd March 2013AbstractA simple aqueous solution route has been used to prepare mercaptoacetic acid attached CuInS2 quantum dots. Based on this material, core–shell CuInS2–Mn doped CdS quantum dot sensitized solar cells are assembled and a power conversion efficiency of 5.38% is obtained under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination.
Solution-processed nanostructured quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QSCs) are currently attracting increasing scientific and technical interest as an emerging alternative for next generation photovoltaics due to their low cost, easy fabrication and the possibility of boosting the energy conversion efficiency beyond the traditional Shockley and Queisser limit.1–3 Notably, quantum dots (QDs) offer many advantages, such as tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, multiple exciton generation and extraction of hot electrons.4,5 To date, inorganic metal chalcogenide QDs, including CdS, CdSe, PbS, CdTe, Sb2S3 and CuInS2, have been widely investigated to optimize light absorption and facilitate charge transfer to wide bandgap semiconductors.6–12
Among various narrow bandgap semiconductors, CuInS2 (CIS) is known to be a non-toxic light absorbing material with a direct bandgap energy of 1.5 eV and high extinction coefficient, both of which make it a promising candidate as a sensitizer in QSCs. Early attempts on CIS based liquid junction QSCs showed a power conversion efficiency of less than 1%.13 The origin of such limited performance was ascribed to poor charge separation, slow hole scavenging and serious electron–hole recombination between CIS and electrolytes. After introducing the buffer layer and the passivation layer to suppress charge recombination at TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces, the efficiency of CIS-based QSCs were increased to 2.52%.14,15 Very recently, Teng's group reported pioneering work illustrating that the photoelectrochemical performance of sensitized TiO2 electrodes strongly depended on both the size of CIS QDs and the thickness of CdS coating.16 Based on the above research, this group has made a great breakthrough in the CIS QDs–CdS solar cell configuration with a power conversion efficiency of 4.2%. However, the CIS QDs used in this exciting work were synthesized by the solvothermal method which required at least three complicated and uneconomical steps including QD synthesis, ligand exchange and TiO2 surface modification to assemble the QDs on the TiO2 electrode.10
Compared with solvothermal synthesis, aqueous synthesis is simple and cost effective. We have previously synthesized mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) attached CIS QDs, which can directly self-assemble on TiO2 films in one step, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.47% was achieved for CIS QSCs with the CdS buffer layer and heat treatment.17 Meanwhile, synthesis of Mn doped CdS (Mn-CdS) has been proven to be a powerful strategy to extend the lifetime of charge carriers to boost the efficiency of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QSCs.18 To date, the application of Mn-CdS in the CIS–CdS QD system has not been reported.
In this work, an aqueous method has been developed for the first time to obtain MAA attached CIS QDs with CdCl2 pretreatment. For application in QSCs, we employ a self-assembly method to assemble the CIS QDs and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) to deposit CdS shell onto the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes in sequence. The core–shell CIS–CdS QD sensitized TiO2 electrode shows significantly enhanced light absorption. Under standard simulated AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination, the solar cell based on this core–shell CIS–CdS QD sensitized TiO2 electrode can present a power conversion efficiency of 4.69%. Most importantly, by exchanging CdS with the Mn-CdS shell, the cell performance of CIS–Mn-CdS QSCs has been further improved to a conversion efficiency of 5.38%, which is one of the best results for QSCs.
The CIS QDs were synthesized by a MAA assisted aqueous method developed by our group with slight modification (detailed experimental procedures for synthesis and characterization of CIS QDs are available in ESI†).17 Compared with standard XRD patterns, the patterns of CIS QDs treated with CdCl2 shift slightly to lower angles, indicating the incorporation of Cd into CIS QDs in combination with EDX results (Fig. S1, ESI†). With the aid of MAA with both carboxy and thiol groups to stabilize CIS QDs and to firmly bond to the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles and the CIS QDs, the TiO2 electrodes were directly immersed into colloidal CIS QD solution for 24 h to ensure maximized surface coverage. CdS coating was achieved by the SILAR method according to the procedure given in the literature.18 Briefly, the CIS QD modified TiO2 electrodes were first dipped into a methanol solution containing Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1 M) for 1 min, and then immersed into a Na2S·9H2O (0.1 M) water–methanol solution (1:1 by volume) for 1 min in sequence. The electrodes were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water to remove the excess precursor after each immersion. This procedure was repeated for 9 cycles to form core–shell CIS–CdS sensitized electrodes. A similar procedure was employed to obtain the Mn-CdS shell except a mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1 M) and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.075 M) as a cationic precursor. For comparison, CdS and Mn-CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 electrodes were also made. The actual Mn concentration in the CdS was determined to be 1.24% using ICP-AES. Meanwhile, various QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes exhibit distinguishable colors (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The optical properties of the QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes with different sensitizers were measured by UV-vis absorption spectra in the wavelength range from 350 to 850 nm (Fig. 1). From the spectra, it is evident that no distinct exciton peak is observed in the whole absorption spectrum for CIS QDs, which is consistent with that reported in previous work.16 Besides, its band edge is blue-shifted due to significant quantum confinement effects (the intrinsic bandgap of bulk CIS is 1.5 eV corresponding to a band edge of 850 nm). With subsequent SILAR growth of CdS or Mn-CdS coating on the CIS QDs, the light absorption intensities are greatly enhanced in the visible light region and the onset edges undergo a significant red shift. The absorption range for core–shell CIS–CdS and CIS–Mn-CdS QD sensitized electrodes extends up to 800 nm, much longer than those of single CIS, CdS or Mn-CdS QDs, indicating that the effective bandgaps of core–shell CIS–CdS and CIS–Mn-CdS QDs become narrow. Obviously, the broader light absorption ranges extending to 800 nm for CIS–CdS QDs and CIS–Mn-CdS QDs make them promising sensitizers in QSCs.

The QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes with a total thickness of 20 μm were applied as photoanodes for QSCs (detailed information on TiO2 films is provided in ESI†). All the QD-modified TiO2 photoanodes were further treated with ZnS for two cycles by alternately dipping into 0.2 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.2 M Na2S methanol solutions for 1 min to reduce the charge recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The sensitized TiO2 electrodes, CuS counter electrodes (detailed information on CuS electrodes is provided in ESI†) and the aqueous polysulfide redox electrolyte containing Na2S (2 M), S (2 M) and KCl (0.2 M) were assembled into sandwich type cells. 60 μm-thickness spacers were applied to separate the photoanode and the counter electrode. Photovoltaic performances of the various QD-sensitized solar cells were evaluated from photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 2(a)) under an AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2. And the relevant J–V parameters of photocurrent density (Jsc), photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and the overall power conversion efficiencies (η) for the CIS, CdS, Mn-CdS, CIS–CdS and CIS–Mn-CdS QSCs are summarized in Table 1.

For the CIS QDs based solar cells, the power conversion efficiency is very low (0.62%), which is ascribed to the limited light absorption of CIS QDs and serious recombination between CIS and polysulfide electrolyte. The efficiencies for the CdS and Mn-CdS sensitized cells are 1.45% and 2.11%, respectively. In comparison with CdS QSCs, Mn-CdS QSCs can show higher efficiency, mainly attributed to higher Jsc and Voc, which is consistent with the result reported in the literature.18 As can be seen from Table 1, it is apparent that both Jsc and Voc increase dramatically with the introduction of CdS shell. And a power efficiency of 4.69% is obtained for TiO2/CIS–CdS QD based solar cells, which is superior to that reported by Teng's group.10 Most importantly, the QSCs using core–shell CIS–Mn-CdS QDs as sensitizers exhibit the best performance with η of 5.38%, much higher than the sum of those of QSCs employing single CIS and Mn-CdS QDs alone. It is meaningful to note that the Mn-CdS shell is beneficial for further improving the performance of TiO2/CIS QSCs with enhanced Jsc and Voc. To understand the role of the Mn-CdS shell layer on the QSCs, incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are measured to investigate the origin of the enhanced Jsc in the assembled devices.19 As shown in Fig. 2(b), the IPCE characteristics of the cells are consistent with the light harvesting properties of QD-modified mesoporous TiO2 films. IPCE of over 60% between 350 and 650 nm is achieved for core–shell CIS–Mn-CdS QSCs, which display a stronger photoresponse in the long-wavelength region than core–shell CIS–CdS QSCs. The above experiments clearly indicate that the core–shell CIS–Mn-CdS QSCs have a superior ability to enhance light absorption and facilitating carrier extraction, which is responsible for formation of highly efficient QSCs. Meanwhile, because the TiO2 surface is not covered completely by CIS QDs, surface states and dangling bonds are significantly removed through the growth of the CdS and Mn-CdS shell materials, which also retard interfacial recombination losses of electrons.6 Moreover, the Jsc of CIS-based QSCs with CdS or Mn-CdS shells can be kept constant during continuous 1 hour illumination, indicating that the CIS–CdS based QSCs are primarily stable under the testing conditions (Fig. S4, ESI†).
To understand the physical processes underlying the broad light absorption and effective carrier extraction, a type II-like core–shell model is proposed to elucidate the possible charge transfer mechanism in the CIS–Mn-CdS QDs system based on the above experimental facts (Fig. 3). Due to the quantum confinement effect, the conduction band of CIS QDs will be significantly upward-shifted upon increasing the bandgap. The subsequent Mn-CdS coating would form a layered shell on the core of CIS QDs. With increasing SILAR cycles, the conduction band of Mn-CdS will decrease. Herein, unlike bulk CIS and Mn-CdS, a type II energy level alignment is formed.20 Comparative experiments demonstrate that Jsc increases continuously with the increase in Mn-CdS up to 9 SILAR cycles. Further deposition would decrease the overall power efficiency because the increased pore filling affects the electrolyte diffusion within the TiO2 film (not shown). The coupling of CIS with the Mn-CdS shell results in stronger wave function interfacial interaction which leads to spatially indirect energy gap with the significant red-shift of the absorption edge of this core–shell QDs. This unique feature enables the photogenerated electron–hole pairs to quickly separate into the conduction band of CdS and the valence band of CIS under irradiation.21 Subsequently, the electrons are transferred to the Mn 4T1 state. The midgap states created by Mn doping cause electrons to get trapped and screen them from charge recombination with holes and oxidized polysulfide electrolyte.17 Therefore, the spatial separation of electrons can be efficiently collected using an external circuit. Another key problem is the extraction of the holes. It appears that the holes are localized in CIS, leading to inefficient reaction with the external environment for oxidative reactions, which is detrimental in QSCs. Despite this, our work shows that the CIS core confined photoinduced holes can be efficiently extracted to the polysulfide electrolyte in CIS–Mn-CdS QSCs. In addition, recent studies had experimentally demonstrated that core-localized holes can be extracted by using hole-scavenging surfactants.22–24 Although we have already succeeded in fabricating relatively high efficiency QSCs, unambiguous understanding of electron injection and charge recombination kinetics in this type II system requires further systematic studies.

In conclusion, a simple aqueous method was developed to fabricate CIS QDs for QSCs. The solar cells based on core–shell CIS–CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes present a power efficiency of 4.69% under AM1.5 one sun illumination due to superior light absorption and faster electron extraction. Furthermore, CIS–Mn-CdS QSCs exhibit a power efficiency of 5.38%. Our work suggests that type II bandgap engineering in CIS–Mn-CdS systems provides an effective way to control their interfacial charge transfer properties. Furthermore, the proposed strategy opens a variety of possibilities for the rational design of other new types of core–shell sensitizers with improved light harvesting and efficient charge separation for solar energy conversion.
