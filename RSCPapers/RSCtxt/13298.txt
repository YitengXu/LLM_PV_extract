    , Accepted 26th November 2020First published on 26th November 2020AbstractChemical doping engineering is an effective strategy to modify the hole transport layer (HTL) and achieve high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we synthesize an infrequent trilacunary Keggin type polyoxometalate Na10[Zn2(H2O)6(WO2)2(BiW9O33)2] (BiW9-Zn) and apply it as an additive to enhance the hole mobility and electrical conductivity of Spiro-OMeTAD based HTLs. Thanks to the strong electron-accepting properties of polyoxometalate molecules, the as-synthesized BiW9-Zn can directly oxidize Spiro-OMeTAD under an inert atmosphere and avoid the tedious long-term oxidation process. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of optimal PSCs with BiW9-Zn doping is enhanced from 17.58% (without doping) to 19.56% with a significantly improved fill factor and open-circuit voltage. In addition, the assembly repeatability and long-term stability of PSCs are also improved. This work demonstrates the potential of using polyoxometalates (POMs) as low-cost, efficient and highly flexible chemical dopants for HTLs, and more importantly paves a new route to enhance the performance of PSCs.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are attracting tremendous attention as a promising candidate for solar-energy conversion, owing to their excellent properties including low-cost, favorable photon absorption and high charge mobility.1–3 Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has skyrocketed to a certified record efficiency of 25.5%.4 Although significant progress has been made in both the PCE of various devices and understanding of the underlying physics of the materials,5,6 there are many outstanding issues caused by low-quality films which still impede the commercialization of PSCs.7–9 As a result, research studies focusing on further improving the morphology and stability of each functional layer are being increasingly performed in the field.10–12
The hole transport layer (HTL) used for extracting holes from perovskites is one of the most important components for high-efficiency PSCs.13 Currently, 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis (N,N-p dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is being widely used as a commercialized HTL material due to its good morphological stability and suitable HOMO energy level. However, Spiro-OMeTAD molecules themselves suffer from poor intrinsic hole mobility and conductivity, as well as necessary oxidation processes.14,15 Therefore, lithium bis(trifluoromethysulfonyl) (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) are commonly used as additives to enhance the electrochemical performance of Spiro-OMeTAD based HTLs.7,16 However, both additives cannot directly oxidize Spiro-OMeTAD and their hygroscopic properties inevitably attract moisture from the ambient atmosphere, resulting in poor stability and low efficiency of PSCs. In an attempt to obtain more stable devices, chemical doping engineering has been performed for developing high-efficiency PSCs.17,18 In recent years, many chemical dopants, such as 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8,-tetracyano-quinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), carbon, carbon nanotubes, metal-based complexes, FeCl3, and CuI, have been reported as effective additives for the oxidation of Spiro-OMeTAD.19–21 Nevertheless, these dopants exhibit many inherent drawbacks, such as complex synthesis progress and high cost, which seriously restrict their further application.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a type of multi-metallic anionic nanocluster with a cage structure composed of heteroatoms and central atoms.22,23 Generally, strong photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities, as well as certain redox capabilities make POMs excellent candidates as chemical dopants. Besides, many works have reported that POMs also can improve the photoelectric properties of thin-film solar cells.24,25 In our previous work, POMs (Keggin type) could oxidize Spiro-OMeTAD due to its matched energy level. Owing to the improvement of transportation and inhibition of the recombination of carriers, the photoelectric property efficiency of PSCs has been effectively enhanced.26 Compared with conventional POMs, the lacunary Keggin type POMs are easily doped with transition metal elements and they maintain their structural characteristics. The transition metal elements were embedded in the vacancies of POMs through the formation of coordination bonds without destroying the basic framework of POMs. The newly produced chemical bonds could promote the movement of electrons in the system, resulting in the unique applications of transition metal-deficient POMs in catalysis, light and electricity. In the case of BiW9 complexes, the more intense bands appear at ∼190 nm and 250 nm due to the pπ(Ot) → dπ*(W) transitions and pπ(Oc,e) → dπ*(W) charge transfer in the tricentric bonds, respectively. Therefore, doping transition metals into POMs is a meaningful method to change their photoelectric properties.27 Commonly, the Zn element is widely explored in the field of optoelectronics due to its good carrier conductivity and abundant reserves. For example, Zinc Phthalocyanine Conjugated (ZnPc) dimers have been used as efficient dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.12 In addition, the Zn element also has been widely used in the field of luminescent materials, MOFs.
Taking into account these factors, we synthesized Zn-doped POMs Na10[Zn2(H2O)6(WO2)2(BiW9O33)2] (BiW9-Zn) through a gentle crystallization process. The as-synthesized BiW9-Zn belongs to a trilacunary Keggin type sandwich structure, which was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Table S1†). Considering the excellent stability and light absorption, the lacunary Keggin type BiW9-Zn was used as an additive in HTLs to oxidize the Spiro-OMeTAD for the first time. The enhanced hole extraction and charge separation suggest that BiW9-Zn can impede the recombination of electrons and holes. In addition, the enhancement of the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of devices was realized, yielding an optimal PSC with an enhanced PCE value to 19.56%. More importantly, the device repetition rate and stability of randomly selected devices were also improved by employing BiW9-Zn-doped HTLs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of BiW9-Zn
According to previous reports with modifications,27,28 Na9[BiW9O33] was selected as a starting material for the preparation of BiW9-Zn. Briefly, 5.70 g (2 mmol) Na9[BiW9O33] was dissolved in 30 ml of sodium acetate buffer solution (at 60 °C) with stirring. Next, 0.44 g Zn(CH3COO)2 (2 mmol) was dissolved in little water and added dropwise into the pre-prepared solution. The mixture underwent continued stirring subsequently for 1 h. Finally, the resulting solution was filtered through a medium frit and cooled to room temperature. After a few days, a white crystal was obtained by filtration.
2.2. Device fabrication
At first, FTO glass was etched with hydrochloric acid and zinc powder, followed by cleaning with acetone and water, respectively, and FTO glass was pre-treated with UV-ozone for 30 minutes. An electronic transport layer (ETL) was deposited onto FTO glass by spin-coating a mixture of titanium(IV) isopropanol and hydrochloric acid at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Next, the substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The multiple cation halide perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (0.507 g), PbBr2 (0.073 g), FAI (0.172 g) and MABr (0.022 g) in 1 mL of a 1:4 (v/v) mixture of DMSO and DMF. 89 μL CsI (1.5 mmol ml−1) solution was added into the pre-prepared solution, which was dissolved in 1 mL DMSO, yielding a nominal composition of Cs0.1[(FA0.83MA0.17)]0.9Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3. The perovskite film was prepared by spin-coating on the ETL at 1500 rpm for 15 s and at 3000 rpm for 20 s. During the spin-coating, 200 μL of chlorobenzene was deposited onto the perovskite film over 4 s. Afterward, the devices were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h under heating. The hole transport material (HTM) was deposited onto the perovskite by spin-coating a mixture of Spiro-OMeTAD, TBP and Li-TFSI at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, 80 nm of a Au electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum (<5 × 10−4 Pa) to complete the device fabrication. To prepare the BiW9-Zn doped HTM solution, the pristine HTM solution was doped with different concentrations of BiW9-Zn, respectively.
2.3. Characterization of the materials
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were performed separately using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 instrument and a Hitachi new generation cold-field emission SEM. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were conducted on a PerkinElmer STA 6000 simultaneous thermal Analyzer. ESCALAB 250Xi was used to carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a Gamry electrochemical workstation. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode and a Pt plate as the working electrode in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) chlorobenzene solutions.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization
A PerkinElmer 750 spectrophotometer was used to record UV/Vis absorption spectra. The electrochemical properties of the samples and devices were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (Gamry INTERFACE 1000E). Steady-state PL measurements were performed by using an FLS 920 luminescence spectrometer. The photoluminescence performance was investigated using a steady-state fluorescence spectrometer FLS920. The hole mobility was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, which can be described using the following equation:J = (9/8) μ εrε0 (V2/d3)where J is the current density, μ is the hole mobility, εr is the dielectric constant of the material (normally taken to approach 3 for organic semiconductors), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), V is the applied bias, and d is the film thickness.
The working condition was 0.5 sun bias light for transient current and photovoltage measurements. The perturbation source was prepared by a pulsed laser radiation pulse from an Nd:YAG laser (Qsmart 450, Quantl, Inc). The pulse wavelength is 532 nm, the pulse width is 6 ns, and its repetition frequency is 10 Hz. The intensity of the pulse was adjusted with a neutral grey filter and evaluated using a Joule meter (Starlite, Ophir, Inc.). The open-circuit voltage and circuit photocurrent density were tested using a resistor (1 MΩ and 50 Ω), and were regulated and determined similar to the intensity of the pulse and the results can be fitted with the following equation:y = A1ex/τ1 + y0where A1 is the relative amplitude, τ1 is the transient decay time, and y0 is a constant for the base-line offset.
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) plots and electrical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained with a CHI660D electrochemical workstation and a solar simulator under AM 1.5 G sunlight produced using a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 1 sunlight intensity: 100 mW cm−2). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using an IPCE measurement system. Light intensity was calibrated using a silicon detector (model 71675, Newport, USA).
3. Results and discussion
The structural analysis of the as-synthesized BiW9-Zn is shown in Fig. 1a; the polyoxometalate crystal could be assigned to a trilacunary Keggin type sandwich structure. The asymmetrical unit consists of two β-[BiW9O33] sections connected by two co-angled WO6 octahedra and two MIIO3 (H2O)3 (M = ZnII). In the crystal structure of BiW9-Zn, the anion clusters are connected by sodium ions to form a one-dimensional chain structure. In order to further confirm the structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses were performed. In Fig. S1,† it is observed that the XRD spectrum of BiW9-Zn powder is well consistent with the previous reports, indicating its high purity and crystallinity. In addition, the appearance of characteristic diffraction peaks of POMs in the wavelength range of 500–1000 nm suggests that BiW9-Zn was synthesized successfully. The Thermo Gravimetric Analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG-DSC) results and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are shown in Fig. S2.† The as-synthesized BiW9-Zn could maintain its structure up to 350 °C, which can be observed from the TG curve.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to measure the energy level value of BiW9-Zn (Fig. 1b) according to the following energy level calculation method.EHOMO = −(EOx + 4.50 + 0.20)
The EHOMO of BiW9-Zn was calculated as −5.37 eV, which is between the HOMO of the perovskite (−5.60 eV) and Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV). UV/Vis absorption was carried out to investigate the optical properties of the as-prepared BiW9-Zn. As shown in Fig. 1c, the BiW9-Zn particles show a strong absorption band at a range of 200–400 nm, and the band gap of BiW9-Zn was calculated to be 3.27 eV (inset of Fig. 1c), so the ELUMO of BiW9-Zn is −2.10 eV. The Zn element also plays an important role in the absorption of light. After doping Zn with POMs, the UV/Vis absorption of light improved at a range of 200–400 nm (Fig. S3†). Benefiting from the matched energy level and strong electron-accepting ability of BiW9-Zn, the conjugated electrons transfer from Spiro-OMeTAD to BiW9-Zn, achieving plenty of oxidized Spiro-OMeTAD+. Meanwhile, BiW9-Zn can also act as a channel between the HTL and perovskite, and promote the transportation of hole carriers between the perovskite and hole transport material (HTM).
The oxidizing ability of BiW9-Zn is extremely important for the final photoelectric performance of Spiro-OMeTAD, so the UV/vis absorption of various HTM solutions with different doping concentrations of BiW9-Zn was measured.16,23 The sample photographs of HTM solutions with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S4† and the related UV/vis spectra can be seen in Fig. 2a. Without doping of BiW9-Zn, there is no significant absorption over the entire wavelength range for HTM solution, due to the poor hole mobility of pristine Spiro-OMeTAD. As the concentration of BiW9-Zn increases gradually, the absorption intensity of a new peak at wavelengths of 526 nm and 680 nm grows accordingly, which is attributed to the coming out of oxidized Spiro-OMeTAD+.16 Besides, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) also prove the oxidation process between BiW9-Zn and Spiro-OMeTAD. In Fig. 2b, it could be easily found that the peak of C 1s toward lower binding energy with a shift of 0.9 eV compared with the HTM without BiW9-Zn indicates that BiW9-Zn could oxidize Spiro-OMeTAD effectively.23 More importantly, the nearly invariable FT-IR spectrum suggests that the molecular structure of Spiro-OMeTAD did not change with BiW9-Zn, but the internal electrons were transferred from Spiro-OMeTAD to BiW9-Zn without a structural change (Fig. S5†). Finally, the oxidation process of Spiro-OMeTAD could be explanted by the following equation:BiW9-Zn + Spiro-OMeTAD → BiW9-Zn− + Spiro-OMeTAD+

To further quantitatively analyze the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD upon the dopant of BiW9-Zn, the HTM layer was sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS and Ag to fabricate hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/MoO3/Ag) and a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) was used to calculate hole mobility.29 It can be observed clearly that the hole mobility of the HTM without BiW9-Zn (2.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) is lower than that of the HTM with BiW9-Zn (3.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) (Fig. 2c). As the doping concentration of BiW9-Zn increased, the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD increased (Fig. S6†). Due to the oxidation of POMs, plenty of oxidized Spiro-OMeTAD+ were produced. Additionally, the Zn element has good carrier conductivity and abundant reserves, which promote the efficient transmission of hole carriers. Under the combined effect of these factors, the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD with BiW9-Zn has been effectively improved. Electrical conductivity is also an important property for HTLs, which is related to both the concentration of oxidized Spiro-OMeTAD+ and hole mobility.30Fig. 2d shows the current–voltage characteristics of similar in-plane hole-only devices (Glass/TiO2/HTM/Au) with and without BiW9-Zn doping.31 The additive-based device shows a lower series resistance and less leakage current than the pristine device, and the conductivity of HTLs shows a significant increase from 2.42 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 4.13 × 10−5 S cm−1. These results clearly show that BiW9-Zn could improve conductivity and hole mobility effectively, which play an important role in the high performance devices.32 The planar structural PSCs were fabricated by employing different BiW9-Zn doping concentration HTLs. As shown in Fig. S7a,† the optimal device achieved the best PCE value of 19.56% when adding a 4 mg ml−1 BiW9-Zn doping concentration.
To further explore the relationship between the BiW9-Zn doping concentration and the performance, the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under darkness and the UV/Vis absorption of PSCs were determined. Undoubtedly, BiW9-Zn plays an important role in suppressing the recombination of carriers and improving the extraction of holes at the interface of the perovskite and HTL. In Fig. 3a, all the BiW9-Zn doped PSCs exhibit a longer charge lifetime manifested by a slower open-circuit voltage decay than the pristine device, indicating that the recombination of carriers has been prevented effectively. In particular, the device possesses the lowest open-circuit voltage decay when adding 4 mg ml−1 BiW9-Zn in the HTL. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the dark state J–V measurement results. As shown in Fig. 3b, the device without BiW9-Zn shows faster dark current decay, which is positively correlated with the carrier recombination rate. In contrast, the carrier recombination was efficiently restrained in the BiW9-Zn doped PSCs. In addition, the UV/Vis absorption proves that BiW9-Zn can effectively improve the extraction ability of the holes, thereby enhancing the absorption of light and improving the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs (Fig. S7b†). These results demonstrate that doping BiW9-Zn with a suitable concentration is favorable for preventing carrier recombination and improving the performance of PSCs. However, the overloaded doping concentration of the additive will bring an undesirable influence on the performance of PSCs. In this case, an unlimited increase in the concentration of BiW9-Zn will cause crystal bleed on the surface of the HTL, which affects the denseness and flatness of the film surface (Fig. S8e†). To observe the quality of the film after BiW9-Zn doping, the top-view SEM images of the HTL with different HTMs are shown in Fig. S8.† As the concentration of the additive BiW9-Zn increases, the surface of the HTL gradually becomes smooth and dense, and the defect state is significantly reduced, which effectively inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes and is more conducive to the transportation of carriers. Therefore, the quality of the HTM film with a small amount of BiW9-Zn is significantly improved, which is beneficial for the improvement of the hole mobility and conductivity of the whole HTL (Fig. S8d and S8f†). However, a slightly small particle could be seen when adding BiW9-Zn at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 (Fig. S8e†). The irregular film will limit the transport of electrons (holes) and cause the electrochemical performance degradation. Hence, the 4 mg ml−1 doping concentration may be the equilibrium point for photovoltaic performance and the interface morphology.

As shown in Fig. 4a, the PSCs fabricated with the HTM without BiW9-Zn yield a conventional PCE of 17.58% with a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 22.37 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.74 and a Voc of 1.07 V, respectively. Instead, the PSCs with BiW9-Zn show an improved PCE of 19.56% with a Jsc of 23.35 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.76 and a Voc of 1.11 V, respectively (Table 1). The cross-view SEM image of the devices is shown in Fig. S9.† The J–V characteristics with the reverse (from open circuit to short circuit) and forward (from short circuit to open circuit) scanning directions are a common means to study the hysteresis phenomenon of PSCs; the hysteresis factor (HI) could be calculated using the following equation:HI = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse.

The PSCs with BiW9-Zn show a lower hysteresis factor of 0.11 than pristine PSCs (0.21). Obviously, BiW9-Zn can not only increase the FF and Voc, but also restrain hysteresis effectively, thus improving the performance of PSCs.
From the previous tests, it can be known that BiW9-Zn accelerates the oxidation process of Spiro-OMeTAD, thus enhancing the hole mobility and conductivity of Spiro-OMeTAD. Additionally, the POM-based additive also exhibits excellent optical properties in the device. In Fig. 4b, the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the PSC with doping of BiW9-Zn show a significant improvement in a wavelength range of 400–500 nm, showing the enhanced light absorption after introducing trilacunary POMs. BiW9-Zn could oxidize Spiro-OMeTAD quickly and effectively, thereby enhancing the hole mobility and conductivity of the HTL. Thus, the PV properties of PSCs are enhanced.
To further understand the charge extraction and recombination processes in the devices, the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were performed.33,34 As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the TPC spectra of the HTM without BiW9-Zn (2.04 μs) shows a slower decay compared with those of the counterpart (1.45 μs), which confirms enhanced carrier extraction and transmission properties of Spiro-OMeTAD with BiW9-Zn. The fast component of the TPV decay is typically associated with non-geminate recombination. The photovoltage decay time of the device with BiW9-Zn is significantly increased from 2.91 to 4.82 μs, with the higher Jsc, FF and Voc in PSCs. Therefore, these pieces of evidence supported the argument that BiW9-Zn when employed as a dopant can lead to faster carrier extraction and efficiently suppress the charge recombination at the interface of the HTM and the perovskite at the same time, thereby ultimately improving the photovoltaic performance.
The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) of the HTL reflect the effect of BiW9-Zn on the reduction of hysteresis behavior and improvement of photovoltaic performance.35Fig. 5a shows the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite film spin-coated HTMs with and without BiW9-Zn, respectively. Under an excitation wavelength of 470 nm, the single-layer perovskite film shows a strong emission peak at 790 nm. The PL intensity of perovskite film coated different HTLs was significantly weakened, especially for the HTM with BiW9-Zn doping. It is well known that the PL quenching is related to the hole coupling of the perovskite and HTL. The great degree of quenching indicates fast hole injection from the perovskite to HTL, suggesting that the HTM with BiW9-Zn could effectively extract the transport holes from the perovskite layer. Furthermore, the TRPL spectra were measured and the data are shown in Table. S2.† The data are fitted with the following equation:τ = (τ21A1 + τ22A2)/(τ1A1 + τ2A2)where τ1 comes from the bulk recombination in the perovskite films in a few tens of nanoseconds, τ2 represents the delayed recombination of trapped charges in hundred nanoseconds. In Fig. 5b, the PL delay time was reduced from 5.71 ns (perovskite) to 3.62 ns (perovskite/HTM without BiW9-Zn) and 2.75 ns (perovskite/HTM with BiW9-Zn), respectively, suggesting that BiW9-Zn could improve the charge separation and hole transmission from the perovskite to HTL.

In an attempt to evaluate the charge transfer and electrochemical performances in PSCs, the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results are presented in Fig. 5c.36,37 The charge recombination resistance (Rec) is the big semicircle in the low-frequency range, whereas the small arc in the high-frequency range can be attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rrt) at the perovskite/HTM film interface. Significantly, the high Rec value means that the charge is transferred with difficulty in the PSCs doped with BiW9-Zn, which can also indirectly prove that the charge separation was enhanced by the addition of POMs. This result is consistent with the changing trend achieved through photovoltaic analysis. Hence, EIS analysis further demonstrates the effective role of BiW9-Zn in the charge extraction. A suitable amount of BiW9-Zn doping for the HTM is beneficial for the facilitation of charge extraction, which is correlated with the improved photovoltaic performance, such as higher FF and Voc values. In addition, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves are presented in Fig. 5d, and the integrated Jsc values calculated from the IPCE curves are well consistent with the J–V curves. As expected, the IPCE curve of PSCs fabricated with BiW9-Zn was also improved.
Finally, the repeatability and long-term stability (stored under air atmosphere with humidity at about 30% and temperature at about 25 °C in the dark) of PSCs based on different HTLs are observed continuously.38 In Fig. S10,† the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs without doping of BiW9-Zn obviously decreased, especially the Voc and FF, which is consistent with a lower PCE average. With the doping of BiW9-Zn, the water contact angle increased from 72.2° to 77.1° (Fig. S11†), which means that BiW9-Zn could play a role as a barrier to water. Besides, the degradation rate of the perovskite based on the HTL film without BiW9-Zn is significantly quick under high humidity (>85%) after 24 h as shown in Fig. 6a–d. Compared with the pristine device, the denser film of the HTM with BiW9-Zn not only suppresses the direct contact of the perovskite film with the Au electrode but also prevents the perovskite from moisture by modifying the surface of the HTL. As a result, the PCE of PSCs prepared using HTMs with BiW9-Zn still maintains about 89% of its initial value, and the PCE of PSCs without BiW9-Zn lost more than 25% after one month as shown in Fig. 6e. Thus, the corresponding results confirm that the long-term stability of PSCs could be effectively enhanced by introducing trilacunary Keggin type POMs. The light and thermal stabilities of the PSCs are the main challenging concepts. Doping the Spiro-OMeTAD with BiW9-Zn, all devices were subjected to constant illumination (AM 1.5G) without encapsulation for 7 h. As shown in Fig. 6f, devices based on BiW9-Zn show better stability than pristine devices. As for the stability of PSCs against heat, the unencapsulated devices were heated on a plate at 85 °C and measured under the same conditions for a week. The PCE of the devices with BiW9-Zn maintained 86% of their initial values (Fig. 6g). In contrast, the PCE of PSCs only with Spiro-OMeTAD degraded to 69.4% of its initial value under the same conditions. The results certify that BiW9-Zn addition can improve the device stability effectively. Combined with the previous tests, it is found that BiW9-Zn could reduce the pathways of moisture in the perovskite film due to the denser film and suppress the decomposition of PSCs, thereby enhancing the stability of PSCs against thermal and light soaking stresses.

4. Conclusions
In summary, BiW9-Zn was successfully prepared as a trilacunary Keggin type POM and it could be used as a cost-effective dopant for Spiro-OMeTAD firstly. The photoelectric performances and J–V measurements prove that the conductivity and hole mobility of hole carriers were significantly increased by introducing BiW9-Zn in the HTL. In addition, the chemical doping of BiW9-Zn could also reduce the recombination of carriers and promote the transport of holes in the interface. As a result, the optimal PSC with a high efficiency of 19.56% as well as enhanced FF and Voc was obtained when employing BiW9-Zn (4 mg ml−1) doped HTLs. More importantly, the repeatability and long-term stability of PSCs also have been improved. The PCE of PSCs prepared using HTMs with BiW9-Zn still maintains about 89% of its initial value after 30 days. This work demonstrates the potential of using POMs as low-cost, efficient and highly flexible chemical dopants for HTLs, and more importantly presents a strategy to enhance the performance of PSCs.
