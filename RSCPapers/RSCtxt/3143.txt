    , Accepted 26th June 2018First published on 27th June 2018AbstractInorganic perovskite materials have great potential for application in optoelectronic devices, especially solar cells, due to their outstanding photoelectric properties and high stability. In this work, we demonstrated CsPbBr3 inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) composed of a derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 for the first time by precisely controlling the film thickness of precursor materials. The presence of CsPb2Br5 at the interface of CsPbBr3 crystals can increase the grain size of the inorganic perovskite and effectively passivate grain defects and the electron transport layer. The derivative phase will lower the energy barrier and reduce the carrier recombination in the active layer. Remarkably, this self-passivation results in a respectable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.34% with a CsBr:PbBr2 ratio of 1:1.1. Besides, the device exhibits a superior stability for more than 1000 h without any degradation. Insights into the derivative phase formation and self-passivation mechanisms are demonstrated, providing a novel approach to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Hybrid perovskite materials have attracted much attention owing to their high carrier mobility, wide absorption spectrum and tunable band gap.1–7 In addition, their facile synthesis method, i.e. solution processes, and vapor deposition and vapor-solution methods, enables hybrid perovskite materials to be a potential candidate for optoelectric devices, including solar cells and light emitting diodes (LEDs).8–10 Even more impressive is that the hybrid perovskite solar cells achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 22.7%. However, the major challenges in the path of their commercial application are the poor stability of the organic cations (methylammonium or formamidinium, denoted as MA+ or FA+) against humidity and high temperature.11–13 In contrast, inorganic perovskite materials with superior stability to moisture, have been successfully assembled into photovoltaic devices in the past two years.14–21 For example, Liang and co-workers proposed an all inorganic perovskite solar cell (CsPbBr3-PSC) with a high PCE of 6.7%, which showed no performance degradation in humid air (RH ∼ 90%) for more than three months.22 Recently, a high-purity inorganic CsPbBr3-PSC with a PCE above 9.7% and an excellent stability against humidity (RH ∼ 90%) has been reported by Duan et al.6
It is worth noting that the interface engineering, via surface passivation, energy-band bending and composition tuning, takes an important role in enhancing the performance and stability of the inorganic perovskite devices. The modification of the interface can effectively reduce the surface defects, and improve the concentration of carriers, as well as their transportation. And also, the interface engineering will balance the composition and increase the band alignment.19,23 Based on the above analysis, Zai et al. incorporated the inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 into hybrid PSCs to passivate the interface, which not only enhanced the carrier dynamics and stability, but also lowered the optical bandgap of the perovskite.23 The Yin group proposed graded heterojunction engineering by introducing multigraded-heterojunction inorganic perovskite layers as an efficient hole transport layer (HTL) to reach an optimal energy alignment.24 However, it is still a big challenge to construct an excellent interface with precise composition, good distribution and desired energy band bending to achieve highly efficient and stable PSCs. The performances of the mentioned CsPbBr3-PSCs with various methods are summarized in Table 1.

Very recently, the derivative perovskite phases CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6 have been investigated by precisely controlling the contents of CsBr and PbBr2 in photodetectors (PDs), lasers, and LEDs.30–33 For instance, Wang et al. proposed solution-processed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 perovskite nanocomposites as the temperature-insensitive frequency-upconverted lasers.31 Our group reported a faster-response CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 perovskite PD based on the obvious passivation of the derivative phase CsPb2Br5.32 Lately, we constructed a hybrid PD employing CsPbBr3–Cs4PbBr6 perovskites as a window layer to achieve deep ultra-violet region detection.33 In addition, Duan et al. demonstrated a multi-step solution process to fabricate high-purity inorganic CsPbBr3-PSCs by utilizing the phase conversion among CsPbBr3, CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6.6
In this paper, a representative derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 is introduced into the CsPbBr3 layer by properly controlling the thickness of CsBr and PbBr2 precursors in the vapor system. After a simple post-annealing method, the presence of CsPb2Br5 between the interface of the CsPbBr3 grains provides self-passivation, which could effectively eliminate interface defects, lower the energy barrier of the electron transport layer (ETL) and suppress the recombination at the interface of the hole transport layer in the devices. By controlling the ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 as 1:1.1, a derivative-phase inorganic PSC with excellent performance has been obtained, including an impressive PCE of 8.34% and a highest voltage of 1.296 V. Furthermore, the derivative-phase inorganic PSCs show a high tolerance to humidity for more than 1000 h. This outstanding performance demonstrates that the derivative-phase inorganic perovskite films formed by the vapor deposition method have potential applications in photoelectric conversion.
Result and discussion
The experimental steps to produce the derivative-phase inorganic perovskite films via a physicochemical vapor deposition approach are illustrated in Fig. 1e. The formation mechanism of CsPbBr3 and the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 are described as the following:CsBr(g) + PbBr2(g) → CsPbBr3(s)CsBr(g) + 2PbBr2(g) → CsPb2Br5(s)CsPbBr3(s) + PbBr2(g) → CsPb2Br5(s)

The uniform CsBr thin film was first coated via a vapor deposition method on the substrates and covered with the PbBr2 thin film using the same procedure in a low vacuum system, which allowed the precise control of the inorganic perovskite film. XRD patterns for various ratios of CsBr/PbBr2 on the FTO substrates are shown in Fig. 1a. The typical diffraction peaks assigned to (100), (110), (111), (200) and (220) are found for CsBr:PbBr2 ratios near 1:1, which confirms the formation of the cubic-phase CsPbBr3 film. When the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio was above 1:1, the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 could be observed clearly. Similar to the cubic (space group Pm3m) phase CsPbBr3, a 3D framework of corner-connected PbBr6 octahedra with Cs+ cations is located between the octahedral,34 and the Cs ions in the CsPb2Br5 crystal sandwiched between the two layers of Pb–Br-coordinated polyhedra.30,35 The absorption spectra in Fig. 1b show a strong absorption in the ultraviolet region and a band edge shorter than 530 nm. Notably, the CsBr/PbBr2 ratio significantly affects the film absorption in the ultraviolet-visible region, and the film shows a high absorbance in the ultraviolet region, when the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio is up to 1:1.1. This can be explained by the occurrence of the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 with a wide bandgap of ∼2.9 eV.35 According to the UV-vis absorption spectrum, we can conjecture that the inorganic perovskite film constructed with the derivative phase (CsBr:PbBr2 = 1:1.1) has favorable absorption capability and a direct bandgap of 2.4 eV from the plot of (αhν)2versus the photon energy (hν) based on the Kubelka–Munk equation (Fig. 1b, inset). The enlargement of the bandgap of the inorganic perovskite film compared to pure CsPbBr3 (∼2.3 eV) is ascribed to the appearance of the derivative phase with a larger bandgap. The XRD pattern of the derivative-phase inorganic perovskite film is given in Fig. 1c, and the peaks at 15.195°, 21.558°, 37.792°, and 44.026° can be identified as (100), (110), (111), (211), and (220) lattice planes of the CsPbBr3 phase (PDF#54-0752), respectively. Importantly, the peaks at 23.390° and 29.355° can be verified as (210) and (213), respectively, indicating the occurrence of CsPb2Br5 (PDF#25-0211) with the excess content of PbBr2. To further understand the formation of the derivative-phase inorganic perovskite film, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed. The results, as seen in Fig. S2,† show no significant shift in Pb 4f and Br 3d peaks towards higher binding energy. This can be explained by the same element valence band of CsPbBr3 and the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5.30 The corresponding element ratio of Cs to Pb and Br can be deduced from the XPS results listed in Table S1,† which agrees with our conjecture that the CsPb2Br5 derivative phase exists at the interface of the inorganic perovskite film.

Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of the inorganic perovskite film composed of different ratios of CsBr to PbBr2. The capping layers have a uniform and full coverage film over the substrates, but the smaller grain size for the CsBr:PbBr2 ratio of 1:0.75 is ascribed to the lower crystallization of the inorganic perovskite. With the increase in the thickness of the PbBr2 film, the crystal grains grow significantly. Fig. 2c shows a dense uniform film for the derivative-phase inorganic perovskite with the grain size above 300 nm, which facilitates the light capture and electron transportation. However, increasing the ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 to 1:1.25 will result in a poor surface morphology. As witnessed in Fig. 2d, smaller grain sizes can be explained by the excess CsPb2Br5 with low crystallization at the interface. Additionally, the film produced by the vapor deposition method shows an extremely smooth interface with the roughness of only 17.3 nm (Fig. S3†), which is much lower than those in most previous reports employing the solution process. The smooth interface offers a good contact between the electron and hole transport layers. In parallel, the cross-section SEM image depicted in Fig. 2f shows a thick perovskite capping layer of around 350 nm. This full coverage upon the substrate will effectively reduce the presence of “shunt paths”, which results from the contact between the TiO2 compact layer and the Spiro-OMeTAD layer.

As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the inorganic perovskite film was assembled into a PSC with TiO2 serving as the ETL and Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. Notably, the positions of the valence-band maximum (VBM) and conduction-band minimum (CBM) of CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 films are −5.4 eV and −3.0 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b), which were measured using the valence-band XPS spectrum (Fig. S4†). The band energy levels in Fig. 3b indicate that the favorable level of the device benefits the transport of electrons and holes to the TiO2 conduction band and the Spiro-OMeTAD valence band, respectively. The J–V curves and the corresponding PV performance parameters of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 3c and Table 2, respectively. The device efficiency initially increases as the ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 decreases. The smaller ratio (1:0.75) leads to lower crystallization and smaller size, resulting in a poor PCE of 4.55%. Owing to the formation of the CsPbBr3 phase with a ratio of 1:1, the device exhibits an outstanding PCE of 7.29% and a higher photocurrent because of their excellent light capture. Impressively, a highest PCE of 8.34% was obtained when the ratio is 1:1.1, due to the formation of a novel CsPb2Br5 phase at the interface of CsPbBr3 grains. The derivative-phase containing Br− rich can not only enhance the absorption in the UV region, but also effectively passivate the defects at the interface of the film, resulting in a high photocurrent for the devices under illumination. When the ratio is further increased to 1:1.25, large amounts of CsPbBr3 phases will transform to small-size CsPb2Br5 derivative-phases, as witnessed in SEM. This mismatched bandgap could suppress the transportation of electrons and holes in the devices, resulting in a poor PCE of 5.63% and a lower photocurrent.

Fig. 3d shows the champion device of inorganic PSCs tested under the forward and reverse scanning. The PSC shows a respectable overall PCE of 8.34% with a higher Voc of 1.296 V, a Jsc of 8.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.9% under reverse scanning, while a PCE of 6.78% with a Voc of 1.283 V, a Jsc of 8.21 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.4% are obtained under forward scanning. It is noted that a relatively modest degree of hysteresis can be detected compared with previous reports using a TiO2 layer as the ETL. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the derivative-phase devices plotted in Fig. 3e show a band edge at ∼550 nm, and an obvious improvement of carrier harvesting in the ultraviolet region compared with the pure CsPbBr3 inorganic PSCs. The integrated Jsc values of the derivative-phase and pure CsPbBr3 inorganic PSCs are 6.49 mA cm−2 and 6.13 mA cm−2, respectively, which are both slightly lower than those measured by J–V curves. The difference in the value can be ascribed to the fact that the EQE in the ultraviolet spectra (less than 350 nm) could not be obtained due to the limitation of the instrument.22

Fig. 3f shows the histograms of PCEs for both pure CsPbBr3 and derivative-phase inorganic PSCs. The PCEs were distributed in a narrow range between 3.4% and 8.34% (average PCE over 6%), showing a good reproducibility of the vapor deposition approach in producing inorganic PSCs.
The improvement of the performance can be attributed to the presence of the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 in the absorption layer, which can modify the interface of inorganic PSCs. Electrons and holes are generated and quickly moved to the ETL and HTL separately at suitable energy levels as witnessed in Fig. 4a. However, the Spiro-OMeTAD, as the HTL, exhibits a high conduction band of −3.0 eV, which is similar to the inorganic perovskite layer. Upon illumination, holes will transfer through the HTL while electrons pass through the ETL without any energy barrier. The recombination at the interface between the absorption layer and the HTL will significantly affect the performance of inorganic PSCs. Importantly, the defects between the interface of TiO2 and CsPbBr3 films serve as deep recombination centers. The TiO2 compact layer, as the ETL, exhibits predominant surface defects (Ti3+ sites) acting as deep electron-donating sites after sintering at a high temperature (above 450 °C). The incomplete reaction or fast reaction will cause defects in the perovskite films including vacancies, interstitial, cation substitutions and anti-site substitutions, such as Br-rich/Pb-poor or Br-poor/Pb-rich, which also has a high influence on light capture and electron/hole transportation.7,34,36 The appearance of the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 offers a Br− rich surface with unbroken orbital composition of the conduction band, which can well passivate the interface and lower the energy barrier. At the same time, the derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 may reduce the recombination at the interface and the photocatalytic effect, thus accelerating the injection of electrons to TiO2.7,23 Additionally, CsPb2Br5 provides abundant halogen at the surface to prevent the trapping of excited electron. The larger bandgap of the CsPb2Br5 thin film also improves the energy barrier in the HTL and absorption layer, which hinders the transfer of electrons to the HTL, thus reducing the recombination, as depicted in Fig. 4b. To further understand the passivation effect, the PL decay lifetimes (τave) of the pure CsPbBr3 and derivative-phase inorganic perovskite film were determined. Compared with 382 ns of the pure inorganic perovskite film, τave = 487 ns for the derivative-phase film indicates lower recombination and longer carrier lifetime in CsPbBr3 crystals with the presence of the derivative inorganic perovskite phase CsPb2Br5.

In parallel, the stability is an important issue for the practical application of PSCs as the perovskite phase will decompose under humidity and high temperature. Herein, the stability test of derivative-phase inorganic PSCs without encapsulation was conducted, which shows excellent stability with the humidity of ∼45%. The PCE of the device only decreases 10% after 1000 h of exposure to humidity. In contrast, the PCE of the hybrid PSC dropped significantly since MAPbI3 decomposed to PbI2 and MAI under humid conditions. Notably, the PCE of derivative-phase inorganic PSCs is slightly higher than the initial value, which is attributed to the enhanced charge transport properties of Spiro-OMeTAD induced by air exposure.37 These results can be explained as following: (i) the stable inorganic Cs+ was introduced to replace MA+ or FA+ to enhance stability.1 (ii) The smaller Br− was introduced into the inorganic halide perovskite to replace I−, resulting in decreased structure deviation and enhanced stability of the perovskite materials.38,39 (iii) The vapor deposition allows thorough removal of the residual solvents and results in high-quality crystallization of compact perovskite grains, thus reducing the metastable phases among the thin film.40 Finally, the photocatalytic effect in TiO2 can accelerate the decomposition of perovskite under ultraviolet illumination, however, the presence of CsPb2Br5 can passivate TiO2 and inorganic perovskite layers, thus suppressing the photocatalytic effect at the interface.41
Conclusions
In summary, an interface engineering method was applied to inorganic PSCs by precisely controlling the vapor deposition. The derivative-phase (CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5) PSCs exhibited an outstanding performance in both PCE and stability. A highest PCE of 8.36% has been obtained when excess PbBr2 is used to form the derivative phase. The presence of the derivative phase largely enhances light capture in the UV region, effectively passivates the interface and also lowers the energy barrier. Remarkably, the derivative-phase inorganic PSC exposed to humidity without encapsulation shows outstanding stability for more than 1000 h. This extraordinary performance of the derivative-phase inorganic perovskite prepared by vapor deposition indicates that this simple, controllable, low-cost and versatile approach has great potential in the pursuit of high-performance semiconductor devices, especially in the light conversion area.
