    , Accepted 30th September 2016First published on 30th September 2016AbstractTwo novel green β-substituted ZnII-porphyrins, G1 and G2, based on a 4D–π–1A type substitution pattern have been synthesized. Their enhanced push–pull character, by reduction of H–L energy gaps, promotes broadening and red-shifting of absorption bands. The effective synthetic pathway and the remarkable spectroscopic properties make G2 ideal for BIPV application.
The collective interest in renewable energy resources, because of the steady increase of global warming ascribed to the green-house gases from fossil fuels, has given way to photovoltaics as a sustainable energy supply. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention as a promising alternative to the traditional silicon-based solar cells achieving excellent photon-to-current conversion efficiencies.1–3 The cheap and transparent TiO2 semiconductor4 makes DSSCs very intriguing for specific application in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV),5–7 especially in assembling see-through photovoltaic glass windows.8–10 In future a large variety of DSSCs for BIPV application desirable for colourful PV glazing, from green to blue,11 should be fabricated to meet the aesthetic requirements of building façades and cost reduction must be considered for mass scale production.8–10,12 Unlike organic sensitizers, which usually display orange/red colour, porphyrin dyes could provide more attractive greenish devices. Hereto, fine-tuned porphyrin-sensitized solar cells have achieved a 13% conversion efficiency in the presence of a CoII/III redox mediator by using a SM3153 dye belonging to the series of 5,15-meso-substituted ZnII-porphyrins. Such a series is known to show excellent photoelectrochemical characteristics and good near infrared (NIR) absorptions;13,14 nevertheless it needs a very demanding and laborious synthetic pathway. Furthermore, the presence of the cobalt redox shuttle forces the introduction of additional bulky alkoxy chains in the dye structure to suppress the fast recombination processes.15 For these reasons the industrial scale-up of this class of porphyrin dyes cannot be taken into consideration for practical application in BIPV. Conversely, β-substituted porphyrins, based on a highly symmetric meso-tetraarylsubstituted core, easily obtained by one-pot cyclization reactions between appropriate aryl-aldehydes and pyrrole, appear to be synthetically more convenient for mass scale production necessary to sensitize large decorative DSSC modules integrated in PV windows of building façades. Consequently, they have recently received renewed interest16–26 from the scientific community which led to an improvement of the overall synthetic yields up to two-fold, superior to those earlier reported,27 by optimising both functionalization28,29 and substitution30 processes at the β-pyrrolic position. Their native bulky structure can also provide a significant shielding effect onto the TiO2 surface against charge recombination when compared to the 5,15-meso-substituted analogues.18
Here we propose to combine the key features of meso- and β-substituted porphyrins to guarantee ideal characteristics for BIPV application by designing green sensitizers accessible by straightforward and efficient synthetic pathways and featured by extended electron absorption across the visible spectrum.
A rational engineering of the porphyrin structure affects its electronic properties and, thus, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be properly tuned.31 As a consequence, dyes with increased push–pull character can be synthesized to gain ideal spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical characteristics. The introduction of multiply donating aryl substituents in the meso positions of porphyrin dyes was previously evidenced to have significant electronic effects on the HOMO levels.32–38 This produces broadening of the B band, intensification of the Q bands and red-shifting of both absorption peaks, thus improving the light-harvesting properties of the dye both in the visible and NIR regions.39,40 However, in previous approaches, the obtained dyes were highly asymmetric, making their synthetic strategy poorly effective.41
Hence, two new β-substituted porphyrinic dyes, G1 and G2 (Chart 1), have been synthesized by introducing four electron-donating groups in the meso position and an electron-withdrawing unit in one of the β-pyrrolic positions. Herein, bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)aniline, as a bulky donor substituent, has been chosen both to induce a significant electronic effect on the HOMO levels and to reduce, simultaneously, the recombination rate onto the TiO2 semiconductor. The ethynylphenyl-cyanoacrylic acid group, as an acceptor and anchoring pendant, was originally selected to obtain the G1 dye while a benzothiadiazole moiety (BTD) was further inserted into the β-pyrrolic substituent providing the G2 dye. The latter was rationally designed to increase the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor unit which affects the LUMO levels and, simultaneously, to extend the anchoring pendant in order to strengthen the binding of the dye onto the semiconductor. To the best of our knowledge, the structural arrangement of the newly reported β-substituted porphyrinic dyes was never proposed, thus, for better discussion and simplicity hereafter this donor–acceptor pattern will be referred to as 4D–π–1A type.
 Chart 1  Molecular structures of Zn-1, G1 and G2. 
G1 and G2 were easily obtained by multiple Buchwald–Hartwig aminations of the ZnII-tetra(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin followed, first, by a bromination step at the β-pyrrolic position and then by a substitution step via microwave-enhanced Sonogashira coupling30 to introduce the acceptor unit, as fully described in the ESI.† For comparison, the Zn-1 reference dye (Chart 1), lacking amino groups, was synthesized, as described elsewhere.30 Cyclic voltammetry measurements in DMF were carried out with the aim of determining how the redox potentials of the dyes are influenced by the nature of substituents. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the corresponding energy gaps (H–L gaps) in DMF, electrochemically determined and computed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level, are reported in Table 1. It turns out that the four arylamino donor groups in the meso position induce a significant destabilisation of the HOMO energy levels. The 4D–π–1A type dyes, in fact, exhibit the first oxidation wave at a low positive potential (Table S2, ESI†), resulting in HOMO levels located at a higher energy, −5.04 eV and −5.03 eV respectively for G1 and G2, when compared with Zn-1 (−5.12 eV).

This trend is accurately reproduced by DFT calculations (Table 1) and by the electronic distributions of the HOMOs of the 4D–π–1A type porphyrins (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†) delocalized on the four arylamino groups rather than only on the porphyrinic core, as in the case of Zn-1 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The significant stabilisation of the LUMO energy level of G2 (−3.21 eV), due to the presence of the BTD moiety in the acceptor unit, is in agreement with the less negative first reduction wave potential (Table S2, ESI†) and it is also confirmed by the delocalization of LUMOs on the more extended β-pyrrolic substituent, as shown by the electronic distributions of the unoccupied molecular orbitals (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). As a consequence, the trend of the H–L energy gaps, correlated with the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing ability of the substituents, is Zn-1 (2.01 eV) > G1 (1.94 eV) > G2 (1.82 eV) evidencing a marked increase of the push–pull character in the ZnII-porphyrins with the 4D–π–1A substitution pattern. This affects the spectroscopic properties of the G1 and G2 dyes resulting in red-shifting and concomitant broadening of both B and Q bands as observed in their absorption spectra in THF solution (Fig. 1) and in the corresponding spectroscopic data and the computed excitation energies reported in Table S1 (ESI†). In particular, the B and Q2 absorption bands of G1 (respectively 457 nm and 621 nm) and G2 (454 nm and 620 nm) are red-shifted compared to those of Zn-1 (438 nm and 608 nm), while slight differences are shown for the Q1 absorption bands (568 nm, 575 nm and 574 nm for Zn-1, G1 and G2 respectively). In accordance with the bathochromic shift of the Q absorption bands a red-shifted fluorescence emission was also observed for G1 and G2 compared to Zn-1 (see the ESI† for more information).

Different solvents, soaking times and dye/chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) ratios have been tested to optimise the DSSC performances using I−/I3− as the redox mediator in the electrolyte. The best conversions, for all three dyes, have been generally obtained using 0.2 mM dye solutions in CH2Cl2 and 20 hours of loading time. The presence of ten equivalents of CDCA was found to be very beneficial in the case of G2, while it was negative for G1 and Zn-1. This is probably ascribed to the more extended BTD-based anchoring pendant of G2 which could guarantee the most efficient binding onto TiO2, thereby resisting to a greater extent the competition with CDCA during the loading step. Photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and current density-to-voltage characteristics (J–V curves under illumination and in the dark) are reported in Fig. 2, while the related photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2 and refer to the best results obtained in a group of at least three devices for each configuration (complete results are listed in Table S3, ESI†). 6.22% light-to-current conversion efficiency (η) was achieved for the G2 + CDCA sensitized DSSC with a mask and 8.79% without. These values are remarkable by considering that up to now the best performance, achieved by a β-substituted porphyrin sensitized solar cell, has been 7.1% efficiency42 (with or without a mask was not declared). Surprisingly, the Zn-1 sensitized DSSC (η = 5.62%) performed better than the G1 based one (η = 2.72%), despite the narrower H–L energy gap and the wider electronic absorptions across the visible spectrum of the G1 dye. IPCE spectra of the aforementioned DSSCs confirm this trend. The G2 sensitized DSSC exhibits significant IPCE% values (up to 60%) over a very broad spectral range (300–700 nm) while much lower values of IPCE% are shown by the G1 based DSSC (<40%) compared to the Zn-1 based one (around 60%), although a photocurrent over 700 nm is observed for both 4D–π–1A type dyes. The Zn-1 sensitized DSSC shows, in fact, good IPCE% values only up to 620 nm due to the limited push–pull character due to the lack of amino-groups. The lower value of IPCE% shown by the G1 based DSSC can be attributed to the short anchoring substituent in the G1 dye with respect to the bulky amino-groups surrounding the core which hamper an adequate loading of the dye onto the TiO2 surface. In Zn-1 and G2, on the other hand, the anchoring chain protrudes by about 5 Å with respect to the surface enveloped by the four aryl amino groups (Fig. S3 and S5, ESI†) favouring a superior dye loading. A spectrophotometric evaluation (Fig. S10, ESI†) of the dye loading capacity on transparent thin TiO2 layers was carried out to corroborate this assumption. Surface concentrations (Γ) of 3.56 × 10−8 mol cm−2 and 3.76 × 10−8 mol cm−2 were found for Zn-1 and G2 respectively, while a concentration of 1.94 × 10−8 mol cm−2 was found for G1 (Table S4, ESI†), in agreement with expectations. Furthermore, an increase of the recombination rate at the surface of the G1 sensitized DSSC is observed by the anticipated current onset (by ca. 50 mV compared with G2) exhibited by the J–V curves under the dark condition (Fig. 2b). Accordingly, the shorter anchoring unit of the G1 dye could promote the approach of the amino groups to the semiconductor surface favouring a back electron transfer by the overlap of the electronic hole at the periphery of the porphyrin ring and the injected electrons in the semiconductor. Alternatively, a more facile recombination kinetics could be promoted by the approach of I3− onto TiO2. Comparative photophysical studies on the dynamics of the new dyes at the TiO2/electrolyte interface are currently underway to elucidate the possible reasons for their different behaviours.

Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigation has confirmed the observations made from J–V curves. Higher values of measured capacitance (Cmeas), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and apparent electron lifetime (τ) were found (Fig. S9, ESI†) for the Zn-1 and G2 sensitized photoanodes with respect to the G1 sensitized one.
The value of Cmeas is related to the difference between the electron Fermi level (EFn) and the conduction band (Ecb) of TiO2.43 The displacement of capacitance plots (Fig. S9, ESI†) indicates that the conduction band of the G1 and G2 sensitized photoanodes does not present a relevant shift, so that the recombination resistance, Rct, can be treated on the basis of a similar number of electrons.44 G2 definitely exhibits a higher value of Rct (Fig. S9, ESI†) compared to G1, justifying the higher value of Voc. This can be attributed to the positive effect of the longer BTD-based anchoring unit in G2, which allows the amino groups to move away from the TiO2 surface, unlike G1 (vide supra). In contrast, the reference Zn-1 dye, lacking the amino groups, exhibits different values of the Fermi level and conduction band, resulting in higher Cmeas values. Although Zn-1 and G2 show similar values of Rct, as a result of a more significant Cmeas, the values of τ are slightly higher for Zn-1. Hence, G2 and Zn-1 show higher τ values in perfect accordance with the trend detected for photovoltaic performances in comparison with G1.
In conclusion we have designed and synthesized two ZnII-porphyrin sensitizers, G1 and G2, featured by a novel 4D–π–1A type substitution pattern showing four bulky electron-donating substituents in the meso position and a β-pyrrolic electron-withdrawing pendant. This substitution pattern endows the dyes with attractive spectroscopical characteristics of the push–pull meso-disubstituted porphyrins guaranteeing a concomitant, effective and straightforward synthetic pathway typical of the β-substituted porphyrins. Thus, our approach results in a viable and robust method to obtain green and cost-effective sensitizers meeting the aesthetic and economic requirements necessary for mass scale production in BIPV industrial application. A rational design and a fine tailoring of the G2 molecular structure also provided a narrower H–L energy gap resulting in enhanced push–pull character. This promoted broadening and red-shifting of the absorption bands resulting in an improved light-harvesting ability of the dye across the visible spectrum. Moreover G2 reached remarkable light-to-power conversion efficiency (8.79% without a mask) by a typical I−/I3− based DSSC leaving plenty of room for further improvements by a fine-tuning of the device fabrication conditions.
