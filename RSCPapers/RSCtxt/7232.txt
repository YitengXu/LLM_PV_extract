    , Accepted 29th September 2017First published on 2nd October 2017AbstractThis work presents a novel approach for preparing photocatalysts based on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) anchored with carbon dots (CDs) by a facile two-step method which includes an electrochemical anodization technique followed by electrochemical deposition. The synthesized high quality graphitic carbon dots can act as sensitizers to extend the spectral range of light absorption towards the full solar spectrum. It is confirmed that TiO2 NTAs anchored with CDs (CDs/TiO2 NTAs) display greatly improved photocatalytic activity and excellent photocatalytic stability. By tuning the light absorption of the TiO2 NTAs, the utilization of light in charge generation and separation is well synergized with the CDs for enhanced photocatalytic pollutant degradation and water splitting, achieving significantly improved rates of photocatalytic degradation and H2 production in the visible and full spectra, respectively.
It is well known that TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) are a nanomaterial that possesses promising applications in environmental purification,1–4 water splitting,5–9 solar cells,10,11 lithium-ion batteries,12,13 gas sensors14,15 and biological materials.16,17 Compared with traditional TiO2 nanofilms and nanoparticles, TiO2 NTAs exhibit excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity due to their unique highly ordered array structure, enhanced specific surface area and improved charge transfer channels.18–21 However, the wide application of TiO2 NTAs is limited by their wide band gap (e.g., anatase TiO2, Eg = 3.2 eV) that is only photo-responsive under UV illumination, restricting their further applications under solar light. In addition, the high rate recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs also reduces the PEC activity of TiO2 NTAs. In order to improve the PEC activity of TiO2 NTAs, various attempts have been made to narrow the bandgap of TiO2 and suppress electron–hole pair recombination, including doping with other elements such as metals (Pd, Au, Ag, Pt and Nb),22–26 nonmetals (C, N, B and S),27–31 semiconductor quantum dots (CdS, CdSe, CdTe and PbS),32–37 semiconductor metallic oxides (Cu2O, NiO and WO3)38–42 and semiconductor organic components (graphene and its composites).43,44 Among these, most sensitizers are toxic materials which may induce serious environmental problems, and the incorporation of doping ions into the TiO2 lattice generally leads to the emergence of sub-bandgaps, increasing the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Therefore, it is urgent to search for novel materials to decorate TiO2 NTAs for enhanced PEC activity. Graphitic carbon dots (CDs), a newly developed semiconductor,45,46 have been widely used in photocatalysis, including pollutant degradation and hydrogen production,47 sterilization,48 fluorescent probes49 and bioimaging.50 When combining CDs with TiO2 NTAs, the hot electrons generated from the conduction band (CB) of the CDs migrate along the channel of the nanotube to the counter electrode for the reduction reaction; meanwhile, the photoinduced holes from the valance band (VB) of TiO2 move to the VB of the CDs for the oxidation reaction, resulting in efficient charge transfer and separation.
Here, we employ a facile approach to synthesize TiO2 NTAs anchored with CDs (CDs/TiO2 NTAs); the proposed approach resulted in strong combination between the CDs and TiO2 NTAs. Although an analogous composite was previously reported,51 in our work, the CDs were uniformly dispersed on vertically aligned TiO2 NTAs with optimum density by controlling the deposition time based on the current electrochemically synthesized strategy. Moreover, we systematically investigated the promising application of CDs/TiO2 NTAs in the efficient degradation of pollutants and overall water splitting without the assistance of sacrificial agents under UV, visible and full spectrum wavelength light irradiation, respectively. Compared to pristine TiO2 NTAs, the synthesized CDs/TiO2 NTAs with an optimized deposition time exhibit enhanced efficiency of charge transfer between CDs and TiO2 NTAs without destroying the ordered nanotube structures because their utilization of light was extended to the visible and even the NIR region, thus showing enhanced photocatalytic activity during the processes of photocatalytic Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation and water splitting. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanisms were also proposed.
Experimental
Preparation of CDs/TiO2 NTAs
CDs with high quality and purity were prepared though a facile electrochemical approach without adding any chemicals except for pure water; thus, the CDs preparation process is both economical and environmentally friendly. In detail, one graphite rod was placed parallel to another graphite rod with a distance of 7.5 cm in a beaker containing 600 mL pure water, and a static potential of 60 V from a direct current power source was applied to the two electrodes. After 120 h of continuous stirring, the obtained solution was filtrated with slow-speed quantitative filter paper, and the resulting solution was centrifuged at 22000 rpm for 30 min to remove the precipitated graphite oxide and graphite particles. Finally, the synthesized CDs solution was concentrated to 0.1 mg mL−1 by rotary evaporation at 80 °C and then retained in reserve at ambient temperature.
A two-step anodizing method was employed to prepare TiO2 NTAs.52–56 Ti foils were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 30 min prior to anodization, respectively, followed by drying in a dry air stream. The anodization process was performed in a conventional two-electrode system with Ti foil as the anode and Pt foil as the cathode in ethylene glycol containing 0.5 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% H2O. In the first step of anodization, the Ti foil was anodized at 50 V for 2 h; then, the as-grown nanotube layer was removed ultrasonically in ethanol. The produced Ti foil then underwent a second anodization at 50 V for 5 min, producing ordered nanotube structures. After the two-step anodization, the obtained TiO2 NTAs samples were cleaned with deionized water and dried with nitrogen for 30 min, followed by annealing in air at 450 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for phase conversion from amorphous to crystalline.
CDs were anchored onto both the outer and inner walls of TiO2 NTAs by a facile electrochemical deposition method. First, 0.1 M pH 4.5 citric acid-sodium citrate buffer solution was added to the concentrated CDs solution (0.1 mg mL−1) with a volume ratio of 1:1, and CDs dispersion with a concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1 was obtained after moderate magnetic stirring for 20 min. CDs were deposited onto the surface of TiO2 NTAs by chronoamperometry (CA) using a three-electrode configuration with TiO2 NTAs/Ti foil as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode on an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, Switzerland). Scheme 1 presents a schematic of the two-step anodized TiO2 NTAs photoelectrode decorated with CDs by electrochemical deposition. The amount of CDs deposited on the TiO2 NTAs can be controlled by the electrochemical deposition time. After electrochemical deposition for different times, the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried in air for 30 min. The corresponding samples were marked as CDs/TiO2 NTAs-5 to CDs/TiO2 NTAs-40, respectively.

Characterization
The structures and morphologies of the prepared TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi-S4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G-20, USA) operated at 200 kV, combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to determine the element composition. An atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5500, USA) was used to measure the thickness profiles of the CDs. An X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (X'pert-Pro MRD, PANalytical, Netherlands) was employed to record X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze the crystal phases of the samples. The chemical composition of the atoms of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs was verified with the assistance of an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Axis Ultra HAS, KRATOS, Japan) equipped with an Al monochromatic X-ray source. The C 1s line at 284.8 eV was used as the calibration reference before each measurement. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Inc., USA) with a scan range of 4000 to 400 cm−1. The Raman spectra were obtained using a Raman spectrometer (FM4P-TCSPC, HORIBA Jobin Yvon, UK) with an air-argon ion laser as the excitation source (λex = 532 nm). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, USA) with an integrating sphere attachment. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an FLS 980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) with a xenon lamp as the excitation source (λex = 375 nm). Time-resolved PL measurements were performed at room temperature by detecting the modulated luminescence signal with a PMT (H10330-75, Hamamatsu, Japan) and then analyzing the signal with a photon-counting multichannel scaler.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a conventional three-electrode configuration and an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, Switzerland). The as-synthesized sample (1 × 1 cm2) was employed as the working electrode, and Pt foil and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode served as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.0) solution purged with Ar for 30 min prior to the measurements. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) was employed as simulated solar light to provide an irradiation source. UV-visible and full spectrum light were realized in the presence and absence of a 420 nm cutoff filter (short-wave-pass and long-wave-pass), respectively. The working electrode was irradiated by an Xe lamp during the measurements. The distance between the working electrode and the light source was 15 cm, and the power densities of UV and visible light were measured to be 2.7 and 100 mW cm−2. Linear sweep voltammetry curves were measured at a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1, ranging from −0.5 V to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent responses of the prepared photoelectrodes (i.e., I–t) were performed by measuring the photocurrent densities under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 30 s) at a bias potential of 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 390 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV at a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution.
Photocatalytic performance tests
The photocatalytic activity of CDs/TiO2 NTAs was measured by degradation of RhB and phenol solutions with initial concentrations of 10 mg L−1, respectively. The degradation process was conducted with magnetic stirring under a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) irradiation used as the simulated solar light source. The light source and power intensity were the same as those for the photocurrent measurements. Before light irradiation, the samples (1.5 × 3 cm2) were immersed in 10 mL of RhB or phenol solution in a quartz reactor at room temperature for 1 h to establish adsorption equilibrium, respectively. The reactor was equipped with a water quartz jacket to control the reaction temperature. The concentration of RhB during photocatalytic degradation was examined by measuring the maximal absorption at a wavelength of 526 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-5000, Agilent, USA) and the concentration of the phenol was analyzed by HPLC (581435-U C18 column, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Germany). Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a TOC analyzer (TOC-VCPH, Shimadzu, Japan). The reaction oxygen species were detected using a Bruker Elexsys A200 electron spin resonance spectrometer (ESR, Bruker, Germany).
The photocatalytic water splitting experiments were carried out in a Pyrex bottom irradiation-type high-throughput photoreactor. The samples (1.5 × 3 cm2) were immersed in 20 mL deionized water in a quartz bottle, followed by bubbling with Ar for 30 min to eliminate air completely. A 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) was used as the light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction; the light source and power intensity were the same as those for the photocurrent measurements. The reaction solution was maintained at 25 °C using a flow of cooling water during the reaction. The evolved gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, Sky Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd, China) equipped with a thermal conductive detector. Ar was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. Three replicates were collected for each sample with relative error <10%.
Results and discussion
The microstructure of the CDs was investigated by TEM (Fig. 1a), which demonstrated that the synthesized CDs have uniformly distributed sizes and shapes with average diameters of around 4 to 5 nm, similar to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) histogram test results (ESI Fig. S1a†). The well-separated diffraction spots in the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (insert in Fig. 1a) reveal the single-crystalline nature of the synthesized CDs. The HRTEM image of the CDs shows a lattice spacing of about 0.32 nm, as presented in Fig. 1b, which is in good agreement with the (002) lattice planes of graphitic carbon.57 The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of representive CDs is inset in the corresponding HRTEM image; the observed hexagonal lattice in the FFT image reveals that the synthesized CDs have crystalline hexagonal structures. The AFM image of the CDs (Fig. S1b†) further demonstrates that the synthesized CDs are uniform and dispersed on the surface of the mica substrate. The heights of the CDs are around 1.5 to 4.0 nm, as obtained from cross-sectional topographic measurements (Fig. S1b†); this suggests that there are several layers of graphene oxide-like structures. The remarkable optical properties of the synthesized CDs are confirmed by their UV-vis absorption and PL spectra. As shown in Fig. 1c, the synthesized CDs exhibit strong, broad absorption of sunlight in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared (NIR) regions according to the UV-vis spectrum, with a characteristic absorption peak at 228 nm. The wide spectral absorption range of the synthesized CDs is advantageous for use as a photosensitizer. The digital picture of the aqueous dispersion inset in Fig. 1c shows that the synthesized CDs are water-soluble and exhibit various PL spectra (Fig. 1d) under light irradiation with excitation wavelengths from 300 to 900 nm. The PL spectra show that some PL emission peaks are extended into the NIR region; this blue shift can be ascribed to the quantum confinement effect, with the conduction and valence bands shifting in opposite directions. The PL spectra result from the recombination of localized e–h pairs behaving as luminescence centers or chromophores, which implies that the synthesized CDs used as photosensitizers possess potential applications in biology and photocatalyst design.

For the chemical composition of the synthesized CDs, Fig. S2a† shows the XPS spectrum of C 1s, from which we can see that the peak intensity (located at about 288 eV) of the CDs has a more obvious increase compared to that of graphite, indicating that more carbon oxidation groups (C–O, CO) are present in the CDs. Fig. S2b† shows the Raman spectra (λ = 633 nm) of graphite and the CDs. For graphite, three prominent peaks are exhibited at 1345, 1571 and 2685 cm−1, corresponding to the documented D, G and 2D peaks, respectively; meanwhile, for the CDs, two prominent peaks at 1350 and 1602 cm−1 are presented, and the 2D peak disappears. The intensity ratio of the amorphous D band to the crystalline G band (ID/IG) for pristine graphite is 0.298; this value increased to 1.033 after electrochemical oxidation resulting from the introduction of defects to the synthesized CDs, such as oxygenated groups (C–O, CO, O–CO) in the sp2 carbon sites, and the generation of sp3 carbons and vacant lattice sites. The synthesized CDs show high solubility in water due to the introduction of hydrophilic groups, which is consistent with the C 1s XPS results. The functionalization was also confirmed by the FTIR spectra of graphite and the CDs, as shown in Fig. S2c.† The appearance of peaks with increased intensity for the obtained CDs corresponding to oxygen-containing groups (C–O, CO, O–H) and other new functional groups indicates the successful oxidation of graphite and the formation of oxygen functional groups as a result of the electrochemical oxidation. Fig. S2d† shows the XRD patterns of the pristine graphite and the synthesized CDs. The spectrum of the pristine graphite exhibits one prominent peak at 26.25° corresponding to the (002) planes of graphite. Meanwhile, for the synthesized CDs, two new peaks emerged at 22.94° (marked with ▼) and 18.25°; these refer to amorphous carbon and the (103) planes of hexagonal carbon, respectively.45 The XRD pattern of the CDs shows weaker and broader peaks compared to the pristine graphite, which indicates that the crystalline graphite transformed into amorphous structure carbon and that the partial sp2-hybridized CC in the aromatic ring converted to sp3-hybridized C–C in the synthesized CDs.58,59
To demonstrate the successful loading of the synthesized CDs on the TiO2 NTAs, Fig. 2 shows typical SEM top-view and side-view images of the pristine TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs, respectively. Regularly arranged nanotubes with a uniform nano-ring morphology can be observed from the SEM images (Fig. 2a and b) of the pristine TiO2 NTAs; the average diameter of the pores and the length of the nanotubes are around 70 nm and 2 μm, respectively, which can guarantee sufficient light absorption both in the UV and visible light regions. Meanwhile, the well-ordered hexagonal architecture with smooth top surfaces and high porosity is favourable for anchoring the CDs on the surface of the TiO2 NTAs and inside the TiO2 NTAs. The surface of the TiO2 NTAs was covered with dispersed CDs without blocking the channels by optimizing the electrochemical deposition time, as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2c and d) of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs; also, a well-ordered tubular structure was retained after this electrochemical process, suggesting that the electrochemical process has no effect on the ordered nanotube structure.

TEM and HRTEM were used to further investigate the morphologies of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs. In the low magnification TEM image (Fig. 3a) of the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs, an ordered array tubular structure can be clearly observed. From the higher-magnification TEM image (Fig. 3b), we can see some nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of the TiO2 nanotubes with slight agglomeration, revealing that the CDs have been successfully deposited onto the outer surface and interior of the TiO2 NTAs. The observed lattice spacings of 0.32 nm and 0.35 nm in Fig. 3c correspond to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon and the (101) plane of anatase TiO2, respectively.57,60 The TEM-EDX spectrum (Fig. 3d) and mapping images (Fig. 3e) provide visible evidence that the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs contains Ti, O and C (note that the Cu signal in the EDX spectrum is due to the copper grid substrate).

To investigate the amount of CDs deposited on the TiO2 NTAs with different electrochemical deposition times, Fig. S3† shows top and side view SEM images of CDs/TiO2 NTAs with electrochemical deposition times of 5, 10, 30 and 40 min. A small amount of CDs was deposited onto the TiO2 NTAs with 5 min deposition time (Fig. S3a and S3b†), and the amount of CDs on the TiO2 NTAs significantly increased with increasing deposition time. The optimized deposition time is 20 min, with CDs uniformly deposited onto the TiO2 nanotubes (Fig. 2c and d). The amount of CDs increased significantly when the deposition time increased to 30 min (Fig. S3e and S3f†), and the entrances of some nanotubes were blocked by CDs. The CDs aggregated to form nanoclusters and blocked the nanotubes with a deposition time of 40 min (Fig. S3g and S3h†). Therefore, the optimized amount of CDs anchored on the TiO2 NTAs could be controlled by the electrochemical deposition time.
The chemical composition of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs was studied by XPS. Fig. 4a presents the XPS survey spectra of the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs, showing the enhanced intensity of the photoelectron peak of C element in the CDs/TiO2 NTAs. The higher intensity of the photoelectron peak of C indicates that some of the C element contained in the TiO2 NTAs originates from the CDs. The peaks at 459.1 and 464.8 eV correspond to the pair of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, which can be assigned to the Ti4+ 2p peaks of the TiO2 NTAs (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c shows the XPS core level spectrum of O 1s, in which a peak at 530.3 eV arises from Ti–O–Ti linkages in TiO2.61 In addition, the peak at 531.6 eV corresponds to Ti–OH bonding due to the existence of hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the surface of the CDs, indicating the successful deposition of the CDs onto the TiO2 NTAs. In the XPS core level spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 4d), the peak at 284.8 eV belongs to the C–C bond of the CDs, and three other peaks at 285.6 eV, 286.5 eV and 288.8 eV are assigned to the oxygenated carbon species C–H, C–O and CO, respectively, which is consistent with the results in Fig. S2a.† In addition, from the quantification analysis of the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs (Table S1†), the increased atomic concentration of carbon with increasing electrochemical deposition time reveals the successful deposition of the CDs onto the TiO2 NTAs; an optimized density of CDs anchored on the TiO2 NTAs can be realized by controlling the deposition time.

FTIR analysis was conducted to investigate the carbon species in the prepared samples, and the results for the CDs, pristine TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different electrochemical deposition times are shown in Fig. S4.† In the spectrum of the CDs, some strong absorption peaks are observed, corresponding to stretching of the hydroxyl groups (3445 cm−1), CO groups in the carbonyl and carboxyl moieties (1724 cm−1), CC skeletal vibration bands (1420 cm−1), and C–O stretching vibrations in the epoxy groups (1244 cm−1, 1073 cm−1).45 Compared with the pristine TiO2 NTAs, the CDs/TiO2 NTAs samples exhibit –OH, CC, C–O and CO groups; the peak intensities of some functional groups increased with increasing electrochemical deposition time, suggesting that an increased amount of CDs was deposited onto the TiO2 NTAs with gradual extension of the deposition time. Fig. S5† shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different electrochemical deposition times. For CDs/TiO2 NTAs, the peak at 26.25° corresponds to the (002) planes of the CDs, while there is no corresponding peak for the pristine TiO2 NTAs. The intensity of the CDs peak increased with increasing electrochemical deposition time; the strongest peak is not clearly seen, as it may be masked by the high intensity of the Ti substrate peak. Raman spectroscopy was employed to characterize the crystal structures, defects and disorder of the CDs-hybrids. Moreover, the Raman spectra were acquired to further investigate whether the CDs were successfully deposited onto the TiO2 NTAs and to confirm the excellent stability of the crystal structure of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs during the electrochemical deposition process. Fig. S6† shows the Raman spectra of the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min. It was found that four obvious characteristic peaks were centered at 147 cm−1, 395 cm−1, 519 cm−1, and 638 cm−1 for all the samples; these peaks are ascribed to the Raman-active modes of pure anatase. In addition, two additional D band and G band peaks centered at 1345 cm−1 and 1609 cm−1, respectively, can be observed in the spectra of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs; these are the Raman active-modes of the CDs. Moreover, the intensity of the D bands and G bands for the CDs/TiO2 NTAs increased with increasing electrochemical deposition time. However, there is no D band or G band for the pristine TiO2 NTAs. These results indicate that the CDs were successfully anchored on the TiO2 NTAs by electrochemical deposition and that the density of the CDs increased with deposition time. Slight increases in the ID/IG ratio were observed at 0.931, 0.952, 0.960, 0.968 and 1.038 for the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively, indicating an increasing number of defects in the structure of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with increasing deposition time because of the existence of oxygen vacancies from the CDs. In addition, no 2D peak was found in the Raman spectra of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs, and the ID/IG ratios of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs were similar to that of the CDs (ID/IG = 1.033), demonstrating that there was nearly no change in the crystal structure of the CDs on the TiO2 NTAs during the electrochemical deposition process.
The light absorption properties of the pristine TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs were characterized by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 5a. The TiO2 NTA showed an absorption band gap lower than 390 nm due to the intrinsic band gap absorption of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV).62 Compared to the pristine TiO2 NTAs, the CDs/TiO2 NTAs exhibited extensive light absorption in the solar region of 200 to 2500 nm, which apparently broadened to the NIR region without extinction, thereby revealing that the CDs/TiO2 NTAs are a potential NIR-response photocatalyst. Usually, higher absorption in the visible and NIR regions indicates better photocatalytic activity. The CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min displayed the strongest absorption of all the samples; thus, they were expected to have the best photocatalytic activity. Fig. 5b shows the PL spectra of TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different electrochemical deposition times. Peaks were observed at about 450 nm, 466 nm, 490 nm and 595 nm in the PL spectra, resulting from the oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 nanotubes.43 A lower PL intensity indicated that the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs was stronger and the electrons could more readily leap the valence band.63 Compared to the TiO2 NTAs, the CDs/TiO2 NTAs showed lower PL intensity; the PL intensity decreased in the order of CDs/TiO2 NTAs-20 < CDs/TiO2 NTAs-10 < CDs/TiO2 NTAs-5 < CDs/TiO2 NTAs-30 < CDs/TiO2 NTAs-40 < TiO2 NTAs. In some cases, the PL signal intensities of the samples decreased with increasing deposition time; the later increase in the PL signal intensity with longer deposition time suggests that the aggregated CDs act as charge recombination centres rather than facilitating electron–hole separation and partially block the channels of the TiO2 NTAs. From the above results, it is revealed that the existence of an optimized amount and uniform distribution of CDs can promote electron–hole pair separation, thus endowing CDs/TiO2 NTAs-20 with the best photoelectrical activity. Fig. S7† shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay plots for the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times recorded at the same excitation wavelength of 370 nm. The TRPL decay profiles for the samples were fitted into a single exponential decay, corresponding to excitonic band edge electron–hole recombination, and a biexponential function expressed as eqn (1) was employed for fitting the data obtained for multicomponent photoactive assemblies.64 I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)

In eqn (1), I is the PL intensity, A1 and A2 are the pre-exponential factors, t is the time after excitation, and τ1 and τ2 are the corresponding lifetimes. The average time spent by electrons in the excited state before recombination or transfer was determined using eqn (2).64 τaverage = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi(2)where τaverage is the average time the electron spends in the excited state before recombination or transfer, and Ai and τi correspond to the parameters in eqn (1). The fitted data are provided in Table S2.† The average excited electron lifetime for the TiO2 NTAs is 36.25 ns; for the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, the average excited electron lifetimes are 18.52 ns, 17.46 ns, 16.10 ns, 26.11 ns and 33.17 ns, respectively. A shorter decay lifetime indicates higher separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs, and lower recombination of electron–hole pairs will lead to weaker photoluminescence and higher photoelectrical activity, which is consistent with the PL spectra.65 The CDs/TiO2 NTAs showed shorter decay lifetimes compared to the TiO2 NTAs, revealing that CDs can effectively suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs and promote the separation of e–h pairs.

Fig. 6a shows the linear sweep voltammetry curves of the prepared samples performed under simulated solar light irradiation in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Clearly, the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs present significantly enhanced photoresponse under simulated solar light illumination; the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min display the highest saturation photocurrent of 0.90 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, approximately 5.6 times that of the pristine TiO2 NTAs (0.16 mA cm−2) under the same conditions. In addition, the deposition of CDs induces a negative shift of the flat band potential, indicating a shift in the Fermi level to a more negative potential; this may arise because the CDs deposited onto the TiO2 NTAs can extend the lifetime of the photogenerated carriers. The photocurrent density vs. time curves of the prepared samples were acquired in the same electrolyte with several 30 s light on/off cycles at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 6b. The prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs showed photo-stability after 390 s of PEC testing, achieving photocurrent densities of 0.37 mA cm−2, 0.52 mA cm−2, 0.84 mA cm−2, 0.33 mA cm−2 and 0.22 mA cm−2 corresponding to the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively; all of these are higher than that found for the pristine TiO2 NTAs (0.13 mA cm−2). The above results reveal that the promoted photocurrent due to the existence of CDs in TiO2 NTAs is beneficial, resulting in enhanced separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and enhanced visible and NIR light absorption.

(c) EIS Nyquist plots of the pristine TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution under dark and simulated solar light illumination (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 100 mW cm−2). (d) IPCE spectra of the TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min. 
EIS tests were used to further analyze the separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs. The diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plots at high frequency conveys information about the charge transfer process; a smaller diameter represents a lower charge transfer resistance.66Fig. 6c shows the Nyquist plots of electrodes of the TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min in the dark and under simulated solar light illumination, respectively. The prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs show the smallest semicircular diameter compared to their counterpart, revealing that the CDs/TiO2 NTAs possess less charge transfer resistance than the pristine TiO2 NTAs and suggesting improved charge separation efficiency and enhanced photoelectrical activity. Additionally, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the prepared photoanodes were measured to study the photoresponses of the pristine TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs as a function of incident light wavelength. IPCE, which is synonymous with external quantum efficiency (EQE), is a valuable tool to provide insight into the properties of PEC materials; the IPCE values were calculated with the following eqn (3):67 IPCE (%) = (1240/λ) × (Jph/Ilight) × 100%(3)where λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), Jph is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), and Ilight is the incident light power density (mW cm−2) for each wavelength. Fig. 6d shows the measured IPCE spectra of the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min. As shown in Fig. 6d, the pristine TiO2 NTAs present strong photoresponse in the UV region (300 to 420 nm), which is similar to that of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs, and the photoresponse is negligible in the visible and NIR region from 420 to 2500 nm. However, the composited CDs/TiO2 NTAs show obviously enhanced photoresponse in the visible and NIR region from 420 to 2500 nm, indicating that higher PEC response results from the greatly enhanced visible and NIR light utilization. To further investigate the enhanced photoresponse of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs, photocurrent density versus time curves of the pristine TiO2 NTAs and the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min were recorded under UV (λ < 420 nm) and visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), respectively. As can be seen from Fig. S8a,† the CDs/TiO2 NTAs showed obvious photocurrent under visible light irradiation, while the photocurrent of the TiO2 NTAs was almost negligible; this indicates that the CDs/TiO2 NTAs can be excited by visible light, leading to broadening of the photoresponse range from the UV to the visible region and thereby enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the TiO2 photoanodes. Additionally, the photocurrent of TiO2 NTAs under UV light irradiation is similar to that under full spectrum wavelength light irradiation, while the photocurrent of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under UV light irradiation was much lower than that under full spectrum wavelength light irradiation, suggesting significantly enhanced photoresponse of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs in the visible and NIR region. Nyquist plots of the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs (Fig. S8b†) were recorded under UV and visible light illumination, respectively, further demonstrating the enhanced PEC activity of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a smaller charge transfer resistance.
To study the photocatalytic activity of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs, RhB degradation experiments were performed under simulated solar light irradiation. As a typical organic contaminant, RhB is stable under solar light irradiation if no photocatalyst is present. The degradation of RhB followed first-order reaction kinetics, which can be defined as ln(C0/Ct) = kt, where C0 and Ct are the initial concentration and the concentration after a certain reaction time of RhB, respectively, k is the kinetic constant and t is the reaction time. Based on the measured removal efficiency of RhB, as shown in Fig. 7a, almost no RhB removal was observed after 180 min in the control group, and 50.7% removal of the RhB was obtained in the photocatalytic process with the same illumination time when using the pristine TiO2 NTAs; meanwhile, for the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, the RhB removal rates reached 72.5%, 80.2%, 93.5%, 63.4% and 55.4%, respectively, showing higher degradation rates than that observed with the TiO2 NTAs. The kinetic constants of the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min for RhB removal were 0.00395, 0.00717, 0.00905, 0.01441, 0.00566 and 0.00457 min−1, respectively (Fig. S9†). Obviously, the kinetic constants of photocatalytic RhB degradation using the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs as photocatalysts were significantly higher than that of RhB self-degradation (0.00039 min−1), and the kinetic constant of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 was 3.7 times higher than that of the TiO2 NTAs, indicating that TiO2 NTAs anchored with CDs can significantly enhance photocatalytic activity under simulated solar light irradiation. Fig. 7b shows the RhB removal efficiencies tested with the same CDs/TiO2 NTAs for 5 repeated photocatalytic degradation cycles under the same conditions. An RhB removal efficiency of 91.4% was retained after 5 repeated cycles, only slightly decreased from 93.5% in the first cycle; this demonstrates the excellent photocatalytic stability of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs. Additionally, the photocatalytic degradation of RhB using TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min was performed under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively. The RhB removal efficiency using TiO2 NTAs under UV light irradiation reached 47.5% after 180 min, which is similar to that under full spectrum wavelength light irradiation (Fig. S10a†). Almost no RhB removal was observed under visible light irradiation after 180 min for the TiO2 NTAs used as a photocatalyst, while around 30.8% RhB was removed using the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under the same conditions (Fig. S10a†); the kinetic rate of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs for RhB removal (0.00210 min−1) under visible light irradiation is about 4.4 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 NTAs (0.00048 min−1) (Fig. S10b†), demonstrating the significantly enhanced visible-light activity of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs. In addition, around 62.5% RhB was removed using the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under UV light irradiation for 180 min, which is inferior to that observed with the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under full-spectrum light irradiation for the same time; the kinetic rate of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs for RhB removal under full spectrum light irradiation (0.01441 min−1) for 180 min was 2.6 times higher than that of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under UV light irradiation (0.00557 min−1), indicating that the efficiently enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs results from its greatly promoted visible and NIR light utilization.
 Fig. 7  (a) Photocatalytic degradation of RhB under simulated solar light illumination (100 mW cm−2) using TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively. (b) Photocatalytic degradation of RhB using the same CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min for 5 consecutive cycles under the same conditions. (c) TOC removal efficiencies of photocatalytic RhB degradation using the TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min under simulated solar light illumination (100 mW cm−2), respectively.

Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis is used to study the mineralization level during organism degradation. To confirm the mineralization ability of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs, TOC measurements were performed to study the mineralization level of RhB degradation using the TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min as photocatalysts, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 7c, the TiO2 NTAs show relatively limited TOC removals of 9.8%, 19.2% and 31.6% for 60 min, 120 min and 180 min irradiation, respectively; meanwhile, for the CDs/TiO2 NTAs, TOC removal efficiencies of 20.3% and 38.5% were obtained after 60 min and 120 min irradiation, respectively, and more than 50% of TOC was removed after 180 min. Based on these results, it can be seen that RhB has been not only decolorized but also mineralized effectively by the CDs/TiO2 NTAs. Additionally, the stability of the photocatalytic activity is an important factor for a photocatalyst during the photocatalytic degradation process. To study the stability of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs used as a photocatalyst, the TOC removal efficiencies were tested with the same sample for 5 repeated photocatalytic degradation cycles under the same conditions; the results are shown in Fig. 7d. After 5 repeated cycles, the TOC removal efficiency remained 49.7%, only a slight decrease compared with 52.6% in the first cycle; this indicates that the CDs/TiO2 NTAs display excellent photocatalytic stability during the process of pollutant photodegradation.
In addition, to investigate the photocatalytic performance of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs for aromatic organic pollutants, photocatalytic degradation of phenol was tested under simulated solar irradiation using the TiO2 NTAs and the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min; the results are shown in Fig. S11.† As shown in Fig. S11a,† around 73.3% phenol was eliminated by the CDs/TiO2 NTAs after 180 min, while only 35.5% of the phenol was removed when using the TiO2 NTAs with the same irradiation time; nearly no removal was observed for phenol self-degradation, indicating that the TiO2 NTAs can be used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of aromatic organic pollutants and that TiO2 NTAs anchored with CDs show significantly improved photocatalytic degradation efficiency of pollutants under the same conditions. The stability of the photocatalytic activity was also investigated for phenol photocatalytic degradation using one sample (Fig. S11b†). The phenol removal efficiency decreased only slightly after 5 repeated photocatalytic degradation cycles, suggesting excellent photocatalytic stability of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs during the process of degradation of aromatic organic pollutants. In addition, efficient TOC removal efficiency was realized in the photocatalytic degradation of phenol using the TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs (Fig. S11c†). The TOC removal efficiency of phenol reached 55.7% after a photocatalytic degradation time of 180 min, while for the TiO2 NTAs, only 22.5% TOC removal was obtained under the same conditions; this reveals that the use of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs as a photocatalyst can significantly enhance the mineralization efficiency of organic pollutants during the photocatalytic degradation process. Furthermore, the TOC removal efficiency remained at around 52.0%, only a slight decrease compared with 55.7% in the first cycle (Fig. S11d†); this further demonstrates the excellent photocatalytic stability of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs during the photodegradation process of aromatic organic pollutants.
Radical and hole-trapping experiments were performed to study the photocatalytic degradation mechanism over CDs/TiO2 NTAs. Ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA, hole scavenger), tert-butanol (t-BuOH, hydroxyl radical quencher) and ascorbic acid (superoxide quencher) were added to the phenol solution, respectively, to investigate the impacts of possible radicals generated by CDs/TiO2 NTAs; the results are shown in Fig. 8a. It can be seen from the results that around 64.4% phenol was removed under simulated solar irradiation for 180 min when using EDTA as a scavenger for holes, and around 53.8% phenol was eliminated under the same conditions when ascorbic acid (1 mM) was used as a scavenger for superoxide radicals; meanwhile, the phenol degradation efficiency significantly decreased to 39.6% within 180 min when 1 mM t-BuOH was employed as a typical hydroxyl radical quencher. The above results reveal that hydroxyl radicals play an important role in the photocatalytic degradation process of phenol, while superoxide radicals and holes have weaker effects on this system.

(c) Schematic of the charge separation and pollutant degradation processes using CDs/TiO2 NTAs under solar light irradiation. 
Moreover, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trap technique (with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)) was employed to detect the photo-generated reactive oxygen species over the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under simulated solar light irradiation; the results are shown in Fig. 8b. From the DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra, four peaks of DMPO-OH˙ with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 can be observed; meanwhile, no signals were observed in dark conditions, revealing that hydroxyl radicals were generated on the electrode under solar light irradiation. In addition, the superoxide radicals were also examined by the ESR spin-trap technique in methanolic media; the characteristic peaks can be observed in the ESR spectrum of DMPO-O2− under solar light irradiation, while no signals are observed in the dark. This indicates that superoxide radicals were generated on the CDs/TiO2 NTAs under solar light irradiation. These results are in accordance with the spectra reported by previous researchers.61,68 Based on the previous results and discussion, the photocatalytic degradation process can be described as follows from eqn (4)–(9): CDs + hγ → CDs(e + h)(4) TiO2 + hγ → TiO2(e + h)(5) CDs(e) + TiO2 → CDs + TiO2(e)(6) TiO2(h) + CDs → CDs(h) + TiO2(7) CDs(h) + OH− → CDs(h) + OH˙(8) OH˙ + pollutants → CO2 + H2O(9) TiO2(e) + O2 → TiO2 + O2−(10) O2− + H2O → H2O2 + OH˙(11) H2O2 + e → OH˙ + OH−(12) OH˙ + pollutants → CO2 + H2O(13)
Also, a schematic of the photocatalytic mechanism is depicted in Fig. 8c. CDs and TiO2 can be effectively excited by photons with light irradiation to produce electrons and holes from the CB and VB, respectively (eqn (4) and (5)). The electrons from the CDs quickly transfer to the CB of the TiO2 NTAs because the CB position of the CDs is more negative than that of the TiO2 NTAs (eqn (6)). The holes generated in the VB of the TiO2 NTAs transfer to the CDs, and the accumulated holes on the CDs react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals for pollutant degradation (eqn (7)–(9)). The electrons accumulated on the TiO2 NTAs can reduce oxygen molecules dissolved in water or adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 NTAs to produce superoxide radicals that can eliminate organic pollutants or further react with H2O to generate oxygen species such as H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals (eqn (10) and (11)). Moreover, H2O2 can combine electrons to produce hydroxyl radicals for further pollutant degradation (eqn (12) and (13)). The dual light absorption of CDs and TiO2 NTAs and the unique nanotubular structure promotes interfacial charge transfer and separation in the formed composite; this results in significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance and greatly improved pollutant removal efficiency.
After elucidating the photocatalytic pollutant degradation processes involved in the system, we were able to design a process for photocatalytic water splitting. The performance for water splitting was evaluated under simulated solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2). For the CDs/TiO2 NTAs with different deposition times of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, the H2 production rates were 8.72 μmol cm−2 h−1, 15.50 μmol cm−2 h−1, 23.65 μmol cm−2 h−1, 7.51 and 6.47 μmol cm−2 h−1, respectively, which are higher than that of the TiO2 NTAs (5.42 μmol cm−2 h−1) (Fig. 9a). This indicated that photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen indeed occurred when using the TiO2 NTAs as a photocatalyst and that using the CDs/TiO2 NTAs as a photocatalyst could significantly enhance the photocatalytic water splitting. Fig. 9b shows the average rates of photocatalytic H2 and O2 production for all samples, which agree with the trend of photocurrent measurements under UV, visible and full spectrum light irradiation, respectively. The prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs achieved H2 production rates of 4.58 and 23.65 μmol cm−2 h−1 under visible and full-spectrum light, respectively. Meanwhile, for the TiO2 NTAs, almost no H2 generation could be observed under visible light, and the H2 generation rate obtained under UV light was similar to that under full-spectrum light irradiation. This clearly demonstrates the important contribution of the CDs deposited on the TiO2 NTAs for water splitting under visible and full spectrum wavelength light irradiation. The 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2 clearly demonstrates that TiO2 NTAs and CDs/TiO2 NTAs used as photocatalysts can perfectly drive the water splitting process. Moreover, the CDs/TiO2 NTAs used as a photocatalyst for water splitting showed excellent performance stability in a 10 h durability test (Fig. 9c). This performance greatly exceeds that of many other oxide-based photocatalysts; for example, it is necessary to sacrifice agents for H2 production when using Au–ZnO or Au–Fe2O3 as photocatalysts.69,70 Apparently, the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs used as a photocatalyst can direct water splitting to produce H2 and O2 without the need for sacrificial agents and with excellent durability. Moreover, the photocurrents are stable during 5 repeated H2 collection tests under simulated solar light irradiation (Fig. 9d), further demonstrating the excellent stability of CDs/TiO2 NTAs used as a photocatalyst for water splitting.

(d) The corresponding time-dependent photocurrent profile obtained for the prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs with a deposition time of 20 min during the hydrogen evolution cycles. 
The significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of CDs/TiO2 NTAs in the process of water splitting may result from bonding and interaction between the CDs and the TiO2 NTAs. From the possible mechanism shown in Scheme 2, firstly, TiO2 NTAs hybridized with CDs show an effectively extended range of light response; this may result from the narrowing of the band gap of the composites, and the narrow bandgap may be attributed to the existence of the electronic coupling between the π states of the CDs and the CB of TiO2 or the introduction of new carbon energy levels into the TiO2 band gap to effectively lower the bandgap energy.71,72 Then, a red-shift of light can excite the electrons to transfer to the CB of TiO2. In addition, the up-conversion properties of the CDs can transform long wavelength irradiation light into shorter wavelength emission light;73 as a result, the CDs/TiO2 NTAs can utilize a wider range of wavelength light, even full spectrum wavelength light. Secondly, upon light irradiation, photo-generated electrons in the CB of the CDs can transfer readily to the CB of TiO2 because of the potential difference between the energy bands; these electrons can reduce water for H2 generation. Simultaneously, the generated holes in the VB of TiO2 transfer to the VB of the CDs, and the accumulated holes in the VB of the CDs can be used to oxidize water for O2 generation. Moreover, O2 absorbed on the surface of the CDs can accept electrons to produce superoxide radicals that can oxidize pollutants. Thirdly, the CDs anchored on the TiO2 NTAs can be used as electron reservoirs to trap electrons emitted from the TiO2 NTAs under light irradiation and thus suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs. The synergy of CDs combined with TiO2 NTAs effectively narrows the bandgap of the TiO2 NTAs, which also suppresses the recombination of electron–hole pairs. In addition, the CDs can function as electron scavengers to further suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs, thus significantly enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the CDs/TiO2 NTAs for pollutant degradation and water splitting.

Conclusions
A facile electrochemical deposition method was employed to successfully anchor CDs onto both the inside and outside of TiO2 NTAs. The prepared CDs/TiO2 NTAs with an optimized deposition time show significantly improved photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine TiO2 NTAs in the processes of photocatalytic RhB degradation and water splitting. The excellent stability of the photocatalytic activity of CDs/TiO2 NTAs was demonstrated through 5 repeated cycles of photocatalytic RhB degradation, photocatalytic water splitting and time-dependent photocurrent tests. The significant improvement of the photocatalytic activity for the CDs/TiO2 NTAs arises from the synergistic effect of CDs combined with TiO2 NTAs, which effectively narrows the bandgap of the TiO2 NTA composites and promotes the separation of electron–hole pairs. In brief, this work confirms that CDs can significantly enhance the photocatalytic and chemical activity of TiO2 NTAs, thereby providing a facile synthetic strategy to synthesize heterogeneous photocatalysts that have promising applications in environmental reclamation and energy harvesting.
