    , Accepted 8th July 2013First published on 9th July 2013AbstractWe report the design, synthesis and photoelectrochemical characterization of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) oxygen evolution catalyst modified heterojunction photoelectrodes consisting of one-dimensional WO3 nanorods (1D-WO3) and highly porous BiVO4 layers. The 1D-WO3 nanorods were prepared by the decomposition of the tetrabutylammonium decatungstate precursor in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) as a binding agent. The porous BiVO4 layers were spray deposited using a surfactant assisted metal–organic decomposition method. The Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalyst was deposited onto the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO heterojunction electrode using a photoassisted electrodeposition method. The Co-Pi catalyst modified heterojunction electrodes exhibited a sustained enhancement in the photocurrent compared to the unmodified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO heterojunction electrodes. The improved photoelectrochemical properties profited from the enhanced charge carrier separation achieved through the integration of highly porous BiVO4 layers on top of 1D-WO3 nanorods and from the superior kinetics due to the presence of the Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalyst on top of BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO heterojunction electrodes.
Introduction
Fossil fuels have been satisfying the majority of the world's energy needs; nevertheless their consumption is associated with the inevitable emission of undesirable CO2 into the atmosphere. As is well known, this results in extreme transformation of the Earth's climate as well as other environmental concerns. To reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and to restrain the CO2 emissions, ever-increasing interest has been directed towards sustainable energy resources.1–3 Among various approaches, photoelectrochemical (PEC) energy conversion, a solar energy to chemical energy conversion process, has been considered a “holy grail” of sustainable energy research.4 It could be a cost-effective direct method for the production of renewable fuel and energy storage.5–7 A revival of interest in this research area is based on improving the PEC efficiency through efficient design and synthesis of semiconductor electrodes that absorb visible light, efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers and exhibit better kinetics for water oxidation. The metal oxide semiconductors having O 2p orbitals contributing to the valence band and these bands being fixed at deeply positive potentials are very effective as photoelectrodes for the PEC water oxidation process.8 Among various metal oxides, tungsten oxide (WO3) is extensively investigated as a photoelectrode due to its excellent activity under visible light with a relatively low band gap (Eg ∼ 2.6 eV) for PEC water oxidation.9–12 However, relatively short hole diffusion lengths in the order of 150 nm and the low absorption coefficients for photons with energies close to the band gap impede the water oxidation activity of this indirect band gap semiconductor.13,14 One approach to improve the efficiency of these photoelectrodes is to design nanostructured electrodes as they offer enhanced absorption through extensive light scattering.15 The design of nanostructured photoelectrodes has been the focus of considerable research and found to improve the overall PEC efficiency. In particular, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured semiconductors are gaining much attention due to their unique optical and electrical properties including enhanced light-scattering, faster electron transport, photoconductivity, nano-piezoelectricity and field emission properties.16–18 Design of nanostructured photoelectrodes with 1D morphologies (nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires etc.) improves the charge collection efficiency of the photoelectrode as the photogenerated electrons and holes will have to travel shorter distances to reach both end interfaces of the photoelectrode. Several other strategies have been explored to enhance the photooxidation activities of WO3 based photoelectrodes. Of particular interest is the design of heterojunction configuration by coupling a suitable semiconductor that has higher valence and conduction band levels with respect to those band levels of WO3 respectively.10 This approach leads to electron and hole movements between the two components in opposite directions and consequently improves the photo-generated charge collection efficiency.19,20 In addition, if the integrated semiconductor component has a small energy gap compared to WO3, then the introduction of such a semiconductor leads to effective solar utilization. BiVO4 satisfying the above aspects would be a good option in the design of a BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction configuration.21–24 The activity of the BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction electrode can be further enhanced through an improved electrode–electrolyte interfacial area. Hence, the ideal way to design a 1D-WO3 based heterojunction electrode configuration with enhanced efficiency would be the integration of a porous BiVO4 layer with 1D-WO3. The introduction of porous morphology enhances the electrode–electrolyte interfacial area due to the significantly enhanced permeation of the electrolyte through the porous structure.20 Beyond the intellectual challenge of designing a heterojunction electrode system with appropriately thermodynamically favourable band edge-offsets, it is also important to address the implication of competing surface accumulation of the photo-generated holes at the electrode–electrolyte interface. This effect can be unravelled by improving the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface through integration of an oxygen evolution catalyst.25 In addition, the presence of the oxygen evolution catalyst lowers the activation energy required for oxygen evolution and minimizes the overpotential required for water oxidation.26 Therefore, the integration of an oxygen evolution catalyst is necessary to significantly improve the overall efficiency of these heterojunction electrodes. Especially, to make the overall catalyst coated heterojunction photoelectrode design economically viable, the selection of a non-noble metal based catalyst is vital. Earlier research including our recent studies on the earth-abundant element based cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) oxygen evolution catalyst after Nocera et al.27 shows that the association of this catalyst with various semiconductor electrodes can significantly enhance the water oxidation kinetics and efficiencies.28–36 Therefore, it is important to consider the synergistic advantages of 1D nanomaterials, porous materials and oxygen evolution catalysts in order to design a heterojunction electrode with the intended properties such as fast kinetics and enhanced PEC activity at low over-potentials.
In the present study, a pyrolysis method was used to deposit 1D-WO3 nanorods on F-doped tin oxide (FTO). In our previous study we reported the formation of high yield WO3 nanorods using a single precursor (tetrabutylammonium decatungstate) pyrolysis method under a controlled atmosphere. In order to spray deposit these WO3 nanorods onto the FTO we have used poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with an average molecular weight (Mn) ∼ 1000 as a binding agent in the precursor solution.9 To prepare BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO, a highly porous BiVO4 layer was deposited on top of 1D-WO3/FTO using a surfactant assisted metal–organic decomposition method. Further, the photo-assisted electrodeposition method was used to deposit the Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) onto the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode. A detailed PEC study revealed that the Co-Pi modified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO performs well as a photoanode in terms of the cathodic shift of the photo-driven oxygen evolution onset potential and enhanced incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and cathodic shift in the onset potential for water oxidation in the dark compared to BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO.
Experimental section
The 1D-WO3 film was deposited onto F-doped SnO2 coated transparent glass (FTO; 20–23 Ω □−1) via a spray deposition method using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (((C4H9)4N)4W10O32) as the precursor. The ((C4H9)4N)4W10O32 precursor was synthesized as described elsewhere37 by using tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBABr) (99% Sigma-Aldrich) and Na2WO4·2H2O (99%, Fisher Chemical) as the starting materials. In a typical procedure, a clear solution of tungstic acid preformed using sodium tungstate and concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to aqueous tetrabutylammonium bromide solution. This resulted in the precipitation of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate. The white precipitate was washed with boiling water and ethanol, filtered, dried and recrystallized in hot dimethyl formamide to give yellow crystals of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate. The precursor solution for spray coating was produced by dissolving 0.2 g of PEG (average molecular weight (Mn) ∼ 1000; Sigma-Aldrich) as a binder using a vortexer followed by the addition of 2 g of ((C4H9)4N)4W10O32. The solution was further vortexed until the precursors completely dissolved. The obtained relatively viscous precursor solution was spray-coated onto FTO using a Grex Tritium double action air brush and consequently annealed at 450 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 3 h followed by further calcination for 3 h by replacing N2 gas with O2 gas to produce highly crystalline 1D-WO3/FTO. The spray coating and calcination steps were repeated until the desired thickness of (∼2 μm) was achieved. The porous BiVO4/FTO electrode was prepared by spray deposition of a precursor solution in the presence of a structure directing agent using a Grex Tritium double action air brush and consequently annealed at 500 °C for 5 h in an air atmosphere. The precursor solution for the deposition of the BiVO4 film was obtained by mixing solutions of Bi, and V in the presence of a structure directing agent. Specifically, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99% trace metal basis, Aldrich) was dissolved in an acetic acid water mixture, followed by addition of 0.3 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). To prepare the V solution, a stoichiometric amount of vanadium(V) tri-i-propoxy oxide (98%, Strem Chemicals) was dissolved in acetylacetone (C5H8O2). The two solutions were mixed in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of Bi to V and stirred for 0.5 h. The spray deposition and calcination steps were repeated to get the desired thickness of ∼2 μm. In order to prepare the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode (thickness ∼ 2 μm), BiVO4 precursor solution was spray deposited on a 1 μm thick 1D-WO3/FTO electrode and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. A Co-Pi OEC layer was photoelectrodeposited (PED) onto as synthesized BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes by the method described previously.14 A three-electrode cell with BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO, Ag/AgCl and Pt mesh as working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively, was used. PED of Co-Pi was performed under 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated illumination at a constant potential (0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in a solution of 0.15 M cobalt nitrate in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7 for 300 s. Shorter or longer deposition times than the optimized deposition time resulted in a decrease in the photocurrent. The resulting Co-Pi modified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes were rinsed with copious DI water and dried under a gentle N2 flow.
The crystal structure of as synthesized electrodes was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips X'pert X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a CARY 5E UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The thicknesses of the electrodes were measured by a profilometer (Tencor® P-10 surface profiler). The surface morphology of the as-synthesized electrodes was analyzed using a FE-SEM, JEOL 7000 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a Philips/FEI CM200 transmission electron microscope. The photocurrent action spectra were collected using a setup consisting of a 100 W tungsten lamp housing with a Photon Technology International (PTI) LPS-220 lamp power supply and an EG&G model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research). Light exiting the PTI SID-101 monochromator was chopped, and an optical filter was used to block any second-order diffraction. The signal was detected using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier using the chopping frequency as a reference. A thermopile detector was positioned in the place of an electrochemical cell to measure the spectra output of the lamp and the monochromator. The voltage output from the thermopile is proportional to the incident power and it was plotted vs. photon energy. To obtain the photon flux from this plot, the photocurrent signal at each wavelength was divided by the energy (eV) of that wavelength. The semiconductor photocurrent spectrum was divided by the photon flux spectra to get a normalized spectrum. In these tests the electrode was held at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and the photocurrent at each wavelength was registered. PEC measurements were carried out at room temperature in a three-electrode cell with a flat glass window using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat interfaced with a computer. 1D-WO3/FTO, BiVO4/FTO, BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO or Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO, were used as the working electrodes, Pt sheet (∼3 cm2) and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) were employed as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All electrodes were back-illuminated through the FTO glass to avoid absorption by the catalyst layer.29 A 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (in pH 7 phosphate buffer) was used as the electrolyte for the PEC measurements. To measure the PEC response, a 300 W Xe arc (Newport Oriel) lamp was used to illuminate the photoelectrodes. A 55 mm diameter water-filled-filter was placed in the beam path between the light source and photoelectrochemical cell to avoid the heating up of the solution due to IR radiation and the output light intensity was set using a GaInP2 reference cell (Eg = 1.8 eV) calibrated to AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA. Dynamic chopped light and steady state linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were scanned in the anodic direction at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. IPCE measurements were performed in a three-electrode setup, 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 7 phosphate buffered) electrolyte using a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Newport Oriel), integrated with a parabolic reflector, a collimated lens assembly, passing through an Action Research Corporation SpectraPro-150 computer-controlled monochromator. Sample photocurrent data were normalized to the output of a calibrated silicon photodiode. For stability measurements, a bias potential of 0.63 V vs. Pt counter electrode was applied in a two-electrode setup and the photoelectrodes were illuminated with calibrated AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light from a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Newport Oriel) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 7 phosphate buffered).
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of the 1D-WO3/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes obtained from a spray deposition method were examined by XRD analysis. For comparison, the XRD pattern obtained from FTO is also shown (Fig. 1a).

The XRD patterns of all electrodes exhibited strong peaks corresponding to SnO2 originating from the FTO substrate. The crystal phase of the WO3 in 1D-WO3/FTO was identified to be monoclinic (JCPDS Card No. 71-2141). The bare BiVO4 electrode exhibited a monoclinic scheelite type crystal structure (JCPDS Card No. 14-0688). After deposition and annealing of a BiVO4 layer on top of 1D-WO3/FTO, the heterojunction BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes exhibited peaks corresponding to BiVO4 and 1D-WO3 indicating the absence of any new compound formation. The optical absorption properties of as-synthesized photoelectrodes were probed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The 1D-WO3/FTO exhibited an absorption edge at 472 nm, commensurate with an indirect band gap of 2.62 eV estimated from photocurrent action spectroscopy (Fig. S1a, ESI†). For the bare BiVO4/FTO electrode, the absorption edge was at 515 nm and the corresponding band gap was found to be 2.40 eV (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode exhibited an absorption edge around 517 nm.
The surface morphologies of the 1D-WO3/FTO photoelectrode before and after deposition of BiVO4 layers is presented in Fig. 2.

The as deposited 1D-WO3/FTO electrode consisted of a distribution of dense one-dimensional nanorods throughout the film (Fig. 2a). The 1D-WO3 film was scratched from the surface and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy to get further insights into the structure and morphology of WO3 nanorods. The dimensions of nanorods were found to vary in the ranges of 94–570 nm and 7–54 nm in length and width respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). The precursor ((C4H9)4N)4W10O32 is composed of lamellar aggregates of tungstate anions encapsulated in an array of TBA groups and maintains a long range self-assembly.38,39 These encapsulation layers would act as a growth controller, as well as an agglomeration inhibitor during the calcination and crystallization processes resulting in the formation of 1D growth of WO3. Further, the surface morphology analysis of BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes unveiled a highly porous structure for the top BiVO4 layer. The removal of the micellar cores of surfactant (SDS) from the micellar–inorganic units at high temperatures allows the formation of porous morphology.29 The introduction of porous morphology improves the electrode–electrolyte interfacial area due to significantly enhanced permeation of electrolyte through the porous structure. This critical characteristic feature of the porous electrode assists in improving the water splitting efficiency as the photogenerated holes will have to traverse less bulk material to be collected at the electrolyte interface and thus have a lower chance of recombination before participating in the electrochemical reaction. Consequently, the electron–hole recombination is reduced during photo-oxidation reactions. SEM images of 1D-WO3/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes obtained at high resolution are shown in Fig. S3, ESI.†
In order to assess the performance of a photoanode, it is important to evaluate the photocurrent density and the onset potential for the photocurrent. The effect of spray deposited porous BiVO4 films on the photocurrent generation of the 1D-WO3/FTO electrode was investigated by examining PEC responses of the heterojunction BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode, and 1D-WO3/FTO and BiVO4/FTO electrodes in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Typical photocurrent vs. potential response under chopped light illumination is shown in Fig. 3a.

All the three electrodes (1D-WO3/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO) generated anodic photocurrents upon illumination indicating n-type character and the ability for water oxidation. The BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode exhibited enhanced photocurrents compared to either 1D-WO3/FTO or BiVO4/FTO electrodes in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The photocurrent of the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode was significantly improved, so as to reach 2.45 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This indicates the effective photoinduced charge carrier separation brought about by band-edge offsets in the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode as no significant difference in optical absorption between the BiVO4/FTO and the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes is observed (Fig. 1b). The effective participation of accumulated holes at the interface of the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode towards water oxidation is indispensable to enhance the kinetics and to further improve the overall water oxidation activity. Therefore, it is important to study the PEC water oxidation activity of the heterojunction electrode modified with the oxygen evolution catalyst. The chopped light I–V studies on the PED Co-Pi on BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode show overall higher photocurrent density in the same bias range compared to the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode. In addition, typical steady-state photocurrents (non-chopped) vs. potential characteristics of Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO and BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes show a negative shift of ∼165 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in the onset potential for the Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode compared to the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode (Fig. S4a, ESI†). The shift in the onset potential towards the negative direction can be attributed to the catalytic ability of Co-Pi. Further, analyzing the current–potential curves under dark conditions (Fig. S4b, ESI†) it is noticed that the Co-Pi modified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode exhibited a negative shift (∼240 mV) in the onset potential for oxygen evolution compared to the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode. This indicates that the water oxidation kinetics of the Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode is considerably enhanced compared to that of the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode. Co-Pi deposition on the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode facilitated the charge transfer across the electrode–electrolyte interface and allowed a more facile pathway for holes to quickly take part in the water oxidation process.
Based on the present observations, a schematic illustration of the charge transfer process at the Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode for water oxidation is depicted in Fig. 3b. The flat band potentials of nanostructured WO3 and BiVO4 were found to be −0.19 V and −0.58 V (vs. Ag/AgCl measured at pH 6.6) respectively.22 In general, the flat band potential is the Fermi level, when the band is flat (no bending, no electric field) and is always close to the conduction band edge in an n-type semiconductor. The photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of BiVO4 can easily transfer to the conduction band of 1D-WO3 due to the existence of a relatively negative conduction band position of BiVO4 compared to that of the conduction band of 1D-WO3. This effect in turn reduces the probability of recombination. Moreover, the relatively positive valence band of 1D-WO3 acts a barrier to any holes in the BiVO4 and prevents them from diffusing to the FTO. However, this effect initiates the accumulation of holes at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The presence of the Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalyst improves the hole transfer at the interface and makes the overall water oxidation process efficient.
In order to assess the dynamics of water oxidation, photocurrent vs. time measurements were performed on Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO and BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolytes (Fig. 4) at different bias potentials 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) while the illumination was turned on and off. The transfer of holes from the valence band of WO3 to the valence band of BiVO4 would reduce their oxidizing power due to the latter acquiring a less positive electrochemical potential. This results in a lower driving force for electron transfer. One expected indication of this would be the presence of transient spikes (photocurrent decay) for BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes at low applied potentials. These transient spikes are indicative of more significant surface recombination due to the build-up of holes and slower charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface. To illustrate the opposite effect, one can observe an obvious difference in the transient behaviour (no spikes) for Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes.
 Fig. 4  Transient photocurrent densities measured with chopped light (100 mW cm−2) for BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO (i) and Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO (ii) electrodes at 0.0 V (a); 0.2 V (b); 0.4 V (c) and 0.6 V (d) vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 7) aqueous solution. 
This suggests that Co-Pi modification improved the water oxidation kinetics at the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode surface. In addition, the photocurrents were enhanced by 4.0, 2.1, 1.3 and 1.2 times at 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 V respectively for the Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO compared to the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. This suggests that the photocurrent enhancement observed for Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO is more significant at lower potentials due to the catalytic ability of Co-Pi.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) analyses were performed on 1D-WO3/FTO, BiVO4/FTO, BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO and Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes at a potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  IPCE plots of 1D-WO3/FTO, BiVO4/FTO, BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO and Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes measured at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 7) aqueous solution. 
The enhanced IPCE values for the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode under the entire functional wavelength region over either the 1D-WO3/FTO or BiVO4/FTO electrode infers that the formation of BiVO4/1D-WO3 heterojunction effectively improves the photo-induced charge carrier separation and consequently enhances the solar light conversion efficiency. In addition, the deposition of Co-Pi further enhanced the IPCE of BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode (44% at 440 nm) compared to the unmodified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode (32% at 440 nm). The Co-Pi modified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode exhibited superior IPCE performance (44% at 0.5 V) at 440 nm compared to the IPCE values reported for WO3/Mo-doped BiVO4 (21% at 0.6 V),21 BiVO4/WO3 (36% at 0.7 V),22 nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 (31% at 0.5 V),23 BiVO4/WO3 (19% at 1.0 V),24 and Ag/BiVO4/WO3 (10% at 0.4 V)25 electrodes. This suggests that Co-Pi OEC significantly enhances the PEC water oxidation activity of the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO heterojunction electrode. Finally, durability measurements were performed on the Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode under AM 1.5 (∼1 sun) illumination at 0.63 V bias vs. the Pt counter electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 over 24 h (Fig. S5, ESI†). The Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode attained a stable photocurrent within few hours and remained fairly stable over 24 h (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The durability analysis was extended further for another 24 h (Fig. S5b, ESI†) and the photocurrent started to decay after 42 h of continuous illumination. The activity loss for BiVO4 based photoelectrodes over time was attributed to the photocorrosion of vanadium into the electrolyte.40 The enhanced stability of Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode could be attributed to the enhanced hole transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface in the presence of Co-Pi and to the Co-Pi catalyst interaction with the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode. However, a detailed study on these is beyond the scope of this article, and the generality of these findings remains to be investigated and will be published as a separate article.
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a heterojunction electrode system made of 1D-WO3 nanorods and highly porous BiVO4 layers for PEC water splitting application. The 1D-WO3/FTO electrodes were prepared by a spray deposition method using the ((C4H9)4N)4W10O32 precursor in the presence of the PEG binding agent. A BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO heterojunction electrode was designed by a surfactant assisted metal–organic decomposition method. A sustained enhancement in the photocurrent density was achieved for Co-Pi OEC modified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO due to synergistic advantages of 1D-WO3, porous BiVO4 and Co-Pi OEC. In addition, the kinetics of BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes have been improved by the Co-Pi modification. Co-Pi/BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes exhibited ∼240 mV shift in the onset potential for oxygen evolution compared to the BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The Co-Pi OEC modified BiVO4/1D-WO3/FTO electrodes exhibited good stability for water oxidation over 24 h under illumination.
