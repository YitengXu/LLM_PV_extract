    AbstractA series of new organic D–π–A dyes, A1, A2-H and A2-F, possessing a remarkably high absorption extinction coefficient of ε > 5.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at peak wavelength were synthesized, among which, A2-F having a key fluorine substitution attains excellent all solid-state DSSC performance, with optimized parameters of η = 4.86%, JSC = 7.52 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.91 V, and FF = 0.71.
Due to the growing demand for green energy, in combination with latent depletion of fossil fuels, there has been an intensive search for cost-effective photovoltaics since the first development of solar cells in the 1950s.1 Among the solar cells that have been under intensive investigation, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in particular, with a power conversion efficiency (over 11%) comparable to amorphous silicon solar cells,2 seem promising to offer a solution to the low-cost and large-area photovoltaic applications. The conventional DSSC is mainly composed of mesoporous TiO2 coated with light-absorbing dyes and filled with electrolyte made of I−/I3− redox couple dissolved in acetonitrile.3 Such a DSSC configuration, though having reached high efficiency especially with Ru(II) based sensitizers4 and metal-free organic dyes,5 unfortunately encounters some inevitable inferiority. Of prime concern are the evaporation and leakage of liquid electrolytes, which seriously limit device stability as well as long-term operation. Alternatively, solid-state DSSCs, for which the electrolyte is replaced by hole conductors such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), CuSCN, or even conducting polymers, have received considerable attention.6–9 Few solid-state DSSCs with metal-free organic dyes have shown encouraging results with the power conversion efficiency (η) exceeding 4%.10–12
As for the design of solid-state DSSC dyes, we expected it to fulfil the general requirements such as strong absorption in the visible-to-near infrared region, band-gap matching (e.g. type II energy gap arrangement versus TiO2) and avoiding solid-state packing, etc. One key factor is to increase the molar extinction coefficient in the visible region. The associated device can thus harvest solar irradiation efficiently, so that thinner TiO2 films can be used to circumvent the inferiority of electron/hole mobility in solid electrolytes.
Herein, we report the strategic design, synthesis, and characterization of a new series of donor–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) sensitizers, A1, A2-H and A2-F, (see Scheme 1) for fabricating high performance solid-state DSSCs with hole-conductor spiro-MeOTAD. The parent A1 employs triphenylamine, 4,4′-dihexylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b]dithiophene, and cyanoacrylic acid as the electron donor, spacer and acceptor, respectively.13–15 The intention of attaching the dialkyl chain onto the cyclopentadithophene spacer is to avoid aggregation of sensitizers upon absorbing on the TiO2 surface. An additional phenylene group is then incorporated, forming A2-H, with the aim of further elongating the π-conjugation. We thus expect an increase of absorption cross section and/or spectral red-shifting for A2-H (cf. A1). More importantly, we further designed A2-F, the structure of which resembles that of A2-H, except for a fluoro substituent being intentionally introduced in close proximity to the cyanoacrylic anchor. Thus, in addition to its common function to act as an electron withdrawing group, we anticipate the possible interaction among fluorine, TiO2 nanoparticles and the hole conducting layer. For this approach, A2-H also can be exploited as a control, having the parent phenylene moiety to eliminate any additional electrostatic interaction. Despite fluorine-containing compounds having been widely applied in numerous cutting-edge applications (vide infra),16 the fluoro substitution acting as a key component in DSSCs has not been reported, at least to our knowledge.

The synthetic routes to the titled sensitizers are schematically depicted in Scheme 1. The 4,4′-dihexylcyclopentadithiophene is used as the key starting material, in which the cyclopentadithiophene moiety enforces a good planarity, fulfilling the prime requirement of increasing the transition moment, i.e. the absorption cross section. Details of the synthetic procedures as well as selected spectral data such as mass, NMR and elemental analysis data are provided in the supporting information.†
The solid-state DSSCs are prepared using a modification of literature procedures.10,17,18 Detailed fabrication of solid-state devices and measurement of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency values are summarized in the supporting information.†Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of all dyes in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol, while the corresponding absorption spectra on mesoporous TiO2 thin film are displayed in the inset. The A1 sensitizer shows an absorption maximum at 477 nm, with an unusually high extinction coefficient ε ∼ 51660 ± 120 M−1 cm−1, which is ascribed to the ππ* charge transfer transition (CT) originating from the triphenylamine entity and part of cyclopentadithiophene to the electron accepting cyanoacrylic acid. Supplementary support of this viewpoint is provided in the computational approach (see ESI†). On the other hand, A2-H and A2-F exhibit a slightly higher energy absorption band maximized at ∼450 nm and ∼460 nm, but with similar extinction coefficient of 52560 ± 130 M−1 cm−1 and 53740 ± 130 M−1 cm−1, respectively.

Comparing A1, the blue shift of peak wavelength for A2-H and A2-F seems against the supposed reduction of energy gap upon phenyl π-elongation. This converse effect is especially significant for A2-H, being blue shifted by ∼25 nm versus that of A-1. The result may be rationalized by the non-coplanar cyclopentadithiophene versus phenylene (or thiophene-phenylene) configuration in A2-H (A2-F), resulting in a reduction of π-conjugation in solution. For A2-F, such an effect is more or less compensated by the addition of an electron withdrawing fluoro substituent, giving a similar peak wavelength to that of A1. Upon being deposited on the TiO2 surface, however, A2-H shows an appreciable red-shift compared to that in solution (see Fig. 1 and inset), indicating its preference toward more planarity due to the space confinement in the solid film.
Owing to their remarkably high absorption extinction coefficient, in view of practical application, we thus bypassed liquid-electrolyte DSSCs and made attempts to prepare the solid-state DSSCs, which were fabricated employing the title sensitizers and with an effective area of 0.04 cm2. The optimized characteristics (i.e., 1.6 μm thickness for TiO2 NP provided by Eternal Chemical Co., Ltd.) under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the cell made with sensitizer A1, A2-H and A2-F shows an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 3.62%, 3.69% and 4.86%, a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 6.37 mA cm−2, 6.79 mA cm−2 and 7.52 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.80 V, 0.83 V and 0.91 V, and fill factor FF of 0.71, 0.65 and 0.71, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the respective IPCE photocurrent action spectra under short circuit conditions. Note that in this approach we follow a general protocol for preparation of small cells (0.04 cm2). Upon increasing the cell surface area the efficiency of cell performance should commonly decrease.

Upon insertion of a phenylene or fluorophenylene group into A1, forming A2-H or A2-F, JSC is improved by 6.6% and 18.1% (cf. A1), respectively. Such enhancement can be rationalized by the rise of IPCE (see Fig. 3) as result of the higher molar extinction coefficient of both A2 series at the UV-to-near visible region (350–450 nm) and around the onset of 550–650 nm. This result manifests the role of phenylene (or fluorophenylene) on harvesting solar irradiation via broadened spectral coverage and higher absorptivity. While VOC for A2-H is even slightly better than that of A1, VOC of 0.91V in A2-F is significantly higher than that of A1 and A2-H by 13.8% and 9.6%, respectively. The combination of JSC and VOC improves power conversion efficiency for A2-F by 34.2% and 31.7% with respect to that of A1 and A2-H. Fluorine substitution obviously provides a significant contribution for promoting the cell performance. It is thus crucial to mull possible mechanisms over such a “fluorine-substitution” effect. Firstly, the fluorine substituents are known to lower both the HOMO and LUMO levels.19 Moreover, introduction of the fluorophenylene group may increase the spatial separation between the TiO2 photoanode and the triphenylamine unit of the sensitizer (cf. A1, A2-H, and A2-F). The net result is to improve the electron–hole separation as well as reducing the dark current, giving higher VOC.
In yet another approach, the significantly different VOC between A2-H and A2-F, in combination with high electronegativity on the fluorine atom, leads us to wonder whether there exists any intimate F…H bonding between the fluorine substituent in A2-F and proton absorbed on the TiO2 surface. Supported by various spectroscopic methods such as IR and Raman spectroscopy,20–22 it has been well established that the carboxylic group, upon anchoring onto TiO2, still holds proton in proximity. The positive charge of proton then decreases the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in the reduction of VOC.23,24 We thus carried out the computation simulation (see ESI for detail†) in an attempt to verify this proposal. As a result, the geometry optimization of A2-F anchoring on the TiO2 nanocrystallines that consist of 38 Ti atoms and stoichiometry ratio of oxygen atom is shown in Fig. S3 (see ESI†). Unfortunately, as indicated by wide separation between F atom and H+ ion of >4.5 Å, the proposed cooperative hydrogen bonding can thus be eliminated.
Alternatively, on the one hand, the electronegative F atom and its small polarizability tends to avert the hole transport molecules possessing high HOMO energy, i.e. the low electron affinity. The net effect may consequently suppress charge recombination between spiro-MeOTAD and TiO2. Moreover, during the fabrication of solid-state DSSCs, addition of lithium salt into the blend of hole conductor is inevitable.10 It is thus plausible that the ortho-fluoro substituent in A2-F attracts this lithium ion to a position adjacent to the TiO2 surface. Accordingly, an increase of the electron diffusion length in TiO2 is expected, resulting in better electron collection. The combination of these two factors should account for the increase of VOC as well as the overall cell performance.
In conclusion, we thus report a series of new organic dyes with remarkably high absorptivity suited for the fabrication of all solid-state DSSCs. Among these dyes, A2-F possessing adjacent cyanoacrylic acid and fluorophenylene renders the conversion efficiency as high as 4.86%. Obviously, the fluoro-substitution serves as the key factor for improving the device performance, the role of which is to avert spiro-MeOTAD and instead to attract Li+ toward the TiO2 surface, resulting in a significant increase of e.g. VOC and hence the superior performance. Determined by the gap between the quasi Fermi level (−0.4/−0.5 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE) of TiO2 under illumination and the first oxidation potential of spiro-MeOTAD (0.81 V vs. NHE), a theoretical maximum of VOC 1.2–1.3 V could be reached for these solid-state DSSCs.12 Thus, via the ingenious design of fluorine substitution, further increase of VOC should be of great importance. This may open a new chapter for fluorine chemistry in the field of solar energy relevant research.
