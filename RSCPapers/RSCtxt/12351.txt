    , Accepted 22nd March 2013First published on 28th March 2013AbstractInkjet printing is an attractive patterning technology due to the mildness, simplicity, low-cost and large-scale production, which has become increasingly accepted for a variety of industrial and scientific applications. Despite its short history, inkjet printing has exhibited great potential applications in active layer, counter electrodes and hole transporting layers of polymer solar cells. This astonishing achievement is the subject of this article, which reviews the developments in inkjet printed active layer, counter electrodes and hole transporting layers of polymer solar cells in the last five years. Polymer solar cells evolve in an exponential manner in the key areas of power conversion efficiency. In this review, we summarized briefly the effect of inkjet printing condition on efficiency and also prospected the development trend of inkjet printed polymer solar cells in the future.
1 Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted more and more attentions since flexible, lightweight and roll-to-roll production.1,2 Especially, PSCs can be fabricated easily and inexpensively by employing cost-effective techniques, for instance inkjet,3 screen printing,4 slot-die,5 gravure6 and spray coating.7 These solution deposit techniques usually have advantages of the mildness, simplicity, low-cost and large-scale production and have been adopted to successfully prepare active layer of PSCs.2,8 The common solution deposit techniques applied in PSCs are spin coating, doctor blading and so on.2,8–10 However, the spin coating or blading processes are not ideal techniques for exploring the full potential for the production of PSCs due to waste products, environmental pollution and difficulties in patterning. Moreover, spin coating and doctor blading are not roll-to-roll production when preparing flexible PSCs. These problems mean that new solution deposit techniques are needed to improve performance of PSCs.
Recently, inkjet printing technology as a fabrication tool for highly efficient polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells have been reported due to advantages of the mildness, simplicity, low-cost and large-scale production and have been adopted to successfully prepare active layer, conducting electrodes and hole translate layers of PSCs.11–43 Despite all the studies done so far in this field, it is quite normal that most of the work done so far has been devoted to the development and optimization of the effect rather than to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the inkjet printing process. In addition to this, the PCE of inkjet printing PSCs (3.7%) is far lower than the value (10.0%) of PSCs.25,44
The scope of this paper is to discuss some mechanistic aspects of the physical process between inkjet printing process and performance of PSCs, which are plausible and in line with earlier and new findings. The proposed discussion will give an explanation for the enhancing and quenching PCE of PSCs prepared by the inkjet printing technology. Although, some parts of the explanation were reported earlier, here the whole explanation will be introduced to a broader community for the first time. It may be a help for further improving the performance of PSCs prepared by inkjet printing technology.
2 Inkjet printing process
2.1 The inkjet printer for fabrication of PSCs
The experiment set-up in inkjet printing technologies can be obtained from the market, e.g. Dimatix DMP-2831 (Fujifilm Dimatix, Inc, USA),12-15 Pixdro LP50 (OTB Solar-Roth & Rau, Netherlands),17 UJ2100 and OmniJet 200 (Unijet, Korea)16 as shown in Scheme 1. The main features of these inkjet printers are summarized and compared as shown Table 1. According to the Table 1, the main features of these inkjet printers are similar, and the performance of inkjet printing PSCs with variation of machine type is little different. Recently, the commercial inkjet printers (a Ceraprinter X serie, Ceradrop, France) was also used for fabrication of PSCs.43 The Ceraprinter X series using 128 nozzle heads is different from others commercial inkjet printers as shown in Scheme 1. It shows high-speed inkjet printing for fabrication of PSCs. Furthermore, the large scale (3.7 cm2 active area) PSCs shows high PCE of 3.3% compared with a small scale (typically 0.1 cm2 active area) with laboratory-scale 16 nozzle printer.43 So, the effect of inkjet printers on fabrication of polymer solar cell should be investigated in detail. However, there are few works reporting it.

The experiment set-up in inkjet printing technologies can also be designed and prepared by ours as shown in Scheme 2.17–19 Microfab is the equipment by a drop-on-demand that the printer head sprayed by the pressure using a piezoelectric element that is equipped. The used printer head (MJ-AT-0120 and AD-K-50118,19) is produced by Microfab Technologies, Inc. It is used as the squeeze mode of piezoelectric. A voltage controller includes a light source controller and a voltage signal controller. A light source controller adjusts a delaying time of light emitting diode used as lighting and a voltage signal controller adjusts the width, size and frequency of signal supplied to the printer head. The orifice of diameter is connected to an ink store and a voltage controller and the ink droplet with a diameter below 100 μm is sprayed. The diameter of ink droplet is controlled by a voltage and a waveform applied to actuator.11 Charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is used for observation and recording of formation and movement of ink droplet, and spraying process of ink droplet can be directly observed through a monitor.

2.2 The inkjet printing process for fabrication of PSCs
Inkjet printing is a material-conserving deposition technique used for liquid phase materials. These materials, or inks, consist of a solute dissolved or otherwise dispersed in a solvent. The process essentially involves the ejection of a fixed quantity of ink in a chamber, from a nozzle through a sudden, quasi-adiabatic reduction of the chamber volume via piezoelectric action. This sudden reduction sets up a shockwave in the liquid, which causes a liquid drop to eject from the nozzle. The ejected drop falls under action of gravity and air resistance until it impinges on the substrate, spreads under momentum acquired in the motion, and surface tension aided flow along the surface. The drop then dries through solvent evaporation, as shown in Scheme 3.45 The process printing depends ultimately on jetting conditions, the ink, surface energy of substrate, and nozzle diameter. Intuitively, the nozzle diameter should form the fundamental lower bound on the drop size, barring any unusual jetting conditions. Machining of smaller nozzles in inkjet cartridges is possible but it involves more complicated processes, thereby increasing cost. Further, smaller nozzles are easier to clog, thereby reducing the reliability and repeatability of the jetting process. Hence, the development of a printing process that can produce features smaller than the nozzle diameter is desirable. Such a process has been demonstrated by Goghari and Chandra46 for water–glycerin mixtures with intermediate concentrations. They developed a custom drop generator that exploits fluid instability to form small droplets. This instability depends on the material parameters satisfying certain conditions. The authors found that the Ohnesorge number:47 (1)
where μ, ρ and σ are the viscosity, density, and surface tension of the ink, while d is the nozzle diameter, is a good predictor of when such conditions are satisfied.

3 Results and discussion
Solution processing, low cost, low energy budget and flexible solar cells are keywords associated with PSCs, and through several decades the driving force for research within the field of PSCs has been the huge potential of the technology to enable high throughput production of cheap PSCs. The performance of PSCs prepared by variation of solution processing method (e.g. spin coating, doctor blading and inkjet printing) are summarized and compared as shown in Table 2. It shows that the PCE of inkjet printing PSCs is lower (ca. 3.7%) than that of PSCs prepared by spin coating and doctor blading.15,25 The result is due to that the structure of PSCs and inkjet printing conditions are not optimized. Nevertheless, at the same structure, the PCE (3.3%) of PSCs fabricated by inkjet printing were found to be between 3.5% and 3.7%, competitive with and slightly lower than that of PSCs prepared by the spin coating and doctor blading.39 Furthermore, there is no mask patterning solvents, a reduction in waste products and large-scale roll-to-roll production. So, the inkjet printing technique is an extremely interesting future candidate for fabrication of PSCs in the future.

3.1 Inkjet printing active layer of PSCs
(1) The type of solvent.
It is well-known that PCE of PSCs strongly depends on structure of active layers (e.g. surface morphology and thickness). And then the structure of active layers is determined by the type of solvent with various solution ability, boiling point and surface tension.12,15 As expected, the good solution ability of solvent as active materials (e.g. P3HT and PCBM) is the necessary condition for the inkjet printing technology.13,14 When the P3HT donor and PCBM acceptor has easy gelation at low temperature or are not soluble in a solvent, the solid blend materials in solvent precipitate at the nozzle orifice and do not ensure reliable printing. Up to now, some solvents have been reported in previous works,13–20 for example, chlorobenzene (CB), octane-1,8-dithiol (oDT), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (oDCB), 1-chloronaphthalene (Cl-naph) or tetralene. However, these solvents can not solubilize all polymer donors.14,19 For example, it is found that the high RR-P3HT (98%) is not suitable for inkjet printing at room temperature.15 The fast formation of aggregates shortens the shelf life of the ink and thus, results in low reliability of the printing process, in the formation of inhomogeneous and very rough films with surface roughness up to 70.0 nm, and in a strongly reduced PCE of PSCs. Furthermore, one of the extremely important issues in inkjet printing PSCs is finding suitable inks based on nontoxic/nonpolluting solvents, with water being both the cheapest and most environmentally friendly. But the majority of active materials used in PSCs today do not fulfill this demand as above discussion. So new approaches to inkjet printing processing the active layer need to be developed, in which it is generally processed from aqueous solution.
In addition to this, the type of solvent with various boiling point also pays a key role for the inkjet printing technology.12,16 The solvents with high boiling (b.p. >130 °C) such as chlorobenzene (CB), octane-1,8-dithiol (oDT), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) and so on, is an essential part to develop an ink formulation for inkjet printing PSCs. Since the nozzle orifice is open to the atmosphere, when not printing the solvent will evaporate. During the vaporization of the solvents at the nozzle orifice, the solid blend materials precipitate (P3HT and PCBM) in the jet and the nozzles can be clogged. A high-boiling solvent is used to prevent nozzle clogging of the print head and ensure reliable printing. At the same time, the PCE of PSCs also strongly depends on the boiling point of solvents as shown in Table 3. It clearly shows that the PCE of PSCs increases with increase in boiling point of solvent. The mechanism is shown as following. Firstly, the rate of evaporation of the solvent with low boiling point is high, in which it is not sufficient time for self-organization of the blended P3HT polymer molecules. The poor P3HT crystallinity would result in the formed active layer with a rough and uneven surface. The high roughness restricts the transport of the photo-generated charges from active layer to the electrodes. Secondly, the active layer with poor P3HT crystallinity has relatively weak absorption in the longer wavelength region, resulting from quick evaporation of the solvent with low boiling point.12–16

It is found that the type of solvent with various surface tensions (ST) is also very important to inkjet-printing technology, which does not only affect the surface morphology of active layers, but also dispersion of PCBM in polymer donor. As shown in Table 4, although the boiling point of oDCB/mesitylene mixing solution is lower than that of tetralene, the surface roughness of active layers is lower (ca. 2.6 nm) than that (ca. 21.0 nm) of active layers.12,16,19 The result is attributed to the effect of surface tensions. The solvent with low surface tension is used to achieve optimum wetting and spreading on the substrate. In addition to this, the solvent with low surface tension is also benefit to self-organization of the blended P3HT polymer molecules. So, the active layer has potential to format the smooth surface in the presence of solvent with low surface tension. As above discussion, the PSCs based on tetralene with high surface tensions shows high roughness, resulting in limited PCE (in the range of 1.3%).

Furthermore, the surface tension of solvent also strongly affects the dispersion of PCBM in polymer donor as shown in Fig. 1. The AFM image (in Fig. 1A) clearly reveals that the active layer inkjet-printed from CB/oDCB shows distinct nanoscale phase separation.13 However, it should be noted that the film inkjet-printed from CB/Cl-naph exhibits an undesirably large degree of phase separation between the P3HT and PCBM (the average size of the domains is greater than 100.0 nm) as shown in Fig. 1B. As well-known, the larger degree of phase separation between P3HT and PCBM results from larger aggregates of these PCBM nanoparticles in P3HT matrix, indicating a poor dispersion of PCBM in the matrix P3HT.23 The poor dispersion of PCBM in polymer donor may restrict charge separation and transport, resulting in decrease of PCE.12–17 The result is further confirmed by the PCE of PSCs as shown in Table 4. Generally, the surface roughness of the active layer is higher, and the PCE of PSCs is lower.12,16,19 However, the different result from the two types of solvent between CB/oDCB and CB/Cl-naph is observed. It is due to that the PCBM has poor dispersion in P3HT donor in the presence of CB/Cl-naph mixing solution.

According to previous literature,45 the viscosity of ink is also very important for inkjet printing technology. At the same jetting conditions, the primary or leading drop size and total liquid volume jetted were lower for the liquids with high viscosity,46 resulting in formation of thinner deposition film. The time taken for the ejected liquid ligament to break up increased with increasing viscosity, and both the volume and speed of the jetted liquid body decreased with increasing viscosity. To achieve the desired jetting performance, the viscosity of inkjet inks has to be less than 30 mPa s−1 and is typically around 10 mPa s−1. Generally, the viscosity of ink is determined by the ink formulations, such as type of solvent, type and concentration of materials dispersion in solvent. The solvents with various viscosity used in inkjet printing PSCs are concluded and compared as shown in Fig. 2. It clearly shows that the viscosity of these solvents is similar. In addition to this, the viscosity of these solvents is far lower than that of ink. So, the effect of solvents viscosity on the PCE of PSCs prepared by inkjet printing technology is slight. In fact, some solvents (e.g. oDT) have high viscosity (>10 mPa s−1), in which the solvents viscosity should be considered for fabrication of PSCs by inkjet printing technology in the future.

According to above discussions, the surface roughness of active layers and dispersion of PCBM in polymer donor determine on the PCE of PSCs. The smooth surface and good dispersion has a key role for improving the PCE of PSCs. The active layer inkjet-printed from solvent with high boiling point and low surface tension shows a smooth surface. However, although the active layer inkjet-printed from solvent with low surface tension shows good dispersion, the physical process and its mechanism have few reports or investigations in previous works.12–17 In addition to this, the relationship between boiling point of solvent and dispersion of PCBM in polymer donor has been little investigated and discussed. Despite this, there are some works reporting the choice of solvent for the inkjet-printing technology, but lots of works about optimizing type of solvent and explore the mechanism of film prepared by the inkjet-printing technology should to be carried out in order to further improve the PCE of PSCs.
(2) Substrate temperature.
The structure of the active layer and PEC of PSCs prepared by the inkjet printing technology are also affected by the substrate temperature.12–14,20 Firstly, the modification of the solvent evaporation rate by temperature can be used to control drying speed, in which the evaporation rate increases with increasing substrate temperature. Secondly, the configuration of polymer backbones can be controlled by the substrate temperature, in which the aggregation of polymer can be easily observed at the low substrate temperature. It is well-known that the high evaporation rate and aggregation of polymer backbones is not beneficial to formation of high crystallization polymer film, resulting in high surface roughness of active layer. Generally, the evaporation rate and aggregation of polymer backbones increases and decreases with increasing substrate temperature, respectively.12 So, the surface roughness (or polymer crystallization) of active layers is the result of competition between evaporation of solvent and aggregation of polymer backbones. As shown in Fig. 3, the PCE of PSCs as function of the substrate temperature.12,14,20 It clearly shows that the PCE of PSCs based on oDCB and CB increases and decreases with increasing substrate temperature, respectively. The different result is due to the result of competition between evaporation of solvent and aggregation of polymer backbones. When the solvent (e.g., CB) with low boiling point is used, the effect of evaporation rate is more obvious compared with aggregation of polymer backbones. As above discussion, the high evaporation rate of solvent results in the low P3HT crystallinity, corresponding to the high substrate temperature. And the poor P3HT crystallinity would result in a rough and uneven surface of active layer. It restricts the transport of the photo-generated charges from active layer towards the electrodes. So, the lower PEC is observed at the higher substrate temperature for the solvent with low boiling point. Contrarily, the effect of aggregation of polymer backbones is more important in the presence of solvent (e.g. o-DCB and tetralene) with high boiling point. And the high P3HT crystallization is formed, resulting from low aggregation of polymer backbones due to high substrate temperature. With the same mechanism, the high P3HT crystallization is of benefit to form the smooth surface for the active layer. So, the higher PCE is observed at the higher substrate temperature for the solvent with high boiling point.
 Fig. 3  The PCE of PSCs as function of substrate temperature in the inkjet-printing process. 
In fact, the substrate temperature also affects the thickness and uniformities of active layer.14 It shows that the active layer is thicker at the lower substrate temperature, resulting from the aggregation of polymer backbones. At the same time, it shows that the active layer is more uniform at the lower substrate temperature. The result is attributed to that the solvent evaporates mainly from the droplet's boundaries at high temperature and thus, the direction of liquid flow is from the center towards the edges, resulting in ring-like active layers. However, there are few works to consider on the effect of thickness and uniformities of active layer for the PCE of PSCs as function of substrate temperature. So, the system studies about substrate temperature in inkjet printing technology should be further carried out in the future.
(3) The concentration of polymer donor and PCBM.
The concentration of polymer donor and PCBM is also very important for the inkjet printing technology. Firstly, the concentration of polymer donor and PCBM affects the viscosity of ink. Investigations of the photovoltaic performance for higher solution viscosities was also performed but in keeping with previously reported observations the small amount of solvent in each droplet mainly affected the printing ability, due to nozzle clogging.19 So, the viscosities of ink should be controlled to be 2–30 mPa s−1 by adjusting the concentration of polymer donor and PCBM. Generally, the viscosities of ink increase with increasing concentration. However, there are few works reporting the effect of ink's viscosities on structure of active layer and PEC of PSCs. Secondly, with the same solvent, the concentration of polymer donor and PCBM also affect the thickness of active layer, which increases with increasing concentration. As well-known, the thicker active layer absorbs higher amount of photons, and the PCE of PSCs is higher as shown in Table 5.20 However, when the thickness of active layer is more than 300 nm, it restricts the transport of the photo-generated charges from active layer to electrodes, resulting in decreasing PCE of PSCs.14 In fact, the concentration of polymer donor and PCBM should also affect the aggregate of polymer donor and PCBM in active layer. And it further affects the structure of active layer and PCE of PSCs. But there are few works reporting it. So, more studies about the concentration of active materials in inkjet printing technology should be carried out in the future.

(4) The mass ratio of polymer donor and PCBM.
The effect of mass ratio of polymer donor and PCBM on the structure (e.g. surface roughness and thickness) of active layer was also investigated in previous work.19,21Fig. 4 shows, from left to right AFM images of printed films for the three different blend ratios 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4, respectively. It can be seen that the roughness decreases with increasing mass ratio of PCBM and polymer donor. Generally, the high content of PCBM leads to aggregation of polymer donor, resulting in increasing the surface roughness of active layer.23 However, here, the different result is observed as shown in Fig. 4, and the mechanism should be investigated in the future. At the same time, it shows that the thickness of active layer increases with increasing mass ratio of PCBM and polymer donor as shown in Table 6.19 The result is attributed to an increase in the concentration of PCBM and polymer donor. As above discussion, the thicker active layer is formed at the higher concentration. In addition to this, the high content of PCBM resulting in aggregation of polymer donor pays a key role, too. It is well-known that the PCE of PSCs strongly depends on the surface roughness and thickness of active layer. However, there are few works reporting the relation between mass ratio and PCE of PSCs. So, more studies about the mass ratio of polymer donor and PCBM in inkjet printing technology should be carried out in the future.

(5) The annealing temperature.
The effect of annealing temperature on the surface morphology of active layer and PCE of PSCs was also investigated in detail in previous works.11,22,24Fig. 5 shows the AFM images of P3OT:PC71BM composite films as printed and after thermal annealing treatment with three different temperatures.24 It clearly shows that the surface roughness increases with increasing temperatures. Moreover, the AFM image (in Fig. 5B–D) clearly shows lots of black spots, indicating the phase separation of active layer. During annealing treatment, the PC71BM molecules were likely to combine, grew in a vertical direction to the film plane and formed a large aggregate thereby destroying the original structure of P3OT:PC71BM composites. The above results are further confirmed by the TEM images as shown in inset of Fig. 5. It clearly shows some large black spots, which are assigned to aggregates of PC71BM. The number and size of PC71BM aggregates increase with increasing temperature. So, the annealing treatment is not of benefit to form smooth and uniform active layer. For the same reason, the annealing treatment is also not beneficial to improve PCE of PSCs, in which the PCE of PSCs decreases with increasing temperature.11,22 For example, the PCE of PSCs dramatically decrease from 6.8 × 10−2% to 1.9 × 10−5%, corresponding to annealing temperature 70 °C and 130 °C, respectively.22

3.2 Inkjet printing conducting electrodes
Generally, the ITO (or graphene) and Al (or Ag) are as anode and cathode electrode of PSCs, respectively. So, to achieve all-inkjet-printable PSCs, the development of inkjet-printable transparent conducting (TC) electrodes with low resistance and high transparency is very imperative because TC electrodes are a key component in the printable PSCs.
(1) Inkjet printing ITO conducting electrodes.
Recently, the inkjet-printed indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes using ITO nanoparticle ink for printable PSCs were reported.26–30 The precursor ink for ITO inkjet printing was prepared by dissolving ITO nanoparticles with an average size of 20.0–30.0 nm in ethanol solution at room temperature. It was found that the properties (resistivity and optical transmittance) of inkjet-printed ITO electrodes and PCE of PSCs strongly depended on the thermal annealing temperature and active area. As shown in Table 7, the resistivity of inkjet-printed transparent conducting oxides electrodes (ITO or IZTO) decreases with increasing thermal annealing temperature.28–30 For example, the sheet resistance and resistivity of the as-printed ITO electrode cannot be measured, even though it has a high transparency. However, the inkjet printed ITO electrode annealed at 450 °C shows a significantly reduced sheet resistance of 202.7 Ω sq−1. The inkjet-printed IZTO electrode shows the lowest sheet resistance of 20.6 Ω sq−1, which is one order of magnitude lower than those of the previously reported inkjet-printed ITO electrode.28 These results are attributed to following two reasons. Firstly, the stable, homogeneous dispersions of ITO in solvents for inkjet printing technology are strongly required. It needs more experimental processes to modify ITO in order to make them readily dispersed in organic solvent. However, the organic functional groups decrease charge transport properties and mobility of the ITO. After thermal annealing, the organic functional groups on the surface of ITO nanoparticles were removed, in which a bare ITO electrode layer are formed. Secondly, the substitution of In3+ with Sn4+ as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies in the films are enhanced at the elevated annealing temperatures. In the other way, it shows that the optical transmittance of the inkjet printed TC is not sensitive to rapid thermal annealing, even though it is annealed in an oxygen and nitrogen ambient as shown in Table 7. It is well-known that the PCE of PSCs is critically dependent on the sheet resistance and transmittance of the TC electrode. Therefore, it is believed that the higher PCE value in the cell with the annealed ITO or IZTO are due to its lower sheet resistance as shown in Table 7, too.

The PSCs with the inkjet printed ITO shows a lower PCE than that of the sputtered ITO as shown in Table 7.28–30 The result is due to the relatively high sheet resistivity of TC electrode prepared by the inkjet printing technology. Despite the low PCE value of PSCs with inkjet printed TC electrode, the inkjet printing TC electrode is a promising alternative to cost-intensive sputtered ITO for the realization of low-cost PSCs, which can be fabricated using roll-to-roll process. Furthermore, it is believe that the resistivity of inkjet printing ITO electrode can be improved by further optimization of the printing process and PSCs structure. For example, by inserting an inkjet-printed Ag grid between inkjet- printing ITO electrodes, the high sheet resistance limitation of inkjet-printed ITO electrodes was overcome as shown in Table 7.26 The result is attributed to the high conductivity of Ag materials.

Inkjet printing silver cathode of PSCs was also investigated by Soo-Hyoung Lee et al.31 It is well-known that the surface of the P3HT–PCBM layer is hydrophobic whereas that of silver ink is hydrophilic. In this condition, the silver ink cannot be prepared directly on the top of the P3HT–PCBM layer, as shown in Fig. 6(A). To solve this problem, hydrophilic ZnO was used as a buffer layer.31 The ZnO solution was coated on the top of the P3HT–PCBM layer and silver ink was injected by inkjet printing technology. As shown in Fig. 6(B), the silver ink was easily coated on the surface of the P3HT–PCBM layer with the ZnO buffer layer. However, the best obtained PCE of PSCs based on the inkjet printing Ag is relatively low of 0.20%. The low PCE may be attributed to following reasons: the low sheet resistance (<10 Ω sq−1) is difficult to be obtained. In addition to this, the work function of Ag electrodes prepared by inkjet printing technology is also key factor for the low PCE. When the PSCs structure, composition of silver ink and inkjet printing conditions are optimized, the number is expected to be further improved.

Recently, silver anode electrode for ITO-free all printed PSCs were also investigated.32–38 There are two important characterizations for the silver anode electrode. Firstly, the structure of silver electrode is a grid, which is different from traditional structure of film as shown in Fig. 6 and 7. The silver grids are not only high conductivity (60 Ω sq−1), but also is high transmittance (ca. 71% from 350 nm–800 nm).33 When the structure of Ag grid is further optimized, such as separation distance, height and width of grid, the conductivity and transmittance can be further improved. For example, at an optimized Ag grid separation distance of 3 mm, the hybrid electrode showed a sheet resistance of 2.86 Ω sq−1, an optical transmittance of 74.06%.32 Secondly, the Ag grids can be large scale produced by roll-to-roll inkjet printing approaches under ambient conditions. The foils with inkjet printing silver grids were spliced into one roll with a maximum length of 150 m and width of 330 mm.33 The inkjet printer is based on Kyocera inkjet printing heads and has a resolution of 600 DPI at right angles to the web direction and 1200 DPI in the direction of the web. The system has three heads and is capable of printing in the full width at high speeds up to 75 m min−1. It provides a chance for the fabrication of PSCs by roll-to-roll inkjet printing approaches. Furthermore, the PCE of the PSCs based on Ag-grid/ PEDOT:PSS electrodes is more than 1.48%.34,36,38 These results indicate that the era of ITO is over, and that a new age can begin without reliance on indium and vacuum processes, since the Ag grids may substitute ITO as transparent electrodes for polymer solar cells.

3.3 Inkjet printing hole translate layers
The commercial Pi-conjugated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is currently the most widely used hole translate layer in the field of PSCs due to its high work function, a tunable band gap, hole transport/electron blocking properties, and a uniform surface. Generally, the thin films of PEDOT:PSS arr fabricated by spin coating. However, there is inherently a large amount of waste in spin casting and it is not compatible with roll-to-roll or large area processing. In addition, to achieve all-inkjet-printable PSCs, the development of inkjet-printable PEDOT:PSS hole translate layers is very important. So, some works reported the preparation and properties of PEDOT:PSS film applied in the PSCs.39–41 These results show that the PSCs prepared by inkjet printing technology shows similar PCE (3.3%) compared with spin coating method (3.6%).39 These similar PCE shows that the inkjet printing technology is viable alternatives to spin coating for deposition of PEDOT:PSS film in PSCs applications. Moreover, these numbers can be further improved by optimization of ink composition and deposition conditions. It has demonstrated that the PCE (3.16%) of PSCs based on newly proposed PEDOT:PSS film with additives is higher than that (2.09%) of PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS film without additives as shown in Table 8.39 The improvement of PCE is attributed to lower surface roughness and higher conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film with additives compared with PEDOT:PSS film without additives. The decreasing surface roughness of PEDOT:PSS film with additives is due to following two reasons: (1) the glycerol and surfactant can improve the dispersion of PEDOT:PSS in solvent, reducing the aggregation of PEDOT:PSS chain in the drying process; (2) the glycerol and surfactant in the dispersion which minimizes the interfacial tension between the PEDOT:PSS and solvent, allowing the pitch size (distance between individual droplets from the inkjet head) to be smaller than the droplet diameter. And the enhanced conductivity is assigned to the change of surface morphology and chemical structure. The smooth surface and good dispersion of PEDOT:PSS film with glycerol and surfactant is beneficial to the improvement of the conductivity. Similarly, upon addition of glycerol and EGBE surfactant, the polar functionality (–OH) and nonpolar alkyl group (butyl) in the glycerol molecule and EGBE surfactant might directly interact with cationic species of PEDOT. Probably stronger ionic interactions between the additives and PEDOT are responsible for the highly conductive network formation in glycerol added PEDOT:PSS, when compared to PSS and PEDOT in pure PEDOT:PSS film.

4 Conclusions
The performance of PSCs based on inkjet printed active layer, electrodes and hole transporting layers has been studying for the mildness, simplicity, low-cost and large-scale production. These results indicate that the performance of PSCs strongly depend on ink composition (e.g., solvent, concentration, additives and so on) and inkjet printing conditions (e.g., substrate temperature, thermal annealing temperature and so on). Furthermore, the mechanism about the effect of ink composition and inkjet printing conditions on performance of PSCs was also discussion in detail. In addition to this, the PSCs based on inkjet printed active layer, electrodes and hole transporting layers have a similar PCE compared with other preparation methods. These make the inkjet technique an extremely interesting future candidate for PSCs processing. However, there are few works reporting the preparation and properties of PSCs based on all inkjet printed layers. Furthermore, there are more system studies needed about the inkjet printing process in order to improve the PCE of inkjet printing PSCs. These results and discussions in the paper are very important to further improve the performance of full inkjet printed PSCs and application in PSCs for the inkjet printing technology.
