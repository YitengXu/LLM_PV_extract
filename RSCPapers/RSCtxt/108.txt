    , Accepted 4th November 2018First published on 7th November 2018AbstractThe Haber–Bosch process for industrial-scale NH3 production suffers from high energy consumption and serious CO2 emission. Electrochemical N2 reduction is an attractive carbon-neutral alternative for NH3 synthesis but is severely restricted due to N2 activation needing efficient electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions. Here, we report that Ti3C2Tx (T = F, OH) MXene nanosheets act as high-performance 2D NRR electrocatalysts for ambient N2-to-NH3 conversion with excellent selectivity. In 0.1 M HCl, such catalysts achieve a large NH3 yield of 20.4 µg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a high faradic efficiency of 9.3% at −0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, with high electrochemical and structural stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that N2 chemisorbed on Ti3C2Tx experiences elongation/weakness of the NN triple bond facilitating its catalytic conversion to NH3 and the distal NRR mechanism is more favorable with the final reaction of *NH2 to NH3 as the rate-limiting step.
NH3 is an essential activated nitrogen source for manufacturing fertilizers, medications, dyes, explosives, resins, etc.1–3 NH3 is also increasingly regarded as an attractive substitute for petroleum as a transportation fuel having features of high energy density and being free of CO2 emission.4 Although N2 is an inexhaustible molecule in the atmosphere, it is chemically inert owing to its high NN bond energy (941 kJ mol−1), low polarizability, and lack of a dipole moment, rendering its conversion to NH3 difficult.5–7 Industrial-scale NH3 production mainly relies on the century-old Haber–Bosch process catalyzed by Fe or Ru using N2 and H2 as feeding gases.8–10 This process however operates at very high temperatures and pressures with serious CO2 emissions. Thus, it is highly imperative to explore less energy-intensive alternatives for environmentally-benign NH3 synthesis.
In nature, nitrogenases in bacteria catalyze ambient N2 fixation through multiple proton and electron transfer steps driven by a significant energy input delivered by ATP.11–13 Upon the addition of protons and electrons, electrochemical N2 reduction can also occur under ambient conditions and be powered by renewable energy from solar or wind sources, offering us a promising eco-friendly process for sustainable artificial N2 fixation.14–16 Nevertheless, active electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are needed to address the challenge of N2 activation. Noble-metal catalysts have been designed to perform NRR with remarkable catalytic performance.17–20 An immediate outlook for large-scale industrial application points toward the use of systems not relying on expensive precious metals and great recent effort has been put into developing non-noble-metal alternatives.21–28 Although some progress has been made in this respect, there is still a great need to exploit earth-abundant NRR electrocatalysts which simultaneously achieve large NH3 yields and high Faradic efficiency (FE).
An ideal NRR electrocatalyst should possess not only a large specific surface area to expose abundant active sites but high electronic conductivity to facilitate efficient electron shuttling. As a new family of 2D materials, MXenes combine the metallic conductivity of transition metal carbides with the hydrophilic nature of their hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces.29,30 Although MXenes have found widespread application in many field,31–37 their use for electrocatalytic N2 reduction has not been explored so far. Herein, we demonstrate the proof of concept that 2D Ti3C2Tx (Tx = F, OH) MXene nanosheets (Ti3C2Tx NS) perform highly efficiently and stably to electrocatalyze ambient N2-to-NH3 fixation with excellent selectivity, achieving a large NH3 yield of 20.4 µg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a high FE of 9.3% at −0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The NRR mechanism is also studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest that the final electrocatalytic reaction of *NH2 → NH3 is the rate-limiting step.
Ti3C2Tx NSs were prepared according to previous reports (see ESI for preparative details†).32,38 As seen from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1a), the (002) diffraction peak shifts to a lower angle and the most intense peak of Ti3AlC2 at 2θ ≈ 39° disappears, showing successful conversion of Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2Tx.38 From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bulk Ti3AlC2 (Fig. S1†) and delaminated Ti3C2Tx NSs (Fig. 1b), it is clearly seen that bulk Ti3AlC2 was converted to a loosely layered Ti3C2Tx structure after the etch reactions. The nanosheet nature of Ti3C2Tx is evidenced by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Fig. 1c. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d) reveals lattice fringes with a layer distance of 0.91 nm, which is in good agreement with previous reports.32 The EDX spectrum (Fig. S2†) indicates the presence of Ti, C, O, and F. TEM and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images confirm the uniform distribution of all four elements within Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 1e).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum also confirms the presence of Ti, C, O, and F in Ti3C2Tx, as shown in Fig. S3.† In the Ti 2p region (Fig. 2a), both Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 can be fitted with five peaks,39 corresponding to the Ti–C bond, Ti(II), Ti(III), TiO2, and Ti–F bond, respectively. The C 1s region (Fig. 2b) is deconvoluted into five peaks at binding energies (BEs) of 281.7, 284.4, 286.2, 288.2, and 290.9 eV, which are assigned to Ti–C, C–C, C–O, HO–CO, and C–F bonds, respectively.40–43 In the O 1s region (Fig. 2c), the BEs at 529.9, 531.5, 532.4, and 533.9 eV are derived from O–Ti, C–Ti–O, C–Ti–(OH)x, and H–O–H bonds, respectively.41,43–45Fig. 2d shows TiO2−xFx and Ti–F signals at BEs of 682.1 and 685.0 eV, respectively,40,43–45 and the small peak occurring at 687.5 eV can be assigned to Al–F.41 All these observations support the successful preparation of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.

The electrochemical measurements were performed in a gas-tight two-compartment cell separated by a piece of Nafion 211 membrane. Ti3C2Tx was deposited on carbon paper (Ti3C2Tx/CP, Ti3C2Tx loading: 0.2 mg cm−2) as the working electrode with the use of Ag/AgCl as the reference in the cathode chamber and graphite plate as the counter electrode in the anode chamber. During electrolysis, N2 gas was bubbled onto the cathode, where protons transported through the electrolyte (0.1 M HCl aqueous solution) can react with N2 on the surface of the catalyst to produce NH3. All the potentials for NRR were reported on a RHE scale. Fig. 3a displays the time-dependent current density curves of Ti3C2Tx/CP in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte for 2 h, as the potential shifts from −0.35 to −0.55 V. The obtained NH3 in the solution phase was spectrophotometrically determined using the indophenol blue method,46 and another possible by-product (N2H4) was detected using the method of Watt and Chrisp.47 The corresponding calibration curves are shown in Fig. S5 and S6†. Fig. S7† shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the electrolytes stained with p-C9H11NO indicator after NRR electrolysis at a series of potentials, indicating the excellent selectivity of Ti3C2Tx/CP for NH3 production. Fig. 3b presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of electrolytes coloured with indophenol indicator after 2 h electrocatalytic reaction at a series of potentials, and the electrolyte shows the highest absorbance intensity when electrolyzed at −0.40 V. NH3 yield and corresponding FE at various potentials were calculated and are plotted in Fig. 3c. Both NH3 yield and FE increase when the negative potential increased from −0.35 to −0.40 V. At −0.40 V, this catalyst is capable of achieving a large NH3 yield of 20.4 µg h−1 mgcat.−1 (4.08 µg h−1 cmcat.−2) and a high FE of 9.3%, comparing favourably to the behaviour of most reported aqueous-based NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions, including Au NRs (1.64 µg h−1 cmcat.−2, 3.88%),18 Fe2O3–CNT (0.22 µg h−1 cmcat.−2, 0.15%),21 Fe2O3/Ti (3.43 µg h−1 cmcat.−2, 2.6%),24etc. A more detailed comparison is shown in Table S1.† The decrease of both NH3 yield and FE was observed as the potential negatively shifted to −0.55 V, which is attributed to the competitive adsorption of N2 and hydrogen species on the electrode surface.48–50 It should be mentioned that bare CP has poor NRR activity (Fig. 3d). We also explored the influence of catalyst loading on NRR performance and found that 0.2 mg was the optimum mass loading for NRR (Fig. S7†).

To further verify that the product was indeed generated via N2 reduction electrocatalyzed by Ti3C2Tx/CP, three control experiments were conducted: (1) Ti3C2Tx/CP in N2-saturated solution at an open-circuit potential (OCP) for 2 h; (2) Ti3C2Tx/CP in Ar-saturated solution at −0.40 V for 2 h; (3) Ti3C2Tx/CP at −0.40 V with alternating 2 h cycles between N2- and Ar-saturated solutions. No NH3 was detected in control experiments (1) and (2), as shown in Fig. 3e. For the last control experiment, NH3 was only obtained in N2-saturated solution at −0.40 V (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, there is a linear correlation between the amount of produced NH3 and the time within 3 h electrolysis (Fig. 3g). In addition, we conducted electrocatalytic NRR in 0.05 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M Na2SO4. Results suggested that Ti3C2Tx was efficient for NRR under both of these conditions (Fig. S8 and S9†).
Stability is another critical parameter for the practical application of catalysts. After 6 consecutive cycles, both NH3 yield rate and FE show small variations (Fig. 3h). After 23 h NRR electrolysis, our Ti3C2Tx/CP still maintains strong long-term electrochemical durability with little attenuation in current, as shown in Fig. 3i. XRD (Fig. S10†) and XPS (Fig. S11†) data confirm that Ti3C2Tx has no obvious changes in crystalline phase and valence states. The TEM image shows the preservation of nanosheet features for post-NRR Ti3C2Tx (Fig. S12†) after NRR electrolysis. These results imply high structural stability.
To gain further insight into the active sites and electrocatalytic processes of NRR on Ti3C2Tx, we performed DFT calculations to explore the atomistic electrocatalytic NRR mechanism on the Ti3C2Tx model. Since N2 adsorption on the catalyst surface is the first process for NRR, its initial adsorption configurations are very important for the following electrocatalytic reactions. For our Ti3C2Tx model, the end-on and side-on adsorption structures were optimized and found to be stable (Fig. 4). The adsorption energy of the end-on configuration was a little smaller than that of the side-on one (potential energy: 0.80 vs. 1.00 eV; free energy: 0.37 vs. 0.46 eV). In these adsorption structures, the N–N bond length is elongated very much, and was calculated to be 1.194 and 1.268 angstrom for the end-on and side-on adsorption structures, respectively. Obviously, the elongated N–N bond length is proportional to the adsorption energy. In other words, the larger the adsorption energy is, the longer the N–N bond length becomes.
 Fig. 4  DFT calculated energy profile for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction on Ti3C2Tx. The charge density difference of the two adsorption configurations is also shown. Yellow and blue represent charge accumulation and depletion (isovalue: 0.005 au). 
In the following calculations we started from the side-on adsorption structure to explore its subsequent electrocatalytic NRR mechanism on the Ti3C2Tx surface. Fig. 4 shows our calculated favorable energy profiles for NRR on the Ti3C2Tx surface (optimized structures are shown in Fig. S13†). In the distal mechanism, the whole reaction is divided into two half reactions. First, protons and electrons attack a terminal nitrogen atom to generate a NH3 molecule; then, the remaining nitrogen atom is hydrogenated to form another NH3 molecule. The first half reaction is exothermic by 2.68 eV free energy from the N2 to *N species. In contrast, the second half reaction is energetically uphill except the first reaction from *N to *NH. The rate-limiting step is the final *NH2 to NH3 reaction. In addition, we also calculated the alternative NRR mechanism, which was found to be energetically unfavorable (Fig. S13 and S14†). Instead, we have found another energetically allowed mixed NRR mechanism (Fig. 4). In this mechanism, the first reaction steps i.e. from N2 to *NH–*NH2 are the same as those in the alternative mechanism. The difference is that in the mixed one, a proton and electron pair is added to the *NH2 moiety of the *NH–*NH2 species generating a NH3 molecule, not the *NH moiety. As a result, the high-energy NH2–NH2 intermediate is bypassed. This is also consistent with the experimental observation of not detecting the N2H4 species (see above). It should be noted that both distal and mixed mechanisms have the same rate-limiting step. Nonetheless, the distal mechanism is still preferred because of its much more significant exothermicity from *N–*NH to *NH (Fig. 4).
In summary, Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets have been experimentally and theoretically verified as non-noble-metal 2D catalysts to enable high-performance electrohydrogenation of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions. When tested in acids, this catalyst is excellent in activity with a NH3 yield of 20.4 µg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a FE of 9.3%, with high electrochemical and structural stability. DFT calculations reveal that the distal NRR mechanism is more favorable and the related *NH2 → NH3 reaction is the rate-limiting step. This study not only provides us with an attractive earth-abundant catalyst material for electrochemical NH3 synthesis, but it would open up exciting new avenues for the rational design and development of MXene-based nanocatalysts for artificial N2 fixation.
