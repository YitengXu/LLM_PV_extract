    , Accepted 22nd July 2022First published on 25th July 2022AbstractTwo-dimensional/three-dimensional heterojunctions are widely fabricated for high-performance photodetectors and various strategies have been developed to optimize their performance. Here, we report a hybrid approach to improve the responsivity and response time of a n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction simultaneously through interface passivation and thermal oxidation. The responsivity of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction has been increased from 2.2 A W−1 to 4.5 A W−1 at zero bias, and the response/recovery time has been decreased from 22/15 μs to 2/5 μs at the same time. The AlOx passivation layer reduces the interfacial recombination allowing more carriers to participate in electric conduction and the thermal oxidation shifts the Fermi level of GaTe towards the valence band which enlarges the built-in electric field and accelerates the separation of carriers. This work provides a feasible way to achieve the overall improvement of photodetectors.
1. Introduction
Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have received much attention owing to their unique properties, including thickness-dependent bandgap, free of dangling bonds and high light absorbance.1–5 The 2D/three-dimensional (3D) heterojunction, one kind of cross-dimensional heterojunction, combines the advantages of both 2D materials and conventional 3D bulk substrates.6,7 It has been widely used in field-effect transistors (FETs), photodetectors, solar cells, photocatalysis and so forth.8–12 There are various methods to integrate 2D materials onto 3D substrates, such as chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), magnetron sputtering and solution-processes.13–20 Compared to the aforementioned technologies, direct dry-transfer provides an easy-to-implement route to construct 2D/3D heterojunctions, and there is no limitation on the choice of 2D materials because the lattice mismatch is not necessary to be considered.21–24 Among numerous traditional semiconductors, silicon (Si) has the advantages of low cost, mature process, reliability and stability. Therefore, it has potential for the integration of Si-based heterojunctions.
The interface quality of heterojunctions plays an important role in the overall electronic and optoelectronic performance.25,26 AlOx as a passivation layer has been demonstrated to be effective for enhanced photovoltaics,27–31 which not only reduces the interface recombination induced by surface states and interlayer tunneling but also allows carriers to transport through the interface by tunneling. The doping also can enhance the optoelectronic performance by modulating the band structure of semiconductors to enlarge the built-in electric field.32–38
Herein, the self-powered optoelectronic performance of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction is improved by inserting an AlOx passivation layer and thermal oxidation. The responsivity of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction is increased from 2.2 A W−1 to 4.5 A W−1, while the response time is decreased from 22/15 μs to 2/5 μs under 532 nm laser illumination under ambient conditions. It has been demonstrated that the AlOx passivation reduces the interfacial recombination of carriers, and thermal oxidation introduces the p-type doping of GaTe, which results in a higher work function to strengthen the built-in electric field formed between Si and GaTe.
2. Experimental section
Characterization
Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a LabRAM HR Evolution under 532 nm laser excitation. The thickness measurement was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park NX10). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed by an ESCALAB VG MARKII to study the elemental composition and chemical bonding of given materials.
Device fabrication and measurement
For the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction, the Si wafer with a resistivity of 4–6 Ω cm was ultrasonically cleaned sequentially with acetone, alcohol and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, and then soaked in a 5% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution to remove the surface oxide layer. Half of the Si wafer was patterned using photolithography, and a 3 nm thick Al layer was deposited on it by electron beam evaporation (EBL). Then a GaTe flake was exfoliated from the bulk, which was grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) according to our previous work,39 and transferred onto the Si wafer using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Then indium tin oxide (ITO) and Al as top and bottom electrodes were deposited by magnetron sputtering for good Ohmic contacts.39 For GaTe FET, the GaTe flake was exfoliated from the bulk and transferred onto a 300 nm thick SiO2/Si substrate. Cr/Au (5/50 nm) and Al as the source and gate electrodes were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The as-prepared n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction and GaTe FET were heated at 300 °C for 3 min in the atmosphere to investigate the oxidation effect. The I–V curves of GaTe-ITO, Si–Al and GaTe–Cr/Au are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The electric and photoelectric characterizations were measured using a Keithley 2400 voltage source and 6487 picoammeter at room temperature in ambient conditions. A laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm was the light source. A digital oscilloscope (Keysight DSO-X 3104A) was employed to measure the response time of the heterojunctions.
3. Results and discussion
The structure of the vertical n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction with an AlOx passivation layer is shown in Fig. 1(a). A 3 nm thick Al layer was deposited on part of the Si substrate, which was immediately oxidized to AlOx once exposed to air. For comparison, the GaTe flake was transferred to the boundary so that half of the GaTe flake is on AlOx and half is on Si. The optical image is shown in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†). The GaTe flake exhibits different color contrasts due to the different refractive indexes of AlOx and Si substrate. An obvious boundary between Si/GaTe and Si/AlOx/GaTe can be observed. Fig. 1(b) shows the Raman peaks located at 110, 115, 126, 142, 162, 176, 209 and 269 cm−1, indicating a monoclinic crystal structure.40 The thickness of the employed GaTe flake in the heterojunction is measured to be ∼117 nm by AFM, as shown in Fig. S1(b) (ESI†). PL measurement was carried out to investigate the optical properties of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction with and without AlOx passivation (Fig. 1(c)). Due to the direct bandgap, GaTe exhibits a strong PL peak at 1.67 eV. The PL intensity of the GaTe with AlOx passivation is slightly higher than that without AlOx passivation, which is attributed to the enhanced charge carrier separation due to the reduction of the interfacial carrier recombination.30 XPS was performed to analyze the change of chemical composition of GaTe after heat treatment. A new peak at 20.5 eV appears except for the pristine Ga 3d peak located at 19.5 eV after heat treatment, which is attributed to the formation of Ga–Oxides (Ga–Ox), as shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e).41–43 Besides, the emergent O 2s peak (Fig. 1(e)) at 23.6 eV and an enormous increase of O 1s peak (Fig. 1(f)) after heat treatment indicate the existence of Ga–Ox.

Fig. 2(a) plots typical I–V curves of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction without AlOx passivation, with AlOx passivation and with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation under dark conditions. The rectification ratios of these devices are 137, 246 and 162, respectively, at ±1 V. This suggests that the rectification behavior of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction is preserved well after AlOx passivation and thermal oxidation. Similar behavior has been observed in the other three n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunctions (Fig. S3, ESI†). The turn-on voltage of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction with AlOx passivation before and after thermal oxidation are 0.08 V and 0.32 V, as shown in Fig. 2(b), which is determined by the extrapolation of the linear region. The increase of the turn-on voltage indicates that there is a higher barrier in the heterojunction after thermal oxidation. A larger forward voltage against the built-in electric field is required to turn on the diode. The temporal photoresponses of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction without AlOx passivation, with AlOx passivation and with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation under illumination (532 nm, 3.2 mW cm−2) are illustrated in Fig. 2(c). An obvious photovoltaic effect in our devices makes it possible to detect optical signals at zero bias. The photocurrent is increased from 50 nA to 70 nA after AlOx passivation and further to 102 nA after thermal oxidation. Although the ultrathin AlOx passivation layer is a barrier layer, it would reduce the photocurrent. At the same time, it also reduces the carrier recombination caused by the interface state and improves the separation efficiency of carriers at the interface, and then finally improves the photocurrent. The photocurrent increase of the device is the competition result between the passivation effect and the barrier effect. Similar behavior of an enhanced photoresponse by the AlOx passivation layer has been reported in other optoelectronic devices.28–31 In addition, the photocurrent of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction without the AlOx layer is also increased by the same thermal oxidation process, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), which is attributed to the thermal oxidation of GaTe. Fig. 2(d) shows the self-powered photocurrents of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation at various incident laser power intensities. The photocurrent is increased from 102 nA to 718 nA with increasing laser power ranging from 3.2 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2.

(c) Time-dependent photoresponse of n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunctions without AlOx passivation, with AlOx passivation and with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation. This result is measured at zero bias, and the incident laser power intensity is 3.2 mW cm−2. (d) Photocurrents of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation under zero bias and different incident laser power intensities. 
Furthermore, we systematically investigated the influence of AlOx passivation and thermal oxidation on the optoelectronic performance of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction at zero bias. The photocurrent (Iph) and responsivity (R) as a function of incident laser power intensity of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction without AlOx passivation, with AlOx passivation and with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). R is defined as the ratio of the photocurrent to the incident light power, which represents the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the photodetector. It can be calculated by the following equation: , where Iph, Pi, and S represent photocurrent, incident laser power density, and effect illuminated area, respectively. The effect illuminated area is estimated to be 706.5 μm2 in the heterojunction. The photocurrent gain caused by the trapped carriers results in a high R under a weak laser intensity. With increasing laser intensity, the trap states are gradually filled up and the carrier recombination probability increases leading to the decrease of R.18,44,45 Under laser illumination of 3.2 mW cm−2, R is enhanced from 2.2 A W−1 to 3.1 A W−1 after AlOx passivation, which is attributed to the reduction of carrier recombination at the interface resulting in enhancement of the charge carrier separation, so that more carriers are collected by ITO and Al electrodes. R is further enhanced to 4.5 A W−1 after thermal oxidation, which is twice that of the pristine device. The AlOx passivation and thermal oxidation not only increase the responsivity but also decrease the photoresponse time of the heterojunction. Fig. 3(c)–(e) shows the response time of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction without AlOx passivation, with AlOx passivation and with AlOx passivation – thermal oxidation at a frequency of 600 Hz. The response/recovery time is decreased from 22/15 μs to 10/10 μs after AlOx passivation, which is attributed to the screening of interfacial charge trapping caused by surface states, such as dangling bonds and surface defects.30 The response/recovery time can be further decreased to 2/5 μs by thermal oxidation.

The GaTe FETs were fabricated to figure out the mechanism of photoresponse enhancement of the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction after thermal oxidation. The schematic diagram of the FET is shown in Fig. 4(a), where Cr/Au (5/50 nm) serve as the source and drain electrodes. The optical image of the GaTe FET and the Raman spectrum of the monoclinic GaTe channel are shown in Fig. S5(a and b) (ESI†). The transport properties are measured under vacuum condition at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the pristine GaTe FET presents a typical p-type transport characterization with an on/off ratio of about 102, which agrees with previous studies.46,47 Then, the treatment of the GaTe FET as the same as the n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction was performed for thermal oxidation. GaTe exhibits p-type electrical characteristics while GaOx exhibits n-type electrical characteristics. A built-in electric field is formed between p-GaTe and n-GaOx due to the type-II band alignment.48,49 Therefore, the electrons are transferred into GaOx driven by the built-in electric field and trapped there, resulting in a localized gate field and thus p-type doping of GaTe, which is demonstrated by the substantial increase in current, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Moreover, the change concentration of holes can be calculated by the following equation: , where Cox = 1.15 × 10−8 F cm−2 for 300 nm SiO2. e is the electron charge. The threshold voltages Vth can be determined by the intersection of the linear fitting of near-linear parts of the transfer characteristic curve and the x axis in linear coordinates. The Vth of the GaTe FET before and after thermal oxidation are determined to be −34 V and 85 V in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Thus the calculated injected hole concentration is 8.56 × 1012 cm−2. P-type doping means that the Fermi level of GaTe downshifts closer to the valence band resulting in a larger ΔEf (EfSi − EfGaTe), as shown in Fig. 4(c). After contact, holes diffuse from GaTe to Si while electrons diffuse from Si to GaTe, leading to a downward band bending of GaTe and an upward band bending of Si at the interface. The built-in electric field is formed when the Fermi levels of Si and GaTe reach the same level. The band alignment of the Si/AlOx/GaTe heterojunction under the condition of thermal equilibrium is present in Fig. 4(d). The Ec and Ev of GaTe move to a high level (Ec′ and Ev′) due to the downshifted Ef resulting in an enlarged built-in electric field after thermal oxidation. Under illumination, the photogenerated electrons and holes drift to the electrodes driven by the built-in electric field. After thermal oxidation, the separation of carriers is promoted due to the enlarged built-in electric field modulated by the p-type doping of GaTe, resulting in higher responsivity and faster response/recovery time.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully improved the performance of a n-Si/p-GaTe heterojunction through AlOx passivation and thermal oxidation. The responsivity is increased from 2.2 A W−1 to 4.5 A W−1, while the response time is decreased from 22/15 μs to 2/5 μs. PL spectra confirm the suppression of interfacial recombination by AlOx passivation. The formation of Ga–Ox observed by XPS results in p-type doping of GaTe, which has been demonstrated by the transfer characterization of the GaTe FET. The downshift of the Fermi level in GaTe strengthens the built-in electric field and promotes the separation of charge carriers. This work provides a facile route for high-performance optoelectronic devices.
