    , Accepted 17th June 2021First published on 17th June 2021AbstractP(NDI2OD-T2), also known as Polyera ActivInk N2200, is a widely accepted non-fullerene acceptor polymer that is used prominently in the energy harvesting application due to its ease of synthesis, high electron mobility, and other desirable semiconducting properties. With its recent foray into energy storage applications, there is tremendous potential for developing composites of N2200 with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to improve its electrical properties and extend its applicability. Here we report a facile synthesis of an N2200 composite with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) following an in situ approach to include MWCNTs into the polymer matrix, improving its electrochemical performance in an organic electrolyte (1 M LiClO4/propylene carbonate). The composite material with an optimum MWCNT content exhibits prominent redox behavior delivering a specific capacity of 80 mA h g−1(polymer) in a standard three-electrode cell. Moreover, the N2200/MWCNT composite material showing a battery-type electrochemical signature could perform as an efficient negative electrode in a high-voltage (2.4 V) hybrid supercapacitor device comprising capacitive activated carbon as the positive electrode.
Introduction
Poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} or P(NDI2OD-T2) also known as Polyera ActivInk N2200 is a nonfullerene acceptor polymer that has found wide acceptance due to its desirable semiconducting properties along with remarkable stability under ambient conditions. The main application of N2200 has been as an acceptor polymer in all-polymer solar cells, where high power conversion efficiencies have been achieved in combination with suitable donor polymers under well-controlled device fabrication conditions.1–7 The first demonstration of this polymer as a charge storage material for rechargeable Li batteries was reported in 2015 in which the authors took advantage of both the electron transport pathway and highly reversible doping characteristics of the polymer.8 Our group reported the application of P(NDI2OD-T2) and its derivatives containing naphthalene diimide (NDI) as an acceptor and thiophene-terminated phenylenevinylene as a donor as electrode materials in a supercapacitor, which showed exceptional cycling stability.9
The most commonly used conjugated polymers as supercapacitor electrode materials are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), polypyrrole, polyaniline, etc., which are all p-type (electron-rich) materials with good charge-storage properties.10–14 In supercapacitor applications, these p-type polymers are usually used as electrodes for either type I or type II devices, where the electrodes are both symmetric or asymmetric, respectively. While reports on type I and type II supercapacitor devices using conjugated polymers abound in the literature, devices using electron poor or donor–acceptor type π-conjugated polymers are not very common. Like p-type polymers, donor–acceptor polymers also show pseudocapacitive behavior due to their intrinsic redox properties.8,15,16 However, their performance as supercapacitor electrode materials has been rarely explored in the literature. There are only one or two other reports on supercapacitors, which use rylenebisimides (perylene or naphthalene) as the electrode material.9,15,17 In our earlier work, we demonstrated the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors based on rylenebisimides with excellent stability over long cycles (>4000 cycles), indicating the potential of donor–acceptor polymers as efficient electrode materials. Hence, further research towards improving the performance of such polymer materials is indeed essential.
Another intriguing characteristic of donor–acceptor polymers is their ability to withstand high-voltage windows when used as an electrode material in electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs). High-voltage electrodes provide the opportunity to make use of organic electrolytes for realizing high-voltage supercapacitor devices instead of the traditional aqueous electrolyte,18 which suffers from low voltage stability due to the inevitable water oxidation at a high voltage. As the energy density (E) of a supercapacitor follows the relationship E = ½CV2, where C is the capacitance and V is the operating voltage, a small increase in the voltage results in a significant improvement in the energy density of the device.19 Therefore, exploring donor–acceptor polymers as electrode materials in combination with organic electrolytes is pertinent towards developing high energy supercapacitors.
Despite their advantages, organic electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity inciting high internal resistance and often leads to inferior electrochemical performance. Therefore, improving the conductivity of the electrode material and the interface between the electrode and electrolyte is an essential requirement to compensate for the electrolyte resistance in organic electrolyte-based supercapacitors. The conductivity of polymers can be often enhanced by mixing with various carbon materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene.20–26 Multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) are also an excellent conducting additive for electrode fabrication due to their high surface area, low electrical resistivity, and nano-porous structure.27 Conjugated polymers can involve in π–π interactions with CNTs resulting in the unbundling of the CNT aggregates.28,29 Composite electrodes usually have a porous structure, which enables good accessibility of the electrolyte to the inner surface of the electrode resulting in an improved electrode–electrolyte interface.30,31 Compared to the various strategies adopted for mixing CNTs with conjugated polymers, the in situ addition of CNTs during the polymerization reaction is a better way to achieve uniform mixing of the polymer with the conductive material, which leads to better electrochemical performance of the material. There are several reports on the application of polyaniline composites with in situ addition of carbon nanotubes or graphene as the electrode material in supercapacitors.32–37 These nanocomposites exhibited better charge-storage properties and stability as compared to pristine polyaniline. Similarly, polypyrrole in situ polymerized with carbon nanotubes,38,39 RGO (reduced graphene oxide),40 molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),41 and copper sulfide (CuS)42 have also shown improved charge-storage performance compared to pristine polypyrrole. Recently, Smirnov et al. reported the in situ synthesis of polypyrrole in the presence of cellulose nanofibers grown over graphene, which showed an enhanced specific capacitance (810 F g−1) compared to the externally mixed sample (371 F g−1).43In situ synthesized poly(3-hexylthiophene)/graphene composites also have shown a better capacitance value than ex situ mixed composites.44 However, as already mentioned, these composites are tested in an aqueous electrolyte, thereby limiting the operating voltage of the devices to 1.2 V.45,46 Therefore, extending the strategy of the in situ incorporation of conducting additives to pseudocapacitive/battery-type conducting polymers for designing suitable electrode materials for organic electrolyte-based high energy supercapacitors and hybrid supercapacitors is of great importance, yet challenging. As far as the authors are aware, there have been no reports in the literature on the synthesis of n-type polymer composites with carbon nanotubes or any conductive materials following the in situ approach.
In this work, P(NDI2OD-T2) or N2200 based polymer composites were synthesized by in situ addition of MWCNTs with various weight ratios following a modified Stille polymerization procedure. The generally reported procedure for the synthesis of P(NDI2OD-T2) by the Stille polymerization takes a long time (3 days) to complete.3,47–49 In our report, the synthesis of P(NDI2OD-T2) and its composites was carried out using modified Stille polymerization conditions, which resulted in high molecular weight polymers with good yields in very short reaction periods. To our knowledge, this is the first report where high molecular weight P(NDI2OD-T2)-based polymers were developed within 2 hours of the polymerization time. The electrochemical performance of the composite materials was tested in an organic electrolyte (1 M LiClO4/propylene carbonate) in a standard three-electrode configuration. The in situ prepared polymer composites delivered 80 mA h g−1(polymer) specific capacity (considering the loading of the polymer in the working electrode), a value substantially higher compared to that of the pristine polymer and the physically mixed polymer/MWCNT composite. Moreover, the in situ prepared composite showed promising performance as a negative electrode coupled with an activated carbon positive electrode in a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) cell. The preparation and electrochemical characterization of the in situ and physically mixed polymer/MWCNT composites are schematically summarized in Fig. 1.

Experimental section
Materials
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA), 2-octyldodecanol, and 2-ethylhexyl bromide were purchased from TCI chemicals and used without further purification. 5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (Pd(Ph3)2Cl2), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and propylene carbonate (PC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 4-Tertiary butyl toluene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used after drying.

Measurements. 

1H NMR spectra of the monomer and polymers were recorded on a Bruker 200 and 400 MHz NMR spectrophotometer in deuterated chloroform solution with TMS as the reference. The molecular weight of the polymers was determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) having a Viscotek VE 1122 solvent delivery system at room temperature in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 as an eluent and with the help of a Viscotek VE 3580 refractive index (RI) detector. The analyses were carried out using polystyrene as the standard. Absorption spectra of the polymers were recorded using a double beam PerkinElmer lambda-35 UV/Vis spectrometer with deuterium and tungsten lamps as the source. TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) was performed with the help of a PerkinElmer STA (Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer) 6000 thermogravimetric analyzer. Samples were run at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 40 to 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. TEM images were obtained with the help of a JEOL JEM-F200 HR-TEM instrument with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector for EDX analysis. FE-SEM images were recorded using an FEI NOVASEM 450 FESEM instrument.


Sample preparation. 
UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded in the solution state by dissolving the polymer in chloroform at different concentrations. To calculate the concentration of MWCNTs in the C-X polymer composites, the solution was prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/50 mL in chloroform. For FE-SEM and TEM sample preparation, the polymer was dispersed in methanol as the solvent (1 mg of polymer in 2 mL of methanol). The dispersion was then drop-cast over mica for SEM and a copper grid for TEM analyses.


Electrode fabrication. 
For fabricating the electrodes, a homogeneous slurry was prepared by dispersing 4.75 mg of the desired sample (P-0, C-1, C-2, C-3, or Ex C-30) with 0.25 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in 500 μL of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). 100 μL of the slurry was coated on 1 cm2 area of carbon fiber paper to obtain a total loading of 1.0 mg cm−2. The electrodes were then dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. For comparison, an electrode coated with MWCNTs was also prepared with 0.33 mg cm−2 loading.


Electrochemical measurements. 
All the electrochemical tests were carried out using a BioLogic VMP3 instrument. To check the electrochemical performance of the samples, three-electrode cells were assembled using the carbon fiber paper coated with the desired sample as the working electrode, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode in 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte. The potential window was fixed from −0.2 to −1.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The discharge capacities of the samples were measured by the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) experiment at different current rates of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 A g−1. The discharge capacity values of the MWCNT sample were recorded at 1.5, 3.0, and 7.5 A g−1 current rates. Here, the current rates are given, considering the total loading of the electrode material in the working electrode. The discharge capacities of the samples measured in the three-electrode cell assembly are reported in the units of mA h g−1(polymer) and mA h g−1. mA h g−1(polymer) indicates that the capacity values are normalized exclusively by considering the loading of the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer in the working electrode (e.g., 0.6 mg for C-3; see Section S3 in the ESI† for the polymer content in other samples). On the other hand, the unit of mA h g−1 represents the discharge capacity value normalized by considering the cumulative mass loading of the working electrode, which includes the polymer, MWCNTs, and PVDF binder (mass loading of 1 mg for P-0, C-1, C-2, and C-3 electrodes). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was carried out at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s−1.
The performance of symmetric and hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) devices was first analyzed in 1 M LiClO4/PC liquid electrolyte. Henceforth, HSC devices fabricated using the above-mentioned liquid electrolytes are termed LS-HSC, where ‘LS’ stands for the liquid-state electrolyte. For the symmetric device, an electrochemical cell was prepared by dipping two electrodes coated with the C-3 sample (1.0 mg cm−2 loading) in a beaker filled with 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte, and the electrochemical cell (device) is marked as C-3∥C-3. The device was characterized by CV analysis at 50 mV s−1 scan rate within the 0 to 1.4 V voltage window. A HSC was fabricated using carbon paper coated with C-3 and activated carbon (AC) as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The AC electrode was characterized by CV analysis at 50 mV s−1 scan rate in 1 M LiClO4/PC liquid electrolyte within the voltage range of −0.2 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in the three-electrode configuration. To balance the loading to the two electrodes, the charge storage capacity of the AC sample was determined by GCD analysis at 0.5 A g−1 current rate. The ratio of the positive and negative electrode loadings was optimized to be 1.5:1 (calculation is given in Section S3, ESI†). The CV data of the LS-HSC device were recorded at scan rates of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s−1, and GCD data were recorded at current rates of 2.0, 1.0, 0.4, and 0.2 A g−1 within the voltage window of 0 to 2.4 V. Here, the current rates are normalized with respect to the total loading of both the positive and negative electrodes. Hence, the specific capacities are represented in the unit of mA h g−1(total), where ‘total’ represents the specific capacity normalized by considering the total mass loading of the electrode material loaded at the positive and negative electrodes.
For fabricating a quasi-solid-state HSC (QSS-HSC) device, a polymer gel electrolyte made of LiClO4/PC dissolved in a polymethylmethacrylate polymer matrix (PMMA/LiClO4/PC) was used, and the required amount of electrode materials (1 mg of C-3 and 1.5 mg of AC) was coated over 1 cm2 area of the Grafoil current collector. The CV data for the QSS-HSC device were analyzed at 50, 100, and 200 mV s−1 scan rates and GCD data were was recorded at current rates of 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.4 A g−1. The application of the QSS-HSC device was demonstrated by lighting a red LED bulb.


BET experimental setup. 
The pore size distribution and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of MWCNT, P-0, and C-3 composite polymers were analyzed at 77 K using a Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI (automatic surface area and pore size analyzer). The surface area of the samples was determined according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method at 77 K bath temperature, and nitrogen was used as the adsorption gas. The pore size distribution plots were calculated according to density functional theory (DFT), with N2 as a model at 77 K on carbon (slit pore, NLDFT equilibrium model).


Synthesis of P(NDI2OD-T2) (P-0). 
The monomer NDI-2OD-Br2 was synthesized following the previous reports for the same from our group.47 NDI-2OD-Br2 (0.200 g, 0.203 mmole) and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (0.099 g, 0.203 mmol) were weighed accurately into a dry Schlenk tube containing a magnetic stir bar, and 10 ml of dry 4-ter-butyl toluene was added to it. This was followed by nitrogen purging for half an hour with constant stirring at room temperature. Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (Pd(Ph3)2Cl2) (5.84 mg, 0.005075 mmol) was added to the above solution under a nitrogen atmosphere and again kept for nitrogen purging for half an hour; subsequently, the Schlenk tube was transferred into a preheated oil bath at 160 °C and stirring was continued for 2 hours. Afterward, it was cooled to room temperature and directly precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Büchner funnel. The polymer was purified via Soxhlet extraction in methanol (24 hours) followed by acetone. It was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Yield (191 mg, 95%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 8.83–8.52 (br, 2H aromatic), 7.34 (br, 4H), 4.12 (br, 4H), 1.99 (br, 2H), 1.26 (br, 64H), 0.86 (br, 12 H). Mn: 188000, Mw: 597000, ĐM: 3.18.


Synthesis of the polymer composite C-X. 
MWCNT and P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer composites (named C-X) were synthesized using the same procedure as that for P(NDI2OD-T2), except for the addition of the required amount of MWCNTs. For instance, for C-1, NDI-2OD-Br2 (0.200 g, 0.203 mmol), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2-bithiophene (0.099 g, 0.203 mmol) and 30 mg of MWCNTs were taken in a dry Schlenk tube and 10 ml of dry 4-ter-butyl toluene was added to it. (Pd(Ph3)2Cl2) (5.84 mg, 0.005075 mmol) was added as the catalyst, and then the same procedure as given for P(NDI2OD-T2) was followed. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer was directly precipitated in methanol (dissolution of the polymer in THF before precipitation into methanol was avoided to retain the MWCNT incorporated polymer network obtained during the in situ polymerization) and filtered through a Büchner funnel. Yield (224 mg–30 mg MWCNT = 194 mg, 96%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 8.84–8.55 (br, 2H aromatic), 7.36 (br, 4H), 4.15 (br, 4H), 2.0 (br, 2H), 1.29 (br, 64H), 0.89 (br, 12 H). Mn: 144000, Mw: 351000, ĐM: 2.44.


Synthesis of the polymer composite C-2. 
C-2 was synthesized following the same procedure as given for C-1, but using 60 mg of MWCNTs. Yield (253 mg–60 mg MWCNTs = 193 mg, 96%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 8.84–8.55 (br, 2H aromatic), 7.36 (br, 4H), 4.15 (br, 4H), 2.0 (br, 2H), 1.29 (br, 64H), 0.89 (br, 12 H). Mn: 189000, Mw: 465000, ĐM: 2.46.


Synthesis of the polymer composite C-3. 
C-3 was synthesized following the same procedure as given for C-1, but using 100 mg MWCNTs. Yield (289 mg–100 mg MWCNTs = 189 mg, 94.0%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 8.84–8.55 (br, 2H aromatic), 7.36 (br, 4H), 4.15 (br, 4H), 2.0 (br, 2H), 1.29 (br, 64H), 0.89 (br, 12 H). Mn: 123000, Mw: 320000, ĐM: 2.60.


Ex C-30 polymer composite. 
For the purpose of comparison, an externally mixed MWCNT polymer composite was also prepared by mixing 30 mg of MWCNTs with the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer, and the composite is marked as Ex C-30, where the ‘Ex’ indicates externally mixed.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
NDI-2OD-Br2 was synthesized using a previously reported procedure in the literature.47–49 The synthetic scheme and characterization of NDI-2OD-Br2 are given in ESI, Section S1.†Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of P(NDI-2OD-T2) and its composites with MWCNTs following the in situ strategy.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic scheme for the P(NDI2OD-T2) (P-0) polymer and its composites with MWCNTs (C-X). 
The commonly adopted procedure for the synthesis of P(NDI-2OD-T2) takes a long time (3 days) using the Stille polymerization, as reported in the literature.3,47–49 The polymerization is usually carried out in toluene at a temperature of around 90 °C for 72 h, resulting in a moderate molecular weight of ∼ 50000. In this work, we have adopted some modifications in the reaction conditions like the use of the high boiling solvent 4-ter-butyl toluene and also conducting the polymerization at a higher temperature of 160 °C. Interestingly, the polymerization was completed in a very short time of two hours. The pristine polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) synthesized by this modified procedure is referred to as P-0 in this manuscript. The composites of P(NDI2OD-T2) with MWCNTs were synthesized via in situ polymerization by taking various amounts of MWCNTs along with the reactants at the start of the polymerization. These composites are named C-X, where x = 1, 2, and 3 represent the three composites with increasing MWCNT content in the feed. The polymers were directly precipitated into methanol (instead of the traditional method of dissolving in THF and precipitating into methanol and repeating this a couple of times) to avoid the loss of the incorporated MWCNTs. The probable weight percentage incorporation of MWCNTs in the three composites was calculated by dividing the feed weight of the MWCNTs with the final total yield obtained after drying the precipitate from methanol. Thus, the weight percent incorporation of MWCNTs was calculated to be 13.4%, 23.7%, and 34.6% for C-1, C-2, and C-3, respectively.
The polymers were structurally characterized by proton NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular weight was determined using GPC (gel permeation chromatography) in THF after filtering the samples using filter paper followed by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters to remove the MWCNTs. The atomic composition of P(NDI2OD-T2) and its composites was characterized by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The EDX data indicate the presence of carbon and oxygen as the main elements and sulfur as a trace element as summarized in Table S1.† The characterization details are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1–S4†). The composite polymers exhibited good solubility in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chloroform; they were sparingly soluble in dichloromethane (DCM) and chlorobenzene and insoluble in dimethylformamide (DMF). In all the solvents, the MWCNTs remained insoluble. The molecular weight data are given in Table 1. The polymers exhibited high molecular weights with Mn ranging from 123000 to 189000 and Mw in the range of 320000–597000.

The thermal characterization of the polymer and composites was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 2 shows the TGA plots of the P-0 and C-X samples along with that of pristine MWCNTs. The polymers exhibited good thermal stability with the onset decomposition temperature (Td) greater than >450 °C. The TGA curves were also used to determine the incorporation of MWCNTs in each of the polymer composites using the formula given below.50  
 Fig. 2  TGA data of P-0, MWCNT, and the C-X samples taken in the temperature range of 40–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. 
The mass loss was taken as the vertical distance between the two tangential lines drawn on the mass loss curve, as shown in Fig. S5.†51 The % remaining for pristine MWCNTs was 96.44, and the % loss of the pure polymer (P-0) was 62.43. The percentage of MWCNT incorporation in the three composites C-1, C-2, and C-3 was determined to be 13.91, 24.06, and 34.81%, respectively.
Quantification of the polymer (and thereby MWCNTs) can also be done using absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the pristine polymer P-0 and the composite polymers C-X recorded in chloroform. P-0 shows two absorption bands in the spectra corresponding to the π–π* transition (300 nm to 450 nm) and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band between 500 and 800 nm.49 The molar extinction coefficient (ε) of P-0 was estimated to be 35954 L M−1 cm−1 using the Beer–Lambert Law (Fig. S6†). Applying this value of ε, the concentration of the polymer in the composites C-X was calculated as detailed in ESI, Section S2.† The % MWCNTs estimated from the absorption spectra is tabulated in Table 1. Compared to the % incorporation of MWCNTs obtained from the TGA analysis, these values obtained from the absorption spectra are on the higher side for all the C-X samples. One reason for this variation could be the scattering of incident light due to the presence of the MWCNTs observed in the composites compared to the P-0 sample.

Morphology. 
The morphology of all the samples under study was characterized by FE-SEM and TEM analyses. As shown in Fig. 4, the FE-SEM image of P-0 (Fig. 4a) shows ribbon-like structures of the polymer, whereas the MWCNTs (Fig. 4b) possess an entangled tubular network structure. Fig. 4c–e compare the morphology of the composite polymers with increasing loading of MWCNTs. The uniform growth of the polymer layer over the in situ incorporated MWCNTs can be evidenced from the FESEM images. The entangled porous network of the pristine MWCNTs is also retained in all the polymer composites, and no bulk or agglomerated growth of the polymer is observed, indicating the maximum contact of the polymer layer with the carbon support. However, compared to C-1 (Fig. 4c), the morphology of the C-2 (Fig. 4d) and C-3 (Fig. 4e) samples appears to be more porous, which suggests that a higher percentage of MWCNTs results in better dispersion of the polymer during the course of the polymerization reaction.

The samples were further characterized by TEM. Fig. 5a shows the ribbon-like morphology of the polymer, as observed in the FE-SEM image (Fig. 4a). The tubular structure of MWCNTs with an average diameter of 8–15 nm is shown in Fig. 5b. The TEM images of the composite polymers (Fig. 5c–e) further confirm the uniform dispersion of the polymer over the carbon nanotubes. An overall increase in the average diameter of the tubular structure to 30–50 nm is clearly observed (in contrast to 8–15 nm for the pristine MWCNTs), which further confirms the uniform growth of the polymer along the MWCNTs in the C-X samples. In order to bring out the contrast between the in situ MWCNT incorporation versus the physical mixing of MWCNTs with the polymer, carbon nanotubes were externally mixed with the polymer. 30 wt% of MWCNTs in P-0 (Ex C-30) was prepared by dispersing them together in methanol and drop-casting on a silicon wafer or TEM grid for FE-SEM and TEM imaging, respectively.

The agglomerated deposition of the polymer on the MWCNTs is clearly visible in the FE-SEM image (Fig. 6a) of the Ex C-30 composite. The TEM image in Fig. 6b shows that the polymer is spread over the MWCNT network as a layer. Such inhomogeneous distribution and undesired agglomeration were absent in the polymer composite samples prepared by the in situ process. The microscopy images prove the effectiveness of the in situ mixing of MWCNTs with the monomers prior to polymerization. The uniform distribution of the polymer chains on the MWCNT network is expected to enhance the electrochemical performance of the C-X composites compared to the pristine polymer and physically mixed polymer/MWCNT composite.

Surface area and pore size. 
The surface area and nature of porosity in the MWCNT, P-0, and C-3 composites were determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at 77 K. Fig. 7 shows the pore size distribution (Fig. 7a) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. 7b) of the C-3 composite polymer. Similar plots for MWCNTs and P-0 are given in Fig. S7a–d.† MWCNTs and C-3 composites exhibit a characteristic type III isotherm. The specific surface area values calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model for the samples were: MWCNTs (200.7 m2 g−1), P-0 (81.1 m2 g−1), and C-3 (224.8 m2 g−1). The BET data signify that the in situ incorporation of MWCNTs improves the surface area of the C-3 composite compared to the pristine polymer, which is in line with the FESEM data of the respective samples.
 Fig. 7  (a) Pore size distribution profile and (b) nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the C-3 sample. 
The pore size distribution profiles for the MWCNTs (Fig. S7b†), P-0 (Fig. S7a†), and C-3 (Fig. 7a) show that MWCNTs exhibits both the microporous and mesoporous nature with more percentage of the latter. The pore size distribution of the pristine polymer is mostly in the microporous domain. On the other hand, in the composite (C-3), the pores are distributed in both microporous and mesoporous regimes. The average pore diameter of MWCNTs was ∼12 nm, while that for the polymers was in the range of ∼3 nm, as calculated using a density functional theory (DFT) desorption model. Fig. 7a shows that with the inclusion of MWCNTs, the number of pores in the mesoporous region increases compared to the P-0 sample (Fig. S7a†). The difference between the C-3 composite and the P-0 polymer originates from the morphological contrast between them. As evidenced in the FE-SEM and TEM analyses, in C-3, the polymer layer is grown in a thin and homogeneous manner over the MWCNTs without blocking the void space created by the entangled MWCNTs. As a consequence, the porous architecture of MWCNTs containing both micropores and mesopores is retained in the C-3 composite. It is anticipated that such a mesoporous framework could facilitate the electrolyte's infiltration when the sample is employed as the electrode material in EESDs.


Electrochemical characterization. 
The electrochemical performance of all the samples was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis carried out in a three-electrode cell in 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte.17Fig. 8a compares the CV profiles for the P-0, C-X, and Ex C-30 samples recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The CV profiles show the prominent redox peaks during the cathodic and anodic scans in all the cases. Compared to P-0, all the samples exhibit high current, signifying the augmented charge storage capacity of the polymer composites with MWCNTs. However, the increase in the current response (and redox behavior) is much more prominent in the C-X samples than in the Ex C-30 sample. The CV plots of MWCNTs in Fig. S8† show a nearly rectangular feature which is associated with the electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC). Furthermore, the current response observed in the CV plots of MWCNTs is significantly low compared to that of the C-X samples. The EDLC behavior of MWCNTs confirms that the MWCNTs do not take part in the redox reactions; instead, the presence of MWCNTs in the polymer composites eases the transport of electrons by providing a conducting network. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the observed enhancement in the faradaic current of the composite samples originates exclusively from the intrinsic redox activity of the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer.
 Fig. 8  (a) CV profiles for the P-0, C-1, C-2, C-3, and Ex C-30 samples recorded at 10 mV s−1 scan rate; (b) Nyquist plots recorded for the C-3 and Ex C-30 samples; (c) discharge profiles for the P-0, C-1, C-2, C-3, and Ex C-30 samples plotted at a current rate of 0.5 A g−1; (d) CV data of the C-3 sample recorded at different scan rates; and (e) discharge profiles plotted at different current rates for the C-3 sample. 
The position of the redox peaks (−0.9/−1.2 V and −0.65/−1.04 V vs. Ag/Ag+) was found to be more or less similar in all the composites (Fig. 8a), implying that the mode of MWCNT incorporation does not affect the redox properties of the samples. However, compared to the physical mixing, the inclusion of MWCNTs following the in situ strategy allows more number of redox-active centers being exposed for participating in the faradaic reactions and enhances the redox activity of the polymer in the C-X composites. To validate this, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the samples was carried out. Fig. 8b compares the Nyquist plots corresponding to the C-3 and Ex C-30 samples (Nyquist plots for the other samples are given in Fig. S9†). The equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the C-3 sample was found to be 47 Ω, which is comparable to that of all the other samples under study. Interestingly, despite the similar ESR value, the Nyquist plot for the Ex C-30 sample shows a small semicircle in a higher frequency region, signifying the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which is not noticed in the case of the other samples. This observation suggests that MWCNTs present in the C-X composites could facilitate the electron transfer more effectively than in Ex C-30, revealing the advantage of the in situ strategy for the inclusion of MWCNTs into the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer.

Fig. 8c compares the discharge capacity of all the samples evaluated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) experiment at a current rate of 0.50 A g−1. It can be noted that the discharge curves of the polymer composites appear with an apparent voltage plateau, consistent with the distinct reduction peak observed in the respective voltammogram profiles. Hence, the nature of the CV and galvanostatic discharge profiles of the polymer composites points out the battery-type behavior of the materials; therefore, in this work, the performance of the composite materials is quantified in terms of capacity rather than capacitance.52,53 On the other hand, MWCNTs exhibit a linear voltage response during the GCD process (Fig. S11a†), which is the characteristic of capacitor-like charge storage behavior, and the corresponding electrochemical performance is quantified as capacitance.
As evident in Fig. 8c, the average discharge capacities obtained for the C-X samples are considerably higher than those of the P-0 and Ex C-30 samples, which is in line with their CV data (Fig. 8a). The specific capacities obtained for the P-0 and Ex C-30 samples are 2 and 20 mA h g−1(polymer), respectively, at a current rate of 0.50 A g−1. The reason behind the incredibly low capacity of the P-0 sample is that the sample does not contain any conducting additives. Therefore, the active centers could not participate in the faradaic processes due to the lack of facile transport of electrons throughout the electrode. This indicates the necessity of conducting additives in the electrode to achieve the desired electrochemical performance. The C-3 sample delivers a discharge capacity of 80 mA h g−1(polymer), which is the highest among all the C-X samples (54 and 74 mA h g−1(polymer) for C-1 and C-2, respectively). It must be noted that the capacity values given in Fig. 8c are normalized with respect to the loading of the active material (i.e., P(NDI2OD-T2)) in the working electrode owing to the negligible contribution from the MWCNT additive (Fig. S11a†) to the total capacity of the composite electrode. Moreover, the capacity values considering the total loading of the electrodes (Fig. S11b†) also highlight the superior performance of the polymer composites prepared using the in situ method. Additionally, the discharge performance of the C-X composites is found to improve at a higher content of MWCNTs.
The C-X samples’ improved capacity values could be attributed to their porous morphology with a uniform coating of the polymer layer over the MWCNT network, as observed in the FE-SEM and TEM images (Fig. 4c–e and 5c–e). As a result, the exposed redox-active moieties could readily access the electrons traveling through the MWCNT network. Moreover, the porous architecture and improved surface area favor the electrolyte infiltration into the bulk of the electrode material and facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte ions. Therefore, the short diffusion path for the electrons and electrolyte ions offers maximum participation of the redox-active centers during the charge/discharge process. On the other hand, in the case of the Ex C-30 sample, the inhomogeneous distribution of the agglomerated polymer layer over the MWCNT network (Fig. 6a and b) blocks the transport of the charge carriers. Therefore, only a fraction of the redox-active centers could participate in the electrochemical reactions as reflected in the low discharge capacity (Fig. 8c) and high Rct value (Fig. 8b) of the Ex C-30 sample.
The CV data recorded at various scan rates for the C-3 sample are given in Fig. 8d (similar plots for the other samples are shown in Fig. S10a–d†). Fig. 8d shows that the peak current during the anodic and cathodic scans gradually increases with an increase in the scan rate from 5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1. However, at a higher scan rate (>50 mV s−1), the shape of the CV curve shows significant deviation, and the prominent redox peaks are found to disappear. This could be due to the low ionic conductivity of the organic electrolyte, which impedes the access of electrolyte ions to the redox centers of the electrode material at a higher scan rate. The discharge profiles of the polymer composites at different current rates are also recorded. As shown in Fig. 8e, the C-3 sample exhibits 40% retention of capacity when the current rate increases from 0.50 A g−1 to 5 A g−1. The discharge profiles at different current rates for the other samples are given in Fig. S11c–f.†
After the electrochemical characterization in the three-electrode configuration, the polymer composite C-3 was taken forward to demonstrate its performance in a real device. At first, a device in the symmetric configuration (C-3∥C-3) was fabricated in 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte using two electrodes coated with C-3 composite materials. Surprisingly, no significant redox behavior was observed during the CV analysis at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. S12a†). Nevertheless, the current response was found to be very small even at a working voltage window of 1.4 V, which is slightly higher than the potential used during the electrochemical analysis in the three-electrode cell (i.e., 1.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+).
The device-level performance of the C-3 polymer composite was further explored by fabricating an asymmetric device (AC∥C-3)54 using the C-3 sample as the negative electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the positive electrode material in 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte. The asymmetric configuration enables expanding the voltage window of the device without hampering the electrode and electrolyte stability. Fig. S12b and c† compare the electrochemical performance of the positive electrode (−0.2 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+) and the negative electrode (−1.4 to −0.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+) obtained from the CV and GCD experiments within the corresponding voltage range. The ratio of the active material loading in the positive and negative electrodes is 1.5:1 (AC: C-3), which was calculated by considering the capacity of the individual electrodes measured from the three-electrode study. The details of the calculation are given in the ESI (Section S3†).
As the asymmetric configuration demonstrated in this study contains two electrodes with different charge storage mechanisms, i.e., one EDLC type (AC) and the other battery-type (C-3 composite), the devices are called hybrid capacitors/supercapacitors.55,56 The electrochemical performance of the AC∥C-3 hybrid supercapacitor device containing 1 M LiClO4/PC liquid electrolyte (LS-HSC) was analyzed within the extended voltage range of 0 to 2.4 V (Fig. S12d†). In contrast to the C-3∥C-3 device, the feature of the CV plot in the LS-HSC device (Fig. S12d†) indicates the involvement of faradaic reactions during the anodic and cathodic scans. Besides, a remarkable improvement in the current response was achieved with the LS-HSC compared to that in the symmetric (C-3∥C-3) device (Fig. S12d†). These observations suggest that the high working voltage (2.4 V) of the LS-HSC device helps in accomplishing the redox activity of the C-3 composite in the two-electrode cell assembly. The CV and GCD profiles of the LS-HSC device are given in Fig. S13a and b.† As observed from Fig. S13b,† the LS-HSC device delivers 8.5 mA h g−1(total) and 7.0 mA h g−1(total) of specific capacity at the current rate of 0.2 A g−1 and 2.0 A g−1, respectively (current rate and capacity values are normalized for the total mass loading at the positive and negative electrodes). In the Nyquist plot (Fig. S13c†), the equivalent series resistance (ESR) for the LS-HSC device is 65 Ω. During the cycling stability experiment of the LS-HSC device (Fig. S13d†), the device's capacity increases gradually during the initial cycles and reaches the maximum value of 11 mA h g−1(total) after 1000 cycles. Owing to the initial increase in capacity during the prolonged cycling of the device, the capacity recorded at 1.0 A g−1 current rate after 1000 cycles is close to the value obtained at 0.2 A g−1. The improvement in the capacity during the cycling stability test is possibly due to the enhanced electrochemical activity of the material during cycling. However, in the subsequent cycles, the device's capacity drops gradually, showing 80% retention of the maximum capacity after 2500 cycles with 92% coulombic efficiency.
Later, a QSS-HSC device (quasi-solid-state AC∥C-3) was fabricated using the PMMA/PC/LiClO4 polymer gel electrolyte. The CV profiles recorded at various scan rates for the QSS-HSC device are given in Fig. 9a. The device exhibits 11 mA h g−1(total) discharge capacity at a current rate of 0.4 A g−1 (Fig. 9b). Also, it retains 6.9 mA h g−1(total) of the specific capacity even at 3.0 A g−1, indicating the good rate capability of the system. It is observed that the charging capacity values of the device at 0.4 and 1.0 A g−1 are higher compared to the corresponding discharge capacities resulting in low coulombic efficiency of the device at lower current rates. However, the device could perform better at higher current rates with more than 95% coulombic efficiency. The resistance of the QSS-HSC device is measured from the EIS analysis, and the corresponding Nyquist plot is given in Fig. 9c. The device exhibits an ESR of 8.8 Ω without a prominent semicircle feature in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plot. It is worth mentioning that the overall resistance observed for QSS-HSC is much lower than that of many of the organic electrolyte-based supercapacitors reported earlier.57–59 The low resistance of QSS-HSC is attributed to a seamless pathway for the transport of charge carrier species throughout the electrode, which is achieved by creating a uniform and intimate contact of the polymer layer with the MWCNT backbone in the C-3 polymer composite, as already explained in the previous sections.

The cycling stability of the QSS-HSC device was analyzed at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1. As seen in Fig. 9d, the device could retain 60% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles. The overall electrochemical performance of the C-3 composite-based LS-HSC and QSS-HSC devices indeed highlights that the faradaic charge storage properties of the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer are improved by means of in situ inclusion of MWCNTs into the polymer matrix. The electrochemical performance of the C-3 composite in the three-electrode cell and the QSS-HSC device is compared with that of some of the previously reported redox-active polymers used as active electrode materials in supercapacitors (Table S2†). Furthermore, for demonstrating the device-level application, a 2.4 V QSS-HSC device is used for lighting a red LED bulb. The photographs of the various steps involved in the device fabrication are presented in Fig. 9e and f. A photograph of the glowing LED bulb powered with the QSS-HSC device is given in Fig. 9g, and a demonstration video is also attached with the ESI.†

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile synthesis protocol for the P(NDI2OD-T2) (P-0) polymer with a high molecular weight within a short period of time (2 h) for the first time by means of the modified Stille polymerization method. The inclusion of MWCNTs during the polymerization reaction was found to improve the physicochemical properties of the composite material compared to that of the pristine polymer. As a result, the composite sample prepared with 35% MWCNT content (C-3) following the in situ approach exhibited an 80 mA h g−1(polymer) discharge capacity, which is substantially higher than those of the pristine polymer and the composite prepared by physically mixing MWCNTs with the same quantity (Ex C-30). The C-3 polymer composite was further used for fabricating a high-voltage (2.4 V) hybrid supercapacitor taking the C-3 composite as a negative electrode (battery-type) and activated carbon (AC, capacitive electrode) as a positive electrode material. The electrochemical performance of the AC∥C-3 device was analyzed in 1 M LiClO4/PC liquid electrolyte (LS-HSC) and a PMMA/PC/LiClO4 polymer gel electrolyte (QSS-HSC). Both devices show comparable performance, which is attributed to the porous morphological architecture of the C-3 composite showing intimate contact of the polymer with the MWCNT conducting framework. This work provides new opportunities toward the design of conducting polymer-based robust electrode materials for non-aqueous hybrid supercapacitors.
