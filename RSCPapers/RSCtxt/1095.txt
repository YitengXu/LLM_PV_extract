    , Accepted 8th June 2013First published on 13th June 2013Abstract4,7-Bis(3,3′/4,4′-hexylthiophene-2-yl)benzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazoles (HT–BT–HT) were used as building blocks to construct a series of low bandgap π-conjugated copolymers for photovoltaic applications. The desired copolymers were obtained by incorporating the HT–BT–HT comonomers together with donor or acceptor units, such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), bis-EDOT, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP), and 2,3-dimethyl-TP, via a palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling method. A facile synthetic method has also been developed for the synthesis of several EDOT- and TP-based copolymers via direct C–H arylation of EDOT, bis-EDOT, and TP derivatives using the commercially available catalyst Pd(OAc)2 under Heck-type experimental conditions (Jeffery method). For all of the synthesized copolymers, moving the hexyl side chains of the HT unit in the HT–BT–HT comonomers from 3,3′-positions (close to BT, as in P1–P4) to 4,4′-positions (away from BT, as in P5–P8) led to a significant red shift of the UV-vis absorption spectrum, a decrease of the energy bandgap, an increase of the glass transition temperature, and more promising photovoltaic performances. The thin-film copolymer P7 incorporating TP units (–TP–HT–BT–HT–)n exhibited the most extended absorption (beyond 1000 nm) and the lowest optical bandgap (1.24 eV) among the synthesized copolymers. According to time-dependent density functional theory calculations, the TP unit, in contrast to EDOT, has its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) at the same level as BT. An extended π-conjugation along the TP and BT units leads to low-lying LUMO levels of the resulting copolymer P7 and in turn its reduced bandgap. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic photovoltaic devices employing copolymers P1–P8 were measured in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer (P1–P8):PC60BM (1:1 w/w)/Al. Copolymer P7 in particular showed the highest PCE of 3.32%.
Introduction
There is considerable interest in the preparation of π-conjugated polymers due to their promising optical and electronic properties1 for the development of novel organic photovoltaic materials.2 Over the past two decades, research has focused on a mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) as the standard electron-donating and electron-accepting materials, respectively, in polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells,1,2 and has brought important advances in understanding device physics and the associated improvements in the PCE.3 However, the efficiency of P3HT/PC60BM solar cells is limited by the relatively large bandgap of P3HT (∼1.90 eV).
Recently, donor–acceptor (D–A) type π-conjugated copolymers1a,2b,4 have been extensively used as low bandgap electron-donating materials in organic photovoltaic cells, as well as in other organic electronics materials.2,5 A great deal of effort is currently focused on finding a new combination of donor and acceptor units to increase PCE up to ∼10%. Benzothiadiazole (BT) is one of the most promising acceptor units to induce a narrow bandgap. Although BT can cause low solubility when incorporated into polymer chains, copolymers of BT with several electron-rich units (donors) that can improve the processability have been investigated6,7 and shown to reach high PCEs.8
We have recently reported the synthesis and characterization of a series of alternating copolymers of BT and different numbers of hexylthiophene (HT) units,9 showing a pronounced impact of introducing BT into poly-HT chains on the photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as the processability.9 The comonomer 4,7-bis(3,3′/4,4′-hexylthiophene-2-yl)benzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazole (HT–BT–HT) appears to be an interesting building block to construct highly processable low bandgap copolymers. Coupling these building blocks requires simple, efficient, and regioselective synthetic methods. Arylation methods involving a metal-catalyzed cross-coupling of organometallics and organic halides (e.g., Kumada, Negishi, Stille, and Suzuki type) are commonly employed in the synthesis of conjugated polymers.10 Moreover, a direct regioselective arylation of several heterocyclic compounds including thiophenes bearing electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups with aryl or heteroaryl halides has been recently reported.11,12 The scope of this reaction could also be extended to direct arylation of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT).12a,13 The aforementioned findings prompted us to investigate the synthesis of several oligomers and copolymers based on thieno[3,4-b]pyrazines (TP) via direct C–H arylation methodology, thus avoiding commonly used cross-coupling methods. Thus, we have recently reported the first examples of an efficient direct regioselective C–H arylation of TP derivatives with several bromoalkylthiophenes under ‘Heck-type’ experimental conditions (Jeffery modification method) with Pd(OAc)2/Bu4NBr as catalyst.14 This synthetic methodology has been used to prepare some π-conjugated copolymeric materials based on HT and TP moieties and showed pronounced photophysical and electrochemical properties.
In continuation of our interest in the synthesis of oligo- and polyalkylthiophenes,9,14,15 several π-conjugated copolymers were prepared via the commonly used palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling method by incorporating the HT–BT–HT comonomers with other donor or acceptor units to search for low bandgap donor polymers suitable for photovoltaic applications. Promising acceptor unit BT- and TP-based copolymers of polyalkylthiophene type were researched for low bandgap donor polymers and they achieved low efficiency <2% in organic solar cells.16–18 We schematically designed new TP- and EDOT-based copolymers and successfully synthesized them in a facile manner via direct C–H arylation under ‘Heck-type’ experimental conditions, and compared them with the same copolymers prepared by the Stille cross-coupling method. The structure–property relationships were investigated for new copolymers with the HT–BT–HT comonomers through intimate connection between experiment and molecular modeling. The positioning effect of hexyl chains in the HT units of the synthesized HT–BT–HT-based copolymers has been investigated and shown to have a pronounced impact on the photophysical and electrochemical properties. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of the geometry, electronic, optical properties and morphology as well as BHJ solar cell performances for devices incorporating P1–P8 as donor with PC60BM as acceptor was carried out to understand the behavior of the new copolymers. We obtained reasonable efficiency >3% in P7 due to the low bandgap and good miscibility with PC60BM without device optimization such as additives or extra layers.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of precursor monomers and comonomers
The four precursor comonomers 4,7-bis(5-bromo-3,3′/4,4′-hexylthiophene-2-yl)benzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazoles (HT–BT–HT; 1 and 3) and their corresponding tributylstannyl derivatives (2 and 4; Fig. 1) used as the building blocks to construct our designed copolymers were readily synthesized via our recently reported methods.9 In addition, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazines 5a, b and their corresponding 5,7-dibromo derivatives 6a, b (Fig. 1) were prepared and purified by flash silica gel chromatography in good yields. Their detailed synthetic procedure and spectral data have been recently published elsewhere.14 Several EDOT derivatives were also prepared in high yields by modification of the reported procedure (Scheme 1).19 Lithiating EDOT 7 with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at −80 °C followed by quenching the reaction mixture with tributyltin chloride afforded mainly 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)-3,4-EDOT (8) in 92% yield.

Moreover, lithiating bis-EDOT 9, prepared by lithiating 7 with n-BuLi and quenching with CuCl2,19a with n-BuLi at −80 °C followed by quenching with tributyltin chloride afforded a mixture of the corresponding mono- and di-tributyltin derivatives of bis-EDOT 10 and 11, respectively, which could be readily separated by flash silica gel column chromatography.
Polymer synthesis

Synthesis via the Stille cross-coupling method. 
The use of comonomers HT–BT–HT as building blocks in the synthesis of a wide variety of low bandgap π-conjugated copolymers via the Pd-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling method was first investigated (Scheme 2). The polymerization was performed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3)4 under microwave reaction conditions. The Stille cross-coupling of equimolar amounts of comonomers 1 with di-tributylstannyl-EDOT 8 or bis-EDOT 11 afforded the corresponding copolymers P1 and P2 in 97% and 93% yield, respectively. Under the same reaction conditions, copolymerization of comonomers 3 with 8 or 11 afforded the corresponding copolymers P5 and P6 in 88% and 89% yield, respectively.

After trying several reaction conditions, the Stille cross-coupling of 5,7-dibromothieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (6a) with 2 and 4 in DMF at 130 °C for only 15 min in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 afforded the corresponding copolymers P3 and P7, respectively, in high yields (92% and 91%, respectively) and with reasonable average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) values (Table 1). However, polymers that were sparingly soluble in most common organic solvents were obtained from the polymerization reaction at longer reaction times and/or at higher temperatures.

Copolymerization of 6b with 2 or 4 afforded the corresponding copolymers P4 and P8 in 85% and 93% yield, respectively. For the purpose of comparison with the synthesized copolymers, the copolymer PBTHT, which has only BT and HT units without additional donors, was also prepared by our previously reported method.9 It was synthesized by Stille cross-coupling of comonomers 2 or 4 with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole in dry DMF in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 under microwave reaction conditions.
The chemical structures of the resulting copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analyses. All the data were fully consistent with the proposed structures (see the ESI† for the 1H NMR spectra). After precipitation into methanol, the crude copolymers were collected by filtration and washed extensively with methanol, followed by Soxhlet extraction with methanol and acetone repeatedly to remove the by-products and the oligomers. Under the employed reaction conditions, all copolymers showed good solubility at room temperature in most common organic solvents, including chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, xylene and chlorobenzene (>5 mg mL−1). As shown in Table 1, the copolymers P5–P8 obtained from the copolymerization of 3 or 4 generally had lower Mn values than those observed for the corresponding copolymers P1–P4 originating from copolymerization of 1 or 2. This was most likely due to the expected higher steric hindrance resulting from the outward hexyl side chains at the 4,4′-positions of the thiophene rings of 3 or 4 during the course of the Stille coupling.


Synthesis via direct C–H arylation. 
We took advantage of the easy C–H arylation of EDOT12a,13 and TP14 to introduce a more facile synthetic method to construct some EDOT- and TP-based π-conjugated copolymers (Scheme 2). The polymerization reaction was performed in dry DMF in the presence of KOAc, Bu4NBr, and a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2. The results are shown in parentheses in Table 1. The Pd-catalyzed C–H arylation of EDOT 7 with comonomer 1 was first examined under thermal and microwave reaction conditions. Under thermal conditions, only oligomeric products were obtained with a maximum average molecular weight (Mn) of 3.9 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index (PDI) value of 3.82 even for a long reaction time, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). On the other hand, under microwave reaction conditions, the desired copolymer P1 was obtained in 95% yield with a good Mn value of 22.2 kg mol−1 and a PDI value of 1.61. The Pd-catalyzed C–H arylation of the comonomer 1 with bis-EDOT 9 afforded exclusively copolymer P2 in 82% yield. Under the same Heck reaction conditions, copolymerization of 3 with 7 or 9 afforded the corresponding copolymers P5 and P6, respectively, with high yields (91% and 90%, respectively). Moreover, copolymerization of 1 or 3 with 5b afforded the desired copolymers P4 and P8 in 80% and 90% yield, respectively. The 1H NMR and UV-vis spectral data of the resulting copolymers (P1, P2, P4–P6, and P8) were found to be identical when compared with the same corresponding copolymers prepared via the Stille cross-coupling method. It is worth mentioning that we were unable to synthesize the copolymers P3 and P7via direct C–H arylation of comonomer 1 or 3 with thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (5a) due to the possibility of obtaining cross-linked copolymers, as previously reported for similar polymerization reactions.14

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of copolymers P1–P8 were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under nitrogen atmosphere and compared with data obtained from PBTHT. TGA revealed that the residual weights of copolymers were all greater than 50% when the temperature rose to 800 °C (Fig. S17†). The copolymers showed an almost one-step decomposition. The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td, 95 wt% residues) were in the range of 351–390 °C (Table 1), which could be ascribed to side chain decomposition upon heating,20 indicating the high thermal stabilities of the synthesized copolymers. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the synthesized copolymers P1–P8 determined by DSC are summarized in Table 1 and their DSC curves are shown in Fig. S18.†
The polymer samples were heated to 300 °C, and the reported DSC data were obtained from the second heating cycle. The DSC analysis revealed that PBTHT with only one BT and one HT in its repeating units is an amorphous material with Tg of 72.4 °C (Table 1). The other copolymers (P1–P8) showed higher Tg values in the range of 107–194 °C. The Tg value increased as the polymers were incorporated with the donor or acceptor units in the order of EDOT (109.5 °C for P1 and 118.8 °C for P5), 2,3-dimethyl-TP (107.0 °C for P4 and 171.5 °C for P8), bis-EDOT (141.8 °C for P2 and 185.7 °C for P6), and TP (151.8 °C for P3 and 194.6 °C for P7), indicating highly ordered structures with strong intermolecular interactions in the latter copolymers. The copolymers incorporated with bis-EDOT (P2 and P6) showed higher Tg values than the ones with EDOT (P1 and P5), and this self-rigidification after inserting the second EDOT in the polymer backbone has been attributed to the non-covalent S⋯O intramolecular interaction, which would increase the planarity of the polymers.21 The copolymers obtained from the copolymerization of the comonomers 3 or 4 (P5–P8) generally had higher Tg values than the corresponding copolymers originating from comonomers 1 or 2 (P1–P4). This was most likely due to the more favorable intermolecular interactions between more planar polymer chains in the former class of copolymers, as shown in the structures of the model fragments of P1, P3, P5, and P7. These structures were optimized in quantum mechanical calculations with the density functional theory (DFT) at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) (Fig. 2). In the copolymers P1 and P3, as well as in half of the repeating units of PBTHT, the inward hexyl side chains at the 3,3′-positions of the thiophene rings of 1 or 2 are placed adjacent to the six-membered phenyl ring of BT, and the steric repulsion between them is released by twisting the dihedral angles by ∼50°. This should reduce the effective π-conjugation length. On the other hand, in the copolymers P5 and P7, the inward H atoms at the 3,3′-positions of the thiophenes can form a pseudo-hydrogen bond with the N atoms of BT, favoring a planar configuration, while the outward hexyl side chains at the 4,4′-positions are placed adjacent to the five-membered thieno rings of the EDOT and TP groups without suffering from significant steric hindrance, even in a planar configuration. A similar effect has also been found in several previous studies.6c,22 Based on these results, with the high thermal stability and highly ordered morphology, the synthesized copolymers could be good candidates for active-layer materials in various organic devices.

Optical properties

Positioning effect of the hexyl chains in the HT–BT–HT comonomer units. 

Fig. 3a, b, c, and d show the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the copolymers P1–P8 and PBTHT obtained from their chlorobenzene solutions and their corresponding spin-coated thin films, respectively. The absorption maxima (λmax), the onset wavelengths (λonset), and the optical bandgaps (Eopg) are summarized in Table 2. The thin-film absorption spectra for all copolymers were red-shifted and broadened compared to their corresponding absorptions in solution, reflecting the increased interchain interaction and ordering as well as the extended π-conjugations in the solid state. Accordingly, the optical bandgaps of all polymers, which were determined from λonset [Eopg (eV) = 1240/λonset (nm)], were lower in thin films than in solution. The amount of the red shift of λonset was significantly larger for the supposedly more planar polymers incorporated with 3 or 4 [P5 (156 nm), P6 (157 nm), and P7 (152 nm)] than the more twisted polymers incorporated with 1 or 2 [P1 (70 nm), P2 (59 nm), and P3 (86 nm)], as expected from the higher Tg values of the former class of copolymers. For the same reason, the low-Tg polymer PBTHT also exhibited a weak red shift of 51 nm from the in-solution λonset to thin-film λonset.

In fact, not only the amount of the solution-to-thin-film red shift but also the observed wavelength of the absorption onset λonset itself, either in solution or in thin films, was higher for the former class of polymer [P5 (841 nm), P6 (867 nm), P7 (1003 nm), or P8 (970 nm) in thin films] than for the latter [P1 (694 nm), P2 (726 nm), P3 (820 nm), or P4 (842 nm), as well as PBTHT (644 nm) in thin films]. Again, moving the hexyl chains from the 3,3′- to the 4,4′-positions of the thiophene rings, relative to the central BT unit, appeared to lead to a higher degree of planarity of the polymer backbones and to an extended effective π-conjugation length. This produced a red shift of the absorption spectra and thus a reduction of the optical bandgap. Similar behavior was observed in the UV-vis absorption spectra of similar polymers.23


Effect of the donor and acceptor moieties. 
The copolymers P1–P8 were characterized by two (or more) major absorption peaks in the range of 300–1200 nm, a feature which is commonly observed for alternating donor–acceptor copolymers (Fig. 3 and Table 2). As seen in the diagrams of the molecular orbitals and the electronic transitions of the model fragments of the EDOT-based copolymers P1 and P5 (Fig. 4a, obtained from the DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) quantum mechanical calculations at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) at the optimized geometries shown in Fig. 2), the long-wavelength absorption peak (λmax ≥ 520 nm) should originate from the lowest-energy singlet–singlet transition (denoted by the solid arrow) corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) localized in the donor units (HT–Z–HT where Z is the additional donor such as EDOT) to the low-lying lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO) localized in the acceptor units (BT or TP). The short-wavelength absorption peak (λmax ≤ 500 nm in solution) should be attributed to the next-lowest-energy transition (denoted by the dashed arrows) mostly localized in the acceptor units (HT–Z–HT; HOMO to LUMO+1 or BT; HOMO−1 to LUMO).

The energy levels of the occupied and unoccupied MOs are denoted by the black and red horizontal lines, respectively. The positive and negative phases of each orbital are represented by the green and pink lobes, respectively. The lowest and next lowest energy electronic transitions are denoted together by the solid and dashed arrows, respectively. The thickness of the arrow is a crude representation of the oscillator strength of each transition. (Bottom panel) The absorption spectra are constructed from the TDDFT singlet–singlet electronic transitions (blue solid bars and curves), whose peak positions and heights are from the calculated transition energies and oscillator strengths. The calculated transition wavelengths are in good agreement with the peak maximum positions of the experimental UV-vis absorption spectra (thin solid curves). 
As seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, the wavelengths of the calculated electronic transitions (thick solid bars and curves) were in good agreement with the positions of the absorption peak maxima (λmax) in the experimental UV-vis spectra (thin solid curves). According to the DFT/TDDFT calculations on the Z unit (Fig. 5), the TP unit has a very low LUMO level comparable to that of BT (−2.48 versus −2.34 eV) and opposite to EDOT (−0.29 eV). Thus, when TP is incorporated as Z in HT–Z–HT–BT, their closely spaced (in energy) LUMO levels should mix, and the resulting copolymers P3 and P7, especially the more planar P7, would have an extended π-conjugation in the LUMO levels and in turn low-lying LUMO and LUMO+1 levels (Fig. 4b). This extends the low-energy absorption of P3 and P7 to longer wavelengths, and polymer P7 in particular exhibited a strong absorption band in the longest wavelength among synthesized polymers (λmax = 658 nm in solution and 704 nm in thin film) and extending beyond 1000 nm (λonset = 1003 nm in thin film). The lowest LUMO level among all the polymers was observed for P7 and was confirmed by electrochemical analysis, as discussed in the next section. On the other hand, PBTHT (HT–BT–HT–BT) has every other BT unit suffering from steric repulsion with the hexyl side chains of HT, as discussed in the previous section. The dihedral angles in HT–BT–HT units should be considerably twisted (∼50°), reducing the effective π-conjugation length. As a result, the HOMO should be localized in each HT unit and the LUMO in each BT unit without any significant conjugation between the units, leading to the increase of the bandgap. Indeed, PBTHT showed a higher bandgap than other polymers P1–P8.

The energy levels of the occupied and unoccupied MOs are denoted by the black and red horizontal lines, respectively. The positive and negative phases of each orbital are represented by the blue and red lobes, respectively. 
When the calculated HOMO/LUMO levels and bandgaps of these donor polymers were plugged into the so-called Scharber diagram,5e,k as performed in our previous study on a similar type of BT-based donor copolymer,24 it was predicted that the TP-based P7 polymer (with the calculated LUMO level at −3.21 eV and the calculated bandgap of 1.76 eV) in a thin-film device mixed with PC60BM would show a higher PCE (3.0–3.5%) than the EDOT-based P5 polymer (with the calculated LUMO level at −3.00 eV and the calculated bandgap of 1.89 eV to provide a PCE of 2.0–2.5%). This was also confirmed by illuminated J–V measurements, as discussed below. The PCE predicted for P7 was as high as the PCE predicted for one of the most well-known donor polymers, cyclopentadithiophene–BT (CPDTBT), in our previous study.24
From the calculated LUMO level at −3.21 eV and the calculated bandgap of 1.74 eV, we had predicted the PCE of CPDTBT as 3.0–3.5% and this value agreed well with the values observed for CPDTBT-based BHJ photovoltaic cells (3.2–3.5% and 2.6 ± 0.2%).3d,24,25 The same devices have shown much higher PCEs of 5.5–6.0% after morphology control using 1,8-octanedithiol additives5j or a fabrication of P3HT/CPDTBT tandem cells,26 and thus we expect that the PCE of P7 could be improved a great deal with morphology control using additives or with fabrication of tandem devices.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of copolymers P1–P8 and PBTH were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammograms of P1–P8 are shown in Fig. S19.† The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) of the copolymers were determined from the following relationships:27EHOMO = −Eox − 4.72 and ELUMO = −Ered − 4.72 (in eV), where Eox and Ered are the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, of the polymers vs. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as a reference electrode. The derived EHOMO, ELUMO, and electrochemical bandgap (Eecg = ELUMO − EHOMO) of each copolymer are summarized in Table 2. The estimated Eecg values were somewhat higher than the optical bandgaps (Eopg) estimated in thin films, probably owing to an interface barrier present between the polymer film and the electrode surface.28
We again noted that not only changing the position of the hexyl side chains on HT but also incorporating additional donor or acceptor moieties in the polymer backbone exerted marked effects on the electrochemical behavior. As observed in the optical measurements, the estimated Eecg values for all copolymers P1–P8 (1.43–1.78 eV) were lower than that of PBTHT (2.29 eV), confirming the importance of incorporating proper additional donor or acceptor units in HT–BT–HT-based copolymers to achieve a narrow bandgap. As discussed in the previous section, the large Eecg of PBTHT was due to the energy level (−5.66 eV) of its rather localized (on HT) HOMO, which lay lower than the rather extended (over the HT–Z–HT unit) HOMO of the polymers P1–P8 (−4.82 to −5.19 eV). Its LUMO energy level (−3.4 eV) was retained at essentially the same level as other polymers (−3.31 to −3.56 eV). The LUMO is mostly localized in the common acceptor unit (BT) of all copolymers, and therefore most copolymers show similar LUMO levels and similar reduction potentials. The lowest-lying LUMO level (−3.56 eV) was found on P7 incorporated with the rather electron-deficient acceptor TP. As discussed also in the previous section, a favorable mixing between the well-matched LUMO levels of TP and BT, both of which are present in a planar polymer backbone, seemed to produce the low LUMO level. On the other hand, incorporated with one or two electron-rich EDOT units, the polymers P1, P2, P5, and P6 showed relatively higher HOMO levels (−5.09, −5.06, −4.93, and −4.82 eV). It was interesting to note that increasing the number of EDOT units in a repeating unit (P1 to P2 or P5 to P6) had only negligible influence on the HOMO levels.
A marked effect on the HOMO levels was induced by changing the positions of the hexyl side group of HT (P1 to P5 or P2 to P6). More generally, the HOMO level was higher for the supposedly more planar polymers incorporated with comonomers 3 or 4 [P5 (−4.93), P6 (−4.82), P7 (−5.06), and P8 (−4.96); in eV] than the more twisted polymers originating from comonomers 1 or 2 [P1 (−5.09), P2 (−5.06), P3 (−5.11), and P4 (−5.19); in eV]. Thus, the former class of polymers with the extended π-conjugation showed lower Eecg values (1.48–1.52 eV) than the latter (1.65–1.78 eV). A similar effect has been observed in several previous studies.6c,22,29 The HOMO levels estimated for the copolymers P1–P8 (−4.82 to −5.19 eV; −5.06 eV for P7) were mostly higher than the air oxidation threshold (ca. −5.27 eV),30 indicating good stabilities of these polymers toward air and oxygen, which is a prerequisite for device applications. On the other hand, the estimated LUMO levels of P1–P8 (−3.31 to −3.56 eV; −3.56 eV for P7) were higher than that of PCBM (−4.3 eV),5e allowing a favorable photo-induced electron transfer to PCBM.31 Therefore, these copolymers, especially P7, should be promising candidates for donor polymers used in the active layers of PCBM-based BHJ organic photovoltaic devices.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the copolymers P1–P8, BHJ photovoltaic cells were investigated in the following configuration: ITO-coated glass/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al, where the copolymers were used as a donor and PC60BM as an acceptor in the active layer, respectively.32 It is well known that the solvents used for the preparation of the active layer have a strong impact on the performance of the cell.33 In this work, chlorobenzene was chosen as a solvent in order to obtain blending films of the synthesized copolymer:PC60BM with good quality. The devices were characterized under a simulated 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter, simultaneously recording their current–voltage characteristics with a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter. The photovoltaic parameters for the P1–P8 devices are compared in Fig. 6 and the specific properties are summarized in Table 3.

Typically, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of an organic photovoltaic cell is governed by the energetic relationship between donor copolymer and PCBM acceptor. Specifically, the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor copolymer and the LUMO level of the PCBM acceptor (∼4.3 eV) is closely related to the Voc value of the resulting polymer solar cells.5c,34 The LUMO levels of the copolymers P1–P8 (varying from −3.31 to −3.56 eV; see Table 2) ensured a downhill driving force for charge separation to PC60BM or PC70BM (Fig. 7). The LUMO–LUMO offset (0.7–1.0 eV) was much larger than the 0.3–0.5 eV necessary for the electron transfer to occur.35 In our case, narrowing of the bandgap by raising the HOMO levels of the copolymers resulted in a low Voc of the copolymers.33 Each of these devices exhibits a relatively low Voc, with none surpassing 0.41 V. As reported the differences in Voc observed on changing preparation conditions, such as stoichiometry alterations and annealing, are interpreted as being mainly cause by the spectral shifts of the charge-transfer bands on changing the preparation conditions.36 So, further improvements to the photovoltaic performances by optimizing morphological properties through introducing additives or fabrication improvements are in progress.
 Fig. 7  Schematic energy band diagram of copolymers P1–P8 on the basis of electrochemical measurements. 
High short-circuit current (Isc) values were observed for all the synthesized copolymers P1–P8 (varying from 0.341 to 0.908 mA) because they exhibited better photon absorption properties in the wide range wavelength, which is beneficial for high short-circuit current density (Jsc). The high Jsc values of the synthesized copolymers underlined a significant potential in organic solar cell applications, especially for P7 (Eopg; 1.24 eV). Copolymer P7 could absorb significantly more light (λonset = 1003 nm) than the other copolymers, which likely led to its superior Isc of 0.908 mA. Meanwhile, its moderate fill factor (FF), approaching 51.88%, led to the best performance (PCE; 3.32%).
For copolymer P1–P8 based devices, the optimum thickness of active layer was found in the range of 84.2–140.9 nm. BHJ solar cells of P1 showed a PCE of 1.55% using an active layer with a thickness of ca. 140.9 nm. However, P1 showed low FF compared to the other thin film devices. Shifting hexyl chains to the inner core of BT introduced steric hindrance between the aromatic unit and the hexyl chains on the conjugated backbone, leading to increased bandgaps for P1–P4. The aforementioned results suggested that the current density of the copolymers could be influenced from the optical properties and the nature of the intermolecular structure. It is worth mentioning that this performance was achieved by simply fabricated devices without additives or extra layers, which facilitate the preparation of low cost polymer solar cells, and further improvements are in progress.
In BHJ solar cells, the surface morphology of the active layer is very important to their photovoltaic performance.33,37,38 To gain insight into the morphology of the active layer, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface of the film from a blend of the copolymers:PC60BM with a 1:1 ratio dissolved in chlorobenzene. The surface topographies were taken for each film and are shown in Fig. 8. The surface roughnesses of copolymers P1–P8 were found to be 0.21, 0.83, 0.90, 0.88, 0.29, 0.31, 0.28 and 0.12 nm in root-mean-square (rms) roughness, respectively. Different morphologies were observed for the blending thin films obtained from those synthesized copolymers and this suggested that the interactions between the molecules of each polymer might be different. Uniform grain-aggregation was observed in the P3 and P4 heterojunction films with roughnesses of 0.90 and 0.88 nm, respectively, which may lead to a phase separation, possible to decrease the charge carrier mobility and to increase the charge recombination. This observation was found to be consistent with the relatively low short-circuit current obtained from cells of P3 and/or P4 with PC60BM (7.35 and 9.27 mA cm−2, respectively) when compared to the other copolymers (Table 3).
 Fig. 8  AFM topography images (5 × 5 μm2) and their rms roughness values in nm level of the active films fabricated from copolymers (P1–P8):PC60BM in 1:1 ratio. 
Among the copolymers, P7: and P8:PC60BM blend films showed a smooth surface having rms roughnesses of 0.28 and 0.12 nm, respectively, and no obvious phase separation was observed. Because P7: and P8:PC60BM molecules showed good miscibility, increased interfacial area was expected. As a result, their Jsc increased to 19.57 and 18.99 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 3). The smoother surface for the other copolymers indicated good miscibility between the copolymers and PC60BM without large phase separation, resulting in increased Jsc and FF.
Conclusions
A series of donor–acceptor π-conjugated copolymers incorporating HT–BT–HT comonomers along with additional donor or acceptor units including EDOT, bis-EDOT, TP, and 2,3-dimethyl-TP were synthesized via the commonly used Pd-mediated Stille cross-coupling method. Moreover, a facile synthetic method was developed for the synthesis of several π-conjugated copolymers via direct C–H arylation of EDOT, bis-EDOT and 2,3-dimethyl-TP derivatives using commercially available Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst under Heck-type experimental conditions. The simplicity and usefulness of this method was demonstrated. A proper combination of donor and acceptor units was found to be critically important to achieve desirable characteristics for the copolymers. When the hexyl side chains of comonomer HT–BT–HT were positioned adjacent to BT, less steric hindrance and in turn a more planar backbone structure enhanced the π-conjugation and interchain interactions. Among the additional donors incorporated with HT–BT–HT, the TP units extended the absorption of the resulting thin-film copolymers beyond 1000 nm wavelength, leading to the lowest energy bandgaps. The trends in the obtained results were explained successfully with quantum mechanical calculations on the model copolymers. Further work is now in progress to further investigate the synthesized copolymers as well as to improve the photovoltaic performances with optimizing morphological properties through introducing additives or fabrication of tandem devices.

 	Fig. 4  (Top panel) Molecular orbital (MO) diagrams from the DFT/TDDFT calculations on the model fragments shown in Fig. 2, which represent the alternating copolymers of the HT–BT–HT and the additional donor EDOT (in P1 and P5) and acceptor TP (in P3 and P7). The energy levels of the occupied and unoccupied MOs are denoted by the black and red horizontal lines, respectively. The positive and negative phases of each orbital are represented by the green and pink lobes, respectively. The lowest and next lowest energy electronic transitions are denoted together by the solid and dashed arrows, respectively. The thickness of the arrow is a crude representation of the oscillator strength of each transition. (Bottom panel) The absorption spectra are constructed from the TDDFT singlet–singlet electronic transitions (blue solid bars and curves), whose peak positions and heights are from the calculated transition energies and oscillator strengths. The calculated transition wavelengths are in good agreement with the peak maximum positions of the experimental UV-vis absorption spectra (thin solid curves).	 

 	Fig. 5  HOMO/LUMO energy diagrams of the Z units (TP, EDOT, and BT) in the HT–Z–HT–BT copolymers. The energy levels of the occupied and unoccupied MOs are denoted by the black and red horizontal lines, respectively. The positive and negative phases of each orbital are represented by the blue and red lobes, respectively.
