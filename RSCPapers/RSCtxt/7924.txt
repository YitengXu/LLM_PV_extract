    , Accepted 19th January 2005First published on 23rd February 2005AbstractA series of new benzothiazolium hemicyanine dyes (HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, and HC-5 in Scheme 1) were designed and synthesized for sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes by introducing carboxyl, hydroxyl, or sulfonate anchoring groups onto the dyes' skeletons. A naphthothiazolium hemicyanine with both sulfonate and hydroxyl (HC-6) was also prepared for comparison. The photophysical and photoelectrochemical studies revealed that three kinds of efficiencies, i.e. the fluorescence quenching efficiencies of the dyes by colloidal TiO2, the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes, and the overall photoelectric conversion efficiencies (η) for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on these hemicyanines, all depended strongly on the anchoring group types and decreased in the order: carboxyl + hydroxyl > carboxyl > sulfonate + hydroxyl, indicating the importance of the dyes' adsorbing groups for their sensitization effects in DSSCs. The combination of carboxyl and hydroxyl as anchoring groups led to highly efficient IPCEs over a wide spectrum region with the maximum IPCE of 73.6% and a η of 5.2% under AM1.5 Global simulated light (80 mW cm−2) for the HC-1 based DSSC, which may result from the complex formation between HC-1 and TiO2 and the cathodic shift of the excited state oxidation potential.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have been actively investigated since Grätzel and coworkers reported highly efficient photoelectric conversion efficiencies of up to 10%.1–6 Compared with Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, organic dyes not only exhibit higher molar extinction coefficients, but also can be prepared and purified in easier procedures at lower cost, and therefore are attracting more and more interest. Recently great progress has been made in this field and the highest overall photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells sensitized by organic dyes has reached 8%,7 comparable with the performances of Ru(II) polypyridyl complex-based DSSCs. Lots of organic dyes such as cyanine dyes,8,9 perylene dyes,10,11 merocyanine dyes,12–14 coumarin dyes15–17 and hemicyanine dyes18,19 have been investigated in such applications. Among them hemicyanine dyes, a group of interesting photosensitizers, with electron donor and electron acceptor linked by a π-conjugation bridge (D–π–A) can effectively produce a charge-separation excited state upon photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer, from which a high quantum yield of electron injection into the conduction band of wide band-gap semiconductor is expected as in the case of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes where metal-to-ligand charge transfer states (MLCT states) serve as the sources of the injected electrons.2 Huang et al.20 synthesized three hemicyanine dyes with β-naphthothiazolium propylsulfonate as electron acceptor, N,N-dialkylaniline as electron donor and a double bond as π bridge, studied their photosensitization abilities in DSSCs, and found the introduction of a hydroxyl group onto the aniline improved the electron injection efficiency. It has been well recognized that the electron injection efficiencies of dyes upon nanocrystalline wide band-gap semiconductors depend not only on their respective intrinsic properties such as energy levels and excited state lifetimes, but also on the manner in which they are connected, such as physically or chemically adsorbed, the nature of anchoring groups, and the distance of the dye skeleton from the nanocrystalline surface. In relation to these factors, it is expected that the electron injection efficiencies of such hemicyanine dyes may be improved further by rational structure design, because (1) sulfonate (–SO3−) is a weaker adsorbing group on TiO2 than carboxyl (–COOH)21 and (2) the tethering group of the carbon chain (–CH2CH2CH2–) can be shortened further to ensure closer contact between dye and TiO2. Therefore, to better understand the effects of the anchoring groups on the photoelectrochemical performance of hemicyanine dyes in DSSCs, five new benzothiazolium based hemicyanine dyes (HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4 and HC-5, see Scheme 1) were designed and synthesized and detailed studies of their photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties have been undertaken compared with a reference compound (HC-6) which was the best photosensitizer among those reported by Huang et al.20 As expected, the substitution of carboxyl for sulfonate enhanced the photosensitization capabilities of these hemicyanine dyes remarkably. Moreover, we found the introduction of a hydroxyl group on the C2 position of the aniline moiety (HC-1 and HC-3) led to the formation of a complex between the corresponding hemicyanine dye and nanocrystalline TiO2, which may play a key role in the further improvement of the electron injection efficiency.

2 Experimental
2.1 General procedures for the synthesis of hemicyanine dyes
Hemicyanine dyes (HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, HC-5 and HC-6) were synthesized according to the procedures illustrated in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  The synthetic procedures of the hemicyanine dyes. 

2.1.1 Preparation of the benzothiazolium and naphthothiazolium intermediates (3)20,22. 
10 mmol thiazole compound (1) and 10 mmol compound (2) were refluxed overnight in 50 ml benzene. The solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. Column chromatography on silica gel with chloroform as eluent yielded 60–80% of pure thiazolium salts (3a), (3b), (3c) and (3d).


2.1.2 Preparation of the target hemicyanine dyes20,23. 
1 mmol of (3) and 1 mmol of benzaldehyde compound (4) were added into 25 ml anhydrous ethanol and refluxed for a whole day in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine. When cooled to room temperature, the resulting precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from ethanol to afford pure hemicyanine dyes in the yield of 70–90%: 2-(2-hydroxyl-4-N,N-diethylaminophenylethenyl)-benzothiazolium-1-acetate (HC-1), 2-(4-N,N-diethyl aminophenylethenyl)-benzothiazolium-1-acetate (HC-2), 2-(2-hydroxyl-4-N,N-diethylaminophenylethenyl)-benzothiazolium-1-propionate (HC-3), 2-(4-N,N-diethylaminophenylethenyl)-benzothiazolium-1-propionate (HC-4), 2-(2-hydroxyl-4-N,N-diethylaminophenylethenyl)-benzothiazolium-1-propylsulfonate (HC-5) and 2-(2-hydroxyl-4-N,N-diethylaminophenylethenyl)-β-naphthothiazolium-1-propylsulfonate (HC-6). The identity of the hemicyanine dyes was confirmed by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF (see ESI†).

2.2 Preparation of dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
The TiO2 paste (Nanoxide-T from Solaronix, Switzerland) was coated by means of the doctor blade technique on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (transmission >80%, sheet resistance 20 Ω cm−2), followed by sintering at 450 °C in air atmosphere for 30 min. The TiO2 electrode was soaked in 0.02 M TiCl4 stock solution overnight at room temperature and then washed with distilled water.2 Finally, it was fired again for 30 min at 450 °C. The thickness of the TiO2 film was 9 μm determined by a Dektak 3 Profilometer. The obtained TiO2 electrodes were dipped in a 0.3 mM hemicyanine dye solutions in CHCl3 for 8 h at room temperature and rinsed with CHCl3 and dried under a stream of hot air.
2.3 Photophysical measurements
Electronic absorption spectra of the hemicyanine dyes in MeOH solutions, colloidal TiO2 solutions and adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured using a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra of the hemicyanine dyes in MeOH solutions and TiO2 colloidal solutions were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The stock colloidal TiO2 solution (5 × 10−3 M) in acetonitrile was prepared by the hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide following the reported method,24 and diluted with acetonitrile to the desired concentrations.
2.4 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on a Potentiostat/Galvanostat model 283A (EG&G Princeton Applied Research) to determine the oxidation potentials of the hemicyanine dyes in DMSO solutions. A three-electrode cell was composed of a Pt working electrode, a Pt counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). Tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (0.01 M) served as supporting electrolyte. The scan rate was 200 mV s−1.
A sandwich-type solar cell was constructed by introducing the redox electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) in methoxypropionitrile between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a counter electrode of Pt-coated FTO conducting glass. The dye-sensitized TiO2 film was illuminated through the conducting glass support and the effective irradiated area was 0.175 cm2. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cell was taken from a computer-controlled digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) under illumination by AM1.5 Global simulated light (80 mW cm−2) from an Oriel 91192 Solar Simulator.
In the measurements of photocurrent action spectra, the solar cell was irradiated by monochromatic light, obtained from a 500 W Xe lamp in combination with a SpectraPro-150 monochromator (Acton Research Co.), in the range of 400–800 nm at 10 nm intervals, and the generated short-circuit photocurrents were recorded on a model 283A Potentiostat/Galvanostat. The incident monochromatic light intensity was measured with a S370 single-channel optometer equipped with a Model 262 flat response sensor head (Graseby Optronics).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Photophysical properties of the hemicyanine dyes in methanol solutions
Electronic absorption and fluorescence emission properties of the hemicyanine dyes in methanol are listed in Table 1. These hemicyanine dyes are composed of an electron donor aniline moiety and an electron acceptor benzothiazolium or naphthothiazolium moiety and are typical D–π–A chromophores, therefore their absorption bands in the visible region are of charge-transfer character and the absorption maxima will undergo a red shift upon increasing the electron donating or withdrawing abilities of the D or A moieties. So the red shift of the absorption maxima for HC-1 and HC-3 with respect to HC-2 and HC-4 respectively can be attributed to the enhanced electron donating property of the aniline moiety upon introduction of a hydroxyl group at the C2 position. When comparisons are made between HC-1, HC-3 and HC-5, or HC-2 and HC-4, it appears that the absorption maxima move to longer wavelengths with increasing carbon number of the alkyl chain between the terminal carboxyl or sulfonate group and the benzothiazolium part. The absorption bathochromic shift of HC-6 relative to HC-5 implies naphthothiazolium is a stronger electron acceptor than benzothiazolium, partly due to its larger π system which can accommodate more charge density. All six hemicyanine dyes exhibit large molar extinction coefficients at their absorption maxima, ranging from 5.41 × 104 to 7.92 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and being about four-to-six times larger than those of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes (1.40 × 104 M−1 cm−1),2 which favors light harvesting in DSSCs.

While hydroxyl red shifts the absorption maxima, its introduction gave rise to blue shifts of the fluorescence emission maxima of the hemicyanines (HC-1vs.HC-2 and HC-3vs.HC-4). As an electron donating group, hydroxyl can promote ground state charge transfer from the aniline to the benzothiazolium moiety, as a result making the ground state more similar in charge population to the charge transfer excited state, which will lead to a diminished Stokes shift, and therefore a blue shift is reflected in the fluorescence emission maximum. Besides, the introduction of hydroxyl favors the radiative decay of the corresponding hemicyanine excited state (Table 1); this phenomenon was also observed by Huang.20
3.2 Photophysical properties of the hemicyanine dyes adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 films

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of the hemicyanine dyes in methanol solutions and adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 films of 3 μm thickness (the absorption spectra of HC-3 and HC-4 are very similar to those of HC-1 and HC-2, respectively, and are not shown in Fig. 1). Compared with their absorption in methanol solutions, it is clear that the absorption bands for these dyes are all broadened significantly on both wings upon adsorption on TiO2, and the absorption maxima blue shift remarkably (30–60 nm, Table 1), suggesting the formation of H-aggregates on the TiO2 surface. For TiO2 films of 9 μm thickness, more dye molecules were adsorbed, and wide absorption bands with high absorbance over the region of 450–650 nm were observed, implying both H and J aggregates may have formed and the aggregation extent for each kind of aggregate increased in such cases.14 The formation of aggregates broadens the absorption spectra and favors light harvesting.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of the hemicyanine dyes in MeOH solutions (a) and adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 films of 3 μm thickness (b). 
Besides the absorbance and the overlap of the absorption with the solar spectrum, the light harvesting efficiency of a photosensitizer in DSSCs depends also on its adsorbed amount on the nanocrystalline semiconductor electrode. To determine the exact amounts of the hemicyanine dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films, dye-coated films (9 μm) were soaked in methanol to desorb the dye.2 It was found that HC-5 and HC-6 were prone to be desorbed completely in neat methanol during several minutes, while the desorption processes of the other hemicyanine dyes took about 1 h in the presence of alkali, indicating carboxyl is much superior to sulfonate in anchoring the dyes on the TiO2 surface. By measuring the absorption spectra of the desorption solutions, the numbers of adsorbed dye molecules per square centimetre of TiO2 film were calculated and collected in Table 1. Due to the weaker adsorbing ability of sulfonate than carboxyl and the larger molecular size of the naphthothiazolium moiety than the benzothiazolium moiety, HC-6 and HC-5 adsorbed on TiO2 in the first and second smallest amounts, respectively. The adsorbed amounts of HC-1 and HC-3 decreased by 7% and 16% with respect to HC-2 and HC-4, respectively, owing to the presence of a hydroxyl in the aniline moiety, which might be the result of the participation of the hydroxyl in adsorption. Once the hydroxyl attaches on to the TiO2 surface as an ancillary anchor, the contact area of HC-1 or HC-3 with the surface will increase, and some adsorbing sites will be occupied by hydroxyl or be shielded by the dye's skeleton, accordingly, the adsorbed amount decreases. The interaction of the hydroxyl with TiO2 was confirmed further by the absorption and emission spectra of HC-1 and HC-3 in colloidal TiO2 solutions (see below). Moreover, the increased flexibility of the alkyl spacer between the terminal carboxyl and the benzothiazolium part seems to facilitate dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface (HC-1vs.HC-3 and HC-2vs.HC-4), probably because the dye molecules may adjust their mutual orientation more easily in such cases.
3.3 Photophysical properties of the hemicyanine dyes in colloidal TiO2 solutions
To disclose the interaction nature of the hemicyanine dyes with nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes, the absorption spectra of these dyes in acetonitrile were measured in the presence of increased concentrations of colloidal TiO2 and are shown in Fig. 2 (the spectra of HC-3, HC-4 and HC-5 were omitted due to their similarities to those of HC-1, HC-2 and HC-6, respectively).
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the hemicyanine dyes in acetonitrile (5 × 10−6 M) at varied TiO2 colloid concentrations: a. 0, b. 0.5 × 10−5, c. 1.5 × 10−5, d. 2.5 × 10−5, e. 3.5 × 10−5, f. 4.5 × 10−5 M. 
Upon increasing the concentrations of colloidal TiO2 the absorption spectra of HC-2, HC-4, HC-5, and HC-6 were all broadened, and the broadening extents of HC-2 and HC-4 are much greater than HC-5 and HC-6, suggesting again that the carboxyl favors the interaction of these dyes with TiO2 particles due to its stronger adsorbing capability than the sulfonate. The absorption maxima changed marginally for HC-2, HC-4, HC-5, and HC-6, indicative of no formation of any new species such as dye aggregates or complexes between the dye and TiO2 under the experimental conditions. The significant absorbance increase below 450 nm and above 600 nm can be attributed to the scattering effect induced by TiO2 particles. However, along with the broadening of the absorption band upon addition of TiO2, the spectra of HC-1 and HC-3 underwent a remarkable red shift and an isosbestic point was observed. This suggests that a new species formed and the hydroxyl must be involved in its formation. This new species is not likely to be a dye aggregate because the presence of the hydroxyl decreases the dye adsorption amount on TiO2
					(see Table 1) and therefore disfavors aggregate formation between dye molecules. A possible explanation is that the combination of the carboxyl and the hydroxyl leads to a complexation reaction of the corresponding dye molecule with Ti4+ ion, which induced the observation of the red shift and the isosbestic point. It was reported that a triphenylmethane dye with hydroxyl–carboxylic (salicylate type) groups adsorbed on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film by a complexation reaction with Ti4+, and an ultrafast and efficient electron injection was observed from this complex.25 So, it is expected HC-1 and HC-3 may exhibit high electron injection efficiency due to an enhanced electronic coupling within the complexation interaction,26 which was supported by fluorescence emission measurements in TiO2 colloid solutions and photoelectrochemical studies in DSSCs.
The addition of TiO2 colloid into the acetonitrile solutions of the hemicyanine dyes resulted in the fluorescence quenching (see Fig. 3b as an example). Fig. 3a shows the fluorescence quenching efficiencies of the hemicyanine dyes by TiO2 colloid. It is obvious that the quenching efficiencies depended greatly on the anchoring types of the dye molecules, and decreased in the order: carboxyl + hydroxyl > carboxyl > sulfonate + hydroxyl. The fluorescence quenching can be attributed to electron injection from the excited hemicyanine dyes to the TiO2 conduction band. The complexation interaction mentioned above for HC-1 and HC-3 may contribute to their highly efficient fluorescence quenching behavior. It is interesting that the fluorescence quenching of HC-1 and HC-2 is less efficient than that of HC-3 and HC-4, respectively, implying the substituents on the N atom of benzothiazolium for HC-3 and HC-4 may adopt a bending rather than an extended conformation so that their chromophore skeletons approach the TiO2 surface closer than HC-1 and HC-2, leading to more efficient electron injection.

						(5 × 10−6 M) in acetonitrile in the presence of TiO2 with concentrations of: a. 0, b. 0.5 × 10−5, c. 1.5 × 10−5, d. 2.5 × 10−5, e. 3.5 × 10−5, f. 4.5 × 10−5 M. 
3.4 Energetic consideration for electron injection of the hemicyanine dyes into TiO2 electrodes
The excited state oxidation potentials (Eox*) of the hemicyanine dyes can be estimated by subtracting the 0–0 transition energies (E0–0) from the oxidation potentials (Eox), and E0–0 can be deduced from the wavelength where the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra cross each other.2 As shown in Table 2, the excited state energy levels for the hemicyanine dyes are in the range of −1.24 to −1.61 V (vs. SCE), far more negative than the band edge energy of the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode (−0.8 V vs. SCE), indicating that the electron injection processes from the excited dyes to TiO2 conduction bands are energetically permitted. Though the dyes' oxidation potentials may change upon adsorption to the TiO2 surface, the fluorescence emission quenching by TiO2 colloid confirms that the electron injection occurred from the excited states of the hemicyanine dyes.

3.5 Photoelectrochemical performances of the hemicyanine dyes in DSSCs
Photocurrent action spectra for the dye-coated TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 4, where the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) are plotted as a function of wavelength. The IPCE, defined as the number of photogenerated electrons flowing through the external circuit divided by the number of monochromatic incident photons, is represented by the following equation:2  where Isc is the short-circuit photocurrent generated by monochromatic light and λ and Pin are the wavelength and the intensity of the monochromatic light, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Photocurrent action spectra for DSSCs based on the hemicyanine dyes. The electrolyte was a solution of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) in methoxypropionitrile. 
The IPCEs are strongly dependant on the anchoring types of the dyes and decreased in the order: carboxyl + hydroxyl > carboxyl > sulfonate + hydroxyl. The lowest IPCEs for HC-5 and HC-6 indicate sulfonate, as attaching group, is much inferior to carboxyl in dye sensitization upon nanocrystalline TiO2. More importantly, the introduction of the hydroxyl improved the IPCEs greatly (HC-1vs.HC-2 and HC-3vs.HC-4). The IPCE at any wavelength is the production of three efficiencies, i.e. the light harvesting efficiency, the electron injection efficiency, and the electron collection efficiency.2 Due to the high absorbance (>1.0) over the region of 450–650 nm for the hemicyanine dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes, the light harvesting efficiencies for them all exceeded 90% and could not account for the significant IPCE enhancement by introduction of the hydroxyl. The electron collection efficiency is associated with (1) the electron transport within the TiO2 network, (2) the dark current arising from the injected electrons to the electrolyte (I3−), and (3) the recombination between the injected electrons with the dye cations. The former two terms should be the same for these DSSCs because the same electrodes and electrolytes were used. The introduction of the hydroxyl shifts the oxidation potentials of the dyes cathodically (Table 2) and should promote electron recombination and restrict dye cation reduction by electrolyte (I−)
					(because the electron recombination in DSSCs generally fell in the Marcus inverted region while the dye cation reduction by electrolyte fell in the Marcus normal region), and therefore should have decreased rather than increased the IPCEs if the electron collection efficiency was the decisive factor. So, the improved IPCEs upon the introduction of the hydroxyl can only be ascribed to the improved electron injection efficiency, in good agreement with the fluorescence quenching behaviors of these dyes by TiO2 colloid.
The improved electron injection efficiencies probably result from the two changes brought about by the introduced hydroxyl group. The combination of carboxyl and hydroxyl led to the complexation of the corresponding dyes with TiO2 as mentioned above, and the enhanced electronic coupling within the formed complex promoted the electron injection.26 Also, the introduced hydroxyl led to the cathodic shift of the excited state oxidation potential (Table 2), and the enlarged driving force promoted the electron injection. Though HC-5 and HC-6 possess the hydroxyl group also, the lack of complexation between them and TiO2 and their less negative excited state oxidation potentials may be the reasons for their low IPCEs, supporting the above explanations on how the hydroxyl improves the IPCEs.
Though the fluorescence of HC-3 was quenched more efficiently by colloidal TiO2 than that of HC-1, HC-1 exhibited higher IPCEs than HC-3
					(similar behavior for HC-2 and HC-4), which probably resulted from the dye aggregation upon adsorption onto the TiO2 electrodes.
The cooperation of carboxyl and hydroxyl led to high IPCEs (>60%) over a wide spectrum region with maximum IPCEs of 73.6% and 64.2% for HC-1 and HC-3, respectively. The functions of carboxyl + hydroxyl in improving the photoelectrochemical properties of HC-1 and HC-3 were further confirmed by the photovoltaic data of the DSSCs based on them.

Table 3 shows the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs based on the hemicyanine dyes. The overall photoelectrical conversion efficiency, η, is calculated by the following equation:η
						=
						(JscVocf)/Pinwhere Pin is the intensity of the incident light, Jsc the short-circuit photocurrent density, Voc the open-circuit photovoltage, and f the fill factor which is the ratio of the maximum output power of the cell with Pin.2 The η values depended on the anchoring types strongly and decreased in the order: carboxyl + hydroxyl > carboxyl > sulfonate + hydroxyl. HC-1 and HC-3 with both carboxyl and hydroxyl as anchoring groups exhibited much larger Jsc
					(13.9 mA cm−2 for HC-1 and 12.7 mA cm−2 for HC-3) than the other dyes, obviously benefited from their highly efficient IPCEs. From the overlap integral of the IPCE curves for HC-1 and HC-3 with AM1.5 Global solar spectrum (normalized to 80 mW cm−2), Jsc of 12.8 and 11.7 mA cm−2 can be estimated, in agreement with the experimental observations. Interestingly, HC-1 and HC-3 also showed enlarged Voc
					(520 mV for HC-1 and 499 mV for HC-3) than the other dyes, suggesting the cooperation of the carboxyl and the hydroxyl may restrict the dark current. In combination with the similar f
					(0.57 for HC-1 and 0.56 for HC-3) to the other dyes' f, HC-1 and HC-3 based solar cells yielded enhanced η
					(5.2% for HC-1 and 4.4% for HC-3) over the DSSCs sensitized by the other hemicyanine dyes. However, the obtained open-circuit photovoltages are lower than Ru(II) polypyridyl-based DSSCs, where open-circuit voltages higher than 0.6 V were generally achieved.1–6 The relatively low Voc was also observed in other organic dye sensitized solar cells, and probably originates from the dark current due to the reduction of both the oxidized dyes and I3− by the injected electrons.27 For Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, electron injection occurs from polypyridyl ligands, but recombination occurs at an Ru(III) center, which is located somewhat further away from the TiO2 surface than polypyridyl ligands, partly accounting for the fast electron injection and slow recombination kinetics.28 Organic photosensitizers having photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer properties such as the hemicyanine dyes shown in this work may mimic the electron injection and recombination kinetics provided the dye molecules are assembled on the TiO2 surface in such a way that the electron accepting moiety attaches directly onto TiO2, leaving the electron donating moiety away from the TiO2 surface. The validity of this idea is worthy of experimental investigation.

4 Conclusion
The benzothiazolium hemicyanine dyes with carboxyl as anchoring group (HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, and HC-4) exhibited improved IPCEs and overall photoelectric conversion efficiencies in the DSSCs than the benzo- or naphthothiazole hemicyanine dyes with sulfonate and hydroxyl as anchoring groups (HC-5 and HC-6). More importantly, the combination of the carboxyl and the hydroxyl in HC-1 and HC-3 improved the IPCEs further than HC-2 and HC-4, probably resulting from (1) the complex formation between HC-1 or HC-3 and TiO2, and (2) the cathodic shift of the excited state oxidation potentials for HC-1 and HC-3. Accordingly, a significantly enhanced overall photoelectrical efficiency of 5.2% was achieved in a DSSC based on HC-1. These results illustrate how significantly the anchoring manner of a dye molecule influences its sensitization behavior on a nanocrystalline semiconductor, and the optimization on adsorbing groups may result in more efficient dyestuffs for DSSC applications.
