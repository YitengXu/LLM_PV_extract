    , Accepted 22nd May 2018First published on 23rd May 2018AbstractCarbon-based materials have been widely applied as anode materials in commercial lithium ion batteries due to their low cost, excellent stability and relatively good energy storage capability. However, the maximum theoretical specific capacity of graphite is unsatisfactory (372 mA h g−1), which cannot meet the high-energy-density requirements for advanced electric vehicles. Porous carbon spheres (PCSs) are one of the most promising electrode materials for high-performance batteries because of their tunable porous structure and high compatibility with other materials. Specifically, PCSs can provide effective paths and space to transfer electrons/ions in electrodes, resulting in high-performance rechargeable batteries. The use of carbon spheres can also overcome the issues of unwanted side reactions to increase coulombic efficiency (CE) and bring potential for tuning the surface characteristics to attain high capacity. The porous carbon spheres with controllable structures are able to enhance the electrochemical performances of electrodes due to their multifunctional effects in different types of rechargeable batteries. This review focuses on tunable pore structure design, surface chemistry, composition, and electrochemical performances of PCSs in various types of rechargeable batteries. This paper aims to provide an overview for understanding the development of porous carbon spheres and strategies to overcome obstacles, such as low specific capacity, unsatisfactory CE, low tap density and inferior rate performance for their use in rechargeable batteries. Prospects and challenges for porous carbon spheres in rechargeable batteries are discussed to provide insight and inspiration for promoting the development of next-generation high-performance batteries.Huajun TianHuajun Tian is currently a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Australia.

1. Introduction
The greenhouse effect is widely regarded as one of the main causes of global climate change, which influences our daily life and is a serious issue affecting the survival of all living species.1 Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been well recognised to be responsible for global warming driven by the increased demand for fossil fuels in modern human history.2,3 Therefore, it is very important and urgent to adapt renewable energies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. For “green” alternative energy technologies, carbon-based materials have been widely used in clean energy storage and conversion systems, which can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and thus decrease the greenhouse gas emissions.4–7 In recent years, many strategies using carbon-based materials have demonstrated significant achievements for energy storage, including successful application of batteries for electric vehicles.8,9
It is well known that carbon-based materials are widely used as electrode materials in commercial rechargeable batteries due to their abundant resources, excellent electronic conductivity and chemical stability of carbon. In particular, graphite materials have been widely used as anode materials in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) since 1990. However, graphite-based LIBs usually have a limited energy density (120–240 W h kg−1), which hampers their application for electric vehicles.10 In order to overcome this obstacle, other high-capacity carbon-based cathode and anode materials such as porous carbon,11–13 Si/C,14–16 carbon/sulfur17,18 and carbon/iodine19–21etc., have been extensively investigated, which aims to attain the high energy density target (>400 W h kg−1).22 Nonetheless, there are still many challenges to completely overcome the shortcomings of carbonaceous anode materials such as low (initial) coulombic efficiency (CE), low tap density, poor rate performance and unsatisfactory cycling stability.
Compared with the other carbon-based materials, various kinds of porous carbon spheres (PCSs) have been extensively studied as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries owing to their tunable pore size distribution, high specific surface area, spherical morphology and unique surface chemistry.23–25 PCSs with hierarchical structures can be prepared via Stöber,26 templating,27 hydrothermal synthesis,28 polymerization29 and self-assembly methods,30etc. (see the summary in Table 1). These porous carbon spheres have been successfully designed and synthesised with sizes from nanometres to micrometres, which have different pore structures, ranging from micropores (<2 nm), mesopores (2–50 nm) to macropores (>50 nm) in order to satisfy the requirement for various rechargeable batteries.31–33 In recent years, PCSs have been successfully applied as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.34,35 For LIBs, PCSs can achieve high capacity through rational design and construction of the pore structure. However, compared with graphite, some inherent problems must be solved, including the side reactions of PCSs because of their pores and exposed edges, low initial CE, and cycle life. For Na+ ion batteries (NIBs), huge efforts have been devoted to increasing the sodium storage capability of PCS anode materials. One of the most successful applications of PCSs in batteries is that of carbon/sulfur nanoparticles for lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries.34,36,37 The tunable porosity of PCSs can afford high sulphur loading, physically confine sulphur and polysulfides, and suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, therefore leading to a high volumetric energy density of Li–S batteries. In metal–air batteries, the PCSs with controlled porosity and pore-size distribution can effectively facilitate electrolyte impregnation and oxygen diffusion to the inner parts of the electrode, resulting in high-performance metal/air batteries. Previously, several review papers have summarised chemical syntheses, properties and applications of carbon nanospheres,38 hollow carbon spheres,39 and nanoporous carbon spheres for LIBs.31 However, there are few reviews focusing on lithium/sodium ion storage mechanisms, micro/nano-structure design, composition, surface chemistry and electrochemical performances of PCSs applied in rechargeable batteries. Accordingly, in order to fully understand the development of PCSs, we comprehensively summarize Li+/Na+ ion storage mechanisms, existing issues, major achievements and emerging challenges in the development of PCS materials for rechargeable batteries. A summary of porous carbon spheres and their applications in rechargeable batteries is presented in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the development of PCSs for different types of rechargeable batteries, suggests great potential for PCSs to be applied as electrode materials in high-energy-density batteries.

 Fig. 1  Porous carbon spheres and their applications in rechargeable batteries with high energy density. 
In this review, we focus on recent progress and successful applications of PCSs in rechargeable batteries, which can be sub-divided as follows: (a) “beyond-graphite” carbon-based materials for high-performance rechargeable batteries; (b) multi-scale pores and structural design of PCSs, providing excellent electrochemical performances for rechargeable batteries; (c) promising PCSs/active material composites for high-capacity electrodes; (d) heteroatom doping chemistry for carbon-based materials/PCSs. Finally, we discuss several future prospects of porous carbon spheres as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.
2. Theoretical foundation of carbon-based anodes for rechargeable batteries
Generally, carbon materials can be classified as: (1) hydrogen containing carbons, (2) soft carbons exhibiting turbostratic disorder, (3) microporous hard carbons and (4) graphitic carbons.40 Graphite with a layered structure has been widely used in practical lithium ion batteries. However, graphite has a relatively low theoretical specific capacity of 372 mA h g−1 compared with other IV group elements (Si,41,42 Ge,43–46 Sn,47–51etc.). Basically, the theoretical capacity of graphite can be calculated through the charge/discharge reaction with Li ion intercalation as follows: Li+ + e− + C6 ⇌ LiC6(1)
The theoretical storage states of Li ions in carbon anodes for LIBs were studied using a semi-empirical Molecular Orbital (MO) method.52 The calculated results by semi-empirical MO method indicated that in order to obtain large reversible capacities of amorphous carbon anode materials, the distances between graphene sheets should be controlled in the range of 0.77–0.83 nm to allow double Li+ layer storage and prevent the formation of a triple Li+ layer (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, if the distances between successive graphene layers are under 0.70 nm, the intercalation of electrolyte molecules is prevented and extra irreversible capacity is gained. The micro/nano-structural design of anodes in LIBs is also vital to retain their stability in electrochemical performance for long-term cycling. In 2001, J. R. Dahn et al. systematically studied the interactions of lithium and sodium with a range of carbon materials in electrochemical cells.40 In this work, in situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies clearly indicated the insertion of lithium and sodium into nanopores within disordered hard carbons. This work confirmed that pores in nanoporous hard carbon were filled with sodium ions/atoms only as the reactions proceeded along the low voltage plateau. The in situ SAXS studies also demonstrated that lithium insertion into hard carbons and sodium insertion into soft carbons is relatively feasible (Fig. 2b and c). A typical potential profile for lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation in graphite is presented in Fig. 2d, which illustrates the distinct charge/discharge plateaus corresponding to reactions with compounds in stages 1–4.53 The surface structural disordering in graphite anodes will occur during lithium intercalation/deintercalation processes. This surface structural disorder is continuously inflicted on the graphitic crystallites of the anode upon prolonged charge/discharge cycling. Meanwhile, the exposed graphite edge sites can react with the electrolyte to (re)form the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which leads to gradual degradation of the graphite anode, and causes irreversible capacity loss in LIBs. A very striking effect on the specific capacity of carbon occurs as a function of heat treatment temperature and carbon type as shown in Fig. 2e.54 The typical graphite presents a reversible capacity of ∼355 mA h g−1. H0.4C can provide a reversible capacity of 900 mA h g−1, which is one of the highest capacities of any materials in region 2, as shown in Fig. 2e and f. The authors proposed that the reversible specific capacity of these region 3 materials increased with their single layer fraction (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, lithium ions can be adsorbed on both surfaces of these single sheets, leading to more lithium per carbon than in intercalated graphite. Tamon et al. demonstrated the theoretical calculation results, which suggested that a storage state with a double Li ion layer was formed and was preferable for achieving a higher capacity than the theoretical maximum capacity of graphitic carbon (372 mA h g−1) and to reduce hysteresis in the charge–discharge process.52 The high capacity could be explained on the basis of “cavity modes”, indicating that lithium species are not only intercalated between carbon layers but also doped into cavities in meso-carbon micro-beads.

Compared with the Li+ ion in LIBs, the Na+ ion has a larger radius than the Li+ ion, which affects the mass transport and storage in electrochemical processes. Graphite, the popular anode in LIBs, has unfortunately been proved to have a very limited reversible capability in the sodiation/desodiation process, and the electrochemical sodiation/desodiation capacity of graphite is <35 mA h g−1.55 The limited sodium storage capability is due to the interlayer distance of graphite (∼0.34 nm) being too small to accommodate the large Na+ ion. However, it has been demonstrated that the Na+ ion storage ability of natural graphite can be largely improved by using ether-based (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME), dimethoxyethane (DME) or tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)) electrolytes and provided a reversible capacity of ∼150 mA h g−1 with an average voltage of 0.6 V.56 The electrochemical performance illustrates that solvents with longer chain lengths form energetically more stable discharge products and can exhibit a higher Na+ ion storage potential. The unique effect of Na+–solvent co-intercalation combined with pseudocapacitive behaviors showed that the graphite has a chance to improve its Na+ ion storage capability via chemical modification. For another typical example, Wang's group used expanded graphite with an enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 4.3 Å as an anode in NIBs, which exhibited a high capacity of 284 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1 and long-term stability with a capacity of 136 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles.57 In addition, hollow carbon structures with heteroatom doping have also been proved efficient in improving the electrochemical sodiation behaviour of carbon in NIBs. Hard carbon with a large interlayer d-spacing was considered to be favorable for the storage of large Na+ ions.58 It has also been realized that sodium can be inserted into the interlayer space of disordered carbon materials.40 These results demonstrated that disordered carbon with a large interlayer distance could have superior Na+ ion storage capability.
Hard carbon (HC) materials have been considered as one of the most promising carbon-based anodes materials for SIBs due to their diverse microstructural states.59 In 2000, Stevens and Dahn proposed the so-called “house of cards” model (Fig. 3a) to describe the sodium storage behaviour in HCs. In this work, the sloping part of the galvanostatic curve (1–0.1 V, vs. Na+/Na) was ascribed to the Na+ intercalation inside the turbostratic graphene layers, and the low voltage plateau (0.1–0 V, vs. Na+/Na) was attributed to the insertion of Na+ into the nanocavities or nanopores.60 Some researchers found that the mechanisms for lithium and sodium insertion were similar and the whole process involved two distinct steps: (1) a sloping potential region extending to ∼0.2 V and (2) a low potential plateau (Fig. 3b).61 Meanwhile, it has been mentioned that the porosity, surface chemistry and defects of hard carbons are important factors affecting their electrochemical performance for SIBs. For instance, Ghimbeu et al. indicated that the carbon characteristics (oxygen surface groups, active surface area and microporosity) were reduced with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature as shown in Fig. 3c.62 Accordingly, the sloping capacity decreased almost linearly. Similarly, the high-temperature derived carbons (>1400 °C) presented no porosity which excludes the attribution of the plateau region to the adsorption of Na+ in the nanopores but rather the insertion between the pseudo-graphitic domains. Especially, the capacity in the slope region (Fig. 3d) gradually decreased with increasing carbonization temperature due to the decrease of interlayer spacing, which led to a higher energy barrier for the Na+ intercalation.63 It has been proved that heteroatom doping (N, S, B, F and P) in hard carbon structures can improve the sodium-ion storage properties due to modification in the microstructure of host carbon.64–66 After appropriate heteroatom doping, a reduction in the reaction and diffusion barriers will occur, and interlayer separations will increase. Fig. 3e shows the schematic illustrations of the expansion in the interlayer spacing of doped and undoped carbon systems, and differences in their Na storage mechanisms are presented.67 It is also proved that fluorine (F)-doped carbon can have enhanced electrochemical performances for SIBs due to the enlarged interlayer distance (0.41 nm) which can facilitate the diffusion of the large-size sodium ion.68 Recently, Xu et al. proposed the adsorption-pore-filling mechanism of sodium storage in HCs.69 In this work, Na+ ions were considered to adsorb on the HC surface at defect sites or heteroatoms in the high voltage sloping region and then fill the micro/nanopores in the low-voltage plateau region. This storage mechanism provides a supplemental fundamental understanding of HC anode materials for NIBs.

Overall, in order to maximize the stored energy per unit mass or volume in different types of batteries, it is undoubtedly necessary to design and modify carbon-based materials (i.e. graphite, PCSs, etc.) with distinctive properties, micro/nano-structures, reasonable porosity, surface chemical properties, etc. Certainly, further investigations on the theoretical foundations of carbon-based materials, such as PCSs, are demanded to fully understand and utilize abundant carbon-based materials in rechargeable batteries.
3. Tunable pore structure design of porous carbon spheres for rechargeable batteries
The characteristics of PCSs, such as the composition, morphology and porosity are particularly important for achieving high electrochemical performances. The porous structure of carbon spheres have been classified as micropores (<2 nm), mesopores (2–50 nm) and macropores (>50 nm). Full control of the tunable porosity of carbon spheres is needed to meet the demands of rechargeable batteries, including Li-ion and Na-ion batteries, Li–S batteries,17,26,70 Li–air batteries and Na–air batteries,71,72 lithium–iodine batteries,73 and zinc–air batteries.74 However, the possible disadvantages of porous carbon spheres with a high specific surface area could be summarized as follows: (1) the porous carbon sphere with a high specific surface area may consume more electrolytes to form a stable SEI. (2) The porous carbon sphere with a high electrolyte/electrode surface area may induce more side reactions with the electrolyte, which decreases the initial coulombic efficiency. The volumetric energy density of a porous carbon-based material is generally less than that of a high-tap density carbon material. In order to overcome these disadvantages of PCSs, the comprehensive and careful design of PCSs is required for different types of rechargeable batteries.
3.1 Mesoporous (2–50 nm) carbon spheres as electrode/host materials for rechargeable batteries
Mesoporous carbon spheres (MCSs) with high specific surface areas can be widely applied as electrode materials in LIBs,27,75 Li–S24,76 and Li–air batteries.71 Especially, ordered mesoporous carbon has become regarded as one of the most promising sulphur hosts due to its high surface area and well-defined porosity, which can provide fast electrolyte diffusion and accommodate a high sulfur loading of up to >80 wt% of composite cathode materials.
One of the earliest successful applications was using mesoporous carbon CMK-3 as a sulfur host, and mesoporous carbon with ordered one-dimensional channels effectively improved the electroactivity of sulfur and prevented the dissolution of polysulfides (shuttle effect) in Li–S batteries.18 In particular, MCSs with pores ranging from 2 nm to 50 nm in diameter provide multifunctional electron/ion transfer channels for enhancing the electrochemical performance of electrodes in Li–S batteries. In 2011, ordered mesoporous carbon spheres (OMCs) with uniform penetrating channels as shown in Fig. 4a and b were demonstrated as a conductive agent in Li–S batteries.77 The obvious improvement of the cycling stability (Fig. 4c) of the S-OMC composite could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the highly dispersed sulfur trapped in the nano-sized channels of the OMCs can successfully alleviate the volume change effects of the Li–S electrochemical reactions. Secondly, the large specific surface area that originate from the uniform mesoporous channels in the OMCs can restrict the diffusion of the polysulfides during the charge/discharge processes resulting in improving the coulombic efficiency of Li–S batteries. These outcomes are further corroborated by other reported results. Lu et al. reported interlinked core–shell carbon spheres through solution synthesis of a polymer precursor followed by pyrolysis and self-deposition in a hermetic silica shell.78 The uniform spherical morphology and pore structure of interlinked, hollow, core–shell carbon spheres (CSCs) were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM images (Fig. 4d, e and g, h) and nitrogen sorption measurements (Fig. 4f). The adsorption isotherm exhibits a step at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.14–0.32, indicating that the sample has a pore size of 2.14 nm. Typical discharge/charge voltage profiles of the CSC-S cathode with a sulfur loading of 70 wt% exhibited a high initial capacity of ∼1100 mA h g−1 (577.5 mA h gtotal electrode−1) at 0.5C (Fig. 4i) and the rate capability results of CSC-S exhibited a good rate performance (Fig. 4j). In this work, the stable rate performance and high CE of CSC-S electrodes illustrated that the mesoporous carbon shell played an important role in retarding polysulfide dissolution. In Li's report, the MCSs with meso-sized pores in the range of 3–30 nm and with controlled pore volume and a relatively high specific surface area were synthesized via a spray drying-assisted template method by combining with a separate carbonization process.24 The prepared MCSs were then used as the matrix for fabricating sulfur impregnated mesoporous carbon composite spheres (S-MCs) as cathodes in Li–S batteries. Importantly, the sulfur-impregnated MC composite spheres had a high sulfur loading content of up to 80 wt% of the total cathode mass and had a discharge capacity of 864 mA h g−1 for Li–S batteries with a sulfur loading of 60 wt% at 2C and maintained 857 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2C.

A hybrid micro-mesoporous graphitic carbon sphere (M-MGCS) for Li–S batteries was designed by using a dual-templating method with small sulfur molecules trapped on the outer shell to minimize the outward diffusion from the core.79 The experiment showed that the M-MGCS with 20 nm shell thickness exhibited an efficient restriction effect on outward diffusion of polysulfides with an initial discharge capacity of 1126 mA h g−1 (calculated based on the sulfur mass) and 80.6% capacity retention. Similarly, a research study conducted by Liang et al. demonstrated that mesoporous carbon spheres (OMCs) from a hard templating method can act as conductive agents and trap polysulfides inside the cathode material, which results in better cycling performance.77 When combined with sulfur, the S-OMCs had an initial discharge capacity of 1265.5 mA h g−1 and retained 800 mA h g−1 after 25 cycles at 0.1 mA cm−2 current density.
For LIBs, mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (N-MCHSs) were prepared by using mesoporous silica hollow spheres as hard templates and dopamine as a carbon source. Each sphere has a 40 nm thick sponge-like shell with “carbon bridges”.80 The fabricated particles can deliver a high discharge capacity of 485 mA h g−1 after 1100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 current density. Liu et al. reported that the mesoporous carbon spheres (MCSs) made by chemical vapor deposition technology,76 when compounded with nano-sized cobalt oxide for LIBs, showed a good discharge capacity of 703 mA h g−1 at 70 mA g−1 current density after 30 cycles. The improved performance was due to effective aggregation and volume change suppression of the cobalt nanoparticles as well as the large surface area of the carbon spheres for ion diffusion.
In addition, the MCSs can serve as nanoreactors and control the growth of active materials such as MoS2,81 Co3O4,82 and TiO283 in a core–shell arrangement. Chen et al. reported that SiO2@SiO2/resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) as a template was converted into SiO2@SiO2/C after calcination in N2.81 After NaOH treatment, hollow mesoporous carbon spheres were obtained, as shown in Fig. 5a. Active materials (MoS2) could successfully grow in the cavity of HMCSs (Fig. 5b–g). After 1000 cycles, the discharge capacity of the yolk–shell MoS2@C nanospheres for LIBs retained 962 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and exhibited a stable performance at higher current density (Fig. 5h and i). This method could be extensively used to synthesize transition-metal (Fe, Co, Ni or Cu) oxide (sulfide)@HMCSs. For instance, Xue et al. fabricated iron oxide nanoparticles (∼5 nm) embedded in mesoporous carbon (IONP@mC) spheres with an average size of ∼70 nm via a hydrothermal method with L-ascorbic acid used as the surfactant.84 With the addition of phenolic resol, spherical resol-F127 and resol-Fe3O4 monomicelles were formed though the hydrogen bond interaction between resol and F127/dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). After subsequent low-concentration hydrothermal treatment, spherical resol-F127 and resol-Fe3O4 monomicelles further assembled into a spherical resol composite, forming iron oxide nanoparticles encapsulated in polymeric composite F127/DHAA. Meanwhile, the reduction in the average size of these particles after carbonization could be attributed to the slight shrinkage of polymeric spheres after the removal of the F127 template and carbonization of the polymeric composite. In this work, a reversible capacity of 271.1 mA h g−1 could be obtained even at a current density of 10 A g−1, indicating its great potential for being utilized as an anode material in high rate LIB applications. Moreover, the MCSs had successful applications in supercapacitors. A special “in situ replicating” strategy was developed to fabricate double HMCSs using SnO2 hollow spheres as the sacrificial templates and a nitrogen-containing precursor as the carbon source.85 The authors indicated that the hollow cavity and inter-shell mesopores could act as “ion-buffering reservoirs” to minimize the diffusion distances of ions from the electrolyte into the hollow cavity and inter-shell mesopores as shown in Fig. 6.

3.2 Microporous (<2 nm) carbon spheres as electrode/host materials for rechargeable batteries
Compared with mesoporous carbon spheres, microporous carbon (MPC) spheres with pore sizes below 2 nm can effectively trap S2–4 molecules because of the space confinement effect, which can significantly improve the cycle life of Li–S batteries. It is well known that after sulfur is confined in micropores (Fig. 7a–c), a “quasi-solid-state” reaction can occur when Li+ ions migrate into the pores of such electrodes.86 The confined small S2–4 molecules in micropores prevent the unfavorable transition between S8 and S42− during discharge/charge processes and the charge/discharge profile only presents a single long plateau at ∼1.9 V (Fig. 7d), which confirms the “quasi-solid-state” reaction. Compared with the S/carbon black mixture, the confined S2–4 molecules in S/CNT@MPC exhibited a much improved cycling stability (Fig. 7e and f). A micrometer-sized spherical carbon with a macro-hollow core and a microporous shell derived from amylose was prepared by a multistep pyrolysis route without chemical etching.87 This structure is different from the meso-microporous core–shell carbon host S@C composites in which CMK-3 is used as the mesoporous core and an organic-derived microporous carbon is used as the shell. This macro-hollow core is intentionally not fully filled with sulphur by infiltration in order to provide extra space for accommodating the volume expansion of sulfur during the lithiation process and also facilitate the penetration of electrolyte into the S@C hybrid. As a lithium–sulfur cathode material with a sulfur loading of 48 wt%, it showed an excellent initial capacity of 1490 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a capacity of 798 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles and also low polarization during long-term cycling.

Double-shell pomegranate-like porous carbon microspheres (PCMs) were prepared by a co-precipitation process with an enhanced reversible capacity of 650 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1 current density for LIBs.88 The PCMs had a better cycling stability and rate performance than hollow carbon microspheres due to their outstanding electrochemical properties originating from numerous lithium ion storage sites inside the double-shelled structure. Zheng et al. developed hybrid micro–mesoporous graphitic carbon spheres (M-MGCSs) as sulfur reservoirs in Li–S batteries,79 hybridized with sulfur (S@M-MGCs) using a melt-diffusion method. These S@M-MGSs had an initial discharge capacity of 1126 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and a capacity retention of 80.6% after 100 cycles, which proved their improved cycling stability. In addition, microporous carbon spheres via a spray drying method were prepared, and their size could be controlled by adjusting the pH of the carbon precursor.89 The synthesis of different novel microporous carbon nanospheres via the Stöber method was reported by Choma et al.90 Hu et al. fabricated a group of microporous carbons using a simple and controllable one-step synthesis method91 and found that the microporous structure was a key factor in trapping sulfur molecules. Their sulfur hybrids can deliver a capacity of 968 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1C, leading to an outstanding battery performance.
A facile approach for creating nitrogen-doped microporous carbon spheres (N-MPCs) using a chemical activation method had been developed.92 They have combined selenium with this sphere structure and obtained Se/N-MPCS composites. The Se/N-MPCs delivered a high capacity of 570 mA h g−1 over 350 cycles at 0.5C in Li–Se batteries due to the complete electrochemical reaction of selenium. Jeong et al. embedded silicon nanoparticles inside micron-sized porous carbon spheres (Si-MCS) using a hydrothermal technique,93 The materials attained an outstanding capacity retention of 93.5% after 500 cycles at 0.8 A g−1 and a high specific capacity of 880 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1 current density.
However, the microporous carbon spheres, have some inherent disadvantages, i.e. limited sulphur loading (<50% wt%, normally) and a low discharge voltage plateau (∼1.85 V), which decreases their energy density in Li–S batteries. Therefore, a controllable design of hierarchical porous carbon spheres, which have all the advantages of microporous, mesoporous and macroporous carbon spheres, may be a good strategy for achieving high energy Li–S batteries and other similar rechargeable batteries.
3.3 Macroporous (>50 nm) carbon spheres as electrodes/host materials for rechargeable batteries
It is well known that the mesoporous/microporous carbon spheres with high-surface-areas have been proven for effectively encapsulating sulfur and improving the cycling stability of Li–S batteries. Nevertheless, the high carbon content and low packing density of mesoporous/microporous carbon may limit the achievable energy density of the cells. Therefore, low-surface-area carbon materials could be a practical approach for high-energy-density Li–S batteries.
A unique macroporous carbon structure with macropore walls and numbers of small hollow carbon spheres, which were used as a 3D ordered porous carbon, was synthesized by Woo et al.94 The macroporous carbon spheres were synthesized from bimodal polymer–silica colloidal crystals. By choosing different sizes of polymer and silica particles, the macropore size can be adjusted. For increasing the high-energy-density of Li–S batteries, interestingly, Liu et al. demonstrated a unique non-encapsulation approach for high-performance Li–S batteries using low-surface-area carbon (Fig. 8a and b).95 In this work, a low-surface-area carbon material was used as a sulfur host. Compared with the electrode encapsulating solid sulfur onto the carbon fibre (CF) surface by the melt-diffusion method (MD-Encap-S/CF) (Fig. 8c), the formation of ‘flowerlike’ large Li2S agglomerates within the conducting CF framework (Fig. 8d) was considered as the reason for the high specific capacity and small overpotential. The Non-Encap-S/CF electrode was prepared by depositing sulfur species onto the CF matrix from Li2S8 catholyte through an in situ electrochemical process. The excellent electrochemical performances of a Non-Encap-S/CF electrode as shown in Fig. 8e and f, can be ascribed to: (1) the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of large particles on the carbon surface reduce random precipitation, (2) a self-sustaining architecture to support the sulfur species was provided. (3) The dissolution kinetics could be significantly suppressed due to the large particle size, thus resulting in high mechanical stability of large agglomerates of sulfur species in the electrode during long-term charge/discharge. For the CF electrode, the carbon fibre surfaces were functionalized with O groups (CO, C–O and O–CO) via O2 plasma treatment in order to enhance the nucleation on the surface (Fig. 8g). In DOL:DME and tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) solvents with weaker Li+ solvation, the nucleation of Li2S particles increased consequently, but the diffusion of Li+ dominated the following growth of Li2S from the solution (Fig. 8h). This work presented a new method for designing high-energy and low-cost Li–S batteries by controlling sulfur reactions in low-surface-area carbon host materials.

3.4 Hierarchical porous carbon spheres as electrode/host materials for rechargeable batteries
Rechargeable Li–O2 and Na–O2 batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising next generation batteries because of their high theoretical capacity and energy density. Due to the unique operating mechanism of Li–O2 and Na–O2 batteries, cathodes with a hierarchical porous structure are desirable for O2 diffusion and accommodation of discharge products such as Li2O2 and NaO2. In a hierarchical carbon structure, ordered mesoporous channels can effectively enhance electrolyte immersion and facilitate Li+ or Na+ ion diffusion and electron transfer in the electrode. In particular, in a hierarchical structure, macropores can be surrounded by ordered mesoporous channels, which provide space for O2 diffusion and O2/Li2O2 or O2/NaO2 conversion (Fig. 9a).71

Recently, Sun et al. reported hierarchical porous carbon spheres with controlled porosity as electrodes for Na–O2 batteries.72 Macro-pores formed between PCSs with nano-pores inside each PCS enabled effective formation and decomposition of NaO2 by facilitating electrolyte impregnation and oxygen diffusion to the inner part of the oxygen electrode (Fig. 9b–e). Therefore, an aprotic Na–O2 battery with high capacity and high rate capability was successfully demonstrated due to the unique porous structure of the oxygen electrodes with macropores formed between PCSs and nanopores inside each PCS. In this work, it has been proved that the hierarchical porous structure of the PCS electrode is more beneficial to the diffusion of oxygen and electrolyte impregnation through the whole electrode and the discharge products are accommodated as well. It was found that the macropores are more difficult to be blocked by discharge products when compared with nanopores. Therefore, PCS electrodes could present more active sites for the growth of NaO2.
Graphitic N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (N-HCNs) were synthesized by a soft template sacrificial method and subsequent ammonia activation treatment.96 The N-HCNs with a hierarchical porous architecture provided a large specific surface area, abundant edge defects and high active N content, which leads to a superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity. They presented a higher power density in a zinc–air battery and a larger operating voltage than Pt/C at the same discharge current density. N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres with hierarchical pores were prepared by using a soft templating method.96 The spheres, when used in zinc–air batteries, had an ultra-high specific surface area with outstanding ORR electrocatalytic activity originating from their dual active pyridinic-N and graphitic-N contents.
An effective method for producing low oxygen content hierarchical porous carbon for LIBs was successfully developed,97 using polystyrene spheres as templates and the prepared materials delivered a first charge and discharge capacity of 716 and 277.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 18.6 mA g−1. The difference in charge and discharge characteristics is due to the large surface area of the hierarchical structure which needs a large amount of electrical charge for the first charge process only. Its low lithium insertion/de-insertion electrochemical impedance, when used as an anode material for LIBs, is excellent when compared with commercial natural graphite anodes. Li et al. developed a sustainable templating method using biomass to produce a hierarchically porous carbon matrix for Li–S batteries,98 and this matrix is a highly conductive hierarchically porous carbon including graphene. The obtained samples have a high areal and gravimetric sulfur content and the material showed outstanding electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 707 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles at 0.2C. Hierarchical porous carbon spheres were also reported by Tian et al. using a hard templating strategy.99 The synthesized hierarchical carbon spheres have large surface area, large porous channels and graphitized shells which significantly facilitate ion insertion–extraction kinetics. When applied as an electrode in LIBs, the electrode delivered initial charge and discharge capacities of 798 and 1213 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and could retain 506 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.
In addition, for other preparation methods, Xiong et al. developed carbon microspheres with ball-in-ball (yolk@void@shell) structure using a hydrothermal method for anode materials in NIBs.100 The ball-in-ball structure had a hierarchical structure in both shell and yolk layers, and the carbon microspheres have a large surface area of 1250.0 m2 g−1, and were capable of delivering a high specific capacity of 472.5 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. A rational design of Si@carbon with a robust hierarchically porous custard-apple-like structure (Si@mNOC) was prepared via a carbonization method.101 When used as an anode for LIBs, the material achieved a high capacity of 1203 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles and 900 mA h g−1 after 4000 cycles at a density of 2 A g−1, which indicated excellent long-term cycling performance. Shi et al. used MgAl-layered double oxide (LDO) microspheres as templates to fabricate hierarchical porous carbon microspheres (HPCMs).102 The results indicate that the hierarchical porous structure can provide fast ion transport channels for non-aqueous electrolyte access. It had a high initial discharge capacity and reversible capacity of 2443.2 and 1332 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, respectively. A hierarchical three-dimensional structure of carbon nanospheres hanging on carbon nanotubes (CNs/CNTs) was reported by Zhou et al.103 The CNs/CNTs were prepared via a simple chemical vapor deposition method with a controllable structure. It has a large specific surface area and hybrid nanostructure, and this combination exhibited good electrochemical performance with a high specific energy of 61.2 W h kg−1 and power density of 563.4 W kg−1 when used in supercapacitors. Furthermore, the CNs/CNTs' hierarchical network structure illustrated excellent cycling performance with 92.7% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Moreover, core–shell hierarchically porous carbon spheres (HPCs) were synthesized using a hydrothermal method as a host to integrate sulfur.104 Their HPC-S electrodes had a high initial discharge capacity of 1356 mA h g−1 at 335 mA g−1 and delivered a steady reversible charge capacity of 1397.9 mA h g−1 in Li–S batteries. The HPC-S exhibited a higher usage of sulfur due to sufficient contact with the electrolyte and conducting materials.
The hierarchical porous carbon spheres have demonstrated huge practical application potential in different types of rechargeable batteries due to their tunable hierarchical porous structure to satisfy the different demands of rechargeable batteries for increasing the capacity, (initial) CE and cycle life. However, further studies need to be done to fully understand the effect of the hierarchical porous structure on the electrochemical performance of batteries and build a quantitative relationship between the hierarchical microstructure (micro-, meso-, and macro-porous) and the performance of electrode/host materials in rechargeable batteries. The tunable porous carbon spheres enhance the long-term cycling stability of rechargeable batteries with high coulombic efficiency. For LIBs and NIBs, the porous PCS-based electrode materials coupled with a compatible electrolyte can render the formation of a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which enables to achieve high coulombic efficiency during charge/discharge cycling. For Li–S batteries, it is well known that the polysulfide shuttle effect can be effectively suppressed by porous (microporous, mesoporous, macroporous or hierarchical) structure design, leading to stable capacity retention during long-term cycling. For metal (Li, Na, and Zn)–air batteries, the hierarchical porous structure of the PCS-based electrodes can facilitate the diffusion of oxygen and electrolyte impregnation, empowering ultra-efficient electrode reactions. Furthermore. The PCS electrodes can deliver high rate performances through facile ion and electron conductions via well connected pore networks (see the summary in Tables 1 and 2).

4. Porous hollow carbon spheres (PHCSs) as electrode/host materials for rechargeable batteries
The successful applications of hollow porous carbon spheres (PHCSs) in batteries are mainly due to their unique characteristics, such as the controllable particle size, hollow structure, surface properties, and compatibility with other high-capacity electrode materials. Normally, the main strategies for preparing PHCSs include two methods: hard-templating and soft templating approaches, which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2
Maier et al. synthesized hollow carbon nano-spheres via the hydrothermal carbonization of glucose in the presence of nano-sized latex templates.105 The morphological, electron micrograph image and XRD analysis show the uniformly shaped hollow carbon nano-spheres as shown in Fig. 10a–c. The PHCSs have a specific surface area of 410 m2 g−1 (Fig. 10d). More importantly, the good rate capability of PHCSs in SIBs demonstrated that the favorable transport properties of this unique hollow nano-sphere structure are important for the superior sodium storage performance (Fig. 10e and f).

Furthermore, the PHCSs could be synthesized by using silica as a hard template followed by silica removal with HF solution as reported by Chen et al.106 Sulfur was then infiltrated into PHCSs via a melt-diffusion-condensation process. The large pores and high surface area provided adequate space for sulfur loading and can strongly adsorb polysulfides. The carbon spheres mainly consisted of micropores and mesopores, facilitating the molten sulfur and leading to high S content and homogeneous sulfur loading. The PHCSs with 50.2 wt% sulfur achieved a high first discharge capacity of 1450 mA h g−1 at 0.05C, nearly 87% of the theoretical capacity of sulfur. Cycling tests also showed excellent initial discharge capacity as well as good cycling performance at 0.05C and 0.1C after 50 cycles. All these performance enhancements were attributed to the advantages of porous hollow carbon spheres. Pei et al. used hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) to synthesize both N-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (N-HPCS) and N-doped hollow porous carbon bowls (N-HPCBs) by using a hard template method.107 The N-HPCB is a superior host for high sulfur utilization and the testing results confirmed that the N-HPCB with 70 wt% sulfur had better electrochemical performance than conventional HCSs with an excellent initial discharge capacity of 1192 mA h g−1 at 0.2C as a cathode material in Li–S batteries. Nitrogen-doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (NHCS–O) were prepared using a hard templating method,108 which exhibited an excellent initial capacity of 1009 mA h g−1 at a high current rate of 500 mA g−1 for LIBs. This excellent electrochemical performance was due to synergetic effects between the oxygen-containing group and graphitic carbon. Similarly, hollow-in-hollow carbon spheres with hollow foam-like cores (HCSF@C) could be prepared by using a hard templating method.26 When used as a cathode material for Li–S batteries with a sulfur loading of 70.3 wt% in sulfur/carbon nanocomposites, the S/HCSF@C can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1347 mA h g−1, which is 81% of sulfur's theoretical capacity. A shell consisting of microporous carbon (MPC) can prevent active sulfur loss and the hierarchical porous structure of hollow porous carbon can increase the efficiency of electron and lithium ion transport in Li–S batteries.109 The S/HPC cathode with a sulfur loading of 40.6 wt% in the composite delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1660 mA h g−1, which is very close to the theoretical value of 1675 mA h g−1 for sulfur. Zeng et al. combined hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) and vulcanized trithiocyanuric acid (TTCA) to obtain a HCNs–TTCA composite for Li–S batteries with a sulfur loading of 65.0 wt%.110 This composite had an initial capacity of 1430 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and retained 443 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. The electrochemical testing results indicated that a high loading of the vulcanized TTCA by the HCNs (with high surface area and large pore volume) could be obtained and covalently bonded to sulfur, effectively suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides.
In addition, nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon spheres (NHCs) were used as a coating for Li–S batteries' separator.70 The NHC-coated electrode was prepared by a slurry coating method, and the battery showed an initial discharge capacity of 1656 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and could retain a discharge capacity of 720 mA h g−1 (5C). Furthermore, because of the high electrical conductivity of the NHC coating and thoroughly dissolved electrolyte, the ion transportation and electron conduction were significantly improved.
For LIBs and NIBs, for example, hollow-in-hollow carbon spheres (HIHCSs) with multiple shells were prepared by a hard templating method as anode materials for LIBs.111 The HIHCS anode had a high capacity of 937 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and exhibited stable cycling after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1. The results indicate that the hollow in hollow structure of HIHCSs shortened the distance of lithium ion diffusion and when combined with the large electrode contact area, the lithium ion storage and the charge of capacity are notably increased. N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (NHCNSs) with tuneable shell thicknesses were synthesized using an emulsion-based method.112 The NHCNSs were prepared by direct carbonization, and used as the anode materials for LIBs. The electrode delivered a specific capacity of 2053 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 879 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 100 cycles, which indicates a great cycling stability.
Additionally, nitrogen-doped porous interconnected double-shelled hollow carbon spheres (N-DHCSs) were prepared by using a hydrothermal method with high lithium storage capacity of 1154 mA h g−1 (1.5C) and great stability at 512 mA h g−1 (1.5C) after 500 cycles.113 When used in SIBs, the graphene layers facilitate sodium ion transport and storage, and presented an initial discharge capacity of 392 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1.
Overall, PHCs exhibit promising application potential in energy storage due to their high encapsulation ability, tunable porous structure, and high compatibility with other materials.
5. Porous carbon sphere composites as electrodes for rechargeable batteries
In order to increase the energy density, power density and cycling stability, a large number of anode materials, such as metal oxides (TiO2,114,115 MnO2,116–121 CoO,122etc.), metal sulphides (MoS281,123,124) and lithium alloying metals,125–129 have been extensively investigated. Different types of active materials/porous carbon sphere composites are summarized in Table 2. However, these promising anode materials still have inherent challenges: irreversible capacity loss, relatively low electronic conductivity and large volume change during the charge/discharge process. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the electrochemical performances of porous carbon sphere/active material composites as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. The methods for fabricating porous carbon sphere composites are also summarized in Table 2, including templating (hard and soft), hydrothermal, spray drying, Stöber strategy and chemical vapour deposition approaches.
Metal oxides (MxOy, M = Co,130 Ni,131–135 Mn,136–140 Fe,141,142etc.) have been regarded as promising anode materials for LIBs due to their high specific capacity compared to graphite. For instance, CoO has a high theoretical capacity of 715 mA h g−1 and has been intensively studied in previous reports.143–145 However, CoO has large volume expansion (180%) during cycling and has relatively poor electrical conductivity. Liu et al. developed a strategy of facile aerosol spray pyrolysis to synthesize ZnO–CoO nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon microspheres with a hierarchical 3D porous structure.146 This composite demonstrated a high specific capacity of 1250 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 150 cycles and excellent cycling performance. In this work, the PCMs were prepared by spray pyrolysis of a carbonaceous source (i.e., sucrose), then the ZnO–CoO nanoparticles were decorated on PCMs by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The superior performance of ZnO–CoO@PCM was attributed to the integrated advantages of porous carbon microspheres and ZnO–CoO nanoparticles, which uniformly dispersed inside the carbon frameworks. Müllen et al. prepared a novel hierarchically hollow core–shell MnO2/C superstructure as an anode in LIBs via a co-assembly and templating method.147 The unique face-to-face contact mode between carbon frameworks and hollow MnO2 nanospheres was built for accommodating the MnO2 volume changes and enhancing ionic transport, simultaneously improving the mechanical stability, utilization, and reaction kinetics of MnO2 anodes in LIBs. A high capacity of 850 mA h g−1 was retained even after 300 full charge/discharge cycles, indicating an excellent electrochemical performance. CoO/C hybrid microspheres prepared via a solvothermal approach were reported by Zhang et al.122 The particle size (from micrometer-sized dense spherical particles to 3D interconnected nanoparticle aggregates) could be adjusted by increasing the pH value of the reaction mixture of cobalt chloride and glucose. Aromatic compounds containing cobalt ions were formed through polymerization and then the subsequent formation CoO/C hybrid spheres via the simultaneous solvothermal carbonization occurred. The good electrochemical performance of CoO/C hybrid microspheres was due to the cobalt oxide nanoparticles being homogeneously distributed in the carbon matrix, thus ensuring that the formed Li2O and Co stayed in contact without separation during charge/discharge processes. Hou et al. designed a kind of Si/SiO2@ hierarchically porous carbon material and adopted it as a highly efficient polysulfide reservoir for Li–S batteries.25 The porous structure of carbon spheres could support strong physical adsorption while the Si/SiO2 layer strengthened the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides. Moreover, the high surface area with a well-ordered pore size distribution provided more active sites not only to restrict the movement of polysulfides but also to promise the easy ingress and egress of Li+ ions.
Additionally, a hollow mesoporous carbon@titanium nitride (HMC@TiN) host was successfully designed for loading 70 wt% of SeS2 as a cathode material for Li–SeS2 batteries.148 The HMC@TiN was prepared by a hard templating method (Fig. 11a and b). The TiN shell played a chemical barrier role resulting in retarding the diffusion of polyselenides out of the electrode. The HMC@TiN nanospheres showed well-maintained spherical morphologies with intact shells as shown in Fig. 11c. The HMC@TiN electrode delivered a high initial capacity (983 mA h g−1) and excellent cycling and rate stability (Fig. 11d–g). Moreover, they exhibited promising areal cycling stability (up to 4 mA h cm−2) as shown in Fig. 11f. However, compared with Li–S batteries, the inevitable problem associated with Li–Se batteries is that owing to the higher molar mass of Se, the gravimetric energy density of the Li–Se battery is less than half of that of Li–S batteries. Liu et al. used a facile way to synthesize a novel mesoporous Ge@C sphere anode with stable and high capacity for lithium ion batteries.149 In this work, the diameter of each sphere is ∼500 nm with a mesopore size of ∼14 nm and a specific surface area of 348 m2 g−1. The mesoporosity between Ge particles and the carbon matrix created a buffer layer that effectively stabilized the encapsulated Ge particles during voltage changes and mitigates the aggregation of active particles during the lithiation/delithiation process. The initial discharge capacity reached 1653 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. After 100 cycles, the Ge@C anode maintained a high discharge capacity of 1099 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with a CE of 99%. The results indicated that the mesoporosity between Ge nanoparticles and the carbon matrix effectively stabilized the Ge particles and buffered the mechanical stress of the high volumetric change of Ge during repeated charge/discharge processes.

Generally, porous carbon spheres combined with high-capacity active materials for composites provide huge potential for applications as high-performance electrodes in rechargeable batteries. However, some issues such as initial irreversible capacity loss, electron conductivity and volume change have to be overcome to further improve the electrochemical performance in order to attain practical application in commercial rechargeable batteries.
6. Heteroatom doping in PCSs and porous nano-carbon materials for rechargeable batteries
The heteroatom (e.g. N, B, S, and P) doping method can effectively modify the intrinsic physicochemical properties of carbon-based materials. Performance improvements have been noted in PCSs with doping by heteroatoms in different several kinds of batteries. For LIBs, for instance, N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (NHCNSs) were synthesized directly by carbonization of hollow ZIF-8 nanospheres.112 The NHCNSs with optimal N doping produce an enhanced local density of states which can provide a large number of anchoring sites for Li+ ion adsorption because of the stronger electronegativity of N compared with C atoms. The NHCNSs, which have a shell with a thickness of 20 nm and a N-doping content as high as 16.6 at%, displayed a reversible specific capacity of 879 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 current density for 1000 cycles.
For SIBs, graphite normally has a limited Na+ ion storage capability without modification (see the discussion in Section 2). However, the sodium storage ability can be improved via heteroatom doping. Li et al. intensively investigated the mechanism of Na ion storage in hard carbon anodes and revealed the relationship between heteroatom doping and the surface energy distribution of the carbon material.150 They prepared conventional hard carbons by pyrolysis of sucrose at 1100 °C and modified them by doping with various heteroatoms (S, B, N and P). In Fig. 12a–c, the modification by heteroatoms can be seen to support a large change of the energy distribution on the surface of graphite sheets. Raman spectra can estimate the coherence lengths of graphenic domains along the lateral ab direction (La) according to eqn (2): (2)where λmma is the Raman laser wavelength (514 nm), and the IG and ID are intensity of the G and D bands, respectively. In addition, the D band at ≈1350 cm−1 is attributed to the A1g phonons of the breathing mode of C6 rings activated by the existence of defects. Raman spectra indicated that B-doped hard carbon (B-HC) has the largest average domain size of graphenic layers (Fig. 12d). According to the XRD results as shown in Fig. 12e, it was found that P- and S-doping could increase the average interlayer d-spacing, whereas the interlayer distance of B-HC was nearly the same as that of the original undoped HC. In the first cycle, both P-HC and S-HC are superior to undoped HC, exhibiting 240 and 213 mA h g−1 compared to 175 mA h g−1 for HC (Fig. 12f). The detailed slope, plateau and capacity values are summarized in Fig. 12g. In a similar manner, Ye et al. developed S, N-codoped hierarchical hollow carbon spheres (SN-HCSs) as anodes for SIBs via a templating method.151 These anodes showed superior performance with a high rate capability of 110 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. The hierarchical structure seems to facilitate ion transport and co-doping the hollow carbon spheres with sulfur and nitrogen can enhance sodium ion transfer, thus improving the total electrochemical performance.

For Li–S batteries, heteroatom doping for porous carbon sphere materials has been regarded as one of the most effective strategies due to the effective bonding between the carbon host and sulfur or Li2S after chemical modification. The unique chemical structures after doping promote strong interactions. Nitrogen doping has always been regarded as one of the most effective strategies to promote adsorption of sulfur on oxygen functional groups in the nitrogen-doped carbon framework.152,153 The optimized structures of sulfur adsorbed on –CO or –COOH groups in different types of N-doped carbon indicated different thermodynamical behaviours in the adsorbed states.152 The calculated results of enthalpy changes (ΔH) for sulfur on different substrates showed that the ΔH of a carboxyl group of pyridinic-N-doped carbon was the lowest (−56.88 kcal mol−1) compared with N-free carbon or N-doped carbon without a carboxyl group. Therefore, the nitrogen-doping promoted the bonding effect of sulfur atoms with oxygen-containing groups. In addition, the nitrogen doping of mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon (MPNC) could change the electronic structure of nearby oxygen atoms in the N-doped carbon framework to once again promote the chemical interaction of the oxygen with sulfur. The actual nitrogen content in N-doped carbon was usually low, and had a limited enhancement of chemisorption at active sites. The “dual-doping” strategy could solve this problem to some extent. For instance, Nazar's group reported a nanoporous carbon co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur as a sulfur host.154 For simplicity, single layer graphene using a 6 × 6 supercell and a Li2S2 molecule was used as a model for a carbon substrate and LiPSs to calculate the binding energy between Li2S2 and graphene. The results indicated that a binding energy of Li2S2 on N, S-dual doped carbon was more than twice that of N-doped carbon. With an increase of S/N ratio, the binding energy could be increased even further, indicating that N, S dual doping could effectively enhance the chemisorption of sulfur species. Xiao et al. prepared a polydopamine-coated nitrogen doped hollow carbon–sulfur nanocomposite in Li–S cells and Si/S full cells.34 Their results indicated that the sulfur preferentially diffused into the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon. Even after 600 cycles, the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon/sulfur cathode with a sulfur loading of 55.0 wt% could deliver a capacity of 630 mA h g−1 with a high CE of over 99% at 0.6C, indicating an attractive cycle stability due to a suppressed polysulfide shuttle effect.
Li et al. synthesized nitrogen-rich porous carbon spheres as a high performance anode material for LIBs.155 These porous spheres possessed a high nitrogen content (>5%) and showed an interconnected sphere structure with large quantities of mesopores. The porous carbon spheres were prepared by using SiO2 as the occupying position template and showed an enhanced electrochemical performance. The low content of micropores caused a low specific surface area, which was beneficial for enhancing the initial CE. On the other hand, abundant mesopores were introduced to shorten the transport length of the lithium ions and facilitate liquid electrolyte diffusion. Furthermore, the high inherent content of nitrogen could create more lithium ion storage sites and increase the electric conductivity of amorphous carbon. The N-PCS achieved a relatively high initial CE, good rate capability, and stable cycling performance.
Similar to sulfur in Li–S batteries, iodine as a cathode material in Li–I2 batteries has promising application in comparison with traditional cathodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries because it is abundant on the earth (low cost) and in the ocean (50–60 μg iodine/Locean).156–160 The iodine cathode has a high theoretical specific capacity of up to 211 mA h g−1 and a reasonable operating voltage of ∼3.0 V in Li–I2 batteries. The rechargeable Li–I2 batteries using N-doped hollow carbon folded-hemispheres as hosts, presented a high iodine utilization, excellent cycling stability, and superior high rate capability, which was reported by Deng et al.73 They suggested that the highly porous architecture facilitates uniform distribution of electrolyte and allows highly efficient mass transport. However, the porous structure of hollow spheres usually results in a low stacking density, which leads to low energy density in batteries. In this work, the folded hemisphere (N-FHS) was adopted to increase stacking capability and improve volume energy density. The undoped, carbonaceous, hollow-structured hosts with a nonpolar porous carbon shell only provided physical confinement by adsorbing active materials such as sulfur or iodine. After the heteroatom nitrogen doping, more defect sites formed on the carbon host, resulting in an increasingly polar surface which would enhance the interaction between the host and iodine. The NFHS-based PCS electrode in Li/I2 batteries delivered an energy density of 156.4 W h kg−1 (0.5C), a power density of 11.6 kW kg−1 (60 °C), and achieved good long-term cycling stability, which retained 84% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles at 5C. The research about PCSs as a host for iodine in cathodes is at an early stage, but has shown an attractive prospect for application in rechargeable Li–I2 batteries.
In metal (Li, Na, and Zn)/air batteries, it has been reported that nitrogen-doped carbon electrodes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions with improved discharge capacity.96,161,162 Co-doping N-doped carbon nanomaterials with a second heteroatom (B, S or P) can modulate the electronic properties and surface polarities to further increase oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Dai's group reported N, P co-doped carbon as bifunctional air electrodes in primary and rechargeable Zn/air batteries.163 Aniline monomers were polymerized in the presence of phytic acid to prepare a PANi hydrogel through a hard template-free gelation method (Fig. 13a). The isolated N-doped, the isolated P-doped and the N, P-co-doped structures were identified by density functional theory (DFT) methods having minimum ORR overpotentials of 0.44, 0.47 and 0.47 V, respectively, while the lowest Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) overpotentials for these structures were 0.41, 0.49 and 0.39 V, respectively (Fig. 13b and c). The minimum overpotentials of N, P co-doped graphene for the ORR and OER indicated that the bifunctional N, P co-doped graphene catalyst could outperform its metal/metal-oxide counterparts. This work indicated that the N and P co-doping generates synergistic effects to improve the electrocatalytic activities towards in both the OER and ORR. Furthermore, the performance of rechargeable Zn/air batteries (Fig. 13d and e) verified that the performance of rechargeable batteries using two N and P co-doped mesoporous nanocarbon (NPMC) metal-free air electrodes to separate the ORR and OER had been largely improved.

7. Conclusions and perspectives
Graphitic carbon-based materials are one of the most successful electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. This review has focused on the development and challenges of porous carbon sphere materials and their applications in rechargeable batteries. The “beyond graphite” carbon-based porous carbon sphere provides a large number of opportunities for preparing high-performance electrode materials for rechargeable batteries with higher energy density, longer life span and higher safety. From nano-scale to macro-scale, the porous carbon sphere presents huge prospects for commercial applications in rechargeable batteries.
Carbon in the form of graphite has been widely used as anode materials in commercial LIBs. However, the low specific capacity of graphite limits its usage in electric vehicles which demand much higher high-energy density. Based on synthesis using different approaches, some soft carbon and hard carbon spheres show a promising higher capacity (>400 mA h g−1). However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (initial irreversible capacity) needs to be improved. For sodium ion batteries, the limited sodium storage capability of graphenic carbon-based materials has to be enhanced via chemical modification, porous structure design and heteroatom doping.
The traditional commercial carbon-based (graphite) material has a limited sodium ion storage capability due to the mismatch of the graphite interlayer distance and the larger Na+ ion size. Pore design (hollow structures, etc.), a disordered carbon structure and heteroatom doping (such as with N, B, S and P) are effective to enhance electrochemical sodiation/desodiation. For porous carbon spheres, the tunable porosity and sphere structure with excellent physical and chemical properties have potential applications in SIBs. The demonstration of the adsorption-pore-filling mechanism provides a strategy for designing high-performance SIBs based on carbon-based anodes. However, further work on PCS for SIBs is required to improve the initial CE and capacity, increase the tap density and understand the sodium storage mechanism.
The electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries can be improved by rational pore structure design of carbon hosts to restrain/prevent the inherent polysulfide dissolution (the shuttle effect). Mesoporous/microporous carbon spheres are attractive for overcoming the shuttle effect problem. Hierarchical porous carbon spheres may be one of the best choices for high-loading C/S cathodes in Li–S batteries. Especially, multiple micrometer-sized PCS particles with a hierarchical structure can allow loading of a high percentage of sulphur, and therefore leads to achieving high-energy density in Li–S batteries compared with that of the nano-sized PCS particles for the Li–S battery. This hierarchical and interconnected architecture is beneficial for the fabrication of thick C/S cathodes, which not only improves the connection between individual particles with less binder but also ensures effective particle packing and high tap density. Furthermore, the robust porosity of hierarchical PCSs can allow the electrolyte penetration into the electrode, which maintains good electrochemical performance for high-volumetric-energy-density Li–S batteries. Recently, a non-encapsulation approach for fabricating high-performance Li–S batteries using functionalized low-surface-area carbon as a host provides a novel direction in the design of high loading sulfur cathodes. These methods aim to totally solve serious problems, such as sulfur dissolution, low electrical conductivity, low tap density and limited cycle stability in order to facilitate the practical applications of Li–S batteries.
For metal–air batteries such as Li–O2 batteries, it is very challenging and highly desirable to prepare effective electrocatalysts for O2/Li2O2 conversion and facilitate O2 and electrolyte diffusion. The porous carbon sphere with ordered mesoporous channels and a hierarchical mesoporous/macroporous structure can provide a high density of reactive sites for Li–O2 reactions and abundant space to accommodate discharge products.
Overall, the preparations and applications of porous carbon spheres play an important role in developing advanced rechargeable batteries with high energy density, power capability and long cycle life. These achievements can help shed light on the developments of next generation lithium/sodium ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, lithium–iodine batteries, lithium/sodium–air batteries and other new rechargeable battery systems. Although their current performances do not fully satisfy the needs of commercial applications, their tremendous potential will attract intensive investigations to improve their overall physical and chemical properties for energy storage and conversion.
