    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 4th September 2017AbstractAlthough perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 23.6%, one major bottleneck for further improving the PCE is the lack of suitable hole transport materials. To further understand the structure–property relationship of hole transport materials and design new materials, we calculated the energy levels and optical properties of a series of thienothiophene derivatives by using density functional theory, and their hole transfer behaviors were also described by the Marcus charge transfer theory. It is found that the HOMO energies gradually decrease as the number of thiophene rings (n) increases when n is less than 4. However, when n is more than 4, the HOMO energy is a constant value of −5.23 eV. As for the LUMO energy and energy gaps, they show a similar change trend, that is, a gradual decrease with growing n. Optical calculations showed that thienothiophene extension cannot affect the Stokes shifts of thienothiophene derivatives. Importantly, it is found that the hole mobility of thienothiophene molecules is co-determined by the molecular size and odd or even number of thiophthene units, and all investigated thienothiophene molecules show higher hole mobility than Sprio-OMeTAD due to the face-to-face packing model. These results provide useful information to further develop suitable HTMs used in PSCs.
Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the hottest topic in the photovoltaic field due to three noteworthy advantages: simple fabrication methods, inexpensive precursors, and remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–6 A great many reports have pointed out that the high PCE of PSCs is attributed to the broad light absorption, tunable band gap, high charge carrier mobility, and long electron–hole diffusion length of perovskite materials.7–9 Most high-performance PSCs reported so far have been fabricated on the basis of the transparent electrode/electron-transporting material (ETM)/perovskite/hole-transporting material (HTM)/metal configuration.10 The HTM plays an important role in increasing the long-term stability and determining the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Among many HTMs reported, amorphous 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is an efficient and commonly used organic small molecule HTM due to good solubility in organic solvents, good film-forming performance, and matching frontier molecular orbital energies.11–15 However, the multi-step synthesis necessary for the preparation of Spiro-OMeTAD and low hole mobility limit its practical applications in large area PSCs. In this regard, the development of efficient and cost-effective HTMs remains a challenging and imperative investigation.
In the last few years, although HTMs with different central cores have been developed and used in the state-of-the-art PSCs, such as truxene,16 triptycene,17 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene,18 pyrene,19 thiophene derivatives,20 spiro-type derivatives,21 bathocuproine,22 and azomethine,23 which show efficiencies in the range of 10–18%, the HTM design is still hampered by our poor understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure of HTMs and their carrier transport properties, energy levels, and stability. It is therefore vital to further explore the structure–property relationship of HTMs to develop super PSCs.
Triphenylamine and thiophene units are usually used as organic fragments of efficient HTMs. For example, Mhaisalkar et al.20,24 reported three HTMs, namely KTM3, H111, and H112. Their results showed that PSCs based on new HTMs exhibit PCEs in the range of 7.3–14.9%. Nazeeruddin et al.25 developed three new star-shaped benzotrithiophene-based HTMs, BTT-1, BTT-2, and BTT-3, and the new HTMs were tested in solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. PCEs in the range 16–18.2% were achieved under AM 1.5 Sun.25 Soon afterwards, they synthesized three donor (D)–π–donor (D) HTMs, and the results showed that the D–π–D structure with a planar configuration could be a promising strategy to design small molecule HTMs.26 Otherwise, a lot of HTMs including triphenylamine and thiophene units have been reported,27 and many studies have proved that HTMs with planar cores are more helpful for increasing the PCE of PSCs compared with HTMs with non-planar cores.28,29 Inspired by the aforementioned studies, we attempt to further investigate the relationship between the number of planar thienothiophene units and molecular hole transport properties. All investigated molecules have been shown in Fig. 1. The work will provide important information for the further development of HTMs for PSCs.

Computational methods
The geometries of the investigated molecules in their neutral and cation states were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. All the structures in the excited state were optimized by the TD-DFT method at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The solvent effect was taken into consideration using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM)30 with dichloromethane solvent. All calculations were carried out in the Gaussian 09 code.31
The hole transport can be considered as a hopping process in the organic semiconductor at room temperature. The hole mobility can been evaluated using the Einstein equation:32 (1)where e is the charge and kB denotes the Boltzmann constant. D is the diffusion constant, which can be calculated by using the following equation: (2)where n is the spatial dimensionally (n is equal to 3 in our work), ri is the centroid distance of hole hopping channel i, Pi is the hopping probability of specific path i, and ki is the hole transfer rate constant of hole hopping channel i, which can be calculated by the standard Marcus equation:33 (3)where h is the Planck constant, λ is the reorganization energy, which is calculated by using the adiabatic potential energy surface method,33,34 and V is the hole transfer integral, which can be expressed by the site-energy corrected method35 using the PW91 functional and Slater-type triple-ζ plus polarization (TZP) basis sets,36,37 using the ADF (Amsterdam density functional) package.38 (4)where, S12 is the spatial overlap integral between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of two monomers and J12 is the transfer integral considering no electrostatic polarization effects. E1 and E2 are the site energies of monomer 1 and monomer 2, respectively. We assume that H is the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian of the dimer that includes the two monomers. Their HOMOs are denoted as Ψ1HOMO and Ψ2HOMO. J12, E1, E2, and S12 can be calculated as: J12 = 〈ψ1HOMO|Ĥ|ψ2HOMO〉(5) S12 = 〈ψ1HOMO|ψ2HOMO〉(6) E1 = 〈ψ1HOMO|Ĥ|ψ1HOMO〉(7) E2 = 〈ψ2HOMO|Ĥ|ψ2HOMO〉(8)
Results and discussions
Electronic structure
In PSCs, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution and energy of the HTM are associated with the PCE of PSCs. Specifically, good delocalization of the HOMO is favorable for hole transport, the high hole mobility of the HTM plays an important role in increasing the short-circuit current density and fill factor of the device;39 the HOMO level of the HTM is also a key factor in determining the open-circuit voltage of the device, which is relative to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO level of the HTM; low HOMO energy can lead to high open-circuit voltage.40 The calculated FMO distributions have been shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, we found that both the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) possess π orbital features. The HOMOs of all investigated molecules spread over the whole molecules, while the LUMOs are mainly localized on thienothiophene units and nitrogen atoms of triphenylamine. Based on the HOMO picture, we conclude that all molecules may have good hole transport properties due to a wide HOMO distribution.

Another way to investigate the electronic properties is to analyze the HOMO energy, LUMO energy, and fundamental gap (ΔE). In the present work, the fundamental gap is defined as the difference between the ionization potential and electron affinity given by Bredas.41 The calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and fundamental gap are listed in Table S1 of the ESI.† A previous study42 has indicated that the reliability of the calculated HOMO levels of organic molecules is determined by selected functionals. For example, the HOMO level will be overvalued by the B3LYP, PBE1PBE, and MPW1B95 methods, while it will be underestimated by the PBE38, MPWB1K, and BHHLYP methods. Recently, a semi-empirical equation for calculating the HOMO energy has been proposed by us, which is reasonable for evaluating the HOMO energy of the phenylamine-type HTM.43 So, the HOMO levels of thienothiophene derivatives are evaluated by using the semi-empirical equation. The LUMO energy was evaluated using the expression: LUMO = HOMO + ΔE. To verify the reliability of the above procedure, we took SS-2 as an example to calculate its HOMO energy, LUMO energy, and ΔE. The calculated HOMO energy, LUMO energy, and ΔE are −5.19, −2.43, and 2.67 eV, respectively, and the corresponding experimental values are −5.20, −2.49, and 2.71 eV.26 The calculated values are in good agreement with the experimental values, which indicates that the above procedure is capable of evaluating the HOMO energy, LUMO energy and ΔE of the investigated molecules. These values of molecules SS-2–SS-6 have been shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO energies gradually decrease as the number of thiophene rings (n) increases when n is less than 4. However, when n is more than 4, the HOMO is a constant value of −5.23 eV. The results suggested that 4 is the optimum number to adjust the HOMO energies of thienothiophene derivatives. As for the LUMO energy and ΔE, they show a similar change trend, that is, a gradual decrease with growing n.
Considering the energy levels of a perovskite (for example CH3NH3PbI3), we found that the HOMO energies of thienothiophene derivatives are higher than the valence band of the perovskite (−5.43 eV). The results indicated that the thienothiophene derivatives should have an efficient hole extraction capability, and the PSCs based on SS-4, SS-5, and SS-6 can exhibit higher open-circuit voltage compared to those based on SS-2 and SS-3. Furthermore, the LUMO energies of thienothiophene derivatives are also higher than the conduction band of the perovskite (−3.92 eV), which will allow sufficient offset of the conduction band of the perovskite to not only block the electrons from the perovskite, but also to ensure a cascade of electron transfer at the interface when the HTMs are excited.26 As of result, the thienothiophene derivatives can become promising HTMs for PSCs from the FMO viewpoint.
Spectra and Stokes shift
As an advantage, the HTM layer is supposed to be colorless, because the UV-Vis light absorption of the HTM would affect the light harvesting efficiency of perovskites.44 To characterize the optical properties of thienothiophene derivatives, we performed TD-DFT calculations in dichloromethane for all investigated molecules at the MPWPW91/6-31g(d,p) level. The absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 3, and detailed spectroscopic data are listed in Table S2 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of thienothiophene derivatives in dichloromethane at the MPWPW91/6-31g(d,p) level. 
As shown in Table S2, ESI,† the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of SS-2 is 394 nm, which is in good agreement with the corresponding experimental value of 410 nm, indicating that the method of calculation of absorption spectra is reliable for the studied molecules. As a result, all molecules have only one strong absorption peak in the visible light region, corresponding to the dominant transition from HOMO to LUMO (SS-2, 89%; SS-3, 89%, SS-4, 87%; SS-5, 86%; SS-6, 85%). Moreover, not only does the λmax of thienothiophene derivatives show a gradual red shift with the growing number of thiophene rings, but also the oscillator strengths become more and more strong. The change trend can be explained by the enhanced electron-donation ability of thienothiophene. From Table S2 of ESI,† we also found that the λmax of thienothiophene derivatives is in the range of 381–444 nm, while the edge of the UV-Vis light absorption curve usually reaches 800 nm.45 The results indicated that their absorption peaks appeared close to the visible region and overlapped slightly with the absorption band of perovskites. It is noteworthy that there is a good linear relationship between the number of thiophene rings (n) and maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), the relation expression is λmax = 12.4n + 371.2 (R2 = 0.9928, n = 2–6). The relationship indicated that introducing an extra thiophene ring increases the λmax by 12.4 nm.
In addition to the optical absorption properties, the maximum emission wavelengths (λemi) of the investigated molecules were also calculated at the MPWPW91/6-31g(d,p) level at the excited-state geometries. The excited-state geometries of thienothiophene derivatives were optimized at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The relevant data are also shown in Table S2 of the ESI.† The results show that λemi increases gradually with the growing number of thiophene rings. According to the predicted λmax and λemi, the Stokes shift can be evaluated by using the formula: Stokes shift = λemi − λmax. Mhaisalkar's study pointed out that a large Stokes shift is helpful in pore-filling of the HTM for PSCs by light soaking post-treatment or simple annealing.18 Table S2 of the ESI† lists the Stokes shift of thienothiophene derivatives and Fig. 4 shows the change trend of the Stokes shift from SS-2 to SS-6. As a consequence, although the Stokes shift shows a decreasing trend from SS-2 to SS-6, the difference is very small. This suggested that the thiophene unit length has almost no effect on the Stokes shift.

Crystal structure and hole mobility
As we all know, at room temperature, charge transport properties are dominated by the hopping model. Here, we modeled the charge transport as a Brownian motion process,46,47 as described by a particle diffusion process coupled with Marcus theory for the carrier transfer rate for a self-exchange reaction process.47 In the hopping model, there are two important parameters for determining the charge transport rate: reorganization energy (λ) and transport integral. Efficient charge transfer needs a small λ and large transport integral. In the present work, the λ is calculated by using adiabatic potential energy surface method. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The results show that the λ of the investigated molecules is in the range of 0.198–0.225 eV. Moreover, the λ shows a decreasing trend from SS-2 to SS-6, this decrease is mainly because the increase in the number of double bonds in the backbone promoted π-electron delocalization and extends the effective conjugation length of the system.48 From the viewpoint of λ, the introduction of the thienothiophene unit is an efficient strategy for improving the hole transfer performance.
 Fig. 5  Calculation of the reorganization energies of the investigated molecules by using the adiabatic potential energy surface method. 
Apart from λ, the transport integral is another important factor for determining the hole mobility of a material. The transport integral in organic semiconductors is highly sensitive to the relative orientation of adjacent molecules.49 The crystal structure data are essential for the calculation of the transport integral. Previous reports have pointed out that the molecular crystal structure can be predicted by using the Materials Studio software package. In the present work, the polymorph predictor calculations are restricted to the ten most probable space groups, P21/C, P, P212121, C2/C, PBCA, P21, PNA21, CC, PBCN and C2, because many organic molecules are found in these space groups according to the statistics of the Cambridge Structural Database.50 We sorted the obtained crystal structures in terms of their total energies. Finally, the crystal structures of molecules SS-2–SS-6 with the lowest energies were selected for further DFT calculations on their hole mobility. The obtained crystal structures are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† and crystal data are listed in Table S3 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. S1 ESI,† we found that the theoretical crystal structure of SS-2 belongs to the P space group, while the corresponding experimental space group is P121/n1; the difference can be explained by temperature, specifically, the experimental crystal structure of SS-2 is measured at low temperature (120 K), while the crystal structures of the investigated molecules were predicted at room temperature (300 K).
Based on the predicted crystal structures, we arbitrarily chose one molecule in the crystal as the carrier donor and took all its neighboring molecules as paired elements. In the basal stacked organic crystals, the neighboring molecules can be characterized as the P1, P2, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6 dimers, as shown in Fig. 6, and the calculated hole transport integral, centroid to centroid distance, and hole mobility of all investigated molecules are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, SS-5 shows the highest hole mobility due to the large transfer integral of the T6 dimer, SS-2 exhibits the lowest hole mobility among all investigated molecules. The order of hole mobility is SS-5 (6.71 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1) > SS-6 (6.48 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) > SS-3 (5.58 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) > SS-4 (1.72 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) > SS-2 (7.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, we find that the change trend of hole mobility does not agree with that of reorganization energy with the growing number of thiophene units. These results imply that the transfer integral plays a more important role in determining the hole mobility than the reorganization energy of thiophthene derivatives. More interesting, it is found that the hole mobility of all investigated molecules is determined by the molecular size and odd or even number of thiophthene units. Compared with the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD (5.65 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),42 all investigated thiophthene derivatives have higher hole mobility. The above results show that thiophthene derivatives are promising HTM candidates for the fabrication of efficient PSCs.

Conclusion
In this work, we studied the change trends of molecular energy levels, optical properties, and charge transport behaviors with the increase of the number of thiophthene rings (n) attached to the π-system by using density functional theory combining with the Marcus charge transfer theory. Our results show that the LUMO levels and energy gaps decrease as n increases, while the change in HOMO levels is not the same, the HOMO energies gradual decrease as n increases when n is less than 4, however, when n is more than 4, the HOMO is a constant value of −5.23 eV. Moreover, there is a good linear relationship between n and λmax, introducing an extra thiophene ring increases the λmax by 12.4 nm. However, n in thiophthene derivatives cannot influence the molecular the Stokes shift. It is important that all thiophthene derivatives have higher hole mobility than Spiro-OMeTAD. These results let us believe that thiophthene derivatives have potential for replacing Spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs.
