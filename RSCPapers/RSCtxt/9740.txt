    , Accepted 31st October 2019First published on 1st November 2019AbstractElectrochemical water splitting is economically unviable due to the sluggish kinetics of the anodically uphill oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is directly linked to the design and facile fabrication of low overpotential water oxidation electrocatalytic materials, engaging applied methods and earth-abundant precursors. Here, we demonstrate facilely synthesized ZnTe nanospheres (ZnTe-NS) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst, executing water oxidation with a much lower energy cost relative to other previously reported non-noble metal-based catalytic systems. The catalytic system shows excellent performance, initiating the oxygen evolution reaction at just 1.41 V vs. RHE (η = 180 mV) and reaching current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 at 1.44 V vs. RHE (η = 210 mV) and 1.63 V vs. RHE (η = 400 mV), respectively; this performance is superior to state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, a modest Tafel slope of 62 mV dec−1, indicative of a one electron and one proton transfer mechanism, and a large TOF of 0.25 s−1 at just η = 210 mV are achieved. The catalyst advantageously exhibits a stable current density of >50 mA cm−2 for more than 24 hours during water electrolysis experiments for extended time periods. The hydrothermally developed ZnTe-NS are 150–200 nm in size and display hollow structures, as evaluated via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. XRD and XPS techniques are employed to confirm the formation of ZnTe-NS. DFT calculations show that hydroxyl attachment energy is very favorable on the highly porous and crystalline ZnTe-NS, further confirming their remarkable properties for enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity. This study demonstrates valuable insights into developing the first example of a highly durable Zn chalcogenide, more specifically ZnTe-NS, as an efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst material for water oxidation. Through an easily accessible synthesis method, ZnTe-NS maintain their integrity, morphology and chemical structure, even after many hours of continuous water electrolysis.
Introduction
As hydrogen is the cleanest energy source and has a high energy density, it has the propensity to replace perilous conventional energy sources obtained from fossil fuels.1 Furthermore, the burning of fossil-based fuels in automobiles and power generation stations also creates an increased amount of CO2 gas in the environment, which is a major pollutant that causes global warming.1,2 To mitigate environmental adulteration and meet the growing energy needs of the world, electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most promising methods for producing eco-friendly hydrogen-based fuels with zero emissions and no carbon footprint.3–5 Water splitting mainly comprises two separate reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The OER is the more challenging and plays a very important role in many energy conversion processes; it is kinetically sluggish due to difficulties related to O–H bond breaking and O–O bond formation, therefore limiting the overall efficiency of the water splitting process.1,6–10 In practice, the large-scale production of hydrogen via electrocatalytic water splitting is essentially limited by the high overpotential of the OER and the low stabilities of electrocatalysts under vigorous oxidative conditions. Therefore, to produce hydrogen gas at optimum efficiency, the design and ultimate fabrication of active, low-cost and durable electrocatalytic materials are prerequisites. In this regard, ruthenium,11 iridium,4 and palladium12 oxide thin films are viewed as excellent catalysts for the OER due to their high efficiencies and low overpotentials for initiating the challenging OER; nonetheless, their commercial use is prohibited due to their paucity and high cost.13 Therefore, the major interest of researchers is to develop low-cost earth-abundant non-precious electrocatalysts that can facilitate the OER with a low energy cost with optimum yields and be stable during long-term application.
During the last decade, transition metal oxides and hydroxides have been extensively studied, aiming to reduce the overpotential of the OER (2H2O = 2H2 + O2@1.23 V vs. RHE). However, single metals/metal-oxides have not shown promising results due to the instabilities of the catalysts in vigorous oxidative environments.14 Electrocatalytic materials derived from bimetallic oxides and from mixed-metal oxides have also been explored for water oxidation,14 but their low stabilities and lower intrinsic conductivities have hampered their long-term catalytic efficiencies and limited their commercial applications.13,15,16 Recently, Fe–NiCr2O4 nanoparticles coated on a nickel foam substrate presented high activity and stability during water oxidation catalysis.4 An ideal candidate for efficient water oxidation catalysis should execute the OER at an overpotential below 1.50 V vs. RHE and must show high oxygen evolution current densities (10–100 mA cm−2) with ease over many hours of catalysis testing while performing with tremendous stability.14 Therefore, research is ongoing to find a better material for OER catalysis that can reduce the overpotential and display high stability during water oxidation.17 For this purpose, the development of benchmark electrocatalytic materials showing the aforementioned catalytic features and exploiting earth-abundant materials and simple synthesis methods is of tremendous significance.13,16
Recently, metal chalcogenides have emerged as alternative materials due to their versatile structures and covalencies, which assist charge transfer at the electrode/electrocatalyst-electrolyte interphase during the oxygen evolution reaction and are considered better OER electrocatalysts in comparison to Ru and Ir oxides and other non-precious metal oxides.18 Metal chalcogenide-based efficient OER catalytic materials, including sulfides,5,19–21 selenides4,22–24 tellurides,8,16,25–28 and phosphides,17,29–32 have been developed for potential oxygen evolution application under neutral or alkaline conditions. However, tellurides have attracted the most attention from researchers due to having better band alignment with water oxidation states compared to selenides and sulfides. Also, tellurides are relatively less toxic and possess much enhanced covalent characteristics that can favorably facilitate the OER.33,34 Furthermore, the tellurization of transition metals can reduce their redox potentials; previously, tellurization has lowered the oxidation potentials of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Co2+ to Co3+ (ref. 27) and thus made water oxidation more energy efficient. Along with these marvelous characteristics, Te exhibits relatively stronger metallic characteristics and thus imparts excellent electronic conductivity on electrocatalysts, ultimately ensuring better OER performance.8,35,36 Owing to these fantastic features, researchers have introduced a few metal-Te-based electrocatalysts, such as Ni3Te2/NF, CoTe2/TM nanoarrays, and NiTe2/TM, initiating the oxygen evolution reaction with onset potentials of 1.45 V vs. RHE, 1.53 V vs. RHE, and 1.54 V vs. RHE, respectively.6,12,29 CoTe2–MnTe2 hybrid nanowires typically grown on titanium mesh have produced a current density of 50 mA cm2 at an overpotential of 310 mV under alkaline conditions.8
Another important parameter is the nano-scaling of the structural attributes of the material, which can change the macroscopic bulk properties and enhance the catalytic efficiency of the material under investigation.5–7,37–45 Furthermore, introducing nanotextured morphological features can also induce a large number of open electroactive sites, which play a significant role in efficient electron transfer and facile mass transport at the interfaces during catalytic reactions.1,46,47 Synthesis methods can be tuned to achieve the desired preparation, as they play a key role in obtaining morphological control over the size, shape and catalytic features of the material. Although many metal tellurides have been synthesized, research into zinc-telluride synthesis and its application to catalysis is rare. We report here the synthesis and electrochemical water oxidation activity of nanoscale zinc-telluride hollow nanospheres for the very first time. The ZnTe electrocatalyst is prepared via a hydrothermal method, and structural, morphological and compositional analysis revealed the excellent nanoscale hollow porous features and high crystallinity of the catalytic material. Furthermore, the hollow ZnTe nanospheres (ZnTe-NS) show substantial OER activity on a simple nickel foam (NF) substrate. The ZnTe-NS/NF system is shown to initiate the slow OER at a low onset potential of just 1.41 V vs. RHE and demonstrates much better OER activity and stability than previously reported Co- and Ni-derived telluride materials. This is attributed to the activation of catalytic active sites by the Zn2+ to Zn3+ pre-oxidation step at a much lower potential, which ultimately lowered the energy cost for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that highly porous, nanoscale ZnTe-NS with a high electroactive surface area provide optimum active sites for the adsorption of OER intermediates on the catalyst surface, thus making the overall process energy efficient. Also, the structural and morphological attributes of the catalyst remain intact, even after long-term continuous catalytic activity testing, hence further confirming the robustness of the catalytic system.
Experimental section
Preparation of ZnTe nanospheres
ZnTe hollow nanospheres were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. A hydrothermal method is chosen here due to it being a straightforward strategy that involves mild conditions and a much simpler set-up. In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.1 mM ZnCl2 and 0.1 mM tellurium powder were dissolved in 8 mL of 6 M KOH solution. Then 2 mL of hydrazine monohydrate was added to the above mixture, which was stirred for 2 hours at ambient temperature. Following that, 20 mL of the obtained mixture was placed inside a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 200 °C for 3 h. The as-obtained greyish precipitate was filtered, collected and centrifuged several times with de-ionized water and ethanol. Afterward, the material was dried at 70 °C overnight by keeping it in an oven. The powdered ZnTe-NS were collected and saved for characterization.
Electrode preparation
For the preparation of the working electrode, small pieces of nickel foam (NF) (1 cm × 2.5 cm) were cut and sonicated in de-ionized water, ethanol, and acetone for 15 minutes each. NF electrodes were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 20 minutes. To analyze the activity of the facilely synthesized ZnTe-NS, a homogenous catalyst ink was prepared via adding 15 mg of catalyst powder into 100 μL of deionized water, followed by ultrasonication for 1 hour. ZnTe-NS were physically deposited on already washed and cleaned NF using a drop-casting method. In this way, 10 μL of thus-prepared catalytic ink was drop-cast through a micropipette onto a 1 cm × 1 cm area of Ni foam. The ZnTe-NS deposited on the NF electrodes were then dried at room temperature and directly employed for OER catalysis studies.
Material characterization
A Bruker D8 focus diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation was used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to probe the crystal structure of the as-synthesized product, with a tube current of 10 mA, and an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. A HITACHI-S4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer and a HITACHI H-7700 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 100 kV was used to analyze the morphology and composition of the as-synthesized catalytic powder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to determine the surface composition and valence band position of the catalyst using an ESCALAB 250 Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source, having a resolution of 0.5 eV. During XPS characterization, ambient temperature conditions were maintained, while the pressure was controlled at 5 × 10−10 mbar. The spectra were referenced using the adventitious C 1s reference peak at 284.5 eV.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical investigations, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and controlled potential bulk electrolysis (CPE), into water oxidation are carried out using a computer-controlled AUTO LAB potentiostat (PGSTAT-204) using a typical three-electrode system enclosed in a Teflon-covered Pyrex glass cell. Prior to use, the electrochemical cell was cleaned by boiling it in a 1:3 mixed solution of H2SO4 and HNO3 followed by boiling in ultrapure water, as described previously.4 After that, the cell was rinsed many times with ultrapure water, then with acetone, before being ultimately dried in an oven at 80 °C for 30–40 minutes. Pt wire was used as a counter electrode and before placing it into the electrochemical cell, it was immersed in a 20% solution of HNO3 for a few minutes after washing with pure water. A saturated silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode was employed as a reference and commercially available nickel foam (NF) modified with ZnTe-NS was used as a working electrode. All the measurements were carried out in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution with a pH ≈ 13.5 at room temperature. CVs are measured via intentional cycling from a negative to a positive potential at scan rates of 5, 20 and 50 mV s−1. Before measuring the electrochemical activity, purging of the electrolyte solution was done with argon gas for 30 minutes. All the current values are corrected considering the geometrical area of the working electrode. All potentials have been reported after 50% IR compensation, which is performed manually using the following relation:EActual = EExperimental − IR
All potentials acquired vs. Ag/AgCl were converted into RHE potentials using the following equation:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0Ag/AgClwhere EAg/AgCl is the potential measured against the Ag/AgCl electrode, E0Ag/AgCl is the standard thermodynamic potential (0.197 V) of Ag/AgCl, and ERHE is the calculated potential vs. a RHE.
Tafel slope calculations from the polarization curve
The catalytic activity and kinetics are calculated via plotting a Tafel graph considering the linear region of the steady-state polarization curve, and can be expressed via the equationη = a + (2.303RT/αnF) × logjwhere η is the overpotential, α is the charge transfer coefficient, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and j is the current density. The slope represents the relationship 2.303RT/αnF.
Turnover frequency
TOF values of ZnTe-NS deposited on NF for the oxygen evolution reaction are theoretically calculated via the following equationTOF = I/4 × F × mwhere m is the number of moles of active catalyst, I is the current in amperes at 1.58 V vs. RHE, and F is the Faraday constant.
Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA)
The electrochemically active surface area of the catalyst was measured via evaluating the electrochemical double-layer capacitance and CV measurements at different scan rates (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mV s−1). The electrochemical capacitance is obtained simply via fitting the average current density versus scan rate curve.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
This was undertaken (0.1 Hz to 100000 Hz frequency range) to measure the solution resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrode–electrolyte interphase. Rs and Rct were obtained via fitting the simplest Randles circuit using NOVA 1.10 software for the Metrohm Autolab electrochemical station, a computer-controlled potentiostat.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of nanoscale ZnTe
ZnTe-NS are synthesized following a simple and facile hydrothermal method. Primarily, the morphology, size, and structural properties of ZnTe-NS are evaluated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1a shows a typical SEM image of a ZnTe sample and reveals the nanoscale features and spherical or pseudo-spherical shape. The nanospheres are slightly agglomerated in the form of bunches, where individual NPs can also be visualized easily and are seen to be fairly homogeneous in size and distribution. However, there are some hollow spaces between the nanoparticles, showing the individual identity of the ZnTe-NS. Further, to gain deep insight into the nanostructural features, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis were undertaken. An overview TEM image shows that the ZnTe-NS extend in a bunch-like fashion, where individual particles interconnect with each other in some cases (Fig. 1b). A high-magnification TEM image confirms a particle size of around 150–200 nm for the ZnTe nanospheres, with thin walls enclosing discrete structures (Fig. 1c and d). It was also observed that the nanospheres are hollow and have a porous structure, demonstrating a rough surface that is highly desirable and ascribed to facilitate charge and mass transportation during electrocatalytic reactions (Fig. 1b and c).

The internal microstructure was further investigated via HR-TEM and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. High-resolution TEM images confirm the presence of inter-crossed fringes, which obviously indicate the crystalline nature of the ZnTe nanospheres. The inter-planar spacing values between adjacent lattice fringes are estimated to be 0.139 nm, 0.124 nm and 0.352 nm, which correspond to the (311), (422) and (111) crystal planes of the ZnTe nanospheres (Fig. 2a and b). Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) of ZnTe-NS shows clear and discrete reflection dots indicating good crystallinity, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. The inter-planar spacing values are calculated to be 0.352 nm, 0.215 nm, 0.183 nm, 0.152 nm and 0.124 nm, which perfectly match the reference data (PDF # 01-089-3054) for ZnTe nanospheres. It can clearly be observed that ZnTe consists of randomly distributed regions with no preferred orientation, showing its polycrystalline nature. It is further observed that these nanospheres consist of large numbers of spots, each arising from a Bragg reflection from multiple crystals reflected at different scattering angles, giving a continuous pattern of spots with random orientations. The reciprocal of the average radial distance between two spots is equivalent to the Bragg's d-spacing value.11b

The active phases and purity of the catalyst are investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis, as shown in Fig. 2d. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to a cubic ZnTe structure, which is in good agreement with the available standard pattern (PDF # 01-089-3054). As observed, ZnTe-NS present 7 distinct diffraction peaks at 25.76°, 29.2°, 41.8°, 49.53°, 51.9°, 60.7° and 66.81°, indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400) and (331) planes of ZnTe respectively. Furthermore, the narrow and sharp peaks indicate the high crystallinity and good purity of the product and support the application of the modified hydrothermal method used for the synthesis of the pure ZnTe nanomaterial. The sharp peaks indicate the polycrystalline nature of the nanospheres.
The crystal structure shows the simple coordination of the Zn and Te atoms, in which one Zn atom is coordinated to 4 Te atoms with tetrahedral geometry. On the other hand, one Te atom is coordinated with 4 Zn atoms with the same symmetry, as shown in Fig. 3 (details are given in the ESI†). The ZnTe layer structure coordinates alternately along the z-axis. The interatomic distances between the Zn and Te atoms are very small, around 2.671 Å. Therefore, the structure can have several Zn–Zn and Te–Te metallic bonds as edge-sharing dimeric units oriented at 180 degrees with respect to their neighbors. The ZnTe4 layer is connected via edge-sharing, forming a continuous layer of tetrahedral ZnTe polyhedral, signifying that the polyhedra geometry can result in enhanced catalytic performance during the OER. ZnX4 undergoes geometric variation (from tetrahedral to square pyramidal) upon the attachment of hydroxyl ligands, as previously mentioned in coordination complex studies.15b The periodic arrangement of Zn and Te atoms gives rise to hexagonal channels within the structure. Favorably, the crystalline structure of ZnT-NS facilitates water oxidation catalysis. The availability of Zn sites at outer positions of the polyhedra may be extremely useful for anion adsorption and subsequent high catalytic activity. The simple arrangement and coordination of atoms in the (001) plane of ZnTe make it a very useful and efficient material for the absorption of OH− at vacant sites.

Elemental compositional analysis of bulk ZnTe-NS confirms that the catalytic layer is constituted of 29% Zn and 41% Te. However, some background signals from oxygen are also observed; this might be incorporated into the catalytic surface due to air/moisture exposure (Fig. S1†). The exact structure, chemical nature of the surface, and possible oxidation states of the metals in ZnTe-NS are examined with the help of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The XPS survey spectrum of ZnTe-NS (Fig. 4a) indicates the presence of Zn, Te, C, and O at corresponding binding energies (BEs). The peaks at 1022 eV (ref. 37) and 572.4 eV (ref. 9) are the characteristic BEs of Zn2+ (2p3/2) and Te2− (3d), as the dominating states, thus confirming the formation of ZnTe. The Zn 2p XPS spectrum shows a dominant peak at 1021.8 eV, which can be ascribed to the 2p3/2 BE, indicating the existence of Zn in a 2+ oxidation state (Fig. 4b).37 The XPS spectrum of Te contains a peak at 572.4 eV, which can be assigned to Te2− (3d)26,36 (Fig. 4c). The signal from C due to absorbed CO2 is clearly positioned at 278 eV, and signals from O due to the exposure of the product surface to air during synthesis are clearly positioned at 531.4 eV and 532 eV, corresponding to lattice and adsorbed O respectively (Fig. 4d).1,8

The porous texture of ZnTe nanospheres has been studied via sorption isotherm and pore size distribution curve studies (Fig. S2 and S3†). The BET sorption isotherm is found to be “S” shaped, showing a type 3 isotherm with a H-3 hysteresis loop in accordance with IUPAC classifications.38 The pore size distribution curve shows that ZnTe-NS contain several pores, calculated to be 1.48 nm in diameter. The surface area and total pore volume are calculated using the BET adsorption isotherm, and are found to be 14.9 m2 g−1 and 0.00278 cm3 g−1, respectively. The large surface area and pore volume improve the catalytic activity via the smooth transportation of reactants and oxygen molecules. Thus, all the physical characterization studies indicate that ZnTe-NS prepared via the facile hydrothermal method are nanotextured and highly crystalline, and favorably demonstrate high surface area and porous structural features. All these features are highly desirable for satisfactory catalytic performance and can facilitate the adsorption/desorption of various intermediates with optimum efficiency on the nano-textured catalytic surface during the OER.
Oxygen evolution activity
In order to evaluate the catalytic performance of the ZnTe-NS based electrocatalytic material, thin film electrodes were obtained via the surface coating of catalyst on nickel foam (ZnTe-NS/NF) and they were tested through sustained water oxidation catalysis in an alkaline medium. Previously, Zn-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam showed efficient activity for the OER under basic conditions.12 For catalytic investigations, the nanoscale ZnTe is deposited on a conductive substrate, nickel foam, and the electrochemical activities of ZnTe-NS/NF and bare nickel foam without a catalyst coating are primarily evaluated via cyclic voltammetry experiments at a low scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 5a). The CV profile shows the appearance of peroxidative features at 0.75 V vs. RHE, which are attributed to Zn2+ oxidation to Zn3+. This is followed by a sharp catalytic wave at a potential of 1.41 V vs. RHE, which indicates the initiation of the oxygen evolution reaction, with the appearance of tiny O2 bubbles on the electrode surface (inset of Fig. 5a). However, no such catalytic current signatures were observed for the bare NF electrode (Fig. 5a). Thus, the ZnTe-NS/NF system executes the OER at an overpotential of 180 mV, which is amazingly low relative to other state-of-the-art water oxidation electrocatalysts based on simple non-noble metals.13,14 Following that, the magnitude of the OER curve current rises rapidly, achieving a high current density value of >160 mA cm−2 at just 1.73 V vs. RHE. The reverse scan illustrates the appearance of a broad reduction peak at around 1.3 V vs. RHE as well.

Fig. 5b presents a comparative analysis of the onset overpotentials of recently reported metal-chalcogenide and ZnTe nanosphere derived electrocatalysts, and the overpotentials required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope values are given in Fig. S4.† The comparative chart shows that ZnTe-NS/NF executes water oxidation at the lowest applied potential relative to other metal-chalcogenides, such as metal-phosphide, metal-selenide and metal-telluride based electrocatalysts, for the OER. Furthermore, the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope value for ZnTe-NS/NF are comparable and much better than previously reported Ni and Co chalcogenide-based catalytic systems (Fig. S4†). The low onset potential of ZnTe-NS/NF is attributed to the conductive and highly porous nature of the catalyst immobilized on the conductive nickel foam substrate, which further supports optimum charge transfer during catalysis. It is notable that ZnTe-NS on NF have been reported for the first time with such excellent OER activity under alkaline conditions.
The high porosity is also confirmed via TEM and BET analysis and provides enhanced active sites for the adsorption of various reactants/intermediates on the catalyst surface during the OER, thus making the electrochemical reaction more feasible. In this work, the primary figure of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is recorded for 10% efficiency solar-to-fuel conversion devices and is considered a benchmark figure for comparing the electrochemical activities of different catalysts.4 Here the ZnTe nanosphere electrocatalyst requires only a 210 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than most reported OER catalysts based on transition metal chalcogenides (Table 1). The high catalytic activity of metal tellurides is ascribed to gradual changes in the electronic band structure and the alignment of valence and conduction band edges with oxidation–reduction potential levels; thus, they can favorably initiate the oxidation of water at a much lower applied potential relative to pure metal electrocatalysts and other metal–metal and metal/non-metal combinations.39 It is also noticeable from the literature that increases in covalency around the transition metal may improve the catalytic activity of a nanomaterial. Therefore, the high OER activity of ZnTe-NS can be credited to the electronegativity and high degree of covalency of ZnTe, as tellurium has the lowest electronegativity among all group members.26

To effectively study the surface coverage of nickel foam after depositing the catalyst on it, ZnTe-NS drop cast on the nickel foam substrate (ZnTe-NS/NF) were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, as shown in Fig. S5a–d.† Fig. S5a and b† shows images of bare nickel foam and nickel foam coated with ZnTe. It can be visualized that the surface of the nickel foam is fully covered with ZnTe-NS, while ZnTe-NS maintain their morphological features. This further suggests the negligible effects of the conductive NF substrate on the catalytic outcome, which is wholly due to ZnTe-NS. However, the nickel foam substrate has a high electroactive surface area and thus facilitates the strong adhesion of the porous nano-catalyst over its surface, which ultimately smooths charge transfer between the electrode and electrolyte through exposing more active sites.
To completely study the electrocatalytic performance of ZnTe-NS and eliminate any effects from the incorporation of conductive nickel foam, ZnTe-NS were also deposited on inert electrodes, such as glassy carbon (GC), and tested for water oxidation. Analysis of the activity of ZnTe-NS is presented in Fig. S6 and S7.† ZnTe@GC also shows a promising outcome. A pronounced pre-oxidation peak is observed at 0.75 V vs. RHE accompanying the excellent low oxygen evolution reaction onset potential of 1.42 V vs. RHE; it also demonstrates an impressive Tafel slope of just 77 mV dec−1 and very low charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interphase (Fig. S6 and S7†). Likewise, the overpotential needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 287 mV. These results are analogous to those obtained on the conductive nickel foam substrate (Fig. S8†). The electrocatalytic outcomes observed from ZnTe-NS/NF are better than previously reported RuO2- and IrO2-based catalytic systems investigated under similar electrochemical conditions (Table S2†). All these results suggest that ZnTe-NS are a new promising material for water oxidation, performing well on many conducting substrates. All the parameters and findings, along with catalyst loadings, are also summarized in Table S1.†
Furthermore, to gain more insight into the water oxidation electrochemical kinetics, Tafel slope analysis is undertaken. The Tafel slope is calculated taking into account the linear region of the CV curve. The ZnTe nanosphere catalyst presents a low Tafel slope value of 62 mV dec−1, which is better than many previously reported catalysts and is comparable to CoTe, which has a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5c). This also confirms the facile catalytic process at the electrode/electrocatalytic surface. Mainly, the water oxidation reaction involves the formation of oxo-intermediates and consists of 4 proton-electron transfer mechanism steps, as shown in eqn (1)–(4). M + OH− ↔ M–OH− + e−(1) M–OH− + OH− ↔ M–O + H+ + e−(2) M–O + OH−(l) ↔ M–OOH + e−(3) M–OOH + OH− ↔ M + O2(g) + H+ + e−(4)
It is hypothesized that during catalytic reaction under alkaline conditions, ZnTe-NS are involved in the formation of a hydroxo-telluride surface, similar to the oxy-hydroxide surface formed on oxide-based electrocatalysts. In accordance with the Tafel slope value, the predicted rate-determining step for the OER is the second electron transfer step.40–46 It is predicted that ZnTe-NS undergoes the alteration of its electronic structures through the oxidation of Zn2+ to Zn3+, forming the hydroxo-telluride intermediate, coupled with deprotonation and followed by peroxide formation. This peroxide formation is further supported by less electronegative tellurides, leading to dioxygen O2 molecule formation, without changing the ZnTe nanosphere compositional and structural characteristic features, as evidenced through post-catalytic activity characterization (further discussed below). Furthermore, ZnTe-NS/NF demonstrates nanoscale porous attributes that ultimately help with the adsorption of various intermediates on adjacent nanoparticles and facilitate O–O bond formation more easily at the catalyst surface.48
The facile electrochemical kinetics of ZnTe-NS/NF are also represented through the small value of charge transfer resistance on the electrode surface. Fig. 5d represents the corresponding Nyquist plot for the ZnTe-NS/NF system, and the small diameter of the semicircle indicates fast electron transfer, the conductive nature of the catalyst, and the facile catalytic processes occurring on the catalytic surface. The value of Rct is obtained from the low frequency region of the Nyquist plot through fitting a simplified Randles circuit (inset of Fig. 5d). The Rct value calculated for ZnTe-NS/NF is only 55 Ω, indicating excellent electronic transfer that can also be ascribed to the high surface area that ultimately facilitates OER activity.
The electrochemically active surface area of the ZnTe-NS electrocatalyst is assessed through measuring the double-layer capacitance. Specifically, cyclic voltammograms from ZnTe-NS/NF were measured considering the non-faradaic region of the CV curve from 1.13 to 1.17 V vs. RHE at scan rates between 10 and 30 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution (Fig. 6a). The cathodic and anodic currents were measured at 1.135 V and 1.161 V vs. RHE, respectively, and the difference between the currents is plotted as a function of scan rate. Thus, CDL is calculated to be 12 mF (Fig. 6b). Considering specific capacitance of 0.04 cm−2, an electrochemically active surface area of 300 cm2 is observed for ZnTe-NS/NF, suggesting a large surface area that demonstrates many enhanced electroactive sites constituting the catalytic surface. The ECSA value is higher than previously reported Ni3Te2,15b which showed an ECSA of 48 cm2.
 Fig. 6  Electrocatalysis: (a) cyclic voltammograms from ZnTe-NS/NF obtained considering the non-faradaic region of the CV curves at various applied scan rates; and (b) the difference between the anodic and cathodic current measured at 1.16 and 1.135 V, respectively, vs. RHE directly from Fig. 5a and plotted as a function of scan rate. 
The electrocatalytic activity parameters observed for the ZnTe-NS system are compared with previously reported catalysts, and the results are demonstrated in Table 1. It must be noted that this comparison can only provide an estimate of relative catalytic activity between all the catalysts because all systems differ widely in terms of the electrochemical conditions employed for measuring the OER outcomes.
The TOF is another critical parameter that can be calculated to check the OER performance of a catalyst. The TOF quantifies the specific activity of a catalytic center for a particular reaction under the defined reaction conditions from the number of catalytic cycles occurring at the center per unit time.4 The TOF value of ZnTe-NS is calculated to be 0.25 s−1, demonstrating the enhanced kinetics of the catalyst at an applied potential of 1.44 V vs. RHE where a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is achieved.
At this point, it is imperative to propose the origin of the enhanced OER activity on ZnTe-NS. The high catalytic activities of metal tellurides are ascribed to gradual changes in the electronic band structures and alignments of valence and conduction band edges with oxidation–reduction potential levels; thus, they can favorably initiate the oxidation of water at much lower applied potentials relative to pure metal electrocatalysts and other metal–metal and metal/non-metal combinations.39 It has previously been mentioned that lowering the electronegativity of anions induces the oxidation of transition metals in coordination complexes at lower applied potentials. Therefore, it is predicted that Te-based anions can alter the chemical potential around the Zn sites recurrently, as observed in coordination complexes where the oxidation potential of the central atom is lower, as the electronegativity of anions decreases down the chalcogenide group. Indeed, it was observed that the Zn2+ oxidation potential resulted in an oxidation peak in the cathodic region, indicating that Zn3+ was generated at a lower potential compared to many Ni- and Co-based chalcogenides (S, Se and Te); it is evident from the Zn3+ pre-oxidation peaks that it can act as an active site at low potential, which will certainly escalate the catalytic activity via lowering the onset potential in combination with the overpotential for the OER. Therefore, the high OER activity of ZnTe-NS can be credited to the electronegativity and high degree of covalency of ZnTe, as tellurium has the lowest electronegativity among all group members.
Besides the oxidation of Zn2+ to Zn3+, oxygen evolution begins after the attachment of a hydroxyl group to the surface of the central metal atom. It must be mentioned here that the surface activation of the ZnTe-NS electrocatalyst is initiated via the attachment of a hydroxyl group at the ZnTe surface, which involves the formation of hydroxo-telluride species rather than the oxy-hydroxide species that are usually formed on oxide surfaces. Therefore, we have simply estimated the adsorption energies through DFT via employing Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals. The computational calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). Details of calculations are given in the ESI.† Typically, the OER consists of a four step process, and more time is required to carry out detailed computational studies to understand the OER kinetics. Herein, the hydroxyl energy required for the activation of the ZnTe catalyst has actually been calculated. The crystal structure of ZnTe contains 3 active Zn sites: one at the top of the ZnTe cube, one tetrahedral Zn site, and one square pyramid Zn atom (Fig. S9–S12†). The Ead value for OH− attachment to these Zn sites has been estimated using one lattice (001). The Zn sites have been designated as ZN, TH and SQ for the top, tetrahedral and square pyramid sites, respectively, on (001) planes. The calculated cohesive energies of hydroxyl ions on the (001) surface of ZnTe are −2.923 eV (ZN), −2.510 eV (TH), and −2.011 eV (SQ). All these adsorption energies, along with the d(Zn–O) Å and d(Zn–Te) Å bond lengths and their bond angles after the adsorption of the hydroxyl group, are summarized in Table 2, while details of the calculations are provided in the ESI† along with instanced rendering crystallographic planes (Fig. S9–S12†). Interestingly, it was observed that, irrespective of the differences in the calculated OH− ion adsorption energies on different Zn sites in ZnTe, all of these obtained values were relatively larger than the previously reported hydroxyl adsorption energies on Ni3Te2 and NiO surfaces (−1.608 eV).15b These results suggest that the surface activation of Zn sites through hydroxyl attachment is very simplistic, with ZnTe possibly providing a route to more optimal OH− group coverage at low potentials. This factor, combined with the low electronegativity telluride anions causing the swift generation of Zn3+ as shown by the electrochemical data, may lead to the faster onset of catalytic activity at a lower onset potential. On that basis, the lower onset potential based on electrochemical studies proved the fact that the ZnTe surface is more auspicious for high water oxidation activity.

The commercial application of an electrocatalyst is dependent on its long-term durability and stability. The marvelous catalytic performance of ZnTe-NS/NF compelled us to evaluate the long-term durability of the catalyst under the employed conditions. The long-term stability is examined via chronoamperometry and repeated CV scans under similar electrochemical conditions. The repeated CV scans produce similar electrochemical signals from the 1st and 100th CV cycle conducted at 50 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH (Fig. S13†). The CV cycles signify no catalytic performance loss under vigorous oxidative conditions.
Chronoamperometry experiments are conducted at 1.58 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution for more than 24 hours of continuous electrolysis to evaluate the durability of the catalyst (Fig. 7). The time vs. current density curve shows that a high current density of >50 mA cm−2 was obtained and sustained for 24 continuous hours, with only minor degradation over time. The stability of ZnTe-NS can be attributed to the co-ordination environment and covalent character, which increases after the tellurization of zinc.33 Vigorous oxygen bubbling is also observed from the electrode surface, thus representing the excellent catalytic activity of the ZnTe-NS system for water oxidation. Interestingly, the LSV curves from ZnTe after carrying out the OER continuously for 24 h did not show any decrease in the onset potential, and the LSV curves before and after catalytic activity were perfectly superimposable (Fig. S14†). Furthermore, the long-term stability is also examined after depositing catalysts on GC. As expected, the catalyst can maintain its activity for many hours of electrolysis, as shown in Fig. S15.† These electrochemical results suggest that ZnTe-NS prepared via a simple hydrothermal strategy are a highly active and durable electrocatalyst for the OER and are highly applicable.

Lastly, any changes in the morphology, composition and chemical nature of the catalyst following an extended period of catalytic operations were investigated through various analytical techniques, such as XPS, XRD, and SEM imaging. In order to avoid background signals from the NF substrate, sample powder was carefully scratched from the NF and used for analysis. XPS spectra are shown in Fig. S16a–d,† demonstrating the survey spectrum of ZnTe and high resolution Zn 2p and Te 3d XPS spectra. Noticeably, the XPS data from ZnTe-NS before and after catalytic activity did not show any obvious shifts in the peak positions. Further, there was no evidence for the presence of Zn-oxidic phases, and the Te signal showed a negligible shift in its peak position. As shown in Fig. S16d,† the O 1s peak only showed adsorbed O2 characteristics and traces of Te oxides, but no Zn oxides, therefore, the ZnTe chemical structure remains the same, even after a prolonged OER period. The surface morphology of ZnTe-NS investigated through SEM imaging (Fig. S17†) after carrying out the OER didn't reveal any major alterations to the morphological features either. Fig. S18† shows a comparison of the XRD pattern of ZnTe-NS before and after OER activity. As is clearly seen from the pattern, there are no significant changes in peak positions after such prolonged OER activity in 1 M KOH solution. There are some minor contributions from Te oxide phases on the catalytic surface, but the major bulk composition and structure of the catalyst remain intact.
Conclusions
Metal chalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for facilitating water splitting and other energy conversion reactions with optimum efficacy and high durability, due to their high intrinsic conductivities and activities. To date, a large number of transition metals, more specifically nickel- and cobalt-based chalcogenides, have been introduced for water splitting catalysis. Taking into account all those efforts, we have demonstrated here a facile hydrothermal method for the selective fabrication of zinc telluride nanosphere-type structures. Thus-obtained nano-textured ZnTe was deposited on a conductive surface, nickel foam, and the electrochemical activity and stability of the modified electrode were examined via cyclic voltammetry and constant potential chronoamperometric analysis under alkaline conditions. The catalyst exhibits marvelous electrochemical activity and durability, driving down the energy input for the kinetically slow OER. ZnTe-NS/NF initiates the OER at a lower onset potential of just 1.41 V vs. RHE, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is achieved at just 210 mV, and a lower Tafel slope of 62 mV dec−1 is illustrated. This may be due to the good electrical conductivity, high covalence and low electronegativity of Te, and it has been proved that increasing the covalency around the transition metal enhances the catalytic activity. Along with disclosing a highly useful, low-cost catalytic system, we also demonstrate OER mechanistic details on ZnTe-NS. This study demonstrates the significant potential of designing high-performance OER catalysts while incorporating cost-effective precursors and simpler methods with fewer chemicals and synthesis steps.
