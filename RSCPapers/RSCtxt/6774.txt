Bio-based polymers, in particular those derived from cellulose or other carbohydrates, are often considered benign alternatives for petrochemical plastics. The majority of bioplastic precursors are currently derived from fermentation or biotechnology. Chemocatalytic routes to both similar and new polymer building blocks are emerging in an effort to mitigate challenges related to carbohydrate fermentation, such as waste generation and costly product purification. This review critically surveys recent developments in applying heterogeneous catalysis for the production of bio-based polyester monomers from cellulose or cellulose-derived carbohydrates. Highlighted target molecules include various α-hydroxy acids or esters (e.g. lactic and glycolic acid, lactide and methyl vinyl glycolate), furandicarboxylic acid, ethylene glycol and isosorbide. The production of lactic acid from glycerol will exceptionally be included as well, as an oversupply of glycerol might contribute to non-negligible amounts of lactic acid in the future.

Introduction
Since the 20th century, plastics have become ubiquitous in everyday life. For example, thermoplastics such as polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are used in applications ranging from disposable packaging and clothing fibres to even space ships. The vast majority of plastics are still derived from petrochemical sources. In 2015, 322 Mtons of plastics were produced globally, with an annual growth of 3–4%.1 Most of these plastics are very persistent and, when not incinerated post-consumption, never fully degrade. Instead, they are fragmented and may accumulate even on remote locations, exemplified by the accumulation of plastic (micro)fragments in the oceans.2–4 Rising concerns of the environmental impact of these plastics and the dependency of (depleting) fossil reserves have triggered the search for more sustainable alternatives. In this regard, bioplastics have received considerably more attention since the 1990s and in particular since the early 2000s.5 In 2016, 4.7 Mtons of bioplastics were produced, roughly corresponding to 1.5% of all plastics.6 The majority of these bioplastics were however (partially) bio-based drop-ins such as polyurethanes (PUR) and PET. Fully bio-based alternatives such as polylactic acid (PLA) or polybutylene succinate (PBS) only constituted minor fractions of the total amount of bioplastics (Fig. 1, outer wedge). Though not exploitable in the short to medium term, the total maximum technical substitution potential of bio-based polymers was estimated to be 90% of the total plastics used worldwide (Fig. 1, grey area).5,7 Whether such values will ever be reached, remains a question for now. Nevertheless, the increasing number of publications on bioplastics over the past years demonstrates the amplified interest in a more sustainable plastic industry. When discussing bioplastics, one should distinguish “bio-based” from “biodegradable” and use the latter in the proper context.8 Indeed, biodegradability depends on specific conditions (e.g. temperature, presence of air and water) and environments (aquatic, marine, compost, soil, in vivo, etc.) and might not occur under unsuitable circumstances.

By definition, bio-based polymers comprise all plastics derived from renewable carbon sources such as biomass. Similar to oil, the composition of raw biomass is diverse, consisting primarily of lignocellulose (= cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), but also of lipids, proteins and terpenes. Each fraction may provide a unique set of molecules that can serve as monomers for bioplastics.9 For example, recent reviews have discussed monomers derived from lignin,10 terpenes or vegetable oils9 and even metabolically derived synthons.11 In particular, the utilization of cellulose or cellulose-derived carbohydrates for the production of polymer building blocks (both new and drop-in) has been a focal point of research.12,13 A variety of different monomers can be derived from cellulosic biomass, by both fermentative and/or catalytic routes (Fig. 2). Notably, most of these cellulose-derived monomers are highly functionalized molecules, especially compared to oil-based monomers. Multiple acid and/or alcohol groups are usually present in the same molecule, rendering them particularly suitable for the production of (new types of) polyesters. From a chemical point of view, preserving the inherent functionality of biomass into the target molecules (e.g. assessed by the functionality index or F:C ratio14) is more interesting than removing oxygen atoms by redox reactions. Rather than forcefully converting biomass into platforms that were convenient to produce from fossil resources (e.g. bio-based PE), the inherent functionality of biomass should be utilized to the fullest extent possible.15 Therefore, a slow transition of the polymer market towards entirely new sets of bio-based polymers, in particular polyesters, is expected in the long term.

All abbreviations may be found in the Abbreviations section at the end of the article. Molecules of which the names are in bold are discussed in this review. 
Until now, research has mainly focused on biotechnological routes for the conversion of (cellulose-derived) carbohydrates to polyester monomers or other chemicals (e.g. ethanol). Well-known examples include lactic acid (LA),16,17 succinic acid (SA),18 itaconic acid (IA)19 and glutamic acid (GTA).12 LA and SA may be used for the production of biodegradable polyesters such as PLA and PBS, which are already commercially available. Both are considered suitable substitutes for petrochemical thermoplasts (e.g. PE and PET). Polymers of IA can be used as corrosion inhibitors, elastomers or in medical applications.19 GTA-based polymers (naturally produced by bacteria20) find applications in medicine, food and pharmaceuticals.12 A peculiar example of biotechnology for bioplastics is the in vivo production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which are bacterial polyesters that can be isolated from cells after fermentation. Main members of the PHA family are polymers of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HBA) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3-HVA).5 They are considered environmentally benign alternatives to conventional petrochemical plastics and can serve in various applications ranging from packaging to medicine (e.g. drug delivery carriers or bio-implant materials).21,22 Their production on a large scale is however still limited. Although biotechnological routes have typically been the go-to strategy for producing polyester monomers from cellulose-derived carbohydrates, sustainability issues may arise when order of magnitudes larger volumes are needed. Fermentative processes are typically limited in terms of operating conditions, and often require pH quenching and multi-step purification of the product from the (often complex) fermentation broth. For example, acids are typically isolated as salts, which are acidified again later on, resulting in substantial amounts of waste and high costs. Moreover, fermentations are usually performed in batch reactors and can be slow, sometimes over the course of several days. As the concentrations are also rather low, the development of continuous fermentative processes is difficult.
Alternatively, research into using heterogeneous catalysis for the production of bio-based monomers has intensified over the past decade. Compared to biotechnology, chemocatalysis provides a completely different toolbox to produce bio-based monomers. Catalytic methods typically allow for a broader range of operating conditions and solvents, which may lead to faster or more selective reactions. Furthermore, new molecules or monomers may be obtained, which cannot be produced by biotechnological means. For example, unconventional polyester building blocks were recently discovered by converting carbohydrates using Lewis acidic zeolites.23 Structural properties of solid catalysts can give unique and beneficial advantages as well. For example, the shape-selectivity of certain zeolite catalysts may be exploited for the selective formation of products due to pore-size control, as recently demonstrated for the catalytic production of lactide (LD), a PLA intermediate.24 Similarly, designing dual-site catalysts may permit multistep reactions to be performed simultaneously. Depending on the desired reaction, both active functionalities can be tuned and optimized. Last but not the least, catalysts usually provide a racemic mixture of two enantiomers in case of chiral products, whereas fermentation typically provides only one enantiomer, e.g. in the case of LA. Of course, this does not imply that heterogeneous catalysis is superior to biotechnology. Catalytic processes obviously face their own challenges and extensive research will be necessary to deliver the full potential. A high selectivity towards the desired product(s) and good stability of the catalyst will be particularly crucial for economic viability, which is not always evident for reactions with (usually highly functionalized) biomass substrates. Combining the best of biotech and chemo-catalysis will ultimately be essential for the development of bio-based polymers.25
In this critical review, the (research) progress in heterogeneous catalysis for the production of bio-based polyester monomers from cellulose or cellulose-derived carbohydrates will be surveyed. Recent advances, remaining challenges and future prospects will be highlighted. To keep the scope concise, only monomers of which a reasonable amount of literature covering heterogeneous catalysis is available, will be discussed. What we believe to be the most important cellulose-derived monomers in this pretext are shown in bold in Fig. 2, along with a few key biotechnology-based monomers. The production of LA from glycerol (GLC, technically not a sugar) will exceptionally be included as well, as an oversupply of GLC might contribute to non-negligible amounts of LA in the future. The review is structured as follows: first, the catalytic production of LA and LD for PLA production is highlighted, along with other LA-like α-hydroxy acids or esters such as glycolic acid and methyl vinyl glycolate. Then, the production of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid will be discussed, followed by the application of heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of diols (ethylene glycol and isosorbide). Finally, a summarized overview is given on the importance of various catalyst properties for the selective production of these monomers.
Lactic acid and lactide
Lactic acid/alkyl lactates from carbohydrates
The catalytic production of 2-hydroxypropionic acid, commonly known as LA, has been the subject of intense research in the past decade. The global market of LA is estimated to be approximately 300–400 kton per year.26 In 2010, LA was included in the US Department of Energy's top 10 carbohydrate-derived chemicals.27 It can serve as a platform for a variety of other chemicals such as acrylic acid, pyruvic acid, propylene glycol, 2,3-pentanedione and alkyl lactates, which are useful as green solvents.28–30 Alternatively, LA is the building block of PLA, a renewable and biodegradable plastic and one of the first synthetic bio-based polymers that has been commercialised and produced on a large scale. Various life cycle analyses have already demonstrated its environmental benefits compared to conventional polyolefins.31,32 Although PLA was already synthesized for the first time in 1845 by the condensation of LA,33 a breakthrough occurred only in the 1990s when Cargill Inc. developed a route to high-molecular weight PLA by the ring-opening polymerization of LD.34,35 Since then, commercial PLA production steadily increased, from 20 ktons in 2002,36 to 360 ktons in 2013,37 with a forecasted annual growth rate of 10% until 2021.6 The largest PLA producer is NatureWorks, producing 150000 ton per year in Blair, Nebraska,31 though a total of 26 companies are already producing PLA.6 Currently, PLA is produced in three steps: (1) the fermentative production of LA, (2) the production of LD and (3) the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of LD to high-molecular weight PLA (Scheme 1). It has been estimated that LA production, including sugar purchase, comprises approximately 50% of the total PLA production cost, LD synthesis 30% and the final ROP only 20%.5 In order to reduce PLA production costs, efforts should therefore primarily be focused on developing more economical routes towards LA and LD. Almost all LA worldwide is currently produced by fermentation.17 In-depth reviews on the fermentative production of LA can be found elsewhere.16,26,38 Generally, a suitable carbohydrate source (pentoses or hexoses) is transformed by various micro-organisms, usually to L-LA, though D-LA or mixtures of L- and D-LA can also be obtained.38 Nutrient costs, extensive down-stream processing, gypsum waste and low volumetric productivities are major bottlenecks in upscaling.16,17,26,39 Moreover, the isolation of PLA-grade LA from crude broth is a complex multi-step process.40,41 New technologies (e.g. by using lignocellulosic-derived feeds,17 improved acid tolerance of the culture,42,43 better reactor design16 or alternative separation strategies40) are trying to increase the efficiency of fermentative LA production, but results have not always been satisfactory. Approximately one decade ago, a new strategy for LA production emerged: by converting carbohydrates catalytically instead of fermentatively. Since then, the number of research papers describing the catalytic production of LA or esters thereof has increased rapidly.

Generally, LA or alkyl lactates can be produced catalytically from various carbohydrate sources such as trioses, hexoses, sucrose or even cellulose. The catalytic pathway bears resemblance to a synthetic glycolysis44 and depending on the substrate, different consecutive reaction steps are needed (vide infra). In 2005, Hayashi reported the catalytic conversion of sugars to lactates for the first time.45 In their study, homogeneous Lewis acidic Sn halide catalysts were used to convert trioses, viz. dihydroxyacetone (DHA) or glyceraldehyde (GLY) selectively to alkyl lactates (89% yield after 3 h at 90 °C) in alcoholic media (for the mechanism: see the final step in Scheme 2). Sn halides outperformed other metal halides in alcohols, but Al3+- and Cr3+-based halides are superior in water.46 Since then, other homogeneous catalysts have been reported as well for the production of lactates from various carbohydrate sources. Examples include Pb2+ ions,47 alkaline earth metal hydroxides,48,49 transition metal ions,50–52 lanthanide triflates or halides,53,54 Sn triflates,55 Sn4+-based organometallic complexes56 and NaOH-neutralized SnCl4.57

Two years after Hayashi's work, the first heterogeneous catalysts for alkyl lactate production from trioses was reported by Sels et al., who used various Y-zeolites in ethanol.58 Ethyl lactate (ELA) yields up to 65% could be obtained after 6 h at 90 °C. Later, two research groups independently reported the use of H-USY zeolites, along with a few other zeolite topologies such as H-beta, H-ZSM-5 and H-MOR.59,60 Both studies confirmed the superiority of the USY zeolites, yielding up to 91–96% alkyl lactate from trioses after 3–24 h at 115–120 °C. In 2009, a key paper was published by Taarning et al., who for the first time reported the use of Sn-beta zeolites for triose isomerization to LA or alkyl lactates.61 In methanol, ≥99% MLA could be obtained after 24 h at 80 °C. In water, LA yields were slightly lower, viz. 90%, despite a slightly higher reaction temperature of 125 °C. The Sn incorporated in the zeolite framework exhibited a turnover frequency (TOF) about ten times higher than soluble Sn (homogeneous SnCl4·5H2O catalyst), viz. 45 vs. 4.2 h−1, respectively. Since then, many different Sn-based catalysts have been reported for the isomerization of trioses to LA or alkyl lactates, including Sn-MFI,62 Sn-MCM-41,62–65 Sn-SBA-15,62 Sn-MWW,66 Sn-montmorillonite,67 Sn-USY,68 Sn–Si mixed oxides69 and silica–carbon composites.65 Most of these can produce near-quantitative alkyl lactate yields in methanol or ethanol.70 Usually, Sn-catalysts are less selective for triose conversion to LA in water. However, LA yields up to 96% have been reported using surfactant-modified Sn phosphates (140 °C, 4 h).71 Sn-free catalysts, apart from the initial USY studies, have been proposed as well. For example, Dapsens et al. proposed the use of desilicated MFI zeolites. They reported a selectivity towards LA exceeding 90% after 6 h at 140 °C, which is comparable to the Sn-beta zeolite proposed by Taarning et al.72 However, the reusability of the catalysts was limited due to leaching of the Lewis-acidic Al species by the acidic reaction mixture. Therefore, the same authors later reported the use of Ga-USY (along with other topologies such as MFI, MOR, FER, BEA and FAU) prepared through alkaline-assisted galliation for the conversion of DHA into ELA in ethanol.73,74 Ga-USY was proved to be the most effective catalyst, yielding 82% ELA after 24 h at 85 °C, the highest activities reported until then for any Sn-free catalyst. The catalysts were better recyclable than the desilicated MFI zeolites in water, though intermediate calcination was used. Sn-free mesoporous silicates have also been reported, e.g. Ga-MCM-4175 and Zn-MCM-41,76 but both are outperformed by the Sn-MCM-41 reported earlier63 in terms of ELA yields under similar conditions.
While the production of LA or alkyl lactates from trioses provides a solid test reaction for benchmarking catalysts, the use of low-value cellulose or cheap, refined mono- or disaccharides such as glucose, fructose or sucrose is more desirable from an economic point of view. In this case, a cascade of reactions is required such as the hydrolysis of cellulose or sucrose and the retro-aldol reaction of hexoses (Scheme 2). To permit these reactions, higher reaction temperatures (≥160 °C) are typically used in the conversion of hexoses or polysaccharides than for trioses (usually ±90 °C). This in turn allows more side reactions to occur, and the use of hexoses or cellulose as substrate typically results in a lower selectivity for LA or alkyl lactates.
Nevertheless, substantial progress in directly using cheap substrates for lactate production with heterogeneous catalysts has been made in the past years. The use of solid bases such as MgO has been reported,77 but typically, solid Lewis acids are used. Table 1 summarizes solid Lewis acids used for carbohydrate conversion to alkyl lactates in alcohols. From cellulose or sucrose, the Lewis acid-catalysed reaction starts with a hydrolysis reaction to their corresponding hexose building blocks. Glucose and fructose may interconvert freely through isomerization. Sn catalysts in particular have been shown to efficiently catalyse this isomerization through an intramolecular 1,2-H-shift.78–81 Next, fructose may split into DHA and GLY by a retro-aldol reaction. These trioses can then convert to LA or alkyl lactates by (i) a dehydration to pyruvaldehyde (PAL), (ii) acetalization or hydration of PAL with alcohol or water, respectively, and (iii) a final 1,2-H-shift to alkyl lactates or LA. Sn catalysts in particular are remarkably active for the latter reaction, which can formally be seen as an intramolecular Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction and Oppenauer oxidation-type redox reaction.82–84 The same mechanism is considered valid for the conversion of trioses with homo- or heterogeneous Lewis acids as already discussed above. In the cellulose- or sucrose-to-LA cascade, reactions may be catalyzed by Lewis or Brønsted acid sites, or both. It has been demonstrated earlier that balancing both acid types in the same catalyst might be beneficial for reaction kinetics.65,85 Base-catalyzed (e.g. alkali-mediated) mechanisms for LA production also exist, although there, it is hard to let this route compete selectively with other basic reactions.

The first report on the direct conversion of hexoses or sucrose to alkyl lactates was published by Holm et al. in 2010.23 Similar to their work on trioses,61 Sn-beta catalysts proved to be superior for the production of MLA from glucose or fructose, giving 43–44% MLA yield after 20 h at 160 °C (Table 1, entry 5). Sucrose on the other hand surprisingly yielded up to 68% MLA, probably due to the delayed exposure of the more sensitive hexoses to the high temperatures (entry 13). Recently, the same group reported the promoting effect of alkali salts (e.g. K2CO3) in the presence of Sn-beta for the conversion of sucrose to MLA.86 It was shown that the addition of minor amounts of alkali salts to the Sn-beta catalyst (or other stannosilicates) significantly improves the selectivity to MLA. Under optimized conditions, MLA yields up to 75% could be obtained, the highest reported from sucrose so far (entry 12). In contrast, the alkali-free Sn-beta catalyst only yielded approx. 30% MLA. The authors could not rule out that prior art has involved the use of reagents with high alkali content, giving rise to high yields of MLA. Why alkali salts improve the selectivity of the catalyst towards MLA is not yet clear. However, it has been suggested that the formation of by-products may be suppressed by the neutralization of Brønsted acidity resulting from defects in the Sn-beta framework. Many other catalysts (most of which are also Sn-based) have been reported as well, but they are typically still outperformed by the Sn-beta catalyst (entries 4–22). Recently, Orazov et al. were able to convert hexoses to ELA at moderate temperatures (100 °C) by combining MoO3 and Sn-MFI as catalysts for the retro-aldol and 1,2-H-shift reaction, respectively (entry 3).87 The lower temperatures allow the process to run at lower pressures with less catalyst deactivation and side-reactions. ELA yields up to 68–75% could be obtained, the highest yields reported for hexoses thus far, although very dilute fructose solutions were used (0.2–1 wt%). Contrary to hexoses and sucrose, the conversion of pentoses or other disaccharides in methanol typically results in lower MLA yields (entries 1, 2 & 23).88 Reports on the direct heterogeneously catalysed conversion of polysaccharides to alkyl lactates in alcohols are scarce. Nevertheless, the conversion of inulin (a polymer of fructose) with Sn-SBA-15 yielded 57% MLA (entry 24). Very recently, the direct conversion of cellulose to MLA in supercritical methanol was reported with a Ga-doped Zn/H-nanozeolite Y catalyst. MLA yields up to 58% could be obtained under optimized conditions (entry 25). The good activity of the catalyst was attributed to a synergistic effect of Ga and Zn, which enhanced the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst while simultaneously decreasing the Brønsted acid sites. The catalysts seemed stable over the course of 4 runs, but were calcined in between each run and were compared at near-complete conversions; hence true losses in kinetics might be obscured. Nevertheless, no significant decrease in surface area or Lewis acid sites was observed. The conversion of cellulose with Zr-SBA-15 in ethanol yielded only 30% ELA (entry 26).
In alcohols, Sn-based catalysts are generally considered the catalyst of choice for converting carbohydrates to alkyl lactates. On the contrary, they are often outperformed by other catalysts in water. The competitive adsorption of H2O molecules on the active site,83,95 the formation of carbonaceous deposits61 or amorphisation of the zeolite framework and degradation of the Sn centers96,97 lie at the base of this discrepancy. In water, bases such as NaOH are often added to the reaction medium along with a heterogeneous catalyst,98–100 but the high molarity of the base (often >0.05 M, corresponding to a pH > 12.7) might render such processes economically unviable due to corrosion and the need for further acidification to release the LA from its salts. High LA yields (75%) could be obtained from glucose under solvent free conditions by the use of alumina-supported KOH using microwaves, but the economic viability should be looked into.101 Solid Lewis acids and metal–organic-frameworks102 have been proposed as well,103–106 but typically result in lower LA yield or selectivity compared to Sn-based catalysts in alcohol. Alternatives such as lanthanide-based catalysts53 are currently also being looked into. For example, the use of Er/K10107 (a montmorillonite) and Er-beta108 has been proposed, resulting in relatively high LA yields (68 and 58%, respectively) directly from cellulose after only 30 minutes at 240 °C. Unfortunately, a decrease in activity was observed when recycling the catalysts, proposedly by the leaching of erbium ions, deposition of carbon species and structural changes of the catalyst. The use of algae-derived alginate as an alternative to cellulose has also been proposed, but only low LA yields (<15%) were obtained using a CaO catalyst.109
Summarized, the production of alkyl lactates in alcohols has generally been more successful than LA in water, mainly due to lower deactivation of the catalyst in alcohols. Whether chemocatalytic routes will ever replace fermentative routes is hard to forecast, but the catalytic process definitely brings along several advantages. For example, the catalytic process does not produce gypsum waste, nor does it require an extensive purification of the alkyl lactates from a complex broth. Filtration of the catalyst and collection of the ester by e.g. distillation might already be sufficient, with solvent recycling. Nevertheless, certain challenges definitely remain. Although similar values for LA productivity can currently be reached for both fermentation and catalytic processes, heterogeneous catalysts have primarily been explored under too dilute substrate and catalyst conditions.28 A major difference of both processes lies in the chirality of the LA product: fermentation mainly produces stereopure L-LA, whereas catalysts produce a racemic mixture. This may nevertheless be considered an advantage, as stereocomplexes of L- and D-PLA are known to increase its performance (e.g. by increasing melting temperature by ±50 °C).110 However, the efficient separation of both enantiomers is then critical and remains a focal point for future research, though the enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic mixtures of lactate esters with commercial lipases has been proposed earlier.111 Sn-based catalysts are superior for carbohydrate conversion to alkyl lactates, but the large-scale production of the catalysts and their stability will strictly determine the viability of the overall process. Initially, Sn-beta synthesis typically required long crystallization times (e.g. 20 days112) and very corrosive HF, although process optimizations113,114 and the development of alternative routes by post-treating (commercial) zeolites115–121 have severely simplified the high-scale production of these materials. Nevertheless, catalyst stability is still mostly assessed by consecutive batch experiments, often measured at full conversion or with intermediate calcination. Continuous flow experiments at incomplete conversion would be more insightful, and should therefore be a topic of future work. Research is currently starting to focus more on intensification and stability of the Sn-beta catalyst under continuous operation, for example as recently reported for the transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in 2-butanol.97 To correctly assess catalyst stability, one must bear in mind that certain protocols should be followed.122 Lari et al. showed that most Sn-catalysts strongly deactivate in water due to amorphisation or degradation of the Sn centres, although hydrothermally prepared catalysts were typically more stable due to their defect-free, hydrophobic framework.96 In methanol, however, fouling and Sn leaching are important side-effects, though hydrothermally prepared Sn-beta was also the most stable catalyst for converting trioses to MLA. The same Sn-beta catalyst gradually decreased in activity during the conversion of sucrose to MLA. The catalyst activity seemed to level off after 30 hours on stream, indicating the necessity of regular calcination. However, it was recently demonstrated that the presence of small amounts of water in methanol significantly influenced the stability of Sn-beta during MLA production from sucrose. With 1% of water present in methanol, Sn-beta was able to consistently produce MLA yields of ±50%, even for reaction times >400 h.123 In the absence of water, however, MLA yields diminished by 50% after 100 h on stream. The presence of water seemed to significantly reduce Sn leaching into the solution. An insightful extensive review of the topic of Sn-materials in general, and active sites and deactivation of Sn-beta specifically, is available.124 Finally, the use of edible saccharides as feedstock could be a point of discussion, although the direct use of cellulose or cellulose-derived glucose is envisioned. The use of algae-derived biomass has also been proposed, but no satisfactory LA yields could be obtained.109 Alternatively, GLC could be used, as will be discussed in the next section.
Lactic acid/alkyl lactates from glycerol
A great surplus of GLC is available (±3 × 106 tons in 2014) as it is currently considered a waste product from the soap and detergent industry and from biodiesel manufacturing. Therefore, the conversion of GLC to a variety of value-added products has been intensively investigated in the past years.125–127 One particular example is the production of LA. The strategy is to mildly oxidize GLC to DHA or GLY with subsequent conversion to LA, although care must be taken to avoid the overoxidation towards glyceric acid. Electrochemical28 and hydrothermal alkaline methods128–130 have been reported, but the high temperatures (300 °C) and strong bases required cause severe corrosion. The GLC-to-LA conversion can be pursued in a one-pot approach by using two catalytic functions under slightly milder conditions. Typically, an oxidation catalyst (usually a metal such as Cu, Au, Pt, Pd, etc.) is combined with a base or a Lewis acid. The oxidation component catalyses the oxidation of GLC to DHA or GLY, which may further dehydrate to PAL. The base or Lewis acid then converts the PAL to LA according to a benzillic acid-type rearrangement or 1,2-H-shift, respectively (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Catalytic conversion of glycerol to LA or alkyl lactates in water or alcohol, respectively. 
A few well-performing homogeneous catalysts have recently been proposed, based on Ir-, Fe- or Ru-based complexes.131–133 For example, a very high selectivity towards LA (≥95%) could be obtained with Ir-complexes at 115–160 °C, even when crude or neat GLC was used and with very low catalyst loadings (e.g. 20 ppm, corresponding to a turnover number of approx. 30000 h−1).131 Unfortunately, a significant amount of base is required (±1 equivalent per GLC) as well.
Various heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed (Table 2). Different (noble) metals (Cu, Au, Pt, Pd) on numerous supports (CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, C, MgO) have been suggested, achieving high LA yields up to 94%. However, most catalysts still require a tremendous amount of base (1–4 mol eq. per GLC), complicating possible industrial implementation due to corrosion and the formation of LA salts, posing the same purification problems as in the fermentative production of LA (entries 1–10). Xu et al. reported the use of small amounts of Lewis-acidic AlCl3 instead of bases, in combination with an AuPd/TiO2 catalyst.134 Still, fairly low LA yields were obtained (48%, entry 11) and no method to recover the homogeneous AlCl3 was proposed. A few additive-free catalytic processes have nevertheless been proposed as well. For example, solid base catalysts such as Na2SiO3135 and CaO136–138 were able to produce LA from GLC without any additives, but both processes require high temperatures (290–300 °C) and large amounts of catalyst (entries 12 and 13), which often require significant efforts to regenerate136 and might also dissolve under the applied reaction conditions. The need for bases may further be circumvented by a bifunctional catalyst containing a metal oxidation site for GLC oxidation and Lewis acid sites for further converting the resulting trioses to LA or MLA by catalysing the final 1,2-H-shift instead of a base-catalysed benzilic acid-type rearrangement. In this regard, Komanoya et al. recently proposed the use of Pt supported on Lewis-acidic TiO2, yielding 55% of LA after 18 h at 150 °C (entry 14).139 Slightly higher yields may be obtained by a Pt/Sn-MFI catalyst, but long reaction times (24 h) are required to obtain a satisfactory yield (entry 15).140 Pt/Sn-MFI performed better than Pt/Sn-beta, which was attributed to changes in the hydrophobicity of the support's surface. Unfortunately, the catalyst activity significantly decreased when used consecutively. Purushothaman et al. reported similar yields by using an Au/USY catalyst (entry 16) in methanol, yielding MLA.141 Shorter reaction times were possible compared to Sn-MFI (10 h), although higher temperatures were used (160 °C). The catalyst seemed robust, giving similar results when reused, but only one consecutive run was tested in batch mode. Recently, a new class of superior catalysts was reported by Tao et al., viz. carbon-supported heteropolyacids (HPA) or unsupported polyoxometalates (entries 17–19).142–144

High yields (up to 93%) could be obtained with a silver-exchanged phosphomolybdic acid (Ag3PMo12O40) under very mild conditions viz. after 5 h at only 60 °C. The efficiency of the catalyst was attributed to the generation of strong Lewis acid sites (Ag), enhanced redox potentials for GLC oxidation (of the heteropolyanion) and water-tolerance.144 Similar yields could be obtained from crude GLC (containing 28 wt% of methanol and minor organic admixtures) under the same conditions, indicating that purified GLC streams are not necessary. Even neat GLC (without solvent) could be converted, though with lower yields (54%) after 24 h.144 Moreover, no leaching (or dissolution) of the Ag3PMo12O40 catalyst was observed and the catalyst could be reused for 12 consecutive runs without a significant decrease in activity. However, it should be noted that the reusability was tested in batch-mode at full conversion and thus deactivation could have been obscured. Very recently, the same authors proposed a new type of catalyst, viz. HPAs embedded in a lipid bilayer which is covalently bonded to a graphene oxide support (H3PMo12O40@lipid/GO, entry 20).155 The lipid bilayer is produced by coupling the surface carboxylic groups of COOH-functionalized graphene oxide with a diamine, forming a covalently-linked GO-NH2 monolayer. Then, functionalizing the monolayer with 1-bromodecane and loading of the HPA forms a lipid-like bilayer through self-assembly. The high efficiency of the catalyst (90% yield after 3.5 h at 60 °C) was attributed to the formation of a capillary-like wall around the HPAs, which enhances the adsorption of GLC and O2 around the catalytic sites. Comparable results could be obtained with crude GLC (87% LA yield at similar conditions). The catalysts are resistant to environmental changes (pH, temperature) and could be reused up to 15 times with minor HPA leaching (8 wt% of the initial amount).
In summary, GLC could provide a significant source for LA production as an alternative to edible carbohydrates. The design of bifunctional catalysts that do not require additional bases could be considered the greatest progress in GLC-to-LA conversion of the past years. High yields of LA can already be obtained under industrially relevant conditions, even from crude or solvent-free GLC streams. Similar to LA from carbohydrates, the separation of the chiral LA stream remains a focal point for future research. Moreover, the oxidation components of most catalysts are still (expensive) noble metals and thus, cheaper alternatives should be envisioned. Furthermore, some catalysts are considered robust, but their stability has often been assessed at high conversion in batch-mode, which may obscure any true deactivation. Nevertheless, the conversion of GLC to LA does not need to be a one-step process but may consist of two individual reaction steps, viz. first the oxidation of GLC to DHA, followed by its subsequent conversion to LA or alkyl lactates in a different unit. In this regard, the group of Pérez-Ramírez et al. recently performed an economic and environmental assessment of LA production from GLC by coupling the biocatalytic production of DHA from GLC to its subsequent conversion to LA by a Sn-MFI catalyst.156 In terms of cumulative energy demand, this coupled process is only marginally better than the industrial fermentative production of LA from carbohydrates, but operating costs are predicted to be 30% less, suggesting that LA production from GLC can be an economically viable alternative to carbohydrate fermentation. A year later, a similar assessment was made of the oxidation of GLC to DHA using iron-containing zeolite catalysts.157 This study proposed that the chemocatalytic oxidation of GLC to DHA was environmentally more benign than the biocatalytic route used in the former study as a decrease up to 70 and 50% was expected for CO2 emissions and energy consumption, respectively. Thus, altogether, this suggests that the combination of GLC oxidation by Fe-zeolites and LA synthesis by Sn-MFI could decrease operating costs for LA production by 65% compared to conventional glucose fermentation.
Lactide
Compared to LA or alkyl lactates, the use of heterogeneous catalysis for the production of LD, the direct building block of PLA, has been investigated far less. Nevertheless, LD synthesis currently comprises approx. 30% of the total production cost of PLA5 and thus, challenges to design more efficient routes towards LD remain. A recent, more detailed review on the state-of-the-art of LD synthesis may be found elsewhere25 but generally, LD is produced by a two-step process. First, a disperse prepolymer (LxA) is made from aqueous LA by the removal of water, which is then converted to LD by a so-called backbiting reaction in a second step. The latter is catalysed by homogeneous (mainly Sn-based) catalysts, which are not recovered in the process (Fig. 3A).25,31,34 Both steps are performed at high temperatures (180–250 °C) under vacuum to aid continuous water or LD removal. A moderate selectivity towards L-LD (60–70%) is obtained, mainly due to the unwanted racemization of LD and the formation of residual polymeric waste, resulting in an energy-intensive process that requires strenuous recycling and down-stream purification.34,158 Recently, a new, one-step process was proposed based on shape-selective zeolite catalysis.159 Here, an aqueous L-LA solution is added to an immiscible organic solvent (e.g. o-xylene) containing a H-beta zeolite. The solution is kept under reflux and water is continuously removed from the reaction solution by a condenser with a return of the light-phase device (Fig. 3B). Compared to other soluble or non- or mesoporous solid Brønsted acids, the production of LD is favoured over large LA oligomers within the confined space of the pores of the beta-zeolite. Yields up to 83% could be obtained at 144 °C, with an LD productivity of >250 g liter−1 h−1. Interestingly, the process is devoid of racemization, giving a +99% L-LD stereoselectivity when the feed is L-LA. Moreover, LD separation was proven to be straightforward by extraction and the catalyst was stable over 6 runs, though intermediate calcination was used before each run, which might obscure any coking effects. Although this process greatly simplifies LD synthesis, it does require the use of organic solvents that are continuously kept under reflux during the reaction. The energy requirements needed for this should definitely be assessed. Alternatively, the use of solvents can be avoided by producing LD catalytically from LA in the vapour phase (Fig. 3C). A few patents have been disclosed by Dupont,160 BioPak Technology161 and Uhde Inventa-Fischer162 discussing the vapour phase conversion of LA over a fixed catalyst bed. Proposed catalysts include SnO/C, various metal oxides, SiO2–Al2O3, γ-Al2O3 and various zeolites. Examples are sometimes scarce,160 but LD yields up to 40–44% have been reported using Al2O3-based catalysts at 220–240 °C at either 1 atm161 or 150 mbar.162 Slightly lower LD racemization is expected for gas-phase processes.25 Recently, the use of an SnO2–SiO2 nanocomposite catalyst was proposed.163,164 High yields up to 94% could be obtained (240 °C, 1 atm, WHSV = 1 h−1), with only minor racemization (±2%). Moreover, the catalyst was shown to be stable up to 2500 h on stream. However, diluted LA streams were used (±1.6 vol% LA in N2), resulting in low productivities (<1 gLD gcatalyst h−1). The use of a more concentrated vapour phase was not reported. The main disadvantage of vapour phase processes for LD formation is the need for a diluted aqueous LA feedstock due to the spontaneous oligomerization of concentrated LA solutions.165 At higher LA concentrations in the vapour, water initially present in the LA feedstock might impede the dehydration reaction towards LD. Similarly, autocatalytic side-reactions due to the acid group might become an issue. These issues could potentially be circumvented, e.g. by using esters of LA as feedstock, though such a process has not yet been reported in the heterogeneous gas-phase form. A competing reaction there would be the dehydration to acrylates.166–168 One patent already described the production of LD directly from alkyl lactates, though in the liquid phase using homogeneous Ti-based catalysts.169

Glycolic acid and other functional α-hydroxy acids or esters
Glycolic acid
Compared to LA, the catalytic production of glycolic acid (GLA) from renewable resources has been studied to a lesser extent, despite its similar chemical structure. As a two-carbon α-hydroxy acid, GLA finds its use in the production of polyglycolic acid (PGA) or copolymers with LA. Being biodegradable and biocompatible, PGA-based plastics primarily find applications as packaging materials (films, containers, cups, etc.) or in medicine (e.g. for tissue and bone engineering or controlled drug release). PGA can be produced by a controlled ROP of glycolide (the cyclic dimer of GLA), similar to PLA production.170,171 GLA is mainly produced by the carbonylation of formaldehyde (usually as an intermediate towards ethylene glycol) or by reacting chloroacetic acid with NaOH.172 Fermentative routes are currently being explored as well.173,174
Only a few groups have attempted the catalytic production of GLA from renewable resources (Table 3). The oxidation of GLC has been proposed using Au-based catalysts or Nb2O5, but only mediocre GLA yields were obtained (entries 1–3).175–177 Homogeneous or heterogeneous bases were required, forming the glycolate anion (and thus salts) as a product. Reactor corrosion and/or separation of the product will likely cause issues here. Moreover, the reaction pathway proceeds by the decarboxylation of tartronic acid, thus resulting in carbon loss. Dapsens et al. proposed valorising glyoxal (GLX), a significant by-product of pyrolytic bio-oils, to GLA using a 1,2-H-shift reaction, similar to the production of LA from PAL (vide supra).178 For this, galliated USY zeolites and different Sn-MFI catalysts were tested, all giving a GLA selectivity ≥94% with no detectable by-products (entries 4–6). Hydrothermally prepared Sn-MFI was slightly more active than when prepared through alkaline assisted stannation. A continuous-flow experiment demonstrated the stability of the Sn-MFI catalyst, with no observable decrease in conversion after 8 h on stream. Higher GLX concentrations (up to 20 wt%) could be used as well, giving 81% GLA yield after 18 h at 100 °C. The reaction could also be performed in alcohols, giving alkyl glycolates as products with high selectivity (≥95%) using the same Sn-MFI catalyst. This approach is exemplary of the bio-refinery concept, wherein the co-generation of valuable chemicals could render biofuel production more economical/sustainable in the future.

The direct production of GLA from cellulose and even raw biomass has also been proposed. For example by using a (homogeneous) Mo-based HPA, GLA yields of 49 and 32% could be obtained from α-cellulose or dried bagasse/hay, respectively (entries 7 & 10).179 GLA results from the oxidation of the intermediary GA, generated in situ by the retro-aldol reaction of carbohydrates released from the cellulose by hydrolysis. The homogeneous HPA could be reused up to 9 times (measured at high conversions), but recuperation of the catalyst is difficult and requires multiple energy-intensive steps (solvent evaporation, esterification of acids and decomposing residual solid material). Very recently, a heterogeneous WOx + CMK-3 or W2C/CMK-3 catalyst system was proposed for the production of methyl glycolate (MGLC) directly from cellulose or dried birch/Miscanthus in methanol (entries 8, 9 & 11).180 Relatively high MGLC yields could be obtained, viz. 58% from cellulose and 49% for raw Miscanthus after 2 h at 240 °C. A similar reaction mechanism based on intermediary GA was proposed. The active phase is believed to be poorly crystallized, large-surface-area WO3 and WOx species (generated in situ from W2C), either by low-coordination W-sites or by forming dissolved WOx species. Unfortunately, significant leaching of tungsten species occurred (50% of initial W) after 8 runs on cellulose and the poorly crystallized WOx or WO3 becomes highly crystallized, which leads to a significant activity decrease. Finally, the conversion of cellulose to GLA using a zinc-stabilized Fenton-reaction has also been proposed, but involves UV-radiation rather than catalysis.181
Functional α-hydroxy acids
One particular advantage of (heterogeneous) chemical catalytic routes towards bio-based monomers is the possibility of obtaining new molecules that could otherwise not be obtained by classic fermentation, e.g. by higher temperatures. In this context, new LA-like molecules were recently discovered as a side-product when exploring the catalytic conversion of carbohydrates to LA or alkyl lactates, viz. methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) and methyl-4-methoxy-2-hydroxybutanoate (MMHB).23,65 Their structure is similar to LA (and could thus be used as a building block for polyesters) with the exception that they contain a terminal vinyl or methoxy group, respectively. Their origin was attributed to tetroses and glycolaldehyde (GA), obtained by the retro-aldol reaction of glucose, similar to the retro-aldol scission of fructose to trioses (vide supra) (Scheme 4A). In the original report, MVG yields up to 11% were obtained during the conversion of sucrose with Sn-beta in methanol at 160 °C (20 h).23 Mechanistically, the formation of MVG and MMHB from tetroses is similar to that of alkyl lactates from trioses. First, the tetroses are likely dehydrated twice and methanol is added to the terminal aldehyde group, after which a 1,2-H-shift transforms the hemiacetal to the final ester.182 The selectivity of both products is determined by whether a methanol (1,4-) addition occurs on the terminal vinyl group prior to the 1,2-H-shift. Both esters may also be derived from the two-carbon molecule GA by homogeneous SnCl4·5H2O183 or Sn-beta,88 as Sn is known to efficiently catalyse aldol reactions between carbohydrates.184–186 MMHB is the main product when tetroses or GA are converted using a homogeneous SnCl4·5H2O catalyst, yielding up to 58% MMHB and only 1–4% MVG at 90 °C using 5–10 mol% of catalyst.182,183 In contrast, Holm et al. reported that MVG was the main product when GA or tetroses were converted using a Sn-beta catalyst at 160 °C, yielding up to 56% MVG from tetroses.23,88 This selectivity shift was further elucidated by De Clercq et al., who investigated different Sn-containing catalysts for the conversion of tetroses to MMHB and MVG.187 Homogeneous and mesoporous catalysts stimulated the formation of MMHB. However, a strong selectivity shift towards MVG was observed when microporous catalysts were used at higher reaction temperatures (e.g. MVG yields up to 50% after 1 h at 160 °C). This drastic change was attributed to confinement effects of the transition states within the pores of the zeolite. Later, Tolborg et al. also observed a shape-selective effect in the aldol reaction of GA to tetroses in water.188 Sn-MFI was highly selective towards tetroses (aldol condensation), whereas Sn-beta or mesoporous stannosilicates tended to form hexoses as well. Further conversion of the intermediary tetroses yielded up to 44% vinyl glycolic acid (acid form of MVG) after 4.5 h at 100 °C from GA using Sn-MFI in water.188

Looking at the molecular structure of both molecules, MVG is more interesting than MMHB due to the presence of a terminal vinyl bond. When used as a polyester building block, this vinyl bond could allow further modification and thus tunable polymer properties. Such a proof of concept was already demonstrated by Dusselier et al., who incorporated up to 12% vinyl glycolic acid in a PLA backbone (by hydrolysis of MVG and polycondensation with LA).183 The incorporated vinyl group remained reactive, rendering further functionalization by e.g. the addition of thiols, possible. This way, the hydrophilicity of the PLA was successfully modified by the addition of thioglycerol to the vinyl groups. The terminal vinyl group of MVG further allows modification by e.g. metathesis, as recently demonstrated by two individual research groups.189,190 Homometathesis of MVG proceeds smoothly by a second-generation Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst, yielding up to 96% of dimethyl-2,5-dihydroxy-3-hexenedioate (DDHD) after 30′ at 35 °C using 0.25 mol% catalyst in the absence of solvents. Hydrolysis of DDHD produces an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, which can be used as a crosslinking agent in e.g. PLA or as a building block for new polyamides, as already successfully demonstrated.189 Very recently, it was reported that pentoses and hexoses can undergo reactions in methanol similar to that of tetroses towards MVG and MMHB, resulting in 2,5-dihydroxy-3-pentenoic acid methyl ester (DPM) and trans-2,5,6-trihydroxy-3-hexenoic acid methyl ester (THM), respectively (Scheme 4B).191,192 In water, similar hydroxyl-rich acids can be formed.193 Logically, lower maximum yields have been reported (33 and 18% for DPM and THM, respectively) due to the increasing complexity and reactivity of the molecules. Slightly higher yields (of their ethyl analogues) could be obtained in ethanol.194 It is proposed that THM and DPM can be used as unsaturated polyester building blocks. The enzymatic polymerization of DPM with ethyl-6-hydroxyhexanoate and subsequent functionalization of the α-hydroxy or the vinyl group has been demonstrated.191 Despite positive proof of concepts, applications of functional α-hydroxy esters such as MVG are still limited, mainly because of the rare (and expensive) nature of the starting carbohydrates (e.g. tetroses or glycolaldehyde).195 Employing these esters for commodity applications will thus be challenging, but might be useful for high-value and specialty applications (e.g. medicine). For example, the valorisation of MVG as a high-value side product from the catalytic production of MLA from carbohydrates might contribute to the overall economic viability of the process. Alternatively, short-chain carbohydrates are often found as by-products in pyrolytic bio-oils. Nevertheless, more extensive research is first needed to further demonstrate the potential of these functional esters as polymer building blocks. For example, it is questionable whether producing such functional polymers with high-molecular weights (e.g. by functional lactides159) will be possible.
2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid
Although omitted from the US Department of Energy's original report,196 furans were included as a top chemical opportunity from biorefinery carbohydrates in the revised report in 2010.27 More specifically, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are considered versatile platform chemicals in a future bio-refinery for a broad range of products, especially since the intrinsic functionality of carbohydrates is well preserved within these molecules.14 Of these, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in particular has received considerable attention, as this aromatic di-acid may substitute oil-based terephthalic acid for the production of polyesters, e.g. with biobased ethylene glycol.197–199 Indeed, polyethylene furanoate (PEF) is considered a 100% biobased alternative for PET. Replacing PET by PEF is estimated to decrease energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions by 43–51 and 46–54%, respectively.200 Moreover, PEF exhibits improved barrier properties (especially with respect to oxygen permeability) and has a higher Tg than PET.201 However, the mechanical strength of PEF is much lower than PET due to the lack of the aromatic ring in PEF.202 Although not yet commercialized, pilot-scale production of PEF is underway.203 Commercial-scale PEF production is foreseen by 2021, but the first commercial PEF bottles are expected to be available at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.204
Generally, FDCA can be obtained by the oxidation of HMF, which is in turn produced from a triple dehydration of hexoses (Scheme 5). The production of HMF from hexoses has been extensively reviewed elsewhere205–209 and falls outside the scope of this review but it is worth noting that a lot of heterogeneous catalysts have been tried there. Most reports on FDCA synthesis start from HMF, though in a few studies hexoses were used as feedstock. Zhang et al. already recently reviewed the catalytic production of FDCA from HMF in detail, with tabulated comparisons.210 Hence, only more general trends and prospects will be highlighted here. The oxidation of HMF to FDCA may proceed through two different catalytic pathways, depending on the catalyst. Both the hydroxyl or the carbonyl group may be oxidized first, forming 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) or 5-hydroxymethylfuran-2-carboxylic acid (HMFCA), respectively. Further oxidation leads to 5-formylfuran-2-carboxylic acid (FFCA), the final precursor to FDCA (Scheme 6). Chemically, the oxidation of HMF to FDCA is similar to the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid. The latter is performed by the Amoco Mid-Century (AMC) process, in which p-xylene is oxidized by a combination of homogeneous Co/Mn/Br catalysts in acetic acid at 200 °C and 15–30 bar of pressure.211 Terephthalic acid then precipitates from the reaction, with molar yields up to 95%. Applied to HMF oxidation, lower yields (± 60%) are typically obtained due to higher reactivity of the furan ring and substituted functional groups compared to p-xylene.212–214 Better results were recently obtained by controlling the substrate addition and using CO2 as a dilutant. This way, FDCA yields up to 90% could be obtained at 180 °C and 30 bars of pressure.215 The main disadvantages of the AMC process include substrate burning to CO2 and the risk of runaway reactions by using organic solvents together with high pressures of O2. Hence, different heterogeneous catalysts have been investigated as well, typically based on noble metals such as Pt,216–226 Pd,225,227–232 Ru233–235 and Au225,236–243 on various supports (tabulated overviews are available elsewhere210). Although even quantitative FDCA yields are often presented, a major drawback of most of these processes is the use of (over)stoichiometric amount of bases. Because of the low solubility of FDCA in many solvents,244 bases are required to dissolve FDCA as a salt and to avoid precipitation on the catalyst, leading to blocking and deactivation of the active metal sites. Often 2–4 equivalents of base are used which, in the case of a 5 wt% HMF solution and NaOH as base, would result in very corrosive pH values of ≥13. Moreover, the isolation of FDCA requires subsequent acidification, forming stoichiometric amounts of salts as waste.

 Scheme 6  Different catalytic pathways for HMF oxidation to FDCA. 
Base-free methods have also been reported for a few Pt-,245–247 Pd-,248 Au-249,250 and Ru-based233,234,251 catalysts, often with a solid, basic material as support. In this case, it should be avoided that the basic support (partly) dissolves, which would make the mixture alkaline (e.g. for MgO or hydrotalcite).233,246 On the other hand, very dilute HMF feeds are usually used in base-free methods to avoid product precipitation and catalyst inhibition. The upper limit of HMF concentration in neutral aqueous feeds has been estimated at 1 wt%.219 Han et al. showed that using 2.5 wt% HMF in water, FDCA yields up to 75% could be obtained in the absence of bases using a Pt/C–O–Mg catalyst after 24 h at 130 °C and 20 bars of O2. However, precipitated FDCA was isolated by adding NaOH, separating the catalyst from the solution and adding HCl to precipitate FDCA again, rendering the avoidance of base rather ineffective.246 Very recently, Mishra et al. proposed a Ru/MnCo2O4 catalyst for HMF oxidation to FDCA in the absence of a base.252 Yields up to 99% were obtained at a high productivity of 5.15 gFDCA gcatalyst h−1 (after 10 h at 120 °C and 24 bar air pressure) with no report of precipitated FDCA after reaction, though a HMF concentration of 1.3 wt% was used as feedstock. Aside from these issues, the use of noble metals is expensive and noble metal-free catalysts should ideally be preferred. Already reported catalysts include polymeric Fe3+/porphyrin,253 Merrifield resin-supported Co2+-porphyrin,254 Li2CoMn3O8,255 nano-Fe3O4–CoOx,256 pyrolyzed CoxOy,257 MnxFey mixed oxides,258 ZIF-8-derived nanoporous carbon,259 MnOx–CeOx260 and MnO2.261 Still, there are some key deficiencies in these methods, such as being less selective towards FDCA compared to noble metal-based catalysts, long reaction times, being carried out in organic solvents such as acetic acid or using t-BuOOH as oxidant. The best results without noble metals were perhaps recently obtained using MnO2-based catalysts. FDCA yields up to 91% could be accomplished after 6–24 h at 100–110 °C and 10–20 bar O2. However, again 2–3 eq. of bases (NaHCO3 or KHCO3) were used together with very dilute HMF feeds (0.5–0.63 wt%).260,261
Since HMF is an expensive feedstock, a few studies have been performed on the direct conversion of carbohydrates to FDCA as well. However, a few fair challenges are involved due to the different catalytic sites required for sugar dehydration and oxidation, respectively. The main problem of the direct conversion of carbohydrates into FDCA is the simultaneous oxidation of the sugars.210 In 2000, Kröger et al. used a two phase system based on water and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), separated by a membrane.262 Fructose dehydration occurs in the water phase by a Lewatic SPC 108 as solid acid catalysts, after which HMF is extracted in the MIBK phase, where it is oxidized to FDCA by a PtBi/C catalyst. Sadly, this process only yielded 25% FDCA. Co(acac)3 encapsulated in sol-silica yielded up to 72% FDCA directly from fructose in water after 65 minutes at 160 °C and 20 bar O2.263 Despite a high FDCA selectivity (>99%), a lot of catalyst (50 wt% compared to fructose) was required to achieve satisfactory conversions. Because of the complexity of a one-pot conversion of sugars to FDCA, two-step methods based on intermediate HMF extraction or catalyst separation by magnets have also been proposed. Yi et al. managed to obtain an overall 83% FDCA yield by combining fructose dehydration in isopropanol with water extraction of HMF out of the crude product mixture and subsequent oxidation of the aqueous HMF with an Au8Pd2/HT catalyst.264 The same group later proposed a triphasic system, wherein the sugar dehydration and HMF oxidation phases were separated by an MIBK organic phase which serves as a HMF transport bridge. A maximum overall FDCA yield of 78% could be obtained, but the complexity of the system definitely raises questions about its industrial viability.265 Two-step methods for direct fructose conversion to FDCA based on intermediate separation of the magnetically active catalyst have also been proposed.256,266 FDCA yields up to 60–70% were achieved, but reactions were performed in DMSO using t-BuOOH as an oxidant. The consumption of an oxidant and difficult separation of HMF from the high-boiling DMSO will likely render such a process economically unviable at a larger scale.
Despite significant progress over the past years in the catalytic production of FDCA, it must be noted that most of these processes still suffer major drawbacks which may render future economic process unviable.13 More specifically, the use of excess bases would lead to a tremendous amount of salt waste during FDCA isolation, aside from reactor corrosion. Base-free processes on the other hand require very dilute HMF feeds to avoid FDCA precipitation, making water separation a costly step. With noble metal-free catalysts, the same hurdles should be overcome, among others. The need for bases or FDCA precipitation may be circumvented by performing the oxidation in alcoholic media, forming not the acid but the dimethyl ester of FDCA, viz. furan-2,5-dimethylcarboxylate (FDMC). This way, using an Au/TiO2267 (130 °C, 4 bar O2, 3 h) or Au/CeO2268 catalyst (130 °C, 10 bar bubbled O2, 5 h) quantitative yields of FDMC may also be obtained. FDMC can easily be purified by sublimation at standard pressure and 160 °C, but one must pay attention to the fact that the oxidation of methanol is prevented or minimized. For the Au/CeO2 catalyst, no gold leaching was detected, but a decrease in reaction rate was observed upon reuse of the catalyst due to the adsorption of organic compounds. Although not yet on point, the approach to produce FDCA esters in alcohols might be a promising alternative, similar to the production of LA esters instead of LA. Additionally, the use of FDMC might even be more interesting as a polymer building block for PEF than FDCA. Indeed, PEF is usually produced by a 2-stage melt polymerization, wherein the first step consists of a (trans)esterification reaction of FDCA or FDMC with ethylene glycol, which would release water or methanol, respectively. The lower boiling point of methanol would make its removal easier compared to water.197 Moreover, Gruter et al. reported that the direct use of FDCA gave rise to colored PEF, in contrast to FDMC.269 Because of the complexity of the direct or two-step conversion of carbohydrates to FDCA, the results reported until now do not seem satisfactory and their industrial viability should be checked, before any upscaling is envisioned. Of course, processes for FDCA production are not limited to heterogeneous catalysts. The low solubility of FDCA could be administered to precipitate and filter FDCA from the reaction medium containing a homogeneous catalyst. Such a process seems economically attractive270 and is essentially what happens in the AMC process. Avantium's patented technology,271 which has already been scaled to the multi-ton scale197 in Avantium's pilot plant in Geleen, the Netherlands, uses a similar strategy. Here, alkyl ethers of HMF are oxidized to FDCA or its mono-alkyl ester using a cheap homogeneous Co/Mn/Br catalyst in acetic acid. To the best of our knowledge, Avantium is currently the only company that is already producing FDCA on a larger scale. Alternatively, using HMF as a platform for bio-based terephthalic acid, e.g. by the Diels Alder reaction with ethylene, is also an option.272
Diols: ethylene glycol and isosorbide
Ethylene glycol by hydrogenolysis of cellulose
Ethylene glycol (EG) is, aside from serving as an antifreeze or coolant liquid, mainly used as a building block for polyesters. Globally, more than 58% of EG is currently used as a monomer to prepare PET.202 Its current production route is by the hydrolysis of petrochemical-derived ethylene oxide.273 The production of green EG from renewable resources would allow certain polyesters to be partially (e.g. PET) or even fully (e.g. PEF) bio-based. Looking at the scale of yearly PET consumption (estimated at 100 million tons in 2016202), the use of green EG would result in non-negligible contributions to its sustainability, even though such a PET is only partially (±30%) bio-based. Such a strategy is already being employed by the Coca Cola Company for its PlantBottle packaging (30% bio-based PET). Currently, bio-EG is primarily produced from fermentative bio-ethanol, which is dehydrated to ethylene and converted to EG according to the conventional petrochemical process.202
However, the main disadvantages of this process are (i) the high cost of ethanol feedstock compared to fossil ethylene, (ii) its multi-step nature (by de- and re-functionalizing, thus not using the initial functionalities of the intrinsic biomass14) and (iii) its dependency on edible carbohydrate feedstocks. In the past decade, many publications have emerged, primarily by the group of Zhang, that describe a new strategy for the direct production of EG by converting (ligno-)cellulosic feedstocks directly to EG using appropriate heterogeneous catalysts.
A key report was published in 2008, wherein the direct conversion of cellulose to EG was reported for the first time using nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts supported on activated carbon (Ni-W2C/AC).274 An EG yield of up to 61% could be obtained after 30 minutes at 245 °C using a 1 wt% aqueous cellulose solution and 30 wt% catalyst (relative to cellulose) under 60 bars of H2 pressure. The following years, the EG yield could even be increased up to 75% under similar conditions by using different supports with a better pore structure.275,276 It is generally accepted that EG is produced by the hydrogenation of GA, which is produced in situ by a retro-aldol reaction of glucose or tetroses, rather than by the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol (Scheme 7).202,277 Prior to this, glucose or oligosaccharides are slowly released from cellulose by hydrolysis. EG might also originate directly from the (slower) retro-aldol reaction of the reducing end in cellobiose or celloligosaccharides in general.278,279 Higher EG yields can be obtained from cellobiose than from glucose, probably due to slower release of GA and glucose in the reaction medium, leading to less side reactions. Because of the multi-step nature of the cellulose-to-EG cascade (hydrolysis, retro-aldol and hydrogenation), different catalytic sites should be present simultaneously. Purely heterogeneous systems combining a retro-aldol active species with a hydrogenation component have mainly focused on group VI species as the retro-aldol compound, in particular tungsten, as they afford the highest EG yield in cellulose conversion to date.280 In addition to the tungsten carbides mentioned previously, tungsten phosphide281 and (bi)metallic tungsten catalysts282 have been proposed as well. The hydrogenation component may be the tungsten species itself (e.g. W2C is known to show platinum-like behavior283), or any conventional hydrogenation metal such as Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, Ru or Cu. To the best of our knowledge, the highest EG yields directly from cellulose (70–75%) using purely heterogeneous systems were obtained by a Ni-WO3/SBA-15 catalyst (230 °C, 60 bar H2, 6 h),284,285 by WCx supported on a 3D mesoporous carbon (245 °C, 60 bar H2, 30′)276 or by Ni-W/SBA-15282 (245 °C, 60 bar H2, 30′). According to Wang et al., an EG yield of 75% is probably very close to the maximum yield that can be obtained under such reaction conditions considering that some side reactions (e.g. to other polyols) cannot be avoided.277 Unfortunately, the reusability of these catalysts was limited due to collapse of the SBA-15 support or (partial) oxidation of the WCx phase to form WOx. A different strategy is to use a (partially) homogeneous retro-aldol catalyst with a heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst as exemplified by Tai et al., who reported the use of tungstic acid (H2WO4), with Ru/C286 or RANEY® Ni.287 Under reaction conditions, the solid tungstic acid transforms to soluble HxWO3, which is considered the true catalytically active species In contrast, Cao et al. proposed that the true active tungsten species is not HxWO3, but partly reduced WO3.285 Upon cooling and exposure to air, the dissolved HxWO3 re-oxidizes to H2WO4 and precipitates as a solid. This phase-transfer strategy combines the high efficiency of a homogeneous catalyst with an easy separation and recovery of a heterogeneous catalyst, and it yielded up to 58 and 65% of EG, respectively, directly from cellulose (245 °C, 60 bar H2, 30′) with excellent recyclability (up to 20 times). The recovery of H2WO4 between each run exceeded 98%. The combination of homogeneous CeCl3·7H2O or tungsten-containing HPAs with heterogeneous Pt/BaZrO2 or Ru/C, respectively, has been reported as well, but lower EG yields (40–53%) and severe catalyst deactivation were observed.288,289
 Scheme 7  Catalytic production of EG from cellulose or glucose. 
Balancing both retro-aldol sites and hydrogenation components is important to optimize the selectivity towards EG. Indeed, the retro-aldol reaction of glucose towards tetroses and GA should be favoured over the hydrogenation towards sorbitol because of the recalcitrant nature of sorbitol for further conversion. For example, Zheng et al. showed that selectivity towards EG was significantly influenced by the ratio between W and Ni (ideally, the W:Ni ratio was 3).282 Similarly, Zhao et al. found that EG yield as a function of the W:Ru ratio followed a volcano-shaped curve (maximum at W:Ru = 6–7) for glucose conversion.290 On the other hand, the isomerization of glucose to fructose should be minimized as the retro-aldol reaction of fructose leads to C3-fragments, and eventually to 1,2-propyleneglycol (1,2-PG). Glucose isomerization might be induced by the nature of the catalyst itself,291,292 or by the presence of bases or Lewis acids.280 Finally, the balance between retro-aldol and hydrogenation activity might be steered by carefully choosing the reaction temperature. Indeed, the high activation energy of the retro-aldol reaction of glucose (±∼145 kJ mol−1)87,290 and cellulose hydrolysis (130–180 kJ mol−1)293 compared to that of glucose hydrogenation (±38.1 kJ mol−1)290 is the reason why most reactions are performed at temperatures around 240–250 °C. Too low temperatures would limit retro-aldol reactions and relatively speaking favour the rate of glucose hydrogenation to the stable sorbitol. Too high temperatures however favor other side-reactions (e.g. humin formation).
All aforementioned studies used pure, commercial microcrystalline cellulose as feedstock. From an economic point of view, the use of raw lignocellulosic biomass would be more desirable. In this case however, the feed does not only contain lignin and hemicellulose which may hamper EG or diol production, but also inorganic impurities (ash). Pang et al. observed that the presence of lignin from a corn stalk feedstock had an inhibiting effect on the production of EG or diols in general, and a delignification pre-treatment step was necessary.294 A pre-treatment with H2O2 and NH3 removed 75% of the lignin and increased the diol yield (EG + 1,2-PG) from 3 to 48% (1 wt% feedstock, 245 °C, 60 bar H2, 150′). The presence of hemicellulose did not hinder the reaction but contributed to EG and 1,2-PG formation. In contrast, the lignin fraction of woody biomass (e.g. birch wood whips) seemed to inhibit EG formation to a lesser extent, yielding not only 51% EG (based on carbohydrate fraction), but also 37% phenolic products (based on lignin content) after 4 h at 235 °C under 60 bar H2.295 Pang et al. noted that inorganic impurities might decrease EG yields as well, by either (i) changing the pH of the reaction mixture or (ii) capturing tungstate ions and forming inactive tungstate salts.296 Nevertheless, with appropriate pre-treatment, EG yields up to 50% could be obtained from corn cob cellulose, which was very similar to pure cellulose with a combination of tungstic acid and RANEY® Ni catalyst (245 °C, 65 bar H2, 180′). Although promising, typically low (ligno-)cellulosic concentrations (1 wt% in H2O) and high catalyst concentrations (30 wt% relative to the feedstock) were used in all former processes. Using more concentrated feedstocks is more desirable in order to obtain more concentrated product streams, rendering product separation afterwards more economical. Miscanthus (a grass) could be converted to EG in yields up to 40%, even with a 10 wt% feedstock suspension (245 °C, 50 bar H2 2 h), if an ammonia or NaOH pretreatment was performed to remove the lignin and surface protectors.297 Xiao et al. reported the conversion of concentrated cellulose feedstocks (up to 15 wt%) with a CuCr catalyst in the presence of Ca(OH)2.298 While the total polyol yield was fairly high (72%) using 10 wt% cellulose, the catalyst was not selective towards EG (8% yield after 5 h at 245 °C, 60 bar H2). Another strategy is using highly concentrated aqueous glucose solutions (up to 50 wt%) as feedstock for fed-batch (or CSTR) operation towards EG. Although glucose solutions are currently not derived from inedible feedstocks, a few advantages are related to their use. First, the high solubility of glucose in water allows for very high feed concentrations. Therefore, higher EG/H2O concentrations may be obtained as well, facilitating product separation. Moreover, homogeneous glucose solutions are easier to handle than cellulose (e.g. for stirring). Finally, the rate-limiting cellulose-hydrolysis is avoided, allowing working at slightly milder reaction conditions. Two groups independently reported the semi-continuous conversion of concentrated glucose solutions to EG using a Ni-W2C/AC299 or ammonium metatungstate + Ru/AC290 catalyst. Gradually feeding a concentrated glucose solution to the reactor mimics cellulose hydrolysis, while simultaneously minimizing side reactions by keeping the glucose concentration in the reactor low. This way, EG yields of 66% and high volumetric productivities up to 300 gEG L−1 h−1 could be obtained.299
Up to now, bio-EG can be synthesized from biomass using four different feedstocks: ethanol, glycerol, sorbitol and sugary cellulosic biomass. Fermentative bio-ethanol may be dehydrated to ethylene, from which EG may be produced in high selectivity according to the current petrochemical process. The viability of this process will however be determined by the price of bio-ethanol which has to compete with the petrochemical ethylene. On the other hand, the catalytic production of EG directly from biomass is challenging, but nevertheless promising considering that the original functional groups of the sugars are used. Compared to cellulosic biomass, the conversion of glycerol or sorbitol is far less selective toward EG, and is thus generally not preferred.202 Different catalyst systems, most of them based on tungsten, have been reported to give high yields of EG directly from cellulose and even from raw lignocellulosic biomass. According to Zheng et al., the RANEY® Ni-tungstic acid combination seems best for industrial implementation due to low cost, good reusability and easy recycling properties.300 Nevertheless, a few focal points remain that should be considered before industrial upscaling is envisioned. Typically, low (ligno-)cellulosic concentrations (1 wt%) were used. The question remains whether using higher concentrations of a solid substrate is technically feasible, especially when impurities such as lignin or ashes are also present, and whether the catalyst remains stable. Higher EG concentrations in the product streams would facilitate product separation afterwards. This cannot be forgotten as purifying EG from water is costly. Gradually feeding concentrated glucose solutions to the reactor might be a good alternative to both impurities and low loadings, but such sugar solutions are in competition with the food industry, as no large-scale, efficient cellulose saccharification processes exist on the commercial scale. Furthermore, EG production from (ligno-)cellulose requires rather harsh reaction conditions (230–250 °C, 50–60 bar H2) and thus costly reactor design, but moreover consumes H2 in the process. Three moles of H2 are required to convert one mole of glucose to three moles of EG. The current production of H2 through steam reforming also relies on petrochemical sources and releases CO2 in the process. Unless greener routes towards H2 production (e.g. by water splitting powered by solar energy) become conventional, this should definitely be taken into account in the overall sustainable nature of the process. If the entire EG demand of 2014 (25 Mton) were to be replaced by the catalytic cellulose process, 0.8 Mton of H2 (±10 km3 at 1 bar) would be required yearly. Life cycle analyses would definitely be useful as a next step to compare different EG production routes (petrochemical, bioethanol-based and cellulose-based) and estimate production costs and environmental impact overall. Last but not the least, an issue that needs mentioning is the separation of diols. In the conventional process, EG is distilled from heavier byproducts such as diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol. In the cellulose-based process, non-negligible fractions of 1,2-PG and 1,2-butanediol generally coexist in the aqueous solution. The close boiling points of these compounds (3–10 °C) might hamper product purification through distillation.280
Isosorbide by dehydration of sorbitol
Isosorbide (1,4;3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol) is a chiral, V-shaped diol molecule consisting of two cis-fused tetrahydrofuran rings. It is the product of the double dehydration of sorbitol and is considered an ideal versatile platform chemical. For example, isosorbide derivatives have been reported as high boiling solvents, fuel additives, plasticizers and even pharmaceuticals.301 On the other hand, isosorbide is rigid, chiral and non-toxic and hence, its use as a polymer building block has received significant interest over the past years. Other isohexides (viz. isomannide and isoidide, derived from mannitol or iditol, respectively) exist as well (Fig. 4), but have only been produced on the lab scale in small quantities, mainly for research purposes. Isosorbide on the other hand is a step further down the road and is already being produced commercially due to the large availability of sorbitol. Hence, only isosorbide will be further discussed herein.

Isosorbide-based polymers (polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, etc.) have been reviewed earlier by Feng302 and Fenouillot et al.303 In short, no isosorbide-based polymers have been commercialized on a large scale yet, but it is expected that industrial applications with non-negligible fractions of isosorbide in the polymer (e.g. partial substitution of EG with isosorbide in PET) will emerge soon. Unfortunately, a critical issue of isosorbide-based polymers is the different reactivity of both hydroxyl groups. This still restricts the use of isohexides to polymers containing small fractions of isohexide, or to the synthesis of low-molecular weight polymers. The most common industrial process for isosorbide production is the dehydration of aqueous sorbitol by homogeneous mineral acids such as H2SO4, HCl and H3PO4.304,305 Of course, the use of homogeneous mineral acids imposes a few drawbacks such as reactor corrosion, the need for acid neutralization and loss of catalyst. In most cases, isosorbide is recovered with a yield of ±65%.306 Needless to say, the use of stable and recoverable heterogeneous catalysts would be an environmentally more benign solution.
Isosorbide is produced by the double cyclodehydration of sorbitol via the intermediary 1,4-anhydrosorbitol (1,4-AHSO) or 3,6-anhydrosorbitol (3,6-AHSO). If the first dehydration occurs in the 2,5- or 1,5-position, 2,5-anhydrosorbitol (2,5-AHSO) or 1,5-anhydrosorbitol (1,5-AHSO) are produced, respectively, which cannot form isosorbide but tend to lead to humins instead (Scheme 8). In most publications, the second dehydration of 1,4-AHSO to isosorbide is considered the rate-limiting step. Typically, heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts have been proposed for these dehydrations, though a few Lewis acid catalysts have been proposed as well. The dehydration of sorbitol may even occur in the absence of a catalyst, but high reaction temperatures (317 °C) are then needed to acquire moderate isosorbide yields (57%).307 If the reaction starts directly from cellulose, a hydrogenation component needs to be present as well for in situ sorbitol production. Most studies begin with sorbitol however due to the greater susceptibility of carbohydrates for dehydration or side-reactions.
 Scheme 8  Reaction pathway for the production of isosorbide from sorbitol or cellulose. 
Three different strategies have been employed for isosorbide production from sorbitol, based on heterogeneous catalysis: (i) continuous gas-phase reaction, (ii) solvent-free liquid-phase conversion and (iii) sorbitol conversion in solvents (usually water). Most catalysts reported for gas-phase dehydrations of sorbitol are based on phosphorus, e.g. metal phosphates,308 phosphated Nb2O5309 and supported tungstophosphoric acids,310 but also sulfur, e.g. sulphated metal oxides.311 The best results were obtained with the sulphated copper oxide (CuSO): an isosorbide selectivity of 67% could be obtained at 99.7% conversion (10 wt% sorbitol feedstock, 1.5 g catalyst, feedstock flow rate = 3.6 ml h−1, N2 flow rate = 30 ml min−1, 200 °C, 1 atm). However, no comment was made on the stability of the catalyst. Because of the high boiling point of sorbitol, relatively high reaction temperatures (200–300 °C) are used in gas phase reactions compared to liquid-phase conversions. Another disadvantage of the gas-phase processes is that the sorbitol feed has to be diluted (typically, 10 wt% aqueous sorbitol solutions were used), resulting in low weight hourly space velocities (WHSV < 1 h−1). This also means that 90 wt% of the feed is water that does not participate in the reaction, but still requires energy for vaporization and might cause catalyst deactivation.
Sorbitol may also be converted as a pure molten liquid in the absence of any solvent, or as an aqueous solution. To a lesser extent, the use of ionic liquids as solvents has also been reported.312,313 For the solvent-free or aqueous sorbitol conversion, a multitude of different heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed, including zeolites;314–316 sulfonic acid-functionalized metal oxides,317–319 SBA-15,320 micro bead silica321 or resins,322 superhydrophobic polymer-based acid catalysts323 and tetravalent324 or trivalent325 metal phosphates. A few homogeneous catalysts have been proposed as well.326,327 Typical isosorbide yields fall within 75–88% for full sorbitol conversion, depending on the reaction conditions (usually sorbitol/catalyst weight ratio = 2.5–50 and temperatures between 120 and 210 °C). Interestingly, the surface hydrophilicity of the catalyst seems to be an important factor for catalytic activity, given the release of water. For example, the production of isosorbide was strongly dependent on the Si/Al ratios of H-β zeolites, with an optimum at Si/Al = 75.315,316 According to the authors, the more hydrophobic zeolite pores at higher Si/Al ratios are beneficial for the dehydration reaction. At too high Si/Al ratios, the acidity of the catalyst decreases, resulting in a decreased catalytic activity. Similarly, the outstanding catalytic activity of a superhydrophobic mesoporous polymer-based acid catalyst (P-SO3H) was attributed to the hydrophobicity of the surface and inside the pores.323 Very high isosorbide yields (88%) were obtained and the catalyst exhibited higher TOFs than a classic catalyst resin (amberlyst-15) or H2SO4 (140 °C, 10 h, sorbitol/catalyst = 20 (wt/wt), 0.1 bar air). Moreover, the catalyst showed better recyclability than amberlyst-15 due to the greater stability of the catalyst and less formation of coke. It is said that the hydrophobic surface quickly removes the water from the dehydration reaction, benefiting the reaction equilibrium. For propyl sulfonic-functionalized SBA-15, increasing the hydrophobicity (and simultaneously, acidity) of the surface was shown to decrease the first dehydration of sorbitol to 1,4-sorbitan, but increased the second (rate-limiting) dehydration to isosorbide, leading to an overall increase in the reaction rate.320 In contrast, Shi et al. reported that a hydrophilic surface was beneficial for isosorbide production over sulfonic acid-functionalized silica.321 Modifying the silica surface with (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane increases both the hydrophilicity and acidity of the surface. The excellent catalytic activity (84% yield at full conversion, 120 °C, 10 h, 10 mbar air, sorbitol/catalyst = 50 (wt/wt)) was attributed to the swift adsorption and desorption of the feed and product, respectively, on the catalyst surface, while simultaneously inhibiting the deposition of coke. The catalysts could be reused up to 10 times without significant decrease in isosorbide yields. The disadvantages of this catalyst are however the relatively long reaction times, batch nature, high catalyst loading and vacuum used (for H2O removal) during the reaction. A few studies have reported the use of microwaves instead of conventional heating during the solvent-free conversion of sorbitol to isosorbide with amberlyst 15 or 35.306,328 The use of microwaves increased the reaction rate by 20–34 times by decreasing the activation energy of the reaction, without affecting isosorbide selectivity (60% yield at 100% conversion, sorbitol/catalyst = 50 (wt/wt), 400 MW, 130–150 °C, 3 h).328 Moreover, heating by microwaves is significantly faster than by conventional heating and allows for a more stable temperature profile during the reaction.306 Isosorbide yields up to 70% were obtained with amberlyst 35 (sorbitol/catalyst = 13 (wt/wt), 140 °C, 5 h).
For the conversion of (ligno-)cellulose to isosorbide, an additional hydrogenation component should be present for in situ sorbitol production. The direct conversion of cellulose to isosorbide has been attempted with a combination of a homogeneous HPA (H4SiW12O40) or heterogeneous amberlyst 70 with Ru/C329,330 and with a bifunctional Ru/NbPO331 catalyst. With the former two, relatively good isosorbide yields could be obtained (52–56% at 210 °C, 1 h, 50 bar H2 or 190 °C, 16 h, 50 bar H2, respectively). However, large amounts of HPA (547 mM H+) or amberlyst 70 (e.g. 3 g for 0.324 g cellulose) were required and the catalysts lost nearly all their activity already after the first run. Moreover, a delignification step is necessary to remove the initial lignin.329 Better results were obtained with the bifunctional Ru/NbPO: similar isosorbide yields were obtained (52% after 1 h at 220 °C, 60 bar H2), but the process used less catalyst (cellulose/catalyst = 10 (wt/wt)), without additional homogeneous acids. More importantly, the catalyst showed excellent recyclability without any deactivation up to 6 runs, even with high cellulose loadings (cellulose/catalyst = 43 (wt/wt)) and without an intermediate calcination step. To increase isosorbide yields, Xi et al. reported the sequential conversion of cellulose first to sorbitol, and then to isosorbide using a Ru/NbOPO4 and a Ru-free NbOPO4 catalyst, respectively.332 Both steps were performed at different temperatures (170 and 230 °C), and the overall yield was up to 56% isosorbide (first step: 170 °C, 24 h, 40 bar H2, second step: 230 °C, 18 h, 10 bar N2). Slight deactivation by coking was observed, but initial catalytic activity could be restored by intermediary calcination. Nevertheless, both steps used a total reaction time of 42 h, which is quite lengthy, taking the cellulose loading into account (16 g L−1).
In summary, the production of isosorbide from sorbitol may well be advanced by the introduction of heterogeneous catalysis. Indeed, many suitable catalysts have been proposed that do not only outperform conventional inorganic acids (e.g. H2SO4) in terms of activity, yield and productivity, but also show good recyclability. Future applications of isosorbide as a polymer building block are however dependent on (i) the availability and durable production of sorbitol (preferably from non-food resources) and (ii) the demand for it in the polymer market (product-pull). Indeed, the different reactivity of the two alcohol groups is inconvenient as it currently limits the use of isosorbide mostly to low-MW polymers or partial incorporation of isosorbide in other polymers. Nevertheless, positive prospects (e.g. increased Tg in isosorbide-modified PET plastics) demonstrate the potential of isosorbide. Research into the direct production of isosorbide from (ligno-)cellulose is still limited, and the presence of lignin or impurities from raw feedstocks might hinder isosorbide production or induce catalyst deactivation. In this case, sequential production processes might be more suitable, but will depend on viable, green routes towards sorbitol from (ligno-)cellulose.
Crucial heterogeneous catalyst properties for selective monomer production
Heterogeneous catalysis provides a toolbox wherein the catalyst characteristics (e.g. acid/base properties, metal sites and topology/morphology) can be tuned according to the desired product. Table 4 summarizes the importance of various heterogeneous catalyst properties for the selective production of different polyester monomers from cellulose or cellulose-derived substrates, based on the preceding discussions. Clearly, Lewis acidity is of primary importance for the selective production of various α-hydroxy acids or esters from carbohydrates or other sources such as glycerol or glyoxal. Lewis acid sites can be incorporated in the catalyst structure by the isomorphic substitution of Si in zeolites or ordered mesoporous materials with a Lewis-acidic heteroatom. Sn is notably the most widely-used Lewis acid in this context because it can catalyse intramolecular 1,2-H-shift reactions, sugar isomerization and retro-aldol reactions at low temperature, and sometimes even in one pot. This explains why other heteroatoms (e.g. to catalyse retro-aldol) besides Sn are usually not necessary in these processes, unless additional redox metal sites are needed (e.g. for glycerol oxidation). Unless cellulose is used as a substrate, Brønsted acid sites are less important for these reactions since the same Sn sites (or zeolite defects) can also mildly catalyse intermediary dehydration reactions and even sucrose hydrolysis. Weak Brønsted acid sites may slightly accelerate the overall reaction rate, but should then be balanced carefully.65,85 Strong Brønsted acid sites, e.g. needed for dehydration/condensation reactions, can be incorporated on heterogeneous catalysts in various ways, e.g. by proton-balanced framework-Al in zeolites, functionalization with a P- or S-group or the use of (supported) HPAs. Reactions involving the oxidation of a hydroxyl to carbonyl group in the context of polyester formation from cellulose (usually for acid formation, e.g. lactic or glycolic acid and FDCA) generally require some form of basicity, either homo- or heterogeneous (e.g. by using a basic support material). The base may play a catalytic role, but is sometimes needed to avoid product precipitation of the acid product as well (e.g. in FDCA synthesis). However, research groups are trying more and more to avoid basicity in these reactions. Reactions involving (intermediary) oxidations or reductions require appropriate metal sites to do so. For this, usually particles of noble metals are supported on the catalyst's surface, though less conventional redox catalysts such as polyoxometalates are emerging as well. Redox metals can be combined with other catalytic sites such as Lewis acids by using bifunctional catalysts, as has been exemplified for glycerol oxidation to lactic acid. Reactions requiring the C–C splitting of carbohydrates require metal sites suitable for catalysing a retro-aldol reaction.

For the production of α-hydroxy acids or esters from carbohydrates, the same Lewis acidic Sn sites are usually used as retro-aldol catalysts as well. For ethylene glycol production on the other hand, usually tungsten-based catalysts are employed, probably due to interfering reactions of Sn with intermediary carbohydrates. Separate heterogeneous (or dissolved) retro-aldol catalysts such as MoO3 are currently being looked into as well in order to decrease the high reaction temperatures which are usually needed for the Sn- or W-catalysed retro-aldol reaction of carbohydrates.87
Even in the presence of the right catalytic sites, their catalytic efficiency may be impaired without the proper catalyst structure (e.g. topology, morphology). Multiple parameters directly depend on the catalyst structure, such as the nature of the active site itself, the catalyst's stability, mass transfer properties (e.g. pore width and crystal size), metal loadings, hydrophilicity and of course shape-selectivity. For example, isolated tetrahedral Sn sites in the framework of zeolites or ordered mesoporous materials are used to selectively produce alkyl lactates from carbohydrates. Hence, the catalyst's topology or morphology and associated synthesis procedures are generally flexible. However, the beta-topology seem to be more resistant to deactivation in alcohols due to the additional hydrophobic character of the pore channels.96 A similar effect of hydrophobicity has been observed for isosorbide production, where catalysts with a more hydrophobic surface were more efficient and sometimes also more stable. The right choice of catalyst topology/morphology is of utmost importance for reactions involving shape-selective catalysis, such as LA condensation towards LD and the production of MVG from carbohydrates. There, only microporous zeolites are able to steer the reaction towards the desired products due to shape-selective effects induced by the catalyst micropores. A different catalyst structure would not give the same results, even with comparable active sites.
Conclusions and perspectives
Although the scale at which bio-based polymers are produced is currently two orders of magnitude smaller compared to well-established petrochemical plastics, new technologies that could increase their market potential are emerging rapidly. As the largest source of renewable carbon, cellulose and carbohydrates are considered to play a prominent role in the future biorefinery-based plastic industry. The intrinsic functionality of the carbohydrates can be exploited to produce a new family of monomers containing multiple acid and/or alcohol groups, rendering them especially suitable for (new types of) polyesters. Next to biotechnology and fermentation, heterogeneous catalysis provides an entirely different (and often complementary) toolbox for the production of such monomers. Catalysis may especially be of interest for the production of PLA, as it is one of the few bio-based polymers already produced on a commercial scale. Sn-based catalysts are superior for producing alkyl lactates in alcohols from the same carbohydrates used for fermentation. Simultaneously, gypsum waste is avoided and the isolation of alkyl lactates from the product mixture seems more straightforward than LA isolation from a complex fermentation broth. The main difference between catalysis and fermentation lies in the chirality of the LA product. The catalytic production of racemic LA opens doors towards stereocomplex PLA, but efficiently separating L- and D-LA streams will be crucial for the viability of the overall process and should be a focal point of future research. The direct production of LA from raw (ligno-)cellulose has been less successful than from carbohydrates. However, surplus GLC of the biodiesel industry might serve as an alternative non-food feedstock. High yields of LA can already be obtained from GLC in the absence of bases at industrial relevant conditions, even from crude or solvent-free GLC streams. Few studies have focused on the catalytic production of LD, but emerging technologies such as the shape-selective condensation of LA using beta-zeolites or gas-phase processes are promising nonetheless. High LD yields can already be obtained swiftly in one step without racemization. These technologies definitely seem competitive to the industrial two-step process, but comparative studies on energy utilization (e.g. for solvent reflux or aqueous LA vaporization) should be made next. While catalytic routes towards PLA precursors seem underway, viable heterogeneous catalytic processes towards FDCA are a little further removed from the commercial road. Excessive amounts of bases are usually needed to avoid precipitation of FDCA on the catalyst surface and inside the pores. FDCA precipitation and bases may be avoided by producing esters of FDCA in alcohols or by adapting the AMC process for terephthalic acid production. High yields of EG can swiftly be obtained directly from cellulose with tungsten-based catalysts. However, cellulose loadings are limited and delignification pre-treatment steps are necessary. Concentrated glucose syrups might be better feedstocks, but compete with the food industry. Moreover, the cellulose-to-EG cascade requires relatively harsh reaction conditions and consumes H2. The viability of the process will severely be determined by the price of fossil ethylene. Only at high ethylene prices would the use of such harsh reaction conditions (especially H2) be justified. Whether heterogeneous catalysis will play a role in isosorbide production depends primarily on (i) the availability of cheap sorbitol and (ii) its application as a polymer building block. Currently, the use of isosorbide is mainly limited to low MW polymers or substituting minor fractions of other diols such as EG in polyesters.
Nevertheless, suitable catalysts have been proposed that do not only outperform conventional inorganic acids but also show good recyclability. From (ligno-)cellulose, sequential processes rather than direct conversions might be more suitable as the presence of lignin or impurities might hinder isosorbide production or induce catalyst deactivation.
High-potential catalysts should not only possess a high activity and product selectivity, but also be sufficiently stable. In academic literature governing catalytic biomass reactions, catalysts are often compared by the former two, while the latter is usually less focused on. Future work should be dedicated more to intensification studies (e.g. higher substrate concentrations) and the assessment of catalyst stability, especially in (continuous) liquid phase operations.122 Such studies are currently already emerging for the Sn-beta catalyst.96,97 When a catalyst is sufficiently stable, or its activity can be recovered by periodic regeneration, the use of expensive metals in catalysts (e.g. for HMF/GLC oxidation or EG production) can be justified. However, when prone to permanent deactivation (e.g. metal leaching), the use of cheap and non-toxic elements is preferred, although they are often less performing than noble metals. Bio-based polyesters are currently mostly considered as durable alternatives for packaging materials and thus have to compete economically with cheap oil-based polymers. However, they should simultaneously seek to compete in high-value and high-performance application areas.9 A higher price of bio-based alternatives can be justified if they show a unique or better performance (e.g. better barrier properties) compared to oil-based counterparts. In this regard, the valorisation of new types of (functional) polyester monomers (e.g. MVG) as a side product from catalytic LA production might be highly interesting. Similarly, the co-valorisation of by-products from pyrolytic bio-oils (e.g. GA183 or glyoxal178) to polyester monomers could increase the overall viability of a future bio-refinery.
The sustainable character of bio-based plastics is generally accepted. However, a product's sustainability is not only determined by its origin (e.g. oil or biomass) or production process, but also by its end-of-life applications. The main conventional methods to deal with polymer wastes include landfilling, incineration, mechanical recycling and, to a lesser extent, thermal depolymerisation (cracking) of polymers back to crude oil-like product mixtures (Fig. 5, top).333–336 Treating bioplastics the same way would result in a lost opportunity to further reduce raw material demands and environmental impacts. Instead, a circular economy approach, wherein polymers can be chemically recycled (e.g. by depolymerisation) or repurposed for other application would be more durable (Fig. 5, bottom).337,338 This implies a pivotal role for bio-based polyesters, since ester linkages are susceptible to controlled depolymerization (e.g. by solvolysis). For example, molecularly recycling PLA back to LD by pyrolysis is already being investigated.339,340 Chemically recyclable polymers is an emerging research area and a very recent review on this topic is available elsewhere.341 Evidently, durable end-of-life treatments of bio-plastics will be equally important as their production, origin and performance for a sustainable future plastic industry. This will not impose challenges solely on scientists and researchers, but on human society altogether.

He did his master's thesis at the Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis under the supervision of Prof. Sels, where he studied the catalytic conversion of short carbohydrates to polyester monomers. He is currently in the progress of finishing his PhD degree in the same group as an IWT-funded fellow. His research focuses on catalytic processes for bio-based polyester building blocks.
M. Dusselier	Michiel Dusselier obtained his PhD degree in Bioscience Engineering (Catalytic Technology, 2013) at KU Leuven under the guidance of Bert Sels and Pierre Jacobs, inventing new catalytic routes for bioplastics synthesis. In 2014–15, he did postdoctoral work with Mark Davis at Caltech, studying the synthesis of zeolites. He has recently been appointed as a tenure-track research professor at the Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis of KU Leuven. At the moment, he is studying zeolite synthesis methods and novel zeotype architectures, generally in the context of sustainable chemistry, gas conversion and functional bioplastics.
B. F. Sels	Bert F. Sels, currently full professor at KU Leuven, obtained his PhD degree in 2000 in the field of heterogeneous oxidation catalysis. He was awarded the DSM Chemistry Award in 2000, the Incentive Award by the Belgian Chemical Society in 2005 and the Green Chemistry Award in 2015. He is currently director of the Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis, designing heterogeneous catalysts for future challenges in industrial organic and environmental catalysis. His expertise includes heterogeneous catalysis in bio-refineries, design of hierarchical zeolites and carbons and the spectroscopic and kinetic study of active sites for small-molecule activation. He authored about 280 peer reviewed papers and filed 25 patents.
