, Accepted 27th September 2016First published on 27th September 2016AbstractCdS and CdSe quantum dots are commonly used together as co-sensitizers for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, and CdS QDs are usually deposited on TiO2 films as an intermediate layer to facilitate the subsequent deposition of CdSe QDs. A modified Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) technique with the addition of a triethanolamine (TEA) additive into a cationic precursor solution was utilized to optimize the CdS intermediate layer to enhance the performance of the obtained CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells. Due to the increased light harvesting ability as well as the improved charge separation efficiency, our solar cell with a TEA-CdS interlayer demonstrated an enhanced power conversion efficiency with an improved short-circuit current and an increased open-circuit voltage. Utilizing a newly reported counter electrode based on CuS formed on a Ti sheet, the eventual power conversion efficiency of TEA-CdS/CdSe QDSSC was further improved to as high as 5.70%.
Introduction
Due to their unique features, including size-dependent optical absorption spectra, large optical absorption coefficients, extended photostability and multiple exciton generation effect, short bandgap semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS,1–4 CdSe,5–12 CdTe,13 PbS,3,14–18 PbSe15,19–21 and Sb2S3,22–24 have been investigated for considerable applications in the fabrication of sensitized solar cells. Over the past few years, great achievements have been attained in the energy conversion efficiency of this kind of solar cell. Recently, Zhong and co-workers obtained a power conversion efficiency of 6.76% by using synthesized CdTe/CdSe QD as sensitizer, 9.40% with Mn2+ doped CdTe/CdSe QD and the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.6% with Zn–Cu–In–Se QD.25–28 Among various quantum dots for sensitized solar cells, CdS and CdSe are widely used as sensitizers. To achieve an ideal energy conversion efficiency, CdS and CdSe are commonly used together as co-sensitizers for the fabrication of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), especially for sandwich-structure solar cells.29–38 CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cells exhibit an enhanced photovoltaic performance due to the increased amount of deposited CdSe and the adjustment of the Fermi level of sensitizers which facilitate the electron injection.39–41
CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cells could be fabricated by sensitizing TiO2 films with these two kinds of quantum dots step by step. During the sensitization process, CdS quantum dots are deposited on TiO2 films as an intermediate layer, which plays an important role in the subsequent deposition of the CdSe layer, especially for the chemical bath deposition of CdSe quantum dots. As reported by Hodes et al., CdSe quantum dots could be deposited onto the TiO2/CdS films considerably faster than onto bare TiO2.31 Two approaches are commonly used for the deposition of the CdS intermediate layer: successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)14–16,39,42–44 and chemical bath deposition (CBD) methods.30,31,34,45 The SILAR technique has two advantages over the CBD method. On one hand, the SILAR deposition of the intermediate CdS layer involves the sequential adsorption and reaction of ions on the solid TiO2 surface and allows the deposition density to be controlled by optimizing the interfacial interaction between the QD precursor ions and the TiO2 surface.46 The increase in the deposition density of the intermediate layer could facilitate the growth of subsequent CdSe quantum dots deposited by the chemical bath deposition process, thus improving the solar light harvesting of the sensitizers. On the other hand, by ion doping in the precursor solution, the SILAR method enables the modification of the physiochemical properties of the intermediate layer, thus shifting the Fermi level by affecting electron accumulation within the film and boosting the performance of the solar cells.43
The CdS intermediate layer deposition on the TiO2 surface by SILAR needs two kinds of QD precursor solution, the Cd2+ cationic solution and the S2− anionic solution. Generally, these two kinds of solutions could simply use cationic Cd(NO3)2 solution and anionic Na2S solution, but this ordinary method could not fabricate an ideal CdS quantum dots adsorption on a TiO2 surface. Poor CdS QDs adsorption may affect the subsequent CdSe QDs adsorption and the photon-induced electron–hole separation, as the charge recombination is significant. These two effects could finally reduce the power conversion efficiency of solar cells. So a modification of the QD precursor solutions might cover this deficiency.
Herein, we used a modified SILAR deposition method by adding a basic triethanolamine (TEA) into the cationic solution for the CdS intermediate layer to fabricate TEA-CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized photoanodes (Scheme 1). The addition of TEA could accelerate the deposition of the CdS intermediate layer, thus suppressing charge recombination due to the reduced surface states and facilitating the subsequent deposition of CdSe QDs. The as-fabricated electrode54 demonstrated an enhanced photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 5.70%.

Experimental section
Fabrication of QD-sensitized photoelectrodes
TiO2 paste was prepared by the reported method.47,48 TiO2 paste for the transparent layer was made using pure P25 and the composite paste for the scattering layer comprised 30 wt% 200–400 nm TiO2 and 70 wt% P25. The TiO2 photoanode was composed of a transparent layer (9 μm) and a scattering layer (6 μm), coated on an FTO substrate by a successive screen printing technique. The fabricated electrodes were subsequently annealed under an airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min to eliminate organic materials in the TiO2 paste as well as to keep the TiO2 photoanode mesoporous, according to reported work.4 After cooling down to room temperature, all the electrodes were treated in 70 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 60 °C for 30 min. After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol, the dried electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and naturally cooled down to room temperature. Sensitization of the electrode involved coating with the intermediate CdS layer and then deposition of CdSe quantum dots. The intermediate CdS layer was coated by the Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method.46 The electrode was successively immersed into a cationic aqueous solution containing 1 M triethanolamine, 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2, 0.075 M manganese acetate and an anionic Na2S solution (0.1 M) for 1 min. After each immersion, the electrode was rinsed with copious water. This procedure was repeated for 10 cycles before the electrodes were dried at room temperature. For comparison, the CdS intermediate layer was also deposited by the same method by using the precursor cationic solution without TEA. To further sensitize them with CdSe quantum dots, the CdS coated electrodes were further treated by a chemical bath deposition of CdSe quantum dots. For a Se precursor solution, 80 mM Na2SeSO3 solution was synthesized by dissolving elemental Se powder in a 200 mM Na2SO3 solution. Then the Se precursor solution was mixed with 80 mM CdCl2 and 120 mM trisodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) in a volume ratio of 1:1:1. The CdS coated electrodes were immersed into the final mixture for 12 h in darkness and the deposition temperature was controlled at 20 °C with a thermostatic bath. To enhance the photovoltaic performance, a ZnS passivation layer was deposited after the sensitization with CdSe quantum dots by performing four cycles of dipping into aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.1 M Na2S for 1 min, respectively.
Solar cell assembly
PbS formed on a lead foil was used as the counter electrode. Prior to vulcanization, the lead foil was dispersed into concentrated H2SO4 solution (water:acid volume ratio 1:1) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by washing with ultrapure water and drying under N2 flow. Subsequently, the foil was immersed into a polysulfide aqueous solution composed of 1 M Na2S, 0.1 M sulfur, and 0.1 M NaOH for 24 h before being rinsed with deionized water and dried in air.42 The quantum dot-sensitized solar cell was prepared by assembling the counter electrode and a QD-sensitized photoanode using a 60 μm thick spacer with a binder clip. To achieve a high performance, we also fabricated a novel counter electrode based on CuS formed on a Ti sheet.54 A polysulfide redox electrolyte composed of 2 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl solution in methanol–water (3:7, v/v) solution was used as the electrolyte during the whole measurement.
Characterizations
UV-Vis absorption spectra of different films were recorded by a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). Photovoltaic measurement was carried out by an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660D, Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai) under a simulated solar light (a 300W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter) at room temperature. The intensity near the electrode surface was adjusted to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) with a standard Si solar cell. The photoactive area was controlled to 0.18 cm2 by a mask attached to the rear side of the photoanode. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in dark conditions at different forward biases with a frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
Results and discussions
Fig. 1a shows the cross-sectional morphology of the mesoporous electrodes after annealing. The film thickness was calculated to be 15.6 μm. It could clearly be seen that the TiO2 layer adheres to the FTO substrate tightly after heat annealing. Fig. 1b and c display the surface morphology of CdS/CdSe and TEA-CdS/CdSe quantum dots-sensitized electrodes. As can be clearly observed, the deposition process with TEA results in QDs with larger density, and no bare TiO2 particles could be detected.

It should be noted that the quantum dots anchored on the TiO2 particles tend to aggregate into clusters (Fig. 1d). Therefore, it is difficult to observe individual quantum dots on the surface of the electrode.
In order to illustrate the increased amount of CdS QDs deposited by the modified SILAR method, UV-Vis absorption spectra of the CdS QDs sensitized electrodes were measured. CdS QDs deposited by the modified SILAR method with the precursor solution containing TEA exhibited a much stronger absorption than those with the precursor solution without TEA (Fig. 2a), indicating an enhanced deposition density of the intermediate CdS layer. The increased deposition amount of the CdS QDs could be accounted for by the role of the added TEA. As a weak base, TEA could increase the basicity of the precursor solution and change the interfacial interaction between the QD precursor ions and the TiO2 surface. In a basic solution, the TiO2 surface was negatively charged, which could facilitate the adsorption of cations (Cd2+) and result in higher density of CdS QDs on the TiO2 surface.

The existence of the CdS intermediate layer was crucial to the subsequent deposition of CdSe QDs. It was found in our experiment that only a few CdSe QDs could be anchored when the bare TiO2 film was placed into a chemical bath formed by mixing the same volumes of 80 mM CdCl2, 120 mM NTA and 80 mM Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution. The increase in the deposition density of the intermediate layer could facilitate the growth of subsequent CdSe quantum dots deposited by the chemical bath deposition process. As shown in Fig. 2a, the TEA-CdS/CdSe sensitized electrode exhibited an obviously enhanced absorption in the full spectral range compared with the electrode sensitized with CdS/CdSe, indicating an increased amount of deposited QDs. To further certify this conclusion, Fig. 2b compares the absorption spectra of the CdSe QDs anchored on different films based on the sensitized TiO2 film alone, with the intermediate CdS layer as reference. It could obviously be seen that the CdSe QDs on the TEA-CdS sensitized TiO2 exhibited an increased absorption intensity compared with those on the CdS sensitized TiO2 film. The enhanced absorption intensity indicated an increased deposition amount of CdSe QDs. Therefore, the modified SILAR method for deposition of the intermediate CdS layer resulted in an increased amount of QDs on the photoanodes, allowing for more efficient harvesting of solar light.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of different electrodes, sandwich-type solar cells were fabricated by assembling the photoanodes with PbS counter electrodes formed by vulcanizing HCl-etched brass foil. Polysulfide in methanol–water solution was used as the electrolyte. Prior to the photovoltaic measurement, all sensitized electrodes were treated with a ZnS passivation layer.
For comparison, solar cells based on the photoanode only sensitized with CdS or TEA-CdS QDs were also fabricated and the corresponding photovoltaic measurement results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The CdS and TEA-CdS QD sensitized solar cells demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 1.12% and 1.70%, respectively. The higher efficiency obtained by TEA-CdS sensitized electrode could be attributed to increased QD loading as well as to improved charge separation efficiency, which we will discuss later.
The photocurrent–voltage curves and corresponding parameters of CdS/CdSe and TEA-CdS/CdSe QDSSCs are shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, respectively. The solar cell based on the CdS/CdSe photoanode registered a power conversion efficiency of 3.88%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.78 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.55 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.55. However, when the CdS intermediate layer was deposited by the TEA-assisted SILAR method, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell could increase to 4.68%, and the corresponding Jsc, Voc, and FF were 14.42 mA cm−2, 0.59 V and 0.55, respectively. The 20% increase in the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell with the TEA-CdS intermediate layer could be attributed to the enhancement of both the photocurrent and the open-circuit voltage. And this performance could remain stable after 2 hours' irradiation (Fig. S3†). As illustrated by the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 2, the TEA-assisted SILAR method for the deposition of the CdS intermediate layer facilitated the subsequent growth of CdSe QDs, resulting in an increased amount of whole QDs for sensitizing. The increased amount of QDs allowed much more efficient harvesting of photons, yielding more photo-induced electrons. Furthermore, the TEA-CdS layer exhibited an enhanced charge separation efficiency and a reduced recombination, leading to an increased density of injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. Therefore, the quasi-Fermi level would be elevated and the open-circuit voltage was also increased.49,50 With Cd(NO3)2 as the precursor, the formation of CdS QDs might be a time-consuming process. The pores formed in TiO2 film would be easily blocked and few CdS QDs could be deposited directly onto the TiO2 particles, which would lead to more surface defects and increasing charge recombination.51 The addition of TEA into the cationic precursor solution could accelerate the deposition amount of CdS QDs and increase the overall coverage of QDs around TiO2 particles, thus facilitating the charge separation. The synchronous enhancement in the light harvesting and charge separation efficiency lead to improved photocurrent generation.

The photocurrent response of different electrodes to incident light was analysed in terms of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). As seen in Fig. 3b, the IPCE spectra of different photoanodes demonstrate similar profiles to the UV-Vis absorption spectra displayed in Fig. 2a, indicating that most of the absorbed light was involved in photocurrent generation. The electrode sensitized with CdS/CdSe without TEA demonstrated the highest IPCE value of 85% at a wavelength of 400 nm, while the photoanode with the TEA-CdS layer registered an increased maximum IPCE value of 95% at the same wavelength. In the absorption range from 450 nm to 600 nm, the TEA-CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cell exhibited IPCE values around 75%, far more than that of the CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cell which displayed a peak IPCE value of no more than 70%. The improved IPCE signal indicated an enhanced photocurrent generation under the same illumination conditions. The photocurrent values calculated by integrating the IPCE curves of the two photoanodes were 14.28 mA cm−2 and 12.46 mA cm−2, respectively. To further illustrate the effect of TEA on the performance of the QDSSCs, the IPCE spectra of the solar cells sensitized only with TEA-CdS or CdS QDs were also measured (Fig. S2, ESI†) and the results showed that the TEA-CdS sensitized solar cell exhibited enhanced IPCE values in the full spectrum range. The IPCE results of different photoanodes were consistent with the J–V characteristic displayed in Fig. 3a and S1 (ESI†).
To further illustrate the significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance of the solar cell with the TEA-CdS/CdSe photoanode, Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS) of different solar cells were carried out in darkness at various biases. The measured Nyquist curves are shown in Fig. 4a and b. Z View software was employed to fit the Nyquist curves using the standard fitting model for QDSSC.52,53 The recombination resistance (Rrec) of these two solar cells obtained at different biases could be calculated according to the fitting results (Fig. 4c). As can be seen in Fig. 4b, the solar cell with the TEA-CdS/CdSe electrode exhibited a bigger Rrec, indicating a lower recombination rate than that with a traditionally prepared CdS/CdSe electrode. The higher loading of QDs on TEA-CdS/CdSe electrode could account for the reduced recombination with electrolyte, as the QDs anchored on TiO2 acted as a blocking layer.52 As a result, the TEA-CdS/CdSe electrode exhibited a more efficient charge separation process and the corresponding solar cell demonstrated an enhanced photovoltaic performance.

Optimization of the counter electrode played a pivotal role in improving the power conversion efficiency of a QDSSC. Assembling the same photoanode with different counter electrodes could result in solar cells with different levels of photovoltaic performance. To further improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs based on TEA-CdS/CdSe electrodes, a novel counter electrode based on CuS formed on a Ti sheet was utilized.54 As can be seen in Fig. 5, the solar cell demonstrated an obviously enhanced power conversion efficiency of 5.70%, with a short-circuit current of 14.39 mA cm−2, a significantly high open-circuit voltage of 0.66 V and a fill factor of 0.60.

Conclusions
In summary, a modified SILAR method by adding a basic TEA into the cationic solution was used to increase the deposition density of CdS QDs, which could further facilitate the subsequent chemical bath deposition of CdSe QDs. Due to the increased QD loading and the improved charge separation efficiency by reducing surface states, a solar cell based on a TEA-CdS/CdSe sensitized photoanode exhibited an obviously enhanced photovoltaic performance compared with using CdS/CdSe QDs as sensitizers. An outstanding power conversion efficiency of 5.70% was achieved for a solar cell assembled with a TEA-CdS/CdSe sensitized electrode and a counter electrode based on CuS formed on a Ti sheet. The power conversion efficiency obtained in our experiment was a high value for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells. Our strategy here would pave a new way for fabricating high-efficiency QDSSCs.
