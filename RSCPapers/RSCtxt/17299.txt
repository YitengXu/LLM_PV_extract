    , Accepted 6th February 2018First published on 7th February 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted enormous attention owing to their promising application in photovoltaic devices. The morphology of the perovskites is the key to driving the performance of perovskite devices, which necessitates a systematic study. In this work, two typical morphologies, i.e., flake and cube, of perovskite films are fabricated, and the temperature-dependent optical absorption and photoluminescence properties of the two types of perovskite film are systematically investigated. From the temperature-dependent spectra, both exciton and phase transition temperatures of the flake film are found to be about 10 K lower than those of the cube one. Meanwhile, the influences of the morphology on the exciton binding energy, optical phonon energy and polaron binding energy are quantitatively characterized. The exciton binding of the flake film is nearly three times smaller than that of the cube one, while the phonon coupling energy and the polaron binding energy of the former are about 5 meV and 2 meV larger than those of the latter. Furthermore, the results of photoluminescence lifetime and charge separation efficiency further reveal that the charge carrier kinetics in the two kinds of perovskite films is significantly different. The current study provides a theoretical framework to understand the fundamental physics of perovskites and to promote the design and enhancement of active materials for improved optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite has emerged as a forefront photovoltaics research topic in recent years. The power conversion efficiency of the perovskite-based solar cells has increased rapidly from 3.8% to 22%,1–4 owing to the excellent optical and electronic properties of perovskites, such as large light absorption coefficients, high carrier mobilities and long carrier diffusion lengths.5,6 Importantly, the superior ambipolar charge transport characteristic of perovskite materials further accelerates their development and applications in the field of optoelectronics, particularly for high-efficiency lasers and broadband photo detectors.7–10 Given the extensive range of their possible uses, understanding the fundamentals of charge generation, transport and recombination in perovskites is essential not only for developing high-efficiency photovoltaics, but also to fully harness the applications of hybrid perovskites in a broader context.
The morphology of perovskite films plays a key role in determining the performance of photovoltaics. Numerous studies have been performed on the optimization of the perovskite morphology to improve the performance of the device, including the optimization of fabrication methods,2,11 the use of additives,12,13 and so on.14,15 Generally, the perovskite film morphologies under current study could be divided into two types, flake perovskite and cube perovskite, which correspond to a planar device prepared using a one-step method,16,17 and a mesoporous device prepared using a two-step method,18–20 respectively. Compared with the efforts invested in the photovoltaic aspect of perovskite solar cells, there have been fewer investigations on the fundamental properties of hybrid perovskite films. Spectroscopic techniques have been the preferred methods in most of the recent studies that have provided critical insights into the photophysical properties of perovskites. Depending on the photo-excitation conditions, both bound excitons and free charges are generated in perovskites upon light illumination. The exciton binding energy of the perovskite material in the range of 20–60 meV was estimated by low-temperature absorption measurements.21–23 Optical spectroscopy analysis has shown a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic, where the transition temperature depends on the halide composition and concentration.24,25 Meanwhile, ultra-fast optical spectroscopy techniques have been utilized to address some intrinsic properties of perovskites, such as a high charge-carrier mobility of 6–66 cm2 V−1 s−126 and long-range balanced electron–hole diffusion lengths from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers depending on the fabrication conditions and the measuring techniques.27–29
Although significant improvements in the device performances have been witnessed ascribed to the enhancement of the perovskite film quality, mainly in terms of morphology optimization, the study on the two kinds of main perovskite films (flake and cube) is not systematic. There are still some unclear questions. For example, why is the classical one-step preparation of flaky perovskites commonly used in planar-structured devices, while the classical two-step preparation of cubic crystalline perovskites is commonly used in mesoporous-structured ones? What are the spectral origins and the dynamics behind them? How do optical absorption and fluorescence properties vary with temperature in the perovskite films with different morphologies? How does the morphology of perovskites influence the carrier generation, separation and recombination dynamics?
In this work, two kinds of perovskite films with the typical flake and cube morphologies have been prepared for the deep study of the fundamental properties of perovskite films. Temperature-dependent absorption and photoluminescence (PL) experiments are systematically carried out to explore the basic photophysical properties and spectroscopic properties of the perovskite films, and the exciton binding energy, optical phonon energy and polaron binding energy of each film are determined. By using the time-resolved PL spectra, the PL quenching dynamics of the films are also explored and compared. The parameters most influenced by the morphology and their effects on the device performance are illustrated.
Experimental section
Preparation of the perovskite films with different morphologies
The tested perovskite films were prepared by using modified single or sequential spin-coating methods and were denoted as flake or cube films, respectively. To obtain the flake perovskite film, CH3NH3Cl (67 mg), CH3NH3I (159 mg) and PbI2 (168 mg) were mixed in DMF (1 mL) to prepare a mixed solution. This precursor solution was spin-coated onto an ozone-plasma-treated quartz substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by thermal annealing for 30 min at 100 °C to obtain the flake perovskite film. To obtain the cube perovskite films, 1 M PbI2 in DMF was spin-coated onto an ozone-plasma-treated quartz substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by thermal annealing for 10 min at 70 °C. Then a solution of CH3NH3I (10 mg mL−1) in isopropanol (200 μL) was dropped onto the obtained light-yellow PbI2 film. After a loading time of 50 s, the residual solution was spun at 4000 rpm for 10 s. Thereafter the film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to develop a perovskite crystal and the cube perovskite film was obtained.
Characterization of the perovskite films
The morphologies of the perovskite films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL-7401F) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 instrument using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 8° to 40° at a scan rate of 2° per min.
UV-Vis absorption measurements were performed on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The temperature-dependent absorption experiments were conducted by using a cryostat (NCV30-4W, East Changing Tech Inc.), and the samples were thermostated from 97 K to 298 K.
Temperature-dependent PL measurements were carried out on an Edinburgh FLS 980 spectrofluorimeter at temperatures in the range of 78–298 K and an excitation wavelength of 510 nm, with detection in the range of 700–1100 nm. Room-temperature emissions were compared before and after the temperature scan and no change was observed, indicating no permanent damage to the tested specimens.
Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were recorded on a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh FLS 980), excited with a picosecond diode laser (EPL-470, 95 ps) and measured at 775 nm after excitation at 473 nm from the sample side.
Results and discussion
The two types of perovskite films were prepared on the quartz substrates by one-step and two-step methods, respectively, namely flake films and cube films according to the crystalline structure of the perovskites. As shown in Fig. 1, the flake film and cube film demonstrate similar morphologies to those of the perovskite active layers in the planar and mesoporous devices, respectively,10,30 with uniform crystallinity and good surface coverage. The flake perovskite film exhibits planar crystal texture from the stacking of the flaky perovskite plate (Fig. 1a), while the cube perovskite film presents a quite distinct morphology, which is composed of cubic grains with a size of ∼200 nm (Fig. 1b). To reveal clearly the crystallinity of the perovskite films with different morphologies, XRD patterns were obtained and are shown in Fig. 1c. Both perovskite films corresponding to Fig. 1a and b display strong diffraction patterns at 14.8°, 28.5° and 32.4°, which can be assigned to (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the perovskites, respectively.31 Moreover, the two films exhibit almost the same diffraction intensity ratio for the peaks of crystal planes, for example, (110)/(220), as shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), suggesting a similar crystal structure of different films.32 It could be inferred that the final products possess the same tetragonal phase ratios and domain orientation in the polycrystalline films, no matter which crystal growth/reorganization route has been taken. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks of the two films is fitted by the Gaussian function. The results show that the FWHM of the flake film is 30% smaller than that of the cube film on either the (110) or the (220) crystal plane (Fig. S1b, ESI†), which indicates the superior crystallinity of the flake film.

Hybrid perovskite is known to have temperature-dependent structural phase transitions. We first discuss the optical absorption spectra of the perovskite film on the quartz substrate obtained across the temperature range from 97 K to 298 K. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the unabridged landscape of temperature-dependent absorbance of the flake and cube perovskite films, and the representative absorption spectra are demonstrated in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Obviously, a sharp and strong excitonic absorption peak at ∼740 nm emerges and dominates the optical absorption edge at low temperatures for both samples. With an increase of the temperature, both perovskite films show a broadening band edge and the absorption band edges are blue-shifted.22,33 Meanwhile, the intensity of the excitonic peaks decreases and disappears at 158 K for the flake perovskite and at 168 K for the cube one. Accordingly, it is also clearly shown that a transformation point of the absorption band edge in energy at about 148 K can be identified for the flake film (and at about 157 K for the cube film), which is consistent with the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition of a perovskite at 150–160 K.34–36 Meanwhile, a second excitonic peak at 760 nm emerges for both films owing to the formation of the tetragonal phase. Band edge absorption becomes more predominant accompanied by the gradual decrease and disappearance of the second exciton peaks with the increase of the temperature, and the absorption band edges are blue-shifted. It could be explained that, with the increase of the temperature, the movement of the electron–hole pair augments and the coulomb-correlated electron–hole pair interaction decreases, which weakens the exciton absorption and leads to the dominance of the band edge absorption. On the other side, with the increase of the temperature, the kinetic energy of free charge increases, resulting in the blue shift of band edge absorption.

In addition to the temperature-dependent absorption spectra, the temperature-dependent fluorescence measurements for different perovskite films are also conducted. The 3D contour maps of the fluorescence spectra of the flake and cube films are illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Three characteristic fluorescence components are assigned to the orthorhombic phase, the tetragonal phase, and the trap states, respectively.37,38 The orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition point is consistent with the temperature-dependent absorption spectra (∼160 K). Moreover, only the tetragonal phase is stable above 160 K. Therefore, important physical parameters of perovskites such as exciton energy, exciton–phonon interaction and band gap could be estimated from the temperature-dependent PL data. When the temperature was higher than 168 K, only one fluorescence peak at around 780 nm, assigned to the band-to-band radiative recombination of weak excitons, could be observed. Further analysis revealed that the integrated emission intensity decreased with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 3. The curves can be fitted using the Arrhenius equation,39,40  where I0 is the intensity at T = 0 K, Eb is the exciton binding energy, A is the pre-exponential factor and kB is the Boltzmann constant. From the fitting results, the Eb value of the flake perovskite is determined to be ∼41.4 meV, while the cube perovskite has an Eb value of ∼106.7 meV. The smaller Eb of the flake perovskite film is in accordance with the literature values.39,41 It is very close to the room-temperature thermal characteristic energy (kBT = 26 meV, T = 300 K), which could lead to facile and efficient charge separation. However, the Eb value of the cube perovskite is almost three times higher than that of the flake sample, which would hamper the initial charge separation and thus limit the photo-induced current. The estimated Eb values seem to be larger than the previously reported ones, because the exciton characteristics of perovskites are sensitive to synthesis, compositions and structure details.22,42,43 Obviously, the distinct morphology of the two perovskite films results in the different Eb values and the subsequent charge separation efficiencies. Further evidence could be supported by the time-resolved PL to be discussed later.

A detailed analysis of the temperature dependence of the PL peak broadening can provide information on the exciton–phonon coupling in the perovskites, which also strongly influences the excitonic PL emissions. The FWHM parameter can be converted from nm to meV according to the equation FWHM (meV) = 1.24 × 106 × FWHM (nm)/λ1λ2, where λ1 and λ2 represent the corresponding fitted beginning and ending wavelengths of the FWHM. As shown in Fig. 4, the FWHM broadens from 60 meV to 139 meV for the flake perovskite and from 52 meV to 90 meV for the cube perovskite with increasing temperature from 168 K to 298 K. The temperature-dependent FWHM of PL emissions can be fitted to determine the optical phonon energy by adopting the independent Boson model,44,45  in which Γ0 is the inhomogeneous broadening contribution, σ and Γop describe the interactions of exciton-acoustic phonon and exciton-optical phonon contributions to the line width broadening, respectively. Eop denotes the optical phonon energy, T is the ambient temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Since the contribution from the acoustic phonons is negligible in relation to the optical energy, the parameter σ can be set to zero for simplicity. The optical phonon energy (Eop) is calculated to be ∼54.6 meV (Fig. 4a) and ∼50.1 meV (Fig. 4b) for flake and cube perovskite films, respectively, which are in accordance with the results obtained from temperature-dependent PL46 and Raman scattering experiments.47 Furthermore, the fitting results also imply stronger exciton–phonon interactions in the flake perovskite film than in the cube one. The polaron binding energy (Ep) is calculated according to Fröhlich's weak coupling theory following the expression written as,48,49Ep = αEop,in which the calculation of α is demonstrated in the ESI† in detail. Therefore, the Ep values were calculated to be 46.2 meV for the flake film and 44.2 meV for the cube film, respectively. The results suggest that the flake film prefers a relatively smaller polaron with a smaller phonon cloud radius and a weaker scatter screening effect compared with the cube sample. Although the decrease of polarons can enhance the phonon shielding and reduce the scattering effect, it is unfavorable for the charge transport.
As we all know, the flake perovskite prepared using the single method and the cube perovskite film prepared using the sequential method are used to prepare planar-structured and mesoporous-structured perovskite solar cells, respectively, which indicates that each film has special advantage in the distinct-structured devices. In addition to the abovementioned intrinsic optical properties of the two perovskite films, their carrier transport properties are further investigated, either within the absorber layer or across the heterojunction. TRPL measurements are thus employed to determine the carrier lifetime (τ0) in the perovskite films. τ0 has been successfully applied to describe various radiative and non-radiative loss channels responsible for photoexcited carrier recombination. The samples were fabricated on quartz substrates with an electron quenching layer (PCBM) or hole quenching layer (Spiro-OMeTAD), which can ensure that the experimental results are not affected by the direction of excitation light. Fig. 5 shows the PL decay profiles of samples with/without quenching layers. The fitting results of the curves apparently suggest that the decay trace shows a bi-exponential behavior, and the corresponding fitting parameters of the two kinds of films are shown in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). Interestingly, a τ value of 21 ns was measured for the cube perovskite, which was over twice longer than that measured for the flake perovskite (10 ns). As expected, the addition of the PCBM or Spiro-OMeTAD quenching layers dramatically accelerates the PL decay for both flake and cube perovskite films. The observed time constants for the PCBM-quenched flake and cube films are 3.1 ns and 2.0 ns, respectively, and those for the Spiro-OMeTAD-quenched ones are 9.7 ns and 4.4 ns, respectively. The apparent charge separation efficiency (ηCS) in the perovskite heterojunction is reported to follow the relation ηCS = (kq − k0)/kq, in which k0 is equal to the reciprocal of τ0 of the intrinsic perovskite film and kq is equal to the reciprocal of τq of every kind of perovskite/quenching layer. The related parameters are also displayed in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). Obviously, the cube perovskite demonstrated superior ηCS on both electron/hole quenching layers. This is consistent with the data discussed above, i.e., larger Eop and Ep values are greatly disadvantageous for charge transport.

Conclusions
In summary, two typical kinds of perovskite films with distinct morphologies are fabricated to investigate their intrinsic properties. The morphologies and structures are characterized by means of SEM and XRD, respectively. The absorption and fluorescence results of the films at various temperatures indicate that the morphologies have a great effect on the exciton absorption, exciton binding energy, phonon coupling energy and polaron binding energy of the perovskite films. The exciton transition temperature of the flake perovskite film is about 10 K lower than that of the cube perovskite film. The exciton binding of the flake film is nearly three times smaller than that of the cube one, while the optical phonon energy and the polaron binding energy of the former are about 5 meV and 2 meV larger than those of the latter, respectively. Further fluorescence kinetics results show that the fluorescence lifetime of the flake sample is longer than that of the cube sample, and the results of charge separation efficiency are contradictory. In all, each of the two perovskite films with classical morphologies has its own merits. The optical phonon energy and polaron binding energy of the flake film are larger but the exciton binding energy is smaller. Although the charge separation efficiency of the flake film is lower, the charge life is longer. Therefore, it is reasonable that the flake perovskite can directly be prepared on a compact layer, while the cube perovskite is usually applied in a mesoporous structure device. The work reveals the correlations among the morphology, structure and physical properties of the perovskite films, which gives new insights into the design of matching the perovskite morphology and substrate for further optimization of perovskite solar cells.
