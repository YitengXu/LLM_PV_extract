    , Accepted 4th February 2013First published on 4th February 2013AbstractA fullerene-free bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photodiode (OPD) with high efficiency and green-color selectivity is reported. Using N,N-dimethyl quinacridone (DMQA) as a donor and dibutyl-substituted dicyanovinyl-terthiophene (DCV3T) as an acceptor, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 67% at 540 nm was achieved at −5 V bias. The OPD performance together with their electrical and optical behaviors were investigated by varying the ratio of donor and acceptor components and measuring the absorption coefficient, charge carrier generation, and charge transport. The composition rich in DMQA exhibited a high yield of photogenerated charge carriers and a low absorption intensity, whereas the material rich in DCV3T had a high absorption intensity and low yield of charge carriers. It was found that the 1:1 ratio of components showed the best device performance due to its relatively high absorption and efficient photogeneration of charge carriers. Furthermore, electrical characterization of our BHJ OPDs indicated that a balance of electron and hole mobilities is important for enhancing EQE.
Introduction
Recent studies on the development of photodetectors for color imaging have been conducted with the aim of improving innovative technologies such as image scanners,1 artificial eyes,2 and conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors in mobile phone cameras.3 Silicone-based photodiodes (Si PD) used in CMOS image sensors have led to the development of imaging technology with the merits of high photo-electric conversion efficiency and low dark currents;4 however, broad absorption in their visible region necessitates additional input-signal separation systems.3 Organic photodetectors (OPDs) that selectively absorb visible color and can be integrated into a stacked PD structure may potentially replace Si-PDs and color-filters.5 High absorption coefficients of OPD materials are advantageous for reducing optical crosstalk by enabling a decreased thickness of each light-absorbing layer to be used.6 Hence, the development of a color-sensitive photodetector with comparable performance to Si PDs is highly desirable. The alternation of a green-sensitive OPD would be most urgent and most effective for the stacked structure, because conventional color filter arrays are composed of a typical red-green-green-blue Bayer pattern.3
Fullerene derivatives have been the material of choice for acceptor materials for most OPDs because of their high electron mobility, but the broad absorption spectrum of C60, with a peak intensity in the blue range, may markedly degrade the performance of green-selective OPDs. Hence, it is necessary to choose non-fullerene donor and acceptor materials with narrow absorption bandwidths.
For the production of green-selective OPDs, dicyanovinyl-substituted oligothiophene materials (DCVnT) are attractive candidates that have strong absorption in the wavelength regions of 500 to 600 nm. In addition, the absorption color of DCVnT can be tuned by changing the number of thiophene rings.7 In a previous study for the solar cell application, different DCVnT(n = 4–6) materials were used as donors against fullerene acceptors, while dicyanovinyl terthiophene (DCV3T) could be used as an electron acceptor due to the stronger intramolecular charge transfer interaction in it.8 In addition, the optoelectronic properties of DCV3T can be tuned by controlling the number of side alkyl chains;9 by increasing the number of butyl-side groups, the absorption spectrum becomes red-shifted with a narrower bandwidth. In the present system, dibutyl-substituted DCV3T (Fig. 1), with a narrow bandwidth and a λmax at 540 nm, was adopted for the green-sensitive OPD. Quinacridone derivatives are good candidates as green-absorbing donors and are well known as red-dyes or red-dopants in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). They have a long fluorescence lifetime of approximately 11 ns in thin film form, providing an enhanced exciton collection yield in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices.10 In addition, the NH⋯O hydrogen bonding of unsubstituted quinacridone may induce excessive bathochromic shift from the solution to solid state due to excitonic interaction. Thus, dimethyl substitution of quinacridone can convert hydrogen bonds to van der Waals interaction, which can reduce red shifting of the film absorption spectrum.11 Here, N,N-dimethyl quinacridone (DMQA) was selected owing to its peak intensity (λmax) of around 540 nm in the thin film state and its lack of hydrogen bonding ability.

In this paper, we demonstrate the realization of a green-selective OPD with DMQA as the donor and a DCV3T derivative as the acceptor, which shows a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 67% at an operating voltage of −5 V. We investigated the electrical and optical behaviours of OPDs consisting of DMQA and DCV3T BHJ films with different compositions. The absorption coefficient, charge transport, and charge photogeneration efficiency were assessed in detail. The device efficiency was characterized by the maximum efficiency of charge photogeneration at BHJ interfaces with sufficient light absorption, and the balance of electron and hole mobilities. To interpret the device performance in detail, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and the space-charge-limited-current method were used to measure the efficiency of charge photogeneration and the carrier mobilities, respectively.
Result and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures and energy levels of DMQA11 and DCV3T.9 The offset of LUMO levels between the two active materials was estimated to be approximately 0.9 eV, which favors efficient charge separation.12 From the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that DMQA exhibited a maximum absorption peak at 538 nm with an absorption coefficient of approximately 4.10 × 104 cm−1 and a narrow full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 92 nm, indicating high green color selectivity. In contrast, DCV3T showed a maximum absorption peak at 534 nm, with a high absorption coefficient of 1.14 × 105 cm−1, which is around three times higher than that of DMQA, but a relatively broad FWHM of 161 nm was found, mainly due to the shoulder peak based on the intermolecular excitonic interaction in the film state.9 By blending DMQA and DCV3T in a simple 1:1 ratio, an intermediate absorption peak at 530 nm, which is just the arithmetic sum of the absorbances from individual components to give a high absorption coefficient of 7.4 × 104 cm−1, and a FWHM of 130 nm were obtained. These results suggest that this BHJ system is suitable for a green color absorbing organic layer. The photoluminescence (PL) of the corresponding materials was also measured and the results are shown in Fig. 2(b). DCV3T produced a PL intensity that was moderately higher than that of DMQA, but was significantly quenched by mixing the two, indicating efficient exciton dissociation in DMQA–DCV3T BHJ film.8,13

To investigate the electrical and optical characteristics of the OPDs in detail, devices were prepared with different compositions of DMQA and DCV3T (3:1 (DMQA-rich), 1:1, and 1:3 (DCV3T-rich)). Analysis of the surface morphology of the pure DMQA, pure DCV3T and the blended films are shown in Fig. S1.† The pure DMQA and pure DCV3T films showed root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 28.9 ± 1.3 nm and 20.6 ± 0.7 nm, respectively, attributed to the significant self-aggregation based on their intrinsically compact molecular structures.7,14 In contrast, the active layer roughnesses of the 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 DMQA–DCV3T films were 1.95 ± 0.48 nm, 0.48 ± 0.11 nm, and 0.41 ± 0.02 nm, respectively, demonstrating smoother morphologies than those of the two neat films.
The structure of the OPDs was simplified in order to examine the effects of ratio modulation in the BHJ layer. Devices were fabricated on ITO-coated glass by sequential deposition of a 30 nm layer of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as an excellent hole extraction layer,15 a 70 nm BHJ layer of DMQA and DCV3T, and an 80 nm Al electrode. The reverse bias was made by applying negative voltage to the ITO electrode. Fig. 3(a)–(c) show the EQE spectra of the devices with different compositions of DMQA and DCV3T under different reverse bias. In Fig. 3(a), OPDs with compositions of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 exhibited zero-biased EQEs of 11.1%, 27.5%, and 15.3%, respectively, at 540 nm. All of the OPDs exhibited a strong bias-dependent enhancement of EQEs.16 For instance, the EQEs of the devices with 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 mixing ratios measured at a −3 V reverse bias were 41.8%, 61.7%, and 47.8%, respectively, at a wavelength of 540 nm (Fig. 3(b)). A further increase in reverse bias up to −5 V resulted in considerably enhanced device efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3(c). A maximum EQE of 67.6% at 540 nm with an applied reverse bias voltage of −5 V was obtained from the OPD with the 1:1 BHJ ratio, which is comparable to the EQEs accomplished with polymer-based OPDs (65–75%).17–19 These results indicate that the 1:1 BHJ ratio of DMQA–DCV3T may be close to the optimum composition for high efficiency green OPDs. The absorption spectra of the BHJ layers with different mixing ratios are further plotted in Fig. 3(d). The BHJ layer with a 1:3 ratio (DCV3T-rich) exhibited a higher absorption coefficient than the other BHJ layers, which is expected because of the higher absorption coefficient of pristine DCV3T compared to that of DMQA (Fig. 2(a)). It is well known that high absorption intensity of the active layer is regarded as one of the critical parameters for improving the efficiency of OPDs and organic solar cells.20 However, OPDs with a BHJ ratio of 1:3 DMQA–DCV3T showed much lower EQEs compared to devices with a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that the presence of an additional mechanism via either charge generation or charge transport may influence the device performance.21

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPDs with different BHJ component ratios are shown in Fig. 4. All devices exhibited similar reverse dark current densities of around 3 × 10−7 A cm−2 at a −3 V bias. In contrast, different rectification characteristics were evident in the forward current direction. For instance, the OPD with a 1:1 DMQA–DCV3T ratio produced a typical diode curve with a rectification ratio of 2.21 × 104 at ±3 V, whereas those of the devices with 1:3 and 3:1 mixing ratios showed reduced values of 8.25 × 102 and 2.60 × 101 at ±3 V, respectively. This was mainly attributed to the reduction in the forward dark current densities. Similar reductions in the forward current were also observed for the devices under illumination conditions, indicating that the BHJ ratios significantly influence the charge transport in the devices, resulting in variations in device efficiency.22,23 The OPD with a BHJ component ratio of 1:1 resulted in the largest photo-response under reverse bias, while the photo-current density rapidly decreased for the 1:3 ratio and was reduced even further for the 3:1 ratio device, which is consistent with the EQE variations shown in Fig. 3.

The charge transport characteristics of the devices were further investigated by measuring the carrier mobilities. The hole-only devices were fabricated by depositing a 30 nm MoOx film on ITO-coated glass, followed by a 70 nm BHJ layer, another 30 nm MoOx layer, and an 80 nm Al electrode layer. The electron-only devices were prepared by sequentially depositing a 30 nm pristine DCV3T layer on the ITO, followed by a 70 nm BHJ layer, and 80 nm Al. The hole and electron mobilities of the devices were extracted using the conventional space-charge limited current model22 and the results are summarized in Table 1. The pristine DMQA had a hole mobility of 1.23 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an applied electric field of 0.2 MV cm−1, which then decreased with increasing amount of DCV3T in the blended film, reaching 2.40 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 1:3 DMQA–DCV3T. The film containing solely DCV3T exhibited an electron mobility of 2.46 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which then decreased with increasing amount of DMQA, reaching 1.23 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 3:1 DMQA–DCV3T. For the 1:1 ratio, almost identical carrier mobilities of around 2 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed. It should be noted that the 1:1 BHJ ratio resulted in the highest photocurrent density as well as EQE of the device, while both 3:1 and 1:3 ratios exhibited significantly degraded device performance (see Fig. 3 and 4). These results imply that the higher device efficiency achieved with the mixing ratio of 1:1 may be related to the balance in charge carrier mobility19,24,25 and the consequent minimization of charge recombination.22,23,26 However, the charge imbalance observed is similar for the devices with the BHJ ratios of 3:1 and 1:3, but the EQE and the photocurrent density of the 1:3 device are clearly higher than those of the 3:1 device, most likely due to the higher absorbance of the former device than that of the latter.

To study the overall efficiency of exciton diffusion and charge transfer at the interfaces, we carried out ultrafast transient absorption studies on a series of thin films made from DMQA and DCV3T. An estimate of the relative charge generation efficiency in BHJ films requires an interpretation of the spectral signature and relaxation dynamics of DMQA and DCV3T excitons. Fig. 5(a) shows TA spectra of DMQA, DCV3T, and DMQA–DCV3T in 1:1 ratio at a pump–probe delay of 0.4 ps. The pump fluence was maintained at 7 μJ cm−2 to avoid any undesired exciton decay channels such as biexciton annihilation.27 The spectral signatures in the region of 500–600 nm originate from ground state bleaching (GSB) and those in the region of 650–800 nm are the sum of two contributions from photoinduced absorption (PIA) and stimulated emission (SE), with the former dominating to give overall negative ΔT/T. In the case of the neat films, the GSB recovery rate, as well as the PIA/SE signals, reflects the lifetime of excitons. In Fig. 5(b), the spectrally integrated kinetics of the neat films is presented. TA kinetics for GSB and PIA are integrated in the ranges of 520–550 nm and 770–800 nm, respectively. The integration range of GSB corresponds to the absorption peak maxima of neat and BHJ films taken from Fig. 2(a), and that of the PIA kinetics was chosen to include PIA contribution only, avoiding any SE contribution (see Fig. 2(b) for emission spectra). From the GSB kinetics, it was found that the 1/e-lifetime of excitons was 38 ps for DCV3T and 146 ps for DMQA. A comparable value of 42 ps was obtained from the PIA kinetics of DCV3T. The TA kinetics of the BHJ films shown in Fig. 5(c) were quite different from those of the neat films. The GSB kinetics showed much slower recovery of ground state population and the PIA kinetics demonstrated increased absorption that was constant over several nanoseconds. The PIA signal of the BHJ films was attributed to free charge carriers generated from exciton dissociation. The PIA signal could not occur from excitons as their lifetime is much shorter. In the 1:1 DMQA–DCV3T film, the PIA signal decayed initially during the first 1–2 ps and then increased up to approximately 500 ps. This indicates that the initial PIA signal originated from excited state absorption by excitons, and the remaining part of the PIA signal is mainly due to free charge carriers after exciton dissociation by electron transfer. This effect was clearly seen in the 1:3 film, where DCV3T was the major component. Initially, the PIA signal decayed faster than that of DCV3T due to charge transfer at dissociation sites, and it reached a plateau after a few hundred picoseconds, indicating that charge generation was complete. From the analysis of the PIA signals, we could estimate the efficiency of carrier generation in the BHJ films. Because the PIA kinetics were normalized with respect to the corresponding GSB maximum, the intensity of the PIA signal was directly proportional to the number of charge carriers generated per absorbed photon. Assuming the efficiency of charge generation in the 1:1 film was unity, the carrier generation efficiency of the 3:1 and 1:3 films was calculated to be 0.79 and 0.27, respectively.
 Fig. 5  (a) Transient absorption (TA) spectra of neat DMQA and DCV3T films, and BHJ films with a composition ratio of 1:1 at a pump–probe delay of 400 fs, and normalized TA kinetics (b) of the two neat films, and (c) of the three BHJ films with composition ratios of DMQA–DCV3T of 3:1, 1:1, 1:3. 
The difference in charge generation efficiencies among the three BHJ films may be further explained by the relationship between nanoscopic morphology and exciton lifetime. From AFM measurements carried out on the BHJ films (Fig. S1†), it can be inferred that all three films have well dispersed p- and n-domains, with no phase separation evident in the images. However, nanoscale surface morphology that cannot be probed by AFM because of the small feature size may vary among the films, depending on the ratios of DMQA and DCV3T. In the 1:1 BHJ film, the efficiency of charge photogeneration was maximized, indicating that excitons of DMQA and DCV3T at this ratio have the highest probability of reaching dissociation sites among the three films. This implies that the interfacial area for exciton dissociation is largest in this particular BHJ film. DCV3T excitons, which have a relatively short lifetime (38–42 ps) compared to DMQA excitons (146 ps), require a smaller domain size in order to reach interfaces and dissociate before they decay back to the ground state. In the case of the DMQA-rich film (3:1), the nanoscopic size of the DCV3T domains may be smaller than that of those in the DCV3T-rich film (1:3), suggesting that DCV3T excitons in the 3:1 film will survive long enough to reach dissociation sites and contribute more charge generation than in the 1:3 film. In addition, DMQA excitons with longer lifetimes may still contribute significantly to charge generation, even in the larger nanoscopic domains of the 3:1 film, to give a higher relative carrier generation efficiency (0.79; vide supra) compared to that of the 1:3 film (0.27). Therefore, it should be mentioned that the interfacial area, nanoscopic domain size, and exciton lifetime of DMQA and DCV3T are all key factors in the efficiency of charge photogeneration.
On the basis of the device characteristics and the analyses so far, we propose a possible mechanism relating the device performance and the composition of the BHJ layer, in terms of absorption efficiency, charge transport, and charge carrier generation. The layer of blended DMQA and DCV3T with a ratio of 1:3 exhibited the highest absorption intensity, as shown in Fig. 3(d), implying that it had the highest probability of exciton generation.20 The excitons decayed rapidly within a time scale of 100 ps (Fig. 5(c)), before they had the chance to generate charge carriers.20,28 The absorption efficiency of the DMQA–DCV3T 1:3 film was seen to be higher than that of the 3:1 film by a factor of 1.5, but the efficiency of charge generation was much lower in the 1:3 film. Further investigation into charge carrier mobility showed that the electrons move approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the holes in the 1:3 films (Table 1). It has been suggested that the imbalance in carrier densities may also cause charge recombination and a consequent reduction in the charge collection efficiency,22,23,26 resulting in a low zero-bias device EQE of 15.3% at 540 nm for the 1:3 film. Although the combined efficiency of charge generation and absorption was much higher than that in the 1:3 film, the 3:1 BHJ system, in which the hole mobility was two orders of magnitude higher than the electron mobility, demonstrated a reduced forward photocurrent density, as shown in Fig. 4. Although charge imbalance was observed in both the 3:1 and 1:3 ratios, it was clearly seen that the forward photocurrent density of the 3:1 BHJ system (faster holes) was significantly lower than that of the 1:3 BHJ system (faster electrons), indicating that the electron mobility in the BHJ layer is the more significant factor in limiting the photocurrent density of the devices. Finally, the BHJ layer with a 1:1 ratio of DMQA–DCV3T showed a relatively high absorption intensity, as shown in Fig. 3(d), and also fairly efficient photon-to-charge generation (Fig. 5(c)). In addition, well balanced charge carrier mobility is likely to contribute to efficient charge collection, which in this case resulted in the highest zero-biased EQE of 27.5% at 540 nm for the 1:1 ratio.
Conclusions
We have investigated the electrical and optical behaviours of BHJ films consisting of different ratios of DMQA (donor) and DCV3T (acceptor) molecules. Assessment of device performance demonstrated that the highest EQE with a narrow bandwidth occurred for the 1:1 ratio. The origin of this optimum composition was elucidated using light absorption, charge carrier photogeneration, and charge mobility analysis. Longer exciton lifetimes and smaller domain sizes guarantee more efficient photon-to-charge conversion, as was seen for the DMQA-rich film. However, a higher absorption coefficient means more incident light is utilized, as in the DCV3T-rich film. The balance between electron and hole mobility produces less charge accumulation and non-geminate recombination loss. All of these parameters have been shown to play important roles in overall device performance. A green-sensitive OPD constructed using this optimum composition realized a maximum EQE of over 67% at −5 V, demonstrating its great potential for application to CMOS image sensors.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Organic photodiodes were fabricated on glass substrates pre-coated with indium-tin-oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square. N,N-Dimethyl quinacridone (DMQA) (Lumtec, >99% purity) and dicyanovinyl terthiophene (DCV3T) (>99% purity) were used as the donor and acceptor materials, respectively. The organic layers and Al cathode were deposited using vacuum thermal evaporation at a base pressure of <2 × 10−7 Torr. All organic layers were deposited at a total rate of 0.1 nm s−1. A 30 nm thick layer of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) was also deposited using vacuum thermal evaporation with the deposition rate of 0.1 Å s−1. The Al cathode was deposited at a rate of 0.2 nm s−1 through a shadow mask with an active area of 0.04 cm2. The hole-only devices were fabricated by depositing layers consisting of 30 nm MoOx, 70 nm BHJ, 30 nm MoOx, and 80 nm Al metal onto the ITO. The electron-only devices were prepared by sequentially depositing a 30 nm pristine DCV3T film, a 70 nm BHJ layer, and a 80 nm Al layer onto the ITO. After device formation, glass encapsulation was performed using UV exposure for 5 min.
Device characterization
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley K4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer, and the light response was measured under illumination from a white LED with a broad range of emission wavelengths of 400 to 675 nm and light output intensity of approximately 5 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a spectral IPCE measurement system under monochromatic light generated by an ozone-free Xe lamp with a chopper frequency of 30 Hz. A calibrated Si-PD was used to measure the incident monochromatic light intensity. The incident light power was measured to be 176 μW cm−2 at the wavelength of 540 nm.
Absorbance and photoluminescence
Absorption spectra of organic films grown on glass substrates were collected using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-240). The photoluminescence spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi corp., F7000) equipped with a Xe lamp as the light source.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Ultrafast transient absorption spectra were collected using a pump–probe system (Ultrafast Systems, Helios). A pump beam with a pulse energy of 60 nJ at 540 nm was obtained from an optical parametric amplifier (Light conversion, TOPAS-C), pumped by a regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapphire laser system (Coherent, Libra, 800 nm wavelength, 50 fs pulse duration, 1 kHz repetition rate). The probe beam was a white light continuum generated by focusing a small portion of the amplifier output though a sapphire window. All measurements were carried out under ambient conditions.
