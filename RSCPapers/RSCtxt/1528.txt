    , Accepted 4th October 2012First published on 4th October 2012AbstractAn oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)–C70 dyad achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (1.92%) in dyad-based organic solar cells to date. Covalent attachment in the dyad prevents large phase separation, resulting in good morphological and device stability at high temperatures as compared with mixed bulk heterojunction devices.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn much attention as a sustainable energy source due to potential advantages such as low fabrication cost, light weight and flexibility.1–4 One of the most promising OSC device structure is based upon mixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin film.5,6 This structure provides a large interface between electron donor and acceptor groups by forming nanometre scale domains and interpenetrating carrier transport networks of components.5,6 As a result, efficient charge separation and transport are achieved in the films, leading to high power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 8% with a conjugated polymer as the electron donor and a fullerene derivative as the acceptor.7,8
In this mixed BHJ structure, however, the nanostructure is difficult to control. The morphology of the domains in the films is strongly dependent upon the fabrication conditions, such as the mixing ratio, organic solvent, additives, spin-coating speed and thermal annealing conditions.9–11 Even if the resulting film morphology is ideal immediately after fabrication, this could be easily changed by long-term operation or high temperature conditions, because this mixed structure is not the thermodynamically stable state.12 The fullerene derivative tends to aggregate as a result of diffusion, and thus unfavourable large phase separation is formed.13 This morphological change drastically lowers device performance.
Extensive research has been done on nanostructure control of domains to overcome the obstacles to high efficiency.14 In particular, stability has been investigated through the use of compatibilisers,15 cross-linkable polymers,16 and block copolymers.17,18 Our recent report revealed that a fully conjugated diblock copolymer with a fullerene derivative covalently attached to one of the blocks formed an ideal nanoscale pattern in the films and achieved high device performance with high thermal stability.17 The system did not rely on the mixing of the donor–acceptor materials, showing that the proper molecular design could lead to the stable nanostructure for OSCs.
Dyad molecules (i.e. covalently attached donor and acceptor groups) have an advantage in terms of nanostructure control, and thus also hold promise for stabilising the phase separation of domains.19–21 In contrast to fullerene-bearing block copolymers, small molecules do not have the problems of the polymers, such as molecular weight distribution, end-group contamination and difficulty in purification, leading to the advantages of less batch-to-batch variation, and better reproducibility.3,22 We previously disclosed dyad molecules that showed PCE exceeding 1%.23,24 Nevertheless, no reports have covered the construction of morphologically stable OSCs using dyad molecules.
In this paper, we examine the morphological stability of dyad molecules. We used previously reported highly crystalline oligo(p-pheneylenevinylene) (OPV) as the donor part, and newly introduced C70 fullerene, which has high absorption in the visible region, as the acceptor part25 in the dyad molecule. OSC devices were fabricated and the relations between the thermal stability of film morphology and the device performance parameters were examined. For comparison, mixed BHJ devices with OPV and a C70 derivative were also prepared.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and instruments
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, or Wako Chemicals and used without further purification. Cyclic voltammetry was measured on an HSV-100 automatic polarisation system (Hokuto Denko Company). Anhydrous chloroform was used as the solvent under N2, and 0.1 M tetrabutylammomium hexafluorophosphate was used as a supporting electrolyte. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl wire was used as the reference electrode. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a V-670 system (Nippon Bunko Company). 1H NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 containing 1% v/v TMS on an Oxford superconducting magnet system (500 MHz). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS spectra were measured with dithranol as the matrix on an Applied Biosystems BioSpectrometry Workstation spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR). High-performance liquid chromatography was carried out on a system with a CBM-20A controller (Shimadzu), an LC-6AD pump (Shimadzu), an SPD-20A UV-vis detector and a Luna Silica column (particle size: 5 μm; column length: 250 mm; inner diameter: 21.2 mm) (Phenomenex). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces were obtained on a Rigaku Thermo plus DSC8230.
2.2. Syntheses
The details of the synthetic procedures, and the spectral data from 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF-MS, are described below. OPV was synthesised according to procedures in the literature.26

[6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid. 
[6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (500 mg, 0.485 mmol), toluene (87.5 mL), acetic acid (75 mL) and HCl (12 M, 30 mL) were added to a 300 mL round-bottom flask. The reaction mixture was stirred for 72 h at 90 °C. All solvents were removed by evaporation. The solid was washed sequentially with water, methanol, acetone, chlorobenzene, CHCl3 and hexane yielding a black-brown solid (338 mg, 69%).

1H NMR (CS2, CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ (ppm): 7.83–7.85 (d, 2H), 7.45–7.48 (m, 2H), 7.37–7.40 (m, 1H), 2.37–2.47 (m, 4H), 2.01–2.18 (m, 2H).


OPV–C70 dyad. 
[6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid (107 mg, 0.105 mmol) was placed in a 100 mL two-neck round-bottom flask under N2, then distilled CS2 (35 mL) and thionyl chloride (706 μL, 9.79 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight at 55 °C. The solvent was removed, the crude product was dried at 80 °C for 3 h, and then anhydrous chlorobenzene (10 mL) was added. The flask was covered with aluminium foil, and OPV (70 mg, 0.109 mmol) and NaH (oil dispersion 50–72%, 17.8 mg) that had been washed with hexane were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 h and then purified by column chromatography using silica gel and CHCl3 as an eluent and by HPLC using CHCl3 as an eluent. The obtained product was precipitated in hexane and filtered, yielding the dyad as a brown solid (50 mg, yield: 33%).

1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ (ppm): 7.87–7.89 (m, 2H), 7.40–7.54 (m, 17H), 6.96–7.22 (m, 8H), 6.90–6.92 (d, 4H), 4.23–4.25 (t, 2H), 4.20–4.22 (t, 2H), 3.92–9.94 (m, 5H), 3.84 (s, 6H), 3.61–3.79 (m, 18H), 2.46–2.49 (m, 2H), 2.39–2.43 (m, 2H), 2.03–2.20 (m, 2H). MALDI-TOF-MS (m/z): 1855.51 (M+).

2.3. Photovoltaic device preparation and measurement
Using the OPV–C70 dyad and BHJ of OPV:PC70BM, photovoltaic devices were prepared in a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PC70BM/Ca/Al. An ITO-coated glass substrate (sheet resistance: 10 Ω sq−1, Geomatech, Japan) was cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent, water, acetone, 2-propanol and water. After the substrate was dried, PEDOT:PSS (H. C. Stark) was spin-coated (4000 rpm) onto ITO. The film was dried at 150 °C under N2 for 20 min. After cooling the substrate, CHCl3 solution of OPV–C70 dyad (10 mg mL−1) or mixture of OPV and PC70BM (4.62/5.55 mg mL−1) was spin-coated (2500 rpm). Films with the OPV–C70 dyad were thermally annealed at 80, 110, 150 °C for 5 min under an N2 atmosphere before deposition of the buffer layer and electrode. In thermal stability measurement, films with the OPV–C70 dyad and OPV/PC70BM were thermally annealed at 110 °C for 5 min, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days, respectively, under an N2 atmosphere. The PC60BM (20 nm) buffer layer and, Ca (20 nm) and Al (40 nm) electrodes were evaporated onto the organic layer under high vacuum (6 × 10−4 Pa).

I–V characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated solar light illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) from a 150 W xenon lamp (PEC-L11, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (BS520, Bunko-Keiki, Japan). The active area of the devices was defined to be 0.12 cm2 by a photomask. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a Hypermonolight SM-250F system (Bunko-Keiki, Japan). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained on a Digital Instrumental Nanoscope 31 operated in tapping mode. Film thickness was measured by surface profilometry (Dektak 6M, ULVAC, Japan).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Syntheses
A C70 fullerene-bearing OPV dyad molecule (OPV–C70 dyad) was synthesised by esterification of OPV and a C70 fullerene derivative with an acyl chloride group (Scheme 1). The synthetic route to the OPV donor part has been reported previously.26 The products were characterised by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS, and synthetic details and spectral data are described above. The 1H NMR chart of the OPV–C70 dyad used for the OSC fabrications is available in ESI.† All the peaks of the OPV–C70 dyad were assigned and the ratios of the peak area were consistent with the chemical structure of the OPV–C70 dyad as described in the experimental section. Besides the peak of water at 1.56 ppm, only a few minor unknown peaks were observed in the aliphatic region at 1.25, 0.87, 0.49 ppm.

3.2. Molecular properties

Absorption spectra. 
Absorption spectra of the OPV–C70 dyad and OPV in CHCl3 solution are shown in Fig. 1a. An absorption shoulder from 480 nm to 700 nm appeared in the spectrum of the OPV–C70 dyad, which corresponds to the absorption of C70 fullerene. Compared with previously reported C60-bearing OPV (OPV–C60 dyad),23 OPV–C70 showed higher absorption in the visible region due to the absorption of C70 fullerene. The absorption spectrum of the OPV–C70 dyad in thin film is shown in Fig. 1b. The peak of the OPV–C70 dyad is shifted from 420 nm in solution to 440 nm in thin film. The redshift in OPV absorption could be attributed to the formation of J-aggregation in the donor part.27 This result indicates that strong π–π interaction was present in the OPV part of OPV–C70 dyad, and agrees with our previous report.23

Cyclic voltammetry (CV). 
The first oxidation (Eox) and the reduction potentials (Ered) of the OPV–C70 dyad relative to the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CHCl3 solution. The energy levels of the OPV–C70 dyad were estimated by assuming the Fc/Fc+ potential to be −4.8 eV relative to the vacuum level. A cyclic voltammogram of the OPV–C70 dyad is shown in Fig. 2a. Half potentials of Eox and Ered, were +0.44 and −1.17 V, respectively. Eox and Ered correspond to HOMO of OPV (electron donor part) and LUMO of the fullerene derivative (electron acceptor part). Eox of the OPV–C70 dyad was larger than low band gap dyad that we reported previously,24 which lead to higher VOC of the OPV–C70 dyad.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
The DSC chart of the OPV–C70 dyad is shown in Fig. 2b. One endothermic peak (187 °C) and one exothermic peak (154 °C) were observed. The phase transition temperatures of the OPV–C70 dyad were similar to those of the OPV–C60 dyad which had high crystallinity (192 °C and 152 °C, respectively).23

3.3. Photovoltaic properties
The OSC devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/OPV–C70 dyad/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) (20 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (40 nm). The PC60BM buffer layer was evaporated to suppress the leakage current due to Al penetration. The solution of OPV–C70 dyad had a concentration of 10 g L−1, and the active layers were spin-coated at 2500 rpm. Before forming the PC60BM, Ca and Al layers, the devices were thermally annealed at 110 °C for 5 min under an N2 atmosphere in optimized conditions. The devices annealed at 80 °C and 150 °C were also fabricated. Thermal annealing was performed before deposition of those layers to avoid the diffusion of PC60BM into the active layer.28,29 The OSC devices were evaluated under simulated solar light illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) through a photomask with an aperture size of 0.12 cm2. Device fabrication conditions and performance parameters were summarized in ESI.†
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device with the OPV–C70 dyad annealed at 110 °C is shown in Fig. 3a. The device based upon the OPV–C70 dyad showed an EQE value of 0.45 at 450 nm, which is higher than that of other dyads because the highly crystalline nature of OPV realised efficient hole transport.23 A broad photocurrent response up to 700 nm was observed due to the absorption of C70 fullerene in the visible region.

The J–V plot of the best device annealed at 110 °C under AM 1.5 illumination is shown in Fig. 3b. The device showed a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 0.46 due to the strong π–π interactions in OPV, as well as high open-circuit voltage (VOC) because of the low-lying HOMO energy level of OPV. As expected from the broad absorption and photocurrent response of C70 fullerene in the visible region, the short circuit current density (JSC) increased from 3.3 mA cm−2 for the OPV–C60 dyad to 4.6 mA cm−2 for the OPV–C70 dyad. This photocurrent increase led to PCE of 1.92%. This is the highest PCE reported to date for dyad-based OSCs, exceeding the value of 1.50% reported for the oligo(fluorene-alt-bithiophene)–perylene diimide dyad30 as well as the value of 1.28% for the OPV–C60 dyad.23,27

Thermal stability. 
The thermal stability of morphology in the films with the OPV–C70 dyad was studied compared with physically mixed BHJ films with OPV and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). The devices based upon the OPV–C70 dyad were fabricated under the same conditions except for the thermal annealing time. The mixed solution of OPV and PC70BM for the BHJ was prepared with the concentrations of 4.62 and 5.55 g L−1, respectively, which had the same molar ratio as the OPV–C70 dyad (1:1). The BHJ device configuration was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (OPV:PC70BM)/PC60BM (20 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (40 nm). The active layers were spin-coated at 2500 rpm. Before the deposition of PC60BM, Ca and Al, all the devices were thermally annealed at 110 °C for 5 min, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days under an N2 atmosphere. For comparison, devices not subjected to thermal annealing were also fabricated for both OPV–C70 dyad and OPV:PC70BM BHJ. Thickness of the active layers of both OPV–C70 dyad and OPV:PC70BM BHJ was 80 nm in as-casted film measured by surface profilometry. This value remained unchanged after the prolonged annealing.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of mixed films and dyad films subjected to different annealing times are shown in Fig. 4 (images after annealing for 1, 2 and 3 days are provided in ESI†). For BHJ films, the aggregation sizes were over 100 nm even in the as-cast film, and larger aggregation was observed as annealing time was prolonged. Roughness factors (Ra) of these films were 2.0, 3.3, 3.4, 3.9 and 3.9 nm for as-cast film and films annealed for 5 min, 1, 2 and 3 days, respectively. The gradual increase of the roughness with longer annealing time indicates that the morphology changed in the mixed films by aggregation of the domains. On the other hand, such large phase separation was not observed in OPV–C70 dyad films, although there were small patterns. Compared with the mixed films, the dyad films had smaller surface roughness, Ra: 0.29, 0.98, 0.85, 0.93 and 0.86 nm for as-cast film and films annealed for 5 min, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days, respectively. This difference in the AFM images demonstrated the suppression of the large phase separation and the improvement of morphological thermal stability of domains in the dyad films.

Selected device performance parameters for different annealing times are plotted in Fig. 5, and all the parameters are available in ESI.† The mixed devices showed a low PCE of 0.65% for the as-cast film. Moreover, PCE decreased rapidly to 0.32% upon annealing for 5 min, and then gradually decreased upon annealing for longer times due to the deterioration of JSC and FF. The mixed device annealed for 3 days showed a JSC of 1.13 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.31 and a PCE of 0.23%. In the mixed films, the phase separation was of a scale larger than the typical exciton diffusion length, as observed by AFM (Fig. 4a and b); such phase separation could decrease the size of the interface between the electron donor and acceptor. This could lead to inefficient charge separation and thus smaller photocurrent. Furthermore, this decrease of the interface area proceeded with longer thermal annealing, as suggested by the Ra increase. According to a previous report, deterioration of device performance was also observed in P3HT:PC60BM mixed BHJ devices, which is one of the most widely studied combinations in OSCs, and thermal annealing for 80 h at 130 °C decreased the PCE from 3.0% to 0.6% due to the aggregation of PC60BM.17 Diffusion of PC60BM within the active layer was also observed at 110 °C in another paper.29 In contrast, all the parameters of the dyad devices were constant within this period of thermal annealing. Annealing for 5 min improved JSC from 3.45 to 3.93 mA cm−2, FF from 0.45 to 0.48 and PCE from 1.37 to 1.66%. Even after 3 days of thermal annealing, the devices showed a high PCE of 1.52%. JSC was much higher in the dyad devices than the mixed devices because of the larger donor/acceptor interface due to the suppression of large phase separation. The dyad devices also showed higher FF due to the construction of an interpenetration network by the highly crystalline OPV group. Furthermore, this ideal nanostructure and high device performance were preserved after long thermal annealing. These comparisons indicated that the dyad film had a thermally stable morphology.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the introduction of C70 fullerene improved light-harvesting ability, and realised a high PCE of 1.92%. Furthermore, the dyad films exhibited much higher morphological stability even under prolonged annealing, in contrast to the mixed BHJ films. This study demonstrates the considerable promise of the donor–acceptor dyad approach for realising efficient and stable organic solar cells.
