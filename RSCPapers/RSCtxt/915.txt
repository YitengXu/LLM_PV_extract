    , Accepted 30th March 2017First published on 30th March 2017AbstractPhotoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan with methanol using a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode and Br+/Br− as a mediator was demonstrated with low applied potential. The faradaic efficiency for the dimethoxylation with a Et4NBF4 co-supporting electrolyte at +0.1 V vs. SHE was almost quantitative up to 99%.
Electro-organic synthesis is a powerful tool for the various transformations of organic compounds into useful and valuable chemicals because it is possible to readily generate a wide variety of reactive intermediates by electron transfer at the electrode surface without the need for handling sensitive, expensive and toxic reagents. A variety of organic reactions have been previously achieved by electrochemical methods under dark conditions.1 However, in electrochemical methods, a high applied potential and large amount of electrical power are required to achieve the conversion of some organic compounds. On the other hand, photo-assisted electrochemical synthesis is a highly attractive method that serves as an alternative to conventional electrochemical methods because it allows a dramatic decrease in applied potential due to solar energy assistance.
Since the discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect,2 much work has been conducted on photoelectrochemical water splitting using n-type semiconductor photoanodes such as TiO2, WO3, BiVO4 and so on.3–5 Especially, the BiVO4, which have narrow bandgap energy (2.4 eV), is attracted widespread of attention as a visible-light promoted photocatalyst. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 increased remarkably to combine the WO3 because the position of conduction band on WO3 (+0.42 eV) is allows for facile electron injection from the conduction band on BiVO4 (0 eV). We previously reported that water was effectively decomposed to hydrogen and oxygen using a BiVO4/WO3 composite photoanode at lower applied potential (as compared to the theoretical water electrolysis voltage) due to light energy assistance.6–10 From these facts, it is expected that photoelectrochemical systems would also be useful for electro-organic syntheses. However, previous studies have focussed on the oxidative degradation of toxic and/or harmful chemicals to harmless chemicals including carbon dioxide, and there are only a few reports focusing on the photoelectrochemical transformation of organic compounds as useful and valuable chemicals. Recently, Choi et al. showed the photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid with excellent faradaic efficiency using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as a redox mediator.11 This successful result suggests that the oxidation selectivity at the photoelectrode surface is an important factor in the improvement of faradaic efficiency, and that the redox mediators play critical roles in avoiding both the overoxidation of products and unfavourable reactions.
Herein, we aimed to develop a photoelectrochemical system for selective organic syntheses using a Br+/Br− mediator. It has been reported that for reactions in the dark, electrochemical dimethoxylation of furan on a carbon anode can be achieved using a Br+/Br− mediator to avoid the oxidation of MeOH,12 and that the electrochemically generated positive bromine species was mainly Br+ (not Br2), which reacts with organic compounds as an oxidant.13 Furan and its derivatives are important building blocks for medicinal and agricultural chemicals and biofuels. The key features of this method are that photogenerated holes oxidise Br− to generate Br+ species; subsequently, the generated Br+ species mediate the generation of cation species from furan and then react with MeOH to provide the corresponding methoxylated product. However, in the case of the photoelectrochemical reaction, there is a possibility that unfavourable side reactions, i.e. oxidation of MeOH and the methoxylated product, will readily occur by holes in the valence band of semiconductor photoanodes. Therefore, in this paper, the selective dimethoxylation of furan using a Br+/Br− mediator was investigated as a model reaction on various photoanodes with low applied potential under simulated solar light (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Plausible mechanism for photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan using Br+/Br− as a mediator. 
To investigate the oxidation properties in an organic electrolyte including Br− without furan, we measured linear sweep voltammograms of 10 mM Et4NBr and 90 mM Et4NBF4 in MeCN. In the case of the BiVO4/WO3 photoelectrode, the oxidation current was observed at >+1.2 V vs. SHE under dark conditions (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, the oxidation potential was clearly shifted to nearly 0 V vs. SHE under photo irradiation form a solar simulator (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, Fig. 2(b)). The onset potentials of the Pt and FTO electrodes were at +0.6 V and +1.2 V vs. SHE, respectively. These results indicate that photoelectrolysis is a useful method for decreasing the applied potential.

Table 1 shows the photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan using various photoanodes. The electrode material is one of the most important factors in the oxidation selectivity of the organic compounds. In particular, the oxidation properties of photogenerated holes strongly depend on the semiconductor materials in the photoelectrochemical method. The composition and morphology of the prepared photoelectrodes were confirmed by XRD, XRF and SEM analyses (Fig. S1, S2 and Table S1, ESI†). As for BiVO4/WO3, the methoxylation of furan proceeded smoothly to provide the corresponding methoxylated product with high faradaic efficiency (Table 1, entry 1). The highest faradaic efficiency was >99% at +0.1 V vs. SHE (Table 1, entry 5), and the turn over number was 122. In contrast, a trace amount of product was detected in the absence of Et4NBr as a Br− source (Table 1, entry 4). The redox potential of Br+/Br− was at +0.7 eV, which was estimated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3, ESI†). The time dependence of the accumulation of the photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan using the BiVO4/WO3 photoanode with and without photoirradiation is shown in Fig. 3. The methoxylated product and oxidation current were hardly observed at an applied potential of +0.1 V vs. SHE under dark conditions. On the other hand, the oxidation current was obtained at the same applied potential and the methoxylated product was accumulated under photoirradiation. The steady state photocurrent at the first illumination period was almost same as those at the second illumination period, suggested that the fresh photoanode was changed to the steady state condition during the first illumination period. With simple BiVO4 photoelectrode, the methoxylated product was obtained with 74% faradaic efficiency, however, the reaction time was increased 8 times compared with that of BiVO4/WO3 composite because of its lower photo activity (Fig. S4, ESI†). In contrast, in the case of other photoanodes such as WO3 and TiO2, the faradaic efficiencies of the methoxylated product were negligible (Table 1, entries 2 and 3), and by-products from furan were not detected in the reaction mixture. The valence band potentials of TiO2 and WO3 were very positive (ca. +3.0 V vs. SHE), compared with that of BiVO4 (ca. +2.5 V vs. SHE).2,3,14 These results suggest that the oxidation abilities of the photogenerated holes in the TiO2 and WO3 photoanodes were too strong and that the oxidation of MeOH and methoxylated product might readily occur by holes. On the other hand, it is clear that BiVO4/WO3 was the best material for the selective photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan because of its moderate oxidation ability of holes in the BiVO4 valence band.

 Fig. 3  Photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan using a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode in a one-compartment cell under dark conditions and photo irradiation (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Substrate concentration: 0.7 M (11 mmol); volume of solvent: 15 ml (MeOH/MeCN = 1/9); working electrode: BiVO4/WO3 photoanode; counter electrode: Pt wire; quasi-reference electrode: Ag wire. Photoelectrolysis was conducted in constant potential mode (+0.1 V vs. SHE). 

Fig. 4 shows the effect of the concentration of Br− on the faradaic efficiency of the photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan at +0.5 V vs. SHE. The methoxylated product was not detected in the absence of Et4NBr (the same as in Table 1). The faradaic efficiency of the methoxylated product significantly increased with the concentration of Br− and the optimum concentration was around 10 mM. It was found that the faradaic efficiency was significantly decreased with higher concentrations of Et4NBr (>10 mM) and lower concentrations of Et4NBF4, suggesting that Et4NBF4 is also necessary to improve the faradaic efficiency. It is speculated that the stability of cation species generated from furan was dependent on the counter anion derived from the supporting electrolyte.15 A Similar trend was obtained when the constant electrolysis was conducted at +0.1 V vs. SHE (Table S2, ESI†). To investigate the effect of the co-supporting electrolyte, photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan in 50 mM Et4NBr as a Br− source and 50 mM Et4NX (X = Br−, BF4−, OTf−, ClO4−) in MeCN/MeOH (9/1) was also examined. The order of faradaic efficiencies using various co-supporting electrolytes was: BF4− (73%) > OTf− (55%) > Br− (48%) > ClO4− (41%), which was similar to the order of the cation stabilization effect due to the electron donating ability of the anion.16 Therefore, the faradaic efficiency of methoxylation had an optimum concentration of Et4NBr/Et4NBF4, and Et4NBF4 was the best co-supporting electrolyte.
 Fig. 4  Photoelectrochemical methoxylation of furan in the Et4NBr concentration range of 1–100 mM. Substrate concentration: 0.7 M; volume of solvent: 15 ml (MeOH/MeCN = 1/9); supporting electrolyte: Et4NBr + Et4NBF4 (total concentration of supporting electrolyte was 100 mM); working electrode: BiVO4/WO3 photoelectrode; counter electrode: Pt wire; quasi-reference electrode: Ag wire in a one-compartment cell; charge passed: 5 C. Photoelectrolysis was conducted in constant potential mode (0.5 V vs. SHE) under photo irradiation (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). 
To investigate the properties of the accumulated Br+ species, the photoelectrolysis of 90 mM Et4NBF4 and 10 mM Et4NBr in MeCN was conducted over a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode using a divided two-compartment cell with neither MeOH nor furan (Fig. S5, ESI†). The colourless anolyte solution was changed to a yellow colour. The large reduction current at +0.4 V vs. SHE in the linear sweep voltammogram of anolyte after photoelectrolysis in Fig. 5 shows the presence a reducible current of Br+ species, whereas this was not observed before photoelectrolysis. The yellow colour quickly changed back to colourless by the addition of furan and MeOH, and it was found that the methoxylated product was obtained with good faradaic efficiency (75%) by this two-step reaction. These results strongly suggest that the yellow Br+ species was relatively stable, and that photoelectrochemical oxidation of furan proceeded by an indirect method, with Br+/Br− as a mediator. It is noted that the methoxylation reaction of furan hardly proceeded (12% yield) by adding Br2 as an oxidant as a substitute for photoelectrochemically generated Br+ species. This suggests that the photoelectrochemically oxidised species from Br− is probably not Br2 but rather a Br+-like species. As for the reaction mechanism, the selective oxidation of Br− into Br+ species proceeded by photogenerated holes on the semiconductor with low applied potential, and Br+ reacted rapidly with furan to provide the corresponding methoxylated product, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, faradaic efficiencies were clearly increased using WO3 and TiO2 photoelectrode (>1% to 43% and >1% to 16%, respectively) by this two-step reaction (Table S3, ESI†) compared to the one-step reaction. Subsequently, preparative scale photoelectrolysis of furan in a two-compartment cell under photoirradiation was conducted, and then methoxylated product was also obtained with high yield (84%). These results suggest that such system is a useful method for effective methoxylation of furan to 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran with low applied potential.

(c) Br2: 1.7 mM, same as e−-mol of 5 C. Volume of MeCN: 30 ml (total amount of anolyte and catholyte); supporting electrolyte: 90 mM Et4NBF4 and 10 mM Et4NBr; working electrode: Pt disk electrode (φ = 1.6 mm); counter electrode: Pt wire; quasi-reference electrode: Ag wire; scan rate: 100 mV s−1. Photoelectrolysis was conducted in constant potential mode (0.5 V vs. SHE) using BiVO4/WO3 photoanode under photo irradiation (calibrated to AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). 
We have developed a photoelectrochemical oxidation system for the methoxylation of furan mediated by Br+/Br− using a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode. Compared with the conventional electrochemical method, the applied potential in this system could be decreased using solar energy. The efficiency was improved by adding Et4NBF4 as a co-supporting electrolyte with Et4NBr. The Photoelectrochemical dimethoxylation of furan was achieved in excellent faradaic efficiency up to 99% on the BiVO4/WO3 photoanode, which had moderate oxidation potential compared with other photoanodes such as WO3 and TiO2.
