Time-dependent experiments were carried out and the morphological evolution was discussed, which signposted that the present method corresponded to a typical Ostwald ripening process for the formation of bi-pyramid-like structures. Elemental mapping analysis confirms the incorporation and uniform distribution of all the elements. Phase purity and crystal structure of the as-synthesized phosphor were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results confirm that for scheelite tetragonal symmetry, F2 (ν3) modes of vibrations are IR active. (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 was demonstrated to be a good host material for down- and up-conversion luminescence, which were strongly dependent on the hydrothermal reaction time interval. The down-conversion luminescence properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 doped with Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+ were studied. Under 980 nm NIR excitation intense up-converted visible emissions were observed in (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, and Ho), which shows green (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+ at 525 nm), blue (1G4 → 3H6 of Tm3+ at 474 nm), and yellow (5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 of Ho3+ at 541 nm and 660 nm, respectively) luminescence. Also, Yb3+/Er3+-doped samples exhibit luminescence in the near infrared (combination of Er3+/Yb3+ at 977 nm, Er3+ at 1530 nm) region. The energy transfer process, fluorescence decay time, and colour coordinates were analyzed for both down- and up-conversion luminescence. Further, the magnetic properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu and Yb/Er) as-prepared bi-pyramid-like structure exhibit typical paramagnetic behavior.
1. Introduction
Synthesis of homogeneous and self-aggregated three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures has been undertaken in recent years, due to colossal scientific and technological interest in multifaceted research fields such as opto-electronics, high performance display devices, magneto-optics, catalysts, biological, and waste water treatment.1–6 Evolution of homogeneous and self-organized 3D micro/nanostructures through plane-to-plane conjunction of primary building blocks (1D and 2D nanoparticles) with controllable size and morphology has been paid remarkable attention, due to their novel physical and chemical properties. The peculiar micro/nanoscale structures of self-organized 3D networks have unique properties that are distinct from 0D primary nanoparticles, 1D nanorods, and/or 2D nanosheets. Subsequently, the properties of the materials usually have a very close correlation with 3D morphology, size distribution, and dimensionality which are particularly significant in the field of materials science. The progression of self-assembled architectures allows us to find neoteric and diversified materials, resulting in significant discovery that has been developed for the construction of a new class of micro- and nanostructured devices. Self-organization of inorganic micro/nanomaterials has proved to be a righteous and convenient tool to control the structure and properties for the fabrication of intricate architectures.
Investigation of analytical synthetic routes to control the formation of inorganic functional materials with intricate 3D structures through the medium of chemical self-assembly route still remains a hot research topic of investigation. To date a number of research works have been reported on controlled fabrication of 3D architectures including, hydrothermal,7,8 microwave synthesis,9 solvothermal,10,11 the Pechini process,12,13 molten salt synthesis,14 template-assisted,15 and co-precipitation methods,16etc. Among all, the hydrothermal route has been exclusively investigated as a promising alternative technique for the fabrication of 3D hierarchical structures under feasible conditions.17 A number of novel 3D versatile morphologies have been reported recently. For example, Huang et al. reported 3D bowknot-like Y2(WO4)3:Ln3+ hierarchical microstructures that were synthesized by a hydrothermal method.18 Lin et al. synthesized flower-like NaY(MoO4)2 microcrystals using the PVP mediated hydrothermal route.19 Xu et al. successfully synthesized tetragonal NaEu(MoO4)2 with self-assembled rugby-like microstructures using a hydrothermal route.20 Self-assembled flower-like NaCe(MoO4)2 architectures have been synthesized using a hydrothermal approach.6 Chrysanthemum-flower like Gd2O(CO3)2·H2O structures have been prepared by a modified urea-based homogeneous precipitation via a template free hydrothermal synthesis.21 Among various reaction parameters, the addition of a chelating agent or surfactant during the hydrothermal process is an effective way of regulating the germination of nuclei, the growth rate, and the oriented aggregation mechanism (which involves the spontaneous self-organization of neighbouring particles along a common crystallographic orientation of the micro/nanoparticles). A spacious class of 3D hierarchical architectures can be obtained by adding a suitable amount of surfactant which minimizes the particle–particle interaction by Steric effects thereby controlling the size and shape. It is well-known that disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) is a Lewis acid and the multidentate chelating ligand simultaneously forms more than one bond with the same metal atom/ion, and it complexes with numerous double, triple and quadruple charged cations.
Next generation-upconversion luminescence materials containing rare earth elements are currently being investigated because they efficiently convert low energy (infrared) to high energy (visible/UV radiation) which is hypersensitive to the composition and the crystal structure of the host lattice. Due to the strong electron–phonon coupling to the lattice, longer energy-storage lifetime, narrow emission bands and smaller quantum defects, they have prospective applications in luminescent phosphors, white light-emitting diodes,22 pumping of diode lasers,23 lumino-magnetic applications,24 solar cells,25 and temperature sensors.26 Not only that, also their infrared excitation is less harmful to human/animal cells, reduces auto-fluorescence from biological tissues, and penetrates to a deeper extent, photodamage to living organisms is reduced, which finds potential application in drug delivery,27 biological imaging,28 fingerprint detection, cancer therapy, and medical diagnostics.29,30 However, the luminous efficiency limits their applications to some extent and further improvement is needed for their potential applications. The most widely used up-conversion luminescence centers are Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+ ions, because they are convenient for pumping by near infrared (NIR) radiation to generate desired visible radiation by tuning the doping concentration. Yb3+ has the electronic configuration of 4f13, the so called resonant energy transfer donor ions, and acts as a sensitizer to improve the upconversion efficiency of the activators such as Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Nd3+ ions by energy transfer in various host materials.
According to the energy gap law, higher phonon energy vibrations result in quenching of luminescence.31 In order to minimize the non-radiative energy loss in rare-earth ions, host materials with lower phonon energy are required. Inorganic materials belonging to the molybdates or tungstates group with scheelite tetragonal crystal structure have a long history of practical application as the subject of vast research over the past decade. They possess thermally and photo-chemically stable phases. Due to lower vibrational frequency molybdates or tungstates are most widely used in opto-electronic applications which also exhibit intense and broad optical absorption bands in ultraviolet and visible regions. The compounds (Na0.5La0.5)MoO4 (NLM), and (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 (NGM), have a scheelite type crystal structure in which Mo6+ is occupied in the center of tetrahedral symmetry and Na+ and La3+/Gd3+ are distributed in the dodecahedral sites of the tetrahedral symmetry. The Na+ atoms and the La3+/Gd3+ atoms are randomly distributed in the compounds NLM and NGM over the same structural position, resulting in intense and broad absorption bands appearing near the UV-region which may find prospective applications in optoelectronics.32
In this article we report rare earth activated (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Yb/Er, Yb/Ho, and Yb/Tm) phosphors prepared by a simple surfactant-mediated hydrothermal route for luminescence (down-/up-conversion) and magnetic applications. The as-synthesized particles exhibit bi-pyramid-like microstructures which can be synthesized by keeping other parameters constant and changing the reaction time in the hydrothermal process. Elemental mapping investigations (attached with the FESEM-FEI Quanta) witness the preferential incorporation of rare-earth ions into the microstructures. Elemental mapping with EDS using a field emission scanning electron microscope further confirms the uniform distribution of all elements in the bi-pyramid-like structure. The structure, photoluminescence (down-/up-conversion) and magnetic properties of bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ were investigated. Furthermore, the possible energy transfer processes in up- and down-conversion luminescence were discussed in detail. Commission Internationale del'Eclairage (CIE) color chromaticity coordinates and fluorescence decay time measurements have been carried out. The as-obtained bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ structure could exhibit paramagnetic character and serve as an excellent phosphor candidate for down- and up-conversion luminescence. It can be also suitable for possible magnetic tracking of phosphor in biological applications.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (where Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Yb/Er, Yb/Ho, and Yb/Tm) bi-pyramidal-like structure
All the chemical reagents used in this synthesis procedure were of analytical grade with 99.9% purity. Synthesis of trivalent lanthanide ions doped (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 using the surfactant assisted hydrothermal route is similar to the method reported previously.6,33 By following the same synthesis procedure, bi-pyramidal-like microstructures of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 were synthesized here. Initially, Gd(NO3)3 and Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Yb, Er, Ho, and Tm) were prepared by dissolving stoichiometric amounts of Gd2O3 and Ln2O3 in dilute HNO3 solution by vigorous stirring, and subsequently dried at an elevated temperature until the rare earth nitrate solution was obtained. Then, Na2MoO4 was dissolved in 25 ml of double distilled water by vigorous stirring. The rare earth nitrate mixtures were carefully added drop-wise to the Na2MoO4 solution, and a white colloidal precipitate was obtained. Then, 1.5 mM of EDTA was dissolved in 20 mL of double-distilled water, and added to the resultant colloidal solution. The pH value of the final product was subsequently adjusted to a value of 7 to 8 by adding NaOH solution. After additional agitation for 30 minutes, the resultant solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon autoclave, sealed in a stainless steel vessel. The autoclave was maintained at 200 °C for 3–48 h. Furthermore, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally, the final product was collected and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C in air for 5 hours.
2.2 Characterization
The phase purity and crystallinity of the products were identified using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO materials research X-ray diffractometer (Almelo, The Netherlands) equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15406 nm) at a scanning rate of 0.02° s−1 in a 2θ range of 20–60°. Determination of the morphology of the samples, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and elemental mapping measurements were performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM-Quanta 3D FEG) operated at an acceleration voltage of 15–20 kV. Double-side carbon coating was applied to reduce the possible damage by the electron beam. The energy loss induced by the K, L shell electron ionization was detected for the mapping of Na, Gd, Mo, O, and Eu. The spacing between the two adjacent lattice planes was measured using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM JEOL 3010). FTIR measurements were carried out in a Nicolet 6700 FTIR (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. The DXR Raman microscope (Thermo Scientific) was used to perform the Raman spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, down-conversion PL emission spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Horiba-Jobin Yvon Fluromax-4P bench-top spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). Up-conversion luminescence spectra (980 nm NIR excitation from an optical parametric oscillator) and lifetimes of the excited state energy levels were recorded using a combination of a 0.25 m monochromator (CS-260; Oriel, Rochester, NY), photomultiplier tube (70680; Oriel, Stratford, CT), lock-in amplifier, and oscilloscope. A mechanical chopper was used to modulate the excitation beam. Room temperature magnetic properties of the samples were analyzed using (Lake Shore 7307 model) a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure investigation
The chemical purity and crystallinity of the product were analyzed using X-ray diffraction patterns. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the Na0.5Gd0.5MoO4:Eu3+ obtained at 24 h time interval in the presence of chelating agent EDTA at 200 °C at neutral pH (pH ∼ 7 to 8). The compound (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ crystallizes in the scheelite (CaWO4) structure (space group I41/a).34–36 In this tetragonal phase molybdenum atoms (Mo6+) occupy W sites located at the centers of tetrahedra and surrounded by four equivalent oxygen (O2−) atoms with two different bond angles α1(O–M–O) and α2(O–M–O).34 The degree of tetrahedral distortion is given by (1)The monovalent sodium (Na+) ions and trivalent gadolinium ions (Gd3+) are likely to occupy the dodecahedral Ca2+ sites in the tetrahedral symmetry with two different inter atomic distances (d, Å), 4d1(Na,R–O) and 4d2(Na,R–O).34 The degree of dodecahedral distortion is given by (2)

All peaks in the XRD pattern are perfectly indexed, which shows a pure tetragonal phase with scheelite structure and the (112), (004), (200), (204), (220), (116), (312) and (224) planes are in good agreement with the respective Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card No. 25–0828 of Na0.5Gd0.5MoO4. No peaks attributable to other types of molybdates are observed in the XRD patterns, indicating the high purity of the phases obtained. From the XRD pattern, a strong peak (112) is observed in contrast to other peaks, while the (224) peak is low.
3.2 Morphological evolution and the growth mechanism of bipyramid like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ structures
Homogeneous and self-organized 3D hierarchical networks with controllable shape and size can be obtained by using the well-known EDTA-mediated hydrothermal route through time-dependent morphological evolution. Morphology, dimensions, size, and distribution of elements (EELS) in as-synthesized particles of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope, clearly demonstrating the formation of bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ crystals with high yield. The surface morphology and dimensions of the self-organized hierarchical structures of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ purely depend on the reaction time. Upon increasing the reaction time there is a substantial change in the final product which consists of particles of various versatile morphologies and sizes. Fig. 2(a–d) and 3(a–d) show the low and high magnification FESEM images obtained at fixed temperature (200 °C), pH (7–8) and with fixed EDTA concentration (1.5 mM) at different time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h). It is well known that the building blocks for the growth of 3D micro/nanostructures basically include constituents such as 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanorods, and/or 2D nanosheets.

When the reaction was carried out for about 3 h, the SEM image (Fig. 2a) shows that particles made up of numerous and sharp rectangular 2D nanosheets with an average of 200 nm length and a few tens of nm thickness were observed which might be the initial stage for the formation of self-assembled 3D networks from tiny nuclei. It was observed that when the reaction time interval was increased to 6 h and 9 h, nanosheets began to self-organize continuously through plane-to-plane conjunction to form a spherical morphology (average diameter of 2.25 μm) and then prolate-sphere like structure (average length of the polar axis is 4.5 μm), respectively (Fig. 2b and c). By increasing the reaction time to 12 h, the nanosheets were further fused together strongly and they try to form bi-pyramid-like structure. However, the final product composed of particles with incomplete bi-pyramid structure coexisted and the homogeneous size distribution was not observed. The SEM image depicts clearly that particles with an average of 600 nm diameter and 1 μm length were observed (Fig. 2d). When the reaction time interval was prolonged to 18 h, the size distribution of the particles was much improved but still few particles had not grown completely. The SEM image shows particles with an average of 800 nm diameter and 1.3 μm length (Fig. 3a). The SEM image of the sample synthesized at 24 h shows a nearly bi-pyramid-like structure with an average of 1 μm diameter and 1.6 μm length (Fig. 3b and c). As the hydrothermal reaction growth period was prolonged to 48 h, the edges of the bi-pyramids expanded (Fig. 3d) and this may be due to elapsed time interval with thermal collision which leads to fragmentation of particles at the edges. The size distribution of particles was found to be not uniform. It can be clearly seen that reaction time plays a significant role in controlling the surface morphologies of the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ crystal structure. Based on the above time-dependent self-assembly, oriented attachment could be a governing process in the layer-by-layer self-organization of 2D nanosheets and leads to the formation of bi-pyramid-like microstructures. As the hydrothermal reaction time interval increases, the bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ could grow up continuously via a hierarchical self-assembly process which is related to the function of the chelating agent EDTA. The time-dependent morphological evolution of self-aggregated 3D networks could be well reported in the literature and described as a process of dissolution-nucleation-Ostwald ripening.20
At the first stage, Na2MoO4 solution was added into the rare-earth nitrate solution, and a white precipitate was formed. Second, when EDTA is introduced in the precipitating medium, it effectively capped the metal cations Na+, Gd3+/Eu3+ and forms a complex structure. Finally, a white colloidal solution is obtained at room temperature and EDTA can effectively change the surface characteristics of the absorbent. It is well known that disodium EDTA is a Lewis acid that consists of two amines and four carboxyl groups through which EDTA may cap the metal cations and form a complex structure.32,37,38 During the reaction between the EDTA molecule and the Na+, [Gd3+/Eu3+] ions, the donor atoms of EDTA successfully shield the metal cations (cage-like structure), so that the hydrogen ions present in EDTA can be replaced by the metal cations of group Na+ and [Gd/Eu]3+. The actual number of coordination sites depends on the size of the metal ions. EDTA forms a multidentate surface complex with metal ions only at greater pH values (above 6).39 The sequestering agent EDTA acts as a quadridentate ligand bonded with Na+, Gd3+/Eu3+, and finally a water soluble complex structure is formed. This leads to competition between the Na+ and [Gd3+/Eu3+] with [H2L2−]. With the increase in the reaction temperature to 200 °C, Na+, Gd3+/Eu3+ ions could have been gradually released from the intermediate EDTA complexes, and these react with MoO42− and thus form (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ nuclei slowly. Initially, tiny crystalline nuclei formed in a supersaturated solution act as the nuclei for further growth of crystals and a bigger particle grows at the expense of smaller crystals as described by the Gibbs–Thomson equation40 Sr = Sbexp(2σVm/rRT)(3)where σ is the specific surface energy; Vm is the molar volume of the material; r is the radius of the crystal; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; and Sb and Sr are the solubility of the bulk crystal and crystal with radius r, respectively. The bi-pyramid-like structures were formed by the aggregation of 2D nanosheets in an oriented manner with a subsequent ripening of the aggregates.
The formation of such bi-pyramid-like micro structures occurs via a typical Ostwald ripening process through the instant growth of 2D nanosheets into ordered hierarchical 3D architectures. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) confirms the presence of Gd, Eu, Na, Mo, and O in the product (Fig. 3e). The TEM image of the sample prepared at 24 h time interval with 1.5 mM of EDTA concentration is shown in Fig. 4a and the inset of Fig. 4a shows the FFT pattern.
 Fig. 4  (a) TEM image of the sample prepared at 24 h time interval (inset the corresponding FFT pattern), (b) HRTEM image (inset typical HRTEM image taken on the marked part). 
The HRTEM image of bi-pyramid-like structure illustrates (Fig. 4b) the lattice spacing of 0.3248 nm corresponding to the (200) plane of the tetragonal crystal structure and the inset of Fig. 4b shows the HRTEM image taken on the marked part. Most of the previous work suggested that Eu3+ ions are incorporated into the crystal structure. This was further evidenced using elemental mapping analysis and FESEM. Relative distributions of several important elements (Na, Gd, Mo, O, and Eu) in the bi-pyramid-like structure were analysed. Fig. 5 clearly depicts the incorporation of rare earth ions and their distribution inside the bi-pyramidal structure.

3.3 FTIR spectral analysis
It is well known that FTIR is a unique tool used to identify the functional groups and frequency of vibration between the bonds with the atoms in the crystal lattice. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the FTIR transmittance spectrum of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ obtained in the range of 500 to 4000 cm−1. Marques et al. reported that for tetrahedral symmetry, F2 (ν3) modes of vibrations are IR active.41 Our results show that the strong absorption bands at 798 cm−1, and 708 cm−1 are related to the stretching vibrations of O–Mo–O in the MoO42− tetrahedron.42 These absorption bands were assigned to the antisymmetric stretch F2 (ν3) of the scheelite tetragonal crystalline structure. The peak at 2924 cm−1 is attributed to the adsorption of the carboxylate group on the surface of the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ microstructures.43 The weak absorption at 1626 cm−1 is assigned to H–O–H bending vibration of the absorbed water from air.44 In addition, the wide and weak bands corresponding to O–H stretching vibrations were observed at around 3405 cm−1.
3.4. Visible and NIR emission properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+

3.4.1 DC luminescence properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+) bi-pyramid-like structure. 
The scheelite tetragonal phase (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ crystal structure exhibits similar PL properties to that of Eu3+ doped other molybdate ions reported in the literature32,45 and is expected to be a promising phosphor candidate. Fig. S3(a–c) (ESI†) shows the room temperature (RT) excitation spectra of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 doped with Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+. Fig. 6 shows the RT PL emission spectra (λex = 394 nm) of the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ samples prepared at different time intervals at 200 °C with fixed EDTA concentration and were recorded. The PL emission spectrum of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ shows a number of characteristic intra-configurational f–f transitions of Eu3+ which are associated with the transition from the excited level to 5D0 to the ground levels of 7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3 and 4) and are purely time dependent. While exciting with 394 nm UV irradiation, the emission spectra are dominated by the hypersensitive red emission (614 nm), showing parity forbidden f–f (ΔJ = 2) transition 5D0 → 7F2 (due to electric-dipole transition). The other transitions, 5D0 → 7F1 (magnetic-dipole transition), 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4, are found to be relatively very weak for all the samples prepared at different time intervals. It is noticed that the emission peak at 614 nm consists of two sub peaks due to Stark energy splitting, that is the (2J + 1) Stark components of J-degeneracy splitting.46 The presence of electric dipole transition confirms that Eu3+ ions are located at sites without inversion symmetry.
 Fig. 6  Room temperature emission spectra of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ samples prepared at different time intervals at 200 °C by the EDTA-assisted hydrothermal route. 
In the present case, (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ belongs to tetragonal structure, and Eu3+ ions possess C3v site symmetry. It is thus observed that emission intensity of the samples after aging for a long time period is higher than after aging for a short time period.47 This is because the product synthesized after aging for a long period shows improved crystallization compared to shorter time intervals. The PL emission intensity increases with increase in the reaction time interval and reaches its maximum at 24 h due to the continuous growth of crystallites. While the reaction time further increases to 48 h, the PL emission intensity decreases due to elapsed time interval with thermal collision between the particles resulting in fragmentation of particles.32
Practically lower doping concentration of Eu3+ gives weak luminescent intensity and is unsuitable for making display devices. Also, the higher doping concentration of Eu3+ will result in quenching of luminescence. So the optimum concentration of Eu3+ must play an important role in the host lattice. From Fig. 7a it was observed that when the Eu3+ doping concentration increases, the luminescence intensity also increases and reaches a maximum of x = 0.06 moles. The concentration of Eu3+ increased from 0.02 to 0.06 moles which promotes more energy to 5D0 → 7F2 (hypersensitive) transition to obtain bright red emission. Hence, the charge transfer to Eu3+ would become more probable, leading to the enhancement of luminescence emission in (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ microstructures. Upon further increasing the doping concentration of Eu3+ to 0.08 and 0.10 moles the luminescence intensity was decreased and resulted in quenching of emission.

Fig. 8a shows the PL emission spectra of bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Tb3+ structure that consists of sharp lines in the wavelength range from 450 nm to 650 nm. It is well known that Tb3+ has the electronic configuration of 4f8 with the 7F6 ground state. Upon excitation by (λex) 294 nm, the sample exhibits four peaks centred at around 486, 542, 587 and 620 nm due to the characteristic green luminescence originating from the transitions between the excited 5D4 level to ground levels of the 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) terbium ion, respectively. The emission spectrum of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Tb3+ was dominated at 542 nm which is assigned to the transition 5D4 → 7F5 that shows the highest among the all other transitions such as 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F4 and 5D4 → 7F3.45 Due to Stark energy splitting, the emission peak (dominant) consists of two sub peaks which are also observed in the case of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+.

The emission spectra of bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Dy3+ structures were recorded upon 390 nm UV excitation under the same experimental conditions. Fig. 8b depicts the PL emission spectra of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Dy3+ which consists of two dominant bands mainly due to transition of Dy3+ ions. It is well known that Dy3+ has the electronic configuration, 4f9 with 6H15/2. The yellow line (centered at 570 nm) originates from excited 4F9/2 levels of Dy3+ ions to the ground level 6H13/2 which belongs to forced electric dipole transition. The blue line (centered at 482 nm) is assigned to the transition of 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 which corresponds to magnetic dipole transition. The emission intensity of 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 transition is much higher than that of 4F9/2 → 6H15/2. Hence, this suggests that Dy3+ ions mainly occupy the lattice site without inversion symmetry.48 Under excitation of 390 nm, the Y/B (yellow to blue line) ratio of the two transitions 4F9/2 → 6H13/2 and 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 was found to be 4.6074, which find potential applications in the field of opto-electronics. Fig. S4 (ESI†) represents the possible energy transfer process from molybdate (MoO42−) to all the observed emissive transitions of Tb3+ and Dy3+, respectively, well reported in the literature.49,50 Generally, MoO42− has a higher tendency to receive more electrons from an oxygen ligand, so that lower energy is sufficient for the ligand-to-metal charge transfer state (LMCT). Upon UV illumination, the energy is transferred from charge-transfer states (ligand to metal) of MoO42− to unexcited 7FJ levels of Tb3+ and 6H15/2 levels of Dy3+, respectively. Then, corresponding visible emission transitions of Ln3+ (Tb3+, Dy3+) are clearly seen while relaxed to the ground state. A detailed description of the energy transfer mechanism in the Eu3+ singly doped system was provided in our previous work.45


3.4.2 Up-conversion luminescence properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, and Ho). 

Fig. 9a shows the up-conversion luminescence spectra of the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:0.05Yb3+/yEr3+ (where y = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 moles) 3D bi-pyramid-like structure under 980 nm excitation.
 Fig. 9  (a) Up-conversion luminescence spectra of bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:0.05Yb3+/yEr3+ (where y = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 moles, respectively) prepared at 200 °C for 24 h, (b) corresponding CIE diagram, (c) representative example of the pump power dependence of green and red emissions in the 0.05Yb3+/0.03Er3+ doped sample. 
The PL spectra consists of three up-converted visible light emission peaks at 525 nm (Green), 550 nm (Green) and 653 nm (Red) assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. The intensity of the emission peak centered at 525 nm is much stronger than the other two emission peaks at 550 nm and 653 nm for all the doping concentrations. Similar results have also been found in the NaLn(MoO4)2 sub-micron crystals synthesized by a hydrothermal method.51 The influence of doping concentration on (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Er3+ was investigated and is shown in Fig. 9a. The upconverted emission intensity increases with increase of Er3+ concentration and reaches a maximum at 0.03 moles of Er3+. Due to the concentration-quenching effect, the emission intensity decreased when the doping concentration reached above 0.03 moles of Er3+. Wang et al. reported that the distribution of erbium ions on the surface is of greater fraction than that of the interior of the micro/nanoparticle.52 Hence, the interaction between the erbium ion and its surrounding crystal lattice becomes weaker due to isotropic coordination of erbium ions with higher symmetry. As a result, the emission from hypersensitive transition 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 is stronger than the other two transitions. The red emission from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition is very weak also due to the efficient cross-relaxation of 4I11/2 + 2G7/2 → 4F7/2 + 2H11/2/4S3/2 between Er3+ ions.51
Furthermore, the NIR and IR emission was measured by exciting the sample at 980 nm and 1.53 μm, respectively. Under 1.53 μm excitation, a broad NIR emission band centered at 977 nm (Fig. 10a) is observed which is attributed to the combination of both Er3+ and Yb3+ and the corresponding emissions are 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 (Er3+) and 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 (Yb3+), respectively. Also, under 980 nm laser excitation, a significant inhomogeneous broadening is observed at 1530 nm which is ascribed to the IR emission from 4I13/2 to 4I15/2 of Er3+ ions.
 Fig. 10  (a) NIR emission spectra of (λem = 977 nm) of Yb3+/Er3+ codoped (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4, (b) 1.53 μm NIR emission spectra of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:(0.05 M)Yb3+/(0.03 M)Er3+. 

Fig. 10b shows that the luminescence spectral profiles at 1.53 μm emission could effectively explain that Yb3+ is a good sensitizer to the fluorescence of Er3+ in the infrared region. The laser excitation (1.53 μm) populates the 4I11/2 (Er3+), 2F5/2 (Yb3+) levels via ground state absorption by the 4I15/2 (Er3+), 2F7/2 (Yb3+) levels, respectively. The excited 2F5/2 (Yb3+) level promotes more energy to the level 4I11/2 (Er3+) via energy transfer and subsequently relaxed to the level 2F7/2 (Yb3+). Finally, the populated level 4I11/2 (Er3+) decays radiatively to the 4I15/2 (Er3+) ground state directly. As a result, the emission band was observed at 977 nm. The spectroscopic feature of Er3+ emission is related to the Stark splitting of the energy levels. For the 1.53 μm emission the related energy levels are 4I13/2 and 4I15/2. Several well-known mechanisms such as ground-state absorption (GSA), excited-state absorption (ESA), successive energy transfer (ET), photon avalanche (PA), and cross-relaxation (CR) processes can be used to analyze the up-conversion of visible emission and NIR emission of 4f levels in rare earth ions.
In order to understand the fundamental UC mechanisms, the luminescence intensities of the green emission peak (centered at 525 nm) and the red emission peak (centered at 653 nm) have been calculated as a function of pump power density. The up-converted emission intensity is proportional to the nth power of the infra-red excitation intensity, and integer n is the number of the infra-red laser photon absorbed per up-converted visible photon emission and is given by Iem ∝ (Iexp)n(4)
From Fig. 9c the slope of a straight line was obtained by fitting the double logarithmic plot of pump power density versus upconversion emission intensity. In (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:0.05Yb3+/0.03Er3+ the value of n for the up-converted green and red emission bands was found to be 3.02 and 2.09, respectively. This illustrates that the upconversion mechanism occurring via three-photon and two-photon processes might be involved in the population of 2H11/2 levels and 4F9/2, respectively.
Under 980 nm infra-red laser radiation, intense up-converted visible emission spectrum was observed for (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+(0.05 M)/Tm3+(0.03 M) as shown in Fig. 11a. Three energy transfer transitions are involved, while the pump light excites the Yb3+ ions and the energy is transferred from Yb3+ ions to Tm3+ ions which populate 1G4 and 3F3 levels. The peak is centered at 474 nm of the blue emission, and two red emission bands at 649 nm and 693 nm corresponding to transitions of 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4 and 3F3 → 3H6, Tm3+ ions appear, respectively. From the emission spectrum it is seen that the intensity of the narrow blue emission peak originates from the transition of 1G4 → 3H6, monitored at 474 nm higher than the other two peaks. Due to the large energy mismatch between Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions, the 1D2 of Tm3+ cannot be populated so the transitions 1D2 → 3F4 and 1D2 → 1G4 are not observed. The 1D2 of Tm3+ ions can be populated by increasing the doping concentration of Tm3+ ions. Because the doping concentration of Tm3+ ions determines the population of the 1D2 level, due to the efficient cross-relaxation process between Tm3+ ions. Wang et al. reported that the 1D2 level of Tm3+ can be populated by the well-known cross-relaxation processes 3F2 + 3H4 → 3H6 + 1D2 and 1G4 + 3H4 → 3F4 + 1D2 and the UC emission intensity increases by increasing the doping concentration of Tm3+ ions.53
 Fig. 11  NIR-to-visible upconverted emission of (a) (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Tm3+, (b) (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ho3+. 

Fig. 11b shows the up-converted visible emission spectrum of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+(0.05 M)/Ho3+(0.03 M) under 980 nm laser irradiation. The green emission peak centered at 541 nm can be assigned to the 5S2 → 5I8 transition, and the red emission peak at 660 nm may originate from the 5F5 → 5I8 transition. The phosphor (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+(0.05 M)/Ho3+(0.03 M) exhibit yellowish colour due to the presence of red and green emission bands. According to the energy gap law, vibrational frequency of the host matrix is 5 times smaller than that of the gap of an energy state in an activator (Ho3+), and non-radiative transitions cannot occur.54,55 The (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ho3+ matrix has a phonon vibration frequency of about 798 cm−1 and the energy gap between the 5F4/5S2 and 5F5 levels in Ho3+ is about 3000 cm−1. This shows that three or four intrinsic phonons are needed to bridge the gap between 5F4/5S2 → 5F5 levels and hence non-radiative transitions occur. Due to the aforesaid reason the up-converted red emission is more intense than up-converted green emission in the case of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ho3+.


3.4.3 Up-conversion energy level scheme of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, and Ho). 
The electronic energy levels of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, and Ho) and the possible up-conversion luminescence mechanism under infrared excitation are depicted in Fig. 12 which coincides with the results of Huang et al.18 Under 980 nm infrared radiation on (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Er3+, ytterbium ions are first populated from the unexcited 2F7/2 level to the excited 2F5/2 level through the ground-state absorption process (GSA). Also, the pump light excites some of the Er3+ ions to enable the transition from the ground level 4I15/2 to the 4I11/2 excited level. This happens because the energy levels of 2F7/2 and 4I15/2 are closer. Second, the populated level of 2F5/2 in Yb3+ promotes more energy to the excited 4I11/2 level of Er3+via energy transfer (ET). Further, the 4F7/2 level of Er3+ is populated from 4I11/2 of Er3+ through the excited-state absorption (ESA) process. Immediately, the excited 4F7/2 level of Er3+ non-radiatively decays into the 2H11/2 level. Some of the Er3+ ions in the level 2H11/2 non-radiatively decay to the 4S3/2 level, which further relaxes to 4F9/2 levels of Er3+. Finally, the levels 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 radiatively transfer their energy to the ground level 4I15/2 by emitting up-converted green light photons with a wavelength of 525 nm and 550 nm respectively. Also, the radiative relaxation occurs from the excited 4F9/2 level to the 4I15/2 ground level, which results in up-converted red emission with weak intensity.
 Fig. 12  The possible upconversion energy level scheme (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, and Ho) under 980 nm NIR excitation. 
For (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ the pump light excites with 980 nm, first 2F7/2 ground levels of Yb3+ ions and 3H6 ground levels of Tm3+ ions are elevated to the 2F5/2 level (Yb3+) and the 3H5 level (Tm3+), respectively. Then, the populated 2F5/2 levels of Yb3+ ions non-resonantly transfer their energy to the 3H5 level. The level 3H5 of Tm3+ ions non-radiatively depopulates to the 3F4 level. The 3F4 Tm3+ ions can also absorb the energy from another Yb3+ ion and can be further excited to the 3F2 level. The 3F2 level decays to the 3F3 level and the 3H4 level, respectively. Then the 3F3 level depopulates to 3H6 ground levels by emitting weak red light. Also, some of the Tm3+ ions in the state 3F2 relax to the 3H4 state. The 1G4 level of Tm3+ can be populated through excited state absorption of the 3H4 level of Tm3+, which plays an important role in blue emission. Finally, the up-converted blue emission is generated from depopulation of the 1G4 level to 3H6 levels in Tm3+ ions. The transition from the 1G4 level to 3F4 generates weak red emission.
In the case of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ho3+, the green and red emissions originated due to ground state absorption (GSA) from level 5I8 to 5I6 of Ho3+ ions and 2F7/2 to 2F5/2 levels of Yb3+ ions. The 5I6 (Ho3+) level is populated due to successive energy transfer from 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and 5I8 (Ho3+), respectively. Furthermore, the Ho3+ ions in the 5I6 level are populated to the 5S2 level through excited state absorption by another photon (ESA) as well as energy transfer from the 2F5/2 (Yb3+) level. Subsequently, some of the Ho3+ ions in the 5I6 level non-radiatively depopulate into the 5I7 level. Also, the 5F5 Ho3+ level is populated by the energy transfer process from the 5I7 (Ho3+) and 2F5/2 (Yb3+) levels, respectively. Finally, the populated 5S2 and 5F5 levels are relaxed into 5I8 ground levels of Ho3+ (also the 5S2 level non-radiatively relaxed to 5F5) by radiatively emitting up-converted green and red light.


3.4.4 Lifetime and CIE chromaticity measurements. 
All the luminescence decay curves are fitted well with the single exponential function given by (5)where I0 is the intensity at time t = 0 and the corresponding decay life time is denoted as τ. The down-conversion PL decay curves of as-prepared (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 3D hierarchical structure doped with Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ can be fitted into a single exponential function and given in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The estimated lifetime values are found to be 0.429 ms, 0.402 ms and 0.416 ms for Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+ doped with (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 microstructures, respectively. In addition, the emission decay curve of 525 nm up-converted green emission from Er3+ due to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition in (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Er3+ under 980 nm excitation is shown in Fig. 13a. The estimated lifetime was determined to be 9.8 μs. The observed decay curve of the major blue emission is due to 1G4 → 3H6 transition at 474 nm in (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ and the lifetime is determined to be 19.4 μs and shown in Fig. 13b. Fig. 13c shows the fluorescence decay curve of 5F5 → 5I8 transition of holmium ions with a lifetime of 21.7 μs.
 Fig. 13  Decay profile of (a) 525 nm emission in Na0.5Gd0.5MoO4:Yb3+/Er3+, (b) 474 nm emission in Na0.5Gd0.5MoO4:Yb3+/Tm3+, (c) 660 nm emission in (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ho3+ under 980 nm NIR excitation, respectively, and (d) their corresponding CIE chromaticity diagram. 
All the chromaticity coordinates are calculated by using the CIE 1931 color matching functions. The color chromaticity coordinates (x, y) were calculated for (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 microstructures doped with Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+ and indicated as A, B, C, respectively and shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The chromaticity co-ordinates are found to be x = 0.589, y = 0.334 for (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ (λex = 395 nm), x = 0.232, y = 0.625 for (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Tb3+ (λex = 294 nm) and x = 0.386, y = 0.433, for (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Dy3+. Under 980 nm laser excitation the CIE chromaticity coordinates of the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, and Ho) phosphors were calculated based on their corresponding up-conversion luminescence spectra which are shown in Fig. 13d. The CIE chromaticity coordinates for Yb3+/Er3+ (a), Yb3+/Tm3+ (b), Yb3+/Tm3+ (c) doped (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 phosphors were found to be (x = 0.178, y = 0.766), (x = 0.153, y = 0.145), (x = 0.394, y = 0.510), respectively. These coordinates are found to be located in the green, blue, and red regions of the CIE chromaticity diagram, respectively (marked as A, B, and C). The photometric parameters of as-synthesized phosphor were estimated using spectral energy distribution functions of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The novel 3D (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ microstructures would be promising materials which expands their potential in up-/down-conversion luminescence applications, optoelectronics, low-dimensional physics and materials science, biological technology.

3.5. Magnetic properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu and Yb/Er)
As a representative result, RT magnetic properties of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Yb, and Er) of phosphor were also investigated. Fig. 14 shows the magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field (from −2000 Oe to 2000 Oe) using a vibrating sample magnetometer for both the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+, (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Er3+ samples prepared by the hydrothermal route at 24 h time intervals. From the figure it is clear that a straight line crosses the origin, indicating that the phosphor (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu and Yb/Er) exhibits a paramagnetic behaviour due to the presence of paramagnetic Gd3+ ions.24 The highly localized nature of the seven unpaired inner 4f electrons in Gd plays a significant role which also determines its magnetic properties. These unpaired electrons in the outer orbital are closely bound to the nucleus and effectively shielded by the outer closed shell electrons 5s2 5p6 from the crystal field.56,57 The interaction among the Gd3+ ions in the crystal structure (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 is weak and hence insufficient overlap of the orbitals associated with 4f shells gives rise to paramagnetism.
 Fig. 14  Magnetization vs. magnetic field of the as-synthesized bi-pyramid-like structures of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, and Yb/Er) synthesized by hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 24 h. 
The saturation magnetization value of (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ is relatively high (0.8695 emu g−1) compared to the (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Yb3+/Er3+ (0.64430 emu g−1). This is because spins in the Gd3+ sub-lattice were immobilized by the spins in the Ln3+ sub-lattice and hence the pinned spins were unable to align with the direction of applied magnetic field which determines the net magnetization value. Even though the observed magnetisation is small this phosphor can also find great potential application as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) contrast agent.58,59
4. Conclusion
In summary, a well-crystallized product (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Yb, Er, Tm, and Ho) was successfully synthesized by the EDTA-assisted hydrothermal route. The time-dependent morphological evolution of 3D hierarchical structure suggested that the formation mechanism of the bipyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 morphology resembles the typical Ostwald ripening process. The compound (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 (NGM) possesses scheelite type crystal structure with space group I41/a in which Mo6+ occupies the center of tetrahedral symmetry and Na+ and Gd3+/Ln3+ are distributed in the dodecahedral sites of the tetrahedral symmetry. Elemental mapping analysis confirms the presence of all the elements in the bi-pyramid-like microstructure. From the FTIR spectra, the metal (Mo) to oxygen (O) vibrational bands identified in the region of 798 cm−1 and 708 cm−1 which corresponds to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of O–Mo–O in the MoO42− tetrahedron. Upon 980 nm NIR laser pumping, the bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4 doped with Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ exhibits strong green, blue, and yellow UC luminescence, respectively. The possible energy transfer mechanism of both down-conversion and up-conversion luminescence was discussed in detail. The upconversion mechanism suggested that the energy is effectively transferred from the sensitizer (Yb3+) to the activator (Er, Tm, Ho) through the multiphoton process. The as-synthesized phosphor not only exhibits down- and up-conversion visible luminescence but also exhibits the characteristic emission spectra in the near infra red region. RT magnetic properties of the bi-pyramid-like (Na0.5Gd0.5)MoO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, and Yb/Er) phosphor clearly display the paramagnetic behavior, which finds potential applications in the magnetic tracking of phosphor for biological applications.
