    , Accepted 14th June 2018First published on 15th June 2018AbstractFerroelectric photovoltaics (FPVs) have drawn much attention owing to their high stability, environmental safety, and anomalously high photovoltages, coupled with reversibly switchable photovoltaic responses. However, FPVs suffer from extremely low photocurrents, which is primarily due to their wide band gaps. Here, we present a new class of FPVs by demonstrating switchable ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and narrow band-gap properties using hexagonal ferrite (h-RFeO3) thin films, where R denotes rare-earth ions. FPVs with narrow band gaps suggest their potential applicability as photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. The h-RFeO3 films further exhibit reasonably large ferroelectric polarizations (4.7–8.5 μC cm−2), which possibly reduces a rapid recombination rate of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of h-RFeO3 thin-film devices is sensitive to the magnitude of polarization. In the case of the h-TmFeO3 (h-TFO) thin film, the measured PCE is twice as large as that of the BiFeO3 thin film, a prototypic FPV. The effect of electrical fatigue on FPV responses has been further investigated. This work thus demonstrates a new class of FPVs towards high-efficiency solar cell and optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
Ferroelectric photovoltaics (FPVs) have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their unique properties that are not found in conventional photovoltaics. In typical semiconductor solar cells, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs are separated by the built-in field in the p–n junction, and the photovoltage is limited by the band gap. However, in polar materials with the absence of inversion symmetry, photocurrents can be generated under uniform illumination owing to the noncentrosymmetry of their crystal structures, which is called the bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect.1–5 Ferroelectrics further shows anomalous photovoltaic effects that the photovoltage can reach several tens of thousands of volts, exceeding the band gap.3–7 FPVs are mostly oxide-based and thus have the advantages of long-term stability and environmental safety. Moreover, FPVs show a reversibly switchable photovoltaic effect by changing the polarization direction with the aid of a bias electric field.8–11
Until recently, the FPV effect has remained an academic interest rather than having practical applications owing to the extremely low photocurrent densities of FPVs in the order of nA cm−2–μA cm−2.9–13 The observed very low photocurrent density, which is the main drawback of FPVs, is primarily attributed to the wide band-gap (Eg) characteristics of typical ferroelectric materials applied to FPV devices: Eg of ∼2.7 eV for BiFeO3 (BFO),10 ∼3.6 eV for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT),14 and ∼3.5 eV for BaTiO3.15 Consequently, extensive studies have been conducted to reduce Eg by using suitable chemical modifications. However, this type of band-gap tuning usually leads to the deterioration of ferroelectric or dielectric properties.16 Notwithstanding the band-gap problems, the research activity of FPVs has been stimulated by three recent breakthroughs: (i) achievement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.1% by the band-gap tuning of Bi2(Fe,Cr)O6 ferroelectric multilayers,17 (ii) attainment of the PCE exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit in a BaTiO3 single crystal,18 and (iii) observation of pronounced switchable photovoltaic effects in hybrid trihalide perovskite devices.19–21 For these reasons, investigations on ferroelectric-based photovoltaics are being actively carried out not only using inorganic oxide materials but also using organic–inorganic hybrid materials.22–43
Herein, we present the switchable photovoltaic effects observed in a new class of FPVs, hexagonal rare-earth ferrite thin films. These ferrite materials (h-RFeO3; R = Y, Dy–Lu) tend to have a narrow band gap, which is in sharp contrast to typical ferroelectric materials having wide band gaps10,14,15, and suggests their potential applicability as photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. We found that the PCE of h-RFeO3 thin-film devices is sensitive to the magnitude of ferroelectric polarization. We have elucidated that the switchable photovoltaic effect dominates over the unswitchable internal field effect which arises from the net built-in potential developed in the ITO/h-RFeO3/Pt heterojunction. We have further investigated the effect of electrical fatigue on the photovoltaic responses of the hexagonal ferrite devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Fabrication of thin-film heterojunction devices
An epitaxial Pt(111) film adopted as the bottom-electrode layer was grown on an Al2O3(0001) substrate using RF magnetron sputtering. The pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method was then used for the fabrication of hexagonal RFeO3 (h-RFO hereafter) films on a Pt(111)/Al2O3(0001) substrate at a laser energy density of 1.5 J cm−2 with a repetition rate of 5 Hz. The substrate was maintained at 830 °C. For the fabrication of solar cells having an ITO/h-RFO/Pt heterojunction structure, transparent ITO top electrodes were deposited by PLD through a shadow mask with circular apertures (100–200 μm in diameter).
2.2. Characterization studies of thin-film devices
We have performed structural analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm the hexagonal phase as well as the in-plane epitaxy in the PLD grown h-RFO film layer. P–E hysteresis-loop measurements and electrical-fatigue tests were performed by using a Precision LC system (Radiant Technologies, Inc.). 15 μs-wide pulses with a period of 1 ms were used to electrically fatigue the sample. Atomic-scale structures of h-LuFeO3 and h-TmFeO3 (hereafter h-LFO and h-TFO, respectively) thin films were examined by employing the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy method (JEM-ARM200F, JEOL with a Cs-corrector) under 200 kV acceleration voltage. For an experimental study of the optical bandgap, optical absorption spectra were recorded as a function of photon energy using a double-beam UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (JASCOV-570). Ultraviolet photoelectron-spectroscopy (UPS; AXIS Ultra DLD) measurements were used to estimate the work functions, the Fermi energies, and the valence-band edges. UPS measurements were carried out using He I (21.22 eV) photon lines from a discharge lamp. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to measure the O 1s signal of h-RFO thin films having some oxygen-vacancy defects. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a source meter (Compactstat, IVIUM tech.) under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Sun 3000, Abet tech.). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (as a reference) equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG-5, Schott).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Epitaxial film growth and ferroelectricity
Theta–2theta X-ray diffraction (θ–2θ XRD) patterns show that both PLD-grown h-TFO and h-LFO films (∼250 nm-thin) are highly c-axis oriented (Fig. 1a) on a Pt(111)/Al2O3(0001) substrate. The phi-scan spectra further reveal that h-LFO, h-TFO and Pt layers are all epitaxially grown with a six-fold hexagonal symmetry (Fig. 1b). This indicates the absence of in-plane 30°-rotation during the growth, often observed in hexagonal thin films.44 The phi-scan patterns were obtained by keeping the Bragg angle at (112) for h-RFO and (200) for Pt. The hexagonal structure of h-RFO having a noncentrosymmetric P63cm crystal symmetry is shown in Fig. 1c. The polar structure of h-RFO is characterized by (i) the RO8 units having a trigonal D3d site symmetry and (ii) the FeO5 bipyramids with the D3h site symmetry.45–48 The asymmetric vertical shift of rare-earth ions (R) with respect to the two neighboring apical oxygen ions is known to be the origin of the c-axis-oriented ferroelectricity in h-RFO.45–48

The room-temperature polarization-electric field (P–E) curves (Fig. 1d) demonstrate that the remanent polarization (Pr) is ∼4.7 μC cm−2 for the h-LFO film and ∼8.5 μC cm−2 for the h-TFO film. These Pr values are comparable to the previously reported values for h-RFO films.47,48 These polarization values seem to be large enough to separate the photo-generated electron–hole pairs in a photovoltaic material. We have further confirmed the epitaxial growth of the h-LFO film by using the high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) method. The HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1e) shows a characteristic ‘up-up-down’ displacement of Lu atoms, which indicates a non-zero net polarization of the h-LFO film along the c-axis.49 The corresponding SAED pattern is shown in Fig. 1f. The zone axis [110] is parallel to the corresponding diffraction plane for the XRD, i.e., (00l), which indicates that the h-LFO film is aligned along the hexagonal c-axis. Exactly the same types of HAADF-STEM image and SAED pattern were observed in the epitaxially grown h-TFO film.
3.2. Band gap and solar absorption rate
Ultraviolet–visible-near infrared absorption spectra of h-LFO and h-TFO are shown in Fig. 2a as a function of photon energy. The optical band gap (Eg) of h-RFO is evaluated by adopting the Tauc plot (Fig. 2b) of the absorption spectra. The Tauc model is represented by (αE)1/n ∝ A(E − Eg), where α is the absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy (hν), Eg is the optical band gap, and A is the photon-energy-dependent constant.50 The power-law exponent, n, depends on the transition type, where n = 1/2 for a direct band-gap-allowed transition and n = 2 for an indirect band-gap-allowed transition. According to the previous experimental studies,51,52h-RFO can be classified as a direct band-gap material. Currently, the Eg values of h-RFO are under debate and two distinct values of Eg are reported for h-RFO: ∼1.1 eV (ref. 51) and ∼2.0 eV.52,53 Our optical absorption spectra (Fig. 2a) indicate that the first Eg at ∼1.1 eV is featured by a broad weak peak in the near-infrared region, whereas the second Eg at ∼2.1 eV corresponds to the onset of strong optical absorption in the visible region. Accordingly, we have performed the Tauc plot for a direct band-gap transition (n = 1/2)51,52 in the vicinity of two characteristic photon-energies. As shown in Fig. 2b, the intrinsic band gap51 corresponding to the onset of weak absorption is about 1.2 eV:1.18 eV for h-LFO and 1.25 eV for h-TFO. On the other hand, the photon energy corresponding to the onset of strong optical absorption is evaluated to be ∼2.08 eV:2.07 eV for h-LFO and 2.09 eV for h-TFO (Fig. 2c).

(f) Thickness-dependent solar absorption (%) curves for h-LFO, h-TFO, and BFO films. 
The computed electronic band structures of h-LFO and h-TFO are shown in Fig. 2d and e, respectively. Herein, we have adopted the GGA+Ueff method54 with the Hubbard Ueff of 3.5 eV to evaluate the exchange–correlation functional. The optimal value of Ueff is chosen by comparing the computed Eg with the experimental value (∼1.2 eV). However, the band-gap calculations by DFT are not reliable, in general,55 owing to the inability of correct evaluation of the exchange–correlation energy. The purpose of our band-structure calculation is to examine whether h-RFOs can be viewed as direct band-gap materials or not. According to the computed band structure shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e), h-RFO can be viewed as a direct band gap material, i.e., inter-band transition at the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone. This prediction is supported by the previous experimental report.51 Accordingly, we used n = 1/2 in our evaluation of Eg. Here, the conduction band minimum is represented by Fe 3d states while the valence band maximum is described by the hybridization of Fe 3dz2 and O 2pz states. Thus, the Eg of h-RFOs originates mainly from the Fe d–d transitions.51–53
In Fig. 2f, we compare the thickness-dependent solar absorption of h-LFO and h-TFO with that of BFO, a prototypic FPV. Here, the fractional amount of solar absorption is calculated using the solar irradiance and absorption coefficient data given in Fig. 2a. The equation of solar absorption used in our evaluation is given by56 (1)where Sλ is the spectral distribution of the solar irradiance (in W m−2 nm−1), λ is the solar wavelength (in nm), α is the absorption coefficient (in nm−1), and d is the film thickness (in nm). At a film thickness of 250 nm, the solar absorption rate of the h-LFO film is 1.6 times bigger than that of the BFO film. For thicknesses greater than 5 μm, the solar absorption rate of the h-LFO film shows a plateau behavior and is 3.2 times bigger than that of the BFO film. Since the band gaps of h-RFOs (≤∼2.0 eV) are significantly narrower than typical FPVs such as BFO and PZT (Eg between 2.7 and 3.6 eV),10,14 the photon absorption is expected to be much more pronounced in h-RFOs, especially in the visible light region (Fig. 2a). Thus, the predicted larger solar absorption (Fig. 2f) can be attributed primarily to the narrower band-gap characteristic of the h-RFO in comparison with the prototypic BFO film. This is the main advantage of h-RFOs as compared with other conventional FPVs. In view of this, h-RFOs are expected to be promising materials for future FPV devices.
3.3. Ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and PCE
To examine the ferroelectric photovoltaic responses of h-RFO films, we have fabricated a solar cell having an ITO/h-RFO/Pt heterojunction structure (Fig. 3a), where ITO denotes a transparent indium tin oxide top-electrode layer. Two opposite electrical-poling directions were used to examine the switchable photovoltaic effect: “upward poling” signifies the application of a positive voltage to the bottom electrode (Pt), whereas “downward poling” denotes the application of a negative voltage to the bottom electrode. To ensure a complete polarization switching by poling, we applied an electric field of 1.5 MV cm−1, which is much stronger than the coercive field (Ec), ∼0.5 MV cm−1 (Fig. 1d). Fig. 3b and c show illuminated J–V characteristics of the ITO/h-LFO/Pt device and the ITO/h-TFO/Pt device, respectively. For comparison, J–V characteristics of the ITO/BFO/SRO device are also shown in Fig. 3d. Fig. 3e compares the J–V curves of these three heterojunction devices under the same upward poling, and indicates a remarkably enhanced photocurrent in the ITO/h-TFO/Pt device. Fig. 3f shows the time-dependent photocurrent under a zero-bias voltage. The ON and OFF states are repeatable and stable, which clearly demonstrates the photo-induced current in the absence of any bias field.

(e) J–V curve of the ITO/h-TFO/Pt device compared with those of the ITO/h-LFO/Pt and ITO/BFO/SRO devices after upward poling. (f) Zero-bias photocurrent density of the ITO/h-LFO/Pt (upper panel) and ITO/h-TFO/Pt (lower panel) devices as a function of time. 
As presented in Table 1, the PCE of the h-LFO device under upward poling is ∼0.001%, which is comparable to that of the BFO device. In contrast, the PCE of the h-TFO device is ∼0.002%, which is twice as large as that of the BFO or h-LFO devices. To more statistically analyze, the PCE of N = 10 samples for each device is shown in the histograms (Fig. S1†). The average PCE of h-TFO devices is η1 = 0.0023%, with a standard deviation of σ1 = 0.00023%. In the case of h-LFO, η2 = 0.0010% and σ2 = 0.00012%. We have determined the Z-score, which is given by57 (2)

Thus, Z = 17.9 is obtained. Then, p-value < 0.00001 is calculated. If the p-value is lower than the desired statistical significance (typically p < 0.05), then we can assert that the two data are significantly different with 95% confidence. Therefore, the obtained p-value < 0.00001 means that h-TFO has a statistically higher efficiency than h-LFO. The PCE of h-TFO and BFO also show similar results; i.e., in the case of BFO, η3 = 0.0012% and σ3 = 0.00011%. Then, the Z-score is 15.1 and the corresponding p-value < 0.00001 for h-TFO and BFO devices.
To identify the origin of the enhanced PCE observed in the h-TFO device, we have compared Eg and Pr values of these three relevant heterojunction devices as these parameters are known to greatly influence the photovoltaic efficiency of FPVs. The h-TFO and h-LFO devices show similar values of Eg (Fig. 2b) and the solar absorption rate at the film thickness of 250 nm (Fig. 2f). In contrast, Pr of the h-TFO device is ∼1.8 times higher than that of the h-LFO device (Fig. 1d): 4.7 μC cm−2 for h-LFO versus 8.5 μC cm−2 for h-TFO. The enhanced polarization in a film tends to increase the depolarization-field gradient, which promotes an effective separation of the photo-generated electron–hole (e–h) pairs. This consequently leads to increased photocurrent density and PCE in the h-TFO device, as compared with the h-LFO device. In addition, the enhanced concentration of oxygen-vacancy defects can modulate the energy band and thus affect the photovoltaic response by reducing the barrier height at the interface.11,58 This modulation would be possible by the migration of oxygen vacancies to the polarization-head direction during electrical poling. According to our estimate based on the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), however, the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the h-LFO film is effectively equal to that of the h-TFO film (Fig. S2†). Therefore, the observed enhanced PCE in the h-TFO film (Table 1) can be attributed to the increased depolarization-field gradient, rather than to the enhanced concentration of the oxygen-vacancy defects.
We have further examined the effect of film thickness on the J–V responses in the h-TFO and BFO-based devices (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Both devices show that Jsc increases gradually with decreasing film thickness. This is primarily due to the enhanced internal field with decreasing film thickness, which is a combined effect of the depolarization field and the Schottky-junction barrier.8 It is interesting to note that the PCE ratio, i.e., PCE(h-TFO)/PCE(BFO), increases gradually with the film thickness (Fig. 4c): from ∼2.0 at 250 nm to 4.6 at 1500 nm. This observation can be attributed to the fact that the weak-intensity light absorption below ∼2 eV in the h-RFO film (Fig. 2a) increases gradually as the film thickness increases and approaches a micrometer (μm) level. This is indeed demonstrated by the thickness-dependent solar absorption curve presented in Fig. 2f.

3.4. Origin of asymmetric switchable photovoltaic responses in h-RFO
Another noticeable feature of the h-RFO-based solar cells is that the PCE under the upward poling is substantially higher than that under the downward poling (Table 1). These asymmetric photovoltaic responses can be attributed to (i) the difference in the Schottky barrier height between the top and bottom interfaces (that is, net built-in potential) and (ii) the asymmetric spatial distribution of defects, typically oxygen vacancies.10,58 To understand the observed asymmetric photovoltaic responses, we have first examined the characteristic energy levels of the heterojunction devices (Fig. S3b†), which were extracted from the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) shown in Fig. S3a.† The work function (φ) is evaluated by using the four Ecut-off values presented in the UPS spectra and by subsequently applying these values to the following equation: φ = 21.22 eV (He I) – Ecut-off. The results are: φ = 4.40 eV for ITO, φ = 5.30 eV for Pt, and φ(= −Ef) = 4.60 eV for h-LFO, and 4.58 eV for h-TFO. For the h-LFO or the h-TFO layer, (Ev − Ef), thus the Ev value, is determined by a linear extrapolation of the low binding-energy region of UPS.59 Finally, the electron affinity, Ec, can be evaluated by using the previously estimated bandgap (Ec − Ev) and Ev. Fig. S3b† graphically summarizes all the estimated characteristic energy levels.
A schematic energy band diagram can be extracted from these estimated characteristic energy levels (φ, Ef, Ev and Ec in Fig. S3b†). Fig. 5a and b, respectively, show these diagrams for the ITO/h-LFO/Pt and ITO/BFO/SRO heterojunctions. Here, the Schottky barrier height at the Pt/h-LFO junction is evaluated by ΦPt/LFO = φPt − φLFO = 5.30–4.60 = +0.70 eV. On the other hand, the Ohmic anti-barrier depth at the ITO/h-LFO contact is given by ΦITO/LFO = φITO − φLFO = 4.40–4.60 = −0.20 eV (Fig. S3†). Then, the barrier-height difference (or net built-in potential) is given by ΔE = ΦPt/LFO − ΦITO/LFO = 0.70−(−0.20) = +0.90 eV. It is interesting to note that the net built-in potential of the ITO/h-TFO/Pt heterojunction is also +0.90 eV: ΔE = 0.72−(−0.18) = +0.90 eV (Fig. S4†). Because of this energy gradient caused by the nonzero net built-in potential, an internal bias field develops along the cell. Thus, the photo-generated electrons tend to migrate to the ITO/h-RFO interface, whereas the photo-generated holes move towards the Pt/h-RFO interface.
 Fig. 5  Modulated energy band diagrams of (a) ITO/h-LFO/Pt and (b) ITO/BFO/SRO heterojunction devices. Here, the virgin state energy diagram (without poling) is shown on the left-hand side. A schematic up-polarization state diagram (under upward poling) is shown in the middle, whereas a schematic down-polarization state diagram (under downward poling) is shown on the right-hand side. 
The electrical poling can substantially alter the energy band diagram of an FPV cell through the poling-induced switching of the depolarization-field direction.8,58,60 Under upward poling, the direction of the depolarization field (Edp) is parallel to the direction of the unswitchable net internal bias field (Ebi = Ebi-bottom + Ebi-top), which results in the enhanced degree of band bending (Fig. 5) and thus increased photovoltaic efficiency under upward poling. Under downward poling, in contrast, the magnitude of the energy gradient becomes smaller due to the significantly reduced net internal electric field (Enet). This is because the depolarization field (Edp) is now antiparallel to the unswitchable net built-in field (Ebi), yielding a significantly reduced photocurrent density and PCE value under downward poling. These modulated energy band diagrams account for the observed asymmetric switchable photovoltaic responses (i.e., difference in the PCE between upward and downward polings). The ITO/h-TFO/Pt device also shows similar energy band diagrams as shown in Fig. S4.†
3.5. Switchable photovoltaic effect vs. built-in field effect in h-RFO
The contribution of the switchable photovoltaic effect to the net photovoltaic response can be qualitatively estimated using the following equation:10Vsp = ½|V+ − V−|, where Vsp denotes the switchable open-circuit voltage component mainly arising from the switchable ferroelectric polarization, and V+ and V− are the open-circuit voltage obtained after positive and negative polings, respectively. On the other hand, the unswitchable voltage component caused by the built-in internal field (Vbi) is given by Vbi = ½|V+ + V−|. Vsp and Vbi values of the h-RFO films can be estimated using these two equations and the photovoltaic data shown in Fig. 3b and c. In the case of the h-LFO film: Vsp = ½|0.40 − 0.18| = 0.29 V and Vbi = ½|−0.40 + 0.18| = 0.11 V. Similarly, for the h-TFO film: Vsp = ½|−0.42 − 0.25| = 0.335 V and Vbi = ½|−0.42 + 0.25| = 0.085 V. Thus, for both h-RFO-based films, the switchable photovoltaic effect dominates over the unswitchable (nonferroelectric) internal-field effect which mainly stems from the net built-in potential.
In contrast to the asymmetric switchable photovoltaic responses of h-RFO devices, the BFO device exhibits a more symmetric response, e.g., Jsc and PCE in Table 1. In the case of the ITO/BFO/SRO device, the net built-in potential is estimated to be relatively negligible: ΔE = Φbottom(0.15 eV) − Φtop(0.10 eV) = 0.05 eV ≪ΔE = 0.90 eV for h-RFO (Fig. 5). Accordingly, it requires much more energy to switch the current direction of the ITO/h-RFO/Pt device than that of the ITO/BFO/SRO device. Moreover, the BFO device possesses a significantly larger polarization value than those of the h-RFO devices: Pr ≈ 60 μC cm−2 for [001]-oriented BFO (Fig. S5b†) vs. Pr ≈ 4.7–8.5 μC cm−2 for h-RFO. Thus, as depicted in Fig. 5b, the observed nearly symmetric switchable photo-response in the ITO/BFO/SRO device can be attributed to a large depolarization field (Edp) which is suitably combined with a small (unswitchable) built-in field (Ebi).
3.6. Effect of electrical fatigue on FPV responses
If the h-RFOs are to be used in commercial switching devices, their electrical-fatigue characteristics should be first investigated. Therefore, we have examined the evolution of FPV responses of the h-TFO device during the electrical-fatigue process. As presented in Fig. 6a, ferroelectric polarization starts to decrease after ∼104 switching cycles and shows ∼65% of its initial value after 5 × 107 switching cycles (Fig. 6a). Notably, as the polarization decreases, the corresponding photovoltage also decreases (Fig. 6b and c). This can be attributed to the formation of “dead dots/layers” during the fatigue process.61–63 These defects can presumably be generated by local phase decomposition at domain nucleation sites or by a pile-up of defective ions at the interface between the electrode and the ferroelectric layer, as reported in PZT thin films.62,63 Since the degraded regions have a low relative dielectric permittivity, the Schottky contact and the internal electric field will be varied, eventually resulting in a decrease of the photovoltage. However, more detailed studies are further required to identify the intrinsic mechanism of the polarization fatigue in h-RFO thin films.

4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated a new class of FPVs using heteroepitaxially grown h-RFO thin-film heterostructures, where R = Tm and Lu. The h-RFO films show narrow band gaps, which indicates a distinct advantage over other typical FPVs having wide band-gap characteristics. The PCE of h-RFO thin-film devices is sensitive to the magnitude of ferroelectric polarization, suggesting an important role of the depolarization-field gradient in FPV responses. In the case of the h-TmFeO3 thin-film device, the measured PCE is twice as large as that of the BFO thin-film device, a prototypic FPV. We have elucidated that the switchable photovoltaic effect dominates over the unswitchable internal field effect arising from the net built-in potential. We have further shown that the photovoltage decreases gradually with the number of switching cycles during the electrical-fatigue process.
