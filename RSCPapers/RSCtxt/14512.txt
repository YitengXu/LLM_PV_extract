    , Accepted 25th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractA wearable and transparent thermoelectric (TE) hydrogel based on bisulfate transport was demonstrated to record a negative ionic Seebeck coefficient of −25.0 mV K−1, ionic power factor of 9.94 mW m−1 K−2, and an ionic figure of merit of 7.2 at 80% relative humidity and room temperature. The n-type TE hydrogel was made of electronic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), ionic poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid), and biocompatible bisulfate, which was used as a thermally diffusive anion carrier for the first time in TE devices, to realize a soft mixed ionic–electronic conductor. The composition of this hydrogel was precisely controlled by varying the contents of ammonium persulfate and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene to afford a transparent and self-healable film that recovered within 15 min after cutting (cut width of ∼35 μm). Bisulfate transport was visualized using an anion detective fluorophore as a tool to intuitively elucidate the Soret effect, in which ion carriers thermodiffuse from hot to cold parts, and to quantify the thermovoltage simultaneously. A flexible band-type TE energy harvester with 20 legs was fabricated to afford a thermovoltage of −2.75 V at a temperature gradient of 5.5 K, and the harvested energy was used to operate a light-emitting diode for the first time in an organic TE module with a small temperature gradient (<10 K). Moreover, a colorful wearable band-type module and photothermal all organic TE device were demonstrated to be effective self-powered body-worn TE harvesters under ambient conditions.

Broader context
Thermoelectric effects have the potential to play a role in carbon-free power generation from waste heat and in mitigating climate challenges. While many thermoelectric materials have been developed for powering electronics and cooling applications, there are few examples of thermoelectrics with a non-hazardous and eco-friendly composition. In this study, we first spotlight new highly-efficient, self-healable, and transparent thermoelectric hydrogels based on bisulfate, which is a nonhazardous and biodegradable anion. The thermoelectric hydrogels were designed as mixed ionic–electronic conductors, where n-type carrier transport and a selective carrier generation were optimized, to obtain the highest thermoelectric performance in organic materials at room temperature. Thanks to the non-toxic, self-healable, and transparent nature, the thermoelectric hydrogels with bisulfate are ultimately suitable for wearable applications. Thus, we demonstrated a colorful and wearable band-type thermoelectric harvester, which powered a light-emitting diode at a small temperature gradient (5.5 K). Moreover, the highly transparent hydrogels allowed harvesting heat energy from a light source, to provide a photothermal thermoelectric harvester. This work establishes thermal diffusion of bisulfate in hydrogels and inspires new strategies for body-worn thermoelectrics.

Introduction
Bisulfate is a nonhazardous and biodegradable anion. It is easily obtained from nature and used widely for food, cleaning, water treatment, metal finishing, agriculture, and physiology industries.1–5 Bisulfate is a stable anion in the aqueous phase as it is hydrated to afford negatively charged stable clusters.6 Moreover, similar to sulfonates, bisulfates are among the key anions in FDA-approved pharmaceutical salts. For example, the sulfate salt of hydroxychloroquine is used in the management of COVID-19 and as an indicator of rheumatoid arthritis and malaria. The bisulfate salt of clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medicine that is useful for reducing the risk of heart diseases.7 For these clinical uses, the transport of bisulfate is critical to control the unwanted delivery of ions and maximizing effective ion conduction in medicine and electronics, respectively. In particular, the transport of bisulfate under a small change in body temperature could provide not only an understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through the membrane, but also a new method of biocompatible energy harvesting for self-powered wearable electronics.
However, bisulfate has not yet been spotlighted as a conductive ionic material or for energy harvesting, possibly because of its low ion conductivity (λ° = 5.2 mS m2 mol−1) in aqueous solution with a large hydrodynamic radius (0.221 nm) relative to other common anions such as halide anions, hydrogen carbonate, nitrate, and hydroxide.8,9 To solve the issue of the low diffusion coefficient of bisulfate ions (D° ∼1.385 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) in aqueous media, the transport of bisulfate must be controlled by designing carrier transport channels in media and driving the ions into a target location, which is considerably challenging.9
In this context, ionic polymers could be a promising media because they have shown great potential for realizing a unique class of ion transport in thermoelectric (TE) devices, solar cells, electroactive actuators (artificial muscles), functional membranes (osmotic, desalination, and fuel cells), and CO2 capture for the development of eco-friendly energy sources and human-friendly devices.10 Among these, TE devices composed of ionic polymers are competitive candidates in terms of low-cost production, light weight, scalability, and environmental friendliness to build autonomous electric systems for self-powered wearable devices.11–19 These advantages can be achieved by harvesting electric energy from natural heat, human body heat, and waste heat from electronics and vehicles. Since conventional high-TE materials based on solid inorganic semiconductors (heavy metals) have intrinsic risks due to the lack of flexibility and high toxicity, organic TE materials based on ionic polymers could be an alternative.13 The TE performance of materials can be compared using the TE figure of merit, ZT = S2σT/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the carrier conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal conductivity.11–15 Recently, one of the important TE parameters, power factor (PF = S2σ), has been dramatically enhanced for ionic polymers by realizing a high S value through ion-channel control in the hydrogel matrix and easy carrier ion tuning to achieve ionic thermoelectric (iTE) materials.18
The major carriers for ion transport in an ionic polymer film are cations and anions in p- and n-type TE harvesters, respectively. The thermal diffusion of these carriers from hot to cold parts, defined as the Soret effect,20 is crucial for practical applications such as p/n integrated TE modules to boost the thermovoltage output and power for a dense module. Many p-type iTE materials have been reported previously.11,13–15,17 However, there are few reports on n-type iTEs16,18,19,21–24 because of the difficulty in controlling anion carrier transport and the lower diffusivity of anions in comparison with cations due to their larger size, which disturb sufficient ion diffusion in ionic conductors. As an example, the polymer gel of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][TFSI]) with an 80 wt% ionic liquid content was reported as an n-type iTE film with an S of −4.0 mV K−1.16 This film showed a high ionic ZT (ZTi) of 0.069 owing to a low thermal conductivity of 0.136 W m−1 K−1; however, the power factor (PF = 0.032 mW m−1 K−2) and TE output from these iTE harvesters are limited because of the low current generation in this electrically insulating system.
To boost the thermoelectric conversion, a mixed ionic–electronic conductor (MIEC) system has emerged. Recently, we reported high n-type MIEC polymer films using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) doped with CuCl2, where chloride ion transport is accompanied by electron transport in the PEDOT:PSS complex of Cu ions.18 These MIEC films showed a high negative ionic Seebeck coefficient (Si) of −18.2 mV K−1 and a high ionic power factor (PFi) of 1.7 mW m−1 K−2 at room temperature (RT) and 80% relative humidity (RH). Owing to the high PFi, these films achieved a high ZTi value of over 1.5. Since these reports, several iTE materials have been reported using anion conduction in a polymer matrix, such as FeCl3 (0.75 mM)-doped poly(3-hexylthiophene), which showed an Si of −14 mV K−1 but a very low PFi of 0.01 mW m−1 K−2 at RT.23 Perylene bisimide was reported as an MIEC with an Si of −3.0 mV K−1 and a ZTi of 0.23 at RT and 60% RH.21 A standard ionic liquid ([EMIM][TFSI]) was doped in a paper sheet to develop a low-cost chip for issuing an early fire alarm at a temperature gradient (ΔT) of 35 K.19 These iTE papers are intrinsically opaque gels or deeply colored polymer films that allow the screening of information below the TE paper. Furthermore, their iTE characteristics are quite low (Si of −2.6 mV K−1 and PFi of 0.0059 mW m−1 K−2 at RT), limiting their application to the above-mentioned self-powered wearable electronics in which the ΔT is generally small. Therefore, it is difficult to find an example of flexible organic TE modules that power electronic devices under a low ΔT (<10 K), particularly for the ΔT between human skin and air.12,14,25 Simultaneously, transparent and human-friendly TE devices are required to power effective wearable electronics that can intrinsically communicate with other electronics by detecting small changes in the living environment or human body temperature.
Herein, we report a wearable and transparent n-type hydrogel TE harvester that contains mixed ionic and electronic components. The hydrogel TE system was composed of ionic and conductive polymers, and the hydrogel could maintain humidity while the ionic polymer affords ion channels to facilitate bisulfate transport under a ΔT. Consequently, hydrogel systems can build up the Seebeck voltage and harvest TE energy. This hydrogel was synthesized by the polymerization of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer using ammonium persulfate (APS) as an initiator in the presence of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS). In this polymer composite, PAMPS provides an ion channel for anion carriers, which are the major carriers in the TE harvester, while PEDOT serves as an electronic channel to realize a mixed ionic–electronic TE. The ordered morphology of the PEDOT nanoclusters was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction. The TE performance of the hydrogel film was optimized by varying the EDOT and APS contents in the composite solution, which served as electronic and ionic carrier hosts, respectively. Bisulfate transport via thermodiffusion and the n-type mechanism of the iTE device were confirmed using a fluorophore that traced bisulfate anion transport, along with Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. This soft MIEC hydrogel harvester recorded a high negative Si of −25.0 mV K−1, PFi of 9.94 mW m−1 K−2, and ZTi of 7.2 at 80% RH and RT. Furthermore, it provided self-healing characteristics and a flexible band-type TE harvester with 20 n-type legs to afford a thermovoltage of −2.75 V at a low ΔT of 5.5 K. The harvested energy was transferred to an electrolytic capacitor to operate a light-emitting diode (LED). In addition, a colorful and wearable band-type TE module with dyed legs was prepared by screenprinting, to demonstrate an autonomous and affective self-powered body-worn TE harvester.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the structure of the n-type mixed ionic–electronic polymer composite. To synthesize the composite, an EDOT monomer was added to an aqueous solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and PAMPS at concentrations of 0.33, 0.52, 0.65, 0.78, 0.97, and 1.3 wt% (of the solids contents) and polymerized in situ by adding 1 molar equivalent APS to afford a PVA/PEDOT/PAMPS composite. APS promoted the oxidative polymerization of EDOT and acted as a radical initiator. The n-type PVA/PEDOT/PAMPS (NPP) TE materials were named NPP33, NPP52, NPP65, NPP78, NPP97, and NPP130, respectively, with the digits corresponding to the above-mentioned EDOT contents. Additionally, an excess of 1–4 molar equivalent APS was added to the NPP65 solution, and the resulting solutions were named NPP65-x, where x is the total molar equivalent APS in the NPP sample. This excess APS was used to identify an additional bisulfate source. The polymer solution was drop-casted on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film or glass slide and dried at RT for 3 h. Details of the synthesis and fabrication methods are described in the experimental section (ESI†).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to analyze the organization and dispersion of PEDOT in the NPP composite. PVA-PAMPS showed amorphous agglomerates with a large size of 20–200 nm, containing 5–10 nm-sized nanocrystallites (Fig. S1a, ESI†). For the NPP33 specimen, the nanoparticles were several tens of nanometers in size, and the crystalline part (dark) was covered by an amorphous part (∼10 nm thick, gray) of the nanoparticle, similar to a core–shell structure (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1b, ESI†). The crystalline part was confirmed to be a nearly single-crystal PEDOT with a clear dot pattern in a fast Fourier transform (FFT) image, and the amorphous part was assigned as PVA-PAMPS because of its lower electronic density. The distance between the dark lines implied a crystalline PEDOT domain with a d-spacing of 0.36 nm, which corresponded to a π–π stacking distance through the b-axis (d010) of the PEDOT:PSS chain (0.36 nm),26,27 as shown in Fig. 1c and d. With increasing PEDOT content, the agglomerate size increased to ∼400 nm, and the agglomerate contained PEDOT crystals in a cluster form (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1c, d, ESI†). Therefore, the growth of PEDOT first proceeded from the growth of the core–shell nanoparticle, following which the PEDOT crystals gathered to form a larger agglomerate similar to PEDOT:PSS.28 The value of d100 through the a-axis corresponded to the PEDOT–PEDOT distance and was ∼2.6 nm, which was similar to that of PEDOT:PSS (2.2 nm).26 Furthermore, d001 through the c-axis is ∼0.8 nm, which is derived from d011 (Fig. 1c, inset). In addition, the nanoparticles in NPP65 were confirmed to be composed of C, N, O, and S atoms through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 1e–g and Fig. S2, ESI†). Therefore, the NPP65 agglomerate was composed of crystalline PEDOT nanoparticles doped by PAMPS/PVA. These crystalline PEDOT clusters could lead electron channels to increase the electronic conductivity of the film, while the ionic PAMPS/PVA domains increased the ionic conductivity (ion channels), realizing mixed carrier transport in the film.
The thickness of the drop-casted NPP films was measured using a surface profiler at various RH levels (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the NPP films were uniformly coated with a thickness of 60 μm at 80% RH. The film thickness was equal to 60 μm at 80% RH within experimental error for all samples prepared for further characterization and measurement of the TE properties. The transmittance of the NPP films synthesized with various EDOT concentrations was determined in the visible to near-infrared regions (Fig. 1h). The films with a low PEDOT content (NPP33, NPP52, and NPP65) showed a high transmittance in the visible region, which was sufficient for the letter behind the film to be visible (Fig. 1j). The average transmittance (Tave) in the visible range (380–780 nm) of these NPP films was over 90% (Fig. 1i), which is suitable for transparent wearable electronic applications. Upon further increasing the PEDOT content, Tave decreased dramatically, and the NPP130 film showed a Tave of 45%.
Raman spectra were analyzed to identify the composition, doping level, and major carriers in the NPP films. Fig. 2a and Fig. S4 (ESI†) show the Raman spectra of PAMPS and NPP65 films with different concentrations of APS on a glass slide, which were collected using laser excitation at a wavelength of 532 nm. In particular, the peak intensity at 1040 cm−1 was higher in the NPP films than in the PAMPS film. This peak could be assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of the SO3− band, which may have originated from the proton dissociation of the sulfonic acid group in PAMPS (PAMP–SO3H).29 Because the peak intensity of the N–H stretching at 771 cm−1 (I771) for PAMPS was maintained in all films, regardless of the contents of PVA, PEDOT, and APS, it was chosen as an internal reference, and the relative intensity (RI1040 = I1040/I771) was determined for the deprotonated -SO3− band (I1040) (Fig. 2b and Fig. S5, ESI†). The RI1040 for PAMPS (1.25) decreased to 0.99 in NPP65, indicating the deprotonation of the sulfonic acid group in PAMPS. In the presence of APS, NH4+ may be associated with the -SO3− of PAMPS via electrostatic interaction. Significant changes in RI1040 were observed for NPP65 films when PVA was added. As the PVA content increased from 0 to 16 wt%, RI1040 increased from 0.99 to 1.21 (Fig. S5, ESI†). This phenomenon is attributed to hydrogen bonding between the -SO3− of PAMPS and the -OH of PVA.30

On the other hand, it is well known that persulfate ions of APS produce bisulfate in acidic and neutral solutions at a moderate temperature of 25 °C.31,32 Therefore, APS can be converted into bisulfates in the presence of PAMPS. To quantify the generation of bisulfate, the Raman spectra of PAMPS were examined under different APS contents (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the band at 879 cm−1, a characteristic peak for HSO4−,33 appeared upon the addition of APS to PAMPS. Indeed, KHSO4 and tetra-n-butylammonium bisulfate ([TBA][HSO4]) also showed peaks at 874 cm−1 and 879 cm−1, respectively (Fig. S5f, ESI†). Thus, the evolution of the peak was quantified according to the APS content in PAMPS using the peak intensity at 879 cm−1 (I879). The relative intensity of bisulfate (RI879 = I879/I771) increased as APS content increased up to 4 molar equivalent (Fig. 2b, red). This indicates that bisulfate could be generated from the reaction of APS and PAMPS (eqn (1)). (1)
At an extremely high APS content (4 molar equivalent APS), RI879 was lower, possibly because of the re-aggregation of APS in the media. The maximum bisulfate content was determined to be 4.1 mM, as correlated in Fig. 2b (cyan) from the titration experiment (Fig. S6c and d, details in the FL part, ESI†). Therefore, the role of APS can be viewed in two ways: one as an oxidizing agent for the polymerization of EDOT, in which it is doped after polymerization, and the other as the bisulfate ion precursor, in which APS deprotonates PAMPS to invoke the reaction described in eqn (1). As characterized by Raman and XPS analyses (Fig. S7, ESI†), as more protons dissociated from PAMPS, bisulfate production increased, while the cation (H+ and NH4+) contents decreased, resulting in stable n-type thermal carrier generation.
To determine the thermodiffusion of bisulfate anions in the NPP film, a bisulfate-detecting coumarin derivative (BDC) was synthesized according to the literature (detailed in the ESI†).34 BDC showed high selectivity and sensitivity for bisulfate with a turn-on fluorescence (FL) mechanism in aqueous solution. Therefore, the generation of bisulfate in the NPP solution could be proved by measuring the FL intensity when APS was added to the polymer composite. First, the absorption maximum of BDC (364 nm) was redshifted in NPP65-1 (371 nm) (Fig. S6a, ESI†), indicating the generation of HSO4−, which forms a complex with BDC to lead to a redshift of absorption.34 Furthermore, the FL was turned on when APS was added and dramatically enhanced as the APS content was increased (Fig. 2d).
Next, to confirm and visualize the diffusion of bisulfate in the film, a temperature gradient (ΔT) cycle of 22 K was repeated for 60 s on both parts of the NPP65-3 film. The change in FL intensity was monitored under a hand-held UV lamp, and the film temperature was simultaneously measured using an IR camera (Fig. 2e and f). For each cycle, the reversible thermodiffusion of bisulfate was clearly observed by comparing the FL intensities of the cold and hot parts of the film. The FL intensity extracted from the photograph of the cold part was 5% higher than that of the hot part, indicating that bisulfates migrated from the hot to cold parts. The FL intensity profile from the photographs showed a clear FL intensity change with the application of a reverse ΔT in the in-plane direction (Fig. 2g, h and Fig. S6, ESI†). As ΔT increased, the difference in FL intensity increased more rapidly, indicating that the bisulfate transport rate was affected by ΔT (Fig. S6b, ESI†).
The quantified ion transport rate of bisulfates (7.1 × 10−3 mol m−2 h−1 at a ΔT of 4.8 K) was high enough to be comparable to the selective cation transport rate in ion-exchange membranes, despite a much larger hydration ion radius (details in the ESI†).35 The synchronized FL and thermodiffusion experiments show that the NPP system can not only move bisulfates from hot to cold parts, but also control the ion transport rate based on ΔT. This result indicates that the NPP system could provide efficient ion transport via the ion channel formed by the ionic polymer composite domains.
Furthermore, the bisulfate concentration in the NPP65 solutions was confirmed through a FL titration measurement (Fig. 2d and Fig. S6c, d). For effective FL detection without any intensity decrease due to a faint blue color, the NPP65 solution was diluted to 1/300 in 3 μM BDC solution (CH3CN:H2O = 1:1, v/v), and a standard curve was obtained using the same BDC solution with the addition of 1–7 molar equivalent [TBA][HSO4]. The maximum FL at 485 nm was increased proportionally with increasing bisulfate content. However, the determined bisulfate concentration of the NPP65 solutions did not increase proportionally with increasing APS content. For 1–3 molar equivalent APS, the bisulfate concentration increased from 1.8 ± 0.1 to 4.1 ± 0.2 mM, while the bisulfate concentration decreased to 3.47 mM for the NPP65-5 solution, similar to the Raman spectroscopy of RI879. The NPP65-3 solution contained 7.0 mM APS, which indicates that 58 ± 2 mol% of the added APS was converted to bisulfate as a major anion carrier.
To analyze the major elemental composition and anion carrier of the NPP65-3 film, ToF-SIMS was performed for surface analysis in the negative ion mode (Fig. S8, details in the ESI†). Fig. 3a shows the contents of C, N, O, and S-containing organic groups for the hot and cold parts of the NPP65-3 film. The S and O contents (47.8% and 36.5%) in the cold part were significantly higher than those in the hot part (45.9% and 34.8%), while the counter C and N contents were lower in the cold part because of a decrease in their relative contents in the film. In addition, the relative content of the bisulfate component with respect to the total content of S-containing organic groups dramatically increased in the cold part (Fig. 3a, right y-axis). In addition, the contents of the hot and cold parts were different from those of the pristine film. The characteristic peaks of sulfate and bisulfate anions (HSO4−, SO4−, HSO3−, and SO2−) in the cold part were significantly higher than those in the hot part (Fig. S8, ESI†). We note that the intensity and content of the bisulfate anion were greater than those of the other anions, indicating that bisulfate was the major anion carrier.

To understand the ion transport in the NPP samples, solid-state 1H NMR spectroscopy was conducted to verify the n-type behavior of the NPP films (Fig. S9, ESI†). The proton diffusion coefficient (DH+) of NPP65-1 and NPP65-3 films at 90% RH was obtained using a 500 MHz 1H NMR spectrometer equipped with a diff30 pulsed-field-gradient diffusion probe. NPP65-3 showed broader resonance and larger shielding than NPP65-1, indicating that the free proton transport (including NH4+) in NPP65-3 is more difficult than that in NPP65-1, which may be due to the confinement of clusters of the water-solvated -SO3− group by the electrostatic and H-bonding forces.36,37 The activation energy (Ea) of proton transport for NPP65-1 (18.1 ± 5.0 kJ mol−1) and NPP65-3 (38.0 ± 5.9 kJ mol−1) at 90% RH was determined from the Arrhenius plot of DH+, and it also elucidates the above-mentioned difference in proton transport between the two films, which causes NPP65-3 to be an n-type iTE film (Fig. 3b).
To take advantage of the selective thermodiffusion of bisulfate in the film state, TE conversion was determined for various PEDOT contents of the NPP film and RH levels. Fig. 3c shows three repeated heating–cooling cycles with respect to the thermovoltage generation (Vout) of the NPP65-3 film with good reproducibility. The Vout rise proceeded for ∼280 s when a ΔT of 4.8 K was applied, following which Vout was stabilized as a constant value and well maintained until ΔT was removed. A stable Vout can only be achieved when a single anion species is thermally diffused by inhibiting cation thermodiffusion (especially protons). Generally, both anions and cations can be thermally diffused from hot to cold parts by the Soret effect,11,16,18 and they generate thermovoltage for a given ΔT. However, cations can diffuse faster than anions because of their small hydrodynamic radius, which induces a drag of water molecules.38 This difference in the thermodiffusion rate between the two ions causes thermovoltage fluctuation and a decrease in the thermovoltage over time.11 As confirmed by Raman and XPS analyses, the introduction of PVA in the NPP solution reduced the concentration of protons bound to PAMPS, and the left unbound proton reacted with APS to generate bisulfate. For example, an unstable Vout was observed for the NPP65-3 film without PVA (Fig. S10, ESI†). On the other hand, a stable Vout was obtained for the NPP65-3 film (with 2 wt% PVA) at various ΔT (Fig. 3d). As ΔT increased, Vout increased linearly, and the ionic Seebeck coefficient (Si) of the film was obtained by linear fitting. A high negative Si of −25.0 ± 1.3 mV K−1 was determined for the NPP65-3 film. Owing to the selective thermodiffusion of bisulfate, the film showed a high Si value with a small ion concentration (2.7 wt%) compared to the iTE films in the literature that used an ionic liquid.
Furthermore, TE parameters including the Si, ionic conductivity (σi), and electrical conductivity (σe) of the NPP films were determined for the NPP65-3 films containing different PEDOT contents under a ΔT of 4.8 K (Table 1 and Fig. S10, 11, ESI†). Among the six NPP-3 films with different PEDOT contents, NPP65-3 showed the highest negative Si of −25.0 mV K−1 at 80% RH (Fig. 3e). When the PEDOT content increased from NPP33 to NPP65, which was accompanied by an increase in the APS content, the amount of bisulfate carrier increased, following an increase in Si. In the case of NPP with a higher PEDOT content (NPP78, 97, and 130), Si decreased. This may be due to the disturbance of ion carrier movement from densely formed PEDOT agglomerates in the composite film.

Similar to previous reports,11,15,17,18Si increased with increasing RH levels owing to the reinforcement of ion channels in the NPP films (Fig. S13, ESI†). Moreover, Si increased with increasing bisulfate concentration (Fig. 3f), which indicated that the major ion carrier was bisulfate. Notably, the NPP65-1 and NPP65-2 films showed an unstable iTE effect, probably because of the change in carrier type (Fig. S11, ESI†), and the NPP65-4 and NPP65-5 films were not stable for repeated ΔT cycles. In contrast, NPP65-3 showed reproducible TE values for repeated ΔT cycles, exhibiting a small loss of 2.8% with 10 ΔT (4.8 K) cycles (Fig. S11, ESI†). This implies that the ion concentration is important in the hydrogel matrix and that PEDOT clusters can be sustained under NPP65-3 film conditions. In addition, the Seebeck effect is converted from p-type (NPP65-1) to n-type (NPP65-2) with increasing APS content. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted to determine σi and σe to confirm the contribution of ionic and electronic carriers in the NPP films through the equivalent circuit fitting of the Nyquist plots (Fig. S12 and Table S1, ESI†). First, as the PEDOT content increased, σi increased at 80% RH (Fig. S13a, ESI†): σi was 13.3 and 19.0 S m−1 for NPP33-3 and NPP130-3, respectively. On the other hand, σe increased as the EDOT content increased but dropped as the content increased beyond 1.2%. This result indicates that the MIEC state can be obtained for NPP65-3 to NPP78-3 and NPP97-3. Next, as the RH level increased from 50% to 90%, σi increased from 4.98 to 20.0 S m−1 for the NPP65 film, while σe slightly decreased from 9.32 to 5.68 mS m−1 (Fig. S13b, ESI†). As RH increases, more water can be absorbed in the NPP65 film; this allows for an increase in σi because the ion channel for ion carriers becomes larger and the distance between polymer chains becomes longer, while electron transport between the PEDOT chains could be less favorable according to the electron hopping mechanism.10 When the RH level increased from 80% to 90% RH, the water content increased remarkably (Fig. S15, ESI†), and as a result, σe decreased sharply owing to a large swelling effect. The 80% RH condition was chosen as the optimized condition under which σi had a high value and σe did not decrease significantly. It is noted that NPP65-3 showed a higher σi (15.9 ± 0.5 S m−1) than PAMPS (9.5 ± 0.5 S m−1) at 80% RH (Table S2, ESI†). Since the bisulfates of NPP65 were produced by the reaction between APS and protons dissociated from PAMPS, they thermodiffuse freely in the medium because they are unbound to PAMPS. In addition, since protons are not the major carriers, the changes in Si and σi at various humidity levels were small compared to those for PANI:PAAMPSA:PA.17 As a result, the carrier conductivity contribution of σi was much larger than that of σe because of the highly ionic hydrogel composite.
Moreover, the TE parameters of NPP65 with different PVA contents and APS contents at 80% RH were investigated to optimize the iTE performance (Fig. S13c and d, ESI†). Both σi and σe of NPP65-3 decreased with increasing PVA content because it is a carrier insulator. As the APS content increased, σi increased because of the increase in bisulfates, but σe decreased. This decrease in σe may be due to the increase in the possibility of an impurity-producing side reaction at the α-position of EDOT and other groups with increasing APS content, leading to the destruction of the π-conjugation of PEDOT.39 The decomposition of PEDOT reduced σe and produced other impurity ions that disturb clear n-type ion transport. Interestingly, the EIS spectra of all the NPP films were fitted using an equivalent circuit model including an inductor (Fig. S12, ESI†) that causes an electromotive force, that is, a change in the current passing through the electric circuit itself. It may be derived from the stacked PEDOT nanoparticles of the out-of-plane NPP film between the two electrodes.40 The inductance value was correlated only with σi, and σi increased with decreasing inductance, resulting in the high PFi of the NPP film with a high APS content. In addition, the TE properties of the NPP devices showed a correlation with the weight ratio of (PAMPS + PVA + EDOT)/APS (Fig. S14, ESI†). The value of σi increased with increasing APS content (ion carrier), and the maximum Si value was found for NPP65-3 owing to the optimized bisulfate concentration. Therefore, the maximum PFi value was obtained at a weight ratio of (PAMPS + PVA + EDOT)/APS as ∼30. In addition, experimentally generated thermal voltage was validated by the simulated value for the NPP65-3 device using COMSOL Multiphysics software (Fig. 3g).
In-plane thermal conductivity (κ) was analyzed for the NPP films with different EDOT and APS concentrations, respectively, and RH levels (Fig. S16, details in the ESI†). Because the EDOT, APS, and PVA contents in the composites were small, the difference in κ for the PAMPS and the NPP samples was small. As the EDOT content increased from NPP33-3 to NPP130-3, κ increased from 0.313 to 0.338 W m−1 K−1 at 40% RH due to the higher κ of PEDOT (∼1 W m−1 K−1) than PAMPS and PVA.41 NPP65-x samples with APS content change (1–5) showed similar κ values at 40% RH.
The optimized NPP65-3 film showed a remarkably high PFi value of 9.93 ± 0.69 mW m−1 K−2 at 80% RH. The thermal conductivity (κ) of the film was 0.41 W m−1 K−1 at 80% RH (Fig. S16, ESI†) and the ionic figure of merit (ZTi) was determined as 7.2 ± 1.0 (Table 1). In addition, it showed a stable Si value with small losses of 8.5% in the storage stability test for 120 h (Fig. 3d, inset). Compared with the reported state-of-the-art values, NPP65-3 exhibited the highest TE performance in organic materials at room temperature. To the best of our knowledge, the PFi and ZTi of NPP65-3 are, respectively, 5.7 and 4.7 times higher than those of PEDOT:PSS doped with CuCl2, which was one of the best n-type TE material reported thus far,18 interestingly, these values are 1.3 and 1.6 times higher than one of the best p-type iTE materials reported thus far,15 respectively (Fig. 3h and Table S3, ESI†). The electrochemical energy storage (Ech) was 7.8 μJ due to the high negative Si value (Fig. 3i). Furthermore, owing to the high ZTi values from the iTE material, the iTE harvesting efficiency was comparable to that of inorganic materials (Fig. S17, ESI†). The maximum charging efficiency (the heat-to-electricity efficiency) of the iTE (ηiTE)13 of NPP65-3 was 0.47%, which was the highest value among the iTE materials, and it showed a comparable ηiTE to one of the best inorganic TE materials reported thus far (Na0.03Sn0.992Se and Bi2Te2.79Se0.21 + 0.067 wt% BiCl3)42,43 with maximum efficiencies (ηmax) of 0.10% and 0.68%, respectively, at 300 K and a ΔT of 10 K. Therefore, NPP65-3 as a transparent n-type soft MIEC hydrogel showed sufficiently high TE energy harvesting at RT.
To investigate the self-healing behavior of the NPP65-3 device, the thermovoltage of three repeated heating–cooling cycles was measured before and after cutting at 80% RH and a ΔT of 4.8 K (Fig. 4a). After the cycles, when the voltage approached 0 V, the middle part of the device was cut (cut width of ∼35 μm, Fig. 4b, left), and ΔT was eliminated (0 K). Subsequently, the voltage signal was restored near 0 V after 2400 s, and the cut part recovered after 15 min. This means that the device autonomously self-recovered with the help of moisture in the atmosphere.44 The intrinsic self-recovery relies on softness, chain movability, and reversible processes based on moisture absorption, resulting in interfacial diffusion to the cut area through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding of the hydrophilic components in the film (Fig. S18, ESI†). The reversible hydrophilic bonds are damaged when cut, following which the electrostatic interaction leads to the spontaneous and inherent regeneration of dynamic non-covalent bonds via the reorganization of the hydrogel matrix and entanglement of polymer chains at the damaged interfaces. After waiting for 300 s to reach 0 V, the thermovoltage was measured again for three cycles (Fig. 4a). An Si of −24.7 mV K−1 was obtained after the self-healing process, which maintained 99% of the Si of the pristine sample before cutting (−25.0 mV K−1). Therefore, the healing efficiency associated with iTE was 99%, and the volumetric curing speed was 140 μm2 min−1, which was faster than that of PANI:PAAMPSA:PA under a similar RH level (∼20 μm2 min−1).17 The cut area of cut and self-healed films was observed using optical microscopy (Fig. 4b and Fig. S18, ESI†).

(i) Photograph of the all-organic iTE device and corresponding thermal images at different 808 nm-NIR laser power (I808) exposures. 
To confirm the flexibility, tensile tests of the free-standing NPP65-3 film were performed in dried (40% RH) and humid (∼80% RH) states (Fig. S19, ESI†). The maximum strain in the humid state was 400%, which was much larger than that in the dried state (10%). In addition, the Young's modulus decreased to 0.13 MPa in the humid state, much lower than that (40 MPa) in the dried state, which indicates that the NPP65-3 film is mechanically softer than human skin (Young's modulus = 0.1–1.0 MPa).45 Therefore, the NPP65-3 film can be applied to wearable iTE modules.
Finally, by taking advantage of the high ZTi, transparency, and flexibility, a wearable TE module with 20 legs of NPP65-3 was fabricated as a band-type harvester. Fig. 4c shows the module-type TE harvester and the transparency of each film. Each leg was drop-casted on an area of 2 × 7 mm2 on a PET film, fully connected to two Au electrodes in series with a distance of 5 mm. The Vout of the module-type TE harvester at a ΔT of 5.5 K and 80% RH reached −2.75 V after 400 s, showing stable voltage generation (Fig. 4d, S1). The module also showed reproducible thermovoltage buildup under three repeated heating–cooling cycles. One leg generated −0.138 V, which corresponds to an Si of −25 mV K−1. The Si of one leg matched the Si (−25.0 mV K−1) of the NPP65 film.
To use the harvested TE energy from the TE harvester for the operation of an electronic device, the module was connected to a 0.47 μF capacitor when the voltage signal reached 0 V after the cycles (S2). The generated TE energy at ΔT = 5.5 K was transferred to the capacitor, and the capacitor was charged for 2200 s, and following which it reached 1.8 V. Next, the stored electrochemical energy in the capacitor was directly transferred to turn on a red LED (S3) with the disconnection of the module using two switches (Fig. S20, ESI†). During the operation of the LED, a voltage drop was observed, indicating that the stored energy was successfully used to turn on the LED (Fig. 4e). Note that this result is the first demonstration of an electronic device powered by a flexible organic TE module with a rational device size and a low ΔT (<10 K), and the TE performance of the flexible module surpasses a previously reported one.25
Moreover, by taking advantage of the transparency of the NPP films, a colorful and flexible band-type TE module was demonstrated by introducing colorful water-soluble inks. Thus, colorful inks were mixed with NPP65-3 solution, and the mixture was screen-printed on a PET film to realize a target color on each leg (Fig. 4f). After drying, polyimide tape (500 μm thick) was attached to the bottom side of the TE legs on the PET film to maintain the ΔT between skin and air when the module film is wound on the wrist (Fig. 4g). The band-type module worn on a wrist generated a Vout of 1.88 V after 1600 s, and it gradually decreased when the film was detached from the arm, reaching 0 V after 1000 s. From the maximum Vout, the ΔT between the two electrodes was estimated to be −3.7 K. It is noteworthy that, with such a small temperature difference, between the wrist and air, the colorful and flexible band-type TE module generates an energy density of 8.8 J m−2 and a power density of 207 μW m−2, which could be used for a non-mechanical continuous self-powered body-worn TE harvester.
In addition to body heat, heat from a light source can be used to harvest TE energy. Thus, the NPP65-3 film was applied to a light-triggered all-organic TE device by replacing the Au electrodes of the TE module with a highly conductive polymer, a tosylate-doped PEDOT (PEDOT:Tos) film, with a high photothermal effect.27 An NIR laser with a wavelength of 808 nm was used as a wireless heat source, and it was focused on a PEDOT electrode at the bottom of the transparent NPP65-3 film (Fig. 4h and i). As the laser power was increased from 7.5 to 22.0 mW (increase in power density from 50 to 147 mW cm−2), a photothermal-to-thermoelectric voltage (VPT-TE) was generated in a manner similar to the normal TE measurement experiment using Au electrodes and Peltier modules as the heat source, taking into account the corresponding Si of −25.1 mV K−1. In addition, it showed reversible voltage switching during three repeated on/off cycles over time (Fig. S21, ESI†) even at a low laser power (7.5 mW). The simplicity and multifunctionality of the NPP films provided well-confined programmability for a highly efficient TE property, photothermal effect, and transparency of the film.
Conclusions
In summary, bisulfate transport in the PAMPS composite of PEDOT afforded a high-performance n-type soft MIEC TE film, which was demonstrated as a thermal energy harvesting system for operating an electronic device, LED, under a small ΔT. The EDOT, thermal, and PVA contents in the PAMPS composite were controlled to optimize the TE performance of the NPP film. The n-type TE mechanism of the NPP film was confirmed through Raman spectroscopy, XPS, ToF-SIMS, and NMR studies. The thermodiffusion of bisulfate in the NPP film was monitored and visualized using a selective and sensitive fluorescent BDC. Among the organic TE materials reported thus far, the optimized NPP65-3 device showed the highest negative Si of −25.0 mV K−1, PFi of 9.93 mW m−1 K−2, and ZTi of 7.2 at 80% RH and RT, and its high performance was comparable to that of inorganic TE materials in terms of maximum efficiency at a low ΔT and RT condition. This hydrogel film showed the advantages of organic materials, such as stretchability, self-healing, and wearable properties. A flexible band-type TE module with 20 legs was demonstrated to afford a thermovoltage of −2.75 V at a low ΔT of 4.8 K, and the harvested electrochemical energy can be transferred to light an LED in an electric circuit. Finally, a colorful and wearable band-type TE module with dyed legs was demonstrated as an effective self-powered body-worn TE harvester for wearable electronics and an NIR-triggered all-organic TE device.

Broader context
Thermoelectric effects have the potential to play a role in carbon-free power generation from waste heat and in mitigating climate challenges. While many thermoelectric materials have been developed for powering electronics and cooling applications, there are few examples of thermoelectrics with a non-hazardous and eco-friendly composition. In this study, we first spotlight new highly-efficient, self-healable, and transparent thermoelectric hydrogels based on bisulfate, which is a nonhazardous and biodegradable anion. The thermoelectric hydrogels were designed as mixed ionic–electronic conductors, where n-type carrier transport and a selective carrier generation were optimized, to obtain the highest thermoelectric performance in organic materials at room temperature. Thanks to the non-toxic, self-healable, and transparent nature, the thermoelectric hydrogels with bisulfate are ultimately suitable for wearable applications. Thus, we demonstrated a colorful and wearable band-type thermoelectric harvester, which powered a light-emitting diode at a small temperature gradient (5.5 K). Moreover, the highly transparent hydrogels allowed harvesting heat energy from a light source, to provide a photothermal thermoelectric harvester. This work establishes thermal diffusion of bisulfate in hydrogels and inspires new strategies for body-worn thermoelectrics.
