    , Accepted 9th April 2013First published on 11th April 2013AbstractIn this article, we prepared poly(acrylonitrile)(PAN)/LiI/activated carbon (Ac. carbon) composite gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) and investigated its working mechanism in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time. The gel electrolyte, formed by a hot pressing method, is composed of poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) as a gelling agent, ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), I2, 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 1-N-butyl-3-hexyl imidazolium iodide. We synthesised GPEs with the addition of different concentrations of Ac. carbon instead of the ceramic filler for application in DSSCs. The TiO2 photoelectrode films with 20 μm thicknesses were prepared by the hand spray technique. In addition, we also prepared PAN/SiO2 (∼20 nm) based gel electrolytes using the same procedure without Ac. carbon, and compared them to the optimal results. The GPEs were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the cells and the electrical conductivities of the GPEs were measured from the complex impedance plots. We found that the PAN/Ac. carbon GPE shows the best electrical conductivity of about 8.67 × 10−3 S cm−1. Cyclic voltammograms reveal that the PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte itself has some catalytic behaviour, which may enhance its photovoltaic performance. Finally, we fabricated a DSSC based on this GPE and it exhibited the best solar cell efficiency of 8.42%, which is only 1% lower than that of a DSSC based on the conventional liquid electrolyte (9.5%).
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively investigated as a low cost method to exploit solar energy since the first model cell was reported by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991.1 Photoconversion efficiencies up to 11% have been achieved for the most popularly used liquid electrolyte with the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple in an organic matrix, such as acetonitrile based DSSCs.2 However, some undesirable intrinsic properties of liquid electrolyte, such as the leakage of toxic organic solvent and the evaporation of volatile iodine ions, significantly affect the devices' long-term durability and operational stability. Moreover, the leakage of electrolyte from a DSSC would be dangerous because the users would be exposed to the hazardous solution containing imidazolium salts, iodine, 4-tert-butylpyridine and lithium iodide. It is therefore necessary to develop cells with sufficient durability and safety in order to achieve the commercialization of DSSCs.3
To overcome these drawbacks, several attempts have focused on replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid-state electrolyte for the improvement of the sealing problem, better stability and simple fabrication processes of the solar cells.4–6 In solid polymer electrolytes, the absence of solvent can easily lead to serious problems such as crystallisation of the iodide salt and consequently the deterioration of the cell. The main difficulty in realizing such solid-state electrolyte devices is the imperfection of filling material into the nanosized pores of the anode to form an intimate contact at the interfaces, and thus most of the results prove that the conversion efficiency of DSSCs using a solid electrolyte is low, typically less than 5%.7 Hence small molecular gelators8,9 and in situ polymerized conducting polymers10,11 have been proposed to achieve sufficient penetration of the material into the porous photoelectrode. In order to overcome the drawbacks of liquid and solid electrolytes, an alternative solution has been attempted, in which both the liquid and the solid electrolytes are combined to form a quasi-solid electrolyte, or gel electrolyte. Owing to their unique hybrid network structure, gels possess simultaneously both the cohesive properties of solids and the diffusive transport properties of liquids. There are several advantages of using a gel electrolyte: non-flammability, negligible vapour pressure, relatively high ambient ionic conductivity (6–8 mS cm−1), intimate interfacial contact with TiO2, and remarkable electrolyte stability.12–15 For an “inert” gel electrolyte of poly(acrylonitrile), poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(vinylidene fluoride) derivatives, the ionic transport occurs in the solution phase. However, if the polymer employed possesses the ability to strongly solvate the cation, then both phases can be responsible for ionic transport. The GPEs usually contain a high fraction of liquid components, hence their mechanical properties are poorer than those observed for pure polymer electrolyte systems, or plasticized polymer electrolytes.16 So a plasticizer, usually a small fraction of a low molar mass polyether (e.g. PEG) or a polar organic solvent (e.g. ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC)), is introduced into the polymeric matrix to enhance the polymer conductivity properties, which ensures the long life of the cell and provides a satisfactory overall conversion efficiency.17
The solidification of ionic liquid-based electrolytes by the use of inorganic nanoparticles has been reported for transport, viscoelastic and microstructure properties and high performance DSSCs.18,19 Viscous ionic liquids such as 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium iodides ([RMIm]I, R = pentyl, hexyl, and nonyl) became more fluid and the viscosity decreases as the amount of added iodine increases, which enhances the ionic conductivity.20 The nanocomposite ion gel electrolyte is composed of organic and inorganic sub-phases. The organic sub-phase serves as the medium for ion conduction. The performance of electrolytes using TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3 and ZnO has already reached the same level as that of ionic liquid electrolytes.21–25 In the nanocomposite GPE, the organic sub-phase works as the holding framework for the dispersive inorganic nanoparticles. These nanoparticles can prevent volatility and leakage of the electrolyte and also improve the mechanical strength of the cell. However, these nanoparticles are prone to aggregate and then grow into larger particles. The larger particles could deposit onto the surface of the TiO2 film and retard the ion transportation on the electrode surface. As a result, the efficiency of the solar cell declines dramatically after these two sub-phases separate.26
In this report, we attempt to study the conduction mechanism of PAN/Ac. carbon as well as PAN/SiO2 GPEs. We systematically derived the working mechanism of a DSSC based on an Ac. carbon GPE for the first time. The results of both gel electrolytes were analysed and compared based on conductivity as well as the photovoltaic properties.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of dye-sensitized nanoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes
In order to prepare a nanoporous TiO2 film, transparent conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (12 Ω per square) was completely cleaned with acetone and ethanol. The TiO2 working photoelectrodes were prepared by the spray pyrolysis technique, starting with a colloidal solution containing 3–5 nm particles in a 2.2% suspension which was reported in the literature.27 This colloidal TiO2 solution (20 ml) was ultrasonically mixed with 5.5 ml of acetic acid, 5 drops of Triton X-100 and 0.3 g of P-25 TiO2 powder. The mixture was sprayed onto FTO glass plates maintained at a temperature of 150 °C. Then the plates were heated at 500 °C for 30 min in air. The adsorption of N-719 dye, cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II), was carried out by soaking the TiO2 plate pre-heated at 80 °C in an acetonitrile–tert-butanol (1:1,v/v) solution. The active area of the fabricated DSSCs was ca. 0.25 cm2.
2.2 Preparation of polymer gel electrolytes
The composition of the polymer gel electrolyte is as follows: EC (0.4 g), PC (0.2 g), PAN (0.225 g), 1-N-butyl-3-hexyl imidazolium iodide (0.249 g), I2 (0.008 g) and Ac. carbon (Mw = 1201 g mol−1, Sigma Aldrich, USA) or SiO2 (Aerosil, fumed silica, surface area 90 ± 15 cm2 g−1, Nippon Company, Japan). The composition of the redox species was also optimized in the electrolyte medium. The desired amount of acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran was used as a binary solvent. The contents were well mixed ultrasonically after the addition of each component. Then the resultant mixture was heated with stirring up to 120 °C until a viscous gel was obtained. The gel was pressed between the two glass plates to obtain films with thickness of about 25 μm. The films were stored in a desiccator before further use. Similarly we optimized the concentration of EC (0.525 g) and PC (0.750 g) to make a fine gel for obtaining the best solar cell performance.
2.3 Preparation of the solar cell
The GPE was placed on the dye-sensitized TiO2 film followed by heating at 80 °C in an oven to form a very viscous gel. Finally, a sandwich-type DSSC configuration was assembled by holding the platinum plate counter electrode together with the TiO2/electrolyte with two clips. The GPE film thicknesses were typically in the range of 25–30 μm.
2.4 Instruments and measurements
XRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku RINT Ultima-III with the angle 2θ in the range of 10 to 70°. The surface morphology of the polymer electrolyte films was observed using a JEOL JSM-7001F field emission scanning electron microscope. The ionic conductivity was calculated from the complex impedance measurements and cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements performed using a computer controlled 1280C electrochemical test system, Solartron Analytical, Japan. We carried out CV measurements for the DSSC device (TiO2 photoelectrode/gel electrolyte or liquid/Pt catalyst), and also for the gel electrolyte only, using the configuration Pt/gel electrolyte/Pt. The frequency range was 0.01–100 kHz, and the magnitude of the modulation signal was 10 mV. Current density vs. voltage (J–V) and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using a calibrated JASCO CEP-25 BX solar cell evaluation system. An external bias was applied to the cell and the photocurrent generated was measured by a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The calibration was done using a EKO-LS-100 spectroradiometer and a calibrated silicon photodiode. The voltage step was 20 mV and the sweeping time was 25 mV s−1. The active area of the DSSC was controlled at 0.25 cm2 using a mask. Paraffin wax was used to temporarily seal the solar cells, which is useful for quickly comparing different electrolytes. All of the measurements mentioned above were carried out at ambient temperature.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 X-ray diffraction

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of GPEs prepared using (a) SiO2, and (b) Ac. carbon by mixing with the PAN polymer matrix. Fig. 1(b) shows the chronological increase in amorphicity at a particular concentration (0.01 g) of Ac. carbon mixed with the poly(acrylonitrile) compared with the SiO2 sample. A broadened peak was observed for all the samples at around 20°, related to PAN polymer host. Most of the XRD patterns indicate an almost completely amorphous nature, which indicates that all the components (I2, LiI, EC, PC, and PAN) are mixed properly to form a gel electrolyte. One strategy to reduce the crystallinity is the introduction of plasticizers such as EC, PC and tetraethylene glycol into polymer electrolytes.4

3.2 SEM and EDS analysis

Fig. 2(a) shows the PAN/Ac. carbon GPE dried film surface, revealing that the film has some porous morphology and Ac. carbon is uniformly distributed throughout the film. These pores are favourable for transportation of iodine ions, resulting in the improvement of ionic conduction. In the gel state, pores filled by ionic liquid allow the iodide charge carriers to transfer easily from the counter electrode to the dye-coated photoelectrode. The presence of C and I are confirmed, as indicated by red and green colours respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the surface of the PAN/SiO2 GPE film, in which the SiO2 particles are distributed randomly. In this GPE, the improvement of ionic conductivity is attributed to the hopping mechanism due to the space charge layers in the gel state, as well as Lewis acid–base interactions between the LiI salt and the PAN polymer matrix. In Fig. 2(b), red and purple colours indicate the presence of Si and I, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the EDS spectra corresponding the above GPEs. In the spectra, C, N and O elements originated mainly from the polymer, and Li and I from LiI, respectively. A part of the C in Fig. 3(a) is from the Ac. carbon additive, and part of the O and Si elements in Fig. 3(b) are attributed to the SiO2 additive. The FE-SEM images of both GPEs are shown in the ESI, Fig. S1.† The general structure of poly(acrylonitrile) is as follows:

3.3 Electrical conductivity
The electrical conductivity of the polymer electrolytes was determined by complex impedance measurements at ambient temperature. The ionic conductivities were calculated using the equation σ = l/RbA, where l is the thickness, Rb is the bulk resistance, and A is the contact area of the electrolyte film during the experiment. The resistance (Rb) is given by the intercept of the impedance plot with the real axis. The earlier report indicates that the increase of conductivity is favourable for the improvement of light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency.23 The maximum electrical conductivities of the GPEs based on PAN with the additives Ac. carbon (5 wt%) and SiO2 (12 wt%) are found to be 8.67 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 1.32 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. Along with these dopants, the C–N groups in the polymer PAN may contribute to the respectable conductivity through the organization of iodide species in the GPE systems.

(a) Conduction mechanism of PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolytes. 
Recent reports of carbon nanotube (CNT) based polymer gel nanocomposites interestingly studied their application in DSSCs,28,29 but the detailed mechanism has not yet been clarified. Benedetti et al.28 suggested that the higher electrical conductivity observed with the addition of small amount of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is probably due to the contribution from the electrical conductivity of the system provided by the presence of MWCNTs. Wang et al.30 explained that the enhanced electrical conduction with the addition of CNTs to the epoxy is due to the occurrence of conductive pathways at a critical filler concentration (percolation threshold). In this section we explain the conduction mechanism of PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte very clearly. The Ac. carbon based composite polymer gels can be characterized as phase-separated binary systems, where the ionic transport is considered to be only affected by an obstruction of the interconnecting carbon network. A large open network structure derived from a lower concentration of gelling agent minimizes the obstruction of ionic migration in the carbon composite ion gels. The amount of carbon powder added and reduction in the total ionic carrier concentration are also kept to a minimum for the gelation. Consequently, a higher ionic conductivity of the carbon composite ion gels can be achieved. The concentration effect of the Ac. carbon on the conductivity of the gel electrolyte is schematically represented in Fig. 4. Generally, in the mechanism of colloidal electrolytes, carbon powders are postulated to interact with the structure of the surrounding liquid electrolyte to form a double layer or space charge layer. These interfacial regions (Fig. 4(a)) are the source of an electric field, therefore will tend to affect the mobility of ionic species like I3−, I−, and cations. As the interparticle distances are reduced, ionic transport through overlapping space charge layers becomes a favourable mode of ionic mobility. At the lowest Ac. carbon powder concentration, the grains are scarcely embedded in the pore cells with no contact between them, as shown in Fig. 4(b). At optimum concentration, the carbon particles make contact with their neighbours through space charge layers to form a continuous interpenetrating structure with an electrically conducting rather than ion conducting medium in the interparticle spaces. The space charge layers of the individual particles overlap to form a continuous network of favourable conduction pathways, as shown in Fig. 4(c). If we reach a higher concentration, the carbon particles themselves are interconnected, rather than the space charge layers, and a short circuit is formed between the electrodes which results in less ionic (I−, I3−) transportation due to aggregation in the electrolyte, although the electron conductivity increases, as shown in Fig. 4(d). This mechanism can be further applied for any other carbonic materials, such as CNTs and graphite nanostructures.

(b) Conduction mechanism of PAN/SiO2 polymer gel electrolytes. 
Especially in polymer ceramic composites, grain boundaries may affect the ion transportation, either by creating favourable ionic conducting pathways in their vicinity or through Lewis acid–base interactions, thus increasing the charge carrier concentration. In this case also space charge layers are formed on the surface of the SiO2 nanoparticles, as described for the carbon gel electrolytes. The transportation of ions (I3−, I−) between the nanoparticles via space charge layers in the PAN/SiO2 gel electrolyte is possible. The addition of fillers with Lewis acid surface groups usually leads to a reduction in ion pairing and therefore an increase in the ion conductivity. Silica filler apparently helps in retaining the solvent inside the pores. This is probably due to the fact that, with increasing nanoparticle content, a larger proportion of the liquid medium is physically adsorbed on the filler surfaces, and is thus less prone to evaporating quickly. This kind of trapping of the electrolyte inside the polymer gel electrolyte may be beneficial from a practical point of view, since the smaller vapour pressure causes a lower risk of ignition. In these nanocomposite electrolytes, the anion species (I− and I3−) are assembled around the nanoparticles and facilitate the electron exchange reaction.26 Shimano et al.31 reported that the local structure of ionic liquids at a nanoscale interface may be modified by confinement between nanosized silica particles, and this nanoscale confinement of liquid molecules may mediate a mechanism of ionic transport that requires enhanced ionic liquid concentration to form a rapid conduction path. However, as the SiO2 content further increases, the conductivity decreases due to the percolation effect,32 or the agglomeration of the nanoparticles.

3.4 Incident photon conversion efficiency

Fig. 5 shows the IPCE of DSSCs based on PAN/Ac. carbon and PAN/SiO2 fine GPEs (EC = 0.525 g, PC = 0.750 g). The IPCE results reveal that the PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte based DSSC has a higher conversion quantum efficiency compared to the SiO2 electrolyte based one. The IPCE is defined as the ratio of the produced electrons getting across the external circuit (nelectrons) to the injected photons (nphotons). The IPCE curves were measured under monochromatic light with 10 nm intervals, according to the following equation:  where I(λ) is the current given by the cell at wavelength λ, and ϕ(λ) is the incoming power at wavelength λ. The IPCE measurements were performed using a similar data collecting system as for the J–V measurements, but under monochromatic light from a xenon-lamp power supply, model PS-X500. The enhanced quantum efficiency may be due to the increase of ionic conductivity of the GPE, and also some catalytic effect of the Ac. carbon dopant. The catalytic effect is discussed in the CV analysis.

3.5 Cyclic voltammograms

Fig. 6 shows the CV of PAN/Ac. carbon, PAN/SiO2 GPEs and liquid electrolyte based DSSCs. The CV analysis reveals that PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte shows higher current at positive potential, 0.4 V to 0.5 V, compared to the other electrolytes, while in the negative potential range it is lower than the liquid electrolyte and higher than the PAN/SiO2 GPE. This additional catalytic behaviour along with improvement of conductivity enhances the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC, which is schematically described in the working device picture in Fig. 8. In addition, the catalytic effect of GPEs (Pt/GPE/Pt) was observed from the CV curves as shown in the ESI, Fig. S2.†

3.6 
          J–V characteristics

Fig. 7 shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSC based on the PAN/SiO2 GPE, with fixed LiI and different concentrations of SiO2 nanoparticles. The short circuit current density (JSC) of the DSSC increases appreciably up to 0.25 g (12 wt%) addition of nano-silica, and decreases with further addition. The higher ionic conductivity plays an important role in the regeneration of oxidized dye to obtain a higher photocurrent density for DSSCs.33 The improvement of ionic conductivity in our GPEs is clearly explained by the conduction mechanism. According to previous reports, it is evident that VOC is consistently higher for gel based DSSCs compared to the liquid DSSCs.34 The physical phenomenon can be understood from the following theoretical consideration:  where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electric charge, Iinj is the incident photon flux, ncb is the concentration of electrons at the TiO2 surface, and ket is the rate constant for the back-electron-transfer reaction. The VOC of a DSSC is kinetically limited by the back-electron-transfer reaction, where the electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 recombine with the I3− in the electrolyte. The higher VOC of gel based DSSCs is caused by the additional function of the PAN matrix in passivating the active TiO2 surface and partly suppressing the dark reaction.35 In addition, the less penetration of GPE into the TiO2 porous electrode or less contact with the surface of the nanoparticles compared to the liquid electrolyte may change the interfacial properties. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs based on the various concentrations of PAN/SiO2 nanoparticle GPEs are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 9 shows the J–V characteristics of DSSCs with various concentrations of Ac. carbon content in the PAN polymer matrix. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The increase of JSC with increasing Ac. carbon content can possibly be attributed to the improvement in I−/I3− charge transportation, or the reduction in the electron recombination. Huo et al. reported that the decrease of efficiency in the GPE based DSSCs compared to liquid electrolyte DSSCs is because of the increased electron recombination life time (τ). The increase of τ for a gel electrolyte based device revealed the much more rapid increase of the conduction band of the semiconductor than that of the liquid electrolyte based device, and a decrease in electron recombination at the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode–electrolyte interface, which was caused by the conduction band electrons of the nanoporous TiO2 photoelectrode being captured by the reduction of I3− ions.36 The higher conductivity and catalytic activities of the electrolyte with increasing Ac. carbon content, and a zero distance between the working electrode (TiO2) and counter electrode (carbon/FTO glass) in the present solar cell structure, both of which significantly reduce the internal resistance of the cell, are responsible for the enhancement of photovoltaic parameters. A schematic representation of the working mechanism for the solar cell based on the Ac. carbon gel electrolyte is shown in Fig. 8. At the optimal conditions, due to the catalytic effect of carbon, the ion transportation distance can be decreased. This may occur by two possible ways, as shown in Fig. 8. However, further increase of the carbon content in the electrolyte decreases VOC, JSC, and the energy conversion efficiency (η), which can possibly be attributed to the poor penetration of the electrolyte into the porous TiO2 electrode. This can possibly be attributed to the direct contact between the conductive all carbon GPEs and the conductive FTO substrate of the working electrode, which may form a short circuit, hence resulting in the poor photovoltaic performance of the DSSC. The ability to dissociate and extract the generated carriers within TiO2 nanomaterials under illumination by sunlight in conducting polymer solar cells is the foremost concern to augment the overall efficiency. In our present investigations, 0.01 g (5 wt%) of Ac. carbon added to the PAN gel electrolyte shows the best DSSC performance.

3.7 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

Fig. 10 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra and the equivalent electrical circuit of DSSCs based on PAN/Ac. carbon, PAN/SiO2 GPEs and liquid electrolytes. Each plot comprises three semicircles at different ranges of frequencies. The semicircles are denoted Rct1, Rct2 and Zw, referring to the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode and gel electrolyte or liquid electrolyte, the interface of the photoelectrode and gel electrolyte or liquid electrolyte, and the resistance of Warburg diffusion of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte, respectively.29,37 Fitting of the semicircles into Nyquist plots give the impedance parameters and series resistance values (R2), which are listed in Table 3. The Zw of the DSSC using PAN/Ac. carbon GPE gives a lower value of 19.503 kΩ compared to that of the DSSC based on PAN/SiO2 GPE, resulting in a higher efficiency of 8.42%. The impedance plot of the PAN/Ac. carbon and the PAN/SiO2 GPEs were also measured using two platinum electrodes. These impedance plots reveal that the charge transfer resistance of PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte, 28.75 kΩ, is lower than that of the PAN/SiO2 polymer gel electrolyte, 47.25 kΩ, as shown in the ESI, Fig. S3.† This implies that charge transfer resistance is reduced by the Ac. carbon additives, yielding fast ionic conduction from the platinum electrode to dyed TiO2 photoelectrode surface in the DSSC device configuration.

Finally, DSSCs were prepared based on the optimal concentration of Ac. carbon (5 wt%) or SiO2 (12 wt%) mixed with PAN by changing the composition to EC = 0.525 g and PC = 0.750 g to synthesize a fine gel for the best solar cell efficiency. The J–V characteristics of the fine gel based DSSCs are shown in Fig. 11. An excellent efficiency of around 8.4% was obtained for the PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte based DSSC.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we developed the detailed mechanism of conduction and working for a DSSC based on PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte and compared its performance to that of a DSSC based on PAN/SiO2 gel electrolytes with optimal conditions. The mechanism can be applied for other carbonic materials, like CNTs and graphite nanostructures. The as prepared PAN/Ac. carbon, PAN/SiO2 polymer gel electrolytes exhibited maximum conductivities of 8.67 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 1.32 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. Impedance and CV analysis revealed that the PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte based cell has low internal charge transfer resistance and a higher catalytic effect. The SEM images of the PAN/Ac. carbon gel electrolyte showed the porous morphology which is favourable for ion transportation. EDS analysis of the polymer gel electrolytes showed the presence of I, C, N, O and Si elements in the samples. Finally, we obtained solar cell efficiencies of 8.42% and 7.51% for the DSSCs based on fine PAN/Ac. carbon and PAN/SiO2 composite GPEs, respectively.
