    , Accepted 30th March 2017First published on 31st March 2017AbstractIn order to provide a comprehensive investigation of TiO2 nanoparticle size in relation with different dye types in DSSCs, three sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles and two different dye types including a porphyrin dye (T2) and a ruthenium dye (N3) were synthesized. Steady state current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were investigated for the fabricated DSSCs and the results demonstrated that the optimum TiO2 nanoparticle size changed with the dye type. The obtained J–V data were interpreted by cyclic voltammetry, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, BET measurement, DFT calculation, IPCE measurement and impedance spectroscopy. The results for the N3 dye show that the surface area of the TiO2 nanoparticles is a key factor for the N3 cells, which is restricted by TiO2 pore diameter and surface state traps. In contrast, the density of localized states of the TiO2 film under the LUMO state of the porphyrin dyes is the dominating factor for the performance of the solar cells, which is restricted by the surface area of the TiO2 nanoparticles. These obtained results represent a significant advance in the development of porphyrin, ruthenium and even solid electrolyte DSSCs.
Introduction
Nanomaterials are known as materials that can sense a low molecular effect and convert it to a practical feature. Dye-sensitized solar cells1 (DSSCs) are the best example of this convention. In these devices, any individual dye molecule operates as a molecular manufactory to generate an excited electron. In each molecular manufactory, sunlight and a low energy electron are taken as raw materials to produce an excited electron as a product. This product is injected to a semiconductor, which operates as an electron collector and transporter. In this situation, the high surface area of a nanostructure semiconductor provides a good junction between the dye molecules and the semiconductor. The high surface area of the nanostructure semiconductor increases the dye adsorbance on a specific area and the conversion efficiency of the solar cell is increased as previously reported.2,3 The high surface area of a nanostructure semiconductor depends on its size4 and porosity.5
At present, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are known as the best nanostructure semiconductors for DSSCs. This is due to the large surface area, appropriate energy states, high tendency to accept electrons from dyes and availability of TiO2 nanoparticles.3,6–10 In addition, by changing the particle sizes and morphologies, one is able to fine-tune these properties.
The TiO2 nanoparticle size effects DSSCs, which were fabricated with N719 dye, and were investigated by Yanagida et al.11 They found that TiO2 nanoparticle size has a reverse effect on the diffusion coefficients and recombination lifetimes, which give an optimized particle size for highest conversion efficiency. Cao et al.12 emphasized the effective surface area and pore size as important factors for optimizing the particle size with ruthenium dyes. Also, Tan et al.13 investigated the relationship between surface area and pore sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles in photovoltaic performance. Furube et al. also reported that TiO2 nanoparticles with diameters under 50 nm give a high electron injection yield of around 90% with N719 dye, whereas larger diameters give low efficiencies of about 35 to 70%.14
Recently, unsymmetrical porphyrin dyes have shown a high conversion efficiency, even more than ruthenium dyes.15 An important advantage of porphyrin dyes is their natural resources such as chlorophyll.16,17 Another advantage of the porphyrins is their ability to easily change their properties (physical, chemical and optical) by engineering of porphyrin structures.18,19 One can tune those important porphyrin properties, ca. energy levels,20,21 light absorption,22 stability,23 kinetics of oxidized dyes regeneration,24 electron lifetime25 and aggregation,26 by modifying the porphyrin structures.
Despite the remarkable advantages of unsymmetrical porphyrin dyes’ “high conversion and adjustable properties” in conjunction with TiO2, the effect of the TiO2 nanoparticle size on these types of dyes have not been investigated.
Therefore, three different sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and used for preparing DSSCs. The standard ruthenium dye (N3) and a porphyrin dye (T2) are used for the investigation of TiO2 nanoparticle size effects on DSSCs’ conversion efficiency (Fig. 1). The T2 dye is selected because of its high conversion efficiency27 and its molecular structure, whose long alkyl chains are eliminated at the end of the T2 molecular structure rather than other high efficiency porphyrins. This elimination reduces the dye size effect on electrolyte diffusion in the TiO2 film pores.

The experimental results show that the effects of TiO2 size on cell efficiency are reversed, when they are in conjunction with different dye types. This effect was investigated and interpreted using cyclic voltammetry, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, BET measurements, DFT calculations, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements and impedance spectroscopy.
Results and discussion
Three kinds of TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized at different hydrothermal temperatures. The XRD diffraction pattern of the TiO2 nanoparticles sintered at 500 °C is shown in Fig. 2. Peak assignments for all of the samples indicate that TiO2 crystals are in an anatase phase, even at high temperatures. These results confirm the fact that acetic acid under hydrothermal conditions prevents anatase nanoparticle aggregation and consequently prevents rutile phase formation.28 The average crystal size of the TiO2 nanoparticles was calculated with the Debye–Scherer equation and the results are displayed in Table 1. As a consequence of increasing the hydrothermal temperature, the crystals were grown by the process of dissolving and recrystallization under hydrothermal conditions. Also, the specific surface area (SSA), which was mathematically calculated from the average crystal size,29 increased with reducing nanoparticle size.

Both AFM and FESEM images support the XRD results and were used for investigating the morphology of the sintered TiO2 nanoparticles (see Fig. 3). These results indicate that the crystal sizes are increased by increasing the hydrothermal temperature. Despite the fact that all of the TiO2 pastes were prepared and sintered using the same method, the morphology of the A-210 film is different from the others. This fact can be explained by considering the neck development using a sintering process, which for smaller TiO2 nanoparticles is more pronounced. This can cause shrinkage in the TiO2 nanoparticles and consequently create cracked islands, which appear on the images of the A-210 sample.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a fundamental electrochemical technique for the characterization of TiO2 nanostructure properties.30 A typical voltammogram shape of TiO2 nanoparticle films can be described as a simple model including a constant resistance (Rs) connected in series with a parallel mixture of two exponentially potential dependent elements: (a) a capacitance which increases in the negative scan and (b) a Faradaic resistance (RF), which decreases in the same scan direction (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Equivalent circuit for cyclic voltammetry investigation. 
Faradaic resistance comes through charge transfer between TiO2 and an electrolyte. When RF in the upper model increases or Faradic current (IF) is reduced, the current in the voltammogram is independent of the Faradaic current. Therefore, the voltammogram shapes can be described more simply as a combination of constant resistance (Rs) and a capacitance, which are connected in series (RC circuit).31
In dye-synthesized solar cells, the Faradaic current can be reduced by using additives32,33 into an electrolyte and a blocking layer for TiO2.34 Also, in cyclic voltammetry measurements, the Faradaic current can be diminished by a fast scan rate. In this situation, the scan rate is faster than charge transfer and the IF is ignorable.
Cyclic voltammograms of synthesized TiO2 nanoparticle are depicted in Fig. 5. All measurements are carried out under high scan rate conditions (0.3 V s−1). The CV curves of the B-230 and C-250 electrodes, especially in a more negative region are the same and exhibis a cathodic current with almost linear growth, while the A-210 electrode has an exponential behaviour in that mentioned region. As previously reported by Fabregat-Santiago et al.35 the cathodic current (Ic) for an RC circuit can be calculated with eqn (1): VC = V1 − st − RsIc(1)where VC is the capacitance voltage, V1 is the initial scan voltage, s is the scan rate and t is the time. In the B-230 and C-250 electrodes the capacitance of the TiO2 thin film has increased drastically; on the other hand the VC potential has decreased. Consequently, the operation potential term (V1 − st) becomes comparable with the RsIc term, which creates a resistive regime with a linear shape (see cathodic scan direction at −0.7 to −1.1 V). In the A-210 electrode the capacitance of the TiO2 thin film has reduced drastically; on other hand the VC potential has increased.
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammogram of TiO2 electrodes (scan rate: 0.3 V s−1, 0.5 M LiI in acetonitrile). 
Consequently, the operation potential term becomes comparable with the VC term, which creates a capacitance regime with an exponential curve. Furthermore, the Rs can be calculated from the potential differences between the points at which the current is zero and the final cathodic potential divided by the current at the final cathodic potential.35 The calculated Rs values for A-210, B-230 and C-250 are 150, 111 and 55 Ω respectively. These findings indicate that Rs decreases along with an increase in the TiO2 nanoparticle size.
The peak at the low cathode potential of the cyclic voltammogram of the A-210 electrode is attributed to trapping of electrons in the surface states. Gómez et al.36 have demonstrated that the surface state traps are located at grain boundaries (GBs) and are created by defects in the GBs. The development of surface state traps depends on the particle size and morphology of the TiO2 film.11,37 Having the lowest grain size distributions among these three electrodes, the A-210 TiO2 electrode displays a distinguishable peak at 650 mV, which can be assigned to these surface states. In general, surface state traps in the CV experiments increase the Faradic current, which changes the shape of the CVs and reduces the maximum of the anodic current. These traps in DSSCs cause charge transfers from the TiO2 to the electrolyte and consequently reduce the efficiency of the solar cells.
In a purely capacitive electrode (without Rs and RF) the current is solely formulated from the capacitance response of the CV as below: (2)where s is the scan rate. As mentioned above, the RF can be eliminated by a high scan rate. On the other hand, the Rs effect on the CV can be corrected by discounting the RsIc term from the operating potential. In this situation, the capacitance behaviour of the electrode is directly related to the density of localized states (Θt):35 C = Cae(−αeVc/(kBT)) + Cb(3) (4)where Ca is the prefactor of the exponential increase, Cb is the quasi-constant capacitance at low potentials, α is a coefficient of exponential distribution of trap states (α < 1), Vcb is the conductive band potential, L is the film thickness, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Consequently, with a rough approximation, the density of states for a purely capacitive electrode can be calculated by dividing the CV current by the scan rate, while the film area is also considered.
The obtained experimental data for cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 5 and 8) indicate that the density of localized states increases with nanoparticle size. This means that the density of states in the electron acceptor (TiO2) has increased along with TiO2 particle size growth. Photocurrent–voltage curves of the fabricated solar cells with the N3 dye are displayed in Fig. 6a and their data are summarized in Table 2. As a result, the B-230 photoanode shows the best conversion efficiency due to its higher short circuit current density (Jsc).

The Isc relates specifically to the intrinsic properties of the dye and the amount of the dye adsorbed on the specific surface area. The amount of dye adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 thin films was measured by desorbing the dye layer in appropriate solvent using electronic absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 6b).
The results indicate that dye loading on the surface of the TiO2 films is enhanced by diminishing the TiO2 nanoparticle sizes. This effect is more pronounced from the C-250 to A-210 samples. Consequently, a decrease in the TiO2 particle sizes causes an increase in the specific surface area (see BET results in the ESI†), higher dye adsorption on the surface of TiO2 and the generation of more electrons per a specific surface area (consequently a better Jsc).
These findings explain the advantage of the B-230 photo-anode compared to the C-250 thin film. In contrast, the A-210 photo-anode, which has the highest surface area and dye adsorption, shows a lower Jsc than B-230. The different behaviour of the A-210 can be interpreted from the cyclic voltammetry results.
As previously stated in the CV results, for the A-210 photo-anode, increasing the Rs and lowering the RF causes a Faradic current enhancement compared to the other samples. This Faradic current enhancement causes some of the generated electrons in the cell to return to the electrolyte, in other words the Isc diminishes.
Another important feature of J–V measurements is the open circuit potential (Voc), the fluctuation of which with variation of the particle size is very interesting. The Voc of DSSCs depends on the Fermi level of the TiO2, which is directly related to the TiO2 conductive band.38 The UV-vis spectra and the CVs results (see Fig. S2 and S4, ESI†) indicate that an increase in the TiO2 particle size causes a negative shift in the conductive band of the TiO2 thin films (respect to Ag/AgCl). Despite the fact that this negative shift should have increased the Voc of the A-210 sample, the J–V measurement results indicate that the Voc for this sample is lower than the others.
The reason for this observed negative shift of the TiO2 Fermi level is likely the Faradic current effect on the Fermi level itself. As previously stated, this Faradic recombination occurred at the GB traps, which are more developed at the lower TiO2 nanoparticle sizes. The higher Faradic current of the A-210 sample shifted the Fermi level toward the positive potential, reducing the Voc. The increase in the Voc as a result of TiO2 particle size growth is more evidence that the Faradic current affects the efficiency of the cell, which in this case can clearly describe the low efficiency of the A-210 sample.
Finally, the mechanism and rate of this recombination can be investigated and interpreted by the fill factors of the cells. The identical fill factors for all cells show that the resistance for this kind of recombination is lower than the cell resistance and these traps catalyze electron transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte. In this situation, the recombination occurs at any operating potential, which causes the fill factor to become independent of this potential. These results confirm theoretical investigations of DSSC recombination, which suggest that recombination occurs at the conductive band and surface state traps with different mechanisms.39
Considering the variations of the short circuit current density and open circuit potential for the N3 dye solar cells, it is remarkable that increasing the surface areas of TiO2 films, as the most dominating factor, directly impacts “improving” the conversion efficiencies of those cells. However, at a certain point, increasing the surface area of the TiO2 films presents a reverse effect on the conversion efficiency of our cells, which in fact unexpectedly caused a higher Faradic current and internal TiO2 resistance.
In order to investigate the effect of the TiO2 nanoparticle size on porphyrin dyes, T2 dye is selected. Using the different grain sizes of TiO2, the J–V curves are plotted for T2 dye, for which the curve and data are presented in Fig. 7a and Table 3, respectively. Interestingly, compared to N3, an opposite result is obtained for T2 cells, in which the conversion efficiencies are significantly increased by the TiO2 particle size. For instance, the highest efficiency for the C-250 film was particularly driven by the higher value of Jsc, whereas this particular surface had lower dye adsorption on the surface of the TiO2 films (Fig. 7b).

T1 dye27 is another porphyrin dye which has a lower molecular diameter than T2 dye. The T1 dye J–V results (see T1 dye cells section in the ESI†) were presented giving confidence that the decrease of the TiO2 film pore size with the dye is not the dominating factor for the conversion efficiency of these cells (also see BET section in the ESI†).
In order to investigate the reasons for this Jsc enhancement for the C-250 film, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was performed to measure the absorption of the T2 dye on the TiO2 surfaces.
When T2 dye was adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 films, the absorption edges of the TiO2 films show a red-shift toward the visible region. This red shift is more important for porphyrin DSSCs than ruthenium DSSCs since porphyrin dyes have a weaker light absorption in this region. Therefore, this better light harvesting capability of the C-250 photo-electrode at the 380–460 nm regions may improve its efficiency in the DSSC. Considering all three types of TiO2 used for T2 dye, if these red shifts were responsible for better cell performances, the IPCE curves (see Fig. 7d) in the region between 380 and 460 nm would have increased.
The IPCE measurements reveal that the IPCEs have increased in all regions of visible light, not just at the particular mentioned region. Therefore, the high performance for the C-250 module is independent from the appeared red-shift at the absorption edge of the TiO2.
As a matter of fact, increasing the IPCEs with the TiO2 nanoparticle size should be dependent on a phenomenon that enhances the electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2 conductive band. This phenomenon is more pronounced for porphyrin type T2 dyes compared to N3, since these two dyes have different electronic excitation mechanisms.
In ruthenium dyes, light absorption causes a metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT), whereas in porphyrin dyes light absorption causes a π → π* electronic transition. Hence the ground states for these two are basically different;35 the mechanism and the tendency of the exited electrons for relaxations are different. In addition, the performance differences between these two types of dyes can be accounted for by considering the relative position of the triplet-states-energy-level of each type of dye compared to the bands of TiO2, which show a big difference in these dyes.
The triplet states of ruthenium dyes are located above the TiO2 conductive band and their excited electron quickly transfers to TiO2.40 In contrast, the energy levels in porphyrin dyes are placed below or near to the conductive band of TiO2 (see DFT calculations section in the ESI†), so no effective electron transfer from the dye to TiO2 seems possible.41
Another difference between T2 dye and N3 is that the T2 dye can aggregate, which can cause suppression of singlet–triplet annihilation.42 For these reasons, singlet–triplet transition in porphyrin dyes reduces electron transfer from the porphyrin dyes to the TiO2. Therefore, it is very interesting that here, the morphology of the TiO2 comes into play, weakening those unfavorable pathways (path 2 and 3 in Fig. 8) and increasing the Isc in the porphyrin type DSSCs.
 Fig. 8  TiO2 density of states (DOS) effects on the electron transfer rate. Right: DOS of titanium dioxide films calculated from cyclic voltammetry results. Left: Schematic diagram of electronic states for T2 dye and probability path for electron transfer (green lines: electron injection path, orange line: recombination paths from the dye). 
By dividing the current by the scan rate and subtracting the RsIc terms from the operating potentials in the CV data, the density of states (DOS) for the three TiO2 electrodes is calculated and presented in Fig. 8. Normalizing all data with the smallest DOS calculated for the A210 photoelectrode, the integrated area under DOS plots (regions between −1 and 0 volts) reveal that the DOS increased 50 to 39% for C-250 and B-230, respectively. Usually, the probability of electron transfer from the dye to TiO2 will increase, if the DOS development of the electron acceptor (TiO2) is placed under the LUMO of the electron donor (dye).8,30,43–45 Therefore, development of the DOS under the LUMO (singlet exited state) of the dye enhances electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2. This enhancement reduces the singlet triplet transitions, which are undesirable electron transitions in porphyrin DSSCs. Also, theoretical investigation of electron injection from dyes to semiconductors represented the important role of DOS in photo-generated electron injection.46 This important role is discounted in publications, because the TiO2 DOS is extremely developed under the triplet state of ruthenium dyes (standard dyes). But as we mentioned previously in this article the DOS of TiO2 is not sufficiently developed under triplet states of porphyrin dyes.
In addition, the CVs and UV-vis results indicate that increasing the TiO2 particle size enhances the difference between the LUMO energy levels of the dye and the conductive band of the TiO2. This overpotential enhances the driving force for electron injections, which causes a higher rate of electron transfer.25 These findings are more important in solid electrolyte DSSCs, in which the conductive band of TiO2 cannot be modified with lithium cations and tert-butylpyridine. In other words, variation of the TiO2 particle size can be used for altering the conductive band of TiO2.
Consequently, we suppose that these two factors (development of DOS and enhancement of the over-potential) can promote the probability and the driving force of electron injections, which increases the electron injection from the dye to the C path (path 1 in Fig. 8). As a result of porphyrin DSSC investigation, the performance of these cells can be increased by developing the semiconductor’s DOS, decreasing singlet–triplet transition and reducing the dye size.
In order to verify the CV results, impedance spectroscopy was used gaining better knowledge of the electron transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. A Nyquist diagram of impedance spectroscopy under high biased potential consists of three semicircles: the redox reaction on the platinum counter electrode surface, the electron transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and the diffusion impedance in the electrolyte, respectively.47 As previously reported by Itagaki et al.48 the charge transfer resistance (RCh) of the photoanode can be calculated by eqn (5), which is responsible for the magnitude of the middle semi-circle diameter in the Nyquist diagram: (5)where F is Faraday's constant, rarea is the ratio of actual surface area to photoelectrode area, κs is the dielectric constant, Ea is the conduction band energy level in the semiconductor bulk, CI3− is the concentration of I3− and s is the steady-state value of electron density in the TiO2 film. The magnitude of these diameters, particularly for high-performance solar cells, is attributed to the (RCh), which has an inverse relationship with the rate constant reduction of I3− on the surface of the TiO2 photoelectrode (k2).
Looking at eqn (5), again in high-performance solar cells that usually have a higher value of s, the total value of RCh is mainly dominated by the second term of eqn (5). Whereas in low-performance solar cells, because of the low value of , the RCh is dominated by the first term of eqn (5) and RCh has a direct relationship with k2 since the s decreases with the increase of k2. As a result, the diameter of the middle semi-circle in low-performance solar cells is enlarged by the Faradic current. As previously mentioned for low-performance solar cells, this increase indicates fast electron transfer from the TiO2 to I3− and is a sign of the low charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the impedance results confirm the cyclic voltammetry experiment that the Faradic resistances were increased by TiO2 nanoparticle growth.
The impedance spectra of the fabricated cells with T2 dyes are shown in Fig. 9 and the obtained diagrams were fitted with EC-Lab software (Fig. S6 and Table S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 9  Nyquist diagrams of the fabricated DSSCs with T2 dye. 
The diameter of the middle semicircle in the Nyquist diagram increased from B-230 to C-250, which indicates that the charge transfer resistance at these photoanodes was increased by the particle size. On the other hand, for the A-210 photoanode, the low performance of the cell causes an increase in the middle semicircle diameter.

TiO2 nanoparticle synthesis. 
TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified method, which has already been reported by Ito et al.50 2.1 g of acetic acid was mixed with 10 g of titanium iso-propoxide for 10 min. The precursor was poured into a solution of 50 ml water and 0.7 ml nitric acid while it was vigorously stirred. After 20 min, the temperature was slowly increased to 80 °C and refluxed for 3 h. After sonication, the mixture was centrifuged and transferred to an 80 ml autoclave until three-quarters of the vessel was filled. The resultant mixture was heated at 210, 230 or 250 °C for 12 h. After cooling, 0.5 ml nitric acid was added to the dispersion. It was then sonicated and centrifuged again (removing large unwanted particles). Finally, the resultant colloidal solution was dried at 85 °C for 10 h.


TiO2 paste preparation. 
TiO2 paste was prepared using a modified method which was previously reported by Gratzel et al.51 1.5 g of synthesized TiO2 was ground using 1 ml of water in a porcelain mortar. After 10 min of mixing, 8 ml methanol was added drop by drop into the mixture. The resultant mixture was transferred to a beaker with 25 ml of methanol and sonicated for 10 min. 6.5 g of α-terpinol was added to the mixture and sonicated for 10 min again. In the next step a 10% ethanolic solution of ethyl cellulose was mixed with the previous blend and sonicated for 20 min. The resultant solution was concentrated with a rotary-evaporator to remove all of the methanol and ethanol. Finally, the resultant paste was ground in a porcelain mortar until a semitransparent paste was gained.


Preparation of porous TiO2 photoanodes. 
The FTO glasses were cleaned by detergent solution, distilled water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. The washed FTO glasses were treated in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 60 °C for 10 min, and then the FTO glasses were again washed with water and ethanol. The prepared pastes were deposited onto the FTO glasses using the doctor blade technique. After that, the FTO glasses were dried for 10 min at 125 °C. This procedure was repeated to get an appropriate thickness near to 9 μm. Despite the fact that higher thickness of the TiO2 film improves the conversion efficiency, the A-210 electrode creates cracks on the surface. Consequently, for elimination of the cracks, a lower thickness was selected. After that a light-scattering paste was deposited using the same method. The electrodes were heated in a furnace at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and finally at 500 °C for 15 min. The TiO2 films were once again treated with 40 mM TiCl4 solution and heated at 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for another 15 min.

Cell fabrication

Preparation of N3 dye photoanodes. 
The TiO2 electrodes were cooled to 80 °C and immersed into 0.3 mM N3 dye solution (acetonitrile/tert-butanol 1:1) and kept at room temperature for 24 h to completely load the dye on the film surface.


Preparation of T2 dye photoanodes. 
The hot TiO2 electrodes (80 °C) were immersed into 0.1 mM T2 dye and 0.2 mM chenodeoxycholic acid solution (THF/ethanol 1:4) and kept at room temperature for 18 h.


Preparation of counter Pt-electrodes and DSSC fabrication. 
A hole with 1 mm diameter was drilled in the FTO glasses and they were washed with detergent solution under sonication. The washed glasses were kept in a 1 M solution of HCl for 20 h. After draining and drying them, a 5% H2PtCl6 solution in isopropanol was spin-coated on the surface of FTO glasses. Finally, they were annealed at 420 °C for 1.5 hour in air.
The prepared photoanode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with Surlyn. Finally, a drop of electrolyte solution was introduced into the cathode hole and the hole was sealed.

Conclusions
In this work, it has been shown that the optimum TiO2 nanoparticle sizes in DSSCs depends on the dye properties. In particular, for the ruthenium dyes (N3), the preferred excited state levels cause effective electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 conductive band. In these DSSCs, the surface area of the TiO2 film is the dominating factor for conversion efficiency and this factor is restricted by the Faradic current and pore diameters. These restrictions can be eliminated by using an appropriate additive in the electrolyte or by altering the morphology of the TiO2.
In contrast, the density of the localized states of the TiO2 film under the LUMO of the porphyrin dyes is the dominating factor for the performance of these solar cells, which are restricted by the surface area of the TiO2 nanoparticles. We suppose that the performance of these solar cells can be improved by developing of semiconductor’s DOS, decreasing singlet–triplet transition and reducing the dye size. In particular, increasing the TiO2 nanoparticle size enhanced electron injection from the porphyrin dye to the TiO2 nanoparticles by developing the TiO2 DOS, which increases the conversion efficiency in these cells.
