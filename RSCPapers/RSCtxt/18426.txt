This study investigates the impact of the dielectric environment on the size and binding energy of excitons in atomically thin, experimentally synthesized semiconducting monolayers [XPSe3, X = (Cd, Zn)] to address the critical problem of electron–hole recombination, which significantly hinders the efficiency of most photocatalysts. We employ a precise non-hydrogenic model surpassing the hydrogenic-based Mott–Wannier model. Our findings are among the first few demonstrations of an increase in exciton size (and decrease in exciton binding energy) as environmental screening increases. These findings have implications for photocatalytic water splitting and are not limited to metal phosphorus trichalcogenides, but can be applied to other classes of 2D materials as well. This work also compares metal-oxide photocatalysts, which have been the focus of much research over the past five decades, to non-oxide-based metal phosphorus trichalcogenide photocatalysts, which offer a superior alternative due to their ability to address issues such as light-harvesting inability in the visible spectrum and unwanted charge recombination centres. Furthermore, the implications of this study extend beyond photocatalysts and are significant for the design and development of next-generation optoelectronic devices that incorporate excitonic processes, such as solar cells, photodetectors, LEDs, etc.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting (PWS), as a renewable energy source, offers a solution to the apparent trade-off between the environment and development.1–3 It presents opportunities for sustainability in all human development endeavours requiring power consumption. Following the seminal contributions by Fujishima and Honda,4 PWS has attracted significant attention as a promising strategy for achieving sustainable solar-powered energy. However, a rigorous set of criteria determines whether a material is suitable for water splitting as a photocatalyst. Firstly, the material must have a bandgap that exceeds the thermodynamic potential of water (1.23 eV) while remaining below 3.0 eV, in order to maximize the utilization of solar energy. This is important as the visible spectrum of solar radiation constitutes more than 40% of the total energy available. Secondly, the band edges of the material must adequately straddle the water redox potentials. Lastly, the photoinduced dissociation of electron–hole pairs into free electrons and holes must overcome the Coulombic attraction and enable the transfer of free carriers at the solid/water interface. The effectiveness of photocatalysts is boosted by the enhanced separation of charge carriers.5–8
In 2004, the advent of graphene, in all its glory, marked a significant milestone in exploring two-dimensional (2D) materials.9 The exceptional properties of graphene stimulated numerous scientists to investigate additional 2D materials, including hexagonal BN,10 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),11 Mxenes,12 and Metal Phosphorus Tri Chalcogenides (MPX3),6,13 among others.14,15 This has led to exploring various potential applications in the realm of 2D materials. Of particular interest is the field of photocatalytic water splitting, which fits well with the principles of sustainable and eco-friendly energy, as discussed above. Photocatalysts based on 2D materials are particularly noteworthy among the various types of photocatalysts due to the primary reasons discussed herewith. One key advantage of 2D materials as photocatalysts is their elevated surface-to-volume ratio, which translates into a wealth of active sites available for catalytic reactions.16 Additionally, due to the significantly reduced migration distance arising from the atomic scale thinness of 2D materials, charge carriers generated within their interior exhibit faster migration rates towards the surface compared to those in bulk materials. This leads to a substantial decrease in the probability of photogenerated charge carrier recombination, thus promoting the efficiency of the photocatalytic process.17 Furthermore, both theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the elastic modulus of 2D materials is lower than that of 3D materials. This property allows for a more straightforward adjustment of electronic structure through strain in 2D materials, which can be advantageous for achieving desired outcomes.18 In this study, we have utilized this approach to improve the potential of photogenerated electrons and holes.
Additionally, the reduced dielectric screening in 2D materials leads to a significant excitonic effect, while in bulk materials, it is negligible.19 The properties of excitons, particularly their binding energy, play a crucial role and are a decisive factor in determining the suitability of a material as a photocatalyst. However, despite this, the exciton perspective of photocatalysts is frequently overlooked. Very few discussions are present in the literature. This is likely because of the humongous task associated with the analysis of exciton properties. In a recent article, Wang et al. emphasized the significance of adopting an excitonic perspective in the context of low-dimensional semiconductors for photocatalysis.20 In this study, we have utilized a state-of-the-art non-hydrogenic exciton model surpassing the hydrogen-based Mott–Wannier exciton model to investigate the properties of excitons. The materials examined in this study, metal phosphorus trichalcogenides, have yielded promising results that support their potential for PWS.
Over the past five decades, all the widely studied photocatalysts for overall water splitting have been primarily based on metal oxides because of their superior material properties, such as non-toxicity, environmental friendliness, chemical stability, and corrosion resistance.21 In the early years, TiO2 in rutile and anatase phases along with other metal oxides were explored dominantly for a long time. These materials include a variety of metal oxides containing metal ions of Zr4+, Ti4+, Ta5+, and Nb5+ with the d0 electronic configuration and Ge4+, Sn4+, Ga3+ and In3+, with d10 configuration, such as ZrO2, SrTiO3, SnO2, ZnGa2O4, Zn2GeO4 and so on.22,23 The conduction band bottom in metal oxide photocatalysts primarily consists of empty transition-metal d orbitals, and are situated at a slightly negative potential compared to 0 V (vs. Normal Hydrogen Electrode, NHE) at pH 0. Meanwhile, the valence band maximum, made up of O_2p atomic orbitals, lies buried around more positive than +3.0 V.24 This creates a band gap too wide to capture visible light, as previously noted.25 Therefore, their application in photocatalytic water splitting is greatly hindered because of their light-harvesting inability in the visible regime of the solar spectrum leaving the long-standing dream of visible-light-driven photocatalysis unfulfilled. Many strategies thereafter have been explored to enhance the activity of metal oxides. One such widely studied strategy consists in doping metal oxides with non-metal elements having atomic orbitals, such as N_2p, and S_3p, with energy higher than that of pure O_2p.26 This technique effectively decreases the band gap by creating a new energy level or state in the band gap without impacting the conduction band level. This results in a photocatalyst driven by visible light and possesses appropriate band edge potentials for the complete splitting of water. Oxynitride is a well-researched instance of such a phenomenon, wherein the valence band maximum (VBM) is reported to have shifted towards a higher potential in the following order: Ta2O5 < TaON < Ta3N5, while the position of the CBM remains almost unchanged. However, the dopants in these kinds of doped photocatalysts also act as recombination centres for the photogenerated electrons and holes, which is undesirable along with the unwanted associated complex preparation process.27–29 Therefore, pure or dopant-free materials have been highly sought after for better charge carrier separation.30 Herein, we have demonstrated that non-oxide-based, undoped, CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers, which belong to the metal phosphorus trichalcogenide family, offer a superior alternative to metal-oxide-based photocatalysts by addressing the issues mentioned above.
2. Computational details
The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)31–33 is used to perform structural and electronic calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. A generalized gradient approximation (GGA) based functional known as the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)33 functional is employed for electron exchange–correlation interaction. To avoid underestimation of the band-gap arising due to GGA–PBE, a mixing parameter of one-fourth of the exchange interaction is included using the Heyd-Scuseria Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06).34 The cut-off energy for the plane wave is set to 500 eV. The hexagonal Brillouin zone is sampled with a Γ-centered 15 × 15 × 1 k-mesh. Our calculation considers total energy and Hellman–Feynman force convergence at 1 × 10−8 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. To ignore the periodic interaction in the z-direction, vacuum space is set to 20 Å. A 3 × 3 × 1 supercell was adopted for the photocatalytic simulation to study its properties in order to avoid the potential issues with a small unit cell which may interact with neighbouring cells. This larger supercell size was adopted to minimize any undesired outcomes. Additional information regarding the computational methodology used for phonon dispersion calculation and Gibbs Free Energy can be found in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and stability
Layered metal phosphorus trichalcogenides, generally presented as MPX3 (where M = Mg, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, Sn and X = S or Se), have gained significant interest in recent times. Following Friedel's pioneering discovery35 of metal phosphorus trichalcogenides over a century ago, a broad spectrum of these layered compounds has been synthesized and examined. To date, various synthesis techniques have been utilized to produce bulk and low-dimensional MPX3. Chemical vapor deposition and mechanical exfoliation are among the widely used techniques for obtaining 2D crystals of MPX3.36–38 Specifically, the materials of interest in this study, namely CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers, have been exfoliated recently,36,39 which has motivated us to conduct further research. The optimized lattice parameters of XPSe3 (X = Cd, Zn) have been tabulated in Table 1, demonstrating excellent agreement with previous investigations, while the optimized unit cell has been displayed in Fig. 1. Both the monolayers having a hexagonal unit cell possess a P space group. Agreement in the lattice structure and parameters with the previous studies bolsters our confidence in the resilience of our computational material and structural design. This prompts us to examine additional stability criteria before delving into the investigation of other properties.

 Fig. 1  (a) Geometrical Structure of XPSe3: (a) top view, (b) side view and (c) ELF plot. 
In this regard, we computed the phonon spectra to check dynamical stability and cohesive energy to quantify the structural stability of the structures. The absence of negative frequency in the whole Brillouin zone, as presented in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† confirms the dynamical stability. Furthermore, cohesive energy for both the monolayers is computed using the following formula:  where X stands for metal atom (Cd or Zn). EM, EP, ESe, and EXPSe3 are the energies of a single Cd or Zn atom, one Phosphorus atom, one Selenium atom and a monolayer in the unit cell, respectively; whereas a, b, and c are the numbers of Cd or Zn atoms, P atoms, and Se atoms in the unit cell. According to the definition stated in the formula, materials that have a stronger binding energy demonstrate a greater positive value for cohesive energy. The cohesive energy values obtained for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 are 3.57 and 3.62 eV per atom, respectively. These values are smaller than that of graphene (7.7–7.9 eV per atom)40,41 but greater than some other experimentally synthesized materials like phosphorene (3.22–3.43 eV per atom),42 PbI2 (2.70 eV per atom),43 and BiI3 (2.69 eV per atom).44 The Electron Localization Function (ELF) plot 1(c) tells the localization of electrons around electronegative atoms (P and Se), while electrons are found to be depleted around the electropositive atom (Cd/Zn). This observation is in agreement with earlier research.45
The XPSe3 systems are further established as mechanically stable in accordance with the Born–Huang elastic criteria for mechanical stability,46 i.e., C11C22 − C122 > 0 and C66 > 0. Also, the calculated elastic constants are in good agreement with the previously reported47 values as can be seen in Table S4 (ESI†). The angular dependence of Young's Modulus and Poisson Ratio is examined by the orientation-dependent values, and the perfect circular plots affirm the isotropic nature of the systems, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
3.2 Carrier mobility
A photocatalyst must have high intrinsic charge carrier mobility, as it enables the transfer of charge carriers to the solid/water interface for the decomposition of water into H2 and O2 molecules (or photoredox reactions in general). An orthorhombic unit cell of XPSe3 (M = Cd, Zn) monolayer is utilized for the calculation of the carrier mobility and the details of the structural parameters and band dispersion are provided in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† Table 2 presents the elastic constants, deformation potentials, and effective masses of the charge carriers, governing the carrier mobility in the system. The isotropic nature of the XPSe3 (M = Cd, Zn) monolayer carriers can be comprehended from Table 2. The acoustic phonon limited carrier mobility investigation has been conducted in the XPSe3 (M = Cd, Zn) monolayers, where two formalisms; the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) formalism51,52 against the Lang et al. formalism53 based on the effective mass approximation have been utilized. In the former formalism, the calculation of μ based on the BTE is expressed as:  where the minus (plus) sign is for the electron (hole). The εi(k) is the band energy and v(i,k) is the group velocity of the ith band state and τ is the relaxation time. The band energy is determined from the DFT, and the group velocities for electrons and holes are determined from the gradient of band dispersion as v(i,k) = ∇εi(k)/ħ, and relaxation time is derived from the collision term in the Boltzmann method,54 expressed as:  Here, the delta function symbolizes the elastic scattering process in the same band state.

In the latter Lang et al. formalism,53 the mobility is determined as:  where, Cx and Cy are the elastic stiffness constants and mx and my are the effective mass of electrons/holes along the x and y directions, respectively. ℏ is reduced Plank's constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin (Here T = 298 K). Ex and Ey are the longitudinal acoustic phonon limited deformation potentials for electrons/holes along the x and y directions, respectively.
Here, the parameters in the in-plane transverse direction are observed affecting the longitudinal carrier mobility. The mobility of the XPSe3 monolayers has been determined using both the BTE and Lang et al. formalisms. The mobility of the electrons and holes have been tabulated in Table 2 along two orthogonal directions, where notably large carrier mobility is observed in the XPSe3 monolayers using the two formalisms. The ZnPSe3 monolayer presented a high electron mobility of the order of 262.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (using BTE) among the two monolayers. A comparative analysis of the carrier mobilities based on the two formalisms has been made, where the BTE formalism is observed, resulting in slightly lower values compared to the formalism of Lang et al. The difference in calculated carrier mobilities between the two formalisms has resulted from the inappropriate determination of effective mass in the parabolic approximation to the band edges, which led to a lower estimate in the carrier effective mass and thus high carrier mobilities in the Lang et al. formalism. Such a difference has also been observed in the earlier studies on the carrier mobility in the graphdiyne nanoribbons, where these two formulations have been employed.52 Considering that the BTE formalism has demonstrated a closer agreement with experimental results in the case of MoS2 monolayers, it is anticipated that the carrier mobilities obtained from the BTE formalism can be experimentally achieved in these monolayers. Notably, the carrier mobility of the XPSe3 (X = Cd, Zn) monolayer is significantly higher compared to that of MoS2 monolayers, where the electron and hole mobility using BTE was found to be 44 and 86 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.55 These promising values of carrier mobility significantly favour the photocatalytic activity in the XPSe3 monolayers. Furthermore, the extent to which the ratio of electron to hole mobility deviates from unity, as measured by  is indicative of the rate at which carrier recombination occurs. The Rani values listed in Table 2 vary from 0.61 to 0.98, indicating that the separation of electrons and holes along the y-direction in ZnPSe3 will be relatively effortless. Correspondingly, the mobility is determined similar to the Ti2CO2, a member of MXene which is well known for its photocatalytic properties on account of high anisotropic carrier mobility, with a value of 254 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the x-direction and 611 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the y-direction.56 Thus, the monolayers exhibit superior charge transport properties due to their high carrier mobility with a moderate degree of anisotropy on top of it. This makes these monolayers a suitable photocatalyst.
3.3 Electronic properties
In the introduction, it was briefly mentioned that oxide-based materials have wide band gap energies, making them sensitive only to the near-UV region of the solar spectrum, which represents a small fraction of the total solar radiation.57 Consequently, there is an ongoing effort to develop new semiconductor photocatalysts with narrower band gap energies that fall within the visible range, while still maintaining a band gap greater than the minimum theoretical value of 1.23eV required for water splitting. A promising category of materials for water splitting utilizing visible light are perovskite oxynitrides, having the general formula PQOxNy, where P comprises Sr, Ca, Ba, and La; Q includes Nb, Ta, and Ti; and x + y = 3. The incorporation of nitrogen into the oxygen lattice sites influences the position of the VBM and CBM, resulting in a band gap that falls within the visible energy range (ranging from 1.8 to 2.5eV), with band edges covering both the HER and OER potential.58,59 Extensive studies have shown the efficacy of oxynitrides as photocatalysts for visible-light-driven water splitting.60,61 However, a major issue with oxynitrides is their high charge recombination rate, attributable to dopants acting as recombination centers. In another instance, our group previously reported indium-based monolayers, GaTeI and InTeI, which were shown to exhibit VBM at a higher position compared to those of conventional metal-oxides.62 This characteristic resulted in a reduction of the band gap, rendering these materials promising candidates for use in PWS applications. The electronic properties of CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers are studied for their potential in PWS, following optimization of their lattice parameters and confirmation of their dynamical and mechanical stabilities. The electronic band structure (represented in Fig. 2(a and b)) and partial density of states (PDOS) (represented in Fig. 2(c and d)) were studied, and both monolayers were found to have indirect bandgaps with conduction band minima (CBM) at high symmetry K and valence band maxima (VBM) at the Γ point. Calculations using the PBE functional estimated band gaps of 1.27 eV and 1.31 eV for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers, respectively. However, the PBE functional underestimated the fundamental bandgap, necessitating the use of the HSE06 method, which calculated band gaps of 2.24 eV and 2.31 eV for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, respectively. The PDOS analysis revealed that the bands around the VBM mainly originated from Se_p orbitals, while the bands around the CBM were contributed by P_s and Se_p orbitals. Fig. 3 shows that the higher-lying valence band maxima of CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, in comparison to other metal oxides such as TiO2 rutile, make them more suitable for water-splitting redox reactions. For example, the VBM of CdPSe3 was found to lie higher on the energy scale (around −6.2 eV) than that of TiO2 rutile (around −7.8 eV),24 despite having a smaller band gap of 2.24 eV compared to TiO2 rutile's 3.02 eV. This observation suggests that CdPSe3 has a high affinity towards the redox potential and possesses the ability to effectively capture a wide range of solar energy, thus demonstrating its potential suitability for utilization in photocatalytic water splitting applications.

3.4 Optical properties
Metal-oxide photocatalysts are limited in their ability to absorb light because they possess wide bandgaps (>3 eV), which restricts their light absorption to the UV region. The wide bandgap in these metal-oxides arises from their deep-lying valence band with respect to the Fermi level. This deep-lying valence band inhibits the absorption of light in the visible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is a significant limitation, as visible light constitutes more than 40% of the total spectrum. Therefore, reducing the bandgap is essential for the efficient absorption of visible light, which can enhance the overall photocatalytic activity. Bandgap engineering and free-carrier-induced Localized surface-plasmon resonance (LSPR) are among the major techniques employed to achieve enhanced light absorption in semiconductors.64 Doping, adding impurities, and introducing disorder to the surface layers has been seen to introduce or create new donor or acceptor states in the band gap regime to reduce the bandgap for the sake of increased absorption in the visible range of the spectrum.65 The promising advantage associated with using metal phosphorus triselenides is that without any external engineering, they exhibit excellent light absorption in the visible as well as in the UV regions. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the absorption coefficients of CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, based on HSE06 hybrid density functional calculations, are significantly higher in the visible region, with values of 1.32 × 105 cm−1 and 2.47 × 105 cm−1, respectively, higher than that of many transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).66 The excellent light-harvesting capabilities of these monolayers suggest them as promising photocatalysts.

3.5 Exciton properties
Most semiconductors demonstrate inadequate H2 and O2 evolution activities in the absence of cocatalysts, despite the presence of a sacrificial agent.67 This inadequacy arises primarily from the prompt recombination of electron–hole pairs (or excitons) before reaching the surface for reaction. This recombination essentially occurs because of the high exciton binding energy, which hinders an easier separation of charge carriers.68 Consequently, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of the excitonic properties. Experimental and theoretical investigations conducted hitherto have unambiguously demonstrated that the fundamental excitonic characteristics of a three-dimensional bulk semiconductor are remarkably distinct from those of a two-dimensional monolayer of the same substance. In contrast to bulk, the electrons and holes that combine to form an exciton in the 2D monolayer are substantially confined to the monolayer plane and encounter diminished screening as a result of “nonlocal dielectric screening” which means an alteration or non-uniformity in the dielectric surroundings, which further leads to a non-hydrogenic Rydberg series of excited exciton states rather than a hydrogen-like spectrum. This essentially means that the conventional assumption of an exciton as a hydrogen atom will not correctly depict the characteristics of an exciton in 2D materials, thereby, demanding a more accurate model or formalism to describe the complex interaction of excitons in 2D materials.
Although the conventional Coulomb potential accurately describes the interaction between charges in bulk materials, it is insufficient for describing the interaction between confined charges in two-dimensional layers. In such cases, the Rytova–Kelydsh potential69 provides a more precise description for these systems, particularly for isolated monolayers and monolayers in the presence of non-uniform dielectric environments.70,71 Herein, employing the Kelydsh model, we have extensively explored the exciton length (or exciton Bohr radius) and exciton binding energy in various scenarios. The Rytova–Kelydsh (R–K) potential is presented below:  The functions H0 and Y0 represent the Struve and Bessel functions of the second kind, respectively, while r0 denotes the screening length, expressed asr0 = 2πχwhere x is the 2D polarizability. Screening length or characteristic length (r0) has a special significance. At large distances between electrons and holes, i.e., for r ≫ r0, the R–K potential conforms to the typical 1/r pattern found in hydrogenic systems. However, for smaller separations, r ≪ r0, the potential diverges as log(r) due to the presence of screening from 2D dielectric sheets. The typical values of screening length (r0) for the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) class range from 3 to 5 nm;72,73 whereas it is 2 to 3 nm in Iodine-based GaTeI and InTeI semiconductors.62 To determine the 2D polarizability, one can utilize the ab initio derived value of the dielectric constant using the following formula:  Employing the stated methodology (more details provided in the ESI†), we computed the excitonic characteristics, specifically, the exciton Bohr radius (or the length of the excitonic extension) and exciton binding energy of isolated monolayers and monolayers in diverse dielectric environments. The exciton Bohr radius serves as a measure of the excitonic localization, where localized excitons exhibit higher binding energy while delocalized excitons manifest smaller binding energy.74 This trend has been seen at many occasions and Fig. S6(a and b) (ESI†) validates that our systems exhibit the same trend.74 The exciton binding energy and exciton Bohr radius along the x and y axes for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 in different dielectric environments are presented in Table 3. Fig. 5(a) confirms that the dielectric environment does indeed influence the size (or localization) of the exciton, which further influences or alters the exciton binding energy as visible from Fig. 5(b).

We studied the exciton properties with a varying range of average dielectric constants (). 2D metal phosphorus trichalcogenides have been synthesized on many substrates, including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), indium-tin-oxide (ITO), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and florine-doped tin oxide (FTO), which enabled us to strategically choose these materials to create distinct and varying dielectric environments.13,75 Fig. 5(a and b) illustrate the dependence of exciton Bohr radius and binding energy on the average dielectric constant, where a value of 1 denotes a monolayer suspended in a vacuum, and a value of 3.1 corresponds to an FTO substrate on one side and air/vacuum on the other. The observed increase in the Bohr radius with dielectric screening is in agreement with previous reports.76,77 Notably, the two extreme points on the graphs in Fig. 5(a and b) deserve special attention for the further understanding of exciton properties. At the low end of the dielectric constant range (i.e.,  = 1, monolayer suspended in vacuum), the exciton radius is small (6.70 A for CdPSe3 and 7.37 A for ZnPSe3), indicating localization, which results in a higher exciton binding energy of 0.664 eV for CdPSe3 and 0.596 eV for ZnPSe3. On the other hand, at the high end of the dielectric constant range (i.e.,  = 3.1, monolayer on an FTO substrate), excitons are more delocalized, with an exciton radius of 11.80 Å for CdPSe3 and 12.97 Å for ZnPSe3, leading to a small binding energy of 122 meV for CdPSe3 and 113 meV for ZnPSe3, which renders them promising photocatalysts. These values are benchmarked against some well-known photocatalysts, such as lead-free double perovskite and Perovskite-TMDC heterostructures and are found to be comparable, suggesting XPSe3 (X = Cd, Zn) towards robust photocatalysts on the ground of small exciton binding energy.
3.6 Photocatalytic water splitting (PWS)
Given the impressive absorption, carrier mobility, and band alignment properties of CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers, we conducted a thorough analysis to determine their potential as photocatalysts for water splitting. Our thorough analysis aimed to evaluate whether the photogenerated carriers could drive the overall reaction. Ue represents the maximum potential achievable by photogenerated electrons during hydrogen reduction, which is determined by the difference of the hydrogen reduction potential and the energy level of conduction band minima. Similarly, Uh represents the maximum potential of photogenerated holes during water oxidation, which is defined as the energy difference of the hydrogen reduction potential and the valence band maxima.80 At pH = 0, the photogenerated hole potential (Uh), is determined to be 1.779 V and 1.705 eV for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, respectively, which is comparable to that of the C3S monolayer (1.73 V).81 Similarly, the potential of photogenerated electrons (Ue) is determined to be 0.459 V and 0.604 V for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, respectively. The Ue and Uh vary with pH as Ue(pH) = Ue(pH = 0) + 0.059 × pH and Uh(pH) = Uh(pH = 0) − 0.059 × pH, respectively. The potential of photogenerated electrons and holes in a monolayer of CdPSe3 (ZnPSe3) at pH = 7, which is as high as 0.872 V (1.01 V) and 1.366 V (1.292 V), respectively, is similar to that of PdSeO3.80 A recent study on PdSeO3 extensively demonstrated that its Ue and Uh, having a magnitude of 1.15 and 1.69 V, respectively, are capable of driving the redox reaction. The similarity in the values of CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 to those of PdSeO3 indicates an increased photocatalytic efficacy in a neutral atmosphere. Moreover, high Ue and Uh in CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers also suggest that photoinduced electrons and holes are more likely to transfer to the solid–water interface to react with water rather than themselves, making them more resistant to photoinduced corrosion.80,82
In our investigation of the OER process, we studied a four-electron transfer process consisting of three reaction intermediates (OH*, O*, OOH*). Fig. 6 illustrates the changes in free energy concerning reaction intermediates. The characteristics of the reaction sites are provided in Table S1 in the ESI.† Furthermore, Fig. S1 (ESI†) outlines the reaction pathways of the OER and HER, while Tables S2 and S3 in the ESI,† present the values obtained from the calculations of free energy of the reaction steps. We have also shown that the monolayers show no residual geometrical changes after the completion of the redox reactions. Remarkably, after the release of O2, the monolayers revert to their original state, demonstrating their durability even under prolonged and repetitive reaction sequences. This has been explained in the ESI,† with Fig. S2 displaying the geometrical alterations that occur during the adsorption of intermediates. In the dark environment, that is, without any external potential (case Uh = 0), the formation of OH* from * and formation OOH* from O* is endothermic, while the formation of O* and O2 is exothermic, which implies that they are favourable. In the absence of light radiation, the endothermic nature of the first and third steps suggests that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not very favourable. The rate-limiting step is the formation of OH* from *, which has a limiting potential of 3.14 V (3.01 V) for CdPSe3 (ZnPSe3) and is comparable to that of Pd3P2S8, which has a rate-limiting potential of 2.77 V.83 Incorporating the intrinsic potential of photogenerated holes ( and ), a moderate external bias voltage of 1.36 V and 1.30 V for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, respectively, is required to drive the OER. These values are similar to the external bias voltage required for SiCP2 (0.85 V),84 and lies in the range of those of many transition metal carbides and oxides (0.49–1.70 V),85 with the advantage of not using precious metals such as ruthenium and iridium, escaping the bottleneck of scarcity and high cost associated with them.86

We further studied the HER process, where we note that under dark conditions (U = 0), the formation of H* is endothermic, with a ΔG of 1.46 V and 1.38 V for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, respectively. These values are lower compared to the GaTeI and InTeI photocatalysts.62 The subsequent conversion of H* to H2, however, is exothermic at pH = 0. Notably, under the electrode potential (Ue) of 1.46 V and 1.38 V for CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3, respectively, both the elementary processes of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exhibit a downhill trend, leading to a spontaneous process. It is worth noting that a moderate external bias of 0.99 V in CdPSe3 and 0.77 V in ZnPse3 is sufficient for this reaction, which is significantly lower than the requirements of other non-oxide based GaTeI (1.50 V) and InTeI (1.93 V) photocatalysts,62 with the help of intrinsic potential of photogenerated electrons ( and ).
The manipulation of 2D materials via strain is a crucial approach towards adjusting their electronic structure and characteristics, which has elicited considerable research attention. Because of their atomic-scale thickness and impressive in-plane and out-of-plane deformation abilities, various techniques can be employed to create strain in these materials, such as via piezoelectric substrate, lattice mismatch, AFM tip, and so on.87 The results depicted in Fig. 7 demonstrate that subjecting both monolayers to biaxial compressive strain can induce an upward shift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) relative to the water reduction potential, thereby potentially enhancing the photogenerated electron potential. Consequently, the requirement of moderate additional external bias for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) may be effectively reduced through the utilization of biaxial compressive strain. In a similar manner, applying tensile biaxial strain causes the VBM to move downward, indicating an increased potential for photogenerated holes, which can further reduce the requirement for an external bias voltage.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we delved into the photocatalytic properties of CdPSe3 and ZnPSe3 monolayers by examining their mechanical, optical, charge transport, and electronic properties in-depth while emphasizing the excitonic perspective. Our investigation of exciton properties utilized a robust, state-of-the-art non-hydrogenic model, which led us to uncover that the exciton binding energy can be favourably tuned to facilitate photocatalysis by manipulating the dielectric environment. Exciton binding energy as low as in the range of 100–600 meV, optical absorbance as high as in the order of 105 cm−1 in the visible region, high carrier mobility with a mild degree of anisotropy and a moderate external potential of 0.99 (0.77) V and 1.36 (1.30) in CdPSe3 (ZnPSe3) to drive the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, makes XPSe3 (X = Cd, Zn) promising candidates for overall photocatalytic water splitting. Biaxial compressive strain enhances the potential of photogenerated electrons, while tensile biaxial strain increases the potential for photogenerated holes, reducing the requirement for external bias voltage in the HER and OER. The utilization of non-noble metal-based photocatalysts provides a compelling alternative to those that rely on noble metals, such as ruthenium and iridium. The incorporation of non-noble metals endows these photocatalysts with the inherent advantage of circumventing the bottlenecks associated with the scarcity and high cost of their noble metal counterparts. This approach and these findings can be extended to other types of 2D materials, paving the way for further research on optoelectronic properties in them from an excitonic perspective.
