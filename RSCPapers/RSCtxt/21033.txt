    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractRechargeable metal batteries using selenium or selenide as the cathodes have attracted considerable attention during the past few years owing to selenium/selenide possessing a high volumetric energy density that is comparable to that of sulfur, a moderate output voltage and characteristics of environmental benignity. However, the applications of Se-based rechargeable metal batteries are hindered by the easy dissolution of polyselenides with severe instances of the shuttle phenomenon, poor cycle life and coulombic efficiency, low loading and low utilization of active materials, as well as the relatively high cost of selenium. To overcome these challenges, scientists have proposed various strategies, including optimizing electrode nanostructures, developing new electrolytes, and constructing novel battery structures. Herein, this review systematically introduces various nanostructured Se-based cathode materials, and new electrolytes and separators for Se-based rechargeable metal batteries, as well as investigating the electrochemistry of various Se-based rechargeable metal batteries and cell structure designs. We also present perspectives for future development in line with the preparation of high energy density, environmentally friendly and sustainable selenium-based energy storage systems.
1. Introduction
The combustion of fossil fuels causes serious environmental pollution and severe climate change, which seriously affect human life and sustainable development in the energy sector.1 Therefore, sustainable and green energy sources, e.g. wind power, solar energy, tidal energy, are crucial for addressing the issues that arise from the use of fossil fuels, but how to efficiently convert and store this clean and sustainable energy provides a great challenge to researchers. Nowadays, electrochemical batteries are considered as the best energy storage devices owing to their high storage capacity and low energy loss during conversion.2 Among various types, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) nearly dominated the market over the past few decades because of their portability, memoryless property, high voltage and relatively high energy density.2 However, the state-of-the-art conventional LIBs (graphite/LiCoO2 cells), even at their theoretical capacity (387 W h kg−1),3 are not capable of meeting future energy storage requirements for increasing electric vehicle transportation and large-scale smart grids.2 Therefore, exploration of new energy storage systems based on different electrochemistry is needed to go beyond incremental improvements in the specific energy of existing batteries.
Nearly all of the elements in group 16 (VIA) are high-energy cathode materials that can be coupled with metallic anodes (such as Li, Na, Mg).4,5 Owing to their ultra-high energy density and wide availability, oxygen and sulfur are the most compelling cathode materials among this group.4 However, Li–O2 batteries (also named Li–air batteries) suffer from slow catalytic reduction of oxygen, re-decomposition of discharged product Li2O, and poor cycle life, and are not suitable for mass production.3,6 For Li–S batteries, even though sulfur is nontoxic, cost-effective, abundant in nature, and exhibits high theoretical specific capacity and volumetric capacity density,3,7–11 it still faces several significant challenges: the insulativity of sulfur, heavy volume expansion of sulfur electrodes during discharge, and easy dissolution of polysulfides in electrolytes with severe polysulfide shuttling, all of which lead to low utilization, rapid capacity decay and poor coulombic efficiency.7,12
On the one hand, researchers have developed various strategies, such as encapsulating the sulfur in a carbon/polymer matrix,12–21 inserting interlayers or a separator coating,22–27 anode protection and modification,28,29 as well as developing electrolytes and binders,30–36 to solve these problems. Today, Li–S batteries are close to commercialization. On the other hand, researchers are also attempting to explore new electrode materials for advanced energy storage systems as alternatives. Elemental selenium, another element in group 16, has become an attractive cathode material, not only for rechargeable lithium batteries but also room-temperature sodium batteries, magnesium batteries and potassium batteries, because it possesses the same major advantages of S along with even better advanced properties than S.
Se-based rechargeable metal batteries commonly consist of a selenium cathode, a metal anode (Li, Na, K, Mg), an organic electrolyte and a proper separator, as shown in Fig. 1.37 During the discharge process, the element Se reacts with the metal to form metal polyselenide discharge products. A comparison of the relative properties for different Se-based rechargeable metal batteries is presented in Table 1. As can be seen, the Li–Se battery exhibits the highest theoretical specific energy (1155 W h kg−1) owing to it having the highest theoretical discharge voltage (2.0 V), while the electrode expansion could reach almost 100% during discharge. The K–Se battery shows the lowest theoretical specific energy of only 341 W h kg−1, and the electrode expansion goes up as high as around 180%. The Na–Se battery has a moderate theoretical specific energy (644 W h kg−1), while its electrode expansion is also very high (200%). Moreover, even the Mg–Se battery exhibits a moderate specific energy (630 W h kg−1), and its volume expansion is only 49%. According to the above comparisons from Table 1, the different Se-based rechargeable metal batteries have their own advantages and disadvantages. More importantly, the electrochemistry of selenium in the different rechargeable metal batteries is not yet well understood.38 The detailed redox reactions of Se, the exact intermediates during discharge, the compatibility and the behavior of Se in current organic electrolytes need to be further clarified.38 New suitable electrolytes and separators need to be developed for the present metal rechargeable batteries. The coulombic efficiency and cycle stability of Se-based rechargeable metal batteries also need to be further improved.

Thus, this review mainly focuses on the recent research progress on Se-based cathodes for Li–Se, Na–Se, Mg–Se and K–Se batteries (Fig. 2). We begin with the fundamental electrochemistry of Li–Se batteries, followed by the systemic introduction of Se-based cathode design and cell configuration design (interlayer/separator coating, electrolyte) in Li–Se batteries. We then give insight into the Na–Se battery redox mechanism and carbon–selenium composite cathodes for Na–Se batteries. Next, the recent pioneering works on Mg–Se and K–Se batteries will be briefly reviewed. Finally, remarks and perspectives for future research and development of selenium-based cathodes for electrochemical energy storage are presented.

2. Li–Se cells
The overall reaction of Li–Se cell is: Se + 2Li ↔ Li2Se, corresponding to a theoretical capacity of 675 mA h g−14. Owing to the high density of selenium, a high volume (3254 mA h cm−3) energy density could be achieved for Li–Se batteries. Furthermore, the conductivity of selenium is 1 × 10−23 S m−1, 20 orders higher magnitude than that of sulfur, indicating that the utilization of Se is much higher than that of sulfur when used as an electrode material for lithium batteries.39 Additionally, the polyselenide shuttle phenomenon is also weaker than that for polysulfide.39 Owing to the above described advantages, Li–Se batteries seems to have bright prospects for the future. However, several constraints still hinder the wider application of Li–Se batteries, e.g. the polyselenide shuttle phenomenon in some organic electrolytes, the low utilization of bulk Se, and the higher cost of selenium.39 Recently, scientists have explored many strategies to overcome these drawbacks, which we briefly review here in the following sections.
2.1. Nanostructured selenium cathode
The morphologies and particle sizes of the active materials are known to intensely affect the electrochemical performance of Li–Se batteries. Approaches have been developed to control the shape and size of the selenium cathode and the corresponding performances were also investigated.40–43
Incipiently, Wu et al.40 compared the electrochemical performances of nanoporous selenium and selenium particles, and found that the nanoporous selenium cathode exhibited smaller polarisation and charge transfer resistance. As a result, it delivered a higher initial capacity and reversible capacity in comparison with that of selenium particles.
Subsequently, Yang et al.41 used a high-energy ball-milling method to synthesize amorphous Se (a-Se) nanowires (NWs), crystalline Se (c-Se) NWs and crystalline/amorphous Se (c/a-Se) NWs. The chemical reaction processes between these active materials and Li+ have been studied. The results demonstrated that the Se helical chains were first reduced to Li2Sex (x ≥ 4) and then further reduced to Li2Se2 and Li2Se in the a-Se lithiation process, while in the c-Se NWs lithiation process, the Se helical chains were quickly reduced to Li2Se. That is because the c-Se NWs are more active and the covalence band in the Sex helical chains of c-Se NWs weakened, owing to the sufficient electronic and van der Waals forces between the Sex helical chain. Furthermore, the different (de)lithiation mechanisms caused distinct storage capacities in Li–Se cells: 755 mA h g−1 for a-Se, 705 mA h g−1 for c/a-Se, and 250 mA h g−1 for c-Se at 0.1C.
Recently, Muldoon et al.42 reported a safe, aqueous synthetic route to prepare nanostructured selenium with controlled structure and size through the utilization of different polymer templates. Rod-shaped, large sphere (d = 1 μm), small sphere (d < 300 nm), and hexagonal selenium particles could be obtained, respectively. As expected, the nanostructured Se cathode with these different shapes and sizes showed different capacities.
2.2 Carbon hosts for selenium
Undoubtedly, carbon hosts are the most popular choice to address the problems of Li–Se cells as their high conductivity can significantly improve the utilization efficiency of the active materials.39 More importantly, the absorption force between the carbon host and the Se molecules can inhibit the polyselenide shuttle phenomenon.44

2.2.1. Porous carbon–selenium cathode. 
Among carbon hosts, porous carbon materials with high surface areas, high electrical conductivities and large pore volumes have been most widely used to encapsulate the Se molecules.37,39 When infiltrating Se molecules into the pores, not only does the porous carbon matrix prevent the active material from leaving the cathode's side, but the continuous carbon networks can also promote the movement of Li+/electrons in the composites.39 Therefore, great improvements to the cycle performance and rate capability of Li–Se batteries have been achieved during the past several years by using porous carbon hosts.
Microporous carbon (pore size < 2 nm) can effectively restrict the dissolution of polyselenides owing to volume constraints.37,45 Dai et al.46 reported a metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived microporous carbon polyhedra (MICP) as the selenium host, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Owing to the large surface area and pore volume of the microporous polyhedra, a large amount of selenium (56 wt%) could be accommodated and the dissolution of polyselenides in the electrolyte was effectively suppressed. After 1000 cycles, the selenium@MICP composites still exhibited a reversible capacity of 283 mA h g−1. Huang et al.47 reported microporous carbon spheres (PNCs) as the selenium host, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The resulting Se/PCNs composite with 70.5 wt% selenium loading not only displayed an excellent volumetric capacity density of 3150 mA h cm−3, but also showed outstanding cycling stability with a capacity decay of only 0.03% per cycle over 1200 cycles. Recently, another kind of microporous carbon sphere (MiPCS) was also reported as a selenium host by Huang's group.48 The resulting Se/MiPCS composite showed a high initial capacity of 733 and 353 mA h g−1 at charge/discharge currents of 50 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively.

Mesoporous carbon (pore size 2–50 nm) with small pore size mainly accommodates the selenium and restricts the dissolution of polyselenides, like microporous carbon, while mesoporous carbon with larger pore size is beneficial for electrolyte infiltration and also for enhancing the amount of selenium that can be accommodated.39 CMK-3 as a typical mesoporous carbon has been selected as a selenium host by researchers.49,50
Guo et al.50 confined Se in the form of cyclic Se8 molecules in CMK-3 by a facile melt-diffusion route. They applied ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman characterizations to verify the lithiation/delithiation processes of Se/CMK-3. As shown in Fig. 4, during discharge, Li+ reacted directly with every single Se8 molecule in the mesopores of CMK-3 to generate the final Li2Se product, which is associated with the single-plateau discharge reaction, unlike the reaction between Li+ and bulk Se in the previous report that has two discharge plateau.51 When charged, chain-like Se was formed instead of cyclic Se8. In addition, the researchers found that the chain-like Sex molecules have a high electrochemical activity and strong interaction with carbon mesopores, both of which ensure Li–Se batteries with superior electrochemical performance. In addition, the MOFs are good candidates for synthesizing mesoporous carbon. Zhang's group and Xu's group used the precursors of MOF-5 and MOF-Ni, respectively, to synthesize mesoporous carbon.52,53 Subsequently, these mesoporous carbons were applied as the selenium host. The resulting selenium–mesoporous carbon composites showed enhanced electrochemical performance compared to that of the pure selenium cathode.

Mesoporous carbon spheres with high surface areas and suitable pore sizes have been used as promising Se matrices.54,55 Wang and co-workers infused Se into mesoporous carbon at a temperature of 600 °C under vacuum.55 An amazing cycling performance was obtained whereby the Se8/mesoporous carbon composite delivered a reversible capacity of 480 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles without any capacity loss. Long and co-workers used a spray drying-assisted hard template method to synthesize a series of mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs) with tunable pore size.54 Among the series, the MCMs with pore size of 3.8 nm could accommodate 50 wt% of selenium. The composite cathode delivered an initial capacity of 513 mA h g−1 and capacity retention of 300 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C (1C = 675 mA g−1).
Hierarchical porous carbon combines the advantages of microporous, mesoporous and macroporous carbon materials, and it can further improve the electrochemical performance of Li–Se batteries. In 2014, Guo's group reported a micro–mesoporous carbon sphere (MPCs) as the selenium host.56 With the unusual chain-like Sex molecules hosted in a MPCS substrate, the Se/MPCS nanocomposite delivered a high reversible capacity of 430 mA h g−1 at 0.25C after 500 cycles. In the same year, Zhang and co-workers reported a 3D interconnected hierarchical porous carbon aerogel (HPCA) as a selenium host.57 The high conductivity of HPCA prompts fast transport of electrons and Li+ ions, and the hierarchical porous structure could encapsulate Se, absorb polyselenides, and suppress the shuttle effect during the charge/discharge process. All of these advantages ensured the high performance of the HPCA/Se cathode, giving a reversible capacity of 301 mA h g−1 at 5C. Subsequently, they reported another bimodal porous (micropores and mesopores) carbon that was synthesized from glucose and employed as a selenium host.58
Xu et al.59 successfully employed Zn/Ni-MOF2 microcubes as the precursor to synthesize hierarchically porous carbon microcubes (CMC), as shown in Fig. 5a. Selenium nanoparticles could be uniformly dispersed in the hierarchical porous structure of the CMCs via a facile melt-diffusion process, as shown in Fig. 5b–f. The Se/CMCs composite with 50 wt% selenium delivered an ultra-high initial discharge specific capacity of 780.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2C.

Biomass and small organic molecules are good precursors for preparing hierarchical porous carbon. For example, Xu's group applied sunflowers and silk cocoons to synthesize two different hierarchically porous carbons.60,61 Both of them exhibited ultra-high specific surface areas and encapsulated high selenium loading. Zhao and co-workers developed a hierarchically porous carbon by carbonization of potassium tartrate.62 The obtained porous carbon–Se cathode retained a discharge capacity of 485.3 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 1.2C. Moreover, animal bone,63 pomelo,64 alkaline lignin,65 chitosan,61 and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid66 derived hierarchical porous carbons have also been employed as selenium hosts for Li–Se batteries.
Recently, Mitlin's group reported a nano-cellulose-derived micro-mesoporous monolithic carbon (NCMC) as a selenium host.67 Such a selenium-NCMC composite with 70 wt% selenium loading could serve as a freestanding cathode for Li–Se batteries. This freestanding electrode exhibited a reversible capacity of 1028 mA h cm−3 and 82% retention over 300 cycles at 0.2C, corresponding to an excellent volumetric energy density of 1727 W h L−1.
To briefly summarize, pores with smaller size (micropore, mesopore) in porous carbon can act as containers for Se particles, thus leading to stable cycling performance of Li–Se batteries. Pores with larger size (mesopore, macropore) in porous carbon can act as channels for the electrolytes infiltration.


2.2.2. Hollow carbon–selenium cathode. 
Hollow carbon nanostructures can load more selenium compared with porous carbon, carbon nanotubes/nanofibers and nanosheets.37 Owing to their unique hollow structure, on the one hand they can provide enough buffer volume for the Se cathode during the charge/discharge process; on the other hand they intensively restrict the dissolution of polyselenides.
Hollow carbon spheres are the most widely used hollow structures for selenium encapsulation.68–73 Kang and Hong synthesized hollow carbon microspheres as the selenium host by SnO2 leaching, as shown in Fig. 6a.68 The selenium content in the C–Se microspheres reached 59.5 wt% and the C–Se microsphere composite showed an outstanding cycling stability (525 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1), as shown in Fig. 6b.

Xu and co-workers developed MOF-derived hollow hierarchical porous carbon spheres (MHPCS) as the selenium host, as shown in Fig. 6c.69 The resulting MHPCS/Se composite also demonstrated an outstanding cycling stability over 500 cycles with a decay rate of only 0.08% per cycle.
Additionally, Qian's group developed interconnected porous hollow carbon bubbles (PCHBs).74 With their hollow inner cavity, they can effectively encapsulate selenium. The Se-PHCBs with 50 wt% selenium loading showed the best electrochemical performance compared to those with 40 wt% and 60 wt% selenium loading, which is because a moderate selenium loading and an appropriate residual pore volume provide a transport pathway for Li+ ions as well as effectively mitigating structural degradation. Huo's group reported a novel hollow carbon structure: hollow-core nitrogen-doped carbon nanobelts (CNx).75 With a high selenium loading (3.0 mg cm−2), the freestanding and binder-free Se@CNx cathode illustrated a high initial capacity of 608.8 mA h g−1 at a density of 1C and a reversible capacity of 453.2 mA h g−1 over 400 cycles.


2.2.3. One-dimensional carbon–selenium cathode. 
One-dimensional carbons are extremely attractive since this special one-dimensional character can not only accommodate volume expansion without pulverization, but can also facilitate axial charge transport and short radial Li-ion diffusion distances.41 As early as 2012, Amine and co-workers investigated Li insertion mechanisms by using a carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-Se electrode.51 Unlike the widely studied Li–S system, the Se-based electrode can be cycled to a high voltage of 4.6 V without failure. Such a high cut-off voltage offered greater volumetric energy densities than S-based electrodes. Since then, various CNT-Se composites have been employed as the cathode materials for Li–Se batteries.45,76–78 In addition, Kalaiselvi and Balakumar reported a novel one-dimensional carbon framework (TTC) by encapsulating multi-walled CNT in highly porous carbon, as shown in Fig. 7a.79 Zhang et al. reported a one-dimensional selenium/carbon-rich core–shell nanostructures by using the Se nanowires as the template and ascorbic acid as the carbon source (Fig. 7b).80 Goodenough's group reported a coaxial cable-like structure, which constituted by a CNT core and a shell of pyrolytic microporous carbon, as shown in Fig. 7c.81 The selenium was confined as single-chain molecules in carbon with micropores and underwent a reversible one-step reaction with Li during charge/discharge.81

As another typical one-dimensional nano-carbon material, carbon nanofibers have also been investigated.82–85 Yu and co-workers reported a flexible porous carbon nanofiber–selenium cathode (Se@PCNFs), as shown in Fig. 8a and b.83 The resulting Se@PCNFs with 52.3 wt% selenium loading delivered a reversible capacity of 516 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles without any capacity loss at 0.5 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 8c. This was because the original textural properties in terms of morphology, size and structural integrity were well retained, as shown in Fig. 8d. Following that, they used the same methods (electrospinning and then carbonization) to synthesize a CNFs-CNT nanostructure as the selenium host.85 The Se@CNFs-CNT electrodes also exhibited excellent cycling stability.

Recently, Kang et al.86 reported bimodal porous carbon nanofibers as an efficient selenium host for Li–Se batteries. By carbonization of a zeolitic imidazole framework-8/polyacrylonitrile (ZIF-8/PAN) nanofibers and further KOH activation, mesoporous and microporous carbon nanofibers (M-CNF) were obtained. Owing to the unique porous structures in the carbon nanofibers, the M-CNF/Se presented a high discharge capacity (568 mA g−1) even at an extremely high current density of 10C.


2.2.4. Two-dimensional carbon–selenium cathode. 
Graphene, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are typical two-dimensional conductive carbon materials.7,9 As excellent template materials, they can be combined with particles of group 16 (VIA) elements, such as Se, to prevent the dissolution of intermediate species (such as polyselenides), thereby resulting in the formation of a highly conductive electrical path for the active materials.87–92
Yang and co-workers recently reported the synthesis of Se-decorated graphene (Se-GE) using a high-energy ball-milling process.87 Some of the Se atoms could be chemically bonded to the carbon atoms during the ball-milling process. More importantly, they could act as reclaiming points for dissociated Se atoms through the establishment of –Se–Se–Se– chains to form a self-repairing system, as shown in Fig. 9a. The resulting Se-GE cathode delivered an initial capacity of 1050 mA h g−1 followed by a recovery to 92% of the original capacity, maintained over 500 cycles.

Zhang and co-workers used cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) to assist in the preparation of solid and hollow Se@RGO composites, as shown in Fig. 9b.89 The hollow Se@RGO composites showed better electrochemical performance than that of solid Se@RGO. The remarkable electrochemical performance was attributed to the high content of Se in the electrode, the hollow structures of selenium and the RGO coating.
Shen et al. reported a graphene oxide coating on the surface of a Se@Ni sample (GO@Se@Ni), as shown in Fig. 9c.90 The Se@Ni electrode delivered an initial capacity of 554 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 137 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles. After coating with GO, the GO@Se@Ni cathode could deliver an initial capacity of 665 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of 266 mA h g−1. The significant enhancement could be attributed to the positive effect of GO.
Moreover, combining graphene with CNTs,93–95 porous CNFs,96 and porous carbons97 to form composite nanostructures as selenium hosts has also been reported. The composite nanostructures could combine the advantages of every constituent and further enhance the electrochemical performance, e.g. Chen and co-workers encapsulated selenium into a three-dimensional graphene-CNT framework (3DG-CNT@Se), as shown in Fig. 10a.93 The resulting 3DG-CNT@Se cathode demonstrated much better electrochemical performance compared to that of the CNT@Se cathode, as shown in Fig. 10b and c.

2.2.5. Heteroatom-doped carbon–selenium cathode. 
These porous and hollow structures of carbon hosts represent one direction for the development of Se cathodes. However, polyselenide shutting is still apparent in many C/Se cathodes. Heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) doped in carbon materials can be used to further improve the electrochemical performance of Li–Se batteries.37 They can assist in forming carbon functional group–selenium bonds, which hinder polyselenide shuttling.98 Meanwhile they can enhance the conductivity of the carbon host and increase the reaction active sites, as well as the accessibility and adsorption of the electrolytes.
Nitrogen-doped porous carbon has been widely reported as a heteroatom-doped carbon for boosting the electrochemical performance of Se cathodes.45,72,73,98–105 Yin and Li reported a N-doped hierarchically porous carbon sponge (NCS) as a polyselenide immobilizer for Li–Se batteries.103 The doped nitrogen atoms improved the electrical conductivity of the carbon matrix and facilitated fast charge transfer, making the carbon sponge a highway for charges involved in redox reactions. As a result, the NCS/Se-50 composites illustrated good reversible capacity. Nallathamby et al.,72 reported nitrogen-doped carbon spheres with a hollow core and mesoporous shell (NHCS). Such NHCS could accommodate a selenium content as high as 72 wt%. The resulting Se@NHCS composite with 52 wt% Se content demonstrated outstanding rate capabilities, whereby even at 10C a capacity of 265 mA h g−1 could be achieved. Kang's group reported a composite that was constructed by anchoring N-doped hierarchically porous carbon polyhedrons on crumpled graphene balls (NPC/CGB).105 The NPC/CGB-Se cathode exhibited high discharge capacities of 998 and 462 mA h g−1 at the 1st and 1000th cycles, respectively, at a 0.5C current density.
In addition, dual heteroatom-doped porous carbon has also been used for selenium cathodes.106,107 For example, He and co-workers reported cobalt and nitrogen dual-doped porous graphitic carbon (C–Co–N) as the selenium host.106 This dual-doped porous carbon was synthesized from MOF ZIF-67, as shown in Fig. 11a. After carbonization of the ZIF-67, it still kept the morphology, as shown in Fig. 11b and c. The highly conductive C–Co–N matrix provided highly efficient channels for electron transfer and ionic diffusion, and the Co and nitrogen group in the C–Co–N matrix immobilized polyselenides through strong chemical interactions.

In addition to heteroatom-doped porous carbon, nitrogen-doped CNTs have also been employed as efficient scaffolds for selenium.45 Nitrogen-doped CNTs were prepared by carbonization of polyaniline tubes and then used to encapsulate selenium via a melt-diffusion process. The nitrogen present in the CNT can help in controlling polyselenide dissolution by creating polarity.

2.3. Polymer hosts for selenium cathodes
Conducting polymers (such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and polyacrylonitrile) have been used to assist in the encapsulation of Se and the mitigation of polyselenides in selenium or C/Se electrodes because they have functional groups (e.g., nitrogen groups, amino groups, carbonyl and carboxyl groups), unique chain structures and good electrochemical activities.37,91,108
Wen's group encapsulated selenium in hollow polypyrrole spheres.109 This cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, far better than that of a pristine selenium cathode. Qian's group used the polyaniline (PANI) to coat selenium nanowires and C/Se composites to form core–shell structures, and then the core–shell nanostructures were assembled with graphene oxide, as shown in Fig. 12a and b.110,111 Owing to the synergistic effects of PANI and graphene oxide, both the obtained composites demonstrated enhanced electrochemical performances compared to that of a pure selenium cathode.

Moreover, heterocyclic selenized polyacrylonitrile compounds have also been synthesized and employed as cathodes.108,112,113 A new electrochemical reaction mechanism suggested that nitrogen groups in the selenized polymer structure participated in the charge/discharge reactions, as shown in Fig. 11c.112 Owing to the unique reaction mechanism, the selenized PAN cathode demonstrated excellent cycling stability.
2.4. Metal compounds hosts for selenium cathode
In order to further prevent polysulfide dissolution, chemical adsorption through polar surfaces beyond heteroatom-doped carbon has widely been applied in Li–S systems.114–120 Recently, the polarity of the metal oxides and metal sulfides has been employed in Li–Se battery systems.121–125
Chen and co-workers reported a novel cathode using a Se@CoSe2-porous carbon composite (Se@CoSe2-PC).122 The CoSe2 nanoparticles were anchored on the carbon matrix, having a catalytic effect on the redox reaction dynamics of polyselenides. Because of this catalytic effect, the Se@CoSe2-PC showed a higher reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 after 100 cycle at 1C compared to that of Se@PC, as shown in Fig. 13a. Kang et al.123 synthesized graphitic carbon-TiO microspheres (GC-TiO) as the selenium host, as shown in Fig. 13b. The selenium loading in this microsphere could reach as high as 70 wt% and the corresponding reversible capacity of the GC-TiO/Se was maintained at 584 mA h g−1 after 850 cycles at a current density of 0.5C.

(b) A schematic diagram of a GC-TiO/Se composite microsphere with a high Se loading of 70 wt%. Reproduced with permission from ref. 123, Copyright 2018, the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In addition, Jung and co-workers used density functional theory calculations to verify that the group 5 and 4 disulfides had superior anchoring capabilities for polyselenides compared to those of group 6 disulfides.124 This finding provides a novel chemical insight for the further design of inorganic anchoring materials for Li–Se batteries.
2.5. SexSy cathodes and Li2Se cathodes
Generally, Se processes a stable cycling capability but a low reversible capacity while S shows a high reversible capacity but a poor cycling capability.37 As a result, utilizing the advantages of both Se and S by heteroatomization of Se and S molecules in carbon or other hosts is a promising strategy for enhancing the electrochemical performance of Se-based electrodes.126–136
Lou's group developed a novel Se-based cathode: CMK-3/SeS2@ polydopamine (CMK-3/SeS2@PDA).128 With a high area mass loading (2.6–3 mg cm−2), the CMK-3/SeS2@PDA cathode could deliver a high capacity over 1200 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and a superior rate capability of 535 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1. Such an outstanding electrochemical performance could be attributed to the advantages of SeS2 and the rationally designed host structures.128 Recently Lou's group reported a pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/SeS2 cathode that also exhibited superior performances for both lithium and sodium storage.126
Amine's group had an insight into the lithiation/de-lithiation of amorphous Se2S5 confined in micro-/meso-porous carbon (Se2S5/MPC).129 The in situ XANES results showed that the Se component was gradually decreased in ether-based electrolytes, resulting in long-chain polyselenides aggregating during charging and discharging. Ab initio calculations revealed that the binding energy of polyselenides (Li2Sex) with the carbon host is in the order of Li2Se6 > Li2Se4 > Li2Se, as shown in Fig. 14.

Furthermore, Long's group synthesized a series of SexSy composites and used MCMs as the carbon matrix to hold the SexSy composites (Fig. 15a).130 When the SexSy/MCM composites were employed as the cathode, they demonstrated different electrochemical behavior to that of a simple hybrid of Li–S and Li–Se batteries in ether-based electrolytes, which was verified by the new redox-oxidation peaks in the CV curves, as shown in Fig. 15b. Moreover, the Se/S ratio also affected the electrochemical performance of the SexSy/MCM composites, among which Se2S5/MCM delivered the best cycling performance and rate capability, as shown in Fig. 15c and d.

Additionally, Yushin's group recently reported a simple and fast route to prepare Li2Se nanoparticles, and firstly employed pure LiSe2 nanoparticles and C–Li2Se composites as the cathodes for Li–Se batteries137 because Li2Se is stable at high temperatures under an inert atmosphere and thus could be subjected to a high carbonization temperature for the formation of highly conductive C–Li2Se composites compared to the C–Se composite from the carbonizable polymer-Li2Se precursor materials. The results showed that the pure Li2Se cathode suffered severe active material loss and shuttle phenomenon, even though it had a high initial capacity. However, when embedding Li2Se nanoparticles into a conductive carbon matrix, not only was the mechanical stability of electrodes greatly enhanced, but polyselenide shuttling was also greatly hindered.
2.6. Interlayer/separator coating for selenium cathode
Since Manthiram's group first reported microporous carbon paper as a bifunctional interlayer for Li–S batteries in 2012,24 various interlayers and separator coatings have been developed to hinder the polysulfide shuttling and improve the conductivity and utilization of active materials.27,138–143
Inspired by the blocking layers in Li–S batteries, our group developed a nitrogen-doped porous carbon (N-LSCM) interlayer and a N,S-codoped graphene (N,S-G) blocking layer, as shown in Fig. 16a and c.22,144 Additionally, as shown in Fig. 16b and d, the cycling performances of Li–Se batteries with the interlayers were far higher than those without interlayers.

In addition, Zhang, et al. reported a carbon fiber interlayer for enhancing the performance of Li–Se batteries145 and Li's group reported a graphene-coated polymer separator for high-performance Li–Se batteries.146 With a graphene coating on the separator, the Li–Se batteries could maintain a high reversible capacity of approximately 400 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 1000 cycles.
2.7. Electrolytes
In a Li–Se battery, the electrolyte acts as the ion transport between the selenium cathode and the Li anode during charge/discharge. The electrochemical behaviors of Li–Se batteries vary dramatically in different electrolytes, originating from the different solubility of polysulfides in various electrolyte solvents. For example, Abouimrane et al.147 investigated the solubility of Se, Li2Se and polyselenides in carbonate electrolytes (ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)) and ether electrolytes (1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)). Their results showed that the Se and Li2Se and also polyselenides cannot dissolve in the carbonate electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 17a, while the polyselenides could easily dissolve in the ether electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 17b. Developing new electrolyte solvents to enhance the electrochemical performances of Li–Se batteries is an important alternative strategy. Zhang's group reported an ionic liquid N-methyl-(n-butyl)pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI) as the solvent for Li–Se batteries.57 This solvent significantly enhanced the rate capability of a Se/C composite cathode.

A solid-state electrolyte could be better than a liquid electrolyte in terms of reducing the dissolution and shuttling of polyselenides.148 However, the low ionic conductivity and interfacial instability associated with most solid-state electrolytes lead to more issues when they are used in Li–Se batteries. Recently, Yushin's group reported a solid electrolyte layer on a Se/C cathode surface by adding fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) to a high-concentration bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)-based ether electrolyte.149 An order of magnitude increase in cycle stability was obtained by forming the solid electrolyte protecting coating layer during the first cycle.
The electrolyte salt is also an important factor affecting the electrochemical performance. Yushin's group also investigated the effect of the LiTFSI concentration on the performance of Li–Se batteries.150 They found that a high concentration of LiTFSI in ether electrolytes is beneficial for the cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. Particularly, the 5 M and 7 M LiTFSI significantly reduced the capacity decay of the Se-carbide-derived carbon cathodes. Recently, another kind of lithium salt (lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB)) has also been utilized in Li–Se batteries.151 Using the LiDFOB/EC–DMC–FEC electrolyte, a Se/microporous carbon cathode with 51.4 wt% Se content delivered a capacity of 511 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5C, which is an amazing reversible capacity.
3. Na–Se cells
In addition to the growing research interest in Li–Se batteries, Na–Se batteries have also gained much attention recently owing to the abundance, low cost, and low environmental impact of Na.38 Unlike existing Na–S batteries that mostly operate at high temperatures, the Se cathodes are capable of cycling at room temperature against Na.51 Therefore, the electrochemistry of selenium with sodium has received attention from early studies.
Abouimrane and Amine studied sodium insertion using a selenium and selenium–sulfur (SexSy)-based cathode as early as 2012.51 As shown in Fig. 18a, the Na/Se–C cells experienced two discharge plateaus vs. only one discharge plateau for Li/Se–C cells, indicating the obtained Na2Se discharge product originated from an intermediate phase. Subsequently, Dravid and Wu et al. used in situ transmission electron microscopy to observe the sodiation in a selenium nanotube.152 The sodiation went through the following steps according to their studies: from single crystal to an amorphous phase of Na0.5Se, then was transformed to polycrystalline Na2Se2 phase, before finally forming the Na2Se. Such a phenomenon proved the former conclusion of Abouimrane and Amine, whereby the Na2Se discharge product is transformed from an intermediate phase.

In order to improve the cycling stability and rate capability of Se cathodes, advanced Se/C composites are not only widely used in Li–Se cells but also extensively applied in Na–Se cells.55,67,83,85,153–158 Compared to Li–S and Na–S batteries, the volumetric energy and power density of Na–Se batteries are inferior. Designing a flexible, freestanding and binder-free Se-based electrode for enhancing the volumetric energy and power density would be ideal. Yu's group has done a lot of work on flexible one-dimensional carbon–selenium composite nanofibers as the cathode for Li–Se batteries,83,85,153 Manthiram's group reported a freestanding CNF–Se electrode, and Rogach's group reported carbon-coated Se nanowires (shown in Fig. 18b and c) used in Na–Se batteries.154,156 In addition, Se@porous carbon (shown in Fig. 18d),55,155,158 Se-carbon nanosheets (shown in Fig. 18e),157 and Se@monolithic carbon (shown in Fig. 18f)67 have also been employed as cathodes in Na–Se batteries.
Recently, Lin and co-workers applied the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method to synthesize an Al2O3-coated (Se/porous N-doped carbon nanofibers)@Se composite (SC@Se–Al2O3).159 This composite with a Se content of 67 wt% and a 3 nm Al2O3 thickness maintained a reversible capacity of 503 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Accordingly, the ALD method is controllable and enables effective tuning of the electrode performance with high active material loading.
4 Other Se-based batteries
Rechargeable Mg batteries offer great potential to outperform the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries owing to their relatively large volumetric energy densities (3833 mA h cm−3 for Mg vs. 850 mA h cm−3 for a commercial graphite anode).160,161 The coupling of Se as the cathode and Mg as the anode could be an ideal combination for electrochemical energy storage.4 Karger et al. reported a new class of Mg–Se batteries based on Se and SeS2 cathodes.162 The element Se and SeS2 were incorporated in CMK-3. In the new Mg–Se system, the fundamental electrochemistry should be understood. In contrast to Mg–S batteries with two apparent voltage plateaus in their discharge profile,163 the multi-step discharge behavior in Mg–Se batteries likely trends towards a single voltage plateau, as shown in Fig. 19a. This may imply that the transformation of high-order polyselenides to low-order selenides is faster than that of the polysulfides in Mg–S batteries.

Development of Mg-compatible electrolytes comes with marvelous challenges in the areas of rechargeable Mg batteries. Recently, Cui et al. reported a new Mg-compatible electrolyte (boron-centered anion-based magnesium electrolyte, BCM) for Mg–Se batteries.161 When utilizing the BCM electrolyte, the fast-kinetics selenium/carbon (Se/C) cathode achieved an outstanding rate capability, as shown in Fig. 19b.
Owing to the abundant presence in nature, low price, chemically overactive and low redox potential compared to those for other metals (E(K+/K) = −2.93 V, E(Ca2+/Ca) = −2.87 V, E(Na+/Na) = −2.71 V, E(Mg2+/Mg) = −2.27 V vs. standard hydrogen redox potential), K anodes cannot be ignored.164
Thus Guo's group reported a new reversible and high-performance potassium–selenium (K–Se) battery system.164 They used a selenium/carbonized-PAN composite (c-PAN-Se) as the cathode, metallic K as the anode, and carbonate as the electrolyte. By confining Se in the micropores of the c-PAN, the small Se molecules can avoid the transition from Se8 to Se42− during the initial K uptake process, thereby preventing the formation of polyselenides (K2Sen, n = 4–8) upon discharging, as shown in Fig. 20a. The as-prepared K–Se battery exhibited a reversible capacity of 1904 mA h cm−3 after 100 cycles at 0.2C and a rate retention of 89% from 0.1 to 2C (Fig. 20b). More importantly, they studied the electrochemical mechanisms of Se with K+ ions via Raman spectroscopy and in situ and ex situ synchrotron XRD characterization. The results showed that the insertion of K+ ions led to the cleavage of C–Se bonds, the rearrangement of selenium atoms, and the final formation of the main product K2Se.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
Elemental Se, with better conductivity vs. S and good compatibility with carbonate-based electrolytes and metal anodes, has become a promising cathode material for electrochemical energy storage systems, particularly for EVs and portable electronics, which are highly dependent on volumetric energy density. In the last few years, considerable progress has been achieved in understanding the fundamental reaction mechanisms and designing Se-based batteries. Herein, we draw the following conclusions:
(a) Conductive porous carbon matrices and polymers are good hosts for holding the selenium. On one hand, these matrices maintain the structural integrity of the Se cathode and promote the electronic conductivity, while on the other hand they can reduce the polyselenide dissolution and hinder the shuttle phenomenon. Additionally, doped heteroatoms (e.g. N atom) and metal compounds (e.g. metal oxides) could provide stronger confinement ability for polyselenides owing to their polar surfaces.
(b) SexSy composite electrode materials can combine the merits of both selenium (better stability) and sulfur (higher capacity), showing more promise for practical applications in Se-based rechargeable batteries.
(c) Se-based cathode materials exhibit electrochemical reactivity in both carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes, but the reaction mechanisms are different when matched with different metal anodes. For instance, in Li–Se battery systems, polyselenides will be formed using the ether-based electrolytes before the full reduction of Se to Li2Se in the discharge process. In contrast, in carbonate-based electrolytes, it is believed that the element Se is directly reduced to Li2Se without producing polyselenides, while in Na–Se batteries system using the carbonate-based electrolytes, the reduction of Se to Na2Se seems to experience at least a two-step reaction, with the formation of a poorly ordered intermediate before Se is transformed to a well-defined antifluorite-type Na2Se phase.38
Even though the above conclusions provide respectable knowledge for understanding Se-based rechargeable metal batteries, many hurdles and challenges for researchers to overcome still remain in order to realize commercialization. First of all, further investigation of the reaction mechanisms in Li–Se, Na–Se, Mg–Se and K–Se batteries should be emphasised. In situ techniques can help to investigate the real redox reactions occurring in these batteries.37 Therefore, techniques such as in situ XRD, in situ TEM, and in situ Raman should be applied to study the mechanisms. Secondly, further development of rational nanostructured Se-based cathodes with high electric conductivity, low volumetric change, and high utilization of the active material is required. Thirdly, appropriate organic electrolytes and separators that are favorable for Se redox reactions and compatible with different metal anode should be developed. Furthermore, reasonable cell design (e.g. inserting a blocking layer) should also not be ignored. Fourthly, as Se is conductive and electrochemically active, it is possible to be applied in batteries for a wide temperature range and in all-solid Li–Se batteries.4 Thus, other Se-based energy storage systems and versatile applications of Se-based batteries still need further study in future research.
Finally, as is well-known, Se is more expensive than S.4,165 Therefore, reducing the cost of Se-based energy storage systems is another challenge for researchers.
Although Se-based rechargeable metal batteries are still far from practical application, the future is bright with gradual improvement in the understanding of their reaction mechanisms and cell designs.
