    , Accepted 1st November 2013First published on 1st November 2013AbstractPerovskite solar cells have garnered great attention in recent years as promising high performance next-generation solar cells with long-term stability at low cost. Since the seminal work of Miyasaka and others in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 15% over the past four years, exceeding the highest efficiency of conventional organic dye-sensitized DSSCs. Recently, the perovskite has been demonstrated to act successfully as an active layer in simple planar-heterojunction solar cells with no need of complex nanostructured DSSC architectures, leading to an attractively high PCE of 15.4% at a competitive low manufacturing cost.

1. Introduction
Global energy demand has been continually increasing with industrial development and population growth in recent decades, especially for conventional energy resources such as fossil oil, coal and natural gas. To date, over 80% of energy consumption is generated from fossil fuels, which causes the environmental pollution and global-warming issues. More importantly, fossil fuels are non-renewable energy and will eventually be exhausted in the future. In this context, solar cells that convert solar energy into electrical energy possess cost-effective, reliable and safe attributes and present as one of promising renewable alternatives to fossil fuels.1–8 Since the first practical solar cell was fabricated from a silicon p–n junction, silicon solar cells are currently leading the commercial photovoltaics markets with 80% share. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of silicon solar cells is nearly 28%.9 A very high purity (e.g., ≥99.9999%) is often required for solar-grade silicon as the charge generation and transport in silicon is very sensitive to defects.10 In addition, due to a large energy difference between the direct gap (∼3.4 eV) and indirect gap (∼1.1 eV) of silicon,11 the active layer of silicon solar cells must be thick enough (e.g., typically 300 μm) to efficiently absorb incident sunlight. This makes silicon solar cells expensive. To this end, thin-film solar cells composed of inorganic semiconductors with a direct bandgap are then explored,12 including cadmium telluride (CdTe),13 copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS),14 and copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS).15 The highest efficiency of 37.5% has been reported for InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs multijunction thin-film solar cells.9 However, the manufacturing of inorganic thin-film solar cells usually involves costly, high temperature and high vacuum vapor deposition. Moreover, most of the thin-film solar cells to date contain elements that are toxic and of low abundance in the Earth, thereby limiting their mass production and widespread applications.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable interest since the first report in 1991 by Grätzel and his coworkers,16 due primarily to their excellent photovoltaic performance at a relatively low fabrication cost.17 Unlike the classic solid-state junction device, the charge generation and transfer are separately processed in dyes and semiconductors in DSSCs, thereby forming a photochemical solar cell.18 Notably, DSSCs can be assembled under normal pressure and temperature, which reduces the fabrication cost. Typically, a DSSC consists of a wide band-gap semiconductor as a photoanode (e.g., TiO2 with a bandgap, Eg, of 3.2 eV) for transferring and collecting electrons, a dye as a sensitizer (e.g., ruthenium-based complex, N719) for absorbing solar photons, a liquid redox electrolyte (e.g., iodide/triiodide couple) for deoxidizing oxidized dyes, and a platinum counter electrode for reproducing oxidized ions in the redox electrolyte (e.g., iodide ion).19–22 A PCE over 12% has been achieved using a porphyrin-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 photoanode and a cobalt redox electrolyte,10 wherein the electrons generated from photoexcited dyes are injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 photoanode, while the concomitant holes are transferred through the redox electrolyte to the counter electrode. For conventional DSSCs using liquid electrolytes, the energy loss of solar-to-electricity conversion is largely related to the electron transfer from the sensitizer to the TiO2 photoanode and the dye regeneration from the electrolyte.23 The strategies to reduce the energy loss include: (1) rational design of dye molecules with their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) matching the quasi Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode, (2) optimization of the TiO2 photoanode with nanostructured architectures for enhanced dye loading and electron transport, (3) exploitation of redox electrolytes with effective components for hole transport.21,24–26
Although the stability of DSSCs has been extensively evaluated in the lab, the long-term durability of semi-commercial DSSC products is still not very satisfactory, due mostly to the degradation of organic dyes and the leakage of liquid electrolytes after a long-time illumination.27–29 To avoid the leakage of liquid electrolytes, increase the lifetime of devices, and reduce the manufacturing cost by dispensing with the need for device sealing, recent efforts have concentrated on the replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes.30–32 Amorphous organic hole-transport material (HTM), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), was initially introduced to substitute the iodide/triiodide liquid electrolyte, yet resulting in a low PCE of 1%,33 which was attributed to the short diffusion length of charge carriers and the incomplete pore filling of mesoporous TiO2 films. Recent advances in the synthesis of new dyes with enhanced extinction coefficients render the increase of PCE of spiro-OMeTAD-based DSSCs to nearly 6.1%.34
Due to their excellent electrical conductivity, conjugated polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), polyaniline, and polypyrrole have also been explored as potential alternatives to liquid electrolytes.35,36 Unfortunately, the device performance of conjugated polymer electrolyte-based DSSCs is also limited owing to the poor filling of electrolytes within the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode. A champion PCE of 3.8% was achieved in P3HT electrolyte-based DSSCs using organic dyes as sensitizers.37 Interestingly, the efficiency of P3HT electrolyte-based DSSCs was then increased to over 5% by implementing inorganic Sb2S3 nanocrystals as sensitizers.38 Compared to organic dyes, inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals offer expanded flexibility for serving as high-efficiency sensitizers, benefiting from their tunable optical properties,8 high extinction coefficients,39 and large intrinsic dipole moments.40 Nevertheless, inorganic nanocrystal sensitizers still suffer from the relatively poor infiltration within mesoporous TiO2 films, low charge carrier mobility, and fast carrier recombination,41 and thus low device performance of DSSCs.
The breakthrough discovery of organometal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 (X = halogen) as high-efficiency light sensitizers in photoelectrochemical cells shed new light on developing low cost, high performance next generation solar cells.42 Perovskite is named after Russian mineralogist Perovskite who first characterized the crystal structure of ABX3-type (X = halogen, oxygen; e.g., CaTiO3) inorganics.42–44 In CH3NH3PbX3 nanocrystals, Pb2+ cations adopt the octahedral coordination of X− anions together with the cuboctahedral coordination of CH3NH3+ anions (Fig. 1a).45 The electronic activities of CH3NH3PbX3 nanocrystals are highly correlated with their crystalline structures. For example, the band gap of CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) can be gradually tuned from ∼1.2 eV to ∼2.3 eV by adjusting the component ratio of Br− anions (Fig. 1b), accompanied by the crystal structure transformation from the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 to the cubic structure of CH3NH3PbBr3 as the smaller Br− ion radius is relatively favorable for the formation of the cubic structure (Fig. 1c).46 Similarly, the optical absorption of CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) can be readily adjusted to cover almost the whole visible spectrum as shown in Fig. 1d.46

In pioneering work, CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles were exploited as the light sensitizer for use in iodide/triiodide liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs, exhibiting a low PCE of 3.1% yet an attractively high open circuit voltage, Voc, of 0.96 V.47 Since then, the photovoltaic efficiency of CH3NH3PbX3-based perovskite solar cells has been rapidly increased,48 which can be ascribed to the effective integration of advantageous attributes of CH3NH3PbX3 nanocrystals (i.e., direct band gap, high absorption and high carrier mobility) with the innovation of device architectures.49 Compared to the complex chemistry of organic dyes, perovskite sensitizers can be readily synthesized through intrinsic ionic interaction of perovskite precursors (e.g., CH3NH3I and PbI2).46 The relatively low-lying valence band of perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 renders high Voc exceeding 1 V in DSSCs.50 In addition, perovskite materials exhibit high absorption coefficient, large charge carrier mobility, and enhanced stability, which are expected to effectively promote photovoltaic efficiency, avoid liquid-electrolyte leakage, and improve device durability of DSSCs. In this Feature Article, we summarize the recent incredible achievements in perovskite solar cells, highlight the strategies of implementing solid-state HTMs, modified TiO2 nanostructures and new device architectures to promote the photovoltaic performance, and provide an outlook on the future development of high efficiency perovskite solar cells.
2. Perovskite-sensitized solar cells
2.1 Solid-state HTMs as electrolytes
Perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals were initially used to enhance the light absorption of DSSCs employing liquid electrolytes, resulting in a highest PCE of 3.8% with a maximum IPCE of 45% in the wavelength region between 400 nm and 600 nm.47 The PCE of CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized DSSCs was then increased to 6.2% by the utilization of CH3NH3PbI3 quantum dots (QDs), in which perovskite QDs were directly prepared from their precursor solution consisting of a mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone, followed by the deposition on the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode.51 The electron diffusion coefficient of the perovskite QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was higher than that of the organic dye N719-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, suggesting that more photo-injected electrons can be generated in perovskite QD-sensitized DSSCs.52 On the other hand, it was found that CH3NH3PbI3 QDs could hardly cover the entire surface of the TiO2 photoanode, and the exposure of the partial photoanode surface to the liquid electrolyte led to an increased electron recombination.51 Such an electron recombination was reduced by modifying the TiO2 surface with Pb(NO3)2 prior to the deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 QDs, resulting in a slight increase in PCE (from 6.2% to 6.5%) with a maximum EQE of 78.6% at the wavelength of 530 nm.51
Although the PCE of perovskite QD-sensitized DSSCs reached over 6%, the Voc was still comparable with that of conventional organic dye-sensitized DSSCs in the range of 0.6–0.8 V. The Voc of DSSCs is mainly determined by the difference between the quasi Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte.53,54 In comparison to the conventional iodide/triiodide liquid electrolyte, solid-state HTMs were shown to increase the Voc of as-prepared DSSCs due to their high redox potential.10,55 In addition to the increased Voc, the replacement of the liquid electrolyte with solid-state HTMs is also expected to improve the stability of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized DSSCs as CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals were found to degrade in liquid electrolytes.56
The solid-state HTM spiro-MeOTAD has been widely recognized as an attractive alternative to the conventional iodide/triiodide liquid electrolyte in DSSCs. This is due to the redox potential of spiro-MeOTAD fits better with organic dyes, resulting in a remarkably high Voc of 1.02 V.57 The unexpected low PCEs of spiro-MeOTAD-based DSSCs using organic dyes as sensitizers can be attributed to the incomplete pore filling of dye-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 films with solid-state HTMs, which heavily limits the applicable thickness of TiO2 films, and in turn the amount of dye loading and the light-harvesting efficiency, and ultimately the device performance.58,59 However, for perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized DSSCs, a thin perovskite–TiO2 film can readily harvest enough photons to generate a high short-circuit photocurrent density, Jsc, which can be attributed to the particularly high absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals. In this context, the highest PCE of CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized DSSCs was strikingly increased from 6.5% to 9.7% by employing spiro-MeOTAD HTM instead of liquid electrolytes (Fig. 2), in which the thickness of the TiO2 photoanode (i.e., 0.6 μm) was much thinner than that in previous work.56

It is noteworthy that the photovoltaic performance of CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized DSSCs can be significantly promoted by sequential deposition of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals on mesoporous TiO2 films, which leads to a high loading and coverage of perovskite nanocrystals on the TiO2 photoanode surface. The mesoporous TiO2 films were initially infiltrated in a high concentration of PbI2/N,N-dimethylformamide solution to achieve a high loading of PbI2 nanocrystals within mesoporous TiO2 films (Fig. 3a), followed by the immersion of TiO2/PbI2 films in CH3NH3I/2-propanol solution to form densely packed CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals on TiO2 films (Fig. 3b).60 The confinement of PbI2 nanocrystals within mesoporous TiO2 films resulted in a layered PbI2 crystalline structure, which is expected to greatly facilitate the insertion of CH3NH3I precursors to yield CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals.61,62 The highest PCE of the as-prepared DSSCs up to 15% with a long-term stability of maintaining 80% of the initial PCE after 500 h (Fig. 3c) was obtained,60 which is the known best performance DSSC.

2.2 TiO2 nanostructures as the photoanode
As described above, mesoporous TiO2 films composed of randomly dispersed TiO2 nanoparticle networks are extensively employed as the photoanode in both liquid-electrolyte- and solid-state-based DSSCs because of their excellent physicochemical properties such as appropriate electronic band structure, chemical stability, photostability, non-toxicity, and low cost, in conjunction with the large surface area provided by the mesoporous network structure for sufficient dye loading.63,64 To date, the highest PCEs of 10.2% and 15% have been achieved in the TiO2/N719/perovskite CsSnI3 and TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD DSSCs, respectively.60,65 However, the device performance of DSSCs is limited by the electron trapping and scattering at the grain boundary of the TiO2 nanoparticle network. In comparison to the high charge recombination loss in mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle films, vertically aligned one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes, have been demonstrated to provide a better pathway along the long axis of 1D nanostructures for electron transport, thereby imparting longer electron lifetime, reducing charge recombination at grain boundary, and enhancing the device efficiency of conventional liquid-electrolyte-based DSSCs.22,24,63
1D oriented TiO2 nanowire arrays can be directly seeded and grown on FTO electrodes by the hydrothermal reaction, in which the lattice mismatch between the FTO substrate and rutile TiO2 acts as the major driving force for the nucleation and growth of rutile TiO2 nanorods.66 A highest PCE of 4.87% was obtained when depositing perovskite CH3NH3PbI2Br nanocrystals on the TiO2 nanowire arrays with the nanowire diameter of 50–150 nm and the array thickness of ∼1.5 μm.67 The relatively low PCE was correlated with the previous work using mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal films, signifying that an optimized thickness for the TiO2 photoanode would be less than 1 μm for perovskite-sensitized DSSCs, considering that the TiO2 photoanode needs to be thick enough to adsorb more dyes yet be thin enough to facilitate the charge carrier transport.56
The thickness effect of the nanostructured TiO2 photoanode on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized DSSCs was studied by exploiting oriented TiO2 nanorod arrays as the photoanode. The rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays with the thicknesses of ∼0.56 μm, ∼0.92 μm, and ∼1.58 μm were uniformly grown on FTO electrodes (Fig. 4a–c), respectively.68 The decreases of Jsc and IPCE were observed with the increased TiO2 thicknesses, which was related to the increased tilting angles for longer nanorods, corresponding to the reduced pore filling fraction of perovskite sensitizers and thus low light-harvesting efficiencies (Fig. 4d and e).68 Thus, the highest PCE of 9.4% was obtained with the smallest thickness of ∼0.56 μm. It is worth noting that the TiO2 nanorod surface was incompletely covered with the perovskite nanoparticles (Fig. 4f).68 Further efforts to increase the surface area for dye adsorption within the 1D nanostructured TiO2 and reduce the shunt current are required in the future research.

3. Planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells
Quite intriguingly, the PCE of perovskite CH3NH3PbI2Cl-sensitized DSSCs unexpectedly reached 10.9% with a high Voc of 0.98 V by replacing the conventional mesoporous TiO2 film with the mesoporous Al2O3 film.23 Considering the insulating nature of Al2O3, the photo-generated electrons in Al2O3-based devices must be confined within the perovskite CH3NH3PbI2Cl phase before they are collected by the bottom FTO electrode,69 indicating that the electrons are able to transport through the CH3NH3PbI2Cl phase without significant charge recombination (Fig. 5).23 In fact, a higher electron diffusion rate was found in the CH3NH3PbI2Cl phase than that in mesoporous TiO2 films, revealing that the perovskite CH3NH3PbI2Cl possesses an ambipolar transport property.23 The confinement of photo-generated electrons within the perovskite CH3NH3PbI2Cl phase is believed to play a crucial role in enhancing the Voc to 0.98 V via increasing the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes within the CH3NH3PbI2Cl phase, as the Voc is determined by the difference of the quasi-Fermi levels within the absorber layer.70 The device efficiency was further improved to 12.3% by optimizing the film thickness of the Al2O3 layer,71 strongly suggesting that the perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 (X = halogen) actually serves as not only a light sensitizer but also a semiconducting active layer, in which the photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently transported to the top and bottom electrodes, respectively, through the CH3NH3PbX3 (X = halogen) phase.

The corresponding representation of the energy landscape is shown below in which electrons and holes are shown as solid circles and open circles, respectively.23 Adapted with permission from ref. 23, Copyright© 2012 American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Similar evidence of the semiconducting diode properties of perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 was somewhat observed in exploring their use as light sensitizers in DSSCs.23,67 Although the solid-state Au/CH3NH3PbX3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell exhibited a very low PCE of 5.5%, its maximum IPCE can reach as high as 90% in the visible light range, corresponding to a high Jsc of 16.1 mA cm−2.49 This signified that the perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 could probably work as the photovoltaic active layer in the architecture of planar heterojunction solar cells. The relatively low Voc, FF, and thus PCE of the perovskite-based planar heterojunction solar cells may be increased by optimizing the film morphology of the perovskite active layer to achieve a pinhole-free layer, avoid short circuit, and increase shunt resistance.70
Quite recently, Snaith and his coworkers demonstrated that high performance perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 (X = halogen) solar cells can indeed be fabricated in a simple planar heterojunction architecture instead of complex nanostructured DSSCs. They also scrutinized the effects of the perovskite film morphology on the device performance. The planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells were fabricated in a configuration of FTO/compact TiO2/CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)/spiro-MeOTAD/Au,72 wherein FTO is the transparent bottom electrode, compact TiO2 is the hole-blocking layer, CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 is the active layer, spiro-MeOTAD is the electron-blocking layer, and Au is the top electrode. The device performance was found to depend heavily on the coverage of CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 on the compact TiO2 layer (Fig. 6),72 in which a high CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 coverage was usually preferred for high Jsc and PCE. This is because the insufficient coverage would form shunt paths between the top and bottom electrodes, resulting in the decreased Voc and FF. In the solution-processed fabrication, a high coverage was achieved by optimizing the film thickness, thermal annealing temperature, and thermal annealing time of the perovskite films,72 yielding a high PCE of 11.4%.

The development of an effective film deposition technique and an interface engineering procedure is of great importance for thin-film solar cells, as it facilitates the reduction of the loss of light absorption, the decrease of shunt paths, and the minimization of the interface-defect density in planar heterojunction solar cells.70 To this end, the vapour deposition was employed to coat a perovskite CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 film on a compact TiO2 layer, forming a superior uniform layer of CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 films as compared to the incomplete coverage of CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 platelets prepared by the solution-processed method (Fig. 7a and b).73 In an optimized device with the vapour-deposited CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 as an active layer, the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells yielded an extremely high Jsc of 21.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.07 V, FF of 0.67, and PCE of 15.4% (Fig. 7c and d),73 which exceeded the highest PCEs of conventional liquid-electrolytes and perovskite-sensitized DSSCs.10,60 Clearly, the judicious integration of the unique photovoltaic performance of perovskite materials, the simple planar heterojunction architecture, and the vapour deposition make the exploration of perovskite solar cells stand out as the promising and bright direction for achieving high performance next generation solar cells at competitively low cost.

4. Conclusions and outlook
The past few years have witnessed unprecedented rapid progress in the development of perovskite solar cells.47 Two research groups, Grätzel and Snaith, have made impressive contributions to increasing the photovoltaic performance and innovating the device architecture of perovskite solar cells. Perovskite nanocrystals were initially used as high-efficiency light sensitizers in iodide/triiodide liquid-electrolyte-based DSSCs due to their direct semiconducting nature, high light absorption, and fast carrier mobility,47 yet the PCEs of which were lower than those organic dye-sensitized DSSCs. The replacement of the iodide/triiodide liquid electrolyte with the solid-state spiro-MeOTAD HTM profoundly increased the PCEs of perovskite-sensitized DSSCs from ∼6% up to 10% with enhanced device stability.56 Remarkably, the PCEs have been recently promoted to ∼15% by increasing the loading concentration of perovskite sensitizers within mesoporous TiO2 films via the sequential deposition of perovskite nanocrystals,60 representing to date the highest PCE for DSSCs.
The success of employing perovskite materials in DSSCs invokes great interest in exploring their working mechanism. Intriguingly, more evidence has revealed that the perovskite can not only act as a high efficiency light absorber but also possess excellent charge carrier mobility.71,72 The perovskite has unique ambipolar properties to transport both photogenerated holes and electrons. In this context, a simple planar heterojunction configuration composed of FTO/compact TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au was successfully employed to fabricate perovskite solar cells, dispensing with the need for complex DSSC architectures.73 The PCEs of the as-prepared perovskite solar cells exceeded 15%, making it stand out as an unambiguously attractive route to low cost and high performance next generation solar cells.
Despite the exciting high efficiency over 15% in the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells, the performance of perovskite solar cells is envisioned to further improve up to 20% by optimizing the planar heterojunction device configuration.42 For the Jsc, the thickness of the perovskite active layer must be thick enough to absorb sufficient incident light, while at the same time a thick film is not favorable for the charge carrier diffusion.70 The optimization of the film morphology of the active layer, in particular the film thickness, roughness, and coverage, has been proved to be of key importance in producing high performance perovskite solar cells. In addition, the implementation of antireflection or plasmonic technologies may also improve the efficiency of light harvesting, the Jsc, and thus the device performance. The interfacial layer between the perovskite active layer and the bottom (or top) electrode also needs to be rationally engineered, in which the interfacial defect density should be minimized and the energy levels need to be closely aligned in order to achieve high Voc and FF.
Given the relatively short period of time in developing perovskite solar cells, the fundamental working mechanisms of perovskite in either DSSCs or planar heterojunction solar cells are still not well understood. Further elucidation on photophysical properties of perovskite materials will be highly beneficial to improving device performance of perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the most widely studied perovskite material for solar cells at present is CH3NH3PbX3. It may be highly desirable to replace the toxic Pb cations with other environmentally friendly elements. The water-soluble property of CH3NH3PbX3 is preferred for the chemical synthesis but not for the device stability.74 Clearly, all these issues described above should be centered on the exploration of perovskite materials for low cost, high efficiency perovskite solar cells. Nonetheless, with recent progress being made in chemical synthesis, device engineering, film deposition, and theoretical modeling, the field of perovskite solar cells should have a bright, rapidly evolving and practical future.
