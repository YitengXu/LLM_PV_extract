    AbstractA unique nanochain-structured mesoporous tungsten carbide (m-NCTC) was synthesized through a simple combined hydrothermal reaction–post heat-treatment approach. When loaded with Pt, the nanostructure (Pt/m-NCTC), as a catalyst, demonstrates high unit mass electroactivity (323 A (g Pt)−1) and high resistance to CO poisoning for methanol oxidation, and is much superior to Pt/C, one of the known excellent electrocatalysts. Its high reaction activity and strong poison-resistivity is very likely due to the unique mesoporous nanochain structure and high specific surface area (113 m2 g−1). This work provides a universal and economic method to synthesize novel mesoporous structured materials and provides scientific insight of mesoporous structured electrocatalysis, thus leading to various important applications as a catalyst in fuel cells, solar cells, sensors and in organic synthesis reactions.
1. Introduction
Tungsten carbides (WCs) are important industrial materials used to fabricate tools in mining and machining due to their high melting point, hardness, thermal conductivity, compressive strength, and resistance to fracture, wearing, oxidation, and corrosion.1 More recently, WCs have attracted much attention because of their catalytic activity is similar to that of platinum group metals,2 while possessing desirable stability in both acidic and alkaline solutions3 and high tolerance towards both CO and bisulfide poisons.4 They have been adopted as catalysts for various chemical and electrochemical reactions, such as methanol oxidation,5 oxygen reduction,6 nitrophenol oxidation,7 and hydrogen evolution.8
Generally, WCs are produced by direct carburization of tungsten or tungsten oxide powders through firing at elevated temperatures (ca. 1000–1500 °C),9 and have a low specific surface area and large particle size. It is a great challenge to increase the specific surface area of WCs for significant improvement of their catalytic performance.10 A unique nanostructure could result in various superior physical and chemical properties including a high specific surface area. However, synthesis of a nanostructured WC with a high surface area stumbles upon a great barricade caused by the rigorous solid-state reaction conditions and high formation temperature. Very recently, a few approaches such as mechanochemical synthesis,11 spray conversion,12 and chemical vapor phase reactions13 were developed to synthesize micro- and nano-structured WCs. In this work, a unique nanochain-structured mesoporous WC (denotes as m-NCTC) was synthesized by a novel and simple method to achieve a high specific surface area. This new approach combines a surfactant-assisted hydrothermal reaction and a thermal treatment in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a bi-functional agent for both structure-directing and pore-forming to produce the unique nanostructure.
2. Experimental
In a typical synthetic procedure of m-NCTC, 4.0 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved in 20 mL distilled–deionized water and was vigorously stirred for 20 min. It was then mixed with a 20 mL aqueous solution containing glucose and ammonium metatungstate (AMT) with different molar ratios. The mixture was hydrothermally treated in a sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h to form m-NCTC precursors. The as-prepared precursors were calcined at 900 °C under a flow of H2/N2 (VH2/VN2 = 1:3, 50 mL min−1) for certain times ranging from 60 min to 240 min to finally form m-NCTC.
Pt/m-NCTC and Pt/C catalysts were synthesized by using an intermittent microwave assisted polyol method as previously reportedS1,S2. In brief, an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) was well mixed with ethylene glycol (EG) in a beaker, and then 100.0 mg of m-NCTC or carbon power (Cabot Co., USA) were added into the mixture. After the pH of the mixture was adjusted to over 10 using 1.0 mol L−1 NaOH/EG, a well-dispersed slurry was obtained after being stirred in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Thereafter, the slurry was microwave-heated in a way of 10 s on and 10 s off several times. The resulting black solid sample was filtered, washed and dried at 80 °C for 10 h in a vacuum oven.
The structural analysis of the samples was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a D/Max-IIIA (Rigaku Co., Japan) X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source. The size and morphology were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL JEM-2010 (HR) microscope and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a LEO-1530VP (Germany) microscope. In order to analyze and compare the surface chemical states of the samples, XPS was carried out on an ESCALab250 (Thermo, USA). The composition of the samples were determined by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the m-NCTC was measured by an automatic volumetric sorption analyzer (Quantachrome, Nova1200).
All electrochemical measurements were conducted on an IM6e-X electrochemical workstation (Zahner-Electrik, Germany) in a three-electrode cell at room temperature. A Pt foil (3.0 cm2) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was prepared on a glass carbon (GC) disk as the substrate. Typically, a mixture containing 10.0 mg catalyst, 10.0 mL ethanol and 40 µL Nafion solution (5 wt %, DuPont, USA) was ultrasonicated for 15 min to obtain a well-dispersed ink. A certain amount of catalyst ink was then transferred onto the surface of the GC electrode and the solvent was slowly evaporated to obtain a catalyst thin film. In order to have valid comparison of electrocatalytic behaviors between Pt/m-NCTC and Pt/C, the amount of catalytic ink and preparation procedure applied in the electrode fabrication were well controlled to produce identical coating thickness and Pt loadings. The Pt loadings on the electrode were controlled at 10 µg cm−2. The aqueous solutions of 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 or 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 + 1 mol L−1 CH3OH were used as electrolyte. For CO-stripping tests, the electrode potential was held at −0.15 V (vs. SCE) in CO-saturated 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution for 15 min first. N2 was bubbled into the solution for 30 min to remove dissolved CO in the solution while holding the potential at −0.15 V (vs. SCE). The CO-stripping was performed by cycling the potential from −0.15 V to 1.0 V (vs. SCE) at a scan rate of 15 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
The typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared m-NCTC sample in Fig. 1 show that the structure and composition of the product relies on the synthetic conditions. With increasing the molar ratio of ammonium metatungstate (AMT) to glucose, a phase transition from W to WC is observed (Fig. 1a). At a constant molar ratio of AMT to glucose and temperature, the reaction time plays an important role. With a molar ratio of 0.039 at a reaction temperature of 900 °C, the formation of WC undergoes the transition from W to W2C, and finally converting to WC as the main phase with a long reaction time (Fig. 1b). Based on these results, the optimal molar ratio of 0.039 and the reaction time of 180 min at 900 °C were determined and were used to prepare WC for further characterization and measurements. Tungsten oxides in prepared WC were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†), however it could not be detected although it could be formed through surface oxidation of WC. This can be very likely ascribed to an extremely thin oxide film formed beyond the XPS sensitivity.

The m-NCTC synthesized at the optimized conditions shows an interesting mesoporous nanochain-structure (lengths over ∼200 nm to 2 µm and diameters from 50 to 100 nm, Fig. 2) with nanopore openings through the whole length (Fig. 2b). The HRTEM image displays an interplanar distance of 2.52 Å for the WC single crystals, corresponding to its hexagonal (100) facet. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED, inset in Fig. 2c) indicates that the m-NCTC has a single crystalline structure in terms of its uniform central and ordered diffraction spots array. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement indicates that the WC nanochains are composed of tungsten and carbon in the form of W0.9C (Fig. 2d). It is worthy to note that the ratio of W to C is only an estimation, since EDS is often hindered by formation of the adventitious carbons. Although the formation mechanism of the nanochain-structured mesoporous WC may need more work to fully understand, the results obtained here show a clue that it is very likely formed from the aggregation of the initially produced WC nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2e and 2f. A proposed mechanism is schematically demonstrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Firstly, CTAB as a surfactant is dispersed in deionized water to form spherical micelles. After addition of the mixture of glucose and AMT, partially carbonized tungsten-containing microspheres are formed with the hydrothermal treatment, and are stabilized by the surfactant. The mesoporous nanochain-structure is then formed by the self-assembly of the surfactant stabilized microspheres, probably through the charge density match14 during evaporation of the solvent in a vacuum oven. Finally, the m-NCTC product is obtained through heat treatment at 900 °C for 3 h in H2/N2 flow.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement confirms the high porosity of the m-NCTC material by its adsorption and desorption isotherms as shown in Fig. 3. Type IV nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, with a distinct hysteretic loop at the relative pressure of P/P0 ranging from 0.5 to 0.8, are observed, indicating the presence of many mesopores in the sample surface. The sample has a BET surface area of 113 m2 g−1 with a total pore volume of 0.35 cm3 g−1, exhibiting a high specific surface area in contrast to less than 20 m2 g−1 for commercial WC products and those synthesized by other methods.15 The pore size distribution was investigated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, and clearly displays two peaks of the pore size centered at about 2.5 nm and 5.5 nm respectively for two types of mesopore in m-NCTC (inset of Fig. 3). The 2.5 nm mesopores could be caused by the decomposition of surfactant microcells of CTAB14 and the 5.5 nm mesopores are possibly produced from packing of the initially formed WC nanoparticles, which is supported by the TEM measurement (Fig. 2b). The reported mesoporous tungsten carbide synthesized by a surfactant-assisted polymer method15 has displayed a surface area of 76 m2 g−1 with a total pore volume of 0.24 cm3 g−1, and an average pore size of 4.3 nm. Clearly, the m-NCTC synthesized by us has a much higher surface area and a higher total pore volume, mainly due to the smaller mesopore (2.5 nm) structure, thus indicating its better electrocatalytic potential.

The electrocatalytic behavior of m-NCTC was studied by preparing its supported Pt catalysts. It is found from TEM images (Fig. S3, ESI†) that the Pt nanoparticles can be uniformly dispersed on the surface of m-NCTC with an average particle size of ∼4 nm, which is well in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S4, ESI†). The m-NCTC supported Pt catalysts (Pt/m-NCTC) were characterized for methanol oxidation in a 1.0 mol L−1 CH3OH + 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution with cyclic voltammetry (CV). The obtained CV curve (curve 3 of Fig. 4a) exhibits very prominent characteristic peaks for the methanol oxidation. In comparison, CV curves of the methanol oxidation for carbon supported Pt catalyst (curve 2 of Fig. 4a) and m-NCTC (curve 1 of Fig. 4a) were measured in the same electrolyte used for Pt/m-NCTC. The results clearly indicate that m-NCTC has no characteristic peaks of methanol oxidation and Pt/C has a significantly lower electrocatalytic peak current than Pt/m-NCTC. More detail calculated electrocatalytic parameters of Pt/m-NCTC and Pt/C catalysts were compared and summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The unit mass activity of Pt/m-NCTC for methanol oxidation is 323 A (g Pt)−1, which is 1.6 times as large as that of Pt/C. This is an important improvement on the Pt catalyst since m-NCTC as the support material could significantly reduce the unit loading amount to achieve the same performance as the conventional Pt/C. The CV results also display two methanol oxidation peaks occurring on the positive and negative scanning respectively, and the Pt/m-NCTC catalyst has a more negative onset oxidation potential. It is known that the methanol electrochemical oxidation involves two steps, in which methanol is dissociatively adsorbed on Pt to produce CO or CO-like intermediates, followed by further oxidation to CO2 and can be expressed asCH3OH → CO + 4H+ + 4e− + H2O → CO2 + 6H+ + 6e−
 Fig. 4  (a) Cyclic voltagrammograms of methanol oxidation on m-NCTC, Pt/C and Pt/m-NCTC in 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 and 1.0 mol L−1 CH3OH solutions, scan rate: 50 mV s−1 and (b) the CO-stripping results on m-NCTC, Pt/C and Pt/m-NCTC in a 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 aqueous solution, scan rate: 15 mV s−1. 
In the CV curves, the oxidization peak in the positive scanning corresponds to the methanol oxidation. During the negative scanning, the adsorbed oxidation products are removed to release the Pt active sites, thus resulting in another oxidization peak. Apparently, removal of absorbed products on the Pt/m-NCTC catalyst is easier than on Pt/C and could lead to earlier methanol oxidation for another peak. Thus, the more negative onset potential and the smaller difference between anodic and cathodic peak potential for methanol oxidation on Pt/m-NCTC reveals the better electrocatalytic activity than that of Pt/C. This is very significant for Pt/m-NCTC as an electrocatalyst since it not only greatly boosts the apparent reaction rate, but also essentially improves its electroactivity for better energy conversion efficiency and higher power density. From XRD and TEM results, the particle size of Pt in Pt/m-NCTC is slightly larger than that in Pt/C. CO and MeOH oxidation is size dependent in some way. However, the electrocatalytic activity of Pt/m-NCTC is much higher than that of Pt/C. It could be ascribed to the complexity of the electrocatalytic process in an porous electrode. It is known that a porous electrode has high internal surface area for high electrochemical rates per apparent unit surface area of electrode. However, its internal area cannot, in general, be completely utilized at high current densities due to the difficult mass transfer and ohmic polarization in the internal pores that is simply dependant on the pore structure.16 Based on the porous electrode theory, a higher peak current produced by Pt/m-NCTC possibly indicates that the nanochain structure has a much higher utilization efficiency than carbon pore structure although the carbon has higher specific surface area. The chain-nanostructure very likely contributes to its higher electroactivity as the nanochain-packed structure could result in a bridge adsorption between two nanochains that has been proved to have a stronger dissociation for an absorbed reactant molecule.17 In addition, the CO-stripping results (Fig. 4b) show that CO oxidation potential for Pt/m-NCTC is ∼0.48 V vs. SCE, which is over 100 mV more negative than that of Pt/C (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the CO-like poisoning intermediates formed during the reaction process could be easily oxidized at a lower potential on Pt/m-NCTC, thus improving the resistance to CO poisoning on the Pt based catalyst. It is also observed that the pure m-NCTC is inactive for the CO oxidation as shown in Fig. 4b. The evaluation of the activity and stability of the Pt/m-NCTC catalyst for long-term alcohol oxidation is in progress along with the comparison to that of PtRu/C catalysts.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a unique nanochain-structured mesoporous tungsten carbide (m-NCTC) material with high specific surface area of 113 m2 g−1 was successfully synthesized through a novel and simple method by combining a surfactant assisted hydrothermal reaction and a thermal treatment process. A possible formation mechanism for the nanochain-structured mesoporous WC material was proposed. Pt supported on m-NCTC (Pt/m-NCTC) demonstrates larger apparent electrocatalytic current, higher electroactivity and better resistance to CO poisoning than a Pt/C catalyst. These significant improvements may be ascribed to its unique nanostructure for high utilization efficiency and reaction activity in a porous electrode. The material could have great potential applications in fuel cell electrocatalysts. The work could also render a universal and economic approach to synthesize other mesoporous materials for various important applications.
