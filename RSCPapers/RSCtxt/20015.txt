    , Accepted 6th May 2013First published on 7th May 2013AbstractMesoporous titania (Ms-TiO2) is successfully prepared using water immiscible room-temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium-tetrafluoroborate as a template and an effective additional solvent via the sol–gel method at low temperature. Ms-TiO2 is designed as an efficient visible light photocatalyst by copper (Cu) impregnation. X-ray diffraction analysis presents the nanocrystalline anatase phase. Cu impregnated Ms-TiO2 (Cu/Ms-TiO2) samples extend the absorption edge to the visible region. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum indicates the mixed valence states of Cu as Cu+ and Cu2+. The beneficial effect of Cu can be explained by the formation of oxygen vacancies with more Cu+ state. Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples exhibit superior visible light photocatalytic activities to Ms-TiO2, P-25 and 2.0% Cu/P-25 in the case of 2,4-dichlorophenol and methyl orange. Efficient charge separation due to the formation of Ti–O–Cu bonding at the surface and the associated appearance of oxygen vacancies together form the reason for higher degradation rate of organic compounds under illumination.
Introduction
Metal oxides represent the most diverse class of materials, with properties covering almost all aspects of materials science. A good example is crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2), the nanostructure of which is a key component of solar cells,1,2 electroluminescent hybrid devices3,4 and advanced photocatalysis.5–7 An important aspect in the preparation of TiO2 catalysts for environmental applications is the development of TiO2 powders with small grain size, large surface area, controlled porosity and tailor designed pore size distribution, in an attempt to further enhance catalytic activity and processing efficiency.
The preparation of mesoporous TiO2 materials with large surface area using a surfactant template was the focus of several studies.8–12 It is especially demanding to make crystalline TiO2 nanostructures at ambient conditions. The sol–gel chemistry performed in water-rich solvent mixtures unequivocally results in amorphous TiO2. This does not possess the desired electronic properties and relies on high temperature recrystallization. However, this usually destroys the previously existing nanostructures.13 Preliminary work on sol–gel reactions in nonaqueous media shows the availability of nanocrystalline TiO2 at ambient conditions.14 Room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) are an exceptional type of solvents consisting of ions. RTIL are salts with melting points below ca. 100 °C and sometimes as low as −96 °C.15 The first instance of RTIL with a melting point of 12 °C was reported in 1914.16 Most of the investigated RTIL consist of organic 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ions (abbreviated [Cnmim]+, where n = number of carbon atoms in a linear alkyl chain). The cations are combined with either organic or inorganic anions. RTIL are a particularly unique class of solvents that have negligible vapor pressure and possess versatile solvent and thermal stability properties.17
In order to solve low quantum yield and selectivity problems, many researchers modified TiO2 by doping it with metal impurities. The influence of various transition metal ions on the photo activity of pure TiO2 has also been studied, with the aim of improving the efficiency of photocatalytic process.18,19 The addition of transition metals to TiO2 increases the rate of photocatalytic oxidation due to electron scavenging by metal ions at the semiconductor surface.20 This prevents electron–hole recombination and results in an increased rate of formation of OH radicals.21 Recently, there are many reports on the addition of Cu into the TiO2 matrix to improve the efficiency of photocatalysts under visible light irradiation.22–24 Colon et al.25 prepared copper doped TiO2 by a sol–gel method with improved photocatalytic activity. Jun et al.26 reported the fabrication of CuO-core/TiO2-shell nanowires using a two-step process. Li et al.27 synthesized the rutile TiO2 nanocrystals via a low-temperature hydrothermal method and Cu(0) was deposited on TiO2.
The objective of the present study is to prepare mesoporous titania (Ms-TiO2) using water immiscible RTIL as a template via the sol–gel method. This Ms-TiO2 is used as a basic support for copper (Cu) impregnation to make an efficient use of visible light for the degradation of organics. The promoting effects on the photo catalytic activity, the reduced form of Cu with associated appearance of oxygen vacancies, mesoporosity and Ti–O–Cu linkage on the surface are examined and discussed.
Experimental section
Materials
Tetra butyl titanate (TBT), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and copper nitrate Cu (NO3)2·3H2O were AR grade. The RTIL used in this work is 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium-tetrafluoroborate, [C4mim]+ BF4. All the above chemicals were supplied from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. Degussa P-25 (a commercial nanocrystalline TiO2 that consists of ca. 80% anatase and 20% rutile; Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area ca. 50.0 m2 g−1) was supplied by Degussa. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Double distilled water was used throughout the experiments.
Catalyst preparation
In a typical synthetic procedure of mesoporous titania, RTIL was used as the template and TBT as the sol–gel precursor. 5.0 mL RTIL was mixed with 5.0 mL TBT under mild magnetic stirring. After homogenization of the mixture, 2.5 mL aqueous solution of 0.01 M HCl was added dropwise. The resultant mixture solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h allowing the sol–gel reaction of TiO2 to occur, followed by exposure under vacuum at 80 °C for the removal of formed butanol during hydrolysis of TBT. The complete gelation process was accomplished by keeping the sample in an open flask at 60 °C for 72 h. The incorporated RTIL was removed from TiO2 by extracting the sample with acetonitrile in an autoclave at 90 °C. The extraction process was repeated several times with fresh solvent until complete removal of RTIL from the TiO2 was achieved. This is determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) of the hybrid materials in which the imidazolium (C–H) stretching region (3200–3000 cm−1) of RTIL disappears completely.28 The final product was dried and ground into powder. Samples containing 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt% Cu were prepared by a wet impregnation method. Ms-TiO2 and Cu (NO3)2·3H2O samples in different weight ratios were mixed in an ethanol solution and ground in an agate mortar. The mixture was dried at 60 °C for 1 h followed by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. The prepared samples were denoted as x% Cu/Ms-TiO2, where x% refers to the CuO weight ratios. P-25 was also impregnated with 2.0% CuO for comparison, designated as 2.0% Cu/P-25.
Photocatalytic activity test
The degradation of MO and 2,4-DCP organic pollutants was carried out in a 100 mL quartz photochemical reactor. The reaction solution contained 0.05 g catalyst mixed with 50 mL aqueous solution of 20 mg L−1 MO and 2,4-DCP. A 1000 watt halogen lamp (model number LZG 220-1000-1 manufactured by Philips and Yaming Lighting Co. Ltd.) was used as the light source. The dimensions of the lamp were 228 and 12 mm in length and diameter, respectively, with 20000 lm luminescence. The light from the lamp included beams from the ultraviolet and visible light regions. The short-wavelength components (λ < 420 nm) of light were cut off using a cut-off glass filter. During the reaction, a water-cooling system cooled the water-jacketed photochemical reactor to maintain the solution at room temperature. The distance between the lamp and the centre of the quartz tube was 10 cm. The scheme for the photocatalytic property experimentation is according to our previous report.29 Prior to illumination, the suspension was sonicated for 10 min and then magnetically stirred in darkness for 30 min to establish adsorption–desorption equilibrium at room temperature. During irradiation, stirring was maintained to keep the mixture in suspension. The samples were centrifuged to separate the photo catalyst for analysis. The concentration of MO and 2,4-DCP was analyzed using a Cary 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer at their characteristic wavelengths of 464 and 283 nm, respectively. The photo activities for MO and 2,4-DCP in the dark in the presence of the photocatalyst and under visible light irradiation in the absence of the photocatalyst were also evaluated. The reproducibility was checked by repeating the measurements at least three times and was found to be within the acceptable limit (±3%).
Characterization
Various analytical techniques were applied to study the structure formation. The crystal phase, composition and crystallinity of obtained mesoporous TiO2 and Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples were determined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) with Rigaku D/Max 2550 VB/PC apparatus (Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 0.154056 nm) at room temperature operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. Small angle and wide angle X-ray diffraction spectra (SAXRD and WAXRD) were recorded in the angular ranges 0.5–10° and 20–80°, respectively. The morphology was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2011) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV-visible diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained for dry-pressed disk samples using a Scan UV-visible near infrared spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary 500) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly using BaSO4 as the reflectance sample. Spectra were recorded at room temperature in the range 200–800 nm in air. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. Samples were degassed at 473 K before measurement. Raman spectra of different samples were recorded by Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 785 nm. FTIR spectra were recorded by employing a Nicolet 740 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a triglycine sulfate detector and a potassium bromide beam splitter. The instrument employed for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA system with Al Kα radiation operated at 250 W. The shift of binding energy due to relative surface charging was corrected using C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at 298 K using a Bruker EMX-8/2.7 EPR spectrometer operating at X band and magnetic field modulation of 100 kHz with a microwave power of 20.502 mW and modulation amplitude of 4.00 G. The microwave frequency of 9.86 GHz was read with a frequency counter. Energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were observed by an EDAX spectrometer (Falcon). The decrease of total organic carbon (TOC), which indicated the mineralization of the dye, was determined using an Elementar TOC analyzer (Shimadzu).
Results and discussion
We have successfully synthesized Ms-TiO2 with variable Cu ratios. Ms-TiO2 is prepared using RTIL, which is a short-chain organic molecular compound. It acts as a template and an effective additional solvent in the sol–gel method at low temperature. The absence of vapor pressure of ionic liquids plays an important role in the preparation of mesoporous particles with large surface area. In conventional sol–gel methods, the presence of water is a crucial factor for the formulation of sol because water is required to hydrolyze the alkoxide precursor.30 However, the titanium precursor undergoes very rapid hydrolysis in the presence of an excessive amount of water, which produces aggregated particles with low surface area. This result can be attributed to the fact that a water immiscible ionic liquid can be blended homogeneously with TBT. This solvent as a template plays an important role in the building of porous crystalline TiO2 particles.
RTIL cannot self-assemble into the ordered micelle structure by rearrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecular chains in solution such as long-chain surfactants.31 A so-called hydrogen bond-co-π–π stacking mechanism, based on the special molecular structure and properties of RTIL, is responsible for the formation of wormhole-like mesoporous TiO2 with RTIL as a template via a nanocasting technique.32 It has also been found that the imidazolium ring of RTIL does not form hydrogen bonds with water. In the present case, the tetrafluoroborate [BF4]− anion should interact in a similar fashion with tilanol Ti(OH)4 and form hydrogen bonds in the reaction system, which may induce the oriented arrangement of [BF4]− anions along the pore walls, as shown in Scheme 1. Herein, we incorporated Cu with Ms-TiO2 to enhance the quantum efficiency in visible light. Cu impregnation in the mesoporous structure is responsible for the increase in photocatalytic efficiency.

The bulk structure of the as-prepared Ms-TiO2 is characterized by SAXRD and WAXRD spectra, as shown in Fig. 1. The SAXRD pattern shows one single peak in Fig. 1 (inset), which corresponds to the packing of wormlike pores into a certain distorted alignment. The WAXRD pattern of the as-prepared Ms-TiO2 sample shows the anatase phase without any indication of other crystalline products and is relatively broad due to the nanosize of the crystals. It is worth noting that the TiO2 particles contain the crystalline anatase phase, although these are only dried at low temperature. The crystallite size of as-prepared TiO2 is estimated at around 9.1 nm, using Scherrer's equation based on XRD broadening of the 101 peak. Fig. 2 shows WAXRD diffraction patterns of Ms-TiO2 and Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples. All Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples show only the characteristic peaks corresponding to the anatase phase. There are no reflections of copper oxide due to its high dispersion or small amounts.24 It can also be inferred from Fig. 2 that the crystalline form of anatase has not been changed by the impregnation of Cu. The intensities of the anatase peaks increase by increasing the amount of copper. The dispersion of CuO on anatase can affect the surface morphology of the catalyst, which can be equal to the number of surface octahedral vacant sites available in the preferentially exposed (001) plane of anatase.33 The low amounts of Cu occupy all the vacant sites in the surface octahedral sites, resulting in an increase of peak intensities.

UV-visible DRS of Ms-TiO2, P-25, 2.0% Cu/P-25 and different Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 3a. Ms-TiO2 is dominated by the edge relative to the O2−–Ti4+ charge transition at 300–380 nm of anatase TiO2, which agrees well with the results quoted in literature.34 Ms-TiO2 displays no significant absorbance in visible light, due to the large band gap (3.2 eV). Surface modification of Ms-TiO2 with copper significantly affects the absorption properties of the catalysts. Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples show a spectral response in the visible region (400–800 nm) and absorbance becomes stronger with the increase of copper content from 1.0 to 4.0 wt%. A change of color from white to greenish is observed from 0 to 4.0 wt%. According to the literature,25,35 bands describing the Cu2+ and Cu+ species can be located in several regions. In our Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples, the band in the 210–270 nm region of the spectra is probably due to overlapping with the O2−(2p) → Ti4+(3d) charge transfer. A large contribution between 400 and 600 nm is attributed to the presence of Cu+ clusters in the partially reduced CuO matrix, as well as (Cu–O–Cu)2+ clusters. The broad absorption band between 600–800 nm clearly suggests the increase of the crystalline and bulk CuO in octahedral symmetry. These are assigned to the 2Eg–2T2g transitions, due to the presence of Cu2+ and Cu+ clusters.36

In Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples, recombination between photoelectrons and holes can effectively be inhibited due to the presence of Cu+. It acts as an electron trapper, leading to a strong response in the visible range.36 The reduced form of copper generates oxygen vacancies (OV) below the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in the decrease of the band gap. These act as additional impurity states or defect energy levels, which enhance visible light absorption. The bandgap of Ms-TiO2 is 3.2 eV, which corresponds to an absorption wavelength of <400 nm. The bandgap of Cu/Ms-TiO2 catalysts decreases with increasing amount of copper, which is coherent with the stoichiometric deficiency of the Ti/O ratio.37 The calculated band gaps of different samples are given in Table 1.

The laser Raman spectra of Ms-TiO2 and different Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 4. Raman bands of Ms-TiO2 appear at 399.5, 517.5 and 640.5 cm−1. The bands typical of anatase are observed at 146.0, 196.0, 397.0, 516.0 and 638.0 cm−1 assigned to the Eg, B1g, A1g, B2g and Eg vibrational modes of TiO2, respectively.24 The bands of the anatase phase are gradually decreased in intensity and become broader with increase in incorporated CuO. This is ascribed to lower crystallinity of the anatase phase.

Fig. 5 shows TEM and HRTEM images of as prepared Ms-TiO2 and 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 calcined at 500 °C. The TEM image (Fig. 5a) shows the pore morphology of as-synthesized Ms-TiO2, demonstrating the irregular wormhole-like mesostructure. The mesopores are of narrow size distribution and no large pores are observed in the image. This indicates the homogeneity of RTIL in the TiO2 matrix and no phase separation occurs during the sol–gel process of TiO2. The homogeneous distribution of pores in the matrix is because of its high mechanical stability. This is an essential prerequisite for the use of such systems as long-lasting catalyst supports or solid inorganic membrane systems. HRTEM of Ms-TiO2 (Fig. 5b) is indicative of the anatase nanocrystalline structure. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Ms-TiO2 in Fig. 5c shows a sequence of diffraction rings consistent with the anatase phase (PDF No. 21-1272). This corresponds to the crystal structure of mesoporous material, as confirmed by the XRD pattern.

Fig. 5d and e show the TEM images of the Cu/Ms-TiO2 composite sample, indicating an irregularly wormlike mesoporous structure. HRTEM (Fig. 5f) illustrates the presence of crystallized Ms-TiO2. The interlayer distance of 0.35 nm corresponds well with the lattice spacing plane of (101) of TiO2 while 0.24 and 0.25 nm is consistent with the lattice fringe plane of (111) of CuO and Cu2O. The SAED pattern (Fig. 5g) of Cu/Ms-TiO2 shows a sequence of diffraction rings for anatase TiO2 with Cu impurities.
The N2 isotherm of the Ms-TiO2 sample calcined at 500 °C is illustrated in Fig. 6. The isotherm exhibits type IV, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials, based on the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification.38 A sharp inflection of the adsorbed volume at P/P0 = 0.45 (hysteresis loop) and a relatively steep desorption branch indicate a distribution of various sized cavities but with the same entrance diameter.39 This means that the existence of mesoporosity with similar sized entrances in material is in agreement with the small-angle diffraction peak in Fig. 1a. The pore size distribution based on the adsorption branch of the isotherm is relatively narrow, with an average pore diameter of 3.0 nm. The narrow pore size distribution indicates good homogeneity of the pores. The BET surface area of the material is about 273.0 m2 g−1. This high surface area provides more space for copper distribution. Light is also harvested more efficiently due to the large surface area and multiple scattering. In the Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples, slight effects on the textural properties are observed for impregnated samples with copper contents given in Table 1. For Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples, surface areas decrease with increasing Cu content, due to the intrusion of Cu particles in the pore channels of the TiO2 structure.

The FTIR spectrum in Fig. 7 demonstrates a broad absorbance peak in the range 3100–3450 cm−1 and a strong absorbance peak at around 1620 cm−1, attributed to the vibrations of the surface-adsorbed H2O and Ti–OH bonds. The low energy bands of the Ti–O bond are found at 1061 and below 1000 cm−1. The band at 550 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibrations of Ti–O and Cu–O. The broad bands between 800 and 1400 cm−1 are attributed to the lattice vibrations of titanium oxide, which is characteristic of the Ti–O–Cu bond. This observation confirms co-assembly of the TiO2 and copper building clusters on the surface of the mesoporous structure.40 The presence of a specific band at 2356 cm−1 is indicative of CuO in the sample.

Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) is carried out to determine the presence of elements of the 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 sample. Fig. 8 shows the peaks of Cu, Ti and O. The presence of the signal of Au can be ascribed to the Au grid. The Cu content was 1.7 wt%, which was close to its stoichiometric value of 2.0 wt%.

Quantitative XPS analysis was performed for Ms-TiO2 and 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2. Fig. 9 shows high-resolution XPS spectra for the Ti2p, O1s and Cu 2p regions. The Ms-TiO2 contains Ti, O and C. The 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 sample contains only Ti, O, Cu and C elements. The C element can be ascribed to the adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself. The XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p region for 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 9A. The peak for the Cu 2p core level can be seen in the 960–925 eV binding energy region. The Cu 2p signal for the sample is resolved into Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 core levels. The deconvoluted spectrum shows peaks for the Cu 2p1/2 core levels at 954.5 and 951.7, and for the Cu 2p3/2 core level at 933.1 and 931.4 eV, respectively. The peaks of Cu 2p3/2 (931.4 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (951.7 eV) correspond well with the presence of the Cu+ state. In addition to these, the peaks of 2p3/2 (933.1 eV) and 2p1/2 (954.5 eV), and their shake-up satellite peak at 942.5 eV correspond to the presence of Cu2+.27 This is attributed to shake-up transitions by a ligand–metal 3d charge transfer that does not occur with Cu+ species, which have completely filled 3d shells.41,42 This confirms the presence of copper in mixed valence i.e. Cu+ and Cu2+ species. The percentages calculated from the XPS analysis for Cu+ and Cu2+ are 62.8 and 37.2%, respectively. According to our results, the shake-up peak appears very weak, pointing out the presence of small amounts of Cu2+ together with the Cu+ species. Thus, considerable stabilization of the Cu2O species is taking place for this system. This is consistent with the presence of copper species that accounts for significant photoresponse.

The binding energies of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in Ms-TiO2 are observed at 464.05 and 458.40 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9B(a). This value is in accordance with the reports.43,44 The binding energies for Ti 2p3/2 correspond well to Ti4+ in the TiO2 structure. The binding energies of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 for the 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 sample are located at about 463.83 and 458.19 eV, respectively. There is a slight decrease in the binding energy of Ti 2p in 2.0% Cu content, as indicated in Fig. 9B(b). The slight decrease in the binding energy of Ti 2p is due to the surface interactions of Ti4+ and Cu.45 On the other hand, the O 1s region indicates the binding energy at 529.8 eV, as shown in Fig. 9C. The position of the primary O 1s feature is assigned to lattice oxygen associated with metal oxides. The similarity in the Cu and Ti ionic radii (0.72 Å for Cu and 0.68 Å for Ti) allows interfacial incorporation of Cu on TiO2. These results infer that Cu–O–Ti linkages have been formed in Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples, as confirmed by FTIR analysis. In 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2, the O1s region can be fitted by three curves, as shown in Fig. 9D. The first peak located at 529.7 eV is assigned to Ti–O and Ti–O–Cu in Cu/Ms-TiO2, while the second peak, located at 531.4 eV, is ascribed to the hydroxyl groups.7 The third peak, located at 532.8 eV, is assigned to the OV associated with reduced Cu+, which corresponds well with the literature.46 XPS results infer that the interfacial Cu–O–Ti linkages are formed in Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples with more reduced Cu+.
The EPR spectra of Ms-TiO2, 2.0 and 4.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 are presented in Fig. 10. Ms-TiO2 shows no signal in the EPR spectrum. The EPR spectra of Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples show the mixed valence state of Cu+ and Cu2+ due to the isotropic and broad signals. The average g value for the sample is 2.07. This broad signal is assigned to the charge transfer interaction between the Cu+ and Cu2+ pairs. Rapid electron exchange exists between the Cu+ and Cu2+ pairs. The component with resonance parameters gII = 2.33 and g∞ = 2.07 can be assigned to the Cu2+ ions. The g values of the copper species suggest the existence of Cu+/Cu2+ occupying sites. As the copper content increases from 2.0 to 4.0%, the EPR signals become more intense and broader.47

The photocatalytic activities of different Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples are evaluated in comparison to Ms-TiO2, P-25 and 2.0% Cu/P-25 in the case of photo-oxidation of MO and 2,4-DCP under visible light irradiation. The obtained results (Fig. 11) have demonstrated that Cu/Ms-TiO2 catalysts are efficient visible light photocatalysts for the degradation of organic species. The highest activity of Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples is observed for 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 catalysts. 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 showed 72.0% and 61.0% degradation of MO and 2, 4-DCP, respectively, after 5 h reaction. Degussa P-25 and Ms-TiO2 show less degradation due to the large band gap value. 2.0% Cu/P-25 shows less activity as compared to 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2, due to the low surface area and non porous behavior.

Modification of Ms-TiO2 with 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 results in an abrupt increase of photocatalytic activity. The highest activity of Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples with 2.0% copper content is the result of the presence of a more reduced form of copper. The reduced form of copper generates the oxygen vacancies. These are the centers of positive charge, which bind electrons easily. The electrons are excited to the conduction band and act as donors. Thus a practical charge carrier separation will take place and enhances the photo activity of this system. The above results confirmed the presence of more Cu2O sites in the TiO2 matrix. In this sense, Song et al. reported the influence of the oxidation state in metal Cu-doped TiO2 photocatalysts.48 They indicated that the evolution of Cu0 toward Cu+ and Cu2+ progressively leads to a lowering in the photocatalytic activity. Similar behaviour would be considered in the present case. The stabilization of Cu2O species versus CuO induces better photocatalytic results for MO and 2,4-DCP degradation. Li et al.49 reported the improvement in the photocatalytic process achieved by the incorporation of Cu2O into the TiO2 matrix by an electrochemical method. Thus, based on previous results, we infer from photocatalytic activity values that surface Cu+ acts as the photoactive species,50 which favors the electron transfer to the surface and prevents electron–hole recombination.
The band gap values of the Cu/Ms-TiO2 samples range from 2.3–2.9 eV. But there is an optimum concentration of loaded ions to make the thickness of space charge layer substantially equal to the light penetration depth. As the concentration of impregnated ions increases toward the optimum amount, the surface barrier becomes higher and the space charge region becomes narrower. The electron–hole pairs within the region are efficiently separated before recombination. Above 2.0% Cu content, the formation of copper oxide clusters on the TiO2 surface play the role of electron traps and produce a diminution of the fast electron–hole recombination together with a band gap narrowing effect.
No detectable degradation of MO dye (photofading) is observed in the absence of the catalyst. The decomposition of MO and 2,4-DCP follows first order kinetics. The photocatalytic reaction is simply described by the equation8ln(C0/C) = kapptwhere C is the concentration of solute remaining in the solution at irradiation time of t and C0 is the initial concentration at t = 0. kapp denotes the degradation rate constant.
The removal of MO and 2,4-DCP as a function of irradiation time is described in Fig. 12. The Cu/Ms-TiO2 demonstrates notably high photocatalytic activity over a wide composition range, whereas the pure Ms-TiO2 and P-25 show a negligible efficiency. The calculated degradation rate constants (kapp) in decomposing MO and 2,4-DCP with several photocatalytic samples are given in Fig. 12. In particular, the 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 reveals the highest decomposition rate and thus kapp is higher than that of the other photocatalysts. The rate constant of the photocatalytic reaction remains the same after prolonged exposure times of 10 h, confirming the high stability of the catalyst.

The catalyst lifetime is an important parameter of the photocatalytic process. Being able to use the catalyst for longer periods of time leads to a significant cost reduction for the treatment. For this reason, the catalyst was recycled, showing a drop in efficiency from 72% to 61% in four cycles for 5 h, as shown in Fig. 13. This is likely due to fouling of the catalyst and loss due to filtration. The mesopores are beneficial for photocatalysis, because these provide more accessible active sites and a large surface area for copper incorporation. Large surface areas and pore volumes enrich pollutant molecules in the channels to form contact with anatase nanocrystals, which act as the catalytic sites to degrade the molecules under visible light. These features make the composites into efficient visible light photocatalysts. In the present study, we observe that enhanced photocatalytic activity of 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 is due to the Cu+/Cu2+ sites as interfacial Ti–O–Cu surface linkages, reduced band gap energy, mesoporosity, presence of more Cu+, oxygen vacancies, efficient charge separation and optimal copper incorporation.

Interfacial Ti–O–Cu linkages in Cu/Ms-TiO2 are also responsible for high photocatalytic activities. Single site photocatalytic solids with well-defined, spatially separated active centers have shown great promise for applications including environmental abatement and solar fuel generation.51 Open-structure solids such as mesoporous silica and zeolites are the most common supports for active photocatalysts. For example, tetrahedrally coordinated Ti sites, which demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity for NO decomposition and CO2 reduction,51 were usually prepared in confined environments such as zeolite pores or dispersed onto silica substrates. Interfacial Ti–O–Si linkages have been shown to play an important role in altering the catalytic properties of TiO2–SiO2 binary oxides.52 In the pioneering work by Lin and Frei, binuclear metal-to-metal charge transfer moieties such as Ti–O–Cu and Zr–O–Cu were assembled in mesoporous silicate sieve as active sites for solar fuel applications.53,54 Hashimoto and co-workers assembled Ti–O–Ce bimetallic moieties in mesoporous silica, which operated as photocatalysts under visible light illumination.55 It is hypothesized that the solid–solid interface is a key structural feature that facilitates charge separation and enhances photocatalytic efficiency and may be the locus of photocatalytic “hot spots”. In this present study, the interfacial Ti–O–Cu linkages exist in Cu/Ms-TiO2, and are the promoting factor for photocatalytic efficiency.
When copper oxide and TiO2 form composite photo catalysts, the photo excitation process occurs. The photogenerated electrons can be transferred to the lower-lying conduction band of copper oxide, while holes will accumulate in the valence band of TiO2 and are effectively scavenged by the oxidation. The electrons are transferred onto the surface of copper oxide rather than undergoing bulk recombination. From a thermodynamic perspective, trapping electron by metal ions Cu+ or Cu2+ within the semiconductor photocatalyst is feasible due to the reduction potential of metal ions, which is more positive than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 eV). Thus copper impregnation creates interfacial Ti–O–Cu linkages and shows a low band gap value as compared to pure TiO2. Visible irradiation on Cu/Ms-TiO2 produces electron–hole pairs [eqn (1)] at the surface of the photocatalyst; the electrons are trapped by the Cu+/Cu2+ [eqn (1)]. The positive redox potential value of Cu+ is higher than that of Cu2+ (0.52 vs. 0.34 V). Therefore copper in the form of Cu+ should effectively act as an electron trapper to prohibit electron hole recombination due to the association of oxygen vacancies and should play an important role in photocatalysis. These can trap the photo generated electrons, resulting in suppression of the recombination of electron–hole pairs and, thus, improved photocatalytic activity [eqn (2)]. However, owing to the relatively strong interaction between TiO2 and Cu particles in mixed valence states, Cu2+/Cu+ showed the Cu2+ to Cu+ conversion cycle [eqn (3)]. The electron in Cu+ is captured by oxygen molecules dissolved in the suspension and the hole in the valence band of titania can be captured by H2O2 species adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to produce the hydroxyl radicals. These hydroxyl radicals then oxidize the pollutants [eqn (4)–(8)]. The proposed degradation mechanism is also represented in Scheme 2. TiO2 + Cu2+/Cu+ + visible (hv) → TiO2(h+) + Cu2+/Cu+(e−)(1) Cu+ (OV0) + e− → Cu+ (OV)(2) Cu2+ + e− → Cu+(3) Cu+ + O2 → Cu2+ + O2˙−(4) H+ + O2˙− ↔ HO2˙(5) Cu+ + HO2˙ + H+ → Cu2+ + H2O2(6) H2O2 + h+VB → OH˙ + H+(7) org + OH˙ → degraded products(8)

Conclusions
Ms-TiO2 is prepared by a convenient nanocasting technique using RTIL as a template and an effective additional solvent by the sol–gel method at low temperature. In this system, the controlled hydrolysis and condensation rate by RTIL is responsible for the formation of the mesoporous structure. In order to enhance the quantum efficiency of prepared Ms-TiO2, Cu in different weight ratios is impregnated. The 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 sample demonstrates notably high photocatalytic activity to decompose MO and 2,4-DCP, as compared to Ms-TiO2, P-25 and 2.0% CuO/P-25. The more reduced form of copper favors formation of oxygen vacancies, which play an important role in photocatalysis.56 The interfacial Ti–O–Cu linkages in Cu/Ms-TiO2 have a promoting effect on photocatalytic efficiency. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of 2.0% Cu/Ms-TiO2 is due to the interfacial Ti–O–Cu linkages, reduced band gap, mesoporosity, reduced Cu+ form, efficient charge separation and optimal copper content.
