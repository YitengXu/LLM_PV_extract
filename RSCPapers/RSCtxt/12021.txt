    , Accepted 7th December 2012First published on 10th December 2012AbstractThe present study shows that although the dye amount in TiO2 films increased continuously with dye soaking time (up to 24 h) photocurrent density (Jsc) in the dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) increased until an initial 50 min of soaking and remained unchanged beyond that. The electron transport rate, as measured by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, in these films also increased up to the initial 50 min of dye soaking and remained almost the same for films soaked for a longer time. Despite faster diffusion of electrons, current per mole of dye continuously decreased with increase in amount of dye. This decrease in current per mole of dye was because of the continuous decrease in percent light reaching the dye molecules in the TiO2 layers away from the substrate, which resulted in a fraction of dye that did not undergo photoexcitation. However, this excess amount of dye reduced recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and resulted in continuous increase in open circuit voltage (Voc) of the cells with increasing amount of dye. Photoluminescence measurements confirmed that these dye molecules, which did not contribute to the current but reduced recombination, are also chemisorbed on TiO2 in a monolayer.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention since 1991, following their first demonstration by Michael Gratzel.1 They have been considered to be a potential alternative to conventional p/n junction solar cells because of their low cost, easy and inexpensive methods of fabrication and power conversion efficiency as high as 11–12%.2–5 The efficiency of a DSSC depends on carrier generation and its collection at the TiO2 photoanode influences the efficiency of DSSCs. The electron collection efficiency of a DSSC, in turn, depends on rate of injection of electrons from the dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and its transport through the TiO2 film. Diffusion of electrons in a mesoporous TiO2 film is a slower process (milliseconds) compared to electron injection to the CB of TiO26 and therefore, it plays a determinant role in changing the current generated by a DSSC. The rate of transport of injected electrons may depend on several factors, such as concentration of electrons generated, which depends on the amount of dye loaded in a film7 and intensity of incident light,8–10 connectivity between the particles,11,12 crystallinity and phase composition13 of TiO2 used to make the photoanode. In the studies reported so far, dependence of electron transport has been examined with varying light intensity6,10,14,15 incident on a TiO2 photoanode saturated with dye. Electron lifetime decreases and diffusion coefficient increases with intensity of light. In all these studies, the dependence of electron diffusion on intensity of light has been explained by a multiple trapping model,9,10,14,15 which states that diffusion rate is affected by the surface trap states.
It has been reported that recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface can be reduced by increasing coverage of the TiO2 area exposed to the electrolyte.16,17 In addition, dye loading may also alter the rate of transport of electrons through the TiO2 film by altering the electron density in the TiO2 film, as is observed in the case of varying light intensity. However, studies on the effect of intensity of the incident light on electron diffusion did not take into account the recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, which is believed to change with the extent of coverage of the TiO2 surface with the dye. The present work has been undertaken to study the effect of the amount of dye on electron diffusion through the TiO2 photoanode and recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.
2. Experimental work
7.2 g of as-received Degussa P25 TiO2 powder (Evonik Degussa India Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) was milled in ethanol containing 1 ml of polyethyleneglycol (i.e. PEG600) (Thomas Baker, Mumbai, India) per 1 g of TiO2 for 24 h on a pot mill. The obtained slurry was then coated on cleaned and dried FTO substrates (8 Ω/□, Pilkington, USA) on an area of 1 cm × 1 cm by doctor-blade technique. The TiO2 films were dried at 40 °C overnight, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 1 h. These sintered films were then taken out of a furnace at 100 °C and soaked immediately in 0.3 mM N3 dye (from Dyesol, Queanbeyan NSW, Australia) solution in ethanol for different times; 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 min and 4, 8, 16 and 24 h. The films were then taken out of the dye solution and rinsed properly in ethanol to wash off the dye molecules that were not adsorbed in the films. UV-Vis transmission spectra of the films were taken with a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (model: V-650, JASCO Analytical instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The dye loading in the TiO2 films was determined from the UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the dye desorbed into 1 N NaOH solution.
DSSCs were fabricated using the above TiO2 films soaked in dye solution for different times. An FTO substrate with Pt deposited on it by sputtering was used as the counter electrode. The two electrodes were held together with a 25μm thick Surlyn (Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland) gasket sandwiched between them. The gap between the electrodes was filled with an electrolyte, which was composed of 0.1 M LiI (Merck and Co., Germany), 0.05 M I2 (Thomas Baker, Mumbai, India), 0.5 M tertiary butylpyridine (TBP) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in acetonitrile (Merck and Co., Germany). Current and voltage of the cells were measured with a Keithley 2420 source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA) under illumination (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) and in the dark. A class A solar simulator (Newport Corporation, USA) was used for creating the standard illumination (100 mW cm−2). Photoelectrochemical characterizations, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) of the cells were done using a potentiostat and galvanostat (PGSTAT 302 N, Metrohm Autolab, The Netherlands) equipped with a frequency response analyzer. EIS of the DSSCs were taken under illumination (1 sun) with a 10 mV AC voltage superimposed with the open circuit potential (OCP) of the cells and in the dark with 10 mV AC voltage superimposed with a forward bias voltage of 750 mV. The frequency was varied from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. Recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface was directly measured from the open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) of the cells. The OCVD measurements were taken by using a chronopotentiometry method with the PGSTAT. The cell was kept under 1 sun for as long as a stable Voc was observed and then the lamp was switched off. The decay in Voc with time was measured. IMPS of the cells were taken at short circuit under the modulated intensity of a green LED (λ = 540 nm).
3. Results and discussion
TiO2 films (∼9 μm) soaked in dye solution for different times showed increased dye loading as a function of dye soaking time (Fig. 1). Short circuit current density (Jsc) of the cells increased with dye soaking time (from 10 to 50 min) as the amount of dye in the film increased. However, it remained almost the same beyond 50 min of dye soaking (Fig. 2) although the amount of dye continued to increase up to 24 h. The dye loading and I–V characteristics of the cells made of TiO2 films with different dye loading are listed in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) curves of the cells made from TiO2 films soaked in dye solution for different times. Electron transport time (Fig. 4) calculated from peak frequency of IMPS curves (τ =1/2πfmax, where fmax is the peak frequency) was found to decrease for TiO2 films soaked in dye solution for 10 to 50 min, after which it remained almost unchanged. This was found to be consistent with change in Jsc with dye soaking time. Surprisingly, current per mole of dye was found to decrease continuously as the amount of dye in the films increased (Fig. 5). This decrease in current per mole of dye with increase in dye amount, despite faster electron transport, was thought to be due to a fraction of dye molecules that did not contribute to current. This fraction of dye molecules, which did not contribute to Jsc, might have been increased with dye loading in the films. Thus, current per mole of dye decreased continuously with increase in amount of dye in the films.

It is known that dye molecules, which are only chemisorbed on TiO2 by either chelating, monodentate esteric linkage, bidentate bridging or hydrogen bonding, can inject electrons into TiO218–22 and contribute to Jsc of the cell. Therefore, the excess amount of dye, which did not contribute to current, was suspected to be present either in multilayers or physisorbed on the TiO2. These dye molecules, which do not inject electrons into the CB of TiO2, are expected to emit light (photoluminescence) by returning to their ground states. However, photoluminescence spectra of TiO2 films with different amounts of dye (Fig. 6) showed very low intense peaks with no significant difference in the intensity at about 730 nm, where the N3 dye in isolation (not adsorbed on TiO2) gave a strong emission peak. This indicated that dye molecules are mostly chemisorbed in all these films irrespective of dye amount (dye soaking time) and almost no dye molecules are present in multilayers or physisorbed, which would give strong emission.

The UV-Vis transmission spectra of the TiO2 films with different amount of dye showed that % transmittance at ∼530 nm where the dye absorbs at a maximum decreased appreciably from 10 to 30 min of dye adsorption and then decreased insignificantly (Fig. 7). This confirmed that with an increase in the amount of dye in the film, more light is absorbed by the first few layers of the film, and light reaching TiO2 layers away from the substrate decreases continuously throughout the film. Essentially, light absorption by the films did not change much after 50 min of dye soaking and therefore Jsc remained almost unchanged beyond this dye-soaking time. This may be because of the same amount of dye getting excited in the films soaked in dye solution for times beyond 50 min, even though amount of dye increased continuously in these films. Since dye loading increased and light reaching the layers away from substrate decreased continuously with dye adsorption time, the fraction of dye which does not undergo photoexcitation and thus, does not contribute to current, increased with amount of dye. Therefore, current per mole of dye decreased continuously with increase in dye loading. However, it is worth noting here that although Jsc remained unchanged beyond 50 min of dye adsorption, Voc increased continuously with increase in amount of dye (Fig. 8). The rate of increase in Voc was found to be greater for dye-soaking times beyond 60 min than for shorter times (Fig. 2 and 8). This indicated that the dye molecules adsorbed on TiO2 beyond 60 min of dye-soaking did not contribute to the current but helped in reducing the recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, effectively in the first few layers of TiO2 that absorbed most of the incident light. This reduction in recombination was found to be consistent with the continuous reduction in the dark current (Fig. 9) with increase in dye loading. An indirect conclusion that can also be drawn from these observations is that while dye loading increased in the first few layers of TiO2 where majority of the light absorption takes place the fraction of dye molecules that undergoes excitation reaches saturation. The fact that transmittance is non-zero, yet the fraction of dye molecules that undergo excitation reaches saturation, points to a physical limitation wherein the photon flux is present but is not absorbed, and dye molecules exist in the ground state.

The Nyquist plots (Fig. 10) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the cells, measured at corresponding open circuit voltages and under illumination (1 sun), show one large semicircle (at ∼1000 Hz) for films soaked in dye solution for 10, 30 and 60 min and two distinguishable semicircles (one at ∼1000 Hz and the other at ∼30 Hz) for films soaked for 4, 16 and 24 h. In the case of films soaked for a longer time, the first semicircle (at ∼1000 Hz) corresponds to charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface while the second semicircle (at ∼30 Hz) corresponds to charge transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. For the TiO2 films soaked for a shorter time (10–60 min), the semicircle representing the Pt/electrolyte interface was large enough to hide the second semicircle corresponding to charge transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and thus, displayed only one large semicircle. This was because of the lower open circuit voltages of the cells made with films soaked in dye solution for shorter times (10 to 60 min). Therefore, it was not appropriate to evaluate recombination in the cells by comparing EIS of the cells taken at different voltages (i.e. Voc which varied with dye loading). In order to compare recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface in the TiO2 films containing different amounts of dye, EIS on all these cells were taken in the dark at the same forward bias voltage (750 mV). Fig. 11 shows the Nyquist plots of DSSCs made with TiO2 films soaked in dye solution for 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 4 h and 24 h. All the cells illustrated two distinguishable semicircles representing the Pt/electrolyte and TiO2/electrolyte interfaces, which is clearly seen in the Bode phase plots (Fig. 12). The size of the second semicircle arc (TiO2/electrolyte interface) (Fig. 11) increased with dye-soaking time. In other words, the resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface increased with dye loading. The values of series resistance (Rs), Pt/electrolyte interface resistance (R1) and TiO2/electrolyte interface resistance (R2) (listed in Table 2) were determined by fitting the Nyquist plots to an equivalent circuit. Increase in R2 with dye loading confirmed reduction in recombination at TiO2/electrolyte interface, which was also evident from the reduced rate of Voc decay in the cells with increase in dye loading (Fig. 13). This reduction in recombination at TiO2/electrolyte interface resulted in continuous increase in Voc with dye soaking time.

4. Conclusions
The amount of dye in TiO2 films increased continuously with dye adsorption time while Jsc of the DSSCs increased up to 50 min of adsorption and remained unchanged for all subsequent dye-soaking times. Photoluminescence spectroscopy confirmed the absence of dye molecules existing in multilayers or physisorbed on TiO2. The TiO2 films soaked in dye solution for 50 min and for longer times showed the same light harvest, even though the amount of dye increased in these films with dye soaking time. Therefore, Jsc of these cells remained almost unchanged beyond 50 min of dye-soaking time. A certain fraction of dye molecules did not undergo photoexcitation and hence, could not contribute to the current generated by the cells. This fraction of dye molecules increased with the amount of dye in the films, because the first few layers of the film with an excess amount of dye absorbed more light, so that the amount of light reaching the layers away from the substrate decreased continuously with the amount of dye in the films. Therefore, current per mole of dye decreased with the amount of dye in the films. Electron transport rate in the films was found to depend on electron density or the number of dye molecules undergoing photoexcitation. Since light absorption in the films remained almost same after 50 min of dye adsorption, electron transport time also remained unchanged for these photoanodes. The excess amount of dye that did not contribute to Jsc, however, reduced recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, which was evident from the decreasing dark current, increasing TiO2/electrolyte interface resistance and decreasing Voc decay rate with dye loading. Hence, Voc of the DSSCs increased as a function of dye adsorption time although Jsc remained unchanged for dye-soaking times beyond 50 min.
