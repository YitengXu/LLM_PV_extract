    , Accepted 17th April 2018First published on 18th April 2018AbstractHigh purity green up-conversion (UC) materials have wide applications in fluorescent labeling, plastic recycling and displays, etc. However, Yb3+/Er3+-based UC materials exhibit poor color purity of green light, and their output color is normally unstable under a variable excitation power density, which hinders their application in the aforementioned areas. Herein, we report the highly stable and efficient pure green UC of rod-like β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals synthesized via a newly developed ion-exchange modified (IEM) method. IEM-derived NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ monodisperse submicro-crystals present not only a high-purity green output color (due to the large intensity ratio of green to red, IGreen/IRed ≈ 5) but also excellent color stability under varying conditions, such as excitation power density and doping concentration of Yb3+/Ho3+. More importantly, IEM arouses an enormously enhanced UC emission intensity of ∼3700-fold that of the precursor crystals (PC). The UC emission intensity of IEM β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ is ∼4 times stronger than that of its high temperature annealing (HTA) counterpart. The emission intensity of the single green band is ∼40% stronger than that of the IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ submicro-crystals. A proof-of-concept fluorescent labeling of clover patterns (15 × 12 mm) printed from NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ ink with stable and high purity green fluorescence is demonstrated under excitation with various power densities.
Introduction
Over the last few decades, trivalent lanthanide-activated anti-Stokes up-conversion (UC) materials, which convert low energy near-infrared (NIR) photon excitation into high energy photon emission, have been attracting increasing attention due to their wide applications in displays, solid-state lasers, phototherapy, fluorescent labels, and solar cell converters.1–11 Among them, β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-crystals have been recognized as the most efficient green UC phosphors upon excitation of a 980 nm laser diode (LD).2,7,12 Recently, β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-crystals have also been proposed as a promising alternative to β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ as an efficient green UC emitter, owing to its similar structure and low phonon energy.13,14
Yb3+/Er3+-Based UC materials show two comparable emission bands in the green (∼540 nm) and red (∼655 nm) regions, leading to low green color purity upon excitation with a 980 nm LD.15–17 For example, Guo et al. recently reported the pure red UC emission of Yb3+/Er3+-based UC materials, which was caused by the large intensity ratio of red to green.18,19 Unfortunately, the output color of Yb3+/Er3+-based UC materials strongly varies with excitation power density, due to the varying intensity ratio of green to red (IGreen/IRed).8,20–22 These features hinder their applications in many areas such as fluorescent labeling, plastic recycling and display technologies. High purity green UC emission is hard to realize for Yb3+/Er3+-based UC materials.
Yb3+/Ho3+-activated UC materials, which present similar UC emission properties to Yb3+/Er3+-activated UC materials, are an excellent alternative for obtaining efficient pure green UC emission due to the following two reasons.23–30 Firstly, they yield high purity green UC emission output color, owing to the large intensity ratio of IGreen/IRed > 4.23–30 Although there still exists a certain amount of red emission intensity, pure green output emission color can be observed owing to the rather low sensitivity of human eyes to red photons, which is ∼20 times weaker than that to green photons.31 Secondly, the pure green UC emission of the Yb3+/Ho3+ pair is highly stable under variable conditions, such as a variable excitation power density. However, they are rarely studied compared with Yb3+/Er3+-activated UC materials.32,33
In the last decade, with the fast development of various novel synthesis strategies, several novel synthesis methods for novel β-NaGdF4 micro-crystals have been proposed in the literature.34–36 In comparison with traditional high temperature solid state reaction method, the novel hydrothermal route can finely tailor the morphology and size of β-NaGdF4 micro-crystals. However, it does not exhibit the high UC emission efficiency of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ due to the poor crystallinity and high concentration of OH−. A high temperature thermal annealing (HTA) step is then required to recover the UC emission efficiency of β-NaGdF4 micro-crystals, and thus, the advantage of achieving controlled morphology and size from using the hydrothermal route is lost.37 The recovery of the intrinsic efficient UC emission for wet chemical-derived micro-crystals (such as β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+) still lacks a perfect solution. Recently, we developed a new hydrothermal ion-exchange modified (IEM) method.15–17 By applying a second additional IEM process, the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ micro-crystals not only maintain the well-controlled morphology and size of traditional hydrothermal method, but also yield a high UC emission efficiency.
In this work, we report the highly stable and efficient pure green UC emission of co-precipitation-derived β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals via an IEM method. The as-prepared precursor crystals (PC) present faint UC emission under excitation with a 980 nm LD due to the poor crystallinity and the high concentration of OH−. The IEM effectively recovers the intense pure green UC emission of the β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals. The UC emission intensity of the β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals is ∼4 times stronger than that of their HTA counterpart and is even ∼40% stronger than that of IEM β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ for a single green band. Importantly, the pure green UC emission color of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ is highly stable upon varying the doping concentration of Yb3+ and Ho3+, and varying the excitation power density, which is of great importance in achieving stable performance under different application scenarios. Proof-of-concept stable and high purity green fluorescent labeling of printed clover patterns (15 × 12 mm) is demonstrated under excitation with various power densities.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
High purity analytical Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99%), HoCl3·6H2O (99.9%), Er(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99%), NaF (99.99%), and NH4HF2 (99.99%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation and were used as raw materials without further purification.
Co-precipitation synthesis of precursor crystal (PC)
Using the co-precipitation method at 25 °C, PC β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ was synthesized. Firstly, 1590 μL 0.5 M Gd(NO3)3, 2000 μL 0.1 M Yb(NO3)3, and 100 μL 0.05 M HoCl3 lanthanide (Ln) aqueous solutions and 1310 μL deionized water were mixed. Then, 0.4199 g NaF (NaF/Ln = 10) was dissolved into 15 mL deionized water and the obtained solution was added into the Ln aqueous solution, and vigorously stirred for 75 minutes at 25 °C. Lastly, the precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Different Yb3+ (10, 15, 20 and 25 mol%) and Ho3+ (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mol%) doping concentrations were achieved by substituting Gd3+ with molar amounts. In addition, PC β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ was also synthesized in the same way to compare with the Ho3+-doped samples. The PC β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ samples were post heat treated with the HTA method at 400 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere.
Ion-exchange modification (IEM)
PC β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ (0.1281 g), NaF (0.1341 g) and NH4HF2 (0.3643 g) were added into 1.2 mL deionized water and stirred for 10 minutes. The mixed solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon bottle held in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 250 °C for 24 h. When the precipitates were cooled to 25 °C, they were separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The PC β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples with various doping concentrations and the PC β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ samples were ion-exchange modified in the same way.
Fluorescent labeling
Firstly, the synthesized IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ samples and IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ samples were dispersed into deionized water to make two kinds of UC ink. Then, two clover patterns with sizes of 15 × 12 mm were printed onto white paper with the two kinds of UC ink. Using a power-tunable circular 970 nm laser spot with a diameter of 16 mm as a pumping source, the UC emission of the macro patterns were excited with different power densities from 1.2 W cm−2 to 10 W cm−2. The UC images were captured with a Sony ILCE-6000 camera (exposure time: 1/15 s, ISO-100) under daylight.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, Japan) using Cu Kα1 radiation. The morphologies and sizes of the samples were studied using a Hitachi SU8010 (Japan) scanning electron microscope (SEM). The steady-state UC emission spectra and dynamic decay curves of the samples were recorded on a fluorescent spectrometer (Edinburgh FLSP 920, UK). A power-tunable 976 nm LD was used as the excitation source and a visible photomultiplier (PMT) detector was used to detect the signal. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected in a Thermal Scientific Nicolet 6700 (America) in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. All analyses were carried out at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and morphology

Fig. 1a shows powder XRD patterns of β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ submicro-crystals: PC, PC after ion-exchange modification (IEM) and PC after post HTA at 400 °C for 2 h. PC adopts the crystal structure of hexagonal β-NaGdF4 (space group: P (176), PDF #27-0699). Its weak diffraction intensity indicates poor crystallinity and the broad width of the diffraction peaks indicates its small crystal size, which is in agreement with the SEM image in Fig. 1b and will be discussed later.

IEM not only preserves the crystal structure of β-NaGdF4 well, but also strongly enhances the diffraction intensity of all peaks, evidencing the strongly improved crystallinity of β-NaGdF4 during IEM. Furthermore, the narrowing of the diffraction peaks of β-NaGdF4 evidences the growing crystal size of β-NaGdF4 during IEM, as illustrated by the SEM image in Fig. 1c. On the contrary, the post HTA strongly arouses the phase separation and the appearance of a large amount of a second phase of γ-GdF3 (space group: Pnma (62), PDF# 49-1804).

Fig. 1b–d present SEM images of PC, IEM and HTA β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ micro-crystals, respectively. The PC submicro-crystals in Fig. 1b are composed of gathered irregular needle-like submicro-crystals with lengths of ∼0.7 μm and widths of ∼0.1 μm. IEM leads to the growth of these gathered needle-like crystals into bigger monodisperse rod-like submicro-crystals with typical lengths of ∼0.80 μm and widths of ∼0.3 μm, as shown in Fig. 1c, which is consistent with the XRD results in Fig. 1a. These monodisperse submicro-crystals are very important for making the upconversion ink. Although the shape of our synthesized micro-crystals is not so regular and not as good as the reported popular nano-crystals,38,39 it does not affect the successful demonstration of their application for fluorescent labeling, which will be discussed later. The HTA β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals in Fig. 1d do not exhibit the monodisperse rod-like morphology of IEM β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+. They tend to agglomerate to each other and grow into bigger irregular particles.
Efficient Ho3+ UC emission: IEM versus HTA
The UC performance of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals synthesized using our IEM method was compared with those fabricated using the HTA method. Fig. 2a illustrates the UC emission spectra of PC, IEM and HTA β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals upon excitation using a 976 nm LD with a power density of 1.5 W cm−2. The UC emission spectra of the β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals are composed of three individual bands located in the green (520–560 nm), red (630–670 nm) and NIR (730–760 nm) regions with maxima at 541, 645 and 752 nm, respectively. They can be readily attributed to the 4f12 → 4f12 transitions of Ho3+: 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8 and 5S2, 5F4 → 5I7, respectively.40 As shown in the magnified spectrum in Fig. 2a, the PC sample shows a rather low UC efficiency and dominant red emission (the emission intensity of the red band is about twice as strong as that of the green band). In contrast, the green band completely dominates the UC emission spectrum for the IEM sample with intensity ratios of IGreen/IRed ≈ 5 and IGreen/INIR ≈ 2. Consequently, a high purity green output color can be observed for the IEM sample under the irradiation of the 976 nm LD due to the large intensity ratio of IGreen/IRed ≈ 5 and the weak sensitivity of human eyes in the deep red spectral region. The corresponding CIE-1931 chromaticity color coordinate of the IEM sample is determined to be (0.28, 0.71), which is located in the pure green region, as shown in Fig. 3f.

(e) 2D mapping of the UC emission intensity as a function of Yb3+ and Ho3+ concentration. (f) CIE-1931 diagram with the chromaticity color coordinate of NaGdF4:y%Yb3+,x%Ho3+ under excitation of 976 nm LD. Inset shows the image of IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ under irradiation of a 976 nm LD with a power density of 1.5 W cm−2. 
Impressively, in Fig. 2a, IEM arouses enormously enhanced UC emission intensity by ∼3700-fold. Although the HTA method also strongly improves the UC emission performance of PC, its emission intensity is ∼4 times weaker than that of IEM β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2a under the irradiation of the 976 nm LD with a power density of 1.5 W cm−2. The lower emission intensity of HTA than that of IEM β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals may be ascribed to the low phase purity of β-NaGdF4, as indicated by the XRD results in Fig. 1a. According to our previous study,16,17 the ion-exchange process is a topotactic reaction involving the migration of Na+ and F− ions from the solution into the crystal. Then, an ion-redistribution process takes place. Our previous high resolution element mapping using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for the PC and IEM β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ crystals shows that all the element distributions are more homogeneous after IEM.16 The IEM-induced enormously enhanced UC emission intensity is mainly ascribed to the improved crystallinity of β-NaGdF4 (as indicated by XRD) and reduced OH− groups (as indicated by FTIR).

Fig. 2b shows the decay curves of the UC emission of Ho3+ at 541 nm for PC, IEM and HTA β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals. The decay lifetime τ1/e (80 μs) and rise time (12 μs) of Ho3+ for PC are very short in accordance with its weak UC emission intensity. IEM leads to the strongly prolonged decay lifetime (799 μs) and rise time (995 μs) of Ho3+, both of which are about two times longer than that of HTA.

Fig. 2c shows FTIR spectra of PC, IEM and HTA β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals. For PC, the strong absorption band of OH− in 3000–3600 cm−1 can be clearly identified, indicating a high OH− concentration. Both the HTA and IEM methods can effectively reduce the OH− concentration, as evidenced by the vanishing absorption band of OH−.
The increased UC emission intensity, rise time and decay lifetime after IEM and HTA are ascribed to strongly reduced defect states. Based on our previous study,15–17 the local Ln clusters (such as Yb3+ clusters and Ho3+ clusters) and crystal structure defects (such as OH− in Fig. 2c) in PC strongly block the energy transfer process from Yb3+ to Ho3+, which results in the fast dynamic equilibrium of energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ and leads to an abnormal fast rise process and short rise lifetime. Meanwhile, these defects also cause the fast radiation relaxation rate of Ho3+ and lead to the short decay lifetime in PC. After IEM and HTA, these defects are reduced to different extents, leading to strongly enhanced UC intensity. As indicated by the XRD results (Fig. 1a), HTA arouses phase separation and low phase purity, which quenches the UC emission. Consequently, compared with IEM, the UC emission intensity is weaker, and the rise time and decay lifetime are shorter for HTA. All these results in Fig. 2 present the advantages of the IEM method for increasing the crystal quality of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals by eliminating the defects and enhancing their UC emission efficiency.
Optimum doping concentration of Ho3+ and Yb3+
IEM β-NaGdF4 submicro-crystals doped with various amounts of Ho3+ and Yb3+ were synthesized to obtain their optimal doping concentrations, to realize the strongest UC emission, as shown in Fig. 3. The optimal doping concentrations of Ho3+ and Yb3+ were determined to be 0.5 and 20 mol%, respectively, as summarized in Fig. 3e. In a low doping level regime of Ho3+ (0.2–0.5 mol%) and Yb3+ (10–20 mol%), the increase of the doping concentrations of Ho3+ and Yb3+ leads to the strongly enhanced UC emission intensity for all bands (see Fig. 3a–d). For example, the UC emission intensity of Ho3+ increases by 1.3-fold and 2-fold, when the doping concentrations of Ho3+ and Yb3+ increase from 0.2 to 0.5 mol% and from 10 to 20 mol%, respectively. This is because the concentration quenching is not so serious. More Yb3+ ions could absorb and then transfer more energy to Ho3+ ions and more Ho3+ ions mean more emission centers. The strong concentration quenching effect can be observed for the higher doping concentration of Ho3+ (>0.5 mol%) and Yb3+ (>20 mol%).41–43 With the increase in Ho3+ doping concentration, the closer distance between Ho3+ ions can cause serious cross-relaxation process. Similarly, with higher Yb3+ doping concentration, the closer distance between Yb3+ ions also induces a cross-relaxation process between them. The much simpler energy level configuration of Yb3+ compared with Ho3+ leads to different concentration quenching levels. Interestingly, the UC emission intensity ratio of IGreen/IRed only slightly changes with varying Yb3+ and Ho3+ concentration, leading to the highly stable pure green UC emission output color of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+. Consequently, the corresponding CIE-1931 chromaticity color coordinates remain constant at (0.28, 0.71) with varying Yb3+ and Ho3+ concentrations (see Fig. 3f).

Fig. 4a and b illustrate the dynamic decay curves of the green UC emission of Ho3+ (541 nm) as a function of the doping concentrations of Ho3+ (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mol%) and Yb3+ (10, 15, 20 and 25 mol%), respectively, upon excitation with a 1.5 W cm−2 976 nm LD. All decay curves follow the single exponential function. The decay profile of the green emission is composed of a rise and a decay process (see Fig. 4a and b). The existence of the rise process for the green UC emission of Ho3+ hints at the energy transfer UC mechanism of Yb3+/Ho3+ in β-NaGdF4. The UC mechanisms involved will be discussed later in detail. The decay lifetime τ1/e of the green UC emission of Ho3+ gradually decreases from 989 to 514 μs and from 1100 to 575 μs with increasing the doping concentration of Ho3+ (from 0.2 to 2.0 mol%) and Yb3+ (from 10 to 25 mol%), respectively (see Fig. 4c and d). This is ascribed to the aforementioned concentration quenching process and back energy transfer from Ho3+ to Yb3+.

Efficient Ho3+ up-conversion: Ho3+versus Er3+
In the last decade, β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ submicro-crystals have been widely investigated for their efficient green UC emission.44,45 In the present study, we synthesized β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ submicro-crystals via IEM as a reference material. β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ presents two UC emission bands in the green (peaking at 540 nm) and red (peaking at 655 nm) spectral regions, attributed to the transition of Er3+: 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (540 nm) and Er3+: 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (655 nm), respectively. The UC emission intensity of all bands of Ho3+ and Er3+ increases with increasing excitation power density. In Fig. 5b, the normalized UC emission spectra indicate the always dominant green UC emission of the IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ submicro-crystals, leading to the pure green output color. The UC emission intensity ratio of IRed/IGreen in Fig. 5e only slightly increases from 0.24 to 0.28 with a varying excitation power density of 0.68–3.44 W cm−2. The corresponding CIE-1931 color coordinates remain almost constant at (0.28, 0.71) in the pure green region with varying power density (see inset of Fig. 5e). However, the normalized UC emission spectra in Fig. 5d show that the UC emission intensity of the red band for IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ submicro-crystals shows stronger intensity than that of the green band. The emission intensity ratio of IRed/IGreen increases from 1.1 to 1.8 with increasing excitation power density from 0.68 to 3.44 W cm−2. The corresponding color coordinates shift from (0.33, 0.65) to (0.37, 0.61) and the output color varies from pure green towards yellow with increasing excitation power density, as shown in inset of Fig. 5e.

Fig. 5f shows the double logarithmic plot of the dependence of the Ho3+ (541 and 645 nm) and Er3+ (540 and 655 nm) UC emission intensities on the pump power density (0.68–3.44 W cm−2). The fitting slopes for the four UC emission bands are direct evidence of the UC photon number. The slopes of the green (2.16 ± 0.05) and red (2.27 ± 0.03) UC emissions of Ho3+ are very close to each other. Both of them are close to 2, indicating a two-photon UC emission process. In addition, their very close values leads to the aforementioned minor change of the IRed/IGreen ratio with the excitation power density. The slope of the Er3+ red (2.50 ± 0.06) UC emission is larger than that of the green (2.18 ± 0.06) UC emission, resulting in the change of the IRed/IGreen intensity ratio to a large degree from 1.1 to 1.8 with increasing excitation power density. The large fitting slope number for the Er3+ red UC emission (2.50 ± 0.06) indicates it may be a mixture of two- and three-photon UC emission processes. For the Er3+ green UC emission, the fitting slope of 2.18 ± 0.06 proves that it is a two-photon UC emission process.
UC emission mechanism
The UC emission mechanism of IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ is proposed based on our results, as shown in Fig. 6. Upon irradiation with a 976 nm LD, Yb3+ ions are excited from the ground state of 2F7/2 to the excited state of 2F5/2. The successive two-step energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ sequentially populates the Ho3+:5I6 level and then the Ho3+:5F4/5S2 level, via Ho3+:5I8 + Yb3+:2F5/2 → Ho3+:5I6 + Yb3+:2F7/2 and Ho3+:5I6 + Yb3+:2F5/2 → Ho3+:5S2 + Yb3+:2F7/2. The following relaxation from 5F4/5S2 to 5I7 and to the ground state of 5I8 gives rise to the NIR (752 nm) and green (541 nm) emissions, respectively. The large branch ratio of 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 to 5F4/5S2 → 5I7 leads to the dominant green UC emission. Both multi-phonon non-radiative relaxation processes from Ho3+:5I6 to Ho3+:5I7 and Ho3+:5S2 to Ho3+:5F5 could contribute to the red UC emission at 645 nm. For the first kind of non-radiative relaxation from Ho3+:5I6 to Ho3+:5F5, the following relaxation from 5F5 to the ground state 5I8 energy level can directly induce the red UC emission. Meanwhile, for the multi-phonon non-radiative relaxation from Ho3+:5I6 to Ho3+:5I7, the second energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+via Ho3+:5I7 + Yb3+:2F5/2 → Ho3+:5F5 + Yb3+:2F7/2 is needed to populate the Ho3+:5I7 level to the Ho3+:5F5 energy level, as shown in Fig. 6. The energy gaps (ΔE) between 5S2 and 5F5 (2850 cm−1) and 5I6 and 5I7 (3500 cm−1) are about 8 and 10 times bigger than the phonon energy of the β-NaGdF4 host (350 cm−1), respectively.46,47 According to the energy gap law, the probability of multi-phonon-assisted relaxation between these levels is low. Thus, the large energy gap between these levels leads to the weak UC emission intensity in red. In addition, the mentioned energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+via Ho3+:5I7 +Yb3+:2F5/2 → Ho3+:5F5 + Yb3+:2F7/2 is the step after the mentioned multi-phonon relaxation. Thus, its influence on the IGreen/IRred ratio when the Yb3+ concentration varies is limited by the low probability of multi-phonon relaxation between 5I6 and 5I7.

UC fluorescent labeling

Fig. 7 demonstrates the UC fluorescent labeling of IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ (top row) and IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ (bottom row) under irradiation with a 970 nm LD with varying power density from 1.2 W cm−2 to 10 W cm−2. For the top clover patterns made from IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ UC ink, the brightness of the patterns becomes stronger with increasing excitation power density. More importantly, the UC emission color is highly stable and remains pure green regardless of the excitation power density. For the bottom patterns containing IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+, the pure green color can only be observed at a low power density regime of <2.5 W cm−2. Furthermore, it gradually changes from pure green to yellow with increasing excitation power density from 1.2 to 10 W cm−2. All these results agree well with the UC emission spectra results in Fig. 5 and highlight the potential of IEM β-NaGdF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ for different practical applications.

Conclusions
We report the highly stable and efficient pure green UC emission of rod-like β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals, which were synthesized via an ion-exchange modification (IEM) method by using co-precipitation-derived β-NaGdF4 as precursor crystal (PC). PC yields faint UC emission, which is mainly attributed to the poor crystallinity (indicated by XRD) and the high concentration of OH− (evidenced by FTIR). The IEM of PC arouses the growth of PC into bigger particles and improved crystallinity, leading to a strongly enhanced UC emission intensity of 3700-fold with respect to PC. Among the three individual UC emission bands (green, red and NIR) of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+, the green band dominates the UC emission spectra for all samples, leading to a pure green output color. The optimal Ho3+ and Yb3+ doping concentrations are 0.5 mol% and 20 mol%, respectively. The UC emission intensity of the β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals is ∼4 times stronger than that of their counterpart synthesized using high-temperature annealing (HTA). Furthermore, in the single green region, the emission of the β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals is ∼40% stronger than that of IEM β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+. Importantly, the pure green UC emission color of β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ is highly stable with both the doping concentrations of Yb3+ and Ho3+ and the excitation power density, which is of great importance for stable performance under different application scenarios, as we demonstrated for the UC fluorescent labeling application. All of these results suggest that the newly developed rod-like β-NaGdF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ submicro-crystals have wide applications in fluorescent labeling, plastic recycling and display technologies, as high purity green UC emitters.
