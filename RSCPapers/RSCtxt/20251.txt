    , Accepted 13th January 2016First published on 14th January 2016AbstractTwo new two-dimension (2D)-conjugated copolymers (PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF) were designed and synthesized for the application as donor materials in polymer solar cells (PSCs) and for further investigation of the effect of alkylthio side chains on the photovoltaic performance of 2D-conjugated polymers. The two copolymers were prepared by the copolymerization of alkylthio- or alkoxy-thienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT-S or BDTT-O) and thienothiophene with carbonyl and fluorine substituents (TT-CF), and they demonstrated strong and broad absorption spectra in the wavelength region from 450 nm to ca. 800 nm. The HOMO energy level of PBDTT-S-TT-CF was further down-shifted to −5.44 eV by alkylthio substitution on thiophene conjugated side chain of BDT unit and the carbonyl and fluorine substitution on TT unit. The inverted-structured PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM exhibited a high PCE of 9.58% with a remarkably high Voc of 0.89 V and a high FF of 71.0%. The PCE of the PSCs based on PBDTT-O-TT-CF also reached a high value of 8.68% with a Voc = 0.78 V and a higher Jsc = 16.5 mA cm−2, which is benefited from the broad absorption of PBDTT-O-TT-CF. The results further confirm the unique advantages of the alkylthio side chain in the design of state-of-the-art polymer donor materials for high performance PSCs with high Voc.

Broader context
Photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been significantly improved by photovoltaic materials innovation in the past decade. Broadening the absorption and effectively tuning the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers are crucial for designing high-efficiency donor materials. In this work, a new two-dimension (2D)-conjugated polymer (PBDTT-S-TT-CF) based on alkylthio-thienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT-S) and thienothiophene with carbonyl and fluorine substituents (TT-CF) is reported. The HOMO energy level of PBDTT-S-TT-CF was further down-shifted to −5.44 eV by the alkylthio substituent on thiophene conjugated side chain of the BDT unit and the carbonyl and fluorine substitution on the TT unit. The inverted-structured PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM exhibited a high PCE of 9.58% with a remarkably high Voc of 0.89 V. The results further confirm the unique advantages of the alkylthio side chain in the design of state-of-the-art polymer donor materials for high performance PSCs with high Voc.

Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their potential advantages of low cost, light weight, and capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices.1–3 In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the design of high performance photovoltaic materials for improving photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.4–17 Ideally, the polymer donors should have a broad and strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared region to ensure effective harvesting of the solar photons for high short-circuit current density (Jsc). Furthermore, the polymers should possess a low-lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level to get a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), since Voc of bulk heterojunction PSCs is generally proportional to the gap between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the acceptor. On the other hand, suitable and matching energy levels of the donor and the acceptor are essential for efficient excitons dissociation in the photoactive layers for higher Jsc. Therefore, broadening the absorption and effectively tuning the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers are crucial for designing high-efficiency donor materials. Several strategies have been exploited to address this issue, such as alternating copolymerization of different donor (D) and acceptor (A) units, stabilizing the quinoidal structure and side chain engineering of the conjugated polymers.18–25
Very recently, we employed an easy and effective strategy to red-shift the absorption and tune the energy levels of the conjugated polymers by introducing electron-donating (alkylthio or alkoxy) substituents on the thiophene conjugated side chains of the high performance two-dimension (2D)-conjugated copolymer of benzodithiophene (BDT) and thienothiophene (TT) with electron-withdrawing ester substituents.26 The polymers PBDTT-O-TT with alkoxy substituents and PBDTT-S-TT with alkylthio substituents show red-shifted absorption. But the HOMO energy level of PBDTT-O-TT is up-shifted. Interestingly, the HOMO level of PBDTT-S-TT is down-shifted by ca. 0.1 eV, benefited from the unique π-accepting properties of the sulfur atom in the alkylthio substituent of PBDTT-S-TT.26 The lower HOMO leads to a higher Voc of 0.84 V and an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.42% for the PSCs with PBDTT-S-TT as the donor and PC70BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as the acceptor.26 On the other hand, it has been confirmed that the side chain engineering on the TT unit of PBDTTTs by using stronger electron-withdrawing carbonyl and fluorine substituents (TT-CF) down-shifted the HOMO energy level of the polymer and improved the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with the polymer PBDTTT-CF as the donor.24 For further improving the photovoltaic performance of PBDTTT-CF, here we introduced the alkylthio-thienyl or alkoxy-thienyl side chains on the BDT unit of the polymer and synthesized two new 2D-conjugated polymers PBDTT-S-TT-CF with an alkylthio-thienyl side chain and PBDTT-O-TT-CF with an alkoxy-thienyl side chain (as shown in Scheme 1). As expected, PBDTT-S-TT-CF shows a deeper HOMO level of −5.44 eV, and the PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM exhibited a higher Voc of 0.89 V and a high PCE of 9.58%. The PSCs based on PBDTT-O-TT-CF also showed a higher PCE of 8.68% with a relatively lower Voc of 0.78 V but a higher Jsc of 16.5 mA cm−2. These results further confirm that the side chain engineering of the alkylthio substituent is an effective and promising strategy in designing highly efficient polymer donor materials for PSCs.

1-(4,6-Dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one (TT-CF),24 (4,8-bis(5-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M1)25 and (4,8-bis(5-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M2)25 were synthesized by the literature methods. The polymers PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction, as shown in Scheme 1. The polymerization was carried out with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and refluxed for 14 h under argon protection. The polymers were purified by extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The polymers possess good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The molecular weight of the polymers was estimated by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) at 160 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent (as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF is 27 kDa and 19 kDa, with polydispersity (PDI) of 1.92 and 1.82, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers, and the TGA plots of the two polymers are shown in Fig. 1. PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF show good thermal stability with the decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss at approximately 373 °C and 325 °C, respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF in dilute o-dichlorobenzene solution and thin solid films. The two polymers demonstrated strong and broad absorption spectra in the wavelength region from 450 nm to ca. 800 nm. The well-defined absorption peaks both in the solution and thin films with a vibronic shoulder in the longer wavelength range imply the existence of ordered aggregation and strong π–π stacking. The absorption edge of the PBDTT-S-TT-CF film is 797 nm, corresponding to a band gap (Eg) of 1.56 eV. Benefited from the strong electron-donating effect of alkoxy side chains, the absorption edge of the PBDTT-O-TT-CF film is broadened to 816 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.52 eV. The relatively red-shifted absorption of PBDTT-O-TT-CF should be beneficial to increasing Jsc of the PSCs.

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out to estimate the electronic energy levels of the two conjugated polymers (Fig. 3). Due to the stronger electron deficiency of the TT-CF unit than that of the TT unit with ester substituents, PBDTT-S-TT-CF possesses a slightly lower HOMO energy level of −5.44 eV than that of PBDTT-S-TT (−5.41 eV),26 which should be beneficial for a further increased Voc of the PSCs with the polymer as the donor. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTT-O-TT-CF are −5.31 eV and −3.33 eV, respectively.

It is well known that the electron-donating ability of sulfur atom is weaker than that of oxygen atom. On the other hand, sulfur atom shows π-accepting properties when it connects with an unsaturated unit such as a thiophene unit,27 which makes the alkylthio side chain to show unique properties in down-shifting the HOMO energy level of the corresponding polymers.
Molecular simulation with density functional theory (DFT) was carried out to calculate the electron density distribution at the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF, as shown in Fig. 4. The electron density distributions at the LUMO of the two polymers are mainly localized on the TT unit. The HOMO of PBDTT-O-TT-CF is distributed along the entire π-conjugated backbones as well as the adjacent conjugated thiophene side chains of the BDT unit. While the HOMO surface of PBDTT-S-TT-CF is primarily delocalized along the π-conjugated backbones, there is no electron density distribution on the alkylthio-thiophene conjugated side chains. The difference of the electron density distribution of the HOMO energy levels between the two polymers confirms the π-accepting properties of the alkylthio side chain in PBDTT-S-TT-CF, which results in the down-shift of its HOMO energy level. Moreover, DFT results reveal that the introduction of alkylthio or alkoxy chains in the polymers shows nearly the same steric effect on the conformation of conjugated thiophene side chains (see the bottom plot of Fig. 4).

An inverted PSC architecture of glass/ITO/PFN (10 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) was fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two polymers.28,29 The active layer of the PSCs is composed of PBDTT-S-TT-CF or PBDTT-O-TT-CF as the donor and PC70BM as the acceptor, and it was prepared by spin-coating the blend solution of polymer:PC70BM (1:1.5, w/w) in chlorobenzene with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive. Typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are presented in Fig. 5b with the key device parameters summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, the inverted PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT showed a PCE of 9.04%, with Voc = 0.838 V, Jsc = 15.5 mA cm−2 and FF = 69.8%. Benefitted from the low-lying HOMO energy level, the device based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF exhibited a high Voc of 0.89 V, with Jsc = 15.1 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.0%, leading to a high PCE of 9.58%. The PSCs based on PBDTT-O-TT-CF demonstrated a PCE of 8.68% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 16.5 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68%. The higher Jsc is benefited from the broadened absorption, while the relatively low Voc is due to the higher HOMO energy level of PBDTT-O-TT-CF. Fig. 4b shows the absorption profiles of the blend active layers of the polymers and PC70BM. Corresponding to the broad and red-shifted absorption of PBDTT-O-TT-CF, the PBDTT-O-TT-CF:PC70BM blend film exhibits a broader and red-shifted profile as compared to the other two blend films. Meanwhile, the PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM blend film shows the strongest absorption intensity from 300 to 700 nm. Fig. 4c shows the EQE plots of the PSCs. The EQE curves cover a broad wavelength ranging from 300 to 800 nm, and the EQE values reached 60–70% in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm, demonstrating a high efficiency of light harvesting and charge carrier collection in the devices.
The crystalline properties of PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. The films were spin-coated onto a silica substrate. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† no clear lamellar diffraction signal can be observed for the PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF films. In contrast, the features of the π–π stacking can be observed in the XRD patterns of the two polymer films. The diffraction peak of the PBDTT-S-TT-CF film appears at 2θ = 21.44°, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 0.411 nm. The PBDTT-O-TT-CF film shows a similar broad diffraction signal at 2θ = 20.67°, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 0.427 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the PBDTT-S-TT-CF film. Obviously, the strong π–π stacking should be beneficial to the good photovoltaic performance of the two polymer donor materials.
High charge carrier mobility and balanced charge-carrier transport are very important for high performance photovoltaic materials in PSCs. The hole mobilities of the blend active layers and pure polymers of PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF were measured by the hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM (1:1.5, w/w) or pure polymer/MoO3/Au, and the electron mobilities of the blend active layers were measured by the electron-only device with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC70BM (1:1.5, w/w)/Al by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The blend films were processed with 3% DIO. As shown in Fig. 6, the hole mobility values of the pure PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF films are 1.71 × 10−4 and 6.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend film exhibited both a relatively high hole mobility of 1.07 × 10−4 and an electron mobility of 9.20 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the PBDTT-O-TT-CF:PC70BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend film showed a hole mobility of 1.20 × 10−5 and an electron mobility of 7.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.

The blend films were processed with 3% DIO. The fitting lines represent the best fitting using the SCLC modified Mott–Gurney model. 
In summary, we synthesized two new 2D-conjugated copolymers (PBDTT-S-TT-CF and PBDTT-O-TT-CF) of alkylthio- or alkoxy-thienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT-S or BDTT-O) and thienothiophene with carbonyl and fluorine substituents (TT-CF), for the investigation of the effect of side chain engineering on the photovoltaic performance of the polymers. The HOMO energy level of the polymer PBDTT-S-TT-CF was further down-shifted to −5.44 eV by the alkylthio substituent on the thiophene conjugated side chain of BDT unit and the carbonyl and fluorine substitution on the TT unit. The inverted-structured PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM exhibited a high PCE of 9.58% with a remarkably high Voc of 0.89 V and a high FF of 71.0%. The PCE of the PSCs based on PBDTT-O-TT-CF also reached a high value of 8.68% with a Voc = 0.78 V and a higher Jsc = 16.5 mA cm−2, which is benefited from the broad absorption of PBDTT-O-TT-CF. The results further confirm the unique advantages of alkylthio side chains in the design of state-of-the-art polymer donor materials for high performance PSCs with high Voc.
Experimental section
Material characterizations
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on Polymer Laboratories PL-GPC220 using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies Cary Series UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system in a solution of 0.1 M [Bu4N]PF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A glassy carbon disc coated with the sample film was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. A ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was used as the external standard and its redox potential is 0.47 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset of the oxidation potential of the polymers30,31 using the following equations: HOMO = −e(φox + 4.33) (eV); LUMO = −e(φred + 4.33) (eV).
Device fabrication and characterization
The inverted device structure is ITO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Al. The PFN interlayer material was dissolved in methanol in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid (2 μl ml−1) and its solution (concentration, 2 mg ml−1) was spin-coated on top of the precleaned ITO substrate, which was treated by an oxygen plasma cleaning for 4 min. The active layer, with a nominal thickness of 80–100 nm determined by a surface profiler (Alfa Step-500, Tencor), was prepared by spin-coating from a blend solution (with a total concentration of 25 mg ml−1) at 1000 rpm for 1 min. A 10 nm MoO3 layer and a 100 nm Al layer were subsequently evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area (2 × 8 mm2) of the devices and form a top anode. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under a 1 sun, AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192; 1000 W m−2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was done by a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech, Taiwan) combined with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated by standard Si solar cells.
Mobility measurement
The hole and electron mobilities were calculated by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method:32 (1)where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymers, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the characteristic field, J is the current density, and L is the thickness of the film.

Broader context
Photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been significantly improved by photovoltaic materials innovation in the past decade. Broadening the absorption and effectively tuning the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers are crucial for designing high-efficiency donor materials. In this work, a new two-dimension (2D)-conjugated polymer (PBDTT-S-TT-CF) based on alkylthio-thienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT-S) and thienothiophene with carbonyl and fluorine substituents (TT-CF) is reported. The HOMO energy level of PBDTT-S-TT-CF was further down-shifted to −5.44 eV by the alkylthio substituent on thiophene conjugated side chain of the BDT unit and the carbonyl and fluorine substitution on the TT unit. The inverted-structured PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM exhibited a high PCE of 9.58% with a remarkably high Voc of 0.89 V. The results further confirm the unique advantages of the alkylthio side chain in the design of state-of-the-art polymer donor materials for high performance PSCs with high Voc.
