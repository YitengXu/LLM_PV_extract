    , Accepted 9th September 2021First published on 15th September 2021AbstractSemiconductor photocatalysts, using sunlight to stimulate various photocatalytic reactions, are promising materials for solving the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, the low photocatalytic efficiency and high cost pose major challenges for their widespread application. Mimicking the natural photosynthesis system, we propose a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst based on a Janus van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) comprising SnC and Janus SeSnS monolayers. From first-principles calculations, the intrinsic built-in electric field of Janus SeSnS and the charge transfer from the SnC to the SeSnS layer give rise to a type-II band alignment. Such a band alignment benefits the formation of spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites and the reduction of the global bandgap of the Janus vdWH. The proposed material increases the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency to 60.8%. Besides, we also find that the light absorption coefficient is stacking configuration controllable and strain-tunable, e.g., the tensile strain promotes photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, because Sn, S, and Se are environmentally benign and inexpensive elements, SnC/SeSnS vdWH is a promising noble-metal-free direct Z-scheme photocatalyst.
Introduction
With the increasing energy crisis and environmental problems, the inexhaustible solar energy is considered one of the most sustainable and cleanest energy resources. Since Fujishima and Honda first used TiO21 as a photocatalyst in 1972 to successfully decompose water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) under ultraviolet irradiation, hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting has attracted widespread attention.2–5 However, most three-dimensional (3D) photocatalysts only absorb ultraviolet light, which accounts for less than 7% of the solar energy, due to their large bandgap. Besides, the low carrier mobility leads to high recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in inefficient sunlight usage.6 Hence, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of these existing photocatalysts is far from that required for practical application requirements. As is known, two-dimensional (2D) materials7,8 possess a large surface area-to-volume ratio and small carrier migration distance. So the sunlight absorption efficiency would be considerably enhanced on the one hand; on the other hand, the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes would be significantly suppressed.9 Recently, a large number of studies have proved that 2D semiconductors with bandgaps in the range of 1.6–3.0 eV exhibit better photocatalytic performance than bulk materials.10–18
A good photocatalyst for water splitting should possess four properties: a wide visible light absorption range, high separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, spatially separated catalytic sites, and strong redox ability. Unfortunately, a single-component semiconductor can hardly meet all of the above requirements simultaneously; a wide range of light absorption usually contradicts the strong redox ability in one material. A wider light absorption range requires a smaller bandgap which always gives rise to poorer redox ability. In turn, a bigger bandgap usually provides more opportunities to straddle the redox potentials of water to conduct a stronger redox ability but removes more long-wave parts from the light-harvesting range. To overcome this challenge, researchers have made substantial efforts to propose and design new multi-component photocatalysts.19–23 Among them, a van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) of a 2D material, such as vdWH including graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), is considered to be an emerging material in photocatalysis.24 Due to the weak interlayer vdW interactions, the constituents preserve their electronic structures with some shifts in energy with respect to those of individual layers, leading to a type-II band alignment.25 In the vdWHs with this unique band alignment, the photogenerated electrons and holes are transferred along distinct paths in separate layers. Hence, they could act as direct Z-scheme photocatalysts, like in natural photosynthesis in green plants,26–28 which possess an efficient charge separation via specific paths and maintain stronger capabilities of reduction and oxidation than those of individual constituents. As expected, the optimized catalytic activities have been experimentally observed in a number of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts. However, only several 2D material-based direct Z-scheme photocatalysts have been reported.29–34
Fabricating vdWH with Janus TMDs in which the metal atoms are covalently bonded to different chalcogen atoms on each side, such as MoSSe35 and WSSe,36 is a promising way to achieve direct Z-scheme photocatalysts. Structural symmetry breaking of Janus monolayers leads to an intrinsic out-of-plane electric polarization, generating an intrinsic built-in electric field. It brings out many exotic properties, including adjustable electronic structures,37 broadened light adsorption spectrum,38 controllable contact resistance,39 and sufficient redox potential.40 Engineering the stacking manners of monolayers in Janus vdWH can modulate the effective interlayer electric field determined by combining the intrinsic electric field of Janus TMDs and the charge transfer, thereby realizing direct Z-scheme photocatalysts.
With environmentally benign deposits on earth, tin-based monolayers, such as stanene, SnC, SnS2, SnSSe, etc., have recently been extensively explored as environment-friendly and inexpensive materials. They are expected to provide room-temperature nontrivial topology, superconductivity, high mobility of holes, high absorption coefficient in the visible light region, and strain engineering.41–49 Nevertheless, an in-depth investigation of the photocatalytic water splitting based on vdWHs of SnC/SnSSe is still lacking. In this article, we propose that the Janus SnC/SnSSe vdWH merges the unique properties of the 2D materials and the Janus monolayer, achieving the features of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts. Thus, it could serve as a noble-metal-free, economical, and highly efficient photocatalyst for water splitting. We make a systematic study of their stability, electronic structures, optical properties, stacking configuration, and strain tunability of photocatalytic performance, using first-principles calculations.
Computational methods
All calculations are performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)50 with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) based on density functional theory (DFT). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)51 scheme within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to deal with the exchange–correlation interaction of electrons. Because the PBE functional underestimates the semiconductor bandgap, we adopt the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) and GW methods based on the many-body Green's function theory in the simulations of electrical and optical characteristics.52,53 The GW method can provide relatively accurate band structures; however, its computational cost is much more expensive than those of the HSE and PBE methods. The HSE method with reasonable mixing parameters is widely adopted to give acceptable energy band edges which are always in good accordance with experimental dates.17,54–56 Therefore, we majorly perform the calculations by the HSE method for band alignments in this work, and we also use the GW approximation together with the Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW + BSE) to examine the screening and excitonic effects on optical absorption.57 The empirical correction scheme of the DFT-D358 approach within the Grimme scheme is adopted for the nontrivial vdW interactions. The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave expansion is set to 500 eV. The convergence tolerance for energy and the residual force on each atom during structural relaxation are set to 10−5 eV and −0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. A Γ-centered 15 × 15 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh is used for Brillouin zone sampling. To avoid the interaction between neighboring layers and their periodic impact, a vacuum spacing of greater than 20 Å is applied. Besides, dipole correction is employed to describe the possible charge redistribution in these polar systems and eliminate the errors of electrostatic potential, caused by periodic boundary conditions.59,60 The phonon calculations are carried out using the PHONOPY code.61Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are carried out in the canonical ensemble using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat.62,63 The simulation is carried out on 5 × 5 × 1 supercells of heterostructure heated up to 300 K for 10 ps in a time step of 2 fs, and the constraints on the system symmetry are cancelled.
Results and discussion
Geometrical structures
Firstly, let us consider the geometric structures, stabilities, and electronic properties of the SnC and Janus SnSSe monolayers, as well as their vdWHs. After geometrical optimization, the lattice constants of SnC and Janus SnSSe monolayers become 3.60 Å and 3.76 Å (see Table 1), respectively, in good agreement with the results of the literature.46,64 As shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), both the SnC and SnSSe monolayers share the same lattice type (the hexagonal lattice) with comparable lattice constants. This indicates the remarkable feasibility of the experimental preparation of the heterostructures. Based on the above information, we propose the heterostructures formed by placing the Janus SnSSe on top of the SnC monolayer. The stacking manner of the Janus 2D vdWHs is critical to their performance. Because the two species of chalcogen S and Se atoms are on either side of Janus SnSSe, two different stacking configurations, labeled as SnC/SeSnS vdWH and SnC/SSnSe vdWH, respectively, are conceived, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) and (d). We have imposed a commensurability condition between the SnC and SnSSe monolayers, where a 1 × 1 lateral periodicity is employed for both SnC and SnSSe, with an optimized lattice constant of 3.67 Å. To minimize lattice strain, the heterostructures are completely relaxed. As shown in Table S1 in the ESI,† the lattice mismatch between the two layers is less than 2.45%. The intrinsic strain effects on the electronic properties are small and can be neglected. So the stacking is feasible in practice. The optimized interlayer distances for the SnC/SeSnS and SnC/SSnSe vdWHs are equal to 3.27 Å and 3.07 Å, respectively.

 Fig. 1  Top (left) and side (right) views of fully optimized structures of (a) SnC, (b) SnSSe, (c) SnC/SeSnS vdWH, and (d) SnC/SSnSe vdWH. The orange dashed rhombuses show the unit cells of the monolayers. For two Janus vdWHs stacking configurations, the supercells (3 × 3) are exhibited. Interlayer distances, d, are indicated by the red double-headed arrows. The brown, violet, yellow, and green spheres represent C, Sn, S, and Se atoms, respectively. 
Secondly, let us move our attention to evaluate the energetic stability of the systems by calculating the binding energy, defined by Eb = (Eheterostructure − ESnC − ESnSSe)/N(1)where Eheterostructure, ESnC, and ESnSSe represent the total energies of the stacked SnC/SnSSe vdWH, SnC and SnSSe monolayers, respectively. N is the number of atoms in vdWH. According to the definition, the vdWH with a negative Eb is energetically stable. Hence, both SnC/SeSnS (−49.83 meV per atom) and SnC/SSnSe (−53.91 meV per atom) vdWHs are stable (see Table 1). Interestingly, each of these two configurations hosts a larger binding energy than that of bilayer graphene (−27.08 meV per atom),65 suggesting that they are more stable than the latter. In addition, the values of the binding energy and interlayer distance demonstrate that the interaction between SnC and SnSSe monolayers is the vdW force. Moreover, to verify the dynamic stability of the Janus vdWHs, the vibrational phonon spectra are also computed, as displayed in Fig. S1(a) and (b) (ESI†). The absence of imaginary phonon mode in the entire Brillouin zone hints that the vdWHs are dynamically stable. Eventually, we also performed AIMD to clarify the thermal stability at 300 K (shown in Fig. S1(c) and (d), ESI†). The total energy and temperature are around constant values with very tiny fluctuations, implying that the SnC/SnSSe vdWHs are thermodynamically stable. In addition, snapshots of atomic configurations of vdWHs at the end of AIMD calculations are presented as insets. This shows that there are no bonds broken or structural reconfiguration after annealing the system at 300 K for 10 ps, further demonstrating the robust thermal stability of SnC/SnSSe vdWHs at room temperature.
Electronic structures
The band structures of the Janus vdWHs of the SnC and SnSSe monolayers are calculated using the HSE06 functional as shown in Fig. 2, while the corresponding results of two individual SnC and SnSSe monolayers based on the PBE (HSE06) functional are shown in Fig. S2 (S3) (ESI†). Notice that the dispersion of the band structures obtained by PBE functional exhibits a similar profile to that of HSE06 in both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). Both SnC and SnSSe have indirect band gaps whose values are 1.80 and 1.69 eV, respectively. Hence, they absorb the visible light irradiation. Because the electron–hole recombination is only possible in the phonon involved processes, the photogenerated carriers possess long lifetimes. Note that the SnC/SnSSe vdWHs also exhibit indirect bandgaps smaller than those of their constituent SnC and SnSSe monolayers, e.g., 0.64 eV for SnC/SeSnS and 0.58 eV for SnC/SSnSe. We attribute this to the synergistic effect of the intrinsic built-in electric field and the quantum confinement effect.

The partial charge density distributions of the CBM (cyan) and VBM (yellow) are shown in insets, where the isosurface value is set to be 0.005 e Å−3. The plane-averaged differential charge density Δρ(z) along the vertical direction of the (c) SnC/SeSnS and (d) SnC/SSnSe vdWHs, respectively. 
To unveil the electronic properties of the vdWHs, we plot the layer projected energy bands and density of states (PDOS) at the HSE06 level in Fig. 2(a) and (b). We observe that in both stacking configurations, the CBM and VBM stem from the different layers. Namely, the former originates from the SeSnS (SSnSe) layer, while the SnC layer contributes to the latter. Hence, both vdWHs host type-II band alignments, which are beneficial for separating photogenerated electrons and holes. It promises high-efficiency photocatalysis. In the insets, we plot the partial charge distribution of VBM and CBM. The states of VBM (CBM) reside mainly on the SnC (SnSSe) layer, which coincides with the above analysis of the projected bands and PDOS. As a result, the type-II band alignment benefits the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes to suppress recombinations of these carriers, facilitating the application of these vdWHs in photocatalytic water splitting.
To gain a deeper insight into the charge transfer across the heterostructure, we calculate the charge redistributions at the SnC/SeSnS and SnC/SSnSe interfaces, which can be visualized by the position-dependent charge density difference: (2)where ρSnSSe/SnC(x,y,z), ρSnSSe(x,y,z), and ρSnC(x,y,z) are the charge densities at the position (x,y,z) in the same unit cells containing a SnSSe/SnC vdWH, and individual SnSSe and SnC layers unit cells, respectively. Here positive values of Δρ(z) areas highlight the regions of charge accumulation (red area), whereas negative values of Δρ(z) areas mark the regions of charge depletion (blue area). As demonstrated in Fig. 2(c) and (d), the nonzero difference depicts that the electrons transfer from the SnC layer to the SnSSe layer across the interface, thus leaving the holes on the SnC side. Therefore, an interfacial built-in electric field is formed in the heterostructure. These small charge transfers along with weak binding energy manifest that the interaction between SnC and SeSnS is not strong. Quantitatively, Bader charge analysis66,67 is performed to further understand the interlayer charge transfer process, as shown in Table 1, transferring 0.058 (0.099) electrons from the SnC layer to the SeSnS (SSnSe) layer.
To secure a deeper insight into the intrinsic built-in electric field, we have plotted the vertical-direction plane-averaged electrostatic potential distribution, as shown in Fig. 3. In SnSSe, the electronegativity difference between S and Se gives rise to an intrinsic dipole of 0.105 Debye, which generates an intrinsic built-in electric field (denoted by ESnSSe) pointing from the Se sublayer to the S sublayer in monolayer SnSSe. Such ESnSSe leads to a separation of electrons and holes and induces an electrostatic potential difference of about 0.345 eV between the S and Se surfaces, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). On the other hand, the difference in work functions of SnC and SnSSe drives the electrons to move from the SnC layer with a smaller work function to the SnSSe layer. Thereby the charge rearrangement leads to a polarization of the electrons and an interface dipole, which generates an interfacial built-in electric field, represented by Eint, pointing from the SnC surface to the SnSSe surface.
 Fig. 3  Plane-averaged electrostatic potential along the out-of-plane direction for (a) SnC, (b) SnSSe, (c) SnC/SeSnS vdWH, and (d) SnC/SSnSe vdWH. The arrows in the lower panel represent the schematic composition of the electric field. The insets are the zoom-in views of the electrostatic potential differences around z = 15 Å. ESnSSe, Eint, and Eeff represent the intrinsic electric field of SnSSe, the charge-transfer induced interfacial electric field, and the net effective electric field across the vdWH, respectively. 
We find that different surface contact leads to different electrostatic potential and dipole moment directions. For 2D Janus vdWHs, the ESnSSe direction (parallel and antiparallel to the Eint direction) may cause different net effective electric fields (denoted by Eeff). The SnC/SeSnS vdWH has a large dipole moment of 0.117 Debye pointing from the SnC layer to the SeSnS layer, because the intrinsic electric field in the SeSnS monolayer is in parallel to the interfacial built-in electric field. In contrast, the SnC/SSnSe vdWH has a small dipole moment of −0.016 Debye, pointing from the SSnSe layer to the SnC layer. This is attributed to the cancellation between the charge-transfer induced interfacial electric field and the intrinsic electric field in SnSSe. Hence, the SnC/SeSnS vdWH forms a stronger plane-averaged electrostatic potential at the interface region, resulting in a remarkable net effective electric field, Eeff, pointing to the SeSnS layer from the SnC layer. As a result, the electrostatic potential of the SnC layer is 0.386 eV lower than that of the SeSnS layer, as shown in Fig. 3(c). In contrast, SnC/SSnSe vdWH hosts a weak plane-averaged electrostatic potential at the interface region, resulting in a smaller Eeff pointing from the SSnSe to the SnC layer. Consequently, the electrostatic potential of the SSnSe layer is slightly lower (about 0.051 eV) than that of SnC, as shown in Fig. 3(d).
Interaction with absorbed water molecules
Since Eeff influences water splitting processes, there should be a considerable difference between the electrostatic potential environments of the water molecules in the neighboring top and bottom layers, respectively. The PDOS of one water molecule and a layer of water molecules adsorbed on both the SnC and SeSnS layers of the vdWH are depicted in Fig. 4. Clearly, Eeff points from the SnC layer to the SeSnS layer. Thus, the energy level of the water molecule on the SeSnS layer is higher than that of the water molecule on the SnC layer. Similar behavior is also expected for the case of a water layer on both the SnC and SeSnS layers. Therefore, the water molecules adsorbed on the two layers of the SnC/SeSnS vdWH experience indeed distinguishing electrostatic potential shifts, caused by Eeff, the different vacuum levels of the water molecules adsorbed on the opposite layers of the vdWH, effectively resulting in the different water oxidation (H2O/O2) and hydrogen reduction potentials (H+/H2) between the two sides of the vdWH, where the intrinsic built-in electric field effect (ΔΦ) is involved.

(b) Same as (a) except for more water molecules on both surfaces of the vdWH. 
Band alignment
The band alignment of the heterostructure plays a crucial role in functional material engineering and electronic device design. To gain a deeper understanding of the band alignment of the SnC/SnSSe vdWHs, we examine the band edges of the SnC and SnSSe layers relative to the vacuum levels before and after the formation of the vdWH at the HSE06 level. Using the vacuum level as a common energy reference, the oxidation and reduction potentials of water splitting are −5.67 and −4.44 eV at pH = 0, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the CBM of an individual SnC is higher than the reduction potential (H+/H2), the VBM is not lower than the oxidation potential (H2O/O2), indicating that the SnC monolayer is only capable of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The situation for an individual SnSSe monolayer is the opposite. Therefore, it only has the activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This demonstrates that neither SnC nor SnSSe alone can achieve overall water splitting. The work function of the surface is a crucial parameter in the investigation of the charge transfer of the interface and the band alignment of the semiconductor. Herein, we calculate the work functions of the individual SnC and SnSSe monolayers by the equation: W = Evac − EF, where EF is the Fermi energy, and Evac is the vacuum level. The work functions of the SnC and SnSSe monolayers are 4.94 and 6.86 eV, respectively (shown in Table 1). Since CBM and VBM of SnC are higher than those of SnSSe, and the work function is smaller than that of SnSSe, when they are in contact, the electrons flow from the SnC to the SnSSe monolayer until the Fermi levels are aligned in an equilibrium state governed by Anderson's rules.68 The spontaneous interfacial charge transfer will further lead to the formation of an interfacial electric field Eint, pointing from the SnC layer to the SnSSe layer, which gradually saturates electrons and holes and eventually achieves a balance with the diffusion force.

The kinetic overpotentials of the hydrogen evolution reaction ΔEC (eV) and the oxygen evolution reaction ΔEV (eV). 
Based on the above analysis, we then take the SnC/SeSnS vdWH as an example to illustrate the schematic diagram of the charge transfer process upon light illumination, as shown in Fig. 5(b). With the transfer of electrons from SnC to SeSnS and the electrostatic induction effect, the SnC and SeSnS layers respectively accumulate positive and negative charges. Therefore, the direction of Eint is the same as that of ESnSSe, and the effective field Eeff is the sum of quantities of Eint and ESnSSe. Then, the electrons transfer from the SnC layer to the SeSnS layer and repel further charge transfer, which will cause the energy band of the SnC layer to bend upward, and the energy band of the SeSnS layer to bend downward at the interface. The upward bending of the CBM of SnC creates a potential barrier.69 Under photon excitation, both SnC and SeSnS layers are excited to generate photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
In general, there are three charge-transfer paths for photo-excited carriers, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Path-1 is the recombination of electrons from CBM of SeSnS and holes from VBM of SnC marked by the red dashed line with double-head arrows, Path-2 is the recombination of electrons from CBM of SnC and holes from VBM of SeSnS indicated by the cyan curved dashed lines with arrows. And Path-3 is that electrons (holes) at CBM (VBM) of SnC (SeSnS) flow to CBM (VBM) of SeSnS (SnC) represented by the blue curved dashed lines with arrows. It is noticed that the potential barrier and the net effective electric field hamper the migration of photogenerated electrons from the CB of SnC to that of SeSnS. A similar event occurs for photocreated holes when they move from the SeSnS layer to the side of SnC, i.e., Path-3 is inhibited. Besides, Path-2 is also suppressed because the recombination between electrons in the CB of the SnC and holes in the VB of the SeSnS is strongly hindered by net effective electric field together with the potential barrier. In contrast, the band bending jointing with the net effective electric field favors the recombination of the photogenerated electrons in the CB of SeSnS and the holes in the VB of SnC. Hence, Path-1 is feasible, which implies the high concentration and lifetime of the photogenerated electrons (holes) in the CB (VB) of SnC (SeSnS).
Furthermore, according to the reaction mechanism proposed by J. L. Yang et al.70 ΔΦ can decrease the oxidation and reduction potentials. For the SnC/SeSnS vdWH, the vacuum level and the oxidation and reduction potentials of the SnC layer decrease by ΔΦ = 0.386 eV compared to those of SeSnS. As a result, the energy difference between the reduction potential of SnC and the oxidation potential of SeSnS in the SnC/SeSnS vdWH is decreased to ΔE = 1.23 eV − ΔΦ. According to the photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions (3)where the two half processes occur separately on two different monolayers, respectively. Precisely, as seen in Fig. 5(c), the appropriate energy band edge (obtained using the HSE06 functional) and the net effective electric field of the SnC/SeSnS vdWH meet the requirement of the photocatalytic overall water splitting and facilitate the realization of the direct Z-scheme mechanism. The reduction reaction occurs in the CB of SnC, because its energy is much higher than the reduction potential (H+/H2). Meanwhile, the oxidation reaction occurs at the VB of SeSnS because it is lower in energy than the oxidation potential (H2O/O2). Clearly, SnC/SeSnS vdWH has relatively large kinetic overpotentials (i.e., ΔEV = 0.98 eV, ΔEC = 0.45 eV) for driving the redox reaction. Thus, the SnC/SeSnS vdWH can act as a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst to decompose water into H2 and O2.
For the SnC/SSnSe case, due to the opposite directions of Eint and ESnSSe, the net effective field Eeff of the SnC/SSnSe vdWH, pointing from the SSnSe to SnC, is relatively weak. Therefore, it promotes the transfer of photogenerated electrons (holes) from the SnC (SSnSe) layer to the SSnSe (SnC) layer, leading to the aggregation of electrons in the SSnSe layer and holes in the SnC layer, as shown in Fig. 5(d). However, according to the band edge position, it is found that the SSnSe does not satisfy the hydrogen production conditions, and the SnC/SSnSe vdWH is not a good photocatalyst material. Hence, the photocatalytic performance depends strongly on the stacking configuration of the vdWH. Thus, solar energy utilization efficiency can be effectively improved by a suitable choice of stacking configuration.
Solar-to-hydrogen conversion
In addition, we have also evaluated the solar energy conversion efficiency of the SnC monolayer and SnC/SeSnS vdWH. High energy conversion efficiency is the goal of using solar energy for photocatalytic water decomposition. Therefore, the STH efficiency ηSTH, defined as the product of the light absorption efficiency (ηabs) and carrier utilization efficiency (ηcu),71i.e., ηSTH = ηabs × ηcu, is a crucial factor in determining the catalytic performance of photocatalysts. The ηabs is obtained from the following expression, (4)where Eg is the bandgap of the photocatalysts, and P(ħω) is the AM1.5G solar flux at the photon energy ħω. The denominator is the total power density of the incident simulative sunlight and the numerator is the optical power density absorbed by the photocatalyst. On the other side, the ηcu is calculated by (5)where ΔG is the potential difference of 1.23 eV for water splitting and E is the minimum energy of photons that can be utilized for water splitting. Taking into account the energy loss during carrier migration between different materials, the kinetic overpotentials where ΔEC (ΔEV) is defined as the energy difference between the CBM (VBM) and the water reduction (oxidation) potential (see Fig. 5(c)) required for HER and OER are assumed to be 0.2 and 0.6 eV, respectively. Then E is determined by the following conditions: (6)considering the effect of the net effective electric field on the electron–hole separation during the photocatalytic water splitting, we adopt the following correction (in eqn (7)) to the STH efficiency of the photocatalytic water splitting: (7)where ΔΦ is the electrostatic potential difference between the SnC and SeSnS layers.
Then, in the idealized case, in which the light absorption efficiency, carrier separation efficiency, and quantum efficiency are supposed to be 100%, the STH efficiencies equal 24.2% and 75.1% for the SnC monolayer and SnC/SeSnS vdWH, respectively. In Table 2, we find that the corrected STH efficiencies of the SnC monolayer and SnC/SeSnS vdWH are 24.2% and 60.8%, respectively. It is also noteworthy that the STH efficiency of the SnC/SeSnS vdWH is not only significantly enhanced compared to that of their constituent pristine monolayer SnC, but also higher than other vdWHs, e.g., MoSe2/SnSe2 (10.5%), WSe2/SnSe2 (9.3%),72 and PtS2/arsenene (49.32%),73etc. Therefore, the SnC/SeSnS vdWH is a promising photocatalyst.

Light absorption
To obtain high-efficiency photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices, active materials must be able to efficiently absorb solar energy in the visible and even in near-infrared regions, where most of the wavelengths of light can reach the earth's surface.74 As the electron–hole Coulomb interactions (exciton effect) play important roles in the optical absorption coefficient, α(ω), we applied the GW + BSE method to evaluate the optical performance16 by the following expression:75 (8)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. ε2(ω) is obtained by the summation of the Bloch states according to the following equation:76 (9)where α and β refer to the x and y directions, and Ω represents the volume of the unit cell. c and v stand for the conduction and valence bands, respectively, and μik is the eigenstate of the i-th band with wave vector k. With the ε2(ω) at hand, the real part of the dielectric tensor ε1(ω) can be derived straightforwardly by using the Kramers–Kronig relationship. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6. For comparison purposes, the light absorption coefficients of the SnC, SnSSe monolayers, and their vdWHs are calculated together. Note that the peaks of ε2(ω) coincide with that of the absorption coefficient. The SnC and SnSSe monolayers have a broad range of optical absorption, from the visible to ultraviolet, with an optical absorption intensity of up to 105. Notably, the optical absorption ranges of the heterostructures from the ultraviolet are extended into an infrared region, as shown by the red curves in Fig. 6. Besides, their absorption intensities are remarkably enhanced compared to those of the individual monolayers, especially in the visible light region. Furthermore, we also employ the HSE method to compare the results, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is found that the redshift appears in the GW + BSE method compared with that of the HSE method. This can be ascribed to the fact that the exciton effect in vdWHs is rather strong, which contributes to the redshift of optical absorption. This prominent extension of absorption range and absorption enhancement indicates that the sunlight utilization of the heterostructure is much higher than that of its constituents, i.e., SnC and SnSSe monolayers. It is attributed to the charge transfer and interlayer coupling, i.e., the overlap of the electronic states between the two layers, which allows electron excitation between them. Therefore, the high STH efficiency together with the optimized optical absorption makes the SnC/SeSnS vdWH a promising candidate photocatalyst for overall water splitting even in the near-infrared light region.

Strain engineering for light absorption
Because of outstanding in-plane mechanical properties and strong charge–strain interactions of 2D materials, strains may noticeably affect the optical properties of 2D materials. Thus, it is crucial to gain insights into the electronic and optical properties of SnC/SnSSe vdWHs in response to biaxial strains (compressive and tensile strain). We apply small biaxial strains (−4% ≤ ε ≤ 4%) to the heterostructures. The lattice parameters are kept constant during the structural optimization to simulate the strains. In-plane strain is imposed by the biaxial stretching of the hexagonal cell. The biaxial strain is defined as η = [(l − l0)/l0] × 100%, where l0 is the lattice constant of the SnC/SnSSe vdWH in its equilibrium state and l is the strained lattice parameter. Tensile strains are positive, and conversely, compressive strains are negative. The main characteristics of the band structure of the vdWH change slightly with strain. In Fig. 7, we show the optical absorption coefficients of SnC/SnSSe vdWHs with a series of different biaxial strains. One can see that the light absorption spectra are redshifted under tensile strain, and in contrast, blueshifted under compressive strain in SnC/SeSnS vdWH. Similar behaviors also appear in the SnC/SSnSe vdWH. Consequently, one can enhance the optical response to sunlight in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction of SnC/SnSSe vdWHs by tensile strains.

Conclusions
We propose an intriguing direct Z-scheme photocatalyst based on the Janus vdWHs of SnC/SnSSe, mimicking the natural photosynthesis system. First-principles calculations illustrate that the Janus vdWHs of SnC/SnSSe possess type-II band alignments, which benefit the photocatalytic performance. On the one hand, the difference in electronegativity between S and Se atoms, i.e., the polarity of Janus SnSSe, gives rise to a built-in electric field; on the other hand, the distinction of the work function between two SnC and SnSSe leads to a charge transfer from the former to the latter. The competition between these two processes results in stacking configuration-dependent photocatalysis. We demonstrate that the SnC/SeSnS is an intriguing direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting with STH efficiency up to 60.8%. Interestingly, its performance can be further enhanced by a stretch strain. Our findings could provide some guidance for designing new heterostructures with high-efficiency photocatalytic properties and enlarge the potential applications of the Janus vdWHs in optoelectronic devices.
