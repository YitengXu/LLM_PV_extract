    , Accepted 3rd August 2021First published on 4th August 2021AbstractSelenophene substitution of photovoltaics materials can improve their intermolecular interactions and thus offer a good opportunity to finely optimize their phase separation morphology to an ideal state. However, the performance of this substitution strategy is yet unclear in liquid crystalline donors, which have demonstrated high efficiency. The combination of those structural advantages may help to achieve state-of-the-art device performance. Herein, two new liquid crystalline small molecule donors are designed and synthesized with different substituents on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) central units, including L1 with thiophene group and L2 with selenophene group, for investigating the effect of selenophene substitution on morphology and photovoltaic performance of liquid crystalline donors. Unlike the control donor L1, the selenide donor L2 shows a higher intramolecular interaction and presents a novel sematic liquid crystal phase, which results in a more favored morphology, better light harvest, and lower charge recombination. As a result, outstanding power conversion efficiency up to 15.8% is realized in the L2:Y6 based devices. Particularly promising is the fact that selenide-based devices with active layer thicknesses up to ∼300 nm can still output a high PCE of 14.3%, which is promising for roll-to-roll printing processes with large-scale production. To our best knowledge, the PCEs of 15.8% and 14.3% are the highest values reported to date in binary ASM-OSCs and thick-film ASM-OSCs, respectively. These excellent values demonstrated the superiority of selenophene in the construction of efficient small molecule liquid crystalline donors.

Broader context
The efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) has rapidly climbed up after the discovery of efficient non-fullerene acceptors. However, in most cases, the applied polymer donors suffer from batch-to-batch variations and low reproducibility in device performance, which seems to be the last obstacle for this technology towards commercialization. Compared with polymers, small molecules are more promising for commercial application in OSCs because they have well-defined chemical structures and higher reproducibility. Nevertheless, manipulating the morphology of small molecules to achieve ideal phase separation is full of challenges. Herein, the selenophene substitution strategy is proposed to enhance the intramolecular interaction of small molecule donors and optimize their phase separation morphology to an ideal state, finally contributing to an outstanding PCE of 15.8% for binary ASM-OSCs.

Introduction
As a promising next-generation photovoltaic technology, bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have desirable advantages in that they are lightweight and potentially cost-effective, with flexibility and high-throughput fabrication.1–3 Power conversion efficiency (PCE), as the most significant parameter of OSCs, is mainly determined by the technology of both photoactive material design and device engineering. Over the past few years, the innovation of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), such as ITIC and Y6 series, not only overcame the shortcomings of fullerene derivatives (i.e., non-tunable energy levels and weak absorption in the visible region), but also advanced the PCE of OSCs up to a new stage.4–8 Recently, OSCs with polymers as donors and Y6 as acceptor in the active layer have achieved excellent efficiencies over 18% in both single-junction and tandem devices, showing a great promising future for commercial applications.9,10 Compared with polymers, small molecules seem to be more promising due to their advantages of high purity, well-defined molecular structures, and high reproducibility in OSCs.11–14 However, the PCEs of small molecule donors still lag behind their polymer-based counterparts and are more sensitive to film thickness due to their restricted electron delocalization. State-of-the-art binary all small-molecule OSCs could only reach an efficiency of 15.3% (obtained by Hou group), using a small-molecule donor B1 and a small-molecule non-fullerene acceptor BO-4Cl.15 For thick-film ASM-OSCs, the champion efficiency is only 13.63%,16 which is lower than the highest reported PCE (16.32%) of thick-film (≥300 nm) polymer solar cells.17 The ASM-OSCs with comparatively lower PCEs are generally limited due to their relative lower fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (JSC), which is mainly rooted from the phase separation morphology of the active layer. Typically, ideal phase separation morphology means reasonable molecular crystallinity and a large correlation scale, which favors exciton separation and charge transport. Intermolecular interactions play an important role in tuning the molecular packing and crystallinity, thus affecting the film morphology.
Benefitting from strong intermolecular interactions, liquid crystalline molecules have the potential to realize favorable phase separation with a long-ranged continuously interpenetrating network. Consequently, high fill factor and device efficiency can be achieved in liquid crystal donor-based ASM-OSCs. The first example in which liquid crystalline materials are used for high-performance OSCs is benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR), which works very well with fullerene acceptors in binary single-junction OSCs to afford an efficiency of 9.3%.18 Subsequently, two liquid crystalline donors, NDT-3T-R4 and NDT-3T-R6, were developed by the Wei group to match the efficient non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor IDIC-4F, which revealed high PCEs of 9.21% and 10.70% for binary ASM OSCs.19 Most recently, we reported a novel liquid crystalline donor BTR-Cl through substituting an alkyl side chain with a chlorine (Cl) atom on the BTR molecule, demonstrating an outstanding efficiency of 13.6%.20 However, all these reported liquid crystalline donors present a nematic phase, and the effects of the crystalline phase of liquid crystal donors on their phase separation morphology and photovoltaics performances are seldom discussed.
Replacement of the thiophene group by the selenophene group affords a good chance to improve the intermolecular interactions through the π–π stacking by overlapping large π orbital of selenium atom.21–24 Combined with the self-organization advantages of liquid crystal donors, selenophene substitution strategy may provide an interesting chance to optimize the intermolecular interactions and molecular crystallinity, thus promoting blend film morphology and power conversion efficiency in ASM OSCs. Notwithstanding that the selenophene substitution strategy has been reported many times in polymer donor systems and proved to be an effective structure modification method,25–27 the effect of selenophene substitution still remains unclear in small molecule donors, especially in liquid crystalline donors.
Inspired by these speculations, we designed and synthesized two small molecule (SM) donors L1 and L2, with BDT as the central donor core, trithiophene as π bridge, and 3-hexylrhodanine as an electron-withdrawing end group. The main difference between L1 and L2 is in the conjugated side chain of BDT. The conjugated side chain of L1 is thiophene with trialkylsilyl, whereas L2 is selenophene with the same silane side chain (as shown in Fig. S12, ESI†). Compared with L1 (nematic phase), the selenide donor L2 shows higher intramolecular interaction and presents sematic liquid crystal phase, which results in a more favored morphology. The photovoltaic performance of the device is investigated by fabricating ASM-OSCs with L1 or L2 as the donor and Y6 as acceptor. After careful optimization, the reference device L1:Y6 attained a PCE of 14.6%, nevertheless, the L2:Y6 based device produced an excellent PCE of 15.8%. In particular, even when the film thickness of the L2:Y6 blend is up to ∼300 nm, ASM OSCs can still generate a decent PCE of 14.3%, which is outstripping the currently reported thick film (≥300 nm) OSCs. To our best knowledge, the PCEs of 15.8% and 14.3% are the highest values reported to date for binary ASM-OSCs and thick-film ASM-OSCs, respectively.28–30
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterizations
The chemical structures of L1 and L2 are shown in Fig. 1A, and the detailed synthesis routes are summarized in ESI.† Intermediates and target products are fully verified via1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high resolution mass spectrum. Both donors show good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), dichloromethane (DCM), toluene, chlorobenzene (CB), etc. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method is employed to investigate the HOMO energy levels of L1 and L2 with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as the internal calibration (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of L1 and L2 are calculated to be −5.32 eV/−3.51 eV and −5.33 eV/−3.53 eV, respectively. Obviously, selenophene-substituted L2 shows a slightly deeper HOMO level than that of thiophene-substituted L1, which is consistent with previous results reported by Yang group.22 The HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO) between the two donors and Y6 (≈0.32 eV) is enough for the charge separation of the excitons.

To evaluate the influence of the selenophene substitution on optical absorption, normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of L1 and L2 are carried out in solution and thin film states (Fig. 1C). Both materials exhibited almost identical absorption spectra In chloroform, while the molar extinction coefficient increased from 0.99 × 105 M−1 cm−1 to 1.04 × 105 M−1 cm−1 after selenophene substitution (Table 1 and Fig. S2B, ESI†). In the film state, due to enhanced π–π stacking interactions in the solid film, L1 and L2 demonstrate some red-shifts compared to their solution state. Nevertheless, the selenide exhibits more bathochromic-shift characteristics and a stronger vibronic shoulder peak at ∼623 nm. Such a typical J-aggregation feature reflects the stronger stacking properties of selenophene substitutes.31 As shown in Fig. S2A (ESI†), both materials present a broad absorption from 400 to 700 nm, which are complementary to typical narrow bandgap acceptor Y6 with a broad absorption from 600 to 1000 nm.
To investigate the effect of selenophene substitution on photovoltaic performance, ASM OSCs are fabricated with a regular architecture: indium tin oxide(ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer (L1:Y6, L2:Y6)/Phen-NaDPO/Ag, (device area = 0.1 cm2). Device fabrication conditions, including donor/acceptor weight ratios, solvent annealing, and thermal annealing temperature, are carefully optimized, and the corresponding key device parameters are summarized in Tables S4–S13 (ESI†). Typical light J–V curves of optimized devices are plotted in Fig. 2A, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The optimized L1 control device generated a moderate PCE of 14.6% with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 25.28 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.8%. With selenophene substitution, the small molecule donor L2 based device generated higher current density up to 26.35 mA cm−2, with a decent VOC (0.83 V) and better fill factor (72.1%), yielded an outstanding PCE up to 15.8% (Table 2). Device performance of the active layer under thick film is important in roll-to-roll fabrication with large-scale production, where the film thickness is difficult to be precisely controlled.18 Therefore, we continued to study the device performance under thick film conditions. L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 based OSCs are fabricated with a thickness up to ∼300 nm. As a result, high PCE up to 14.2% and 14.3% were produced for L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 devices, respectively. We summarize the champion PCE of binary ASM OSCs and thick-film OSCs reported in the recent 6 years (Fig. 2E) and easily find that the PCEs of 15.8% and 14.3% are the highest values reported to date for binary ASM OSCs and thick-film ASM-OSCs, respectively.

Enhanced performance is generated from combined factors. Increased JSC is one of the key improving points, and it is further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement (Fig. 2B). The EQE curves of the two devices are very similar in shape. However, the L2:Y6 device exhibits a stronger photon to electron response than that of the L1:Y6 device in the range of 550–900 nm, which contributes to the enhanced JSC. The maximum EQE of the L2:Y6 based device is 87.1%, obviously higher than the 85.7% generated by the L1:Y6 device. Such an EQE enhancement is in reasonable agreement with the stronger absorbance of the L2:Y6 blend (Fig. 2D). The JSC values of L1 and L2 based devices integrated from the EQE spectra are 24.57 mA cm−2 and 25.60 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the values measured from the solar simulator (within a 2.8% error, Table 2). At the same time, internal quantum efficiency (IQE) can also be used as an important basis for evaluating JSC, which is different from EQE containing optical loss, such as reflection and transmittance. IQE reflects the ratio of extracted charges and absorbed photons, which determines the ability of solar cells to successfully extract free charge carriers from the absorbed incident photon.32 Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2B, the IQE of the L2:Y6 blend is significantly enhanced in the range from 450 to 900 nm with a maximum peak approaching 93%, which is the main reason for the higher EQE response. Averaging the spectra between 450 to 850 nm, the L2:Y6 blend yields 88.5% of IQE, whereas the same analysis leads to 86.6% from L1:Y6 blends. Overall, the difference in IQE is the main reason for the difference in the JSC between L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 devices. Higher quantum efficiency represents better charge separation and collection, and to gain more insight on this phenomenon, photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) was plotted, as shown in Fig. 2C. Jph = JL − JD, where J is the current density, and the subscripts represent the tests under illumination (L) or in the dark (D). Veff = V0 − VA, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is equal to 0, and VA is the applied bias voltage. At a high Veff of 2.5 V, the gross photogenerated excitons are assumed to be dissociated into free charge carriers and are all collected by the electrodes, and so Jph,sat is obtained33,34 (corresponding data in Table S1, ESI†). The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss = Jph,SC/Jph,sat) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll = Jph,max power/Jph,sat) are calculated under the short-circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively.35,36 The L2:Y6 device exhibits a saturated current density (Jph,sat) of 26.95 mA cm−2, higher than the L1:Y6 device (26.55 mA cm−2), which is in line with the better photon harvest capability of L2:Y6 blends. The L2:Y6 device exhibits a ηdiss of 97.80% and a ηcoll of 83.49%, higher than the L1:Y6 device (ηdiss of 95.20% and ηcoll of 79.96%). The result shows that selenophene substitution can not only yield better light harvest but also promote exciton dissociation and charge extraction.
Charge carrier dynamics
To shed light on the enhanced charge extraction and incident light response after selenophene substitution, charge carrier dynamics is investigated in different ways. Firstly, incident light intensity dependent J–V response and the transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) tests are executed.37 Short circuit current density and incident light intensity were satisfied with a power law, i.e., JSC ∝ Iα.38 The degree of bimolecular recombination of devices could be qualitatively analyzed by the exponent, with α closer to unity representing better charge collection and less bimolecular recombination.39 The relationship between JSC and incident light intensity is illustrated in Fig. 3A, and α values of 0.983 and 0.988 are obtained for the L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 devices, respectively, which means that L2 based device is less affected by bimolecular recombination than its L1 counterpart. The presence of trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination can be distinguished from the ideality factor n of the device. To estimate the ideality factor, we measured VOC as a function of the incident light intensity, and the correlation satisfies the following expression of VOC ∝ nkT/qln(I),40 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. If n deviates from 1 (trap-free condition),41 it indicates the presence of trap-assisted recombination. As fitted in Fig. 3D, the n values of L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 devices are obtained as 1.08 and 1.01, respectively, indicating that L2:Y6 device with microcrystalline structure (introduced in the microstructure) generates less trap-assisted recombination centers, which accounts for the promoted charge extraction and improved photovoltaic performance.

(C and F) Dark J–V curves of OSCs: hole-only diodes and electron-only diodes; The solid lines are fitted to the experimental data according to SCLC model. 
The quantitative analysis of charge recombination and extraction dynamics across L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 active layers in devices is carried out by TPV and TPC characterizations.42 The related TPV and TPC original diagrams are collected in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The carrier lifetimes (τ) under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 3B) are extracted from the TPV decay dynamics employing mono-exponential fits under one sun bias illumination.43,44 By fitting of TPV signal with the equation: y = A × exp(−x/τ), the L2:Y6 device exhibits a τ value of 2.19 μs, longer than its L1:Y6 counterparts (1.83 μs), in compliance to the lower recombination in L2:Y6 device with microcrystalline structure. Meanwhile, charge extraction properties also play a key role. The competition between carrier sweep-out and recombination during the operation is obtained through the TPC measurement.45,46 The photocurrent decay time of L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 devices are 0.87 μs and 0.76 μs, as depicted in TPC (Fig. 3E), indicating that the L2:Y6 device with microcrystalline structure can effectively facilitate charge carrier extraction. These results indicate that the selenophene substitution strategy and the special microcrystalline morphology can effectively facilitate the charge carrier extraction and suppress charge recombination. The reduced characteristic time of charge extraction means a better charge extraction, which resulted in high charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) in the L2:Y6 device. In addition, prolonged charge carrier lifetime in the L2:Y6 device provided the ability to efficiently extract charge under high bias and manifested as a promoted fill factor.47
Finally, to unveil the charge transport process, both hole and electron carrier mobilities were estimated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique.37 The hole only devices with architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and the electron only devices with architectures of ITO/ZnO/Phen-NaDPO/active layer/Phen-NaDPO/Ag were fabricated. The hole mobility and electron mobility values are presented in Fig. 3C and F and corresponding data in Table S16 (ESI†). With selenophene substitution, hole mobility is improved from 6.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 7.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and electron mobility increased from 1.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.51 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Boosted carrier mobility may be one of the reasons for the increased FF and the insensitivity of film thickness.
Microstructure of the active layer
Compared with the L1:Y6 device, the L2:Y6 device has higher FF, less charge recombination, and better charge collection, which is a significant contribution to its PCE enhancement. Charge transfer and recombination are affected by the morphology of the active layer. In order to explore the donor/acceptor phase separation status, we compared the morphology of L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 blend films via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As demonstrated in Fig. S4 (ESI†), L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 blend films under the as-cast condition exhibit different surface morphologies. L1:Y6 blend film forms more visible surface patterns than L2:Y6, and wrinkle-like microstructures can be clearly seen on the film surface. As a result, the as-cast L1:Y6 blend film affords a root mean square roughness (RRMS) value of 3.08 nm (Fig. S4A, ESI†), which is larger than that of the L2:Y6 blend film (RRMS = 1.50 nm, Fig. S4B, ESI†). However, after the CS2 solvent annealing (SVA) for 40 s and 110 °C thermal annealing (TA) for 2 min, the topology of L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 blend films changed dramatically. Especially for the L2:Y6 blend film, a rod-like microcrystalline texture is formed after post treatment, implying enhanced molecular aggregation with excellent crystallinity44 (Fig. 4). As demonstrated by the AFM image, compared with the “as cast” blend film, the RRMS of L1:Y6 is reduced from 3.08 nm to 2.41 nm, and the protruding wrinkle-like microstructure became smoother after post treatment (Fig. 4A). However, the RRMS of L2:Y6 increased dramatically from 1.50 nm to 10.50 nm with the appearance of the rod-like microcrystalline structure, which verifies the significant ordered stacking characteristics of L2 (Fig. 4D). According to the AFM height and phase images, L2:Y6 film displays clear rod-like crystals with a width of ∼20 nm and a length of 100–200 nm after post treatment (Fig. 4A and E). To further understand the bulk morphology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also carried out (Fig. 4C, F and Fig. S5, ESI†). After post treatment, rod-like patterns are obviously distributed in the whole bulk of the L2:Y6 blend film, while the L1:Y6 blend film just shows a homogeneous morphology with less phase separation. Such morphological variations imply that selenophene substitution can significantly improve the aggregation characteristics of donor molecules in the active layer after post treatment.

Molecular packing is the basis of micromorphology. To obtain a direct understanding of the effect on molecular stacking after selenophene substitution, GIWAXS measurements were carried out. As displayed in Fig. 5 and Fig. S6 (ESI†), dominant edge-on oriented π–π stacking can be observed in the neat film of both molecules L1 and L2, with distinct h00 lamellar diffractions in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, suggesting a long-range ordered lamellar packing.48 Upon mixing with the face-on oriented Y6, both blends tend to form a face-on orientation with a strong (010) π–π stacking diffraction in the OOP direction. Scattering patterns of both L1:Y6 and L2:Y6 as-cast blends show no significant difference, representing identical stacking characteristics. However, after post treatment, the L2:Y6 blend film shows more ordered characteristic signals. To quantify this difference, line cut profiles along the direction of OOP and IP are collected in Fig. 5C and F, and the detailed peak information is summarized in Table S14 (ESI†). Under the same condition of device preparation, the π–π stacking diffraction peak of the L1:Y6 blend in the OOP direction is located at 1.683 Å−1 (d = 3.733 Å). With selenophene substitution, the diffraction peak of the L2:Y6 blend shifted to 1.689 Å−1 (d = 3.718 Å), implying a closer π–π face-on stacking and smaller interplanar spacing. Obtained from Scherrer's equation,49 face-on stacking crystallite coherence lengths (CCL) in the control L1:Y6 blend is 29.15 nm, while in selenide L2:Y6 blend, a significantly increased CCL value of up to 35.57 nm is observed. Closer molecular packing and larger stacking scale constitute the stronger stacking characteristics of selenophene substitutes, which may result in higher phase purity and lower bulk defects. The strong stacking characteristics of L2 may be the reason for the formation of a favored rod-like crystal structure in the L2:Y6 blend, which not only facilitates charge transport, but also reduces the trapping probability of charge carriers and then prolongs the charge carrier lifetime. In short, an ideal morphology with reasonable domain size, improved phase purity, orderly molecular arrangement, and intimate crystal contact is achieved by selenophene substitution strategy, which results in effective exciton dissociation and charge extraction in the L2:Y6 system.

Liquid crystalline properties
The fierce morphological change of the selenide donor L2 after post treatment suggests that it can self-assemble to form a more ordered stacking arrangement under treatment at a certain temperature or in solvent vapor. Therefore, we are enlightened to check the liquid crystalline (LC) properties of these efficient small molecule donors L1 and L2.18,20 Firstly, the good thermal stability of L1 and L2 with a decomposition temperature over 400 °C is proved by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S7, ESI†). With the thermal stability data in hand, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement is performed to evaluate the crystalline properties of L1 and L2. As plotted in Fig. S8 (ESI†), both L1 and L2 exhibit three endothermic peaks, i.e., 125.5, 182.1, and 236.1 °C for L1, 143.0, 185.9, and 244.7 °C for L2. As for both L1 and L2, the first endothermic peak is attributed to a secondary phase transition of the solid, while the subsequent two endothermic peaks should be related to the phase transition from the solid phase into the liquid crystal phase, and the melting point from liquid crystal phase to the molten state, respectively. This phenomenon is very similar to the reported liquid crystalline donors BTR and BTR-Cl, except for the higher phase transition temperatures, which indicate stronger intermolecular interactions and higher crystallinity.
The existence of a liquid crystal phase can also be directly observed using polarizing optical microscope (POM). Between the melting point and liquid crystal transition point, liquid crystal phases of both L1 and L2 can be clearly observed at 220.0 °C and 231.5 °C, respectively, with different crystal textures. As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S9–S11 (ESI†), L1 exhibits a nematic phase with semilune texture, while L2 with selenophene substitution presents a sematic A phase with fan-shaped texture. Compared to the nematic liquid crystal donor L1 with a high flow ability, fan-shaped sematic liquid crystal donor L2 can self-organize to a more ordered status in a long range due to the stronger intermolecular interaction arising from selenophene substitution. As a consequence, rod-like crystallite morphology with reasonable domain size and intimate crystal contact is formed in the L2:Y6 blend. This favored morphology with long-range directional orientation could guarantee efficient charge transfer in long distance, thus generating outstanding device performance with insensitivity to film thickness.

Conclusion
In summary, we have developed two novel 2D-conjugated liquid crystalline small molecule donors, namely L1 and L2 with alkylsily-thiophene and alkylsily-selenophene conjugated side chain substituted on BDT, respectively. Unlike the nematic liquid crystal donor L1, the selenide donor L2 shows higher intramolecular interaction and presents a novel sematic phase with a fan-shaped texture. By blending with the efficient acceptor Y6, the selenide donor L2 achieves an ideal rod-like morphology with reasonable domain size, orderly molecular arrangement, and close molecular packing after post treatment, which results in improved absorption coefficient, higher mobility, less charge recombination, and faster charge exaction rate, finally contributing a champion PCE of 15.8% for binary ASM-OSCs. More importantly, the L2:Y6 device shows a low photovoltaic performance dependence on the thickness of the active layer and can still maintain an excellent PCE of 14.3% with a thickness up to ∼300 nm. To our knowledge, it should be the highest efficiency for thick-film ASM-OSCs (≥300 nm), suggesting a big promise for roll-to-roll printing processes with large-scale production. These excellent features highlight the importance of selenophene substitution in fine tuning the active layer morphology and demonstrate the promising role of liquid crystalline donors in constructing high-performance ASM OSCs.

Material characterizations

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 and 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using a JEOL JMS-S3000 Spiral-TOFMS (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), Ions generated by irradiation with a 349 nm Nd:YLF laser were accelerated at 20 kV. The ions then passed along a spiral ion trajectory with a flight length of approximately 17 m. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was done on a CHI600E electrochemical workstation with Pt disk, Pt plate, and standard calomel electrode (SCE) as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution. The samples were drop cast on the glass carbon electrode to obtain a thin film for CV measurement. The CV curves were recorded versus the potential of SCE, which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). Ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 365 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC 1 thermogravimetric analyzer with a thermal balance under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a METTLER TOLEDO DSC 1 differential scanning calorimeter with thermal balance under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. To study the liquid crystalline properties of L1 and L2, we used a Nikon Eclipse LV100 POM equipped with Linkam LTS350 heating and cooling stage connected to a Linkam TMS 94 temperature programmer.
Device fabrication and testing
Organic solar cells were prepared with regular structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Phen-NaDPO/Ag. Cleaning and pretreatment of patterned ITO can be found elsewhere [Adv. Energy Mater., 2020, 10, 2001076]. PEDOT:PSS was diluted with the same volume of water, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (∼20 nm) (Clevios Al 4083) was spin-coated onto the UV-treated substrates followed by thermal treatment on a hot plate at 160 °C for 15 min. Then, the HTL-covered samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox for active layer deposition. The optimized overall concentration was 23 mg mL−1 chloroform solution with a feed ratio of 1.5:1 (w/w) for donors:Y6, respectively. Note: the as-prepared solutions were stirred overnight at 40 °C before being spin-coated. The active layers were spin-coated at an optimized speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s, resulting in films of 160 to 170 nm in thickness. The active layers were then treated by CS2 solvent annealing (SVA) for 40 s and 110 °C thermal annealing (TA) for 2 min. Then, Phen–NaDPO solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in isopropyl alcohol) was spin-coated with 2000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, these cells were transferred into a thermal evaporation chamber with a base pressure below 1 × 10−6 Torr, and 100 nm of Ag was deposited with a deposition rate of 0.1–0.2 nm s−1. The active area was 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices were recorded under AM 1.5G illumination provided by an AAA class solar simulator (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, SS-X50R) calibrated by a silicon reference cell with KG2 filter (supported from Enli Tech. Co., Ltd, Taiwan). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a certified incident photon to electron conversion (IPCE) equipment (QE-R) from Enli Technology Co., Ltd. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard monocrystalline Si photovoltaic cell. The IQE of optimized blend films were calculated from the following equation: (1)The parasitic absorption was obtained from the transfer matrix model.52
Thin-film characterizations
Topographic images of films were obtained on a Bruker atomic force microscopy (AFM) with the type of dimension edge with Scan Asyst™ in the tapping mode using an etched silicon cantilever at a nominal load of ∼2 nN, and the scanning rate for a 5 μm × 5 μm image size was 0.9 Hz. TEM studies were conducted with a Talos F200S electron microscopy to investigate the phase distribution of the active layer. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured at 13A beam line of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Taiwan), and were provided technical support by “Ceshigo Research Service, http://www.ceshigo.com”. All samples for GIWAXS were radiated at 12 keV X-ray with an incident angle of 0.12°. Thin-film samples were prepared under device conditions on the Si/PEDOT:PSS substrates.
SCLC mobility measurements
By fitting the hole/electron-only diode dark current to the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, the hole and electron mobility of the photosensitive active layer can be obtained. The electron-only device structure was ITO/ZnO/Phen-NaDPO/active layer/Phen–NaDPO/Ag, and the hole-only device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The following equation was used to estimate the electric-field dependent SCLC mobility: (2)For the hole-only device structure, Vbi = 0 V (flat band pattern formed by PEDOT:PSS-MoO3); for the electron-only device structure, Vbi = 0.5 V was used following the protocol reported.
TPC and TPV measurements
For TPV, the measurement was conducted under 1 sun conditions by illuminating the device with a white light-emitting diode, and the device was set to the open-circuit condition. For TPC, the device was set to the short-circuit condition in the dark. The output signal was collected by a keysight oscilloscope. The photovoltage decay kinetics of all devices follow a mono-exponential decay: δV = Aexp(−t/τ) where t is the time, and τ is the charge carrier lifetime.

Broader context
The efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) has rapidly climbed up after the discovery of efficient non-fullerene acceptors. However, in most cases, the applied polymer donors suffer from batch-to-batch variations and low reproducibility in device performance, which seems to be the last obstacle for this technology towards commercialization. Compared with polymers, small molecules are more promising for commercial application in OSCs because they have well-defined chemical structures and higher reproducibility. Nevertheless, manipulating the morphology of small molecules to achieve ideal phase separation is full of challenges. Herein, the selenophene substitution strategy is proposed to enhance the intramolecular interaction of small molecule donors and optimize their phase separation morphology to an ideal state, finally contributing to an outstanding PCE of 15.8% for binary ASM-OSCs.
