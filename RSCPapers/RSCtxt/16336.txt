    , Accepted 14th March 2012First published on 23rd March 2012AbstractPorous, nanostructured BiVO4 films are incorporated with Mo and W by simultaneous evaporation of Bi, V, Mo, and W in vacuum followed by oxidation in air. Synthesis parameters such as the Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratio and deposition angle are adjusted to optimize the films for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. Films synthesized with a Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratio of 46:46:6:2 (6% Mo, 2% W) demonstrate the best PEC performance with photocurrent densities 10 times higher than for pure BiVO4 and greater than previously reported for Mo and W containing BiVO4. The films consist of a directional, nanocolumnar layer beneath an irregular surface structure. Backside illumination utilizes light scattering off the irregular surface structure resulting in 30–45% higher photocurrent densities than for frontside illumination. To improve the kinetics for water oxidation Pt is photo-deposited onto the surface of the 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films as an electrocatalyst. These films achieve quantum efficiencies of 37% at 1.1 V vs. RHE and 50% at 1.6 V vs. RHE for 450 nm light.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen has great potential for solar energy conversion and storage; however, there are many material challenges that must be overcome to make it practical on a large scale. The materials used in a practical water splitting system should efficiently absorb a large portion of the solar spectrum, be catalytic for both water oxidation and proton reduction, promote facile charge transfer, be composed of abundant elements, and remain stable in electrolyte under illumination. For economic viability the system should have a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of at least 10%.1 Many different semiconductor materials have been tested for water splitting;2–6 however, none of these materials meet all of the above requirements.
Progress has been made in the synthesis of multi-component semiconductor materials and the addition of dopants as a means of improving water splitting performance.2,5,7–9 Studies have suggested that incorporating impurities into a semiconductor can improve photocatalytic performance by assisting with crystal growth during synthesis, creating catalytic sites, or altering the band structure and electronic properties. Significant improvements in photoelectrochemical performance and light absorption have been observed for incorporation of C, N, and S into TiO2, and for incorporation of Si, Ti, Sn/Be, and Ti/Al into α-Fe2O3.10–17 Another semiconductor material that can be enhanced by the addition of various elements is monoclinic BiVO4, an n-type material with a bandgap of 2.3–2.5 eV that is active for PEC water oxidation.18–22 Compared to pure BiVO4, several mixed metal oxides containing Bi and V such as BiCu2VO6, BiZn2VO6, and Ca1−xBixVxMo1−xO4, have shown higher O2 evolution rates from aqueous solutions.23–25 BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 prepared by solid state reaction had an O2 evolution rate from aqueous AgNO3 that was nearly three times higher than BiVO4.26 Films formed by drop-casting and annealing a precursor solution containing Bi, V, and W (atomic ratio of 4.5:5:0.5) had 4.6 times higher photocurrent than stoichiometric BiVO4 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 10 mM Na2SO3 as a sacrificial electron donor.27 Using the same technique, Park et al. demonstrated that W/Mo doped BiVO4 (Bi:V:W:Mo atomic ratio of 4.6:4.6:0.2:0.6) had 10 times higher photocurrent than BiVO4 in a solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M Na2SO3.28 Another study has shown improvement in incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) with the addition of 1% W to BiVO4 films deposited by spray pyrolysis on top of a thin interfacial layer of SnO2.29 Gas chromatography and oxygen reduction measurements have confirmed that photocurrent from pure and W doped BiVO4 in Na2SO4 solutions is due to water oxidation.27,30
Herein we report the photoelectrochemical performance of Mo and W containing BiVO4 films synthesized by simultaneous evaporation of elemental Bi, V, Mo, and W in vacuum followed by annealing in air. This synthesis technique allows for control of both the chemical composition and nanostructure to improve the photoactivity of the BiVO4 films. Incorporation of 6% Mo and 2% W by this method resulted in a 10 fold increase in photocurrent over BiVO4. The 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films had IPCE values above 24% for wavelengths of light between 360 and 450 nm at an applied potential of 1.6 V vs. RHE in a mixture of 0.1 Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), which is significantly higher than reported for this material using other synthesis techniques. The photo-deposition of Pt onto the surface of these films as an electrocatalyst improved the photocurrent onset potential drastically, resulting in IPCE values above 35% at 1.1 V vs. RHE and above 50% at 1.6 V vs. RHE.
2. Experimental
2.1 Description of synthesis parameters
The films were deposited in a high vacuum system consisting of a main chamber and load-lock chamber for sample exchange. The main chamber contained a hemispherical four-port bottom flange, which held four custom-built electron beam evaporators arranged linearly and directed at the centre of the chamber with a 16° angle between adjacent evaporators. All four evaporators were simultaneously controlled using a LabVIEW program that was written in collaboration with Ramsdale Software. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) could be translated in and out of the centre of the chamber to measure deposition rates from individual evaporators using a QCM controller (INFICON SQM-160). Substrates were moved between the main chamber and load-lock chamber using a sample holder attached to a magnetically-coupled rotary-linear motion translator.
Prior to deposition, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC15) were washed with detergent (CONTREX) and water followed by washing in ethyl alcohol (PHARMCO-AAPER, 99.5%), ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min in ethyl alcohol (BRANSON 1210), and rinsed with de-mineralized water. The clean substrates were transferred through the load-lock into the main chamber. In the main chamber the substrate to be deposited on was held approximately 6 inches away from each evaporating component and the deposition angle (γ) was adjusted to a fixed angle (0–90°) between the direction normal to the surface of the substrate and the plane of the evaporators (see Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Films were grown on FTO substrates. This schematic illustrates how the FTO substrate was orientated above the evaporators during deposition. The substrate holder could hold up to four substrates and rotate to any deposition angle (γ), defined as the angle between the plane of evaporators and the vector normal to the FTO substrate surface. 
Each of the four evaporators contained either bismuth granules (Alfa Aesar, 99.997% purity) in a molybdenum crucible, a 0.25 inch diameter vanadium rod (ESPI, 3N purity), a 0.125 inch molybdenum rod (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%), or a 0.125 inch diameter tungsten rod (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%). Before depositing on a substrate, the deposition rate of each component was measured using the QCM. Adjustments were made to the evaporation rates in order to achieve the target atomic percentage of each component and the film thickness was determined by the QCM measured deposition rate, deposition angle (γ), and total deposition time. The majority of the films synthesized for this study were deposited in vacuum at pressures on the order of 5 × 10−8 Torr or lower. For films grown by reactive ballistic deposition (RBD), a leak valve was used to backfill the chamber with oxygen (Matheson, UHP grade) to approximately 5 × 10−6 Torr where it was held during deposition. Deposition was done at the ambient temperature of the chamber which was warmer than room temperature due to heat from the evaporators. After deposition the films were annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h using a muffle furnace (Neytech) with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. For photo-deposition of Pt the films were placed in a beaker with freshly made 10 mM H2PtCl6·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) and 0.2 M methanol (Fischer) and illuminated from the backside with approximately 140 mW cm−2 of white light for 1 h.
2.2 Measurement techniques
Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a 3-electrode photoelectrochemical cell, which had a main compartment for the working electrode and two branched compartments separated by fritted disks (Ace Glass, 10–20 μm porosity) for the counter electrode and reference electrode. The working electrode was the BiVO4 film which was pressed against an o-ring on the main compartment. It had a backside mask so that the active area was approximately 0.212 cm2 for both frontside and backside illumination. The distance between the film surface and the light source was the same for frontside and backside illumination measurements. The counter electrode was a 1 mm diameter Pt wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (CH Instruments, CH111). Each compartment of the cell was filled from the same stock of electrolyte solution, which was made using Na2SO4 or Na2SO3 anhydrous, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (Fisher) in de-mineralized water. To make 0.1 M Na2SO4 or 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8), equal parts 0.2 M phosphate monobasic and 0.2 M phosphate dibasic were mixed and then Na2SO4 or Na2SO3 was added to the mixture. The pH of the solution was checked using a bench top pH meter (OAKTON). The pH increased slightly to 7 when 0.1M Na2SO3 was added to the 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). An electrochemical analyzer/workstation (CH Instruments CH660D) was used to control the cell potential. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. For linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and constant potential measurements the illumination source was a filtered (Newport, Schott KG3) 100 W xenon lamp (Newport, Model 66452). For white light measurements the lamp was positioned to provide approximately 73 mW cm−2 irradiation on the film. For visible light measurements an additional filter (Newport, Cut-on 420 nm) was added to the light source. IPCE measurements were conducted using a full spectrum solar simulator (Newport, Model 9600, 150 W xenon lamp) with an AM 1.5 filter (Newport) and a motorized monochrometer (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). The monochrometer slit size was adjusted to 0.75 mm × 2 mm in order to provide between 5 and 160 μW cm−2 of irradiation for wavelengths between 350 and 520 nm. See Supporting Information (Fig. S1) for a typical light power density spectrum used for IPCE measurements. Light power was measured using a handheld optical power meter with a UV enhanced silicon photo-detector (Newport, Models 1916C and 818-UV). IPCE values were calculated using the following equation:  where jp(λ) is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and Eλ(λ) is the incident light power density (mW cm−2) for each wavelength, λ (nm). UV-vis transmission measurements were performed on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Transmission-reflectance measurements were conducted using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Labsphere). For Tauc plots the absorption coefficient (α) was determined by:  where z is the film thickness. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using the CH Instruments CH660D and the built in software was used to measure space charge capacitance, Csc (F), vs. applied potential, E (V). Mott-Schottky plots were created based on ideal semiconductor behavior:31  where e is the electronic charge (C), ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ND is the donor density (cm−3), Efb is the flat band potential (V), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (K). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were acquired using a Zeiss Supra 40 VP SEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken on a Bruker-Nonius D8 diffractometer. The Cu-Kα radiation source was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA and measurements were carried out in the θ/2θ mode with an incident angle of 5°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer with Mg-Kα radiation. The concentration of Bi, V, Mo, W, O, and C were calculated from the integrated peak areas obtained after subtracting the background from each peak using the Shirley method.32 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were performed using an Agilent 7500ce Quadrupole ICP-MS. To prepare ICP-MS samples films were dissolved in 3 ml of 20% HNO3 (v/v) (Fischer) inside a 23 ml acid digester vessel at 160 °C for 2 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optimal synthesis parameters
Mo and W containing BiVO4 films were synthesized with varying deposition parameters such as the deposition angle, Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratio, background gas pressure, and deposition time (film thickness). Evaporation at high angles of incidence, i.e., glancing angle deposition (GLAD) can be used to control the morphology of the material being synthesized.33,34 Evaporation in vacuum onto a substrate without any background gas is a form of ballistic deposition. The addition of background gas during deposition can be used to alter the chemical composition of the material being synthesized via a process known as reactive ballistic deposition (RBD).35–39 For BiVO4, we found that ballistic deposition followed by annealing in air to form an oxide resulted in higher photocurrents than RBD in 5 × 10−6 Torr of oxygen followed by the same annealing conditions. The stoichiometric BiVO4 films (Bi/V atomic ratio of 1) synthesized by ballistic deposition in this study showed much higher photocurrents than the stoichiometric films deposited by RBD in our previous study.40 Unless otherwise indicated the photoelectrochemical results in this study are for films deposited by ballistic deposition (no background gas). For these films, the deposition angle had an obvious affect on the film morphology, but not the photoactivity. Films deposited at normal incidence (γ = 0°) had slightly lower photocurrent than films deposited at more glancing angles, but there was not a significant difference in photocurrent for films deposited at angles between 45° and 75°. Therefore, a constant deposition angle of γ = 55° was chosen for comparing the photoelectrochemical performance of films. SEM images of a film deposited with a Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratio of 46:46:6:2 (6% Mo, 2% W) at a deposition angle of γ = 55° are shown in Fig. 2. The images were taken right after deposition (Fig. 2(a)) and after annealing in air at 500 °C for 2 h (Fig. 2(b)). For a constant deposition angle of γ = 55°, SEM images of films having different Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratios appeared the same; i.e., Mo and W incorporation did not change the surface structure and morphology. SEM images for films grown at different deposition angles are included in the Supporting Information (Fig. S4). Several researchers have studied the effect of deposition angle on materials deposited by ballistic deposition.33,34,41 During the initial stages of ballistic deposition incoming atoms randomly land on the substrate surface, creating clusters of topographically elevated points. With continued deposition at high angles of incidence the topographically elevated points have a self-shadowing effect that promotes an inclined nanocolumnar structure. As shown in the Supporting Information, Mo and W containing BiVO4 films deposited at lower angles of incidence (γ = 0–25°) had bundles of nanowires spread over the surface, which can be attributed to surface diffusion and segregation of bismuth atoms during deposition.40 At higher angles of incidence (γ = 45–75°) self-shadowing hindered nanowire growth, resulting in a more directional, columnar film structure. Nevertheless, some intermittent nanowires were still present on the surface as can be seen in Fig. 2(a). Upon annealing to 500 °C, the finer features of the film sintered together into slightly larger, irregular crystal structures as shown in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 3 shows a cross-sectional view SEM image of a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film deposited at γ = 55° and annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h. The exact film thickness could not be measured because of the uneven surface structure and protruding wires. The nominal thickness of the film was estimated to be approximately 140 nm, which is the approximate thickness that resulted in the highest photoactivity.

For individual Mo and W incorporation, films with Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratios of 47.5:47.5:5:0 (5% Mo) and 48.75:48.75:0:2.5 (2.5% W) had the highest photoactivity. Fig. 4(a) shows the steady-state photocurrent density for films incorporated with various concentrations of Mo or W under visible and white light illumination in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) at 1.1 V vs. RHE. For all levels of incorporation, Mo was more effective than W at improving the photoelectrochemical performance. Our results for Na2SO4 and phosphate buffer without a sacrificial reagent are slightly different from a recent scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) study of Mo and W doped BiVO4 arrays that found 6% W resulted in higher photocurrent than 4% Mo when tested at 0.4 V vs. NHE in 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2SO4 under white light illumination.28 The SECM study was supported by DFT calculations that suggested W is more efficient than Mo at donating electrons to the host lattice. A separate DFT study of doped BiVO4 concluded that under Bi-rich/O-poor growth conditions Mo is a more promising dopant than W for BiVO4 because Mo doping does not result in significant Fermi level pinning while W doping pins the Fermi level ∼0.3 V below the conduction band minimum.42 Neither DFT study accounted for all of the factors that can contribute to PEC water oxidation such as the activity of catalytic sites created by Mo or W incorporation. Upon annealing above 397–497 °C monoclinic BiVO4 adopts a scheelite crystal structure.19 It was found that scheelites with molybdate defects were slightly better than those with tungstate defects for selective oxidation and ammoxidation of propylene.43 To rule out differences in catalytic activity for water oxidation we performed PEC testing of the highest photoactivity Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 films in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) with Na2SO3 added as a sacrificial electron donor. In this solution at relatively low potentials (0.4 to 0.8 V vs. RHE) vacuum deposited 2.5% W BiVO4 films showed slightly better photoactivity than 5% Mo BiVO4 films, which is consistent with the SECM study.28 However, at higher potentials the 5% Mo BiVO4 films were more photoactive in both Na2SO4 and Na2SO3. Another factor that contributes to photoactivity for PEC water oxidation is the minority carrier diffusion length, which has been shown to decrease with heavy doping of semiconductor materials.44,45 At low potentials a decrease in minority carrier diffusion length in BiVO4 would be expected to reduce photoactivity, but at higher applied potentials increased band bending can help drive minority carriers to the reaction site at the film-electrolyte interface.

The atomic % is relative to the total amount of Bi, V, Mo, and W (excluding oxygen content). The white light illumination power density was 73 mW cm−2. Error bars represent one standard deviation. 
Films with co-incorporation of Mo and W were synthesized with Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratios of 46:46:2:6 (2% Mo, 6% W), 46:46:4:4 (4% Mo, 4% W), and 46:46:6:2 (6% Mo, 2% W). The steady-state photocurrent densities for these films under visible and white light illumination at 1.1 V vs. RHE are shown in Fig. 4(b). Photoactivity increased along with increasing Mo/W ratio and films with a Bi:V:Mo:W ratio of 46:46:6:2 showed the best performance for PEC water oxidation out of all films tested. In summary, photoactivity increased according to the following trend: pure BiVO4<2.5% W<5% Mo<6% Mo, 2% W. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the optimal films with chopped (dark and white light) linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans in (a) 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) and (b) 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8). Fig. 5 shows backside illumination results for the 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film only, but backside illumination resulted in higher photocurrents for all levels of Mo and W incorporation.
 Fig. 5  Chopped (dark and white light) LSV scans for BiVO4 films with varying atomic percentages of Mo and W (relative to the total Bi, V, Mo, and W) with frontside or backside illumination as indicated. Measurements were conducted in (a) 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) or (b) 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The illumination power density at the film surface was 73 mW cm−2 and the scan rate was 0.025 V s−1. 
When pure BiVO4 is illuminated in Na2SO4 for long periods of time the photocurrent tends to decrease as the material photo-corrodes and vanadium dissolves into solution.30,40 For short term PEC scans the Mo and W incorporated films showed higher stability than pure BiVO4 and during the first 1–2 min of illumination at constant potential the photocurrent actually increased. In addition the photoactivity of Mo and W containing films tended to improve with age after annealing (see Fig. S5 in the Supporting Information). This increase in photocurrent ranged from 20% to 50% and leveled off after 40 to 80 days of aging. Between measurements the films were simply left in a plastic container in the laboratory at normal atmospheric conditions. To rule out the aging effect when comparing different films, all the previous constant potential and LSV scans in Section 3.1 were done within 24 h of annealing. After 1–2 h of illumination at constant potential the Mo and W containing BiVO4 films remained fairly stable. Fig. 6 shows an amperometric i-t scan of a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film at 1.1 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) done 14 days after annealing. The figure shows an initial increase in photocurrent (Fig. 6 inset) followed by a decay. A large portion of the decay seemed to be caused by an electrolyte concentration gradient and bubble formation at the film surface because most of the photocurrent could be restored by temporarily blocking the light and flushing the film surface with fresh electrolyte. Long term there was still a net decrease in photocurrent that may have been due to photo-corrosion.

The film was measured 14 days after annealing. Backside illumination was used and the power density at the film surface was 73 mW cm−2. At 1800 s the light was blocked and the film surface was flushed with fresh electrolyte. 
3.2 Material characterization

3.2.1 X-Ray diffraction. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken immediately after deposition and after annealing in air at 500 °C for 2 h. Immediately after deposition no peaks were observed for V, Mo, or W, but there were peaks for crystalline Bi (PDF#00-044-1246) and SnO2 (PDF#00-046-1088) from the FTO. Interestingly, films deposited by RBD in 5 × 10−6 Torr showed higher intensity peaks for crystalline Bi than films deposited without any background gas. In our previous study we found that Bi was not reactive towards background oxygen, while V reacted readily to form vanadium oxide.40 When Bi and V are deposited together in 5 × 10−6 Torr of oxygen the reaction between V and oxygen impedes mixing of Bi and V, which increases Bi segregation. After annealing, all films showed XRD peaks which closely resembled the reference patterns for monoclinic BiVO4 (PDF#00-014-0688) and SnO2 (PDF#00-046-1088). Films deposited by RBD generally showed lower intensity BiVO4 peaks and occasionally showed additional peaks for Bi4V2O11 at 28.3° and 32°. Fig. 7(a) shows the XRD pattern for pure, 5% Mo, and 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films deposited by ballistic deposition along with the reference patterns. Similar to Park et al., we observed merging of the (2 0 0) peak at 34.5° and (0 0 2) peak at 35.2° into a single peak at 34.9° for 5% Mo incorporation and for 6% Mo, 2% W co-incorporation.28 The merging of peaks was attributed to a deformation of the scheelite crystal structure from monoclinic to tetragonal symmetry, which had previously been reported for Mo and W incorporation in a variety of scheelite-type materials including BiVO4.46Fig. 7(b) shows that for 2.5% W incorporation only partial merging of the peaks occurred. At 5% W the two peaks had fully merged at 34.9°, but an additional peak appeared at 24°, which matches the strongest peak in the reference pattern for WO3 (PDF#00-041-0905). This implies that phase segregation begins to occur when ballistic deposition is used to incorporate more than 2.5% W into BiVO4, and this may be another factor contributing to the decrease in photocurrent for higher amounts of W incorporation above 2.5% (see Fig. 4(a)).
 Fig. 7  (a) XRD spectra for pure, 5% Mo, and 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 with JCPDS peak intensities and locations plotted below the data for monoclinic BiVO4 (PDF#00-014-0688) and SnO2 (PDF#00-046-1088. (b) XRD spectra for 2.5% W and 5% W BiVO4 with the highest intensity JCPDS peak for WO3 (PDF#00-041-0905) labelled at 24°. In both (a) and (b) the * symbol indicates a single peak at 34.9° after Mo and W incorporation rather than two peaks at 34.5° and 35.2° for pure BiVO4. 


3.2.2 Transmission-reflectance and electrical impedance spectroscopy. 
Initially, we measured the Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 films using UV-vis transmission spectroscopy, but the spectra showed absorption tails that extended to energies as low as 2.0 eV. This was most likely caused by diffuse scattering off the irregular surface structure of the films (see SEM images in Fig. 2 and 3). In order to obtain more accurate absorption spectra we measured the films using transmission-reflectance spectroscopy with an integrating sphere to capture all of the light. The absorption data was converted to a Tauc plot (see Fig. 8) with the assumption that the BiVO4 films had a direct band gap.47 Regardless of the amount of Mo and W incorporation, all of the films had approximately the same x-axis intercept of ∼2.5 eV from extrapolation of the linear portions of the curves. This value is in line with a band gap of 2.4–2.5 eV reported for BiVO4 synthesized by other techniques indicating that Mo and W incorporation does not alter the band gap of BiVO4.18–21,27,28
 Fig. 8  Tauc plots for BiVO4 films with varying atomic percentages of Mo and W calculated from transmission-reflectance spectroscopy data. 
We performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to better understand the effect of Mo and W incorporation on carrier concentration. Mott-Schottky plots for pure BiVO4 and 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films are included in the Supporting Information (Fig. S6). The slopes of the plots indicate that the flat band potentials are in the range of 0.0–0.05 V vs. RHE for pure BiVO4 and 0.12–0.15 V vs. RHE for 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4. The plot for 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 has a lower slope, which is expected for a higher carrier concentration or doping level (ND).31 It should be noted that nanostructure has a significant impact on the impedance behaviour of a material.48–50 EIS was used for comparison of the pure and 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films because they appeared to have the same surface structure and morphology when viewed by SEM.


3.2.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken to verify the concentration and oxidation states of elements in the films and to help understand the increase in photocurrent with age after annealing. The XPS data for a single 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film taken both one day and 41 days after annealing is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 9. Additional XPS spectra are included in the Supporting Information (Fig. S7). One day after annealing, the binding energy locations for the peaks were at 159.0 eV for Bi 4f 7/2, 516.8 eV for V 2p 3/2, 529.9 eV for O 1s, 232.2 for eV Mo 3d 5/2, and 35.1 eV for W 4f 7/2, which corresponds to oxidation states of Bi3+, V5+, O2−, Mo6+, and W6+.51 The XPS measured Bi:V:Mo:W atomic ratio of 41:50:3.8:5.5 did not match up with the expected ratio of 46:46:6:2 based on QCM measurements prior to starting deposition. We could not use XPS to accurately measure below the surface because the films were nanoporous and the argon sputter etch gun on the XPS instrument was mounted with an incident angle of 45° so even after sputter etching a considerable amount of surface remained exposed to the X-rays. To verify the bulk composition we dissolved a film in acid and used inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) to measure the concentration of cations in the solution. The ICP-MS measured atomic ratio was 46.6:45.8:6.0:1.6, which closely matched the QCM measurements indicating that the surface concentration was different from the bulk material. Mo and W have similar atomic radii, but W may be more likely to segregate. As observed in by XRD, W began to segregate out of BiVO4 and form WO3 at concentrations higher than 2.5%. Mo and W incorporation may have caused a reduction in the oxidation state of Bi or V below the surface, which also could not be detected by XPS surface measurements. For the repeat measurement 41 days after annealing, the peaks were at same binding energy locations (within ± 0.1 eV) but the FWHM of the V 2p 3/2, Mo 3d 5/2, and W 4f 7/2 peaks had decreased slightly. In addition the O 1s peak developed a shoulder between 531 and 535 eV (see Fig. 9). XPS measurements for 2.5% W BiVO4 and 5% Mo BiVO4 also showed a slight decrease in the FWHM for the V 2p 3/2, Mo 3d 5/2, and W 4f 7/2 peaks and development of a shoulder on the O 1s peak. Surface science studies of other metal oxides such as MgO and TiO2 have demonstrated that dissociative water adsorption can lead to a high binding energy shoulder at ∼532 eV on the O 1s peak.52,53 It can be attributed to the oxygen in hydroxyls binding at defect sites.54 The development of the shoulder on Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 films is noteworthy because it suggests that the Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 films have surface defects or O vacancies. These surface defects might be passivated over time reducing the number of electron-hole traps on the surface and improving the photoactivity for PEC water oxidation. Passivation of surface defects may also occur when the films are held at a positive potential in solution leading to the initial increase in photocurrent observed during amperometric i-t scans (see Fig. 6 inset).

3.3 Photoelectrochemical performance
It has been suggested that poor charge transport is a major limiting factor for the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 based materials.29,55 Poor charge transport in BiVO4 can lead to electron-hole recombination in the bulk material, across particulate networks, and at the BiVO4-FTO interface.29,55–57 One way to improve charge transport through the bulk BiVO4 material is with incorporation of impurities such as Mo and W. Experimental data from Hoffart et al. showed that 5% Mo doped BiVO4 had a total conductivity at least an order of magnitude higher than BiVO4 at 600 °C.58 DFT calculations suggest that doping Mo and W into BiVO4 results in better separation of the excited electron-hole pairs and enhanced charge carrier mobility.28 Recombination across particulate networks can be overcome by synthesis techniques that result in a film with a continuous conduction path from the film surface to the FTO, such as ballistic deposition at a deposition angle of γ = 55°. As shown in the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 3), the 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films were composed of continuous columns that extend all the way to the BiVO4-FTO interface. The pores between columns allow the electrolyte to penetrate deeply into the film reducing the cumulative charge transport length between the location of electron-hole generation and the BiVO4-electrolyte interface. Problems with recombination near the BiVO4-FTO interface can be assessed by comparing frontside illumination (light source facing the electrolyte-BiVO4 interface) with backside illumination (light source facing the BiVO4-FTO interface). When a semiconductor film is irradiated the higher energy wavelengths will usually be absorbed at shorter depths; i.e., closer to the light source. Thus, for backside illumination the higher energy electron-hole pairs will be generated closer to the film-FTO interface. If recombination at the film-FTO interface is a major problem then backside illumination should lead to lower IPCE values than frontside illumination for higher energy wavelengths in the range of 350–425 nm (the FTO rather than the film will likely absorb light wavelengths below 350 nm). This behavior has been observed for α-Fe2O3 films, which appear to have excessive electron-hole recombination near the film-FTO interface.59,60 For pure and Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 we observed higher overall photocurrent densities and IPCE values for backside illumination compared to frontside for nearly all wavelengths of light including 360–425 nm. The frontside and backside illumination chopped LSV scans for a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film are included in Fig. 6 and the IPCE values are included in Fig. 10. The higher IPCE values for backside illumination for nearly all wavelengths of light suggests that recombination at the BiVO4-FTO interface is not the most significant limiting factor for the photoactivity. Moreover, the results reveal another unique aspect of Mo and W containing BiVO4 films synthesized by ballistic deposition. The lower photocurrent densities and IPCE values for frontside illumination are most likely caused diffuse scattering of incident light by the uneven surface structure at the electrolyte-BiVO4 interface, which blocks light from being absorbed. For backside illumination light is not diffusely scattered until it travels all the way through the film, and some of this light will actually be scattered back into the film giving it another chance at being absorbed. To verify this we conducted frontside and backside illumination PEC tests on a 6% Mo, 2% W film. Then we brushed the front of the film with a clean latex glove to remove some of the irregular surface structure and repeated the frontside and backside measurements. After brushing the film surface the photocurrent density increased for frontside illumination but decreased for backside. In addition, SEM images reveal fewer wires and intermittent features protruding out of the film surface after it was brushed. Chopped LSV scans, SEM images, and UV-vis absorbance spectra for the brushed film are included in the Supporting Information (Fig. S8, S9, and S10).
 Fig. 10  IPCE measurements conducted at (a) 1.1 V vs. RHE and (b) 1.6 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) with white light illumination (frontside and backside). The films were pure BiVO4, 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4, and 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 with Pt photo-deposited on the surface. The error bars represent one standard deviation. 
Even after addressing the poor charge transport issues associated with BiVO4, another significant limiting factor remains. As demonstrated by the chopped LSV scans in Fig. 5, both pure and Mo and W containing BiVO4 films suffered from slow water oxidation kinetics and recombination at the surface (electrolyte-BiVO4 interface). Pure BiVO4 did not show a significant increase in photocurrent until potentials were more positive than 1.0 V vs. RHE, which is well beyond the estimated flat band potential of 0.0–0.05 V vs. RHE. Mo and W incorporation improved the onset potential slightly and resulted in a steeper slope for the white light portion of the chopped LSV, but the photocurrent still did not reach saturation, even at potentials more positive than 1.23 V vs. RHE where water oxidation is thermodynamically possible even without illumination. One method for overcoming the slow kinetics and surface recombination of BiVO4 is with the addition of an electrocatalyst. Ye et al. recently conducted an SECM study of W doped BiVO4 comparing the effectiveness of different electrocatalysts including IrOx, Pt, Co3O4, and cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi).61 Other groups have recently explored the use of Co-Pi on Mo and W doped BiVO4 films.62–64 Of these catalysts Pt and Co-Pi appeared to be the most effective. Optically transparent Pt layers can be photo-deposited onto semiconductor films using a variety of solutions containing H2PtCl661,65,66 As a final test of the 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film, we photo-deposited a layer of Pt onto the surface by immersing it in a solution of 10 mM H2PtCl6 and 0.2 M methanol under backside illumination. The IPCE values and chopped LSV scans for this film are included in Fig. 10 and 11. The chopped LSV scans for 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 with Pt show a sharp increase in anodic photocurrent at 0.6 V vs. RHE. Between 0.6 and 1.23 V vs. RHE the photocurrents are drastically higher than for the film without an electrocatalyst in Na2SO4. The photocurrent for the film with Pt photo-deposited on the surface in Na2SO4 was only about 10% lower than the photocurrent observed for the film without an electrocatalyst in Na2SO3 solution, which can be used to estimate the obtainable photocurrent after overcoming the slow kinetics of water oxidation. In addition, the IPCE values for the film with Pt were much higher than for the film without an electrocatalyst (Fig. 10). The 6% Mo, 2% BiVO4 film with Pt photo-deposited on the surface had IPCE values above 35% at 1.1 V vs. RHE and above 50% at 1.6 V vs. RHE for light wavelengths between 360 and 450 nm. Integration of the IPCE values over the AM1.5 solar spectrum results in current densities of 1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.1 V vs. RHE and 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE, which is on par with other benchmark materials used for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.13,67 Previously it was reported that drop-cast BiVO4 films with Pt photo-deposited remained stable for at least 6 h.61 Our vacuum deposited 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 with Pt did not appear to be stable when illuminated in electrolyte for long periods of time and the use of Pt would not be ideal in a large scale water splitting system since Pt is a rare metal. Nevertheless, these PEC results show the potential of Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 films when combined with a suitable electrocatalyst material. After we completed our study J.A. Seabold et al. demonstrated that photo-deposited FeOOH is a highly active and stable water oxidation catalyst for pure BiVO4.68 It would be interesting to test Mo and W incorporated BiVO4 films with additional electrocatalysts such as FeOOH.

LSV scans (dark and white light) for a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film without an electrocatalyst in 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8). Measurements were conducted with backside illumination at 73 mW cm−2 and a scan rate of 0.025 V s−1. 
4. Conclusions
We have incorporated Mo and W into porous, nanostructured BiVO4 films to improve the performance for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. For ballistic deposition of Bi, V, Mo and W at a deposition angle of 55° the optimal levels for individual incorporation were 2.5% W BiVO4 and 5% Mo BiVO4, which resulted in photocurrent densities that were 7 and 8 times higher than for pure BiVO4, respectively. Further improvement was observed for co-incorporation of Mo and W. The optimal level for co-incorporation was found to be 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4, which had photocurrent densities that were 10 times higher than for pure BiVO4 and higher than has been previously reported for Mo and W incorporated BiVO4. The 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 films remained fairly stable throughout photoelectrochemical testing and improved in performance with age. The films consisted of a porous, nanocolumnar layer beneath an irregular surface structure that scattered light. Backside illumination could be used to reflect some of this scattered light back into the film for utilization, which resulted in 30–45% higher photocurrent densities than frontside illumination. The films showed some kinetic limitations for the water oxidation reaction as the maximum photocurrent densities could only be achieved at potentials well positive of the flat band potential. This was overcome by photo-deposition of Pt onto the surface as an electrocatalyst. For 450 nm light the 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film with Pt on the surface achieved quantum efficiencies of 37% at 1.1 V vs. RHE and 50% at 1.6 V vs. RHE. However, the films with Pt did not show long term stability and continued research is needed to optimize the photoactivity and stability of BiVO4 based materials for use in a practical water splitting system.

 	Fig. 2  Top view SEM images of a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film deposited in vacuum at a deposition angle of γ = 55° (a) as deposited and (b) after annealing in air at 500 °C for 2 h.	 

 	Fig. 3  Cross-sectional view SEM image of a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 film deposited in vacuum at a deposition angle of γ = 55° and annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h.	 

 	Fig. 4  Steady-state photocurrent density values under visible and white light illumination (frontside) at 1.1 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) for BiVO4 films with (a) incorporation of Mo or W individually and (b) co-incorporation of Mo and W. The atomic % is relative to the total amount of Bi, V, Mo, and W (excluding oxygen content). The white light illumination power density was 73 mW cm−2. Error bars represent one standard deviation.	 

 	Fig. 5  Chopped (dark and white light) LSV scans for BiVO4 films with varying atomic percentages of Mo and W (relative to the total Bi, V, Mo, and W) with frontside or backside illumination as indicated. Measurements were conducted in (a) 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) or (b) 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The illumination power density at the film surface was 73 mW cm−2 and the scan rate was 0.025 V s−1.	 

 	Fig. 6  Amperometric i-t curve for a 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 at a constant applied potential of 1.1 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8). The film was measured 14 days after annealing. Backside illumination was used and the power density at the film surface was 73 mW cm−2. At 1800 s the light was blocked and the film surface was flushed with fresh electrolyte.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) XRD spectra for pure, 5% Mo, and 6% Mo, 2% W BiVO4 with JCPDS peak intensities and locations plotted below the data for monoclinic BiVO4 (PDF#00-014-0688) and SnO2 (PDF#00-046-1088. (b) XRD spectra for 2.5% W and 5% W BiVO4 with the highest intensity JCPDS peak for WO3 (PDF#00-041-0905) labelled at 24°. In both (a) and (b) the * symbol indicates a single peak at 34.9° after Mo and W incorporation rather than two peaks at 34.5° and 35.2° for pure BiVO4.
