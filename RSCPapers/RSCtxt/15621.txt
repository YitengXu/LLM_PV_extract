    , Accepted 6th September 2011First published on 13th October 2011AbstractA TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr three-component nanojunction with enhanced visible-light activity was synthesized by a two-step approach including an electrochemical anodization technique followed by an in situ photo-assisted dipping and deposition approach. Ag/AgBr nanoparticles with good dispersion were effectively deposited on both the inside and outside of the TiO2 nanotubes. Surface photovoltage measurements and luminescence spectra demonstrated that the Ag/AgBr loading enhanced the visible spectral absorption of TiO2 nanotube arrays, as well as their separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, which may due to the nanojunction built between Ag/AgBr and TiO2 in this system. The photoelectrochemical investigations verified that the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction showed enhanced photocurrent generation efficiency and had a more effective photoconversion efficiency of 0.71% than the aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays alone. The enhanced photoelectrochemical properties can be attributed to the extended absorption in the visible light region resulting from Ag/AgBr nanoparticles, and the effective separation of photogenerated carriers driven by the photoinduced potential difference generated at the TiO2/Ag–AgBr nanojunction interface.
1. Introduction
One-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures, especially well aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2-NA) prepared on a Ti foil by the electrochemical anodization method,1–4 have attracted tremendous interest because their unique highly ordered array structure, high specific surface area, unidirectional charge transfer and transportation features make them suitable for a wide range of applications in solar cells,5,6water splitting7,8 and functional devices,9,10etc. However, the poor utilization of solar energy and the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs are the two major factors limiting the further improvement of photoelectrochemical properties. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective solutions to overcome these obstacles.
Forming a nanojunction between TiO2-NA, narrow-band-gap semiconductors such as PbS,11ZnFe2O4,12 CdS,13 and Cu2O,14 and noble metals, including Ag,15–17Au,18 and Pt,19,20 promises an efficient route to address the issues mentioned above. The construction of a three-component nanojunction system promotes the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs within the two semiconductors, while the coupled metal further improves the charge separation efficiency and enlarges the spectral range of light absorption. Tada et al. reported the fabrication of an anisotropic CdS–Au–TiO2 nanojunction with enhanced photocatalytic activity, as a result of vectorial electron transfer driven by the two-step excitation of TiO2 and CdS.21 Zhang et al. reported a simple strategy for constructing an all-solid-state AgBr–Ag–Bi2WO6 nanojunction by a facile deposition-precipitation method, where both AgBr and Bi2WO6 were used as visible-light-driven photochemical systems while Ag was used as an electron-transfer system.22 Hu et al. fabricated the visible-light photocatalyst Ag/AgBr/TiO2 for the destruction of bacteria, where electrons could be injected from the conduction band of AgBr to the valence band of TiO2 by absorbing energy that was lower than that of AgBr and the metallic Ag species could act as an electron trap and acceptor facilitating the electron–hole separation and electron transfer to the catalyst surface.23 However, the energy conversion efficiency is relatively low and it is difficult to separate and recycle the composite powder from the reaction system. To the best of our knowledge, little work has been reported so far concentrating on the photoelectrochemical performance and mechanism of photo-induced electron transfer of TiO2-based three-component systems.
In this work, the ternary nanojuctions comprised of TiO2-NA, AgBr nanoparticles, and metallic Ag nanoparticles were synthesized by a two-step approach, i.e., the electrochemical anodization technique followed by an in situ photo-assisted dipping and deposition approach. The advantages of combining self-assembled TiO2-NA with metallic Ag nanoparticles and semiconductor AgBr are that they help absorb incident photons more efficiently and transport the excited electrons to the back contact with less loss of charge recombination. The promoting effect of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction on the photoelectrochemical performance was observed and the correlation between the structure and the property was discussed based on the results of a systematic characterization.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction
Highly ordered TiO2-NA were fabricated by anodization of Ti foil in 0.2 wt % HF electrolyte (50 mL) with a Pt counter electrode under 20 V for 30 min as previously described in our group.14 A subsequent heating at 500 °C for 1 h with a heating and cooling rate of 2 °C min−1 in air was applied to achieve the crystallization of the TiO2-NA before Ag/AgBr deposition.

          Ag/AgBr/TiO2-NA was developed by a photo-assisted dipping and deposition technique. First, TiO2-NA was immersed in 100 mL of distilled water and sonicated for 30 min, followed by the addition of 1.2 g of cetylmethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to the suspension and stirring magnetically for another 30 min. Then, 0.21 g of AgNO3 in 2.3 mL of NH4OH was quickly added to the mixture with the aid of photo-irradiation provided by a 500 W xenon lamp, and the resulting suspensions were stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The resulting sample was further dried at 70 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the dipping and deposition process was repeated for 3 cycles, producing a light yellow sample due to Ag/AgBr nanoparticles being deposited on the TiO2-NA. Finally, the prepared sample was calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h. As a reference, Ag/TiO2-NA was prepared by reducing the Ag+ ions photo-catalytically using 0.21 g of AgNO3 in 2.3 mL of NH4OH solution as a Ag precursor and methanol solution as a hole scavenger under 500 W xenon lamp irradiation.
2.2 Characterization
The morphology of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction was characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; Quanta 200 FEG) with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted with a JEOL-2010 electron microscope, using a 200 kV accelerating voltage. The crystallinity of the prepared samples was determined from XRD using a diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (Shimadzu Lab-X XRD-6000, source light at a wavelength λ = 0.15406 nm). The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured under the diffuse reflection mode using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, UV-550) with application of the Kubelka–Munk theory. Fine BaSO4 powder was used as a standard for the baseline, and the spectra were recorded in the range from 300 to 700 nm. XPS (PHI 5600 mode) was performed to examine the surface properties and composition of the sample. All the binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminant carbon (C 1s) at 284.6 eV as a reference. Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Renishaw inVia Reflex spectrometer equipped with an optical microscope. For excitation, the 514.5 nm line from an Ar+ ion laser (Spectra Physics) was focused, with an analyzing spot of about 1 μm, on the sample under the microscope. The power of the incident beam on the sample was 1 mW. Photoluminescence spectra were measured at room temperature using an RPM2000 spectrophotometer (ACCENT Semiconductor Technologies Ltd., UK) with a He-Cd laser (λ = 325 nm) as the light source. The separation characteristics of photogenerated charge carriers were tested by a lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system, which consists of a monochromator (model Omni-λ3005) and a lock-in amplifier (model SR830-DSP) with an optical chopper (model SR540) running at a frequency of 20 Hz. The phase spectra were recorded synchronously with the a.c. SPV spectra by the computer. All of the SPV measurements were performed at room temperature.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
To evaluate the photoconversion efficiency and charge transfer property of the nanojunction as prepared, the photocurrent density was measured using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments 760C, Shanghai Chenhua, China) in a standard three-electrode configuration with the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction as photoanode (an effective area of 6 cm2), a Pt foil as counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, and 0.01 M Na2SO4 (100 mL) purged with N2 as the electrolyte. A 500 W high-pressure xenon short arc lamp (Phillips) with a filter to remove light of wavelengths below 420 nm was used as the visible light source to provide a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured with a radiometer (Photoelectric Instrument Factory Beijing Normal University, model FZ-A). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz with an a.c. voltage amplitude of 10 mV at a d.c. bias of 0.3 V (vs. the SCE) in a 0.01 M Na2SO4 solution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic route to the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. The highly ordered TiO2-NA was firstly prepared by an electrochemical anodization method. Secondly, Ag/AgBr nanoparticles were synthesized by reacting CTAB with AgNO3 in NH4OH solution and then a certain amount of Ag+ ions in the surface region of the AgBr nanoparticles was converted to Ag nanoparticlesvia a light-induced chemical reduction.24 In this process, CTAB not only supplied bromide to precipitate Ag+ in solution, but also could adsorb onto the surface of TiO2 to limit the number of nucleation sites for an Ag/AgBr island to grow, achieving a uniform deposition of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles on the TiO2-NA.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. 

Fig. 1a shows a typical ESEM image of the vertically oriented TiO2-NA, which reveals a regularly arranged nanotube structure. The average diameter of these nanotubes is about 90 nm with a wall thickness of 15 nm. A cross-sectional image of the TiO2-NA shows that the nanotubes of approximately 700 nm in length are compact and grow vertically from the Ti substrate (inset of Fig. 1a). Through the photo-assisted dipping and deposition process, it is found that the surface of the TiO2-NA is extensively covered by highly dispersed Ag/AgBr nanoparticles with a small average diameter of 20 nm (Fig. 1b). Shown in Fig. 1c is a tilted top-view ESEM image of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction, revealing that the Ag/AgBr nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on both the outside and inside (inset of Fig. 1c) of the nanotubes without blocking the channels. However, the number of nanoparticles is lower within the tubular structure (marked with arrows) than on the top of the tubes due to the high interfacial tension of the TiO2 nanotubes.25 Moreover, closer observation reveals that a well-ordered nanotube structure still exists after the photo-assisted dipping and deposition process, suggesting that the Ag/AgBr nanoparticle deposition process does not damage the ordered TiO2-NA structure (Fig. 1d).

(c) Tilted top-view ESEM image of TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. (d) Top-view ESEM image of TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction at high magnification. 
The microscopic structure of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction was further investigated by TEM. It is clearly seen that the pure TiO2-NA has an ordered tubular structure and the tube wall is very smooth (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b is a TEM image of the TiO2-NA after the deposition of Ag/AgBr particles, showing that the Ag/AgBr nanoparticles formed from photochemical precipitation are dispersed and are visible on the outer and inner walls of the TiO2-NA, which is consistent with our ESEM observations. Additionally, Ag/AgBr nanoparticles show near spherical shapes with a relatively uniform size distribution around 20 nm in diameter and are well adsorbed on the TiO2-NA.

The crystal structure of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction was revealed by XRD analysis (Fig. 3). For comparison, the XRD pattern from the plain TiO2-NA is also given. All peaks in the curve a can be well-indexed by the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 71-1167) and Ti metal phase (JCPDS No. 44-1294), which are originated from the TiO2-NA and Ti substrate, respectively. Curve b of the Ag/TiO2-NA exhibits an additional peak corresponding to the metallic Ag <200> plane at 2θ = 44.3°.26 However, the strongest peak of Ag <111> is not visible as it might be masked by the Ti substrate peak at 2θ = 38.4°, and other diffraction peaks could not be seen due to the uniformly small and well dispersed Ag particles. Compared to the TiO2-NA, the XRD pattern of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction (curve c) shows that there are two additional peaks with 2θ values of 31.0 and 44.3° corresponding to the <200> and <220> crystal planes of cubic AgBr, respectively.22 However, the metallic Ag diffraction peak at 2θ = 44.3° is not displayed in the composite system, indicating that the metallic Ag might be covered up by the peak attributed to AgBr at 2θ = 44.3°. So it is difficult to draw any conclusions concerning the existence of Ag in the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction from the XRD measurements.

Fig. 4a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. The spectrum obtained from the pure TiO2-NA shows that TiO2 primarily absorbs ultraviolet light with a maximum absorption wavelength around 350 nm, which is ascribed to the charge transfer process from the valence band formed by the 2p orbital of the oxide anions to the conduction band formed by the 3dt2g orbital of the Ti4+ cations.27 However, Ag/TiO2-NA displays a significant enhancement of the light absorption in both the UV and visible light range of 300–560 nm with a peak at about 423 nm, which is due to the surface plasmon absorption of spatially confined electrons in Ag nanoparticles.28,29 Further comparison indicates that the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction has much stronger light absorption in the wavelength ranging from 300 to 700 nm. The result indicates that visible-light absorption of the TiO2-NA is obviously enhanced by introducing Ag/AgBr nanoparticles, and that the nanojunction shows the best visible-light absorption, due to the surface plasmon absorption of Ag nanoparticles and light absorption by AgBr nanoparticles.

diffuse reflectance spectra (a) and normalized UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (b) of TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. 
As shown in Fig. 4b, the normalized UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the TiO2-NA shows a broad band absorption in the ultraviolet region and little adsorption in the visible-light region. The onset of the absorption edge for the TiO2-NA is about 410 nm with a broad absorption band centered at 350 nm, which is not consistent with the optical band-gap absorption of pure anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV). Slight red-shifts of the absorption edge and the highest absorption peak are observed, which may be attributed to the formation of bulk or surface structural defects.30 The presence of structural defects such as bulk or surface Ti3+ states or oxygen vacancies of the as-prepared TiO2-NA can not only enhance absorption of visible-light but also promote the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes.7,31 Moreover, the TiO2-NA also show a broad absorption around 410–700 nm, probably caused by the trapped charge carriers, some color centers or the absorption of incident light by the nanotube arrays, which is similar to previous reports.32,33 Interestingly, in comparison with TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction both exhibit blue-shifted absorption edges and maximum absorption wavelengths belonging to TiO2. The loading of the Ag nanoparticles and Ag/AgBr nanoparticles on the support of the TiO2-NA partly may cover the bulk or surface Ti3+ states and oxygen vacancy sites, affecting the optical properties of TiO2-NA. However, on the whole, the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction has the largest light absorption intensity compared with other two samples due to the sensitization of the Ag/AgBr nanoparticles.
The elemental compositions and chemical status of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction were analyzed by XPS. The XPS full spectrum of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction confirmed the existence of Ti, O, Ag, Br, N and C elements (Fig. 5a). In Fig. 5b, XPS peaks of Br 3d located at 68.8 and 67.4 eV could be assigned to the spectra of Br 3d3/2 and Br 3d5/2 for Br− in AgBr.34Fig. 5c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Ag of Ag/TiO2-NA (curve A) and the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction (curve B). The XPS spectrum confined to the Ag window (curve A) provides the binding energies of the Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 peaks as 374.3 and 368.3 eV, respectively, which reveals that the Ag species exists predominantly in the metallic form.28 Meanwhile, the 6.0 eV gap between the two states is also characteristic of metallic Ag. For curve B, the peaks ascribed to Ag 3d exhibit a negative shift, which is different from the pure metallic Ag. It might be due to the interaction between Ag nanoparticles and AgBr particles. The above XRD analysis has confirmed that metallic Ag and AgBr coexist in the sample. Therefore, the combination of XPS and XRD analysis confirms that there are both Ag and AgBr species in the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction system.

Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of the TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. Well-resolved Raman scattering peaks of TiO2-NA are observed at 146.8, 198.6, 394.1, 513.5 and 637.0 cm−1, corresponding to the Raman-active modes of anatase with the symmetries of Eg, Eg, B1g, A1g and Eg, respectively.35 The strongest scattering peak of TiO2-NA (Raman shift at 146.8 cm−1) became broader and weaker and red shifted by 2.6 cm−1 after the deposition of Ag/AgBr. This result suggests increasing crystalline defects within the frame-work, which might be ascribed to the distortion of anatase crystalline lattice induced by the Ag/AgBr-modification.36

The photoluminescence is related to the behavior of charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer and reflects the separation and recombination of photo-induced charge carriers; thus it is often used to primarily evaluate the recombination rate of charge carriers.37 Actually, the luminescence spectra of the TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction are compared mainly to identify the relative probabilities of luminescence occurrence and the energy relaxation pathway via charge recombination for different samples, which can further help us to speculate on the relative likelihood of other energy relaxation pathways (such as, photovoltage, photothermal, etc.). Normally, there are at least three main steps during the luminescence processes. Firstly, the photoabsorption process occurring on the femto-second time scale is one of the most significant steps in the whole luminescence process. Then the photoexcited electrons and holes by the absorbed incident photons are located in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. Next, a part of the photogenerated charge carriers recombine radiatively in the band-edge state very quickly within pico-second time scales to give rise to the most luminescent signals.38 Meanwhile, another part of them could relax to the surface, be trapped on shallow-trap surface states and then take part further in the photocatalytic reaction (this part does not contribute to the luminescence), which takes place on the milli-second time scale. These portions of charges could be detected by the surface photovoltage technique.39 Meanwhile, the electrons trapped on the surface states can also recombine with the holes as a secondary electron trapping process, which may result in a few luminescence signals. When the energy of incident light is constant, various energy relaxation pathways of the photoexcited electrons, such as luminescence, photovoltage, photothermal, etc. are competitive with each other and determine the optical activity of materials. Generally speaking, lower luminescence intensity may suggests a higher electron–hole separation rate and consequently a longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers neglecting the photothermal effect.40Fig. 7 shows that the photoluminescence intensities of TiO2-NA decrease with the addition of the Ag/AgBr nanoparticles, which reveals that the deposition Ag/AgBr nanoparticles decreases the density of the charge recombination center for luminescence. The Ag/AgBr nanoparticles anchored on TiO2-NA act as traps to capture the photoinduced electrons from TiO2, and thus effectively inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
 Fig. 7  
Photoluminescence spectra of the TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. 
Furthermore, the luminescence quantum yield (Φ) of the TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction was compared to reflect their efficiencies in charge separation. It can be defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.Φ = (Number of photon emitted/Number of photons absorbed) × 100
According to the above results of the UV-vis diffuse reflectance and luminescence spectra, we can semi-quantitatively compare the luminescence quantum yield of the TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction by the peak areas. When the energy of incident light is constant, for the TiO2-NA, it has much weaker photons absorbed in the wavelength ranging from 300 to 600 nm than that of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction (Fig. 4a). However, the greater number of photons (higher luminescence intensity) emitted by the TiO2-NA than the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction could be inferred by Fig. 7. This result shows the luminescence quantum yield of the TiO2-NA is much higher than that of TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. The significantly decreased luminescence quantum yield of the TiO2-NA after the loading of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles implies the enhanced separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by surface modification.
A lock-in-based SPV measurement was carried out to confirm the efficient charge separation of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. Fig. 8 shows the SPV spectra and corresponding phase spectra of the TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. In contrast, no SPV response is observed for Ti substrate upon the light excitation in the range 300–600 nm (Fig. 8a). The distinct SPV response of TiO2-NA appears only in the UV light region due to the transition of the O2− anti-bonding orbital to the lowest empty orbital of Ti4+ (band-to-band transition). In contrast, Ag/TiO2-NA exhibits a much higher SPV response than that of pure TiO2-NA. Metallic noble metals have a Fermi level lower than the conduction band of most semiconductors and can collect free electron from the semiconductors.41 The Ag nanoparticles thus serve as efficient electron traps to avoid electron–hole recombination. Besides the UV response below 400 nm, this sample also displays a broad SPV response in the 410–550 nm range, with a maximum at about 470 nm, which should be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance effect of the Ag nanoparticles loaded at the surface of TiO2. In addition, it is worth noting that the SPV response of the TiO2-NA was obviously enhanced after the loading of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles, indicating the higher separation efficiency and the longer lifetime of the charges as compared with those of TiO2-NA and Ag/TiO2-NA.42 Meanwhile, an enhanced SPV band edge with the tail extending to 600 nm was also observed for the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction.
 Fig. 8  The a.c. SPV spectra (a) of the Ti substrate, TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction and the corresponding phase spectra (b). 
In Fig. 8b, the corresponding phase spectra show the statistic kinetic characteristics for each a.c. SPV spectrum with a distinguishable response.43 For the three curves, the phase values are under zero, which corresponds to a positive SPV signal.44 This sign means that the photogenerated electrons generally transfer towards the Ti substrate from the direction of light incidence. Curve C represents the phase spectrum corresponding to the a.c. SPV spectrum of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. The phase retardation relative to 0° with a value of about 18.5° at 400 nm, which is much larger than those of Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2-NA, reflects their discrepant features of photogenerated charge transfer kinetics. Larger absolute phase retardation means the a.c. SPV amplitude in one excitation period will take a longer time to reach the balance or saturated value, statistically. Together with the larger SPV response amplitude for the composite, it is indicated that the photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction have higher separation efficiency. Hence, an improved photoelectrochemical activity of the composite can be expected.
3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties

Fig. 9a shows the curves of photocurrent density versus the applied potential for the TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction. Upon irradiation, the photocurrent density of the three samples gradually increases with increasing the applied potential, indicating the electric field caused photogenerated electron–hole pair separation.45,46 It is obvious that a maximum photocurrent density of 0.59 mA cm−2 is obtained for the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction, while only 0.36 mA cm−2 for Ag/TiO2-NA and 0.21 mA cm−2 for pure TiO2-NA are observed. Higher photocurrent density means that more photoinduced electrons can transfer from the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction to the counter electrodevia the external circuit. Our results indicate that better photoinduced charge generation, separation and transport occur in the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction than in Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2-NA, which may be attributed to the introduction of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles and the formation of the nanojunction. The formation of the nanojunction structure benefits separation of photoinduced charge carriers and improves the energy conversion efficiency of the absorbed photons. Moreover, the open circuit potential, Voc, which corresponds to the difference between the apparent Fermi level of the work electrode and the reference electrode, is around 0.60 V for the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction, which is greater than that obtained with Ag/TiO2-NA (0.32 V) and TiO2-NA (0.07 V), respectively, demonstrating a shift in the Fermi level to a more negative potential as a result of the loading of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles.
 Fig. 9  (a) Variation of photocurrent density vs. bias potential (vs.SCE), (b) photoconversion efficiency as a function of applied potentials (vs.SCE), and (c) short-circuit photocurrent density vs. time for the TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction in 0.01 M Na2SO4 solution under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm, I0 = 100 mW cm−2). 
The photoconversion efficiency η, that is the light energy to chemical energy conversion efficiency, is calculated as12η(%) = [(total power output − electrical power input)/light power input] × 100 = jp[Erev° − |Eapp|] × 100/(I0)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpErev° is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of incident light (mW cm−2). Erev° is the standard state reversible potential (which is 1.23 V (vs.NHE), the potential corresponding to the Gibbs free energy change per photon in the water-splitting reaction at pH = 0), and the applied potential is Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs.SCE) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs.SCE) of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions, under the same illumination, and in the same electrolyte.
A maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.71% for the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction is achieved at 0.09 V vs.SCE, which is 2.73 and 5.07 times as much as those of the Ag/TiO2-NA (0.26%) and the TiO2-NA (0.14%), respectively (Fig. 9b). The transient photocurrent responses of the three samples are measured via several on-off cycles of irradiation. The rise and fall of the photocurrent corresponds well to the switching on and off of the irradiation. The photocurrent value goes down to zero as soon as the irradiation of light on the photoanode is stopped, and the photocurrent comes back to the original value as soon as light is switched on again and irradiates the electrode. It indicates that the current is completely due to the photoactivity of the electrode and that the charge transport is very fast. As shown in Fig. 9c, the TiO2-NA shows low transient photocurrent density under visible light irradiation, and the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction exhibits much higher transient photocurrent density than that of Ag/TiO2-NA. The transient photocurrent density of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction is about 0.54 mA cm−2, higher than those over the Ag/TiO2-NA (0.34 mA cm−2) and TiO2-NA (0.23 mA cm−2) by a factor of 1.59 and 2.35 (vs.SCE). This result demonstrates that the loading of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles could improve the photogenerated electron–hole pair's separation, suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge and obviously enhance the absorption of visible light, which is in accordance with the SPV measurements.
The photoinduced charge transport properties of the TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction are further investigated by EIS. Fig. 10 shows typical EIS Nyquist plots of the TiO2-NA, Ag/TiO2-NA and TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction under dark and visible light irradiation. In the dark, it is clearly observed that the radius of the arc on the EIS Nynquist plot of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction is lower than that of TiO2-NA and Ag/TiO2-NA (Fig. 10a). This indicates that the charge transfer resistance decreases after the deposition of Ag/AgBr nanoparticles. The decrease in resistance reveals that the photo-assisted dipping and deposition technique employed here gives rise to a good interaction of the Ag/AgBr nanoparticles with the TiO2-NA (better ohmic contacts), and consequently leads to an efficient and faster charge transfer path from the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction to the Ti substrate.47 Under visible light irradiation, the arc radius on the EIS Nynquist plot of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction is smaller than that of TiO2-NA and Ag/TiO2-NA, which means that an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and fast interfacial charge transfer to the electron donor/electron acceptor after TiO2-NA is modified by Ag/AgBr nanoparticles under visible light irradiation (Fig. 10b).48

3.3 Discussion of charge transfer mechanism
On the basis of the former characterization, a charge transfer mechanism for the enhanced photoconversion efficiency of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction is proposed, as displayed in Scheme 2. When the system is irradiated with visible light (λ > 420 nm), the electron–hole pairs are generated from both plasmon-excited Ag nanoparticles and the photo-excited AgBr semiconductor. Then the photogenerated electrons from the plasmon-excited Ag nanoparticles transfer across the interface of the Ag–TiO2 to the surface of the TiO2 nanotubes farthest away from the Ag/AgBr interface, which is unusual for a metal, but the nanometric size of the silver particles and the operation of quantum size effects should be responsible for the occurrence of this mechanism.49 Simultaneously, holes move in the opposite direction from the electrons, and photo-generated holes would be trapped within the surface of the AgBr particles due to the dipolar character of the surface plasmon state of silver nanoparticles,50 causing charge separation to become more efficient.
 Scheme 2  Schematic diagram for the energy band structure of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction and the possible charge transfer process. 
Besides, the photogenerated electrons from the photo-excited AgBr can be injected into the Ag because metallic Ag species on the surface of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction mainly acts as electron traps enhancing the electron and hole separation. After that, the trapped electrons are immediately transferred to the TiO2 conduction band, leaving behind holes in the AgBr valence band. Finally, photogenerated electrons from both plasmon-excited Ag nanoparticles and photo-excited AgBr transfer from the TiO2 nanotube to the barrier layer and then to the Ti substrate and ultimately to the counter electrode under the external electrostatic field. As a result, the photoinduced electrons and holes are effectively separated. The efficient charge separation increases the lifetime of the charge carriers and enhances the efficiency of the interfacial charge transfer to adsorbed substrates, leading to higher a photoconversion efficiency of the TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a well-aligned TiO2-NA with tube length of approximately 700 nm was successfully obtained by anodization of Ti foil, and then Ag/AgBr nanoparticles was decorated onto the outer and inner surface of the TiO2 nanotubes through an in situ photo-assisted dipping and deposition route. The incorporation of Ag/AgBr with TiO2-NA reduced the photogenerated electron–hole recombination rate, and resulted in much enhanced photon absorption and photocurrent generation. The TiO2 nanotube/Ag–AgBr nanojunction showed a marked photocurrent and improved photoconversion efficiency due to better charge separation and collection efficiency under visible light irradiation. The composite materials are expected to have promising applications in photocatalysis, solar cells and other light harvesting devices.
