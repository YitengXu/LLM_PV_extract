    , Accepted 17th August 2017First published on 17th August 2017AbstractWe report full-color quantum-dot-based light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) with high efficiency and long-lifetime by employing high quantum-yield core/shell QDs with thick shells. The increased shell thickness improves the confinement of excitons in the QD cores, and helps to suppress Auger recombination and Förster resonant energy transfer among QDs. Along with optimizing the QD emitting layer thickness and hole transport materials, we achieved significant improvements in device performance as a result of increasing the QD shell thickness to above 5 nm. By using poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-[4-(3-methylpropyl)]-diphenylamine] (TFB) as a HTL with a 38 nm thick QD layer, these QLEDs show maximum current efficiencies of 18.9 cd A−1, 53.4 cd A−1, and 2.94 cd A−1, and peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 10.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6% for red, green, and blue QLEDs, respectively, all of which are well maintained over a wide range of luminances from 102 to 104 cd m−2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blue QLEDs with ηEQE > 15%. Most importantly, these devices also possess long lifetimes with T70 (the time at which the brightness is reduced to 70% of its initial value) of 117 h (red, with an initial luminance of 8000 cd m−2), 84 h (green, 6000 cd m−2) and 47 h (blue, 420 cd m−2). With further optimization of QD processing and device structures, these LEDs based on thick-shell QDs show great promise for use in next-generation full-color displays and lighting devices.
Introduction
Due to their unique size-dependent optical properties, high quantum yield (QY), high stability, and solution processability, quantum dot (QD) based thin films have been applied to a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, biosensors, and field-effect transistors.1–8 Since the report of the first QD-based LEDs (QLEDs) two decades ago,1 this new kind of solid-state electroluminescent device has attracted considerable research attention world-wide.1,9–18 Recent progress in solution-processed (excluding electrodes) multilayer QLEDs has resulted in steadily improved device performance,10,14,18 such as external quantum efficiency (EQE), power efficiency, and peak brightness. For instance, EQEs of green and red QLEDs have already been optimized to higher than 20%, and the power efficiency can exceed 25 lm W−1.15,18 The maximum device brightness of green QLEDs is recorded at 218800 cd m−2,14 which is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that required for solid-state lighting (103–104 cd m−2) or display applications (102–103 cd m−2).19 While there are further opportunities to improve these device performance parameters, it is more crucial to greatly improve the operational lifetime of QLEDs to make them suitable for practical applications. So far, the best reported lifetime of QLEDs has been of the order of 10000 hours (only for red-green QLEDs) when the device is operated at an initial brightness of 100 cd m−2.10,18,20 It generally requires lifetime >10000 hours for all three primary colors (blue, green, red) for displays, and the device needs to be operated at a higher brightness level because of the low aperture ratio in current display designs.21
Generally, various types of II–VI inorganic semiconductors (such as CdSe, CdS, CdSe1−ySy, Cd1−xZnxS, etc.) have been selected as the QD core materials. A wider-band gap semiconductor shell is then epitaxially grown onto the core to achieve stable core/shell QDs with high luminescence quantum yield (QY).22 Overcoating a <3 nm thick shell may lead to QY to 60% or higher, resulting in an average QD diameter of approximately 7 to 8 nm.22–24 Such kinds of QDs (as-called “thin shell” QDs) have been widely used to fabricate QLEDs recently.13–15 Most recently, Hollingsworth and co-workers reported the synthesis of a new type of core/shell QD system, so-called “giant” QDs.25–27 With very thick CdS shells, such QDs exhibit optical properties independent of surface ligand coating, significant suppression of blinking, elimination of photo-bleaching, and large Stokes shifts.25 Using these giant core/shell QDs in a simple device architecture led to significant improvements in device performance as compared to similar devices with thin shells (although the maximum quantum efficiency of these devices remains below 0.2%).26
Herein, following optimization of the QY of these thick-shell QDs, we used a multilayer device architecture based on a bilayer structure of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-[4-(3-methylpropyl)]-diphenylamine] (TFB) as the hole injection/transport layer and solution-processed ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as the electron injection/transport layer to assess the effect of thick-shell QDs on the performance of QLEDs. Significantly improved efficiency and brightness compared to previous reports14,15,28 have been obtained, which were attributed to the balanced exciton formation and efficient exciton recombination within QD-based active layers. These devices have maximum luminous current efficiencies of 18.9 cd A−1, 53.4 cd A−1, and 2.94 cd A−1, and peak EQEs of 10.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6% for red, green, and blue QLEDs, respectively, all of which are well maintained over a wide range of luminances from 102 to 104 cd m−2. In particular, the blue and green QLEDs show a high EQE which is more than 15%. Furthermore, these red, green, and blue QLEDs exhibit T70 (the time at which the brightness is reduced to 70% of its initial value) of 117 h (with an initial brightness of L0 = 8000 cd m−2), 84 h (L0 = 6000 cd m−2), and 47 h (L0 = 420 cd m−2), respectively.
Results and discussion
QDs and QLED device structure
It has been well known that the shell growth is a “must-have” process to boost the QY and increase the stability of QDs as compared to core-only QDs. But the thin-shell QDs may still have insufficient chemical/photostability and extensive self-reabsorption when packed in high densities or in thick films.29–31 Thick-shell QDs can readily overcome these issues because they show higher stability, ligand independence, minimal self-reabsorption loss, and fewer QY changes in films due to increased spacing between the cores in different thick-shell QDs in the films. All of these advantages suggest that thick-shell QDs are potential good candidates for QLEDs. However, QYs for thick-shell QDs were previously reported between 10% and 50%, which are far below most thin-shell QD's QYs (in the 80% to 100% range). Here, by controlling shell growth and minimizing lattice distortion, we have successfully synthesized various thick-shell colloidal QDs with high QYs, including ZnxCd1−xS/ZnS, Zn1−xCdxSe/ZnS, and CdSe/CdS/ZnxCd1−xS/ZnS as the blue, green, and red emitters, respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) QYs for these thick-shell QDs are well controlled in the range of 75–100%. These QDs were synthesized and purified according to our recent reports with some modifications;32–34 all surface-modified QDs used in the fabrication of QLEDs are treated according to our previous work,12 and the detailed information is available in the ESI.† The absorption and PL spectra of these thick-shell QDs are shown in Fig. S1.† The PL peaks of blue, green, and red thick-shell QDs are located at 442 nm, 514 nm, and 618 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm, 40 nm, and 38 nm, respectively. The FWHM of green and red QDs is more than 30 nm; it is increased along with the increase of the shell thickness, and the lattice mismatch between the core and shell materials will induce more defects, and anisotropic growth of QDs, and finally the PL FWHM broadening. Here, the QDs were synthesized by employing the high temperature shell growth and interface alloying process. Although the obtained QDs have a relatively wide FWHM, the PL QYs can still maintain a high level. The absolute PL QY in hexane solution is 93% (blue), 91% (green), and 75% (red), and the average size determined from the transmission electron micrographs (TEM) is 15 ± 1 nm with a highly crystalline structure (Fig. S1†). This corresponds to a typical shell thickness of 5.2 ± 0.5 nm.
We employed a solution-processed, multilayer device architecture (shown in Fig. 1a) to evaluate thick-shell QDs’ performance, which comprises indium–tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/TFB/thick-shell QDs/ZnO/Al. Except for the top Al electrode, all the layers were prepared by the solution-based spin-coating method on prepatterned ITO/glass substrates. The corresponding schematic energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1b. ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were used to form the electron injection/transport layer,13,35 which also serves to block holes from leaking into the Al cathode. Fig. 1c shows the normalized PL and EL spectra along with the photographs of blue, green, and red QLEDs from this work in the inset. EL peaks are located at 445 nm, 517 nm, and 618 nm, respectively. Compared with the corresponding PL spectra, the EL spectra of the blue and green QDs show an approximately 3 nm red shift, whereas there is no obvious peak shift for the EL of the red-emitting QDs. The emission wavelength shift of the dots in the EL spectra vs. PL spectra can be attributed to the following factors. One is the Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) within the QDs,26 especially closely packed quantum dot solids. Another is the strong electric field, which acts to reduce the energy of exciton recombination through the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE),36 a phenomenon in which under an electric field, the valence and conduction bands are tilted and the polarization of electron–hole pairs occurs, which lowers the energetic difference between the electron and hole states, finally leading to a red-shift of emission energy. The thermodynamic effect caused by the charge imbalance in the QLEDs is an important factor as well.37 In a charge imbalanced QLED, excess electrons can accumulate in QD layers, excess electrons may flow through all the layers of devices without recombination, generating substantial Joule heat, and the thermodynamic effects resulted in the EL red-shift of QLEDs. Our QDs with a thick-shell can serve as an effective spacer in reducing the FRET probability between the QDs. Simultaneously, the thicker shells are likely to act as an effective physical barrier to screen the external fields, so here the main cause of the emission wavelength shift of QLEDs is mostly the imbalanced injection which caused the thermodynamic effects. In the QLEDs, the TFB has a shallower HOMO level while the QDs have a very deep valence band energy level, and the ZnO has a very low energy barrier for electron injection from the cathode into the QDs, which can obviously result in imbalanced carrier injection and excess electrons. Compared to ZnCdS/ZnS (blue), ZnCdSe/ZnS (green), and CdSe/CdS/ZnCdS/ZnS (red) QDs, the blue and green QDs as the EML have a larger potential energy barrier at the QD/HTL interface, thus a more charge imbalance which means more influence caused by the thermodynamic effects and the resulting EL red-shift phenomena.

There is no detectable emission from the organic layer or ZnO during the device operation. The FWHMs of the EL peaks are only slightly increased from those of the PL peaks: from 21 to 25 nm for blue, 40 to 45 nm for green, and 39 to 46 nm for red. The EL FWHM is broader than the PL FWHM. It can be attributed to the following two points: (1) the close-packed QD film will lead to the broadening of EL due to FRET.26 (2) EL bandwidth is also field-dependent, becoming broader with higher voltages. The spectral broadening as a function of applied voltage is consistent with the increased LO (longitudinal optical)-phonon coupling expected with larger exciton polarization in the presence of an electric field.36 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S2,† with the increase of the voltage bias applied to the QLEDs, no obvious changes in the EL peak position and FWHM were observed. The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates of the three different colors are (0.143, 0.017), (0.155, 0.736), and (0.626, 0.341). As shown in Fig. 1d, the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard color triangle is almost completely covered by the color gamut of our full-color QLEDs.
Selection of hole transport materials
It is known that the device performance of multilayer organic LEDs can be greatly affected by different hole transport materials (HTLs).38 Generally, a desired hole transport material needs to have an appropriate low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and high hole mobility to facilitate hole injection and transport into the emitting layer. To select the most suitable hole transport materials, poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-[4-(3-methylpropyl)]-diphenylamine] (TFB), poly(9-vinlycarbazole) (PVK), poly(4-butyl-phenyl-diphenyl-amine) (Poly-TPD), 4,4′-bis(carbazole-9-yl)-biphenyl (CBP), and 4,4′,4′′-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenyl-amine (TCTA) (see Table S1 in the ESI† for their energy levels and hole mobilities) have been used to fabricate QLEDs based on the green-emitting thick-shell QDs. Fig. 2 shows the current density–luminance–voltage (J–L–V) characteristics and the current efficiency (ηA) and external quantum efficiency (EQE, ηEQE) of these green emitting QLEDs. The key performance parameters of these devices are also summarized in Table 1. When TFB is used as the HTL, the device has a high peak EQE of ηEQE = 13.6% and a peak luminous efficiency of ηA = 47.3 cd A−1, which are more than ten times higher than those of the CBP-based device and approximately three times higher than those of devices using Poly-TPD and TCTA as HTLs. The device with PVK as the HTL shows relatively high current and quantum efficiencies (approximately 25% lower than those of the TFB device); however, its significantly higher turn-on voltage (VT = 4.5 V, vs. 2.1 V for the TFB device, taken as the voltage corresponding to L = 0.1 cd m−2) resulted in its maximum luminous power efficiency (ηP) being less than 50% of that of the TFB based device. While the HOMO level of PVK is approximately 0.5 eV below that of TFB (see Table S1†), which facilitates hole injection into the emitting layer, it presents a greater challenge for hole injection from the ITO/PEDOT:PSS into the polymer. Moreover, the hole mobility of PVK is nearly four orders of magnitude lower than that of TFB, resulting in higher voltages to operate the PVK-based device. Overall, the highest maximum luminance of Lmax = 89000 cd m−2 and the highest maximum power efficiency of ηP = 35.6 lm W−1 were obtained from the TFB-based green emitting QLEDs. By further optimizing the emitting layer thicknesses, the highest efficiencies of ηA = 52.5 cd A−1 and ηEQE = 15.1% were obtained (corresponding to the TFB/QD/ETL layer thicknesses of ∼40 nm/∼38 nm/∼32 nm, see Fig. S3†).

Selection of the shell thickness of the core/shell QDs
Generally, the shell thickness may influence the bandgap of the core–shell QDs, the electron and hole injection barriers and transport pathways, and the rates of resonance energy transfer and Auger non-radiative recombination among the QDs. We chose green-emitting Zn1−xCdxSe/ZnS core–shell QDs with the same core size (3.8 nm) but different ZnS shell thicknesses (1.4, 2.8, 4.2, and 5.2 nm) to investigate the effect of the shell thickness. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images show reasonable size distributions for these core/shell QDs with average diameters of 6.6 nm, 9.4 nm, 11.8 nm, and 15.1 nm (Fig. 3a). There is no evidence for the presence of an interfacial region between the core and shell; all the HRTEM images show high crystallinity with continuous lattice fringes throughout the entire QDs, which implies that the growth of shells occurs in the regime of coherent epitaxy. The PL spectra of these QDs (see Fig. S4†) show a blue shift with the increase of the shell thickness, from a peak wavelength of 546 nm for the core-only QDs to 514 nm for QDs with a 5.2 nm thick shell, which we attribute to improved exciton confinement and partial formation of alloyed shells. Fig. 3b shows the comparison of luminescence QYs of the QDs with different shells in solution and solid-state films. The QYs increased more significantly for the QD films with the increase of the shell thickness. For instance, the QY of 1.4 nm thick shell QDs was 73% in solution, decreasing to 38% in the solid-state film; however, for 5.2 nm thick shell QDs, the QY has a smaller reduction (both in absolute and relative percentages) from 91% in solution to 79% in films. This can be partially attributed to the suppression of FRET with the increase of the shell thickness or the inter-particle spacing; a higher FRET rate would have extended the diffusion length of the excitons in the QD film and make it more likely for the excitons to find a non-radiative recombination center.
 Fig. 3  QLEDs with variable QD shell thicknesses: (a) high-resolution TEM images of the ZnxCd1−xSe QD core (d = 3.8 nm) and core/shell QDs with different ZnS shell thicknesses (1.4, 2.8, 4.2, and 5.2 nm) (scale bar: 5 nm); (b) comparison of the QYs of QDs with different shell thicknesses in solution and solid-state films; (c) maximum EQE and turn-on voltage as a function of the QD shell thickness; and (d) spectrally adjusted maximum luminous current (ηA) and power (ηP) efficiencies of the QLEDs as a function of the QD shell thickness (using the EL spectra of the device based on 5.2 nm thick shell QDs for all devices here). 

Fig. 3c and d summarize the shell thickness dependencies of various device parameters such as the maximum EQE and turn-on voltage, maximum luminous efficiency, and maximum power efficiency, current density at the maximum EQE, and the maximum luminance (see Fig. S5 and S6† for detailed device performance characteristics). The EQE increases almost linearly with the shell thickness from <5% for the device with core-only QDs to ∼15% for the device with 5.2 nm thick QD shells. The maximum luminance also increases until the shell thickness reaches 4.2 nm, after which it starts to decrease while the EQE is still increasing. The EQE increase with the shell thickness is partially attributed to the increase of the QY of the QDs in films discussed above. In addition, it may also be related to the improved charge balance in the QLEDs with thicker shells. As shown in Fig. S7† for the electron-only and hole-only devices, we observed an increase in the electron current and a decrease in the hole current with the increasing QD shell thickness. Moreover, the turn-on voltage of the QLEDs only slightly increased with the increase of shell thickness, which is strongly correlated with the increase of the bandgap of the QDs (as evidenced by the blue-shifted PL spectra, see Fig. S4†). Due to the spectral shift with the QD shell thickness, it is not very meaningful to directly compare the actual luminous current and power efficiencies (see Fig. S5b†). Hence we have corrected these efficiencies by assuming that they have the same spectrum as the device with 5.2 nm thick shells. As shown in Fig. 3d, the increase of the QD shell thickness results in a significant increase in both ηA and ηP (after the spectral adjustment).
Electroluminescence performances

Fig. 4a and b show the J–L–V characteristics and the luminance dependencies of the luminous current efficiency and EQE for green and red thick-shell QLEDs with the optimal layer thicknesses in the device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/TFB (40 nm)/QDs (∼38 nm)/ZnO (32 nm)/Al (100 nm). The important device performance parameters are also summarized in Table 2. The maximum luminances for the green and red QLEDs reached as high as ∼121000 cd m−2 and ∼62000 cd m−2, respectively, and their turn-on voltages are 2.35 V (green) and 1.95 V (red), which are slightly lower than the respective photon energies corresponding to their emitting peak at (λm = 517 nm for green corresponding to a photon energy of hν = 2.40 eV; λm = 618 nm and hν = 2.01 eV for red). Such sub-bandgap EL can be attributed to the Auger-assisted energy up-conversion process in devices containing ZnO NPs as electron transport layers as we reported previously,13,35 as well as thermal fluctuations for the energy of the injected charges. The maximum EQEs of these devices are 15.4% (green) and 10.2% (red), and the related peak luminous efficiency and maximum power efficiency are 53.4 cd A−1 and 39.1 lm W−1 for the green QLEDs, and 18.9 cd A−1 and 20.6 lm W−1 for the red QLEDs. For the blue QLEDs with the same TFB HTL (labeled as “Blue-1”), a sub-bandgap turn-on voltage of 2.6 V (at L = 0.1 cd m−2), maximum EQE of 11.9%, maximum luminance of 10400 cd m−2, and ηA of 2.26 cd A−1 were achieved (see Fig. 4c and d). A significantly higher EQE of 15.6% was achieved when PVK was used as the HTL; however, the PVK device (“Blue-2”) has a significantly higher turn-on voltage of 5.8 V than the TFB device, which resulted in a lower maximum luminance of 4500 cd m−2 and a lower power efficiency of 1.71 lm W−1 (compared to 2.08 lm W−1 for Blue-1). Overall, it is worth noting that the EQE of these thick-shell QD based LEDs is relatively constant over a wide range of luminance values (two to three orders of magnitude), 10 to 4000 cd m−2 for blue, 300 to 30000 cd m−2 for green, and 25 to 20000 cd m−2 for red. This is indicative of the ability of the thick shells of these QDs to suppress Auger recombination, the rate of which increases with the driving current and charge populations, and clearly demonstrates the potential of these QLEDs for low voltage, high power and tunable brightness applications.

Lifetime of red, green, and blue QLEDs
To test the device operational lifetime, red, green, and blue QLEDs were encapsulated using cover glasses and sealed with UV-curable resins. The devices were tested in air under a constant current operation to achieve an initial brightness of 8000 cd m−2 (J = 41.8 mA cm−2), 6000 cd m−2 (J = 9.2 mA cm−2), and 420 cd m−2 (J = 8.8 mA cm−2) for the red, green, and blue (Blue-1) QLEDs, respectively (the brightness of the blue device is approximately equivalent to that of the green device in terms of photon output, as the value of the photopic luminosity function at the blue emission peak of 445 nm is approximately 1/20 of that at the green emission peak of 517 nm; the operational lifetime of Blue-1 and Blue-2 QLEDs with an initial brightness of 4000 cd m−2 is shown in Fig. S8†). Fig. 5 shows the time dependence of the brightness and applied biases for the red and green devices. The time at which the brightness is reduced to 70% of its initial value, or T70, is 117 h (red), 84 h (green), and 47 h (blue). The operating voltage was increased from 2.47 V to 3.34 V (red), from 2.5 V to 4.4 V (green), and from 3.65 V to 4.53 V (blue) during the same time period. Considering the typical scaling for accelerated lifetime testing of organic light-emitting devices which shows the lifetime scales with L−α (1.5 < α < 2),39,40 we project lifetimes of approximately 84000 h, 2400 h, and 4300 h, for the red, green, and blue device, respectively, with an initial brightness at or equivalent to (in terms of photon output) 1000 cd m−2 for the green device (or 660 cd m−2 for red and 52 cd m−2 for blue). Compared to the current best reported lifetimes of T50 = 95 h for red QLEDs with an initial brightness of 10600 cd m−2, T50 = 320 h for green QLEDs with an initial brightness of 1800 cd m−2,10 and no reports for blue QLEDs, our full-color LEDs with thick-shell QDs deliver remarkable results in device stability. We attribute the long lifetimes of our devices to the ability of the thick QD shells to more effectively confine the excitons in the QD cores and to minimize the impact on the exciton recombination characteristics due to potential changes in the chemical/electronic structures at the QD surfaces during device operation such as oxidation/reduction, ligand attachment/detachment, and other defect formation. Considering the suppression of Auger recombination and good stability of our thick-shell QDs, the main causes of degradation of QLEDs are imbalanced injection resulting in thermodynamic effects. Charge balance in the working QLEDs is an important factor that can exert effects on brightness and lifetime.18 In a charge imbalanced QLED, electron/hole accumulation in QD layers and the respective changes in electric-field profiles can increase driving voltages during device operation. Excess electrons/holes can migrate to charge-transporting layers and generate excited states in the relatively unstable polymeric materials, accelerating degradation of the charge-transporting layers of QLEDs and resulted in a short device-lifetime. Also, excess electrons/holes may flow through all the layers of devices without being recombined, generating substantial Joule heat, and the thermodynamic effects degrade the performance (brightness, efficiency, and lifetime) of the QLEDs. So long-life QLEDs not only need to have a good QD layer but also must have an injection balance structure.
 Fig. 5  The operational lifetime characteristics of red, green, and blue QLEDs. The luminance of QLEDs was measured during the continuous operation at a constant current density corresponding to an initial luminance of 8000 cd m−2 (red), 6000 cd m−2 (green), and 420 cd m−2 (blue). 
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated full-color light-emitting diodes based on high quantum yield thick-shell QDs with high efficiency and long lifetime, through the optimization of the QD shell thickness and the hole transport material. We observe significant improvements in device performance with the increase of the QD shell thickness, which we attribute to the suppression of Auger recombination and Förster resonant energy transfer. Using TFB as the HTL with a QD layer of about 37 nm thick, these red, green, and blue QLEDs have maximum luminous efficiencies of 18.9 cd A−1, 53.4 cd A−1, and 2.94 cd A−1, respectively, and peak external quantum efficiencies of 10.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6%, respectively, all of which are well maintained over more than two orders of magnitude range of luminances around 103 cd m−2. These devices also exhibit a long lifetime with a T70 of 117 h (red, with an initial brightness of 8000 cd m−2), 84 h (green, 6000 cd m−2), and 47 h (blue, 420 cd m−2). There is still room for further improvement in the device performance and operational lifetime through the optimization of thick-shell QD structures, such as the composition and the use of surface ligands, as well as the modification of the device structure and the fabrication method. These thick-shell QLEDs may offer a practicable platform for the realization of QD-based full-color displays and lighting devices in the near future.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CdSe/CdS/ZnxCd1−xS/ZnS core/shell QDs with red emission
Thick-shell QDs with red emission were prepared by a previously reported method with a little change (see the ESI†).16,33 A typical synthesis was performed as follows: 80 mL of ODE and 20 g of ODA were loaded into a 500 mL reaction vessel. The CdSe QDs in hexanes (2.8 × 10−6 mol) were added, and the system was kept at 100 °C under an N2 flow for 30 min to remove the hexanes and other undesired materials of low vapor pressure. Subsequently, the solution was heated up to 240 °C under an N2 flow for the shell growth. To calculate the amount of Cd-precursor for the growth of the first monolayer, we assumed that the surface of the CdSe-cores consists equally of Se- and Cd-atoms and therefore used only half of the amount of calculated Cd-precursor for a complete monolayer. Hence, for the first injection, we used only half of the amount of calculated Cd-precursor solution. This is followed by alternating addition of Cd-, CdZn- or Zn-precursors and sulfur precursors, respectively, the amount of which was calculated from the respective volumes of concentric spherical shells with a thickness of one hypothetical monolayer. An interval of 60–120 min was set for the growth of 3 monolayers CdS, 3 monolayers Cd0.33Zn0.67S, 3 monolayers Cd0.5Zn0.5S, 3 monolayers Cd0.67Zn0.33S, and 3 monolayers ZnS layers. The UV-vis and PL-spectra showed no further changes after this time period. The temperature increased 5 °C after every monolayer being completed until reaching 310 °C.
Synthesis of Zn1−xCdxSe/ZnS core/shell QDs with green emission
Synthesis of the Zn0.8Cd0.2Se core for blue emission is provided in the ESI.† A typical synthesis of thick-shell green emission QDs was performed by following a previously reported method with a little change as follows:32 40 mL of ODE and 10 g of ODA were loaded into a 500 mL reaction vessel. The purified Zn0.8Cd0.2Se QDs (4.5 nm in diameter, 9.1 × 10−7 mol, dissolved in hexanes) were added into the mixture, and the system was kept at 100 °C under a nitrogen flow for 30 min to remove hexanes and other undesirable low vapor pressure materials. Subsequently, the reaction solution was heated to 310 °C under a nitrogen flow and magnetic stirring, and a desired amount of Zn(OA)2 (10 mmol of ZnO was mixed with 15 mL of oleic acid and 5 mL of paraffin was heated to 300 °C to form a clear solution mixture under a N2 flow) and octanethiol (1.2 equivalent amounts refer to Zn(OA)2, diluted in 5 mL ODE) was injected dropwise into the reaction solution at a rate of 6 mL h−1 using a syringe pump. After finishing precursor infusion, the solution was further annealed at 310 °C for 30 min. After the reaction was complete, the temperature was cooled down to room temperature and the QDs were purified using acetone or methanol.
Preparation of ZnxCd1−xS/ZnS core/shell QDs with blue emission34
As a typical synthetic procedure, 0.4 mmol of CdO, 0.1 mmol of ZnO, 15 mL of paraffin oil and 1 mL of OA were placed in a 100 mL round flask. The mixture was heated to 150 °C, degassed under 0.1 Torr pressure for 20 min, filled with N2 gas, and further heated to 300 °C to form a clear solution mixture of Cd(OA)2 and Zn(OA)2. At this temperature, 0.5 mmol of S powder dissolved in 2 mL of ODE was quickly injected into the reaction flask. Samples were extracted to monitor their PL spectra. The growth of the shell started when the QY of the core reached the highest value. For the shell growth reaction, the reaction solution was heated to 310 °C under a nitrogen flow and magnetic stirring, and a desired amount of Zn(OA)2 (10 mmol of ZnO mixed with 15 mL of oleic acid and 5 mL of paraffin was heated to 300 °C to form a clear solution mixture under a N2 flow) and octanethiol (1.2 equivalent amounts refer to Zn(OA)2, diluted in 5 mL ODE) was injected dropwise into the reaction solution at a rate of 6 mL h−1 using a syringe pump. After finishing precursor infusion, the solution was further annealed at 310 °C for 30 min. After the reaction was complete, the temperature was cooled down to room temperature and the QDs were purified using acetone or methanol.
Ligand exchange
0.5 g of purified QDs were first dispersed in 10 mL chlorobenzene, and then 5 mL of octanethiol (OT) was added into the QD dispersion. After stirring at room temperature for 30 min, the QDs were finally purified with acetone at 8000 rpm for 5 min.
Fabrication and characterization of QLEDs
QLEDs were fabricated on patterned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼20 Ω sq−1. The substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, consecutively, for 15 min each, and then treated for 15 min with ozone generated by ultraviolet light in air. These substrates were spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) and baked at 150 °C for 15 min in air. The coated substrates were then transferred to a N2-filled glovebox for spin-coating of the poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-[4-(3-methylpropyl)]-diphenylamine] (TFB), QDs, and ZnO NP layers. ZnO NPs were obtained from NanoPhotonica, Inc. (Gainesville, FL) and used after filtering with a 0.45 μm PVDF filter. The TFB hole-transport layer was spin-coated using 1.5 wt% in chlorobenzene (2000 rpm for 30 s), followed by baking at 110 °C for 30 min. This was followed by spin-coating of QDs (10 mg mL−1, toluene) and ZnO NP (30 mg mL−1, ethanol) layers and then baking at 145 °C for 30 min. These multilayer samples were then loaded into a custom high-vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure, ∼3 × 10−7 Torr) to deposit the top Al cathode (100 nm thick) patterned by an in situ shadow mask to form an active device area of 4 mm2.
Characterization
Room temperature UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded by using an Ocean Optics spectrophotometer (model PC2000-ISA). The absolute PL QYs of QDs were collected through an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer and an Ocean Optics ISP-50-8-I integrating sphere. The optical density (OD) values of the QD samples at the excitation wavelength were all in the range of 0.02–0.05. The excitation light source for blue QDs was a LED with an emission peak at around 380 nm, while a 450 nm LED excitation light source was used for green and red QDs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were performed using a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of QLEDs were obtained using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer with a calibrated Newport silicon diode under ambient conditions. The luminance was calibrated using a Minolta luminance meter (LS-100). The electroluminescence (EL) spectra were obtained with an Ocean Optics spectrometer (USB2000, relative irradiance mode) and a Keithley 2400 source meter.
