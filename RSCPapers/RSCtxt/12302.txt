    , Accepted 7th January 2022First published on 7th January 2022AbstractHeteroatom-doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can change the optical, chemical, electrical, and optoelectrical properties of materials and diversify their functions. GQDs can be used in a wide range of applications, including in fluorescent agents, light-emitting diodes, bioimaging, solar cells, optoelectronic detectors, photocatalysts, etc. In this article, we describe the synthesis of S and N co-doped graphene oxide quantum dots (S,N-GOQDs) with stable electroluminescence, photoluminescence, and photocatalytic properties and their optoelectrical applications as an emitter of a light-emitting diode device in electro-optical energy conversion and as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in photo-chemical energy conversion. The synthesized S,N-GOQDs show a high yield and excitation-independent emission. The maximum excitation wavelength and emission wavelength are 371 and 447 nm, respectively; the quantum yield is 61% when excited at 371 nm; and the emission half-width is 40 nm. A bright blue emission with a luminance exceeding 1341 cd m−2 was achieved at 6 V, thus proving the potential of S,N-GOQDs as an emitter in electroluminescence applications. For photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the system consists of a 0.1 mg mL−1 catalyst in pure water or TEA (1.43 M) + 80% EtOH aqueous solution. In pure water, high reaction rates of 3.001 mol h−1 g−1 were obtained under direct sunlight. In the TEA (1.43 M) + 80% EtOH aqueous solution, an unprecedented efficiency of 71 mmol h−1 g−1 and 6.138 mol h−1 g−1 was obtained under a 500 W Xe lamp and direct sunlight, respectively.
Introduction
Graphene-based quantum dots (GQDs) are a carbon-based material with robust chemical inertness, non-toxicity, good solubility, a large edge effect, surface grafting, stable photoluminescence, unique fluorescence characteristics, an adjustable size and electronic structure, good biocompatibility, and other advantages.1 GQDs can be functionalized through a variety of methods, such as doping heteroatoms, forming composites with inorganic materials or polymers, and controlling the size and shape to customize their optical, chemical, and electronic properties, thereby further expanding their applications.1,2 For example, the doping of O, S, and N atoms can improve water solubility and generate semiconducting bandgaps, promote photogenerated charge delocalization and extend resonance π-conjugation to extend the charge life, and break electron neutrality to promote charge separation and transfer.3 The co-doping of electron-withdrawing S and electron-donating N atoms further promotes charge separation and generates reactive electrons.3 Many S,N co-doped GQDs prepared by different synthetic routes have been shown to change the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of GQDs, thereby changing their photoluminescence (PL), electrical conductivity, and water solubility. A series of applications have been developed, including sensing, bioimaging, bioanalysis, fluorescent agents, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), batteries, sensors, ion detection, drug carriers, photo/electronic co-catalytic energy conversion, solar cells, photodetectors, and photovoltaic devices.1,2
In 2010, Yeh et al. demonstrated for the first time that graphene oxide (GO) can generate H2 from a methanol solution using a mercury lamp under ultraviolet light.4 Subsequently, the doping of heteroatoms, such as phosphorus and nitrogen on the surface of graphene, can further improve hydrogen production efficiency over GO.5,6 Recently, we prepared S-doped graphene oxide quantum dots (S-GOQDs) and applied them to photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in pure water and an 80% ethanol aqueous solution.7 Under direct sunlight, the highest H2 production efficiency of the catalyst in pure water and 80% ethanol aqueous solution was 18.2 mmol h−1 g−1 and 30.5 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. These results indicate that metal-free and low-cost S-GOQDs hold great potential in developing sustainable and environmentally friendly photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production through water splitting.
The unique optical properties of GQDs, such as upconversion, excellent photoluminescence (PL), energy adjustment by controlling the size/shape, and high surface grafting, make them useful for electroluminescence applications in LED devices.8 For example, Kim et al. constructed blue photoluminescent polyethylene glycol GQDs (PEG-GQDs) with luminescence exceeding 800 cd m−2.9 In addition, Qu et al. reported S,N-GQDs with three excitation wavelength-independent emissions and applications in visible light H2 production and bioimaging.10 We recently used citric acid (CA) as a carbon source, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) as a sulfur source, and O-phenylenediamine (OPD) as a nitrogen source to easily synthesize S,N-GOQDs with stable electroluminescence, photoluminescence, and photocatalytic properties. Considering their emission characteristics independent of excitation, the synthesized S,N-GOQDs may have potential in various optoelectrical and energy conversion applications. Here, we report the application potential of the obtained S,N-GOQDs as emitters of light-emitting diode devices in electro-light energy conversion and as hydrogen evolution photocatalysts in photo-chemical energy conversion (Fig. 1).

Experimental
Synthesis of S,N-GOQDs
The synthesis of the S,N-GOQDs was modified from the hydrothermal synthesis procedure reported by Dong et al.11 In brief, citric acid (CA, 2.50 g, and 13 mmol), sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 2.18 g, and 39 mmol), and O-phenylenediamine (OPD, 1.41 g, and 13 mmol) were dissolved in 70 mL distilled water and transferred to an 80 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 180 °C for 8 h and then cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered with a 0.22 μm filter, and the solution was dried with a rotary evaporator to obtain a pale-yellow solid. The residual CA, OPD, and unreacted NaHS were removed with the addition of ethanol and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min. The powder was stored at 4 °C before use.
Structural characterization
The UV-vis absorbance was measured on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. One mg of S,N-GOQDs was dispersed in 3 mL ddH2O and placed in a quartz cuvette, and the absorbance spectrum was recorded from 250 to 600 nm. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer f-4500 (Hitachi). In this assay, 1 mg of S,N-GOQDs was dispersed in 3 mL ddH2O, and the prepared solution was placed in a quartz cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained in the excitation wavelength range of 300 to 410 nm. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum was recorded using a Shimadzu IRTracer-100 spectrometer (Shimadzu). The S,N-GOQD sample was placed in a sample holder with a single reflection ATR accessory (MIRacle 10) and the spectrum was recorded between 4000 and 600 cm−1. The transmission electron micrograph (TEM) was taken on a JEM-ARM200F transmission electron microscope (JeOL). Two μL of the S,N-GOQD (1 wt% in EtOH) solution was placed on a Lacey Formvar/TED carbon-coated copper 300 mesh grid and vacuum dried in an oven at 80 °C for 48 hours before measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Microlab 350 electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al Kα radiation. Two μL of the S,N-GOQD (10 wt% in EtOH) solution was placed on a silicon wafer matrix and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C before measurement. The atomic force microscope (AFM) images were obtained by using a Scanning Probe Microscope System (Bruker Dimension ICON). The Raman spectrum was recorded with a confocal Raman microscope manufactured in the laboratory. The S,N-GOQDs were dispersed in water and measured by exciting the samples at 632.8 nm using a He–Ne laser (laser power: 3.8 mW) and the spectrum was recorded from 1000 to 2000 cm−1. LSV experiments were carried out using a CHI 660 electronic analyzer from CH Instruments Inc.
Device fabrication
The S,N-GOQD LED structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/S,N-GOQDs + PVP/PFN Br/Ag, where PEDOT:PSS, PVK, PVP, and PFN Br refer to poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), poly(N-vinyl carbazole), polyvinylpyrrolidone, and poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethyl ammonium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)) dibromide. Glass substrates pre-coated with 150 nm thick ITO were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and treated with an ultraviolet ozone cleaner for 30 min. The conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS (Baytron AI4083, H.C. Starck) was spun on a clean substrate (5000 rpm for 1 min). The PEDOT:PSS coated plate was heated at 150 °C for 30 min to dry the residual solvent and then cooled at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the PEDOT:PSS coated plate was spun with a PVK solution (5.5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene at 4000 rpm for 20 s) and then dried at 120 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK plate was coated with an S,N-GOQDs + PVP solution (5 mg mL−1 S,N-GOQDs + 1 mg mL−1 PVP in ethylene glycol, at 5000 rpm for 1 min) and then dried at 150 °C for 30 min. Then, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/S,N-GOQDs + PVP coated plate was spun with a PFN Br solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in MeOH, at 3500 rpm for 30 s) and then dried at 25 °C for 10 min. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/S,N-GOQDs + PVP/PFN Br coated layer was deposited with Ag under high vacuum (∼1 × 10−6 Torr). The current density–luminance voltage (J–V) characteristics of the manufactured devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The electroluminescence spectra were recorded using a Photo-Research PR-650. The luminescence unit of this device is cd m−2 (nits).
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The in-house light source for the photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction is a 500 W Xe arc lamp from Solar Electro-Optics Co., LTD For the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, a closed gas system containing S,N-GOQDs (0.1 mg mL−1) in pure water (6 mL) or TEA (1.2 mL) + 80% EtOH aqueous solution (4.8 mL) was maintained at 95 °C and photoirradiated for 2 h. Every 30 minutes, 500 μL of gas was collected using a gas-tight syringe and analyzed on a Bruker 450 GC gas chromatograph equipped with a Carboxen™ 1010 PLOT capillary GC column. The amount of hydrogen produced was calibrated using an external standard method. For photocatalytic hydrogen generation under direct sunlight irradiation, pure water (100 mL) or TEA (20 mL) + 80% EtOH aqueous solution (80 mL) containing 0.1 mg mL−1 of S,N-GOQDs was placed into a two-neck round-bottom quartz flask, with one neck sealed with a silicon rubber septum and the other equipped with a rubber tube that led to an inverted cylinder filled with blue-coloured ink water. The opening of the inverted cylinder was immersed in a larger water container. Photocatalytic experiments were carried out using solar light focused by a Fresnel lens on the reaction tube. A homemade solar finder (scope) was used to adjust the inclination of the lens surface so that it was perpendicular to the incident angle of the solar radiation. The gas produced was determined by collecting the gas in the water and measuring the volume of the displaced water. The number of moles of hydrogen was calculated using the ideal gas law equation.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The S,N-GOQDs were prepared by using CA, NaHS, and OPD in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 8 hours by a hydrothermal process. Fig. 2 and 3 show the transmission electron micrograph (TEM), high resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM), atomic force micrograph (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Raman spectroscopy. The TEM image shows a well-dispersed narrow size distribution of 1.5–4.0 nm (Fig. 2A). A representative HRTEM image shows a high degree of crystallinity, with a d-spacing lattice distance of 0.24 nm, similar to the (1120) plane of the nanocrystalline nucleus of graphite sp2 carbon atoms (Fig. 2B).12,13 The terrain height shown by the AFM image is 1–2 nm, indicating that most of the S,N-GOQDs are composed of ca. 1–3 layers of graphene (Fig. 2C and D).14 The DLS results show that the average size distribution is approximately 1.57 ± 0.60 nm (Fig. 3A). Raman spectroscopy shows two main features: a “disordered” D band at 1422 cm−1 and a crystalline G band at 1654 cm−1, which are, respectively, related to the existence of sp3 defects and an in-plane sp2 vibrational crystalline band. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) is about 0.82, indicating that the S,N-GOQDs produced are highly crystalline and graphitized (Fig. 3B).15

Optical and electronic properties
The UV-vis spectrum of the S,N-GOQDs showed absorption bands centered at 244, 272, and 372 nm (Fig. 4A). The strong absorption bands observed in the UV range can be ascribed to the π → π* transition of the sp2 domain based on graphene.16–19 The absorption band centered at 372 nm can be assigned to the n-π* transition of the conjugated C–N, CO, and C–O bonds.10,20,21 The S,N-GOQD solution is pale-yellow and transparent, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4A (left photograph). When illuminated with 365 nm light, a bright blue emission can be clearly seen (right photograph). FT-IR spectroscopy was used to characterize the surface functional groups of the synthesized S,N-GOQDs. The broad absorption band at 3000–3500 cm−1 is attributed to the vibrations of O–H and N–H, indicating that the surface of the S,N-GOQDs has amino or hydroxyl groups and good hydrophilicity. The band at 1654 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the CO group. The bands at 1570 and 1400 cm−1 come from the bending vibrations of CC and C–N, respectively. The peaks at 1078 and 740 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of CS and C–S, respectively. These results confirm the successful doping of S with NaHS and N with OPD (Fig. 4B). GQD materials usually emit light when excited with external energy. Fig. 4C shows the PL spectra of the synthesized S,N-GOQDs at different excitation wavelengths of 300–410 nm. The PL spectrum shows that the maximum emission is 447 nm (bright blue emission), and the full width at half-maximum is 40 nm. In addition, the emission wavelength is almost independent of the excitation wavelength. The intensity increases from 300 to 375 nm and then gradually decreases from 375 to 410 nm. For the 371 nm excitation and 447 nm emission, the PL quantum yield (QY) is 61%. The excitation wavelength that is not related to emission may reflect the uniformity of the size, surface state, and emission sites in the S,N-GOQDs. In addition, it should be noted that the increase of PL QY and the emission characteristics independent of the excitation wavelength may also be attributed to the reduction of non-radiative traps.22 The peaks in the PL and the PL excitation spectra intersected at 416 nm, as shown in Fig. 4D. The intersection peak of the S,N-GOQDs at 416 nm corresponds to its optical energy bandgap. The optical energy bandgap of the S,N-GOQDs is 2.98 eV.

The composition of the S,N-GOQDs was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 5). The full scan of the XPS spectrum showed four peaks at 169, 285, 399, and 532 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of S 2p, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively. This shows that N and S are successfully incorporated into the GO framework.23,24 The other peaks observed at 98 eV and 149 eV are the Si 2p and Si 2s peaks derived from the silicon wafer matrix.25 In addition, the 496 eV peak could be attributed to the Na element trapped in the graphene layer.26,27 The fitted C 1s spectrum of the S,N-GOQDs (Fig. 5B), ranging from 281 to 289 eV, shows the presence of CC or C–C (284.5 eV), C–N (285.1 eV), C–O or C–S (286.3 eV), and CO (288.1 eV) moieties, which is consistent with the corresponding FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 4B).28,29 The fitted N 1s shows three peaks at 398.7, 399.7, and 400.5 eV, which can be attributed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively (Fig. 5C).30 The S 2p spectrum fitted with S,N-GOQDs ranges from 162 to 174 eV, with four peaks at 163.7, 165.9, 168.6, and 170.3 eV, corresponding to a C–S–C thiophene-like bond, CS, C–SO, and C–SO4, respectively, based on previous studies (Fig. 5D), and consistent with the FT-IR results (Fig. 4B).7,10,24,31,32 These results confirm that, despite the relatively small S 2p peak, S was successfully doped onto the graphene grid in the hydrothermal reaction. The fitted O 1s spectrum shows three peaks at 530.5, 532.3, and 535.1 eV, which can be attributed to the CO, C–O–C/C–OH, and OC–OH groups, respectively (Fig. 5E).33 The C–OH or C–O–C bonds indicate the presence of epoxy or phenol groups on the periphery of graphene.28,29 The EDS results showed that the existence and atomic percentages of C, O, S, and N were 56.68%, 38.29%, 1.26%, and 3.77%, respectively (Fig. 5F).

Next, the electronic structure of S,N-GOQDs was characterized. Fig. 6A shows the relationship between the square of the absorbed energy ((αE)2, where α is the absorbance) and the photon energy (E), which is the energy of the direct bandgap. The apparent energy of direct transition of S,N-GOQDs is 3.02 eV. For a specific interstitial energy, the smooth absorption edge can be attributed to various oxidation and nitridation processes and the change in the particle size of the synthesized S,N-GOQDs.34 Next, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) energy levels were determined using linear potential scans. Fig. 6B and C show the cathode and anode scan results, showing CBM and VBM values of approximately −1.87 and 1.09 eV (vs. Ag/AgNO3), respectively. A band gap energy of 2.96 eV is obtained, which is consistent with the energy obtained from the light absorption spectrum (Fig. 6D). The gap energy is large enough to overcome the theoretical energy (1.23 eV) required for the endothermic water-splitting reaction, indicating the feasibility of using S,N-GOQDs for photocatalytic water-splitting.

Light-emitting diode application
The excellent optical properties of GQDs have been exploited in LEDs.35–38 In order to explore the possibility of using the synthesized S,N-GOQDs in optoelectronic applications, we used S,N-GOQDS as a light-emitting layer and embedded it in a poly layer LED. The schematic diagram of the S,N-GOQD LED device is shown in Fig. 7A. The S,N-GOQD LED structure is composed of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/S,N-GOQDs + PVP/PFN Br/Ag poly layers. PEDOT:PSS, PVK, and PFN Br refer to poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK), and poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethyl ammonium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)) dibromide, respectively, and were used as the hole injection layer (HIL), the hole transport layer (HTL), and the electron transport layer (ETL), respectively.37 The corresponding energy band diagram (relative to the vacuum energy level) of the layered structure S,N-GOQD-LED device is shown in Fig. 7B. Taking the Fermi level of GQDs as 4.74 eV, determined by a Kelvin probe analysis, the positions and energy band-gap (Eg) of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of S,N-GOQDs are calculated by directly converting the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) into eV, which were found to be ∼5.5 eV and ∼2.6 eV, respectively.35 In this system, an external electrical bias stimulates electrons and holes to be injected into the emitting layer (S,N-GOQDs + PVP) and PVK through PFN Br and PEDOT:PSS, respectively, where the recombination of charge carriers occurs. Multiple devices were manufactured and characterized to check the reproducibility of the S,N-GOQD-LED device performance. The true colour photo of the S,N-GOQD LED device is shown in Fig. 7C.

The electroluminescence (EL) spectra obtained from S,N-GOQD LED devices under different bias voltages are shown in Fig. 8A. It was found that the EL intensity increases with the increase of external electrical bias voltage, and the position of the EL spectrum does not change with the increase of the bias voltage, which is consistent with the PL spectrum of S,N-GOQDs in the solution (Fig. 4C), and both were located at approximately 447 nm. This implies that the recombination of charge carriers takes place in S,N-GOQDs, and the energy transfer from the host to S,N-GOQDs is dominant in the electroluminescence of LED devices. Fig. 8B shows the current–density voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the manufactured S,N-GQD LEDs. As the device changes from PVK + PVP without S,N-GOQDs to PVK + PVP with S,N-GOQDs, the turn-on voltage (Vt) decreases from 9 V to 4 V, indicating that the dispersion of the S,N-GOQDs provides additional transport/injection paths to increase the overall current density and radiative recombination from the S,N-GOQDs. Therefore, as the energy barrier decreases and the conductivity increases, the number of holes injected increases. On the other hand, when the concentration of S,N-GOQDs increases more than 5 mg mL−1, the hole flow is limited by the agglomeration of S,N-GOQDs + PVP, resulting in a decrease in current density. Fig. 8C shows the luminescence–voltage (L–V) characteristic curves of the manufactured S,N-GOQD LEDs. For a device with 5 mg mL−1 S,N-GOQDs at 6 V, a luminance of 1341 cd m−2 was measured. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and voltage curves of the S,N-GOQD LED are shown in Fig. 8D. The EQE measured at 5 V is 1.37%. In addition, after spin-coating S,N-GOQDs as the light emitting layer, a maximum current efficiency of 2.3 cd A−1 was observed under a bias voltage of 5 V. In sharp contrast to devices without spin-coated S,N-GOQDs, the efficiency improvement can be attributed to the increased efficiency of the hole injection from the anode to the active layer, resulting in a higher current efficiency.39 Finally, the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage's (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram was used to characterize the emission profile of the synthesized S,N-GOQDs. The corresponding CIE coordinates at 4 V, 5 V, and 6 V are (0.26; 0.35), (0.22; 0.27), and (0.21; 0.26), respectively. The colour-rendering index picture shows that S,N-GOQDs emit bright blue light, as shown in Fig. 8E.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
We next evaluated the photocatalytic activity of S,N-GOQDs for hydrogen evolution in aqueous solutions containing various electron donors. It has been reported that the addition of different electron donors can cause irreversible reaction with the photo-generated valence band (VB) holes to enhance photocatalytic electron/hole separation, while the remaining strong reduction conduction band (CB) electrons can reduce protons to hydrogen molecules, thus affecting the efficiency of hydrogen production.40,41 Triethylamine (TEA) is a commonly used electron donor. We first tested the effect of TEA at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.43, and 1.5 M) on photocatalytic H2 evolution. Preliminary experiments were carried out for 2 hours using S,N-GOQDs (0.1 mg mL−1), ddH2O and TEA (total 6 mL) under a 500 W Xe lamp, at 95 °C, and at pH 11. The results show that TEA exhibits the best photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency of 5.3 mmol h−1 g−1 at 1.43 M (entries 1–8 of Table 1). Other electron donors, including 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 1.43 M), triethanolamine (TEOA, 1.43 M), ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1.43 M), ascorbic acid (AA, 1.43 M), NaI/NaIO3 (0.1/0.02 M), Na2S/Na2SO3 (0.1/0.1 M), 80% MeOH (v/v), 80% EtOH (v/v), and 80% i-PrOH (v/v), were tested (entries 9–17 of Table 1). Among the tested electron donors, TEA (1.43 M) and 80% EtOH aqueous solutions exhibited high H2 evolution efficiencies of 5.3 and 3.5 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. We next evaluated the catalyst concentration (entries 18–25, Table 1), different pH values (entries 19 and 26–29, Table 1), and combinations of different electron donors (entries 30–34, Table 1) to increase the activity and the stability of the catalyst. As shown in Table 1, the photocatalytic H2 production activity decreases as the catalyst concentration increases. When the S,N-GOQD concentration is 0.1 mg mL−1, the H2 evolution rate is the highest, which is 3.5 mmol h−1 g−1 (entry 19, Table 1). In addition, the photocatalytic activity is pH-dependent, increasing from pH 8 to 11 and then inverting (entries 19 and 26–29, Table 1). Interestingly, the combination of different electron donors greatly improves the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 evolution. As shown in entry 32 in Table 1, when the electron donor changes from 80% EtOH aqueous solution (6 mL) to TEA (1.43 M) + 80% EtOH aqueous solution, the photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency increases from 3.5 mmol h−1 g−1 to 71 mmol h−1 g−1. In addition, constant activity was observed when the reaction was carried out at 95 °C for 8 hours, indicating that S,N-GOQDs are a sustainable and environmentally friendly water splitting hydrogen production medium.

In order to study the effect of light induction and light assistance on H2 evolution, we performed a reaction by keeping the temperature at 95 °C, turning the light on and off periodically, and flushing the system with argon between the on and off processes. As shown in Fig. 9, the control experiment showed that in the absence of light, no H2 evolution was detected, and an increase in H2 evolution was detected during the irradiation, but it was not detected between the two irradiation cycles. These results indicate photoinduced and photoassisted effects on the hydrogen production of S,N-GOQD catalysts. After four cycles of on/off experiments, the evolution efficiency of H2 remained almost constant.
 Fig. 9  The photoinduced and photoassisted effects of S,N-GOQDs on H2 evolution. Four repeat cycle experiments of S,N-GOQD catalyzed photocatalytic H2 evolution under 500 W Xe lamp on/off irradiation. 
We previously have shown that the photocatalytic activity of S-GOQDs decreases in pure water, but it remains unchanged in an 80% EtOH aqueous solution, and no O2 can be detected in the pure water system.7 In the S,N-GOQD photocatalytic H2 evolution system, similar observations of EtOH or TEA as sacrificial electron donors were made, which not only improved the H2 production efficiency, but also prolonged the lifetime of the photocatalyst. Based on the above results and PL and EL measurements, we proposed a possible mechanism for S,N-GOQDs to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. First, upon photoirradiation, S,N-GOQDs act as an electron reservoir to capture the generated electrons, thereby improving the efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole separation. This hypothesis is supported by the EL and PL measurement results. Then, the water decomposes to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) and H+ ions. The hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) were then converted to oxygen and competed with photogenerated H+ ions, reacted with electrons to form oxyanion radical ions (O2˙−), and then reacted with photogenerated H+ ions to form HO2˙. The generated HO2˙ molecules can react with each other to produce O2 and H2O2, and the latter enters the reaction and consumes photogenerated H+ again, resulting in a decrease in H2 production (chemical reactions (1)–(7)).42 Consistent with the proposed mechanism is the observation that the addition of H2O2 inhibits the activity of the catalyst, but this inhibitory activity resulting from the production of H2O2 is inhibited with the addition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), an enzyme that uses H2O2 as an oxidant to oxidize chromogenic or chemiluminescence substrates. In addition, adding TEA to an S,N-GOQD-catalyzed pure water system also had an effect similar to HRP, indicating that TEA is similar to HRP and can protect the catalyst from the quenching effect caused by H2O2 generated during the reaction (Fig. 10A). We also compared the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency of S,N-GOQDs in an 80% aqueous solution and an 80% aqueous solution + HRP. The results show that the H2 production efficiencies of the 80% aqueous solution + HRP and 80% aqueous solution are similar, but they are lower than those of the 80% aqueous solution + TEA and the 80% aqueous solution + TEA + HRP (Fig. 10B). These results confirm the fate of O2 and the additional role of TEA and EtOH in removing H2O2 (similar to HRP) produced during the water splitting process. (1) hvb+ + H2O → H2O+(2) H2O+ → OH˙ + H+(3) (4) O2 + ecb− → O2˙−(5) O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙(6) HO2˙ + HO2˙ → H2O2 + O2(7)

(B) 80% EtOH w/o S,N-GOQDs (■), S,N-GOQDs + 80% EtOH (●), and S,N-GOQDs + 80% EtOH + HRP (▲). 
We next studied the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity using sunlight. The system contains pure water (100 mL) or TEA (20 mL, 1.43 M) + 80% EtOH aqueous solution (80 mL) in S,N-GOQDs (0.1 mg mL−1) and is photoirradiated under direct sunlight in conjunction with a Fresnel lens to concentrate the sunlight. As shown in Fig. 11, the time course of S,N-GOQD photocatalytic H2 production shows that the highest H2 evolution rate of pure water and TEA + 80% EtOH aqueous solution is 3.001 mol h−1 g−1 and 6.138 mol h−1 g−1, respectively. Compared with the reaction of a 500 W Xe lamp, the H2 evolution efficiency is increased approximately 86-fold. We previously have reported that the H2 evolution efficiency of S-GOQDs increased 21 times under sunlight. The combination of TEA + 80% EtOH aqueous solution shows a synergistic effect on the efficiency of H2 evolution. Perhaps adding different electron donors at the same time enhanced the irreversibility of the photo-generated valence band (VB) hole and the photocatalytic electron/hole separation, thereby increasing the efficiency of the reduction of protons to hydrogen molecules.40–45 To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency of S,N-GOQDs that use direct sunlight as the only energy source.
 Fig. 11  Time courses of H2 production under a 500 W Xe lamp or under solar light irradiation for S,N-GOQDs (0.1 mg mL−1). For the 500 W Xe lamp, pure water (6 mL) or TEA (1.2 mL, 1.43 M) + 80% (v/v) EtOH aqueous solution (4.8 mL) at pH 11 was used for the reaction. For sunlight irradiation, TEA (20 mL) + 80% (v/v) EtOH aqueous solution (80 mL) at pH 11 was used for the reaction. 
Conclusions
In summary, a metal-free and low-cost catalyst, S,N-GOQDs, was developed for optoelectronic LED and photocatalytic H2 evolution applications. The manufactured S,N-GOQD-LED devices exhibited enhanced current–density voltage (J–V) characteristics, with a luminance of 1341 cd m−2, an EQE measured at 5 V of 1.37%, and CIE coordinates at 4 V, 5 V, and 6 V of (0.26; 0.35), (0.22; 0.27), and (0.21; 0.26), respectively, which indicates that S,N-GOQDs emit bright blue light. The photocatalytic H2 production reaction of S,N-GOQDs shows that when TEA or EtOH is used as an electron donor, the activity is significantly enhanced. In addition, the simultaneous presence of TEA and EtOH has a synergistic effect on the efficiency of the H2 evolution. In a TEA + 80% EtOH aqueous solution, the highest hydrogen generation efficiency was 6.138 mol h−1 g−1. Finally, the high and stable catalytic activity of the catalyst under sunlight makes it helpful to develop a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and effective H2 production system for water splitting.

 	Fig. 10  Effects of TEA or HRP on the restoration of H2 generation for S,N-GOQD photocatalysts (0.1 mgmL−1) in pure water at pH 8. (A) H2O + TEA w/o S,N-GOQDs (■), S,N-GOQDs + H2O + TEA (●), S,N-GOQDs + H2O + TEA + HRP (▲), and S,N-GOQDs + H2O + TEA + H2O2 (▼). (B) 80% EtOH w/o S,N-GOQDs (■), S,N-GOQDs + 80% EtOH (●), and S,N-GOQDs + 80% EtOH + HRP (▲).	 

 	Fig. 11  Time courses of H2 production under a 500 W Xe lamp or under solar light irradiation for S,N-GOQDs (0.1 mg mL−1). For the 500 W Xe lamp, pure water (6 mL) or TEA (1.2 mL, 1.43 M) + 80% (v/v) EtOH aqueous solution (4.8 mL) at pH 11 was used for the reaction. For sunlight irradiation, TEA (20 mL) + 80% (v/v) EtOH aqueous solution (80 mL) at pH 11 was used for the reaction.
