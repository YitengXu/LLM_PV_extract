    , Accepted 20th February 2012First published on 19th March 2012AbstractAnchoring functional moieties on the surface of graphene is an important step in the processing of graphene for numerous applications. In this article, the effects of two different functionalization methods on graphene viz. the conventional method involving ultrasonication in acids and a novel polyelectrolyte based method are systematically investigated. While the conventional acid treatment method makes graphene highly hydrophilic, it also causes severe damage to the graphene sheets and leads to disordered restacking. In contrast, the soft functionalization method based on polyelectrolytes preserves the morphology to a significant extent. Moreover, the presence of charges on the surface of polyelectrolyte modified graphene causes mutual repulsion between the sheets, thereby assisting in the fabrication of optically transparent films. The presence of charges also affects the electrochemical behaviour towards tri-iodide reduction, which is investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. New equivalent circuits are proposed to interpret the observed response.
Introduction
Graphene is an atomically thin sheet of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms. This 2D form of carbon has been the focus of intense research ever since its extraction in 2004,1 owing primarily to its excellent properties such as high electrical conductivity, high carrier mobility at room temperature, large surface area, high thermal conductivity, etc.2 Unique phenomena such as quantum spin Hall effect, deviation from Born–Oppenheimer approximation, and conductance quantization have also been observed in single layer graphene (SLG).3 However, the inability to synthesize SLG on a large scale and the difficulties in handling them have evoked interest in the synthesis4,5 and application of few layer graphene.6,7 In the present work, the term few layer wrinkled graphene (FLwG) is used to describe such systems. FLwGs are a unique class of ‘quasi-2D’ graphene materials with properties closely matching those of SLG. In a way, they can be viewed as a material intermediate to graphite and amorphous carbon, combining the former's excellent electrical conductivity and the latter's high surface area. FLwGs consist of around 5 layers and in some cases up to 10,5 but the most important distinguishing feature is the presence of wrinkles on their surface. These wrinkles act like defective edges, giving excellent catalytic activity to these materials.8 Additionally, FLwG can be synthesized in large quantities from graphite oxide (GO) by different exfoliation–reduction methods such as thermal exfoliation,4 chemical exfoliation,9 vacuum exfoliation,10 hydrogen exfoliation11 and a variety of other methods.12–15
The exfoliation–reduction methods are based on the removal of oxygen containing functional groups from GO. Different methods lead to graphene with varying amounts of remnant functional groups. The graphene with the least amount of these groups has the highest electrical conductivity and is therefore ideal for many electronic applications. For certain other applications, it may be necessary to modify the surface of graphene by reintroducing suitable functional groups/moieties so as to achieve proper dispersion in solvents,16 to get uniform decoration of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles17,18 or to get better adhesion on substrates. Therefore, functionalization of graphene has attracted attention, theoretically19 as well as experimentally.20 Among the different functionalization schemes, the acid treatment method to tether carboxylic groups on carbonaceous surfaces has remained a favorite, since the materials are rendered highly soluble in polar solvents by this process. Additionally, the derivative COOH groups can couple with other moieties, thus facilitating the formation of composites. Alternatively, polyelectrolytes have also proved to be useful for metal nanoparticle decoration on various carbon nanostructures.21–23 However, a systematic analysis of the effect of different functionalization schemes on the characteristics and morphology of graphene has not been carried out. The effect of the functionalization method on defects, stacking of graphene and conductivity is tremendous. Consequently, any application based on graphene will have significant effect depending on the functionalization method.
Of particular interest here is the application of graphene as counter-electrodes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).24 In DSSCs, the counter-electrode generally consists of a thin layer of Pt thermally deposited on a transparent conducting substrate. The Pt electrode catalyzes the reduction of tri-iodide species in the electrolyte efficiently.25 However, abundance and cost considerations have necessitated the development of other electrode materials. In particular, graphene sheets synthesized by the many of above mentioned methods have been utilized as counter-electrodes.26–30 However, the efficiencies of the DSSCs with such electrodes is ∼0.8 to 0.9 times the value of the respective Pt counter-electrode based reference cells. Moreover, these counter-electrodes are opaque and black in color, thereby hindering their use in practical applications such as windows. With optically transparent counter-electrodes, an efficiency of only 0.6–0.7 times the reference cell has been obtained.29,30 The main reason for the low performance of graphene counter-electrodes is their large charge transfer resistance (Rct) towards tri-iodide reduction.
Hence, in this paper, the effect of different functionalization methods on the properties of FLwG has been systematically investigated. Graphene sheets synthesized by a hydrogen induced simultaneous exfoliation–reduction method (HEG) is taken as an example.5,11 It is shown that by soft functionalization of graphene using polyelectrolytes, highly transparent counter-electrodes with low Rct can be obtained which would be ideal for counter-electrode application in DSSCs.
Results and discussion
Functionalization: ‘soft’ vs. ‘harsh’

Mechanism. 
The mechanism involved in the synthesis of reduced graphene sheets is explained in our earlier works.5,11 Briefly, GO is rapidly heated to ∼200 °C in an atmosphere of hydrogen. At this temperature, the labile oxygen containing functional groups between the graphitic layers in GO can be removed. When the heating rate is slow, these functional groups diffuse to the atmosphere, effectively ‘reducing’ GO to graphite. In order to simultaneously ‘exfoliate’ and ‘reduce’ GO to few layered graphene sheets, a very fast heating rate can be provided.4 The inner stress generated results in the splitting of the sheets. Lv et al.10 suggested that if the inner stress generated could be reinforced by providing a suitable atmosphere then exfoliation can be achieved at a much lower temperature. Accordingly, in our earlier work we had shown that in an atmosphere of hydrogen, vigorous reaction can occur between the oxygen containing groups and hydrogen, thereby providing the extra energy to split the sheets.11 Further, due to the reducing atmosphere of hydrogen, minimal remnant functional groups are obtained in HEG. This exfoliation is clearly visible as black coloured material flying inside the quartz tube. Thus, there is exfoliation along with reduction unlike many methods in which only reduction of GO to graphene is achieved.
The remaining functional groups after exfoliation–reduction are randomly distributed on the surface. Therefore, for uniform metal decoration, post-synthesis functionalization of graphene becomes necessary. In the present work, graphene is first functionalized with the conventional acid treatment method involving ultrasonication in acids. This sample is labeled as f-HEG. Considering the detrimental effect of this procedure, which will be discussed below, a ‘soft functionalization’ method using polyelectrolytes is adopted. The samples are labeled as PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG, wherein the prefixes correspond to the polyelectrolytes used. The process of graphene functionalization is schematically described in Fig. 1. Acid functionalization results in the formation of –COOH and –OH groups on graphene by oxidizing the carbon atoms dangling at the edges and those found at defect sites on the surface. The polyelectrolytes, however, interact differently. They contain repeating units of an electrolyte group which dissociate in aqueous solution making the polymer component charged.31 In the case of carbon nanotubes, the charged polymers interact with the surface of the tube by π–π interaction.32 As a result, they wrap around the tubes, leaving the tubes charged. Similarly, in graphene it can be assumed that the charged polymers spread over the sheets, where they are held by a similar π–π interaction. The cationic polyelectrolyte, PDDA, would then induce a positive charge on the surface of graphene, whereas anionic PSS would give a negative charge.

Functional groups identification. 
The effect of functionalization can be primarily assessed from the FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. 2. As synthesized HEG (black curve) has a minimum amount of functional groups since most of the groups are removed during exfoliation. Nevertheless, low intense signals corresponding to –OH stretching, CHx symmetric and antisymmetric stretch, CC, CO and C–O of the carboxyl group, and C–O of the epoxy group can be observed at 3440 cm−1, 2920 cm−1 and 2860 cm−1, 1620 cm−1, 1720 cm−1 and 1230 cm−1, and 1050 cm−1 respectively.5 On treatment with acids, considerable amount of functional groups are attached. The signal due to adsorbed –OH groups is highly broadened, ranging from 3400 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1.33 This indicates the presence of a large number of hydrogen bonded –OH groups. The presence of –COOH groups can be confirmed from the presence of strong signals of CO and C–O at 1720 and 1230 cm−1. Epoxy groups are either nonexistent or negligible. Polyelectrolytes, PDDA and PSS, do not introduce any functional groups. In fact, the FTIR signals of graphene are further broadened and/or reduced in intensities, possibly due to the interaction of the polymers with the graphene surface.
 Fig. 2  FT-IR spectra of graphene sheets (HEG) functionalized by acid (f-HEG) and polyelectrolytes (PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG). 
It is interesting to note that the –OH group FT-IR signal in PSS-HEG and PDDA-HEG is more broadened than in HEG. It can be reasoned that PSS-HEG solvates some water molecules making graphene less hydrophobic. Similar behavior may exist in PDDA-HEG, but to lesser extent as its –OH signal intensity is lesser than that of PSS-HEG. In order to confirm this, these samples were dispersed in de-ionized water by ultrasonication. The stability of the dispersions was checked at regular intervals (Fig. 3). It was found that f-HEG had the best dispersion and did not settle for months. PSS-HEG was stable for a day, confirming that it is hydrophilic to some extent. PDDA-HEG settled in a few hours suggesting that it is less hydrophilic, while HEG settled within a very short time. Incidentally, when the dispersed solutions were observed after three months, the as grown HEG had accumulated together whereas the PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG samples were uniformly spread at the bottom of the vial. This clearly suggests that the presence of charges on PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG prevents the accumulation of graphene. The f-HEG dispersion, on the other hand, remained stable and applications based on such dispersions have been discussed elsewhere.33

Disordered restacking. 
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples are presented in Fig. 4. HEG (black curve) has a broad glass like signal starting from 2θ ≈ 14° to 30° with a maximum at ∼25°. The d-spacing was determined to be 0.36 nm for the C (002) peak. This broad peak is a characteristic of most of the exfoliated graphenes5 and is suggestive of the fact that the long range ordering of graphite no longer exists in graphene. After acid functionalization, the single peak profile changes to a two peak profile consisting of a broad graphene peak centered at ∼25° and a sharp graphitic peak at 26.5°. This second peak has a d-spacing of 0.34 nm and hence corresponds to that of graphite. This indicates that acid functionalization causes some ‘stacking’ or graphitization of the graphene sheets. A sharper and more intense peak at 26.5°, similar to that of graphite, would indicate a greater stacking. This stacking is random (disordered) in nature and probably occurs due to interaction between the –OH groups of the neighboring planes. When functionalized by polyelectrolytes, PDDA and PSS (blue and red curves), the ‘stacking’ or graphitization peak is not seen. Interestingly, the graphene signal in PSS-HEG has a lesser FWHM as compared to that of PDDA-HEG and HEG. This sharpening suggests the possibility of stacking. Again, the stacking could be due to the presence of –OH groups in PSS-HEG. However, since PSS imparts a negative charge to the graphene surface, a mutual repulsion can occur between the neighboring surfaces, preventing severe re-stacking. A similar repulsion also exists in PDDA-HEG which is responsible for the broadening of its XRD signal. The FWHM values increase in the following order f-HEG < PSS-HEG < HEG ≈ PDDA-HEG. Based on the broadening of this peak, a rough estimate of the number of layers can be obtained using the relation, N ≈ L/d + 1,5 where L is the crystallite size and d refers to the d-spacing. Thus, HEG, PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG have ∼5, 4 and 7 layers, whereas f-HEG has 10 or more layers in the powder form. This indicates that the polyelectrolytes, PDDA in particular (or similar cationic polyelectrolytes), may prevent restacking of the graphene sheets. This analysis assesses the number of layers in the powder form and not in solutions where dispersion by ultrasonication could decrease the number of layers. Nevertheless, it does give a rough estimate in the powder form or in film form, since during drying the layers restack.

To see if the stacking in f-HEG is random or ordered as in graphite, Raman spectroscopy was carried out. Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of all the samples. The Raman spectrum of HEG has been discussed in detail elsewhere.5,11 Information regarding the presence of defects and disorder can be primarily inferred from the D and the G bands, located at 1350 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1, respectively. The D-band is a measure of the amount of disorder present in the sample. It is intense and broad in HEG with an intensity ratio of 0.88 (ID/IG) which suggests that the few layered graphene sheets are defective and disordered. On functionalization with acids by ultrasonication, the intensity of the D-band increases and consequently ID/IG increases to 1.1 (green curve). This suggests that f-HEG is an extremely defective structure. Further, considering the fact that in highly ordered crystalline graphite, the D band intensity is significantly low, it can be concluded that the partial re-stacking occurring in f-HEG is disordered. On the other hand, in the case of PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG, the intensity ratios are 0.95 and 0.9, respectively. Since polyelectrolytes do not cause any damage nor introduce functional groups to the graphene surface, the small increase in the intensity ratio is due to a small increase in disorder alone. The disorder in polyelectrolyte modified graphene is due to the randomness created by the mutual repulsion between the charged graphene sheets.

Wrinkled and damaged morphology. 
The FESEM images of the samples are presented in Fig. 6a–d. The wrinkled and fluffy morphology of HEG is clearly seen in Fig. 6a. This morphology is common to most of the exfoliated graphene.5 On functionalization with acid, this morphology is completely destroyed, as can be seen from Fig. 6b. The sheets not only stack together but also are severely damaged. Polyelectrolyte modification preserves the graphene morphology and prevents restacking (Fig. 6c and d). The HRTEM images in Fig. 6e–h show few layered graphene sheets with a large number of wrinkles. In the case of f-HEG, severely damaged and thick graphene sheets can be observed. As can be seen from Fig. 6g and h, PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG do not alter the morphology of the graphene sheets. Thus, acid functionalization is ‘harsh’ whereas polyelectrolyte functionalization is ‘soft’.

Electrical conductivity. 
The presence of oxygen containing functional groups and the damage caused affects the electrical conductivity of the materials to a great extent. The oxygen content in the samples was determined by EDX analysis at several locations on the sample to obtain an average value. The bulk electrical conductivity of the samples was measured by a four probe technique. The results have been tabulated in Table 1. HEG has an oxygen content of 6.4 at% and an electrical conductivity value of ∼1.6 × 103 S m−1. After acid functionalization by ultrasonication, the oxygen content increases to 12.6 at% and the conductivity decreases by four orders. In comparison, GO has an oxygen content of 31 at%, and a very low conductivity of ∼10−4 S m−1. This suggests that f-HEG is not identical to GO. The decrease in conductivity of f-HEG could be due to the severe damage caused by the acid functionalization process and also due to the presence of functional groups. PDDA-HEG and PSS-HEG do not affect the oxygen content of HEG. However, a slight decrease in the conductivity was observed which could be due to the presence of polymeric chains on the surface of graphene.

Counter-electrode characteristics

Transmittance. 
To investigate the effect of functionalization on counter-electrode characteristics, electrodes were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide substrates. The loading of graphene samples was kept at ∼50 μg cm−2 in the electrodes. The transmittance values of these electrodes were determined by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The results are presented in Fig. 7. The f-HEG electrode has a low transmittance of ∼65% in the visible region at 550 nm. The PDDA-HEG electrode has the highest transmittance of ∼88% at 550 nm and is almost constant throughout the visible region. HEG and PSS-HEG have comparatively lower transmittances. Two factors can affect the film transparency here. First, the transmittance values increase with decreasing number of layers (as seen from XRD). The low transmittance of f-HEG is therefore suggestive of severe restacking in powder/film form. As grown HEG and the polyelectrolyte modified HEG based electrodes do not suffer from restacking and hence have higher transmittances. Secondly, these films are non-continuous i.e. there are gaps between the graphene sheets in the films. These pores can give rise to an apparent transparency in these films.

Morphology of counter-electrode films. 
The morphology of the counter-electrode films as seen under a scanning electron microscope is shown in Fig. 8. It is to be noted that since the images are viewed from the top, only the inhomogeneities can be seen. The thin graphene sheets are indistinguishable from the carbon tape background under the FTO glass. In the case of f-HEG (Fig. 8b), the film is rather uniform. At defect sites, some stacked structures consistent with its powder morphology (Fig. 6b) can be seen. This uniformity arises because it forms a well dispersed and stable solution even in ethanol. The other three samples do not form continuous films. In addition, their fluffy and wrinkled morphology is maintained. Compared to PDDA-HEG, PSS-HEG shows flat structures. This indicates the loss of wrinkled morphology which could be due to partial restacking in PSS-HEG, as discussed earlier.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 
The functionalization schemes described earlier influence the catalytic activity of the fabricated counter-electrodes significantly. The catalytic activity of an electrode towards an electrolyte is generally determined from the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrode. In order to assess this, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in a symmetric sandwich cell configuration wherein two identical electrodes are clamped together with the electrolyte in between. Further details are presented in the experimental section. Fig. 9a shows the impedance spectra of the HEG based counter-electrodes. Here, Z′ and Z′′ are the real and imaginary parts of impedance, following IUPAC convention. All the spectra exhibit large arc like behavior in the measured frequency range, but with varying ‘diameters’.
 Fig. 9  (a) Electrochemical impedance spectra of a symmetric sandwich cell consisting of different graphene electrodes. The equivalent circuit fitting is shown as red lines. (b) Equivalent circuit model used to fit the observed impedance data. 
In order to get quantitative results, the spectral data were fit by simulating the behavior using several equivalent circuits. The equivalent circuit that fits best is shown in Fig. 9b and red lines in the Fig. 9a are the simulated data. Many electrochemical systems generally show a Randles circuit like behavior. The Randles circuit consists of the following components: series resistance (Rs), Rct, double layer capacitance (C) and a Warburg diffusion term (W). For materials such as carbon materials with high roughness, the Randles circuit is modified by replacing C with a constant phase element Q which represents capacitance at rough surfaces. Furthermore, a finite bounded diffusion term, O, is used instead of the conventional W term. The admittance of these elements is given by YQ = YQo(iω)n, where YQo and n are frequency-independent parameters (0 ≤ n ≤ 1; for n = 1, Q = Cdl)29,34,35 and YO = YOo(iω)1/2coth[B(iω)1/2], where YOo is related to conductance and B is inversely related to the time constant of the regeneration of the diffusion process.35 However, recently, Roy-Mayhew etal.29 showed that in porous carbon based electrodes, an additional diffusion impedance term Opore is required to explain the observed behavior. Opore arises in the high frequency region due to the diffusion through the electrode pores. In the present case, this model does not satisfactorily fit the high frequency region and also underestimates the Rct. Hence, a different model is proposed here, as shown in Fig. 8b. It consists of additional parameters, Rpore and Qpore, to model the behavior in pores. In graphene films, these pores refer to the gaps between the sheets, as discussed earlier. The parameters are tabulated in Table 2.

ct in general is high for all the graphene based electrodes. The HEG counter-electrode has an Rct of 750 Ωcm2 which is comparable to that reported by Grätzel and co-workers30 (590 Ωcm2) at similar transmittance. After acid functionalization, the Rct increases indicating that the catalytic activity is poorer than HEG, under the present conditions. This can be attributed to the increase in oxygen functionalities, increase in defects and consequent decrease in electrical conductivity after acid treatment. On the other hand, PDDA functionalization improves the Rct significantly whereas PSS functionalization gives Rct slightly greater than that of HEG. These changes after polyelectrolyte modification cannot be accounted for in terms of defect or conductivity effects since both, PSS-HEG and PDDA-HEG, show a negligible increase in defects and a small decrease in conductivity. On the other hand, this improvement can be ascribed to the presence of surface charges in polyelectrolyte modified graphene. The positively charged PDDA-HEG attracts the negative tri-iodide ions enabling faster reduction of these species. PSS-HEG on the other hand has negative charge which repels the negative tri-iodide ions, thereby decreasing the apparent catalytic activity.



I–V characteristics. 
The I–V characteristics of DSSCs with different graphene based counter-electrodes are shown in Fig. 10. Since the aim was to evaluate counter-electrode performance, DSSC with a simple TiO2 architecture was used. This consists of films made from aqueous dispersion of P25 TiO2. With a Pt counter-electrode, an efficiency of ∼4.5% is obtained. Many reports with similar architecture show efficiencies in this range.28,36–39 In comparison, graphene counter-electrode based DSSCs show lower performance. The solar cell parameters for the different cells are given in Table 3. Clearly, the DSSC with a PDDA-HEG electrode has the highest efficiency of 3.1% which is around 0.7 times that of the Pt counter-electrode based reference DSSC. HEG and PSS-HEG counter-electrode based DSSCs have lesser efficiencies of ∼2.5% and 2.1%. The DSSCs with f-HEG counter-electrodes show a poor performance of ∼0.7%. The variation in power conversion efficiency in these DSSCs appears to be mainly due to the changes in fill factor (FF). As can be seen from Tables 2 and 3, the changes in FF are in accordance with the changes in charge transfer resistance. Thus, it can be conclusively said that the different functionalization schemes clearly affect the catalytic activity of these materials which in turn affects the power conversion efficiency of the fabricated solar cells. With thicker and dark HEG counter-electrode based DSSCs, higher efficiency of 3.6% was obtained in our earlier work.40 In contrast, in the present work it has been shown that power conversion efficiency comparable to that of cells based on thick graphene films can be obtained by polyelectrolyte modification while maintaining a high transparency.

Experimental
Materials
Purified natural graphite, SP-1, 45 μm with 99.99% purity was mostly used for graphene synthesis. Polyelectrolytes, poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA, 35 wt% in water) and polystyrene sodium sulfonate (PSS, 33 wt% in water) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, U.S.A. The other reagents for graphene synthesis and functionalization were procured locally. P25 TiO2 was a generous gift from Degussa, Germany. FTO conducting plates (TEC 22-7 and TEC 22-15), SX1170-25 spacer, Pt catalyst Plastisol, DMPII (1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide) and ruthenium 535 bis-TBA (N719) dye were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. LiI was purchased from Merck. All other reagents/solvents used for DSSC fabrication were procured from Sigma Aldrich or Alfa Aesar. High purity de-ionized (DI) water was used for all experiments. The FTO plates were cut into 1.75 cm × 1.25 cm and rinsed with soap water and DI water, followed by successive ultrasonication in DI water, acetone and ethanol.
Synthesis and functionalization of graphene
Graphene sheets were synthesized by simultaneous exfoliation–reduction of graphite oxide in hydrogen atmosphere at 200 °C.5,11 The GO used was prepared by Hummers' method. 200 mg of GO was taken in a quartz boat and placed at the centre of a quartz tube in a furnace. The ends were sealed with end couplings having provision for gas inlet and outlet. Ar gas was allowed for 15 min to purge the oxygen present inside the tube. Ar gas was stopped and hydrogen gas was allowed for 15 min. The temperature of the furnace was then raised to 200 °C in a short time. At 200 °C, exfoliation occurred which could be seen visually as black coloured material flying inside the tube. After the furnace cooled down, hydrogen flow was stopped and the sample was collected. This sample is named as HEG (graphene exfoliated–reduced by hydrogen). Acid functionalization was carried out by treating HEG with a 3:1 solution of conc. H2SO4:HNO3via ultrasonication for 1 h. For polyelectrolyte functionalization, HEG was dispersed in 400 mL DI water by ultrasonication. 0.5 wt% of PDDA was added during functionalization. 0.5 wt% of NaCl was also added during functionalization. The samples were filtered and washed several times with water to remove free PDDA. Finally, the sample was filtered and dried in vacuum to obtain PDDA-HEG. The same procedure was followed for functionalization with PSS to obtain PSS-HEG.
Characterization
Identification and characterization of functional groups were carried out using a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer in the range 400–4000 cm−1. X-Ray diffraction was carried out using a PANalytical X'PERT Pro X-ray diffractometer with nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation as the X-ray source. The pattern was recorded in the 2θ range of 5° to 90° with a step size of 0.016°. The Raman spectra were obtained with a WITEC alpha 300 Confocal Raman system equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) as the excitation source. The morphology of the sample was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI QUANTA 3D FEG). For counter-electrode films, the morphology was imaged using FESEM (FEI Quanta 200F). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out using a TECNAI F–20 (S–TWIN) microscope. For HRTEM measurements, the sample was dispersed in absolute ethanol using mild ultrasonication and casted onto carbon coated Cu grids (SPI supplies). Electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz using a Solartron 1400 and a 1470E CellTest System. A symmetric sandwich cell configuration was employed in which two identical electrodes (active area ≈ 0.5 cm2) were clamped and an electrolyte was added between them. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPII and 0.5 M TBP (tert-butyl pyridine) in acetonitrile. An ac signal of 10 mV was applied over a 0 dc to get the response curves. The I–V characteristics of the fabricated solar cells were measured under AM 1.5G solar radiation using a Newport 150W Class A Solar Simulator attached with a Keithley 2420 source meter. The intensity was calibrated to give an output of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) using a thermopile detector and also using a NREL calibrated Si reference cell.
Conclusions
The effect of different functionalization methods on graphene sheets has been demonstrated. The ‘harsh’ acid functionalization method damages the graphene sheets whereas the ‘soft’ polyelectrolyte functionalization preserves the morphology of graphene sheets. Functionalization with cationic polyelectrolyte introduces positive charges which prevent the agglomeration of the sheets, thereby resulting in transparent films. This positive functionalization also improves the charge transfer resistance significantly. This can motivate the use of graphene as counter-electrodes for practical DSSC applications.
