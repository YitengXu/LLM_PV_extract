    , Accepted 28th July 2015First published on 28th July 2015AbstractRechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have transformed portable electronics and will play a crucial role in transportation, such as electric vehicles. For higher energy storage in LIBs, two issues should be addressed, that is, the fundamental understanding of the chemistry taking place in LIBs and the discovery of new materials. Here we design and fabricate two-dimensional (2D) WS2 nanosheets with preferential [001] orientation and perfect single crystalline structures. Being used as an anode for LIBs, the WS2-nanosheet electrode exhibits a high specific capacity, good cycling performance and excellent rate capability. Considering the controversy in the lithium storage mechanism of WS2, ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses clearly verify that the recharge product (3.0 V vs. Li+/Li) of the WS2 electrode after fully discharging to 0.01 V (vs. Li+/Li) tends to reverse to WS2. More remarkably, the [001] preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets are also promising candidates for applications in photocatalysis, water splitting, and so forth.
Introduction
Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the most desirable approaches to alleviate energy shortages and global climate warming issues which the world is currently facing.1–5 High energy and power densities are of great importance to LIBs for applications in electric vehicles, stationary energy storage systems for solar and wind energy as well as in smart grids.6–8 Because the conventional electrodes of LIBs are inadequate to fulfill these requirements, the development of new materials and novel composites with excellent electrochemical performance is critical for next generation LIBs.9–11
Very recently, layer structured transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with strong in-plane covalent bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals forces have attracted significant attention due to their immense potential for various applications.12–15 Among TMDs, two dimensional (2D) nanoscale metal disulfides, such as MoS2 and WS2, have been intensively studied to examine their properties, including electrical transport,16–19 luminescence,20–22 photocurrent and catalytic properties,23–25 as well as their strain effects.26 Owing to the similarity of the features of their layered structures to graphite, 2D metal disulfides could have great potential as alternative anode materials.27–29 As a representative, MoS2 has already received great scientific interest as the anode for LIBs and significant improvements in cycle life and rate performance have been achieved thanks to the numerous efforts devoted to promoting low intrinsic electrical conductivity.30–33 In comparison, WS2 seems to be a more suitable candidate as the lithium ion anode due to its higher intrinsic electrical conductivity than MoS2. Besides, WS2 has a larger spacing between neighboring (002) planes (6.18 Å) than that of graphite (3.35 Å), which in principle may make Li+ diffusion easier. Its 4-electron transfer reaction when hosting lithium ions enables its lithium storage capacity (443 mA h g−1) to be higher than that of a commercial graphite anode (372 mA h g−1).28,34 Moreover, the density of WS2 is 7.6 g cm−3, resulting in a high volumetric energy density (about 4 times that of graphite). For example, layered WS2 supported on reduced graphene oxide delivered a capacity of about 400–450 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1, with a relatively low initial coulombic efficiency of 48%.35 Tungsten sulfide–carbon composite microspheres were also synthesized using spray pyrolysis, which exhibited a capacity of 555 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle.36 However, as a qualified anode material for high performance LIBs, further investigations need to be done in searching for novel fabrication methods and improving the rate capability and cycling stability of WS2. In addition, Wang et al. recently reported that the end products when WS2 discharged to 0.01 V (vs. Li+/Li) were metallic W and Li2S, while the recharge (3.0 V vs. Li+/Li) products were metallic W and S,37 inconsistent with much of the literature which reports that the recharge products reverse to WS2.38,39 It is essential to further explore its lithium storage mechanism.
As is known, nanomaterials have the genuine potential to make a significant impact on the performance of LIBs, as their reduced dimensions enable high intercalation/deintercalation rates. The physical and chemical properties of nanostructured materials depend crucially on their morphologies and sizes. Therefore, nanomaterials have been widely explored to improve the electrochemical performance of LIBs, including 0D quantum dots,40 1D nanoribbons,41 2D nanosheets,39 and 3D nanomaterials.42 Herein, we fabricate [001] preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets with perfect single crystal structures. As the anode for LIBs, the WS2-nanosheet electrode achieves a stable reversible capacity of about 539.1 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and a high rate capability. Considering the controversy in the lithium storage mechanism of WS2, ex-situ XRD, Raman and XPS analyses verify that the recharge product (3.0 V vs. Li+/Li) of the WS2 electrode after fully discharging to 0.01 V (vs. Li+/Li) tends to reverse to WS2. More importantly, the [001] preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets with perfect single crystal structures could have immense potential in other fields, for example, in photocatalysis and hydrogen evolution reactions.25,43
Experimental section
Fabrication of preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets
The [001] preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets were fabricated by the calcination of metallic W and S powders. The mixture of W and S powders (purity: 99.9 wt%) with the atomic ratio of 1:2.1 was sealed in a vacuum quartz tube, and then treated in a resistance furnace at 155 °C for 3 hours. At this temperature, the molten S with the lowest viscosity could easily wet the metallic W. Then, the temperature was increased to and kept at 600 °C for 10 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, 2D WS2 nanosheets were obtained without further treatment.
Morphological and structural characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared and discharged/charged samples were determined using a XD-3 diffractometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd, China) equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and microstructure of the WS2 nanosheets were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO 1530 VP), together with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2). Additionally, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained to document the crystalline nature of the as-prepared samples. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were also obtained using the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode. The acceleration voltage for the TEM and STEM measurements is 200 KV. Besides, the chemical compositions of the as-prepared samples were determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in the SEM and nanobeam-EDX (NB-EDX) using the FEI Tecnai G2 microscope under the HAADF mode. Further evidence for the composition of the product was obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) which was carried out at room temperature with an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (150 W). All reported binding energy values are calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. For the ex-situ XRD and Raman testing, cells were cycled to the required voltage and opened. The cycled electrodes were washed with a dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solution to remove the lithium salt before testing. Raman spectroscopy was performed with a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman system (HORIBA Scientific, λ = 633 nm). In addition, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded in the wavelength range of 250–800 nm.
Electrochemical measurement
The as-obtained WS2-nanosheet anode slurry was created by mixing 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% acetylene black (Super-P), and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent. The working electrodes were produced by coating the slurry on Cu foil (thickness: 9 μm) and drying at 120 °C for 12 h. The galvanostatic discharging/charging tests were conducted using standard 2032 type coin cells with a lithium foil as both the counter electrode and reference electrode, a polypropylene (PP) film (Celgard 2325) as the separator, and 1.0 M LiPF6 in mixed ethylene carbonate (EC) and DMC (EC:DMC, 1:1 by volume) as the electrolyte. The CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with oxygen and moisture levels below 1 ppm, and galvanostatically cycled at different current densities between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) using a LAND-CT2001A test system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured with a CHI660E potentiostat at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 over a potential window of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with the CHI660E potentiostat in the charged state (3.0 V vs. Li+/Li). The frequency was from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an excitation voltage of 5 mV.
Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of the as-prepared WS2 sample is presented in Fig. 1a. The spectrum shows a highly crystalline hexagonal structure. All the diffraction peaks could be indexed to the pure phase of WS2 (P63/mmc space group, JCPDS no. 08-0237, 2H-WS2) without any peaks of the W and S phases. Additionally, the EDX results demonstrate that the as-prepared powders are composed of W and S (Fig. 1b). It is noteworthy that the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak is extraordinarily higher than that of other peaks, suggesting that the WS2 samples are dominantly exposed to the crystal plane of (002) (inset of Fig. 1a). The morphology of the as-obtained WS2 powders was visualized using the SEM images (Fig. 1c and S1†). The WS2 samples are nanosheets with various sizes and the diameter of the nanosheets is around 0.1–2 μm while the thickness is 20–50 nm (Fig. 1c and S1b†). Furthermore, the zoom-in SEM image (Fig. 1c) shows that the nanosheets are formed by stacking several thinner lamellar WS2 nanosheets along the same crystal plane of (002), as illustrated in Fig. 1d.

The morphology and crystal structure of the WS2 samples were further clarified by TEM observation and electron diffraction (Fig. 2 and S2†). The bright-field TEM images of the WS2 nanosheets in Fig. 2a, b and S2a† verify that the nanosheets with a thickness of ∼15 nm stack along the same crystal plane to form relatively thick ones. The HRTEM image in Fig. S2b† shows two monolayers without any defects. Fig. S2c† also shows the perfect crystal structure of WS2 although a nanosheet stacks on the other one. The SAED pattern in Fig. 2c confirms the formation of WS2, and the diffraction spots were unequivocally indexed to 2H-WS2 (JCPDS no. 08-0237). The SAED results indicate the perfect single crystalline nature of the WS2 nanosheets. The normal direction of the dominantly exposed crystal planes (hexagon surface) is the [001] axis, which is coincident with the direction of the electron beam. The HRTEM image and fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis (Fig. 2d) further confirm the hexagonal lattice structure and the single crystalline feature of WS2. The magnified HRTEM image (Fig. 2e) shows a lattice spacing of 2.75 Å assigned to the (100) planes whereby the clear hexagonal rings are formed of W atoms (Fig. 2f). Additionally, a STEM image of the as-obtained WS2 in Fig. 2g presents the 2D nanosheet structures and several single nanosheets overlap along the dominantly exposed planes, in good agreement with the bright-field TEM images. The NB-EDX analysis (Fig. 2h and i) indicates that both the stacking regions and single nanosheet only consist of W and S atoms (the Cu signals come from the supporting Cu mesh). The above results demonstrate that we have obtained high-quality WS2 nanosheets with preferential [001] orientation.

The XPS spectra before and after surface etching by Ar+ sputtering were performed to analyze the bonding characteristics and surface composition of the as-obtained WS2 nanosheets as presented in Fig. 3 and S3,† respectively. Peaks at 32.8, 35.0, and 38.4 eV are ascribed to W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2, and W 5p5/2, respectively (Fig. 3a), with a spin–orbit splitting of ΔEp(4f5/2–4f7/2) = 2.2 eV. As for the peak at 36.3 eV in Fig. 3a, which was swept away through the surface etching (Fig. S3c†), we assign it to the W–O bond, indicating low surface oxidation. The peaks of the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of divalent sulfide ions are observed at 162.5 and 163.7 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The bonding energy of the elements is consistent with W4+ and S2− in WS2,43,44 further confirming the formation of a pure WS2 phase.

In this work, the 2D WS2 nanosheets were used as an anode material for LIBs. Its working mechanism for lithium storage was investigated firstly by the combination of electrochemical measurements, ex-situ XRD, Raman and XPS analyses (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a shows the discharge/charge profile for the initial cycle of the WS2-nanosheet electrode at 10 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). Several typical cells were selected at different states, designated as the letters “a” to “h” as denoted in Fig. 4a, for ex-situ measurements. As the discharging process goes ahead, the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak decreases gradually, suggesting that WS2 reacts with Li+ constantly (Fig. 4b). In comparison to the original electrode before cycling, no obvious diffraction peaks except Cu were detected at the states of “g” and “h” (Fig. 4c), which may be attributed to the nanoscale dispersion and the degraded crystallinity of the redox products.45,46 In the discharge process, the reduction products of WS2 at 0.01 V (vs. Li+/Li) could be assigned to metallic W and amorphous Li2S, as reported in the literature.37,38 Li2S and metals are the most-common discharge products of transition-metal sulfides, such as MoS2, FeS, and NiS.32,47 Upon Raman analysis, we see that the Raman spectrum of the pristine WS2 electrode features two sharp peaks at 351 cm−1 and 416 cm−1, corresponding to the in-plane E2g vibration and the out-of-plane A1g vibration respectively, as well as several weak peaks marked by rectangles (Fig. 4d). Similar to the ex-situ XRD results, the intensity of the E2g and A1g vibrations diminishes and the peaks in the rectangles disappear with the cells discharging (Fig. 4d). Noticeably, when the cell recharges to 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li), the vanished peaks reemerge, confirming the recovery of WS2 (Fig. 4d). Besides, the positions of the E2g and A1g vibrations slightly shift to 349 cm−1 and 414 cm−1 respectively, which could be attributed to structural or textural modifications during the first lithiation process.
 Fig. 4  (a) The discharge/charge profiles of the WS2-nanosheet electrode at 10 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) for the first cycle. The letters “a” to “h” denote the states of different lithiated electrodes for corresponding ex-situ X-ray patterns and Raman spectra. (b and c) Ex-situ XRD patterns collected at various states from “a” to “h”. (d) Ex-situ Raman spectra collected at various states of “a”, “c”, “f”, “g” and “h”. (e–h) XPS spectra of W 4f and S 2p: the electrode film at the state of “g” (e and f) and “h” (g and h). 
In order to further clarify the working mechanism of WS2, XPS surface analyses of the electrode at the state of “g” and “h” were carried out in the same test conditions. From the XPS broad scan spectra in Fig. S4,† the same element species can be detected in both states. High-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f and S 2p in the full discharge (0.01 V vs. Li+/Li) and charge (3.0 V vs. Li+/Li) states are given in Fig. 4e–h. The weak peak at 29.4 eV indicates the presence of W0+ while the two intense peaks at 35.4 eV and 37.5 eV correspond to W6+, which may be ascribed to the easy surface oxidation of nano-sized W0+ (Fig. 4e). Compared with the XPS spectrum of W after fully-discharging, the peak for W0+ disappears while the intensity of W4+ peaks (32.6 and 34.8 eV) increases in the fully-charging state (Fig. 4g), indicating a reversible conversion reaction mechanism. Moreover, the two peaks at 162.1 eV and 163.2 eV in Fig. 4f correspond to S2−, whereas the peaks at 166.9 eV and 169.0 eV are assigned to S6+, implying an inevitable surface oxidation of S2−.43,48 Similarly, after the 1st charge to 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li), the distribution of the peak locations was almost unchanged, demonstrating that the valence of S maintains constant during the discharge/charge process except for the unavoidable surface oxidation (Fig. 4h). As a result, the reduction products of WS2 at 0.01 V (vs. Li+/Li) could be assigned to metallic W and Li2S and the recharge product tends to reverse to WS2. Therefore, the redox reaction of lithium ions with the WS2-nanosheet electrode can be summarized as: WS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ W + 2Li2S.
The CV measurement has also been measured to determine the electrochemical reaction mechanism. Fig. 5a and b show the CV curves from the WS2-nanosheet electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 over a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). As shown in Fig. 5a, the first five CV profiles of the WS2-nanosheet electrode are similar except for the first scan. A strong cathodic peak located at around 0.56 V (vs. Li+/Li) can be observed in the first cycle, which is ascribed to the reduction of WS2 to metallic W embedded in a Li2S matrix accompanying the decomposition of the electrolyte.35,49 The anodic peak at 2.43 V (vs. Li+/Li) accounts for the oxidation of W to WS2.38 From the 2nd cycle, the original reduction peak at 0.56 V (vs. Li+/Li) disappears while two smaller cathodic peaks appear at 2.06 V and 1.84 V (vs. Li+/Li), which correspond to the formation of LixWS2 upon the lithium insertion into WS2, suggesting dramatic lithium driven structural or textural modifications during the first lithiation process.38,50 After 20 galvanostatic discharge/charge cycles at 0.2 A g−1, the peak positions and current of the following CV scans are still similar to those of the initial five cycles, showing excellent electrochemical reversibility and cycling stability of the WS2-nanosheet electrode (Fig. 5b).

(c) Galvanostatic discharge/charge curves of the WS2-nanosheet electrode at different cycles in a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a current density of 0.2 A g−1.

Fig. 5c presents the potential versus capacity profiles in the 1st, 2nd, 10th, 30th and 60th cycles of the WS2-nanosheet electrode at 0.2 A g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). In the first discharge process, the potential decreases dramatically, followed by a plateau at 0.7 V (vs. Li+/Li), corresponding to the reduction of WS2 and the decomposition of the electrolyte.35 In the subsequent cycles, much higher and more sloping discharge plateaus located at 2.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) can be observed, indicating easier Li+ insertion in the successive cycles. The charge plateaus located at about 2.3 V (vs. Li+/Li) represent the reverse reaction for the formation of WS2.38 These results are in good accordance with the CV measurements.
The cycling performance of the WS2-nanosheet electrode at current densities of 0.2 A g−1 and 1 A g−1 is displayed in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. The first discharge/charge capacity at 0.2 A g−1 is 904.6/700.9 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 77.5% (Fig. 5d), which is much higher than most of the previous literature as presented in Table S1.†35,36,38,39,49,51–53 The irreversible capacity during the first cycle may result from different reasons, such as the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and the organic conductive polymer, as well as the electrolyte decomposition.54 The WS2-nanosheet electrode delivers a 10th discharge/charge capacity of 632.2/617.1 mA h g−1, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 97.6%. After 10 cycles, the specific capacity of the WS2-nanosheet electrode tends to be stable. The reversible capacity maintains at 539.1 mA h g−1 after the 60th cycle, with an 87.4% retention compared to that of the 10th cycle (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5e shows the ultralong cycling stability with a capacity retention of 193.7 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g−1, proving its excellent tolerance of ultrafast insertion and extraction of lithium ions for long-life LIBs. The presently reported electrochemical performance of the WS2-nanosheet electrode is superior to that of other WS2 electrodes previously reported. For example, the surface-functionalized WS2 nanosheet electrode delivered a much lower reversible capacity of 118 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at an extremely low current density of 25 mA g−1.55 Besides, WS2 supported on reduced graphene oxide exhibited an initial coulombic efficiency of 48% and maintained a relatively low specific capacity of 400–450 mA h g−1 even with the aid of graphene.35 The excellent cyclability of the present WS2-nanosheet anode can be attributed to the 2D layer structured WS2 with a perfect single crystalline nature, which can provide short diffusion paths for lithium ions and allow efficient ingress and infiltration of the electrolyte into the electrode.36,56
The rate performance of the WS2-nanosheet electrode was measured at varying current densities (Fig. 6). With increasing current density, the separation between the discharge plateaus and charge plateaus is enlarged due to the dynamic limitation, rendering higher overpotentials (Fig. 6a).57 The WS2-nanosheet electrode delivers a specific capacity of 634.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 after 10 cycles, and the reversible capacity remains as high as 552, 484.6, 410.9 and 321 mA h g−1, decreasing regularly with increasing current densities of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 A g−1 respectively (Fig. 6b). Remarkably, when the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, the electrode could recover its capacity to about 541.7 mA h g−1, indicating that the WS2-nanosheet electrode has good structural stability and rate performance.

EIS was employed to gain an in-depth understanding of the lithiation/delithiation processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The data of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 7a) before cycling and after 20 cycles were analyzed by fitting to equivalent circuits as shown in Fig. 7b and c, respectively. The intercept on the Z real axis corresponds to the electrolyte resistance (Re). The semicircle in the high and middle frequency regions is due to the presence of SEI resistance (Rsei) combined with charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for the transfer of Li+ across the SEI to the electrode. An inclined line at low frequency is in relation to the Warburg impedance (Zw) of the Li+ diffusion in the solid materials. The resistance values obtained from the impedance spectra are summarized in Table S2.† The similar intercepts on the Z real axis of the 0th (3.3 Ω) and 20th (4.2 Ω) cycles show that the WS2-nanosheet electrode possesses a low and stable electrolyte resistance. After the electrochemical reaction, the value of Rsei is 6.6 Ω, which was unchanged after the SEI film formed in the initial cycle. Apparently, the radius of the semicircle decreases drastically, indicating a sharp decrease of Rct from 135.6 Ω (the 0th cycle) to 29.6 Ω (the 20th cycle), which can be attributed to the significant structural change from submicro-sized WS2 to nano-sized metallic W and the Li2S matrix in the first reduction reaction. The onset of the conversion processes associated with Li+ insertion kinetics could be observed by the reduction of the initially broad semicircle upon cycling.

It should be noted that lithium storage is just one potential application of the presented preferentially oriented WS2 nanosheets. On one hand, we could further improve the reversible capacity, rate capability and long-term cycling performance of WS2 through combination with carbon materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or through the exfoliation of WS2 nanosheets into thinner films. On the other hand, the present WS2 nanosheets with special orientation could find wide applications in other fields like photocatalysis, water splitting, and so forth. It is known that P25 TiO2 is the state-of-the-art photocatalyst for solar cells and the photodegradation of organic pollutants, but mainly responds to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, as shown in Fig. S5.† There is an urgency to enhance the visible light response of photocatalysts. The UV-vis DRS results (Fig. S5†) demonstrate that the present WS2 nanosheets exhibit a strong absorption of both UV and visible light (250–800 nm), indicating their potential applications as photocatalysts.
Conclusions
In summary, [001] preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets were synthesized by the calcination of metallic W and S powders. The layer structured WS2 nanosheets possess dominantly exposed (002) crystal planes and a perfect single crystalline nature. When being applied as a lithium ion anode, the 2D WS2-nanosheet electrode exhibits high specific capacity, good cycling performance and high rate capability. Additionally, ex-situ XRD, Raman and XPS analyses clearly verify that the recharge product (3.0 V vs. Li+/Li) of the WS2 electrode after fully discharging to 0.01 V (vs. Li+/Li) tends to reverse to WS2. More remarkably, the [001] preferentially-oriented 2D WS2 nanosheets with perfect single crystal structures show great potential for applications in photocatalysis, water splitting, and so forth.
