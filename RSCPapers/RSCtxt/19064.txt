1. Introduction
With an increase in global energy consumption and the aggravation of environmental problems, it is imperative to develop environmentally friendly renewable energy.1 Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier for fuel cells, automotive power, and the chemical industry. Efficient conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy can lead to a huge energy revolution.2 Therefore, using solar energy to split water into hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising strategies to solve the energy crisis and environmental problems.3
To date, a variety of semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been widely used for photocatalytic hydrogen production by water splitting, such as Fe2O3, WO3, Cu2O, TiO2, and CdS.4–7 Among them, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is famous for its abundance and stable photochemical performance.8,9 However, TiO2 with a large bandgap of about 3.2 eV can only absorb ultraviolet light, which accounts for less than 5% of the total solar spectrum.10,11 Therefore, much attention has been focused on the modification of TiO2 to improve its absorption and utilization of visible light.12–14 In this regard, constructing Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts is an excellent method to enhance solar-driven hydrogen production because it can connect two catalysts with different bandgaps to gain a suitable reduction potential for proton reduction and elevate the migration efficiency of photogenerated carriers.15,16 Besides, doping metals or nonmetals into the crystal lattice of TiO2 is also a common modification method, which can extend the light absorption range by adjusting the bandgap of TiO2.17,18 When non-metallic dopants are introduced, the bandgap of TiO2 can be reduced as a result of forming new impurity levels.19,20 With metallic element doping, such as Co, Cu and W, the efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation can be improved due to the increase of charge traps provided by metallic elements.21–23 Since W6+ (0.601 Å) and Ti4+ (0.605 Å) have similar ionic radii, W-doped TiO2 has attracted much attention,24–26 but is rarely investigated for solar-driven hydrogen production.
Under the guidance of defect engineering, it is also a promising modification strategy to introduce oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ self-doping into TiO2 by hydrogenation treatment.27,28 Since Chen et al. successfully narrowed the bandgap of TiO2 and extended its light absorption range to the visible-light region through surface hydrogenation, more and more literature studies about hydrogenated TiO2 (h-TiO2) have been reported.27,29,30 Recently, Jia et al. prepared hydrogenated TiO2 through the wet-chemical method, and innovated the conversion of Ti–H bonds into oxygen vacancies by annealing technology, which not only significantly improved its photocatalytic activity, but also realized controllable conversion of defect types in h-TiO2.31 Moreover, the oxygen vacancies in h-TiO2 can act as electron traps to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced carriers, and the surface hydrogenated layer generated by Ti3+ can also effectively reduce the formation energy barrier of H2 on the sub-surface.32 However, it is worth mentioning that although pure h-TiO2 can achieve full utilization of visible light, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction still cannot be achieved without a noble metal as a cocatalyst.33 Therefore, the design of innovative TiO2-based photocatalysts with excellent performance independent of a noble metal as a cocatalyst is a hot research area at present.
In this work, we fabricated ultrathin W-doped h-TiO2 (W-h-TiO2) nanosheets with outstanding photocatalytic activity through a solvothermal and calcination approach. The doping of W6+ ions changed the valence band position of TiO2, and meanwhile, as the capture centers of photogenerated electrons, W6+ dopants could also reduce the recombination rates of photogenerated electrons and holes. In addition, W6+ dopants are conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ in both the solvothermal reaction and hydrogenation modification process of TiO2, and the strong interplay between W6+ dopants and oxygen vacancies (or Ti3+ ions) is beneficial for enhancing the light-harvesting ability. Moreover, compared to the undoped counterpart, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets was also increased. Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of W-h-TiO2 was significantly improved, and the maximum rate of H2 evolution could reach up to 338.79 μmol g−1 h−1 under simulated sunlight irradiation without a noble metal as a cocatalyst.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of W-doped h-TiO2 (W-h-TiO2) nanosheets
W-Doped h-TiO2 (W-h-TiO2) nanosheets were synthesized through a solvothermal and calcination method. Specifically, certain amounts of tungsten carbide (W2C) nanoparticles (the masses of W2C are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 g) as the tungsten source prepared as reported in the previous work34 were added to 5.0 ml of Ti(OBu)4 and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Next, 0.8 mL of hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution was added to the above solution, and then the mixture was transferred to a 25.0 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 24 h. Note that HF is highly corrosive and must be handled carefully. After the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature, the precursor was collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm, followed by washing several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h, and the obtained grey powder was named W-TiO2 nanosheets. Next, 500 mg of W-TiO2 nanosheets were placed in a porcelain boat and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in a tubular furnace at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere to produce W-doped h-TiO2 (W-h-TiO2) nanosheets. According to the amount of tungsten source, the products were denoted as W-h-TiO2-x (x = 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140) and W-TiO2-x (x = 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140).
2.2 Characterization
A Tecnai F20 (FEI Instruments) was used to obtain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a Rigaku D/Max-RC X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (45.0 kV, 50.0 mA). A JEOL-FA200 spectrometer was used for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Raman spectra were recorded using a micro-Raman spectroscopy system (Renishaw inVia, 532 nm laser). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected using a QUADRASORB SI-KR/MP (Quantachrome, USA) nitrogen adsorption apparatus. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the surface areas of the materials were estimated with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements. AFM images were recorded using an ICON system (DIMENSION ICON, Bruker) operating in the tapping mode with silicon nitride tips. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a PHI-5400 ESCA system using an Al Kα radiation source. The standard photoelectron peak of C 1s at 284.6 eV was used as a reference value to calibrate the binding energy. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi UH4150 spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm.
2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production test
Photocatalytic hydrogen production was performed at room temperature in a vacuum closed gas circulation system (Labsolar 6A, PerfectLight, Beijing), where the reactor was made of completely transparent quartz glass and the top lid was connected to the tank body with a sealing apron coated with vacuum silicone grease. A xenon lamp source of 300 W (PLS-SXE300/300UV) with a total reflection filter and an AM 1.5G filter was fixed 10 cm above the liquid level, and the intensity focused on the reaction system was tested to be 100 mW cm−2. The irradiation area of the reaction system was 50.25 cm2. During a typical testing process, 50 mg of as-prepared catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 20 ml of methanol. Before irradiation, the reaction system was vacuum pumped for 30 min to ensure that the air in the gas circulation system was completely drained. The amount of hydrogen produced was detected by gas chromatography (Techcomp GC7900) with a thermal conductivity detector, and the carrier gas was N2. Here, no noble metal cocatalyst was added to the reaction system.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical test
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out with a standard three-electrode cell on a CHI 660D (CH Instruments, Inc.) electrochemical workstation, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode, and the as-prepared photocatalyst dropped on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate with an effective area of 2 × 1 cm2 as the working electrode. The rotating disk electrode was always kept open during the photochemical test. The as-prepared photocatalyst ink consisted of 200 μL of deionized water, 200 μL of anhydrous ethanol, 4 mg of as-synthesized photocatalyst, and 7.5 μL of naphthol. Na2SO4 (0.1 M) was purged with N2 and used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at a potential of 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. Visible light (AM 1.5G, PLS-SXE300/300UV, PerfectLight, Beijing) was used as the light irradiation source.
3. Results and discussion
W-Doped h-TiO2 (W-h-TiO2) nanosheets were synthesized by the solvothermal and calcination method (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). As shown in Table S1 in the ESI,† an ICP-OES test was used to accurately calculate the molar ratio of W to Ti in W-h-TiO2 nanosheets. Of note, we use tungsten carbide (W2C) nanoparticles rather than inorganic salts containing the tungsten element as the tungsten source, and the XRD pattern and TEM images of W2C are displayed in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† Surprisingly, W2C nanoparticles can be dissolved in a solution of Ti(OBu)4 mixed with HF, and this experimental phenomenon also suggests that researchers should consider the influence of elemental doping on the process of loading experiments. From the TEM images (Fig. 1a and b), it can be observed that W-h-TiO2 exists as ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets with a side length of about 50 nm. From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1c–e), it can be observed that the main exposed crystal plane of W-h-TiO2 nanosheets is the (101) crystal plane, with a lattice spacing of 0.352 nm.35 In addition, the yellow dotted line circle in Fig. 1c shows the local lattice distortion of TiO2 due to W doping. According to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings (Fig. 1f–i), W, Ti, and O are distributed uniformly, indicating that W atoms have been successfully doped into the h-TiO2 nanosheets. In the solvothermal reaction process, the doping of W6+ particles leads to the formation of bulk phase oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ ions with large ionic radii in the lattice of titanium dioxide. Therefore, according to atomic force microscopy (AFM) results (Fig. S3a–d in the ESI†), the average thickness of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets is about 6 nm, which is larger than that of h-TiO2 nanosheets (about 4 nm).

It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the XRD peaks of both pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 can be indexed to the typical anatase phase TiO2 (PDF#21-1272).36 From the enlarged illustration (inset in Fig. 3a), it can be observed that the (200) peak of W-h-TiO2 at around 48.1° is slightly blue shifted as compared with that of pure h-TiO2 nanosheets, proving that W dopants can disturb the original lattice arrangement and enlarge the crystal plane spacing. To deeply analyze the chemical composition and the effect of the W dopants, X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out. The characteristic peaks of W, Ti, and O can be obviously detected in the full scan spectrum (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the peaks corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets are located at 35.7 and 37.8 eV, respectively, demonstrating that tungsten exists in the form of W6+.37 Since the characteristic peak of Ti 3p was observed at 37.1 eV, further analysis of the W 4d characteristic peaks of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. S5 in the ESI†) was carried out to exclude the influence of the Ti 3p peak on the W 4f peak, and the characteristic peaks at 247.4 and 260.1 eV were attributed to W6+ 4d5/2 and W6+ 4d3/2, respectively.38 The binding energies of Ti 2p1/2 (464.7 eV) and Ti 2p3/2 (458.9 eV) in W-h-TiO2 nanosheets are higher than Ti 2p1/2 (464.4 eV) and Ti 2p3/2 (458.5 eV) in pure h-TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. 2c), and this phenomenon explains that the positive charges around the Ti atom are increased due to W6+ doping.39,40 Therefore, Ti atoms with a large number of positive charges can enhance the adsorption of H2O molecules, which is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. As for O 1s XPS (Fig. 2d), the characteristic peaks at 530.1 and 532.0 eV can be indexed to the Ti–O–Ti bond and oxygen vacancies, respectively.41 The area of the peak at 532.0 eV (owing to oxygen vacancies) of W-h-TiO2 is larger than that of pure h-TiO2, proving that the introduction of W6+ is in favor of the formation of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies in the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets can act as active sites that are favorable for H+ adsorption. In addition, there was no carbon element doping in the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. S6 in the ESI†).

Low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed on pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets to deeply investigate the intrinsic difference in the structure (Fig. 2e). It can be seen that there is a strong signal at the Lorentzian line with g = 2.003 corresponding to the oxygen vacancies in both pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets42 because W2C nanoparticles can be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid at a high temperature and high pressure, and the tungsten element is doped into the lattice of titanium dioxide in the form of W6+ ions during the solvothermal reaction. In addition, because W6+ ions have two more positive charges than Ti4+ ions, in order to balance the charges, a large number of bulk oxygen vacancies will be generated during the solvothermal reaction, and with further surface hydrogenation, a large number of surface oxygen vacancies will be generated on the surface of tungsten-doped titanium dioxide. Therefore, the intensity of the oxygen vacancies of W-h-TiO2 is much stronger than that of pure h-TiO2, suggesting that W dopants are more conducive to generating more oxygen vacancies. Additionally, the signal peak positions of Ti3+ in h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 are obviously different. For pure h-TiO2, Ti3+ is more likely to appear on the surface, while for W-h-TiO2, Ti3+ tends to appear in the bulk phase, which is in favour of inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 exhibit typical type-IV isotherms (Fig. 2f), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas are further calculated.43 The BET surface area of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets is 73.07 m2 g−1, which is larger than that of pure h-TiO2 (64.88 m2 g−1), and the larger surface area of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets can provide more actives sites for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra shown in Fig. 3a confirm that the visible light absorption capacity of W-h-TiO2 has been significantly improved compared with that of pure h-TiO2 nanosheets, demonstrating that the sunlight utilization rate of W-h-TiO2 has also been enhanced after W doping.24 Accordingly, the optical bandgap has also decreased from 2.92 to 2.78 eV (Fig. S7 in the ESI†), indicating that the synergistic effect of the oxygen vacancies and W doping greatly increases the effective light absorption range of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets. As a key factor in judging the photocatalytic activity, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was carried out, aiming to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 3b). The decreased fluorescence intensity of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets testifies better separation efficiency. In addition, to further investigate the migration dynamics of photogenerated carriers, time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were collected (Fig. 3c). The relevant parameters of fluorescence lifetimes (τ1 and τ2) and amplitudes (A1 and A2) are listed in Table S2 in the ESI.† Specifically, the short lifetime (τ1) values of pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets are 2.71 and 3.97 ns, and the corresponding magnitudes are 85.92% and 67.62%, respectively, indicating that the recombination efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets has been distinctly inhibited. Similarly, the long lifetime (τ2) values of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets (58.63 ns, 32.38%) are also longer than that of pure h-TiO2 nanosheets (22.61 ns, 14.08%). The average photoluminescence lifetime (τave) of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets (21.58 ns) is much longer than that of pure nanosheets (5.52 ns), suggesting that W dopants can efficaciously prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers.44
Photoelectrochemical tests were carried out to obtain more information about photogenerated carriers. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveal that the circular-arc radius of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets is smaller than that of pure h-TiO2 nanosheets, suggesting that the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets have smaller interfacial resistance and faster photogenerated electron diffusion mobility, no matter under dark or light conditions.45 Moreover, the chronoamperometric curves (Fig. 3e) show that the photocurrent density of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets (80 μA cm−2) is almost double that of pure h-TiO2 nanosheets (40 μA cm−2), indicating that the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets are more conducive to enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers.46 Notably, the photocurrent of both pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets can remain stable, which well implies that they both have outstanding photoelectric stability. As exhibited in the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots (Fig. 3f), both the pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets with positive slopes belong to n-type semiconductors. Additionally, the carrier density can be calculated from the slope of the M–S curve, and apparently, the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets possess higher carrier densities, revealing that W doping can promote the migration of photoelectrons. Furthermore, the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalyst can also be calculated using M–S measurements.47 As calculated, the CB of pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 is located at −0.83 and −0.76 V vs. NHE (pH = 7), respectively (Fig. S8 in the ESI†). In order to further prove that W dopants can change the valence band of W-h-TiO2, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analyses were carried out. As shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI,† the valence band position of W-h-TiO2 was calculated to move up significantly compared with that of h-TiO2.
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was estimated in the full-spectrum (AM 1.5G) with methanol as hole scavengers. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, with the control of the weight of the tungsten source, the hydrogen evolution rate of both W-h-TiO2 and W-TiO2 nanosheets increases firstly and then begins to decline when the weight of the W source reaches a certain value. It is worth mentioning that the maximum hydrogen production rate of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets can reach 338.79 μmol g−1 h−1, higher than that of the W-TiO2 nanosheets (286.41 μmol g−1 h−1), which indicates that the synergy between W dopants and oxygen vacancies is conducive to promoting the photocatalytic activity of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets. Since most of the literature studies about titanium oxide photocatalysts are based on noble metals as cocatalysts, the aim of our work is to report a single component titanium dioxide photocatalyst without a noble metal as a cocatalyst. However, in order to compare with the performance of similar titanium dioxide photocatalysts reported in the literature, we tested the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets with 0.5 wt% H2PtCl6 as a cocatalyst. The maximum hydrogen evolution rate of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets with 0.5 wt% H2PtCl6 as a cocatalyst can reach up to 5.23 mmol g−1 h−1, which is higher than most of the reported values in the literature (Table S3†). Importantly, it can be seen from Fig. 4c that both W-h-TiO2 and W-TiO2 nanosheets can maintain photocatalytic stability without noble metals as cocatalysts after 20 hours of cycling tests, which is promising for practical applications. The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets under single-wavelength irradiation at 365, 420, and 550 nm is elucidated, as shown in Fig. 4d. The results show that the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets not only have high photocatalytic performance under ultraviolet light, but also display considerable photocatalytic activity under visible light.

It has been reported that black hydrogenated titanium dioxide with oxygen vacancies has high photothermal conversion efficiency.48 To explore whether W doping modification can further improve the photothermal properties of hydrogenated titanium dioxide, pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets in the powder state were illuminated under one solar intensity, respectively, and infrared thermal imaging analysis was conducted (Fig. 5). At the first second of illumination, the surface temperatures of h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets were almost the same. With the extension of illumination time, the surface temperature of h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets showed a great difference. For the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets, their surface temperatures were 56.3 °C, 69.5 °C, and 80.3 °C, respectively, at illumination times of 30, 60, and 300 s, which were significantly higher than the corresponding surface temperature of pure h-TiO2 nanosheets. This phenomenon indicates that W doping can effectively narrow the bandgap of the h-TiO2 nanosheets and promote the release of energy as a phonon, and thus, the photothermal conversion efficiency of W-h-TiO2 can be effectively improved.49 The H2 evolution rate of W-h-TiO2 at a constant temperature of 25 °C was tested, and was found to be lower than that under the normal test conditions (Fig. S10 in the ESI†), proving experimentally that W doping can improve the photothermal performance of h-TiO2 nanosheets.
 Fig. 5  IR images of surface temperature at various time points of pure h-TiO2 and W-h-TiO2 nanosheets under one sun solar illumination. 
Based on the above results, ultrathin two-dimensional W-h-TiO2 nanosheets with an outstanding photothermal effect can be utilized as a brilliant photocatalyst for hydrogen production, and a plausible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed as shown in Fig. 6. Compared with pure h-TiO2 nanosheets, W doping can effectively narrow the bandgap of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets and improve the utilization of visible light. In addition, since the potential at the bottom of the conduction band of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets is more negative than that of proton reduction, the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction can be effectively carried out with the assistance of a sacrificial agent. Moreover, W doping can promote the formation of more oxygen vacancies on the surface of h-TiO2 as active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Since W6+ has two more positive charges than Ti4+, W dopants can effectively increase the density of positive charges around the Ti atoms and the specific surface area of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets, which is conducive to adsorbing more water molecules for participating in the reaction. Consequently, outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is achieved by the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets.

4. Conclusions
In summary, W-h-TiO2 nanosheets with excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance have been fabricated through the solvothermal and calcination method. During the preparation process, W2C nanoparticles as the W precursor could be dissolved in a tetrabutyl titanate solution containing hydrofluoric acid, and doped into hydrogenated titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the form of W6+. W doping can increase the positive charge around the Ti atom and the amount of oxygen vacancies, which is conducive to the adsorption of water molecules and photocatalytic hydrogen production, leading to a higher surface area and more reactive active sites. Moreover, due to the ultrathin two-dimensional structure of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets, photogenerated electrons and holes can be quickly transferred to the corresponding active sites on the surface, thus improving the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. Importantly, W dopants can further improve the photothermal performance of hydrogenated titanium dioxide, so that the hydrogen evolution efficiency of the W-h-TiO2 nanosheets can reach 338.79 μmol g−1 h−1 without a noble metal as a cocatalyst. We believe that this work can provide a new design idea for the development of TiO2-based photocatalysts.
