During the preparation of novel hybrid perovskite materials, preserving the morphology of highly crystalline materials and narrowing their band gap will be desirable for designing photoelectric devices with outstanding performance. Here, with broad band gap 1D/2D hybrid perovskite single crystals as a template, we design a universal conversion process from single crystal to single crystal for a variety of large-sized hybrid perovskite materials induced by CH3NH2 (MA) gas under an ambient atmosphere. Most significantly, the hybrid perovskite single crystals keep their original morphology, narrow their optical band gap, and enhance their carrier mobility and photo-response dramatically after induced conversion by MA gas molecules, especially for DMAPbI3 (NH2(CH3)2PbI3). The optical band gap of DMAPbI3 was lowered from 2.58 eV to 1.53 eV and its photo-response performance was enhanced greatly by even a small amount of replacement of DMA+ by MA+, which provides a new idea for designing novel hybrid perovskite single crystals with a desired morphology and their optoelectronic devices with good performance.
Introduction
Due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, moderate bandgap, longer carrier diffusion length and facile processing ability,1–3 hybrid perovskites, such as MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, have been widely used in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, and they have rapidly attracted the world's attention.4–11 In general, the formula of metal halide perovskites has been described as ABX3, where A+ is an organic cation or cesium cation (Cs+), B+ is a metal cation, and X− is a halide anion.12,13 In principle, the physical and chemical properties, such as morphology coverage, dimensional geometry, optical band gap and optoelectronic properties, can be tailored by the selection of A+, B+ and X− ions, while the morphology coverage and dimensional geometry play an important role in the application of hybrid perovskite materials.14–19 Better control of the morphology coverage and dimensional geometry can enable us to better design photoelectric devices with high performance.
1D and 2D hybrid perovskites have been proposed as having promising morphologies for the application of photoelectric devices because of their large active surface area and higher charge carrier injection efficiencies.20–22 However, unlike MAPbI3, most hybrid perovskites, like DMAPbI3 ((NH2(CH3)2 = DMA, 1D), BA2PbI4 (C4H9NH3 = BA, 2D) and other low-dimensional (1D and 2D) single crystals, possess a narrow absorption wavelength with a large band gap >2 eV, which have been demonstrated to be not very useful materials for optoelectronic devices like single-junction solar cells.23 In order to extend their photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, there is an urgent need for band gap engineering with a wide absorption wavelength.
Although tremendous efforts have been directed towards gaining the better tailoring of band gaps for hybrid perovskites such as the selection of B+ and halide exchange,24–27 which have both been demonstrated to be powerful tools for tuning the optical absorption wavelength,18,19,28 a phenomenon of photo-induced phase segregation caused by halide ion migration widely hinders their application when mixed halide anion (Br–I) compounds are used to tune optical bandgaps.20,29 To overcome this phenomenon, a more convenient and effective process for tuning the optical band gap of hybrid perovskite materials with desired morphology remains highly challenging.
The solid to liquid transformation process induced by methylamine (CH3NH2 = MA) gas offers us a promising platform.23,30,31 Cui et al. reported the defect-healing behaviour of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films induced by methylamine gas and show dramatic enhancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which exhibit the applied advantages of gas induction.30 However, all of them focus on nanocrystals or thin films, rather than on large-sized single crystals,14 while the fundamental properties of these perovskite materials cannot be fully understood. To further explore the fundamental properties of these materials, large perovskite single crystals can serve as an ideal scaffold due to the lower number of grain boundaries and surface defects. However, work has rarely been reported on large-sized hybrid perovskite single crystals, much less the transformation of broad band gap hybrid perovskite from single crystal to single crystal with a narrowed band gap and desired morphology retained.
Here, with broad band gap hybrid perovskite (1D/2D) single crystals as a template, we design a conversion strategy from single crystal to single crystal induced by MA gas under an ambient atmosphere. Interestingly, after the introduction of MA gas molecules, these single crystals kept their original morphology and narrowed their optical band gap dramatically, such as DMAPbI3 whose band gap decreased from 2.58 eV to 1.53 eV. Simultaneously, the carrier mobility and the photo-response performance were enhanced greatly. Other materials, such as DMAPbI3 (NH2(CH3)2 = DMA), BA2PbI4 (C4H9NH3 = BA) and so forth, also exhibited similar phenomena, which demonstrates the universality of the gas-induced process and widely extends the optoelectronic applications of broad band gap hybrid perovskite materials.
Results and discussion
All the reaction units were placed in a heater at 120 °C, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The original DMAPbI3 exhibits a rod-like morphology with a yellow colour, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Then the colour turned from yellow to black as MA gas was introduced, which is depicted in Fig. 1(c). This change process of DMAPbI3 can also be demonstrated by the XRD patterns (Fig. 1(d)). With an extension of induction time, the colour turned to black gradually and the peaks of MAPbI3 appeared with the formation of MAxDMA1−xPbI3. The longer the induction time, the more DMA+ cations will be replaced and finally we get MAPbI3. This replacement process can be demonstrated by elemental analysis, in which the conversion of single crystals was induced by MA gas for 24 h, as shown in Table 1. The decreased content of C element can be easily found after the introduction of MA gas, which demonstrated a replacement of DMA+ by MA+. A similar phenomenon can also be found in the large-sized 2D layered morphology of a BA2PbI4 single crystal accompanied by the formation of hybrid perovskite (MA0.32BA0.68)2PbI4, as shown in Fig. S1.†

The detailed transformation of a DMAPbI3 single crystal was a slow process and was first observed in situ using a polarizing microscope, as shown in Fig. 2. The original solution-grown DMAPbI3 crystal exhibits a rod-like yellow morphology. Once MA gas is introduced, the MA molecules will touch the surface of the DMAPbI3 single crystal, and then replace the DMA cations which leads to the colour of the DMAPbI3 single crystal first gradually turning from yellow, to red to black. After exposure to the MA gas for about 24 h, the surface of the DMAPbI3 single crystal turns completely black and a longer time is needed for more DMA+ cations to be replaced by MA+. Furthermore, the detailed transformation processes of BA2PbI4 single crystals are also similar to those of DMAPbI3, as shown in Fig. S2.† Most interestingly, this transformation exhibits a universal process and can also be observed in other hybrid perovskite materials, such as DMAPbI3, BA2PbI4, HA2PbI4 (C6H13NH3 = HA), OA2PbI4 (C8H17NH3 = OA) and GAPbI3, (C(NH2)3 = GA), as shown in Fig. S3.†

In situ optical microscope observation of the transformation of DMAPbI3 to MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 induced by MA gas. 
Although DMAPbI3 single crystal turns black after induced conversion for 24 h, the DMAPbI3 was not completely transformed into MAPbI3, and its crystal morphology and structure stayed the same, which can be demonstrated by their crystal structure. Fig. 3(a and b) displays the ball-and-stick diagrams of the crystal structures of DMAPbI3 before and after the introduction of MA gas. The crystal structure remains stable and both belong to the hexagonal crystal system and P63/mmc space group, which is the same as reported for DMAPbI3,32 and different from that of MAPbI3 (tetragonal, I4cm). However, the lattice parameters and the volume of MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 are smaller than those of DMAPbI3. After 10 days of transformation at 120 °C, a cubic single crystal with Pm-3m space group was obtained, as shown in Fig. 3(c). This transformation can also be demonstrated by powder XRD with a better stability after exposure to air for 15 days, as illustrated in Fig. 3(d) and S4.† The peak of cubic phase MAPbI3 was exhibited when the conversion of DMAPbI3 was induced for 10 days by MA gas. The related single-crystal parameters of DMAPbI3 single crystal to MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 and MAPbI3 single crystal are presented in Table S1 (see the ESI†). Thus, based on the XRD patterns, their single crystal structures and the elemental analysis confirmed by the combustion method, the mechanism for the transformation from DMAPbI3 single crystal to MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 single crystal and finally to MAPbI3 induced by MA gas is proposed, as shown in Fig. 3(e), where the DMA+ cations will be replaced by the MA+ cations. If a longer time is provided, the DMAPbI3 will be replaced by MAPbI3, similar to the previous reports about films.23,31 Here, the DMA+ cations are partially replaced by the MA+ cations after 24 h, and the existence of MA+ can also be demonstrated by an analysis of infrared and nuclear magnetic spectra, as shown in Fig S5.† Similar analysis to the above is shown in Fig S6† for (MA0.32BA0.68)2PbI4.

Although a small amount of DMA+ cations were replaced, the optical properties of DMAPbI3 were correspondingly obviously changed, after the introduction of MA gas. The optical band gaps (Eg) of the samples are determined from UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the band gap calculated from UV-vis near-IR absorption spectra via the Kubelka–Munk formula.33,34 Notably, the DMAPbI3 shows a large band gap of 2.58 eV, as revealed by the inset tangent plot, and its photoluminescence peak position of DMAPbI3 is also located at 510 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Surprisingly, the MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 displays a significant 290 nm red-shifted light absorption peak with an optical band gap of 1.53 eV, as shown in Fig. 4(b). However, this did not exhibit phase separation compared with the mixture of MAPbI3 and DMAPbI3, as shown in Fig S7.† It is also apparent that the optical band gap of MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 is different from that of MAPbI3 (1.48 eV).34 Time-resolved photoluminescence exhibits the carrier lifetime of DMAPbI3 (1.29 ns) and MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 (2.19 ns), which are both much shorter than the reported results for MAPbI3.35 Similar changes were also exhibited from BA2PbI4 and (MA0.32BA0.68)2PbI4, with the band gap lowered to 1.55 eV from 2.29 eV and the carrier lifetime extending to 58 ns from 206 ps, as shown in Fig. S8.†

(f) Carrier mobility measurements of MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 and DMAPbI3 single crystals by Hall effect measurements at room temperature. 
The trap-state density ntrap and the carrier mobility μ (μ = μp ≈ μn, where μp and μn are the hole and electron mobility, respectively) of MA0.2DMA0.8I3 single crystals were also estimated according to the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model, as shown in Fig. 4(e, f).35–37 With the increasing bias voltage, ohmic and quadratic regions were clearly separated, where the kink point is the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), determined by the defect density, as follows (eqn (1)): (1)where e is the elementary charge, nt is the defect density, L is the thickness of MA0.2DMA0.8I3 single crystals (0.17 mm), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant. For instance, the defect density of MA0.2DMA0.8I3 was estimated to be 2.1 × 1010 cm−3 using the relative dielectric constant ε = 4.03. The carrier mobility of MA0.2DMA0.8I3 was also estimated to be 35.3 cm2 V−1 s−1, according to the Mott–Gurney power law:35–37 (2)where JD, ε, ε0, μ, Vb, and L are the dark current, the relative dielectric constant, the vacuum permittivity, the mobility of single crystals, the applied voltage, and the thickness of the single crystal, respectively. This mobility value matches well with the result of the Hall effect measurements, as shown in Fig. 4(f), which is higher than that of DMAPbI3.
As we know, a proper optical absorption range and band gap are beneficial for extending the applications of photodetectors.38,39 Thus, the primary photocurrent response characteristics of MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 single crystals were investigated under a laser wavelength of 532 nm with a laser power from 20 to 60 mW. Fig. 5(a) shows a schematic illustration of the photocurrent response of DMAPbI3 and MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 single crystals. Typical current versus voltage plots of the single crystal photodetectors for DMAPbI3 and MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 are exhibited in Fig. 5(b) and a larger photocurrent of MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 is shown when the same voltage was applied. The on–off current ratio of DMAPbI3 is about 8 under a laser wavelength of 532 nm (Fig. 5(c)). However, a dramatic enhancement in photo-response for MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 single crystals is demonstrated with an on–off current ratio up to 330, as shown in Fig. 5(d). The current–voltage curves of the device measured in the dark and light at different power intensities are shown in Fig. 5(d). At the same voltage, the light current increases obviously with the increase in light power intensities and the on–off ratios can reach 103 with a laser power of 60 mW. More detailed studies are being carried out in order to obtain better photo-response performance. In addition, photodetectors based on thin films also exhibited a similar phenomenon with a dramatic enhancement in the photo-response, as shown in Fig. 5(f–j).

The decomposition temperature of DMAPbI3 and MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3 single crystals was also obtained. Fig. 6(a and b) show the TGA and DSC data for DMAPbI3 and MA0.2DMA0.8PbI3. Both possess relatively good thermal stability, with their decomposition temperature of 300 °C, exhibiting a much better thermal stability. The DSC at low temperatures ranging from 150 K to 410 K was also measured to determine the phase transition temperature, as shown in Fig. 6(c, d). It can be clearly observed that the phase transition temperature of both is about 250 K. When the temperature was lowered to 250 K, the trigonal hexagonal crystal system with a P63/mmc space group transformed into the monoclinic with a space group of P21/c, as shown in Fig. 6(e, f), which is consistent with the previous report.32

Conclusions
In conclusion, with the 1D and 2D broad band gap hybrid perovskite as a template, we successfully transformed these single crystals into narrowed band gap single crystals with an unchanged morphology and enhanced photoelectric properties by a universal transformation process induced by MA gas molecules under an ambient atmosphere. This transformation provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of new hybrid perovskite single crystals based on their original morphology coverage and dimensional geometry and also provides guidance for the design of hybrid perovskite single-crystal optoelectronic devices in the desired morphology with good performance.
