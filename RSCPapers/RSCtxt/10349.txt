    , Accepted 1st August 2022First published on 2nd August 2022AbstractThe electrode based on the conversion reaction of Mn2+/MnO2 is regarded as a promising cathode for aqueous proton batteries (APBs) due to its high redox potential and cost-effectiveness, but it needs a strongly acidic medium to trigger this redox reaction. Herein, a mild perchlorate-based electrolyte without strong acid addition (3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2) is proposed to improve the deposition/dissolution efficiency of Mn2+/MnO2. Comprehensive analyses confirm that the ClO4− anion not only ensures the fast and stable deposition of Mn2+ by regulating the solvation energy of Mn2+ but also accelerates the dissolution of MnO2 by improving the degree of freedom of water molecules. Hence, the novel aqueous proton battery with a carbon felt (CF) cathode, polyaniline anode and 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte exhibits a lifetime of 500 cycles with an 81.6% capacity retention rate and excellent rate capability of up to 100C (18 A g−1). Surprisingly, this system operates well even at low-temperature conditions because of the anti-freezing electrolyte with a −122 °C freezing point. High discharge capacities of 112 mA h g−1 and 52.9 mA h g−1 are obtained at −50 °C and −70 °C, respectively.
1 Introduction
Large-scale energy storage systems are in urgent need of attention because of their ability to integrate renewable energy such as wind and solar energy.1–4 Impressively, rechargeable aqueous batteries (ABs) stand out among the various energy storage systems due to their cost-effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness.5–8 Commonly, metal ions (for example, Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Al3+, etc.) are used as charge carriers for ABs, but their sluggish diffusion kinetics caused by their high de-solvation energy and strong interactions with host materials tend to form more stable ion pairs in solution and limit the electrochemical performance of ABs.9–15 In contrast, the hydrogen ion (H+) is a promising charge carrier because of its light atomic weight, small ionic radius and “Grotthuss” transfer mechanism, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with rapid reaction kinetics.16,17 In addition, benefiting from these unique merits, APBs exhibit excellent low-temperature electrochemical performance.18,19 Thus, novel APBs have to be further considered and developed to broaden the practical application of ABs.
Matching suitable electrode materials for the cathode and anode is the key to constructing APBs. To date, various anode materials (e.g., quinone-based organic materials,20,21 conjugate amine compounds,22,23 transition metal oxides,24,25etc.) have been reported, but few cathode materials can be selected due to the lack of original H+-host materials. For example, Prussian blue analogues (e.g. CuFe-TBA,18 CuHCF,26etc.) have the ability to store H+ with high operating potential but low discharge specific capacity (∼80 mA h g−1). Moreover, the H+-pre-insertion strategy for Prussian blue analogues has to be carried out to fabricate rocking-chair APBs, which increases the difficulty of the fabrication and assembling processes of batteries.18 Besides, cathode materials such as MnO2@CF (reversible two-electron MnO2/Mn2+ reaction) and PbO2 that are based on the conversion-type mechanism are attractive owing to their high redox potential and reliable cycling stability.19,27,28 Although the Pb-acid battery has achieved great success after more than 160 years of development, the toxicity and environmental unfriendliness of electrodes containing Pb limit its further application.29 Thus, MnO2@CF with high redox potential (1.23 V vs. SHE), high theoretical specific capacity (606 mA h g−1), rich crustal abundance (No. 12) and low toxicity is a more promising alternative as a cathode material for APBs.
It is a crucial challenge to solve the low deposition/dissolution efficiency of Mn2+/MnO2. Continuous protonation of a surface O atom facilitates the dissolution of MnO2 and release Mn2+ and H2O (MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e− → Mn2+ + 2H2O).1 It is worth noting that the solid–liquid conversion process of MnO2 is difficult, and commonly needs strong acidic conditions (Table S1†). For instance, the MnO2@GF electrode in 2 M H2SO4 + 2 M MnSO4 electrolyte was reported by Wang et al. and shows a high coulombic efficiency near 100%.17,30 However, the strong acidic electrolytes have a corrosive character and serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the redox potential of anode materials will be affected by the concentration of acid, which will limit the operating voltage of APBs.31 Therefore, it is urgent to find a suitable mild electrolyte to achieve the deposition/dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2. The type of anion in mild electrolytes will affect their pH value and solvation structure.1,32,33 It is therefore very feasible to achieve a high deposition/dissolution efficiency of Mn2+/MnO2 by manipulating the type of anion with different mild electrolytes.
Another concern is the low-temperature performance of APBs, which relies on the freezing point of electrolytes. The freezing electrolytes show low ionic conductivity, high interface impedance, sluggish reaction kinetics and high polarization, resulting in unsatisfactory electrochemical performance.29,34–36 Thus, keeping the electrolyte liquid at low-temperature conditions is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of APBs. The reported APBs that can work at low-temperature conditions have to use high-concentration acidic electrolytes with low freezing point (e.g. 5 M H2SO4,18 9.5 M H3PO4,37etc.), but these electrolytes can have a high cost and are corrosive. Alternatively, mild electrolytes at a suitable concentration are worth considering because their freezing points can be controlled by configuring the interaction between anion and water molecules.32,34,38
Herein, a high conversion-efficiency Mn2+/MnO2 cathode in a mild electrolyte is proposed for the aqueous proton (H+) battery (APB) by optimizing the salt anions. Perchlorate salt, Mn(ClO4)2 was selected to achieve a highly reversible Mn2+/MnO2 redox reaction. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ClO4− anion not only facilitates the deposition of Mn2+ but also accelerates the dissolution of MnO2 because of weak interactions with anions and water molecules. Thus, the carbon felt (CF) cathode based on the conversion reaction of Mn2+/MnO2 showed a high coulombic efficiency of 98.4% in mild Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte. Further, a novel APB with polyaniline (PANI) anode, 3.5 M (mol L−1) Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte and CF cathode was constructed, which showed extraordinary electrochemical performance. In brief, the APB exhibited high capacity retention of 81.6% at 1.8 A g−1 over 500 cycles and an excellent rate capability of 89.1 mA h g−1 at 18 A g−1. Furthermore, benefiting from the ultralow freezing point of 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte (−122 °C), this system can durably operate at −70 °C and obtain a discharge capacity of 53 mA h g−1.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of PANI material
PANI material is prepared by simple one-step synthesis. For a typical run, 0.365 mL of aniline monomer was added to 15 mL of HCl solution (1 M) under stirring in an ice bath for 1 h. Then, 5 mL of HCl (1 M) containing 0.228 g of ammonium persulfate was added to the above solution dropwise under an ice bath. When the reaction continued for 1 h, a green sample was obtained after thoroughly washing with deionized water and ethanol, and drying at 80 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Material characterization
The crystallographic structures of the PANI and CF electrodes were analysed by XRD (Rigaku SmartLab 9KW X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα). The morphologies and microstructures of PANI and CF electrodes were examined by SEM (JEOLJSM-7500F) and HRTEM (FEITalosF200XG2). XPS (PHI5000VersaProbeESCALAB250xi) was used to characterize the intermediate PANI and CF electrodes at various states. The characteristics of different anion-salt solutions were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, BRUKER TENSOR II (FTS6000)). The freezing points of Mn(ClO4)2 solutions with different concentrations were tested by a DSC system (METTLER TOLEDO, DSC 3+). This was carried out at +25 to −150 °C with a cooling rate of 5 °C min−1, and scans from −150 °C to +25 °C at 2 °C min−1. The pH values of different anion-salt solutions were determined using a pH monitor (PHS-2F) with a pH combination electrode (E-201-C). All low-temperature tests were performed in an ultra-low temperature storage box (MELNG, DW-HW50).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The PANI electrodes were prepared by mixing the as-prepared PANI, Ketjen black (KB), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in an appropriate weight ratio of 7:2:1; the mixture was compressed into wafers (Φ 8 mm) and pressed onto a stainless steel mesh (Φ 12 mm). Then the electrodes were dried at 80 °C for 12 h under a vacuum. The PANI mass loading was 1–2 mg cm−2. The half-cell tests used a three-electrode system with a PANI//CF work electrode, Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (saturated solution of KCl, 0.1981 V vs. SHE). The size of the CF was 1 cm × 1 cm. Argon gas was continuously pumped into these electrolytes for 8 hours to remove oxygen. For full battery tests, 50 μL (73.06 mg) of 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 was used as an electrolyte, and the CF electrode was pre-wetted with the electrolyte. The 2032-type coin cells were assembled by CF as the cathode, PANI as the anode, filter paper (Φ = 16 mm) as the separator, and standing for about 8 h. CV tests were performed using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China). The voltage range of the PANI//CF battery was from 0.3 to 1.5 V. The discharge/charge tests were conducted on a LAND-CT2001A battery testing instrument, and the specific capacities are based on the mass of the active materials (PANI) in the anode. 1C is defined as 180 mA g−1 (based on the theoretical specific capacity of PANI).
2.4 Computational details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 16 program. Geometry optimization and frequency analyses were performed in water as the solvent with the SMD solvation model. C, H, O, N, and S were determined using the B3LYP functional and 6-31+G (d, p) basis set. Mn2+ was determined using the B3LYP functional and def2tzvp basis set.
3 Results and discussion
As mentioned above, anions have an important impact on the solvation structures of cations and water. Therefore, four commonly used Mn salts with different anions were selected for research, namely, MnSO4, Mn(CH3COO)2, Mn(NO3)2 and Mn(ClO4)2. The interactions of these anions with cations and water will affect the deposition/dissolution reaction of Mn2+/MnO2. Thus, the relationship between the intensity of the above interaction and deposition/dissolution efficiency of Mn2+/MnO2 should be clarified. The electrostatic potentials (ESP) of different anions were calculated and shown in Fig. 1a. The negative ESP of these anions is mainly focused around the oxygen (O) atoms, indicating that the H atoms of H2O tend to interact with anions there. Among the different anions, the SO42− with two negative charges has the lowest negative ESP value of −9.80 eV, and the ClO4− with a negative charge has the highest negative ESP value of −5.17 eV. The binding energies between anions and cations (Mn2+) were calculated and are summarized in Fig. 1b. The binding energy of ClO4− and Mn2+ is −0.23 eV, which is higher than that of other anions and water molecules (the more negative the energy value, the stronger the binding ability). The higher binding energy implies a higher solvation energy level of Mn2+, therefore the Mn2+ is more easily de-solvated during the deposition process.32 It is worth noting that the binding ability of Mn2+ with SO42− (−1.31 eV) is close to that with CH3COO− (−1.32 eV). Similarly, the binding energies of anions and H2O follow the order of CH3COO−–H2O < SO42−–H2O < NO3−–H2O < ClO4−–H2O (Fig. 1c). The dissolution process of MnO2 requires more H+ to attack the host O atoms. As such, the higher the concentration of H+, the easier the dissolution of MnO2. It is worth noting that the concentration of H+ is adjusted by both cations and anions. In mild Mn-salt electrolytes, the H+ originates from the hydrolysis of Mn2+. The anions, for example CH3COO−, will facilitate the ionization of H2O to form CH3COOH and corresponding OH−. Thus, for Mn-salt electrolytes, the pH of the solution depends on the anion type and its interaction with H2O. The weak binding ability of ClO4− and H2O indicates that water molecules have a high degree of freedom in Mn(ClO4)2 aqueous solution, resulting in the difficult ionization of water molecules. Also, it was confirmed from DFT calculations that the ClO4− anion not only facilitates the deposition of Mn2+ through weakening its solvation ability but also accelerates the dissolution of MnO2 by suppressing the ionization of water molecules.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was also utilized to demonstrate the influence of anions on water molecules. The O–H stretching vibrations of H2O at 2500 to 4000 cm−1 were attributed to strong hydrogen bonds (HB), medium HB, and weak HB, respectively (Fig. S1 and S2†). The ratios of different types of HB are summarized in Fig. 1d. As shown in Fig. 1d, the 1 M Mn(ClO4)2 solution showed a lower ratio of strong HB and a higher ratio of weak HB in comparison with other solutions (1 M), suggesting a higher degree of freedom for water molecules. Thus, the pH value of 1 M Mn(ClO4)2 solution is lower than other 1 M solutions, which is consistent with the DFT calculations. The deposition/dissolution reaction of Mn2+/MnO2 on carbon felt (CF) was further tested in four salt solutions. CF, as the current collector, possesses good stability and anti-corrosion properties. During the charging process, the CF electrode rapidly reached a stable deposition voltage in 1 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte and showed a high voltage of about 0.94 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. S3†). During the discharging process, the CF electrode exhibited a high and flat discharge platform in the 1 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte (Fig. 1e). Although the CF electrode in 1 M Mn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte also shows a stable discharge platform, the platform voltage is low (about 0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl). In addition, the CF electrode had a stable discharge capacity after the 40-cycle activation process in 1 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte and showed a high coulombic efficiency of 98.4% (Fig. S4a†). However, the activation period of the CF electrode was too long and its discharge capacity was unstable in other electrolytes (Fig. S4b–d†). The CF electrode also maintained a high coulombic efficiency at 4 mA cm−2 over 500 cycles in 1 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte (Fig. S5†). These results demonstrate the double effects of the ClO4− anion for the conversion reaction of Mn2+/MnO2.
The redox potential of the cathode for APBs should be firstly considered, which is affected by electrolyte concentration.39 To achieve a higher discharge voltage, the electrochemical performances of CF electrodes in different concentrations of Mn(ClO4)2 solutions were tested. As shown in Fig. 1f and S6,† a high charge voltage platform of 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a discharge voltage platform of 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl were obtained in 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte, which are higher than those at other electrolyte concentrations. The freezing point of a solution reflects the HB interaction between water molecules, and weak interactions correspond to a low freezing point.35,36 As shown in Fig. 1g, the discharge platform voltages of CF electrodes in different electrolytes are negatively related to the freezing point of different electrolytes. Impressively, the 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 solution exhibited an ultralow freezing point of −122 °C (Fig. S7†) because of the destructive effect of ClO4− anions on the HB network among water molecules.38,40 The cycling stabilities of the CF electrode at 1 mA cm−2 in different concentrations of Mn(ClO4)2 electrolytes were tested and shown in Fig. S8a–d.† In particular, the CF electrode shows increased discharge voltage and capacity over 50 activations in the 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte (Fig. S9†). The CF electrode in 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte was also tested over 500 cycles at a current density of 4 mA cm−2 and obtained a high coulombic efficiency (Fig. 1h). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CF electrode with different scan rates in the 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte were obtained and shown in Fig. S10.† It is worth noting that a full oxidation peak does not appear, which can be attributed to excess Mn2+ in the electrolyte.17,30 In addition, with the increased concentration, the deposition morphology of MnO2 on the surface of the CF electrode became denser and denser (Fig. S11†). Based on the above discussions, the 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 solution is more suitable for the highly reversible deposition/dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2 and is expected to achieve excellent low-temperature performance.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to qualitatively analyze the deposition compound on the CF cathode after charging to 10 mA h. As shown in Fig. 2a, the clear diffraction peaks match well with the (100), (002), (102) and (110) crystalline planes of the standard ε-MnO2 (PDF#30-0820, space group: P63/mmc), which suggests that the Mn2+ is oxidized to MnO2 during the charged process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 2b shows the uniform micron-sized flakes of the MnO2 material deposited on the CF electrode. The Mn and O elements are distributed homogeneously on the CF electrode surface from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping (Fig. 2c). As shown in Fig. 2d, a typical (100) crystalline plane with a d-spacing of 0.24 nm was detected by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Mn 3s was conducted to determine the chemical valence state for the Mn element. The average oxidation state (AOS) of Mn was determined according to the following eqn (1):41–43 AOS = 8.956 − 1.126ΔEs(1)ΔEs refers to the gap of the binding energy between the double Mn 3s peaks (Fig. 2e). According to this equation, the AOS of Mn was calculated to be 4.06, which is close to the theoretical valence state (+4). The O 1s spectrum can be fitted to three components, corresponding to lattice oxygen species at 529.4 eV, surface adsorbed oxygen ions at 530.8 eV and adsorbed water at 532.6 eV, respectively (Fig. S12†). The surface adsorbed oxygen is from trivalent Mn–O species (MnOOH), and the adsorbed water corresponds to the residual water of materials. Additionally, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) was used to quantitatively monitor the oxidation products deposited on the CF electrode during the charging process. EQCM registers the mass change (Δm) versus charge change (dq) in the active materials attached to the quartz surface.44 The molar mass of active material per electron transfer can be calculated from the slope k (Δm/dq) and Faraday constant F (96485 C mol−1).27 As shown in Fig. 2f, the mass change per electron Δm/dq = 45.3 g mol−1 of e−, which is rather close to the formula mass of MnO2 (86.9 g mol−1 for two-electron transfer). Thus, the reactions on the CF electrode can be summarized as follows:

Charging process Mn2+ + 2H2O → MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e−(2)
Discharging process MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e− → Mn2+ + 2H2O(3)
The polyaniline (PANI) compound, with high conductivity and stable structure, was chosen as the anode for APB. To confirm the ion storage mechanism of PANI in 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte, DFT calculations were first performed. The pentamer including two conjugated chemical bonds (–CN–) and two amine sites (–C–NH–) was designed and simulated.45 As shown in Fig. S13,† the conjugated centers offer high electronegativity, which allows the uptake/removal of cations. The low energy gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) – highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) suggests the high intrinsic electronic conductivity of PANI (Fig. S14†). The energy level of PANI-H (PANI binds one H+) is lower than PANI-Mn (PANI binds one Mn2+), indicating that the PANI tends to bind H+ during the reduction reaction (Fig. 3a). The ex situ XPS spectra of N 1s were collected. In the initial state, the N 1s is divided into three components corresponding to the conjugated imine –N, amine –NH– and protonated imine –NH+, respectively (Fig. 3b). A high ratio of conjugated imine of 70.4% implies rich sites for the storage of H+. After charging, the ratio of –N decreased to 15% and –NH– increased to 85% as a result of H+ insertion (Fig. 3c). The intensity of –N increased and –NH– decreased during the discharging process, indicating the good reversibility of PANI (Fig. 3d). The possible reaction mechanism of PANI is summarized in Fig. S15.† Since the as-prepared PANI is in the half-oxidation state, doped (NH+–) and undoped (–N) nitrogen are present. During the discharging process (half-cell test), since NH+– in PANI gains electrons to be reduced to –NH–, the Cl− would be removed from the PANI. At the same time, the N– in PANI is reduced to –N–, which could interact with the H+. During the charging process (half-cell test), the –NH– in PANI is oxidized to N–. The –NH+– in PANI is constantly consumed and transformed into –NH– during the discharge process. Thus, lots of N– and –NH– groups in PANI were detected in the charged and discharged states. The content of –NH+– was too low to be detected by XPS. Ex situ XRD patterns of PANI were collected and shown in Fig. S16.† Note that the Mn 2p signal is not detected in the charged state, suggesting that the Mn2+ does not participate in the redox reaction of PANI (Fig. 3e). This point is also confirmed by the ex situ TEM mapping images of PANI material. As displayed in Fig. 3f, the missing Mn element in the initial, charged and discharged states of PANI electrodes indicates that it is not the charge carrier, which is consistent with the results of TEM-EDS (Table S2†).

The electrochemical performances of PANI material were tested by a three-electrode system (PANI as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 as the electrolyte). The half-cell shows a pair of redox peaks at 0.09 V vs. Ag/AgCl (reduction) and 0.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl (oxidation) from the CV curves at 5 mV s−1 (Fig. S17†). The PANI exhibited excellent cycling stability and maintained a high discharge capacity of 114.5 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at 5C (1C = 180 mA g−1) (Fig. S18†). Note that the fluctuation of capacity resulted from the fluctuation of room temperature; PANI exhibited good cycling stability when the temperature remained stable. The discharge platform and voltage polarization showed no obvious changes during the charging/discharging process (Fig. S19†). In addition, the PANI electrode also presented excellent rate capability with a discharge capacity of 76.8 mA h g−1 at 80C (14.4 A g−1), due to the fast diffusion kinetics of H+ (Fig. S20†). The b value is used to evaluate the type of ions transfer kinetics, which was calculated by the following eqn (4):46 i = avb(4)i and v refer to the peak current (mA) and scan rate (mV s−1). a and b are adjustment parameters. b = 0.5 indicates that the ion transfer process is controlled by diffusion behavior, and b = 1 suggests that the ion transfer process is controlled by capacitance behavior. The peak current and scan rate were obtained from different scan-rate CV curves (Fig. S21†), and calculated b values were 0.77 and 0.86 for peak 1 and peak 2, respectively (Fig. S22†). The calculated results suggest that the H+ transfer process in PANI is dominated by both diffusion and surface-capacitance behavior. The ratios of different types of behavior are quantified by eqn (5) and (6):47 i = k1v + k2v1/2(5) (6)k1v corresponds to the current contributed by the capacitance behavior, and the k2v1/2 refers to the current contributed by the Faraday behavior. The higher the ratio of capacitance contribution, the faster the ion transfer kinetics. As shown in Fig. S23,† the ratio of capacitance contribution increased from 75.9% to 87.6% with increased scan rate. The capacitance behavior may be caused by the unique reaction mechanism of organic materials. Briefly, the charge carriers can quickly bind with the exposed electrically-active sites on the surface of organic materials rather than being inserted into their interior.
The APB was constructed with the PANI anode, CF cathode and 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte. Benefiting from the mild electrolyte, the coin-cell shells maintained their brightness and no by-products were detected on the stainless steel current collector (SS) after soaking for a week (Fig. S24†). Note that the active cathode (Mn2+) is dissolved in the electrolyte. The specific capacity and current density were calculated based on the active mass of PANI for the sake of statistics. The PANI//CF battery showed impressive rate performance. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 100C (18 A g−1), 85 mA h g−1 of discharge capacity was obtained (Fig. 4a). The discharge capacity did not recover to the initial level when current density returned to 2C because of the slight capacity fading of this battery at low current density (Fig. 4b). Additionally, this system showed a low coulombic efficiency at a low current density (Fig. S25†), which may be caused by irreversible side reactions (for example, the Mn3+ disproportionation reaction for the CF electrode or the hydrogen evolution reaction for the PANI electrode). Different scan-rate CV curves were collected and shown in Fig. S26.† The b values were fitted to be 0.71 and 0.80 according to the slope of the log(peak current) vs. log(scan rate), which implies that the pseudocapacitance behavior dominates H+ transfer (Fig. S27†). The capacitance contribution ratios at different scan rates were calculated and summarized in Fig. S28.† The b values and capacitance contribution ratios revealed the essence of the good rate performance of the PANI//CF battery from a kinetics perspective. As shown in Fig. 4c and S29,† this system maintained a high discharge capacity of 93.3 mA h g−1 at 10C (1.8 A g−1) over 500 cycles, corresponding to an 82% capacity retention rate. A high specific energy density of 62.2 W h kg−1 was obtained at a specific power density of 13176 W kg−1 (Fig. 4d), which is better than the reported works.18,20–22,29–31 Benefiting from the highly reversible deposition/dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2 on the CF electrode and fast uptake/removal of H+ in the PANI anode, the APB showed satisfactory electrochemical performance. Two coin batteries in series can drive the LED lights to work properly (Fig. 4e). It is worth noting that the utilization of the electrolyte (50 μL) at 2C was only 1.3%, which is very low (the calculation details are in the ESI†). For the PANI//CF battery, the capacity is limited by the anode due to the excess electrolyte. PANI was selected to verify the feasibility of the cathode (based on the conversion reaction of Mn2+/MnO2) in this battery. Therefore, from practical consideration, the development of a novel anode material with a higher theoretical specific capacity to match the CF@MnO2 electrode is urgently needed.

As mentioned above, the 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte has a low freezing point of −122 °C, which enables APB to have the potential for low-temperature operation. The PANI//CF battery was firstly tested at −50 °C. As shown in Fig. 5a, the APB showed a high discharge capacity of 112 mA h g−1 at 1C. When the current density increased to 10C (1.8 A g−1), the battery maintained 79.3 mA h g−1 of discharge capacity, which is 84% of room-temperature capacity. Moreover, it presented good capacity reversibility when the current density returned to 1C (Fig. 5b). This APB had no capacity fading at 0.5C after 190 cycles (Fig. 5c), and the operating voltage and polarization had no shift during the charge/discharge process (Fig. S30†). Surprisingly, when the temperature was further reduced to −70 °C, this system could also work and had a discharge capacity of 52.9 mA h g−1 at 0.3C (50 mA g−1). The fluctuation of charge–discharge curves can be attributed to unstable temperature (Fig. 5d). It is noted that the rate performance of the PANI//CF battery at −70 °C is unsatisfactory, which can be attributed to low concentrations of H+ and sluggish reaction kinetics (Fig. S31†). As shown in Fig. 5e, the battery can operate stably at −70 °C and shows a durable life. The low-temperature performance of the PANI//CF battery is superior to reported systems (Fig. 5f).18,34–36,48

4 Conclusions
In summary, an aqueous proton battery based on a mild 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte was developed, which showed impressive wide-temperature electrochemical performance (+25 to −70 °C). Comprehensive analyses including DFT calculations and electrochemical tests demonstrated the double effects of the ClO4− anion in terms of the improvement of the deposition/dissolution efficiency of Mn2+/MnO2. In brief, the ClO4− anion not only promotes the deposition of Mn2+ by weakening its solvation ability but also accelerates the dissolution of MnO2 by improving the degrees of freedom of water molecules. Polyaniline was used as the anode and its H+ uptake/removal mechanism was confirmed. Thus, the APB was fabricated with the CF cathode, PANI anode and 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte. The battery exhibited excellent rate performance (85 mA h g−1 of discharge capacity at 100C) and cycling stability (82% capacity retention rate over 500 cycles). Benefiting from the ultralow freezing point of the 3.5 M Mn(ClO4)2 electrolyte (−122 °C), this APB still obtained a high discharge capacity of 112 mA h g−1 at −50 °C and 52.9 mA h g−1, even at −70 °C. These encouraging results will be of immediate benefit in the development of APBs for practical energy storage.
