    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractSodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been attracting great interest as alternatives for grid and mobile energy storage applications in the modern world due to the sufficient natural abundance and low cost of sodium resources. To accelerate the practical application of SIB systems, the electrochemical performance of cathode materials should be further improved to satisfy the increasing worldwide demand. As promising cathode materials for SIBs, layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) exhibit high specific capacity and high energy density due to their appropriate voltage window. Here, recent progress and achievements of three representative LTMOs including Ni-based, Mn-based, and Ni/Mn co-based cathodes in terms of the relationship between structural design and electrochemical performance are summarized, aiming at cost reduction and performance improvement. The insights in this review focus on the development of LTMOs as cathodes for SIBs including overall battery performance, preparation strategies and operation mechanism, therefore speeding up the commercialization of SIBs.Shenghan WangShenghan Wang received his B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the Jilin University in 2013 and 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Chenglin Sun.

1. Introduction
Rechargeable batteries are indispensable and extensive applied in modern world.1–5 In recent years, two main aspects have driven the development of rechargeable batteries: (1) the demand for powering mobile electronic devices including electric vehicles (EVs), notebook type personal computers (PCs) and so on, and (2) the demand for building stationary grid electrical energy storage (EES) systems to integrate renewable sources, which are intermittent and regional.6,7 Apart from the frequently used mobile phones and PCs, which cannot work without rechargeable batteries, both hybrid EVs (which have entered into the global market) and full EVs (which will be mass-produced in the near future) show great dependence on rechargeable batteries as well.6,8–10 On the other hand, to alleviate the shortage of resources and reduce environmental pollution, clean and renewable energy, such as wind, solar, and tidal energy, has been widely applied to decrease the consumption of conventional fossil fuels. Therefore, large-scale grid EES systems are urgently needed to store the excess electrical energy of clean energy sources.11–13
Lithium ion battery (LIB) technology has been a real success story since its first commercialization in the early 1990s by Sony. Due to their excellent battery performance and rapid growth, LIBs have been dominant in the market of portable electronics and electric vehicles since then. Meanwhile, the reliance on LIBs will quickly rise with the realization of the mass production of EVs. However, the limited Li resources in nature give rise to concerns about maintaining the stable supply chain of the LIB manufacturing industry.14,15 Meanwhile the realistic cost of raw materials is increasing, for example, the price of lithium has tripled in the past few decades. Therefore, it is hard to meet the increasing market demand for LIB systems, let alone support the expansion of grid EES systems which need a large amount of raw materials. From the view of sustainable development of EES devices, people need to find enough substitutes to address the problems caused by the shortage of lithium sources. Sodium is, no doubt, a promising substitute for lithium due to its analogous chemical properties and large abundance.16,17 Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation power sources because sodium sources are cheaper and of wide geographical distribution. Besides, Al is inactive with sodium, and can act as a current collector at the anode instead of expensive Cu. As a result, SIBs might be more attractive than LIBs for large-scale grid storage, where the cost is more important than the energy/power density of batteries. In addition, the ionic radius of sodium (1.02 Å) is larger than that of lithium (0.59 Å), which might lead to lower desolvation energy in some organic solvents and smaller charge transfer resistance.18 Therefore, it is believed that sodium should exhibit faster electrode kinetics than lithium.19 With that in mind, the use of SIBs has been revisited in recent years.
Recent progress in SIBs is remarkable since tremendous efforts have been devoted to this area.9,20–24 However, the relatively poor electrochemical performance (including power/energy density, rate capability, reversible capacity, cycling stability, etc.) of SIBs limits their commercialization both in mobile and stationary energy storage. Since cathode materials play an important role in the development of SIBs, it is very important to create a summary of these materials and highlight the progress in this field. Among all cathode materials, layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs), polyanionic frameworks, and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely demonstrated as promising candidate materials for SIBs. Especially in recent years, extensive research studies have been carried out on these cathode materials for application in SIBs. Polyanionic compound-based cathodes (such as phosphates, pyrophosphates, fluorophosphates, sulfates, etc.) are famous for their safety and long lifetime due to their stable chemical structure.25–28 However, this type of cathode material is always accompanied by poor electrical conductivity and low specific capacity.25,29,30 PBAs are another type of excellent cathode material owing to their unique open framework, high theoretical capacity and low cost.31,32 However, PBA materials exhibited undesired rate capability and cycling stability to certain degrees when they are used as cathodes for SIBs.33 Compared with the two above-mentioned cathode material systems, the outstanding merits of LTMO cathodes are high capacity and facile synthesis although their cycling stability and air instability remain challenging. LTMOs represent a large family consisting of 3d transition metal elements (from Ti to Cu) or their mixtures, thus providing a large variety of potential options.3,34 Therefore LTMO cathode materials have been largely investigated.
In this review, recent progress regarding three types of LTMO cathode materials (including Ni-based, Mn-based and Ni/Mn co-based LTMOs) for application in SIBs is summarized. Specifically, this review will focus on the latest improvement of overall electrochemical properties including cycling stability, reversible capacity and rate capability, and the related structural evolution mechanism. The routes of structural design and the structure–function–performance relationship of these cathode materials are discussed as well. Finally, the existing problems and further prospects of LTMOs as cathodes for SIBs are presented.
2. Structural strategies of LTMOs
NaxTMO2 (0 < x ≤ 1, TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), or LTMOs, are formed by the stacking of edge-sharing TMO6 layers with the insertion of Na ion layers. This type of material is mainly classified as P2 type and O3 type structures. The letters “P” and “O” stand for the prismatic and octahedral sites being occupied by Na ions while 2 and 3 represent the number of oxygen stacking layers in one unit cell. As shown in Fig. 1a, the oxygen stacking styles of P2 type and O3 type structures are ABBA and ABCABC, respectively.15 Besides, a prime symbol (′) is usually used to denote structures with in-plane distortion of the hexagonal lattice. Generally, the Na number “x” ranges between 0.6 and 0.7 in the P2 type structure while changing between 0.7 and 1 in the O3 type structure. For both P2 and O3 type materials, the extraction of Na+ always leads to material phase transitions, and some are irreversible. As a result, the corresponding chemical performance is affected. For the P2 type structure, due to the gliding of TMO2 sheets, new octahedral sites are generated, and the initial phase transforms into the O2 type phase, where the oxygen stacking forms unique ABAC stacking instead of the original ABBA as shown in Fig. 1a. For the O3 type structure, when some Na+ is extracted from the O3 type structure, prismatic sites are generated after the gliding of TMO2 slabs and the oxygen stacking changes from ABCABC to ABBCCA as shown in Fig. 1a. In some cases, the phase transition of the O3 type structure will be more complicated. For example, O3 type NaFe0.45Co0.5Mg0.05O2 underwent the phase-transition process of O3–P3–P′3–O3′. Therefore, P2 type materials generally undergo simpler phase transition than O3 type materials and P2 type materials exhibit relatively high cycling stability and rate capability. However, O3 type materials usually show high capacity because they include larger amounts of Na ions than P2 type materials per unit.3 To improve the electrochemical properties of LTMOs in SIBs given in Fig. 1b, more thought should be given to how to suppress the irreversible phase transition and the related structural evolution process. A general method to reduce phase transition is to mix different transition metals together (e.g. V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) as well as using cation substitution with Li+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ti4+, etc.

Although all the 3d transition metal oxides have been demonstrated to show some activity in SIBs as the sodium host, most of them are not suitable candidates for practical SIBs. Thus, for comparing the merits and drawbacks of single transition metal-based oxides, six different transition metal-based oxides (NaVO2, NaCrO2, NaMnO2, NaFeO2, NaCoO2, and NaNiO2) are chosen as representatives to discuss their specific capacity and feasibility. The theoretical specific capacities of NaVO2, NaCrO2, NaMnO2, NaFeO2, NaCoO2, and NaNiO2, are 253, 250, 243, 241, 235, and 235 mA h g−1, respectively, where the difference is very small. However, in experiments, their measured capacities (120, 120, 197, 80, 40, and 123 mA h g−1, respectively) are quite different from each other, from which one can easily conclude that the specific capacity of transition metal oxides based on Mn and Ni are higher than that of others.24,52,58,73,92,120 If only feasibility is taken into consideration, the V and Cr oxides would be first excluded due to their toxicity and high cost, and only the other 4 materials would be left with reasonable performance: Mn is cost-effective and NaMnO2 exhibited high specific capacity. Fe-based LTMOs are famous for their low cost and high working voltage while Co-based NaCoO2 shows high ionic diffusion. The most remarkable advantage of Ni-based LTMOs is their high working voltage. Based on these discussions, most research groups believe that Ni and/or Mn-based LTMOs are ideal sodium host materials because these materials exhibit excellent specific capacity and high feasibility.
Although layered NaxMnO2 and NaxNiO2 are two widely accepted cathode materials for SIBs due to the above-mentioned reasons, they still exhibit inevitable drawbacks. On one hand, the NaxMnO2 system likely suffers from rapid capacity decline due to the strong Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+.35–37 Compared with Mn2+ (d5-type electron distribution with half-filled d electron orbitals) and Mn4+ (d3-type electron distribution with half-filled t2g electron orbitals), Mn3+[t32ge1g] is prone to Jahn–Teller distortion due to the d4-type electron distribution without half-filled (or fully filled) electron orbitals. On the other hand, the NaxNiO2 system usually undergoes irreversible complex structural evolution during charge/discharge cycling and large capacity loss during initial cycles.38 To address these problems, the most direct and fundamental method is to integrate these two systems together as Ni/Mn-based LTMOs. Taking typical P2-Nax[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 as an example, the structural advantages (with respect to single transition metal-based systems) could be well understood. According to theoretical simulation of P2-Nax[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2, Ni ions experience +2/+3/+4 transformation while Mn4+ remains the same and is absent from the redox reaction during the charge/discharge process.39,40 According to the density of states (DOS) calculation for P2-Nax[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2, 3d orbitals (t2g and eg orbitals) of Ni ions or Mn ions experience different electron transitions. When x = 2/3 in P2-Nax[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2, t2g orbitals are fully occupied while the energy levels of spin-up states in the eg orbitals are empty, resulting in a t62ge2g electronic configuration. Here the Ni ion exists as Ni2+. When half of the amount of Na+ is extracted (x = 1/3), the electronic configuration becomes t62ge1g because all of the t2g orbitals and one of the spin-down eg orbitals are occupied. Accordingly, the Ni ion becomes trivalent. When Na+ is fully extracted, most of the electrons in the eg energy level are removed, resulting in the formation of Ni4+. Meanwhile, Mn ions remain tetravalent with fully occupied t2g orbitals and completely empty eg orbitals during Na+ extraction. As a result, Jahn–Teller inactive Mn ions maintain the structural integrity while Ni ions provide a wide voltage window during the redox reaction. The Ni/Mn-based LTMOs exhibit high specific capacity and high structural stability. The illustration of the corresponding process is shown in Fig. 1c. Besides the DOS calculation, another calculation through the nudged elastic band (NEB) method indicates that the energy required for Na+ diffusion in P2-Nax[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 is only 170 meV (1/3 < x < 2/3), which is lower than that for the Li+ analogues. In addition to the NEB method, the chemical diffusion coefficient of Na+ was calculated to be as high as 7 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 (1/3 < x < 2/3) by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT).40 Accordingly, both the NEB method and GITT demonstrate the high diffusivity of Na ions in the Ni/Mn-based LTMO system, leading to high rate performance as cathode materials for SIBs. A large number of sodium ion half cells and full cells based on Ni/Mn LTMO cathodes exhibit satisfactory overall battery performance, which is summarized in the following, and some of them are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1.

In summary, the binary system not only inherits the advantages of both NaxMnO2 and NaxNiO2 systems (Mn4+ stabilizes the structure by inhibiting the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+ while Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ takes full advantage of its high working voltage), but also exhibits high Na+ mobility, high specific capacity and high structural stability during cycling. On the basis of the direct combination of Ni and Mn in one system, other effective methods (including cation substitution, nano-sizing, carbonaceous compositing, etc.) are widely investigated to further improve the feasibility and overall energy storage ability. The detailed progress on different Ni- and/or Mn-based LTMOs as cathode materials for SIBs are reviewed in the following.
3. Mn-based LTMOs
3.1 Mn-based single LTMOs
NaxMnO2-type cathode materials have great application potential due to their relative abundance and low cost.41–44 This type of layered material is always distributed at the stoichiometry x > 0.5, among which P2-type NaxMnO2 cathode materials are the most extensively investigated system based on previous reports.45–48 However, the strong Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+ always leads to a sharp decline in capacity after several charge/discharge circles. To enhance the cycling stability, researchers usually regulate the Jahn–Teller effect by designing new structures and/or substituting other inactive cations. As an example of regulating the Jahn–Teller effect, Komaba and co-workers developed a single-phase route for fabricating distorted P2-Na2/3MnO2 with a capacity of 216 mA h g−1, an average voltage window of 3 V and an energy density of 590 W h kg−1 as well as excellent cycle stability in a non-aqueous Na cell.36 Such a cell performance is very promising for practical applications. The improved electrochemical performance was due to the co-operative Jahn–Teller distortion of six-coordinated MnIII (t32g–e1g).
Cation substitution methods involving lithium, magnesium, aluminum, and copper are frequently employed to suppress Jahn–Teller distortion in Mn-based LTMOs by influencing the electron orbitals of Mn. This method is found to stabilize the lattice structure and maintain the electrochemical properties of P2-type NaxMnO2 cathode materials.49–56 Li-substituted P2-Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 delivered a high specific capacity up to 190 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles between 2.0 and 4.6 V versus Na/Na+ as shown in Fig. 3a.49 The addition of lithium improved the structural stability by restraining the phase transition process and reducing the Jahn–Teller distortion.50 Meanwhile, the charge/discharge processes are accompanied by an activation process based on the extraction of Li+. The substitution of Mn with Mg in P2-type NaxMnO2 also leads to smooth electrochemical profiles, enhanced Na-ion conduction, and high reversible capacity.52,57,58 Grey and co-workers compared the structural evolution of the layered framework upon electrochemical cycling of three different NaxMn1−yMgyO2 (y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.10) compositions, and they found that the 5% Mg-doped compound exhibited relatively high rate capability and excellent structural stability as shown in Fig. 3b and c.54 Besides cation substitution, nano-compositing is frequently used to produce Mn-based cathode materials. For example, the Xia group reported P2-type Na0.7MnO2.05 nanotube/carbon nanotube (NMO/CNT) core/branch composites as shown in Fig. 3d and e.59 The addition of CNT cocoon-like branches improved the migration of electrons and stabilized the lattice structure during Na+ insertion/extraction processes. Therefore, the NMO/CNT material showed improved cell performance with a capacity retention of 88% at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles as shown in Fig. 3f. The full cell test with NMO/CNTs as the cathode material also exhibited a large capacity retention of 71% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and superior rate performance with a helical carbon nanofiber anode. This inspired structural design strategy is useful for the development of cathode materials for SIBs.

Mn/Fe-based layered oxide cathodes are also attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, natural abundance and non-toxicity, accompanied by the high working voltage of Fe3+/Fe4+. The partial substitution of Mn with Fe could raise the average working voltage and suppress the Jahn–Teller distortion at the same time.60 The stoichiometry of iron and manganese could influence the phase of the materials.61 In this system, a NaxMnyFe1−yO2 cathode showed the best electrochemical performance at y = 0.5.42 Komaba and co-workers synthesized both P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 and O3-Na[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 materials with enhanced reversible capacity and energy density.44 P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 delivered up to 190 mA h g−1 with an average voltage of 2.75 V versus Na+/Na, which is higher than that of O3-Na[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 as shown in Fig. 3g and h due to the formation of the highly reversible OP4 phase when charged over 4.2 V. The energy density of P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 was estimated to be 520 mW h g−1, which is comparable with that of commercially available LiFePO4 (about 530 mW h g−1versus Li/Li+). In addition, the density of P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 (about 4.1 g cm−3) is higher than that of LiFePO4 (about 3.6 g cm−3). The increased energy density can contribute to the cost reduction indirectly. Based on the above-mentioned advantages, P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 has great potential to be applied in large scale SIBs. Through the use of in situ Raman and XRD measurements, a reversible phase transition of P2–OP4 can be confirmed to only occur between 4.0 V and 4.2 V.62
The Rojo group synthesized both P2-Na2/3Fe2/3Mn1/3O2 and O3-Na2/3Fe2/3Mn1/3O2 materials with excellent electrochemical properties and reported a direct comparison between the electrochemical performance of the two polymorphs with identical Fe–Mn stoichiometry for the first time.41 The reversible capacity of both phases remained at 120 mA h g−1 after 15 cycles, with average voltages of 2.50 V and 2.74 V and corresponding energy densities of 386.05 W h kg−1 and 423.87 W h kg−1 for P2-Na2/3Fe2/3Mn1/3O2 and O3-Na2/3Fe2/3Mn1/3O2 as shown in Fig. 4a and b. These results clearly indicate that both P2 and O3 phase-Na2/3Fe2/3Mn1/3O2 exhibited nearly the same electrochemical performance as cathode materials in SIBs. To further increase the reversible capacity of SIBs, NaN3 as a sacrificial salt was added into the full cell with Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode.63 The reversible capacity increased from 50 mA h g−1 for 0% wt NaN3 to ∼130 mA h g−1 for 20% wt NaN3. However, the reversible capacity decreased when the amount of NaN3 further increased.

Other cation-doped Mn/Fe-based layered oxide cathodes, such as Cu-doped P2-Na7/9Cu2/9Fe1/9Mn2/3O2 and O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 and Ti-doped P2-Na2/3Mn0.8Fe0.1Ti0.1O2 also exhibited improved electrochemical performance.64–66 Gu and co-workers designed air-stable P2-Na7/9Cu2/9Fe1/9Mn2/3O2 with high Na content, which exhibited excellent electrochemical performance both in the half cell and in the full cell (coupled with hard carbon) as shown in Fig. 4c and d.65 Hu et al. prepared an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode material, which displayed excellent cycling stability and rate performance by using a 3.2 V class battery with a hard carbon anode as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The addition of copper may be helpful for the improvement of the air stability of LTMOs based on two aspects: first, Cu ions have the ability to improve the average storage voltage to prevent the oxidation by water/oxygen/CO2; second, Cu may help to form new surface structures and compositions to avoid direct contact with air.66 Recently, a biphasic P2/O3-Na2/3Li0.18(Mn0.8Fe0.2)O2 material was synthesized by a facile solid-state reaction.67 This cathode material delivered initial discharge capacities of 125 mA h g−1 and 105 mA h g−1 at C/10 and 1C rates, respectively, within 1.5–4.2 V versus Na+/Na as shown in Fig. 4g and h. In fact, the O3 phase barely changed its structure during charge/discharge cycles based on the ex situ XRD studies. Therefore, the role of the O3 phase was to stabilize the lattice structure by reducing the gliding of the main phase. A post ball milling treatment can enhance the reversible capacity and energy density of the O3 phase compared to that of the pristine materials (Fig. 4i). For Mn/Fe-based binary LTMOs, the remaining challenges lie in improving cycling stability and reducing Jahn–Teller distortion by proper cation substitution and biphasic structure design.
3.2 Mn/Co-based binary and Mn/Fe/Co-based ternary LTMOs
Cobalt is a common substitution element in LTMOs. For example, a stable P2 phase structure can be obtained by partial substitution of Mn with cobalt in P′2-Na2/3MnO2.68 Yamada et al. synthesized a series of P2-Na2/3MnyCo1−yO2 compounds (y = 0, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, and 1) by a one-step solid-state reaction. The substitution amount of Co in P2-Na2/3MnyCo1−yO2 had a strong influence on the valence states. From the charge–discharge curves at 30 mA g−1, the redox potential of Co4+/Co3+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ shifted systematically by changing the ratio of Co/Mn. They also found that the initial specific capacity increased while the cycling stability declined with the increase of y.69 It is found that a small amount of Co substitution in P2-NaxMnO2 could lead to P2-NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2 with improved specific capacity and cycling stability.70 The addition of cobalt (ca. 10%) can suppress the Jahn–Teller effect, promote the intercalation of Na+ and enhance the conductivity of Na+.71
When the substitution amount of Co was increased to ca. 50%, the corresponding voltage profile became smoother instead of having multiple plateaus accompanied by great electrochemical performance. P2-NaCo0.5Mn0.5O2 delivered 124.3 mA h g−1 in the first discharge at 10C with 97% capacity retention after 30 cycles and 80 mA h g−1 in the first discharge at 5C, with 99% capacity retention after 100 cycles.72 Another homologous material, P2-Na0.67Co0.5Mn0.5O2, exhibited a higher discharge capacity of 147 mA h g−1 within the voltage range of 1.5 V to 4.3 V versus Na+/Na due to the reversible insertion/de-insertion of 0.56 mol Na+ as shown in Fig. 5a.73 This material also showed excellent cycling stability even at a high C rate with 0.026% capacity decline per cycle over 2000 cycles at 30C (Fig. 5b). P2-Na0.67Co0.5Mn0.5O2 exhibited no phase transition during charge/discharge cycling between 1.5 V and 4.3 V according to in situ XRD measurement. It was found that further increasing the stoichiometry of Co substitution such as in P2-Na2/3Co2/3Mn1/3O2 and P2-NaxCo0.7Mn0.3O2 could lead to obvious plateaus in the voltage profile during charge/discharge cycles. Nevertheless, the P2-Na2/3Co2/3Mn1/3O2 exhibited good reversibility for more than 0.5 mol Na+ intercalation between 1.5 V and 4.0 V while the P2-NaxCo0.7Mn0.3O2 had excellent cycle capability with 84% capacity retention after 225 cycles at 1C rate and 75% at 30C (compared to 1C cycling) (Fig. 5c and d).74,75

Cobalt substitution in Mn-based cathode materials can lead to high voltage capacity and rate capability, although this method always leads to multiple plateaus in the voltage profile and declines in the whole capacity. However, most of the Mn–Co based cathode materials are unstable in air. Furthermore, taking into consideration the high cost and toxicity, there is still a long way to go to achieve practical application for this material system.
By substituting Mn with both Fe and Co in NaxMnO2, Jung and co-workers investigated the electrochemical performance of a series of P2-Na0.7[(Fe0.5Mn0.5)1−xCox]O2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) during charge/discharge cycling in Fig. 5e and f.76 The P2-Na0.7Fe0.4Mn0.4Co0.2O2 suffered from about 15% volume expansion during desodiation due to phase transition from P2 to O2 after a plateau at ≈4.1 V and ineluctable TMO2 slab gliding. This large volume change during desodiation/sodiation can lead to gradual capacity loss after continuous cycling. In an attempt to suppress phase transition, Ceder and co-workers prepared a new P2-Na2/3(Mn1/2Fe1/4Co1/4)O2 material, which exhibited a decent rate capability as shown in Fig. 5g and h due to the wide region of the single P2 phase with low Na+ diffusion and short range ordering of Na+ during the desodiation processes. Based on these merits, P2-Na2/3(Mn1/2Fe1/4Co1/4)O2 has been considered as a promising cathode candidate for high-power batteries.77 A P2-Na2/3Mn1/3Fe1/3Co1/3O2 cathode material was also demonstrated to show a stable cycling performance under a 4.1 V cutoff voltage.78
4. Ni-based LTMOs
4.1 Ni-based single LTMOs
Compared with Mn-based cathode materials, significant progress in Ni-based LTMOs has also been made in SIBs during the past few years.79 Rojo and co-workers reported that monoclinic O′3-NaNiO2 suffered from an irreversible capacity decline due to several phase transitions including O′3, P′3, P′′3, O′′3, and O′′′3 during Na+ charge/discharge cycles and strong Jahn–Teller distortion of Ni3+, resulting in an initial capacity loss.38 In this context, Na3Ni2MO6 (M = Sb5+, Bi5+, etc.)-type materials were developed with a honeycomb layered superstructure. Sb-based honeycomb layered O′3-Na3Ni2SbO6 exhibited excellent cycling stability and high-C rate as shown in Fig. 6a and b.80 O′3-Na3Ni2SbO6 exhibited a full theoretical discharge capacity of 130 mA h g−1.81 Recently, Nam et al. reported Bi-based O′3-Na3Ni2BiO6 with a honeycomb-layered structure.82 In the honeycomb structure, each BiO6 octahedron was surrounded by six NiO6 octahedra to take full advantage of Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ redox reactions. Bi5+ can keep the structure integrity in the electrochemical reaction. During charge/discharge cycles, the O′3 phase transformed into the P′3 phase during the first voltage plateau at 3.25 V, then to the O1 phase during the second voltage plateau at 3.5 V according to in situ XRD measurement. Since the above-mentioned fully-reversible phase transitions led to only 1% volume change, the O′3-Na3Ni2BiO6 showed high cycling stability. As a result, a honeycomb layered O′3-Na3Ni2BiO6 cathode delivered 106 mA h g−1 discharge capacity with a slight capacity loss over 50 cycles as shown in Fig. 6c and d. The Ni-based LTMOs with a honeycomb structure are no doubt a new route for developing efficient cathode materials for SIBs. Further work should be focused on improving cell performance accompanied by cost reduction.

Ti substitution is a widely accepted route for improving electrochemical properties, especially for cycling stability of Ni-based LTMO cathode materials. By attempting different stoichiometry ratios, O3-NaNi0.5Ti0.5O2 and Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 were well developed.83–86 Among these, Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 delivered 85 mA h g−1 reversible discharge capacity with 75% capacity retention over 150 cycles as shown in Fig. 6e–g. Finally, the Ni-based LTMO cathode materials exhibited high reversible capacity and cycling stability.
4.2 Ni/Co- and Ni/Fe-based binary LTMOs
The partial substitution of Ni with Fe and/or Co has been widely employed to suppress Jahn–Teller distortion in Ni-based LTMOs. Mixing different transition metals in different ratios always leads to different phase transitions involving different redox processes of cathode materials during cycling. O3-NaFe0.5Ni0.54O2 and NaFe0.3Ni0.7O2 provided reversible capacities of 112 and 135 mA h g−1 with initial coulombic efficiencies of 89% and 93%, respectively.87 Kim et al. compared the electrochemical properties and the structural evolution during the Na+ insertion/extraction process for O3-NaNi0.5Co0.5O2 and NaNi0.5Fe0.5O2.88 O3-NaNi0.5Co0.5O2 delivered higher reversible capacity in a broader voltage window between 2 and 4.2 V than O3-NaNi0.5Fe0.5O2, for which the voltage window was limited to 2–3.9 V. The capacity of O3-NaNi0.5Fe0.5O2 declined over 3.9–4.2 V due to the migration of Fe4+, leading to the irreversible structural change. Based on the in situ XRD results and voltage profile of the discharge process, O3-NaNi0.5Co0.5O2 showed complicated phase transitions including three different O3 and three different P3 phases resulting in several plateaus while O3-NaNi0.5Fe0.5O2 exhibited only O3–P3 phase transition with smooth voltage profiles as shown in Fig. 7a and b.

The Ni/Fe/Co-based ternary cathode material O3-type NaNi1/3Co1/3Fe1/3O2 exhibited high reversible capacity, rate capability and energy density. It delivered a reversible capacity of ∼165 mA h g−1 with an energy density of ∼500 W h kg−1 at C/20.89 Ti-doping in this system can lower the average valence state of Fe, Co or Ni, resulting in the improvement of battery performance and structural stability. For example, a NaFex(Ni0.5Ti0.5)1−xO2 (x = 0.2 and 0.4) cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 12 mA g−1 in a narrow voltage window of 3.75–2.60 V.90 O3-Na[Fe1/3Ni1/3Ti1/3]O2 and NaNi1/4Co1/4Fe1/4Ti1/4O2 were also reported.91,92 O3-Na[Fe1/3Ni1/3Ti1/3]O2 cathode materials exhibited high discharge capacities and good rate capability and cycling performance as well as good safety properties as shown in Fig. 7c and d. The main redox reaction is based on nickel ions instead of iron ions while the titanium ions help to maintain the structural stability.91 NaNi1/4Co1/4Fe1/4Ti1/4O2 also exhibited long cycling life as shown in Fig. 7e.92 The ratio of different transition metal elements in the layered oxide cathode materials should be further optimized to improve electrochemical properties and structural stability of the as-prepared materials.
5. Mn/Ni-based LTMOs
5.1. Mn/Ni-based binary LTMOs
Among numerous LTMOs, Mn/Ni-based binary LTMOs arouse the most interest as cathode materials for SIBs. This system is found to exhibit a wide voltage window based on the Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ redox reactions while the structural stability can be maintained due to the inactive Mn4+. A variety of Mn/Ni-based LTMOs including P2-type, O3-type and P2/O3 type biphasic LTMOs, can be produced using different kinds of substitution elements and blend ratios.
Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is a typical P2 type Mn/Ni-based binary LTMO, delivering a reversible capacity as high as 160 mA h g−1 between 2.0 and 4.5 V operating voltage.39 However, there was a long plateau at 4.2 V resulting in 20% volume change and capacity fading. This phenomenon was mainly due to the irreversible P2–O2 phase transition. Appropriate control of element ratio has been attempted to suppress phase transition and stabilize the lattice structure at a high cutoff voltage. Meng and co-workers developed a Na-excess P2-Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2 cathode material, which delivered a reversible first cycle capacity of 138 mA h g−1 at 0.1C within 2.0–4.5 V and still provided a high reversible capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 5C.93 The cycling stability of P2-Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2 is outstanding over a wide voltage window by reducing the P2–O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. They also evidenced the existence of oxygen vacancies in LTMOs for the first time.
Cation substitution is also widely used to stabilize the structure and improve cycling performance by suppressing the P2–O2 phase transition. Among a series of Mg-substituted P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33−xMgxO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.33), Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.28Mg0.05O2 can deliver up to 123 mA h g−1 with 3.7 V average discharge voltage versus Na+/Na, resulting in a high energy density of 445 W h kg−1 as the cathode material for SIBs (in Fig. 8a and b).94 Based on ex situ XRD results, the P2–O2 phase transition of Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.28Mg0.05O2 was reduced compared to that of the Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 material. The existence of inactive Mg2+ retained more Na+ in the prismatic sites resulting in high structural integrity during the charging process. Therefore, the charge/discharge processes were limited to only a single-phase reaction, resulting in enhanced cycling performance. Na0.67Mn0.8Ni0.1Mg0.1O2 was also prepared with high rate capability and cycling stability during charge/discharge processes due to the improved d-spacing of the Na-ion diffusion layer.57

It was found that Li doping could maintain a high Na content in the interlayer space at all stages of charging and reduce the gliding of the TMO2 layer and water uptake. As a result, the Li-substituted P2-Na0.8Li0.12Ni0.22Mn0.66O2 cathode exhibited a smoother voltage profile and better rate performance than P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 as shown in Fig. 8c and f.95 P2-Na0.8Li0.12Ni0.22Mn0.66O2 exhibited high reversible cycling performance in a wide voltage window because Li-substitution can stabilize the structure by delaying the P2–O2 phase transition to up to as high as 4.4 V.96 Water intercalation was also observed over 3.7 V charge for NaxNi1/3Mn2/3O2, but for NaxLi0.12Ni0.22Mn0.66O2, water uptake occurred at 4.4 V as confirmed by 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).39,40 Cao and co-workers reported Cu-substituted P2-type Na0.67Ni0.1Cu0.2Mn0.7O2 as a high performance cathode material for SIBs.97 The substitution of Cu improved the cycling stability by preventing the P2–O2 phase transition. Different from that of other electrochemically inactive cations, Cu substitution can improve the rechargeable capacity because the Cu2+/Cu3+ redox reaction was electrochemically active during charge/discharge cycles.98
The effects of substituting other cations (Zn, Al, Ti, etc.) in P2 type Ni/Mn-based binary LTMOs were also investigated. For example, Na0.66Ni0.33−xZnxMn0.67O2, Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2, and Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn1/2Ti1/6]O2 exhibited improved battery performance by suppressing phase transition during Na+ insertion/extraction.99–101
Recently, Liu et al. introduced Al2O3-coated Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 as a cathode material with a thickness < 12 nm.102 The surface Al2O3 layers could suppress unfavorable side reactions at high voltages, resulting in improved cycling stability and rate performance compared with the non-coated Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 material as displayed in Fig. 8d and g. It was also reported that the coated Al2O3 nanolayers on the surface of Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 enhanced the kinetics of Na+ diffusion by promoting the decomposition of the salt in electrolyte and delayed the degradation of the active materials.103 Similarly, Myung and co-workers coated a conductive NaPO3 nanolayer (about 10 nm) on the surface of P2-Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 to avoid the exposure of the cathode material to HF and H2O in the electrolyte.104 As a result, the full cell based on NaPO3-coated Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2/hard carbon showed improved cycling stability with 73% capacity retention after 300 cycles compared to the non-coated sample (Fig. 8e and h). The surface NaPO3 nanolayers also suppressed the formation of byproducts on the surface of the cathodes, thus decreasing the cell resistance.
Apart from P2-type, O3-Na[Ni1/2Mn1/2]O2 has also been studied. O3-Na[Ni1/2Mn1/2]O2, consisting of Ni2+ and Mn4+, delivered a reversible capacity of 125 mA h g−1 when cycled at a current density of 4.8 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 2.2–3.8 V, accompanied by complex phase transition of O3hex.–O′3mon.–P3hex.–P′3mon.–P3′′hex during charge/discharge cycling.105–107 Only 5% of the initial capacity can be retained after 50 cycles, resulting in poor rate performance in the high voltage region. To address this problem, partial substitution of Mn4+ with Ti4+ can enhance the interslab distance and suppress irreversible structural transformation. The Guo group synthesized a series of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5−xTixO2 materials, among which NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 delivered a capacity of 135 mA h g−1 with 85% capacity retention at 1C after 200 cycles based on the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple (Fig. 9a).108 Partial Ti substitution suppressed irreversible multiple phase transition in the high voltage region during the Na+ insertion/extraction process (Fig. 9b).

Li substitution in O3-type materials could improve battery performance but led to Li+ loss due to the migration of Li+ into Na+ layers during Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. Cu/Ti co-based NaNi0.45Cu0.05Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 was reported with improved electrochemical performance and air stability as shown in Fig. 9c and d.109 Recently, O3-type Na[Li0.05Mn0.50Ni0.30Cu0.10Mg0.05]O2 was synthesized via an industrially feasible coprecipitation method, followed by thermal treatment.110 Based on the unique nano-crystal aggregated microsphere architecture, the as-prepared O3-Na[Li0.05Mn0.50Ni0.30Cu0.10Mg0.05]O2 delivered a high reversible capacity of 172 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and excellent capacity retention of 70.4% after 1000 cycles at 20C. A high energy density up to 215 W h kg−1 demonstrated its high possibility to be employed in practical SIBs for large scale electrical energy storage. P2/O3 Na0.7Li0.3Ni0.5Mn0.5O2+d delivered a capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at 15 mA g−1 between 2.0 and 4.05 V and retained 95% of the initial capacity over 20 cycles, but suffered from multiple phase transitions as shown in Fig. 9e and f.111
5.2 Ni/Mn/Co-based ternary LTMOs
In Liu's research, it was found that Co3+ substitution can enhance electronic conductivity during charge/discharge cycling, and lead to a higher rate capability.112 P2-NaxNi0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2 exhibited a low initial capacity of 117 mA h g−1 with an average discharge voltage of 3.3 V versus Na+/Na, but good rate capability for 200 cycles.113 Other congeneric materials (e.g. P2-Na2/3Co2/3Mn2/9Ni1/9O2, Na0.67[Ni0.4Co0.2Mn0.4]O2, NaxMn2/3Co1/6Ni1/6O2, and P2-NaxMn0.60Ni0.30Co0.10O2 (ref. 114–117)) with different element ratios were also reported. This type of P2-type material suffered from rapid capacity decay in high voltage regions due to P2–O2 phase transition. Therefore, reversible cycles were limited under 4.0 V. Apart from P2-type materials, O3-type Na[NixCoyMnz]O2 (x = 1/3, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8) were also tested as cathodes for SIB applications. Among these materials, NaNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibited improved reversible capacity and high rate capability.118,119 Based on the first-principles calculation, the average valence states of nickel, cobalt, and manganese elements were +2, +3, and +4, respectively. Therefore, the full use of Ni2+/Ni3+, Ni3+/Ni4+, and Co3+/Co4+ redox couples can provide high specific capacity while the inactive Mn4+ is beneficial for the structural stability.120
By introducing electrochemically inactive Al ions into this system, capacity retention increased. The as-prepared P2-Na0.67[Mn0.65Ni0.15Co0.15Al0.05]O2 microflakes as cathodes delivered a reversible capacity of 123 mA h g−1 and retained 95.4% capacity over 50 cycles.121,122 In addition to cation substitution, synthesis of composite materials was also performed to optimize the battery performance of these LTMOs. Al2O3-coated P2-Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 showed excellent cycling stability, especially in high voltage regions delivering a reversible capacity of 121 mA h g−1 within 2–4.5 V at 1C.123 Likewise, Na2/3[Mn0.55Ni0.30Co0.15]O2 composited with multi-walled carbon nanotube cathode materials exhibited high electrochemical performance and rate capability because carbon nanotubes provided more paths for Na+ transportation.124
5.3 Ni/Mn/Fe-based ternary LTMOs
As the cathode material for SIBs, O3-NaNi1/2Mn1/2O2 exhibited stable cycling performance when the voltage was below 4.0 V.106 Fe-substitution in O3-NaNi1/2Mn1/2O2 helps to enhance the structural stability by forming a stable OP2 phase in the high voltage region (over 4.0 V). Johnson and co-workers reported O3-type layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 as a promising positive electrode candidate with an appreciable capacity of 130 mA h g−1 (0.1C) while a full cell based on a NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode with a hard carbon anode exhibited 100 mA h g−1 reversible capacity at 0.5C between 2.0 and 4.0 V for 150 cycles with a smooth voltage profile.125 Yuan et al. reported a series of NaFex(Ni0.5Mn0.5)1−xO2 cathode materials, among which NaFe0.2Ni0.4Mn0.4O2 showed optimal electrochemical performance and stable cyclability due to the unique OP2 phase with a smaller interslab distance, which prevented the insertion of solvent molecules and electrolyte anions.126 Therefore, stable cycling of cathode materials can be obtained in high voltage regions.
Based on research about a series of O3-type Na[Ni0.75−xFexMn0.25]O2 (x = 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, and 0.55) materials, increasing the Fe content on a proper scale can lead to improved cycling stability and rate capability due to the reversible redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples. As a result, Na[Ni0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25]O2 showed improved electrical conductivity compared with other analogues.127 Similarly, the electrochemically inactive Mn4+ helped to maintain the lattice structure during Na+ (de)intercalation.128,129 Oh and co-workers developed a SIB full cell with a carbon-coated Fe3O4 anode, a Na[Ni0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25]O2 cathode, and NaClO4 in fluoroethylene carbonate and ethyl methanesulfonate as the electrolyte, which exhibited improved cycling stability (Fig. 10a and b).128 For optimized battery performance of the O3-Na[Ni0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25]O2 cathode material, Li-substituted Na[Li0.05(Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5)0.95]O2 should deliver a capacity of up to 180.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1C rate and retain 89.6% capacity at 0.2C (92.1% 0.5C) over 40 cycles. The addition of lithium can reduce Fe3+ migration from the transition metal layer to the Na layer during charge/discharge cycling.130 O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 was also developed as a promising air-stable cathode for SIBs with a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g−1, when the cut-off voltage was limited below 4.0 V.131 NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 went through a continuous phase transition process during charge/discharge cycling as shown in the 2D Fe/Ni X-ray absorption near edge structure maps in Fig. 10c.

Partial Ca-substitution for Na+ benefited from Na+ diffusion and improved the cycling stability of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 material by enlarging the distance between Na+ layers. The Liao group investigated Ca-substituted O3-Na1−xCax/2Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1), which exhibited improved cycling stability due to the enlarged alkali layer distance. The O3-Na0.9Ca0.05Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 delivered an optimized reversible capacity of 116.3 mA h g−1 at 1C and a capacity retention of 92% after 200 cycles as shown in Fig. 10d and e, while it went through highly reversible O3–P3–P3–O3 phase transition during the Na+ insertion/extraction process.132
O3-Na(Mn0.25Fe0.25Co0.25Ni0.25)O2 was synthesized with excellent electrochemical performance including an initial discharge capacity of 180 mA h g−1 between 1.9 V and 4.3 V at C/10 and 578 W h kg−1 specific energy density.133 The Ti-substituted compound O3-NaNi1/4Co1/4Fe1/4Mn1/8Ti1/8O2 exhibited improved cycling stability with 91% capacity retention at 4C after 300 cycles and improved rate performance due to the full utilization of Ni2+/Ni3+, Fe3+/Fe4+, and Co3+/Co4+ redox couples during charge/discharge cycles.134
As a promising cathode material candidate for SIBs, Ni/Mn-based LTMOs exhibit high specific capacity and rate capability. However, this type of material always suffers from irreversible phase transition, leading to structural evolution, volume change, and capacity fading during charge/discharge cycling. Cation substitution is widely applied to improve electrochemical performance and air stability without capacity sacrifice by suppressing the phase transition process. Attention should also be paid to reducing the cost due to cation substitution. Other methods including surface coating and compounding are also applied to improve the battery performance.
6. Prospects
In the last 5 years, great achievements and progress have been made in LTMO cathode materials for application in SIBs. However, from academic investigation to practical application, there remains a long way to go. Lots of work still needs to be done to explore the big family of LTMOs. Considerations should be focused on improving the overall electrochemical performance, increasing air stability, reducing cost, and enhancing environmental friendliness.
Considering the structural differences between P2-type and O3-type materials, it is better to investigate them separately. As cathode materials, P2-type LTMOs exhibit good cycling stability and high ionic conductivity due to their structural merits. During Na+ insertion and extraction, P2-type LTMOs usually experience P2–O2 single phase transition, which can be suppressed or transformed into a highly reversible P2–OP4 process by effective structural design methods. As a result, the P2 layered structure is highly maintained, leading to good cycling stability. The P2-type layered structure also provides an open path for the diffusion of Na+ resulting in a low energy barrier of Na+ migration and high ionic conductivity. However, the P2 type structure always suffers from initial irreversible capacity and undesirable specific capacity due to its sodium deficiency. Compared to P2-type LTMOs, O3-type cathodes possess the advantages of high energy density, high specific capacity due to their wide operating voltage window and them matching well with anode materials in full SIBs based on their high initial coulombic efficiency. In O3-type LTMOs, Na+ ions need to overcome the large energy barrier when migrating from one octahedral site to another through an edge-sharing tetrahedral site between them. Accordingly, O3-type LTMOs exhibit low ionic conductivity.
Besides overall electrochemical performance, air stability is another unavoidable factor which influences the development of LTMOs. Because of the large distance between sodium layers, this type of material usually takes in H2O/CO2 from the air, followed by undesired chemical reactions. As a result, the electrochemical performance of the cathode decreases due to the formation of inactive NaOH/Na2CO3. From the view of cost control and environmental friendliness, using raw materials containing cost effective and non-toxic elements such as Fe and Mn, instead of expensive and poisonous element like Co, is more important for the sustainable development of LTMOs. Improving the energy density of this type of cathode material is another effective method to reduce costs.
The overall electrochemical performance, no doubt, is an important property of SIBs, while production cost is an essential factor as well. Balancing the relationship between them is both the remaining challenge and a key link to the commercialization of SIBs. Most of the recent research in this area, however, only focuses on performance improvement instead of cost reduction. In Ni/Mn co-based LTMO materials, the most direct method for reducing costs is to increase the relative ratio of Mn as well as cut down the use of expensive materials like Co, Ni, and Ti on the premise of maintaining performance in cation substitution design routes. Accordingly, natural carbonaceous materials need to be developed to composite with LTMOs instead of expensive graphene or carbon nanotube materials. By doing this, the cost of SIBs would be sharply reduced, in addition to the contribution to the environment. Besides, another effective method for reducing costs is process-simplification. Once the fabrication of the material and the packaging of cells are simple enough, the cost of the product line and time would be sharply reduced.
In the future, efforts should be made in both innovating structural design approaches and investigating structural evolution mechanisms during cycling to meet these requirements. For structural design, besides the most popular and effective cation substitution, other methods such as micro/nano-compositing with other systems and coating the surface with protective layers, should be strongly attempted to reduce the irreversible structural changes and improve the electrochemical performance during charge/discharge cycling. For P2-type LTMOs, attention should be paid to improve initial coulombic efficiency while for O3-type LTMOs, it is more important to control the complex phase transition process and enhance cycling stability by reasonable structural design methods. For example, a new type of K0.7Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 has been developed as a cathode material for SIBs.135 Zhou and co-workers developed stable P3-type stacking to deliver excellent cycling performance due to the cation-mixing nature.136 Structural design approaches should also be developed focusing on reducing the interlayer distance to suppress the reaction between LTMOs and ambient air. For the reaction mechanism, intensive studies of the relationship between battery performance and structural evolution should be made to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs fundamentally. Advanced in situ measurement techniques such as in situ TEM should be applied to further explore the real reaction mechanism and the evolution of crystal structures during charge/discharge cycling to solve existing issues like irreversible capacity loss during initial cycles. At present, the battery properties of cathode materials by half-cell testing in most of the recent studies are quite different from those of the practical full cells. Therefore, attention should be paid to strengthen the test combination between cathode materials and other parts of SIBs including anode materials, electrolyte additives, binders, etc.
7. Conclusion
SIBs have extensive application potential in both mobile and stationary EES systems due to their elemental abundance, cost effectiveness and having the same working mechanism as LIBs. LTMOs are promising cathode materials for SIBs owing to their high battery performance. But the large ionic radius of Na+ always leads to the complex structural transformation of cathode materials during the Na+ insertion/extraction process, resulting in capacity fading, stability decrease, volume change, etc. To maintain excellent battery performance and increase cycle life, cation substitution has been used to enhance the structural stability of LTMOs by suppressing phase transitions during Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. At present, Ni/Mn-based materials show improved cell performance compared to other types of materials because the full use of Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ redox reactions can provide relatively high working voltage and high specific capacity, and inactive Mn4+ maintains the crystal structure resulting in retention of reversible capacity and long cycling life. Among the reported LTMOs for SIBs, O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 and O3-NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibited the most improved electrochemical performance including large reversible specific capacity, cycling stability, high rate performance, and air-stable properties as well as large-scale production perspectives including cost effective and green raw materials and facile synthesis methods. Although SIBs have the advantages of low-cost and long lifetime, unsatisfactory cell performance still hinders the practical commercialization of this EES system. The rapid growth in recent years indicates the bright future of LTMOs as cathode materials for SIBs.
