Herein, an atomic layer deposition system and different sizes of polystyrene colloidal spheres were employed to in situ prepare an opal-like titanium oxide (TiO2) mesoporous electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells. Initially, a TiO2 layer was deposited on the spheres through an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system, and then the substrates were annealed to obtain hollow opal-like TiO2 structures. The as-prepared perovskite solar cells with the controlled opal-like TiO2 electron transport layer show an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.5 ± 0.55, and the same ALD-prepared planar solar cells show an average PCE of 14.9 ± 0.53. This work reveals that the opal-like nanostructure offers an efficient approach to high-performance perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials exhibit an excellent performance in photoelectric conversion. It has taken about a decade to increase the efficiency of perovskite solar cells from 3.8% to more than 25%.1–6 Most perovskite solar cells possess five functional layers, namely, conductive glass (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or iodine-doped tin oxide (ITO)), an electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite layer, a hole transport layer (HTL), and a metal electrode (Au/Ag).7–11 A functional ETL is generally extremely effective in charge transmission and separation.12,13 Titanium dioxide (TiO2), by virtue of its suitable bandgap, high charge mobility, full transmission, and good stability,14–17 is one of the most widely-applied electron transport materials for use in an ETL. Recently, we reported TiO2 bilayer perovskite solar cells produced by a wet chemical method, in which the newly-prepared ETLs, with different bandgap positions, could construct two charge transfer models, and the efficiencies of the devices increased from nearly 10% in a single layer to 16.5% and 15.2% in bilayers.18,19 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be a useful tool in the preparation of a high quality TiO2 layer.20–22 This layer-by-layer growth method effectively uses a sacrificial template method to prepare films with various morphologies.23,24 Li et al. reported the ALD growth of a TiO2 thin film on a polystyrene-b-poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (PS-6-P2VP) system for use as an ETL.25 After annealing and burning off amphiphilic block copolymers, the morphology of the TiO2 film did not change significantly, while the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells improved by a large margin.
Researchers have conducted a great deal of work on photonic crystals in solar cells.26–28 Yang et al. reported a method by which a TiO2 inverse opal film was obtained by annealing a mixture of polystyrene (PS) nanospheres and Ti precursor solution. The as-prepared film had good optical and electrical properties, and the performance of the perovskite solar cell device increased from 11% for a planar sample to 13% for an inverse opal sample.29 Boo et al. used different poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamps on TiO2 paste to prepare photonic crystal like TiO2 structures and used them as ETLs to prepare a perovskite solar cell.30 The efficiency of devices increased from 10.5% for planar prepared samples to 15.2% for 1600 nm prepared samples. Electron transport layers with photonic crystal-like effects can effectively improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, but their preparation is relatively complex. It is therefore necessary to develop efficient and simple preparation methods for photonic-like crystals.
Here, we prepared in situ opal-like TiO2 photonic crystal ETLs using ALD technology and PS spheres. Using different sizes of PS spheres to prepare TiO2 crystal-like ETLs, the thickness of the TiO2 layer could be controlled from a single layer to three layers by adjusting the speed of the spin-coating process. The best efficiency achieved for an as-prepared cell (FTO/opal-like TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag) was 18.2%, which was a 120% increase when compared with the 15.3% efficiency achieved for planar TiO2 using the same ALD technology. The mechanism required to achieve an excellent performance has been studied by investigating the cell parameters, and our work provides a new, promising, and easy way to produce a crystal-like layer to increase the performance of solar cells.
Experimental section
Preparation of the opal-like TiO2 layer
PS spheres were purchased from Alfa Aesar (polystyrene latex microspheres, 0.20 micron/0.50 micron/1.0 micron, 2.5 wt% dispersion in water) and the solution was diluted with water at a ratio of 1:6. FTO glasses were washed with acetone, ethyl alcohol and deionized water in turn in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The as-prepared solution was coated on FTO glass with different spin speeds from 800–2000 rpm to form single layer to three layer PS spheres. Then the substrates were transferred into an ALD system. Deionized water and tetra(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) were used as Ti and oxygen precursors, and high-purity Ar was used as the TDMAT carrier and the purging gas. The thickness of the deposited TiO2 layer can be controlled by adjusting the cycle numbers of ALD. The growth rate of the TiO2 layer during the ALD process was 0.05 nm per cycle. After the deposition, the ALD coated films were calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h to remove PS spheres so as to get a pure TiO2 layer. After that, we deposited a 3 nm ALD TiO2 layer to make up for holes that may be created during annealing.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The perovskite layer was prepared as we reported before with the spin-coating of CH3NH3I (0.05 g/1 ml isopropanol)and PbI2 (0.461 g/1 ml N,N-dimethylformamide) which were stirred at 60 °C for 12 hours, and then the above precursor solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter.31 CH3NH3I and PbI2 (Alfa, ultra dry, 99.999%) were used as received. The perovskite layer was prepared by spin-coating the CH3NH3I precursor solution on PbI2 spin-coated FTO. The CH3NH3I solution could be coated onto substrate after 10 seconds of operation. The spiro-MeOTAD layer was spin-coated on the top of the perovskite layer (72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene solution) at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask (0.15 cm2 active area). All processes were performed under controlled inert gas conditions with a humidity of <0.1 ppm.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi, SU8010). The phase of the products was checked using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-III-B-40KV, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were measured using a Newport solar simulator under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The transmission and absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 and the photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) spectra were recorded by using a Shimadzu RF-6000. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302N) under light at 0 V with the alternative signal amplitude of 5 mV and frequency ranging from 4.0 × 105 Hz to 1 Hz.
Results and discussion
Given that the most commonly reported thickness of the perovskite layer is less than 1 μm for high performance perovskite solar cells, we selected 200 nm PS spheres as the most suitable sphere size to form the different layers.32–34 By controlling the spin-coating speed, we obtained one-, two-, and three-layer PS spheres at 1800, 1200, and 800 rpm respectively, demonstrating that a higher speed led to a thinner layer. To grow an in situ TiO2 layer, with a spherical morphology, a suitable thickness of the ALD TiO2 layer should be considered. If it is too thin (∼ 5 nm), the morphology of the spheres will be destroyed during the annealing process (Fig. S1†), while an overly thick TiO2 layer will cover the spheres and the spherical morphology will be lost. In combination with our previous research on ALD TiO2 layers, we controlled the growth of TiO2 thin films, with a thickness of 15 nm, to form a stable TiO2 mesoporous structure. Fig. 1 shows the morphology of TiO2 opal-like mesoporous structures with different layers and the transmission measurement of the substrates. Fig. 1a clearly shows the morphology of FTO glass and it can be seen that the TiO2 structure had a spherical morphology with only one layer of PS spheres. Because it is difficult to prepare single-layer spheres by spin-coating, there were still spaces between the ordered spheres. However, due to the characteristics of ALD technology, these empty areas were also covered with a layer of the ALD TiO2 film, and therefore there would be no large current leakage in these areas when they operate as an ETL. The current leakage of different samples was tested and is discussed in the following section. Fig. 1b shows an image of the two-layer TiO2 nanostructure. It can be clearly seen that there was a layer of TiO2 spheres on the top of the FTO layer. Fig. 1c shows an image of the three-layer TiO2, on which the FTO layer can hardly be seen. Fig. S2† shows the three-layer TiO2, including the intentionally crushed spheres. It can be seen that the interior of the spheres was hollow, and there were holes in the joints between the spheres, which were helpful for the later inflow of perovskite solution. Fig. 1d shows the absorption spectra of different TiO2 nanostructures and planar TiO2, which was prepared by the same ALD technology and was used here as the reference sample. It can be seen that the magnitude of all curves was quite low, which showed that TiO2 ETLs had a good light transfer ability. The curves of all the different layers of TiO2 had an increased light absorption in the range of 400–700 nm, which showed that these opal-like nanostructures had an effective light trapping ability. Transmission measurements were also conducted, with the same trend identified and shown in Fig. S3.† Different sized spheres (100 and 500 nm) were also considered for use to form TiO2 opal-like nanostructures as shown in Fig. S4.† It was apparent that the 100 nm PS spheres were more likely to aggregate rather than disperse into films, and the 500 nm PS spheres could disperse well but it then became difficult to deposit the subsequent perovskite layer (Fig. S5†). Low magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of different samples are presented in Fig. S6,† and the samples have almost the same morphology as that shown by the high-magnification SEM images in Fig. 1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown in Fig. S7,† with the peak at 25.3° assigned to the (101) peak of anatase type TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272).

Fig. 2a shows the morphology of two-layer TiO2 nanostructures after being covered with the perovskite. The TiO2 spheres are barely visible and the perovskite has formed a continuous layer. The morphology of a single layer TiO2 opal-like nanostructure was similar to that of a two-layer sample and is shown in Fig. S8.†Fig. 2b shows the morphology of three-layer TiO2 nanostructures, from which it can be clearly seen that the TiO2 spheres were on top of the perovskite layer. We considered that this direct contact of TiO2 with the HTL would decrease the performance of the solar cell. Fig. 2c shows the SEM image of a cross-section of a two-layer TiO2 opal-like nanostructure. From this figure, it can be seen that the spheres were completely filled with the perovskite material. The TiO2 opal-like nanostructure served as a good support material, which could effectively transport carriers and increase the stability of the perovskite. The absorption spectra of different TiO2 ETL samples after coverage with the perovskite are shown in Fig. 2d. It can be seen that all curves had the same absorption edge, which corresponded very well with the band gap of the perovskite. Compared with a planar TiO2 sample, opal-like TiO2 samples had a strong absorption in the range of 400 to 600 nm, and could therefore be considered as effective TiO2 nanostructures. Samples with 500 nm spheres were also covered with a perovskite layer (Fig. S5†), but it was apparent that the perovskite could barely form a compact film due to the spheres being too large to cover. We therefore concluded that 200 nm spheres were more suitable, and the opal-like TiO2 nanostructures effectively increased the light usage of the perovskite layer.

The current density–voltage curves of a perovskite solar cell with different thicknesses of opal-like TiO2 ETLs and planar TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3c, in which all devices were tested with a reverse scan (from 1.2 to 0 V, scan rate of 0.1 V s−1). The photovoltaic parameters, including short circuit-current density (Jsc), open-voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized as the average of 20 devices in Fig. 3a, b and Table S1.† It can be seen that the Jsc grew as the thickness of the layer of TiO2 spheres increased, which was the same trend as that of the absorbance curves. Initially, the Voc increased with the increased thickness of TiO2 spheres, but it decreased in the three-layer TiO2 sample. The origin of Voc in perovskite solar cells is typically described by the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO of the HTM, or by the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electron.35 For planar perovskite solar cells, carriers can only be separated at the interface between TiO2 and perovskite. However, for the opal-like perovskite solar cells, the carriers can not only be separated at the bottom interface, but also be separated and transported by opal-like TiO2 in the perovskite layer. Due to these two different transport structures, carriers in planar perovskites are more difficult to transport than those in opal-like one, so the Voc of planar perovskite cells is lower than that of opal-like perovskite cells with better transmission capacity. From the SEM images (Fig. 2b), it can be seen that the perovskite layer of the three-layer device did not completely cover the TiO2 ETL. The direct contact between the ETL and HTL will destroy the carrier transport in the solar cell, so the Voc of the three-layer solar cell will be much lower than that of other devices. The two-layer opal-like TiO2 ETL sample had the highest FF, which indicated that it had the best nanostructure for charge transfer and would be beneficial for perovskite film formation. The PCE curve showed that the two-layer TiO2 sample had the highest efficiency, which was consistent with our earlier discussion. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was used here to provide more optical information for the two-layer TiO2 and simple ALD TiO2 samples. From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that the opal-like TiO2 device had a higher value in the range from 350 to 550 nm than that of the simple ALD TiO2 device, which confirmed that this opal-like nanostructure definitely increased the light usage of a perovskite solar cell. The Jsc values of opal-like and planar samples were not very different. We speculated that this small current difference may be due to the fact that the perovskite layer had a very strong absorption capacity over the whole visible spectrum. From the IPCE, it can be seen that the response of planar and multilayer structures to monochromatic light was similar in the 500 to 800 nm range, and therefore the current benefit brought about by the photonic crystals was not obvious. We believe that the benefit of this structure lies in the combination of the partial light enhancement and electron transmission process. The integrated Jsc (Fig. S9†) was used here to check the tested Jsc, with values of 20.82 and 21.33 mA cm−2, which were similar to the values of the J–V measurement. Fig. S10† shows the repeatability of 26 devices for ALD and two-layer samples.

To further explore the internal properties of nanostructures, an electrochemical analysis was conducted. Fig. 4a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results of different devices, showing two semicircles at high frequencies and one transmission line at low frequencies. These two semicircles represent the transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of ETL/FTO glass, ETL/perovskite, or perovskite/HTL while the transmission line represents the recombination impedance (Rrec) of solar cells. The model equivalent circuit was used to fit the curves and the Rct and Rrec values are summarized in Table S2.†36 The Rct value could be obtained by adding the Rct1 of the first semicircle to the Rct2 of the second semicircle. The value of the two-layer device was lower than that of other devices, which could be considered a function of the large surface between perovskite and TiO2, which accelerated the separation and transport of carriers. The three-layer device had a higher value that could be attributed to the thick TiO2 layer, which confirmed the poor contact of the ETL and HTL. An increase in the contact between the ETL and HTL led to an increase in carrier recombination in the transport process. The thicker the opal-like TiO2 layer, the larger the recombination value. The opal-like TiO2 nanostructures were grown in situ on PS spheres by ALD, and then annealed to remove the spheres. Although we were able to grow a 3 nm ALD TiO2 layer, pin-holes could still be produced during the gasification process. Therefore, we conducted a leakage current test under dark conditions. We determined the leakage performance of the solar cells from the current at the same voltage value, where a lower dark current value indicated a better leakage performance. Fig. 4b shows the leakage current curves, indicating that there was almost the same value for all one-layer devices. Two-layer devices had the lowest value, which indicated that they had the lowest leakage current. The results obtained with different scanning directions are shown in Fig. S11.† Long-term measurements of two-layer samples were also conducted and the results are shown in Fig. S12.† The samples were stored in a drying oven with the humidity lower than 18% and a temperature of 20 °C. The devices were more than 90% efficient after being stored for two weeks.

Conclusion
In summary, we used PS spheres and ALD technology for the in situ growth of an opal-like mesoscopic TiO2 structure on FTO glass that was capable of trapping light and had a high surface area. A mesoscopic cell (FTO/opal-like TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag) with a high PCE of 18.2% was fabricated. The effects of the size of PS spheres, ALD thickness, and the layering of spheres on optical and electrochemical properties were investigated systematically. The optimum performance of the two-layer 200 nm PS sphere-based device was attributed to high absorption, a small leakage current, and reduced transport resistance. The performance of opal-like TiO2 structure-based devices may be further improved by using formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) as the perovskite material.
