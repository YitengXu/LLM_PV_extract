    , Accepted 23rd September 2021First published on 23rd September 2021AbstractWith the increasing demand for sustainable energy, hydrogen as a recyclable and green energy resource has drawn a lot of attention. Optical spintronics, combining the spin and charge of photoelectrons, distinguishes itself as the most powerful and promising technology for hydrogen production through implementing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in spintronic transport. A spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen evolution device, utilizing a coating of silver nanoparticles (NPs) onto TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanorods (NRs), demonstrates energy transfer due to the generation of spintronic surface plasmon resonance under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation. The spin injection emerges in semiconductors through optical and electrical paths to modulate the process of spintronic transport across the interface. The evolution efficiency of the SPEC hydrogen and its corresponding maximum production of hydrogen successfully rise to as high as 174.46% and 1.70 × 10−3 L s−1 m−2, respectively, by exploiting spintronic SPR energy transfer. However, the spintronics can impede the SPR hot electron transfer and display a quantum entanglement of the two qubits during spin–plasmon–electron interactions when attempting to increase the evolution efficiency of the SPEC hydrogen. Herein, we report the design of an unprecedented approach to realize the utilization of strong spin–plasmon–electron interactions and we have applied these techniques to yield a state-of-the-art device to bring spintronics into reality.
1. Introduction
Electronics technology is mostly studied based on the charge properties of electrons rather than the spin properties of electrons. Spintronics exhibits substantial advantages of low-power, high speed, and spin degrees-of-freedom of electrons due to the limits of the conventional electrical charge-based semiconductor.1 Spintronics reconciles with conventional semiconductors and thus, many conventional techniques utilized in electrical charge-based semiconductors can be directly transferred to spintronics. The advantages of non-local spin injection lie in the utilization of common metal materials as the desired electrodes, such as Cu, Ag, or Al, due to their low resistance and outstanding properties of spin transport.2 The spin photocurrent could be rapidly transferred through the ferromagnet/semiconductor interface within several hundred picoseconds as compared to normal electric current.3,4 The spin electrons can, moreover, transport the Schottky barrier between the metal/n type-semiconductor by the tunneling process when the spin electrons reach the interface.5 Spintronic transport employs the spin of electrons together with the charge of electrons to achieve new properties for the development of innovative devices, whereas, conventional electronic transport utilizes only the charge of electrons.6 Spintronics can furthermore cause quantum materials to display an interesting particle interaction phenomenon of Rashba states.7–9 Rashba states occur as a result of interactions between spins, and the momentum directions of the carriers exhibit two symmetric contours at the Fermi surface without an electric field. Rashba coupling in spin quantum mechanical phenomenon can be thereby simplified through the application of the Ising model. The spin interactions through the couplings can be consequently described by the Hamiltonian of the Ising model.10 However, most magnetic semiconductors require an unfavorably low temperature to achieve magnetic ordering, and the difficulty of the synthesis hinders practical applications. Therefore, it is crucial to design a spintronics system that can facilitate its experimental manipulation at room temperature.
The crucial step leading to the successful production of solar fuel through photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) is to design photoelectrodes of high performance.11 Plasmonic solar water splitting is regarded as a promising method for realizing a persistent and sustainable supply of green energy.12 To date, several mechanisms have been proposed for the enhancement of the plasmonic solar water splitting, including hot electron injection, near-field enhancement, scattering mechanisms, and resonance energy transfer.13,14 Nevertheless, the integration of plasmonic NPs (mostly Au and Ag) with semiconductors is considered as an effective strategy to exploit the plasmonic effect, which hampers the application and explanation of plasmonic transfer mechanism in semiconductors.15 However, plasmonics from metal nanostructures is a potential paradigm for solar energy conversion; the efficiency of the direct injection of “hot electrons” into solar cells is poor due to the loss of hot electrons by ultrafast electron–electron scattering. Fano resonance induced by strong plasmon–exciton coupling provides an efficient channel for coherent resonance energy transfer from metallic plasmons to chlorophyll-a molecular excitons, which has a much higher injection efficiency in exciton-SSCs than “hot electrons”.16 The efficiency is determined by the spectral overlap between the absorption band edge of a semiconductor and the absorbance of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).11,17 Ternary polymer solar cells (TSCs) have a simple device configuration and utilize multiple polymers of low-cost. The emission of the third component overlaps the absorption of the donor or acceptor in order to get efficient resonance energy transfer, leading to an increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) by a more efficient charge generation and an extended absorption.18
The generated spin hot electrons of silver NPs when illuminated by circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation cannot transfer to the conduction band of the Fe:ZnO or Co:ZnO NRs as shown in Fig. 1(a). Herein we report a spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen evolution device prepared through TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation as shown in Fig. 1(b). We set out to design a spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen evolution device to simultaneously couple the measurement of reaction activity and selectivity in spintronics. This was therefore realized by the utilization of the photoelectrochemical water-splitting reaction, which was integrated with the resonance energy transfer from the silver NPs through optical spin injection and through the collection from the conduction band of the Fe:ZnO or Co:ZnO NRs. In addition, it is influenced by the strong distribution of resonant EM energy density in the local EM field between silver NPs and Fe:ZnO or Co:ZnO NRs by the coupling effect. In another aspect, the spin–orbital coupling contributes to the property control of spin transport. The strong resonance of the EM field can increase the photogeneration of electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the excited and flipped spintronic electrons with a single spin direction can be successfully generated across the ITO (indium tin oxide) and then transferred to the cathode. Hydrogen gas is produced and modulated in the spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen evolution device, which successfully utilizes quantum-mechanical phenomena to improve and distinguish the SPEC hydrogen production efficiency and transfer mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). Noteworthily, the transfer time of the resonance energy is about 10−13 s, therefore this process is faster than redox reactions times of about 10−5 seconds. In principle, the resonance energy transfer from each silver NPs to TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs through circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation, enables an efficient and coherent transfer.19 Furthermore spintronic transport across the interface is revealed through the spin injection by modulating optical and electrical paths. The spin photocurrent can also be smartly modulated by the ferromagnetic configuration of the iron and cobalt-doped ZnO. In the spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen evolution device, the Fermi-level of silver NPs comes in contact with that of the TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs due to the balance of the electronic density on the surface. The Schottky barrier is formed between the silver NPs and Co:ZnO NRs, and the ohmic contact is formed between the silver NPs and Fe:ZnO NRs, as in Fig. 1(c). The silver NPs separate charges under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation. When the spintronic electrons in the silver NPs go through resonance energy transfer to the conduction band of the Co:ZnO NRs, they are unable to go back to either the silver NPs or the electrolyte due to the Schottky barrier. This can improve the intensity and efficiency of spin photocurrent in the field of spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen evolution devices as shown in Fig. 1(d). The power conversion efficiency of SPEC hydrogen evolution cells with a single spin direction is close to 1%, which is close to that achieved by current plasmonic solar cells (∼5%). The SPEC hydrogen evolution efficiency and the corresponding maximum hydrogen production were successfully improved by the utilization of the spintronic SPR energy transfer. On the other hand, spintronics also prevents the SPR hot electrons transfer. We applied the mechanism in the traditional photo-electrochemical water-splitting cell to improve and modulate the efficiency of hydrogen evolution, which is a milestone in making spintronics a reality.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise indicated. The ITO (indium tin oxide) glass was cleaned using standard procedures and was completely dried with nitrogen gas. The substrates were subsequently subjected to surface modifications. Deionized water was used in all the aqueous solutions.
2.2 Preparation of the electrode
The electrode utilized in this work was reproduced as previously reported.20 The ZnO NRs arrays were synthesized by a two-step process. The precursors of the ZnO seed layer and electrolyte of electrodeposition were formulated by dissolving equimolar zinc acetate Zn(CH3COO)2 and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) in deionized water at room temperature, which was then electrodeposited at 80 °C for 5 hours to grow ZnO NRs. ZnO NRs were formed after annealing at 350 °C for 3 hours.
The iron/cobalt seed solution was formulated by dissolving equimolar (0.01 M) Fe(C2H3O2)2/Co(CH3COO)2 in deionized water by adding dropwise on the ZnO NRs and then annealing in the argon environment at 350 °C for 3 hours.
The silver seed solution was formulated by dissolving equimolar (0.1 M) silver nitrate (AgNO3) in ethylene glycol (C2H6O2). Polyvinylpyrrolidone ((C6H9NO)n, 0.005 M) and hexamethylenetetramine (NaBH4, 0.1 M) were added to the solution. The addition of a small amount of PVP prevented aggregation. The samples were then immersed in silver seed solution at room temperature for 12 hours. The anode was prepared by coating silver on the Fe:ZnO and Co:ZnO NRs layer; the cathode was platinum.
2.3 Preparation of spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen production devices
The electrolytes of SPEC hydrogen production devices were formulated with potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, 0.2 M, pH 8.30) in a deionized water:methanol = 1:1 solution under AM 1.5 G and laser radiation, respectively. The light sources were 405 nm and 532 nm lasers. A quarter-waveplate converted linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light having coherent ħ/−ħ angular momentum. The circularly polarized light acted as the incident light for SPEC hydrogen production devices to excite the spintronic electrons.
2.4 FDTD simulations
The simulations of the electromagnetic energy density distributions for silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs were confirmed by the FDTD method with perfectly matched layers using the commercially available FullWAVE, Rsoft software (Synopsys). The simulation resolution of the grid was 2 nm, and the background index of air was 1.0. The Ag/TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanostructures were modeled using the full frequency-dependent dielectric constant. The EM energy density distributions in the Ag/TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanostructures were simulated using a Gaussian pulse entering from the ITO side with wavelengths of 405 nm and 532 nm.
2.5 Characterization of spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen production devices
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover) of the Ag/TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanostructured was utilized to indicate the crystalline patterns. Absorption spectra of the Ag/TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanostructures were taken by using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (CT-2200). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7000) of the Ag/TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanostructures was used to analyze the sample morphology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F CS STEM) of the Ag/TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) nanostructures was performed to obtain the sample morphology and diffraction patterns.21,22 The electrochemical properties of the SPEC hydrogen production devices were analyzed by an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments (CHI) 6273E). The products in gas and solvent were determined by using a gas chromatograph equipped with a high-resolution TOF-mass spectrometer (GC-Mass, JEOL AccuTOF GCx-plus, and SHIMADZU QP2020).
3. Results and discussion
Semiconductor photocatalysts coated with plasmonic nanostructures are promising functional materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen devices. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can increase the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and expand light absorption.15,23 Resonance energy transfer is rarely used nowadays to integrate optical spintronics for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting through bridging the gap between SPR and spintronics. Generally, the SPR of silver nanoparticles generated by optical spin injection produces spin hot electrons for a spin photoelectric current. However, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, an orbital can contain a maximum of only two opposing spin electrons; i.e., if one orbital is assigned a spin up (+1/2), the other has to be assigned a spin down (−1/2). Consequently, the hot electron transfer mechanism of plasmonics in a semiconductor can be principally excluded.24,25
Nanostructures of ZnO, such as nanorods, nanowires, nanospheres, and nanoflowers,26 have promising applications among semiconductor materials in the regime of photocatalysis, photoelectronics, solar cells, supercapacitors, batteries, spintronics, piezoelectricity, sensors, and biomedicine.19,27–32 ZnO has been also considered as a promising diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) by introducing 1–10% of transitional metals (TM).33,34 Most of the previous studies focus on the optical, electronic and ferromagnetic behavior of semiconductor materials doped with 1–10% of transitional metals (TM) (such as Fe, Co, or Ni).35,36 However, these unpaired spin electrons can yield unprecedentedly higher speeds for transportation than traditional electronic devices.37 Compared to other spintronics materials, the ZnO devices based on DMS can be easily achieved by exploiting well-developed semiconductor technology nowadays.38,39 However, this initiates issues such as low dopant solubility and spin polarization,40–42 hindering their practical applications.
The silver nanoparticles were coated by a self-assembly method on ZnO NRs doped with iron and cobalt, serving as the photoanode in this system. The silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs were characterized by XRD analysis and there were slight shifts in the peaks in Fig. S1,† as previously reported,43,44 and substantial changes in the characteristic peak intensities were observed in the XRD diffraction pattern, except for the diffraction angles in Fig. 2(a). Moreover, it is evident from the spectra that no extra phase was detected in the analysis due to the replacement of Zn by Fe or Co rather than the wurtzite structure. The ionic radii of iron and cobalt are close to the ionic radius of Zn2+. On the other hand, iron and cobalt ions can easily substitute in the ZnO lattice. The common orientations of the (111) plane of silver and the (002) plane of ZnO NRs shown in Fig. 2(a) correspond well to the silver face-centered cubic structure (JCPDS no. 04-0783) and ZnO wurtzite structure (JCPDS no. 36-1451), respectively.

The absorption spectra of TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs are shown in Fig. 2(b). The band edges and SPR peaks for silver NPs coated on ZnO, Fe:ZnO, and Co:ZnO NPs were obtained at 330 nm and 432 nm, 335 nm and 420 nm, 335 nm and 450 nm, respectively. The silver NPs-coated Fe:ZnO or Co:ZnO NRs were observed in the 300 to 800 nm range of the UV-visible light spectrum and the interesting effects of the different doping metals resulted in a red shift of the absorption edge according to the narrowing of the band gap. The surface plasmon resonance peak of silver NPs was generated by the frequency of the incident light, close to the surface plasmon, which can generate spin currents across the system interface. The silver NPs coated on iron and cobalt-doped ZnO NRs exhibited a significant wide absorption in the long wavelength range (400–600 nm), due to the replacement of Zn sites with iron and cobalt ions.45,46
The silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs were analyzed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The morphologies of pure ZnO NRs, ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs, Fe:ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs and Co:ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs are shown in Fig. 2(c)–(f), respectively, which confirmed the formation of the NPs and ZnO NRs. The ZnO NRs uniformly and densely covered the substrate. Substantial morphologies are also independent of the dopant metal ions. The slight grain size was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The analysis of the Fe:ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs (g)–(j) and Co:ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs (k)–(n) was carried out by line scanning, mapping, and the observations from high-resolution (HR) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are respectively displayed in Fig. 2(g)–(j) and (k)–(n). The HR-TEM images in Fig. 2(i) and (m) present the 8 nm-diameter silver NPs. According to our previous report,20 we observed that the SPR was more pronounced for enhancing the PEC hydrogen evolution as the size of the silver NPs was reduced to the nanoscale. The SPR behaviors of 8 nm-diameter silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs could be higher than that of large size silver NPs coated on ZnO NRs. The increasing SPR behavior occurs due to separation enrichment of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs by the loading of uniform and dense silver NPs onto the surface of TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs. The distribution of the silver NPs and iron/cobalt-doped ZnO NRs is as shown in Fig. 2(g)–(n), with no agglomeration, good dispersion, and indicating successful modification.
The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs, as well as TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs under AM 1.5 G light radiation, and the optical spin injection by circularly polarized coherent ħ/−ħ, are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(e) and S2.† The currents of Ag-coated Fe:ZnO and Co:ZnO NRs were, therefore, pivotally contributed by spintronics, excluding valence band electron transport. The silver NPs were coated by a self-assembly method on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs, which served as the photoanodes in this SPEC hydrogen evolution device. The cathodes were made of platinum, as shown in Fig. 1. The methanol oxidation reaction was not found from the described setups. The LSV curves of the optimized TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs as photoanodes under optical spin injection with laser wavelengths of 405 nm and 532 nm are shown in Fig. 3(b)–(e), respectively. For comparison, the efficiencies of the ZnO NRs coated with silver NPs, and TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs in the SPEC hydrogen evolution device acquired under AM 1.5 G and optical spin injection via the 405 nm and 532 nm lasers are calculated and presented in Tables 1–3. Under AM 1.5 G irradiation, Ag/Co:ZnO NRs as the photoanode with close to 0.67 V bias voltage had the highest efficiency (128.70%) in this SPEC hydrogen evolution device, as shown in Table 1 & eqn (1). According to Fig. 2(b), the UV-vis data displayed that the narrow band gaps resulted from the incorporation of the coating and doping effects. (1)

The spin photocurrent in the SPEC hydrogen evolution device was from the flipped-spin excited electrons of surface plasmon resonance energy transferred in the conduction band of the Fe:ZnO or Co:ZnO NRs under the optical spin injection having a laser wavelength of 405 nm and 532 nm.
The excited spintronic electrons with a single spin direction were generated in this SPEC hydrogen evolution device and also calculated and presented in Tables 2 and 3. Fig. 3(b)–(e) illustrate the different LSV curves of the spin-up and -down photocurrent densities from TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs in the SPEC hydrogen evolution device under the optical spin injection with laser wavelengths of 405 nm and 532 nm due to the spin filter from the effects of doping ferromagnetic metals in the ZnO electrode. The highest SPEC hydrogen evolution efficiency of the Ag/Co:ZnO NRs sample under the circularly polarized coherent ħ light irradiation of 405 nm was 174.46% due to the good matching of the SPR wavelength of Ag NPs. The lowest SPEC hydrogen evolution efficiency of the Ag/Fe:ZnO NRs sample under the circularly polarized coherent ħ light irradiation of 532 nm was 54.34%. The SPEC hydrogen evolution efficiency increased by three times due to the SPR effect, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. The calculated amounts of the corresponding maximum hydrogen production are given in Tables 1–3 from eqn (2). (2)V is the maximum hydrogen production amount. Iηmax is the photocurrent density at maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency. C is the coulomb. Na is Avogadro's number. R is the ideal gas constant. T is the room temperature.
The highest SPEC maximum hydrogen production of the Ag/Co:ZnO NRs sample under the circularly polarized coherent −ħ light irradiation of 405 nm was 1.70 × 10−3 L s−1 m−2 and the lowest SPEC maximum hydrogen production of the Ag/Fe:ZnO NRs sample under the circularly polarized coherent −ħ light irradiation at 532 nm was 4.02 × 10−4 L s−1 m−2. The SPEC maximum hydrogen production increased by four times, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. More spin-down electrons were excited by the circularly polarized light of coherent −ħ radiation. The stronger density distributions of resonant EM energy also had more excited electrons of surface plasmon resonance energy by the plasmon–electron coupling effect. Since the spin filter affects the ZnO electrode due to the doping of ferromagnetic metals, the SPEC hydrogen evolution efficiency of the spin-up electrons in Tables 2 and 3 was higher than that of spin-down electrons by the circularly polarized light radiation. On the other hand, the Schottky barrier was formed between the silver NPs and Co:ZnO NRs. The silver NPs separated charges under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation. When the spintronic electrons in the silver NPs through resonance energy transfer migrate to the conduction band of the Co:ZnO NRs, they are unable to go back to either the silver NPs or the electrolyte due to the Schottky barrier. This results in an enhanced intensity and efficiency of spin photocurrent in the field of the Ag/Co:ZnO NRs system. The calculated spin polarization based on eqn (3) is shown in Fig. 3(f)–(i). P% = (J↑ − J↓)/(J↑ + J↓)(3)P is the polarization efficiency. J↑ and J↓ are the current densities of spin up and down electrons.
The spin polarization efficiency of the SPEC hydrogen evolution is almost 100%, which is similar to the quantum polarization gate based on a single atom in an optical resonator. Almost 100% spin polarization can be realized, even without applying any external magnetic field. That significant ferromagnetic polarization behavior in the system results from the transition metals substituted in ZnO NRs. Additionally, the more significant resonant EM energy density in the SPR wavelength further supports that the silver NPs in the TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs advance the optical spin injection enhancement, plasmon-to-electron conversion, and resonance energy transfer in the SPEC hydrogen evolution device. The details about the SPR effect are discussed in the following simulation analysis by the finite difference time domain (FDTD).
In order to confirm the above results, the crucial factors of the spintronic-photoelectrochemical (SPEC) hydrogen devices of the 3D nanostructures were implemented through the extensive finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. The surface plasmon of silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs were examined towards optical simulation. The silver NPs on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs were synthesized and were identical to those investigated through the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2. The FDTD optical simulation model was initiated with information concerning the amounts, sizes, and thicknesses of the fabricated NPs and NRs. The distinct pulse EM waves across the silver NPs coated on different substrates used to analyze the energy density distribution were 405 nm-wavelength light for both substrates Fe:ZnO NRs and Co:ZnO NRs, and 532 nm-wavelength light for both substrates, Fe:ZnO NRs and Co:ZnO NRs in SPEC hydrogen devices in Fig. 4(a)–(d), respectively. The dotted line shows the 3D structure schematics of the silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs in the FDTD optical simulations with a pulse EM wave exiting from the ITO side. The FDTD optical simulations are based on a single 3D nanostructure in the SPEC hydrogen evolution devices due to the disordered arrays of the silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs on the ITO. The distinct pulse EM waves of 405 nm-wavelength and 532 nm-wavelength incident lights were simulated to distinguish the optical absorptions of silver NPs with and without the SPR effect, respectively. According to the FDTD optical simulation in Fig. 4(b), optical absorption and surface plasmon coupling with the 405 nm pulse EM wave was stronger than others in Fig. 4 due to the frequency of the incident light corresponding to the SPR frequency. As shown in Fig. 4(b), a stronger well-defined standing resonance in EM energy density distributions accompanied the adjacent silver NPs by the surface plasmon coupling effect. On the one hand, this is because the incident light has interaction with the SPR coupling modes between silver NPs and Co:ZnO NRs according to the contribution of the activated energy supported by SPR. On the other hand, the local EM energy densities in Fig. 4(b) and (d) are stronger than those in Fig. 4(a) and (c) based on the stronger coupling effect harvesting more photons as resonance modes between silver NPs and Co:ZnO NRs. The ordered array of silver NPs has demonstrated its influence on the EM field generated at the silver NPs surface. This ordered array is prone to cause electron polarization among the silver NPs, and it will generate a stronger EM field of surface plasmon polaritons as the spacing radius decreases. According to the above-explained factors, there is a greater possibility of transferring electrons from silver NPs to the Co:ZnO NRs layer in the SPEC hydrogen devices.

Spintronics resonance involves manipulating individual electron spins for quantum information processing by Rashba coupling. In this context, we investigated the different magnetization of metals and circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ photon radiation on Rashba spintronics coupling. Rashba spintronics coupling between the spin-up and spin-down can be measured on the silver NPs coated on TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation in a different basis, which is demonstrated in Fig. 5(a)–(d). In order to calculate Rashba coupling in the study, we used the Ising model of the Hamiltonian function: H↑↓ = α × S↑ × S↓(4)where H↑↓ is the energy of spin coupling, α is the Rashba coupling rate, S↑ is the current density of each spin-up electron, S↓ is the current density of each spin-down electron.

The non-centrosymmetric DMS such as the wurtzite structure disclosed the superimposing nature of the Rashba spintronics coupling.47 Our system also acquired antisymmetric exchange interactions, as shown in Fig. 5(a)–(d). The DMS with strong Rashba spintronics interaction has a spectrum-influenced Rashba effect that consists of two spin-resolved parabolas shifting in opposite directions in voltage space. Due to the Rashba effect in Fig. 5(a)–(d), the coupling of two spin-resolved direction systems was read by initiating two quantum bits (qubits) of Ising modes. In the two qubits SPEC hydrogen evolution device, the system can be in multiple superimposed modulations for four different bits, which allow the perspectives of quantum-mechanical phenomena to be utilized for the improvement of the SPEC hydrogen production efficiency.48 The coupling rates were also calculated and presented in Fig. 5(e)–(h). The Rashba coupling rate of the Co:ZnO NRs sample irradiated under circularly polarized coherent ħ/−ħ light was higher than the Fe:ZnO NRs sample, which displayed the same outcome as the efficiency of the SPEC hydrogen evolution. Based on the Rashba spintronics coupling presented in Fig. 5, we performed quantum state tomography of Bell states to verify the multiple entangled states in the modulation system superimposed by two qubits, in Fig. 6, S3 and S4.† The circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ is sequenced as in Fig. 6(a) in quantum circuits. The heights of the color bars display the absolute values of the density matrices as provided in Fig. 6(c)–(f), indicating that the Bell state demonstrates the multiple entangled states in the modulation system superimposed by two-qubits.

We have depicted that the design of an optical spintronics injection provides innovative insights into the SPEC hydrogen evolution device to improve the efficiency of the photoelectrodes. Optical spin injection can respectively pump excited electrons and hot electrons of the selected spin from NRs and Ag NPs. Although the energy level relation between the band gap of NRs and the Ag SPR band allows electrons and holes to migrate to produce hydrogen gas, the migration is forbidden due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Resonance energy transfer can be realized through the transfer of SPR energy from Ag NPs to NRs, avoiding the Pauli exclusion principle as in Fig. 1(d). Then, the electrons and holes can form in NRs and migrate to the cathode and anode surface to generate hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. The SPEC hydrogen production efficiency is therefore successfully improved by the utilization of efficient control of the circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation under the status of spintronic SPR energy transfer. Moreover, the spintronics also prevents the transfer of the SPR hot electrons and shows quantum entanglement of the two qubits during spin–plasmon–electron interactions.
4. Conclusions
We have developed and evaluated a nanostructured SPEC hydrogen evolution device composed of TM:ZnO (TM: Fe, Co) NRs coated with silver NPs, which functions under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ radiation. Compared to the PEC hydrogen evolution device, the enhancement of efficiency through the control of a single spin direction and the coupling effect of resonant EM energy density has been achieved in the SPEC hydrogen evolution device. The silver NPs in the system increased the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and also utilized spin transportation in the SPEC hydrogen evolution device, thanks to the status of energy transfer by spintronic SPR. The SPEC hydrogen evolution efficiency and corresponding maximum hydrogen production were successfully improved to as high as 174.46% and 1.70 × 10−3 L s−1 m−2, respectively, through the utilization of the spintronic SPR energy transfer under circularly polarized light of coherent ħ/−ħ in a single spin direction. The idea demonstrated in this work is the simultaneous operation and control of the electronic spintronics of the nanostructures of the SPEC hydrogen evolution device for the effective control of the spin current by resonant energy transfer. The spintronics successfully prevented the transfer of SPR hot electrons and showed the quantum entanglement of the two qubits during spin–plasmon–electron interactions in the increased efficiency of the SPEC hydrogen evolution. We have achieved a new approach to realize spintronics, through resolving the difficulties in applying these techniques.
