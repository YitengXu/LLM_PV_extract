    , Accepted 30th July 2021First published on 24th August 2021AbstractMaterials with low work functions are critical for an array of applications requiring the facile removal or efficient transport of electrons through a device. Perovskite oxides are a promising class of materials for finding low work functions, and here we target applications in thermionic and field electron emission. Perovskites have highly malleable compositions which enable tunable work function values over a wide range, robust stability at high temperatures, and high electronic conductivities. In this work, we screened over 2900 perovskite oxides in search of stable, conductive, low-work-function materials using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. Our work provides insight into the materials chemistry governing the work function value of a perovskite, where materials with barely filled d bands possess the lowest work functions. Our screening has resulted in a total of seven promising compounds, such as BaMoO3 and SrNb0.75Co0.25O3 with work functions of 1.1 eV and 1.5 eV, respectively. These promising materials and others presented in this study may find use as low work function electron emitters in high power vacuum electronic and thermionic energy conversion devices. Moreover, the database of calculated work functions and materials chemistry trends governing the value of the work function may aid in the engineering of perovskite heterojunction devices.
1 Introduction
The work function is a fundamental surface electronic property, defined as the energy required to move an electron from the bulk Fermi level to the vacuum level outside the material. The work function is a crucial parameter for materials used in a wide array of vacuum and solid-state electronic devices, including vacuum electronics, thermionic energy converters, oxide electronic heterostructures, solar photovoltaic cells, memristors and catalysts. In this work we target application of perovskites for thermionic and potentially field electron emission cathodes. A low work function material is critical in emission cathodes for the generation of the high emitted current density1,2 needed for the efficient use of thermionic, photo, and field emitters widely employed in high power, high frequency vacuum electronic device (VED) applications such as traveling wave tubes (TWTs),3 klystrons,4 gyrotrons,5 and magnetrons.6 These devices are crucial components in diverse applications ranging from communications, industrial food production, national defense, deep space exploration, and scientific research.7 The work function is also the crucial parameter for electron emissive layers employed in conventional and photon-enhanced thermionic energy conversion devices, where both high and low work function materials are desirable in order to maximize the open circuit voltage of the thermionic converter, thus enabling high output power for a given current density.8–10
Impregnated W cathodes have been used as a thermionic emission material in commercial VEDs for decades. In its simplest form, the impregnated W cathode consists of a porous tungsten body impregnated with electron emission promoting materials such as a CaO–Al2O3–BaO mixture (the so-called “B-type” cathode). During activation, free Ba atoms diffuse to the W surface and form a Ba–O monolayer,11 which acts as a surface dipole12 and lowers the effective work function of the cathode from 4.5 eV (the average value of bare polycrystalline W) to about 2 eV.13 The B-type cathode has been further engineered to include an Os/Ru thin film coating, resulting in a further reduced work function of about 1.8 eV (the so-called “M-type” cathode).14 The newest generation of impregnated W cathode is the scandate cathode (W + BaO + Sc2O3). These cathodes have gained much research interest in the past 25 years due to their extremely low work function of about 1.1 eV and ability to realize ultra-high emitted current densities in excess of 100 A cm−2.15–19 Despite the commercial use of B- and M-type cathodes and decades of research on scandate cathodes, impregnated cathodes of all types have important shortcomings. Namely, these cathodes suffer from Ba depletion20,21 and surface degradation14 as a result of the continual evaporation of Ba from the emitting surface during high temperature operation. This off-gassing of the work-function-lowering Ba species limits the cathode lifetime. In addition, impregnated cathodes can experience non-uniform Ba coverage, leading to device efficiency limits22 and engineering challenges.23 For the specific case of scandate cathodes, the previous shortcomings all apply, but scandate cathodes tend to require extra activation and have issues of manufacturing and performance repeatability.19,24–26 These above-mentioned issues all stem from the fact that impregnated cathodes realize their low work function through the formation of a volatile surface dipole layer believed to be comprised mainly of Ba and O. While much study has been devoted to understanding the surface chemistry, atomic-scale structures and resultant work functions of the surface dipole species for B-type, M-type and scandate cathodes,12,27–31 the natural materials design question becomes: is there a different material one could use as an electron emitter that can reach low work function without an extra surface layer, and therefore not be prone to the critical issue of limited cathode lifetime? The discovery and design of such a stable, low work function, ultra-long-lifetime electron emission material may ultimately enable the deployment of high-power, high frequency VEDs and related devices that can operate at lower temperatures, realize high emitted current densities, and reduce operational and device replacement costs.
To address the above materials design question, in this study we turn our attention to perovskite oxide materials (A1−xAx′B1−yBy′O3 stoichiometry). In general, perovskites are a broad class of materials known for their high degree of compositional flexibility, where their structure can support upwards of 90% of the elements in the periodic table (within some solubility limit) without losing its three-dimensional interconnected network of octahedra.32 This high degree of compositional flexibility enables perovskites to have a wide range of tunable properties, including tunable work function values. The recent studies of Jacobs et al.33 and Zhong et al.34 both demonstrated that the work function of perovskite materials can vary on the scale of several eV, and depends on the bulk material composition, the surface orientation (e.g. (001) versus (011)), and the surface termination (e.g. AO- versus BO2-terminated (001) surface). These studies were the first to characterize the work functions of a representative set of perovskite oxides using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods for applications in electron emission and heterojunction engineering, and suggest that perovskites with low work functions may be realized by virtue of the polar (001) oriented surfaces of the perovskite structure.33,34 Jacobs et al. also identified an approximate linear correlation between (001) surface work function and the bulk O p-band center.33 A recent study from Xiong et al.35 used a data-driven approach to analyze the electronic-structure factors controlling the work function of perovskites, and corroborated that the O p-band center is an effective work function descriptor. The O p-band center is the centroid of the oxygen-projected density of states (see Section 4 for more details), and can be calculated from a single DFT bulk structure relaxation run. This established correlation of surface work function with bulk O p-band center enables fast screening of perovskite work functions at a rate that is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than conducting computationally expensive Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)36 hybrid functional calculations of perovskite surface slabs. Jacobs et al. specifically identified SrVO3 as a promising cathode material with a calculated (001) SrO terminated work function of about 1.9 eV and predicted that Ba dopant impurities in SrVO3 should segregated onto the (001) surface, creating a BaO-terminated (001) surface with a very low work function of 1.1 eV.33 Meanwhile, SrVO3 has been experimentally shown to be a good electronic conductor and stable under reducing conditions.37,38 These properties make SrVO3 a promising electron emission cathode material worthy of further study. This naturally leads to the question: What other perovskite oxides might also have a low work function, good electrical conductivity, and good chemical stability, and thus be promising electron emission materials?
Motivated by these questions of materials discovery and design of low work function perovskites, we performed high-throughput screening using DFT methods to assess the predicted work function, thermodynamic stability under operating conditions, and conduction characteristics of 2913 perovskite oxide compositions. Our high-throughput screening resulted in the discovery of seven compounds predicted to have low (<2.5 eV) AO-terminated (001) surface work functions. Examples of promising compounds include BaMoO3, SrNb0.75Co0.25O3, BaZr0.375Ta0.5Fe0.125O3 and BaZr0.375Nb0.5Fe0.125O3, which are predicted to have work functions of 1.1 eV, 1.5 eV, 0.9 eV and 1.6 eV, respectively. In addition, the new HSE-level work function data obtained from this screening allowed us to further verify and refine the correlation between surface work function and bulk O p-band center first proposed in ref. 33. Finally, the large amount of data obtained from this computational search enabled an enhanced understanding of the materials chemistry governing the work function of perovskite oxides. Specifically, we discovered a qualitative empirical relationship between the work function and the number of d electrons, where materials with barely filled d bands (e.g. only one or two d electrons) result in the lowest work functions while insulators containing zero d electrons and late transition metal perovskites with nearly filled d bands result in the highest work functions.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 High-throughput materials screening procedure and elimination criteria

Fig. 1 contains an overview of the high-throughput screening process and elimination criteria used in this work. The complete set of 2913 perovskite materials was obtained in part from a previous high-throughput screening study of perovskite oxides for the application of stable, high activity oxygen reduction catalysts for solid oxide fuel cells (the full list of materials can be found in ESI,† Section S6).39 The structure of perovskite oxides is shown in Fig. 2(a). The remaining perovskite materials were simulated in this study with the aid of the MAterials Simulation Toolkit (MAST).40 Additional details of the composition space explored and other computational details can be found in Section 4. Here, we list our chosen elimination criteria used to successively reduce the space of promising perovskite materials for use as low work function electron emitters. The subsequent sections provide our rationale for the choice of each of these elimination criteria, together with the results of the screening analysis for each criterion. The first screening step used the bulk O p-band center as a descriptor of the work function to eliminate materials with a predicted work function higher than 2.01 eV, which is the predicted value of SrVO3 at the GGA level. The second screening step used this down-selected pool of low predicted work function candidates to further eliminated compounds expected to be less stable under typical thermionic cathode operating conditions than SrVO3 based on convex hull analysis, i.e. materials with an energy above the convex hull greater than 43 meV per atom, the calculated stability value of SrVO3 at the GGA + U level. We note that this screening prioritizes work function, as that is our main interest. However, this approach uses a rather approximate value (the work function prediction) in the first screening step, and it is possible that screening on stability would be a better first step, followed by work function. In practice we perform all the necessary bulk DFT calculations for both properties together and screen on both together, so the order has no impact. The third screening step assessed the DFT-predicted electronic conductivities of the pool of predicted low work function, stable materials using the HSE functional. In our screening process we eliminated materials that were predicted to have band gaps of 0.5 eV or greater, based on the expectation that they will be poor electrical conductors. Finally, the last screening step is to directly calculate the (001) AO-terminated work function at the HSE level and eliminate compounds with a work function of greater than 2.5 eV, therefore producing the set of new promising perovskite materials as low work function thermionic cathodes. We remark here that materials that are insulating but have low work function, while not promising for use as thermionic cathodes in high power VED applications, may still find use as field emission coatings. For example, the materials Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO341,42 and N-doped SrTiO343,44 have been successfully used as thin film, work-function-lowering field emission coatings on Si, as well as direct field emission from nanotips of PbZrxTi1−xO3.45 As the field emission process relies on a low work function and electron tunneling through the cathode surface, the use of an insulating material is less of a critical design issue.

2.1.1 Elimination criterion 1 (predicted work function). 

Ref. 33 demonstrated a linear relationship between the HSE-calculated work function (for both AO- and BO2-terminated (001) surfaces) and bulk HSE O p-band center. However, it was computationally intractable to screen the full set of 2913 perovskites in this study at the HSE level. Therefore, it was first necessary to verify this correlation persists at the GGA level. Here, we chose to evaluate the O p-band center trend at the GGA level as opposed to the GGA + U level based on recent findings that showed that GGA resulted in improved statistical correlations of numerous perovskite properties with the O p-band center compared to the use of GGA + U.46Fig. 3 contains a plot of the GGA-calculated AO work function of a representative set of 27 perovskites as a function of the bulk GGA O p-band center. We note here that in this work, all predicted and calculated work functions are for (001) oriented perovskites with the AO surface termination, whose structure is shown in Fig. 2(b). This was chosen as the surface of interest based on work reported in ref. 33 and 34 that showed that these surfaces tend to have low work functions due to surface dipoles directed away from the terminating surface that lower the electrostatic barrier and the work function. The set of perovskites used to construct the correlation in Fig. 3 includes: La(Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co, Ni, Cu, Al, Ga)O3, Sr(Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Ru, Co)O3, and Ba(Ti, Zr, Hf, Mo, Nb, Sn)O3. Fig. 3 demonstrates there is a linear relationship between the GGA AO work function and GGA bulk O p-band center with an R2 value of 0.83, this correlation is slightly higher although generally quite similar to that of AO work functions for metallic perovskites at the HSE level in ref. 33 (R2 = 0.77). Although the largest work function spread in this correlation is more than 1 eV, the RMSE of this fit is only 0.29 eV. By applying the correlation between work function and O p-band center in Fig. 3, we eliminated candidate materials with predicted work function higher than 2.01 eV, the predicted work function of SrVO3 at the GGA level. SrVO3 was chosen as the reference system to ascertain whether other perovskites have a sufficiently low predicted work function to be interesting for two reasons: (1) SrVO3 has already been simulated at the HSE level and shown to have a low (001) AO terminated HSE work function of about 1.9 eV,33 thus making it a promising material, and (2) our choice of using a known promising material for the work function cutoff is a conservative one, which will likely minimize the number of false positive predictions. Based on the reference work function value of 2.01 eV and the RMSE of 0.29 eV, it is most likely that the resulting materials will have work functions lower than 2.59 eV, which is two standard deviations above the cutoff. Given the fact that LaB6, a widely used commercial cathode, has a work function of 2.6 eV,47 our identified low work function candidates will likely have comparable or lower work functions than LaB6 and thereby justify further, in-depth experimental assessment.

The results in Fig. 3 were fit to line to yield the following relationship between the GGA (001) AO-terminated work function and the bulk O p-band center: ΦGGAAO,pred = 0.52 × Op-band + 3.90(1)Using this relationship between predicted GGA work function and O p-band center, we calculated the predicted work function of all 2913 simulated perovskites. In this screening step, 892 perovskites have a predicted work function lower than the SrVO3 predicted GGA value of 2.01 eV.


2.1.2 Elimination criterion 2 (stability under operating conditions). 
Next, we chose to exclude perovskites that are calculated to be unstable in a typical thermionic cathode operating environment of high temperature and ultra-high vacuum corresponding to T = 1000 °C and p(O2) = 10−10 torr. We calculated the energy above the convex hull (Ehull) with GGA + U as a measure of material stability. Ehull measures the decomposition energy of a material into the set of most stable phases, with a value of zero indicating the material under investigation resides on the convex hull and is formally stable. Recent studies have shown that there are numerous materials that are calculated from DFT to reside above the convex hull, yet can be routinely synthesized and used in functional applications. These studies have found that a more realistic cutoff of material stability may be up to about 50 meV per atom above the hull.48–50 From our DFT calculations, we found that SrVO3 has an Ehull value of 42 meV per atom under thermionic cathode operating conditions (see Section 4 for details of how the energy above convex hull was calculated). This value is within the Ehull range of materials found to be readily synthesizable, and SrVO3 has been experimentally made and used in applications ranging from oxide electronics to anodes for solid oxide fuel cells.37,51–53 Therefore, to focus on a smaller set of materials with even higher probability of good stability, we used the Ehull value of 42 meV per atom as the stability elimination criterion.

Fig. 4 contains a plot of the predicted work function (calculated from the O p-band center descriptor trend in Fig. 3) as a function of the calculated Ehull values for all materials analyzed in this study. In the scatterplot of Fig. 4, the data are grouped according to the number of d-band electrons, as determined by electron counting rules assuming complete ionic bonding (e.g. for SrVO3, V is in the 4+ oxidation state, so this is a 3d1 material, and the d-band occupation is assumed to be 1) (see Section 4 for more information on how the d-band electron counts were calculated). Fig. 4 illustrates that materials with zero d-band electrons have high predicted work functions while materials with a low, but nonzero, number of d-band electrons (greater than zero but less than or equal to three) have the lowest predicted work functions. Materials with d-band electron counts greater than three but less than or equal to ten have a spread in work function values, but their predicted work functions are similar to materials with zero d-band electrons, i.e., consistently higher than the materials with few (but nonzero) d-band electrons. These trends are discussed in more detail in Section 2.3. Applying our stability screening, the previous pool of 892 candidate materials was reduced to 145 materials.

The two histograms along x- and y-axis demonstrate the distribution of energies above convex hull and the distribution of predicted work functions, respectively. The blue, red and green symbols denote perovskites with n electrons in the d-band (n = 0, 0 < n ≤ 3, 3 < n ≤ 10, respectively), based on electron counting rules assuming complete ionic bonding. 


2.1.3 Elimination criterion 3 (electrical conductivity). 
The third step of our screening process was to remove candidate materials that are unlikely to be sufficiently electrically conductive for use as thermionic electron emitters. It is necessary for a thermionic emitter material to be electrically conductive in order to realize the desired high current emission densities required in modern vacuum electronic devices. We focus on materials with low band gap, because for small band gap materials there will be many charge carriers excited into the conduction band leading to large conductivity. The opposite will occur for a large band gap material. We note that this approach does not screen for more subtle drivers of low conductivity, e.g., large polaron hopping barriers, which are beyond the scope of this work. We assumed that only examining materials with zero band gap was too stringent a cutoff. The perovskites examined in this work typically contain transition metals in high oxidation states (e.g. Co4+). Consequently, additional physics of these materials may occur at the high operating temperatures of thermionic cathodes that could produce a reduction in the band gap compared to the zero temperature DFT-calculated HSE band gap. These physics could include: magnetic transitions,54 formation of oxygen vacancies,55 or small structural changes (e.g. Jahn–Teller distortion54) that would influence the electronic structure without resulting in a large structural change but were not explicitly included in our simulations. While it is difficult to quantify the energy scale of these effects on the band gap in a general way, we assumed a reasonable upper bound of 0.5 eV. Therefore, we used a band gap of 0.5 eV as the threshold value, and eliminated compounds with an HSE-calculated band gap greater than 0.5 eV. As aforementioned, such insulating materials may find use in field emission applications, but are not in the scope of this study.
145 materials passed the predicted work function and stability elimination criteria and a summary of the key calculated properties of these materials is provided in the ESI.† In this screening step, we calculated the bulk HSE-level band gaps of 25 of these 145 compounds which have the lowest predicted work functions according to eqn (1), based on their O p-band centers. The results are tabulated in Table 1. Based on this analysis of 25 compounds, 4 compounds were predicted to have band gaps less than 0.5 eV while the remaining 21 compounds were predicted to have band gaps higher than 0.5 eV, or insulating, and thus not useful as vacuum electronic cathodes. We therefore chose to focus our remaining analyses on the four low band gap, (probably) conductive compounds: Sr0.5La0.5MoO3, Ba0.25Ca0.75MoO3, SrMoO3 and BaZr0.375Ta0.5Fe0.125O3.

2.1.4 Elimination criterion 4 (quantitative work function calculation). 

Table 2 summarizes the Ehull, HSE-calculated band gaps, and HSE-calculated work functions, for the four materials obtained from the band gap screening step. In addition, it includes another three materials, outside of the top 25 predicted low work function materials listed in Table 1. These three materials were from an earlier version of our screening analysis, where we used a linear correlation between O p-band center and work function at the GGA + U level (criterion 1). This correlation was not as accurate as that at the GGA level, so we did not use it in the final analysis in this paper. However, based on this earlier approach, these three perovskites passed our first three elimination criteria (see Fig. 1) and were found to be promising. We included them in Table 2 for completeness. Our calculations show that for these seven materials, all of them have HSE-calculated work functions below 2.5 eV. These materials include BaMoO3 and BaZr0.375Ta0.5Fe0.125O3, which have very low work functions of 1.1 eV and 0.9 eV, respectively. The cells used in these calculations have not included any effort to capture surface segregation. Among these perovskites in Table 2, Ba0.25Ca0.75MoO3 might be expected to have strong Ba segregation due to its larger radius than Ca. Although such segregation is not included in our calculations, it would likely increase the surface dipole and reduce the work function since Ba has a lower electronegativity and larger size than Ca. Therefore, segregation would likely increase the possibility that this is a material of interest. For Sr0.5La0.5MoO3, Sr and La have similar atomic radius and might expect Sr segregation as has been found in some other perovskites. However, the balancing of size, charge, and dipole effect on such surfaces is highly complex, making it difficult to determine the correct surface segregation56 and detailed studies to explore this surface are beyond the scope of this work. The other five perovskites are expected to have no significant segregation on (001)-AO termination since they only have one A-site cation. Overall, we have found seven perovskite materials that emerge as promising, new, stable, low work function, conductive materials for further exploration as thermionic electron emitters.

2.2 Refinement and validation of O p-band center as a work function descriptor
We have used these seven work function values in Table 2 and the original 20 work function values from ref. 33 to refine the trends of HSE-calculated AO surface work functions versus the bulk HSE O p-band center previously revealed in ref. 33. In addition, as a further test of this correlation, we chose a select group of perovskites found to have very low O p-band centers that are lower in value than the materials comprising the original trend, and also included the calculated HSE work functions of these materials. These test materials were chosen solely based on their low O p-band center values, regardless of their stability or band gap values. These additional test materials consisted of: BaNbO3, SrNbO3, PrHfO3, BaTaO3, Ca0.5Ba0.5Ta0.5Nb0.5O3, La0.5Ba0.5Ta0.5Nb0.5O3, La0.5Ba0.5NbO3, Ba0.5La0.25Rb0.25NbO3 (La0.5Ba0.5O- and La0.5Ba0.25Rb0.25O-terminated AO surfaces), and La0.5Rb0.5NbO3.

Fig. 5 shows the HSE-calculated AO surface work function versus the HSE bulk O p-band center values for materials from ref. 33, the promising materials from the screening conducted in this work, as well as the above-discussed test set of very low predicted work function materials. In comparison to the trend of GGA work function and O p-band center values in Fig. 3, the linear correlation between work function and O p-band center in Fig. 5 splits into two trendlines. Consistent with the results and explanation from ref. 33, these two distinct trendlines are the result of differences in the electronic structure of these two sets of materials. The materials comprising the top trendline are either band or Mott–Hubbard insulators with a nonzero HSE-calculated band gap and the materials comprising the bottom trendline are correlated metals.33
 Fig. 5  Refined correlation of the HSE (001) AO-terminated work functions as a function of bulk HSE O p-band center including original data from the work of Jacobs et al. (filled red circles and blue triangles),33 promising materials identified from the screening procedure employed in this work and select tests of very low O p-band center materials predicted from elimination criterion 1 in this work (empty red circles and blue triangles). 
Now that many more perovskite materials have been included in the trends displayed in Fig. 5, some comparisons can be drawn between the trends in Fig. 5 and the original trends presented in ref. 33. In ref. 33, the insulator and metal trendlines had R2 values of 0.78 and 0.77, respectively. In Fig. 5, the updated lines of best fit show the insulator and metal trendlines have R2 values of 0.47 and 0.80, respectively. It is evident the inclusion of more data results in a significantly worse correlation for insulating compounds, but a similar correlation for metallic compounds. Regarding insulating compounds, the poor correlation is expected as the calculated work functions for (001) AO surfaces of insulating perovskites are limited to a small range between about 2.5–3.5 eV so even a spread in the work function values of a few tenths of an eV relative to the trendline results in a low R2 value. Regarding metallic compounds, the consistent correlation despite our inclusion of new data spanning a larger domain of O p-band center values and a larger dynamic range of (001) AO work functions between about 0.8–3.3 eV is encouraging. For the metallic compounds, the corresponding RMSE/σ = 0.45, much smaller than the insulator case (RMSE/σ = 0.73), indicating a statistically more robust fit to the metallic compound work functions.
Although the O p-band center is a reasonably accurate descriptor of HSE work functions for metallic perovskites, one disadvantage of employing this bulk descriptor is it cannot capture the effect of different surface dipoles yielding different work functions for a particular material. As a concrete example, Fig. 5 shows the work functions of Ba0.5La0.25Rb0.25NbO3 with two different surface terminations: the Ba0.5La0.5O surface (work function of 0.99 eV) and the Ba0.5La0.25Rb0.25O surface (work function of 0.79 eV). Ba0.5La0.25Rb0.25NbO3 has a single bulk O p-band center value, yet has AO work functions that differ by 0.2 eV. Calculations by Lee et al. examining the trends of oxygen reduction and intermediate species’ binding energies on perovskite (001) AO and BO2 surfaces using the O p-band center demonstrated that the use of the subsurface O p-band center (instead of the bulk value) could resolve the binding energy difference of the AO and BO2 surfaces for a single perovskite material.57 A similar approach used to discern work function differences arising from differences in surface dipoles may work for the materials investigated here, but doing so would lose the advantage of using a bulk descriptor to enable accelerated predictions of work function.
2.3 Materials electronic structure principles to rationalize low and high work function perovskites
Based on the analysis of predicted work function and stability discussed in Section 2.1.2 and shown qualitatively in Fig. 4, we determined that the number of d-band electrons in these perovskites has a significant impact on determining their work functions. Materials with zero d-band electrons have a high predicted work function, materials with a low number of d-band electrons (less than three but greater than zero) have the lowest work functions, while materials with higher number of d-band electrons (greater than three and less than a full d-band of ten) also have high work functions, in the same range as the materials with zero d-band electrons. In Fig. 6 we have taken all of the data from Fig. 4 and produced a bar chart histogram of the fraction of perovskites with a particular predicted work function, grouped by the number of d-band electrons. Fig. 6, shows that materials with zero d-band electrons, have the highest average predicted work function of 3.17 eV with a standard deviation 0.13 eV. Materials with more than zero but less than or equal to three d-band electrons have an average predicted work function of 1.92 eV with a standard deviation of 0.54 eV, Materials with more than three but less than or equal to ten d-band electrons have an average predicted work function of 2.67 eV with a standard deviation of 0.41 eV, which is qualitatively similar to the results for materials with zero d-band electrons. These trends in Fig. 6 agree with the electronic structure and bonding trends discussed in the work of ref. 33, which discussed the physical basis for these trends from the interplay of bonding ionicity, O p-band center position, and the resulting work function value for different types of perovskites. For example, LaScO3 with zero d-band electrons has a high work function, SrVO3 with few d-band electrons has a low work function, and LaNiO3 with a nearly full d-band also has a high work function.33

2.4 Engineering SrVO3 stability and work function through alloying
From the dataset established during our screening, we extract the stabilities and predicted work functions of alloyed SrVO3 and summarize how different alloy elements affect the properties of SrVO3 in this section. We chose to study the effect of alloying on SrVO3 since SrVO3 has been extensively studied previously38,40 and is under current experimental investigation.58 It therefore provides a convenient reference material for additional refined investigations, such as these alloying effects.

Fig. 7 contains bar plots showing the effect of alloying on the stability and predicted work function when various elements are alloyed on the A-site, B-site, and combined A- and B-sites of SrVO3. From our DFT calculations, the addition of Nb and Ta on the B-site for a range of compositions is expected to enhance the stability, and the alloying of La on the A-site, Nb and Ta on the B-site, and combined alloying of La/Nb and La/Ta on the A-/B-sites are expected to reduce the work function. Overall, these results suggest that the alloyed systems SrV1−xNbxO3, SrV1−xTaxO3, as well as these systems doped with La, deserve further exploration as stable, low work function perovskites. We note that recent studies have shown that SrV1−xNbxO3 alloys with different Nb content can be synthesized, with promising application as anodes for solid oxide fuel cells.53,59
 Fig. 7  Effect of stability and predicted work function from alloying SrVO3 with various dopants on the A-site (e.g. Sr1−xAxVO3), the B-site (e.g. SrV1−yByO3) and both the A- and B-sites together (e.g. Sr1−xAxV1−yByO3). In both plots, the blue, green and purple bars denote site fraction alloying of 12.5%, 25% and 50%, respectively. (A) and (B): Alloying effect on stability and work function of SrVO3, respectively. The values of stability and predicted work function are given relative to the pure compound, therefore negative values indicate enhanced stability and reduced work function relative to the unalloyed material. 
3 Summary and conclusions
In this study, our goal was to discover new stable, low work function perovskite compounds for use as thermionic electron emission cathodes using high-throughput DFT methods. From a pool of 2913 compounds, we successively down-selected sets of materials that were found have a low predicted work function, be stable under typical thermionic cathode operating conditions, be sufficiently conductive by virtue of a small electronic band gap, and finally, possess a low work function (001) AO-terminated surface. From our initial pool of about 2913 compounds, 145 compounds were found to have a low predicted work function and be stable under operating conditions. Of these 145 materials, seven of them were found to be sufficiently conductive and have a low work function. These promising materials consist of SrMoO3, BaMoO3, Sr0.5La0.5MoO3, Ba0.25Ca0.75MoO3, SrNb0.75Co0.25O3, BaZr0.375Ta0.5Fe0.125O3, and BaZr0.375Nb0.5Fe0.125O3. These new compounds, together with SrVO3, constitute the set of most promising materials for new thermionic electron emission cathodes for use in high frequency, high power vacuum electronic devices and potentially as emissive layers in thermionic and photon-enhanced thermionic energy converters.
The large amount of perovskite data analyzed in this work enabled the understanding of what qualitatively governs the work function of a perovskite based on simple empirical electron counting rules. Here, we found that materials with a small number of electrons (e.g. one to three) in the d-band tend to result in the lowest predicted work functions, while insulating compounds with zero d-band electrons and materials containing late transition metals with highly occupied d-bands tend to result in much higher predicted work functions. These trends in materials chemistry provide a simple foundation for qualitatively identifying whether particular perovskite compounds may be expected to have a low or high work function value for a given application.
This work provides a basis for further computational and experimental study of perovskite work functions. Computationally, further study of the promising materials discovered here may involve assessing effects on the stability and work function, such as: cation and oxygen off-stoichiometry, the stability and work function of different surface orientations with and without adsorbed species, and high temperature perovskite structural transitions (e.g. orthorhombic to cubic transitions). Experimentally, the synthesis, characterization, work function measurement and high temperature emission properties of the promising materials discovered here is critical to assessing the quality of these materials as thermionic electron emitters. Finally, the expanded data set of HSE-level perovskite work function calculations in this study may find use in design of perovskite heterojunctions where knowledge of electronic band offsets and dipole engineering approaches are critical.
4 Computational methods
We performed all simulations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).60 Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)61-type pseudopotentials utilizing the projector augmented wave (PAW)62 method were used for all atoms. All calculations were performed with spin polarization enabled. The planewave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. A 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack63k-point mesh was used for bulk GGA and GGA + U64 relaxations and a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for surface slab simulations at the GGA level. A 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for bulk HSE36 relaxations and a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for surface slab simulations at the HSE level. For the GGA + U simulations, the U values of V, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni were 3.25 eV, 3.7 eV, 4.38 eV, 6.2 eV, 3.9 eV, 5.3 eV, 3.32 eV, and 6.2 eV,65 respectively, and were chosen to maintain consistency with the Materials Project database, which is necessary for accurate thermodynamic stability calculations.65 For HSE calculations, the fractions of exact exchange were obtained from previous studies.33,66,67 In these previous studies, the fraction of exact exchange was chosen to reproduce the experimental band gaps and densities of states, and were chosen in these previous studies as 0.25 (LaScO3), 0.15 (LaTiO3, LaCrO3, LaMnO3, LaFeO3), 0.125 (LaVO3), 0.05 (LaCoO3), and 0 (LaNiO3).66,67 For the materials SrVO3, CaNbO3, SrNbO3, and pure and doped BaNbO3, an exact exchange value of 0.125 was used. This value of 0.125 was used because these V- and Nb-based compounds are in the same column of the periodic table and thus are expected to be chemically similar to LaVO3, for which an exact exchange value of 0.125 was found to result in a good fit with experimental electronic structure data. For the band insulators and all other perovskites, a default value of 0.25 was used for the HF exchange fraction. For HSE calculations of doped perovskites, the fraction of exact exchange used was the same as the corresponding pure compound. While we do not know the precise optimal exact exchange value that should be used for each perovskite composition, select tests of the effect of the choice of the exact exchange fraction on the resulting work function for PrHfO3 and Ba0.5La0.25Rb0.25NbO3 demonstrated that varying the exact exchange between 0.125 and 0.25 (the typical range of exact exchange fractions employed in HSE calculations) resulted in a change in work function on the order of 0.05 eV (see the ESI† for more details).
Bulk perovskite structures were all simulated as stoichiometric 2 × 2 × 2 supercells (40 atoms per cell). The use of 2 × 2 × 2 supercells ensures that the octahedral tilting in the perovskite structure can be fully relaxed. When available, the bulk structures of undoped perovskites were modeled using initial structures contained in the Materials Project database.65 The structures of doped perovskites were obtained by replacing elements in the pure perovskites at concentrations ranging from 12.5% to 50% of the A- and/or B-sites. Following the previous study of Jacobs et al., to keep the number of screening calculations of doped compounds tractable, we considered a single ordering for each doped compound, where the dopant atoms were distributed as far from each other as possible on the appropriate perovskite sublattice (i.e. A- or B-sites). It is possible that additional concentrations could yield more interesting candidates. However, such studies become extremely computationally demanding as they would involve very large slabs with HSE. Therefore, we have not pursued additional concentrations at this time although they might be of interest for future work. We have confirmed that different orderings have only minor effects on the O p-band center and energy above convex hull (see the ESI†). A total of 2913 bulk perovskite materials were examined in this work. Of these 2913 materials, 2514 materials were obtained from the work of Jacobs et al., who used similar high-throughput DFT methods to search for stable, high activity perovskite oxides as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes.39 The remaining 399 compounds were calculated in this study following preliminary screening analysis which demonstrated that metallic perovskites with a low number of d electrons tend to exhibit the lowest work functions, thus making this space of materials promising for additional, focused exploration. The source of each material is listed in the ESI.†
The O p-band center is defined as the centroid of the electronic density of states projected onto the O 2p orbitals, referenced to Fermi level, and was calculated using eqn (2): (2)where DO2p(E) stands for density of states projected onto the O 2p orbitals.33
In Sections 2.1.2 and 2.3, perovskite materials were analyzed by grouping materials based on the number of d-band electrons. The number of d-band electrons in a material was calculated using empirical electron counting rules and the assumption of complete ionic bonding. These assumptions result in alkali metals always regarded to be in the 1+ oxidation state, alkaline earth metals in the 2+ state, lanthanides in the 3+ state, oxygen in the 2− state, and the transition metals possessing an oxidation state or mix of oxidation states such that charge balance is realized. In the case of a material containing multiple species on the B-site, the number of d-band electrons for the material is taken as the average number of d-band electrons of the B-site species present. For example, in the case of SrVO3, V is in the 4+ oxidation state, so this is a 3d1 material, and the d-band occupation therefore equal to 1.
The work function (Φ) is defined as the energy required to move an electron from the Fermi level (EFermi) to the vacuum level (Evacuum): Φ = Evacuum − EFermi.(3)Evacuum is defined as the value of the converged electrostatic potential sufficiently far from the terminating surface of interest such that the restoring force on an emitted electron is negligible. To obtain the work function for a given material, we constructed (001) orientated, AO-terminated symmetric 9-layer slabs (88 atoms per supercell). These slabs consist of 5 AO layers and 4 BO2 layers, and have a 2 × 2 surface area containing 4 A or B cations per layer. The previous work of Jacobs et al. demonstrated that the use of 9-layer symmetric slabs was sufficient to give converged work functions with respect to slab thickness, and further, the work function values were not significantly different when symmetric versus asymmetric slabs of comparable thickness were used.33 As the work function is sensitive to surface relaxation,34 the atoms in the top and bottom 3 layers of the surface slabs were allowed to relax, and the remaining 3 layers of atoms were frozen to their bulk coordinates. Select tests at the GGA-level with 2 × 2 × 2 k-points showed that this choice of relaxing 3 layers resulted in changes of the calculated work function of less than 0.1 eV for SrNbO3 (see the ESI† for more details). All surface calculations were performed with dipole corrections enabled and at least a 20 Å vacuum region to minimize the interactions between surfaces. No surface reconstructions were explicitly added to the calculations, although relaxation was allowed to occur as described above. This approach will likely miss most surface reconstructions, especially those that require forming point defects, complex rumpling, or unit cells larger than used here. This limitation is significant, but more accurate treatment of reconstructions for large scale screening is not practical. We hope that the errors introduced by this approximation are at least somewhat ameliorated by our focus on conducting transition metal oxides, which can screen surface dipoles through charge rearrangement68 without significant surface reconstruction. When surface reconstructions do occur, since we are most interested in behavior of the AO surface at high temperature and under high vacuum, common point defects are likely to be oxygen vacancies69–71 or metal adatoms. Metal adatoms would almost certainly reduce the work function due to forming a positive dipole at the surface, thus making our calculated values upper bounds. Since our goal is low work function materials such an error would not change our list of promising materials. Oxygen vacancies seem to typically increase the work function but have a small effect at realistic concentrations,72 suggesting that the impact of such defects will not be significant and again not change our list of promising materials.
We note here that the use of computationally expensive HSE calculations appear to be required to obtain highly-accurate work functions for perovskite materials. Recent work from Ma et al.72 showed through a detailed comparison of experimental and DFT-calculated work functions of an array of surface structures of SrTiO3 that HSE and experimental work functions agree on average within about 0.2 eV. Further, it was found GGA can only capture relative differences in work functions between different types of surfaces (e.g. the difference in work function between AO- and BO2-terminated surfaces) and does not provide the correct magnitude of the work function.72
To calculate the Ehull values, we used the GrandPotentialPhaseDiagram class in the phase diagram module within the Pymatgen toolkit.73 To calculate the Ehull, Pymatgen first establishes a phase diagram using all materials composed of given elements in the Materials Project database, then calculates the Ehull at the point corresponding to the composition of the material under consideration. To mimic environmental conditions typical of a thermionic electron emission cathode, we calculated Ehull for an open system where the chemical potential of O was calculated to coincide with thermionic cathode operating conditions of T = 1000 °C and p(O2) = 10−10 torr. The chemical potential of O was calculated following the work of Jacobs et al., where the DFT-calculated O2 molecule energy was shifted to account for the finite temperature gas enthalpy and entropy values at T = 1000 °C, as well as the ideal gas partial pressure shift to coincide with p(O2) = 10−10 torr.74 Finally, the DFT-PBE errors associated with O binding were handled using the Materials Project energy shift of −0.7023 eV per O,65 and the vibrational entropy contribution was included using an Einstein model with an Einstein temperature of 500 K, following previous studies.12,74
