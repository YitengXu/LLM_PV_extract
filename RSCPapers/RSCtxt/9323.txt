    , Accepted 24th January 2019First published on 25th January 2019AbstractThe development of bifunctional electrochemically-active micro-/nanomaterials with heterostructures for both supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) enables the possibility to integrate energy storage and conversion into one single system. Herein, heterostructural NiCo2S4@MoS2 materials have been successfully prepared using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as templates, including transformation to bimetallic layered double hydroxide, and sequential sulfuration. The smart process entails an assembly of MoS2 nanosheets on NiCo2S4 nanobuilding blocks with hollow core–shell nanoarchitectures. Specifically, when tested as an electrode in a supercapacitor, it can deliver an increased specific capacitance of 860 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, superior rate capability and cyclic stability. Furthermore, the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure also efficiently electrocatalyzes the HER in an alkaline electrolyte with a low overpotential of 194 mV, a favorable HER kinetics and better long-term stability. Results of both scenarios attest to the enhanced electrochemical performance of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure compared to its NiCo2S4 counterpart, which is attributed to the hollow porous core–shell structures, nanointerface engineering and the synergistic effect between NiCo2S4 and MoS2. This work will broaden our horizons in designing and fabricating multifunctional active materials for next generation energy storage and conversion applications.
Introduction
The imminent depletion of fossil fuels and resultant environmental pollution has motivated researchers to explore highly efficient, clean and sustainable energy storage and conversion technology.1–3 Supercapacitors, as promising candidates for new energy storage devices, have attracted much attention due to their high power density, fast charge and discharge characteristics, long cycle life and excellent safety.4–6 Moreover, because of its high energy density and environmental friendliness, hydrogen (H2) has proved to be an ideal energy carrier, which has been produced through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis.7–10 Therefore, either as an advanced electrode for a supercapacitor or as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the HER, developing an appropriate nanomaterial with a superior structure and output is crucial.
Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have shown great prospects for energy storage and conversion with high electrochemical activity due to their various stoichiometric compositions, crystal structures, valence states, and nanocrystalline morphologies.11,12 Furthermore, ternary TMSs have been demonstrated to be more promising electrochemically active materials due to their richer redox reactions and higher electronic conductivity than binary TMSs.13–15 Typically, ternary spinel NiCo2S4 nanomaterials with a variety of meaningful nanoarchitectures have been well investigated for supercapacitor applications, which have been specifically summarized by two recent reviews.16,17 Combination with other two-dimensional (2D) functional materials, including reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and MoS2 is deemed to be an effective strategy to overcome the intrinsic limitations of pure NiCo2S4 with a low surface area and inactive electrons/ions transport, thus resulting in the enhanced electrochemical performance. For instance, flexible yolk–shelled NiCo2S4 hollow spheres/RGO hybrid lamellar films with excellent conductivity exhibited an efficient supercapacitive energy storage capability.18 As a superior electrochemical electrode, hierarchical hybrid NiCo2S4/MoS2 nanotubes exhibit a high rate capability and cycling stability even at high current densities.19 NiCo2S4–graphene–MoS2 nanocomposites exhibit a higher specific capacitance, enhanced rate capability and cycling stability due to the sheet-on-sheet flexible structure and the similarity between NiCo2S4 and MoS2.20 Furthermore, theoretical calculations and experimental results have proved that TMSs composited with MoS2 may exhibit a remarkably improved HER performance due to the advantage of nanointerface engineering and the synergetic effect of different components.21–24 Thus, the exploration of special heterostructures to maximize the synergetic effects is of great significance to boost electrocatalytic activity, such as mace-like MoS2/NiCo2S4/carbon fiber paper heterostructures,25 core–shell Co3S4@MoS2 heterostructures22 and Co9S8@MoS2 on carbon nanofibers.26
Despite these tremendous achievements, it still remains a big challenge to provide a larger surface area, more exposed active sites, and shorter diffusion pathways to facilitate enough electrolyte ions transportation and ensure sufficient electrochemical reactions. In hollow nanostructures, their low density, large surface area, functional shells with special nanobuilding blocks and inter-particle porosity, and reduced transport lengths for both mass and charge transport impart intriguing structure-induced properties and broad applications in nanoreactors, gas sensors, drug delivery, energy storage and conversion.27,28 Moreover, the core–shell heterostructural nanomaterials have gained great attention due to the fact that the core–shell structure can increase the contact interface region and integrate the advantages of each individual constituent.
Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as an emerging class of porous materials composed of metal ions and organic bridging ligands, have been recognized as versatile precursors and templates to achieve function-oriented micro-/nanomaterials due to their adjustable compositions and morphologies.29–31 Undoubtedly, considerable endeavors have been dedicated to precisely fabricate hollow structures with optimized performance for energy storage and conversion. For instance, Lou and co-workers developed a structure-induced anisotropic chemical etching/anion exchange approach to transform Ni–Co Prussian blue analogue nanocubes into NiS hollow nanoframes with excellent electrochemical performance for electrochemical capacitors.32 Very recently, their group has prepared Co3O4/Co–Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions from yolk–shell MOF composites.33 CoSe2/(NiCo)Se2 box-in-box hollow nanocubes derived from a pre-treated Co-MOF have been reported to catalyze the HER.34 Hollow Zn0.30Co2.70S4 synthesized from homogenous bimetallic MOF precursors showed excellent electrochemical and photocatalytic HER activity.35 Nevertheless, elaborate fabrication of hollow TMS composite nanomaterials with a designed core–shell heterostructure from MOF nanocrystals is not well explored, which is expected to exhibit outstanding performance for the supercapacitor and HER.
As a proof of concept, we design and fabricate robust hollow core–shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 dodecahedrons through a facile ZIF-67 (ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework) engaged strategy. Benefitting from the omnifarious merits, including the hollow structure, core–shell heterostructure, nanointerface engineering, and the synergy between different components, the resultant NiCo2S4@MoS2 materials exhibit increased specific capacitance, enhanced rate and cyclic performance for a supercapacitor, and improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for the HER, respectively.
Experimental
Materials
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9%) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9%) were purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) and 2-methylimidazole (MeIm) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.
Preparation of ZIF-67 dodecahedrons
In a typical process, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.291 g, 1 mmol) and MeIm (0.328 g, 4 mmol) were respectively dissolved in 25 mL methanol to form a solution. And then the cobaltous solution was added to the MeIm solution and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture solution was aged at an ambient temperature for 24 h. After that, the precipitated purple products were centrifuged and collected, washed three times with methanol and ethanol, and finally dried at 80 °C overnight.
Preparation of Ni–Co LDH nanocages
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.100 g) was dissolved in 25 mL ethanol to form a uniform suspension under ultrasonic conditions. Then, ZIF-67 (0.040 g) was added into the above suspension. Then the mixture was stirred for 19 h at room temperature. The resulting products were centrifuged and washed with ethanol three times and dried at 70 °C overnight.
Preparation of hollow core–shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures
The as-synthesized Ni–Co LDH (0.025 g) nanocages were dispersed in de-ionized (DI) water (6 mL) under ultrasonic conditions for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Then the thioacetamide solution (0.423 g, 2 mL DI water) was added to the suspension under stirring for 30 min, followed by addition of Na2MoO4·2H2O solution (0.302 g, 2 mL DI water) while stirring for another 10 min. Finally, the resulting mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 4 h first, and then heated at 200 °C for 8 h. The product was collected by centrifuging with de-ionized water and ethanol three times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. For comparison, pure NiCo2S4 was synthesized without the addition of Na2MoO4·2H2O.
General characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were collected on a FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 field emission scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 18 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was obtained on a FEI Tecnai-G2F30 transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out on a SHIMADZU XRD-7000S diffractometer with Cu Kα1 (λ= 1.5406 Å) as the radiation source, with the 2θ range of 10°–80° with a scan speed of 5° min−1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms in a Quantachrome Instruments autosorb-iQ-C equipment and the pore diameter distributions were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was obtained on a ThermoFisher ESCALAB™250Xi equipment with Al Kα X-ray radiation as the excitation source. All the binding energies in the XPS analysis were corrected for specimen charging by reflecting them to the C 1s peak.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). The electrochemical tests were investigated in 6 M KOH electrolyte using a three electrode cell consisting of a working electrode, a platinum plate counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode at room temperature. The working electrode was prepared as follows: the active material, carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene dispersion (5 wt%) were mixed in ethanol at a 8:1:1 weight ratio to obtain a slurry. And then the slurry was pressed onto the nickel foam current collector (1 cm2) and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The mass loadings of the active NiCo2S4@MoS2 and NiCo2S4 materials on the Ni foam are 4.3 mg and 6.4 mg, respectively.
The HER measurements were carried out in a typical three-electrode setup in N2-saturated KOH (1 M) electrolyte using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). Catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of catalyst into 1 mL of ethanol solvent containing 40 μL of 5 wt% Nafion through sonication for 30 min. Then, 15 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped onto a glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 5 mm (catalyst loading of ∼0.38 mg cm−2) as the working electrode. A platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. All potentials reported in this study were calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following equation: ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.05914 × pH + 0.098 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured using cyclic voltammetry scanning from −0.15 to −0.05 V versus RHE at different scan rates ranging from 100 to 200 mV s−1 for the HER. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in the frequency range of 1–105 Hz. Chronoamperometric measurements were performed by applying the corresponding potential to support an initial current density of about 10 mA cm−2 for 10 h for the HER.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization
The designed synthetic strategy for the fabrication of hollow core–shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 dodecahedrons is illustrated in Scheme 1. Uniform ZIF-67 dodecahedrons first prepared through the simple solution reaction between Co2+ ions and 2-methylimidazole were selected as the starting precursors. Subsequently, through a simultaneous metal ions hydrolysis, selective etching, ion exchange and cobalt ion oxidation process, ZIF-67 self-sacrificial templates successfully transformed into layered double hydroxide (LDH) with a hollow structure, which was previously well documented by Chen and coworkers.36 Lastly, an intellectual two-step temperature-raising hydrothermal process was adopted to prepare the final NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructural composites. In the initial low-temperature step, the LDH materials were converted into NiCo2S4 hollow dodecahedrons through an anion-exchange reaction by S2− anions. When the temperature was increased to 200 °C, MoS2 nanosheets successfully anchored to the surfaces of the NiCo2S4 dodecahedrons. As a result, well-defined hollow core–shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 dodecahedrons were obtained.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments were carried out to characterize the crystal phases of the as-prepared corresponding samples. The PXRD pattern of as-synthesized ZIF-67 sample matched well with the simulated pattern on the basis of the single-crystal structure, indicating its phase purity (Fig. S1a, ESI†). In the PXRD pattern of as-synthesized LDH (Fig. S1b, ESI†), the presented broad diffraction peaks at 10.54°, 21.34°, 34.13° and 60.52° correspond to the (003), (006), (012) and (110) planes, respectively, revealing the successful synthesis of hexagonal phase of NiCo-LDH (JCPDS card no. 33-0429). The PXRD pattern in Fig. 1 reveals that all the identified diffraction peaks of NiCo2S4 sample matched well with the cubic phase of NiCo2S4 (JCPDS card no. 20-0782). Furthermore, for NiCo2S4@MoS2 composite materials, there are no additional diffraction peaks except for the same peaks as those for the NiCo2S4 sample. The undetectable diffraction that originated from MoS2 may be due to its low crystallinity or tiny amount.37

The morphologies and microstructures of the resultant products were characterized by FESEM and TEM. The FESEM image in Fig. 2a reveals that the ZIF-67 crystals have a rhombic dodecahedral shape with a smooth surface and a uniform size of about 700 nm. After the transformation from ZIF-67 precursors to LDH materials, the integral morphology and dimension were well preserved (Fig. S2a, ESI†). It is notable that the TEM image reveals that the hollow NiCo-LDH dodecahedron with a large inner cavity possesses a much rougher surface consisting of small nanosheets (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The detailed transformation process from solid ZIF-67 templates to hollow LDH nanocages was deeply investigated previously.36 The panoramic FESEM image displayed in Fig. 2b clearly reveals that the NiCo2S4@MoS2 product well inherits the shape and the size even though the two-step temperature-raising hydrothermal process has completed. Additionally, this image further confirms the preservation of the hollow feature from the broken piece of the dodecahedron. A closer SEM micrograph of a single dodecahedron in Fig. 2c suggests that the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure has a rough surface with randomly decorated nanosheets, which is quite different from the nanoparticles assembled surface in the bare NiCo2S4 counterpart (Fig. S3, ESI†). To further discern the morphology and give more insight of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 hybrids, TEM results were presented hereafter. TEM images clearly disclose the hollow structure of NiCo2S4@MoS2 hybrid composed of an inner porous NiCo2S4 layer and outer loose MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. 2d and e). The NiCo2S4 nanoparticles promoting the growth of MoS2 into three-dimensional (3D) architectures can effectively provide bigger specific area and more accessible electrochemically active sites than pure NiCo2S4, enabling sufficient electrochemical reactions.38 In addition, Fig. 2f also demonstrates only a few layer (4–7 layers) stacking MoS2 nanosheets with a defect-rich structure, which may benefit the hybrid materials to catalytically evolve H2.39,40 High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows clear lattice fringes with spacings of 0.28 nm and 0.65 nm, corresponding to the (311) crystal plane of NiCo2S4 and the (002) plane of MoS2, respectively (Fig. 2f inset). Furthermore, this image reveals that the intimate contact between NiCo2S4 and MoS2 building blocks creates the identified atomic-level nanointerfaces. The heterostructural nanointerface engineering would change the electronic nature and optimize the electrochemical performance.21 The line-scan profile across a hybrid dodecahedron exhibits bimodal saddle-like distribution with the evacuation of elements from the inner part and a stronger Mo signal, confirming the hollow core–shell structure (Fig. S4, ESI†).21 The elemental mapping images reveal the distribution of Ni, Co, Mo and S elements (Fig. 2g–j).

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4@MoS2 dodecahedrons calculated from N2 adsorption isotherms are 38.94 and 40.78 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†). The corresponding pore-size distributions based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method indicate the presence of mesopores of around 3 nm in these materials.
To investigate the surface composition and chemical state of as-obtained NiCo2S4@MoS2 hybrids, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 3a, the deconvoluted peaks at 854.0 and 870.9 eV can be ascribed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Ni2+, respectively. The second doublet at 857.3 and 875.3 eV can be attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Ni3+. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum in Fig. 3b can be well deconvoluted into two spin–orbit doublets and two shakeup satellites: the first doublet at 779.2 and 794.2 eV for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Co3+, the second doublet at 782.0 and 798.5 eV for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Co2+, and the left peaks for shakeup satellites.41 Compared to the XPS spectra of pure NiCo2S4, the Ni and Co signal of NiCo2S4@MoS2 is relatively weak, probably due to the shielding effect of MoS2, which also indicates the formation of the core–shell structure. Additionally, the XPS peaks of Ni 2p and Co 2p exhibit slight shift towards the higher binding energy, suggesting the electron transfer from Ni and Co to Mo atoms as a result of the establishment of coupling nanointerfaces between the two phases (NiCo2S4 and MoS2).42,43 In the Mo 3d spectrum, the binding energies at 228.7 and 232.0 eV can be assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, which match well with the oxidation state of Mo4+ (Fig. 3c). It is notable that they are downshifted from the normal value of pure MoS2 (229.4 and 232.6 eV), providing further evidence of the strong electronic interactions between NiCo2S4 and MoS2.44,45 The peak at 235.3 eV is indicative of the existence of Mo6+ from the partial oxidation of Mo4+. In the meantime, the nearby shoulder S 2s peak was deconvoluted into two peaks at 225.8 and 226.8 eV, corresponding to the chemical states of S species bonding with Ni, Co and Mo ions, respectively. The S 2p peaks at 161.6 and 162.9 eV are associated with Ni–S, Co–S and Mo–S bonds. And the S 2p peak observed at 168.9 eV corresponds to the residual SO42− formed by the oxidation effect on the sample surface in air (Fig. 3d).

Electrochemical performance for supercapacitors
The electrochemical performances of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure and their NiCo2S4 counterpart for supercapacitors are examined by using a three-electrode cell configuration in 6.0 M KOH solution. The representative CV curves of NiCo2S4@MoS2 and NiCo2S4 electrodes were obtained in the potential window of 0 to 0.5 V (vs. Hg/HgO) at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a and Fig. S6a, ESI†). In the CV curve of a NiCo2S4 electrode at 5 mV s−1, one pair of broad redox peaks may originate from the reversible Faradaic redox processes of Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ couples in KOH solution.46,47 Upon addition of MoS2, the CV curve displays two pairs of redox peaks particularly at a low scan rate (5 mV s−1). The additional redox peaks may be derived from the electrochemical reversible reactions between different valence states of Mo.38,48 Furthermore, the shifts to more negative potentials of the original anodic and cathodic peaks from NiCo2S4 electrode are possibly ascribed to the interaction between NiCo2S4 and MoS2 (Fig. S7, ESI†). With the increase of the scan rate, the anodic and cathodic peaks in CV curves of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode progressively shift towards a higher and lower potential, respectively, which is indicative of the pseudocapacitive behavior with good reversibility.49
 Fig. 4  (a) CV curves at different scan rates, (b) GCD curves at different current densities of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures, (c) rate capability and (d) cycling performance of the NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures. 
Moreover, GCD curves of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode at different current densities ranging from 1 to 20 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 4b, to further assess its prospects for supercapacitor. The quasi-triangle shape of GCD curves with poorly defined plateaus suggests the pseudocapacitive behavior and the presence of some Faradaic processes, which is consistent with the above CV results. Additionally, these nearly symmetric curves at various current densities imply good reversibility. On the basis of the discharge branch, the specific capacitance of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode is calculated to be 860, 820, 680, 612 and 420 F g−1 at the corresponding current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1. However, the other NiCo2S4-based counterpart delivers the specific capacitive values of 816, 668, 593, 436 and 252 F g−1, respectively, under the same measurement conditions. The specific capacitances of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 and NiCo2S4 electrodes as a function of current density are compiled in Fig. 4c to present their rate capability, which is a key parameter to estimate the fast charge and discharge ability for supercapacitors. When the current density increased from 1 to 20 A g−1, the specific capacitance retention of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode was estimated to be 48.8%, higher than that of pure NiCo2S4 (30.9%), revealing the superior rate capability of NiCo2S4@MoS2 hybrids.
Furthermore, long cycle life is another imperative parameter in determining the long-term energy storage for the commercial application of a supercapacitor. Thus, the cyclic stability of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode was assessed by repeated the charge/discharge test at a current density of 20 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 4d. The specific capacitances of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode decrease from 420 to 300 F g−1 after 1000 cycles with a retention of 71.9% of the initial value, higher than both our NiCo2S4 counterpart (60.7%) at 20 A g−1 and the previously reported NiCo2S4 nanotubes at a low current density (63%).47 Overall, the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode possesses high capacitance, enhanced rate capability and superior cyclic performance than those of the unhybridized NiCo2S4 electrode. The enhanced performance of hollow core–shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 dodecahedrons for a supercapacitor can be rationalized as follows: (i) the combination of redox reactions from NiCo2S4 and MoS2 simultaneously contributes to the specific capacitance; (ii) the hollow structures with NiCo2S4 embedded in MoS2 nanosheets of the 3D nanostructure provides a high specific area and ample active sites as the nanosheets restacking is effectively inhibited, thus enabling sufficient electrochemical reactions; (iii) layered nanosized MoS2 serving as ion-buffering reservoirs can improve the ion diffusion rate within the hybrid materials;50 (iv) the hollow interior and the void space between MoS2 nanosheets can buffer the volume change during the charge–discharge process; (v) the MoS2 nanosheets firmly anchoring to NiCo2S4 nanobuilding blocks reinforces structural integrity.
Electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction
The electrocatalytic HER performances of as-synthesized NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures were evaluated using a typical three-electrode system in KOH solution (1 M) purged with N2. The corresponding polarization LSV curves are shown in Fig. 5a. The NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures showed a small onset potential of 134 mV, beyond which a sharp increase of the cathodic current was observed under more negative potentials. By contrast, the corresponding value of the NiCo2S4 materials (203 mV) is much larger than that of the hybrid materials. We further compare the operating potential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is the current density expected for a solar water-splitting device with 12.3% efficiency.51 The NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructural catalyst can afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 194 mV while the bare NiCo2S4 requires a much larger overpotential of 303 mV to deliver the same current density. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the fitted Tafel slope of NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures was 62 mV dec−1, much lower than 124 mV dec−1 for the bare NiCo2S4, revealing its favorable HER kinetics and a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism with a rate limiting step transition from the Volmer step to the Heyrovsky step (slope between 40 and 120 mV dec−1).52,53 Such outstanding catalytic performance of NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures with low overpotential and small Tafel slope for the HER in an alkaline environment is better than the previously reported MoS2/Co3S4 hollow polyhedra, cobalt incorporated MoS2 nanoboxes and NiS–Ni(OH)2@aMoS2+x/NF (NF = nickel foam), and even comparable to one-dimensional hierarchical CoMoO–S/NF and MoS2 confined Co(OH)2 (Table S1, ESI†).54–58

EIS measurements were further conducted to demonstrate the HER kinetics of the catalysts occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 5c reveal that the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure has a smaller semicircular diameter than that of pure NiCo2S4, indicating remarkably decreased charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for NiCo2S4@MoS2. It is well accepted that the smaller Rct means a faster Faradaic process and a better HER kinetics. The low charge-transfer resistance for NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures presumably resulted from the strong donor–acceptor electronic interaction between the inner NiCo2S4 core and the outer MoS2 shell, as verified by the above XPS results. To provide a better insight into the enhanced electrocatalytic performance, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was deliberately measured to represent the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) by cyclic voltammetry in a non-Faradic region, as the Cdl is linearly proportional to the ECSA. By plotting the difference between the anodic and cathodic current densities at a given potential (−0.1 V vs. RHE) against the scan rate, a linear curve was obtained to determine the Cdl (Fig. S10, ESI†). The resultant Cdl of bare NiCo2S4 is 6.2 mF cm−2, which dramatically increases to 13.0 mF cm−2 in the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure. These results suggest that the designed NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures can expose more effective active sites due to the constructed nanointerface between NiCo2S4 and MoS2, which is responsible for their enhanced catalytic activity.21,22,59 The durability of NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure and bare NiCo2S4 was investigated by repeated linear potential sweeps and chronoamperometry measurements. The polarization curve of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure after continuous 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 exhibits only a small decay compared to the initial cycle (Fig. 5d). The current–time curve exhibits slight current density attenuation (about 14%) over 10 h, implying a good long-term stability. However, the bare NiCo2S4 catalyst shows an obvious overpotential increase after cyclic test and a significant decrease in current density after 10 h (about 49%). These observations indicate that the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructures possess superior cyclic and long-term stability for the HER.
The enhanced electrocatalytic performance with higher activity, favorable kinetics and better durability of the NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure is probably attributed to the following factors: (i) well-organized hollow dodecahedrons with prohibited restacking MoS2 nanosheets can provide a large surface area and increase the number of reaction sites; (ii) the nanointerface between NiCo2S4 and MoS2 would engender extra active sites; (iii) the heterostructures not only bring the properties of the two individual components together, but also lead to the synergistic effects; (iv) the nanointerface could afford electronic interaction and further optimize the electronic structure; (v) the hollow structure together with a 3D architecture of outer MoS2 prevent the adhesion of H2 bubbles to the electrode surface, thereby keeping the integrity of the necessary solid–liquid interface.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a hollow core–shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure with inner NiCo2S4 nanobuilding blocks wrapped by outer MoS2 nanosheets through an elaborate multi-step treatment process using ZIF-67 as a template. The systematic investigations support and explain that the collective advantages, including the unique hollow structure, core–shell structure, the synergy between two phases, and the nanointerface engineering, may synergistically boost the electrochemical performances, in terms of the specific capacitance, rate capability, cyclic stability for a supercapacitor, and electrocatalytic activity and robustness for the HER. This work will promote the extended exploration of more MOF-derived nanohybrids with controlled compositions and complex hollow structures for a variety of energy related applications.
