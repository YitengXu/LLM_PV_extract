    , Accepted 24th February 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractWe showed that the widely used solvent molecule, N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF), readily adsorbs on the surface of TiO2 electrodes of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and that the adsorbed DMF molecules remain intact on the TiO2 surface even after long-term annealing of the perovskite layer, resulting in an increase in the contact resistance of the PSCs. We found that the absorption of DMF is significantly suppressed by modifying the TiO2 electrode surface with a fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA). We also suggested that the high electron affinity of PCBA enhances the charge transportation at the perovskite/TiO2 interface and reduces the contact resistance.
Organometallic perovskite materials have been reported to have exceptional light-absorbing and charge transport characteristics and are promising for applications in highly efficient solar cells.1–8 Since the perovskite materials are soluble in several organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),3,5,7 γ-butyrolactone1 and dimethyl sulfoxide,9 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be fabricated at very low cost by using conventional solution processes. Owing to these advantages, i.e., high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost, PSCs have received much attention from researchers in the field of solar cell technology.
Recently, research on PSCs has been converging to the planar structure since planar PSCs have shown great potential for producing PSCs with higher PCE and low fabrication cost.2,3,10–12 In planar PSCs, the quality and the interfaces of the perovskite layer are the most important factors that determine the performance of planar PSCs. Therefore, the effects of chemical composition and crystallinity on the quality of the perovskite layer have been extensively investigated,13–16 and various fabrication methods have been proposed for improving the quality of the perovskite layer.2,9,11,17–19 However, little is known about the interfaces between the perovskite layer and the electrode. It is quite important to atomically control the interfaces of the perovskite active layer for improving the electrical performance of PSCs.
At the early stage of developmental research on planar PSCs, spiro-MeoTAD and a compact TiO2 layer were used as the hole-transporting material (HTM) and the electron transporting material (ETM), respectively.2,20 It was reported that the PCE of planar PSCs is improved by replacing the HTM and ETM with other suitable materials.11,16,21–23 However, it is not easy to search for new HTMs and ETMs. Appropriate HTM/ETM materials should match the energy level of the perovskite material, and should not affect or not be affected by the perovskite layer during the course of the solution-based fabrication process. In the solution process, the solvent used for forming the upper layer most likely reacts with the already-formed under layer, resulting in inter-diffusion of source materials between the two adjacent layers or degradation of the interfacial regions. Wojciechowski et al. have reported that the interfacial properties of planar CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x PSCs can be improved by modifying the TiO2 electrode surface with functionalized organic molecules.24 Such modified surfaces were chemically stable during subsequent fabrication processes and also were fully compatible with the existing fabrication processes. However, their work mainly focused on the effects of surface modification. The chemical states at the perovskite/TiO2 interface and the mechanism leading to the improvement in the performance have not been fully understood.
In this work, we used infrared absorption spectroscopy in a multi-internal-reflective setup (MIR-IRAS) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the TiO2 electrode surface during the fabrication process of planar PSCs. In our previous work, we have succeeded in improving the performance of TiO2/polymer hybrid solar cells by modifying the TiO2 surface with PCBA.25 In the present study, PCBA is used to modify the perovskite/TiO2 interface. We fabricated planar PSCs with the structure shown in Fig. 1 to demonstrate the effects of different molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode surface.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of perovskite layers on the TiO2 surface with and without PCBA modification. Three peaks at 1580 cm−1, 1469 cm−1 and 1424 cm−1, marked with asterisks in the figure, are attributed to the asymmetrical and symmetrical bending modes of N–H and the asymmetrical bending mode of C–H of the MA cation in the pristine perovskite layer.14 We can also identify a distinct peak at 1655 cm−1 in both absorption spectra of perovskite layers on bare and PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces. Note that the reference for spectra marked as “DMF on TiO2” and “Perovskite w.o. PCBA” in Fig. 2 is bare TiO2. And the reference for the spectrum marked as “Perovskite w. PCBA” is the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface. Therefore, the spectra shown in Fig. 2 represent the change of absorbance after spin-coating of the perovskite solution and DMF. The effects of organic contamination on the bare TiO2 surface and the absorbance due to PCBA-modification have already been eliminated. In the precursor solution of perovskite, DMF molecules which have carbonyl groups, are the most probable molecules to exhibit an infrared absorption band around 1655 cm−1. According to our previous report,14 DMF molecules in the perovskite bulk mostly evaporate during annealing. Otherwise, an absorption peak at 1643 cm−1, which represents DMF/PbI2 intermediates should be identified in the spectra of perovskite layers shown in Fig. 2. Thus, we determine that the peak at 1655 cm−1 is not due to the DMF in the perovskite bulk. Lin et al. reported that the DMF vapor readily adsorbs on TiO2 nanoparticles.26 It is most likely that the peak at 1655 cm−1 is due to the adsorption of DMF molecules on the TiO2 surface. In order to confirm that the peak of interest is due to the adsorbed DMF molecules, we collected an absorption spectrum for DMF molecules that were spin-coated on a bare TiO2 surface and dried in a N2 atmosphere for 24 hours. As shown in Fig. 2 (DMF on TiO2), a distinct peak at 1657 cm−1, which represents the CO stretching mode in DMF molecules, can be identified. We notice that the peak of the carbonyl group was red-shifted as compared to that of DMF liquid molecules (1670 cm−1),14 which indicates that the DMF molecules adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface. The ab-initio simulation results (gray lines in Fig. 2) also illustrate our inference that the CO stretching mode of the DMF molecules shifted to a lower frequency when they were bonded to the TiO2 surface. We thus attributed the peak at 1655 cm−1 to the DMF molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 2  The absorption spectra of DMF liquid and DMF adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, and perovskite layers on the TiO2 surface with and without PCBA modification. The reference spectra for the experimental data are the bare TiO2 surface (for DMF on TiO2, perovskite w.o. PCBA), and the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface (for perovskite w. PCBA). The asterisk marks indicate three dominant peaks of the pristine perovskite layer in the shown frequency region. The calculated spectra of a free DMF molecule and a DMF molecule adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (gray lines) are also included. 
We notice from Fig. 2 that the absorption peak at 1655 cm−1 on the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface is smaller in intensity than that on the bare TiO2 surface. This indicates that the adsorption of DMF molecules was inhibited due to the PCBA modification of the TiO2 surface. However, it should be noted that a small amount of DMF remained on the TiO2 surface even after the PCBA passivation. The sizes of PCBA and DMF molecules, estimated from simulated structures optimized using density functional theory (see Fig. S1†), are 1.2 and 0.4 nm, respectively. It therefore is probable that small DMF molecules go through spaces between adjacent PCBA molecules to adsorb on the TiO2 surface.
In Fig. 3, we show the C 1s XPS spectra of the bare TiO2 surface, DMF-adsorbed and PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3a, the spectrum of the bare TiO2 surface (black curve) shows two peaks at 285.8 eV and 289.7 eV which may be attributed to organic contaminations on the surface or carbon atoms incorporated onto the TiO2 surface during annealing. After adsorption of DMF, a new peak appeared at 286.7 eV in the C 1s spectrum. Meanwhile, the peak at 289.7 eV increased its intensity. We assign these two peaks to the methyl and carbonyl groups of DMF molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The dotted blue curve in Fig. 3a shows the XPS spectrum of the DMF-adsorbed TiO2 surface that we have collected after annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. We observed that there was no noticeable change in the spectral shape and intensity compared to the spectrum of the pre-annealed TiO2 surface (solid blue curve), implying that annealing at 150 °C hardly removes adsorbed DMF molecules from the TiO2 surface. This observation is consistent with the previous report that most of the adsorbed DMF molecules remained on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles even after the nanoparticles were heated up to 200 °C.26 Therefore, we can determine that the DMF molecules at the TiO2/perovskite or TiO2/PbI2 interface most likely remain after annealing. Indeed, the adsorbed DMF molecules were found in the annealed perovskite/TiO2 interface, as shown in Fig. 2.

The C 1s XPS spectra of the PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces before (solid) and after (dotted) DMF treatment are shown in Fig. 3b. After PCBA-modification, a strong peak at 285.4 eV, which can be attributed to the C–C bonding of the C60 moiety in PCBA molecules,27 appeared in the C 1s spectra, indicating the formation of the self-assembled PCBA layer on the TiO2 surface. We observed that DMF treatment did not noticeably change the spectral profile of the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface, which implies that the PCBA-modification significantly suppressed the adsorption of DMF molecules on the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface. This observation is consistent with our results of MIR-IRAS measurements. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the XPS spectra in the N 1s region shown in Fig. S2.†
In order to examine effects of the PCBA interfacial modification on the performance of planar PSCs, we fabricated PSCs on bare, DMF-adsorbed and PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces. A two-step method was used to deposit high-quality perovskite layers on the three different substrate surfaces. To avoid the absorption of solvent molecules on the bare TiO2 surface, we deposited PbI2 layers by thermally evaporating the PbI2 material at 250 °C in a vacuum chamber. The thickness of the PbI2 layers was about 155 nm according to a quartz crystal microbalance sensor. The PbI2 coated samples were then annealed in MAI vapor to form perovskite layers with a thickness of 300 nm.
We show in Fig. 4a the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing PSCs from each category. The average performance parameters and standard deviations are summarized in Table 1. No noticeable difference in the open circuit voltage (Voc) and maximum current density (Jmax) can be identified among the three different surface conditions, indicating that the surface conditions did not largely affect the generation and separation of excitons in the perovskite layer. We notice that the J–V curve of the PSCs fabricated on the DMF-adsorbed TiO2 surface exhibited a different profile from those of the cells fabricated on the bare or PCBA-modified surface. The short current density (Jsc) was smaller than the maximum point (Jmax). J–V curves exhibiting a similar bending shape have been previously observed in TiO2-based PSCs, and the up-bending of J–V curves was attributed to the accumulated charges at the interface and reduced built-in potential.28,29 Therefore, the adsorbed DMF molecules at the perovskite/TiO2 interface may play a negative role in charge transfer at the interface.

The series resistances of all fabricated cells which are approximated from the dark J–V curves are summarized in the inset of figure (b). The average value is calculated based on the results from at least 6 cells for each kind of solar cell.

When the PSCs were forward biased above 1 V, the slope of J–V curves varied due to the different surface states. The cell fabricated on the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface exhibited a much steeper slope than that fabricated on the DMF-adsorbed surface. Since the PSCs were fabricated in the same manner, the observed steeper slope that represents the smaller series resistance of the solar cells indicates that more efficient charge transfer occurred at the PCBA-modified interface than at the DMF-adsorbed interface. The smaller resistance also led to an improvement of the fill factor (FF) of the cells; the value of the FF increased from 0.61 for the cell on the bare TiO2 to 0.68 for the cells on the PCBA-modified TiO2. The efficiency of the cells increased from 11.8% to 13.8% accordingly.
Note that under light illumination both the contact resistance and the light-induced charge transfer/recombination at the interface may affect the slopes of J–V curves. In order to clearly show the effect of interfacial modifications on the contact resistance, we measured the J–V curves under the dark conditions. In Fig. 4b we show J–V curves collected under the dark conditions. The reverse currents are very small when the planar PSCs were reverse biased (see Fig. S3†). The shunt resistances for all the solar cells, which were derived from the slope of the J–V curve in the region of −0.5 to −0.3 V, were relatively large (about 20 kΩ cm2). This is an indication of low charge recombination and low leakage current between the electrodes. Due to the large shunt resistance, we can estimate the series resistance from the J–V curve without introducing a large error (see discussion in the ESI†). The calculated series resistances for the three different solar cells are summarized in the inset of Fig. 4b. Note that the value of the series resistance should reflect the value of the contact resistance at the interfaces. The average series resistance of the solar cells fabricated on the bare TiO2, the DMF-adsorbed and the PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces were 6 Ω cm2, 12.4 Ω cm2 and 4.2 Ω cm2, respectively. The resistance of the PCBA-modified cells is much smaller than that of the DMF-modified cells, indicating a smaller contact resistance and faster charge transfer at the PCBA-modified interface. It should also be noted that the contact resistance at the DMF-modified interface is larger than that at the perovskite/bare TiO2 interface, which implies that the adsorbed DMF molecules inhibited charge transfer at the interface. We can also notice that the extracted resistance and the efficiency of the samples with the DMF-modified interface showed a larger standard deviation than other types of samples. It is possible that DMF molecules only covered part of the TiO2 surface, and that the coverage of DMF on TiO2 surfaces varied from each other. A higher coverage of DMF on TiO2 may lead to a higher resistance at the interface. However, further experiments would be needed to confirm this speculation.
It has been reported that the electron affinities of DMF, PCBA (PCBM and C60 were used for approximation) and HO molecules are 13.6 meV, 2.6 eV (2.63 eV for PCBM and 2.68 eV for C60) and 1.8 eV, respectively.30–32 The PCBA molecules have the largest electron affinity due to the strong electron-accepting C60 group. The strong electron-accepting ability may help withdrawing the electron from the perovskite layer, leading to highly efficient charge transportation at the interface. On the other hand, the DMF molecule, which has the lowest electron affinity, is not likely to promote charge transfer. We suppose that the methyl-terminated DMF molecules act as the barrier against charge transfer and thereby increase the contact resistance at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Similar effects of surface modifiers with different terminating groups have been reported by Stubhan and co-workers.33 They found that modifying the Al-doped ZnO surface with C60-terminated molecules reduced the series resistance of organic solar cells, whereas, the methyl terminated alkane molecules at the organic/inorganic interface significantly increased the series resistance. Their results are consistent with our results observed on the TiO2 surface.
Fig. S4† shows the hysteresis of solar cells fabricated on the three different kinds of TiO2 surfaces. The device fabricated on the DMF-adsorbed surface demonstrated the most severe hysteresis, while the cell fabricated on the PCBA-modified surface showed a largely improved hysteresis. In Fig. S5,† we show the normalized power-output tracking data for each kind of device. We can see that the power output of the devices reached the highest point immediately after the light was switched on. Then the output decreased and stabilized during continuous illumination. After 140 seconds of illumination, the devices with bare, DMF-adsorbed and PCBA-modified interfaces maintained 49%, 18% and 65% of their maximum power output, respectively. The difference in hysteresis behaviour and stabilized power output can also be attributed to the different charge transferring properties at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, as we discussed above. In order to achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells, the adsorption of DMF molecules on the TiO2 surface should be suppressed as much as possible so as to enhance charge transfer at the perovskite/TiO2 interface.
Conclusions
We have investigated the effects of surface modification of the electrodes on the electrical performance of planar PSCs. We have examined the chemical state of the electrode surface by using surface-sensitive spectroscopic tools, MIR-IRAS and XPS. IRAS data showed that the widely used solvent for perovskite materials, DMF, readily adsorbs on the TiO2 electrode surface. The results of XPS measurements showed that annealing of the perovskite layer hardly removed the DMF molecules adsorbed at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Both the MIR-IRAS and XPS measurements confirmed that the adsorption of DMF molecules was suppressed by modifying the TiO2 surface with PCBA molecules before spin-coating the DMF-containing solution. By fabricating the planar PSCs on bare TiO2, DMF-modified and PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces using a dry-process, we demonstrated that the DMF molecules at the perovskite/TiO2 interface interfered with the charge transportation while the PCBA molecule reduced the contact resistance and promoted the change transfer at the interface. Therefore, the adsorption of DMF molecules at the perovskite/TiO2 interface should be avoided when fabricating planar PSCs. In addition, we demonstrated that modifying the TiO2 surface using molecules with high electron affinity, such as PCBA, is a simple and effective way to fabricate highly efficient planar PSCs.

 	Fig. 1  Structure of planar perovskite solar cells.	 

 	Fig. 2  The absorption spectra of DMF liquid and DMF adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, and perovskite layers on the TiO2 surface with and without PCBA modification. The reference spectra for the experimental data are the bare TiO2 surface (for DMF on TiO2, perovskite w.o. PCBA), and the PCBA-modified TiO2 surface (for perovskite w. PCBA). The asterisk marks indicate three dominant peaks of the pristine perovskite layer in the shown frequency region. The calculated spectra of a free DMF molecule and a DMF molecule adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (gray lines) are also included.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) XPS C 1s spectra of the bare TiO2 surface (black line), DMF on TiO2 before (blue line) and after (blue dotted line) annealing at 150 °C for 30 minutes. (b) XPS C 1s spectra of PCBA-modified TiO2 surfaces before (red line) and after (red dotted line) DMF treatment.	 

 	Fig. 4  
J–V characteristics of the best-performing PSCs from each category under illumination (a) and under the dark conditions (b). The black squares, blue triangles and red crosses represent different surface conditions at the perovskite/TiO2 interfaces. The J–V characteristics shown in these figures were reverse scan measured with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The series resistances of all fabricated cells which are approximated from the dark J–V curves are summarized in the inset of figure (b). The average value is calculated based on the results from at least 6 cells for each kind of solar cell.
