    , Accepted 7th December 2015First published on 16th December 2015AbstractPhotocatalytic processes to convert CO2 to useful products including CO and HCOOH are of particular interest as a means to harvest the power of the sun for sustainable energy applications. Herein, we report the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using iron catalysts and visible light generating varying ratios of synthesis gas. In most cases, either a 1:1 CO:H2 ratio was observed or the selectivity was skewed slightly towards CO with combined TONs reaching nearly 100. Operando FTIR studies revealed the favourable activity of FeBr2 as an iron precursor to generate the catalytically active species Fe(CO)3bpy. The Fe(CO)3bpy complex was then synthesized and successfully applied as a catalyst at various loadings providing almost 300 total TONs for syngas formation. This represents the highest activity reported thus far for an iron-based system in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Introduction
Fossil fuel consumption and depletion for global energy has brought about continuous increases in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). To help control the existing environmental implications of these rising CO2 levels on future generations and ensure the availability of resources for the chemical industry, carbon-neutral energy sources must be exploited.1 This includes not only the development of sustainable and alternative energy carriers, such as hydrogen or methanol, but also the conversion of CO2 into benign and useful derivatives. A possible means to tackle these issues is the use of sunlight, which is in high abundance compared to fossil fuels and is also a clean and renewable energy source. Much of the current research in this field has been directed towards the development of solar fuels through artificial photosynthesis, a process by which nature is able to produce energy from sunlight. Therefore, the photocatalytic reactions of water splitting and CO2 reduction have become highly sought-after processes as a means to confront these global energy concerns. Stemming from the pioneering studies of Lehn et al.,2–4 photocatalytic CO2 reduction employing homogeneous transition metal catalysts have gained increasing interest in the past decades.5–7 Most molecularly defined catalysts featuring noble metals including rhenium,6,8,9 ruthenium10–12 and more recently iridium13–15 have been well established for photochemical CO2 reduction while less expensive and more abundant first row transition metals like cobalt,5,16–19 manganese20 and nickel5,21,22 have only become more apparent in the literature in recent years (Fig. 1). Some current reports incorporating iron porphyrin complexes as catalysts23,24 have expanded upon the earlier findings of Neta and others.25–28 Thus, following the successful work of Savéant regarding electrocatalytic CO2 reduction utilizing functionalized iron phorphyrins,29,30 Bonin and Robert demonstrated the application of these complexes under photocatalytic conditions (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Recent non-noble metal-based photocatalytic systems demonstrating promising activity for carbon dioxide reduction. PS = photosensitizer. 
Initially employing near UV-irradiation achieved turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 30 for CO formation at 9 h and later incorporating an organic or Ir-based photosensitizer allowed for TONs up to 140 (55 h) using visible light. Although these values are among the highest reported to date for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO using noble metal-free complexes, these catalysts are not readily available and do not achieve turnover frequencies (TOFs) comparable to noble metal systems. However, we believe the capabilities of iron, an inexpensive and abundant metal, have only just begun to be realized in this photocatalytic process.
Previous work in our research group has focused on the development of non-noble metal catalysts for hydrogen generation, through alcohol and formic acid dehydrogenation processes31–33 as well as photocatalytic water splitting reactions.34–40 In this context, iron-carbonyl complexes were found to be particularly active for the proton reduction process, initially using an iridium photosensitizer, [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6 in the presence of additional phosphine ligand, P(3,5-(CF3)2Ph)3.35,37 An improved catalytic system was later established as the most active entirely non-noble metal system for photocatalytic proton reduction using an Fe catalyst and Cu-based photosensitizers.36,38 Both the initial and latter catalyst generations featured the trinuclear iron complex [Fe3(CO)12] (1) as the water-reduction pre-catalyst. Aiming to expand the capabilities of non-noble metals in photocatalysis for energy applications, we turned our attention to CO2 photoreduction employing this simple and readily available iron complex.
Results and discussion
Reaction parameters were judiciously chosen based on previous photocatalytic studies of CO2 reduction,5,41 and screened for optimal activity and selectivity. The initial conditions consisted of the aforementioned trinuclear iron complex 1 in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 (PS1) or [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6 (PS2) as the photosensitizer, triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial electron and proton donor, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent (NMP:TEOA = 5:1, v/v). All reactions were performed under 1 atm of carbon dioxide using visible light irradiation (400–700 nm, 2.5 W output) for 5 h. Interestingly, when PS1 was used as the photosensitizer, the resulting products in the head space of the reaction vessel consisted of both CO and H2 gases in an approximate 1:1 ratio (i.e. syngas), as observed by use of calibrated GC analysis (Table 1, entry 1). Considering that the redox active 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) ligand (L1) can serve as an electron reservoir and therefore help to promote proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions,42 5 equiv. of bpy were applied under these conditions in an effort to improve catalytic performance. Although the use of bpy ligand did not skew the ratio of the synthesis gas towards either component, the total TON demonstrated a slightly increase (Table 1, entry 2), which led to all further screening experiments incorporating a redox active ligand. In addition, when the reaction mixture was analyzed using a capillary electrophoresis system, 103 μmol of formate were detected. However, when the same experiment was performed in the absence of iron catalyst 1, a similar amount (96 μmol of formate) was measured. This indicates that the formation of formate arises mainly from the ruthenium photosensitizer PS1, which is in agreement with a previous report by Lehn et al.,4 where complex PS1, acting as both photosensitizer and catalyst, was used for the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid.

With the aim of improving the overall activity of the photocatalytic system, several nitrogenated ligands bearing different substituents as well as structurally related variants were then evaluated. Although comparable TONs for CO formation were observed using either 6 or 3 μmol of Fe (Table 1, entries 2 vs. 3), the synthesis gas composition was altered providing >50% CO when the lower loading was used. Continuing with 3 μmol Fe using fluorenone ligand L2 gave similar results as bpy (Table 1, entry 4). The other bpy derivatives applied, however, did not provide improved product selectivity or catalytic performance (Table 1, entries 5–9). Ligands L8 and L9, which feature 1,4-diaza motifs analogous to bpy, were among the least active in this series (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Further screening reactions where photosensitizer PS1 was replaced with PS2 (Table 1, entries 12–15), afforded a favourable CO selectivity in certain cases (Table 1, entries 12 and 14), but also gave lower amounts of reduced products. Interestingly, employing conditions previously reported for our proton reduction chemistry (Table 1, entry 15),37 which includes phosphine L11, proved to completely suppress the CO formation process and solely favour H2 generation. Notably, the catalytic activity suffers in the absence of any bpy source (Table 1, entry 13), from either PS1 or added free ligand, which means that the presence of such a ligand is crucial for the formation of the catalytically active species (vide infra). Taking into account the necessity for both the Ru-complex PS1 and additional bpy to promote CO formation, we proceeded to assess the influence of other reaction components including the iron source, light intensity and various solvent/electron–proton donor combinations.
Substituting the trinuclear Fe(0) catalyst 1 with readily available Fe(II) sources resulted in comparable quantities for CO (Table 2, entries 1–2), demonstrating the applicability of other iron precursors in this reaction. Turning our attention to the influence of solvent(s), initially the addition of 10% v/v water, which has been found to have a beneficial effect in photocatalytic CO2 reduction,4 modestly improved the CO selectivity (>60%) while maintaining the corresponding TONs (Table 2, entry 4). Triethylamine (Et3N) was an inferior sacrificial reductant compared to TEOA, although 10% v/v water in addition provided nearly identical results to those of the standard conditions (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). Replacing NMP with tetrahydrofuran (THF) demonstrated promising activity for the system but THF/Et3N combinations proved to be detrimental providing only negligible amounts of reduced products (Table 2, entries 7 and 8). Varying the light intensity showed that 1.5 W or greater maintained catalytic activity while 0.5 W was insufficient (Table 2, entries 9–11). To ensure that the observed photocatalytic activity in our system was not the result of residual UV light coming from our light source, a Xe lamp set at the maximum 1.2 W output setting with a UV cutoff filter (>420 nm) was used, which still provided acceptable activity (Table 2, entry 12). This corroborates that the catalytic activity is due entirely to visible light. With respect to the quantity of L1 added to the reaction, using either 2.5, 5 or 10 equiv. had no significant effect on the overall TON values. Thus, we opted to use either 2.5 or 5 equiv. of bpy in all subsequent reactions. Fig. 2 shows the photocatalytic formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen as a function of irradiation time. After 4 h, the reaction reached a plateau in which additional CO and H2 formation were minimal, suggesting that this is the point of maximum conversion. Allowing the reaction to proceed for 18 h did not provide any additional increase in reduced products beyond that of 5 h, which further indicated that the catalytic system was no longer active after this time. However, upon further addition of PS1 (25 μmol) to the reaction at 5 h followed by ∼1 h degassing with CO2 reactivated the photocatalytic system as significantly increased quantities of syngas were produced (181 total TONs, 1.0:1.5 CO:H2 content). An analogous experiment in which 1 (3 μmol) and L1 were added demonstrated a modest reactivation with 11 TONs H2 and 4 TONs CO. These results suggest that the observed catalyst lifetime is likely more dependent upon photosensitizer deactivation than that of the Fe catalyst.

 Fig. 2  Photocatalytic formation of CO (red) and H2 (blue) as a function of irradiation time (400–700 nm, 2.5 W output), using a CO2-saturated NMP/TEOA (5:1 v/v, 15 mL) solution containing 1 (2 μmol), PS1 (25 μmol) and L1 (15 μmol). The average of duplicate experiments is shown for each data point. 
In addition to productivity (TON), quantum yield measurements provide important information about the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Thus, a chemical actinometer was used to determine the number of incident photons when monochromatic light (440 nm) was employed to drive the photocatalysis (see ESI† for details). As shown in Table 3, varying the power from 0.50 to 0.07 W significantly improved the quantum yield from 5.2 to 15.1%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the calculated quantum yield here is the highest reported to date for any homogeneous catalytic system using a non-noble-metal carbon dioxide reduction catalyst.41 As expected from the inferior activity of PS2 observed in the ligand screen (Table 1), when further measurements using PS2 instead of PS1 were performed, appreciably lower quantum yields were observed, i.e. 2.4 and 4.3% at 0.5 and 0.15 W, respectively (Table S1†).

In order to gain further insight into the underlying factors for the observed photocatalytic performance, we investigated the catalytically relevant species in solution by operando FTIR spectroscopy. Specifically, when a CO2-saturated solution of NMP/TEOA (5:1, v/v) containing PS1, catalyst 1 and L1, was continuously monitored during irradiation with visible light, two key iron-containing species were detected (Fig. S4†). In accordance with previously reported studies on photocatalytic proton reduction using the iron catalyst 1,35 one of the observed species was assigned to the anionic complex [HFe(CO)4]− (2), a complex previously characterized and calibrated by FTIR in our group. The immediate formation of complex 2 was observed after irradiation (Fig. 3, top), which initially decreased and then gradually increased in concentration over the 5 h. More interestingly, a second iron complex was identified as [Fe(CO)3(bpy)]43 (3), which emerged during the first 30 minutes, reaching a maximum absorbance within the first hour before slowly decreasing.44 Thus, iron complexes 2 and 3 demonstrated an inverse relationship in terms of their concentration profiles, which suggests that the consumption of one leads to the formation of the other. However, based on the redox properties previously reported for 2,37 it seems unlikely that such a complex is acting as a mediator for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide considering that its reduction potential is too high (−1.73 V vs. NHE) compared to the reductive power of the reduced state of either PS1 (−1.08 V vs. NHE)45 or PS2 (−1.09 V vs. NHE).46 Hence, we conclude that complex 3 constitutes the catalytic active species formed in situ. In contrast, when FeBr2 (4) was used instead of 1, almost entirely iron complex 3 was observed upon irradiation while only a small amount of 2 was detected over the course of the reaction (Fig. 3, bottom); a similar inverse correlation was also evident here. From these data, it is inferred that 4 is a more suitable precursor for forming 3. Thus, we turned our attention to this iron salt in performing further photocatalytic trials.
 Fig. 3  Concentration and absorption profiles of iron-containing species identified during 5 h irradiation of a CO2-saturated NMP/TEOA (5:1 v/v, 15 mL) solution containing 1 (2 μmol, top) or 4 (6 μmol, bottom), PS1 (25 μmol) and L1 (30 μmol). 

Chart 1 shows the results from the photocatalytic CO2 reduction using 4 as the catalyst precursor. These experiments revealed improved catalytic performance at lower loadings. For instance, 1 μmol of 4 in the presence of L1 using either PS1 or PS2 both gave 72 TON for CO and 55 or 43 TON for H2, respectively. Remarkably, total TONs of >200 could be achieved at the lowest applied loading of 0.5 μmol with a CO:H2 ratio of 1.0:1.3. In contrast, analogous experiments at lower loadings (<3 μmol Fe) of 1 provided neither increased activities nor reproducible results.
 Chart 1  FeBr2-catalyzed CO2 photoreduction. 
Following the data provided by operando FTIR measurements, an authentic sample of 3 was synthesized using an adapted literature procedure47 and subsequently applied as a pre-catalyst under the standard photocatalytic conditions. Comparable activities to those of the trinuclear complex 1 were observed using either photosensitizer (Table 4). However, there were no appreciable differences between catalytic trials performed in the presence or absence of additional L1 (Table 4, entries 1 vs. 2 and 3 vs. 4). Furthermore, extending the irradiation time from 5 to 16 h did not provide any significant increase in the quantity of reduced products, suggesting that the catalytic system is no longer active after 5 h in this case as well. Considering the increased activity for syngas formation observed under these conditions, the desired ratio of hydrogen and carbon monoxide could be regulated to a certain extent according to the chosen photosensitizer and catalyst loading. Thus, we were able to achieve high TON values greater than 250 for syngas formation, representing the highest activity reported thus far for an iron-based system in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Based on both the in situ FTIR studies and results of catalytic experiments presented (vide supra) as well as previous reports on photocatalytic CO2 reduction, we propose the following reaction mechanism for the iron-mediated CO formation process (Scheme 1). In view of the extensive studies from our group on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the context of iron catalysis, a proposed mechanism for that pathway has not been included here.34,36–38 Under the reaction conditions, the trinuclear iron pre-catalyst 1 is converted to the anionic iron monomer 2, which in the presence of L1 forms complex 3. This step is likely to be reversible as the reaction profile in Fig. 3 suggested interconversion between 2 and 3. To enter the catalytic cycle, 3 undergoes CO-ligand loss forming a putative FeII 16-electron species (3′) that can accommodate CO2-adduct formation and a proton-coupled electron transfer. This leads to an FeI CO2H-containing species (3′′) that releases water via a second proton-coupled electron transfer and regenerates 3, a proposed resting state of the cycle.

Experimental section
Materials and methods
Anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and stored under an Ar atmosphere. Triethanolamine (TEOA) was degassed and kept under Ar prior to use. CO2 tanks (>99.998%) were purchased from Linde and used as received. [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6 (PS2) was synthesized according to a known literature procedure48 and Fe(CO)3bpy was synthesized using an adapted literature protocol (see ESI† for details).47 [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O (PS1) as well as all other reagents were of reagent-grade quality and were used as received. Analyses of the headspace of the photocatalytic reactions were performed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector (Agilent Technologies 6890 N, carboxen 1000, external calibration). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Fourier 300 instrument by using the residual solvent signal as an internal standard. Analyses of the reaction mixture liquid phase was performed using a capillary electrophoresis (Agilent Technologies, capillary 75 μm/40 cm, 300 μA current) equipped with a DAD detector (400 μm). The analysis temperature was maintained at 25 °C and the method employed an organic acids buffer (Agilent) at pH 5.6.
Photocatalytic reactions
A double-walled temperature-controlled 100 mL reaction vessel was evacuated and refilled with Ar three times followed by an additional three cycles using CO2. PS1 or PS2, the corresponding Fe complex (as a solid or solution in NMP/TEOA) and 15 mL of a 5:1 mixture of NMP/TEOA were then added. Prior to irradiation, the reaction mixture was bubbled with CO2 for 30 min. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a thermostat. The solution was irradiated using an Hg-lamp (Lumatec Superlite 400, output 2.5 W), equipped with a 400–700 nm filter. The reaction vessel was irradiated through a plain borosilicate-glass wall. The gaseous reaction products H2 and CO were analyzed using calibrated GC and HCOO− in the liquid phase was quantified by use of capillary electrophoresis techniques.
Operando FTIR measurements
Reactions were performed as described above for a typical photocatalytic setup and incorporated continuous FTIR monitoring. Operando FTIR spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector. The optics was purged with nitrogen. The reaction was carried out under argon in a vitreous reaction vessel. The reaction solution was irradiated by a Hg-vapor lamp (Lumatec Superlite 400, 400–700 nm filter) and continuously circulated by a micro gear pump via capillary tubes through an IR-transmission cell (pathlength = 0.1 mm, window material = CaF2). The reaction temperature was maintained at 25 °C with a thermostat. This experimental operando FTIR setup allows for the drawing of conclusions between activity and the IR absorption of the catalysts. The pure component spectra and the associated concentration profiles (chapter IR spectra) were extracted with an algorithm based on factor analysis.49
Conclusions
In summary, we have disclosed our initial efforts to extend the capabilities of iron in the context of energy-related processes, specifically photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Building from previous studies of photocatalytic water splitting in our group, we were able to apply the commercially available trinuclear iron complex [Fe3(CO)12] (1) as the catalyst, a Ru-based photosensitizer (PS1) and the 2,2′-bipyridine ligand (L1) as an additive in the presence of visible light irradiation for the conversion of CO2 to varying ratios of synthesis gas. In most cases, either a 1:1 CO:H2 ratio was observed or the selectivity was skewed slightly towards CO with combined TONs reaching nearly 100. Several different reaction parameters were evaluated, revealing that NMP/TEOA mixtures as well as added bpy ligand were essential for optimal activity. Varying the applied light intensity, using alternative bpy derivatives or replacing Ru with an Ir photosensitizer (PS2) all proved to either have no influence on or be detrimental to the overall catalytic activity of the system. Conversion experiments showed a complete loss in activity between 4 and 5 h irradiation time given that reduced products were no longer being formed. The next part of this study incorporated quantum yield determination in which a combined value for synthesis gas of 15.1% was calculated to be the highest for this system at 440 nm and 0.07 W of light. To gain some insight into the active species in solution, FTIR in situ investigations were performed. Reactions initiated with [Fe3(CO)12] (1) or FeBr2 (4) demonstrated the immediate formation of two iron species identified as [HFe(CO)4]− (2) and [Fe(CO)3(bpy)] (3) (see Fig. 3), the former suggested to be catalytically inactive and the latter active for the photocatalytic process. Performing further reactions using FeBr2 at decreased Fe loadings (3.0 to 0.5 μmol) demonstrated significantly higher activity using this iron source. Complex 3 was then synthesized and successfully applied as a catalyst at various loadings providing almost 300 total TONs (0.25 μmol Fe) for syngas formation. This represents the highest activity reported thus far for an iron-based system in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Considering the promising activity we have observed using catalyst 3, further development of iron as well as entirely non-noble metal catalytic systems in the photoreduction of CO2 will be reported in due course.
