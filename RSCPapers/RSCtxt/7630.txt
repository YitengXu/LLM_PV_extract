1. Introduction
The rediscovery of black phosphorus (BP) in 2014 added a new category of in-plane anisotropic materials to the 2D materials family.1–7 Different from conventional 2D materials with in-plane isotropy such as graphene and MoS2, BP possesses an in-plane low symmetry structure,8,9 inducing the in-plane anisotropic physical properties.9–14 For example, BP shows a higher mobility and conductance along the armchair direction than that along the zigzag direction.10 The in-plane linear dichroism of BP has also been verified.15 Inspired by the unique in-plane anisotropies,16,17 BP has shown promise in a variety of applications including electronic anisotropy-related synaptic electronics18 and orientation-dependent diodes,19 as well as optical anisotropy-based photodetection of polarized light.15 Besides BP, other anisotropic layered materials have been newly discovered including binary IV–VI materials such as GeS and GeSe with BP-analogue structures;20–24 ReS2 and ReSe2, belonging to transition-metal dichalcogenides, with metal–metal bonds9,17,25,26 and some ternary compounds such as Ta2NiSe5, Ta2NiS5, and TaIrTe4.16,27,28
Among these low-symmetry 2D materials, anisotropic Ge-based binary materials have recently emerged as a new research hot topic in this field.20,22,29–40 We divide these materials into two categories: group IV–VI chalcogenides (GeS, GeSe, GeS2, and GeSe2) and group IV–V compounds (GeP, GeAs, and GeAs2) (Fig. 1).16 They are attractive for several reasons: (i) simple binary and earth-abundant compositions, especially for Ge, that are quite close to Sn in terms of the earth abundance;41 (ii) good stability, superior to BP, that is easily oxidized under ambient conditions;36,42 (iii) highly anisotropic physical properties along two principle axes; (iv) wide coverage of bandgaps ranging from 0.51 eV to 3.71 eV (Table 1),34,36,38,40,43–45 allowing for spectral photodetection ranging from the infrared to ultraviolet region. All the features make these Ge-based binary materials useful for optoelectronic applications.

In this feature article, we review recent advances in the study of in-plane anisotropic 2D Ge-based binary materials. We begin with a brief overview of anisotropic structural, electrical, and optical properties of these anisotropic Ge-based binary materials. Then we discuss some optoelectronic applications that are related to their in-plane anisotropy including polarization-sensitive photodetection and polarization-based all-optical switches. Finally, we make a summary of this review and provide practical advice for the future development of these Ge-based materials.
2. Anisotropic structure
Since the physical properties of a material closely depend on its structure, we begin by summarizing the structures of these 2D Ge-based binary materials to understand the origin of their in-plane anisotropic properties. This section contains two parts. The first part introduces the anisotropic crystal structures in Ge-based materials; the second part is about the in-plane anisotropic band structures.
2.1 Anisotropic crystal structure
The crystal structures of 2D Ge-based binary materials can be classified into two types according to their common phases: orthorhombic phase for GeS, GeSe and GeAs2; monoclinic phase for GeS2, GeSe2, GeP and GeAs.16Fig. 1 shows the side views of the crystal structures in these Ge-based binary materials, and Table 1 summarizes the information about the crystal systems, space groups, bandgaps and lattice parameters of these Ge-based binary materials.16,20,32,34–36,38,40,43–47
We now systematically discuss the crystal structures inducing the in-plane anisotropic phenomenon in 2D Ge-based materials, combined with the information provided by Table 1. Both GeS and GeSe present an orthorhombic structure with the Pnma space group. One Ge atom is connected by three S or Se atoms, presenting a ridge structure along the in-plane zigzag direction, while along the armchair direction, a puckered structure is observed (Fig. 1).21,22,48 This non-equal structure is also reflected by the different lattice constants along the two in-plane crystal orientations. Taking GeSe for example, the lattice parameters along the two in-plane directions are 3.83 Å and 4.39 Å, respectively. GeAs2 adopts a BP-analogue crystal structure with the Pbam 55 space group. There are many (Ge2As3)n pentagonal tubes corresponding to the in-plane a-axis crystal orientation. As atoms connect above tubes along the in-plane b-axis direction, resulting in its in-plane low symmetry structure.40
Different from GeS and GeSe, GeS2 and GeSe2 usually display a monoclinic crystal phase. Along different in-plane crystal orientations, there are two connection modes of GeX4 tetrahedra (X = S, Se): corner-sharing mode and edge-sharing mode. This leads to the low in-plane lattice symmetry.44 As for the crystal structure of GeP and GeAs, one Ge atom is connected by three P or As atoms and another Ge atom. Two different categories of Ge–Ge bonding modes which are parallel or vertical to the plane are presented (Fig. 1). Different bonding types along different directions offer the origin of the anisotropic structure. The lattice constants of GeP are a = 15.19 Å, b = 3.63 Å, and c = 9.19 Å while a = 15.52 Å, b = 3.78 Å, c = 9.46 Å for GeAs.45,49
The in-plane crystal structures of these 2D Ge-based binary materials are usually characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Zhai et al. conducted HRTEM measurement on as-synthesized few-layer GeSe flakes (Fig. 2a).29 The measured lattice spacing of 0.420 nm belongs to (001) while 0.384 nm belongs to (010), experimentally demonstrating its in-plane anisotropic crystal structure (Fig. 2b).29 The HRTEM image of an exfoliated GeS flake denotes the different in-plane crystal lattice fringes that are 0.44 nm along the armchair direction and 0.37 nm along the zigzag direction (Fig. 2c).50 The low-magnification image and its corresponding HRTEM image confirm the in-plane anisotropic crystal structure of GeAs2 (Fig. 2d and e).40 This microscopy measurement can further be used as an original and reliable method to obtain the in-plane crystalline directions in these anisotropic 2D Ge-based binary materials.9

2.2 Anisotropic band structure
The in-plane low symmetry of 2D Ge-based binary materials then leads to the anisotropic band structure, and finally influences physical properties, especially the electrical and optical properties of these materials. Fig. 3a–c show the calculated band structures of these 2D Ge-based binary materials along different crystal directions, including GeSe, GeS and GeAs2.35,40,51 Along different in-plane crystal directions, different valence and conduction band curves indicate a high degree of in-plane anisotropy in the band structures of these Ge-based binary materials.

This anisotropic band dispersion can be experimentally confirmed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique has been considered as a useful method to obtain valence band information in 2D semiconductors such as SnSe.52,53 The band structure of GeSe corresponding to different in-plane crystal orientations has been probed by combining with ARPES measurements. According to the ARPES results displayed in the colour mapping (Fig. 3d), the apparent difference in band dispersions along the two crystal orientations can be observed. The constant energy contours (CECS) belonging to the valence bands in Fig. 3e also manifest the valence band structure with in-plane anisotropy in GeSe.51 The combination of experimental and theoretical investigations of the anisotropic band dispersion in Ge-based binary materials provides a solid foundation for the following study of in-plane anisotropic electrical and optical properties.
3. Anisotropic electrical properties
The anisotropic band structure directly induces the anisotropic electrical properties of these low-symmetry Ge-based binary materials, according to the equation m* = ℏ/∂2E/∂k2. In this equation, m* denotes the carrier effective mass, which is regarded as a common parameter to estimate the electrical properties.54Fig. 4a and b show the calculated angle-dependent effective masses belonging to electrons and holes in GeSe. For both electrons and holes, the carrier effective masses exhibit in-plane anisotropy, indicating the possibility of anisotropic electrical properties including conductance and mobility.54

The electrical anisotropy of these 2D Ge-based binary materials is experimentally verified using angle-resolved conductance (ARC) measurement. Combining with ARC measurement, Zhu et al. found that the value of electrical conductance in GeSe altered with the change of in-plane directions (Fig. 4c), reaching the maximum and minimum along the armchair and zigzag orientation, respectively.55 Zhai et al. also observed the angle-dependent electrical performance in GeSe with higher mobility corresponding to the in-plane armchair crystal direction, demonstrating an anisotropic mobility ratio of 1.85.21 Furthermore, another Ge-based binary material, GeP, was discovered to show an in-plane anisotropic electrical characteristic, matching well with the calculated result of GeP.38 Ajayan et al. studied the electrical anisotropy of GeAs with a thickness of ∼11 nm (Fig. 4d).39 They found that the maximum mobility was along one in-plane direction (zigzag) and the minimum mobility was along another in-plane crystal direction (armchair). The calculated in-plane anisotropic mobility could reach a high ratio of ∼4.6, significantly higher than the ratio of BP.10,39,56,57 Duan et al. also observed a similar ratio of 4.8 by conducting angle-dependent mobility measurement on the GeAs flake.45 The unique electrical anisotropies of these 2D Ge-based materials provide a potential opportunity in the application of in-plane anisotropy-related electronics.45
4. Anisotropic optical properties
Besides the anisotropic electrical property, the anisotropic structure also renders the origin of anisotropic optical properties. For anisotropic 2D materials, anisotropic band dispersion gives rise to the different rates of optical transition along different crystal axes, causing anisotropic optical absorption.15,51,58 Moreover, other anisotropic optical properties including anisotropic optical reflection and refraction also exist. Fig. 5 gives the theoretical result of optical absorption, reflection and refraction along different crystal directions in GeSe and GeS, presenting the anisotropic phenomenon.35,51 To further characterize the optical anisotropy from the perspective of experiments, some novel measurements have been adopted by researchers. In this section, we briefly review the recent progress in different characterization methods to investigate the anisotropic optical properties of such 2D Ge-based binary materials.

4.1 Polarization-resolved absorption spectroscopy (PRAS)
Polarization-resolved absorption spectroscopy (PRAS) has been widely employed to investigate the anisotropic absorption in low-symmetry materials, which is also regarded as an effective method to demonstrate the feasibility of in-plane anisotropic materials in the application of polarization-related photodetection.16,34,59–62 As shown in Fig. 6a, the intensity of absorbance under different polarization states of incident light can be obtained through PRAS measurement.16,35 The incident polarization is changed by rotating a half-wave plate at a fixed step angle.

Recently, Wei et al. reported the PRAS result of GeSe with the spectral range from 400 to 950 nm.34 The obvious anisotropy of absorption was observed in Fig. 6b by changing the polarization angle at steps of 30°, indicating the linear dichroism in GeSe. The corresponding absorption ratios under different wavelengths were different, where the value can reach 3.02 for the wavelength of 808 nm and only 1.09 for 532 nm, as displayed in Fig. 6c, d and e.34 The PRAS experiment employed in GeS at a step angle of 30° shows different absorbance corresponding to different in-plane crystal orientations, verifying the optical absorption anisotropy in GeS.35 From another PRAS result shown in Fig. 6f, it can be further manifested that GeS possesses polarization-sensitive absorption and anisotropic absorption edges.22 Wei et al. investigated the in-plane polarization-related absorption of GeAs using PRAS. The absorption ratios, such as 1.42 for 830 nm, extracted from the spectra indicated the absorption anisotropy of GeAs.46 Other Ge-based binary materials were also demonstrated to present polarization-dependent absorption.32,36,44
4.2 Polarization-resolved optical microscopy (PROM)
Polarization-resolved optical microscopy (PROM) has been utilized to study the birefringence phenomenon in 2D materials with low symmetry (Fig. 7a).63,64 For an anisotropic medium, complex indices of refraction (N = n + ik) are able to be used to express the light propagation. Here, birefringence (Δn), named as the difference for real components of N, can be considered as an effective parameter to characterize optical anisotropy.65 According to the birefringence phenomenon usually existing in the anisotropic materials, PROM measurement can offer a simple method to distinguish the anisotropic materials. Moreover, we can obtain the information of crystal direction through PROM measurement.63 The specific experimental process in PROM measurement is introduced here; the PROM images are recorded when rotating the tested sample at a fixed angle under the circumstance that the angle between the incident polarizer and the analyzer is 90°.51 For anisotropic materials, the output polarized state may alter when rotating the sample. Taking BP—a representative in-plane anisotropic material—as an example, the output state is the same as that of incident light when incident polarization is along the crystal direction and may be different from that of incident light in other cases, leading to alteration of light intensity collected by the analyzer and angle-related brightness in PROM images.63

The optical anisotropy of GeSe and GeS using PROM was reported recently. As shown in Fig. 7b, obvious optical contrast change can be visualized when changing the angle of the multilayer GeSe. The images with the lowest and highest brightness are obtained when the incident polarization is along and at an angle of 45° to the crystal direction, respectively.51 The GeS flake also demonstrated a similar phenomenon.35 These results indicated the birefringence in GeSe and GeS.
4.3 Azimuth-dependent reflectance difference microscopy (ADRDM)
Azimuth-dependent reflectance difference microscopy (ADRDM) possesses the ability to detect the normalized difference of reflectance along two in-plane perpendicular orientations that provides researchers with a simple way to characterize optical anisotropy and determine the in-plane crystal orientation without destroying the measured materials.39,51,61,66 The normalized reflectance difference (ΔR) can be expressed by the following equation:  
The value N(θ) related to the intensity of reflectance can be expressed as:  where Rx and Ry refer to the reflectance intensities along the x and y axes, and θ represents the angle of polarized incident light. According to the above equation, we draw a conclusion that N(θ) would change periodically under different angles for materials with in-plane anisotropy.
As shown in Fig. 8a, the main component parts for ADRDM measurement are the light source (providing the incident light), the liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR), the polarizer (LCVR and polarizer are applied to achieve the different polarized direction of incident light), a charge coupled device (CCD, used to record ADRDM signals and images), and the objective lens (focusing light).39,51,61

Our group recently adopted ADRDM to characterize the optical anisotropy of several anisotropic Ge-based binary materials.31,35,44,51 For example, Fig. 8b presents the ADRDM result of multilayer GeSe that depicts the values of N(θ) for different incident angles θ. It can be obtained that the recorded value N(θ) exhibited a periodical change, where the value reached the maximum value at ∼175° and minimum at ∼85°. Moreover, ADRDM can also be considered as an in situ image tool to display optical anisotropy. Hence, the ADRDM imaging measurement was conducted on the GeSe flake presented in Fig. 8c. From the ADRDM images in Fig. 8d, it can be acquired that the colors of the images also change periodically.51 Therefore, the ADRDM results indicated the optical anisotropy of GeSe, wherein GeS (Fig. 8e), GeSe2, and GeS2 flakes also showed a similar phenomenon during the ADRDM measurements.31,35,44 Moreover, Ajayan et al. reported the optical anisotropy of multilayer GeAs using ADRDM, as shown in Fig. 8f. They found that the tested GeAs sample presented the maximum and minimum values of N(θ) at 90° and 0°.39
4.4 Anisotropic nonlinear optical measurements
When a medium is in a high-intensity electromagnetic field, the nonlinear light response may exist, which is usually considered to come from the nonresonant motion belonging to the bound electrons.67 To date, the research on nonlinear optical properties has been an important constituent part of optics, being promising in the application of modern optical devices.68 The common nonlinear phenomena are four-wave mixing, second harmonic generation, third-harmonic generation and so on.67 Recently, the nonlinear properties of 2D materials have attracted wide attention for their potential applications in micro and nano nonlinear optical devices, while some nonlinear optical effects such as nonlinear absorption and second-harmonic generation in 2D materials have been reported.68–72 For in-plane anisotropic 2D materials, the unique nonlinear optical anisotropy is also manifested, similar to that of linear optical anisotropy.73,74 In this part, we will introduce some measurements that demonstrate the anisotropic nonlinear phenomena in 2D Ge-based binary materials.
Third-harmonic generation belongs to third-order nonlinearity, which can be observed in a few 2D materials.68,75–77 BP, as a representative of low-symmetry materials, has been discovered to exhibit anisotropic third-harmonic generation.78 To explore the anisotropic nonlinear optics in GeSe, Yang et al. implemented angle-dependent third-harmonic generation measurement (ADTHGM).68 In this measurement, they made the incident beam reach the surface of the tested GeSe (Fig. 9a) after going through a linear polarizer and a half-wave plate, then investigating the relationship between third-harmonic signal and the polarization state of the incident beam. As the result exhibited in Fig. 9b, the third-harmonic response shows angle-dependent characteristics, which results from the in-plane anisotropic crystal structure in GeSe. What's more, through the third-harmonic image of GeSe under incident radially or azimuthally polarized light, the crystal direction is able to be determined directly. The measured third-harmonic images and corresponding intensities of the GeSe flake are provided in Fig. 9c–f.68

Another anisotropic nonlinear optical effect, anisotropic nonlinear absorption, of multilayer GeS, has also been reported through polarization-dependent I-scan measurement (PDISM).79 In the measurement, graphene was put on GeS to avoid the damage of GeS under incident light. Fig. 9g and h provide I-scan results when the incident polarized light is parallel to the armchair and zigzag direction. For the condition that the incident polarization is along the armchair direction, the value of normalized transmittance increases on increasing the incident intensity at first, followed by showing a trend of being unchanged. This is named as saturable absorption. In contrast, when the incident direction is parallel to the zigzag direction, a different trend can be observed, presenting reverse saturated-absorption.79
5. Anisotropy-based optoelectronic applications
The above in-plane anisotropic optical properties of 2D Ge-based binary materials endow them with great potential for some novel optoelectronic applications, which are otherwise impossible with in-plane isotropic 2D materials. In this section, we review the latest progress in anisotropy-based optoelectronic applications of these 2D Ge-based binary materials including polarization-sensitive photodetection and polarization-based all-optical switches.
5.1 Polarization-sensitive photodetection
The photodetection of polarized light has been a significant research field considering the contribution in special optical applications. As more and more in-plane anisotropic 2D materials are discovered and proved to present anisotropic absorption characteristics, their applications in polarization-sensitive photodetection are promising considering the merits of their intrinsic sensitivity for polarized light, simple fabrication process, and extraordinary mechanical properties.34,58 As a common low-symmetry material, BP has been reported to be appropriate for application in polarization-sensitive photodetection. The photodetectors based on BP present high sensitivity for the polarized light detection with a wide bandwidth of ∼400 nm to 3750 nm.15 Unfortunately, the stability of BP is an issue remaining to be solved.80
As a vital member of low-symmetry 2D materials, Ge-based binary materials with high stability have therefore become promising alternative materials for polarized light detection. Besides the anisotropic in-plane structure, the wide range of the bandgaps of these materials also offers the opportunity for broadband photodetection of polarized light.34,36,38,40,43–45 The information about the bandgaps and the wavelengths of polarized light detection of these Ge-based materials is provided in Table 1. Among them, GeAs presents a bandgap of 0.57 eV in bulk and 1.66 eV in monolayer thickness. Considering the small bandgap in the bulk and multilayer GeAs, Duan et al. reported GeAs-based infrared photodetectors, which showed a high photoresponsivity reaching 6 A W−1 and rapid photoresponse under the irradiation of a 1.6 μm laser.45 This high performance renders great opportunity for fabricating GeAs-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors that detect infrared polarized light.
Wei et al. investigated the application of GeAs in the detection of visible and near-infrared polarized light.46Fig. 10a shows a schematic diagram of a GeAs polarized photodetector. They demonstrated that GeAs-based photodetectors with ∼34 nm thickness and an effective channel length of ∼8.6 μm displayed angle-dependent photoresponse under polarized laser light of 520 nm and 830 nm from different incident directions (Fig. 10b). The dichroic ratios, defined as the ratio values between the maximum and minimum photocurrent, of GeAs polarization-sensitive photodetectors under 520 nm and 830 nm were ∼1.49 and ∼4.4, respectively. Interestingly, the polarization directions of the polar plots of angle-dependent photocurrents under the above two wavelengths are different, which can be attributed to the altered direction of maximum absorption when the wavelength changes from 830 nm to 520 nm. Furthermore, to characterize the anisotropic photoresponse of the GeAs photodetector more directly, they measured the polarization-dependent photocurrent mapping under 520 nm and 830 nm light (Fig. 10c and d), respectively.46

GeSe-based near-infrared and visible polarization-sensitive photodetectors have also been reported by several groups. Wei et al. fabricated polarized photodetection devices based on GeSe flakes with ∼13 layers.34 They found that the photocurrents for different polarized directions of incident light at 532, 638, and 808 nm showed two-lobed shapes with high ratios of 1.09, 1.44, and 2.16, respectively.34 The performance of GeSe polarization-sensitive photodetectors under the irradiation of 830 nm was also investigated, exhibiting polarization-dependent photocurrents. Furthermore, scanning photocurrent microscopy was adopted to characterize the angle-related photoresponse in a more direct way.51 In addition, polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on GeS, GeSe2 and GeAs2 exhibited highly anisotropic photodetection behaviour at 633 nm, 450 nm, and 532 nm, respectively.35,36,40 Besides the above visible and near-infrared region, some Ge-based materials including GeS2 and GeSe2 have been proved to be appropriate for the detection of polarized light in the ultra-violet region when considering their wide bandgaps.32,44
To further improve the performance of polarized light detection based on these anisotropic 2D materials, constructing heterostructures is usually an alternative. For example, Li et al. fabricated a BP/ReS2 heterostructure, and found that the maximum value of anisotropic photocurrent ratio could be 31 for the condition that the armchair crystal orientation in BP was along the b-axis direction in ReS2.81 This ratio was significantly bigger than that of the separate BP and ReS2 devices. Inspired by the merits of heterostructures, Liu et al. fabricated GeSe/MoS2 heterojunctions.82 The heterostructure showed a high performance self-powered polarized light detection, which can be attributed to the formation of type II band structure in the heterostructure that helped the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 10e). The resulting polarization-sensitive photodetection showed that the dichroic ratio can reach as high as 2.02 under the irradiation of 532 nm.82
Besides the above photodetection, some Ge-based materials are considered as promising photovoltaic absorber materials for solar cells. The most representative photovoltaic material is GeSe due to its suitable bandgap, high mobility of holes, excellent light absorption, excellent stability, and low-toxic properties.41 Our group reported the first GeSe-based solar cell that achieved a 1.48% efficiency.41,83 GeS is also promising in solar cells considering its bandgap of ∼1.65 eV, potentially serving as a top cell in tandem devices with silicon or narrow-bandgap perovskite solar cells.43 Additionally, Ho et al. fabricated GeS Schottky solar cells and found that the devices showed a polarization-dependent photoelectric conversion.50
5.2 Polarization-based all-optical switches
All-optical switches achieve the aim of light controlling light, considered as an important element in on-chip optical networks.84 According to the working mechanism of all-optical switches, they can be divided into four categories, which are plasmonic nanostructure-based optical switches, thermo-optic-based optical switches, optical-limiting-based optical switches and saturable absorption-based switches, respectively.79
Former studies about all-optical switches mainly focused on traditional materials, such as liquid crystals and organic polymers. In recent years, 2D materials have been demonstrated to be promising in the application of all-optical switches.84 In particular, based on the polarization-sensitive saturable absorption/reverse saturated-absorption effects of GeS/graphene, the polarization-related all-optical switch was constructed. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 11a. To achieve the switch of “ON” and “OFF” states, the switch of saturable absorption and reverse saturated-absorption response in GeS/graphene was needed by changing the polarization state of the laser between parallel and perpendicular to the armchair direction. The results using three groups of polarized modes, which are 0°/90°, −10°/80° and 10°/100°, are presented in Fig. 11b. For the first polarization mode, the ON/OFF ratio reached 17%, much larger than that of power-dependent all optical switches.79

6. Summary and outlook
In this article, we reviewed the recent progress in in-plane anisotropic 2D Ge-based binary materials, focusing on three fronts, as summarized in Fig. 12. First, we introduced the anisotropic crystal structure and band structure of these Ge-based materials, which is the origin of the in-plane anisotropic physical properties. Second, we discussed the anisotropic properties of these Ge-based materials including anisotropic electrical and optical properties. Third, we summarized the recent progress in optoelectronic applications related to those anisotropic properties including polarization-sensitive photodetection and polarization-based all-optical switches.
 Fig. 12  A scheme showing the main constituent parts of the review. 
To date, a lot of work has been done on this emerging class of anisotropic 2D Ge-based binary material. More fabrication methods to obtain 2D Ge-based flakes have been reported, including mechanical exfoliation (ME), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) and physical vapor deposition (PVD) (provided in Table 1).29,30,32–36,38,40,44,45,85–87 Among them, the ME method has been widely adopted when preparing the flakes of 2D Ge-based materials and further studying their anisotropic properties. This can be due to the simple process of the ME method and the high-quality of as-exfoliated flakes. However, the fundamental understanding of these Ge-based materials is still in the preliminary stage. More research should be done, and the following research directions could be of great importance for the further development of Ge-based binary materials.
(i) To the best of our knowledge, for 2D Ge-based binary materials, the application of their anisotropic electrical properties is a research field that remains to be studied deeply. Future work could focus on the unique electrical applications of these materials, such as integrated digital inverters and orientation-induced diodes.19,88
(ii) Improving the dichroic ratio of polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on these Ge-based materials. Although the emerging anisotropic 2D Ge-based materials are intrinsically sensitive to polarized light, the currently reported dichroic ratios are relatively low. It is essential to explore new methods to improve the value of dichroic ratio, which is a key parameter for polarization photodetection. The feasible strategies may be combination with other anisotropic 2D materials or the utility of plasmonic structures.89
(iii) The recent optical applications based on these low-symmetry 2D Ge-based materials mainly focus on the polarization sensitive detection. Inspired by the various applications of other anisotropic materials, these Ge-based materials can also be used in other optical devices such as polarization reflectors, polarization color filters and optical waveplates for tuning the polarization state of light.63,90
Finally, we hope that this feature article will serve as a guide to this class of emerging in-plane anisotropic 2D Ge-based binary materials, and help gain an in-depth understanding of the anisotropic physical properties of these materials. Meanwhile, the experience accumulated in the studies of BP, ReS2, ReSe2 and other low-symmetry 2D materials could be applied to these Ge-based materials. Thus, it is significant to advance the investigation of the anisotropic properties of these Ge-based materials and fulfill the great potential of this new family of 2D materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications.
