    AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive approach to capturing and storing the earth's abundant solar energy influx. The challenging four-electron water-oxidation half-cell reaction has hindered this technology, giving rise to slow water oxidation kinetics at the photoanode surfaces relative to competitive loss processes. In this perspective, we review recent efforts to improve PEC efficiencies by modification of semiconductor photoanode surfaces with water-oxidation catalysts that can operate at low overpotentials. This approach allows separation of the tasks of photon absorption, charge separation, and surface catalysis, allowing each to be optimized independently. In particular, composite photoanodes marrying nanocrystalline and molecular/non-crystalline components provide flexibility in adjusting the properties of each component, but raise new challenges in interfacial chemistries.

Broader context
Solar energy is abundant and effectively inexhaustible, but improved technologies are needed to capture and store this energy with practical efficiencies. An attractive approach is to use solar photons to drive chemical reactions uphill, thus storing their energy in chemical bonds. Solar water splitting to generate H2 and O2 is among the most important reactions under consideration. The reverse reaction, combustion of H2, liberates the energy stored in the O2 bonds and produces H2O as the only waste product. The development of photoactive materials for solar water splitting has been hindered by the inability to identify any single material that simultaneously displays sufficient photoactivity in the visible region of the solar spectrum and possesses sufficient band-edge potentials to both oxidize and reduce water. The four-electron water oxidation process is most challenging. Inspired by nature's photosynthesis, where the tasks of photon absorption, charge separation, and water-oxidation catalysis are performed by separate protein components, division-of-labor strategies for solar water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells are now being explored. This perspective article describes recent advances in functionalization of metal-oxide mesostructured photoanodes with water-oxidation electrocatalysts and light-harvesting dyes to improve solar water splitting in robust photoelectrochemical cells.

Introduction
The emergence of successful technologies for efficient solar energy conversion and storage would ameliorate concerns over rising global energy demand and environmental sustainability.1,2 One very attractive potential technology involves using solar photons to drive the chemistry of splitting H2O molecules to generate O2 and H2, tantamount to storing the photon energy in the chemical bond of H2.2–4 Hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier because of its high energy density (143 kJ kg−1) and clean combustion (eqn (1)). 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l), ΔH° = 572 kJ mol−1(1)
Inspiration for this chemistry can be drawn from nature, which already uses chlorophyll-containing proteins to harvest solar energy and drive the uphill chemistry of water oxidation. Rather than forming molecular hydrogen, photosystems I and II store the solar energy in the initial form of trans-membrane proton gradients.5–7 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda demonstrated the feasibility of an artificial analog to photosynthetic water splitting with UV light, using the semiconductor TiO2 to absorb photons, separate charges, and catalyze water oxidation to generate O2. Electrons were pumped to a Pt counter electrode, which reduced protons to generate H2.8 Since this seminal report, tremendous effort has been made to develop new materials and approaches showing improved solar water splitting efficiencies using visible light irradiation.3,9–19 After nearly four decades of research, this fundamental objective remains a major challenge in chemistry.
Direct photocatalytic water splitting
The cleavage of water molecules to form O2 and H2 involves the redox half-cell reactions shown in eqn (2) and (3). 2H2O(l) → O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e−, Ered° = 1.23 V vs. NHE(2) 4H+(aq) + 4e− → 2H2(g), Ered° = 0 V vs. NHE(3)
For one material to perform direct overall solar water splitting, it must be stable under photolysis conditions, have its valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) potentials straddling those for water oxidation (eqn (2)) and water reduction (eqn (3)), respectively, and it should absorb a significant portion of the solar spectrum.4,13,16,20 The minimum band gap of the semiconductor required by thermodynamics is only 1.23 eV, or ∼1010 nm, but large overpotentials are typically required for water oxidation.
TiO2 satisfies two of the above three conditions, failing only to absorb significant solar irradiation because of its very wide energy gap (∼3.0 eV). Various approaches have been explored to increase the solar water splitting efficiency of this and many related wide-gap oxides such as SrTiO3, SnO2, and ZnO.4,13,21,22 Cation or anion doping can be used to introduce new impurity energy levels within the semiconductor energy gap, and this strategy has been explored to engineer these materials to absorb more of the visible energy spectrum, with only partial success. Although visible light absorption can be enhanced by doping, this approach often results in little or no increase in overall photocatalytic activity because of new recombination loss channels or reduced conductivity also introduced upon doping.21 Tantalates and niobates with layered or tunneling structures,16,17 such as MTaO323 (M = Li, Na, and K) and Sr2Nb2O7,24 show high photocatalytic activity, but usually exhibit band gaps of ≥4.0 eV, making them only active under UV light irradiation. Nitrogen doping can increase the visible light response of these materials, but reactivity is demonstrated usually only in the presence of sacrificial agents such as methanol or AgNO3. Although narrower gap semiconductors thus appear to be obvious candidates for absorption of more of the visible spectrum, common intermediate-gap semiconductors such as CdS and CdSe are unstable under water oxidation conditions because of the facile oxidation of sulfides or selenides.25 Coating CdS or CdSe with conductive polymers, catalysts, or oxides can slow its degradation,26–30 but to date a suitable solution to this challenge has not been established.
Control over semiconductor shapes and sizes on nanometre length scales can increase photocatalytic efficiencies by decreasing effective particle dimensions to within the carrier diffusion lengths, thereby allowing more effective minority carrier collection at the nanostructure surfaces.31 To date, not all semiconductor materials can be synthesized easily in such shape-controlled nanostructures, and this has particularly not been explored thoroughly in conjunction with doping.
Despite many advances, the development of any single material that is photoactive in the visible region, stable under photolysis conditions, and can simultaneously oxidize and reduce water with high efficiency remains a daunting challenge. Frequently one criterion is met at the expense of another, limiting overall efficiency. Efforts in direct overall photocatalytic water splitting have been reviewed in several excellent comprehensive articles.16,17,32 In order to achieve sufficient overall water splitting, photon absorption and charge separation must be balanced against the demands of stability and catalytic competence, and this may best be accomplished by separation of tasks. Co-catalysts such as RuO2, NiO, or Pt can significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of a photoactive semiconductor,17 and dye molecules can substantially extend the light absorption of wide-gap oxides. Combining materials in a division-of-labor approach appears imperative.
This strategy has been employed in molecular chromophore/catalyst constructs designed to mimic PS-II. Such systems have been reviewed comprehensively elsewhere33,34 and are beyond the scope of the present article, but they represent important homogeneous analogs of the heterogeneous composite photoelectrodes discussed here. In one set of studies, photoexcitation of ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl complexes covalently linked to MnOEC-like complexes was shown to successfully induce intramolecular electron transfer from the Mn catalyst to the photoexcited Ru chromophore. In the presence of external electron acceptors, oxidizing equivalents could be accumulated at the Mn and ultimately lead to irreversible substrate oxidation.35–37 A variation on this approach was demonstrated using CrVI or TiIVCrIII charge transfer chromophores in mesoporous silica coupled to di-µ-oxo dinuclear Mn complexes38 or IrxOy water oxidation catalysts,39 respectively, to generate accumulated oxidizing equivalents. Photosensitization of RuIV4O4-containing polyoxometallates with oxidatively resistant [SiW10O32]8− ancillary groups using ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl has also yielded very interesting sensitized redox catalysis built on such a division-of-labor strategy.40 Although molecular systems are sometimes challenged by stability issues, they represent extremely important well-defined model systems for advancing our fundamental understanding of solar photoredox processes in complex architectures.
Separation of photon absorption, charge separation, and redox chemistries
In contrast with direct photoelectrolysis, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, such as that used by Fujishima and Honda,8 separate the oxygen and hydrogen evolution half reactions physically, allowing each to be optimized independently. A semiconductor suited for photochemical water reduction may not be at all effective at water oxidation, and vice versa. Of these two half-cell reactions, water oxidation is more complex because it is a four-electron process, coupled to removal of four protons from two water molecules (eqn (2)). In PEC cells, large overpotentials are therefore typically associated with the water oxidation half reaction. In principle, the necessary bias can be provided by an external photovoltaic (PV) cell as shown in Fig. 1a, allowing completely solar powered PEC water splitting. Indeed, this configuration also no longer requires the CBM of the photoelectrode to be positioned above the water reduction potential, because the necessary additional bias can be provided by the PV cell. The PEC configuration thus affords more flexibility in materials choice than the direct photoelectrolysis approach. By the same token, optimization of the water-oxidation half reaction to minimize overpotential is essential for efficient solar hydrogen production.
 Fig. 1  Three approaches to photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting: (a) A single-photoelectrode PEC cell assisted by a photovoltaic (PV) cell. The photoanode here is an n-type semiconductor with a positive valance band edge relative to the water oxidation potential. The PV cell boosts the potential of the photogenerated electrons to allow water reduction at the cathode surface. (b) A two-photoelectrode PEC cell in which the photoanode and photocathode are suitably matched n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively, assembled in parallel. (c) A tandem two-photoelectrode PEC cell assembled in series, such that low-energy photons that are not absorbed by the photoanode are absorbed by the photocathode. 
A related device configuration employs two separate semiconductor photoelectrodes. As in Fig. 1a, an n-type semiconductor is used as the photoanode. Instead of Pt as the cathode, a p-type semiconductor having a sufficiently high CBM is used as a photocathode, allowing sunlight to provide some or all of the additional bias needed to power the overall reaction (Fig. 1b).
An attractive variation on both Fig. 1a and b is to align the two photoelectrodes in a serial tandem configuration (Fig. 1c), with the wider-gap component first, such that photons transmitted by the top layer can be absorbed by the bottom layer.3,41 This configuration parallels that of multijunction PVs, and in principle can improve overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies. A variation on this cell design invoking direct connection of the two photoelectrodes, thereby obviating the need for wiring or even transparent conductive oxide substrates, has also been proposed.2
Properties of the ideal PEC photoanode include (i) a relatively small band gap to absorb solar photons, (ii) an appropriate VBM position relative to the water-oxidation potential, (iii) effective separation and diffusion of photogenerated charge carriers, (iv) efficient surface electrocatalysis, (v) high chemical and photochemical stability, and (vi) low cost. Although extensive efforts have been made since 1970s, none of the semiconductors investigated so far meets all these requirements simultaneously. Moreover, it appears increasingly unlikely that any one material will ever be discovered that satisfies all of these demands simultaneously. As with direct photocatalytic water oxidation, modification of photoanodes in PEC cells with competent water-oxidation catalysts can be expected to yield marked improvements. Because of the rapid development of nanostructured semiconductor photoanodes and water oxidation electrocatalysts, several promising composite catalyst/semiconductor photoanodes that show enhanced PEC solar water splitting relative to their individual components have been reported recently. In the following section, we highlight these recent advances.
Mesostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanodes for solar water oxidation
Metal oxides are attractive candidate photoanode materials for solar water oxidation. TiO2 (rutile and anatase), Fe2O3 (α-form, hematite), and WO3 are the mostly studied binary oxide photoanodes. If only considering the band gap, α-Fe2O3 is the most promising of these due to its quite small band gap of ∼2.1 eV (∼590 nm), which can use ∼18% of the solar photons in AM 1.5 sunlight (Fig. 2). Other advantages of α-Fe2O3 include its high chemical and photochemical stability in basic electrolytes, low cost, and environmental compatibility.
 Fig. 2  Solar spectrum (AM 1.5) and the bulk band gap positions of various binary metal oxide semiconductors: α-Fe2O3, 2.1 eV (590 nm); WO3, 2.8 eV (443 nm); rutile TiO2, 3.0 eV (413 nm); ZnO, 3.2 eV (388 nm). 
A variety of intrinsic problems impede the desired performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes for PEC solar water splitting. First, the band gap of α-Fe2O3 is indirect. Absorption of photons in the visible region is therefore limited by a low absorption coefficient, corresponding to a long light penetration depth (on the order of 100 nm).42 Second, α-Fe2O3 has short hole diffusion length (∼2 to 4 nm),43 which is exacerbated by the long light penetration depth, meaning that for bulk α-Fe2O3 most of the photogenerated charge carriers recombine long before reaching the photoanode surface where they might catalyze the oxidation of water. Third, it has been demonstrated that the water-oxidation kinetics at the α-Fe2O3 surface by the valence band holes is slow,44 making non-productive recombination processes more competitive. Fourth, α-Fe2O3 has poor conductivity. Overall, in its pure form, α-Fe2O3 is an inefficient photoanode material. It is not surprising that early studies of α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes typically yielded low photoresponses, with PEC current densities on the order of µA cm−2.43–47
Morphological control and impurity doping have been successful in overcoming some of the above-mentioned problems. To counter the short hole diffusion length, several groups have prepared mesostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanodes such that holes have only short distances to travel before encountering surfaces. Compared to other methods, such as film preparation directly from colloidal nanoparticles,48 the preparation of nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 photoanodes by spray pyrolysis (SP) shows improved photoresponse.49–52 Recently, ultrasonic spay pyrolysis (USP) was used to prepare platelet-like α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, which showed significantly enhanced photoresponse compared to those prepared by the conventional SP method.53 The photoresponse enhancement was attributed to the small thickness (<10 nm) of the platelets, which is commensurate with the hole diffusion length in α-Fe2O3. Incorporation of Si dopants further reduced the size of these α-Fe2O3 platelets and yielded even higher photocurrent densities.54
Si doping was also beneficial in the performance of dendritic α-Fe2O3 nanostructured photoanodes grown by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD).54–56 Si doping plays several roles in improving the performance of these photoanodes. The dopants appear to induce growth of smaller nanocrystals, or inhibit growth of larger nanocrystals, such that the outermost grains are <∼20 nm in diameter (Fig. 3a and b), which is small enough for hole diffusion to the semiconductor surface, whereas they reached ∼40 nm in the absence of Si doping. The introduction of Si also leads to preferential growth of the α-Fe2O3 along the [110] axis perpendicular to the substrate surface. α-Fe2O3 has higher conductivity along [110] direction,57 and this oriented growth thus enhances carrier transport to the back contact. Finally, Si dopants likely serve as electron donors, thereby also improving the α-Fe2O3 conductivity. These α-Fe2O3 photoanodes grown by APCVD yielded high solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies in pH = 13.6 electrolyte under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent density reached ∼2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (the thermodynamic water-oxidation potential), which could be further increased to ∼2.7 mA cm−2 upon adsorption of Co2+ ions onto the surface by wet impregnation (Fig. 3c, vide infra). α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared by the same method without Si showed dramatically reduced photoresponse.56

(b) Top-view SEM image showing the small surface nanocrystals (10–20 nm in diameter). (c) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements in dark and in simulated AM 1.5G sunlight at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The red curves are the Si-doped α-Fe2O3. The black curves are the same anode after wet impregnation with a cobalt nitrate solution (adapted from ref. 55). 
Electrochemical deposition,58–60 chemical solution deposition,61 and reactive magnetron sputtering62 have also been used to synthesize undoped and doped α-Fe2O3 nanostructured photoanodes. Different from the one-step SP, USP, and APCVD methods that operate at high temperatures (>400 °C), these methods generally involve film deposition at relatively low temperatures, followed by annealing at high temperatures (>500 °C) to obtain nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Although the photoresponses of such photoanodes have been lower than those achieved using APCVD, these approaches appear to be amenable to incorporation of a wide variety of dopants such as Ti or Cr,59,63 which could lead to improved light harvesting or electrical conductivity.
One-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures such as nanorods/nanowires and nanotubes are also attractive for PEC applications because their small radial dimensions should allow efficient hole capture at the photoelectrode surfaces while maintaining electron transport in the longitudinal dimension,41,64 stimulating efforts to develop photoanodes involving highly anisotropic α-Fe2O3 nanostructures. Early studies on α-Fe2O3 nanorod photoanodes showed low photoresponses,65,66 however, mainly attributed to fast carrier recombination and slow water oxidation kinetics at the anode surfaces. An aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method was used to prepare rod-like α-Fe2O3 photoanodes that showed photocurrent densities ∼0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in AM 1.5G simulated sunlight and basic electrolyte.67
Recently, the preparation of micron-long α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays via electrochemical anodization of Fe foils has been reported.68–70 The nanotube wall thicknesses were typically <∼20 nm, and their pore diameters were <100 nm (Fig. 4). Photocurrent densities of ∼1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE were achieved with these nanotube arrays using AM 1.5 simulated sunlight and basic electrolyte,69,70 which is likely the highest reported value for undoped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.

A family of cobalt-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation
In photosynthesis, water oxidation is performed by the Mn4O4Ca oxygen-evolving cluster of photosystem II (MnOEC of PS-II).71 For artificial photosynthesis based on water splitting, a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous water-oxidation catalysts have been developed.72–78 Some of these catalysts contain precious metals or do not operate in neutral water under ambient conditions, factors that may ultimately limit their widespread applicability, but a great deal has nevertheless been learned about the criteria for active photoelectrolysis from broad investigation of such catalysts.
Recently, a new family of cobalt-based electrocatalysts was discovered that show electrochemical oxygen evolution at relatively low overpotentials under mild ambient conditions (pH = 7–9.2, 1 atm, and room temperature).79–82 These catalysts, which include cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi), cobalt methylphosphonate (Co-MePi), and cobalt borate (Co-Bi) variations, can be electro- or photo-deposited onto various electrodes from the corresponding Co2+ solutions in anion buffer. Fig. 5a shows an SEM image of one typical Co-Pi catalyst film. From EXAFS studies of this catalyst, the active centers are likely cobalt-oxo cubane-type clusters (Fig. 5b).83 The prominent Co–O and Co–Co distances in the Co-Pi catalyst EXAFS data indicate distances of 0.19 nm and 0.28 nm, respectively, which are remarkably close to the corresponding Mn–O and Mn–Mn distances found in the Mn4O4Ca clusters of PS-II.71 Moreover, the Co-Pi water-oxidation catalyst has been noted to possess some of the attractive general characteristics of the MnOEC of PS-II, including a “self-healing” capacity under turnover conditions in phosphate buffer.80 Like manganese, the relative abundance of cobalt makes this family of water-oxidation catalysts promising for low-cost artificial solar water splitting.

Composite Co-Pi/semiconductor photoanodes for PEC solar water oxidation
As noted above, α-Fe2O3 has a relatively narrow band gap that can absorb a large portion of visible photons from sunlight (Fig. 2). Although its valance band edge potential is ∼1.2 V more positive than required for water oxidation thermodynamically (eqn (2)), its performance is still hindered by slow water-oxidation kinetics. As such, α-Fe2O3 serves as a prototype photoanode material for testing strategies to overcome this challenging chemistry. Like in direct photoelectrolysis, modification of the α-Fe2O3 surfaces by cocatalysts offers an attractive route to improved performance. For example, cocatalysts such as RuO2, NiO, or Pt can significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of a photoactive semiconductor.17 Deposition of RuO2 nanocrystals onto α-Fe2O3 surfaces led to a ∼120 mV cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential,84 as did adsorption of Co2+ ions by wet impregnation55 (∼80 mV, Fig. 3c). In the latter case, the proposed mechanism involved trapping of photogenerated holes by the surface cobalt ions to give stepwise oxidation of Co2+ to Co4+, followed by water oxidation, in a fashion directly parallel to the mechanism of water oxidation in PS-II.
Surface adsorbed anions appear to play a different role. Modification of TiO2 photoelectrode surfaces with F− in acetonitrile85,86 and in aqueous solution87 was reported to result in a cathodic shift of the flat-band potential. A ∼150 mV cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential in Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes was observed after wet impregnation in aqueous CoF3 solutions.63 Control experiments excluded possible contributions from cobalt cations or other anions such as Cl− in their measurements, and the observed performance enhancement was proposed to reflect a cathodic shift of the flat-band potential.
Recently, composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were explored for PEC solar water splitting.88,89 Co-Pi was electrodeposited onto the surfaces of APCVD-grown Si-doped α-Fe2O3 mesostructured thin films. SEM images of the parent α-Fe2O3 photoanode (Fig. 6a) reveal highly structured electrode surfaces with dendritic features like in Fig. 3. After Co-Pi deposition, a ∼200 nm thick catalyst layer covered the α-Fe2O3 film (Fig. 6b). Extensive cracking of the Co-Pi layer was observed, which is believed to be due to drying for the SEM measurement. Fig. 6c shows a portion of the catalyst layer that has curled off of the α-Fe2O3 film upon drying, allowing its underside to be seen. Interestingly, the inverse mesostructure from the α-Fe2O3 thin film can be seen in this underside, indicating that the catalyst deposits conformally onto the highly structured α-Fe2O3 surface. A high degree of interfacial contact between the α-Fe2O3 and the catalyst layer is essential for fast hole transfer from the oxide to the catalyst.
 Fig. 6  (a) SEM image of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode before electrodeposition of Co-Pi catalyst. SEM images of composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes collected following 1 hour (b and c) and 15 min (d) of Co-Pi electrodeposition. The catalyst layer cracking occurs upon drying for the SEM measurement and in some cases allows inspection of the catalyst underside (c), which shows that the Co-Pi layer conforms to the α-Fe2O3 mesostructure. The dark spots in panel (d) are the catalyst. (e) and (f) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 (red) and composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes in 1 M NaOH (black) and 0.1 M KPi electrolyte with (green) and without (blue) 0.1 M NaCl in the dark (dashed) and in simulated one-sun AM 1.5 sunlight (solid) with front-side illumination at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (adapted from ref. 88 and 89). 
Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of the parent α-Fe2O3 and composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes in 1 M NaOH under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight demonstrated that Co-Pi modification shifts the photocurrent onset potential for solar water oxidation by several hundred millivolts compared to that of α-Fe2O3 alone.88 Current densities were low (∼0.5 mA cm−2), however, because of the need for backside illumination of the photoanode with such a thick, absorbant catalyst layer.
Optimization of the Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanode structure for frontside illumination gave ∼200% enhancement of efficiency at +1.0 V vs. RHE.89 Non-productive photon absorption by the catalyst was reduced by decreasing the deposition time to yield a thinner Co-Pi layer. This thinner deposition also remediated an apparent kinetic bottleneck associated with the catalyst thickness.89 SEM images show only Co-Pi islands on the α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 6d), but a thin layer of Co-Pi over the entire surface was detected by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The Co-Pi islands were hypothesized to form over pinholes or scratches in the α-Fe2O3 film, where current could flow more freely during catalyst electrode position. Fig. 6e shows the current–voltage characteristics of one such Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode, compared to data from the parent α-Fe2O3 photoanode, both under frontside illumination in pH 13.6, 1 M NaOH. With Co-Pi, a ∼180 mV cathodic shift in the PEC onset potential was observed. Modification of α-Fe2O3 surfaces with Co-Pi thus significantly reduces the external bias required for solar water splitting in a PEC cell configuration such as those shown in Fig. 1, illustrating the advantage of separating photon harvesting from multi-electron redox catalysis.
Sustained solar water oxidation by Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes was also demonstrated at lower pH levels. Fig. 6f shows the current–voltage curves of the same photoanodes from Fig. 6e, measured instead in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (KPi) buffered at pH 8, which is the average pH of seawater. A similar cathodic shift is observed. Remarkably, J–V curves with 0.1 M NaCl added are essentially indistinguishable from those without NaCl (Fig. 6f), demonstrating that PEC water oxidation with Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes can be performed equally well in the presence of chloride. Oxygen detection experiments show enhanced oxygen production even after several hours of illumination, with enhancement factors comparable to those of the photocurrent, confirming sustained solar water oxidation by Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes.
The IPCE measurements of the composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode at 1.0 V vs. RHE showed that the photoresponse comes exclusively from α-Fe2O3 photoexcitation, indicating that Co-Pi functions solely as a surface electrocatalyst.88 The composite photoanode thus relies on efficient transfer of photogenerated holes from α-Fe2O3 to the Co-Pi catalyst layer. Appending Co-Pi to the α-Fe2O3 surface is thus akin to introducing well-defined surface hole traps in place of the poorly defined native surface states that catalyze water oxidation in the absence of catalyst. This modification should enhance irreversible electron-hole separation and reduce unwanted carrier recombination processes. Overall, the composite Co-Pi/semiconductor photoanodes allow photon absorption, carrier separation, and redox surface catalysis to be effectively decoupled, yielding improved performance.
Electrodeposition of a uniform Co-Pi surface catalyst layer requires small conductivity variations over the entire semiconductor electrode. For many attractive semiconductor photoanodes, such as nanorod arrays on conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, this condition is difficult to achieve. Electrode position of Co-Pi onto semiconductor nanorod surfaces is hindered by the fact that the FTO substrate is substantially more conductive than the nanorods grown upon it, making the Co-Pi deposit preferentially on the bare FTO surface. This difficulty can be overcome by photochemical deposition. Co-Pi nanoparticles with ∼10 to 30 nm diameters were recently deposited onto ZnO nanorods grown on FTO (Fig. 7a and b) by UV light illumination in the absence of external bias.90 The narrower band gap of ZnO than FTO allows selective excitation of the nanorods, directing catalyst deposition to only these surfaces. Formation of Co-Pi nanoparticles instead of a uniform surface layer suggests that the most readily available photogenerated holes are not uniformly distributed on the ZnO surfaces. Photodeposition thus places the Co-Pi catalyst precisely at those locations that have the highest photochemical activity.

(c) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of ZnO (black) and Co-Pi/ZnO (gray) photoanodes using chopped light (100 mW cm−2, 1 Hz) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Arrows indicate the photocurrent onset potential. (d and e) Photocurrent of ZnO (black) and Co-Pi/ZnO (gray) photoanodes measured at 0.0 and 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively (adapted from ref. 90). 

Fig. 7c shows linear sweep voltammetry measurements of such ZnO and Co-Pi/ZnO nanorod photoanodes measured using chopped photoexcitation. The photocurrent densities are substantially lower than for α-Fe2O3 because ZnO is a poor photon absorber (Eg = 3.2 eV, Fig. 2). Upon Co-Pi deposition, the photocurrent onset potential was cathodically shifted by ∼0.2 V relative to the parent ZnO, very similar to the results from the composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. The photocurrent was also enhanced over the entire potential range investigated (Fig. 7c), becoming less significant at more positive potentials. For example, under steady-state conditions, the composite Co-Pi/ZnO photoanode showed photocurrent enhancements of 2.6- and 1.5-fold at 0.0 V and 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 7d and e), respectively, relative to the parent ZnO anode. This result suggests that the increased band bending at high potentials already provides sufficient driving force for efficient electron-hole separation even in the absence of the Co-Pi surface catalyst. As with the Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes, the role of surface modification is thus most important at low applied potentials. For practical energy conversion applications, a reduction in applied potential translates into a lower overall cost of the solar-to-hydrogen conversion technology.
Composite catalyst/dye/semiconductor photoanodes for PEC solar water splitting
TiO2 was the first semiconductor photoanode material investigated for PEC water splitting.8 It is cheap, environmentally benign, and highly stable over a broad pH range, making it attractive for such applications.91,92 Unfortunately, its large band gap (>3.0 eV, Fig. 2) allows it to absorb only the UV portion of sunlight, leading to low solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. One popular approach to extend absorption into the visible in TiO2-based solar-energy-conversion devices is to anchor dye molecules to the TiO2 surfaces, which can absorb visible light and transfer photoexcited carriers into the TiO2. This approach is mainly employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).93,94 In DSSCs, TiO2 acts as an acceptor of the photogenerated electrons, and the photogenerated holes in the dye molecules are quenched by redox mediators such as the I−/I3− couple. Because the photogenerated holes are typically localized on the dye molecules without sufficient potential for water oxidation, and because dyes are typically only one-electron photoredox reagents, this approach has rarely been used for PEC solar water splitting.
Recently, Mallouk and co-workers demonstrated the feasibility of attaching IrO2·nH2O nanoparticles, which are well-known water-oxidation catalysts,72 to a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode.95,96 A tailor-made ruthenium dye acts not only as the visible-light absorber but also as a stabilizer of the IrO2·nH2O nanoparticles (Fig. 8a). In these initial experiments, electron transfer from the solid catalyst nanoparticles to the oxidized dye molecules was found to be slow and could not compete well with the faster back electron transfer from TiO2 to the dye, yielding small photocurrents (Fig. 8b). Nevertheless, this catalyst/dye/semiconductor approach provides an exciting proof-of-concept strategy for achieving efficient PEC solar water splitting based on stable large-band-gap semiconductors sensitized by surface dyes, in analogy to DSSCs.

The problem of slow electron transfer from catalyst to dye molecules could perhaps be alleviated by using a molecular water-oxidation catalyst, and recent efforts have helped make important steps toward application of molecular catalysts in PEC solar water splitting devices.97 In one related molecular photoanode assembly that parallels the photon absorption, charge separation, and MnOEC-catalyzed water oxidation of photosynthesis, attachment of a dinuclear di-µ-oxo Mn-based water-oxidation catalyst, [H2O(2,2′:6′,2″-terpy)MnIII(µ-O)2MnIV(2,2′:6′,2″-terpy)H2O](NO3)3, onto TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces using a robust dye linker capable of absorbing visible light was reported.98 The MnIII(µ-O)2MnIV inorganic core could be oxidized to MnIV(µ-O)2MnIV upon visible-light absorption, indicating effective electron transfer from the manganese catalyst to the dye linker. The PEC solar water splitting performance of this assembly remains to be elucidated. Very recently, a photo-responsive tetranuclear Mn-oxo water-oxidation catalyst ([Mn4O4((MeOPh)2PO2−)6]+) dispersed in a proton-conductive Nafion membrane was attached to [RuII(bipy)2(bipy(COO)2)]-sensitized TiO2.99 The PEC performance of this composite photoanode assembly measured in neutral electrolyte (0.1 M Na2SO4) using a two-electrode system has established that water splitting could be achieved using visible light in the absence of external bias. The photocurrent density was rather low, which is likely due to the slow interfacial electron transfer. Additionally, significant photocurrent decay was observed, which could indicate photodegradation of some of the components of the assembly. In parallel, the catalytic water-oxidation properties of [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-((HO)2OPCH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+ anchored onto metal-oxide electrode surfaces has been established,100 providing further impetus for exploring this strategy thoroughly.
The successes in anchoring molecular water-oxidation catalysts to metal-oxide semiconductor surfaces may portend efficient composite photoanodes of this type that are competitive with the crystalline or amorphous composite photoelectrodes discussed above. Further improvement of catalyst/dye/semiconductor and related composite photoanodes involving molecular components will rely on controlling the semiconductor–catalyst, semiconductor–dye, and dye–catalyst interfaces for favorable electron transfer kinetics across these interfaces.101 Whether with crystalline, amorphous, or molecular catalysts, photoanodes with greater absorption in the visible are needed, which should refocus efforts onto the development of composite structures designed to protect oxidatively less robust materials against degradation.26–30 This general approach is modular and therefore conducive to stepwise evolution as photoanodes with greater light harvesting capabilities are developed, or better redox catalysts that can be interfaced with such anodes emerge.
Summary and perspective
The development of practical technologies for the generation of H2 fuel using sunlight is challenged by inefficiencies in the four-electron water oxidation chemistry. This chemistry is generally inefficient because it is challenging to achieve photon absorption in the visible region, efficient charge separation/transport to the surfaces, and fast surface redox catalysis simultaneously in any one material. Strategies that separate the above tasks allow optimization of each function independently, and offer the possibility of vast improvements in practical solar water splitting technologies.
Following recent improvements of promising metal-oxide mesostructured photoanodes, and the emergence of attractive water-oxidation electrocatalysts that can be interfaced with such photoanodes, composite catalyst/(dye)/semiconductor photoanode assemblies are now becoming more prominent research targets for addressing the challenges of solar water splitting via separation of tasks. This approach has already uncovered significant opportunities to reduce photocurrent onset potentials of well characterized photoanodes without hindering other performance characteristics such as photocurrent densities, stability, or tolerance to impurity ions. PEC performance at reduced external bias lessens the demand for external power, which ultimately reduces manufacturing expense and improves the overall competitiveness of solar hydrogen technologies.

Broader context
Solar energy is abundant and effectively inexhaustible, but improved technologies are needed to capture and store this energy with practical efficiencies. An attractive approach is to use solar photons to drive chemical reactions uphill, thus storing their energy in chemical bonds. Solar water splitting to generate H2 and O2 is among the most important reactions under consideration. The reverse reaction, combustion of H2, liberates the energy stored in the O2 bonds and produces H2O as the only waste product. The development of photoactive materials for solar water splitting has been hindered by the inability to identify any single material that simultaneously displays sufficient photoactivity in the visible region of the solar spectrum and possesses sufficient band-edge potentials to both oxidize and reduce water. The four-electron water oxidation process is most challenging. Inspired by nature's photosynthesis, where the tasks of photon absorption, charge separation, and water-oxidation catalysis are performed by separate protein components, division-of-labor strategies for solar water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells are now being explored. This perspective article describes recent advances in functionalization of metal-oxide mesostructured photoanodes with water-oxidation electrocatalysts and light-harvesting dyes to improve solar water splitting in robust photoelectrochemical cells.

 	Fig. 1  Three approaches to photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting: (a) A single-photoelectrode PEC cell assisted by a photovoltaic (PV) cell. The photoanode here is an n-type semiconductor with a positive valance band edge relative to the water oxidation potential. The PV cell boosts the potential of the photogenerated electrons to allow water reduction at the cathode surface. (b) A two-photoelectrode PEC cell in which the photoanode and photocathode are suitably matched n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively, assembled in parallel. (c) A tandem two-photoelectrode PEC cell assembled in series, such that low-energy photons that are not absorbed by the photoanode are absorbed by the photocathode.

 	Fig. 4  Top-view (a) and side-view (b) SEM images of α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays prepared by anodization of Fe foil at a potential of 50 V in ethylene glycol (adapted from ref. 68).	 

 	Fig. 5  Co-Pi water-oxidation electrocatalyst. (a) SEM image of a Co-Pi catalyst layer prepared by electrodeposition onto ITO for ∼7 hours at 1.3 V vs. NHE from a 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) containing 0.5 mM Co2+ (adapted from ref. 79). (b) Proposed structure of the cobalt-oxo active core of the Co-Pi catalyst (cobalt in blue and oxygen in red), based on EXAFS data (adapted from ref. 83).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) SEM image of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode before electrodeposition of Co-Pi catalyst. SEM images of composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes collected following 1 hour (b and c) and 15 min (d) of Co-Pi electrodeposition. The catalyst layer cracking occurs upon drying for the SEM measurement and in some cases allows inspection of the catalyst underside (c), which shows that the Co-Pi layer conforms to the α-Fe2O3 mesostructure. The dark spots in panel (d) are the catalyst. (e) and (f) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 (red) and composite Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes in 1 M NaOH (black) and 0.1 M KPi electrolyte with (green) and without (blue) 0.1 M NaCl in the dark (dashed) and in simulated one-sun AM 1.5 sunlight (solid) with front-side illumination at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (adapted from ref. 88 and 89).	 

 	Fig. 7  (a and b) SEM images of ZnO and composite Co-Pi/ZnO nanorod photoanodes, grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. (c) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of ZnO (black) and Co-Pi/ZnO (gray) photoanodes using chopped light (100 mW cm−2, 1 Hz) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Arrows indicate the photocurrent onset potential. (d and e) Photocurrent of ZnO (black) and Co-Pi/ZnO (gray) photoanodes measured at 0.0 and 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively (adapted from ref. 90).	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Schematic of a TiO2/dye/IrO2 photoanode for solar water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell. (b) Plot of steady-state photocurrent vs. applied potential. The inset shows the photocurrent decay profile measured at 0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (adapted from ref. 96).
