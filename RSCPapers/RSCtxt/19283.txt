    , Accepted 25th November 2011First published on 22nd December 2011AbstractA comparative study of the properties of bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) using a benzothiadiazole (BTD)–triphenylamine (TPA) small molecule and its polymerized molecule (poly(BTD-TPA)) is presented. OPVs using BTD-TPA or poly(BTD-TPA):PC60BM at a 1:2 mixing weight ratio were fabricated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the poly(BTD-TPA)-based OPV was twice that of the BTD–TPA-based OPV. The field-effect hole mobility of poly(BTD-TPA) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of BTD–TPA and the absorption peak of poly(BTD-TPA) is at a longer wavelength than that of BTD–TPA. Accordingly, the improved hole mobility and enhanced absorption of AM1.5 solar-simulated light led to a high short-circuit current (Jsc) and PCE in OPVs based on poly(BTD-TPA). Using OPVs with poly(BTD-TPA):PC70BM (1:4), the device performance exhibited a Jsc value of 7.45 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.92 V, a PCE of 2.65%, and incident photon to current conversion efficiencies of around 50% at wavelengths ranging from 360 to 560 nm. The experimental results for the OPVs with BTD–TPA-based materials indicate that the polymer is effective for obtaining high-performance OPVs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processable bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) offer a new source of electrical energy and capitalize on advantages such as low fabrication cost and easy processing on flexible substrates.1–3 To date, through the development of new organic semiconductors for BHJ OPVs, power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 7% for OPVs that incorporate a low bandgap π-conjugated polymer have been reported.4–8
Recent years have seen the emergence of two approaches for the development of materials for high-performance BHJ OPVs: one approach uses small molecules (or oligomers)9,10 while the other uses polymers as the donor materials.11,12 Small molecular donors feature some specific advantages in terms of structural definition, synthetic reproducibility, and ease of purification. However, π-conjugated polymers possess other advantages in terms of excellent flexibility and workability and long π-conjugation. While there remains uncertainty about which small molecule and polymer materials would be the most appropriate for BHJ OPVs, very few studies have compared BHJ OPVs using small molecules and polymers within the same π-conjugation skeleton.13
Along these lines, we report a comparative study for the properties of BHJ OPVs with benzothiadiazole (BTD)–triphenylamine (TPA) containing either small molecules (BTD–TPA) or the corresponding polymer (poly(BTD-TPA)). The chemical structures of these materials are shown in Fig. 1. We chose BTD–TPA-based materials as the donor in this study because TPA and its derivatives have attracted attention as OPV materials due to their excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, electron-donating ability, and charge-transport properties.14–17 Moreover, materials with TPA moieties linked to acceptor moieties such as BTD, which have a low optical band gap due to intramolecular charge transfer between electron-donating TPA and electron-accepting BTD, have seen remarkable progress in their synthesis for OPVs.18–28

A stock solution of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (1.29 g, 1.25 mmol) in dry toluene (20 mL) was added to a mixture of 4-octylaniline (1) (22.9 mL, 100 mmol), bromobenzene (23.2 mL, 220 mmol), and sodium tert-butoxide (23.1 g, 240 mmol) in dry toluene (130 mL) at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was then refluxed for 16 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the mixture was washed with water and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness in vacuo.

            4-Octyl-N,N-bis[4-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborinan-2-yl)phenyl]aniline (4). 
A 1.65 M butyllithium hexane solution (5.75 mL, 9.5 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 3 (2.33 g, 4.52 mmol) in dry THF (22 mL) at −78 °C over 5 min under an argon atmosphere. After the mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 1 h, trimethylborate (1.1 mL, 9.9 mmol) in dry THF (4 mL) was added dropwise over 5 min. The mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 1 h and then warmed to room temperature. After the reaction was quenched with aqueous 1.2 M hydrochloric acid solution (to pH = ∼5 to 7), the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine and water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. Neopentyl glycol (940 mg, 9.0 mmol) was added to the concentrated solution, and the mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (KANTO 60N) with dichloromethane as the eluent to give 4 in a 74% yield (943 mg, 1.62 mmol) as a white viscous solid: mp 41–43 °C; IR (KBr, cm−1) 3033, 2958, 2927, 2854, 1594, 1507, 1315 (νB–O), 1306 (νB–O), 1284, 1135, 668, 649; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 0.89 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 3H, CH3), 1.02 (s, 12H, CH3), 1.22–1.37 (m, 10H, CH2), 1.61 (quint, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H, CH2), 2.56 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H, CH2), 3.74 (s, 8H, CH2), 7.00 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H, ArH), 7.04 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 4H, ArH), 7.06 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H, ArH), 7.64 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 4H, ArH); FAB-MS (positive, NBA) m/z 581 [(M + 1)+].

Preparation of poly(BTD-TPA). 

4 (581 mg, 1.0 mmol), potassium carbonate (2.21 g, 16.0 mmol), and Aliquat 336 (40 mg, 0.1 mmol) water solution (5 mL) were added to a mixture of 5 (294 mg, 1.0 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (23 mg, 0.02 mmol) in deaerated toluene (10 mL) under an argon atmosphere; the mixture was heated at 90 °C for 17 h. After reaction completion, bromobenzene (11 μL, 0.10 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. After one hour, phenylboronic acid (12 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 90 °C for 11 h to complete the end-capping reaction. The reaction mixture was then poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with brine and water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (WAKO C300) with dichloromethane as the eluent and GPC (JAIGEL-2H/3H) with chloroform as the eluent to give poly(BTD-TPA) in a 53% yield (259 mg, 0.529 mmol) as a dark red film: IR (KBr, cm−1) 3031, 2952, 2921, 2850, 1597, 1507, 1474, 1318, 1280, 886, 822; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 0.90 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 3H, CH3), 1.21–1.42 (m, 10H, CH2), 1.64 (quint, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H, CH2), 2.62 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H, CH2), 7.10–7.36 (m, 8H, ArH), 7.67–7.70 (m, capping-PhH), 7.73–7.81 (m, 2H, ArH), 7.85–7.90 (m, capping-PhH), 7.90–7.99 (m, 4H, ArH); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 14.1, 22.7, 29.3, 29.4, 29.5, 31.6, 31.9, 35.5, 122.4, 123.2, 123.3, 124.5, 125.3, 125.9, 126.9, 127.5, 129.3, 129.3, 129.5, 129.8, 129.8, 129.9, 130.0, 131.0, 131.2, 131.3, 132.2, 139.0, 144.6, 147.7, 147.8, 147.9, 154.2, 155.7; GPC (CHCl3): Mn = 4200 g mol−1, Mw = 6200 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 1.5.

2.3. General measurements and characterization
All melting points are uncorrected. The IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-470 plus Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer and measured either as KBr pellets or on NaCl plates. The 1H NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3 using a JEOL JNM-LA 400 spectrometer. Residual solvent protons were used as the internal standard and chemical shifts (δ) are given relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS). The coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). Elemental analysis was performed at the Elemental Analytical Center, Kyushu University. Fast atom bombardment mass spectra (FAB-MS) were recorded using a JEOL JMS-70 mass spectrometer with m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) as the matrix. Analytical TLC was carried out on silica gel-coated aluminium foil (Merck 60 F254). Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (WAKO C300 or KANTO 60N). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using a Japan Analytical Industry Co., Ltd LC-918 with a combination of JAIGEL-2H and JAIGEL-3H (20 × 600 mm) columns and chloroform as the eluent at a rate of 3.0 mL min−1.
The molecular weight of poly(BTD-TPA) was determined viagel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a TOSOH HLC-8020 system with two TSK-gel GMHxl-L (7.8 × 300 mm) columns using an RI detector and chloroform (HPLC grade) as the eluent at a rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity (Mw/Mn) were determined using a TOSOH Multi Station GPC-8020 calibrated with a series of polystyrene standards. The thermal stability was analyzed using a Mettler Toledo TGA 851 at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The UV-vis spectra in dichloromethane were measured on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer in a 1.0 cm wide quartz cell at 1 × 10−5 M. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement of the surface morphology of samples was conducted on a Nanocute (SII NanoTechnology Inc.) in tapping mode. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the organic semiconductors were estimated by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) using an AC-3 spectrometer (Riken Keiki).31
2.4. Fabrication and characterization of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)
To estimate the hole mobilities of BTD–TPA-based materials and the electron mobility of PC60BM, we fabricated and characterized OFETs with a top-contact geometry. A glass/Au gate electrode/Parylene-C insulator substrate was prepared according to previously reported methods.32 Parylene-C was deposited with a thickness ranging from 1201 to 1261 nm. The dielectric capacitance of the insulating layer per unit area ranged from 2.36 to 2.25 nF cm−2. Organic semiconductors were then spin-coated from an o-dichlorobenzene solution onto the Parylene-C layer. The substrate was transferred to an N2 glovebox and dried at 110 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. Source drain electrodes of Au (40 nm) for the BTD–TPA-based materials and Ag (40 nm) for PC60BM were thermally evaporated through shadow masks. The channel length and width were fixed at 75 μm and 5 mm, respectively. The OFET measurement was conducted under vacuum conditions using a Keithley 2636A System Source Meter.
2.5. Fabrication and characterization of OPVs
The OPVs were fabricated in the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The patterned ITO (conductivity: 10 Ω per square) glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and ethanol and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber. A thin layer (40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO at 3000 rpm and dried at 110 °C for 10 min on a hot plate in air. The substrate was then transferred to an N2 glove box and dried again at 110 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. An o-dichlorobenzene solution of BTD–TPA or poly(BTD-TPA):PCBM blend, which varied from 1:1 to 1:4 (weight ratio), was subsequently spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS surface to form the active layer. The resultant substrate was dried at 110 °C for 10 min in an N2 glove box. Finally, LiF (1 nm) and Al (80 nm) were deposited onto the active layer by conventional thermal evaporation at a chamber pressure lower than 5 × 10−4 Pa, which provided the devices with an active area of 2 × 2 mm2. The thicknesses of the blend films and PEDOT:PSS layers were measured using an automatic microfigure measuring instrument (Surfcorder ET200, Kosaka Laboratory Ltd.). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using an ADCMT 6244 DC Voltage Current Source/Monitor under an AM 1.5 solar-simulated light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Wacom Electric Co., Ltd.). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a CEP-2000 system (Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd.).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of poly(BTD-TPA)

          4-Octyl-N,N-bis(4-bromophenyl)aniline (3) was prepared by the bromination of 4-octyl-N,N-diphenylaniline (2), which was obtained by a palladium(0)-catalyzed amination reaction of 4-octylaniline (1) with aniline as displayed in Scheme 1.30Dibromide 3 was converted to the corresponding bisboronic acid by lithiation followed by treatment with trimethylborate (Scheme 1). The resulting boronic acid was protected with neopentyl glycol to generate the bisboronate (4) which was easily isolated and purified. 4 was then polymerized via a palladium(0)-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction with dibromo[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (5). After polymerization, an end-capping reaction was carried out by treatment with bromobenzene and phenylboronic acid. The obtained polymer, poly(BTD-TPA), is soluble in common organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform, THF, and o-dichlorobenzene. TGA analysis of the polymer indicates high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature around 455 °C (5% weight loss). The number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity (Mw/Mn) were estimated to be 4,200, 6,200, and 1.5, respectively. Although the Mn and Mw of poly(BTD-TPA) are slightly low in the polymeric regime, our previous study confirms that a strong Mw influence on performances of OFETs is not observed when using triphenylamine polymer (TSP-A02) with Mw ranging from 5500 to 9400.14

3.2. Thin film properties of BTD–TPA derivatives
The normalized optical absorption spectra of BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA) in the film state are shown in Fig. 2. The UV-Vis absorption maxima of BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA) appeared at 477 and 494 nm in the film state and at 458 and 477 nm in dichloromethane solution, respectively. The absorption edge in the film state was at 543 and 561 nm, which corresponds to a band gap of 2.28 eV for BTD–TPA and 2.21 eV for poly(BTD-TPA). A comparison of spectra of the BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA) films reveals that the latter has a slightly red-shifted absorption as a result of increased conjugation length. The HOMO energy levels of BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA) were determined to be −5.56 and −5.47 eV, respectively. The higher HOMO level of poly(BTD-TPA) implies a lower interface barrier between PEDOT:PSS (ionization potential of −5.0 eV) and poly(BTD-TPA) than between PEDOT:PSS and BTD–TPA.

3.3. Field-effect hole mobilities of BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA)
The charge carrier mobility of organic semiconductors is an important factor in the efficiency of OPVs.33–35 Increased carrier mobility in BHJ OPVs would have a positive effect on carrier extraction and charge collection efficiency, which is related to the sum of the hole and electron drift lengths.33 However, high carrier mobilities will also increase the bimolecular recombination strength.35 In consideration of the two competing processes, i.e.carrier extraction and recombination, that are both governed by carrier mobility, Mandoc et al. demonstrated that the efficiency exhibits a distinct maximum as a function of the carrier mobilities in BHJ OPVs of P3HT:PC60BM: the maximum PCE occurs with electron mobilities ranging from 10−2 to 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (hole mobilities ranging from 10−3 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and decreases at both lower and higher mobilities.34 Shieh et al. also estimated that the highest efficiency in BHJ OPVs can be reached if one kind of carrier mobility is fixed at 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the other is within a tolerance range of 10−1 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.35 These results indicate that charge mobilities up to around 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 are beneficial for the performance (especially, the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF)) of BHJ OPVs.
To estimate the charge carrier mobility of the materials used in this study, we fabricated and characterized the OFETs. Although the OFET measurement provides information on carrier mobilities in the direction parallel to the substrate, the measurement is helpful for estimating mobilities perpendicular to the substrate and interpreting the behavior of OPVs, in the case of the amorphous films of BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA) in which isotropic carrier transports are realized. In fact, Veres et al. reported the field-effect hole mobility of amorphous organic semiconductors such as polytriarylamines (PTAA) was very close to the bulk time-of-flight mobility.36

Fig. 3 shows the transfer characteristics (at a drain voltage of −100 V) of the OFETs based on BTD–TPA or poly(BTD-TPA). Above the threshold voltage, the field-effect hole mobility can be calculated from the slope of the plot of the square root of the drain current versus gate voltage. From the plots in Fig. 3, the field-effect hole mobility was calculated to be 5.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a threshold voltage of −22 V and an on/off ratio of 1.2 × 102 for the BTD–TPA-based OFET. For the poly(BTD-TPA)-based OFET, the field-effect hole mobility was calculated to be 3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a threshold voltage of −29 V and an on/off ratio of 1.3 × 104. Therefore, the hole mobility of poly(BTD-TPA) is about two orders of magnitude higher than that of BTD–TPA. This is most likely due to the extended electron delocalization in the polymer compared to in BTD–TPA.

3.4. Photovoltaic properties of BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA)
OPVs based on various blend ratios of BTD–TPA-based materials and PC60BM or PC70BM with thicknesses of about 200 nm were prepared and characterized. The photovoltaic parameters for ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80 nm) under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5 are summarized in Table 1. To fairly compare BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA), we focused on OPVs using BTD–TPA or poly(BTD-TPA):PC60BM at a 1:2 mixing ratio. Fig. 4(a) shows the J–V curves under an AM 1.5 solar-simulated light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, and Fig. 4(b) shows the IPCE spectra of the OPVs. The PCE of the poly(BTD-TPA)-based OPV with a blend ratio of 1:2 was twice as good as that of the BTD–TPA-based OPV with a blend ratio of 1:2. The IPCE was 16% at a wavelength of 500 nm for the BTD–TPA-based OPV and 27% at a wavelength of 520 nm for the poly(BTD-TPA)-based OPV. The relatively high Jsc and PCE of the OPV based on poly(BTD-TPA) are due to the higher hole mobility and enhanced absorption of AM1.5 solar-simulated light of poly(BTD-TPA).

 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves of OPVs prepared with various photoactive layers and (b) IPCE spectra of OPVs. 
As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4, as the PC60BM concentration increased from a poly(BTD-TPA):PC60BM ratio of 1:2 to 1:4, the PCEs of the OPVs based on poly(BTD-TPA) increased by 1.5. Although the electron mobility of the PC60BM-based OFETs was calculated to be 6.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (with a threshold voltage of 9 V and an on/off ratio of 3.6 × 103), which is twenty times higher than the hole mobility of poly(BTD-TPA), increasing the PC60BM concentration in the OPV films led to improved Jsc and PCEs. This result suggests the absence of sufficient percolation paths for electrons to the cathode in the blend film with a low PC60BM concentration, which is due to the good miscibility of poly(BTD-TPA) and PC60BM. The AFM images in Fig. 5 show that all surfaces of the active layers (poly(BTD-TPA):PC60BM = 1:2 and 1:4), which consist of the domains with below 20 nm in diameter, are very similar which indicates good miscibility in these films.

Finally, to obtain the best performance of OPVs using poly(BTD-TPA) as a donor, PC70BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has stronger absorption in the visible region from 400 to 600 nm than PC60BM.37Fig. 4(a) shows the J–V curves of OPVs using poly(BTD-TPA):PC70BM (1:4) with a thickness of 233 nm while Fig. 4(b) shows the IPCE spectra of the OPV. The device exhibited a Jsc of 7.45 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, an FF of 0.39, a PCE of 2.65%, and IPCEs of around 50% at wavelengths ranging from 360 to 560 nm. Considering the significant improvement in the performance of OPVs using poly(BTD-TPA), BTD–TPA-based polymers stand out as a promising candidate for further exploration in OPVs.
4. Conclusion
We investigated the performances of BHJ OPVs incorporating BTD–TPA and poly(BTD-TPA). The PCE of OPV using poly(BTD-TPA):PC60BM (1:2) was twice as good as that of BTD–TPA:PC60BM (1:2). In the case of OPVs with a same device structure fabricated by the same processing conditions, our experimental results reveal that the use of poly(BTD-TPA) was effective for obtaining high-performance OPVs. The field-effect hole mobility of poly(BTD-TPA) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of BTD–TPA and the absorption peak of poly(BTD-TPA) is located at a longer wavelength than that of BTD–TPA; this improved hole mobility and enhanced absorption of AM1.5 solar-simulated light led to high Jsc and PCEs in the poly(BTD-TPA)-based OPVs. For OPVs containing poly(BTD-TPA):PC70BM (1:4), the device exhibited a Jsc of 7.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.92 V, an FF of 0.39, a PCE of 2.65%, and IPCEs of around 50% at wavelengths ranging from 360 to 560 nm. Our experimental results reveal that the use of BTD–TPA polymer was effective for obtaining high-performance OPVs.
