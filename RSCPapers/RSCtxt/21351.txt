    , Accepted 14th January 2018First published on 15th January 2018AbstractThis study examines for the first time the use of an aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen, TPE_RED) as an initiator to prepare red-emitting poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymers, i.e. PMMA_TPE_RED, for the realization of high performance luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). TPE_RED is a photostable red-emitting AIEgen with D–A features and a 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate unit able to initiate the ATRP polymerization of MMA. PMMA_TPE_RED polymers containing 0.98–3.05 wt% of TPE_RED absorb visible light in the range between 400 and 600 nm, and emit fluorescence at around 610–650 nm when aggregated in solution or in the solid state, with a maximum quantum yield (QY) of 26.5%. PMMA_TPE_RED films experience partial fluorescence quenching with the TPE_RED content possibly due to auto-absorption phenomena and the formation of less emissive micro-sized clusters of chromophoric entities. Physical blending of PMMA_TPE_RED with commercially available PMMA provides a film with a smooth texture and LSCs with optical efficiencies of 10% thanks to the superior light harvesting features of the homogeneously distributed AIEgen.
Introduction
Today, the driving force in solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies is lowering the cost per unit of power generated. A PV module costs between 0.8 and 2 Euro per Wp, i.e. bringing the electricity price in some EU countries near ∼0.2 Euro per kWh, but still far off from that of ∼0.04 Euro per kWh from fossil-fuel based power plants.1 Sunlight concentration is a promising path to cost-effective PV technologies. Compared to standard concentrators based on geometrical optics, luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) show several advantages: low weight, high theoretical concentration factors, ability to work well with diffuse light and eventually no need for sun tracking or cooling apparatus. LSCs are slabs of transparent materials doped with a fluorophore.2 The refractive index of the host higher than that of air allows the trapping of a fraction of the emitted photons by means of total internal reflection. Photons are then collected at the edges of the LSC to produce electric power by PV cells. Although this topic has been under discussion since the 1980s, LSC-PV systems have only recently received great impulse thanks to the development of new materials and modern building architectures that have inspired the PV application of colourful windows.3,4 The building-integrated PV market is actually set to steadily increase promoted by the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2010/31/EU, which states that each new building should be made ‘nearly zero energy’ from 2020 onwards.5 The use of plastics and consolidated industrial processes offer encouraging means to include solar energy in the built environment. Nevertheless, LSCs are plagued by critical processes that hinder their ability to deliver light to PV cells, including fluorescence quenching due to dye aggregation.2,6 Recently, research on LSC-PV systems has been focusing on high power conversion efficiencies (PCE)7–9 by enhancing the spectral absorption window of LSCs, i.e. increasing the number of available photons.8,10 Slooff9 described a stacked device with a PCE of 7.1%, which is the highest value ever reported for LSC-PV. Also, dye mixtures in a single slab offer the possibility of cascading of emission via FRET.11,12 Metal complexes,8,13 quantum dots,14–16 and phosphors17 have also been investigated but compatibility issues with host matrices arise. Nevertheless, maximum PCE for LSCs was recorded for PMMA with embedded perylene-based fluorophores.18,19 Lately, LSCs based on NIR-emissive dyes with visible-light transparency have also been proposed,20–22 but a PCE of ∼0.4% is barely reached.22
In the continuous search for novel alternatives to perylene-based fluorophores, we have recently proposed the use of red-emitting aggregation induced emission fluorophores (hereafter AIE) as excellent alternative dopants for LSCs. Indeed, AIE are non-emissive when dissolved in good solvents, but become highly luminescent in poor solvents or in the solid state.23,24 This feature enables AIE to find high-tech applications as chemo-(bio)sensors, and solid-state emitters and in LSCs as well.25–31 The investigated red-emitting AIE (TPE-AC) with a QY of 50% and dispersed in PMMA at a moderate concentration (0.1–1.5 wt%) yielded worthy optical efficiencies of 6.7%.32 Nevertheless, compatibility issues adversely affected the light harvesting features of the LSC thus keeping the device performances below but very close those of the state of the art.
In this contribution, a novel AIE fluorophore (TPE_RED, Fig. 1) was synthesized and utilized as the initiator to prepare red-emitting poly(methyl methacrylate) polymers (PMMA_TPE_RED) via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).33 Notably, ATRP was selected to control the introduction of the fluorophore on the macromolecular backbone to ensure the device phase stability required for maximizing LSC performances.

The light concentration and optical efficiencies of the derived thin films were determined as a function of film composition and thickness and compared with the previously investigated PMMA blend films.

The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate (85:15) as the eluent. The chromatographic fractions containing the required product were collected and concentrated at reduced pressure to give 4 as a yellow solid (0.85 g, 34% yield). GLC analysis showed that 4 had chemical purity higher than 98%. Its spectral properties were in agreement with those previously reported.34

Synthesis of PMMA_TPE_RED polymers
As one example, CuBr (10 mg, 0.07 mmol), TPMA (20 mg, 0.07 mmol), PMDETA (0.106 g, 0.61 mmol), MMA (2 g, 19.9 mmol) and 4 mL anhydrous anisole were introduced into a Schlenk tube and degassed with three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Then, TPE_RED (10 mg, 0.014 mmol) was added, and after three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the polymerization was left to proceed for 24 h at 90 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer was purified by repeated precipitations from chloroform into hexane and then dried at reduced pressure. 0.980 g of a red solid was recovered (yield 49%).
Preparation of PMMA_TPE_RED films
Optically clear glass slides were prepared by cleaning in 6 M HCl for 12 h, rinsing with water, acetone and 2-propanol and then drying for 8 h at 120 °C. As one example, a PMMA_TPE_RED film with a thickness of 25 ± 5 μm (Starrett micrometer) was prepared by pouring about 0.8 mL chloroform (CHCl3) solution containing about 60 mg of the polymer on a 35 × 50 mm glass surface. Solvent evaporation was carried out on a warm plate (30 °C) and in a closed environment. The polymer films were easily removed with a spatula after immersion in water so that they can be stored for successive measurements by attaching them on a 50 × 50 × 3 mm optically pure glass substrate (Edmund Optics Ltd BOROFLOAT window 50 × 50 TS) with a high-purity silicone oil (poly(methylphenyl siloxane), 710 fluid, Aldrich, refractive index n = 1.5365). Absorption and emission properties of such devices showed negligible differences with the freshly prepared ones. The films thickness was adjusted by increasing the amount of the polymer dissolved in solution. In the case of PMMA_TPE_RED/PMMA blend films, appropriate amounts of PMMA were dissolved in the CHCl3 solution in the presence of PMMA_TPE_RED.
Computational analysis
We performed quantum chemical calculations with the G09 suite of programs36 within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The electronic ground state minimum-energy conformations have been optimized at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory37 including an empirical dispersion correction (D3BJ).38 All the excited state properties (i.e. vertical excitation energies, S1 minimum-energy structure and electronic emission) have been characterized with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) exploiting the same triple-ζ polarized basis set and the CAM-B3LYP density functional.39 This level of theory has been proved to be very effective for long-range intra-molecular charge-transfer excitation and excited state properties.40 In order to take into account the chemical environment we employed the polarizable continuum model (PCM) of implicit solvation with the dielectric constant set to that of 1,4-dioxane: for vertical excitation energies in TD-DFT we exploited a non-equilibrium formulation of the PCM self-consistent reaction field, while for emission energies we used the state-specific approach.41
Characterization
GLC analyses were performed on a Dani GC 1000 instrument equipped with a PTV injector using two types of capillary columns: an Alltech AT-35 bonded FSOT column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.) and an Alltech AT-1 bonded FSOT column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.). Purifications by flash chromatography were performed using silica gel Merck 60 (particle size 0.040–0.063 mm). EI-MS spectra were recorded at 70 eV by GLC-MS, performed on an Agilent 6890N gas-chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5973N mass detector. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature at 400 MHz (1H) and 100 MHz (13C), or 200 MHz (1H) and 50.3 MHz (13C) and were referred to TMS or to the residual protons of deuterated solvents. ESI-Q/ToF flow injection analyses (FIA) were carried out using a 1200 Infinity HPLC (Agilent Technologies, USA), coupled to a Jet Stream ESI interface (Agilent) with a Quadrupole-Time of Flight tandem mass spectrometer 6530 Infinity Q-TOF (Agilent Technologies). Two sets of eluents were used: 100% MeOH or 85% H2O and 15% acetonitrile, both added with 1% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.2 mL min−1. Injection volume: 3 mL. The ESI operating conditions were as follows: drying gas (N2, purity >98%), 350 °C and 10 L min−1; capillary voltage 4.5 kV; nebuliser gas 35 psig; and sheath gas (N2, purity >98%), 375 °C and 11 L min−1. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weights and molecular weight dispersion (Mw/Mn) of polymer samples with respect to polystyrene standards. GPC measurements were performed in CHCl3 as a solvent on a four-channel pump PU-2089 Plus chromatograph (Jasco, Easton, MD, USA) equipped with a Jasco RI 2031 Plus refractometer and a multichannel Jasco UV-2077 Plus UV–Vis detector set at 252 and 360 nm. The flow rate was 1 mL min−1 at a temperature of 30 °C held through a Jasco CO 2063 Plus Column Thermostat. A series composed of two PLgel™ MIXED D columns and a PLgel™ precolumn (Polymer Laboratories, Church Stretton, UK) packed with polystyrene-divinylbenzene was used to perform the analysis (linearity range 100 Da–400 kDa).
The thermal behaviour was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere by using a Mettler Toledo StarE system, equipped with a DSC822c module. Films were heated from 25 to 150 °C at 10 °C min−1 (1st heating), cooled to 0 °C at the same scan rate (1st cooling), and then heated again to 150 °C at 10 °C min−1 (2nd heating) after 5 min of annealing.
Spectrophotometric measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer Lambda 650 spectrometer with temperature control to within ±0.1 °C. The chemical composition of polymers was evaluated by UV–Vis spectroscopy by means of a calibration curve obtained from 5 × 10−7–1 × 10−5 CHCl3 solutions of TPE_RED. The fluorescence measurements in solution (with temperature control to within ±0.1 °C) and in the solid state were performed using a Horiba Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog®-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450 W xenon arc lamp and double-grating both excitation and emission monochromators. The emission quantum yields of the solid samples were obtained by means of a 152 mm diameter “Quanta-phi” integrating sphere, coated with Spectralon® and mounted in the optical path of the spectrofluorometer, using as an excitation source the 450 W xenon lamp coupled with a double-grating monochromator for selecting wavelengths. The size distribution of the TPE_RED aggregates was measured in a DMSO/water mixture (5/95 by vol) by means of a Beckman-Coulter Delsa™ Nano C dynamic light scattering at 25 °C. The optical microscope analysis was accomplished on a Reichert Polyvar optical microscope with crossed polarizers.
Optical efficiency measurements
Home-built equipment32,42–44 was used to determine the optical efficiency of LSCs. The optical efficiency is reported as ηopt and obtained from the concentration factor, which is the ratio between the maximal current of the PV cell attached to the LSC edges under illumination of a light source and the maximal current of the bare cell put perpendicular to the light source. In our setup, the QE variation of the PV module is under 2% within the emission range of from 500 nm to 700 nm. The system is composed of a wooden box with darkened walls and a white back scattering layer (ERGA TAPES Srl Microcellular MCPET reflective sheet). The sample holder with the photovoltaic (PV) module (IXYS SLMD121H08L mono solar cell 86 × 14 mm: Voc = 5.04 V, Isc = 50.0 mA, FF > 70%, η = 22%, Fig. S1†) is placed 2.5 cm above the scattering layer.
Details of the experimental set-up were reported in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Synthesis of TPE_RED
The preparation of the ATRP initiator TPE_RED (1) was performed according to a synthetic pathway, summarized in Scheme 1, whose first step consisted of the assembly of the AIE core of the molecule by a McMurry reaction involving bis-(dimethylamino) benzophenone 2 and bromobenzophenone 3, both commercially available, in the presence of TiCl4 and zinc powder.34
 Scheme 1  Synthetic pathway to TPE_RED (1). Reaction reagents and conditions: (i) (a) 2 (5 mmol), 3 (1.3 equiv.), Zn powder (5.7 equiv.), THF, −78 °C; (b) TiCl4 (3.3 equiv.), −78 °C to RT; (c) reflux, 8 h (34%). (ii) (a) 4 (0.50 mmol, 1.1 equiv.), n-BuLi 1.54 M in hexane (1.0 equiv.), THF, −78 °C, 2 h; (b) DMF (11 equiv.), −78 °C to RT, 2 h (48%). (iii) 2-(2-cyanoacetoxy)ethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate (6) (2.0 equiv.), piperidine (3 drops), CH2Cl2, reflux, 24 h (85%). 
The resulting tetraphenylene derivative 4 was then decorated with the ATRP arm by a reaction sequence involving at first the formylation with DMF of the aryllithium derivative obtained from 4 by bromine–lithium exchange at low temperature, followed by a Knoevenagel-type condensation between the aromatic aldehyde 5 so obtained and the cyanoester 6 (Scheme 1). This last compound was easily obtained from 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoyl bromide, ethylene glycol, and cyanoacetic acid following reported synthetic procedures (Scheme 2).35

Optical properties of TPE_RED in solution
TPE_RED shows an absorption maximum at 498 nm (Fig. S4†) with an extinction coefficient of 7.54 × 103 M−1 cm−1 and a faint emission in DMSO solution. At water fractions larger than 80%, TPE_RED aggregates together, thus activating the AIE process and leading to the formation of highly emissive TPE_RED nanoparticles, as confirmed by dynamic light scattering analysis, with fluorescence peaking at 695 nm (Fig. S5 and S6,† respectively). The Stokes shift of about 190 nm is noteworthy and promising for the application of TPE_RED in LSC.
Computational analysis
The electronic properties of the dye were also characterized by means of state-of-the-art DFT calculations. To model the chemical bonding with the polymeric matrix we substituted the –Br with a –CH3 group (DA_TPE depicted in Fig. 2) and we found that the main features of the dye frontier orbitals are not affected by this modification. Vertical excitation energies were computed with TD-DFT considering the chemical environment of the polymer via the PCM.
 Fig. 2  Top panel: The minimum-energy structure of DA_TPE (the Br atom has been substituted by a CH3 group); central and bottom panels: iso-surface densities of DA_TPE HOMO and the LUMO states that are involved in the electronic adsorption and emission processes. 
The computed first transition energy λmax is at 466 nm, in good agreement with experiments, and it involves an electronic excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO (Fig. 2). The nature of these molecular orbitals confirms that the transition corresponds to a charge-transfer from the TPE moiety to the cyanoester group. Upon excitation, the dye undergoes a significant structural reorganization, especially concerning the TPE group where the double bond at its centre goes from an equilibrium distance of 1.368 Å in S0 to the value of 1.440 Å in S1. The predicted value for the S1 → S0 emission is at 647 nm, again in good qualitative agreement with experiments. The structural stabilization of the excited state is responsible for the large Stokes shift of 181 nm.
From the analysis of the MOs involved in these electronic transitions we found that a key structural parameter for the observed behaviour is the rotation across the dihedral angle α depicted in Fig. 2. A relaxed scan of the potential energy surfaces of both ground S0 and excited S1 states was performed by changing the value of α from 0° to 180°. The energies of each intermediate do not differ much from the ground state with a maximum relative energy of ∼0.4 eV, and little higher values in the excited state (∼0.6 eV) as depicted in Fig. S7.† The rotation around α is important because when its value is 90° the transition becomes forbidden, and overall the Stokes shift decreases when the dihedral angle goes from 0°/180° to 90°. This result implies that the dye is most effective when its mobility is limited as in aggregates or embedded in a glassy polymer matrix such as PMMA.
TPE_RED polymerization and main features of polymers
The red-emitting PMMA_TPE_RED polymers were obtained by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methylmethacrylate (MMA) using TPE_RED as an initiator. The feeding ratio of TPE_RED to MMA was varied from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% and the polymerization was conducted under the catalyst system CuBr/TPMA in a solution of anhydrous anisole at 90 °C for 24 h. The resultant PMMA_TPE_RED polymers were purified by repeated precipitations from chloroform into hexane and characterized by standard methods (Table 1).

The chemical structure of polymers was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S8†) with the signals attributed to PMMA only. No quantitative analysis was accomplished with the aromatic signals of the TPE below the signal to noise ratio even at the highest fluorophore content (PMMA_TPE_RED1.5). The TPE_RED amounts in the polymers were therefore determined by UV–Vis spectroscopy by means of a calibration curve obtained from 5 × 10−7–1 × 10−5 M CHCl3 solutions of TPE_RED, that is supposing negligible the variation of its molar extinction coefficient after polymerization. The TPE_RED contents evaluated in the final polymers were found to be twice that introduced in the alimentation (e.g., 3.05 against 1.50 wt% of TPE_RED for the PMMA_TPE_RED1.5, Table 1). This difference was attributed to 50% of MMA monomer conversion calculated at the end of the polymerization. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were studied by GPC (Fig. S9†). As expected, the results reveal that the degree of polymerization of MMA diminished with increasing TPE_RED feeding molar ratio. Notably, the PDI well below 2 for all polymers agrees well with that of typical ATRP systems.45 The glass transition temperature (Tg, Fig. S10† for PMMA_TPE_RED0.75) was determined by DSC analysis and resulted in agreement with that of PMMA polymers with different molecular weights.
As a representative example, PMMA_TPE_RED0.75 shows an absorption maximum at 495 nm and a negligible emission in CHCl3 solution (Fig. 3a).

The values of the mixture dielectric constants are reported in the brackets. Inset: Photographs of the same solutions taken under 365 nm UV light irradiation. PMMA_TPE_RED0.75 concentration: 2 g L−1. 
At hexane (non-solvent) fractions larger than 80%, PMMA_TPE_RED aggregates together, thus again activating the AIE process. At 95% hexane content, the emission intensity is about 40 fold higher than that in the pure CHCl3 solution with fluorescence peaking spanning from 618 to 607 nm with decreasing solution dielectric constant (Fig. 3a and b). Notwithstanding the extent of blue-shift (11 nm), PMMA_TPE_RED aggregates still maintain a Stokes shift larger than 110 nm.
Optical properties of films
PMMA_TPE_RED films with a thickness of 25 ± 5 μm (Starrett micrometer) were prepared by pouring about 0.8 mL chloroform (CHCl3) solution containing about 60 mg of the polymer. PMMA_TPE_RED films show (Fig. 4a) molecular absorption maxima at 480 nm with a broad absorption band from 425–550 nm that appears worthwhile for light harvesting in the visible range.
 Fig. 4  (a) UV–Vis absorption and (b) emission spectra of PMMA_TPE_RED films as a function of fluorophore content. In the inset of (a), the absorbance maximum is plotted as a function of the TPE_RED content in the polymer (see Table 1). In the inset of (b), the QY values are reported for the corresponding film. Film thickness of 25 ± 5 μm. 
Notably, the absorbance increases linearly with the fluorophore content on passing from PMMA_TPE_RED0.5 to PMMA_TPE_RED1.5, thus possibly excluding the formation of π–π staking phenomena among the TPE_RED chromophores. By contrast, PMMA_TPE_RED films show emission features that depend on the fluorophore concentration (Fig. 4b). PMMA_TPE_RED0.5, i.e. the polymer with the lowest TPE_RED content (0.98 wt%, Table 1), shows bright emission peaked at 650 nm with a significant Stokes shift of 170 nm that is quite similar to that of DMSO/water mixtures (190 nm). This emission band appears optimal for LSCs since it superimposes well with the maximum external quantum efficiency of the utilized Si-based PV cell (Fig. S1†). Notably, fluorescence decreasing occurred with the TPE_RED content higher than 1 wt%, and levelled off to about half of the initial emission intensity for PMMA_TPE_RED1.0 (2.04 wt% of TPE_RED) and PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 (3.05 wt% of TPE_RED) films. The quantum yield (QY) of the polymer films was also determined (Fig. 4b, inset) and confirmed this trend. QY was maximum for the lowest TPE_RED content, i.e. around 28% for PMMA_TPE_RED0.5, and experienced a progressive decline with the fluorophore content up to about 16% for PMMA_TPE_RED1.5. In the literature, it has already been reported that aggregation caused quenching can also occur in AIE systems under certain conditions. In fact, fluorescence quenching is reported for highly conjugated donor–acceptor AIEgens and attributed to solute molecules that quickly agglomerate in a random way to form less emissive supramolecular (amorphous) chromophoric aggregates.46–48 This behaviour can also occur when poor compatible AIEgens are segregated from the supporting polymer matrix, as recently published by our group.32 Nevertheless, the progressive red-shift of the emission band with increasing TPE_RED content may suggest the occurrence of auto-absorption phenomena that adversely affect the overall fluorescence of the materials.32,49
Optical microscopy was then used to determine the resulting film morphology. Notably, the optical micrograph of the PMMA_TPE_RED0.5 film (Fig. 5a) shows a surface with a quite smooth texture and low roughness.
 Fig. 5  Optical microscopy images of (a) PMMA_TPE_RED0.50, (b) PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 and a PMMA/PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 with a 1 wt% nominal content of TPE_RED. 
Conversely, a substantial number of micro-sized clusters of chromophoric entities emerged at the highest TPE_RED content (PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 film, Fig. 5b), thus possibly affecting the overall luminescence response of the film.50 This phenomenon can be attributed to the reduced molecular weight of PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 (i.e. 36400 g mol−1 with respect to 201300 for PMMA_TPE_RED0.5, Table 1), which possibly favours TPE_RED segregation in isolated islands. Aimed at identifying and resolving this issue a PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 film was mixed with 50 wt% of commercially available high molecular weight PMMA to obtain a blend film with the same thickness and a TPE_RED content of about 1 wt% (50 wt% PMMA/PMMA_TPE_RED1.5). It is worth noting that the film texture appears remarkably homogeneous without the typical roughness conferred by the chromophoric clusters (Fig. 5c), thus confirming the beneficial effect of the PMMA long macromolecular chains. It was worth noting that the QY calculated for the 50 wt% PMMA/PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 film was 27.6%, i.e. higher than 26.5% of PMMA_TPE_RED0.5 containing the same 1 wt% of the TPE_RED fluorophore. Notably, this difference is reliable being the standard error of the QY below 0.5%.
Optical efficiencies
The performances of PMMA_TPE_RED polymers as LSCs were assessed as films with a thickness of 25 ± 5 μm coated over an optically pure 50 × 50 × 3 mm glass.
Photocurrent measurements were accomplished with home-built apparatus by using a Si-based PV cell attached on one edge of the LSC (see Experimental part). The optical efficiency ηopt was determined as the ratio between the concentration factor C and the geometrical factor G of LSC (i.e., G = 16.6) (eqn (1)): (1)where C is the ratio between the short circuit current measured in the case of the cell over the collector edge (ILSC) and the short circuit current of the PV cell when perpendicular to the light source (ISC) and G is the ratio between the area exposed to the light source and the collecting area. The data are reported in Table 1 and compared to those collected with the same experimental setup for the recently investigated PMMA films containing dispersed red-emitting fluorophores. Notably, C and ηopt decrease as a function of TPE_RED content, possibly due to the occurrence of dissipative phenomena and in agreement with fluorescence quantum yields (Fig. 4b, inset). Notably, the progressive formation of less emissive TPE_RED assemblies counterbalances the effect provided by the increased number of available chromophores that are able to harvest and concentrate light to the Si-based PV cell. Nevertheless, PMMA_TPE_RED LSCs showed a maximum optical efficiency (7.05) higher than that calculated for the previously investigated PMMA blend films containing the same concentration of red-emitting fluorophores. More specifically, the substantial difference in the light concentration between PMMA_TPE_RED and TPE-AC/PMMA LSCs suggests that the covalent approach proposed in this work is effective at limiting the adverse dissipative phenomena caused by compatibility issues between the fluorophore and the polymer. This feature was also effective at providing optical efficiencies higher than those calculated for PMMA films containing a moderate concentration (<1.5 wt%) of Lumogen F Red 305 (LR) that is considered the state-of-the-art for LSCs.42,51
Furthermore, the effect of polymer thickness on the concentration efficiency of LSCs was also investigated (Fig. 6, Table 2).

PMMA_TPE_RED0.5 films with 30 μm of thickness and about 1 wt% of TPE_RED were found to display the best trade-off for maximizing fluorophore content in the LSC without adversely affecting its overall efficiency. The maximum optical efficiency of 7.91 apparently decreased to 7.14 for 35 μm thick films, possibly due to more probable dissipative dye–dye interactions caused by the larger mean path length of the emitted radiation.
It is worth noting that the 30 μm thick PMMA/PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 blend film with a 1 wt% content of TPE_RED showed the highest optical efficiency of 10%, possibly due to the substantial reduction of fluorophore segregation provided by the PMMA blending, as evidenced by optical microscopy (Fig. 5c). This value is the highest ever registered in our laboratory with the same apparatus and LSC geometrical factor,13,32,42–44,49 thus confirming that the strategy of using well compatible and homogeneously distributed red-emitting AIE fluorophores is powerful for gaining high performance LSCs.
Photostability tests were eventually performed by continuously illuminating a 0.25 cm2 area of the PMMA_TPE_RED1.5 film at its absorption peak (i.e. 490 nm) with a 450 W Xe arc lamp under aerobic conditions. It was worth noting that the film retained 97% of its emission after three hours of continuous excitation (Fig. S11†). Notably, this behaviour suggested an excellent photostability, which makes TPE_RED a solid alternative to perylene-based fluorophores for LSC applications.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that TPE_RED, a photostable red-emitting AIEgen with D–A features, can initiate the ATRP polymerization of MMA to provide polymer films suitable for the preparation of LSCs. PMMA_TPE_RED films showed fluorescence that peaked in the range of 610–650 nm with a max QY of 26.5% for the film containing the lowest TPE_RED content (0.98 wt%). PMMA_TPE_RED films with higher fluorophore concentration were adversely affected by auto-absorption phenomena and the formation of less emissive micro-sized clusters of fluorophores. Notably, the film surface was rendered smooth and uniform after blending PMMA_TPE_RED polymers with commercially available PMMA, which in turn results in increased emission efficiency. Nevertheless, PMMA_TPE_RED LSCs showed optical efficiencies higher than those calculated for the previously investigated PMMA blend films containing the same concentration of red-emitting AIE fluorophores and with the same thickness. This result confirmed the beneficial covalent approach in effectively limiting the adverse dissipative phenomena caused by compatibility issues between the fluorophore and the polymer. In agreement with this consideration, well homogeneous PMMA/PMMA_TPE_RED blend films showed the highest optical efficiency of 10%, that is the highest ever registered in our laboratory. Future approaches for ηopt enhancement should adopt new synthetic strategies focused on improving AIE fluorophore distribution within the macromolecular backbone aimed at increasing QY values for high fluorophore content. Regardless of that, all findings consistently support the effective use of red-emitting AIEgens in the realization of high performance LSCs.
