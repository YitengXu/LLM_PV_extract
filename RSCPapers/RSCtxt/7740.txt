    , Accepted 1st November 2020First published on 2nd November 2020AbstractHere we report on hydrogen and oxygen evolution on electrodeposited nickel electrodes enhanced by mesoporosity and magnetics. Mesoporous and bulk Ni films were electrodeposited from simple sulphate solutions with and without lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) templates formed by the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The mesoporous microstructure increases the electrochemical surface area 20-fold relative to the bulk films. In the first instance, this improves the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reaction performances significantly on mesoporous (MP) Ni electrodes, but only to a limited degree owing to the substantial surface deactivation of nickel and surface coverage during water splitting in alkaline media. The water splitting process is further enhanced by magnetisation on both bulk and mesoporous Ni electrodes, as evidenced by the reduced onset potential, over-potential, and Tafel slope, as well as by the increased exchange current density; these effects are stronger in the perpendicular magnetisation direction owing to the ordinary magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effect. However, MP-Ni electrodes exhibit extraordinary performance with respect to ordinary MHD, which was attributed to the creation of high-gradient magnetic force (HGMF). The maximum HER performance of the magnetised MP-Ni electrodes demonstrates a remarkable improvement, e.g. ηOER = 340.0 mV, which is comparable with more complex nanomaterials, e.g. hybrid metal oxides, whereas their maximum OER performance, e.g. ηOER = 296.0 mV, comes very close to those of noble metal electrodes, e.g. Ru2O. Our calculations based on a simple nanotubular nickel structure show that MP-Ni creates magnetic gradients of the order of 107 T m−1. This magnitude of magnetic force is sufficient to promote effective attractive/repulsive forces on ions and gas bubbles as well as the dissociation of diamagnetic water molecules, enhancing the HER and OER during water splitting during electrolysis. Our present remarkably enhanced water electrolysis device, achieved using magnetized mesoporous nickel, represents a very sophisticated and low-cost electrode material choice to replace costly electrocatalysts in water splitting.
Introduction
With the growing crises of environmental pollution and energy, researchers have devoted great efforts towards sustainability and clean energy production. Clean energy and its integration with infrastructure for storage and transportation can only be achieved by the production of appropriate fuels.1 These demands make hydrogen an ideal and environmentally friendly fuel carrier for replacing fossil-based energy owing to its greenhouse-gas-free energy release processes,2 as well as an ideal energy source candidate for the future owing to its high energy density (142 MJ kg−1).3 This would help to overcome the intermittent production of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, and provide high-energy-density fuel for transportation and storage.
Low-cost electrochemical water electrolysis is considered to be a sustainable approach for hydrogen production using renewable energy sources. However, efficient hydrogen production using unstable renewable energy sources is challenging. At present, 90% of the world's hydrogen is produced by the reformation of fossil fuels, which consumes a great deal of energy and is associated with carbon dioxide emissions. Water electrolysis is considered to be one of the most efficient, fast and reliable methods of producing very pure hydrogen and oxygen from renewable energies to store energy at the grid scale because water electrolysis at room temperature is a scalable technology. The only requirements of this process are water and energy in the form of electricity.4
Both the half-reactions of electrochemical water splitting, i.e. the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), are important to its overall efficiency. In the water electrolysis process, a theoretical voltage difference of 1.23 V is required to conduct the HER and OER.5 In fact, a relatively higher potential is generally applied in commercial electrolyzers because of the high overpotentials of the HER and OER. Noble metal catalysts (Pt-group metals for HER6 and Ru- and Ir-based compounds for OER7) are commonly used as electrodes to overcome these high overpotentials. New cost-efficient catalysts, such as transition-metal-based catalysts (e.g. nickel8 and cobalt9), are being suggested as alternatives to improve the power consumption of water electrolyzers.10 Furthermore, other techniques have also been developed, such as the application of magnetic fields on electrodes, which imposes magnetohydrodynamic effects.11–13
Nickel and nickel alloys are ideal non-noble electrode materials for the HER and OER in alkaline electrolytes. Nickel is reasonably affordable and exhibits good corrosion resistance and high water electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes.14–17 Electrochemical water splitting on nickel requires a highly acidic or alkaline solution to reduce the overpotentials required for the reduction reactions. In addition, the use of nickel as a bi-functional catalyst for the HER and OER can simplify the electrolyser system and therefore further reduce costs.18 Attempts have been made to realise Ni-based electrocatalysts with large active surface areas and the ability for H2 and O2 bubbles to readily detach from their surface, e.g. rough NiCoP nanowires/nanofoam,19 ultrathin Ni nanosheets,20 nickel nanocones,21 dendrite-structure Ni22 and Ni with hierarchical morphology,23 which exhibit superior activity towards the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The development of porous nickel films has been a breakthrough towards a plausible advance for highly electroactive electrode applications. Ganesh and Lakshminarayanan24 studied the use of porous Ni films having a minimum particle size (or pore size) of 29.1 nm electrodeposited from a hexagonal liquid crystalline phase of water–Triton X-100/polyacrylic acid for supercapacitors as well as hydrogen-evolving cathodes. Further improvement was also demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of nickel into three dimensionally (3D) ordered mesoporous (with a pore size range of 3–5 nm) Ni sphere (diameter of ∼290 nm) arrays for use as the electrocatalyst, which exhibited higher OER activity, more favourable kinetics and higher durability than nickel nanoparticles and superior catalysts (e.g. RuO2). The high electrocatalytic performance of the mesoporous nickel was attributed to its unique hierarchical 3D interconnected porous structure with an enlarged surface area, high structural stability, and improved mass/charge transport.25 However, the mesoporous nickel electrodes prepared via this method were realised through a multi-step and complex fabrication method including (i) preparation and removal of opal (colloidal crystals) consisting of 3D ordered silica spheres used as the initial template to synthesize poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) inverse opal, (ii) preparation of lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) of the nonionic surfactant, i.e. Brij 58 (C16H33(OCH2CH2)20OH), as the meso-structural template, (iii) infiltration and filling of the void space of the PMMA inverse opal with LLC containing Ni2+ ions, and (iv) subsequent chemical reduction of the Ni2+ ions by dimethylamine borane (DMAB) to deposit Ni and subsequent removal of the templates (PMMA inverse opal and Brij 58). We have recently demonstrated a simple method for the fabrication of mesoporous nickel films with well-arranged pore structure and high surface area by direct one-step electrodeposition from LLC containing Ni2+ ions.26
Despite the extremely high electroactive surface area of mesoporous electrode surfaces, which is suitable for high hydrogen production rates, the rates of the HER or OER encounter limiting factors. It is anticipated that the electrode surface will be covered by the growth of gas bubbles, and therefore, the active electrode sites will be reduced. This results in very high overpotentials being required in order for current to flow through the remaining active surface.37 Therefore, it is essential to reduce either the coverage of the electrode by bubbles or the bubble-induced void fraction between the two electrodes in order to minimize bubble-related deficiencies and achieve higher efficiency and hydrogen production rates.11 One possibility is to apply an external magnetic field during the electrode processes. The forced convection imposed by the application of the Lorentz force, fL = j × B, where j is the current density and B is magnetic induction, can be employed to enhance the bubble separation from the electrode and thereby reduce the fractional bubble rate. The current produced by the Lorentz forces is generally interpreted using the magneto-hydrodynamic effect (MHD).27–30 Furthermore, localized convection, known as micro-MHD, can be induced close to a bubble due to the nonhomogeneous current distribution, which in turn induces localized convection in the vicinity of bubbles.12
Regarding the effect of MHD and micro-MHD on electrochemical water electrolysis, several reports demonstrated that both the bubble size and the fractional bubble coverage on flat electrodes were reduced using magnetic fields, irrespective of the direction in which they were applied.12,31–35 However, micro-MHD creates a convection whirlpool around the bubble, which aligns the direction of the convection at the top of the bubble rather than at the bottom of the bubble. The convection at the top and bottom of the bubbles changes the pressure at the top and bottom of the bubble and creates a high lifting force perpendicular to the electrode surface, which removes the bubble from the electrode surface. It should be noted that each bubble has its own micro-MHD.11,12 Furthermore, some numerical studies of the effect of magnetic fields on water electrolysis parameters on micro-porous electrodes have been published. The numerical calculations showed that the MHD in porous media exhibits different types of flow patterns,36 which depend on the electrical properties of the porous material or the surrounding domain and the orientation and strength of the magnetic field. Liu et al.37 showed that, if a porous electrode was used in the electrolysis of water for hydrogen evolution, the cell voltage could be reduced to less than 2.5% at a current density of 130 A m−2 even if the magnetic field was perpendicular to the electrode surface. Furthermore, the lower current density reduces the larger voltage across the current range. The simulation result showed that although the current is parallel to the magnetic field, the Lorentz force is still induced within the porous structure due to the electric field distortion around the ribs of the porous structure, and the Lorentz-force-induced flow within the microstructure plays the role of expelling microbubbles from the pores of the porous structure. In addition to the effect of homogenous magnetic fields, another quantifiable phenomenon occurs under the effect of inhomogeneous magnetic fields via the propagation of magnetic field gradients. This effect is pronounced for micro- and nano-magnets, which exhibit extremely high magnetic field gradients (HGMFs). One possibility to create high magnitudes of magnetic gradient is to use small magnets and/or to operate in the vicinity of the magnet edges. HGMFs are greatly based on the effect of the scale reduction, and therefore, micro- and nanomagnets exhibit large magnetic gradient forces.38 Indeed, numerical demonstrations of HGMFs have been developed in depth for many different magnetic bodies,39 which can be extended for to nanotubular structures or could exist in electrodeposited films with a mesoporous structure.26 The important point here is the interaction between the magnetic forces and ions/gas bubbles, which obeys the rules of magnetism. Atoms or molecules whose electrons are paired, such as hydrogen gas, are classified as diamagnetic materials. Diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields. In contrast, substances with an unpaired electron, like H+ ions, are paramagnetic and are attracted to a magnetic field.40 There have been many studies of the development of magnetic separation of fluids based on their diamagnetic or paramagnetic nature using magnetic field gradient forces.41 For instance, the application of a magnetic field, irrespective of its orientation, has been shown to induce strong effects on the HER and OER via electrolysis. The external magnetic field induces a Lorentz force on the water molecules, which are diamagnetic. The electrons of the water molecules are forced to circulate, forming eddy currents. These eddy currents produce an induced magnetic field in the opposite direction to the applied field. This magnetic field with the opposite direction creates a repulsive force. The hydrogen bonds of water molecules subjected to this repulsive force stretch and break down.13
This study aims to overcome the insufficient electrocatalytic activity of Ni electrocatalysts and more importantly, their progressive deactivation during continuous water splitting in alkaline media due to the reversible production of nickel hydrides.42 We demonstrate the effect of magnetic electrochemistry and its effects including MHD and HGMF on the HER/OER on nickel mesoporous electrodes in an alkaline 6.0 M potassium hydroxide solution, which is useful for electrolysers. Mesoporous Ni electrodes were electrodeposited as a soft ferromagnetic metal in which HGMF due to inhomogeneous magnetic fields is created under the application of a homogenous external magnetic field. To best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the effects of HGMF created by mesoporous nickel electrodes for the HER/OER for electrolyser applications. We observed that while the mesoporous structure has a significantly positive effect on the electrocatalytic properties of nickel films owing to its high surface activity, the very steep magnetic field gradients, defined as the gradient of the magnetic flux density (∇B) produced in the mesoporous film, could strongly enhance the reaction rates. This process eliminates the current shortcomings in water electrolysis using non-noble metal electrodes and is proposed as a complementary and economical tool for future electrodes for highly efficient industrial water electrolysis.
Experimental
Materials
Analytical grade cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), nickel sulphate (NiSO4·6H2O), boric acid (H3BO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Merck and used without any further treatment or purification. All solutions were prepared with deionized water. Commercially available copper foils and platinum (Pt) wire-shaped electrodes were used as the electrodes.
Electrodeposition and structural characterisation of mesoporous nickel films
The electrodeposition of mesoporous Ni films was carried out according to the procedure explained in our previous work.43 The galvanostatic electrodeposition was conducted in a two electrode cell comprising (i) a cathode: a copper sheet with a thickness of 2 mm (99.9%) with a total surface area of 0.68 cm2 and (ii) an anode: a Ni foil with dimensions of 25 × 25 × 5 mm3. A DC power supply (model MASTECH HY30001E) was employed to apply current. In order to electrodeposit nickel films on copper, sulphate electrolytes (Ni2SO4 0.1 M and H3BO3 0.5 M) containing 0.0 and 30.0% wt CTAB surfactant was used for bulk (B) and mesoporous (MP) nickel, respectively. 30.0% wt CTAB was employed to produce lipotropic liquid crystals (LLC) as the soft template to be filled by Ni during electrodeposition. According to the CTAB phase diagram, the solution contains spherical micelles just below the critical micelle concentration (CMC), which is about 1 mM for CTAB. However, the micelles turn into hexagonal arrays at concentrations above this value. The hexagonal array is randomly oriented and exhibits an isotropic solution.43 Due to this phenomenon, the surfaces of the cavities have different angles to the surface ratio, and in the presence of fields, different angles are created between the current density and the magnetic flux. The electrodeposition was conducted to obtain a nominal coating thickness of 2.3 μm as estimated according to Faraday's law.
The morphology and structure of the electrodeposited mesoporous Ni films were characterised by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN-Mira 3). The surface porosity and its distribution were analysed graphically from the FESEM images using the software ImageJ, version 2.0.0.
Electrochemical activity and alkaline water electrolysis
A typical three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a computer-controlled potentiostat (model OrigaFlex-OGF500) was used to examine the electrochemical behaviour. Ni films electrodeposited under different conditions served as the working electrode. A platinum (Pt) wire-shaped electrode was utilised as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was employed as the reference electrode.
The active electrochemical surface area was determined using cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammograms of electrodeposited mesoporous Ni film electrodes were recorded in 0.5 M NaOH solution at a potential range between −0.2 and −1.3 V vs. SCE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The area under each curve was calculated to estimate the charge associated with the Ni to Ni(OH)2 conversion, which was subsequently used to calculate the active surface area of the samples.
The electrochemical water electrolysis experiments including the HER and OER were performed in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni films for both the HER and OER were evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The potential sweep rate for the LSV tests was adjusted at 1 mVs−1. Table S1 in the ESI† summarises the parameters of the electrochemical tests employed. The potentials measured against the standard calomel electrode (SCE) were converted to the reservable hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using eqn (1). ERHE = ESCE + 0.059pH + E0SCE(1)
where E0SCE is 0.245 V. In general, the overpotential of electrodes is defined as the difference between the applied potential required to conduct a stable electrode reaction and its reversible potential (usually called equilibrium).44 For our study, the HER and OER have reversible potentials of 0 and 1.23 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), respectively. Therefore, we employed the equations the corresponding HER (ηHER) and OER (ηOER) overpotentials defined as the difference between the applied potential and the corresponding equilibrium potentials according to: ηOER = ERHE − 1.23 VandηHER = ERHE − 0.0 Vto calculate the overpotentials for the OER and HER, respectively. By this means, we obtained the OER and HER overpotentials at a critical current density, considered as 10 mA cm−2, without iR compensation. Potentials were reported as ERHE in order to represent any polarization plots.
The electrochemical cell was designed so that the external homogenous magnetic field could be applied during the electrochemical tests in two configurations relative to the electrode surface, namely, perpendicular and parallel to the flat working electrode surface (Fig. 1). It is worth mentioning that in our electrochemical cell set-up, the direction of the external magnetic field is opposite to that of the electrical field, and therefore all definitions of magnetohydrodynamics will apply. In both configurations, a homogeneous magnetic field was applied by a homemade electromagnet capable of applying magnetic flux densities up to μ0H = 0.2 T.

Results and discussion
Morphology and surface area of the electrodeposited nickel electrodes
Mesoporous (MP) and bulk (B) Ni films were electrodeposited from simple sulphate solutions with lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) templates formed by the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Fig. 2. The morphology and micro-structural analysis performed on the electrodeposited MP-Ni films are shown in Fig. 2a. Mesoporosity was developed inside the granules of the MP-Ni films, as shown schematically in Fig. 2b. The mesoporous films were relatively rough and exhibit good adhesion to the substrate surface (Fig. 2a). We carried out extensive transmission electron microscopy studies of MP-Ni films electrodeposited under the same conditions, and reported them elsewhere previously.26 A field-emission SEM micrograph was used along with a graphical analysis to extract the pore size distribution curve, shown in Fig. 2b, which clearly reflects the mesoporous nature in addition to our SEM micrographs and schematic images in Fig. 2a and c. The graphical demonstration shown in Fig. 2b and the pore size histogram shown in Fig. 2d demonstrate that the average pore size is ∼4.5 nm and that nearly 80 percent of the pores have a diameter in the range of 2 to 8 nm, consistent with our previous work.26

Fig. 3 shows typical cyclic voltammograms of the electrodeposited bulk and mesoporous Ni films in 0.5 M NaOH solution and the corresponding electrochemical active surface area (ESCA). An oxidation peak as characteristic of the passivation of nickel to nickel hydroxide/oxyhydroxide (Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) is observed,46 which shifts towards higher current densities for the MP Ni electrodes. The significant increase of the current associated with the oxidation peak leads to higher ESCA. The peaks in this potential range were related to the reversible electro-oxidation process of Ni (eqn (2)): Ni + 2OH− ↔ αNi(OH)2 + 2e− ↔ NiOOH(2)

The charge associated with the formation of a monolayer of αNi(OH)2 on the Ni electrode is about 514 C cm−2. Accordingly, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the electrodeposited Ni electrodes was calculated and is plotted in the inset to Fig. 3. The mesoporous nickel exhibits a much greater electrochemical surface area than the bulk electrodeposited nickel film owing to its very significantly high porosity. Based on the ECSAs, it is observed that the obtained ECSA of mesoporous nickel is about 20 times greater than that of bulk-Ni (inset to Fig. 3).
Comparing mesoporous and bulk nickel electrodes for the HER and OER in the absence of a magnetic field

HER performance. 
The HER activities of the mesoporous nickel electrocatalysts were investigated in an alkaline medium of 6.0 M KOH. The overpotential at 10 mA cm2 was considered as the criterion for the evaluation of the HER performance. Fig. 4a shows typical linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of the HER on B-Ni and MP-Ni electrodes. All electrodes exhibit a small peak ranging from −100 to −150 mV vs. RHE as shown in the inset to Fig. 4a marked by an arrow, depending on the electrode type, which corresponds to the proton reduction reaction.12 The proton reduction peak is followed by a sharp increase in the current density related to the water decomposition reaction.12 The bulk electrodeposited Ni electrode (without a mesoporous structure) exhibits an overpotential of 463.0 mV at which hydrogen is evolved with a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This indicates a low HER activity. However, the overpotential required to achieve the current density criterion decreases for the MP-Ni electrodes. It is evident that the performance of the HER on the MP-Ni electrode is improved because its HER overpotential decreases by 86 mV with respect to bulk Ni, reaching 376.4 mV, indicating a definite improvement of 18.7% for mesoporous nickel compared to bulk electrodeposited nickel films. Table 1 summarizes the parameters of the HER obtained from the LSV experiments. The sharp difference observed between the electrocatalytic activity of the two Ni electrodes can only be explained by the effect of the increased surface sites owing to the increased electrochemically active area demonstrated in Fig. 3.47,48

The Tafel plot, i.e., the overpotential (η) versus log(j), is generally used to illustrate the electrocatalytic mechanism and the kinetic behavior of the HER process. In general, there are three controlling reactions involved, namely, the Volmer reaction (slope is 118.2 mV dec−1), the Heyrovsky reaction (39.4 mV dec−1), and the Tafel reaction (29.6 mV dec−1).49Fig. 4b exhibits the Tafel plots of the bulk and MP Ni electrodes measured in the alkaline medium 6.0 M KOH. The Tafel slope for the Mp-Ni electrode, 126 mV dec−1, is smaller than that for bulk Ni, 160 mV dec−1, demonstrating that the HER occurs on both electrodes through a Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway, but the Tafel slope of the MP-Ni electrodes here cannot be solely due to the Volmer step. It must originate from either the Volmer or the Heyrovsky mechanism with high adsorbed hydrogen atom coverage. It has been demonstrated in the literature that such a Tafel slope corresponds to the Heyrovsky mechanism in the higher coverage region.50 This high percentage of the coverage region is due to the large number of electrochemical sites of MP-Ni electrodes according to CA and CV analyses. These results suggest that the transfer of electrons from nickel to nickel hydroxide favors the adsorption of OH− from H2O dissociation on Ni (δ+) and H adsorption on nearby nickel hydroxide (δ−) sites.51
Mugheri et al.49 reported that the Tafel slopes of Pt/C, NiO and Co3O4 electrocatalysts are 86, 100 and 139 mV dec−1, respectively. It is evident that the Tafel slope achieved here for the MP-Ni electrodes are close to that of NiO, which is better than that of cobalt oxides. The exchange current densities calculated by the Butler–Volmer equation and the Tafel slope are summarised in Table 1. As is evident from the data, the mesoporous structure of the nickel electrodes increases the exchange current density of HER by a factor of 150%. The values of exchange current density and Tafel slope for the different nickel structures are shown in Table 1. For comparison, we have summarised electrokinetic data reported in other studies, including Tafel slopes, in Table S2 in the ESI.†
The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the electrodeposited Ni electrodes were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. CVs recorded for higher number of cycles are shown in Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI.†Fig. 5a shows the current densities measured on the two types of Ni electrodes at an applied potential of −0.6 V vs. RHE as a function of the cycle number. In the first cycle, the peak current density of MP Ni is 15 times greater than that of bulk nickel. In this first cycle, the current density reaches its peak at −0.6 V vs. RHE, after which it gradually decreases in subsequent cycles. This reduction is very likely due to the resistance caused by the formation of hydrogen bubbles on the catalyst surface.22 After 20 cycles, stable CV curves were obtained due to the equilibrium between hydrogen bubble formation and detachment. For the catalyst of an evolving gas, the bubbles attached to the surface of the catalyst block the formation of active sites for subsequent reactions. After the bubbles grow to a critical size, they are removed from the surface.17,23 The critical radius is mainly determined by the wettability of the surface, which is strongly affected by the surface roughness, which in the present case corresponds to the ESCAs of the Ni electrodes.14 As is evident from Fig. 5a, the current decay ratio in subsequent cycles decreased from −71% for the bulk nickel to −31% for the MP-Ni electrodes. This shows the lower tendency of MP-Ni electrocatalyst to be covered with the bubble very likely due to the more hydrophilic surface created by the higher roughness.9

The inset in panel (b) is a magnification of the initial section. 
Chronoamperometry (CA) was performed to examine the stability and performance of the electrodes and to produce hydrogen at a constant potential of −0.6 V vs. RHE (−1.6 V vs. SCE) for 1200 s. The recorded chronoamperograms are shown in Fig. 5b. Both the examined electrodes showed their highest current density in the initial period before about 500 seconds, after which the current density slowly decreased. This phenomenon is related to the formation of the hydrogen bubbles mentioned above.22,43 As can be seen from Fig. 5b, MP nickel increases the current density of the HER by 377% after 1200 s due to its greater number of electrochemically active sites as confirmed by the ECSA measurement, Fig. 3.
To gain further insight into the electron transfer kinetics during the HER process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed (Fig. 6a). Fitted results for the EIS data are given in Table 2. The impedance spectra were obtained at an applied potential of −0.4 V vs. RHE between 1 kHz and 1 Hz to study the HER process.

The electrical equivalent circuits achieved with the best fitting ratio corresponding to each electrocatalyst are shown in Fig. 6c for the MP-Ni electrode and Fig. 6d for the bulk Ni electrodes. The parameters are as follows: Rs is the resistance of the solution, Rct is the charge transfer resistance for the reaction occurring at the working electrode, Q1 in Fig. 6d (and in Fig. 9c, which will be illustrated in the next section) and Q2 in Fig. 6c are a constant phase element (CPE) related to the double layer capacitance of the working electrode, which shows the dispersion effect, Q1 in Fig. 6c is the CPE related to the solution in mesopores, Rp is the mass transfer resistance of the adsorbed intermediate Hads, which is also knows as the pseudo-resistance, and R2 in Fig. 6c is the solution resistance in the mesopores.
CPE elements are used for the analysis of EIS data to account for the surface heterogeneity of real systems as well as the distribution of the time constant on the electrode surface. The impedance of a CPE is given by eqn (3), (3)where Q0 is the pseudo-capacitance, ω is the angular frequency, i is equal to , and n is an empirical constant between 0 and 1. The CPE is a pure capacitor when n = 1. The effective capacitance, C, can then be obtained from eqn (4),49 C = R1−n/nQ01/n(4)
Two distinct equivalent electrical circuits were fitted to the experimental EIS data obtained for the HER performance of the bulk and MP-Ni electrodes because the electrodes exhibited different behaviors. The semi-circles in the Nyquist plots recorded for MP-Ni are imperfect with distortion in the low-frequency region of the curves, demonstrating an inductive loop. This distorted feature has been attributed to the adsorption–desorption processes on the surface leading to different equivalent circuits. During the HER process, the deposition–detachment of a number of surface films such as NiOx and α-Ni(OH)2 occurs; this is more pronounced for the meso-porous Ni electrodes because they provide remarkably greater surface active areas. Furthermore, the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct = 2.735) was observed for the MP-Ni electrode, which is far smaller than that of bulk Ni (Rct = 14.43), indicating its rapid charge transfer rate during the electrochemical reactions. This result reveals that the excellent HER activity of the mesoporous nickel can be achieved because of its high electrochemical active area, hierarchically mesoporous hollow architecture and lower charge transfer resistance.44,45 The mesoporous structure of the MP-Ni electrodes reduces the charge transfer resistance by 81%.


OER performance. 
The LSV curves of the bulk electrodeposited nickel electrode showed the lowest oxidative current density amongst all the electrodes studied within the test potential region shown in Fig. 7a. However, the anodic current density of the electrodeposited Ni electrodes increases with increasing applied overpotential. At a given current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials (relative to the thermodynamic equilibrium potential of the OER, 1.23 V vs. RHE) of the bulk Ni nickel and mesoporous nickel electrodes were measured as 462.9 and 366.6 mV, respectively (Table 3). This result indicates that the mesoporous nickel showed much better electrocatalytic performance. Each curve features an oxidation peak that falls within the potential range of 1200 to 1360 mV (vs. RHE) depending on the type of Ni electrode, which is attributed to the formation of Ni(III) (Fig. 7a inset).55

The exchange current densities calculated by the Butler–Volmer equation and the Tafel slope are also summarised in Table 3. The exchange density of mesoporous nickel was recorded to be nine times higher than that of bulk Ni nickel.
Tafel slopes of both bulk and MP-Ni electrodes were achieved 193.7 and 189.7 mV dec−1, respectively, demonstrating that the oxygen evolution reaction occurs on both electrocatalysts through a Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway (Fig. 7b). For comparison, the common electrodes RuO3, Co3O4 and NiO have Tafel slopes of 151, 287 and 170 mV dec−1, respectively.49 It is widely accepted that Tafel slopes of 120, 40 and 30 mV dec−1 are observed for the Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel determining rate steps, respectively. Shinagawa et al.50 reported that the Tafel slope was dependent on the coverage, and hydronium ion reduction and water reduction cannot be differentiated from one another. Therefore, in the case of our Ni mesoporous electrodes, the Tafel slope must originate from either a Volmer rate determining step or a Heyrovsky rate determining step with high coverage by adsorbed hydroxide moieties.55 However, by considering the overpotential and the exchange density current, it can be shown that the mesoporous nickel electrodes are more efficient.
Similar to in the hydrogen evolution reaction, the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the nickel electrodes under the oxygen evolution reaction were determined via CV in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. Similarly to in the HER results, the two electrodeposited Ni electrocatalysts showed the highest current density in the first cycle for the oxygen evolution reaction. The CVs recorded for higher number of cycles are shown in Fig. S4–S6 in the ESI.† As mentioned above, the current density exhibits a maximum in the first cycles, which is followed by a fall due to the resistance caused by oxygen bubbles forming on the surface of the electrodes. This is associated with the slow reduction of the current density in subsequent cycles. After cycle 20, stable CV curves were obtained due to the hydrogen bubble formation/detachment equilibrium. As Fig. 8a shows, the current decay ratio in subsequent cycles decreased from −23.9% for the bulk nickel to −16.56% for the mesoporous nickel. This is very likely due to the increased hydrophilic surface created by the higher roughness owing to the increased level of contact as well as the increased amount of bubbles coming out of the pores owing to the presence of capillaries.9

Furthermore, the electrochemical OER durability of the nickel electrodes was examined via chronoamperometric tests with a constant applied voltage of 2.0 V vs. RHE (1.0 V vs. SCE) (Fig. 8b). Similar to in the HER study reported above, all the electrocatalysts showed the highest current density in the initial period up to about 450 s reaching a peak as shown in the inset to Fig. 8b, after which the current density slowly decreased. As mentioned above, this phenomenon is due to the decrease in the number of electrochemically active sites, which are blocked by oxygen bubble formation over time.22,52 As can be seen from Fig. 8a, the mesoporous structure of nickel increases the current density by 121.6%.
The electron transfer kinetics during the OER process was studied using EIS. Fig. 9 presents the impedance data, including the Nyquist (Fig. 9a) and Bode (Fig. 9b) plots, for the two Ni electrodes under an applied potential of 1.8 V vs. RHE. The fitted data using the equivalent circuit for EIS are presented in Table 4. As can be seen, both the electrodes behave very similarly to during the HER process. The parameters used here were defined previously in the HER section. Using the fitted data, we find that Rct may be related to the overall rate of the OER, including the charge transfer resistance at different stages, while Rp is again associated with the formation of intermediates.56,57 The resistances and capacitances obtained using the fitted parameters are presented in Table 4. The charge transfer resistance, Rct, which is the resistance associated with the high-frequency relaxation, showed a very low value of 0.6231 Ω cm2 for the OER on the mesoporous nickel electrode. When the bulk Ni electrode was used as the electrocatalyst, a higher value of 2.724 ohm cm2 was obtained for this resistance. Therefore, the MP-Ni electrodes provide an excellent platform for the OER, as discussed.

Effect of the mesoporosity of the nickel electrodes on the HER and OER in the presence of a magnetic field

Bulk electrodeposited nickel electrodes. 
The HER activities of the electrodeposited nickel electrodes under the application of an external homogenous magnetic field with a magnitude of μ0H = 0.2 T were investigated in an alkaline medium. The overpotential obtained at 10 mA cm−2 was used as the criterion to evaluate the HER performance. Fig. 4a shows the LSV curves of HER on the bulk electrodeposited nickel electrodes subjected to different-direction external magnetic fields, cf.Fig. 1 for more details. Based on the shape of the LSV shown in Fig. 4a, the potential for the potentiostatic experiments was chosen to avoid any influence of the bulk MHD stirring on the mass transport of the H+ ions towards the electrode and it was decided to work in the water decomposition potential range controlled by the charge transfer.12 The magnetic field in both directions, i.e. either perpendicular or parallel to the electrical field, reduced the overpotential of the HER reaction. These phenomena may be explained by both MHD and micro-MHD. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the electrical field, the convection encourages the formation and detachment of hydrogen bubbles from the electrode surface. Under the magnetic field perpendicular to the electrical field direction, the Lorentz force is maximized, the bubbles are more quickly swept away, and the ion depletion in the vicinity of the electrode decreases due to the MHD convection; therefore, the IR drop became lower in the presence of magnetic field. The MHD convection enhances the mass transfer of the dissolved hydrogen gas near the electrode surface much more than natural convection. Therefore, the concentration polarization of the hydrogen gas evolution decreases. While the application of a magnetic field parallel to the electrical field direction has no significant effect on the HER overpotential due to the absence of the Lorentz force, it still provides a lower overpotential value due to the effect of micro-MHD occurring on non-homogeneities of the electrodeposited surface in the vicinity of the bubbles.29 As shown in Fig. 4a, the effect of MHD is greater than that of micro-MHD for the bulk electrodeposited nickel electrodes.

Fig. 4b shows the Tafel plots of the bulk electrodeposited Ni electrodes in the alkaline medium in the presence of an external magnetic fields applied in different directions. Changes in the Tafel slope are negligible for the hydrogen production reaction on the bulk nickel.
The exchange current densities calculated by the Butler–Volmer equation and the Tafel slopes are summarised in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the presence of a magnetic field in the perpendicular and parallel directions causes the HER exchange current density for the bulk nickel to increase by 57% and 31.25%, respectively.

Fig. 5a shows the current densities of the Ni catalysts under a magnetic field at −0.6 V (vs. RHE) as a function of the cycle number. The bulk Ni catalysts showed the highest current density in the first cycle, with the current density following the order bulk-Ni 0.2 T perpendicular > bulk-Ni 0.2 T parallel > bulk-Ni 0.0 T. Similarly to in the absence of a magnetic field, stable CV curves were obtained after cycle 20, which is associated with equilibrium hydrogen bubble formation/detachment.
CA was performed to produce hydrogen at a constant potential of −0.6 V (vs. RHE) for 1200 s and to examine the stability of the electrodes under the influence of the magneto-hydrodynamic effect (Fig. 5b). The magnetic field increased the current density for bulk nickel by 18.38% when applied perpendicularly and 4.14% when applied in parallel after 1200 s.
To gain further insight into the electron transfer kinetics during the HER process under the influence of the Lorentz force, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed (Fig. 6). Fitted results for EIS are given in Table 2. For comparison, the magnetic field reduces the charge transfer resistance for bulk nickel by 27%. The Rs is 1.456 Ω cm2 is in the case of the bulk nickel, and shows a lower value of 1.287 Ω cm2 for the B-Ni electrode in the presence of the magnetic field. As the electrolyte used was the same, this discrepancy may be related to the decreasing bubble fraction in the electrolyte due to convection from the magneto-hydrodynamic effect.
The effect of the magnetic field on the catalytic activity of the bulk nickel electrodes was further examined via the steady-state LSV curves of the catalysts recorded in the potential region for the oxygen evolution reactions. The LSV curves (Fig. 7a) showed that the magnetic field reduces the OER overpotential of bulk nickel by 4.76% for the perpendicular and 3.69% for the parallel magnetic field. The exchange current densities calculated using the Butler–Volmer equation and the Tafel slope are summarised in Table 3. As is evident from Fig. 7b, for the bulk nickel electrodes, the presence of the magnetic field reduces the Tafel slope, which increases the efficiency of the reaction. The magnetic field increases the exchange current density for bulk nickel 2.5 times.

Fig. 8a shows the current densities of the Ni catalysts under a magnetic field at 2.0 V (vs. RHE) as a function of the cycle number. Similarly to in the results for the HER, the bulk Ni catalyst showed the highest current density in the first cycle 1 for the oxygen evolution reaction, with the current density following the order 0.2 T perpendicular > 0.2 T parallel > 0.0 T. However, the presence of a magnetic field decreases the decay ratio for the OER due to the upward Lorentz force, and the electrolyte convection is in the same direction as the floating force of the oxygen bubbles, which positively affects the electrolytic oxygen production.28 As can be seen from Fig. 8b, the perpendicular magnetic field increases the current density for the bulk electrodeposited nickel by 6.8% in 1200 s.

Fig. 9 presents the EIS data, including the Nyquist (a) and Bode (a) plots, for the bulk electrodeposited Ni electrocatalysts at a potential of 1.8 V (vs. RHE) and a 0.2 T magnetic field. Fitted results for the EIS plots according to the presented equivalent electrical circuits are summarised in Table 4.
Similarly, Rp, the resistance associated with the intermediate-frequency relaxation, which is related to the formation of intermediates, for the bulk electrodeposited Ni decreased from 0.22 Ω cm2 to 0.21 Ω cm2 in the absence and presence of the magnetic field, respectively.


Mesoporous electrodeposited nickel electrodes. 
As previously mentioned, the mesoporous structure of the nickel electrodes reduced the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential by 18.7%, but as can be seen in Fig. 4a, the presence of the magnetic field further reduced the HER overpotential on the mesoporous nickel by 9.65% for the perpendicular and 6.34% for the parallel magnetic field.
As shown in Table 1, the magnetic field increases the HER exchange current density for the mesoporous nickel by 90% in the perpendicular and 65% in the parallel magnetic field. Clearly, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), exchange current densities and Tafel slope results show that the mesoporous structure of the nickel films enhances the HER catalytic activity more significantly than expected under the application of a magnetic field with a magnitude of 0.2 T in either direction. Fig. 5a shows the current densities of the MP-Ni electrocatalysts under a magnetic field at −0.6 V (vs. RHE) as a function of cycle number. The mesoporous Ni catalysts showed the highest current density in the first cycle, with the current density following the order 0.2 T perpendicular > 0.2 T parallel > mesoporous 0.0 T.
CA was performed to produce hydrogen at a constant potential of −0.6 V (vs. RHE) for 1200 s and to examine the stability of the electrodes under the influence of a magnetic force in different directions (Fig. 5b). The magnetic field increased the current density for the mesoporous nickel electrode by 21.18% for the perpendicular and 16.15% for the parallel magnetic field.
We obtained useful information on the electron transfer kinetics during the HER process under the influence of an external magnetic field using EIS spectroscopy (Fig. 6). The equivalent circuit and fitted results for the EIS plots are given in Table 2. The perpendicular magnetic field reduced the charge transfer resistance for the mesoporous nickel by 37%. These results confirm the greater impact of the presence of a magnetic field on the mesoporous Ni electrodes compared to on the bulk Ni electrodes. Rs is 1.456 Ω cm2 is for the mesoporous nickel, which is greater than that of the bulk Ni, which exhibited values of 1.385 and 1.287 Ω cm2 in the absence and presence of the magnetic field, respectively. The higher resistance despite the equal geometric surface areas of the two electrodes can be interpreted in terms of the amount of bubbles formed on electrode surface; more bubbles cause more resistance. The lower resistance in the mesoporous structure is due to the simultaneous presence of both magnetohydrodynamics and HGMF produced by the modulation of the magnetic meso-structured Ni film in this type of electrode.28,58 The important point here is the interaction between the magnetic forces and ions/gas bubbles, which obeys the rules of induced magnetic forces. Atoms or molecules whose electrons are paired, such as hydrogen gas, are classified as diamagnetic materials, which are repelled by magnetic fields. In contrast, substances with an unpaired electron, such as H+ ions, are paramagnetic and are attracted to a magnetic field.40 In this way, the attraction of hydrogen ions and detachment of hydrogen bubbles from the surface as a result of their diamagnetic or paramagnetic nature is realised under the very steep magnetic gradient forces induced by the mesoporous magnetic structure in the electrodeposited MP-Ni electrodes.41 In mesoporous nickel films, R2 corresponds to the depth of the pores. An increase in this resistance under the magnetic field indicates an increase in the depth of pores in the main process, which may indicate an increase in the thickness of the surface hydroxide layer.59 The enhancement of the reaction properties of the hydrogen evolution reaction can be attributed to the increased thickness of the hydroxide layer.60 This will be described numerically later.
The effect of the magnetic field on the catalytic activity of mesoporous Ni electrodes for the OER reaction was also examined via steady-state LSV curves of the catalysts recorded in the potential region for the oxygen evolution reactions. The LSV curves (Fig. 7a) showed that the magnetic field could improve the dispersion of the active sites due to MHD and the micro-MHD effect for mesoporous nickel and enhance the catalyst efficiency.12,61 The mesoporous structure of the nickel electrodes reduces the OER overpotential by 20.8%, but the perpendicular magnetic field reduces the OER overpotential for the mesoporous nickel by 19.26%.
As shown in Fig. 7b, the presence of a magnetic field on the mesoporous electrodes reduces the Tafel slope and improves the kinetics of the reaction. As listed in Table 3, the magnetic field increases the exchange current density for mesoporous nickel by a factor of 3. Clearly, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), exchange current density and Tafel results show that the large electrochemical active surface of the mesoporous nickel films enhances their OER catalytic activity more than the 0.2 T external magnetic field.
In Fig. 8a, the mesoporous Ni catalyst showed the highest current density in cycle 1 for the oxygen evolution reaction, with the current density following the order 0.2 T perpendicular > 0.2 T parallel > 0.0 T. Furthermore, Fig. 8b shows that the presence of a parallel magnetic field increases the exchange current density of the OER for mesoporous nickel by 22.5%. Fig. 9 presents the EIS data, i.e., the Nyquist (a) and Bode (b) plots, for the Ni electrocatalysts under an applied potential of 1.8 V (vs. RHE) and a 0.2 T magnetic field. The fitted results for the EIS data are given in Table 4.
The charge transfer resistance, Rct, which was the resistance associated with the high-frequency relaxation, showed a very low value of 0.6231 Ω cm2 for the OER on mesoporous nickel, which decreased to less than half in the case of a parallel magnetic field. Similarly, Rp, the resistance associated with the intermediate frequency relaxation, which is related to the formation of intermediates, decreased from 0.06 Ω cm2 in the case of mesoporous nickel to 0.03 Ω cm2 when using the perpendicular magnetic field. We found that the electrocatalytic activity of the mesoporous Ni electrodes under the external magnetic field was enhanced beyond what is generally observed due to the effects of MHD or even micro-MHD in the HER and OER. We ascribe the enhanced HER/OER performance of the mesoporous nickel electrodes to the existence of HGMF, as well as the ordinary MHD or micro-MHD. For this reason, we considered a hexagonal array of nanotubes of nickel, as depicted in Fig. 10b. We employed a simple calculation method based on the Fourier transformation of Maxwell's equations, which is explained in the ESI,† and calculated the magnetic field profile inside the array of nanotubular bodies in one dimension for simplicity. The magnetic field profiles emanating perpendicularly, B1,z(x,z0), and in parallel, B1,x(x,z0), to the long axis of the tube are plotted in Fig. 10a.
 Fig. 10  (a) Magnetic modulation profiles calculated at a distance of z0 = 3.5 nm above the surface for a one-dimensional array of nanotubes with the dimensions given in panel (b) for different directions of magnetization. h can be different in real electrodeposited samples. (b) A schematic diagram of nanotubes and the cross-section of the array with the dimensions a = 7 nm, h = 7 nm, and d = 1.5 nm for which the magnetic modulation was calculated. 
We interpreted the enhancement of the HER/OER performance in the MP-Ni electrodes using the superposition of a periodic stray magnetic field emanating from the nanomagnets onto the homogenous external magnetic field, i.e. MHD or micro-MHD. The Lorentz force on the water molecules causes the electrons to circulate, forming eddy currents. The eddy currents produce an induced magnetic field in the opposite direction to the external field. Opposition to the magnetic field creates a repulsive force. Thus, the water molecules are stretched under this permanent repulsive force, leading to the breakdown of hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds.13 This has the effect of creating synergistic repulsion forces, which weakens the water molecules. Magnetic modulation profiles in two parallel and perpendicualr magnetisation direction were calculated according to the method describe in ESI.† According to the magnetic field profile induced by each tube at a height of z0 = 3.5 nm above the surface shown in Fig. 10, modulations with amplitudes of 0.6μ0Ms in the perpendicular direction and 0.5μ0Ms for the parallel direction were observed. The saturation value of μ0Ms = 0.66 T for Ni,38 is achievable under an external magnetic field of 0.2 T.26 Considering the dimensions of our mesoporous films, comprised of the unit tube cell of a = 7 nm, h = 7 nm, and d = 1.5 nm, see Fig. 10, we found that the magnetic gradient is on the scale of ∼107 T m−1. These values qualitatively demonstrate that very steep magnetic field gradients exist in the vicinity of mesoporous Ni electrode surfaces, which favors water splitting via the interactions of water molecules, ions and gas bubbles against the magnetic force.

Conclusions
It is generally acknowledged that ideal electrocatalysts for use in electrolyzers must exhibit small overpotentials, large exchange current densities, and low Tafel slopes; these factors are interdependent.62 To simplify comparison between them, we have summarized the data obtained for the HER/OER performance of our electrodeposited Ni electrodes in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  A comparison of the measured values of (a) overpotential, (b) Tafel slope, (c) exchange current density, and (d) solution resistance for electrodeposited bulk and mesoporous Ni electrodes in the presence and absence of a magnetic field. 
As shown in Fig. 11a, nickel mesoporous electrodes have an overpotential of 366 mV for the OER reaction and 376 mV for the HER reaction, which is lower than those of the bulk electrodes (462 mV for the OER reaction and 463 mV for the HER reaction) due to the large electrochemically active surface of the mesoporous electrodes. The lower potential reduces the energy consumption for the production of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas at these electrodes. The presence of a magnetic field reduces the overpotential of the oxygen and hydrogen reactions by 19 and 10% for the mesoporous Ni electrodes compared to the bulk Ni electrodes (4% overpotential reduction), which shows that the effect of the magnetic field on the mesoporous electrodes is much greater. This larger effect is due to the meso- or nano-magnetic structure of mesoporous nickel. The presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field would lead to the creation of a very steep magnetic field gradient, or HGMF, to a maximum of 107 T m−1, which would significantly reduce the bond strength of the diamagnetic water molecules, causing water splitting via a repulsion force. The Tafel slope values for different electrodes in the magnetic field revealed the effects of mesoporosity and magnetisation on the HER and OER performance. The valuable point of the application of the magnetic field is highlighted here, as for bulk Ni electrodes, the Lorenz force is insufficient to reduce the surface coverage by gas bubbles. Therefore, the change in the Tafel slopes for both reactions in the presence of a magnetic field is negligible for the bulk Ni electrode. In contrast, for the mesoporous nickel electrodes, the Tafel slope is significantly reduced in both reactions (4% in the OER reaction and 6% in the HER reaction) due to the reduction in surface coverage due to HGMF, which can effectively repel diamagnetic gas bubbles and attract paramagnetic ions. The variation of the exchange current density is consistent with that of the overpotential. The mesoporous structure of mesoporous nickel has a strong enhancing effect on the performance of the electrodes and increases the exchange current density of the reactions for both the HER and OER reactions. Further evidence confirming the excellent performance of the MP-Ni electrodes under the magnetic field is demonstrated by the resistance (R1) of the solution as measured by EIS. In summary, the magnetised electrodeposited mesoporous Ni electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical water splitting properties.
The combination of our electrodes made of electrodeposited Ni films and the simple application of a magnetic field/induction of 0.2 T via either a cheap electromagnet or a small permanent magnet attached to the electrode provides a superlative electrode set-up for extremely cost-effective and efficient electrolyzers. We have collected data from various reports in the literature for comparison, including the HER and OER overpotentials and Tafel slopes recorded on different electrodes, and summarised them in Table S2.†53,54,67–74 For the HER, our mesoporous Ni electrodes, exhibiting a HER overpotential of 366.6 mV, have better performance than various previously reported nickel electrode materials, such as nickel dendrites (441 mV),22 nickel particles (446 mV),22 and nickel films (448 mV).22 The MP-Ni electrode (ηHER = 340.1) provides the same functionality as Co2B (350 mV),63 CoSe2/DETA (386 mV),63 and NiFe-NP (374 mV)64 electrodes. Under the application of the moderately low external magnetic field, the performance of our mesoporous Ni electrodes was greatly improved, reaching the same level as that of NiFeOF (253 mV)65 electrodes. For the OER, our electrodeposited MP-Ni electrode has the best performance. According to the data shown in Table S2,† MP-Ni (ηOER = 366.6 mV) exhibits very similar OER performance to many electrodes, such as RuO2 (357 mV)62 and Fe(OH)3:Cu(OH)2 (365 mV).66 Applying a magnetic field increases the performance of this electrode (ηOER = 296 mV), making it comparable to those of noble metal electrodes such as Ru2O (210 mV)49 and hierarchical electrodes such as 3D-OMNiSA (254 mV).25
