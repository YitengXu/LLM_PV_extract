    , Accepted 22nd February 2012First published on 15th March 2012AbstractTwo methanol-soluble fullerene surfactants have been developed as interfacial layers for cathodes in polymer solar cells. These surfactants facilitate the tuning of cathode work function and extraction of electrons that significantly enhance open-circuit voltage and photocurrent generation. The performance of bulk heterojunction solar cells based on using these surfactant-modified cathodes improved significantly to afford high power conversion efficiencies (as high as 6.63% for a Ag cathode).
Introduction
Effective control of organic–metal interfaces is critical for achieving high-performance polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–6 Ideally, the work-function (Φ) of the cathode and anode should be aligned with the energy of the photo-excited quasi-Fermi levels (EF) of organic semiconductors to create an Ohmic contact for maximizing achievable open-circuit voltage (Voc) and minimizing energy barrier for charge-extraction (Fig. 1).7–9 Although low Φ metals such as Ca (Φ = 2.9 eV) have been proven to form good contact with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer as the cathode, its vulnerability to environmental conditions undermines its use for practical applications. More stable metals like Al (Φ = 4.28 eV) and Ag (Φ = 4.57 eV) have been used as cathodes, but their relatively high Φ often causes energy mismatch between BHJ blends and themselves, which results in lower Voc and device performance.10–12

To alleviate this problem, proper interfacial engineering by inserting a thin layer between the cathode and the active layer has been vigorously explored. For example, inorganic materials such as LiF,13,14 and Cs2CO3,15,16 metal oxides (TiOx and ZnOx),17–21 and organic materials such as insulating poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)22,23 and conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) have also been proved to be effective in improving Al cathode based device performance.24–32 In a recent study, 8.37% of PCE was reported by inserting polyfluorene derivative (PFN) between the high performance PTB7:PC71BM BHJ and Ca/Al.32 In addition, self-assembled fullerenes, i.e. PCBM capped PEG and fluorocarbon modified PCBM (F-PCBM), have also been reported to increase P3HT:PCBM based device performance.33–35
Despite the fact that a few interface engineering studies have been performed for conventional PSCs, the performances obtained from Ag based devices were usually lower than those using Ca/Al and Al cathodes.26,34 This significantly limits the utilization of stable and reflective Ag as a cathode for improving performance and stability of devices, though it is well-known that the Ag anode can be advantageous in inverted PSCs to facilitate the printing process.
On the other hand, fullerene-based materials not only can match well with the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of a commonly used acceptor, i.e. PCBM, but also possess a sufficiently deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, which make them energetically ideal candidates for an electron transport layer (ETL) to facilitate electron-selecting and hole-blocking in PSCs (Fig. 1). However, to fulfil the role as effective interfacial materials,1–3 several additional parameters need to be optimized simultaneously. First, these materials should be capable to adjust the Φ of the cathode to improve the contact with the BHJ layer. Second, they should possess reasonable electron mobility to minimize electrical resistance across the interfacial layer. Finally, they need to have good orthogonal solvent-processability and film forming properties to avoid eroding into the bottom BHJ layer.
In this report, we have designed and synthesized two new fullerene surfactants, ETL-1 and ETL-2 (Fig. 1a), that can be dissolved easily in alcoholic solvents and applied as an interfacial layer for cathodes, which exhibited effective tuning of cathode Φ, extraction of electrons, and photocurrent generation in devices. These two fullerene surfactants intrinsically help forming good interfacial contact between metal (in either high or low Φ) and BHJ to improve device performance. Recently, the mechanism of using a fullerene surfactant to enhance the device Voc has been elucidated that the metal EF is pinned to the LUMO energy level of the interfacial layer, thus increasing the device Voc regardless of the choice of different cathode metals.37 To the best of our knowledge, this represents a new organic interfacial material to realize a Ag cathode based OPV with performance superior (as high as 6.63%) to those of Ca/Al and Al based devices due to the solvent-processed fullerene ETL simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc, and FF of the device (Fig. 1 and 2).
Results and discussion
ETL-1 and ETL-2 with compact integration of both ionic moieties and polar ethylene oxide chains onto a C60 core were prepared by quaternizing the tertiary nitrogen of fulleropyrrolidines with methyl iodide (Scheme 1 and ESI†).38 Compared to the poor solubility of most fullerene derivatives (i.e., Mono 1, Bis 2 and PCBM) in polar solvents, fulleropyrrolidiums (ETL-1 and ETL-2) exhibit amphiphilic properties that can be dissolved in both chloroform and methanol, which provides great flexibility for processing in orthogonal solvents to prevent eroding the bottom BHJ layer.

The energy levels of ETL-1 and ETL-2 were estimated by cyclic voltammogram measurements.39,40 As shown in Table 1, the LUMOs of ETLs exhibit a small energy-gradient compared to that of PCBM due to the fact that the electron-deficient cationic nitrogen is in close vicinity of the fullerene core (Table 1), which made this interfacial material energetically favorable for electron collection and transport from PCBM to the cathode.

Both ETL surfactants possess reasonable electron motilities (2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ETL-1 and 4.91 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ETL-2) (Fig. S5†) and show negligible absorbance to visible light (Fig. S2†), which qualify them as proper electron-transporting layers (ca. 10 nm). ETL-1 and ETL-2 bearing cationic nitrogen and PEO linkage effectively up-shifted the Φ of Al and Ag,37 around 0.8 eV, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies (Fig. 1 and S6†). It may be due to the fact that the polar interaction between fullerene surfactants and metal facilitates pinning of the metal EF to that of the ETLs upon equilibration, which reduced the energy barrier between BHJ layer and cathodes. This, in turn, increases Voc and charge extraction efficiency.
In the mean time, the presence of these fullerene layers creates only minimal energy barrier height for electron extraction from PCBM (due to matched ETL LUMOs to that of PCBM). This is different from using the insulating PEO and p-type CPE process that have unfavored energy level and charge-transporting properties. Moreover, the n-type nature of the fullerene surfactant layer creates an extra acceptor–donor junction that can potentially enhance exciton dissociation and prevent the cathode from forming a direct contact with the active layer to quench excitons.43,44 These reasonings are supported, vide infra, by the enhanced performance of PSCs with spun interfacial layers.
PSCs with fullerene surfactant-modified Al were first studied. The device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PIDT–PhanQ:PC71BM/ETL/Al (Fig. 1) showed significantly improved Voc, Jsc and FF compared to those of the reference device without the interfacial layer (Fig. 2a and c and Table 2). The reference device A with bare Al as the cathode showed a relatively low PCE of 3.54% with a Voc of 0.61 V, a Jsc of 10.55 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.55. The Schottky barrier at the active layer/Al interface caused low Voc, Jsc, and FF. However, when a thin layer (∼10 nm) of ETL-1 or ETL-2 was inserted between the BHJ layer and Al, a higher PCE of 5.96% (device B) and 6.03% (device C) could be achieved, which accounts for a 70% improvement for device C compared to the reference device. All the parameters (Jsc, Voc and FF) increased significantly for devices B and C, because a better interfacial contact was created between BHJ and Al when the fullerene ETL was applied, which lowered the Φ of Al, thus giving higher Voc, and efficient electron extraction to give higher Jsc and FF.

To further understand the effect on surfactant-modified cathodes, the commonly adopted Ca/Al cathode based device was also studied, in the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PIDT–PhanQ:PC71BM/ETL/Ca/Al. Good contact between the Ca/Al cathode and BHJ can give essentially high-performance, 6% PCE of device D (Voc = 0.86 V, Jsc = 11.08 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.63). Slight improvements in device characteristics could be observed when the ETL layer was applied (Fig. 2c and d and Table 2). Improved PCEs of 6.19% (ETL-1, device E) and 6.50% (ETL-2, device F) were achieved, which correlated with the slightly enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF. These results indicated that the additional fullerene ETL layer helped optimize the contact between Ca/Al and the BHJ layer leading to increased PCE. Although being widely used in PSCs as electrodes, Al and Ca/Al are really sensitive to air and moisture, which causes device degradation in ambient conditions. Ag shows relatively good stability toward ambient conditions. However, the energy mismatch between high Φ of Ag and LUMO of PCBM usually resulted in poor device performance. To alleviate this problem, we have also fabricated devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PIDT–PhanQ:PC71BM/ETL/Ag (device G–I). A distinctly improved PCE (44%) could be achieved for device I compared to that of the reference device G due to enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF (Fig. 2e and f and Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, a PCE of 6.63% from device I using ETL-2 is one of the highest values achieved from conventional PSC with a Ag cathode.
In order to understand how the interfacial layers affect device performance, we have compared the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices A–I (Fig. 2b, d and f). The calculated Jsc obtained from integration of the EQE spectrum matches well with the measured one, with variation of less than 5% (Table 2). With an ETL-1 or ETL-2, the EQEs of devices are higher in part of the spectrum compared to those of the reference device, which correlate well with the results of higher photocurrents.
In all devices, ETL-1 shows slightly lower PCE and relevant parameters (Jsc and FF) than those of ETL-2, which may be due to the difference of film quality of these two ETLs on top of the BHJ layer. The topography and surface profile of devices with and without the ETL layer were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are shown in Fig. 3. All the interfacial layers covered well on top of the BHJ layer. The surface of ETL-2 is relatively smooth as indicated by the lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness, 0.763 nm (Fig. 3c), and is similar to 0.733 nm of the BHJ surface. ETL-1 on top of the BHJ layer exhibited a RMS of 1.01 nm with relatively rough surface (Fig. 3b).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized two fullerene-containing surfactants, ETL-1 and ETL-2, which can be processed easily in orthogonal solvents like methanol on top of the BHJ layer in PSCs. These materials possess proper electron mobility and the capability of tuning cathode Φ to improve electron extraction and photocurrent generation. Upon the insertion of a thin ETL-1 or ETL-2 between various metal cathodes and the BHJ layer (devices A–I), simultaneously improved Voc, Jsc and FF could be achieved for these devices compared to those without using a surfactant. The performance of PSCs is significantly improved (70% for Al cathode and 40% for Ag cathode) when a surfactant-modified cathode was applied. High performance PSCs using a fullerene ETL modified Ag cathode were realized (as high as 6.63%) which is superior to those of Ca/Al and Al based devices. This study provides a simple and generally applicable method to significantly improve the performance of PSCs.

Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
[6,6]-Phenyl-C61 (or C71)-butyric methyl ester was purchased from American Dye Source. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H.C. Starck. Materials were used as received. The fullerene surfactant solutions in methanol were sonicated for 2 h prior to spin-coating in ambient conditions at 5000 RPM. The surfactant layer thickness was ∼8 to 10 nm as measured by AFM. The ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone for 15 min, followed by manual scrubbing with detergent and deionized water, then sonication in deionized water and isopropanol for 15 min each. The substrates were blown dry under a nitrogen stream and immediately exposed to air plasma for 20 seconds. A 40 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto each substrate and subsequently annealed in air at 140 °C for 30 min. The mixture of PIDT–PhanQ:PC71BM in o-dichlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1, 1:3, w/w)36 was then spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layers at 800 RPM, and subsequently annealed at 110 °C for 10 min under nitrogen atmosphere to obtain a film thickness of approximately 80 nm after fullerene surfactant solutions were spin coated on the BHJ layer. The substrates were then transferred back into the glove box and annealed at 110 °C for 5 min. Finally, aluminium (100 nm) or calcium (30 nm) topped with aluminium (100 nm), or silver (100 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer through shadow masks.
Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley 4200 in a nitrogen-filled glove box under AM1.5 illumination conditions at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. An NREL certified silicon photodiode with a KG5 filter was used for calibration. Device EQE spectra were obtained in air by comparison to a known AM1.5 reference spectrum for a calibrated silicon photodiode.
