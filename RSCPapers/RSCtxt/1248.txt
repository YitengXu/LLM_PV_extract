    , Accepted 29th December 2022First published on 30th December 2022AbstractElectronic and stability properties of quasi-2D alkylammonium perovskites are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and validated experimentally on selected classes of compounds. Our analysis is focused on perovskite structures of formula (A)2(A′)n−1PbnX3n+1, with large cations A = butyl-, pentyl-, hexylammonium (BA, PA, HXA), small cations A′ = methylammonium, formamidinium, ethylammonium, guanidinium (MA, FA, EA, GA) and halogens X = I, Br, Cl. The role of the halogen ions is outlined for the band structure, stability and defect formation energies. Two opposing trends are found for the absorption efficiency versus stability, the latter being assessed with respect to possible degradation mechanisms. Experimental validation is performed on quasi-2D perovskites based on pentylammonium cations, namely: (PA)2PbX4 and (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7, synthesized by antisolvent-assisted vapor crystallization. Structural and optical analysis are inline with the DFT based calculations. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis shows an enhanced stability of bromide and chloride based compounds, in agreement with the theoretical predictions.
1 Introduction
The field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed an impressive development as power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.7%1 become comparable with standard silicon based technology at a much lower fabrication cost, taking advantage of chemical synthesis routes. Since the first report of a functional PSC by Miyasaka et al., where methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPI) was used, several 3D hybrid perovskites were synthesized by replacing the methylammonium (MA) with other small-size molecules suitable to fit the inorganic lead-halogen cage.2–4 However, only a limited number of organic molecules or inorganic species are suitable to retain the perovskite phase by maintaining a phase-compatible Goldschmidt tolerance factor. Furthermore, this choice is also motivated by the fact that chain-like organic cations introduce less distortions in the PbI6 octahedral layer compared to e.g. benzene-ring organic cations, leading to stronger interactions between organic cations on one side and between cations and inorganic framework on the other side, which leads to larger decomposition energies.5 In addition, substituting lead by tin or germanium was investigated in order to reduce the toxic potential of the perovskite.6,7
A more substantial way to flexibilize the optoelectronic properties is to use the halogen sequence I, Br, Cl and mixtures thereof, which has a larger impact on the band gap and stability. On the other hand, introducing larger organic cations along with small molecules or completely substituting them brought a much larger diversity of hybrid perovskites structures, usually termed quasi-2D perovskites.8–11
The quasi-2D perovskites usually exhibit larger band gaps compared to their 3D counterparts, as a consequence of quantum confinement, which leads to a less efficient optical absorption and a smaller PCE.12 Larger band gaps can be used in tandem solar cell configurations and can be further tuned by adjusting the number of quasi-3D layers.13 However, this drawback is compensated by the enhanced stability due to the hydrophobic moieties present in the large organic cations.14 Furthermore, larger cations have smaller diffusivities and are less susceptible to migrate, limiting the ion conduction and the J–V hysteresis typically found in PSCs.
From a theoretical perspective, the quasi-2D perovskites have been analyzed using density functional theory (DFT), which allows a computational design for optimal optoelectronic properties.15,16 More and more frequently, the DFT high throughput calculations are optimized using machine learning schemes.17 Using first principle methods, the edge states were shown to be stabilized by the internal electric fields induced by polarized organic cations.18 Furthermore, ab initio calculations also revealed a giant Rashba splitting, which arise from multiple quantum wells with strong spin–orbit coupling,19 supporting the idea of possible spintronic applications.
Within the multiple choices for the large organic cations, the alkylammonium series offer good prospects for systematic optimizations.20 A comparative analysis of stability for butylammonium and hexylammonium organolead perovskites has been performed,21 evidencing the role of cation length in decreasing the halide mobility. Similarly, the size of diaminoalkane molecules, having two NH2− functional groups, is shown to directly influence the crystallization process.22 A quasi-2D perovskite containing pentylammonium and guanidinium has been synthesized for a highly sensitive and ultrafast responding photodetector.23
In this paper, we investigate electronic and stability properties of quasi-2D perovskites based on the alkylammonium series, which includes the butyl-, pentyl- and hexylammonium (BA, PA, HXA) as large cations and methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), ethylammonium (EA), guanidinium (GA) as small cations. The alkylammonium series are selected as spacer cations due to their properties to passivate the defects at the surface and increase the hydrophobicity of the 2D perovskite.24 Besides, the electron-blocking ability, the moisture resistance increases with the length of the alkyl chain making them valuable cation spacers compared to other types of molecules. This class also allows a systematic analysis concerning the length of the alkyl chain. Furthermore, by changing the halogen, the variations in band gap and stability are determined. The stability is investigated based on the likely degradation mechanisms. In addition, the formation energy of point defects is evaluated for each case, which can bring a better perspective on the ion migration. The theoretical investigations are performed in the framework of ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which are supported by experimental synthesis, followed by structural and optical characterization of selected compounds and stability tests.
The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, the quasi-2D perovskite structures are introduced and the details of DFT based calculations are indicated, which includes the stability assessment and the calculation of defect formation energies. In the following section, the experimental methods are described, which include the preparation of the perovskite crystals, followed by structural and optical characterizations. The thermal stability is evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis.
2 Quasi-2D perovskite structures: electronic structure and stability
We focus our investigation on three sub-classes of the more general (A)2(A′)n−1PbnX3n+1 Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskites: (PA)2PbX4 (X = I, Br, Cl), (A)2(MA)Pb2I7 (A = BA, PA, HXA) and (PA)2(A′)2Pb3I10 (A′ = MA, FA, EA, GA). This selection, which belong to the X4, X7 and X10 groups, allows a comprehensive perspective concerning the influence of the halogen, and of the large and small cations on the optoelectronic and stability properties. The 2D perovskite compounds crystallize in orthorhombic space groups, which can be either non-centrosymmetric or centrosymmetric. We adopt here the centrosymmetric structures as they resemble the averaged structure of polycrystalline bulk perovskites,13 which are depicted in Fig. 1. The three groups of structures, identified as X4, X7 and X10, have the space groups Pbca, Ccmm and Acam, respectively. The number of atoms per unit cell ranges from 180 (X4) to 276 atoms (PA-MA-X10) and 292 atoms (PA-GA-X10).

The ab initio calculations were performed using the SIESTA package,25 which has the advantage of using strictly localized basis sets, allowing a linear scaling of the computational time with the system size. We employed a double-ζ polarized basis set and local density approximation with an exchange-correlation functional parameterized by Ceperley and Alder.26 Even though hybrid functionals and spin–orbit coupling typically provide more accurate band gap energies, there is a fortuitous cancellation that can be exploited, rendering the less expensive functionals to perform reasonably given the relatively large unit cells. The approach makes use of Troullier–Martins norm conserving pseudopotentials27 with typical valence configurations. For the k-space sampling a Monkhorst–Pack scheme of 5 × 1 × 5 was employed and the real space grid was specified by a mesh cutoff energy of 150 Ry. Structural relaxations are performed until the residual forces are less than 0.15 eV Å−1, which ensures an accurate description of the electronic and stability properties. The density of states is smoothened using a broadening of 0.02 eV.
The stability assessment is performed based on the most likely degradation mechanisms. In general, these can be grouped into intrinsic degradation mechanisms, and extrinsic ones, similar to reaction routes available for 3D perovskites.4,28,29 In the former class, chemically pristine compounds can decompose under thermal and electrical stress, while the latter class belongs to processes where extrinsic elements are involved, like molecular oxygen and water. In the following, we adapt these degradation mechanisms to quasi-2D perovskites. From the former group of intrinsic degradation pathways, we consider the decomposition into a solid precipitate (PbX2) and gaseous phases (organic cations – A, A′ and HX acids): (A)2(A′)n−1PbnX3n+1 → 2Ã + (n − 1)Ã′ + (n + 1)HX + nPbX2(1)
Here, Ã and Ã′ represent the deprotonated, electrically neutral molecules corresponding to the large and small cations, respectively.
As extrinsic degradation mechanism we investigate the impact of molecular oxygen, using the reaction pathway: (2)
The stability is evaluated based on the endothermic reaction energies. One should underline that, as a step further, a more detailed analysis can be performed using computationally more demanding ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, which allow an indepth investigation of oxygen and water molecule interactions with the perovskite.30
A similar DFT based scheme for the calculation of optoelectronic and stability properties was employed in ref. 4 for 3D mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite materials of general formula , where A and A′ are small size cations. In particular, in the respective study, the electronic properties, optical absorption coefficients and stability of MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) compounds were determined to be in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental studies.
In addition to perovskite decomposition, a comparative analysis of single-vacancy defects for different perovskite compositions can provide further information regarding ion migration, which is correlated to the perovskite degradation and can be identified in the hysteretic effects in the J–V characteristics.31 The formation energy (Ef) of a point defect is defined as:32 (3)where Edefprv and Eidealprv are the total energies of the defected and ideal crystals, respectively, ni < 0 is the number of the removed atoms and μi are the chemical potentials of the excluded species (i = I, Br, Cl or Pb), with the upper limits equal to half of the total energy of the X2 molecule for a halogen (μX ≤ μX[X2]) or the chemical potential of bulk Pb (μPb ≤ μPb[bulk]). Here, we investigate single-vacancies, i.e. ni = −1 and we consider halogen and Pb rich conditions for the respective vacant species, so that the chemical potentials become equal to μX[X2] and μPb[bulk].
We start our analysis with (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 (X = I, Br, Cl) compounds, which are the smallest unit cell structures that contain both large and small cations. The band structures depicted in Fig. 2 are similar to previous reports on BA based compounds.13 Although the band gaps are typically underestimated by DFT, the trend of increasing gaps in the halogen sequence I → Br → Cl is evident. Furthermore, a direct band gap is obtained, which is located at the center of the Brillouin zone.
 Fig. 2  Projected band structures of (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 quasi-2D perovskites, with X = I, Br, Cl. The inorganic (Pb, X) and organic (C, N, H) contributions are depicted in red and blue colors, respectively. A direct band gap is evidenced at Γ point. The band gap increases as the atomic number of the halogen decreases. 
The gap modifications induced by the size of the large cations have been less analyzed so far. Our choice for the BA, PA, HXA sequence provides the framework for a systematic investigation. Fig. 3 shows the partial density of states (PDOS) for the (A)2(MA)Pb2X7 class of compounds (A = BA, PA, HXA; X = I, Br, Cl). The PDOS analysis based on the inorganic Pb–X and organic (cation) contributions reveals two energy gaps, which are marked by arrows. The band gaps of the 2D perovskites are basically set by the Pb–X contributions with slight influences from the large organic cations. As the atomic number of the halogen decreases, the band gaps are increasing and, due the interaction with the organic cations, the energy gaps in the PDOS corresponding to the organic contributions are also increasing. This shows that a tunable PDOS distribution of inorganic and organic components can be obtained based on the halogen type or their mixtures, similar to the tunable alignment of the two PDOS components previously achieved using spacer cation engineering.5 Besides the expected gap variation with the halogen type, a small increase in the band gap is observed as the size of the large cation is getting larger (BA → PA → HXA). This dependence is sub-linear, with a smaller increase in the gaps in the large cation sequence, but systematic for all three halogen types. This suggests that larger cations enhance the effective quantum confinement of the 2D layers containing MA small cations, which, in turn, enhance the band gap with a small amount. Previously, the quantum confinement effects have been discussed in connection to the number of inorganic layers,13 which is further supported by photoluminescence measurements.14
 Fig. 3  Partial density of states (PDOS) for (A)2(MA)Pb2X7 structures (column-wise), with A = BA, PA, HXA and X = I, Br, Cl (row-wise): contributions from the inorganic layers (red) and organic layers (blue), the latter being mirrored for better visibility, and the total DOS (black). The energy gaps in the PDOS are evidenced by arrows. These are strongly influenced by the halogen type, while they are slightly increasing as the size of the A-cation is getting larger. 
Removing the small cations, the (A)2(MA)Pb2X7 type structures are transformed into X4 structures of formula (A)2PbX4, which exhibit an even larger quantum confinement. This becomes visible in Fig. 4(a), where a similar trend for the same halogen sequence is observed for the (PA)2PbX4, however, with significantly larger gaps compared to the X7 systems. On the other hand, increasing the number of layers X4 → X7 → X10 the quantum confinement is reduced and so is the energy gap. This is illustrated in Fig. 4(b) for iodine based perovskites.

The X4 class shows a similar trend as for the X7 class as the halogen is changed, while increasing n by the amount of MA the band gap is decreasing in the sequence I4 I7 I10. 
The stability of the perovskite compounds is assessed with respect to the intrinsic and extrinsic degradation pathways outlined by eqn (1) and (2) on three representative sub-classes: (PA)2PbX4, (A)2(MA)Pb2X7 and (PA)2(A′)2Pb3I10. The relative stabilities, measured as endothermic reaction energies, are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, taking one compound as reference from each class, which point out the influence of the halogen, small- and large cations on the degradation processes. For the intrinsic degradation mechanism, replacing I with Br leads to higher stability (4–8%), which is confirmed also in the case of the extrinsic degradation mechanism (5–7%). Replacing iodine with chlorine leads to an overall poorer stability with respect to the intrinsic degradation pathway (−3–2%) for the X7 family, while for the X4 compounds the stability of chlorine based compounds is found in between iodine and bromine based compounds. This is in contrast with the extrinsic degradation, where the use of chlorine is beneficial, the improvement with respect to iodine based systems being similar to the one of bromine based compounds (5–6%). The overall behavior of the stability with respect to the halogen type is, to some degree, similar to one corresponding to 3D perovskites:4 for the intrinsic mechanism, the stability increases in the sequence I ↗ Cl ↗ Br [(PA)2PbX4] and Cl ↗ I ↗ Br [(A)2(MA)Pb2X7], while for the extrinsic mechanism we have I ↗ Cl ≈ Br. A number of theoretical and experimental investigations described in ref. 4 confirm the overall picture of an enhanced stability for Br-based perovskites compared to I-based ones, which is similar for both 3D and 2D perovskites, e.g. by Pistor et al.,33 Brunetti et al.,34 Ciccioli et al.35 and McGovern et al.36 Some 3D compounds were shown to be less stable (e.g. based on hydroxylammonium and hydrazinium), which was also experimentally confirmed. Recently, the MA1−xEAxPbI3 mixed perovskite system, identified in our previous study4 as one strong candidate for improved stability and photovoltaic performance, was theoretically and experimentally confirmed.37

With respect to changing the large cations in the sequence (BA, PA, HXA) the modifications of the relative stability are significantly smaller. However, replacing MA with other small cations (FA, EA, GA) leads to a larger stability enhancement. This can be explained by considering the deprotonation energies of the small cations according to the reaction: Ã′X → A′ + HX. The deprotonation energies for the small cations are 0.55 eV (MA), 1.41 eV (FA), 1.24 eV (EA) and 2.09 eV (GA), while for all three large cations (BA, PA, HXA) the value is almost the same, ∼0.75 eV. The large value obtained for GA, followed by FA and EA is correlated to the higher stabilities of the respective 2D perovskite compounds, for both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Given the fact that the deprotonation energies of the large cations are similar, the emerging picture shows the primary role of small cations in the degradation process. However, our analysis does not account for water-induced degradation, where the hydrophobic moieties of the large cations would have a significant impact.
The possibility of inducing point defects is yet another factor to be considered in the broader context of perovskite degradation, as ion migration is facilitated by vacancies or more complex defects. We investigate the formation energies of single-vacancies of iodine and lead, observing the trends induced by the halogens and small cations. The formation energy, as defined in eqn (3), is correlated with the likelihood of producing a certain type of defect. Fig. 5 shows the formation energies for (PA)2PbX4, (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 and (PA)2(GA)Pb2X7 classes of compounds, where all halogen and lead vacancy sites have been considered. Although there is a small spreading for each halogen type, the average formation energies indicate a clear trend: EClf > EBrf > EIf. This trend becomes more clear for GA containing perovskites, with higher formation energies, as compared to MA or the X4 class and is inline with previous investigations concerning bromide- and iodide-based 3D perovskites.38 Moreover, the same trend is observed for Pb vacancies, i.e. bromine and chlorine based perovskites would enhance the Pb vacancy formation energy as well.

3 Experimental validation
The experimental validation is performed by comparing electronic and stability properties of compounds from (PA)2PbX4 and (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 classes (X = I, Br, Cl), with the results obtained from ab initio calculations. The SEM images of the investigated perovskites are depicted in Fig. 6. Both investigated perovskites exhibit layered stacking structures which confirms the 2D morphology.

To confirm the structure of the synthesized (PA)2PbX4 and (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 compounds, X-ray diffraction has been carried out [see Fig. 7]. The diffractograms of the (PA)2PbX4 class, gathered in Fig. 7(a), confirm the formation of 2D perovskite crystals. The crystals present specific diffraction lines for 2D perovskites at 5.74°, 11.12°, 16.68°, 22.17°, 27.78°, 30.60° and 36.35° in accordance to the diffraction peaks reported in the literature.39,40
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of synthesized quasi-2D perovskites: (a) (PA)2PbX4 and (b) (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7, X = I, Br, Cl. The typical 2D perovskite lines are present for both classes of perovskite compounds. 
For the (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 compounds, a mixture of phases is presented in the synthesized crystals, as depicted in Fig. 7(b). The 2D RP perovskite with n = 2 phase is dominant with specific diffraction lines which are found around 9°, 14° and 26° in accordance to the diffraction peaks reported in the literature41–43 [see Fig. 6(b)]. Also, the diffraction peaks of 2D layered perovskite with n = 1 phase are observed [see Fig. 6(b)]. The diffractogram of (PA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 crystals reveal an additional peak corresponding to PbBr2. Similarly, the diffractogram of (PA)2(MA)Pb2Cl7 presents a peak corresponding to PbCl2, a peak assigned to pentylammonium chloride (PACl) used as precursor and a peak which can be assigned to MAPb2Cl3 perovskite crystals. For (PA)2(MA)Pb2I7 crystals, the additional diffraction peaks can be assigned to PbI2, MAPb2I3 and MAPb2I3·H2O.
The estimated band gaps for the synthesized crystals are indicated in Fig. 8(a and b) and are in good agreement with the obtained theoretical values: (PA)2PbX4 (DFT values in brackets) – 2.29 (1.92) eV, 2.95 (2.46) eV, 3.55 (3.14) eV; (PA)2MAPb2X7 – 2.1 (1.74) eV, 2.25 (2.29) eV, 3.14 (2.62) eV.
 Fig. 8  Measured optical absorption for (PA)2PbX4 (a–c) and (PA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (d–f), with X = I, Br, Cl. The band gap energies are in close correlation with the values obtained by numerical simulations, shown in Fig. 3 and 4. 
 Fig. 9  Photoluminescence spectra of (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 perovskite crystals. In the case of (PA)2(MA)Pb2I7 two gaps can be identified, the second one corresponding to (PA)2PbI4 (n = 1) perovskite. 
The band gap values estimated from the maximum PL intensity of the emission peak are: 2.53 eV for (PA)2MAPb2Cl7, 2.28 eV for (PA)2MAPb2Br7, and 2.76 eV, 2.05 eV for (PA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, with n = 2, n = 1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9. The iodine based perovskite presents two band gaps, corresponding to the presence of two emission peaks, arising from 2D perovskites with different layers (n = 2 and n = 1), which are the predominant phases according to X-ray diffraction (see Fig. 7). The band gaps found are consistent with those reported in the literature for 2D perovskites.44 Furthermore, the values obtained are slightly lower or equal to the values calculated from the UV-vis analysis (see Fig. 8).
The intrinsic degradation mechanism assumes that the decomposition of the perovskite is triggered without any foreign species being involved. This can occur at elevated temperatures or bias stress, conditions that can be found during the operation of the solar cells. In order to simulate a degradation effect, we perform thermogravimetric measurements, allowing the perovskite compounds to fully decompose into constituents. Thermal analysis of the (PA)2PbX4 crystals was performed under nitrogen atmosphere in the 20–800 °C range and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 10. The thermogravimetric profile of the (PA)2PbI4 sample shows the largest weight loss of ∼77%, which can be noticed from a temperature as low as 100 °C and up to 368 °C accompanied by an endothermic process, probably due to the decomposition of organic cation. Then the remnant material is stable up to 533 °C. At this temperature, a weight loss of ∼85% can be observed until the temperature reaches 627 °C. Similar decomposition processes are found for the other two perovskite compounds, (PA)2PbBr4 and (PA)2PbCl4, albeit the TG curves are shifted towards higher temperature values.
 Fig. 10  Thermogravimetric measurements performed for (PA)2PbX4 (X = I, Br, Cl) compounds in inert (N2) atmosphere, revealing the increase of the stability in the halogen sequence as I ↗ Cl ↗ Br. 
For all three (PA)2PbX4 perovskites the process of decomposition starts at different on-set temperatures, where the mass begins to decrease below the initial value: 180 °C, 270 °C and 310 °C for X = I, Cl, Br, respectively. The decomposition curves have a similar shape, in two steps, the first one showing the decomposition of the organic cation, followed by the decomposition of PbX2. Their relative shift implies that the (PA)2PbBr4 is the most stable amongst the X4 group, followed by (PA)2PbCl4 and (PA)2PbI4. This is in accordance with the theoretical prediction regarding the intrinsic degradation mechanism, as described by eqn (1). The stability of (PA)2PbBr4 and (PA)2PbCl4 was also studied in O2 atmosphere. The decomposition process starts with 20 °C earlier for the compound based on Br and with 10 °C for the one based on Cl. These data indicate that the compound containing Cl gains stability with respect to extrinsic degradation, in agreement with theoretical data.
Given the electronic and degradation trends, one may conclude that halogens have a strong influence on both the absorption efficiency and stability. On one hand, increasing the atomic number of the halogen, the band gap decreases, making it more suitable for absorbing within the solar spectrum, while, on the other hand, the stability is reduced. Therefore, mixed halide perovskites of type IxBr1−x or IxCl1−x can be a good compromise for enhanced solar cell efficiency and stability, compared to monohalogen compounds. Even though the organic cation has a smaller influence on the band gap, DFT calculations suggest that the stability can be further improved by using proper small cation mixtures.
Experimental methods
The crystals of quasi-2D perovskites were obtained by anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC), where the perovskite solutions were prepared using a DMF/DMSO solvent mixture and dichloromethane (DCM) has been used as anti-solvent for the crystallization. In the AVC procedure, the corresponding alkylammonium salt and the lead salts were dissolved stoichiometrically in the appropriate volume of solvent. The solution was placed in a closed vial containing DCM as anti-solvent in order to crystallize the species in solution. The structure of the synthesized crystals was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorption and thermogravimetric (TG) measurements.
SEM images were obtained using a Zeiss GeminiSEM-500 microscope. The operational parameters employed for the SEM images were: an accelerating voltage of 3 kV, and a working distance of around 9 mm.
The XRD spectra were recorded with a Bruker-AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using a Cu-Kα (0.1541 nm) radiation and LynxEye detector. The diffractograms were recorded over a 2θ range of 5–80 degrees at a scanning speed of 0.03 degrees min−1 and a counting time of 0.5 s per point.
The optical properties of the crystals were investigated using DR-UV-vis spectroscopy (AvaLight-Xe pulsed light source connected to an AvaSpec-ULS 2048L spectrometer equipped with an AvaSphere 80-REFL integration sphere). The spectra were recorded in the range of 200–1000 nm using BaSO4 as baseline.
The optical band gap (Eg) of the prepared crystals was calculated using the Kubelka–Munk equation in terms of reflectance (R): (4)where R is the diffuse reflectance of the examined sample and F(R) is called the remission or Kubelka–Munk function. Thus, the band gap was obtained using the following equation: (F(R)·hν)2 = A(hν − Eg)(5)
The PL spectra were acquired at room temperature using a FluoroMax 4P spectrophotometer with excitation light having an oblique angle of incidence. The excitation wavelength used for all the samples was 350 nm.
The thermogravimetric analysis of the perovskite compounds was carried out with a Themys One 1150 TGA in nitrogen atmosphere, at a heating rate of 10 K min−1.
4 Conclusions
The optoelectronic properties and stability of quasi-2D perovskites with large alkylammonium cations have been evaluated by ab initio calculations and validated by experiment. The electronic structure analysis shows an increase of the band gap with the size of the large cation and, more substantially, with decreasing the halogen atomic number. Although 2D perovskites already possess larger than optimal band gaps due to the quantum confinement, it is found that the compounds based on bromine and chlorine have larger stability with respect to the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The best compromise between these two opposing trends for the efficiency and stability can be achieved if further research reveals the optimal mixture of halogens and cations. Changing the small cations (MA, FA, EA, GA) has shown little gap variations, while the stability can be enhanced, as in the case of MA-GA 2D perovskites. The main trends concerning the optoelectronic properties are validated experimentally for (PA)2PbX4 and (PA)2(MA)Pb2X7 classes of compounds, albeit the measured energy gaps are systematically larger, as expected, due to the typical DFT underestimation. Furthermore, thermogravimetric measurements show that (PA)2PbBr4 is most stable, followed by chlorine and iodine based counterpart. This outlines the halogen influence on the stability, being in agreement with the theoretical predictions obtained for the intrinsic degradation mechanism.
