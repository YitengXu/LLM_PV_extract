    , Accepted 23rd February 2023First published on 23rd February 2023AbstractDevelopment of eco-friendly dual electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is gaining importance for renewable energy generation. In this study, green-synthesized Fe-PANI is reported as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and OER processes. Fe-PANI/NF exhibits a lower overpotential (η) of 261 mV (OER) and 155 mV (HER) at 10 mA cm−2 than commercial IrO2 (341 mV) and near to that of Pt (36 mV), and a smaller Tafel slope (OER: 100 mV dec−1/IrO2 125 mV dec−1; HER: 120 mV dec−1/Pt 74 mV dec−1). The turnover frequency (TOF) of Fe-PANI (OER: 0.0673 s−1/IrO2 0.0179 s−1; HER: 0.022 s−1/Pt 0.10 s−1) was found to be higher than that of IrO2 and near to that of Pt. For solar water electrolysis, Fe-PANI/NF exhibits overpotential of 411 mV and a durability over 100 h with 4.1% potential loss (1 M KOH). As a non-precious electrolyzer, Fe-PANI combined with a solar cell produces H2 gas under sunlight. This methodology suggests that the green-synthesized Fe-PANI electrolyzer outperforms precious electrocatalysts. Hence, cost-effective large-scale H2 production without an artificial current may be possible with a commercial solar cell. Furthermore, the environmental impact of Fe-PANI was evaluated by examining the significant sustainability metrics and socio-economic parameters.
1. Introduction
The increasing population has led to high energy consumption globally with the diminishing of traditional fossil fuels and severe pollution issues.1 Academic communities and industrialists have been investigating supplementary power sources, such as hydropower, wind energy, nuclear fusion and solar irradiation.1–3 Besides the huge potential for energy manufactured from renewable resources, the utility of both intermittent as well as non-surplus energy sources for large scale applications is hindered. Recent mileposts in the development of hydrogen (H2) production, such as power plants, fuel cells, metal–air batteries, etc., have validated it as a promising conversion technology, as well as confirming H2 to be a sustainable, clean, eco-friendly and renewable energy carrier.4 Electrocatalytic water-splitting is a potential alternative for ultrapure hydrogen production. The HER, OER, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are at the heart of these technologies for the conversion of chemical to electrical energy. The electrolyzer consists of two electrodes with the OER taking place at the anode and the HER at the cathode.5 The polarization curves of these electrodes consist of equilibrium points of [(0 V): (H2/H+:H2  2H+ + 2e−: HOR/HER) and 1.23 V (H2O/O2: 2H2O  O2 + 4H+ + 4e−: OER/ORR) Vs. RHE]. Although IrO2/RuO2 (OER) and Pt (HER) catalysts are benchmark electrocatalysts, their high costs and instability hinder their use in large-scale applications.4,6 Therefore, an alternative strategy has become urgently needed to achieve large-scale water splitting. The development of non-precious metal-based, low-cost, efficient HER and OER electrocatalysts has been widely studied but still remains a challenge.
Due to its unique π-conjugated structure, which is beneficial for electrochemical stability and conductivity, polyaniline (PANI) has attracted great attention as a material for energy storage and conversion.7,8 The nitrogen with a lone electron pair of PANI provides coordination sites to anchor 3d transition metals (TMs), with a TM-N coordinate bond forming owing to strong electron transfer ability and resulting in enhanced conductivity and high stability in a harsh alkali environment.9,10 However, the oxidative polymerization synthetic methodology of PANI produces eco-unfriendly by-products and the formed PANI lacks nanostructure consistency.11 To solve these issues, there is an urgent need to fabricate low-cost, efficient PANI-based composite electrocatalysts for water splitting. Mechanochemical synthesis is the process of initiating a chemical reaction by grinding solid reagents made up of either inorganic or organic materials without the use of solvents, making it an environmentally friendly method.12,13 Due to not requiring solvents, synthesis achieved by grinding (mortar and pestle) has gained increasing attention in the field of green chemistry. This technique does not require advanced laboratory equipment and can be performed in any laboratory.14
Herein, we report Fe/PANI obtained from green-synthesized PANI, which anchors Fe2+ ions using its abundant nitrogen sites. The high-valence Fe centers become easily assembled into the PANI network to form a Fe-PANI spindle-like morphology. The green synthetic route endows Fe/PANI with significant bifunctional activity and stability. Fe-PANI shows excellent activity, with an overpotential of 311 mV (OER) and 100 mV (HER) at 10 mA cm−2. We fabricated a two-electrode electrolyzer (Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF) that exhibits water splitting at 10 mA cm−2 for 100 h. Also, solar-to-hydrogen (STH) production at 1.64 V in a full-cell set up was demonstrated. The robust bifunctional Fe-PANI spindle electrocatalyst shows outstanding results, with long-term stability.
2. Experimental
Synthesis of Fe-PANI was carried out by hand grinding using a pestle and mortar (Fig. 1).15 For polymerization of aniline under solvent free conditions, FeCl3·6H2O was employed as both oxidant and dopant.16 About 1.0 mL of aniline and 1 g of FeCl3·6H2O were subjected to grinding for 5 min and a black colored powder was formed. Further grinding of the black powder led to slurry formation, which turned to a green color after grinding for 10 min. These observations implied the formation of polyaniline as its doped emeraldine salt (ES) together with iron. The reaction mixture was further subjected to 60 min of grinding followed by aging (12 h) at room temperature. The formed Fe-PANI was purified by washing with water, filtering and drying at room temperature (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Reasonably priced FeCl3 was used as an oxidant to polymerize aniline as well as an iron dopant source (Fe-bonded to the functional group of PANI). The sources of carbon, nitrogen and iron in Fe-PANI are from the precursors only without the need for any additional chemical supports. Only grinding changed the polymer spindle into an interconnected carbon network framework via the formation of N–Fe bonds. Fe is a known conductor with abundant active sites to enhance catalytic activity. The PANI acts as a synergistic stimulant for electrocatalytic activity due to fast electron transport, hence Fe-PANI is a robust electrocatalyst for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The distinctive spindle structure of Fe-PANI enhances the active sites by providing a high electrochemical surface area. Its unique morphology increases conductivity and stability, which lead to enhanced activity.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the synthetic pathway of the Fe-PANI electrocatalyst. The aniline was oxidized by FeCl3 to form polyaniline via oxidative polymerization and the formed dark green emeraldine salt form of polyaniline served as an indicator of the end of the polymerization of aniline15 and rest of the iron (FeCl3) was encapsulated by PANI (dopant).16 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Fe-PANI electrocatalyst is displayed in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks at 15.5°, 20.2° and 25.1° are ascribed to PANI in the emeraldine salt.17 The peak centered at 20.2° can be attributed to polymer chain, while the peak at 25.1° corresponds to iron-doped PANI, which sharpens due to the presence of benzenoid and quinonoid groups in the polyaniline.18 However, the diffraction peaks at 42.0° and 44.0° confirmed the encapsulation of Fe ion by PANI [JCPDS#65-5099]. XRD analyses suggest that the green mechanochemical synthesis of Fe-PANI with FeCl3·6H2O (oxidant as well as dopant) implies the formation of doped polyaniline emeraldine salt with a good crystalline nature.17

FT-IR spectra of the Fe-PANI electrocatalyst is shown in Fig. 3, wherein the peaks in the range of 3100–3500 cm−1 can be ascribed to the N–H stretching of the phenyl ring and the peak at 1277 cm−1 may be due to the N–H wag of primary amines.19 The stretching frequencies of 1550 cm−1 and 1445 cm−1 can be ascribed to CN stretching (quinonoid ring) and CC stretching (benzenoid ring), respectively.20,21 The peak at 1283 cm−1 may be due to aromatic C–N stretching vibration, which confirmed the π-electron delocalization in Fe-PANI.22 The peaks at 1248 and 1134 cm−1 are the characteristic bands of the emeraldine salt15 and the out-of-plane C–H ring bending was confirmed by the sharp peak at 735 cm−1.23 The Fe in Fe-PANI was confirmed by Fe–O stretching peak at 663 cm−1,24 which could enhance the charge transfer (CT) ability. All these IR-frequencies suggest that the Fe-PANI electrocatalyst may likely exist in emeraldine form.

The surface shape and elemental distribution of the as-synthesized Fe-PANI composite were analyzed by FE-SEM and EDX (Fig. 4). The Fe-PANI has a spindle-like morphology with an interconnected structure and the size of the spindles was found to be 10–15 nm (Fig. 4).25 The Fe-PANI contains pores which assist the free migration of electrolyte ions to improve the charge and mass transfer between the electrodes and electrolyte during the electrochemical process. The homogeneous dispersal of C, N, O and Fe throughout the structure was confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 5). The atomic percentages in Fe-PANI were found to be 7.52% (Fe), 11.01% (N), 59.12% (C) and 22.36% (O). The aforementioned morphology of Fe-PANI shows a large exposed specific surface area, which is beneficial for mass transfer with fast kinetics in overall water splitting. The metal components of Fe-PANI were further confirmed by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) (Table S1, ESI†).

The HR-TEM image of Fe-PANI reveals that it is fusiform (spindle) with semi-transparent spotty features.26 Small and uniformly distributed iron particles can be clearly seen in the PANI matrix (Fig. 6). The black spots are Fe (white circle) and the light-colored rod-like layer shown in the triangle in Fig. 6(b) is PANI, which confirm that Fe is encapsulated by the nitrogen of PANI (N–Fe) with a particle size of as large as 20–25 nm and the diameter of the fusiform of PANI was found to be 10–15 nm.27 The TEM histogram reveals a narrow distribution with a mean diameter of 11 nm for Fe-PANI (Fig. S2, ESI†). The size determined from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis is in agreement with SEM analysis. These results disclose the uniform dispersion of Fe particles on PANI have been adhered in a PANI interconnected fusiform (spindle), which may be beneficial for both high-performance OER and HER. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of Fe-PANI show lattice fringes of Fe with a spacing (d) of 0.2175 nm (100) (Fig. 6). The bright concentric circle in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) data can be assigned to the (100) and (002) planes, implying that crystalline-phase Fe is encapsulated in PANI and the rest of the blurred bright rings can be attributed to polyaniline spindles (fusiform). The TEM findings are consistent with the XRD assignments.

The composition of Fe-PANI was confirmed by XPS (Fig. 7) and the survey spectrum implies the presence of Fe, C, N and O (Fig. S3, ESI†). The Fe 2p spectrum shows binding energies of 711.1 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 717.2 eV (satellite peak) corresponding to Fe2+, peaks at 724.5 eV (Fe 2p1/2) and 713.3 eV (satellite peak) corresponding to Fe3+ and the existence of Fe–N was confirmed by the peak at 712.4 eV.28,29 The N 1s spectrum of Fe-PANI shows four peaks at 398.4 eV for quinonoid imine (–N), 400.3 eV for benzenoid imine (–NH–), 401.4 eV for positively-charged nitrogen (N+) and 399.6 eV for N–Fe (Fig. 7).30–33 The existence of N–Fe indicates that the Fe was successfully doped into the PANI matrix in Fe-PANI. The C 1s spectrum shows four peaks at 284.4, 284.6, 286.1 and 288.7 eV corresponding to CC/C–C, C–H, C–N/CN and satellite peaks (π–π*, aromatic rings), respectively (Fig. 7).15,32,34,35 The binding energies of 533.3, 532.2, 531.0, 531.8 and 529.8 eV in the O 1s spectrum may be attributed to the formation of OH, adsorbed water, –OH on the iron surface, Fe–O–H and metal–O, respectively, in the electrocatalyst (Fig. 7).36–39

Fig. 8 shows the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the green-synthesized Fe-PANI, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution of Fe-PANI were measured to examine the surface structure. The findings show that Fe-PANI has a moderate surface area of 410.2 m2 g−1 and pore sizes ranging from 15 to 80 nm. The porosity may enhance the electrochemical activity of Fe-PANI due to the exposure of active sites that are accessible to the electrolyte. It can also provide a perfect pathway for evolution of O2 and H2 gas from the electrode surface without causing damage.42,43 The most significant pore volumes of Fe-PANI electrocatalyst indicated that it is mainly macroporous, which is quite consistent with the effective OER and HER activity.

The stability of Fe-PANI was examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which shows three stages of weight loss (Fig. 9): weight loss below 100 °C (28.6 wt%) that may be attributed to water loss; weight loss in the range of 125–400 °C (11.5 wt%) implying the release of dopant from polymer units40 and a third weight loss after 400 °C (11.5 wt%) attributed to PANI decay or thermal degradation of O/N units of PANI. Fe-PANI completely decomposed beyond 700 °C and the residual weight (23.4%) indicates the excellent thermal stability of Fe-PANI, meaning that it is an efficient OER and HER electrocatalyst. The excellent thermal stability of Fe-PANI may be ascribed to both its spindle-like morphology and highly stable benzenoid units.41

3.1. Activity and stability of Fe-PANI
Electrocatalytic studies on conducting polymers have rarely reported on how the fast electron transfer, excellent conductivity, and heteroatoms (N) in the conducting polymer may promote the OER and HER activity. Thus, the N–C bond in the Fe-PANI can act as an electroactive center for the OER and HER process. Since the lone pair of the N atom of PANI serves as a coordination site to hold 3d transition metal ions, the N–Fe coordination bonds afford abundant electrocatalytic active centers and promote fast electron transfer that results in high performance.33
Motivated by the aforementioned findings and the green synthetic route that leads to the expected composition of Fe-PANI, the OER activity of Fe-PANI/NF was investigated in a three-electrode device (1.0 M KOH).32 The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of Fe-PANI/NF shows a lower overpotential of 261 mV (at 10 mA cm−2) than a commercial IrO2/NF catalyst (341 mV) and bare NF (401 mV) (Fig. 10). The comparative efficiency of Fe-PANI with recently reported non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts was confirmed (Table S3, ESI†). The Tafel slope of Fe-PANI/NF (100 mV dec−1) was found to be lower than those of IrO2/NF (125 mV dec−1) and NF (181 mV dec−1) (Fig. 10). The low overpotential and small Tafel slope of Fe-PANI/NF reflect its excellent catalytic activity. At 1.60 V, the calculated TOFs of NF, IrO2/NF and Fe-PANI/NF are 0.0076 s−1, 0.0179 s−1 and 0.0673 s−1, respectively. Electrochemical stability is a significant issue for excellent OER catalysts because of the constant gas evolution that occurs during the electrochemical process. The potential change and surface morphology of Fe-PANI/NF were examined via durability testing by plotting a current–time (I–t) curve for 100 h (Fig. 10). After 100 h of electrolysis with constant gas evolution, the I–t curve exhibits significant stability with a 2.0% loss in potential.

The electrochemical study of Fe-PANI/NF reveals that iron concentration and Fe(OH)x formation [M(II)/M(III): (M–Fe)] during the OER process enhance the activity. The Fe-PANI/NF OER reaction route is as follows (Fig. 11):32,42 OH−+ * →OH* + e−; OH− + OH* → O* + H2O + e−; OH− + O* → OOH* + e−; OH− + OOH* → O2 + H2O + e−; where * indicates active Fe-PANI sites and metal centers with open sites, which are well known to be advantageous to the electrocatalytic process. The higher %N of PANI in Fe-PANI (N–Fe) improved the iron binding energy with PANI and Fe-PANI/NF stability during the OER process, The N–Fe coordinate bonds offered abundant electrocatalytic active centers for the OER, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data.33 During the OER process, the formation of Fe3+/Fe2+ (Fe(OH)2/FeOOH) enhanced the oxygen evolution, which is consistent with post-OER XRD analyses.43 Also, Fe had the potential to improve the OER process by increasing the electrocatalytic activity at active centers. At 1.39 V, an anodic peak was observed where the interaction of Fe species in the Fe-PANI aided the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe3+.44 The Fe-PANI/NF potential activity indicated that 1.0 M KOH was in close contact with the active regions of the electrocatalyst surface.

After 100 h of non-stop water electrolysis (OER), the Fe-PANI/NF electrode was subjected to post-processing analyses (IR, SEM, XRD and XPS) to determine the active species responsible for its bifunctional activity. The post-OER XRD analysis of the Fe-PANI/NF electrode showed that Fe-PANI has a degree of crystallinity (Fig. 12). The diffraction peaks of Fe-PANI phase were almost invisible but several new broad peaks were observed in the 10°–40° region due to scattering from the PANI chains. The peaks at 40.1°(210), 41.6°(140), 43.2°(220), 47.2°(041), 48.0°(230), 49.7°(150), 50.5°(211), 54.7°(240) and 55.9°(060) were indexed to FeO(OH) (JCPDS: 81-0464). Fig. 12 depicts the post-OER IR spectra of Fe-PANI/NF, wherein the peaks at 1487 and 1354 cm−1 were attributed to the CN (quinonoid) and CC (benzenoid) stretching vibrations of PANI, respectively.45 The distinct peaks at 1160 cm−1, 750 cm−1, 3305 cm−1 and 1056 cm−1 were attributed to C–N, C–H, N–H and C–H stretching vibrations, respectively.46–49 The bands at 678 cm−1 and 3456 cm−1 confirmed the presence of Fe–O and OH in the polymer composite.50,51 The post-OER IR spectrum of Fe-PANI was found to be nearly identical to the pre Fe-PANI spectrum, with a slight shifting of bands. The intensity ratio of the quinonoid to benzenoid band changed due to the π–π* stacking and electrostatic interactions between the Fe ion and PANI in Fe-PANI. Post-OER IR spectrum analyses suggested that Fe-PANI underwent a slight phase change after the OER, which is consistent with the post-XRD and SEM results.

The post-OER XPS analysis of the Fe-PANI/NF electrode revealed that the Fe 2p energy resolved with peaks at 711.6 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 725.7 eV (Fe 2p1/2), confirming the Fe3+ state52,53 and the peak at 714.3 eV may be attributed to the Fe 2p3/2 of Fe–O (Fig. 13).54 The binding energies of 529.9, 531.6, 532.2 and 534.1 eV in the O 1s spectrum were ascribed to Fe–O, Fe–OH, –OOH and adsorbed H2O, respectively (Fig. 13).54–58

The post-OER SEM of Fe-PANI/NF reveals that the electrocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on NF due to constant evolution of O2 on the Fe-PANI surface (Fig. 14). The spindle-like morphology of Fe-PANI underwent a slight change (the spindles accumulated into a flower-like morphology) due to the rapid evolution of O2 gas bubbles, which had a positive effect on the catalytic activity even after stability testing (Fig. 14).59 The EDS data indicated the uniform dispersion of Fe, C, N, and O on the NF surface (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Measurements in 1.0 M KOH were conducted to analyze the electrocatalytic activity of Fe-PANI/NF and Pt/C/NF for the HER.43,60 The Fe-PANI/NF polarization curve showed the lowest overpotential of 155 mV in comparison to that of NF (320 mV) and was near to that of the Pt/C/NF electrocatalyst (5% Pt on carbon) (36 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15). Fe-PANI/NF exhibited superior water splitting capability than known inexpensive HER catalysts. Comparable efficiency of Fe-PANI with recently reported non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts was confirmed (Table S3, ESI†). Additionally, the Tafel plot (HER) of Fe-PANI/NF shows a smaller slope (120 mV dec−1) than NF (142 mV dec−1) and was near to that of Pt/C/NF (74 mV dec−1), which implies that that HER kinetics became much faster. The TOFs of Fe-PANI/NF (0.022 s−1), Pt/C/NF (0.10 s−1) and NF (0.005 s−1) at −0.1 V confirmed the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Fe-PANI in 1.0 M KOH. Fe-PANI/NF exhibits excellent HER performance with significant H2 production in the given time. The current–time (I–t) curve was used to examine the modification of the surface morphology, potential and phase of Fe-PANI/NF over 100 h (Fig. 15). The I–t curve at 100 mV vs. RHE at 10 mV cm−2 shows impressive electrode stability, with 2.2% potential loss after 100 h with vigorous H2 evolution.

The favorable Tafel–Volmer step (Fe-PANI/NF Tafel slope: 120 mA dec−1) assisted the H2 evolution in 1.0 M KOH at low overpotential, and Fe-PANI/NF exhibited high HER activity (Fig. 16).42 2M# H*  H2 ↑ + M# (Tafel); M# + H2O + e−  M# H* + OH− (Volmer); Mcat Hchem + H2O + e−  H2 ↑ + M# + OH− (Heyrovsky). The hydrogen (H*) atoms adsorb on metal active sites (M#), which is highly dependent on the electrochemical properties of the active sites. The H+–e− transfer process in the HER catalyst promotes strong bonds with adsorbed H, which are broken to release H2 gas (Sabatier theory).42 However, the rate determining step is related to hydrogen absorption instead of water dissociation. Fe-PANI has potent ability to capture water quickly, which results in dissociation to release a lot of hydrogen atoms. The small Tafel slope of Fe-PANI implies that the hydrogen atoms are transferred to the active sites of Fe-PANI to form Fe–H, which combines with H2O-generated H2 molecules.60 Additionally, desorption of adsorbed OH on the surface is accelerated by Fe(OH)x formation, which is consistent with the post-reaction XRD results. The HER kinetics were improved and the ability to dissociate water was effectively increased by the formation of low-valence iron materials on the Fe-PANI (N–Fe*) surface.33 The increase in the activity of the HER implies a surge in the prevalence of active sites in Fe-PANI. As a result, Fe-PANI may emerge as a robust material for electrochemical energy conversion. The superior activity of active centers (N–Fe) may be ascribed to the green-synthesized Fe-PANI deposited on the NF and the active centers on the surface of the Fe-PANI closely interacting with 1.0 M KOH.

After 100 h of non-stop water electrolysis (HER), Fe-PANI/NF underwent post-processing analyses (XRD, IR, XPS and SEM) to determine the active species responsible for its bifunctional activity. The post-HER XRD analysis of Fe-PANI/NF shows that Fe-PANI has a degree of crystallinity (Fig. 17). The diffraction peaks of the Fe-PANI phase were almost invisible but several new broad peaks in the range of 10°–40° region may be due to scattering from the PANI chains. The peaks at 43.6°(101), 60.4°(102), 66.3°(110), 71.3°(003) and 78.3°(200) were indexed to Fe(OH)2 (JCPDS: 13-0089). Fig. 17 shows the post-OER IR spectra of Fe-PANI/NF, wherein the peaks at 1487 and 1589 cm−1 were attributed to CN and CC stretching vibrations corresponding to the quinonoid and benzenoid fragments of PANI, respectively.45,61 The distinct peaks at 1160 cm−1, 829 cm−1, 3294 cm−1 and 1047 cm−1 were attributed to C–N, C–H, N–H and C–H stretching vibrations, respectively.46,62–64 The bands at 657 cm−1 and 3782 cm−1 confirmed the presence of Fe–O and OH in the polymer composite.65,66 The post-reaction IR spectrum of Fe-PANI was found to be identical to the pre-reaction Fe-PANI spectrum, with a slight shifting of the bands. The intensity ratio of the quinonoid to benzenoid band changed due to π–π* stacking and electrostatic interactions between the Fe ion and PANI in Fe-PANI. The post-reaction IR spectrum analysis suggested that Fe-PANI underwent a slight phase change after the OER, which is consistent with the post-reaction XRD and SEM results.

The post-HER XPS of Fe-PANI/NF reveals that Fe 2p can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 712.5 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 725.5 eV (Fe 2p1/2) confirmed Fe2+ and the peak at 719.3 eV with corresponding satellite peaks at 719.3 eV and 732.8 eV confirmed Fe2+ in Fe-PANI/NF (Fig. 18).67–70 The peaks at 719.7 eV and 707.4 eV can be attributed to reduced Fe species in Fe 2p3/2.71,72 The binding energies of 530.1, 531.5, 532.3 and 533.3 eV in the O 1s spectrum may be attributed to Fe–O, Fe–OH, –OH and H–OH, respectively (Fig. 18).73–76

The post-HER SEM of Fe-PANI/NF reveals that the electrocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on NF due to the constant evolution of H2 on the Fe-PANI surface (Fig. 19). The spindle-like morphology of Fe-PANI underwent a slight change (spindles accumulated into a flower-like morphology) due to the rapid evolution of O2 gas bubbles, which had a positive effect on the catalytic activity even after stability testing (Fig. 19).59 The EDS data indicated the uniform dispersion of N, Fe, C and O on the NF surface (Fig. S5, ESI†).

The active centers in Fe-PANI influenced the catalytic activity. As an outcome, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Fe-PANI/NF was determined by measuring the double layer capacitance (Cdl) at 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s−1 scan rates in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 20 and SI-1, ESI†).77–79 According to the rectangular shape of the data, the ECSAs of Fe-PANI (13.5 m−2 g−1) and NF (7.4 m−2 g−1) were determined to have high double layer capacitance. The slopes of the double layer capacitance were found to be 0.29 mF cm−2 (Fe-PANI/NF) and 0.27 mF cm−2 (NF) for broad rectangular traces when the scan rate was changed from low to high. The anodic and cathodic current increased to 0.066 mA cm−2 (NF). For the OER and HER, strong polarity and a great potential for the formation of new active sites were observed for Fe-PANI. The calculated ECSAs were 7.4 m−2 g−1 (NF) and 13.5 m−2 g−1 (Fe-PANI/NF). A significant increase in the ECSA for Fe-PANI/NF over that of NF indicates that Fe-PANI/NF interacts strongly with the electrolyte, generating more accessible active sites to assist the OER and HER processes. The high ECSA may be due to the unique spindle-like nature of Fe-PANI with a high surface area (BET). Table S2 (ESI†) shows the ECSA/RF values of Fe-PANI/NF and NF (Fig. 20).
 Fig. 20  Electrochemical active surface area (ECSAs): (a and b) Fe-PANI and (c and d) NF. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the OER/HER reaction kinetics of Fe-PANI/NF (Fig. 21).43,80–85 The semicircles in the Nyquist plot may be correlated to the charge–transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrodes (Fe-PANI/NF-3.0 Ω) and NF (−10.4 Ω). Owing to a large ECSA, the Rct of Fe-PANI/NF (3.0) was three times lower than that of NF (10.4). The higher ECSA of Fe-PANI/NF (13.5 m−2 g−1) compared to that of NF (7.4 m−2 g−1) may due to the increased contact area between the active centers and electrolyte, resulting in lower internal resistance. The increased active sites may be responsible for the excellent OER/HER performance of Fe-PANI/NF.42,43

Based on the above exceptional OER and HER performances, Fe-PANI/NF should be a robust bifunctional material for water splitting (1 M KOH: 1.0–2.0 V), with Fe-PANI/NF serving as both the anode and cathode [Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF], compared with NF//NF, which was also constructed for comparison (Fig. 22).43,60
 Fig. 22  (a) Full cell LSVs (scan rate 10 mV s−1) and (b) chronopotentiometry durability testing at 10 mA cm−2 of Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI. 
The LSV curves indicate that the efficiency of Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF was superior to that of NF//NF (Fig. 22). Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF (1.64 V at 10 mA cm−2) required a lower voltage than NF//NF (1.95 V at 10 mA cm−2). During the electrolysis, vigorous H2 and O2 bubbles were observed on the respective electrodes. The Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF electrolyzer exhibited durability, with 2.0% loss in potential after 100 h of continuous electrolysis at 10 mA cm2 (Fig. 22). The evolution of H2 gas (poorly soluble) was more rapid than O2 gas evolution because of the sluggish OER reaction kinetics. Table S3 (ESI†) confirms that Fe-PANI/NF exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic efficiency compared to other iron-based electrocatalysts. The strong association of Fe-PANI with the NF under OER and HER conditions was demonstrated through electrochemical in situ surface oxidation. The synchronous chemisorption of intermediates consisting of oxygen and hydrogen was assisted by Fe in Fe-PANI and led to an increase in electrocatalytic OER and HER activity.
3.2. Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) production of Fe-PANI
We constructed an electrolyzer with a commercial solar panel (5.83 V) to assess the practical performance of Fe-PANI/NF in 1.0 M KOH. The solar-assisted water-splitting setup involved Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF. To adjust the voltage, the positive and negative terminals of the solar panel were connected through copper clips and a digital multi-meter with full cell water splitting setup (Fig. 23).43,60 The fabricated solar water splitting device evolved oxygen and hydrogen gas constantly at 1.64 V (without sunlight). During water electrolysis, 4.57 mmol h−1 cm−2 of hydrogen was generated (SI-1: Table S4, ESI†).42 As a result, the solar-assisted electrolyser developed in this study might be useful for cost-efficient H2 generation in the water-splitting industry.
 Fig. 23  (a) Solar full-cell water splitting setup and (b) overall water splitting of Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF. 
Thus, Fe-PANI has many advantages for efficient water splitting: (i) the spindle-like geometry of Fe-PANI provides a high surface area-to-volume ratio for rapid charge transfer with appropriate coverage of active sites; (ii) spindle-architectured Fe-PANI with a suitable pore size is considered to be a reactive species for adsorption–desorption; (iii) Fe-PANI consists of Fe coordination sites bonded with N (Fe–N), which would be favorable for the formation of active Fe-(oxy)hydroxides, thereby increasing the attraction for intermediates; (iv) the in situ association of Fe-PANI on NF improves the electrode stability and conductivity, also promoting mass transfer by incorporating the active sites and impeding self-aggregation; (v) the bifunctional activity of Fe-PANI can be improved by a complete green treatment (no solvents, direct use of starting materials with simple mortar and pestle grinding). On the basis of these advantages, the potential Fe-PANI electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 261 mV (OER) and 155 mV (HER) at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. A cell voltage of 1.64 V was required by Fe-PANI to drive an alkali-electrolyzer at 10 mA cm−2.
3.3. Environmental impact assessment
The currently recommended technology was evaluated both qualitatively as well as quantitatively by using relevant mass-based sustainability with socioeconomic factors to determine the greenness of Fe-PANI and its manufacturing process (Table 1). The equations used for the respective calculations are listed in the ESI† (SI-2).86

3.3.1. Raw materials. 
Very small quantities of raw materials (FeCl3·6H2O and C6H5NH2) were used to synthesize Fe-PANI, which was then washed with H2O and C2H5OH. The mass intensity (excluding water) of 1.37 kg kg−1 with a reaction mass efficiency (RME) of 72.5% was calculated. The RME can be improved by optimizing the reactant mass and avoiding excess reagent usage.


3.3.2. Energy consumption. 
A normal filtration method was used instead of operating vacuum filtration settings and no electricity was used for the synthesis. The Fe-PANI was dried with sunlight (no electrical energy was involved) and the energy intensity was found to be 0.00 kW h kg−1 for the laboratory-scale synthesis of Fe-PANI and the energy intensity may be completely reduced by increasing the production scale.


3.3.3. Resulting emissions. 
No harmful side products were separated out during the synthesis of Fe-PANI; also, extra oxidants were avoided for polymerizing aniline during the synthesis. The calculated environmental factor (0.3) implies negligible emissions and the recovered unreacted salts during repeated washings and H2O can be recycled (minimum quantity of H2O was used for washing).


3.3.4. Toxicity potential. 
As per the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), FeCl3 is a corrosive skin sensitizer and aniline is toxic to both human as well as aquatic life. In the presence of non-flammable FeCl3in situ polymerization of aniline at room temperature resulted in the synthesis of PANI, which was blended with FeCl3 to form the non-hazardous material Fe-PANI (in accordance with regulation (EC) no. 1272/2008). Hence, the industrialized process can be undertaken with very simple preventive measures.


3.3.5. Disposal of waste. 
The nickel foam was finally disposed of by a professional waste disposal service. The material was dissolved in combustible solvent and burnt in a chemical incinerator equipped with an afterburner and scrubber.


3.3.6. Affordability. 
The solar-assisted water splitting set-up demonstrated in this study might be recommended for cost-efficient H2 production in the water-splitting industry because the durable Fe-PANI electrocatalyst was synthesized in a green manner using inexpensive materials.


3.3.7. Social acceptability. 
The current green strategy for the synthesis of Fe-PANI is eco-friendly, simple, economical, requires low operative effort, produces a product that is suitable for consumers and generates clean hydrogen that has high societal impact. Since the recommended technology does not require the use of highly skilled manpower for implementation as well as maintenance it is highly acceptable for use in the OER/HER.

4. Conclusion
We described a green synthetic technique for developing earth-abundant Fe-encapsulated PANI as an excellent durable electrocatalyst. Fe-PANI with a spindle-like morphology catalyzed the OER (261 mV) and HER (155 mV) with a low overpotential, small Tafel slope (OER/HER: 100/76 mV dec−1) and high durability (100 h). The TOFs of 0.673 s−1 (OER) and 0.22 s−1 (HER) were higher than that of IrO2 (0.017 s−1) and near to those of Pt/C (0.0109 s−1), respectively. The outperformance of the Fe-PANI/NF electrocatalyst may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the spindle-like morphology and NF hitched electrode architecture. The spindle-like morphology leads to fast carrier transfer and mass transport and outstanding mechanical durability (100 h: OER/HER), with a huge active surface area of 7.4 m−2 g−1 (Fe-PANI). The Fe-PANI/NF//Fe-PANI/NF electrolyzer exhibits non-stop H2 and O2 evolution, with 1.64 V at 10 mA cm−2. Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) production through water splitting (1.64 V) was demonstrated for the first time using bifunctional Fe-PANI/NF. The environmental impact of Fe-PANI/NF was established by evaluating the relevant sustainability metrics.
