    , Accepted 14th November 2018First published on 14th November 2018AbstractInjectable nanocomposite hydrogels containing small copper sulfide nanoparticles (6–8 nm) with a 54.6% photothermal conversion efficiency have been facilely prepared by applying an upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type biopolymer gellan. This minimally invasive formulation ablates cancer completely in vivo after NIR-triggered chemo-photothermal therapy.
Near-infrared (NIR, wavelength of 700–1000 nm) triggered thermal ablation of tumors is of great interest owing to its minimal absorption by skin and tissue, and excellent spatial/temporal selectivity with infiltration from micrometers to centimeters. To date, various NIR-absorbing materials (e.g. gold, platinum, graphene, MOFs, porphyrins, black phosphorus, dyes, and conjugated polymers) have been developed for NIR-triggered hyperthermia therapy.1–7 Compared with other NIR-adsorbing materials, copper-based nanoparticles are not only cost-effective, but also possess properties of a broad NIR adsorption spectrum, strong photothermal conversion, a photodynamic effect and inherent capabilities of multimodal imaging (such as photoacoustic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging and/or positron emission tomography).3,8–13 However, monotherapy based on CuS nanoparticles, similar to other nanomedicines, is often compromised by rapid clearance and metabolism via systematic circulation,14,15 leading to high dose, short lifetime, limited efficacy and potential toxicity.
Injectable nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels, which contain inorganic nanoparticles inside the polymer networks, are an emerging class of smart materials for combination cancer therapy.16–27 These minimally invasive formulations have the advantages of co-immobilizing diverse reagents, prolonged tumor retention, reduced administration frequency, on-demand stimuli-triggered release, allowing multiple therapies and prohibiting the multidrug resistance.28–30 Examples of injectable NC hydrogels (e.g. self-assembled collagen–gold hybrid hydrogels,31 calcium-alginate hydrogel immobilized dendrimer-encapsulated platinum nanoparticles32 and polyaniline-doped chitosan micellar hydrogels33) are reported, showing outstanding anticancer performances of combined chemo-photothermal therapy, accompanied by NIR-triggered drug release, and imaging as well. Though CuS-based hydrogels have now been applied to various applications (e.g. wound healing and smart valves), their application to antitumor treatment is rarely reported.34–37 Recently, our team applied proteins with cysteine residues as sulfur sources to prepare metal sulfide nanoparticle-doped hydrogels for photothermal therapy.38,39 However, this procedure is not good for combined delivery of anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, not only due to that the strong alkaline condition is needed, but also precipitates (instead of hydrogels) formed by complexation of albumin and doxorubicin. In addition, methods for the synthesis of the reported nanocomposite hydrogels usually require very delicate pathways, either in the synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles or purification of residual monomers. There is always a pursuit of ideal theranostic platforms integrated with easy preparation, advanced properties and facile manipulation for industrial and clinical applications.
Herein, injectable NC hydrogels containing CuS nanoparticles are designed for NIR-triggered chemo-photothermal therapy (Fig. 1A). Gellan, a linear anionic polysaccharide, is approved by FDA for food and pharmaceutical applications.40 It exhibits good thermo-reversible gelling and shear-thinning properties, making it attractive as an injectable matrix for cartilage tissue engineering and wound healing as previously studied by us and others.40–43 The NC hydrogel was synthesized via a “one-pot” nanoprecipitation procedure (Ksp of CuS is about 10−36), starting merely from raw inorganic salts, citrate and gellan. Briefly, an aqueous mixture of CuCl2·2H2O, Na2S·9H2O, sodium citrate, and gellan was added in a glass flask and heated at 90 °C for 15 min, and then a greenish solution was produced, suggesting the formation of CuS nanoparticles. After cooling to room temperature, the NC hydrogel was obtained. The formation of CuS nanoparticles inside the hydrogel was confirmed by the TEM image (Fig. 1B). The size of CuS nanoparticles in the NC hydrogel is about 6–8 nm, smaller than that of citrate-coated CuS nanoparticles.8 A lattice fringe of the nanoparticles is clearly seen in the HR-TEM image (Fig. S1, ESI†). The measured lattice spacing is about 0.305 nm, representing the hexagonal CuS(102) planes. This result is consistent with the CuS nanostructures described in previous paper.8 Furthermore, aggregates of CuS nanoparticles were seldom found in SEM images, suggesting that small CuS nanoparticles were well dispersed in the matrix of hydrogels (Fig. S1, ESI†). Gellan is fully dissolved at elevated temperature while forms gels at room temperature, providing the steric stability for CuS nanoparticles.

(D) Photothermal response of the NC hydrogel with different concentrations of CuS nanoparticles after dilution. (E) Photothermal cycles of the NC hydrogel (120 ppm CuS). The irradiation was performed using 808 nm near-infrared light at a power of 1.0 W cm−2. 
The optical spectrum of the NC hydrogel exhibits broad adsorption with the maximum around 900 nm (Fig. 1C). The photothermal performance of the NC hydrogel depends on light power density and irradiation time. Typically, at a CuS concentration of 120 ppm, the temperature of the NC hydrogel increases by 48.4 °C under 808 nm laser irradiation with a power of 1.0 W cm−2 for 3 min (Fig. 1D). The photothermal response of the NC hydrogel is stable after five cycles of laser on/off (Fig. 1E). The photothermal conversion efficiency is calculated to be 54.6% (Fig. S2, ESI†). Such a value is superior to those of copper-based nanomaterials as previously reported.44,45 The reason for the high light-to-heat conversion remains unclear; one possible reason comes from the ultra small size of CuS nanoparticles (<10 nm).
The gelling property of the NC hydrogel is thermo-reversible; however, the gel-to-sol transition is observed to be a thermal hysteresis (Fig. S3, ESI†). The gelation behavior of the NC hydrogel was measured using a rheometer. The sol-to-gel transition temperature in the cooling process was found to be 43 °C (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the NC hydrogel is able to retain the cargo at physiological temperature. In addition, the gelation kinetics at 37 °C was also monitored. The storage moduli (G′) exceed loss moduli (G′′) at 130 s, reached equilibrium at 240 s (Fig. 2B), suggesting a rapid gelling process. The G′ of the NC hydrogel gradually decreases with an increase in temperature, demonstrating a temperature-responsive gelling property. Upon heating, the inter- and intra-molecular interaction of the NC hydrogel gradually decreases, accelerating the mobility of cargo nanoparticles or molecules. However, G′ is always higher than G′′ during the heating process, no gel-to-sol transition temperature was observed at 1.0 °C min−1 heating rate (Fig. S3, ESI†). At 60 °C, the hydrogel undergoes 20 min incubation to become fluid (Fig. S3, ESI†). The hysteresis suggests that the hydrogel network requires a long time for chain disentanglement, which hinders the cargo diffusion into the adjacent normal tissues under moderate photothermal treatment.

(B) Gelation kinetics of the NC hydrogel at 37 °C. (C) Shear rate-dependent viscosity of the NC hydrogel at 25 °C. (D) Recovery of moduli of the NC hydrogel by alternate strain sweeps at 37 °C. 
The shear-dependent viscosity of the hydrogel was also measured to verify the injectability of the NC hydrogel. The viscosity is strongly dependent on the shear rate, and lower viscosity occurs at a higher shear rate (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, once the shear force is broken off, the viscosity is fully recovered. The self-recovering property of the NC hydrogel was also reflected in the change in G′ by alternate strain sweeps. The G′ of the hydrogel is stable in the strain range of 0.01–1% (Fig. S4, ESI†). With a further increase of strain, the G′ is decreased dramatically. At a strain of 10%, G′ is lower than G′′, indicating that the hydrogel is fully destroyed. An alternate strain sweep demonstrates that the G′ of the NC hydrogel swiftly recovers after deformation. In the first cycle, the healing efficiency of G′ is about 60% at 10 s and grows to 90% at 180 s (Fig. 2D). In the following cycles, the healing efficiency of G′ is close to 100% compared to the former cycle. The self-recovering (also termed as self-healing) mechanism relies on the reversibility of cross-linking bonds, which are classified into dynamic covalent and noncovalent bonds. In the NC hydrogel, the good self-recovering property is attributable to the noncovalent bonds of building blocks, such as hydrogen bonds of gellan and metal coordination of copper and carboxylic acid.42,46,47
The photothermal-killing efficiency of the NC hydrogel was assessed on 4T1 murine breast cancer cell lines. The NC hydrogel was placed on the surface of attached cell lines and then implemented with laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.0 W cm−2, 3 min). Afterwards, the treated cells were analyzed by calcein-AM/PI staining assay. Clearly, dead cells (red fluorescence) and live cells (green fluorescence) were cut-off (Fig. 3A), revealing a spatially photothermal therapy triggered by the NIR light. The heat generated by CuS nanoparticles remained surrounding the irradiated area of the hydrogel due to the confined movement of CuS nanoparticles by the bulk hydrogel.

(E) Local photothermal effect of the NC hydrogel as a function of time after intratumoral injection. 
NIR-triggered release of the NC hydrogel was evaluated using doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as a drug model. The DOX-loaded NC hydrogel was prepared by mixing DOX into the precursor NC sol at 50 °C prior to gelling. Roughly, the NC hydrogel undergoes sustained release of DOX in pH 6.8 buffer due to the electrostatic interaction between carboxyl groups of gellan and the amine groups of DOX. Under NIR, the release of DOX was apparently increased due to temperature increase (Fig. S5, ESI†). The results indicate that the drug release is responsive to the NIR irradiation, but no burst release from the NC hydrogel under NIR irradiation. It is noticed that the NC hydrogel is not fully dissociated during the irradiation course. This slow gel-to-sol transition ensures that the hydrogel prevents the DOX and CuS nanoparticles against rapid diffusion from the matrix, thus triggering drug release in an on-demand way. Furthermore, the drug release kinetics of the NC composite can be finely tuned by the dose of NIR irradiation (time and power) as well as the concentration of gellan and CuS if necessary. In the case of combined chemo-photothermal therapy, a slow drug release is preferable to reduce the occurrence of tumor regression after the NIR-triggered hyperthermia.
The in vivo cancer therapy of the NC hydrogel was evaluated on a mice model bearing 4T1 cells. Mice were divided into four groups, and intratumorally injected by PBS, DOX, NC hydrogel, and DOX-loaded NC hydrogel, respectively. After injection, the latter two groups were further exposed to single irradiation for 3 min (808 nm, 0.3 W cm−2). After treatment, the tumor size was remarkably decreased in the DOX-loaded NC hydrogel group, showing the most effective therapy (Fig. 3B). By contrast, in the group of monotherapy (DOX and NC hydrogel), tumor recurrence was observed although the tumor growth was inhibited in the beginning week. On the 16th day, all mice were sacrificed; tumors and major organs were harvested. No tumor was found in three in four in the DOX-loaded NC hydrogel group (Fig. 3C). In addition, the body weight of mice treated by combined therapy (group of the DOX-loaded NC hydrogel) continually increased (Fig. 3D). The major organs demonstrate no lesion in the H&E staining for the group of the DOX-loaded NC hydrogel (Fig. S6, ESI†). Hence, the NC hydrogel is not only efficient but also safe for cancer therapy.
Furthermore, local retention of NC hydrogels in successive days was assessed on tumor-bearing mice by recording the temperature evolution of tumor-sites using thermography. NC hydrogels display a good repeated photothermal effect in the injection sites. The temperature rises to 58.4, 57.7, and 57.3 °C after 808 nm irradiation for 3 min on successive days (Fig. 3E). As a control, the photothermal effect of citrate-coated CuS nanoparticles decreases with time (53.8, 41.1, and 40.7 °C). It was reported that small CuS nanoparticles are easily cleared by kidneys or liver (half-life for 5.6 nm CuS nanodots was 11.7 h and for the 19 nm CuS nanoparticles was 16.2 h).15 The diffusion of CuS nanoparticles is well restrained by the NC hydrogel matrix, maintaining a stable photothermal effect. Though single irradiation is sufficient enough for cancer therapy in the present work, multiple irradiation may be required for repeated photothermal therapies in other cases.33 Accordingly, the NC hydrogel can perform optically controlled on-demand personalized therapy due to prolonged tumor retention of DOX and CuS nanoparticles.
In summary, CuS nanoparticle-based NC hydrogels were readily prepared and applied as injectable chemo-photothermal agents to ablate tumors precisely. The resulting NC hydrogels have advantages for cancer therapy as follows: (i) biocompatible materials; (ii) facile synthesis without further purification; (iii) huge loading space for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs; (iv) injectable and well-retained in the desired sites; (v) a stable photothermal effect for repeated therapy and NIR-triggered cargo release; and (vi) multiple therapy (chemo- and photothermal-therapy) and potential multimodal imaging. In particular, the distinct features of “one-pot synthesis, high light-to-heat efficiency, and compatibility” make them intriguing for various cancer therapies.
