    , Accepted 26th August 2014First published on 28th August 2014AbstractExtending the photoresponse from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible light region, while maintaining a high photocatalytic activity has been an important challenge for TiO2. We demonstrate the use of transition-metal doping treatment as a facile and effective strategy to substantially improve the performance of TiO2 nanorods in the visible light region for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The effect of Fe, Mn and Co as dopants on the PEC performance of the TiO2 nanorods was investigated, wherein the Fe doping is the most effective route to enhance the photoactivity of TiO2. The photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 sample significantly increases with bias voltage and reaches 2.92 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is five times higher than that of the undoped TiO2. Even under visible light illumination (>420 nm), the photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 is as high as 0.96 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion (IPCE) efficiency (up to ∼18%) measurements reveal that the Fe–TiO2 nanorod sample significantly improve the photoresponse not only in the UV region, but also in the visible light region. Fe doping not only enhances the visible light absorption of TiO2 nanorods by creating impurity states near the conduction band, but also obviously increases carrier density of TiO2, leading to effective carrier separation and transportation and relatively long electron lifetime. Because of their relatively high photocatalytic activity, the Fe–TiO2 nanorods can serve as a promising candidate in various areas, such as solar water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic hydrogen generation by water splitting has attracted extensive research interest in the past decade because of the increasing concern on energy and environmental issues.1–21 The photocatalytic water-splitting systems can be classified into two main categories: suspended photocatalysts and photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Since Fujishima and Honda have reported on the photoelectrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen on a TiO2 photoelectrode,22 semiconductor-based PEC water splitting by solar energy has been regarded as one of the most important ways for hydrogen generation.2,9 Generally, the PEC water splitting requires the semiconductor to meet the following property criteria: stability, appropriate band gap, efficient visible light absorption, and suitable band-edge positions to straddle the water redox potentials. Because most of narrow gap semiconductors suffer from photo-corrosion, photocatalytic materials still are limited to a few wide band gap oxide semiconductors such as TiO2,10,14,17,18 SrTiO3,10 and WO3.10 Among various wide band gap semiconductors, TiO2 is one of the most promising materials because of its low cost, good photocatalytic activity, and chemical stability.10 However, the efficiency of solar PEC water splitting based on TiO2 is very low because of its wide band gap, resulting in response only under UV light. Numerous approaches have been developed to enhance the visible light response of TiO2, such as metal or non-metal doping, quantum dot or dye sensitization and composite semiconductors.23 Herein, doping serves as an effective route in the modifications of TiO2 because it can maintain the integrity of the crystal structure and make favorable changes in the electronic structure. To date, a great deal of theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to 3d transition-metal (TM) doped TiO2.23,24 Theoretical researches predict that the formation of new states closed to the valence band and conduction band induced by 3d TM dopants results in significant energy gap narrowing together with enhanced optical absorption.24,25 However, many experimental reports indicate that the effect of red shift by 3d TM dopants is not obvious, and these dopants in TiO2 will act as recombination centers, which result in the limited enhancement of photocatalytic activity or even lower than pure TiO2.23,26–30 Until recently, to improve the visible light absorption while maintaining a high photocatalytic activity has been challenging.
Additionally, the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 can be improved by rationally controlling its morphology and orientation etc.31–38 For example, vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays as photoanode not only provide large surface area and efficient light trapping, but also have short diffusion distance for photogenerated minority carriers, which is expected to facilitate the charge separation and reduce the loss due to electron–hole recombination.33 Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to growing various oriented TiO2 nanostructures and modifying their properties, such as oriented single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods39 or nanowires,31,35 hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanowires,33 Sn doped TiO2 nanowires,34 branched TiO2 nanorods,36 and W doped TiO2 nanowires.38 However, most of these efforts only improve the PEC performance of TiO2 nanowires in the UV region, and the improvement in the visible light region is very limited. For example, the IPCE values of H:TiO2 and H, N–TiO2 nanowires are below 0.7% from 440 nm to 650 nm (ref. 33) and 4% from 420 nm to 550 nm,32 respectively. To our knowledge, there have been no reports on the 3d-TM doped TiO2 nanorod arrays with both improved PEC performance and strong visible light response.
Here, we demonstrate that a significant improvement of the PEC water splitting activity under visible light irradiation based on TiO2 nanorod arrays can be achieved by doping 3d TM using a facile solution method. The PEC performance of the TM doped TiO2 nanorods can further be adjusted by the concentration of TM ion in the solution. The effect of Fe, Mn and Co as dopants on the PEC performance of TiO2 nanorods was investigated in which Fe doping is the most effective route to enhance the photoactivity of TiO2. The photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 sample significantly increases with bias voltage and reaches 2.92 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is five times higher than that of the undoped TiO2. Even under visible light illumination (>420 nm), the photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 is as high as 0.96 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) (∼18%) indicates that Fe doped TiO2 nanorod arrays substantially show enhanced photoresponse not only in the UV region, but also in the visible light region in comparison to the undoped TiO2 nanorod sample, and exhibit long-term stability. The transition-metal doping hydrothermal treatment developed by us is a facile and effective strategy to substantially improve the performance of TiO2 nanorods for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The relatively high PEC performance of the Fe–TiO2 nanorods opens new opportunities in various areas, such as solar water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.
2. Experimental section
TiO2 nanorod arrays on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate were grown by a hydrothermal method previously reported by Liu et al.39 For doping TM in TiO2, 1 g of urea and 10–100 mM TM nitrate were dissolved in 15 mL aqueous solution. The solution and the FTO substrate with TiO2 nanorod arrays were transferred to a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and put into an electric oven at 150 °C for 2 h. When the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, these samples were cleaned with deionized water and dried in air. The colors of the samples were obviously different than that of TiO2 nanorod arrays without dopants, and depended on the doping metal ion. Finally, the samples were annealed in a furnace at 450 °C for 30 min.
The morphologies and structures of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X'Pert Pro diffractometer), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer Physics PHI 5300), and field-emission transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Tecnai F20). For TEM analysis, samples were prepared by scratching off nanorod flakes on a Ni grid.
The photoelectrochemical measurement was performed in 1 M KOH solution using a three-electrode configuration. TiO2 nanorod arrays with or without 3d TM dopants were used as the working electrodes (photoanodes), saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a platinum foil as a counter electrode. The photocurrent measurements were carried out by applying an external bias to the cell using an electrochemical station (Zahner IM6e, Germany) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and using a 150 W Xe solar simulator (Newport 94021A) with AM 1.5G filter as light source. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured on a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD) with a tungsten halogen lamp (CT-TH-150), a calibrated silicon diode and a monochromator (Crowntech QEM24-S 1/4 m).
3. Results and discussion
The TM-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays on FTO were prepared using a hydrothermal method. After the doping treatment, the color of the samples will change from gray-white (for pure TiO2) to light red (for Fe doped TiO2 denoted by Fe–TiO2), brown-red (for Mn doped TiO2 denoted by Mn–TiO2) and yellow (for Co doped TiO2 denoted by Co–TiO2), as shown in Fig. 1 SEM images reveal that vertically or slantingly aligned nanorod arrays were uniformly grown in high density on the FTO substrate (Fig. 1). These nanorods are uniform with a rectangular cross section. The nanorod diameters are in the range of 50–300 nm and the typical nanorod lengths are around 5 μm. There are no obvious changes in morphology by comparing with SEM images of the samples before and after doping. From the insets in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the color is uniform, indicating uniform distribution of dopants in the TiO2 nanorods. The EDS results of the TM-TiO2 nanorods are shown in Table S1 (see ESI†).

To investigate the effect of doping on the crystal structure, XRD spectra were collected from the TiO2 nanorods and TM doped TiO2 nanorods grown at various metal salt concentrations (50 mM for Fe– and Mn–TiO2, 10 mM for Co–TiO2), as shown in Fig. 2. If no special explanation, all the following samples were prepared under these conditions. All the XRD patterns have two diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 36.5° and 63.2°, which can be indexed as the (101) and (002) reflection of tetragonal rutile TiO2 (JCPDS No. 88-1175). The (002) diffraction peak dominating over the (101) peak indicates that the nanorods preferentially grew along the <001> direction. Other peaks can be contributed to the FTO substrate. Obviously, there is no impurity peak after doping. The decrease of the (002) peak intensity depends on the doping metal element in which the most decrease is observed for Co, the second for Mn and the least for Fe. These decreases may be because of the increase in defect density in TiO2 structures, which has also been observed in the hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanowire arrays.33

Structural characterizations of the TM-doped TiO2 nanorods were performed by TEM and HRTEM. Fig. 3a shows a TEM image of the Fe–TiO2 nanorod. Essentially, the diameters of the nanorods under TEM observation are consistent with the SEM results. The HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3b reveals the single-crystalline structure of the nanorod, and gives a lattice fringe of about 0.32 nm, corresponding to the d110 space of the bulk rutile TiO2. The dopant distribution in the nanorod was further analyzed by EDS. Variations in the O Kα, Ti Lα, Ti Kα, Fe Lα and Fe Kα signals along the nanorod are given in Fig. 3c. Clearly, the distribution of Fe element along the nanorod axial and radial direction is uniform. The analysis of EDS mapping was also applied to Mn– and Co–TiO2 nanorods, which confirm that the distribution of Mn and Co in nanorods is also uniform (see Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI†).

XPS was employed to explore the chemical states of the surface elements of the 3d-TM doped TiO2 nanorod arrays. Two peaks at 464.3 and 458.5 eV were observed from the fully scanned TiO2 spectrum (Fig. 4a), which can be attributed to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 spin–orbital components in TiO2, respectively.40,41 After the doping treatments, the high-resolution Mn, Fe and Co 2p XPS spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 4b–d, respectively. Fig. 4b shows the Mn 2p core-level XPS spectrum with two peaks at 653.5 (Mn 2p1/2) and 641.6 eV (Mn 2p3/2). The binding energies of Mn 2p are consistent with that of Mn2O3.42 The Fe 2p XPS spectrum is identical with Fe 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks centered at binding energies of 724.4 and 710.6 eV, which are consistent with the typical values for Fe2O3.43 In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 4d), the doublet peaks at 796.6 and 780.2 eV could be indexed to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. The peaks could be assigned to the bivalent cobalt corresponding to the standard CoO.44,45 The above results clearly indicate that Mn, Fe and Co have been successfully incorporated into the TiO2 nanorods.

To evaluate the effect of dopants on the PEC properties of TiO2, we measured the photocurrents of colored Fe–, Mn– and Co–TiO2 nanorod photoanodes and compared them with those of the undoped TiO2 nanorods. All TiO2 nanorod samples were fabricated into photoanodes with a well-defined area of 0.2 cm2. The PEC measurements were conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.5), under simulated sunlight illumination at 100 mW cm−2 from a 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter. The linear sweeps of TiO2 (gray) and TiO2 nanorods doped with Fe (wine), Mn (orange), and Co (green-yellow), in a potential range of −1.0 to 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl, are shown in Fig. 5a. It is seen that the dark current densities are essentially negligible (3–7 μA cm−2) even at high potentials of 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent densities significantly increase with bias voltage and reach 0.76 mA cm−2 for Co–TiO2, 1.25 mA cm−2 for Mn–TiO2 and 2.92 mA cm−2 for Fe–TiO2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are two and five times higher than the photocurrent density of 0.56 mA cm−2 for the undoped TiO2, except a slight increase for Co–TiO2. It is obvious that Fe doping by a simple hydrothermal method greatly improves the PEC properties of TiO2 and yields a maximum photocurrent density of 2.92 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This value is slightly better than the best reported values of 2.8 mA cm−2 for TiO2 photoanodes,46 2.5 mA cm−2 at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl for hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanowire arrays33 and 2.0 mA cm−2 at 0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl for Ti–Fe–O nanotube arrays.37 The TiO2, Mn–TiO2 and Fe–TiO2 samples exhibit an obvious increase in photocurrent density at an onset potential of −0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl and reach their saturated photocurrents at a low potential of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, except that the photocurrent density of Co–TiO2 sample increases near-linearly with the applied potential and doesn't reach saturation at the scanning voltage range.

(d) Calculated photoconversion efficiencies for the four samples, as a function of applied potential vs. RHE. 
To test the photoresponse of TM-doped TiO2 samples in the visible light region, photocurrents were measured with the use of a 420 nm long-pass filter, as shown in Fig. 5b. The onset potentials for the four samples positively shift to −0.64 V vs. Ag/AgCl because of the decrease in the photogenerated carrier. The photocurrent densities of TM-doped TiO2 samples are higher than that of TiO2 (gray). Under visible light illumination, the photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 is as high as 0.96 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. For Mn– and Co–TiO2, the photocurrent densities are 0.34 and 0.14 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. These results indicate that in this case Fe doping is an effective method to promote the PEC performance of TiO2 in the visible light region. However, the enhancement induced by Co doping is relatively limited, which probably results from the increase in defect density supported by XRD data. For enhancing photocatalytic activity, effective carrier transfer to the catalyst/solution interface is another important factor, in addition to broad and strong optical absorption. Only if the electron and hole excited by photon are transferred to the surface, photocatalytic reactions could occur. In case of doping, metal ions could enhance optical absorption, but they likely behave as recombination centers, which would hinder electron–hole transferring to the surface. Therefore, there exists an optimum concentration of doped metal ion, below which the improvement of optical absorption is negligible, and above which the photocatalytic activity decreases because of the increase in recombination. Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent densities of Fe–, Mn– and Co–TiO2 nanorod arrays at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl as a function of metal ion concentration. The Fe– and Mn–TiO2 nanorod arrays prepared using 50 mM Fe(NO3)3 and Mn(NO3)2 solutions, respectively, yield a maximum photocurrent density. The photocurrent density of Co–TiO2 nanorod arrays decreases as the Co ion concentration increases. By optimizing the metal ion concentration, the condition for maximum photocurrent density was obtained.
To quantitatively determine the conversion efficiency of photon energy to chemical energy from TM doped TiO2 samples, the photoconversion efficiency is calculated based on the equation,9η = I (1.23 − V)/Jlight, where V is the applied voltage versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), I is the photocurrent density at the measured potential, and Jlight is the irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). As shown in Fig. 5d, the Fe–TiO2 exhibits the highest efficiency of 1.35% at a low bias of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.6 V vs. RHE), the Mn–TiO2 achieves 0.58% at a voltage of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.6 V vs. RHE), and the Co–TiO2 shows 0.24% at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.7 V vs. RHE). Compared to the photoconversion efficiency of 0.26% at −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.6 V vs. RHE) measured from the undoped TiO2, the Fe doping can significantly increase the maximum photocurrent at a similar saturation potential and greatly improve the photoresponse under visible light, thus leading to a considerably improved photoconversion efficiency. Although the photocurrent density of Co–TiO2 is higher than that of pure TiO2 especially under visible light illumination, the photoconversion efficiency is slightly lower than that of pure TiO2 because of the high saturation potential.
Considering that the TiO2 nanorods doped with different metal ions exhibit different colors, to further investigate their wavelength-dependent photoelectrochemical properties is important for understanding the interplay between the photocatalytic activity and the light absorption of these samples. IPCE is powerful to quantitatively reveal their photocatalytic activity as a function of wavelength of incident light. We have performed IPCE measurements of the TM-TiO2 nanorod samples at −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 6a. IPCE can be expressed by the following equation,IPCE = (1240I)/(λJlight)where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and Jlight is the measured irradiance at a specific wavelength. The IPCE values of the Fe–TiO2 nanorod sample increase slowly from almost zero at 560 nm to 3.0% at 500 nm, and then rapidly increase to 15.6% at 430 nm, and finally maintain relatively high efficiencies of 16–18.3% at 300–430 nm. Clearly, the Fe–TiO2 nanorod sample significantly improves the photoresponse not only in UV region, but also in the visible light region compared to the undoped TiO2 nanorods. Although the Mn–TiO2 nanorods also exhibit obviously enhanced photoactivity in the visible light region, the IPCE values gradually decrease from 7% at 400 nm to 0.6% at 300 nm. For the Co–TiO2 nanorod sample, the photoresponse is also extended to the visible light region, but the IPCE values are lower than those of TiO2. The IPCE results of the samples are consistent with their photocurrent data. In the present circumstances, Fe doping is the most effective route to enhance the photoactivity of TiO2.
 Fig. 6  (a) IPCE spectra of the TiO2 (gray), Fe–TiO2 (wine), Mn–TiO2 (orange) and Co–TiO2 (green-yellow) nanorod photoelectrodes measured at an applied bias of 0.6 V (vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH solution. (b) Optical absorption spectra of the TiO2 (gray), Fe–TiO2 (wine), Mn–TiO2 (orange) and Co–TiO2 (green-yellow) nanorod arrays on the FTO substrates. 
To understand the reason for such a discrepancy between the photocurrents and the integration of the IPCE results, the effect of light intensity on the photocurrents of Fe–TiO2 were investigated at an external bias 0.6 V vs. RHE (see in ESI†). Fig. S3† shows the variation of the photocurrents with the incident optical power. In the relatively low power range, the photocurrent is low partly because of the more important contribution of trap recombination. Trap filling can enhance the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers and can improve the quantum yield at higher light intensities,47–49 With increased intensity, the traps can be saturated, leading to enhanced photocurrent. Therefore, we think that the relatively low IPCE values should be attribute to trap filling effect due to weaker light intensity at IPCE measurements.
The optical absorption of TM-doped TiO2 samples was measured to further analyze the contribution for their PEC performance, as shown in Fig. 6b. All absorption spectra of the TM-doped TiO2 show an obviously red shift, which can be attributed to the charge transfer transitions between the metal ion d electrons and the TiO2 conduction or valence band. The band gaps of the TM-doped TiO2 and undoped TiO2 estimated by their absorption spectra (see in ESI, Fig. S3†) are 2.15 eV (for Fe doped TiO2), 2.17 eV (for Mn doped TiO2), 2.34 eV (for Co doped TiO2), and 3.01 eV (for undoped TiO2). Although all TM-doped TiO2 samples exhibit a broader and stronger absorption than the undoped TiO2, only the Fe–TiO2 sample achieves the significant enhancement of the PEC performance. Relatively limited improvement for Mn–TiO2 and negligible enhancement for Co–TiO2 probably results from the inefficient separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers.
To further understand the different PEC performance of the TiO2 nanorods doped with different TM ions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark. The Mott–Schottky plots of the undoped and TM doped TiO2 nanorods are displayed in Fig. 7. All the four TiO2 nanorod samples exhibit a positive slope in the corresponding Mott–Schottky plots, as expected for n-type semiconductor. According to the Mott–Schottky equation,1/c2 = (E − EFB − kT/e)/Ndeε0εwhere c is the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor, E is the applied potential, EFB is the flat band potential, T is the temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant, e is the elemental charge, Nd is the charge carrier density, and ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and the relative permittivity of the TiO2 (ε = 170),50 respectively. The charge carrier densities (Nd) of the TiO2 nanorod samples were calculated from the Mott–Schottky plots using the following equation:  
 Fig. 7  (a) Mott–Schottky plots collected at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark for the Fe–TiO2, Mn–TiO2, Co–TiO2 and TiO2 nanorods. Inset: Mott–Schottky plots of the Fe–TiO2, Mn–TiO2 and TiO2 nanorods, measured under the same conditions. (b) Photocurrent densities vs. time of the Fe–TiO2, Mn–TiO2, Co–TiO2 and TiO2 nanorods measured at 0.5 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm−2 solar illumination. 
The calculated carrier densities of the Fe–TiO2, Mn–TiO2, Co–TiO2 and TiO2 nanorods were 2.32 × 1019, 1.81 × 1018, 5.31 × 1017 and 9.12 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. Obviously, Fe doping leads to a significant enhancement in charge carrier density in TiO2. As the donor concentration increases the electron concentration in the conduction band also increases, with the Fermi level energy moving closer to the conduction band edge, which facilitates the charge separation at the TiO2/electrolyte interface by increasing the degree of band bending at the TiO2 surface.33 The effective charge separation and transportation and enhancement of visible light absorption are inferred to be the major reasons for the IPEC improvement of the Fe–TiO2 nanorods. In addition, both the Mn–TiO2 and the Co–TiO2 samples show a decrease in charge carrier density compared to that of the undoped TiO2 sample. Mn and Co doping probably induces more defects in TiO2 structures than Fe doping, which acts as recombination centers and results in ineffective charge separation and transportation. It may be responsible for the relatively limited PEC performance improvement for Mn–TiO2 and negligible enhancement for Co–TiO2 compared to that of the undoped TiO2.
To better understand the enhanced PEC performance, the inherent electronic properties of the TM doped TiO2 nanorods were characterized by measuring their open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCPD). OCPD was measured to assess photoelectron lifetime and thus to evaluate the recombination rate of the photoelectrons and holes. OCPD measurement consists of turning off illumination at a steady state and monitoring the subsequent decay of photovoltage, Voc, with time (see Fig. S3 in ESI†). The Voc decay rate is directly related to the photoelectron lifetime. The calculated photoelectron lifetime is shown in Fig. S4 as a function of Voc (see ESI†). Clearly, the photoelectron lifetime increases with decrease in Voc. The Fe doped TiO2 nanorods showed relatively long electron lifetime, contributing to its high PEC performances, in good agreement with the above results. The TiO2 photoanode stability was tested at −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl under continuous solar illumination for 8000 seconds (Fig. 7b). There is no observable degradation, indicating excellent chemical and structural stability of the TM doped TiO2 nanorods for long-term PEC conversion. We further performed the O2 evolution experiment of Fe–TiO2 sample over a period of 600 min to evaluate its O2 generation ability and stability (see in ESI†). The Fe–TiO2 photoanode under visible light illumination exhibited a stable O2 generation ability, as shown in Fig. S8.† The calculated faradaic efficiency is around 86%.
4. Conclusion
We report the first demonstration of transition-metal doping treatment as a facile and effective strategy to substantially improve the performance of TiO2 nanorods for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The effect of Fe, Mn and Co as dopants on the PEC performance of the TiO2 nanorods were investigated in which the Fe doping is the most effective route to enhance the photoactivity of TiO2. The photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 sample significantly increases with bias voltage and reaches 2.92 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are five times higher than that of the undoped TiO2. Even under visible light illumination (>420 nm), the photocurrent density of Fe–TiO2 is as high as 0.96 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (∼18%) measurements reveal that the Fe–TiO2 nanorod sample significantly improves the photoresponse not only in the UV region, but also in the visible light region. Fe dopants not only enhance the visible light absorption of TiO2 nanorods by forming impurity energy levels near the conduction band, but also obviously increase charge carrier density of TiO2, leading to effective carrier separation and transportation and relatively long electron lifetime. Because of their relatively high photocatalytic activity, Fe–TiO2 nanorods can serve as a promising candidate for various areas, such as solar water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.
